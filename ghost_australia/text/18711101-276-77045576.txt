OUR ADELAIDE LETTER.., (From our own Correspondent,) . October 28r l871i. X have to begin my letter with ao obituary notice, Lady Edith/ Christian: Eefgusson, the amiable and accomplished wife of His. Excellency the Governor, ia dead; Foil many. weeks-almost months-she has-been! suffering from acute pain, and death was. aai much due to,' the uttor exhaustion of 'hen system as to the malady itself, -H»r illnesa* was of inuoh the same cbaracfeori aa* that which caused the death of: her mother, the Lady Susan Georgfyna, daughter of. the Marquis of Tweeddale; The deceased lady, is descended from the noble,houses ofcDal housie and Tweeddale, and' as one of: the morning papers remarks, her death will throw mauy distinguished families in the old country into mourning,. Concerning the life of Her Ladyship, there is uot" muoh to be said in which the public will feel special interest. She has one sister married* to the brother of Lord Mayo, Governor-General of India. Her union with' Sir James Fergusson took place in l859, and she leaves four; chil dren, one Of them having-been born in South Australia. Although never taking a. very prominent part in benevolent movements,of a public nature, Her Ladyship identified herself very closely with many undertakings in connection with the Church of England. In all her religious duties she was most; assiduous, and her many privato'virtues are testified to by those who had the honor of her friendship. Her death took place at 10 o'clock on Saturday morning, and although, it had been anticipated for days it created a very general feeling' of sorrow. The Gov ernment office doors were shut, flags were hoisted half-mast at many places throughout the city, and the partial closing of the shutters in places of ousiness bore evidence of the publio regret at the mournful occur rence, The funeral, is to take place to morrow afternoon, the body lying in state at Government House during the earlier hours of the day. The Eduoation debato has made progress in tho Assembly, Mr. H. K. Hughes, the Attorney-General, Mr. Glyde, and Mr. Pearce having had an opportunity last Tues day of placing their opiuious upon record. Out of doors the controversy between appos ing sections has oeon prosecuted with un diminished vigor. The newspapers still teem with letters, and the resources of the combatants as well as their reserve of sup potters appear to be inexhaustible,, It is true that cne epistles, or ma.ny of them, con tain more words than arguments, more sound than sense, but how can a contcst be main tained on religious matters without these disadvantages. Readers are beginning to feel fatigued, and one or two of them nave urged tuat it is quite time to chauge the subject) but tho editors are unusually com placent, -and have as yet given no hint of ex hausted space, "Last night the secularists had. their demonstration in the Town Hall, but. their triumph was rudely interfered with by the state-aided bible propagandists. Ap parent# convinced of the falsity of the posi. tion assumed by themselves in excluding secularists from the White's Booms meeting, an^, anxious to give early proof .of repent ance, they forced themselves into the hall by scores, gnd by unseemly interruptions sought to . embarrass the speakers. Upon what principle of good manners or good taste they could justify their intrusion into a room hired by the friends of a partioular cause with a view to the promotion of that cause, it is difHoult to say. Their anxiety to acknowledge their- error in- aetting tho example for one-sided nieefciri&s; was.laud- ? able, but they might have chosen a mora appropriate time and place for'thy admission, As it was, they not only uproariously sought to cry down,unpalatable declarations on tft& part of the speakers, and ta negativev'thfii!?
