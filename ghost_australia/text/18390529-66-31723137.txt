Original Poetry. TO -------- ON A MOVEMENT OF BEETHOVEN'S. BY G. J. MACDONALD, ESQ. \--------Other times come back on me With recollected music, though the tone Is changed and solemn----. CHILDE HAROLD. AYE! once more touch the strings That Memory may feed upon that strain, And over-live again The days, When the heart gloried in these golden lays That give the spirit wings. Simple --yet how profound The feeling that indues this deathless air! Did heart-ache or despair, Or dream, Inspire its notes, that spread so charm'd a stream Of harmony around? Sometimes the deep notes swell Soft as a sigh--the semi-tone of thought; Yet sometimes seem they fraught With fate.-- Storm-toned, spirit- rousing jarr'd with hate, And booming like a knell. Wild, massy, swift and dark, The clashing strains of harmony unite, While o'er their solemn flight, One note Of wandering sweetness doth serenely float, Like love-call of the lark. Those gloomy chords at last, Roll wave-like through the caverns of the mind, And mystically wind Their way Into dark thoughts, that rise in drear array-- The ghost-dreams of the past. And then the plaintive tone Of pastoral pipe, or mountain-brook, or bird, In tranc√®d thought is heard, Until The faint heart fails beneath The Master's skill, And yearns to be alone. Yet, lady! yet once more, Bring back that banded train of hopes and fears, The passion of past years, The spell That ruled my Being in its inmost cell, And then, sweet friend! give o'er.
