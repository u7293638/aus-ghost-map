Luoy Burrowes was a quiet, retiring girl, but with superior capacity, and her ap pearance was interesting, without being extraordinarily attractive. She poaseBBed a sweet, pensive countenance, and her eyes, which were large mid liquid, had a sad, tender look in them, which was very' beautiful. Her pleasing and modest de meanour had prepossessed Mr. Stapp, and thus she had been chosen for the position she now held under his roof. Under it, however, she remained for many years, until indeed her duties in the nursery and schoolroom terminated in due cuurse, and her young charges were, so to speak, out in the world.. With the exception of this one shortcoming, in her general oonduct she had rendered entire satisfaction to the worthy little seoretary and his wife, and he was pre pared to give her an excellent character, and to find her another situation. But Luoy Burrowes had different views, and having saved a little money determined to give up teaching for the future, and adopt a career which she felt would be more consonant with her nature. Thus we lose sight of her for a long while, aB did the family, of the Stapps. Their paths in life lay in entirely opposite directions.' With, them this- history has no. further' concern. '-' CHAPTER V. — THE VOICE KEVEALED. Thus time' flies by, and nearly twenty years; have ; passed - since that /strange episode 'in' Lucy Burrowes's life took' place'. -She is now a middle-aged woman, and having carried out the intention she formed on leaving Mr. Stapp's family, has become a trained nurse in one of the great London hospitals. She delights in her duties ; the patients love her, and her quiet step brings hope and comfort with it to many a sufferer's bedside. . , . , One dark November night, when a dense fog was obscuring the atmosphere, and preventing the wayfarer* in the streets from distinguishing the pavement frpin the roadway, and the inmates of the, houses; from perceiving the abodes of their, opposite neighbours, an old man was brought into the accident ward of the hospital, where Lucy Burrowes officiated; In endeavouring to cross the crowded street, he had been knocked down and run over by a van. His head was badly hurt,1 and he had sustained a severe frac ture of the thigh. It was abad case,; and the'dpetofs from the first thought so;,' and even said so among themselves. Nurse Burrowes was especially selected to attend to it. ,''. / ... ; ' . ;.,' ,' ,-y:'l--'\\!- ?'- ?

The expression was not on your face even till our eyes met, and then a ray which shot from yours struck me dumb.' 'True,' whispered the sick man, with a gleam of gratitude in his face, 'and you Baved my life.' 'Ah,' murmured Lucy, clasping her hands, as if relieved by the thought ; ' but I ask again, what made. you look at me as you did 1 That glance has never been out of my sight since, though twenty years have pasaed.

But this was of little moment to Luoy. ' It was strong, filial love then^' she argued with, herself, 'looking through my eyes, that eventful day, which prevented my speaking the fatal word which would have brought my father to an ignominious, and terrible end.
