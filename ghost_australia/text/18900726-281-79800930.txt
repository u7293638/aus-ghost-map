It is a buiy aaono ; for upon that silent highway, whorov formerly the : gilded barges of royalty glided to nnd fro with cargoes.of dambs'and courtiers, black bilges now pass in slow prooession, led by asthmatic tugs, of the moat democratic ap pearance. '??'-. 'y?.:"'?-? :'.

Wo muat run no risks in a place like this. ??: -I am clad to too thnt you are alive to the fact that the man is a dangerou'a:character.".'' \ ?- Aa ho drovo that evening toward -Lom don Ilridgo Station through thojarap-lit ntroets, Mr. Lintock peered restlessly out of tho carriage window ; and in tho largo thoroughfares, whero mon with uncouth, dissipated' fuooa laughed and talked at half.open tavorn doors, ho looked, about him with tho horror of ono.who dreadod to roedgniso aomo repulsive face jtraong thom. Jt was not until tho wharf|owhoi v had passed into the crowtiod -station that ho accmod to throw olt'.in some 'degree this curiosity about his fellow-men. ? Mr. Lintock lived at Grecnwioh, and tho train waa on the point of starting. As ho stepped into nn empty compartment and tho porter wna cloaing tho door, a young man camo up out of breath and atopped in after him. By tho dim light they recognised eaoh othor as friends, nnd a warm oxchango of greetings fol lowed. "Why, Ovorbook, what takes you to Greenwich, oh ?" said the wharf-owner. " I was coming to visit you." " To di?e with us?" "Yes." "I am delighted to boar it."._ .' A matter of business between Mr., Liutock and Percy Overbeck had origi nally brought them together. ? Overbeck ? had taken part of a houso in Trinity .Square as a junior partner in a Hamburg (irm, and often had occasion to land goods at Wythred's wharf., Mr. Lintock, in his younger days, had known Overbeck's parents ; and he had welcomed, to a place on his hearth this son of his old friends, as soon as ho preacnted his letter of re commendation ; and ao it came to pass that tho young Hamburg . merchant.' quickly learned to realise that MX Lin tock had a fascinating daughters' Nor did he despair of somo day, winning, Borthn Lintock's hand. *, "'."' "*' ' Tho train was in rapid motion.'' The two friends sitting oppoaito each other, wero chatting pleasantly, when a startling ohango camo over Mr. Lintock's faco. Tlhc expresaion waa that of nbject terror. With his oyea fixed as though he were fascinated—Jxed upon tho further win dow of tho carriage—tho wharf-owner sat palo and speechless. Ovorbeck could not withdraw his gaze ; and so completely did Mr. Lintock's faco and attitude impress him, that for the moment ho imagined something super natural hid appeared to him. Turning his heud to follow the direction of tho wharf-owm-r's eyes, Ovorbeck waa sur prised to sco no phantom—nothing visible beyond tho window but black night. Overbeck placed his hand on llr. Lin tock's arm. " Aro wo in danger ? You staro as though you anticipated something ter rible. If there is nny roal—" Tho older man raised his hand to silonco his companion, at the sanio timo covering his cyos with tho other as if to shut out somo rcpulsiva sight. " Thoro i* no danger—ho : danger nbwv It has gone by." "v- '? r. -t ?~<-. Thia answer, in Ovorbock'a oxsitod stato of mind, did not satisfy. _ '?Thoro was danger, then?

The great iron gate, leading into a largo, courtyard, might havo bean the etitimico to v prison, nud ita gloomy aapect filled Porcy Over bock's mind with vague fears.

For a moment tho wharf-owner placed hia hand across his eyes, as ho Had dono in tho railway carriage ; but quickly re covering himself ho aaid : " Clogatoun had often beon omployed on tho wharf, nnd aa often discharged, owing to his tipsy and quarrelsome habits. . no insulted evcryono ho came across, when excited by drink, nntil.it was thought ho must be out of .his mind;.

Ovcrbeck was pacing up and down tho room. - Ho could not rest with tho thought of Mr. Liutock insulted. and harassed nt every turn. " Does anyone know of thia affair ex cept ourselves ?" he asked.

CHAPTER IV. ' After lighting Mr. .Lintock'a lamp, D.'. ket hnd descendod to tbo basement on a l.vel with tbo wharf.

He tried to throw oil bia drowsiness, for ho was tbe solo watchman' in tho building. If any catastrophe occurred the blame would fall ou hia shoulders. Ducket took bia lantern and went out.
