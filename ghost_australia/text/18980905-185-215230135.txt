BENDIGO. (BY WIRE.â€”FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT) Sunday. THE GHOST SCARE. The ghost scare which has prevailed in this city for some nights past was intensified on Saturday whan it became known that a tram- way employe on his way home at an early hour that morning had seen the apparition in View street. He had a revolver in his pocket but was too frightened to use it. He states that it glided over a 6 foot fence, stood on a seat in the reserve, and then passed over the island in the dam towards the show ground. Senior-constable Carrallan and Con- stable Kelly were on duty in the vicinity, and on being informed of the occurance scoured the streets, but were unable to find any trace of the ghost, although there were footpints on the seat mentioned. An opinion exists that the scare is being caused by some person with a flashlight magic lantern. THE HUNTLY MYSTERY. The remains of the man found near the Five Mile Creek ago have not yet been iden- tifed, and opinion is divided as to whether it is a case of suicide or murder. THE WEATHER. Rainy weather has prevailed for the last few days, and to-night thunderstorms, accom- panied by a heavy downpour, took place.
