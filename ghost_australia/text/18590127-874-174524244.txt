PUNCH'S ODE TO BURNS. Immortal Bob! In memory of whom five hundred swells, So rumour tells, Met tother day to socially hob-nob At Wedel's,— Each blithe-souled body Swizzling toddy, Free flowing from exhaustless bowls and ladles. 'Tis very gratifying, This solemn ratifying, Of general verdict that, if not a wise man, Yet Bob, my hearty, Illustrious party, You were a monstrous talented exciseman. Oh! glorious BURNS, 'Tis sad how slowly Such wondrous excellence the world discerns, One feels so wholly Disgusted with our species and their taste, When fellows waste Their time and cash On Nancy-Lakish Tennysonian trash, And wretched wishy- washy balderdash Of Longfellow and chaps Whose stuff, perhaps, May suit some sickly-minded puling folk, But Bob, my darling. I won't be snarling At such small-beery men whose fame will croak With each weak whimsey So pitifully flimsy That people tolerate of tyrant fashion, It really drives a fellow in a passion, Right fierce and hot To think that Burns, the glorious-hearted Scot, Contended his whole life with rugged rubs, Of Fortune, getting everlasting snubs, And spending his best days in guaging tubs, And, when deceased, A lot of coves Go pitching into fishes and to loaves, Guzzle and feast, And spend as much in gastronomic folly As might have made poor Burns for life-time jolly, Long speeches spinning out, Much improved when printed, By slightly thinning out, Brimful of praise and compliment unstinted Chorused by men, full- stomached, and full-hearted, In honor of the glorious departed: It's very fine, To meet and dine, And kick up this commemorative shine, One don't object to all of this a jot Or tittle, The awkward scandal of the thing, and what Disturbs one not a little, Is though we've dosed Poor Burns's ghost With glory—yet, in life he wanted victual, Now, every one proclaims himself your debtor, Poor Burns, they really should have used you better
