The Old Spinet. It is slim and trim and spare, Like the slender Lady Claire In the gowns they used to wear Long ago; And it stands there in the gloom Of the gabled attic room, Like a ghost whose vacant tomb None may know. I can see the lady's hands, White as lillies, as she stands Strumming fragments of Durand's On the keys; And I hear the thin, sweet strain Of the old, old hymns again, Like the sob of windless rain In the trees. She would play the minuet For the stately-stepping set, While the ardent dancers met, Hands and hearts; Did the old-time spinet care If Dan Cupid, unaware, Pricked the breasts of brave and fair With his darts? Now the spiders with their floss Up and down the keyboard cross, And the strings are dull as dross, Once so bright; No one cares to touch the keys — Stained and worn old ivories — Save the ghosts some dreamer sees In the night.
