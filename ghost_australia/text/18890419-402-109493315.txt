How to Treat Stammerers. I wish to show parents and guardians what a dreadful thing to a high-spirited and am- bitious boy stammering is. I say emphati- cally, if taken in its earliest stages, it can be effectually checked. People are apt to imagine that it is a thing of small moment, and a defect which the boy will 'grow out of.' Fathers, I tell you plainly that, tri- fling as it may appear to you, it is a matter of terrible importance to the lad's future wel- fare, comfort, and happiness. In some odd cases, undoubtedly, sufferers do 'grow out of it;' but in the great majority it grows upon them till they become confirmed stammerers, and their whole life is overshadowed by a dark cloud. A few words to the general public as to their treatment of stammerers or stutterers. Many kind-hearted men and women endeavour to help the sufferer by saying the word which they imagine he is striving to utter. Friends, don't do this. In the majority of cases you will get hold of the wrong word, and make his confusion worse confounded. And apart from this, it is ex- tremely galling to him to be dependent on other people in this way. If you wish to earn his gratitude and respect, endeavour to listen to him as if you had not noticed any- thing peculiar in his speech. Never laugh at a stammerer. If you could for once put yourself in his place and feel the unutterable humiliation which he experiences, you would never again let the ghost of a smile cross your face when talking to one. When I have gone into shops or offices and, whilst striving hard to make myself intelligible, have seen the clerks or assistants grinning as though they thought it fine fun, it has sometimes been very difficult to restrain myself from 'going for them' and administering a salu- tary lesson. â€”From Cassell's Family Magazine for February.
