POETRY. YESTERDAY. Yesterday is dead And lies at rest. No breathing stirs The white-robed breast; The groans and sobbing Are hushed at last, Thanks be to Heaven! Such pains are past. Seek not to rouse Its unquiet ghost; Conjure no phantom Of what is lost; Come away softly And make no moan, Leaving thy perished hope Dead and alone. â€”Zoe Dana Underhill in Scribner's.
