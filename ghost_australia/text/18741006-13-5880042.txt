MR. F/ÃœTUERSTONHAUGim SER' MON. TO THE EDITOR Of THE ARGUS. SIR-I am glad to gather from the many utterances of the hey Mr Fetherstonhaugh, as reported in Saturday's issue, a tendency to drive right at the centre of that which separates earnest men on both sides of the religious question As long as that doctrine of eternal punishment Btures men in the face, there must over be a terror of free expression of genuine thoughts frequently I have been impressed with your denunciations, Snob the so called intolerance of orthodoxy ', and from your standpoint it, no doubt must seem absurd that men should insist so strongly on their views of the Sabbath and of other matters But excellence of life is not the final end of most modem (.biiBtuiinty The object is to save souls from hell, and who can wonder at is Let us consider the doctrine for a moment The majority of men are walking without forgive- ness, and though we are forbidden to decide as to any particular case, we are tacitly to admit the grave conclusion that the majority of men are damned This means the extreme torture of fire for-not a year, not a thousand years not ten millions of years but for eternity). I profess not to believe this but I say let no one sneer at a belief hold it is sad to say, by millions of their fellow creatures Some divines, indeed, say that they look on the expressions in Scripture as figurative, but add consoling!), " if the figure in so dreadful, how terrible the reality 1' Granting, however, that man) sincere men hold the doctrine, is it so hard to conceive why they should reckless) disregard the charge of illiberality and intolerant e, and hook by any means to save a soul The following lines, which I have found in a hymn took, 1 Nothing is worth a thought beneath, But how I may escape the death, That never, never dies should not seem poetical exaggeration to a man who professes to believe this, the most awful dogma over propounded The real many el is that a Birnie over crosses the face of believers damnation See that clergy man who benignly discourses some bright Sabbath morning on the excellence of the Christian character He wishes to move " by love ' as much as possible " It is to ne," he will sigh, "men will refuse the wondrous mercy of the Creator, ' but he does not like to dwell on the consequences The congregation separates, and the good man goes home to his dinner ' A kind of happy animalism possesses men, also how account for this calmness on such a subject' There is a kind of belief which under certain circumstances only will exist. Take that vigorous man who, in the clear sunlight, laughs at ghost stones and place lumY' at noon of night" in the churchyard and alone -he will tremble Shall I show, by a recent matter of fact, the natural effects of the doe tune if lightly realised ' With great pain of mind, I transcribe from 2Vic Arthur of rob many 10 part of an account of a man who killed his three children and then himself The following are portions of a letter, copied the trains., Written by the wretched man, and found on a table in the house - ' To the People of Bung Bong -Kind 1 neilds Thinking it would be best to say a few words about what I am going to do. First there is nothing I want to live for, so I am going to die Second if it be true, as most Christians would have us believe there are very few adults will ever got to heaven, Perhaps the chances are 1,000 to 1 If it be so, I think it a crime to try to bring more into the world or state where the odds are so much against them There is one bright side to this dark picture, that is all children will go to heaven (so, for love, I am going to send three). as for myself, expect to go to the same place Thirdly, of nature did not take its COHIBO, I feel that my time would be short, and do not want to leave my children " This is enough Study here is a ne pins vista of human tragedy Yet look at the matter calmly, and say, granting the pro- mises, is the conclusion so very) extravagant ' ' Oh," says one, this man at tod both foolishly and wickedly , w o should leave the state of the unsaved to an all wise God: faith banishes such terrors " Tell me, will your faith valley into the torments of those you believe to be an eternal burnings I do not argue the truth or falsehood of the doctrine The question is, Is the belief held Lot there be no paltering in the matter Here is no room for the proprieties Which of the two deserves more credit after all, that man who endure to be called bigoted and narrow minded, fornetingoiithis belief to the extent of his power of he who professing to hold this doctrine jet gains the reputation of huge mindedness and liberality for not alluding to it I feel convinced that many hesitate to express then line ideas in the fear that they may possibly be wrong and that some poor soul may by their misguiding be led to dest i at ion What I desire is, that the whole matter should he thoroughly sifted by all honest men, for it is clear that at present the doctor nie cannot be dimly held, even by those who profess to prove its reasonableness -I am, "c , EARNEST. TO THE rDHOrt OF THE AIKIDS Sir-Your reviews of the Rev C retlior Btonhnuglisseimon, which gave such offence to the worth) dean, was not overlooked by that little body worshipping in the Unitarian Church 1 Eastern hill on Sunday last The fair preacher directed the attention of her terrors to the ROI men in question, and referred in glowing terms to the author as one who had the moral courage to say what he believed,' although she predicted the _o Rule would be his severance from the church to which he belonged Probably the lady had an eye to the reverend gentleman one day preaching from the pulpit now so ably filled by her By way of practically testing the feelings of her songs legation, several copies of the season were offered for sale at the church door in the morning and readily disposed of and not a ton was to be had in the evening -Yolll 8, iX-0 Oct. 6.
