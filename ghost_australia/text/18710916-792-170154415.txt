CROWNING BOLLINGER FOR HIS PROTESTANTISK. So the University of Oxford lias given Dr. Yon Dollinger the Doctor's Degree. They might have done so long before, for the religious and scientific activity of this man. That they do it at present everybody sees the reason in the lasS events, and the question is if it is in accordance with the dignity of the University to promote a man because his Church has excommunicated him • or, better said, because in his old age he has lost his head. At least, so judges the Protestant and democratic .paper the Frankfurter Zeitung. It contains the following words : —" Dollinger has rejected the dogma of Infallibility. I admit that he knew what he did. I admit, also, that lie is convinced of the opposed doctrine. But what are the inevitable consequences of this refusal ? If the Pope is not infallible, the General Council which has decreed it cannot any more be infallible. Hence thedoctrine of the Church is not any more infallible. And therefore the Church has not the assistance of the Holy Ghost; everything which she teaches, declares, and commands, is purely human, and has, therefore, no value before Go-1 and in conscience. So fall by turns the au- thority of the Church and all privileged ecclesiastical orders, and there only remains the Christianism of the Bible or Protestantism. Dollinger has rejected the Infallibility to remain consistent with himself, he must abandon the Church and become Protestant. Has he been able to see this consequence-?—No. Will he see it some day ?—No. This aged mnn, has he only lived so long to see one word spoken in the interests of Liberalism procure him more reputation than everything he has produced with so much trouble and labour in the domain of the intellect ? Ha9 he only, during fifty years, collected so much material, useful for the defence of the Church, to fall at the end of his career on a stone, hurting himself amidst the applause of Liberalism ? Has he always been considered the first learned Catholic of Germany, only to be praised at the end of his life by Protestants, Jews, and Infidels ? . . . Liberalism has seized hold of him and will not let him loose." What have the Protestant journals of this country, who attacked the Archbishop of Munich BO furiously for excommunicating Dr. Dollinger, to oppose to the inexorable logic of this Protestant journal, according to which Dr. Dollinger has only excommunicated himself ? It is true they have lately preserved a complete silence in his regard ; but would it not be better ami nobler to retract the false accusation ? Is it in harmony with the spirit of the Gospel to reriletlie Catholic Church and its authority, and when the falsehood has become apparent, to leave the reader in error and in a state of passion, artificially enkindled against a Christian confession, and against fellow citizens, members of the same.— Westminster Gazette. ? ? OUR CHARITABLE IKSTITUTIONS.—A return has been produced at a meeting of the Benevolent Asylum committee showing the cost per head of the inmates for the year 1870 of various charitable institutions of the colony, and the average number of inmates in those institutions during that year.
