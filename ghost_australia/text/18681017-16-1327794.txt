THE MILLER'S REVENGE. IN TWO PARTS. ART I. There are few places within an easy win of home at which a brief holiday may be more pleasantly and profitably spent than at Jersey Both Guernsey and Sark are well worth visit him, but Jersey is pre-eminently the queen of the Channel Island group, both on account of its size and its many natural beauties It may be "done" comfortably in a week, after the ordinary skimming fashion of modern tourists , but to learn to love it thoroughly one must reside on it for months, and see it in storm and sunshine, and in all the varying moods which it puts on, like a beautiful, change ful woman. It was my fortune recently to spend part of my annual holiday on the island It was not my first visit, and all the chief points of attrac- tion were already familiar to me On this occasion I determined to explore some of its hidden nooks on foot, and to familiarise myself with its more homely features, while striving to gather some idea of the modes of life and habits of thought of the scattered dwellers in its bays and Valleys In one of my rambles I fell in with a gentleman, in artist by profession, who was engaged in painting one of the many romantic head- lands which diversify the northern seaboard of the island. He had lived for several years at St Helier's when a boy, and he seemed to know to heart every legend and romantic incident with which the history of the island, true and fabulous, is associated It was from his lips that I heard the following story, which is here told rascally as possible in his own words We were lounging on a hill side, cigar in mouth, watching the stealthy incoming of a summer tide, and the time was the last half hour that usually follows an outdoor luncheon " Rather a curious story " (began my painter friend) " attaches to that ruined water mill, of which you made mention this morning as form ing a likely subject for a pencil sketch and oh I know you have a slight craze on the subject of folk lore and the additional tales, I don't mind telling you this one Not, however, till you have tapped that black board in the corner Thanks Now for our once upon a time " The once upon a time, in this case, stands for seven as years less than a hundred The exact number, however, is not known to do potent, and matters nothing to the story At that time the Mill of La Roquette such was the name by which it was known as in good working order, and did as flourishing a business as any mill on the island The miller's name was Pierce Lebrun He was a widower, and well and danced in years He was assisted in his business by his nephew Gaspard, a young man man of five and twenty, who had come over from Coutances, in Normandy, when quite a lad, and had grown up under his uncle's roof After his wife's death, no woman was ever known to enter Lebiun'B cottage Iimdo the house and out, everything was done by the miller and his nephew The two were well matched Avarice, and that low cunning which delights in over teaching a neighbor, and spend- ing a shilling to gain a fal thing by backers, were their chief characteristics To give them then due, they were hard working men, and what they did was always done well and to the time, so that the huge wheel (for the mill was worked by water power was seldom idle for want of something to do The mill and the house in which the miller lived, were both under one roof, and together composed only four rooms two being used for business purposes, one and hung room kitchen and parlor to gether , while in the loft over the latter the miller and his nephew slept Behind the mill was a rough stable and outhouse, in which the miller kept a patriarchal horse, and a cart so old that it was popularly supposed to have been built during the reign of Lobrun's great grandfather, who had been the first miller of La Roquette "No one-year went by after another without weaving any thread of variety into the woof of the dull, colorless life led by the two men at the mill, except that Lebrun's hair was gradually turning as white as his own flour, and that Slooim Gaspard was growing, if possible, more gloomy and taciturn than ever They were both men of few words, and perhaps that was one reason why they agreed so well together " You know the situation of the wall, that it was built in a warm fold of the hills, in a little valley of its own, but still high enough above the sandy beach to afford its inmates a grand view seaward In the foreground the most prominent object was yonder reef of treacherous rocks, against which, even in calmest weather, the fretting Udo bursts in showers of spray Not that Lebrun or his nephew cared one farthing for the view, or would have expressed the least regret if a high wall had been built up between them and it, and shut out the prospect for ever " Pierre Lebrun was an early riser. On going into the mill soon after daybreak on a certain autumn morning, he was stupefied to find a sack of flour, which he could have sworn that he had tied up over-night, ready for sending home, now standing untied and open-mouthed, having evidently been disturbed by some one since the miller bad last set eyes upon it. Le Brun's first glance was to the outer door, but the stout wooden bar with which it was always secured was still in its place. He himself had but just unbolted the door of communication between the mill and the house ; and the one small window, by means of which the lower storey was dimly lighted, was set high up in the wall, and barred with iron. As Lobrun's slow mind mastered these facts one by one, he burst into a cold sweat, and looked fearfully around No ordinary human being could have got at the sack to untie it is ergo, it must have been united by the agency of witchcraft. Such was the first thought that evolved itself out of the miller's mind. As he stood there, in the ghostly grey of the early morning, it did seem to him quite possible that some power more than human might be granted to those who had sold themselves to the Evil One and that he was the victim of a malignant trick, which had its origin in some such compact. " He took a step forward, and peered closely into the open sack, and then he started back in dismay. The Back had not merely been opened, but some portion of the contents had been stolen : quantity of flour had been scooped out, probably by a handful at a time, the mark of four outspread fingers being still plainly visible on the surface of what was left. In an instant, the witchcraft theory was brushed like a cobweb from the miller's matter-of-fact brain. A thief, and a merely human thief, had been at work on his premises during the past night His pocket was touched, and that was enough to rouse his worst passions "'Gaspard Gaspard' he called out, hoarsely, ' make haste hither ' " There was something in the old man's voice that brought Gaspard at once, half dressed as he was Yes, my uncle, here I am,' he said : Who has touched this sack has thou ? Who has taken of the contents Whilst thou ?' demanded the old man, fiercely as he pointed, with a quivering finger, to his violated property "'No, my uncle, certainly not I that you know sufficiently well without asking the question, answered the astonished Gaspard The two men spoke habitually in a patois of Norman French, although neither of them was at a loss to express himself in English when the necessities of the case required that he should do so " 'Who, then, has touched it? and whoroiB the thief'' asked Lobrun, as with glaring eyes he gripped his nephew by the w st " Gaspatd shook his head, and gazed help lessly mound If his uncle a superior wisdom was at fault in the matter, how was it likely that he, a comparative ignoramus, could tin on any light upon it " Neither could Piano Lobiun himself, as it turned out throw any light upon the matter The premises were thoroughly searched for some traces of the thief, but, for once, the miller's low cunning was completely at fault, and he went to bed that night a morose and baffled man The one point of the case that puzzled both uncle and nephew was as to how the thief had obtained both ingress and egress, without in the least interfering with other window 01 doors It was a point that those sleep, except in brief, weary snatches horn the piston of Pietro Lobiun If it was possible thus to enter his mill without his cognizance of the mode by which such entry was effected, what portion of his property could be considered safe from do production? Evidently none Even life itself was hardly secure under such circumstances "Next morning it was a great relief to find that nothing had been touched during the night Several more mornings came and went, with a like result It seemed as if the my step sons and niGht visitor has satisfied himself, or herself with one visit to the mill Piano Lobiun began to recover his spirits, and even ventured to joke gumly with his nephew about his loss, saying that it must have been the devil him self and he alone, who had paid them a visit, being doubtless, in want of a little flour for his next batch of leaves "A week or ten days had passed vi hen, one morning, Gnspaid heard himself called again His uncle, with a face as white as his own (lorry, was standing, with straining eyes and fingers nervously entered mod " ' Look ' look ' mon enfant '' he said, in low hoarse accounts The foul fiend has been here again while we slept If this goes on I shall be a mined man " As on the previous occasion, a sack of dom had been opened, and part of the contents abstracted This time the thief had to tied the mouth of the sack, but in such a clumsy fashion that the miller's Sharp eyes had at once detected the imposition As before, the thief had come and gone, in spite of tho bolts and bars with which the mill had been Boomed over night The mystery was thickening, and Piano Lobiun was nearly at his wits' end he was an uneducated man, and consequently, to a certain extent, a superstitious man. He had a lurking faith in ghosts and witch craft, but for all that, the theory of super natural agency, as connected with the loss of his flour, had no tangible resting place in his mind He was too practical he had too much of that common sense which is so very common to seriously harbor such an idea for long No , the thief who had stolen his property was, in without doubt, a common place thief enough, quite reasonable to imprisonment and hard labor if caught and corn lated But the maxim of Mrs Glasse holds equally good with thieves as with hares the first requisite is to catch them " But the hero that Pierre Lebrun longed to catch was evidently a very slippery animal, and the question What sort of trap ought to be set? was one that began to trouble miller's mind to the almost entire exclusion of every other thought, and one which he could by no means decide to his own satisfaction And so several days and nights passed quietly away without action of any kind being taken by the miller Then, one morning, Gaspard was, for the third time, summoned by his uncle for the third time Pietro Lebrun had been robbed of a small quantity of flour and for the third time the thief had got clear away, without leaving anything behind by which he could be traced " The miller was furious. He stormed and raved about the mill, making use of anything but exemplary language ' Look here, little one,' he said at last to his nephew, ' one way or another, this sort of thing must be brought to an end. I will watch in the mill with my big pistol, and will either shoot the thief or catch him next time he comes. In one, two, three, four nights it will be time enough for me to begin my watch. He I had I will shoot Monsieur lo Farceur. Ho shall amuse himself at my expense never again.' " As Lebrun had decided, so he acted. On the fourth night after the third robbery he sent Gaspard to bed at his usual hour and then, having fastened up the little establishment in the customary way, he ensconced himself behind a bundle of empty sacks in one corner of the mill, armed with a huge old horse- pistol, into which he had crammed a couple of bullets, and twice as much powder as was necessary, and which, should an occasion for using it arise, was rather more likely to explode than to go off properly. Lebrun had also with him a small dark lantern. " For three consecutive nights the miller watched and waited, with the fierce patience of an old fox for the coming of his prey 2 and for three nights his waiting was in vain. On the fourth night, Lebrun was alone in the mill, Gas- pard having gone to Rozel late in the afternoon with a load of flour, and with instructions to stay all night at Rozel, and return early next morning with a load of corn, which a customer had promised to have ready for him by that time. " Grey, hook nosed, cunning-eyed old Pierre, had been dozing lightly in his lair, when, towards 2 o'clock in the morning, he heard something that caused him to prick up his cars, and brought back his scattered scenes with a shock. He took a firmer grasp of his pistol, saw that his dark lantern was ready to his hand, and raised himself noisolosBly on his knees The noise which he heard proceeded from the outside of the building, and could be caused only by some one who had no business in that remote spot at such an uncanny hour As already stated, the mill had but one window, or open mg, which was rather high up in the wall, and had two upright iron bars i mining across its inner side, as a security against thieves, but had no other framework and was left entirely in glazed From Lobrun's hiding place in the inner darkness of the mill, this window showed like a faint dIuo transparency against the bright starlight outside the noise ceased, and presently, to his intense astonishment, Lobiuu saw, first the head, next the shoulder s, and then the body of some unknown person, apparently of the feminine gender, come into view, bit by bit, as it cautiously ascended like a stage ghost rising through a trap door to slow music-till the whole body became visible, dimly outlined against the starlit sky, as it stepped noiselessly on to the window sill Lobiuu did not require to be told by what means the ledge had been gained Outside the mill, on two stout nails, hung a short ladder, of which he made use in many ways, but to night had seen it put to a service for which its owner had never intended it, and Lebrun simmered with wings as this fact made itself apparent to his dull wits " But his Iago was largely mingled with sea prison-house saw the figure, after passing itself for ahtllowhilo ma stoned attitude on the lodge, as if waiting to assure itself that all was quiet in the null, begin to squeeze itself, inch by inch, through the narrow aperture between the bin a ' I wouldn't Amy of bone vod that anything over a child of twelve could have made its way through that opening,' whispered Lobiuu to himself. It was easy enough for the figure to got its head through the bars, but it seemed to Black at the shoulders for full two minutes, and Lobi un laughed a silent sardonic laugh, and nodded his head grimly, feeling certain that the thief was caught in a 6 hp But a little perseverance overcome the difficulty, as it had doubtless done on previous occasions Then a push, a wriggle, and twist, and the intruder was inside the mill Lobiun's shaggy blows came down over his darkling eyes at this, and he ground his teeth like a man in a fit. " ' What was the intruder- a child of a woman ?' was the question that I obtain now put to himself If the latter, she must belong to a diminutive race no woman of ordinary size could have squeezed herself through so narrow an aperture But whether woman 01 child, there could no longer be any doubt as to how felonious intentions As soon as she was fairly inside, she leaped lightly from the window sill on to a number of piled up sacks of grain, and then slid to the ground Stopping across the floor, almost as lightly as a cat could have done, and blushing close by Lcbiuii in his hiding place, she made her way, like one to whom the place was familiar, to where some tied up sacks of flour stood ready for delivery What hour after movements might mo, Lobrun could only guess not If he guessed that at that very mo- ment his float was being stolen, he would pick ably not be far from the truth " He was very impatient by this time, but he had not long to wait In five minutes at the most from the time the figure brushed past him, it came gliding back again on in a way to the window. He could just therein it by its being a shade blacker than the blackness that filled the inside of the mill As it was in the act of pUSSlng Illili, ho put, out my son LanU gripped it firmly by the shoulder A woman's shriek, loud and small, but over in a moment, a savage bite with sharp teeth that met in the fleshy part of his hand, a loud curse from the smaller as his fingers let go their grip and next moment, as it seemed, the I creature he had been holding. had scrambled back to the window, and was clinging to the I bars like an infuriated tiger cat But before she was stopped Before she had got more than one arm through, the flush of Lebrun's lantern I Bmoto lies dazzled eyes, and his deep, harsh tones fell on her head like the accounts of doors " ' Come down this instant, or I will blow out your brains " Stillchugiiig to the bars with both hands, she turned over one shoulder a white face, and eyes dozed and full of despair She hesitated, and the same terrible throat, Cooper and harsher than before, echoed through her brain and there was something in the voice of the man who uttered it that told her it would not lack fulfilment The bars seemed to be drawn out of her fingers, rather than her fingers to quit their hold of the bars, and, with a faint cry for money, she fell back, a shivering, frightened heap, on to the piled up sacks " [CONCLUDED IN OUR NEW ]
