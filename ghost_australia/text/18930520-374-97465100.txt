THE ART OF CHARMING. A man says that) a woman to be clever at conversation mast hare a good memory. She must keep in mind so much as she knows of the tastes and prejudices of those present. If So-and-so's brother fought in the Egypt ian war, if such a one has Scotch ancestry, if such another had a dear friend or an) aunt or something who went on the sta|r%'if! such another has written a poem on " Mor-' tality," and has opinions on immortality, and so ont of each and all she must remem ber. And " As you said the other day " is a good way to introduce a pungent remark; or, "As your favourite author has it," which shows a flattering regard for one's preferences. All these tricks, if you call them so, must be studied. Don't try to make a man think how clever you are. Make him think how < clever he is. Brighten him up. Lead him on to say witty things. You may even coax j him up to a joke, be he as,glum as Pharoah'a ghost. . Remind-bim of clever things he said i â€¢' the other day." Never mind if they are. inventions of your own. . Never mind if .he knows they are; so "'long ashe* does nob imagine that you know they are you are all right. Tell bright things about him. Ib won't take long to make him feel, especially if he is really a dull fellow, that he is a lo\ smarter than even he thought himself, and lie will correspondingly adore you. - A mail is apt to frizzle under the fire of ybur owi humour and wit and brightness, and, of coarse, a man is never comfortable vhen 'lu iriasUs. \- JToimu,
