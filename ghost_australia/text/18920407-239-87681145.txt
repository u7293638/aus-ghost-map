"ut lebh15h 'Tree has bid the deal bones live, and th.Ones5 of Shdcesjeavo are appeased. There was It snisndid first night atidience iu the Haifymarket on th# Talatiy the play openeh. Mr. Tree grasps the utlstly of the rdhe aduntrably, HamleRts underlying lot ort Ophelia is beautifully accentuated by tone aud glnnce. The house as moved ar masse at the end of the second act, when bending over his tablets by the red fire, Ihamlet cries, "The Ilay's tile thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience o the king." I1 the fifth act the churchyard is a spring parterre of blooms, a new rendering, and thither Hamlet returns to Ophelia's grave. The fencing scene with La?rtes is a magnificent piece of intellectunal grasp, shown in the actor's expression and acting when hel looks barleos in the eye and reads his treachery. Then again, MIr. Tree's subtlety shows its power. Mrs. Tree makes a charming Oiphelia, delicately as well as strongly given. Mr. Arthl r Dacre, as HIoratio, also secured a triumlpll, and lMr. FerIandeZ, as Ghost, and Mr. Fred Terry as Laertc?s were geenrally successful.
