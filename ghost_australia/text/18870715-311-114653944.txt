Ten days ago I the man who In an engine driver, over ran { his points and th3 engine left the rails. I - had a board appointed to inquire into the j matter, and that board had the case before I them on Thursday lasts. Now, this man has J a bad record, he has "had four oharges j against him, and in my mind, I believe that j he has got up this agitation in order if' possible to affect the decision in his case, and j get him out of the sorape." Mr Smith does j not hesitate to give this as his own belief,] but of course he points out that he has no- ( thing by which to corroborate the idea. No j doubt however, this will be one bf the points ! whioh will command the attention, searching I inquiiy, and distinct reply of the Association at their adjourned meeting on Friday even-j lug.
