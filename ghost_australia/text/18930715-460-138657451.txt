ORIGINAL POETRY. THE CONFESSION. Through the ivon- gate and golden That lead* to the land of dreams, Where nothing is that happens, And all is real that seems: Through that ivory gate and golden I passed aith my love last night, When the mystic moonbeams vanquished Day'B lingering bands of light. " O, lore, art thon mine for ever, Dear love, who art mine to-day 7 Can nothing chinge thee, sweetheart, And turn thy love away 7" As we walked in the scented garden, Where alone the fairies dwell, Where amaranth is blooming, And deathless asphodel, We built our fairy palace Too fanciful to tell, For our hearts were knit together. And wrought heath a fairy spell. " O, sweet, are we one for ever Who are one in will to-day 7 Can naught us two dissever, Or scare our love away 7" Then, within the garden shadows There loomed a deeper shade— A spirit dark to part us— The lover from the maid. Twas the ghost of vanished yean forlorn, For my love was young and sweet, But the heart I brought was soiled and torn, Though I laid it at her feet. " No, dear, I am thine for ever," She sighed as we turned awsy; " The past shall part us never Who lire and love today." J. H. LATBOBE BATEMAN.
