MR. MASON'S CANDIDATURE. TO THE. EDITOR. SRIn-Kindly -allow me space in year columns for the following :-I swent down to Mr, Mason's meeting at the Mechanics' Institute the other evening, and expected to hear his political views. In commenc ing, after being introduced hy the chair man, he said he had come before us again, and would proceed to give nos his political views: Well, I waited very patiently until after 9 o'clock, and I did not hear anv thing but a tirade of abuse against the Traralgen . Farmers' Association, and pointedly to Mr. Drafin, who is an entire stranger to ume. He (Mr. Mason) calling them great little busyhodies, etc. I think, Mr. Editor, that Mr. Mason can afford to be genorous on this particular occasion, as his seat is pretty well sure to hhn. These little animosities at election times should be put on one side ; but that is a thing Mr. Mason can't do. At the last election It was the sante thing against Groom, and thiat is what dofoeated hit. If we had a good man against Mr. Mason now, lie (Mr. Mason) would not have the ghost of a show. Mr. Mason haid better make the most of his Parliatlnlalry caruer this titmtn, as lie will not get antotellr chance like this. \--'ours, etc., AN. ELECTORII,.
