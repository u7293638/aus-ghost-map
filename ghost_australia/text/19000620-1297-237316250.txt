A SPECTRE HAND. Tho ghosts which are said to frequent tho precincts of Hampton Court Palaco aro more or less known by reputation, but their rumblings have been promiscuous and uncertain. Great Interest In their movements bad. however, been newly aroused by the strange c.xporienco under gone by an artist who, during tho past week, has beon visiting certain rooms of tho palaco for tho purpose, of sketching the old Flemish tnpostry on the walls. ' Whilst engaged in th,o .Guard Watching Chamber In broad daylight — for the room is closed to the public at 0 o'clock — this gentleman, Mr, linynes, of Surblton,. positively assorts that a spectre hand, .white ant) delicate, and richly. Jewelled, has persistently \ Intruded botweon h.im and tho tapestry. At Jlrat he Imagined the disturbing clement must b? ono of the many hands so beautifully Inscribed on the tapestry, but tho limb, ho says, moved slowly from ono stage to another, and pointed down wards. Mr. Haynos was much agitated, and told several friends of this curious -visitation. They, not unnaturally, perhaps, advised him to dismiss tho subject from h.is mind, and return to the chamber and his work.. But the hand re-appear ed beforo bis startled oyos; and on tho' 'last' apf poaranoo of tlio phantom the' artist made b. hur ried' sketch of tho outstretched hand," the rough outline <of which depicts « brilliant marquise ring on tho forefinger. The effect of those con tinued visits of tho supernatural on Mr. I-Iayncs Is very visible; ho ls unnerved, nnd ho has sus pended his sketching.. Th,eso aro tho plain facts, but there is, it would a com, a weird and historic connection between'' this hand and the hand of the Queen Cathcrlno Howard, one. of .the -wives of King Henry VIII. — "Public.
