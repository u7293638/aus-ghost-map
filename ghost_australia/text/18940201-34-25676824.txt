AMUSEMENTS. "Storm and Sunshine" was again presented by the Norman-McLean Dramatic Company at the Theatre Royal on Wednesday evening, when it again met with an appreciative recep- tion at the hands of a fairly large audience. The season will only last for two nights longer, and it is hoped with the cooler weather that the attendances on both evenings will be more oommea?nrate with the merits of the per formance. The benefit performance to Mr. Walter Bentley, which is to be given at the Bijou Theatre on Friday evening, promises to be very successful, and considerable interest At taches to the first production in Adelaide of a dramatised version of Maxwell Grey's powerful novel" The Silence of Dean Maitiand." Mr. Walter Beatley will appear as the Dean and will be supported by representatives of the leading city and suburban amateur dramatic societies. Seats are being rapidly booked for the occasion, and early application for tickets is necessary. "The Battle of Waterloo" has last none of its attraction, and with the additional features of interest, the Ghost of Napoleon and the Enchanted Fountain, the Cyoforama bofldiog is proving one of the most popular resorts in Adelaida All Wednesday's sessions were well attended, and the Cyclorama, like the brook, seems destined to "go on for ever."
