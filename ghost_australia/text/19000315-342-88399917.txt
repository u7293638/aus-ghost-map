Sydney Week by Week. (From Ou! Special Correspondent.) SYDNEY, March 6. Last Wednesday was a public holi day3 and almost eAeiy shop was shut; so that employe! s and employees alike might turn out to bid farSwell to the Bushmen. ,The day. might have been finer, but the occasional slight show eis weie not sufficient to do much da mage to the di esses 6f th€ ladies, who had all donned their hohday attne. The trdops weie timed to leave the bai racks at 1 30 p.m., but hours before all the best points of vantage were occupied. Owne'is of balconies and \erandahs along the Loutc either invited then friends to seats theie, or Jet them out at s3 iiiuch a Mad, in some cases giv ing the pioceeds to the Patriotic Fund.

The American Life Office displayed Yanked flags, and ihe1 motto, 'Ameiica I salutes the bravg bushmen of Austia- 1 lia,' and outside the Mutual Stores j we're a lion and her cub (Biitani and j Australia), both, by some mechaflical arrangement, vigoiously wagging their heads. Flag- floated in the bieeze everywheiej and all available positions w€re densely packed with enthusiastic crowds, e\ en the verandahs of the Syd ney hospital were' tlnbngecl with the fiurses arid their patients,some of whom had bee'n lifted out bn stretchers to se'e the procession pass, and all along tho hne_ cheers and patnotic songs, ahd wa\ing of handkerchiefs and liats, gieeted the bushmen and the tioops who accompanied them.

It was ac counted for by Ihe fact that the un le vSloped plate had been used befoie, so that, when the second picruie v.cis taken, the figure of the ' lieutenant, whose portrait had been taken on the plate previously, was lepjoduced on the second pictiirje. The photogia phic journal some time ago published a series of these ghost pictures. * Xflk~ ing the sad circumstances together, this photograph should have a pecu liar mteiest for the members of the family of l the brother -and sister. ^ »' -_ * # # * * The war has given all-soits and con--, ditions of parsons'- grand dppcrtunities. for sensational sermons, ana ^ choirs, have been singing 'God Save ihe Queen'' and' 'On to the Wai*' m jlie, churches.

It happened that iione' df the retlHilg aldermen were op posed, so that theV ware all formally de clared re-elected on tebruaiy 6. .they did hot, howe\er, meet io 6lect a IVmor ^.mtil the 15th— some days beyond the limit stated in the Act, and nort the al deimen find themselves in this linitjuc position that to elect one of themselves now as Mayor would be illegal, and any peison so acting would be liable to a heavy penalty. Strange to so.} , the j Municipal Act piovides no means or le medying this state of things, and legal opinions say that the only potsiblfe wav out of thd difficulty will be td pass a special Act of Parliament. . In the meantime the Council has fao Mayor, and is not capable of doirif 'aliythirig, even to paying the ^al4nes df-thfi Coiin cil cleik and municipal officcis. Another proof that the Municipali- ties Act wants amending is afforded at Lambton. The Lambton Council owed the bank something like £12,000, which money has been spent on roads and public buildings for the improvement of the borough, and the bank couldn't get it back, or even the interest, so it sued the aldermen, and got a verdict. This dldn't help the bank, as they were still as far off getting the money as ever, so three of the aldermen have been arrested, and fined £10 each at the instance of the bank, for "disobey- ing an order of the Court," and as they won't pay the fines even are now in gaol. An application for their re- lease is being made to the Full Court, but from the remarks made by the Jud- ges during the hearing it is doubtful whether the application will be success- ful, as if these aldermen are liberated, other municipalities may copy Lamb- bilties. A municipality can't file its schedule like an individual, as a co- poration has no body to be kicked, and no soul to be damned. So the pro- bability is the aldermen will have to pay their fines or remain in gaol. * 4'; :'._. ? *. : ???*' ? :'*-: ??'?? :):' A Sydney S\indayV; pap&has; the ;tbU lowing advemsenietjt :;; 'Missing a Young G o vern 0 1: :;a.tisyvers to the ;, name df Birthstains.:^V^vlast,heardj of '-in X.
