THE SIN OF OMISSION. IT isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone Which gives you a bit of a heartache At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of heartome counsel You were hnrried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That you had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, These chances to be angels Which even mortals find They come in night and silence, Each chill. repreachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To sufer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives yon the bitter heartache. At the setting of the sun.
