A HAUNTED HOUSE. London May fair in a rccent issue .thus recurs to the " Mystery of Berkeley- Square." The mystery of Berkeley Square still remains a mystery. We were in hopes that during the last fortnight a full, -final and satisfactory answer .would have been given to our question, but we have been disappointed. Tbe story of the haunted house in the heart of Mayfair is so far acquiesced in by the silence of those who know the whole truth, ami whose interest it is the whole truth should be known. That story can be recapitulated in few wordB. The house iu Berkeley Square contains'at least one room or which the atmosphere is supernaturally fatal to body and mind. A girl saw, heard, or felt, such horror in it that she went mad, and never recovered sanity enough to. tell bow or why. A gentleman, a disbeliever iu ghosts, dared to sleep in it, and was found a corpse in the middle of the room alter .frantically ringing for help in vain. Kvunor suggests other cases ol the same kind, all ending in death, madness, or both, as th'e result of sleeping, or trying to sleep in thBt room. ThiB very party wallB of the house when touched are found saturated with electric horror. It is uninhabited, save by an'elderly man and woman who act as caretakers, but even these have access to the room. This is kept locked, the key being in the hands of a mysterious and seemingly nameless person, who comes to tbe house once every six months, locks up:the elderly couple in the basement, aud then unlocks the room, and occupies himself in it for hours. Finally, the house—though iu Berkeley Square—is neither to be let nor sold. Its —iere outside shows.it to be given up to decay.
