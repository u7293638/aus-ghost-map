LAND NATIONALISATION. TO THE 1SD1TOR. Sir— I am pleased to find your correspondent ' T. G. Bennett' is neither ignorant of Henry George's tenets nor of the wonderful advance that is being made towards bringing them into actual practice. A few short months ago it was said tbe George theories could never enter into practical politics. People forgot that we even then had a land tax ; small, it is true, but there, all tho same. I recognise 'T. G-. Bennett's' ghost in the land tax assessment, and for the report of the discussion on same which took place in Parliament last week, I beg to refer him to your issue of 1st inst. He will there see that, notwithstanding Sir John Downer's warning about its being tbe first step towards the carrying out of Henry George's scheme, Mr. Holder had a majority of seven. How about the ghost now? ' T. G. Bennett' thinks I might have gone farther in my last. I did not do so for fear of taking up too much of your valuable space; but for this I should have explained that all land nationalists want is justice for all* equal opportunities tor all ; and to obtain this we ask' that that particular element of nature which all use more or less, viz , the land, shall be treated as common property ; that is, that every person occupying land shall pay rent in the form of a tax to the State (the people) for the privilege granted him. The whole community being the State all would benefit by euch rents, As an instance of how we wish it -worked, take the following: — A farm, the present gelling value of which is £1,000, Deduct amount paid to Government for same, and present value of improvements thereon, say £800, leaving as available for taxation £200. This is the land value, and the only thing land nationalists wish to tax. — I am, &c;, LAND NATIONALIST. Adelaide, December 5, 1887.
