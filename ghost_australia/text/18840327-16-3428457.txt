NEW SOUTH WALES. [tntOM our OWN CORRESPONDENT.] SYDNEY, March 22. IN the Assembly, the two sitting days of the week (for practically we have lately been having no more than two have been devoted almost entirely to the Education Estimates The lob acco Duties Bill, which was billed to be improperly before the House has again been introduced read a second time, and passed through committee, and the Customs and the Necropolis Act Amendment Bills have passed through then last stages The House has also attenders read the Matrimonial Causes Act chiefly with the view of providing that, in a divorce case a sufficient number of years should be summoned to allow a co- respondent an opportunity of challenging jurymen But the pleasures named have caused little time 01 to double The only subject that has nita ested the House is that of our expenditure on education There is a very general feeling to the effect that this expenditure is becoming too heavy - the estimate for the present year 13 £710 000 and hopes have been entertained that the de- Stn ment., which for the moment is w without a Iimsta, and for which a Minister has not yet been selected, would afford an excellent op- portunity for beginning the great work of retrenchment 'thus far all such hopes have failed On Wednesday no less than ten motions were proposed for the reduction of sal 14 as the result of the whole being a saving of £100 the salary of a single messenger , of the ten motions nine were lost On Thursday the cheeseparing were a trifle more successful, but the sole result of the labours of the two long sittings is a saving of £3000 which is to be taken from the salaries of sowing mistresses A proposal has been made to drop the 7000 for high schools, and there are members who have ev ide need their willingness to vote for it. The item however will have to pass It is not by discussions on Estimates that the life. h schools, four of which are now at work, will be closed The Act says that the Minister may establish these schools, and if the House does not want the schools it will have to secure the passing of a bill to say that he may not The effect of the proposal in regard to the high schools is that the department shall not do what the Act expressly contemplates and authorises its doing Those who rood parliaments y debates will be apt to conclude that the educational policy of the last three years has a firmer hold on the mind of the country than it has on that of the Assembly For some days past politics in any shape has been of far less interest than aquatics The here of the hour is Hanlan, who arrived here last Saturday, and who had a reception worthy of a prince accorded to him on Monday, in its questions are-wileri, when, and against whom is the great sculler to pull The impression is that any race in which Hanlan may engage- will take place on the Nepean, and not on the Parramatta River, and that the only man who will have the shadow of a chance against the champion is Beach Hanlan himself inclines to the opinion that the greatest sculler 111 the Australias is still Trickett He says he would like to meet Trickett, but that he is prepared to meet anybody He has come here to row, and, if possible (for he does not disguise the fact), to make money He will row anywhere, or against any competitor, and wherever he rows he will row to win Hanlan as ranges his own matches, and 13 his own trainor Unless he receives he is neither to be sold nor to be bought Speculators it seems have been trying to take him in tow, but with no success In everybody's opinion the champion is straightforward and he is cor family modest and intelligent t He has little of the an men of the typical sportsman, whatever he may practise of his devices Ho as little enjoys the meeting of plaudits as the making, of speeches He does not seem to understand the fuss of which he is the occasion and it must be acknowledged that the presence of the great sculler has sent the people of Sydney a little off the heads As well as being fl utter ed by the public, he has been honoured by the Minister, by the mayor, and oddly enough by the sha iii Of Haitian s abilities and tastes, the last named gentleman has evidently an exalted opinion At the II main lines on on Wednesday the sha iff, instead of (lincoln sing on sports, day com sed on business for Haitians benefit he told how many sheep and cattle we have, how many bushels of w hint we grow, and how many miles of railway there are in operation in these war is the aim off if he did not show the baldness of his head demonstrated the kindness of his heart Matta of fact people me getting a ti tile impatient at the homage which is being laid to II mind but such people for got that in any department of skill and energy it is something to be the best man in the world in a department to which British sportsmen have always marched importance there scr truth does not seem to be a second Hanlan If Html in has come to tell us how highly he is delighted! wt time a number of new or mars just now wh i ii awaiting us how grievously they have been disappointed 1 The immigrants by the stc ship it in nick are complaining n ty bitterly of tin deci potion of which they felt themselves to be the victims The War nick is one of the Orient immigrant ships When the contract for the bringing of mum of arts by this line was made it was put dicted that there would be no more outbreaks of disc is on the voyage and onthepnitof the infinite into no more complaints on annul the prediction has not been fulfilled levi immigrants have come 1 used more loudly than those by the WA muck No less than three sets of curves have been for mutated and one of them has been signed by no less than seventy persons For some of the indictments there was not seem to have been much occasion. The trouble of one of the complain mix for example is not that he got too little food but that he got too much king in a mess of the number of five statute adults, in lines I have often seen more food brought to the nes, table for me than for a mess of double th a number line is a queer grimace, but it t, about as ser tons as the troubles of many of the new comers by the Win nick Of two things however, both the immigrants and the colony may justly complain the list is that the accommodation provided for Ihcmamed immigrants was less than decency limited, and the second that the n regular lties corn tinned of are traceable either to the indolent o or to the weakness of the represent Tutu is of the Agent General in London Accordingly the statement of the married men, not only wetetw woman led couples placed in one berth in which there was no screen of any kind but they were mixed with children in nurseries gained from that of infancy to that of 12 Worse than this, the vessel is said to have been allowed to have England after baling had reported as amongst her freight a cle a case of measles the consequence being an outline di of tin, malady, which lasted the entire voyage and which included no less than labours ninety enters The impression has been that it is the business of the Agent General to see that the immigrants are all healthy, and that the accommodation provided is decent and ample That impression, it would now seem is not a correct one We are told that Mr. Phillips the agent, left the fitting up of the H ai wick to the company. He was not satisfied with the arrangements but he did not presume to interfere He Agent General allowed the company to do prittVinuch as it pleased and so did the Board of trade lins strippers, is the free and easy way in which our representatives do business at home and the tion bls s of the immigrants by the NW warwick are the natural result an informal inquiry into the matters has been made on board the Warwick during the week, and in due time a report will be submitted Whatever the report may be there is not much question as to the facts or that the matter is one on which the Government will have to act promptly and to speak plainly Such a state of things as the one which was allowed to exist on board the Warwick cannot be good for the cr lou j, and in the long run it is not likely to prove good for the company to those who ex cited much from the Orient contract the stories told by those who have come by the second vessel miller the new system are a grievous disappointment The next new comer of any consequence for whom people are looking is the Primate The ship that will bring Bishop Barry to our shores is, due in Sydney in about a week hence From Colombo the Bishop has telegraphed to say that he will begin his work at once, and that he will begin by n zones of lectures in the Cathedral lothe authorities of the Church, however, the question for the moment is not what the Bishop will do for them when he annes Butchart will believe them to do for the Bishop It is agreed that the new Primate must be properly received but there is the greatest difference of opinion as to the reception that will be worthy of the occasion borne nie infavour of a public procession, from the wharf to the Cathedral It is believed that very influential persons are in favour of this idea The majority however, are against it. It is decided that there shall be no public landing and no p trading of the Bishop in the streets. A street procession, it is said iilthoiiL.li appropriate enough on the occasion of the arrival of an athlete, would hardly be the thing on that of the arrival of a Bishop, and particularly when the landing of the one follows so quickly on that of the other Then, as well as a suitable landing, there must be accorded to the Bishop a public reception of some kind or other after his arm at But it is easier to say that there must be a reception than to determine what form the reception should take there must, of course, be a thanksgiving service at the Cathedral, as to that time no difference of opinion But as well as a Divine j service there must be a human entertainment of some kind and that starts another difficulty Suppose it is agreed that the entertainment shall be a luncheon, the question arises What kind of a luncheon ought it to be' Should it be cold, for example, or hot and, if that point be settled, it remains to be asked who shall be invited or permitted to be present Shall there be ladies and gentlemen, or must there be gentlemen only ' When the question of who may be present is settled, that of the terms on which people are to be admitted next presents itself lhcsoaicnot the questions that are troubling Bishop Barry, but they are those that are engaging the attention of a great many of the men with whom he will have to work. The logic of events will of course settle everything, meanwhile the points stated are relegated to a committee who, if they do not prove themselves different from committees generally, will do as much to spoil the reception of the Bishop as to make it a success Whenever the Bishop may reach us he will certainly not come before he is wanted The criminal records of the last few weeks open up a fine subject for the content station, as well as a wide field for the energies of a Christian Bishop Seldom if ever has our criminal list been so long and so black, and as to the two great crimes of which so much has been heard the perpetrators of these are still and are likely to remain at large On Monday the lad Williams was found guilty of his share of the Woolloomooloo tragedy but on Tuesday his fellow prisoners were all discharged The evidence that failed against the rest would have failed against Williams had he not been convicted out of his own mouth At his former examination, although protesting that he was not guilty of murder, he admitted that he was a party to the assault On this admission it was that the Crown relied, and as in the second instance Williams was tried alone, the admission made a conviction inevitable Had Williams held his tongue instead of being in a felon s cell to day he might have been driving his horses in Woolloomooloo The Chief Justice warned the jury of the danger of trusting to the uncorroborated evidence of informers On this point it seems to some people his Honour is a trifle unreasonable Had the testimony of the informers, Smith and Kingsbury been believed, the issue of the two trials would have been a widely different one As it is, the perpetrator of the Woolloomooloo and Water on tragedies are still abroad The police have failed to find them, and it now remains to be seen whether anything can be done by the clergy A short time back the world was assured that the remedy for the criminal classes was in the hands of the Salvation Army In Sydney, however, that ostentatious community seems to be quite as eager for self glorification as for the reformation of society On Tuesday last the army opened a barracks in one of the suburbs of Sydney and at the service on the occasion the people were told that the building was dedicated in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost, and of General William Booth Nobody supposes that this was intended to be blasphemous, but there is an impression that leading Salvationists are quite as anxious to blow their own trumpets as to sound the of raises of the Deity In some directions there are very serious complaints as to the manner in which these people lift up their voices in the streets On Thursday night Mr Jeffries declared that, so far as his church was concerned the army nurses is too much for Christian patience People may be wrong Mankind has not always sense enough to know its benefactors, but there is a shrewd impression that the wicked world has not a great deal to expect from the noble array of Salvationists
