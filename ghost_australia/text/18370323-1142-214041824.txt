To the Editor of the " Guardian" MR EDITOR,— As this appears the season for the fitting on of Caps, permit me to paint the character of an Individual amongst us. I think Virgil well expresses him, where allusion is made to those well behaved Ghosts that Æneas met with "Friends to talk with, Men to look on," but if grasped at, only air. He is one that lies kindly to you, and tis discourtesey if you to believe him ; his words are but so many fine promises set together, serving equally for all and equally to no purpose ; each fresh encouter with man puts him to the same post again, and he goes ever to you what he said to him; he leads to suppose he is at your command but you shall entreat of him nothing ! his proffers are universal and general, with excep- tions against all particulars. He will do any thing for you, but when urged to this, he can- not ; or to that he is engaged ; but still he will do any thing, promises he accounts but a kind of mannerly words, and in the expectation of your manners, not to exact or demand them : if you do, he wonders at your ill breeding, that cannot distinguish between what is spoken and what is meant. No man gives better satisfaction at the first, or comes off with greater eclat till you knew him better, and then you knew him for nothing, and commonly now, these men must rail at him, that brfore most commended him. The best, or rather worst is, he cozens you in a fair manner, and abuses you with great respect. VERITAS. P. S. Have we a brother Jonathan or Yankee the Colony to guess at the Hero meant.
