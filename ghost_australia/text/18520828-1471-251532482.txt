, ...... . , \ \ Thh Skpahaxiox and Pro Transportation Petition. — The . .petition for the . separation of- New England from the Middle , District, and junotion with Moreton Bay, baa been again taken abont the. town for the purpose of gaining signatures ; but I am happy in believing that when presented to the Council (if ever it reaohts that stage), some honorable and faoetious member will propose that it be laid under the table, and the consideration be postponed ad tnjinitvm. For I think that after all tbe influ ential persuasions that have been used towards its s uooe#8, it will only prove the ghost of a petition, and be very properly repudiated by every right thinking man who wishes to live amidst a community where .crime ib as little known as possible, considering the general frailty of tbe human race. I have no doubt the Government at home, whether.it be Whig. Tory, or Radical, will with the greatest pleasure accommodate the New England squatters wiih as many felons as they ask for ; nay, I oven think that philanthropy only will carry the .Home Government so far as to double or t'eble the number prayed for. But J must lay myself open to tbe charge of want of faith when I state, as my creed, that I do not believe they will give us a 'single virtuous and unstained emigrant i6 counter balance tbe amount of vice with which thev will so generous!? supply us.— \- Correspondent of Maitland Mereury.
