Original Poetry. ANNOT LYLE'S SONG. BY G. J. MACDONALD. "Shall I take the Harp? "Is—is the shadow falling upon you?" ANNOT LYLE—Vide Legend of Montrose. When from the west the weary sun declines, And ghost-like fogs float o'er the heath of green; When the wind grieveth through the gloomy pines, And the black raven seeks some bleak ravine; Then do thine eyes, dilated, seem to glare Upon the shadow-throng'd and phantom-peopled air. What ghastly vision-spectre strikes thy sight, That thy mind labours in such dread eclipse? Thy dirk is clench'd—thy brow grows dark as night; Revenge seems seated on those scornful lips, And thy rapt soul, in shadowy strife, I wist, Hunts thine ancestral foes—the "Children of the Mist." But when I touch my Clairschach's silver strings, And spirit- echoes interfuse the air, Then—as an unchained angel soars and sings, Charming to calm the darkness of despair, Doth music charm the shadow from thy brain, And thou returnest to the world of men again.
