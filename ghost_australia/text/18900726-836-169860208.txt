JACK PRICE: Only a Deck Hand, Ent He Gave His Life For Others. I suppose notonc in &. thousand ^ ill care to read adeck hand's story. People -call us coarse and vulgar. Granted ; bat our-work makes us so. There arc ladies, I fancy, who will shudder at the thought of such a btory, and gentlemen who will dip into it carefully, expecting to fiud a string of oaths. Judge for yourselves whether this talc of Jack Price, my . partner, is lit for refined earo. No need to .tell you of a deck hand's life. \\. man that beats about in the cold and rain, landling sleety ropes or balancing himself -n the .gunwale of a coal bargq with twenty :eet of swift water under him, is not apt to je a pretty, kid-gloved, soft-voiced fellow, [f his face is red it is because midwinter rinds on the Ohio are. not good for the com plexion. He deals with rough^ work and is rough . himself ; but his heart isju*t about is apt to be right as that of a member of Parliament or a judge. - ; : ? / . . We 'started from Pitishnrg-on. the George Hammond in' July, Jack and I. There wa3' 3 big river, and wc made good time to Louis ville, where we shipped on the Charley Roberts, bound for Orleans. To say ^ we fonnd it hot on tho Lower Mississippi gives no idea of the weather. Half the crew were unfit for duty. One morning there was a whispering fimong the bojs.i ' . 14 What's up, Jack?' said I. ? « Steve Robinson'-s down, with swarop fever.' The bojs gathered in a knot ; around the capstan. ..Before - long 'there was a panic amoDg them. The mate shook his head and. looked thoughtful. ' ^ .? ' The man must be put ashore,' said -the captain,. ? M No, sir I' cried Jack Price. u Who are you ?' ? 'Plain Jack Price; but Steve don't go ashore. It's an outrage to think of doing it.'**- . ?? . . .; *?: ' Who's-to nurse him ?' 'Mel' *uDo you know what swamp fever lfl t' uDoI knowanything?' .

'Not another mufls- . Steve's. state-room/*' ^ *' x-?» For. ten days Steve's room* was quaran/ tined. Nobody but Jack saw the inside of it. ?: ?? ; ' . ?. Wo saw, him. sometimes, carrying surae thing to tbe sick man or sitting on -the. guards. to get a breath of air ; )-ut every soul on the boat kept out of -bis way. We all liked Jack, but the fever might bo in his clothes. He began to look pale, but be never grumbled. * ; . „ One day the hews came out to us that Steve was dead. A few hours after we buried him on ah island in the river in a pine box, and the only, thing like a prayer said-over him wa3 from Jack : ^ ? «'God belphimr' ?The fever clid nob spread; and we all breathed freer, . . ' A faw evenings after Steve's dearth I was on watch at the head of the tow, and was with me. Wc were puffing at^l^ng J keep off the mosquitoes.
