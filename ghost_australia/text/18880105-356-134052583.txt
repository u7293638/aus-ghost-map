TIIE GI[OST A'r BUNGAY. TIu .3ancnslg Times is entirely respon sible for the following: The appari tion which caused a good deal of ex citement a few months ago at Bungay, has again made its appearance--so we learn from a creditable source. an old and much respected resident of Bungay (Mr. R. Cameron) was riding home from Wingham a few evenings ago, when a man dressed in black, ivearing a high hat, and riding a black horse, rode up to him, and gave a groan. Mr. Cameron was a bit unnerved, and asked, "Who is getting murdered ?" The horse man is said to have given a heavy moan, and disappeared over a precipice of about 15 feet. lMr. Camoron's horse was frightened, and bolted through the bush. Three nights later, Mr. 3. Cameron (son of the former) was" riding home by the same route, and met with a like experience, when his horse also bolted. The horses cannot now lo got past the haunted spot. Mr. Cameron inspected the placewhere the strange being disap peared over tho precipice, but no traces of a horse's hoofs were visible. Tlis intelligence has boon received with amazement bymany on the UTpper Manning, as Mr. Camoron is too well known to be suspected of concocting a story lilke the above, and too sensible to be frightened by a will-o'-the-wisp.
