Growing Old. VfhsA is it to grow old ? Is it to lose the^rlory of the form. The lustre of the eye P Is it for beauty to forgo hex wreath? Yes, but not this alone. Is it to feel our strength, Not our, bloom only, but oar strength, decay P la it to feel each lunb Grow staffer, every fun ctaon less exact, Each nerve more loosely strong P Yes, this, and more ; tut not, Ah ! 'tis not what in youth we dreamed 'twould be. 'Eis not 'to have onr life Mellowed and softened aa with sunset glow, A golden day's decline. *Tis not to see the world As from a height, with rapt prophetie eyes, And heart profoundly stirred ; And weep, and feel the fulness of the past, The years that are no more. It ia to spend lone days And not once feel that we,were erer young; It is to add, iminnred In the hot prison of the present, month To month -with weary pain, It is to suffer this, - S} And feel bat half, and feebly, what we feel. Deep in onr hidden heart Festers the dull remembrance of a change ; But no emotion, none. It is, hist stage of aHÂ»' When we are frozen, 'ap within, and quite The phantom of ourselves. To hear the world applaud the hollow ghost, Which blamed the living man.
