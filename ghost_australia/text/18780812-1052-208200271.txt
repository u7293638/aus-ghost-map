On finding the Melbourne and Sj'dney \ managers unwilling to give a perfect novice with blearing \ red Iiair, a,nd a.turn-up nose, an appearance in " Hamlet" . f at any of their several theatres,- he resolved to "take the r bull by the lio'rns"- and get-up a company of his own down / at his pl.ace at Boolong.- -He went to enormons" expense J in building a small theatre, inirchasing wardrobe, having ; ) scenery painted — fpiv Banbury .was determined to do the y thing well andtin; tip-top stjde.
