Nothing annoys an onlooker. nune than to see a player throw; away any chances, and, after listening to a Dutch gentleman on my left, w^ip used tihe rights of acquaintanceship to be abusively criti cal, I felt that here was- . (A. KINDRED SPJRIT;' ' and from exchanging pleasantries at the ex pense of the youthful players, we' got-on to the great topic of '\ the.■war." " Soh ?" said .my companion, 'eyeing in c suspiciously, " you have. Been fighting >•?.

" Ach !" he said, frowning.;., "are we not all Dutch, all of the same family, so to speak. lam born in* the Transvaal; 1 am a Boer in Rhodesia. If I am in Barotseland I am a Boer ; if I am in Eng land I am a Boer.- Supposing I am at Enkeldoorn, can 1 say,/ '.Down with Paul Kruger ?' " (He pronounced it; "Powell Kreer.") " You do not' trusty us ; here in Rhodesia you have disarmed~*us in cer tain places.. Almighty! my brother is fighting in the -Transvaal. Can I say, Down with my brother' ?" ' . At his request I told him the latest pub lished news. "I do not believe that Lord Roberts is in Johannesburg," he said roughly. " The burghers would have destroyed' the mines and the town. "Why ? : Supposing, Hesr, you admitted a man into your family— your family so peaceful and happy^-arid that man said Rive me .your beat room, give me your, best horse, let me have the first pick of your meat at dinner ; and when you said, No, it-is not right that you should have the best bit my house, because you are a stranger, he' brought in his friends to beat you., and say, Voetsak ! you dam Dutchman ! . Would you not beat that man first amongst all who came to \ smite you ?" I am. not great at proverbs, but I made an essay. " Supposing," I said—very slowly, for 1 had to make it up"as I went along—"sup-i posing the man came to your house, and : he said, Let me stay here and work your land, and I will make you rich. You are poor now, and cannot afford to buy a carpet to your best room. Let me stay and treat me as an equal, and I will make you rich that you will be able to buy a carpet for every room, and a horsehair suite for your parlour, and a mahogany table and a big Bible to put in the middle of it, and wax flowers under glass shades, and anti macassars and china dogs—everything that makes life worth living. And supposing you agreed, and then as he made the money and enriched you you treated him worse and worse, and instead or putting him in your best bedroom you first shifted him Into *he servant's room, then into the Kaffirs' sleeping place, and then kicked him out on to the veldt, and fed him on mealies, and, when the man grumbled, said (knowing his existence depended on your land, which ihe had enriched by his in dustry). Go, if you do not like the place ; would not the man be justified in seeking redress ?" My Dutch friend shook his head.
