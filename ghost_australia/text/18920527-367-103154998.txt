OUT WHERE THE DEAD MEN LIE. AFTER THE LATE B. H. BOAKE. [Suggested by the melancholy death of Barford H. Boake, and conceived to have been written by him when he was growing insane and meditating suicide.] FROM the outlying vague I hear them calling, That's where the dead men lie ; The eaglehawk there to the feast is falling, That's where the dead men lie. The crow like a raven round is winging, And sweet as a thrush the bird in singing "Come away, on the branches swinging, * Out where the dead men lie." In the morning there's no mourning Out where the dead men lie ; But a gruesome gulf the land is bourning, That's where the dead men lie, And through the floods the fiends are filing, Back I shrink tram their beck beguiling, AEons there away they are whiling, Out where the dead men lie. Out beyond in the silent inland, That's where the dead men lie ; Far away from this cold, dark sin- land, That's where the dead men lie. The wild, red dog the sheep in turning, And a spirit there is wailing, yearning — "My love ! Oh, when will ye be returning, Here where the dead men lie ?" Far away in the drifting dreamland, That's where the dead men lie ; It's no waste, but a mystic streamland, Out where the dead men lie. The blood-birds here are on me swooping, But there the myall-trees are drooping, And the night-owl in the branch is whooping — "Come where the dead men lie." The skeletons there with cold are shaking, Out where the dead men lie ; But a white ghost there a fire is making, Out where the dead men lie. Through the red stream I here am wading, And the long, long shade my soul is shading ; But hark ! — I am off ere the day be fading, Out where the dead men lie. * He hanged himself on a branch. 23rd May 1892.
