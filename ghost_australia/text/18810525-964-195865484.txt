The 6U Garden Seat. BY H. A. ST. BUXT0N. CHAPTERVI. Danng this year my cousm attamed lus majority. We celebrated the event t with great/éjoicings, ; and in a manner béfittitog Ihsi brilliant prospects. When sitting here on the evening following his comiiig of v age< my cousin joined me. I tried to éscape for I had a presentiment of what was coming, but it was no use, he would be I.,h dreaded this höur, and it had eom»-s| J^s . so l sat by his side aind listened in sileritfe to his story. His voice sounded husky and :dry, and his hand was deathly cold and trembled like a leaf. He had closed his nervous, shaking fingers över mine as held them as if' in a vice. I could have cried at the pain he gave me but for the far sharper pang at my hfeart. I shall never forget that' eager boyish face, and the melting softness of his bright blue eyes, as he told mej-i® w^rds^ which were somewhat incoherent, but from" his hearfc, how dear I was to him. "I have loved you from the first time I saw you, Nelly. When you came o ver to Melbourne to see us, a little girl. of tyetye,- I said there is my wife, when I'm twenty-one 1*11 ask her to marry me, and if she does not love me, and will not have me, J'll never try to love anyone else. The man of twentv-one now fulfils the vow made by the boy of four : , teen. I have told you how déarly T love you,' 1 and asked you to be my wife. Will you not speak to me my darling, and tell me that my love is returned, and tliatyou will bemine r" How could I speat? In wTiat~wöf3scoula I tell this sanguine boy lover of mine that did not, could not love him, that his dream of years was only a dream ? v It was a hard lask, a cruel task, yet it must be done. Af ter two or three inéfféctuäl 'åttenipts I-^ucce.eded-in gaining my voice, and in the kindesHänguage 1 could command I told him the unplessant truth. How I hated-myself.. -if l eould-only have told him the truth gradually: but no good would come of that. I felt it was the kindest and best thing I could do to let him know the worst at once. At first he was incredulous. He believed I was only tantalizing him : keeping him in suspense. Whén at last convinced that" -T was in earnest, he got up and walked away with ä . hard |ook; qh his face, and the quick heavy tread which was a sure indication that he was angry, and that his temper was in a fair vray of getting the upperhand. I had tried hard to«pare him the mortification which would follow , a formål declaratioa of his.love. , But mjréffqrts to ward it off were of no avail. He had no mercy on himself, nor would he be sätisfied with one no. Time after time he beg;ged me to reconsider*the subject, to try to love him.' I cannot tell y ou ho sv sorry I was for him, for I knew only too well what he was going through. I had drunk the bitter cup to thé dregs. He did not as he had done. before plunge into gaity and dissipation, but •wandered about sad and listless, the ghost of his former merry, joyous sélf. This state of things could not last for ever. Much to my satisfaction at brealsfast one ippming he announced, the to me welcome héws, that he intended taking a trip round the co\onieSi and that he should start för Melbéurné b^ thé next steamer but ohe, which sgiled early the followmg week. What ä relief it Was to me: this news was like ram in summer to thq thirsty plaats, it gave me.new lijfe. My cou<sin's altered looks were a soré troiible to me,; and his pertinäcity in re^urning .to^hé siipject on which we could not agree wearied-me,.but did not shake my firmness in the slightfest^ degree. I had a .feeliog of almost iafinite' pity for him, and thip was the only feeling he had evoked until the évenitig prévious jto thé; morning when he informed us, öf ,his inteij-, tion to leave us: then he roused my anger. "It is no use taljking, Eägar^ dear,",,I .said, " you know we cannot force ourselves to love I do love you; but it is with a sisterly-iove. You would not surely .häye me, jm^rjr Jyou with only that feeling 3 you woul4, tfever be sätisfied with that, and' we J should both be wretched. I'm truly sorryirbut Ä&VJCSnltiJi; osat. Our hearts are not our, own to give ; and it would : be, ^nkindjof^pae ffj^^gjqy^dyou with hope." -. : , .-! - \ ; nr r > "Only tell me one thing, Nelly; only answer me one questioA and I pirdmisé td be sätisfied. As you think it quite impossible . that you can ever love me, tell me dö you love anöther ?" "Edgar," I said, and I felt the warm blood rush to my face, "you have no rjght; to ask that question. It is all sufficient for you to know that I do not, and nevef shall cäre ¥or you as you Vish." "Ah! I see it is true," he burst out impetuously, "you do love him; the mean supplanter. I saw how it would be. from the first. You did care for me tijl he came. I knew he would put strife between us two $ and that made me hate him." I Quicker and heavier was my cousins jstep as he marched. away leaving- me to coof my anger had passed-away Jong hgfore the hext week. When I shödk hands with my cousin and kissed him good-bye L had no ill-feöling ^Vjfhen abo^t to part iim "my cousimy love revive élt/tiftit I-loved " Edgar "" d^urly:;- . / . - jl T « cannot| Saj me, out ] '—— wondered j-^j if -i 1 t had w^, béen ö- as kihd and , tepde towards him. as I might liayé been in his ^fou8ler™ If I . had bééh terér sö angry With him my anger would haye flownaway ati the * * ' .e apjpjpjwg as-he whispfred. i£ I -iäånot wish you JW/ ; riow." r Trotia jtqi this _ _.. mucmeeti him. in Vicforia ,-md is still unmarried, and from all 1 hear ] f ear m y day dreams about him were not fat t h e ! Another year had flown with its joy^ and ^s hopes and fears, never to return. Tt was thé anniversary of the tiight wben I last saw my friend that I again placed myself G&i;^ol-talih^iultbjs/pl^ seat,(So rich witH the memories of the past. It^was not ofteri that I indulged in long : retferies ; they were not healthy for me; but to-night I gave the f-reins o fancy, and allowed my tlioughts to^ rove listed. It mattered not hich ever roäcl they travelled they always ame back to that evening, a year ago. I had ust bu«ed my face in my hands, and- was azing with longing eyes at a dark; face nictured on the wall of memory, when a §llght 'rioibfe '^liaV 'mé r täu-Scd me to qiiickly uncover my face. Could I beliere my; eyesight ? For there, close to my elbow ^tood the living, breathing counterpart of f the an esclamation of pleasure I sprang up and| confronted him. In an instant my hnndsvwerc , clasped in his, and the éyes I love so dtarly were looking down into my face, and the Toicg "i-' rrr n tnibrred" -s»• ^^l^wasJ.dJLijig,m that'lie''had only WrlVed tl^t'eväfiiög, Sind:swe were the firstfriends he hrfd visited.
