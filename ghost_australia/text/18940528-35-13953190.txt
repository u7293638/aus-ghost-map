MEETING IN THE DOMAIN. Yesterday afternoon a crowd of between lOCO and GOtO persons garnered in the Domain to listen to addresses that were delivered on behalf of the condemned men Air R D AfnAOKFr, whowaselectedchairman said that hehopedtheiliftercntspeaU-- rswouldnotdealwith the question of capital punishment at all but would confine their u terraces to urging the Executive to prevent the miscarriage of malice which he considered would be oftener if the death penalty was inflicted on Montgomery and Williams He saw the two condemned men on the previous afternoon. Up to that time he had carefully refrained from letting them know that any steps were being taken to obtain a reprise 01 that there was an agitation to save them from the gallows All along he had advised them to make up their minds for the worst but the mother and brother of one of the men happened to tell them that home people were trying to secure a commutation of the extreme penalty of the law. Montgomery asked him (Mr Meagher) it this was true He replied, Yes, there IS an limitation to get your lives spared, but you had better be prepared for the worst To this Montgomery fail "And me a stranger God bless them ' It had been stated that the Executive could not reopen the consideration of a dhu unless "some fresh facts were brought before them That morning he had indeed a long letter of the Premier giving him some new facts and placing before Sir George some matters that were known before but he had now presented them in a light in which they had not been previously looked at He believed that, as the result of the agitation and this letter, they would receive -notice and mercy especially when he remembered that some 15 years ago the man who led a deputation on a similar errand of mercy was George Richard Dibbs (Cheers He knew that gentleman as a kind hearted man and he did not think that the right to use the letters L C M G could change the humanity of the man In that case noone worked more strenuously or pleaded hinder for mercy than did the present leader of the Government, and he was confident that now he had the opportunity of extending mercy he would exercise his power, and the judicial murder of these two men would not be allowed to rest as a stain on the fair fame of New South Wales (Cheers.) Many cases in which the offenders had been guilty of much more heinous crimes than \Iontc,onier\ and AA Williams had been less severely punished than these men and as the T ecutive could not see for themselves behind the jury, all of whom had signe 1 the petition for the commutation of the death sentence he hoped that their efforts would result in a remission of the sentence (Cheers ) Mr. G BlACk, MLA, moved,-"That this meeting having no sympathy with criminals or criminality and not considering this question from the standpoint of aversion to capital punishment, desires to place on record its approval of the exertions made by the press and Parliament for the commutation of the death penalty imposed on Montgomery and Williams and trusts that the Executive will accede to the unmistakable desire of the people for mercy " (Cheers ) He said that it seemed to him that the law under which Montgomery and Williams had been convicted had been resurrected for a special purpose, and if the sentence imposed were cried out they would find that juries in the future would not, come let men of ' wounding with intent," even when the facts of the case justified such a verdict The jury that reason the case had clearly shown that it they had known that the death penalty would have been inflicted they would not have convicted the men, and in the face of that he did not see how their plea for mercy could be unheeded The whole experience of humanity showed that harsh and barbaric laws conduced to crime, and it would be found that if these men were executed there would be no diminution in such deeds of violence On the contrary, men detected committing an offence would be tempted to remove witnesses by taking their lives, especially when they knew that they were just as liable to be hanged if they only wounded their victims the existing law was opposed of all the principles of humanity, and he hoped that the Executive Council would con- form to the wishes of the hulk of the community and not hang men who had not only not taken life, but had shown no disposition to do so Mr 1 WALKER A L A seconded the motion. He said that the Executive were called on to decide between the carrying out of a bad law and the unnecessary sacrifice of two human lives, and in the name of humanity and justice he appealed to them to suspend the operation of a law that was passed during a time of panic The statute under which Montgomery and Williams were sentenced to death was rushed through the House at a time when Sir Henry Parkes thought that all the Fenians in the world were collected around the Kiama ghost It would be a crime if these men were made the victims of any man's panic, and it would inflict a great blow on the reputation of the colony if these men were hanged The motion was supported by Messrs H 0 Cato, J J Purcell, and Mrs M'Namara, and carried unanimously, A vote of thanks was accorded Mr Meagher for his efforts on behalf of the condemned men , Air MEAQnER in reply, said that he had received requests from tamworth for petitions, but as he thought that in view of the fact that Sir George Dibbs was a candidate for that electorate the motives of the signatories might be misunderstood, he had declined to send any there (Cheers Cheers for the press Parliament, and the committee concluded the gathering, which was of an enthusiastic character
