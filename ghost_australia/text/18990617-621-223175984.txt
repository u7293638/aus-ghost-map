TIIE ARTIST'S IDEAL RECREATION. In a recent article in the "M.A.P.," Sir Wyke Enyiiss thns waxes enthusiastic over the greatest of all games: — "Staunton, who was a friend, could give me only the smallest odds; he could not give me the odds of playing without smoking his pipe. I could easily play half a dozen games simultaneously with out seeing the hoard. Now, for the merchant, who has no cares when he leaves bis office; for the parson, who bas nothing to think about but his. next sermon, and doesn't think much about that; for the lawyer' or doctor, who learned all they -want to know in the days of their youth; for the Parliament man, who has only to stand iu the lobby and feel which way the wind whistles through his brains, It is alj very well to take life easy, to sing 'or dance, or go to the theatre, or play tennis, or take a boat up the river. But for the ar tist — who never- can lay the ghosts which haunt his brain— who day and night, and night and day, is seeing what no one else can see- visions that he is striving to crystali6e into beautiful and permanent shapes, who wears his life out in honest -work that lnakes tbo brain sweat— for the artist, I. say, some quiet, simple, easy, unfatlguing, refreshing recrea tion is needed, and I find this in chess."
