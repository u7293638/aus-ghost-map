ORIGINAL POETRY. A DREAM OF LONG AGO. One evening, in the fading twilight glow, Wrapped in my dreamy thoughts, I eat Alone, Watching the lights and shadow* (aide and grow, IiU night waa queen, and rosy day had flown. Uethought, tromout the fragrant Bummer gloom, Of lords and ladies trooped a goodly show, Filling; with light and mirth the shadowy room, Ana peopling it with ghosts ot long ago. A soore of dainty dames with powdered bair Becoming patches on their charming faces A soore of gallants, gay and debonnair, , Escorting each with courtly airs and gmoes. They fill the tremulous air with laughter sweet. Their bright eyes glance, their fans wave to and fro. And silver strains my raptured senses greet, Of fairy music, stately, soft, and slow. And then, obedient to the measured chords, They feat|y rtcp an old-world minuet With rustling sweep of silk o'er polished boards, > And clank of swords with gleaming jewels set. Behold them bending low with practised (jrace Fair ladies sinking slowly to trie ground Amid their dainty robes of silk and laoe ; Each gallant, hat in hand, with awe profound. With skill of lifted arms and poisSl feet Each for the palm of ease and lightness Ties; While diamonds gleam, and glances, coy aud sweet, Fly to each cavalier from lane*' eyes. The music died away, the brilliant throng Like sbadows mingled with the suuimsr gloom, While, wrapped in dreamy thoughts, 1 sat among The ei:eut shadows of the empty room. E.L.JL
