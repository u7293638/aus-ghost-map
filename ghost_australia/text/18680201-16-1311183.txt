THE HONORABLE SQUATTERS. in the EDITOR on the Jinisiuxr. courier. Sirs-I see by your report of the proceedings in the Legislative Assembly, on Thursday night last, That Mr Walsh sneered at the efforts of Dr Challinor to secure the just payment of the wages to the South Sea Island shares by their masters, and asserted that no employee would be so base as not to pay those men Of course Mr Walsh, like Mr Fit?, man representative squatter, and looks at everything from their standpoint, but the cool audacity of such a statement as the one I refer to exceeds every thing I ever heard before, them from a squatter. Mr Walsh knows as well as I do that even white men in the interior cannot obtain payment of their wages spite of then being native born Buttons, and lining the Masters' and Ser- tents' Act all in (their favor He knows that a number of these laborers are systematically robbed of their wages by coal tom poisons of the clubs for whom he speaks, athol in one way or another Some are paid in miIuoIoss cheques, other a also charged for every crawled in thou (locks which stray s into the sea uba 01 gets w o ned by dingoes Other matter a again find out or invent something against Ilion servants when they show an inclination to leave and better than series, in order to get off paying their just wages and as the matter is certain to come be fore a Bench composed of the master himself and a few neighboring squatters, the poor fellow knows he does not stand the ghost of a chance of justice, so he has either to lose his justly earned wages 01 continue in a service which is disagreeable to him Besides all this, at some stations every man is expected to take a huge quantity of even a Stores during the year, and those being charged for at from 150 to 200 per cent in advance upon retail prices in the towns, he never has a great deal of money to draw. It is practices like these which have set white men against working on stations except from the direst necessity, and Mr Walsh knows it as well as anybody If this is the rifle with white men, what chance have the poor savages from the South Sea Islands of obtaining greater consider alton, ignorant as they are of our language and laws, and utterly at the mercy of these gentlemen ? Even though their wives are only iAi a year, there are squatters who would not hesitate for a moment in shutting out of the payment of this paltry sum, whenever they saw the chance ONE WHO KNOWS.
