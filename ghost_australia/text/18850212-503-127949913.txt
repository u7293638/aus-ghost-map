'Oi'timkh wlion Even's scarlet flag Floats £rom tho crest ol distant woods, And over moorland wasto nnd crag A weary, voiceless sorrow broods ; Around mo hover to and fro And ghosts of songs heard long ago. And often midst the rush of wheels, Of passing and repassing feet, When half a headlong city reels Triumphant down tho noontido stroot, Abovo tho tumult of tho throngs l I hear again tho samo old soncs. ' Itest nnd Unrest — 'tis strango that yo, Who lio apart as polo from polo, Should sway with ono strong sovereignty Tho Beorct issues of tho soul: Strange that yo should hold tho keys Of prisoned tender memorios. It may bo, when tho landscape's rim Is red and alumberous round tho west, Tho spirit too grows still and dim, And turns in half unconscious quest To thoso forgotten lullabies That whilom closed the infant's eyes. And maybe, whon tho city mart 1* oars with its fullest, loudest tide Tho spirit loses helm and chart, And on an instant torrifiod. Has fled acros3 tho spaco of years To notes that banished childhood's fears. Wo know not — but 'tis sweet to know Dead hours still haunt tho living day, And sweet to hopo that, when tho slow Sure raessairo beckons us away, Tho Past may send somo tuneful breath To echo round the bed of death. — L.
