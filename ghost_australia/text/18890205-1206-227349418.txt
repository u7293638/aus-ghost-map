Mr Mason beine first m the field in South Gippsland has determined to take the bull by the horns and make the best use of the present undecided state of the candidate market In another column appears a notice drawîng attention to the feet that a committee is bemg formed in his interest. Mr Mason will be in Traralgon on Thursday next but will not at this juncture give a pubic address, but he may be interviewed, Mid his opinions ascertained on any important topic. The feeling is general on all sidea in favour of a second candidal, and many are looking forward for another man if only for the sake of a trial„of etremrth A strong rumour was current yesterday afternoon that a very popular gentleman was likely to come forward and contrat tbe seat, and should the report prove correct the farm ;rs are likely to have their conditions sub cribed to. As regards Gippsland Central, the electors will have an earlv opportunity of ascertaining Mr Htrris's views on the burning questions of the day, as thut gentleman passed through fraral^on en route for Toongabbie and Walhalla by the mid-day train on Monday, and he is evidently well prepared for the fray. He was very pleased to learn that the Glengarry Farmer's Union had on Saturday passed a resolution to support his candidature. It is, however reported that a third candidate is being solicited to enter the lists, vïz,—Mr James Rice of Cowwar. A requisition to contest the seat has, it is stated heen sent to that gentleman from Walhalla and neighborhood. Mr Bice well known in Gippsland, and was fora very long time closely connected with the mining interest, and he would undoubtedly poll heavily in mining centres, though it is thought that on the whole Mr Harris would be too strong for him. Opinion seems unanimous hereabouts that Mr Mackintosh has not a ghost of s show and his name is scarcely mentioned.
