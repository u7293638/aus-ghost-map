SYDNEY WEEK BY WEEK (By Emily Soldene.) Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Only once a year. Merry Christmas; with the holidays, and the plum puddings, and the picnics, and the pantomime, and the clown! “Here we are again.” Merry Christmas is coming; one can see it at every twist and turn—the shop windows are full, muslins and silks, ribbons and laces, lovely frocks for the races; and hats, such hats; and the jewel- lers’, chains and bracelets and rings. A half-hoop diamond ring; isn’t a half-hoop diamond ring the delight of every girl (except when it’s on another girl’s finger)? * * * * Everybody rushing about; buying this, buying that; trains arriving every minute loaded with country cousins; bucolic brides and grooms ga- lore; and Phyllis and Corydon relinquishing pastoral pursuits walk the streets of Sydney hand-in-hand; streets full of visitors, with their pockets full of money; but, above all, streets full of children; children home from school; home from the “breaking-up ;” with arms full of prizes; no more books, no more crams; no more exams.; no more beastly graft; no more anythings; nothing but home. “Home for the Christmas holidays.” “Hooray!” “Hooray!” * * * * Home for the holidays. A tearing, laughing, ramping, raving crew. “Presents,” “Presents,” is the cry. * * * * What shall we buy for Jack and Harry, and Beauty, and Belle, and Mamma? Oh, it is difficult. What a multifarious and bewildering heaven is the toyshop. Cricket sets and bikes; baby bikes for baby to ride upon; and talking dolls and Noah’s arks; and crowing cocks; and cackling hens; and ships and boats and balls and hoops and barrows, and musical boxes, and barking dogs; and things you wind up, and they run away, and then come back; and monkeys on sticks (wait till you hear about “the monkey on the stick” in the “Geisha”); and games — such jolly games, too — “racing games, where you throw dice; awfully jolly, don’t you know.” “Tom Makerbit had some dice last term; and we used to throw whether we should give him a penny or twopence each for a piece of the cake his mother sent him. The old man bowled him out. My word, didn’t he get a warming.” * * * * How bright and shining is the sun. How bright and brown the children. “Oh, mother, look at the boys with bunches of Christmas bells and Christmas bush; isn’t it lovely? Do buy some.” “Look at the pictures.” Such a rush. “ Mother, mother. The Christmas magazines. Christmas in the Old Country. Come and see,” and a row of noses, like a row of buttons, go flat against the window pane. * * * * Yes; there it all is—the snow and snow-balling and fires on the ice, and skating in the parks. in London and in the country, the children setting up a snow man in the old manor garden, and the bright stars shining with a cold, frosty, northern light. And the waits! Why, there are the waits. Look at them. * * * * It’s Christmas Eve — 12 o’clock at night. They’re going to play outside the parsonage. The par- sonage is cohered with snow; snow is glittering on the ivy and the trees, and from the red-cur- tained diamond-paned window of the parson’s study streams a light. Snow is falling softly, and the waifs, poor old fellows, who (in pictures) never have any overcoat, only a ragged comforter round the neck, blow into their frozen hands, and begin to tune up — a fiddle, a clarionet (such a squeaking), and a trombone — and there’s a little shivering chappie “cum with gramfer,” he’s got a triangle; the old man leads. Listen, such a quavering voice — “God save you, merry gentlemen, Let nothing you dismay.” * * * * “Is it really like that in the old country, papa?” And papa, who recollects just such a parsonage, and just such a picture, finds his collar a wee bit tight, or isn’t it the stud? Anyway, it soon comes right. “Just like that sonny,” says he in a loud, cheerful voice. “And when our ship comes in we’ll all — mamma and Tommy and Jimmy, and Bobby and Betty, and baby and me; why, we’ll all take a trip, and try the snow- balling, too.” * * * * More signs of Christmas. At 6 a.m. a girl staying at our hotel woke the entire corridor from its beauty sleep, singing at the top of a huge con- tralto voice, “Oh, Thou that tellest.” Boots and language flew about all over the place, and she subsided—but broke out again about 7. Awful. * * * * Lovely afternoon Tuesday, at the St. James’s Convent School, Forest Lodge. More “breakings up.” A splendid programme — operetta, “The Fairy Queen.” Fairy glens and mountains; princesses, maids of honor, ladies-in-waiting, fairies, and fays (with wings), and attendants, and lady guards, all dressed in green gauze and glittering dewdrops, except the Fairy Queen, who was in regulation white satin, and sat up very high indeed, on a tall stool, like the Fairy Queen on a twelfth cake. * * * * Then there were tableaux and piano soli, and a cantata, “A Musical Surprise,” played and sung in the most clever manner. * * * * How well everybody played and sang. Really Australian children seem born that way, and such pretty girls and dear little boys, and the cos- tumes— so complete and appropriate; and the composure of the young artists— didn’t feel un- comfortable themselves, consequently did not make other folk feel so. * * * * His Lordship Bishop Higgins presented the prizes, and made a speech — so sympathetic, en- couraging, and congratulating the pupils and the good sisters on the success of the entertainment, and said what time, trouble, and application must have been taken in the preparation. * * * * A tiny tot, in an Empire frock and a big pic- ture hat, presented Mrs. E. M. Speight (who com- posed and arranged the music of “The Fairy Queen”) with a beautiful shower bouquet. * * * * Among the most interested of the visitors pre- sent was Mrs. J. A. Hogue (everybody disappoint- ed at the Minister himself not putting in an ap- pearance). We all had a cheery chat with the Bishop, who was delighted with the artistic pro- gress made by the school. “Well,” said I, “I don't see any reason for sending to Europe for artists, with all this budding talent close at hand.” “No, indeed,” laughed his lordship. * * * * Getting to St. James’s was a dreadful puzzle. I lost myself. In the first place took the wrong tram (Forest Lodge Instead of Glebe Point), but good Samaritans put me on the way. At Bridge- road, the tram was rushed and raided by a mob of school boys. Such a scramble; such a rush; such a tear; such a filling up of doorways; such a hanging on by eyebrows; such calling; such whis- tles; they sat on ladies’ laps, on the edges of every where; and gazed with longing eyes at the pos- sible capacity of the top of the motor; and the Inside of the stokehole. They all had towels! “What’s the matter?” said I to the conductor. “Bath,” said he. “Ting, ting,” off they went. * * * * Of course I had to talk to the paint-scrapers hard at work on the park railings. “Making a good job?” said I. “Rather,” said they. Lots of them scraping; some with a knife, some with a file, some with pumice stone; decent middle-aged men, well-built; no braces, some no belts (a man has to be well set up to wear his combinations that way, you know); straggling, wind-blown, iron- grey beards, strong brown furry arms. An ancient and crumpled-up person came along. “Five an’ six er day,” sneered he, turning up his nose, which was more than a bit that way already. * * * * “Five and six a day, or even five a day is not so bad,” said I. “No,” said one man. “We’re satisfied; only too glad to get it.” “Five bob er day’s better than nothin’,” said another. “An’ sum people can make five bob er day go further than others can seven,” chimed in a third. “Five a day, and a little content,” said I, “That’s right,” said they. “Forest Lodge,” “Forest Lodge,” “Bal- main,” “Forest Lodge,” called the conductor. Into the train I got; that’s where I went wrong. * * * * What a fuss about the Sampson biz at the Queen’s statue. What’s the matter, any way. There was a great crowd. Nobody was hurt, I had a splendid seat in the Oxford Hotel balcony. and saw all the fun. “The boys” were out for ten minutes’ sport during the dinner hour. Your Aus- tralian boy was not born yesterday; and does not care on such like occasions to preserve his gra- vity, physical or otherwise. * * * * There were heaps of cabs, carts, and lorries, rammed, jammed, and crammed with toys; then other boys pulled original boys off, tossed them over the heads of the perspiring populace, and took their places. This went on with fresh relays of boys, da capo, and ad. lib., etc,, etc., till the carts, cabs, and lorries rocked like boats in a high and heavy sea. * * * * White-panted policemen there; nothing to do; no rush; no battle; no bother! The boys howled with delight when the horses stretched the chain; they howled with pleasure when Larry Foley made a speech; and they howled with derision when Sampson fell in a dead faint. * * * * The great sensation of the day was a freak (a walking-round-the-world freak) conspicuous in the Oxford balcony. “ ’Is golden ’air was hangin’ down ’is back.” He looked like a Montana horse doctor. The boys caught on to him at once, howled themselves hoarse, and saluted him with musical honors — “get yer ’air cut,” “get yer ’air cut,” — and the freak retired in soft confusion. * * * * What a turn out for the Salvation Army kid- lings on Monday night. “Kidlings, blithe and merry.” Oh, such a gay time; such fluttering of flags and raising of tiny voices; such singing, and such a get up; such frocks— red and white and blue and pink, and pretty caps! put on with such an air; and nice shoes and stockings, and pretty white petticoats, and beaming smiling faces; everybody so glad, and mother, and sometimes father, sitting in the front, looking with wonder at their little waif a lifted from the gutter. * * * * Such good voices and intonations, and, fancy! they sound their Hs. * * * * The girls don’t have all the prettiness to them- selves. The boys looked splendid in white singlets and knickers, and red sashes, and the Geneva Cross, on their arm; and other in black or blue knickers and scarlet singlets, with “Salva- tion Army” on them. * * * * I certainly think the Commandant and Mrs. Booth have “struck ile” in reaching out their hands to the children. What a civilising and unconscious influence everyone of these little ones must exert in their own homes, however wretch ed. The little tongues, familiar with a little prayer, the little minds stored with simple good words and, lessons to learn. “That’s right, ain’t it, mother?” And mother says “don’t bother me,” but presently mother will listen, and remember, too. * * * * And after a bit, father, coming in brutalised and battered from the public-house, will find little knees climbing on to his, and little lips whisper- ing, “That’s right, ain’t it, father?” And father will be ashamed to push the tiny one away, and, before long he, too, will listen and remember, and much good will come. * * * * What delightfully wild and windy— weather. And the dust! Delicious! Talk about dust! On a dusty day try the dust on the Newtown road. I’ll back it against the Desert of Sahara, and give the D. S. twenty yards start. It comes a solid cloud at a forty-five miles an hour gait. It smacks you in the face, twists and turns you round and round, tears off your hat, and hides the landscape; also the ’bus you want to catch. * * * * It fills you with dust — hair, eyes, mouth, ears, and nose; it goes down your neck, and up your sleeves, and in your shoes ; it tattoes the pattern of your open work — well, hose on your ankles ; it makes you sneeze and gasp. Your eyes (full of dust) begin to water, and your pockethandkerchief (also full of dust) is blown dustfully away. Absolutely you return to original conditions, and are nothing but dust — Newtown dust! * * * * Where is the hydrostatic dust regulator or layer? Of course, no alderman — not even a reforming one — resides on the New- town-road, or these conditions would not exist to vex the soul, offend the susceptibilities, and damage the garments of this thy servant. * * * * On Saturday, when Iredale broke his bat, one of the crowd yelled, “Never mind, hold chappie; play ’im with the ’andle.” * * * * Overheard at the concert: “Fine voice; what language is she singing?” “Ask me another.” * * * * “A baptism took place on Wednesday evening, the 7th, in the Scots Church, Church Hill, when the Rev. W. M. Dill-Macky immersed an adult. This is said to be the first baptism by immersion that has taken place in a Sydney Presbyterian church.” * * * * Why didn’t I know of the ceremony? I would have been there. When I was about 6 my go- verness—a Mrs. M‘Cormack — used to take me with her to chapel “Bethel.” The chapel was dread- fully dull and dark, and I don’t think the day- light ever got in, and it always rained — a cold rain — on chapel nights. Well, there I saw many people baptised, and shivered and shook at the sight. You could hear the water running into the tank in the most irreligious and commonplace way. When it was full the minister, in black robes, stood on the top step and waited. * * * * Then, out of the vestry, filed the victims, cloth- ed in long white gowns, and their hair looking very nice. The minister led them two or three steps into the water, one at a time; then, turning the woman round face to himself, took her by both hands. “In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,” said he, and plunged her back- wards. There was a fearful splash, gurgle, and struggle, and up she came, spitting and blue, dripping and dreadful, her hair like candles. Somebody wrapped her in a black garment, and she trickled back to the vestry. * * * * It’s a long time since I was 6. I wonder is the procedure the same now. * * * * Australia its a lovely place for ordinary folk to live in, but a more particularly lovely place for millionaires to die in. If Mr. “Intestate” Tyson had made his pile and died in the States fifty regularly and irregularly executed wills would have been on hand before the breath was well out of his body. And the widows of the generally considered Mr. “Bachelor” Tyson would have put in an appearance from all the ends of the earth. * * * * Wives married in church, wives married out of church, wives by mutual consent, wives of his youth, wives of his maturity, wives of his old age, wives picked up and deserted in deserts and ranches, wives lived with in cities, wives on sea, and wives on land, wives on the mountains and wives in the valleys, wives from the north, south, east, and west—all bearing mysterious documents (written, as a rule, on grocery paper in indistin- guishable hieroglyphics— lead pencil, and various systems of Volapuk), and accompanied by testify- ing trains of children and stalwart male relations, even unto the third and fourth generation. By this time hundreds of courts of law would be in motion, thousands of lawyers would have a mort- gage on the case, and there would be a corner in black kid gloves and hat bands. * * * * During this “breaking-up” time I have had little talks on the course adopted during the edu- cation of the higher classes and the systems of cramming — the exhausting labors and excessive hours. Fancy children having to get up at 4 a.m. to prepare lessons for the day; slave till 7, then a music lesson; then a gobbled breakfast, then to school; then preparations for exams. What’s the good of it all? * * * * The teachers say, “I could not keep my school open if the pupils did not take high honors. It’s not our fault; it’s the parents.” * * * * No wonder the rising generation get that “tired feeling,” and take to spectacles. * * * * “Uncle Beasley, are you going to heaven?” asked the little boy? “I s’pose I’ll have to some day or other,” said the old man, sadly, * * * * “No,” said the positive girl, “I will never tie myself down to one man.” “Perhaps,” he replied, sarcastically, “if I organise a syndicate, you will consider our offer.” * * * * “I hear he refused to take chloroform when he was operated on.” “Yes, said he’d rather take it when he paid his bill.”
