A MELANCHOLY DEATH. Gd Friday evening two men, named Charles Smith and I*nederick-Ford, wereproceeding from the •Eon railway crossing to Carisbrook, for tbe purpose^ of procuring some additional tools. On the way they Called at Moss's Bridge hotel, JUraigie, and after remaining there a short lime went a «hort distance outside, where they eat down to enjoy a smolie. Being rired with their walk in snch warm weather, and probably slightly overcome with the refreshment they had partaken of, they fell asleep. How long they slept is not knpvrn^ but it it is believed it was some tine alter midnight. However, when they awoke it was dark, there being no moon. The two then resumed theirjourney, first crossing the "roadway so as. to secure the Carisbrook.road. Almost immediately after Smith heard a splash, and called out "Hilloa! Fred, Fred, west's that?" Smith received no reply, and in a moment or two afterwards he called out "Fred, where are you ? " He had scarcely made the exclamation when be found be was going down. ^He clutched at the grass,®but this only succeeded in baking bis fall, which appears to have stunned bim. When he 'recovered he gftand be was partly Iving in the water, but tre.managed to sctamt>1e, on to the bank, jffere he lay jBntil dAylig'ht, about 4 o'clock, inl* at a abort distance he saw his mate Ford Wibg in the creek dead. Fofd was a married |hltn,.find be leaves seven children quite un- |>r6vided for. The question as to who is re- ^jbnfepihle for4hia mab'a death will have to 4m answerfed. &uch; ari iccideut as occurred InSthis instance might happen to the most iSpber man in tbe community, and therefore it is a place which should be fenced off from the road.—Maryborough Advertiser. Ovi Thodb*kd Miles nr" Osx Thodeakb, Hocbs.—It is to Captain Barclay that pedestrians attribute the introduction of the cclebmtwl fat of waiting one tLousaad mile* jn one thousand succesnre hour*." To do : twenty four miles a day for si* weeks—although a formidable prospect for any beyond a comparatively email member of men and an impossibility forihe majority—would not deter any rei pedestrian, soring thai he could hate a long aad .sand sleep erdy night; but the case is very different when evHT hour id the six weeks, ni^it end day, ii to have its distinct mile of walking; since in no case can the men slacp ot nat more than About an hou- wd-A-halfat mtime.
