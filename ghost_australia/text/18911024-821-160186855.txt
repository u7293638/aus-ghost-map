POETRY. THE SEA MIST. It creepeth slowly o'er sea and land, A curtain dropped by an unseen hand O'er marsh ana river, o'er sea and sky. Some weird enchanter is surely by! The trees are motionless, winds are still, And bushed the voice of the rippling rill; s white: The dew-drops gleam on the whitened ground, And ev'rywhere is the mist around. Now sweeping by like a veiled form All toss'd and torn by a winter storm; Or dim procession of silent ghosts That hurry by to their midnight posts. Do mermaids rise from the hidden sea To dance in merriest revelry? I Do fairies march through the darkened dale Secure from sight 'neath the friendly veil? Would some sweet spirit of love and light Fain pass unwatcbea through the moonlit night To whisper low to a weary heartâ€” A heaven-sent message of peace and rest? Perchance God's messenger bears to earth The spark that kindles a soul to birth; Perchance the Angel of Death flies near With one who lingers no longer here. As silent it came so it passes away; The moon breaks out o er the swelling bay; From moor and mountain,fromwoodandstream, The mist has rolled like a fairy dream.
