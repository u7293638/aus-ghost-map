TO THE EDITOR OF THE SYDNEY GAZETTE. SIR, Ham a young writer, and hop yowll spel mi pom krekt Mistr Hou. Mustapha Rub-a-dub, Doctor & Co. With cheek-for-jowl discontent jingling go, Contented, however, to interchange puff, When the Doctor looks pleasant, and Mustapha bluff, I vow by Mahomet, bold Rum-bottle cries, To bow to dear Ghost to my very shoe-ties! The Ghost, as in duty, tells dear Whiskerando, He'll praise, and he'll puff him, do all that he can do. Confound the Gazette ! ah ! see it appears, They mournfully cry, almost melted to tears ;--- Their hop, skip, and jump, and their merry grimaces Are stopt, and despair is beheld in their faces. O dole to the day that we meddled with Howe ! Who'd have thought the Gazette would have made such a row? However, says Mustapha, now at the most, There's nothing like hect'ring it out, my dear Ghost ! I'll write from Van Diemen's, and you will write me ; We'll publish these letters, and then you will see We'll have reason to hope, too, as well as to hop, If Howe on our measures may not chance to pop. Our stew-pans, we'll brandish, and merrily jingle, With gown and with wig, too, a bed-post we'll mingle ; We'll nail him with these, they are powerful enough, He said,---when Howe popped his goggles at once on the puff ! !
