More and more women are writing in newspapers, and also producing fiction, which exhibits a splendid power of intuition, which we look in vain for in the work of many men now that the great prophets of literature seem to be dead. Women are taking an enormous part in tlw forces of the world, not only in society, they hare always done that; not only in the"family God"grant they mav alwavs do that efficiently but in the potent spheres of literature,, in the formation and promul- m gation of aliigherpublic opinion ky-an4. by, at no distant date, women will have the larger opportunity afforded by the franchUe. For all this talk or twaddle is getting more and more to be regarded as rot ten and shallow, that women are not fit to sit on County Councils or to vote for those in Parliament. Such a Congress as this will more than anything dse hasten the aoment when women mil cease to be re- «ard«i merely.as chattels in-the house: but ^u have a fair sharcuof direct political representation. . It i* no unfemininc or foolish ambition that prompts women to desire a larger voice, a more dim* direct influence jnnueuee in publi c affairs.

But during the past week we bare seen these great .powers libera ^--d for nurposes -which "will make of this world a Kingdom*of God and of dlis Christ; women have gone solid •for peace and arbitration. We are bleeped in this country .in having in the greatest lady in the land the right attitude adopted in regard to war. What has been the attitude of our Queen in this respect? A woman of few words, but to the "point—a woman of noble hearty of inflexible principles, with ,the courage of her opinions; not on the side of big batta^ Eons, but on the side of God, her influence has always been in the. direction of peace and' arbitration! It was so before the Cri-, mfea; she then stretched her* royal prerogative almost to bursting to prevent what has since been regarded as an unnecessary war. But the overwhelming power of the nation stepped in and submerged tne will of both the Queen 1 and Prince Albert; and though they knew tie people were wrong, as constitutional sovereigns they would not go against them. 1 Her Court was pore, her Jife serew- God gave her peace, her land reposeu * And when has she been backward after the battle in kindly messages of living sympathy and practical help for the wounded and ijhe bereaved? Now; 1 then, to close. . Women's duty before the battle i6 to avert war. After the battle it is for ?ier to^descend like an angel of pity and mercy ur>on the terrible devastations. of war,. bringing the anodyne to pain and suffering. - - When jiain and nek' the brow, A ministering anged then. This is her grand prerogative. "God bless all good women^'^ says Oliver Wendell Holmes. *'To their, kind hearts and tender hands 1 we must all come at last." Thank God, 'Many, women wene ithere," is a sentence winch miglit .be written over every hospital aind over every battlefield, over every ambulance; orer every place wifere there is wretchedness and misery. Sisters of Mercy, female philanthropists, patient nurses by the bedside of sufferers, privilegedjto behold not only the ehaiteraa body, XKXt only the material decay, not only Uie dying gasp, not only the living, palpitating organism turned in a. moment into insensate clay; not only do ye witness all these materialistic, paralysing eighite, but you have also opportunities most predfaus of seeing the perishing man outwardly, inwardly rrenewed day by day; you realize the spiritual touch; you behold visions that you' «ma6t see, and hear gonads that you cannot hear. You are present at that wonderful moment when the spirit esiales itself, and tie voice unheard by yon is ringing in the ears of your patiemit, who lifts up his eyes to tie MUs from whence cometh ealvatiom. Nurses, you are not made materialistic and infidel by your long watches around these scenes of decay and paralysis, for- these point yea beyond the things seen and temporal ito the things unseen and eternal! Hie mission of women after the battle is, then plain and patent. Her own heart tells "her what she ought to do. She 'goes forth from ward to ward, and from bed ito bed; tie dying look up, and a last flickeT of languid joy comes AAIIIAO into INT/\ IFILWILR their /IVM eyes, on/1 and FLIPY they endure as seeing Him who is in-visible. 1 T think in that w>dil-known poem of tiongfel low, called "Sancta Filomena," FJorenec Nightingale is the embodiment of all that is best and nobles: in womanhood. Holding aloft the lamp of pity, she is made oae with all ithat is tender, and good, and 'helpful in human nature, especially female human na ture. On England's annals thro' the long Hereafter of her speech and sons, A light its rays shall eaft From portals of the past. A lady with a lamp shall stand In tlic great history of the land, A noble type of good Heroic womanhood.
