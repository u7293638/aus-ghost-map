The incident is from the "Love Stories of Parthenius," who preserved fragments of a lost epic on the expedition of Achilles againsy Lesbos, an island allied with Troy. The daughter of the Lesbian king Within her bower she watched the war, Far off she heard the arrows ring, The smitten harness ring afar; And, fighting from the foremost car, Sae one that smote where all must flee; More fair than the Immortals are He seemed to fair Pisidice She saw, she loved him, and her heart Before Achilles, Peleus' son, Threw all its guarded gates apart, A maiden fortress lightly won! And, ere that day of fight was done, No more of land or faith recked she, But joyed in her now life begunâ€” Her life of love, Pisidice! She took a gift into her hand. As one that had a boon to crave; She stole across the ruined land Whero lay the dead without a grave, And to Achilles' hand she gave Her gift, the secret postern's key. "To-morrow let mo be thy slave !" Moaned to her love Pisidice. Ere dawn the Argives' clarion call Rang down Methymna's burning street; They slow the sleeping warriors all, They drove the women to the fleet, Save one, that to Achilles' feet Clung, but in sudden wrath, cried he : "For her no doom but death is meet." And there men atoned Pisidice. In havens of that haunted coast, Amid ihe myrtles of the shore, The moon sees many a maiden ghost- Love's outcast new and evermore. The silence hears the shades deplore Their hour of dear-bought love; but thee The waves hill, 'neath thine olives hoar, To dreamless rest. Pisidice.
