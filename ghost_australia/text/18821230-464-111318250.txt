POLITICAL SHUFFLES. Rejected Addeesses. No. IV. By JohnD., C.M.G. {Years and years after James and Horace Smith. ' Look !, Look ! 'tis the AIg King, so stately aud starch, Whose votaries scorn to be sober ; ' He pops from bis vat like a codar or larch; Browii- sfcout iu his doublet, he, hops, in his march, And froths at, the mouth iu October.' Fire aud Ale. (J. D., O.M.Q-., in reply to A. R., Loquitur.) In the dress of a travelling Tinker. Hail, Littlo Doctor ! Let me wish your here, A merry Xmas and a blythe New Year! For though J couldn't face my Christmas cheer, With ghosts of may'rs and hatters hov'ring near ; And not a stimulant— not even beer — To keep one's diaphragm from feeling, queer'; This child's notev'ry one, though long he thought he was, He knows now, to his cost, how sold-and-bought ho was. But you, with ' Asafoetida,' and 'Squills,' ' Protector,' C( tenax,' ' antibiliouB pills,' Tin. Ipecac, Pil Hydrarg., Olium Hie. (Enough to make the very devil sick), Soda bicarb, Fulv Jihei, Acid Tart, To mii and take, ter die, one-twelfth part With outward application of carbolic, , Would cure the most infernal case of colic ; Nor fear to face if good and strong your nectar is, That homicidal Thug — Angina Pectoris.' So now, dear Doctor— once more happy times, New years of plenty— merry Christmas chimes. No greater fool than I, aye, that's a fact— So there's mj diagnosis in one act ; I got so bumptious, soaring as a bubblo, That snubbing real 'white men' seemed -no trouble; ' And no one pities, now, since ' Fortune's daughter' Has levell'd me — a drop of dirty water. None but a fool would exorcise his lungB In gauging the gentility of Bungs ; Tet so I thought to please tho miners well, On stumping tour, at doaly Neufchatel. But one by one, Fond D.upes have bowl'd me out, Their vengeance thorough, and complete my rout, They, now my masters — 'erst were grov'ling tools ; And John, long-honoured, lies between tho stools. Caioloments fail'd me in tho Ward of Cook, Although you know, old man, the pains I took ; Nor 'bogus' meetings help'd tho C.M.GK Despite the much- respected M.D.C. Then, then,, South Sydney fell'd me like a, log — Most fatal stumbling block — the strength of grog ; And if I'd road ' The Gf-olden Fleece and Paris,' I'd sure have split with Carter, not with Harris. One other try ! Once more we're beaten hollow ! I fceokon'd, and Sir 'Enry had to follow ; So down he brought to help him in hiB Bpree, Choice spiritists— J. S. with Huey T. ; And open houses, tents, and ' Stringy' Barrels, Made the Boss see tho ghosts of all tho Farrells. But Tavrant show'd thare's such a word as fail, ? For those who'd float tho Templar flag in Ale. And now a word to friends of mine, , Who trade on magic letters ; ? - ?' If you must deal in ale and wine, ; \- Don't scandalize your batters. , ?
