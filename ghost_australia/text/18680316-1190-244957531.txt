Both of the m arc well kuown for their Fenian proclivities, and in ordlnnry times they might ho allowed io Indulge in them ; so far, at all events, 03 n little gasconading goea. But now, before they aro allowed lo hove tho ghost of B clinnce ofiflice, I call upon the people of Victoria to insist upon n clear, straightforward statement from the twin-expectants, not only that they disapprove of the murder of tbe Prince (wb Ich would not be much to get from them), but that, ae loyal subjects of the Queen, they disavow all sympathy with tho Fenian or any other secret scclrty organised for the dismemberment of the British rmpiro. If they will not do this, wc shall then he sure of what we only now suspect. I am, vcurs, Loyal to the Backeone and Spinal Marrow. Bast Collingwocd, 14tli March.
