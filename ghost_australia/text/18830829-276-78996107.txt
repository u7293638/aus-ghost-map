'? ALLANDAtiE EAST. (BY STBAYSHOT.) AUK. 23. The Racing Club at tho Bay have nqw definitely fixed thoiv bazaar for raco day next year. Tho proceeds of, tlie bazuar will go towards erecting a stand on tho course. By all appearances it will bol a succesfi, Ladies at, tho Bay as woll as ^vt Mount Gambier have kindly oonsonted to assist, and do all in thoir power to forward the undertaking, ; j Tho Salvation Army has been re quested by an enthusiast to send a squad of soldiers to the Bay to do battle agaihst the devil, I boliove. Now, I always thought the Bay could hold their own against enomies in that line, but faots go to show that I must be mis taken. If the reply be favorable, no doubt the army authorities will tell off a batoh of soldiers, undor tho command of some " Happy Dinah," and astonish the Bayites with their skill in sharp shooting, knee drill, eto, From an Adolaide oon .toniporp^y I take tho following, which will holp to show how hot some of the Bkirmishors are, and tho great taot, akill, and soheming powers required by the officers to lead their army to iviotory " At ,the servico in the Adelaide barracks on'Saturday night the hall was full. The se'rvioos Wont on evenly for a while, and thon somo youths and girls had to be Ayame^ not to misoonduot themselves. tAl stern pppe^l' for quiet was not rfl spondqd jto, andj a policeman was oalled in", who took out throe young females. .AftSrajfow minutes more of sinnincr a row .was created in the front, an2 some big, burly . fellow, ^vas rushed, out 'through 'the orowd by a person, helped by some soldiers, and giyon iu charge to the polioo, who, however, lot'him go, as he had not beon given in ohargo whilst in the hall. - Then the servioe went on afrosh, A soldier on the platform de fied auybody to say that h^ had touched any drink for two years, when a woman, a perfect Horoulos in size and apparently in strength, suddenly rose^ in the most excited mannor and, pointing .the fluger.pf scorn at the unfortunate soldier, gave vent to a torrent of abuse against him, The qommander quietly asked her to sit down; but she only responded more fiercely, and the -brass b'pfctft' v/as" ordered to Strike" up. The 'band played rind the soldiers sang " Roll the old chariot along," the woman Boreamed, those at the uaok of the room stamped, clappod, laughed,, and jeered, andabout twenty surrounded .tho, in furiated fomale, expostulating with her, but at the same time dodging tho thrusts ,ai>d blows she indiscriminately made at them in support of her contention, At last the band stopped, but the woman did not, and the captain failed, despite his shouting, to get his soldiers baok to their places, Nearly all in the hall were, standing, and demonstratively appre ciating the joke. Then the oaptain arrived at the woman's side simul taneously with a polioeman from the door; but .ho did not give her in oharge, as' Bhe promised to remain quiet, After this matter was conoluded, a man, speotaoles on'nose, jumpod up and uttered the fol lowing remark. Woe be unto him from whom the offenoe cometh; and if it ootne from ua-well, good- nightwhioh was heartily applauded by a great many of the audience as ho bounded out of the hall, Tho -after proceedings were more ordorly, Some pilfering has been going on in this neighbourhood lately, Buoh handy articlos as ham, bacon, oto,, have now and again been abstracted from out of somo kitchens; and I would seriously adviso our energetic guardian of the poaoe, who, by the way, was only reoently sworn-in, to patrol the stroets a littlo by niglit, and he will probably soe somo aotive Borvice, llcspeoting Mr, Whinlmm's maiden speeoh in Parliament, " Soribbler" in " EohooH from tho Smoking Room" in the Register writes:-"His deliverance pusses him up from tho third oluss benohes and ranks him among the seoond-rates, with hopes of promotion in the shadowy future, when Parliamentary age and ex pbriouoo shall moke Treasury bonoh honors a not wholly hopeless prospoofc for biin, He is not a brilliant speaker, but ho is grammatical; and that is an acquire ment not as common in the HOUBQ as it is in the debating sooietios whioh that House contemns, I Bhould sum him up as being a shrewd, hard-headed, sensible man, with more brains than glibnoss of uttoranco-a man who, not choosing tho tongue of tho orafty, thinks a groat deal moro than ho oan ovor explain-a man with a backbone and a will-the one not to bend, or the other to be made sub sorvient to tho desiros of any trickstor who may bo espocially suavo as the twain diroot tlioir stops smoking-roomwards just as an important division approaches, Tho new member, howovor, was un fortunate through norvousness in tho first attempt, Perhaps his idea of tho ' iniquitous' oharaoter of ono of the pro posed taxos aud his oxoitoment thero anent ovorcamo his oloar-boadnoss for tho moment, HowoVor, in depioting tho eft'oot of tho tax, ho said-' Why, it will fall upon the widow, tho orphan, and other charitable institutions /' And a little while after ho got into the dangerous realms of poetry ; but his norvousness madn it rather a diffioult task for him. to got out again, and lio only managed it by the saoriflco of threo important ' officer words' in ft fiontenoo, ' Wo should unfurl ooonomy,' h6 said, J|o meant that . tho banner of ooonomy' should bo sproad out to oatoh tho breezes," One of two soasons notod for super stitious observances in Scotland is that of Hallowe'en, Hullowo'en in Gaelic moans " nSmhuinn," that is " aftiuhtheiuo," tho fire of poaco, It is a Druidical fostival, at wbioh tho fire of poaco was regularly kindled, TlÂ»orp is no night in the year which the popular imagination has stamped with a moro peculiar oharaotor than Hallowe'en, It was the night for the univorsal walking abroad of all sorts of spirits, fairios, ana ghosts, all of whom had liberty that night, It was oustomavy in many parts of Scotland'to havo hun dreds of torches proparod in oaoh district for woolts boforo tho Hallowe'en, so that 'after sunsot on that'ovoning ovory youth able to carry a burning torob or " sauih nag" ran forth to surround tho boundaries of their farms with tbeso burning lights, and thereby protect all their possessions from tho fairios, Having thus socurod tliomsolves by these iires of poaco, all tho households congregated for practising the various ceremonios and superstitious ritos of that ovontful evening, As those aro protty fully alluded to in Burns's poem of "Hallowe'en," it isunnooessary to enlargo hero, There is still a romarkablo uni formity in theBO fireside customs nil ovpr tho kingdom. Nuta and applos are everywhere iu requisition, Those the old matron of the houso has generally in store boforohaiul for tho youngsters' good luck on that night, or as tho Ayr shire bard has so naturally expressed it The auld guid wife's weel hoordit nits Are round and round divided, And man; lads' and laBses' (ate Are thore that night deoided. Some kiudle couthio, side by side, And burn thegither trimly : Some stnrt nwa1 wi' sauoy prlae. And jump out owro the ohiraioy. Pu' high that night, The ceremonies of the evening woro nuMorous-suoh as duoking for applos in a tub of wator, the pnlling of kail stoolis, the three dishes or " luggies," the wetting of the ahirt sleovo, the Bowing of hemp seed, pulling the stalks of corn, throwing the clue of blue yarn into the pit of the kiln, the white of eggs put into a gin89 of water, reading of fortunes in teacups j these and many move were the superstitious ceremonies of Hallowe'en Our publiohouso has onoe more changed hands, and the gonial countenance of Mr, Ilobert Kerr may now bo consulted there, and as Bonifaoo of tho Travellers' Rest Hotel will over be ready to baud over to the ailing tho water of lifo for tho consid eration of ft sixpence only.
