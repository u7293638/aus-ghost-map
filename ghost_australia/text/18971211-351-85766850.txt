SMITHFIELD AND FAIRFIELD. DISTURBANCE IN A TRAIN. — On Saturday night some young men of this district, who were returning from Liverpool by train, became rather exuberant en route and damaged the hat-rack and other parts of the carriage fittings. The matter was under inquiry this week by the local police officer. A SILLY TRICK. — One evening recently several Smithfield young men journeyed across to a dance at Mrs. Buckett's, Prospect Reservoir. On the way they were con- fronted by two acquantances, who en- deavored to play a practical joke upon them by playing the ghost with white sheets wrapped about them. The horse became frightened and nearly caused an accident. The "ghosts" then wisely decamped. THE NEW STORE. — Mr. Carter has ac- cepted the tender of Mr. W. J. Ansell for the erection of his proposed new store to replace the one destroyed by fire. THE RAIN. — The recent rain has done an incalculable amount of good to the gardens and vineyards, and business folk are more hopeful of the Christmas trade in con- sequence. A NARROW ESCAPE. — On Tuesday a dealer was driving a cart along the Old Prospect-road in the teeming rain, when his horse stumbled and fell. The dealer was pitched out under the wheel, but the horse on regaining its footing luckily swerved clear of its prostrate driver. Had it kept straight on the man would have been crushed to death. I.O.G.T. — Owing to the rain on Tuesday a very attractive programme arranged by the Olive Branch Lodge in connection with Mrs. Burdett's mission had to be post- poned.
