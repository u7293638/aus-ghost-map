THE FEDERAL CAPITAL. " Outsider " in the " Coonainble Times'"" says : â€” The side lights in connection j with the Australian Commonwealth are ' a hit amusing to those not up to their necks in it, and who exercise their judg- , ment a hit. For instance, the local scram- I hie over the site of the capital is really 1 amusing. All the N.S. Wales Govern ment and Parliament can do is to recom mend a site, the, matter really laying in the hands of the Federal Parliament "Out West we would naturally like to see Orange the capital, at the same time Orange hasn't the ghost of a show, as the site will assuredly bo somewhere 011 the main Southern line, which would suit the o.lier colonies best." There is far too much of that petty, provincial spirit still ruling, which seotiu inclined to look on New South Wales as the whole of Australia, and 110 sin j'ie person displays mote of it than the present Pre mier. He opposed -'ederation right through, and is evidently a provincialist. of proviticialists still nr heart. 'Tis well for the future of the clony that Messrs. Barton, Reil, O'Cot nor, Wise, and other men of light an t leading do not seem to he acting in .lie same narrow spirit, else the hacks 0; the other feder ating colonies would be raised, even be fore the Federal Parliament assembled. The provincial spirit still clings, and will evidently die hard in many quart ers.
