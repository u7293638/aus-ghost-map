WHAT WAS 1TP One of the greatest disooveries of physiology is that we onoe had six senses. What the lost sense was no one knows, and probably no one will ever know. But that our forefathers possessed it there is no doubt, for tho remains of that part of the brain in which it resided are still to be seen in any one of us. These remains are simply a small and now perfectly useless little mass of brain substance, called the ' pituitary body.' It consists of two tiny little oval lobes joined together, and lying in a little cavity of the skull, strangely named the sella turcica, and situated over and behind the nose. It is quite possible that it may have enabled our forefathers to see in the dark before lamps and candles were invented, or it may have placed them in communion with ghosts and fairies, or it may have been an organ that enabled tbem to go home in a bee-line when they lost their way in the primeval forests. On the other hand, it is possible that it was a bad substitute for vision or smell or hearing, and it was allowed to die whan the improved sense- organ developed.
