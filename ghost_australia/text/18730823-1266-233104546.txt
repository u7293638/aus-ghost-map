That there was a mystery somewhere seemed certain, but I did nottronble myself about it; I only felt mydesire to get away from Raventree strengthened. Remembering bow eagerly my stepfather had caught at the idea of Mark's prospect of immediate marriage, I knew that, for some reason or other,be won Id have been glad to get rid of me; and since, before Barentree fell into his handB, I had been destined to labor for my living BB a governess, <?hy might I not do so still ? Many ® time the subject came to my lips, and would hardly be restrained ; but then I thought of. Mark. He might not like it;; and besides, when I saw my stepfather fitting there so frigid and Belf- absorbed; I was afraid. Thus the winter camfe on, bleak and gloomy, and the robins hopped about the ghost's walk to pick up the crumbs I threw there for them. It was yet early in December, and I waswalking, cloaked up, about the garden, one bitterly cold evening, when ra strange sound caused Tne to stand still: and listen. It was like a piece of irbn f&lb;^jheavily «)mewhere in the coppice. It went, not" without some hesitation,"' round to jh'e raven's tree, but it was nearly aBfl^Ittpdjf it had riot been P ehou1d?4ftWSHeen. nothing in the thicfcness oT tHfit'wood. As I passed up the' wplk othep sounds jnbre stealthy than the'rfirat^ ..were audible ; some one $ was, in ;the coppite;- I knew that :pay. • steptather -was in' the house, and ^Martha had gone into, the town; I a-eaeh^d the top of tie'-'waik, and l|s- JtntodAntooise, fis .ifcajheavy boily had ^oj3ped fro'm the'tree to thetgroubd, 7 1 'rafiinto the hous6 at '6& ; ce: T^Wd, standingin- fbe doorw&y; of J ,&eV;'piflbr, some .on^ySbo has just coigae aown^im ajtree.'

I was even impelled by ittfjto cry out Tiesilatingly,' Don't go,' but he answered—' Keep back, I warn'you, out of the way.' And then he-was-^one. I'Stood at the door, and heard him «njter the coppice; I heard more crashing of dry wood, as the feet of the intruder, no longer stealthy, pressed on, and : then I saw a ^man. gain the open lawn, and another follow him. The moon was under a cloud, and I lost them ,directly; there was nothing Tor me to do but go back into the houf .e; and then l remembered that I was.alone in it. I went into the kitchen, because, in finite of its drear j fastness, there was companionship in the large bright foe, which l could stir up into a blaze, while- ; the'griate in the parlor was but a mass of smouldering cinders. ' I began to reckon how long it would be before Martha could come bapk. I .occupied.myself with conjectures about man in ;the coppice: who was he 9 what'did' he want there,?

The moon came from under its cloud, and I counted the panes in the different compartments of the two big desolate- looking windows. Two by four, and four by eight. When I said that to myBelf, I was astonished to hear that the clock took it up' and said it also, but -more elowiy and emphatically than I did, as if correcting me for my lightness. Again I Stirred the fire, and looked for a supply of coal, lest it should lie down, •ahd leaye nothing to make a blaze with. Ij put. coal on with a pair of queer tongs, that pinched my fingers, and I noticed that the nob was Tusty. I looked over 'all the various articles hanging about the fireplace, and tried to think of' uses for thpmy some -jvere rusty, and some-not; and when I bad done-with them, I went back to ; the window-panes again." I was conficiouB only of a desperate desire to occupy my mind with tnfles, and prevent it from dwelling on Ahat old. shadowy fear which lurked in the dark corners of the kitchen. The coal I had put on burned :up, and the clock kept on repeating solemnly ' Two by four, four by eight'- till it "burst out suddenly into a loud whir, and struck.

He took what I brought; but his hand trembled-so that he could not lioldit,and I had to pnt-it to his lips. ' There, thatewill do,' he said. ' Now come here. Do you know where Mark Ferntam is ?' ' Yes.'' ' Go down stairs, and write to him. Tell him that I am a dead man, and he is to come here at once.' ' I will say you are ill' ' Tell him Well, well, it doesn't matter about terms.

Tell Jones your letter was not ready for the bag, and is of importance : he will take it to the general office in town. You cannot send Martha ; for, in the first place, she would not go; and, in the second, is not to be trusted with a letter, if she would. Lock my door, and take the key with you.'

CHAFlfaE V. • ' Whep I first eame to Raventree,' ib begaD, ' it was not like it is now ; ypo know that. I began by living pome what rafter my old riotous fashion; wealth was new to me. On the fourteenth of June, two years ago, I had a dinner-party.' ; , , i He atdpjied a moment^ and I thought of Ihe.gardener's atory, one particular of iWhioh(wae already proved false. 1 'We sat late, bo late that it was grow- inp dark, wben turning my bead suddenly lowardB ilie window I saw a face pressed [against tbe glass looking _ at, rs. I rose from my chair, and (FCAIBpeared If I had taken too miich^ne betore. I was sobei.ed then at once.-I p],aded sudden illneBB, .begged;- my 1 friends to excuse me, and one oT^tbem to take my place at the head of the table for B ebort time. Then I passed through the ball-door, and saw the figure of a man standing under the rovenV tree. I took no time to consider what I should do if my horrible suspicion proved correct, but went np to the tree. Tbe man leaning Bgainst it was unshorn arid in rags ; bis face had a lean, famished look, and his one ragged sleeve bnng loose «t his Bide s he had lost an arm. Tbere was a pipe between bis teeth, and he was coolly striking a match across the bark of the tree. In spite of all this, and the years that had paesed sinofc I saw him, I knew that he was my cousin, Archibald Fernbam, whom all the world supposed to I e dead. « Who on earth have yon got in there ?" he asked. " For pity's sake, eld fellow, give me some wine, and let civilise myself. I have not slept in c bed for fourteen nights," And for pity's sake," I retorted, " tell me who you are." ' He looked at me, and laughed. " Yon may well ask. I have seen some knocking about, but it's over now. Come, let us get in quietly; I have literally begged my way across tbe country, cache in the daytime, and out at night like the owls; for I waB ashamed to let old England's sun shine on such a garb as this." " Than yon have met with no friends ?" " Friends 1": retorted be grimly. "Who would be likely to aspire to the honor ? I was not going to make myself known in tbis condition." •Be did not know the thoughts bis words were raising in my mind. ' I took him across the garden to the ball door; I peeped in first to see that all "was clear, and then we went up stairs. ' He was so weak that he caught at my arm for support, as I led biia njfc that long gallery into a room looking, out into the coppice. I don't kno^ whyil took him; to that room, but ther^j was a voice whispering in my «ar fell: the time which nearly drove me made) lheprpperty,(fras,his, and I was wors than a b,eggi*r. a fiid s#j.y,one.]i;uow>that lie nad.come back 1 From what he said in thegaiden, 1 thought not. Would he be able to establish his identity ? 1 knew him; but was there any one else living who would bo likely to remember. him ? In old times, when we were boys together, we used to fight; and somewhere in that mat of grizzled bailthere was a scar hidden; and I alone knew of its existence. 'There was a bed in the room, and he sat down on it, and looked round disconsolately. " Why have you brought me here? It's like a dungeon." ' So it was. Why did Le help out the thought that kept playing about my own mind ? It was the only room in the house which would have done for the purpose, i'S high window being strongly barred with iron. ' I brought him food and wine, and he ate and drank ravenously, telling me all the while the perils out of which be had escaped with the loss of his arm. But while be spoke of savage islanders, a struggle for life and imprisonment, I beard the words dimly under the new thoughts which were taking a definite form before nae. i ' I did not care about his adventures; it was sufficient for me that he was here, alive, and in my power. While he talked lie continued to drink freely, and the wine began to tell upon him in Jiis enfeebled state. I offered him clothes, but he pointed to the bed significantly, and I left him. ' I turned the key in tbe door quietly, not that I bad any definite purpose in doing so. I felt as if I must have time to think, and yet, when I walked np and down the hall, trying to collect my thoughts, and look the matter boldly in the face, I could not do it. Tbere was notbiog iu my mind bat the dull con E.TicasneES that a net bad been cast round noe, and the more I tried to gel out of it, the farther my feet got en. tangled, AH that I did on that night seemed to be done without my will; tb® work of an nmeen agent spurring me on and smopthing the way fofme. I went 1 aown to my -pufeste, but was in no jmood for rioting, and. thoy saw it, and fell away bne % one,' never to be admitted into the bouse again. I stood alone by the table they had- quitted, thinking. I knew that my face bad not recovered its natural color, and that it would corroborate my assertion of sudden illness. Not that that mattered. I,bad, been in'tbe habit ,of dismissing any servant or servants at a moment's notice, if they chanced to displease me, and it would be easy to do it now. ' I went out amongst there, and acted my part, and yet while I did it, my mind was not made up; I was only temporising; feeling bow smooth the way really was before me, and getting my feet faster in the net of my own weaving. I stormed at them all: I was ill, half-poisoned ; tbe dinner was bad, the wine villainous, the waiting execrable. All was wrong together ; " they were in league to annoy me, and shoulJ go, one and all, that very night. I roused them to retorts that made a compromise impossible, and that night being modified to the next morning, the matter was settled. (To be Continued.)
