mW$ BY THE MAIL TOPICS OF THE WEEK. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, MAY 11. The Government have had more than one newsboys since I last wrote On Friday evening last they obtained the second reading of the Registration Bill by a majority of M and I Iastmght, or early this morning, the Budget Bill more properly called the Finance Bill was read a second time by exactly the same majority The interval between these two divisions was one of acute crisis, if we may believe a Government organ - the Daily Chronicle The most serious results were feared, and the organ of London Labour was very low spirited 'The opposition will make itself more marked in the lapse of time meantime the curve for a thick and that support of the present Administration has begun by the judicious planting of all sorts of possibilities. and the probable ultimate decision to appeal to the country By this sort of writing the metropolitan supporters of Lord Rosebery have been kept in a profuse sweat throughout the whole week So bad did the possible situation appear and no nervous was Liberal public opinion, that the Prime Minister thought it right to declare publicly on Wednesday) night, after he had won the 1 Two Thousand Guineas and was in high spirits, that he meant to fight " the thing through, and that if he had a majority of only two he would go on unmoved It was magnificent but it was not war and the prospect of a majority of two was so little inspiring even to his friends that yesterday they were again in the most doleful dumps To day the) are relieved-at any rate they breathe more freely) 'The division of this morning was taken on an amendment directly aiming at the rejection of the BuelgetBill There was a House of over 600 members, and only four persons, three Ministerialists and one Unionist, were absent impaired If we leave out Mr Wm Sannders,who,inhisoÂ»vnstrangc wa), went with the Opposition there was no grass voting 'Hint is to say, there was no other OladBtomun among the Opposition At the same time there were eight of the nine Parnellites who rely very largely upon the support in Ireland of the publican and his friends I his action of Mr Redmond in deserting the Government and going over bag and baggage to the other side was a serious transfer of votes 40 on a dull horse that the majority now standing at about 30 was at once reduced to 20 The Ministerialists who abstained are all connected with the bow ing or distilling trades, and the single Unionist who failed to support his own side was Mr Courtney-a possible Chancellor of the Exchequer whose views on the various points raised concerning Budget matters do not fully harmonise either with those of Sir William Harcourt or Mr Goschen When the House rose just before 2 o'clock this morning it adjourned until Monthly week for the Whitsuntide holidays 'Thus, on the 21st Ma) it will resume work with more than a full half of the session behind it. The Government have managed so far to get the leading measures of the session the Finance Bill and the Registration Bill read a second time, as I have stated The) are both full of novel and complicated details, challenging criticism, and notice has been given from the Opposition that the bills will be fought " line by line to the end tins being the case, the question may be asked what is to happen' It is absurd to suppose that the other " items of the Government programme, including the Evicted Tenants Bill, the Welsh Church Bill, and the Scotch Local Government Bill, to go no further, have a ghost of a chance of passing More time may) be bettered alva) in pushing them forward to a certain point, but their case is hopeless, and a series of narrow divisions, such as the two taken within the last few days must damage the I prestige of the Government in the country. It is all very fine to talk of fighting it out, even with a, majority of two, but the thing is hardly) possible As long as the Titiauce or Budget Bill is before the House, the Government will alway s have to count on the defection of the Parnellites, and if the Registration Bill comes up they can herd!) depend upon their own friends To my mind, the division of last Friday) on the Registration Bill was the more significant of the two taken since I last wrote On Friday the majority fell to 14, without the wholesale defection of the Parnellites, and therefore through the apathy of the friends of the Government. As a matter of fact the Registration Bill is not liked, even by some of the extreme Radicals. Men like Mr. Stores regard it as too much of an attempt to over reach the other side, and as containing many doubtful amendments of procedure in relation to elections. Consequently we find the notice . paper crowded with instructions to the committee to deal with the bill in certain ways. Mr. Storey himself-a Radical of the Radicals is for cutting the bill in two for putting the "one man one vote" clauses in one measure and the registration clauses proper in a second, This was the first idea of the Government as we saw in the Queen's Speech at the opening of the session, but it was abandoned for tactical reasons. The report goes that having seen their error the Government will agree to accept an instruction from Mr. Storey, dividing the bill, the reason being that the arrangement will get rid of the pretext" of the Opposition that their objection to the measure is not on the ground of registration, but because it dealBWith the franchise in destroy mg the plural vote, and in other ways. It may be that the return to their first thoughts in this way and help the Government, but it is certain that it postpones one man one vote indefinitely. possibly for years if the Government do not keep in the saddle throughout next summer. But It is necessary to bear in mind that all those difficulties some of them arising from the opposition of their own friends show the Government in a position of extreme embarrassment, and the moment may come when in sheer disgust or despair they will find it convenient to throw up the sponge. Certainly the outlook is already) suffiently ominous, and after the House resumes there will be he c1) times indeed, the intention of the Government is to push on first of all with the Finance Bill as being the most promising thing from an electioneering point of view, and subsequently to take up again the question of registration reform, For reasons already explained, partly found in the attitude of tiiel'nrncllites, the Government will be in constant danger of defeat, and if they got through without a serious accident it will be little short of a marvel. It may be said that they got through committee on the Home Rule Bill. So they did, but since then they have lost Mr. Gladstone, and on the Finance Hill at any rate the opposition of the Parnellites will be persistent, and not intermittent', as it was in regard to certain details of Home Rule Moreover, it will be needful to resort con annually to the closure for the purpose of making progress, and this will produce friction, thus adding to the danger of the situation. It is said that the Opposi- tion do not want an appeal to the constituencies just now. It may be so, but their wishes scarcely count, since the right of dissolution is with the Prime Minister, and he can precipitate it whenever he chooses whenever the opportunity seems least favourable to the Opposition. Con- siderations of convenience can consequently only Influence the Opposition up to a certain point, and the fighting will not be conducted altogether on prudential grounds. I told you when last I wrote about the debate on the second reading of the Registra- tion Bill. It was fixed to conclude! on 1 ruin) at 7 pm. Before that hour arrived in incident occurred which probably influenced the voting adversely to the Government At the opening of Friday's sitting the private bill promoted by the corporation of Cambridge came for ward. It embodies a compromise arrived at between the town and the University in reference to the special and peculiar jurisdiction of the latter concerning questioned ' I public, morality).
