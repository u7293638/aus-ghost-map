CoKBULTATlors AT W ASltlNOTON.-Judge Edmonds thc man of " visions," is nn adviser of tho President, and is feeqtienüy nt "Wa-hington. A noted " medium, " of New "Vork ci.y is frequently sent for, nnd hns in- terviewa witli the President, tho oliject of tho l it or being to obtain communications from tho spirits. In reference to the proclamation this may be said. Thc spirit cf Andrew Jackson wis culled up-m, and urged vehemently that it should not bo issued. Thc spirit of Thomas Jefferion was called, and was in f ivour of issuing it. It is now suspected that tho spirit which represented itself to be thnt of JefTereon was nu im- postor. Prom what we have been told we have n 1 doubt that tho President is a very linn believer in ghosts ; but it is sr.id ho frequently remarks that the communications from the other world are delusive.

As a last alternative, we re- sorted to the natural language of sign« ; and running a finger down thc whole fire, hnnded it to him, anil pointing him towards thc kitchen, gently pushed him towards it. Ho uniiiratood us, and dish after ilish of well difguised viand» soon followed, till wc could manage no more. Ile was evidently going through the lin, and how to Btop him was now the tliilicuUy. Words were of r.o avail ; so catching him by the coat- tail ns ho was about making another dive towards the kitchen, we put n ten-rouble note into his hand, and our hats on our head ; the bill followed; we received our change, and departed.-A Yachting Cruise in th;' hallie.
