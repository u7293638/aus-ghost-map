ViaTOBBES 6TRAITS— Townsville, April 18 ? Sydney, March 27. | April 26. The clipper ship Black Adder has again arrived from London, after an excellent passage of 84 days, out of which six days have elapsed since she rounded Cape Howe, and had the ordinary winds been fallen in 'with at the commencement of the voyage she would have accomplished one of the fastest runs ever made. This vessel took her departure from the Start Point on the 23rd January, but with southerly weather to the X.E. trades; was 29 days before she crossed the' equator, in longitude 28 W. ; the S.E. trade winds proved only moderate, and the Brazilian coast was sighted in IS S. The meridian of Greenwich was reached on the 52nd day from the Channel, and three days later the Cape of Good Hope was rounded. From thence she ran her easting down on a parallel of latitude 46 S, and made the SW. cape on the 9th. April ; from thence she had a good run to Cape Howe, where she was detained bv calms for six days. The barque Dinapore arrived on the 17tb instant, having com pleted her passage from the Channel in 97 days. She left the lizard on 10th January, and, with poor N.E. trades, reached the equator and crossed it on 6th February. The S.E. trades proved only moderate, and the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope was passed on 8th March, fifty-seven days out, in latitude 41-30 S. From thence she made her casting, on mean of between 42- and 45- S., with much calm ?weather off the Cape of Good Hope. The 8.W. cape of Van Diemcn's Land was rounded on the 8th April ; light variable winds prevailing on this coast. The fineiron ship Bannockbum, of 1700 tons, arrivedoff the heads on the 17th, and anchored in Neutral Bay on the 18th. She is from London, her passage having occupied 95 days. This vessel is owned by Messrs. R. Shanklan and Co., of Greenock, and was built specially for the Calcutta trade, to which port she has made two voyages. She is a fine roomy ship, possessing great beam and also superior saloon accommodation. She took her depar ture from the Start Point on 12th January, and had fine but light north-east trades, which were carried to the equator; on the 10th February, crossed in 29-4 west. She had no variables running out' of one trade into the other. The S.E. proved only moderate. The meridian of the Cape of Good Hope was crossed on March 8 in latitude 40-36 south, and the vessel made her casting on a mean parallel of 40* south, but the winds were very uncertain, going completely round the compass. Cape Otway was sighted on April 10, and from thence had a good run to Hogan's Island, which was made tbe following day at 1 .SO p.m., thence had light air and calms to arrival. Her cargo in cludes an unusual large quan'ity of brandy and other spirits, consisting of 100 eases schnapps, 806 casks -wine, 90 casks rum, 5110 casks and cases brandy, 700 cask* and cases beer. Xhh Wrixk of thk S. M. Svatsos.— The report of tbe stranding of the American barque S. M. Statson at Howe Island, and the arrival of three of the crew in an open boat, has already been made public. We are now advised that Mr. E. Williams, the United States Consul in this city, has entered into a contract with Captain Amora, of the smart little schooner Esperanza, to proceed with dispatch to tbe island and bring to this port the remaining portion of the Statson's crew. She will leave on Monday evening, or as soon as practicable, with provisions, &c.; Captain Amor* has received instructions to have the crew in Sydney before the departure of the' next outgoing San Francisco mail. Captain Amora, having been an old trader in the locality, feels sanguine of being enabled to carry out the desires of the American Consul considerably within the allotted time, and she being a very emart craft, there is every reason to .presume that he will accomplish the task. Thk Storm King. — Report of the Marine Board of New South Wales in the matter of the loss of the Storm King. The Board held an investigation into the circumstances attending the foundering of this vessel and ascertained that she was a brigantfne of 91 tons, official No. 32,492, registered in Sydney and owned bv Mr. James Wright, and partly insured. She was on a voyage trom this port to the Tweed, and had '20 iocs of baliast and 8 tons of general merchandise en board. On tbe morning of thr 30th March, at 5.30 a.m., when 14 orl5milesofl SealRocks, the was discovered to behalf-full of water, although she had been pumped dry at 4 o'clock . Every exertion was made to endeavour to free the Vessel, bat the leak increased so rapidly that at 7 a.m . the crew abandoned her in the boat, and made for Port Stephens, where they arrived all safe. The Storm King was observed to founder shortly after they left. The weather though squally dur ir.p the night was calm with a smooth sea at the tinie of the abandonment. The Board decided the vessel was lost feron. hav ing suddenly sprung a leak, and that no evidence had been adduced on 'which to found a charge of default against Henry Jackson the master. Tjii; Casks of Small-pox on Board the Ship BairiSH Enteb i-kih:.— This vessel, which arrived off the semaphore in St. Vincent's Gulf, on the 4th instant, was placed in quarantine by the Adelaide authorities, as cases of small-pox were reported on board. The Register says :— The facts of the case really are that seven mild cases of smali-pox occurred during the voyage. The complaint, which was early manifested, was for some tune con fined to the crew in the forecastle, but eventually one of the single girls was 'found to be ailing, and the symptoms proved that she had contracted the infection. All tbe patients were rigorously isolated as far as circumstances permitted, and every precaution was taken to prevent the spread of the contagion. One patient only, a wiilor, died. At the time of the arrival of the vessel in port there were but two of the remaining small-pox patients who were not convalescent, namely, the -woman and the steward. The former was recovering, but the latter was seriously ill. The voyage throughout sppbjs to have been a singularly unfortunate one as far as the health of those on board has been concerned. First the cmaU-pox broke out amongst the crew, then followed measles, scarlatina, and whooping-cough amongst the passengers. From all canses the number of deaths have been ten. It may be inferred from the nature of the disorders that, -with the exception of the tmall-pox patient, the victims would most'probably be children ; but. of this— owing to the fact that the only communication with the vessel which is permitted is oral, and that from a distance— the particulars to hand are not very definite. The strictest quarantine is to be maintained, so that it will probably be some time before we shall obtain full information of the particulars of the voyage. The provisions are put on board in the following way.— The star-board foretopmast studding boom was rigged out, and from its extremity a Jong warp reached to one of the ship's boat6, which hung far away clear of her side. Into this boat provisions and stores are put and then hauled alongside. The following are the passengers booked up to Saturday per R.M.S.S. Bangalore:—For Brindisi: Messrs. Lillywhite, Hill, Ulyett, Jupp, Selby, Greenwood, Armitage, Southerton, Charlwood, Shaw, Emmett, and Pooley (members of the All-England Eleven). For Venice: Mr. and Mrs. Oppenheimer, Messrs. W.

[from th-: herald1 b Newcastle cobkesposde;st.] On the 10th instant the Maitland (s.) came into collision with the lighter Champion, outside the harbour, and the collision resulted in the sinking of the lighter and the death of its master, William Campbell. In consequence, the Local Marine Board of Newcastle commenced an inquiry into the cause of the disaster, on. Monday, the 16th instant. The members present were Captain D. T. Allan (chairman), Messrs. E. A. White, J.P., Cross, C. F. Stokes, J.P., and N. B. Wallace, J.P. On the part of the master of the Maitland (s.), Mr. R. W\ Thompson appeared, and the owner of the lighter Champion was represented by Mr. G. Wallace. Henry Patcreon stated : I was engaged on the lighter Champion on the 'morning of the 10th ; we left the harbour at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 10th, and Campbell (the master) and a man named Lewis were on board besides myself ; the steamer Aquarius towed us out, and left us opposite Captain Allan's Hill ; we were riding by a kedge anchor and line, about kalf-a-mile off the land, and commenced discharging ; we had been at work about an hour when we noticed the Ajax (s.) go by us ; she had been towing punte out to be discharged ; a little while after that, the Maitland (s.) came in sight, coming towards New castle; she was about two miles away when witness first notieedher; continued work, and Campbell went aft, when he saw that the Maitland was coming on to us ; she was then about 400 vards from us ; Campbell sung out, and we came up and sung out 'loudly to the steamer; Campbell had not sung out before that ; a couple of minutes afterwards the steamer struck us ; I made a jump to got into the lighter's boat, but, missing her, went into the water ; I afterwards got into the boat; I do not know if the steamer's course was altered from the time she was close on to us until she struck us ; I never saw Campbell after that, but heard liim in the water; it was about a quarter-past S o'clock when the collision occurred ; I know this from hearing tbe Borehole engine whistle a little while before ; it was quite light when the collision took place, the moon was up, and it had 'broken' day; the morning was very clear and there was no fog nor mist. By Mr. Thompson : The Ajax passed us about twenty minutes before the Borehole engine whistle -went ; it was better than half an hour after the Ajax passed us that we were struck by the Maitland ; the captain of the Ajax did not call out to us, but a man in her punt did; he said, ' Hallo, old Campbell, 1 nearly ran into you ;' I know nothing of the lights ; I do not know if -we had one, as I was below fixing the kedgc when we went out ; I can not my whether there were any lights on board our lighter; did not see any ; I have not told several people, either on the steamer or on shore, that -we had -no lights up ; a man on the steanuT asked me if we had a light, and 3 told him I did not know; when 1 was hauled into the steamer1 s boat I did not ;-ay to any one we '.hud no business out there without a light, the Ajas was nearly running us down;' one of the men in the boat said it to me— that is, he referred to our being out without a light, but I said ' The Ajax was nearly running us down;' I could not see the Ajax just before the collision; she wa.s round Nobby' s; Campbell was working from the time we anchored until shortly before the col lision ; he did not lie down to sleep ; he was wovkingat one end of thelighler.andLewjsandlatthi'othei'jthelig-hteriijiittoiJiincrat't; the steamer struck the lighter a little before the after mast ; she ?was not actually struck when I jumped overboard ; Lewis was running aft when I jumped over; we made a little noise in putting the stuff out ; our head was facing- land, and Nbbby's light was to the right hand a good bit ; 1 did not notice a little vessel lying some distance out from us with lights burn ing ; I saw the lights of the Ajax about half-a-milc off when we first noticed her ; we did not cull out then, as she did not look as if she was going to run into us ; she was turning on her helm when we saw her ; the wind was blowing off the land, westerly and light ; the Aquarius had her lights up ; I saw them when she ?was coming ofi to us in the harbour. By the Board : I heard nothing on board the steamer to indi cate' that we were seen. Robert Bui-gens, watchman at Signal Hill, saw the lighter turned to sea ; she was about a mile from the land ; this was at about 4 o'clock in the morning: ; saw a light on boird the lighter at that time : could not sec it then with the naked ere, but saw it with the aid of a glass ; at .5 o'clock that inominir it ?was fine and clear, and day was breaking in the sky. The Board then adjourned until Tuesday, at 3 p.m. NEWCASTLE. ARRIVALS.
