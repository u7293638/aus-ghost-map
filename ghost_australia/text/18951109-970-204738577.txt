.Groat Streams of Wlieat. To watch the loading of gram either from an elevator or lighter into one of the mammoth vessels engaged m its transportation from America to Great Britain is to witness one of the. chief operations in the movement of the world s commerce. It is carried in pipes, with a funnel-shaped, moveable appendage at the end, which is shifted by means of a rope from one part of the hold to another, according as the stream of gram hlls up the spaces. It rushes into the vessel with the velocity of a torrent, and sends a dense volume of dust and chaff, upwards, obscuring the depth beneath, and making the men attending the stowage below look like ghosts in the rising uust. The trimming ' of the gram in the hold3 is an important part of its storage. After several thousand bushels have streamed into the hold, a dozen or more men are delegated to shovel tho down-pouring column in between the vessel s beams, a job for which they are paid at the rate of a minute* ^ In vessels of the Cunard type, it takes 12.000 and 15,000 bushels to fill a hold, and these vessels average 50,000 bushels in the total cargo. Ships carrying grain - alone can take as much as 125,000bushels ;-and when it. is considered that from 4,000 to 7,000 bushels can be stored in an hour, every 40 bushels weighing a ton, an idea oan he had of the force of the torrent directed into the vessel. Large vessels have four or five holds, and a distinction is made in storing the cargo in them. Grain, from its compact and dead weight, is reserved mostly for the centre of the vessel, while cur^d provisions are packed as far forward and as fair aft as possible, for their better preservation from the heat of the ship's fires. . *
