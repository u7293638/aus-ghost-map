ALONE WITH CONSCIENCE. I sat alone with my conscience, En a place where Time had ceased, And we talked of my former living In the land where the years had in creased; 4 And I felt I should have to answer The question it put to me, And to face the question and answer Throughout an Eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actious Came floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Were alive with a terrible might; Arid the vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to face; Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far-away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future And now is the present time ; And I thought of my former thinking, Of the Judgment day to be ; But sitting alone .with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a future ' . To this land beyond the gave, But no one gave me an answer, And no one can qome to save ; Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by, For it was but the thought of my past life, Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I knew that the far-away warning Was a warning of yesterday ; And I pray that I may not forget it, In this land before the grave, That I may not cry out in the future And no one come to save. And so I have learned a lesson Which I ought to have known before, And which, though I learned it dreaming, I hope to forget no more ; So I sit alone with my conscience In the place where the years increase, And.I try to think of the future In the land where time will cease : And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful soe'er it be, That to sit alone Avith my conscience Will be judgment enough for me. â€” Exchange.
