She had Riven, unsought and unasked, the \- whole passionate love of ber heart to Lord Castlemaine. She. had hated with insane hate the beautiful girl who had, as she congidered. iaken his loYe from her. She had volnnterily placed herself under their roof • \for tbe jnipcsa of seeking vengeance. _ Bnt ' She forgot that in £0 doing ahe must enfier ooatterable pain herself. ' Every kind and loving word that -Lord ' ' Cajrilemaine addreesed to his wife was like- a pword in her heart. She wonld grow cold, rack, and faint when she Baw HSs great solici- ' tede, his care and. attention for her.- Her ' heart burned with iealonely and envy. ifhere<eame a morning when a damp, cold wind seemed to sweep the warmth away: \- tbe atmosphere was all Samp, the skies -grey lowertogthe ffua had set in sullen discontent for ^be jAjt and tori Castlemaine f his -wife, > wrapped in her costly lure, f*-- iwfctiuwfejaf •• goitfg 7" ma Ida " I am going to Rsdmoss," was tbe prompt and cheerful reply; . • Eednxtss was the nearest town to Neath !

I hope you have ordered the brougham?" \- " Oh, Sadolpb, 'what a string of questionsi No, I have not; yre are going to walk." The ascvSr^tion took plⅇ in the great entraaoe halJ, where Irtrd CasMemaine met the two ladles. went up to his .wife, and Md his h&ftd; on the fur fiheen of h'ef jacket —a msgnifiisnt for for which he had giveq a fabulous price—one of his wedding presents to her. ' ' "This la warm," he said, "hut, Gertrnde, darlipR, it cannot shut ont the damp. Yon must .'breathe the danJp air, in fipiteof your warm furs. 1)3 not kp ont^ or if you will go, ord^r the brougham." ^ . , She cried out impatiently th&t; it would a^t hurt her, that she bad often been ont in the damp, and. would have no cafriBge. , "You make mo feel like a delicate old ; woman when you fidget about me in that way." , J ' She looked up at him with a smile as she spoke, but ther^ was eome little sign of irritation. . Isabel Hyde stood by, a client spectator. each word, so expressive of hie tender solicitude'for her beautiful rival, pierced her heart. "I will not bean old woman yet," repeated Gertrude. " I like you to go out in the frost," said Lord Castlemaine; " that hurts, no one. But damn air is quite another thing." Oh, Badolph," cried L4dy Castlemaine, " yon will make me impatient." "It is not an old woman you resemble," eaid Ldrd Castlemaine. "It is a beautiful white rose. Now I ask yon, Gertrude, how could a fragile white rose live in this miserable damp?" There flashedupon him the light of two beautiful dark eyes, in which love, pain, scorn, and dispair were all told. "Is all your care or Bolioitude for white loses?" asked Isabel Hyde; "have red roses nothing to fear ?" . * . Jf you take my advice you will not go, G," 1 he eaid, slowly, " I do not think it is a fitting day for any lady togo out." " " Still," she continued, " you would not have remonstrated if you had seen me going alone." H? looked at. her somewhat wonderingly, knowing nothing of the storm of jealous^ that rent her heart in twain! " Well," He replied, « jrou see, Miss Hyde, it is not the same thing. I might have advised you, but I. could cbt interfere -with you." "I may go ont «tsd get killed with the damp, and youvwonld not say one word to me," cried Isabel. "Forgive me, but howi veiy impetnons yon ladies a»e," he 6aid. " I have displeiased you, Isabel, and halt ofiended Gertrnde; yet leannot imagine why." \ " You are over solicitous for me," said Lady ; Castlemaine. . " You are not solicitions enough for me," cried Isabel Hyde, and then seeing the startled look in his eyes, she began to laugh, but no woman ever laughed with such an effort before ; her jealousy had' for the time carried her beyond herself. All that loving care and solicitude for Gertrude—ihe wind must not I^lqw too roughly on her, the damp must not oome near her; but what did he care for her? He w&s; so anxious and eolicltiou's about Gertrude that he did not seem to notice whether she were going out or not. iBat the grander in his eyes called her to herselfS Wh$t right had she to show any jealousy of another woman's hufiband. "• She laughed, but there yras little musio in the laugh. ' " Whke eo much care and solicitude are to be had," ehe eaid, " I may as well claim a share." • , " You will always have it from dm," said Lady Castlemaine;,"I strongly advise you not to walk out this damp, unhealthy 'day.** He looked at her Mildly, and she felt that to have that sense of loving care always over her ehe would give her life itself. "I shall go," said Lady Castlemaine, "damp or not damp, I have determined to go to Bedmoss, and go J wilL" "I will not," said Isabel Hyde. "Lord; Castlemaine is quite right, the day is against us." After those few kind words and that kind look, Gertrude could not have bpposed him, so a compromise was made and 9 carriage ordered. ; •' •'• Tbe incident, trifling -as it was, helped Isabel to weave a few. more threads in that strong subtile wreb of hers. She took Lady Castlemaine to task in a fashion quite her own. That afternoon, as they lingered in the vrsxin cozy boudoir, over a cup of delicious tea, v Bhe commenced her •attack. -, " Gertrude," she said," you do not understand your husband." ' maind.;?',!!)^ j-oaif pardon,' I amquitesure that 1^6." -X-Me - •;'• y -Isabel IJydl,sh6ok her beautifal head. : "No, my dear, ypa do not. I really believe," she. a3<3ed, somewhat imprudently, ," tiat I should understand him, in time, better than yon do." No jaalousy etitred Lady Castlemaine'e hsart; she only thought-that Isabel was a iitile too outspoken'; still she would like to know .what was meant. " What do you mean, Isabel?" she asked> gravely. "Nothing to make a tragedy about," ste replied. " I was thinking of this morning. I wa« so struck -by his care aqd solicitude over ycu, aod ycti grew impatient with him." " I am not very inpatient," said Gertrnde, wifa a' sodden contrition; " I own it, but I cannot esdrire to be fussed over and watched. Ion are tight, Isabel. I was, as you say, impatient without cause." < "linevat once that it was his care for you that made him persist,", continued Isabel. " I have often noticed that when he tries.beat to please yon, ;6u understand him the least." L%cJy C&stlemaina; could not explaih,<even to herself, bat something in .that moment seemed to riee, like a ihadow, 4>etween her husband and herself. - It was not jealousy ; as yet that fatal and, terrible passion-had not awoke in her ,heari. It was an, intangible something—a" shadow; and the clearest-idea she had'after the interview was, that shegdid not really understand her husband, and that other people oould read, his c'uaracter better than ehe could. • She £tilt farther away from him that day' than Bhc had since Hhey were married. It waa a miserable day to Isabel; she had voluntarily placed herself jn temptation, yet she could not endure to see Lord Castlemaine'e passionate love'for his wife. - -Ones, as she was standing on the grand -staircase, waiting for something that her maid had gone to find, she saw husband and wife meet quite accidentally in the halL It was in the shadow of the winter afternoon, before the lamps vere lighted. She heard Lord Cistlmaine say: "Gertrude,darling,is that you I" She heard the gently murmured " Yes./ Love alone, uses such tones. Then she saw him clasp his wife in his arms, and cover her face with kisseS. " My?darling, my beautifal wife. I shall come and have a cup of tea with you." • Isabel turned away, utterly unable to bear It. .If by one wiah, if by, raising. her finger, she could have straok the white- rose heauty from G:rttjade , 8 ftw, she would have dwe it., In her passionate, jealous rage, she could have-Btruck dead the man she lovedL Lead us not into temptation !" The words came to her lite ffcint iooflds through a ixiiat. In het heart—that jfialoas; despairing heart,' full of love for a man who h&d; never loved her—she felt capable, in that moment, of any crime; she could h&te; elfiinth&t; fai* young \rife'; she could have sl∈ the man whose dark, hafidsome face had lured her to her., doom. She turned away. Death would have not have been bo bitter as the paifi that-tent ha heart. ; An hour* afterwards, when Isabel Hyd£ went, as was her custom, to tbe warm, cozy boudoir where , the tea aw&ited; her, Lad/ Castlemaine looked at her in wofider. Isabel,'' she cried " how ill yoa look Youhav^ lost all your beaatilul colour. You deserve to lose yonr name ; yon are not at all like a Ead E&se;—and you are , trembling, actually itrembliflg." ' -do.not eeeanything wondeifal in that, Gertrude; anyone might tremble on a cold : December afteAoon." "Iwill gir6 you some hot tea," said Lady Castlemaine. " Budolph s&id; he would join ns." " Se oame, looking eo handsome, so brave, Bo^nd,-andhiB eyes were so full of admiration and love for his >ife, that Isabel could hardly bear it. 1 "Lead us not into temptation 1"' Yet she hafl oome there purposely to be tempted herself, and to tempt bthers. -That dairk winter afternoon, as she watched guileless, inhooent love, the simple happiness of husband and wife, she repeated her vow. She would part them; come what-might, cost what it would, ehe would part thfem, for ever andaye, * \- But how was it to be done ? Spirits of envy and hate help and aid her 3 How waB it to be done? CHAPTER XV. SHE EK0S ASH QUEENS OF ENGLAND. Thfe Christmas week was ended, yet none of the guests .felt inclined to leave Neath. The holiday had been so pleasant—every variety of old English sport and pastime had been in requisition—charade parties, balls, private theatricals; they had almost turned night into day ; yet, the day was not long enough. It was a time never to be forgotten by those who enjoyed it. Lady Castlemaine and Miss Hyde were the two queens ; Lady Castlemaine young, beautiful, gifted with high spirits, al- ways bright, always ready to en joy every thing to its IQliest extent, was the leader of tfc6 revels. > „ Isabel Hyde;, beautiful and graoefal, too, followed her lead, and no one knew of the shadow of tragedy that hung over her, or of her terrible vow. . " I have been so happy here," she said, one inotning, "'that I shall not like going away." You need not go away; stay until the end of January; I shall be delighted, and I am <BDre Budolph will." Her lieart aohed just a little at her own tteaehery; the'fair face looked so Emiiingh' into hers; the blue eyes were so clear and guileless ; the invitation had been bo cordiillj given. "Yet she knew that her only object in stopping with them was, that Bhe might work her cruel will find part them. Good impulses came to her at times and pleaded for them— pleaded to her to go away and le&ve; them— to put Lord Castlemaine out of her life—to be true to the beautiful woman whom she called friend. What harm had they done to her ? Lsdy Castlemaine had not taken her love from her by-treachery; neither had the earl been her lover, for the love was all on her side, not on his: he had never even-been oonstsious of it. There were times even now when she almost Wished that she had let him see. how much she loved hiin,; and yet she would have lowered her own self-respect, and lowered it in vain, for from the moment he beheld Gertrude he had neither eyes nor ears for any one else. . * I do not think," ehe B&id.; to herself, bit terly, " that if I had gone on my knees to him, to pray of him to marry me ; that if I had been as •beautiful as Venus, and descended like a queen, that he would have married me." - There were times when ehe gave herekf np to wondering over the. strange problems, of life; as to why it was thai fehe, who could nave been -so happy,, should find the whole world so dark and dreary b&c;&nse; the love of her life w&a; given to oca who did not love her, She never reminded hez&lf; that it was her own fault—that she had voluntarily and willfully encouraged that love to grow in her heart, khowiAg it to be useless; that she had given free rein to a passion that .should have beta crushed at .the firfi$. : She blamed Providence, circumstances, fate, chance—any wad everything, exoept herself. * Of all the impalses that came jto her, of all fee' good thoughts and the bad thoughts, done were strong enough to oauee her to falter in her purpose. . Her purpose in life was to flepat&tehusband; and wife—to kill the ?reat love that lay between them, and put> i8te hi its place. . She worked, peiMveriflgly .'and 'indaptriouBly ;^hefa6verallo wedthe lightest chanoe to pass. • . * • .. _ • If she looijld possibly make Lord Castleinaine impatient with his; wife, S &He; could irritate him agiainst her, 'if she could rouse obstinaie self-will that was so Strong within him, die would beVappy. ' " If, by some latching taunt, soma sharp, cynical remark, she coold rouse Gertrude's pride agajntt her husband, she felt one degree nearer victory* Yet it was all done with sueh Bkill, such craft, such subtlery that it was impossible for her. t&be; detected. She never losjfc one chance. > One mftBoing lrtrd and Lady Castlemaine, Mibs Pyde, and several other visitors, were together and were discussing tableaux vivants for the evening. . Lst us have one tableau from that most pio'tureeque period of English history, the xeignof Henry the Eighth," said Lady Castlemaine: She turned to her hulband with a smile. " Which of all .King Henry's wives do you prefer ?">' she asked. He was . silent for a few minutes, then he replied: " Catharine of Aragon," "And lji' she iaid, ''prefer AnneBoleyn. I do not believe any pf the scandals about her. ' She was a beautiful, unhappy woman. Anne Boleyn Is one of -my favorite'heroines In history." • : " There is one thing about her that I can never understand," said Isabel Hyde," and it Is, ho* the king could hate her so deeply after "loving her so much." \ There yon touch upon a strange metaphysical 'question," said Lord" Castlemaine. "It is/said that love turned to hate is tbe most bitter hate 0! all." I cannot imagine hating any one who has been dearly loved," cried Lady Castlemaine. t " J ® an >" interrupted IsabeL "I agree with Lord CaBUemaine; love turned to hate is tbe moist bitter hate of all." "You remember,"said Lord Castlemaine, 'that most expressive line: "Hdl knows no fury like a woman scorned." He apoke quite unconsciously, not thinking at all of Miss Hyde. But she gave him one glance—it said ao much that if any one had interpreted it, that person must have understood the position at a glance.. " Love turned to hate," sighed Lady Castlemaine; " the idea is a vety powerful one. I wonder if there Is much wasted love in the world." Yes," saidlsabelHyde, bri be quite «ufe,of that." •yoaouf •'You must/read Evangeline," eaid Lord Castlemaine, apd see; wh&t; Longfellsw says abont wasted ejections. He declares that affection never in wasted." " I/do cot bfeiiete," eaid Isabel Hjfde, " that he coold prove his wotde. Bat 4re goiflf a long way from Anee Boisja. Yon tvonid like a plctnfe ftoto that m65t troubled^iiina, Lotd Castlemaine ; , ' . . • " YeS," ho flftid ; " I hftte often thought how interesting a series of histsfteal tableaux would be—one taken from e3.Bh reign.- It would be ifitereetiSg and amoslog." " Y-OU wouldb6King Henry," said Isabel; " but, Lord Castlemaine, you do not look IBs part. King Henry was ftlr, and. florid, a ad stout; yon &te; d&fk;, and—and—I was goid^ to add, handsome; but I must not say that." ' She added in her own mind that he had indeed the grand, dark beauty that pictures give to Spanish kings, and her eyes told her thoughts plainly. "If wa have that tableaux,""said Lady Castlemaine, " I should like to be Anne Boleyn am sure I could act a-character that is familiar to'me, and one tbatl like." "AndI," saidIXiBsHyde, "shouldlike to be Catherine of Arr&gon.;" " She was old and plain," interrupted Lttdy Castlemaine. r t She was his wife," replied Isabel; ",he loved her first and best; he loved her well and faithfully—for how many years ?" "H? loved Anne Boleyn more in the few years of his wooing and his marriage, than he did Catherine, spreading his love over all those years." "I wonder," said Isabel, "which of his wives he really loved the best. Eftch one seemed to have separate and different characteristics. .Catherine was 'every inchaqfleen,' a royal lady, true to God, and to duty. What she must have, suffered when she found her husband's love going from her to one so young and beautiful as Anne—the tortures of jealousy, the fear, and the doubts. I should say that no woman ever suffered more." " I Iwpe not," said Lord Castlemaine. "Then," continued Isabel, "comes your favourite, Lady Castlemaine. Her one characteristic seems tp have been her' bright, wonderful beauty—her laughing, coquettish nature. , But what a short-lived triumph ! While the king wooed Jane Seymour, how she must have suffered in her torn all, the agonies that she inflicted on Catherine 1" " Jane Seymour must have been very beautiful," said Lady Cks^emaine. " She was young, fresh, and fair, history says. I should think she was shrewd and calculating. She had seen a queen deposed to make rbom for Anne Balsyn, and she 'resolved that .Anne should be .deposed for her« I do not think that I care much for her; a colourless character, I think." "Then"conies a character whom no one loves—a character without romance or.poetry" —Anne of Cleves. I ha7S often wondered where Cleves is." ' " She walked in and walked out of history," laughed Isabel Hyda. "Then comes a wife for whom I have always felt- greatest sorrow, sympathy, and pity—that pretty, wilful child; Catherine Howard; ehe was but ia child. I was reading somewhere, the other day, that the night before.her execation her cries,were so terrible and,so appalling, that strong men who'heard them trembled. ' " I wonder," cried Lady.Csstlemaine," that the whole nation did not rise up to a man and tear the monster from the throne. That is the most wonderful part of his history to me—thkt he was allowed to live." • " Then comes the last wife of all, Catherine Parr. I always think of her as 'a motherly woman; dressed in gray or brown, and much given-to-serious reading." " Perhaps- on his death-bed," Baid Lady Castlemaine, "he saw tbe ghosts of his ctead wiveB-*Catherine, whom he tortured to death by breaking her heart; poor murdered Anne , Boleyn; Catherine Howard, slain in her early' youth; Jane Seymour, whom he forgot as soon as she waa dead. How, which of theses wives did he love best ? " " Catharine of Arragon—4here can be no doubt of it," saidLord CastlemaLce. " She was the love of his life—ifcey were but the loves of an hour." v , " Do you think a man ever has twploveB in his life?" asked Isabel Hj/.e, and she looked with a clear, straight glance into the earl's eyes. , No," was the pronrpt reply; " every man ha3 one love that is aboveall others, and which is never repeated; " and he, in his tnrn, lopking at his beautiful young wife; seemed to say, " Such loVe as is mine for you?' • , >Thia did not please Isabel, who could read his thoughts as plainlj as ahe could hear the outspoken words of others. She turned the conversation back to its own channel. " I wonder," the- said, slowly, "whatpeople woold do in these days if an English king behaved in such, a way." " ^ "They wonldgivB him shor$ shrift," said Lord Castlemaine, quickly.

Hot an invitation jfas refused, despite the 'disadvantage of wind and weather. '. . f. The tableaux were to be held in what was onee a magnificent banqueting roam, in the days.when the Castlsmaines entertained the kings and queens pf England.

He WES clever and keen, and- the strange thicg was that he bad no idea, not the faintest suspicion, that Isabel Hyde was or had been in love with him. CHAPTER XVII. c THE MILLS O? GOD. ^ Most young married people take some time to understand each other, to fall into each other's ways, to learn to forebear, to be patient With each other's faults. Lord and Lady Castlemaine were no exception to the t freneral rule. They had diiferences of opinion. -The hefband, although he spoke at times impatiently to fciswife, loved her jjassionately. Lady Castlc-malce, although at times' wanting in patknee and kindness, had the same great devotion ior her husband. They quarrelled -sometimes, they differed in opinion, they uttergd a'few sharp, hasty words; then they kissed and made friends, just like other husbands and wives. They were perfectly happy in. thelr married lifehappy ' in the present, and hopeful for the future. . It was nearly the of January before the gay party assembled at Neath Abbey diapersed; and up to that time "Isabel Hyde had made no progress with the fulfillment of her vow. She was, if possible,, more deeply in love with Lord Castlemaine than ever.*. ..The short, fleeting hours when, on the stage, she had acted'the part of hi3 wife, had done her / incalculable harm. She seemed never to forget the event, and it led her into a half-fami liar -kind of manner with him' .that -would have aroused the jealousy of ,8Gme wives; but Lady Castlemaine never seemed to notice it.. \ : They wete both grieved to part with her; they had begged her to stay longer with them, but she had answered, laughing/ "I must go sometime; I cannot stay always. I cannot live with you, but I would if I could." "The only comfort is that we shall see you in town. We are going early. Perhaps Lady Cresfion will let yoa oome to us fot a few wetka then." ^ v ' . • ^ That would be -delightful!" said Isabel Hyde, with a smile that was so muph Greek to Lady Castlemaine. . r J The carriage was at the door; the white snow lay frozen on the ground; the Tob1n<redbreasta flitled about on the bare bbnghs; the sky was blue and cloudless, and the wind soughed around the grand old walls—a bright, bsatitiful winter's day. Lord Castlem&ine; was going* to drive Miss Hyde to Eedmosfe station. Other guests had been driven by the coachman,, but flhe had looked in her host's face when the manner and time of her going wis mentioned. "You will drive ine?" she epid. "How many happy rides and drives I have had with yon 1 and this will "be thelast 1" ! " The last for a time," he replied. * -'Ihope we shall, often ride togethet in Lohdon." Do yon really hope that ?" die asked. Assuredly I do," was the reply. in a tone : of wonder;-. •'••'] '••' - .'

"Yea can never again be'a rival; you are victorlgins." . " We shall not be rivals; we never were, in that sfnse of tbe Word. Isabel, you will not foiget one thing—that you have 'called me friend ?" - • ''I.iht-J! rot forget it," Bhe" replied, with a peculiar smile. . The greatest pleasure to me of thfe coming sea op is that I shall see you again," said Lady Gtetlemaiiie, as she kissed the face Pf the girl thivt was to bring euoh unutterable woetoher. • • And so with a tiss, false as the Mes ol Ju^as, they parted. That evtKifig, over her dressing-room fire, Gsrtrude, with her husband, diBCoesed Isabel Hyde. ^ . ^ ' " She seenw m very much attached to us," ssid Lady Cistkmaine, " I think myself quite fortunate in having found su<rti a frand. You have known' her some time, Budplpb ; how is it .you did not fall in love with her?" 11" he replied, easily.

As they drove away, to the last his eyes lingered on her, and when they could see her no longer, he began to talk about-her, and ; every word that he uttered waa in loving praise of her. Isabel Hyde had to listen and respond. Most.people would have been quite daunted. She was going away; it vras uncertain, to say the least of it, when they would meet again, and he had no thought for. her; his heart andmindWerefullofhiswile. Even atthexsQraad station, when he-had arranged hex travelling rags, seen that she had the most oomfortublp Beat in a first-class car, when he brought papers and .periodicals to ampse her daring thejoutney. when he had shaken hands with her and had bidden .her' - good-by, ehecouldtellthat histhoughtswera still with Gettrude ; |or he came back to her just as the train was starting—not, as she fondly imagined, to spsaka few kind words ' io her, a last fare veil, bat to eay: " Do you think j Gertruda is looking as well as she did in town?" Her patience gave way as she answered;. " Yea, I think she looks as well as U is possible for her to look." But if she intended her answer to be sarcastic, her sarcasm w&s; all lost, entirely lost on Lord Castlemaine, in whose eyes hia wits always looked beautiful. - Then the train went on its way, and soon left Neath Abbey far behind. • > . . - 1 Isabel went with a sense of failure; and ' now, as she'sat in her room alone, Bhe was face to face with the knowledge that although s^e had brought all the power of her mind to bear on het purpose—that of making mischief between husband and wife, and, of ulti> mately parting them, she bad ignpminiously failed. • . \- She Bat for some time in' silence.; "then she clenched her white hands.
