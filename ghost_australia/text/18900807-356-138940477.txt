A Ghost Story in Court. Ax application was made recently before Lord Justices Bowen and Fry, sitting in the Court of Appeal, London, in re Jackson, deceased-Jackson .v. Braithwaite. The plaintiff seeks to upset the will of his late brother, who died in Durham, worth about £80,000. The cause was set down for trial at the Durham Assizes, but the venue was changed to Middlesex, and on Mr. Justice Butt refusing to reverse the order the plain tiff appealed. Mr. Walton, Q C., for the appellant, said one reason given by the defendant for the necessity to change the venue was the existence of a ghost story, to the effect that the ghost of the deceased told the sexton that he inadvertently left a Dissenting body £2000, which he meant for the Church. (Laughter.) Lord Justice Fry: Will the ghost be called as a witness. (Renewed laughter) Lord Justice Brown: Can what a ghost says to a sexton be taken as evidence against anybody P Mr. Walton had no experience on that point. Mr. Inderwick, Q C., opposed the applica tion; but their lordships thought, under all the circumstances of the case, the cause should be tried in the North, where all the witnesses were, and whore the deceased lived and died. An order was imade accordingly.
