Arno Bay. Sept.25—We^have made another step forward in the march of civilization—we have bad an auction sale. It was remarkable also, as the celebrant's maiden effort. It' was a bit of a comedy in Its way too. I saw two members of oue firm running one another up as fast as the auctioneer could take their bids, and one old fellow kept on advancing on his own bid.

I do not s y that we have better laud- ihau you have, but there is certainly more to pick from. Our lo f lands appear to be n u h the sam- as th land ou your side, but we have a back bone J Highlands, full of springs, with fine ncn gullies, fit for market-gardens. The hills, howeier, are rough, and what is strange, one side is generally fertile, while the other is barren. There is a" Farmer's Association here, but as the members have begun pounding one another's cattle—great aud small — I do not think there is that harmony among them, such institutions are calculated to promote. ' One leading member told me that when he started the sowing machine last May a whole pack of pigs belonging to another member, broke into full ciy after him, one half catching the seed in their open mouths the others acting as gleaners, and not leav ng one grain to show where the machine had been. Then followed impounding, damages and reprisals. Ah ! me, tbat quarrels should result from such trift.s.
