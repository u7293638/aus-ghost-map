ECHOES OF MELBOURNE '.'.'? (By, the Ghost.) \- During the week the proceedihgWin Par liament have been more than usually, in teresting. : The Govern ment has sustained its first defeat, having been beaten oh a division by 35 votes to 28. on an important olause of the Irrigation Bill. The question at issue was whether there should be ' free grants to water trusts, ananne Assembly being in an economical mood resolved that all monies required to carry out the details of the various Irrigation schemes should : simply beradvanced by' way of loans bear- ' ing interest.' ';Oneof the most important ' propositions 'of the. 'Government ? has thus .' been1 negatived j^ an^d'1 as it : appears, from the tohe'of the'1 Assembly that some of the,' otlior proposals in the Irrigation measure are,equally distastefulto the House, 'i there is every probability , that by, the time, the. Bill hn s been submitted to the , , . ' tinker- - ing' of both branches of the Legislature. it it -n ill bear so small a resemblance to Mr.1 ' Deakin's original that even the authors of its existence will have some difficulty; in, recognising their handiwork. ,- As both the ?
