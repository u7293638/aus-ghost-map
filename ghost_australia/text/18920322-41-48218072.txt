WTTXTAMS IN SYDNEY. When ' Williams' first arrived in Sydney (says the Evening News of March 18) he was taken up by a friend who originally oame from the same nart of Ensrland. This friend took him to a boarding-house at Middle street, Chippendale, kept by a highly respectable widow. The friend found employment for 'Williams' at Tooth's Brewery; but this positson he did nob hold long, as he quarrelled with his superior. He afterwards opened up a little business in Castlereagh-streeb, which abruptly ended with his arrest for theft, and a sentence of six months' imprisonment followed. While residing with the widow he was always talking of his 'dear wife, Marion,' who he said was in England, and for whose companionship he longed. This lady arrived in Sydney while ' Williams' was in prison. He was accustomed to sleep with Marion's photograph beneath his pillow. He was remarked for his consistency in attending St. Paul's Church. The widow was eventually obliged to get rid of ' Wil liams,' on account of his mysterious manner, and particularly for his whining complainings that 'a ghost haunted his room at night time.' On one occasion he rushed downstairs to his landlady, and, in a state of real or acted terror, said that he waa intercepted on the stairway by ' the ghost.' It afterwards came to light thab ' Williams,' who incidentally let oub that the second name ho bore ab that time— 'Bailey' — was the name of his mother's people, stole clothing and other effects fiom the mate employed on tho vessel that brought ' Williams' hero.
