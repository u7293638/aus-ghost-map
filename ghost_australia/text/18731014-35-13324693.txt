AN ICEBERG. (A Fragment from Sydney Matt.) An endless waste of waters But one morn The cry is heard, " An iceberg heaves in sight." Yes, there on the horton's verge it glooms ! Like snowy mountains rising from the sea, Transparent white yet tinged with faintest blue Of sunrise light Nearer it seems to come, Changing each moment- now an icy peak, And then a castle silvery in sunlight, A pyramid blue-tinted or at lost ' An opal fortress, darting myriad lights, With gilded pinnacles and towers that glow All rainbow-tinted ; rich prismatic hues Playful illuming each translucent edge. j A joy throughout the day ! Untired men watch The ever-varying beauties, till at length The sun sinks down behind the mighty berg j Transforming crystal to clear amethyst, ยก Then kindling red fires on each icy point ยก Till like enchanted palace, genn wrought j In molten gold, in grand resplendent I Of nature's gem-work, now it stands . Basing with ruby and rose topaz, set Mid glittering diamonds. When the sunset glow j Has fainted into night, as vanishing ghost White, shimmering cold, seen on the indigo place Of ocean waves, they catch one farewell glimpse Of this fair vision from antarctic zoneB. !
