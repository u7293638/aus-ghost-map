An Artful Beggar. A beggar who was sentenced to 14 days at Marylebone, by his methods would seem to have been a fisherman in hie better days A constable who watched the whole proceedings saw him throw a crust cf bread Into the road. He stood and waited till the fish he hoped to hook camo up. Presently a lady approached, auu me ueggar rusueu iuiv tuo iubu, snatched up the bread, and began to gnaw at it ravenously. Tho lady stopped, gazed sympathetically at the apparently hungry man, and gave him twopence. When she had passed by the man threw the bait into the road, with the samo happy result. Then be was arrested, and hie bag examined. He had on him thir teen pennies and a threepenny piece. That was a good return tor a crust of bread. Every day some new method of getting money out of the charitable is hit upon. Lately a man has boon going round with a placard stating that he lost his voice in trying to save a drowning child ; while another — and perhaps this is the most audacious statement a boggar ever made —lias 44 been a teototaller for 50 years, and was then run over by a brewer's dray." Do naught to-day thou maysl regret to morrow j For though to-day may die, its ghost will linger And haunt thee with a ceaseless sigh of sorrow, + And point remorse with an accusing finger. Say no unkindly word, or, lilre an ember lii a doad fire, a breath will blow it living ; Tho worst of puutahinente is to re member, When tears aro vain and wrongs are l»st forgiving.
