Mrs. Leighton : Biit Captain Thornton is - a chivalrous gentleman. Lady 'Chilhyorth;: Granted !

(Cheeking herself) At least,,I scarcely ■ think--I know what you 'mean.' i Lady Clii 11 worth (grimly) : Quite .right-.'.| Keep like that. Captain Thornton is a preys to the most acute form ofr lieart 'hunger, the hunger that gnaws the heart of a man debarred'by ihonour from .declaring liis love. A woman never.mis takes that. . Men tliink we don't know : whalf-they. feel for us unless we show them we know it. Oh, my dear, what a mistake:. I've been* through it.all/ ' :. Mrs. Leigliton : You ? J-Iow sad you •look. ■ ■■■■ •Lady Ohilhvorth (sighing) : 'Sad .' I've a woman's memory, child, heartless old i : worldling though I seem in the'eyes of a world that judges Tiy externals .! : Your | case . .brings back to me a memory of 'the past. OA pause.) •Mrs. Leigliton :: Won't you tell me about it ? ."Lady Chill worth : There's not much to tell. I married young, an undisciplined, girl, ignorant of . what love meant. When ■I grew- to womanhood there. came one into'my life, who changed the meaning i of existence for me. I loved him with i ;every fibre of my nature. Had he asked •jit I would have thrown every tie that, ■bound me to the winds.: But lie loved-i my fair name and.honour before all else, I and in the loneliness of old age, instead I of: a remembrance of the shame tnat i dings for over to. a stained life, .1 have i the- fair memory of-' a man's chivalry to I •live on. The woman who holds such a I 'infeinory in lier^heart is not quite the I .heartless old worldling, she seems. (A li>ause.)' • I '■ 'Mrsi. -Leigh ton (In a;soft voice) : I am ?So sorry for you. •'""Lady :Ohni'woi'tliThere, I'm; a- silly '61d ;.woman ! Don't , trouble iyour young •'heart about me, but loolc to yourself. Few women are so fortunately unfor tunate as I was.; Mine was an experi ence too wonderful; to occur sigul^ "so beware of friendship. Aire. Leigh ton : But Captain Thornton is such ■ a sympathetic fn'end, and: I look np to him. and trust -him so. 'Lady- ■"■ OhilH'wartflv:^And ' beware of. ' sympathy, too—It'is the .overture to love. -.. Mrs. Leighton : But I am a married woman.. We can't love—we musn't. Lady Chill worth : Mustn't! The word isn't in. love's vocabulary. Oh, there is Captain Thornton. See, even his good manners are severely tried at seeing you monopolised by any one else. I fancy I saw tlie ghost of a frown on Ms face when ho saw me. Good morning, Captain Thornton. And ilon't you in tend to do 'the Matterhorn this time ? Captain Thornton : No, I think I have done with the iMat'terhorn now, Laidy Chi'lhvoi'th. I have ascended it seven times. It has no more eharms for me. : Lady Chillworth : How man-like-! No thing but the unattained interests you men. "Well, we shall "meet at ta:ble-d' liote this evening, 1 dare say. I am go ing down to /,<:nn:i LI now. I hope to hear of the safe return of the mountain party when I come back. Good-bye. (Lady Chillworth nods to them, and leaves them alone together.) Captain Thornton : And so Mr. Leigh-; ton hiis gone to the Matterhorn after all? Mrs. Leighton : Yes, I tried hard to persuade him not. In his present j»tate: of-health I am sure he was not fit to hear the fatigue. Captain Thornton : I saw nothing of you all day yesterday. Mr.s. Leighton (tim'idly) : 'No, I—I stayed in my i;oom. I liad rather a dis turbed night. You see, Mr. Leigh ton started early with his guide for the Mal terhorn, and a lot of other people wont too, and the clatter and noise made me wakeful. Captain Thornton (after gazing at her): How pale you look, and—what's that—a bruise on your temple V That wasn't there last time I saw you. Mrs. (Leighton : Oh, it's really nothing —nothing at all. I—I fell—it was my own fault. I fell against the chest of drawers. ..Captain Thornton- (with great emo-. tlon).: Oh, my.-God—he struck you !' •Mrs.- Tjeighton - (faintly): No—no—in deed— indeed not. ""Captain Thornton (turns i away and ■looks ,out across. the valley to: hide his cinotion.^After a pause lie returns , to : her, and, taking botlv her hands in his,, speaks with an effort: at' self-restraint) : I am so dreadfully sorry for you, I—I can scarcely trust myself to speak to you ; 'hut if the knowledge - that 'you have a devoted friend who. would, ^ladlv face death for you is any .help, hear it from my.lips. Mrs". LOighton (looking lip into his face with tears-in hereyfcs) : ires, indeed it is a help, a great,help.1; I :cannot.tell you ■haw great."
