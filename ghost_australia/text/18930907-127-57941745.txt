AN ODE TO THE MODERN WALTZ. -0 .'Tis a kind of mild gyration, 'Tistin ' Military Waltz,' A sort ol marce fune&re;, mixed With some very sudden halts. As your partner, vainly striving To revolve; is forced to stop ; And your manly arm is aching, ::Add you're nearly fit to drop. W i?ileme~maoinent?,are sominelting,.:._-_: \- And 1you'canft account at all, For the ponderous persistence Of the ' Fairy' of the ball. Her weight is but a trifle, If she steps upon the scale ; She looks so like a zephyr That you crowd on every sail. With a feeling of elation, With a consciousness of power, You go for:twenty yards at least, At forty knots an hour. But a deadly drag is on you, And alas ! your dream is false, For you find you have to wrestle With the Military Waltz. This waltz, which isn't waltzing, But a dreary dull parade Of automaton-like figures, Looking some what ' ready-made.' As they zigazag, slide and shuffle, Turn twice round, and then appear As if they ' really, had to stop,' They felt ' so very queer.' Where is the old time waltzing I And the waltzers, where are they I Here's a lady fair I waltzed with Twenty years ago to-day. 'We'll try a turn for ' auld lang syne,'' She smiled, and took my arm, She weighed about two hundred pounds, But he waltzing was a charm. Her. form was somewhat solid, Yet her step was light as air, As we floated round the room I thus Apostrophised the fair. This is the good old waltzing, . Thus in the days of yore, Our steps beat time to the music, On many fet fn For your waltzing is just di vine, Your weight like the ghost of a feather, Which I reckon a gracious sign. Your style is correct and none other, Then she sighed as she told of a youth, Who said, 'she waltzed like his mother,' And he possibly told the truth. -Frank Morbley.
