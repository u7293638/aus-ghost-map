It appears that Mr. J. H. Want promised,, when at Woolgoolga recently, to have the wishes of the Woolgoolga people rospectod, but lie apparently forgot all nbout tho matter. It is said that tho lessee is to pay tho Government £175 per annum, although the total dues last year amounted to only nbout £90. It is scarcely just anyhow that wharfage dues should bo levied at. Woolgoolga, Coif's Harbor, and ono or two other places, ns nt present, while other wharves arc practically free. ? At Saturday night's meeting at Woolgoolga Mr. A. E. Wheat-ley, who is secretary to tho Progress Committee, made a lengthy, vigorous, nnd tolling speoch in denunciation of the leasing business. * * * * * * » * Mr. McMillan, M.P. for Bnrwood, wns in England during our last general election ; he is tliero again now. Few members have done less than McMillan for their money, and we should not bo surprised if some of the peoplo's money hns not beon given him in the shape of expenses for tho trip home — to get rid of him ns n too candid friend of Reid nnd Co. Of course he is ' nt homo' on private business, but then he may 'make inquiries' 'tis to the finances of tho colony and tho state of tho Agpnt General's department.;. That's the way thoy work these - trips homo ot the ox penso oF tho'pooplo oF this colony. At any rate Bnrwood appears to bo nbout sick-oF tho small but able McMillan, and the courteous aiid dignified financier will probnbly be seen no moro in Parliament as Burwood's champion. A Bnrwood alderman named Arclicr has beon asked to contest the seat, and n requisition asking him tivdo so has beon signed by 7 u0 electors. At u big meeting recently in Bnrwood it was urged on beltalF oF Mr. Archer's candidature that Burwood had been- practically without a member sinco Mr. McMillan was elected tlioro six years ago. A Mr. White referred to Mr. McMillan as ' simply a store keeper's ghost:', Jf any one overiwnnted to find' him ho had to fight liis way through an army of chu'ks aiVil a- fe^': country storekeepers, only to lind on Mr. McMillan's door tho word 11 En gaged.'
