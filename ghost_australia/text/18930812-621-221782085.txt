IKe Benalla filiost Story. W The "spooks" are apparently taking up their abode In the colony, And their first performance at Benalla is really a very creditable effort. The whole story , indeed, is a fine typical ghpst tale, with a murder in it ; a concealed corpse ; vague terrors and apparitions yrhich frighten people from passing after sunset by a erven spot ; and, finally, a dream which leads to the firep ace of a deserted hut being dug up, and human bones being found ! All the materials are here for a ghost story of the most delightful quality ; and one, too, which has a more solid substratum of fact about it than such tales usually have. The father named J ordan, a man of furious passion, undoubtedly lived in this hut with his half-witted son. The youth mysteriously vanished ; the fatht r was vehemently suspected of having mur dered him, and the police made diligent inquiry in the matter without results. The hut was burned down, apparently by accident , the suspected murderer died ; vague and terrifying traditions gathered in time round the spot. As the result of a dream, some neighbors a few days ago dug up the fireplace of the old hut, and actually found some bones hidden there which are, of course, vehemently suspected to be those of the murdered lad. If all this proves to be the case, the story will of course yield joy to Mr Stead and the Society of Psychical Research ; but even if the bones prove human, and the dream thus unlocks the mystery of a shocking crime, wiil it be necessary to ac cord any credit to the "spooks." It seems obvious that thegloomy recollections which huQg round the deserted hut, assisted by a suggestion from Deeming's methods, might easily prick the imagination of half a hundred people in the neighbor hood .into activity ; and, assisted by a touch of indigestion, set a whole world of dreams into operation ubout this particu lar hut. We need not, after all, postu late the " spooks " to explain the- story.
