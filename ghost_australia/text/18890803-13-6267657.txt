THE MALLEE COUNTRY. BY TELEMACHUS. The north-east corner of Victoria—a country that is bounded on the south, by an irregular line drawn about midway between the 36th and 37th parallels of latitude, on the north by the River Murray, on the west by South Australia, and on the east by a line which might run 10 miles easterly still of long. 143. It is not a patch of country, not a corner, in the ordinary acceptance of the term, but nn area of 150 miles by lbO miles ot the least, containing not less than 25,000 aunare miles It is a country that people generally know very little about, that nobody has done much good with, that has broken the banka of many men, the b»arta of not a few, that contains the skeleton and the ugly ghosts of many a bright dream It is haunted by the spirit of the heritage of our desolation , it is endurable only to those who love the wilderness, or wno dauntlessly labour for its redemp tion It waa through many years an absolute terra incot/mta-an unapproachable country to people of the metropolis, and the tame lauds of the coast. But now, our rail ways run right to ita edge, and any man who deanes to know what the mallee is like can train to Wycheproof, or Donald, or Dim boola, or Warracknabeal, and from any of tbe little inland billa,which rise near to most of these townships, look out and behold the monotonous leaf sea, which rolla away to the limits of viaion, and only breaks into the alluvial plains by the Murray, or about the lakes, great and email, freah and salt, which receive the northern flowing rivers, or mark their mysterious courses to the Murra), to« ords which they all tend lhere ia not much tobe learned by such a look at the mullee, the wilderness oi dull green leaves, of ragged brown alalka, seeming to afford nothing more nutritious or usetul than the arid soil winch produees them 'íbey are too stiff to move wave like to any wind that may pass over and through them, nor under any circumstances do they yield any music or pleasant forest sounds 'lhere is a dry sort of rustle, like the luarticulate murmur of many parched tongues, from the leaves, and the innumerable strips and shreds of de id bark beat against the eterna like the wasting gar ments agninat the bonea ot a gibbet 'Hie broad wing of an eagle ia frequently seen against the dismal earth garment or the glorious blue of the sky, and black crows are frequent, their croaka according well with the eerie runtlo of the bark shreds l_ven on n, first look it is easy to understand and to realise the many old atones of demented belated buahmen lost III this horrid waste, the gradual increase of the fever of thirat, the madness ot fear, the feeble attempts to steer a straight course of the urst day or two, the wild rushes which followed, and then the invariable casting away of every Bhred of cloth ing, and the headlong fall in utter exhaustion, which left the bund body tor the dingo s tooth and the beak of the crow, and by and by a skeleton or a few scattered bones, with nothing to give the faintest clue to identity. Many and many a tragedy of that sort has occurred between any of those southern hill tops and the distant banks of the Murray And yet there are evidences that the blacks have from time immemorial ranged over the mallee Tor b0 milos north from tho edt,e of the great desert we cross on the overland journey to Adelaide their wells and the signa of their old en campments are eeen Thence they seem al wa) a to have struck north east, making to the Murray, probably by the underground channel of the Wimmera Uiver, whose course can sometimes be traced by shallow surface Jakes, and always by those indications ot water near to the surface which the blacks know so well, 'Uley had pleasant camp nig grounds in their wmtir pilgrimages, for frequent throughout the mallee there are sand ridges with grovea of pines and little grassy plains about them Hie numerous dead pine boughs make the best of fuel, and tbe easily broken pine folinge good beds or thatch for gunjulla, and wallaby or kangaroo, or emu, would be easily enough taken, and the sandhills are in all weathers dry und warm The blacks would never approach Lake 'lyrrell, which lies u hundred miles to the east, shallow and salt and dreary, the whole body of water moving with the wind, spreading sometimes on a rough night over miles of apparent desert floor.rightuptotheÜreaandtentBoftnuellera, who have encamped far enough uw.i.i on the previouse>ening,atotbersreccdiiigas if drawn ti) tidal influence, and leaving other dreary miles But often they would encamp about other, fairer lakes, Hindmarsh on tho one aide, Boort and Lulbert on the other, with all their contiguous waters, which, in such )eurs a« this, team with tish, and an arm with iviUtowl 'lo the win/ ot their boomerangs then, as to the crack of a gun or the hoof beato! a horse now, lens ot thousands of swans, of native companions, of ibis, crane, pelican, geese, ducks ot all sorts would rise with sounding flight Louder the Bound Beems at times on a frosty night than the heat of ten thousand hoofs on the plain, thunderous and long continued, und breaking ultimately into mun) diverse GoundB , greater und lesser »plushes far out in the Mater, swift passing whistles of mr cutting wings, mid clamorous Uight tar aloft of mutahalleJ lloeks making to other rnercB.

The rabbita entered into pos eeBsioii ot the mallee 'len years ago tiley wire in possession, and BIÏ jeiirs ago they hud ao far destroyed the country that nobody tared to take up and hold it undor the tenuro then obtainable 'Hie rabbita made food for the dingoes, the eagle hawks and crowe Ihese ghoula of the wilderness were never so pinched by lamine as to take the poisoned bait, however seductively spread In droughtjears they increased therefore, and sad WIIB the havoc amongst tho II iclcs. Ju some few instances the old process of Bhep herding b) day and jarding by night was resorted to, in cithers the stations were deserted, the whole of the stock having wasted away. Drovers then saw dozens of ted eye balls gleaming within gunshot ot their flrea, und no man in tho eampgot much Bleep titi the open country waa reached It was ver) evident that a new order had hu conn, necessarj, and that thu mallee, ii it was to be conquered, muBt be attacked in other waj s, Gmduull), and III many ways, that new attuck has been proceeding borne tho roughly enterprising squatters have taken advantage of every opportunity reasonable legislation und invention ot new means hrive afforded. A fnir rental and tenure wera the first essentials, and tlie.o over all but the very poorest-the desert or heath count.} have now been granted. Then came the cheap supply of wire netting and barbed wire The one rendered it possible to fence out the rabbits, the other the dons. And when once a man had only his own ground to deal with lie wont to work with a will. Many mistakes were made, and much money wasted 'lhe ordinary rabbtters became in some instance, capitalists, m others thieves and spreaders of the plague they were engaged to subdue They did not do so much in this way in Victoria as in New South Wales, lor financial matters were a little better managed here We were not familiar with " tour m hand " rabbiterB, or with instances of parties of half a dozen, after eighteen months' work, returning tilth bank drafts for two thou-und pounds and " loose cheques for a hundred or ttvo to spend along the road " Still, more than £200,u00 was ex pended on the Victorian mallee, and not to much purpose till the uew sort of squatters began to lence in and dig out, lind poison Pioneers of another sort are the liborious selectors-the farmers who have taken up the rich mallee land, and discovered that under proper management it can be easily cleared, «ntl will grow iiiiiHinlicent wheat Another, in his own peculiar wnj, was our good friend, Mr liosisto, inventor and manufacturer ot the world renowned eucalypti extract, and 5 et another was the first exporter of mallee roots as fuel. These, with the managers of the great experiment at Mildura, are now en- gaged m subduing that north western pro vince of our colony, and I think if we come to understand them and their work a little better we shall be prepared to afford them a little more sympathy, and to help them in their work in every reasonable and practical manner. We may as well take a first glance at the squatters The. were first to come, and till the great problems of possible and prolitablo irrigation are worked out they must continue to hold the bulk of the mallee country. What are they doing, and what is their life' I have recently been privileged to meet in the mallee two fairly representative men of the squat ting class One, Mr Lascelles, who has been, perhaps, theforemostof practical pastoral men in dealing with the rabbifplague m Australia. Another, his neighbour, Mr Cumming, who with small means but 11 big heart, has been holding on to a mallee block and fighting what he hopes to be n winning battle Mr Laacelles's mallee station 13 Laka Coorong, into which Hows the Yarrambiack Creek, in the old days occasionally filled by a Hooded Wimmera, noiv regularly supplied by a stream drawn off from the river aboie the weir. The station has an area of ölC square miles, a few hundred acres of which are pleasant and beautiful plains about the edge of the lake, but the bulk mallee, the vast areas ot scrub, the occasional sand hills and plains, with clumps ot pines and patches tit gras* It is a great estate, but to its working there is expended an amount of capital, of knowledge, of care, and ceaseless watchfulness which take every penny of profit remaining at the year's or the de cade's end The rabbit anti mallee proof fence had first to be put right about, and then the work of rabbit and dingo destruction to be scientifically begun and persevered in, 'trapping and lerreting were speedily given up, the bonus plan was found to encourage, and indeed create, too much fraud To di,; out and to poison were the only expedients, and these have been found tolerably successful The rabbits take the phosphonsed oats pretty freely in a bud season, mid in good years, which have on'y occurred at intervals, the 1 dort has been to attack every burrow with the spade Ten years of labour of this sort have practical I) redeemed the place, and in cessant watchfulness may maintain it as an "interest paying " proper... Not a place to knock a fortune out of, or an> tiling of that sort There are no fortunes in the ninllee, lit least be. ond the limits of irrigation Lolome-i. Nor must it be supposed that when the fence is once erected and the vermin subdued within that the task is t nded. A most thorough 3) eteni of boundary tiding, or rather 01 fence inspection, must be m untamed Thin, wiry, sallow com plexioued boundary riders, mounted on horses hard na themselves, and with no more «pare flesh about them, travel along every mila of fence every day m the year, with a tool or two and 11 small coil 01 wire in their Baddle bags They are of no use if not absolutely faithful, for there can be no effective and immediate supervision over Hiern They must see any break that is made, and repair it forthwith. A day or two of neglect might spoil years of labour And not infrequently noes a break occur An emu goes at the fence, and is slung bick, but his toe catches in it mesh of the net. He sn igs away till some- thing guts, or perhaps till he bnnselt is exhausted or killed In either case, there are jobs 01 cobbling to be done, which fall ot course to the boundary rider And still oc- casionally a dog will creep in, ami who can suppose that in an est ite of ~> IO square miles tvery one cm be hunted out' It is astonish ititi, lion ever, how lew remain, und the pains which are taken to secure them There is but one effective »ii) and but one sort of man fit tor it. Now aim then 111 almost ei erj community of Uritish folks a man is found with a keen und irrepressible sporting in- stinct If his special functions are not used, he fn quentl) becomes a nuisance to all his neighbours Ina dingo country such a man is invaluable. 'I rained from hiS)OUtn up in the back block», he can truck like an) black- fellow Show lum the faintest footprint of a dog and he will tell jou verj quickly what it is, dingo, or collie, or half breed, whether it is hunting or sneaking, und it he is really on business there is very little hope from thut moment ot that dog's life, lie will follow him daj alter (la>, »ill eventually find out Ins lair, and plotting and watchinn', most assuredly get an opportunity soon to pull the trigger that secures his Bculp and hide A man of tins Bort baa a special value of course "I pay my man,' an.3 Mr Lascelles, "lour pounds, yes, four pounds sterling a head." It seems 11 big price " It is a big price, but I can trust him, and cannot do without him " Man) of the squatters pay two pounds, and the shire council one pound, a head, and a good many rascals make profit out ot the bonuses Take all cure of jour dog is stand- ing and necessary advice in the mallee, mid if .011 hine a litter of pups destroy all )OU do not want at once, or otherwise you will rob >our neighbours I hoard a true eton of a scoundrel »vho ehenhcrded 11 litter of seien ttll their heads were presentable, then killed them, carried the sculps a hundre I miles, and sold them for 111 lloiiiia giving! seems UIAIDB to work for evil, but still the dogs must bo Kept down There was a time in the niullee when Hocks of 10,000 were reduced by half by the dogs in a Bingle year, and even now the raro but mischievous hunters who live on rabbits and kill sheep for sport will do a hundred pounds' worth of damuge in one wild night. 'lo get and keep men of the proper sort as boundary riders and hunters, to make and maintain that costly fence, to get nil possible use out ot all the immense area, 10 average acres of which bardi) keep a sheep, to use every drop of water that the creek brings into the luke, to maka and keep dams in the back count.), to do all that is possible in the way of irrigation, and to stand prepared tor two or three rainless )ears, t£ tbey should ciune, and never lor a week to desist from the work of keeping din» 11 the rabbits-all these are the tusks which fall to Buch a squatter as Mr Lascelles, who tit the same time must keep a caromi hand also on the threads of many other business matters Ilia neighbours' labours aro less complex, but more arduous. I would quote Mr Cum ming, not asan exception, but a.one ot nellies. A gentleman ot some education who left Scotland for Australia, not by any means ex- pecting to find a soft place, butjothurdly realising the labours he would have to undergo in the mallee His capltal_was moderate, he lind of necessity to take Tip û very considerable area ot country, und from the beginning hm work was incessant anti his return so tar n bare living Harassed In his curlier years by uu.)rupathetic laws, the result of complete ignorance on the part of those who made them, plagued like an 1-gjptiun beneath the curses of Moses, be still struggled on, and hopes now he ia round tue corner He baa beat round against incessant head winds Many ot his memories and anecdotes are instructive to those loohsh people who think every pastoraliat is a prince How would j ou like to pick up the trick or a broken flock ot aheep on a wet night, to follow them up for CO hours without food und without a blanket-to do your own boundary riding atoot, when all the horses were starving with the drought-to pass a solid j ear without sight of a green vegetable or even a potato ' " I drove two four year old horses down to Donald,' said Mr Cumming, "and when they saw the running water in the Richardson they went cranky aa an in- land blacl- at the firat sight of the sea.
