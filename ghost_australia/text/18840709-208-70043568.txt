"Ah I hal Ye have. I aked yo not what â€¢maed the leasusre of that odoriferous em all." " Forgive me, the, 'gentle Horace. It was not I that ate the fragrant bulbs. It was me conscience." "Then, be all the gods on high Olympus, I will berevenged. Unbare thychaste bosom and with my trosty Toledo (0.) blade, I'll pierce 'that craven, treacherous, and vulgar tasted conscience to the heart." "Be it so, then. Horatio. I would not have it.
