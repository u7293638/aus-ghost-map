TIT BITS. : - , ' (to the editor.) Sir,— Under this heading, I am reminded of an error, I undoubtedly made in putting Belfast down for one member in the redistribution of Irish seats. - Belfast, Cork, and Limerick have each two members. I do not know how the seats are to be distributed, but it appears, that Ireland will return the same number of members to Par liament as usual. The Kiama Ghost.— Tell Phil Eooney, as I was one of those who helped to ' lay the Ghost,' I will (as soon as I can pull myself together, as I have not quite recovered from a recent bereavement) give him and others a true account, as they may not be aware of the terrible ordeal all genuine Irishmen had to go through during the time this fiendish attempt was made to blast their reputa tion in New South Wales by a lot of ruffians, some of whom are at present in the gaols of the colony ; others have to the present escaped incarceration, although richly deserving it ; and some have gone to the grave, of whom I will not say anything' that can be possibly avoided, in giving what may justly be called a brief history of designing men in New South. Wales during these trying times. I remain, &c;, TIMOTHY FOGAETY. Sydney, December 13, 1884.
