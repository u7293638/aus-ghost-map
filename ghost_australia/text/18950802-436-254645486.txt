A CHOST AT ELSTERNWICK. The Melbourne Herald says:â€”'"The inhabitants of E'stemwiek have again been thrown into a etate of excitement through the visits of what is termed * the ghost,' though no one seems to have actually eeen it at c'ose quarters. Oa Wednesday evening, however, at about 8 o'clock he was traced through different properties ia the Gleohuatly-rovi, and down to Orrong-road, and it is believed was followed by the lccal police and some persons living in the neighborhood, but was lost sight of about the corner of Allison-road, where he is said to have taken refuge at the bouse of a well-kuown resident. The first intimation the inmates recpived was tbe barking of tbe dog, but a search being made over the premises nothing unusual was found, and the parents went out, leaving a daughter and two boys of 8 aud 11 years of age at home. Shortly afterwards the daughter found the back door and the outer door of the kitchen open. All appeared quiet, and the daughter went to see a neighbor, telling the boys that she would not be long. The latter were sitting quietly writing letters in the dining-room, when suddenly the younger commenced to scream, and the eldest, looking up, saw a figure at the door dressed in dark clothes with its face blackened. With great presence of mind the boy se'-Zid a poker which was red-hot in the fire, aod the spectre walked or ekated up the passage, looked into the bedroom, aud pa?Bed out of the front door, escaping over the fence. He had in his band a steff by which he seemed to balance himself, for he had on skates or springs of tome eort, as the marks of his movements were distinctly Been in the passage, and all through the hou*e and garden, Oj the return of tbe parents they found the two boys in a state of collapse from fright, but thongh an immediate search was made the ghost was not discovered."
