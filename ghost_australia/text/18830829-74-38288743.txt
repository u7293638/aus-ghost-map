POMfEROY DRAMATIC COMPANY. Owing to a number of ticket holders being unable to gain admission on Monday night Shakespeare's tragedy of " Hamlet" was repeated last evening, when there was again a crowded house. The cast was the santo as on the previous evening, and the acting of Miss Pomeroy as Hamlet, in many of the difficult parts with which that character abounds, was excellent, and received the applause it merited. The part of Gertrude, the Queen of Denmark, was very well ron dored by Miss Blanche Lewis, though she looked rather too young for the part. Polonius, as the father of Laertes and Ophelia, was well represented by Mr. J. G. Joyce, who was quite at home in the character. The two grave-diggers, repro. sented by Messrs. H. Leston and J. Kennedy, caused much amusement, and were well received. The parts of Horatio, Guildenstern, Rosencrantz, Marcelles, and Barnardo were well supported respectively by Messrs. Gerald, Arrow smith, Leston, and E. Gladstone. Mlr. Chas. Hall as Claudius, the stoep-father of Hamlet, was undoubtedly very good. Mr. C. Appleton played the ghost of Hamlet's father, and his acting was careful ahd envinced great pains had been taken with the part. Mir. Arthur Elliott took the part of the first player, and Mir. H. Nottingham that of the second player, and although in the play scene the stage was far too small to allow of a proper representation of the piece, their acting, and especially that of MIr. Elliott, was good. The dillicult part of Ophelia was sustained by Miss Florrie Lewis, whose representation of the character was much applauded. The emotional drama of "East Lynne" will be presented to night.
