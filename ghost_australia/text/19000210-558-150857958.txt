QUEEN VICTORIA PERSONATED. Is it indiscreet to relate that Miss Ellis •Jeffreys—in private life the Hon. Mrr. Cuizon—onoe for half a minuto imper sonated the Queen. It was at the famous bazaar at the Albert Hall, for the benefit of the Charing Cross Hospital, where most of the Duchesses and the prettiest of the actresses of Englandacted as sales women. Miss Jeffreys, who is a most accomplished beggar, worked like a Trojan for two days, and peddled " a lot of trifling fancy articles for a goodly sum. Ou the second day people grew bold, and as Miss Jeffreys is distinguee and always beautifully gowned, they kept asking her who she was, in the hope that it might turn out they had bought something of a Duchess' or perhaps even one of the Princesses. When Jeffreys "the womerl'\/a move away diEiyrpCiilt^di that to you ? vQhb>a'sked Miss " Yes," repfiedy Miss iDwburv I've had sA ^dpicaUofuStblttm beginning tiK, get-.on " I'll tell yonXwh'at'j/ivO ' prbfWF exclaimed Miss give them what they want! Tell the next one that asks you that you're the Duchess of Sutherland, and I'll say I'm the PriD cess Henry of Pless! " " Oh ! I would not dream of doing such a thing, and neither would you ! " returned Miss Hanbury. ""Watch me!" was the reply. Just then a most vulgar and impertinent woman, the worst type of nouvelle riche, came hp and bought something of Miss Jeffreys, eyeing her all over, and finished with : " Tell me which one you are ! " Drawing hetEelf to her full height, and, putting on her most imperious expres sion, Miss Jeffreys said, in a particularly firm voice: " Madame, I am the Queen 1" The woman made off as if she had seen a ghost, evidently thinking she had to do with a lunatic, and Miss Jeffreys, who considered "that anything more would he anti-climax, promptly went home.
