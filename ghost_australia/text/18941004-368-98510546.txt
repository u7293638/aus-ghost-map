GHOSTS. Dear; has the daylight come so soon ? Is yon pale gleam the dawn? Say 'tis a glimpse of the pallid moon Through the curtains closely drawn ! More wine! More lights ! Let the music chime, Let the feast again begin. With song, with kiss, keep back the time When day and the ghosts come in! For there in the dawn are spectres twain That will not be charmed away, The ghosts of two in the night-time slain That only walk by day ! A fair, white girl, and a man with her, Like a murdered king and queen; It is only the woman that once you were, And the man that I might have been! A. R. Ropes, in the National Observer.
