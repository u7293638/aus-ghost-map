EARLY AUSTRALIAN DAYS. .-.-: SCRAPS FROM AN OLD MS. (BY THE SPECTRE .) It is not often that ono gets hold of a gonuine convict manuscript nowadays Thoy were never very plentiful, for convicts as a rule wera not given to literary work, and even if thoy possessed tho nccossary qualifications, had not, dilling their penod of servitude, at any rato, tho time or ojipoi - tunity to pour forth their soul in books This remark apjihcs moro particularly to tho earhor conviot days, te tho times of harsh disciplino and rigorous treatment Later on, when tho century was woll adv meed, mid tho sternness of tho system initiated by Phillip had somovvhat ida-ved, men found tuno to record the r impiessions of past eveqps Hauy who had boen pnsoners wera now freo Lifo was poasiblo for thom, and looking back over tho p ist miseries thoy and thoir comrades had endured, they wrote To such a olass belongs the yet unpublished manuscript which I hav o beforo mo Tho manner of its discovery was accidental and easy to tell I happened a wock or so ago to moot a gentloman whose wife's father, an old colonist, had. held tho position of clerk of works to Sir Thomas Mitchell, to whom wo aro uidobted for many of our main ronds, and especially for tho route ov or the Bluo Mountains Whilst engaged in this capacity ho mudo tho acquniutauco of a most ccceutno genius, who had boen transported for forgery The convict, an architect by profession, anda learned man withnl, wns em- ployed upon mnuy buildings m the city, and was specially occupied over tho construction of the old St Mary's Cathedral Though his dissipated habits rendered his woik somowhat intermittent, his services wera engerlj sought for, and thoso interested took much painb to keep lum sober His bparo moments wera . occupied in literal j woik, and thus it was that tho picscnt, as well as many other manuscripts, carno to bo written When dying tho author bequeathed his works to tho gentleman ahovo mentioned, and in this way they pnssed into tho possession of my friend The book w ltli vhich I proposo at prosont to deal contains an olitborate account of colonial hfo ns it existed dunng tho days of Governor Darling Tho date on tho titlo-pago IB 1815, but internal ov tdenco shows that tho inci- dents described occurred in 182o and tho fow fol- lowing years I do not think thero can bo any doubt as to tho authenticity of tho mnnuscnpt, nor as to tho reahtv of tho incidents with vvluoh its pages aro crow ded Thero aro about 200 sheets of foolscap, discolourod w ith ago and closely written upon m a cramped sonii commercial hand Tho book has soon rough usago in the past Somoono has spilt ink over many of tho pages, and there arc lacuna) hero and there But on tho wholo, with patienco and a good light, tho matter is fanlj legible, und tho difUoulty only giv es added interest to tho peiusai It w ill ho hotter perhaps to rofram from touch- ing upon tho moro rov olting of tho criminal inci- dents with which tho work abounds It -vus a timo of brutalitv, of harsh taskmasters and debased servants Thero wero mon, and ono moots plenty of them in theao pages, whoso souls had been entirely crushed out, whoso hearts wera as tho hearts of tho sov ago brutes, and whoso vices wero worse than thoso of tho most degraded aboriginal And thoy kill and mm der aud com- mit outrage through all theso long pages, until at v last ono s soul grows weary of Buch unstinted gruesomenoss, and ono turns with re- lief to tho latest shilling shocker, a class of work which, in comparison with this biography, is but as food for babes and sucklings Not that tho hero of the narrativo is entirely bad Ho is, in fact, an ango* by contrast with his comrndos True, ho has committed one enmo-that of housobreuk lng, for which ho was transported-but with tins his sinful capacity seems to havo ended He mov es throughout tho history amongst cnminals of the most villainous character, ho breaks out of prison, and is oven pressed into tho( service of a bushranging gang who hold lum their prisoner for many weeks whilst thoy aro carrying firo and outrage through the land Tor this ho nearly gets hanged, but his good luck, winch never deserta him, comes to his rescue, and ho is repnovedat tho lost moment Ho journoys on foot northward from the Hunter Elver to Capo York, following tho coast ltno all tho .way ho fights aborigines by thousands, nnd eitern nrds joins a tribe of blacks , ho sees murders committed by tho hundrod, and is brutally treated in every possiblo way, j ot ho lives through it all It is not, however, with tho latter and moro udv onturous part of tho narrative that I hav o to dca-> It is, perhaps, too highly spiced to be truo, and has no doubt been introduced to give zest to the somovvhat monotonous sketch of ov eryday hfo in thoso tunca It IB tho descriptive portion of tho work which will bo looked to with most interest by tho Australians of to-day Wo have in tho first piano a detailed account of the hfo on board a conviot ship This is a Bubjeot whioh has boon doult with over and over ngam, and as tho voyage did not differ materially from others of the samo day, I need not enlarge upon it Tho only romnrkablo incident was a mutiny of the convicts, which wa3 soon subdued Tho mon, on tho whole, seem to havo boon fairly well troatod, and w o miss entirely tho lurid brutality w Inch Marcus Clarke has shuddennglj painted in " His Natural Lifo" It is only when wo lench Australia that tho real colonial intoiost ot tho story bogms Let us bco what tho Sydney of thoso days, a tiny villngo by contrajt to tho modern city, w as liko As to our beautiful hal hour, tho author is pleased to write in a deprecatory mood " Tho shores of Port Jackson," ho remarks, "thon presented fow charms, oithor natural or acquired , sandy bays, opening to great distances inland, bordered apparently by stunted trees, rocky headlands bo tweon eaoh inlet, crow nod with similar foliage, and fai away tho background, on cither hand, displayed denso iorests of oombro green-there

had cvoi trod pi tor to the arnval " I w ondor w hat our author, who is rather too much giv en to lengthy poetical rcflcotiona of this kind, would havo fiaid about tho Sjdnoy of to-day A wholo volume of blank verso would probably havo been insufficient for tho outpounngs of his delighted soul Howover, when Garden Island is reached, ho grows moio practical Ono of tho passengers mentioned tho namo of this miscalled spot, and the writer oppresses his unmitigated disgust in tho following terms,-" Alas ' tho Bo-oallod Garden Island presented nothing to viow but a doubly sterile mass of rugged groy rooks, rising from tile bosom of ono of the numerous bays, and crownod vv ith the samo unvarying hvery of russot green " Tho ship was soon after brought to an anohor in Sydney Cove, opposite a neck of land on whioh stood a slaughtor-houbo, and from horo tho greater part of tho town coidd bo seen "The dwolhngs appeared to bo chieiiy of ono story , m tact, most ot thom desert ed no bettor namo than

vessols at anohor , and a good number of small outtors and boats, Which were passing too aud fro continually " Tho pnsonors woro aspignod ns servants to pnvute individuals in tho mannor common at that timo Tho lot ol some fell easily, thoy obtaiuod light positioni, whilst others weio sent to labour in tho fields with tho hoo, a primitivo inBtrumont of agriculture thon in gonoral uso through- out tho oolony Our conviot, who had had a good education, obtained a situation as assistant sohoolmastor, and eeems for a while to havo boon fairly well off But Sydnoy life offered too many temptations for lura Ho joined a Jobating socioty, whoro speeches of a; soaitious character wera delivered, and thus cameunto contact with tho authorities Tho re- sult was his transforenco to tho settlement at Emu Plains, u kind of poiutontiiiry, whoro tho moio dangerous of tho convicts woro kopt at hard woik inj tho fields Of tho chuuictoi of tho emly settlors in tho Nopcun district at this tuno wo learn a good deal If thoir mannors woro rough and their dwolhngs primitivo, thoir hospitality Was profuso, and tho Btrangor, bo ho bond or froo, was always woloomo to tho boat thoy had. In accordance with a custom of tho timo the convicts, during the harvesting penod, wore allowed leavo for two or threo days at tho end of tho week, in order to help tho sottlois with thoir work Iho small ness of tho population rendered such a regulation necessary, for even then farm» woro numerous along tho banks of tho Nepean In ono way tho a~ncultunsta of thoso days, though their methods vi ero but pnnutivo, showed thoir good sense Thoy did most of their work at night, after tho mannet clc trly indicated in the following po3sago - ' It was a favourite as well as bono'toial practico w ith the Australian farmers of tliut day to perfoim tho greater pirt of their agricultural labours cither at night or early oach morning, so that during tho middlo hours of tho day, when the sun w as at its greatest altitude, they slept, or amused themselves in thoir dwel- lings To do this with tho greater advantage, thoy carefully studied tho phases of tho moon, bBing rather guided in their hours of libotn, during the summer, by that luminary, than tbo too ardent god of day" Wngos wore high, for even the prisoners out on loai o could command a pound a day and thoir keep for cuttiug wh»at, so it must bo presumed that a still higher rate was paid to tho freo men Women, and oven children, woro employed m the fields, and ono mstanco is mentioned where a man and his fiv o daughters of v arymg ages vi aro found reaping togother As to tho dw cllings of thoso peoplo, thoy were slab lints, difforing but littlo from the poorer elliss of settlers' housos to-day Tlio onl) modiheatiun in the structure was caused thiougli tho scarcity of nails, cords or wooden pegs being used insten 1 for fa.tcn.ng tno diflercnt patts of tho hut together Outside of Sydnoy there woro hardly any towns worthy of tho nemo in tho colony at that timo Liverpool was perhaps one of tho most important of tlio inland settlements, and the prosont resi- dents of this pi ico will hardly feel flattered at the unfavourable, if prophetic description which our author gives "Liverpool is a town about 20 miles from Svdney, on the great Southern road of tho colonv It was founded by Governor Mac- quarie, w ho, in select ng that namo for it, seems to li tie expected it would becomo au important mart of manufacturing industry or of commercial onterpnso With this view ho built an oxcellont hospital of great oxtcnt, a gaol, a barrack, and many other public buildings, but, alas ' his Excellenoy could noithor improve tho quality of tho soil around it, nor supply the deficiency of water, for, although a stream called Georgo's Riv cr, nat igablo for shellboats quite up to tho town, runs in from Botany Bay to the interior, passing vory near Liverpool, yet it flows with salt water, and the only xnothod tho inhabi- tants found in after times to obviate this pressing deficiency was by building a dam across the ni or's bod, and thus repressing the influence of the tides" At this timo, as wo loora later on, there were no les3 tnin loOO convicts employed theie, a new ohurch was being erected, and alto gethor tho placo presented a hustbng aspect Though tho hfo of the settlors w as rough, food scorns to havo been fairly plentiful, and rum oven too nbundnnt In describing a journey along tho Southern road undertaken by tw o travellers, the author gives the following account of tho evening meal sot forth at tho humblo cabin of an Irish settler As a preliminary sovoral applications woro made te tho rum kog, and thou -"The whole party sat down to supper, whioh consisted of pork fried, damper bread, and toa, with abund- ance of eggs, und a very small picco of butter Iho meat, as usual, was all put into a dish which stood in tho entre of tho tablo Plates, louves, folks, or tablecloth were apparently superfluous encumbrances, which wera utterly unknown to theso good folks, each of whom, how ov or, was provided with a pocket laufe, with which ho, or sho, first cut a sbco of the cake, then, selecting a inotsci of pork to their f tncy, placed tho meat on tho bread, and sawed away as hard as thoy likod " Tho only thing mis'ingto complete tho happiness of theso Irish folk was tho humblo potato, a vegotoblo which tho peoplo of this nationality ro gaid almost as a nocossaiy of life According to tho author, a behof was prevident that potatoes would not glow m Austialia "Whether," ho remarks, " it was ow ing to thoir want of proper culture oi suitablo seed or somo other cause, it was exceedingly rare to soo theso woll-known roots in nny part of Now South Wales, or when thoy w ero found after many trials to grow, thoy scarcely attained tho si-o of hens' eggs, oven tho htrgent of thora, wlnlo fir tho greater portion wera oi ly about as lal go as muskot bullets" This sounds strange reading m tho present day, whon tho tuber is so abundant, but probably it may bo ucoouutod for on tho supposition that tho potato had not yet had timo to become aocUmatiscd in this Southern land So the story runs on through vnrlod phasos, nearly ov cry feature of colonial hf o bomg included in its many pages It is not all poacoful and domestio, as in tho fow passages I havo quoted above Tho bushrangers breaklooso on tho quiot in- habitants of tho Nopean district, and crtiolties of an indescribable character aro committed In another placo tho authorised but no loss tembló cruolties perpetrated at tho Coal River sottlomont, now know n as Now castlo, aro related with a. sickening minuteness of detail Thoro is an exciting acoount of on escape fiom this settlement in n boat whioh chanco had placed in tho hands of the com lets, and thou w o got among tho aboriginos There waa but littlo poaco hero either Tho weapon of tho blackfellow was, as a rulo, turnod against tho white man, and tho convict vi ho escaped into tlio bush had to chose between tw o fates-death from a nativo bpear or from tho hangman's noose Tho aboriginal superstitions, thon untinged by contaot with tlio w hito man, led thom, however, at times, to mako curious exceptions Thoy looked upon Europeans as re-incarnated boiuga, into whom tho ghost of somo dead and gone niembor of thoir own raoo had entered for the puipo.o of returning onoo more to earth Consequently, whon thoy mot a white man for tho hist timo thoy would always bestow upon him tho name of ono of their dead comrades Somotunes, inconsistently enough, they would lull lum, at other timos thoy would tie it lum with tlio utmost respect mako him a mombci of thoir tube, and supply lum with a helpmeet, or " djiu," to forjgo and cook for bun Tims it happened with tho hore of this tale, who, falling ono day into the li mds of tho aborigines, was rescued from sudden death by tho " carandjio" or modioino man of tho tnbo, vi ho saw m him tho likeness of a dead son Tour years' rcsidenco amongst tho blooks makes tho esoaped piisonor thoroughly familiar with thoir habits and oustoms, and ho 1ms muoh to tell us that IB

and land, shipwrecks and rescues, until at last it finished in Sydnoy I would Uko to toll mora, and rogrot that in this bnof sketch I havo only been able to outline tho leading features of this curious old manuscript If tho author's stylo, as the quotations givon above oloarly show, is somowhat pedantic and involved, ho at least commands attention by his fidelity and full ness of detail
