THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 1887. The full text of Mr. STANHOPE'S despatch regarding the proposed Im- penal conference has now been received, and, though local affairs may be press- ing, the Cabinet will be without excuse if it cannot manage to send representa- tives. To begin with, the object of the conference is essentially practical. The sending of the Soudan Contingent, which opened English eyes in the most effective manner to the existence of a colonial militia, made a deep impression upon the public mind. It is now hoped that, as the colonies are spending money for their own defence, some general scheme may be devised by which the money expended can be turned to the best ac- count. The affected fears of the Op- position are seen to be ridiculous, for the intention of the conference is not to add to the expenditure, but to utilise the present resources, of the colonies to the greatest advantage. Experienced Ministers should hardly need to be reminded of the schoolboy truth, that strength and economy are to,be found in co-operation, and that the empire can do more collectively than could be done singly by the provinces. Hitherto, in fact, we have been working in the dark. Little is known of what is being done in distant parts of the empire, or how much each of the colonies is pre- pared to contribute for defences. The " problem," to use Mr. STANHOPE'S term, is to defend the British Empire, and great ignorance prevails as to the two main conditions of the problem, the actual resources and the possible dangers of every province. When these are made fully known, the English Go- vernment propose to submit certain general principles to secure the best means of defence with the pro- sent resources of the empire. In addition to this topic, the con- ference will be asked to discuss the question of communication. The time has come when the postal and telegraphic services might be consider- ably improved. They will soon have to be dealt with in the ordinary course of local politics, and if a general con- ference could suggest anything to make our communications more perfect in the time of peace and more safe in the event of war, its deliberations would be of the highest service. At any rate, the bare prospect of being able to plan some means for accomplishing the double object is a sufficient reason why the Cabinet should send representa- tives. When the conference is held, Vic- toria should certainly not be con- spicuous by refusing to send a mem- ber of tho Cabinet to represent her. After taking the lead in federation, it would be ridiculous to throw away our position by slighting or underrating an important movement. This colony has been in the forefront of federation, has taken a lively interest in Imperial affairs, and has paid great attention to its fleet and fortifications. If Ministers do not follow this policy to the next legiti- mate step of attending the first con- gress of the empire, they will simply stultify themselves. Let them remain at home, and it will be evident that they are so wrapped up in local matters as to be incapable of attempting to carry out the principles which they have professed. The colony will never again be able to take the same tone in regard to federation, if it is left un- represented because the conference may not happen to be held at the most convenient season. It cannot pose as the exponent of a principle and yet re- fuse to take its share of the work. Mr. GILLIES inherited from his predecessor a sagacious and far-reaching policy, and if lio now dawdles, and hesitates, ho will only be helping to undo it. The matter is not one to be en- trusted entirely ti» the agent-general or to distillgui&lied; colonista who happen to be in London. The agent-general can- not have the authority of a representa- tive who is in touch with Parliament and the people, and who has to undortako the responsibility afterwards of explain- ing everything that may bo agreed to. The foimer is bound by instructions which are either drawn up befoio hand or aro telegraphed on tho strength of meagre reports ; the latter, within certain general linos, can act for himself. Ambassadors could not by half a year's negotiations con- clude a tieaty that would be drawn up and signed in a week at a meeting of responsible and special dologates of the powers. Similarly the agents-general cannot wield the direct authority of a responsible Minister of the Crown, and must bo,slower and more uncertain in their action. * The alleged inconvenience is wholly removed by Mr. STANHOPE'S expression of his willingness to appoint the con ferenco for the timo that will best suit the colonies. But even if it should bo held in April or May, wo fail to seo . whero the great inconvenience conies ' in. Because tho Ministry has somo measures to preparo, is the presonce of every member of it required during the whole of the recess 1 When the general principles have been adopted by the Cabinet, the semi mechanical work of di afting tho bills can surely be car- ried on in the absence of one or two. The whole and undivided Ministry is not needed to correct proofs, and to examine the wording of clauses. Once the ideas aro settled, the de- tails form no excuse for refusing to send representatives. Nor is there any point in alleging that two of the Ministers will be absent from Parlia- ment for a month. If the Premier is unable to leavo, the Minister of De- fence could be spared, since it is notorious that almost no work is done in the Council at the beginning of the session. Another might surely be away for a short timo from the Assembly without weakening the power of tho Government. There are many reasons for complying with Mr. STANHO-E'S invitation ; there is not one with an appearance of plausibility for declin- ing. ____________ Tho mteiestiiig atcotint fiom a special correspondent of the propala tions for embaikitig tile first batch of lécidiouleí winch we published j es terday recalls the cunous fact that there is still the widest difieience, even among civilised modern communities, in the treatment of crime and cammais In this depaitment of social science, at all events, Gi eat Britain itself .must he acknowledged to stand fal ahead of other piogressive nations AVhethor that be or be not due to the accident of JOHN HOWARD, the apostle and martj r of prison reform, being an Englishman, and to the fact that the subject has always been kept before the public by the lahoma of such enlim sittsts as the late Sit OEOUGL Gnrv, Mi CRA'SWORD, Sir VVA.LTEH Cnoiios, and otilen, it is certain that within the last 20 years a lcmarkable degieo of sue cess m dealing with crime and in the tttatment of criminals has been attained in the United Kingdom, in tho Gi own colonies, and in India England has boilowed many ideas on prison manage ment fiom other nations ¡she has nu proved on them, while other nations have stood still 01 retiograded With regard to the old fashioned policy of tiansportation, which is of couiso the basis ot the Trench lêadiviste law, it has often been pointed out that Tranco is simply copying the English ideas of the last ccntuiy, and that, with character stic indifieienco to the historyof eveiy country excepttheirown, Trench statesmen ignore the recorded and disastrous failute of those ideas Sending condemned poisons beyond sea was a practice in vogue m the United Kingdom for over a century before the ' )ear 17SG, when tho first reculai fleet of convict ships wns despatched to one of the Bl ltish dependencies The Eng- lish gaols then becamo w hat the Isle of Elie now is, mainly depots for the retention of cammais awaiting trans portation No stoiy has been more fully and more frequently told than the breakdown of the ti anspoi tatton system m the Bil tish colonies Its enormous cost to the mother country-£400,000 a year after a while-the frightful domoiahsation of society in two of the colonies, the de gradation of free laboui winch quickly resulted fand still survives m one ot them) from this vntual system of slave holding,-all these evils aie borne in mind by intelligent men thioughout the British emplie It was the resolute agitation against transportation which commenced in these colonies between 1835 and lb40, and finally met with complete succès in 1S53, which leally gave tho impetus to that move mont foi prison leform in Gieat Binain smco so fruitful of good results Lngland was, in fact, compelled to take steps to " consumo hoi own smoke," and to utilise her own criminal refuse 'lranspoitation was a convenience at fust sight, an obvious and at the same time essentially a lazy method of got tmg lid of criminals 'Hutt is no doubt the reason why it has been adopted by demagogic Tiench Ministril s, swayed by popular clamoui and weak kneed, as the 'childien " nf universal sufhage frequently aie Possibly, when the " pailiamentofman, thofederationof the " world" becomes an accomplished fact, a stop will be put to the shiftless and sinistei procobs of throwing criminal i ubbish over the neighbours' fence and calling it transportation Probablj the tact that the most linpoi tant .steps in English penal legislation weie pioposed before the model n demociatic eia, mid at a time when populai ,clamom could be disiegaided by Government,accounts foi much of its success 'lu bo MIL cessful, systems of pnson discipline and prison labour must, among other things, bo lairly economical '1 ho cost of convict establishments m Gieat Britain itself is now under £400,000 pei annum, ululo the piisonets' laboui is \alued at ovei X250,000 Olio "popular" ob]cction long uiged against employing pa sonois at remunerative laboui w is that competition with li co laboui was unfuu, and that "bicad was ' taken out of the working mans "mi uth" therobj After matuie conMdciation the aiginnent was, to a gi cut ettent, disicguided by the House ol Commons Probably it is still powerful in 1 lance, and no 1 rench Ministiy would tittie to faco tho un popularity of oraploymg couvicts m important state works of construction, such as have been carried on at Ports- mouth, Portland, Chatham, Borstall, itc. Wasteful managoinent still exibts in the English convict prisons no doubt, but since the system of earning' a small remission of sentence by "' marks" for hard work (not for good conduct) was introduced by Sir WALTER CROFTON, in Ireland, more than 20 years ago, con- vict labour has become of genuino value, while the prisoners learn many handicrafts in prison which are useful to them on their release. Another " popular " objection to the English system is its alleged severity. Nothing is more curious than the alternations of sentimental soft heartedncss and thoughtless ferocity which modern societies go through in this matter. The French seem to still retain a good deal of pity for tho récidivistes, whom tiley are sending in our direction. The diet provided for them is far better than the average Fronch working man can pro- cure. They live ia association instead of being separated, and the artist of one of the French papers, who visited the Isle of Mié, was not allowed to sketch their portraits lest he should hurt the feelings of their relatives. Yot they aro now practically condemn- ing thom, with a light heart, to lead the lives of wild beasts at the other sido of the world. In this colony, also, the public insist that convicted pri- soners shall be much better fed than they ate in English prisons. At tho same time, there is reason to believe that we havo fallen into the other alternative, and actually treat our criminals with an amount of positive cruelty which is unknown to the English system. The latter is in one sense the severest in the world-because the must rigidly carried out. Convict dis- cipline in Great Britain is the most irksome, and tho most difficult for the prisoner to evade, of any prison dis- cipline in the world. Nevertheless, the death rate among prisoners there is lower than among any other class of the 'population ; and this, in spite of the fact that the prisons are full of old men, and that criminals are recruited from the lowest class physically. " Soli " tary confinement," with a dieu of bread mid water, as describad in Mr. BRETT'S recent report, is, however, unknown in the English convict prisons. No English judge can sentence a pri- soner to a single day of " solitary " as distinguished from " separate ". confine- ment. The nearest approach to that form of Victorian punishment is the sentence of 28 days' " penal class," which the . directors of convict prisons can inflict. Even then the diet is not bread and water, but por ridgo and milk. Tho reasons why questions of prison discipline and the disposal of criminals have been shirked or ignored in certain highly civilised communities, are no doubt to be found < in "the general dislike to face a painful and repulsive subject until its considera- tion is forced by circumstances upon public men.

The Government have finally decided to appoint Mr G T A Lavater, accountant of the Railway department, to the position of secretary to the forthcoming Centennial Exhibition in Melbourne. The question of the selection of Mr Lavater was yesterday morning discussed by the Premier with Mr Speight, Mr Gillies being desirous of ascertaining whether Mr Lavater could be spared from his post without impairing the efficiency of the branch under his control. Mr Speight, while expressing his regret at losing Mr Lavater's services, mentioned that that gentleman had so perfected the discipline of his ofiice and had placed it m such an ellicient condition, that it would be possible to relieve him of his duties during the term of the Exhibition. At the same time Mr Speight stipulated that Mr Robert Kent, assistant accountant, should be promoted to the vacancy which would be caused by Mr Lavater s removal and that in case of an emergency Mr Lavater should be prepared to assist the department with his advice and aid. The Premier at once assented to these conditions and subsequently, at a personal interview, acquainted Mr Lavater with the wish of the Cabinet that he should take the secretary- ship. That gentleman on being informed that the Commissionirs had made no objection to his being transferred from the Railway department, consented to take the appointment. Mr Lavater has now been an employé in the railway department for 26 years, and is at present receiving a salary of £900 per annum, but the Government have arranged that while acting as secretary of the Exhibition he shall be paid a salary of £1,250. Mr Lavater will be formally appointed to his new position to day, at a meeting of the Exeiutive Council.
