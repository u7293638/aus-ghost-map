CHAPTER XXVII. EOLLOWINQ A SHADOW. George Lent did not set out on his journey from home as soon as he expected. Mrs. Lent, his mother, fell downstairs on tho very morning he was to leavo, and although there were no visible injuries, her age, and the shock she had sustained, rendered it unoertain what after- effects there might be; and George, who loved his mother dearly, determined to postpone his departure ; not that he was going far-only to Newcaatle-but to theso primitive old-world peo- ple it seemed BB though he were leaving home for an unknown country. He wandered about all day, hoping, almost against his better thoughts, that he might chance to come aoross Janet; but the day wore on, and he had not seen her, so at last he deter mined to go up to the ottagc and tell them of his chance of purpose, and its cause Cvcning was olosiag in, and the little village was hushed in tbc stillness of deep rt pose Most of the inhabitants had gone to visit the ireus, fn in which the din of its brass bind ould be heard floating ou the still summer air, as the youn¿ niau npprojched Burt s house Justas he turned the comer of the little line, from the end of which he could perceive the -.brioc of his divinity, his heart gave a buldcn bound, an 1 then stood si ill, as he ¿aw a figure ipproacbinï him It was Janet, and tho »as looking uneasily from side to side of the roid, oeeasioiully stopping and casting a backward g1 mee, as although she wire afrud of being watched, and George instinctively retraced his steps, ->n 1 drew aside into the shadow of a clump of trees until she passed But, to his surprise, she stopped almost op posite to where ho was concealed, and looked iiixi iu ly amund George was just upou the point of stepping out and speaking to her, when he pereeived a rustling among tho leaves of the oppo itc liedle, and Janet gave a glad cry as a man firccd his way through it and joined her " Is it settled ' ' she asked eagerly, as tho man eame up, and George recognised him at onoe as the groom who had accosted her at the circus, and called her by so ne strange name He coul 1 not heir the man's answer, but he saw them talking earnestly together, with rige boiling at his heart, and yet there was nothing in their manner to show that they were moro than nero acquaintances-the man was perfectly respectful, aud Janet walked beside him at a few yards ín'crval, but George Lent was too much blinded by jealousy to observe this He tnsHe up his mind that it was an assignation» and it was with difficulty that he restrained the inclination he felt to rush out and seize the fellow by the collar Where could Janet be going with this stran ger? What was he tv her * He ask d himself these questions fiercely, but could arrive at no solution, and his heart misgave him sorely as he siw them wnlk slowly along the lane till tiny turned the corner which led into the town, and George lost sight of them He would not trust himself to follow them further, but walked on to the cottage, whure he found Mr But The elder children weie all away at the circus, and Mrs Burt was somewhere in the back pre mises with her baby Janet hid probably taken advantage of these oircumstanoes to steal out un perceiv d, hoping her absence would not be noted-this was what the young man tkou"ht in his bitt-rness " Hallo, George ' said the old man, removing his pipe from his mouth , ' I thought thou wast many a mile away from hero by this time "No,' answered George shortly, "I haven't gone yet " " So I see, but why ? ' The story of his dolaj was soon told and J hn Burt had soon exhausted his stock of oondolence, and then the two men relapsed mto filence Pre Bently Mrs Burt carno in, hot, tired, and flustered at the sight of their visi or "I do declare, now, that it give me quite a turn wh n I come in and sec d you sitting there Its for all the world the same as s eing a ghost to come flop upon a person you fancy is hundreds of miles off" " Come, come, mother," said her husband, with a laugh, " Newcastle am t quite the other side of tho world " j " I don t cale, it's far enough away But you'll have a cup of tea now you re hore, won't you? j " No, thank you " j " Oh, nonsense, you must now , all the chil- dren hive cone ti the show again, ind we 11 bo ible to have it iu peaoe Where s Janet, to hold baby while I make it ? ' " Janet ' said the old man, looking round in surprise " Why, where IB she t I saw boronl} a few minutes ago I thought she was out back with you ' " No, she hasn't been there for the last half hour " " I saw her," broke iu George. " Where '" ' Sho was going down towards tho town as I caine up here " \\\ h it tor ? ' " 1 diiln t speak to her, nor BIIC to mc-in> deed, she didu t see me, s0 I can t tell you, un loss she A gone to look at tho show, too,' the young mau added bitterly He felt very sore at what he hal seen, bul he would not say a word whieh was~ÍJ¿¿¡y to damage Janet in the estimation of ber filends though be determined thH he would find out for himself what was her îclatiouship with the mau she had met Could it be the musing husband Mr Style bad told lum of? The thought CIUICFO sud deiily upon him, that he nearly diopped the cup ; he held in his hand " Why, what'b up, lad ? ' a ked John "Nothing," he answered, ud, layingdown the cup, he rose from his chair, and baying that he must be off, bade them good night aud left, tha cottigc " What fools you men are," remarked Mrs Burt to her husband, when the young man was out of hearing " 1 suppose so," he answered philosophically "But who s the particular fool now ?" " Why, that chap that's just left us He goes mooning abcut after a girl that he knows doesn t caro a straw for him, when there arc plenty that would only be to glad of the chance " But George Lent was out of hearing of her critieism, and on bis way to the town, deter mined to find the man he had seen Janet meet and have it out with him if he could The moro he thought over his hastily formed suspieion that it was Janet o husband she had met, the less likely did it appear to bo possible He was only a eoarse, common looking stable man, and there could be no conncetion between him and the refined looking, albeit humbly dressed woman, whom Georgo felt that he loved most dearly still, wedded wife though she might be The young man reached the green where the circus tent was pitched, and loitered about till, in an interval between the peformances, he came upon the man he sought, and asked him, in plain, i almost brusque terms, what he had wanted with Janet The man answered civilly enough, said that I bo had made a mistake, fancying he had recog j niBcd the young woman, but had discovered he was wrong "But she walked along the road, with you," said George, suspiciously I " Well, as we were both going to the Bame j place, and there was only the one road, that's not so very surprising " George was nonplussed at this, though notsatis | lied", but he could not tax the man with a false hood, although he suspected it, and he loitered about tho place until after the last performance that night, and then, seeing that the men were taking down the tent ready for moving, he went home, not without observiug that among the crowds who left the place, Mr Styles was one, and he wondered very much whit strange fas cioation the clergyman could have found in it The rector did not see George, but he was ill at ease himself for he had seen the boy again, and marked him well, and was convinced that j some juggling had been practised upon him, for some reason However, he could do nothing that night at any rate, and went his way home and to bed, from which ho was roused some two hours later to speak to John Burt, who was waiting below to see him. Wondering what strange event had happened to procure him a visit at so untimeous an hou the rector hastily donnod a few articles of attire' and went down stairs " I'm very sorry for having disturbed you, sir,' said John, in evident trepidation ; " but I didn't know you had gone to bed I saw a light in one of the windows, and thought you'd maybe be sitting up writing " " No, it was tho nursery oandle But what's the matter, Burt ? You look quite frightaned, I hope nobody is ill Your wife-" " Oh, no, sir, she is quito well, thank you, but sorely put about, as we all are, and she ad visited me to come to you It's Janet, sir, we can't find her anywhere ? ' "Not find her?" " No, sir " " Why, where can she have gone ? It's past twelve o'clock " " I know it, sir, and my wifo thought maybe you knew where she was " "I ? No, indeed I don't think it's any use looking for her now, unless you find her at home when you get back " But Janet was not at the cottage when John Burt returned, and there was^ very little sleep amongst its simple inhabitants Morning carne, and she was still absent. but a strange rumour had got afloat, whioh gathered strength with overy succeeding hour, till all Woodside rang with the news that Janet Burt had gone off with the show folk So far, general rumour was correct. She had gone away with Heir Petronowski'» oirous. Supini the groom, and his wife, who knew her as M"s Amaranth, had consontcd to give her the protection of their houso, and, passing her off as tbe woman s sister, she went aloog with them bhc had a little monoy-enough, for the present, to pay her share of their humble housekeeping, and ID the future she hipad to bo able to procure work in the wardrobe to tup port herself by Janet had told her humble friends the story of her escape from the wreck, and they, in turu rcl itcd what they had heard from Airs Toote in New York of her supposed identification and bnml by the Bartl its, when they had ^onc diwu ti Wales "It was tho ung they knew you by, so they wrote to the missus,' said Supini " That little diamoi d tiling you used to wear " Ah ' I £,avc it to the stew írdess, I had no money, an 1 bl e tv is very kind to mo But who was it you said buried her ' ' " Harry Bartlett and his wife I knew them once in America " What becamo of thom ? ' " They joined this lot ' " Aro they with you still ? ' Oh, no, they both died at Preston ot, fever That boy, that the Herr calls Max Herzof, is their child I know, though he thinks that I don t I wasn t with him at the time , but I ve a pal as was, and he says that the Herr mu t havo done the youngster out of some money At any rate, there wasit t any found, and Harry Bartlett must have died worth a goodlsh bit, by all icoounts ' " Then it was all true, and Í waB right," cried Janet, with a white face "True1 What's true?" "That boy-I kniw it-I w»s suie of it Ile is mine, Supini, my \eryowu ' " Youis ? ' " Yes Don't look at me so I know what I am siying, au!
