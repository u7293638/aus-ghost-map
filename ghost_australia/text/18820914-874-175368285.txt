No Stays. MBS. DUGDALE, of Camberwell, has been writing a series of letters against women wearing Btays. We feel that Mrs. Dugdale is right, and, therefore, we join her heart and hand in her crusade. Where s the pleasure of cuddling so much whalebone and steel ? What 8 the use of long walks by the river's brink with your arm round a triumph of the staymaker's art" ? It's wicked for women to wear stays, that's what it is; and we shaU go out no more with the girl in the big straw hat if she doesn't leave 'em off. How would she like to walk about with us with her arm round a steel cuirass? What fun, we ask her, would there be in a moonlight ramble with a fellow dressed like the ghost of Hamlet's father ? No, there must be reciprocity. We will allow her to put her arm round our w;aist, under the coat if she likes, but we must also have the same privilege accorded to us. We want to hug a living waist, not a creaking, bony corset: We have sent a letter to the girl with the big straw hat, explaining our views, and enclosing Mrs. Dugdale s appeal; and if she doesn't consent to give them up, she sees no more of us. We are on strike, and shall keep so until she listens to the voice of reason.
