It will be well for us, then fore, to gain rush us in our reflections an adequate and to create idea of what education really means Education, thin, as understood by C ithol es and all real scholars means the training of the moral and intellectual li critics of 111 m of 1 a c its end But the end of man is manifold, and const entirely, if confusion is to be prevented, some one call must be paramount Man is a religious, civil, and domestic being 01 111 other words, man in his creation was destined to heaven hereafter, and, in this world for civil society and the family consequently, for a three-fold end three Authorities, then, have a chum to lntPileio 111 his education One end of his education is such a knowledge of 6 K here on em til as will enable him to possess Him in heaven Another such a tin pilling as will fit him to be a good and useful citizen, and, in the third place he must be so brought up as to both was any member of the family the Church, then and the State, and the Chu of the family have all and each a right to a voice in reference to his education the Church, that he may be enabled to become the child of God, the State, that he may become a good and useful cit /en , and the head of the family, that he may become by 1 d son and a good brother AA e 0 these authorities tops is, confusion and many other evils would necessarily fellow and consequently from the very nature of things, 11 due subordination amongst them is essential It is clear, then, that one must be first, one second, and another must be content with, the third place Their relative order defends 011 their relative importance the primary end of man is to acquire here on earth that knowledge of God which will enable him to possess line here utter, and to this the other two must be subordinate As it is the light and duty of the Church to guide men in all that belongs to the primary and, bers must be the last place in the training at the n moral and intellectual faculties This training, Ultu, must begin under his auspices and be carried on under her guidance, lest they should unhappily lose that for which they negociated, and thus lose till for ' what will it avail a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul r" As to the part of the State, Catholics readily concede that Government which represents the com money has a right to see that children shall be so educated that they may be enabled to become good and useful citizens The Church teaches that the power necessary for the stability and M ell-bun;, of society is 01 darned of God, and that, consequently, Governments have 11 right to urge lore in education so as to secure these ends But what is to be deplored is that, not satisfied with doing this, in many instances Governments have usurPed the entire control of education, and deprived the Church of the exercise of the power which, as the divinely constituted teacher, he holds from God Who received from our Lord Jesus Christ the commission to teach? The Church, and only the Church After His resurrection and not long before His ascension into Heaven our blessed Lord, as is related in the last chapter of the Gospel according to St Matthew spoke to His Apostles thus "All power is given to Me in Heaven and upon earth Going, therefore, teach ye all nations teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world" c 28, y 18,19, 20) And does not this authority and precept given to the Church alone establish her teaching authority as paramount to that of all other authorities a As, then, it is her right and her duty to teach the entire 1 ov elation of Christ, it is, consequently, necessarily her duty and her right to warn and guard men aged mat all opposing errors But how do this is the parent of the State possess a right to exclude her from the school ? Her right to teach the truths of roy station carries with it her right to direct and superintend all other teaching in order that error and corruption may not creep in The late illustrious Pon- tiff, Pius IX in his famous letter to the Archbishop of Fribourg, tersely sums up the perpetual teaching of the Church on this" subject, and condemns all secular and mixed systems of education, declaring them to be inspired by a spirit of hostility towards her, and by a desire of extinguishing among the people the the light of our holy faith And not content with this clear exposition of Catholic teaching, he further declares that the Church is in duty bound not only to use her best efforts, and employ every means to secure for children the necessary Christian education and instruction , but, moreover, would feel herself obliged to w am all the faithful, and to declare that no one can in conscience frequent mixed and secular schools as being adverse to the Catholic Church. There is another passage in this important document of the greatest moment There are to be found some who would, if possible, persuade ecclesiastical authority to sanction secular or mixed schools in mixed communities, and I am not sure if some such may not here and there be found amongst those who call themselves Catholics to these men, I beg most earnestly to recommend a consideration of the following words of the great Pontiff " those," he says, " who pretend that the Church ought to abdicate or suspend her control and her salutary action upon the primary Schools, in reality, ask her to disobey the commands of her Divine Author, and to he false to the charge she has received from God, of guiding all men to salvation " You see, then, my dear brethren, that in the strenuous efforts everywhere made by genuine Catholics to provide Catholic schools for their children, they are only doing that which it is their bounden duty as Christians to do, and that were they to do less, they should be false to the charge imposed upon them by God History proves mid illustrates the fidelity of the Church to her office From the first it has been her cato to establish schools everywhere according to her opportunities and her means In the beginning the residence of b shops and priests were also schools Monasteries, which in the day of then pass penty nourished, in all Christian lands, had invariably schools attached to them so also find the cathedrals, and it is mainly to these the world is indebted for the preserva- tion of ancient learning, even of the Scriptures themselves Who for example, is ignorant of the zeal and success of the ancient Irish schools? Who founded almost all the great universities, even those of greatest n une to-day? the Roman Pontiffs, who have been then noblest, most generous benefactors, bishops and others of the Catholic Church? Who raised the glorious cathedrals of many lands, buildings which even to this day are so many schools of art, beauty, and civilisation i AA he has established those 110 religious congregations of men and women, who devote themselves gratuitously throughout the world to the education of youth, particularly the children of the people The Catholic Church Even now, who is devoting all energies, all now his intellect, genius, learning, virtue, disinterested- ness, large pecuniary mums-to the education of the people? The Catholic Church in very recent times various Governments have become alive to their obligations to their subjects 111 reference to education, and with any born zeal, though not ah says well directed, have become lavish in their expenditure on schools But it is a new born zeal It is not so long ago since some of them persecuted education, and made it penal to teach even the rudiments of learning In the early days of some amongst us popular education was neglected by the State "A here's, even then, and for centuries before, the Church had put forth all her energies to secure education for the people On school neophytes, however, now heap blame upon the Church for not having accomplished impossibilities, for not having educated all in spite of the neglect, the opposition, the persecution and the plundering of the State And even now, notwithstanding the millions of money annually spent by the State on schools, sin. cannot show 1 results equally good with those produced by the Church single handed and obstructed by the civil authority Nor is this wonderful through her jealousy of the Church the State has undertaken to do the impracticable-to educate independently of religion, and in ignorance of it-of religion that has Chnsliamsed mid civilised all Christian and civilised nations, manned their literature, guided then history, directed their manners, given tone to their intellectual pursuits, leavened then legislation, influenced then morals, and even then commercial pursuits, and given life to the arts and sciences the attempt to educate by ignoring religion and shutting out the Church from then mental vision is a mad design, and can lead only, to disaster, not only to men's first and best interests, but to the interests of all moral and intellect to d training But is this attempt in reality, honest i Can there be education of any sort whilst the Church and God and religion are ignored? No and therefore although modern systems of education pretend to ignore these, they do not, because they cannot These subjects are forever I cropping up, under all systems and am erroneously treated under most of them As these systems hay P been established, as Pius IX , declares in hostility to the Church, under them no opportunity is lost to prejudice the rising generation against the teaching of revealed, indeed of all, religion And it must be no as Christ he-, said, "He that is not with Me is against Me" to the system of education that does not ft uiMv accept relief n as its basis and willingly submit to its soul use, it from the very nature of the case hostile to Christ and Chin timing Governments in the present du hive ostentatiously set themselves in direct opposition to God and His Christ, and they cannot but expect the logical result viz to be so and the power under the idol who have either "in my dear brethren, are most r man are Gui led by the Church of God "gathered securely round the Rock of Ages, jim have li tened with facility and reverence to the by nee of Peter, against whom the gates of hell shall not prevail and is true, faithful sons of the REACH mg Mollie! withdrawn our selves from all participation in the news lulled and pestiferous systems of education , which not only ignore the existence of the last of your Bung-to whom, by your yen creature, you are of light! to devote all your services but endeavour to cast Him out from His nation "outlive withdrawn by our selves from those, and because you love real education you have at great expin e and untruths admit the 1 and that you have been compelled to pay for the tree and gi (Hess educational other people's children provided ( christian and Catholic schools ter your own Pi i st. vote in this crime continues to put from you the poisoned cup, priMe for your dear children for whose souls you must render an acre but at the day of judgment, the otto true fish with! out which it is imp visible to iii lie God, keep him in then susceptible it is a knowledge of what then fathers have suffered for his faith and leave nothing undone that then education instead of being stunted a nut shell, and resided mere by the ghost of an education may be that training; of the moral and intellectual 1 friends to a sculling end of his is alone deserves the name of the it on "You have serious, experience, to avoid prelates, ins tied over his recent turn of the Church, to direct as it time you Ox 11 all is also A year of our Lord Jesus Christ who in teaching the deposit of revelation to all the wilful cannot go astray, and who is supernaturally guided in the game cent of the Church I need say no more "our noble Christ in and Catholic conduct in the past is the gums tee for the future Sons of martyred fathers you will never forget the deed of your ancestors, n reverences for their medium v and loyalty to the ii faith you will PS hitherto, leave nothing undone to hand it was to your children the previous, pureness deposit which it cost those ministers so much to hand down to you Children's Patrick, children of Augustine, children of Columnblti le, children of Kemigiiis, Catholic children of all lands, be mindful of your piolntcswho have gone long ere you n id guard their faith, which is the root and foundation of just fication May God the Father who are cited us, God the Son who redeemed us, God the Holy Ghost who practiced as, the one and true God so bless us, so direct and strengthen us, that having like St Paul, fought the good fight and presend the faith for ourselves and our children, we may come to the possession of that reward which is laid up for the loyal and just in Heaven Amen The fourth session, which will be held on Wednesday, will be for the commemoration of deceased pi dates of the Church A solemn requiem mass will be said, and the sermon will be preached by Dr Reynolds, of Adelaide On Sunday next the final session of the synod will be held and the event will be celebrated with great splendour Cardinal Moran will preach on the occasion In order to prevent overcrowding, admission will be by tickets only, and these may be procured either from the Holy Father Coonan, administrator of the cathedral, of Mr Monaghan, the clerk _
