A NOVEL COFJFIN. (Melbourne Herald), Any innovation upon the established customs aud peculiarities of our burial system scorns now so to predominate with almost all classes of tho com munity that scarcely can a new idea be brought to light on that subject than it is eagerly adopted by tho ever willing few, and made tho platform for discussion by tho many, as was tho case some short time,ago, when the London and Continental press discussed the question from , all points of view, including tho inauguration and adop tion of a system of burial in wioker work or basket-ware coffins. One of theso wioker coffiins, tho first ovor made in the colony, was shown to our representative on Saturday afternoon at tho shop of Mr. P. Pottitt, basket marker, Post-office Placo, which, he stntoa, has boon made to order for tho purposo of burial. This coffin which is (ivo feet six inches in length, and twenty inches across tho shouldorB, is constructed of about quarter inch caue, the top and sides being1 made of vory open cross.bar work, nnd tho bottom eloso, and of strongor cane. Tho lid, wbiclt works 011 cano hingos, the handles, and shape, aro on H10 princi ple of tbo ordinary coffin. Tho manu facturer volunteored astatemontto tbo effect that it had been mado to tho order of a lady, who fancies bcrsclf to bo 011 tho vorgo of etornity, and who insists upon being buried in tho baskot work coffin. Thinking that her rolations might interforo wbon it would bo too lato for her to have a say in tho matter, she uow requires that that ariiclo shall bo in tho house before slio gives up tho ghost. He refused to givo this eocontiic lady's name, but could positively assuro us that these woro facts, and that the medical faculty had withdrawn nil hope of bor recovery. Tbo coffin is toroinain by ber bedside until hor death when she will -bo placed in a shroud, put into tho wiokorwork- surrounded with moss, and deposited in tho earth from whoneo sho came.
