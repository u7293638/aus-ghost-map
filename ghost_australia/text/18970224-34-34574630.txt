There i> no otiier way than that of the cross. : Governments have tried to find a way and have ; and so have etiucaacn, art, science, and /rmihariitanmiain. However much the world has advanced human nature is still the same. -It is corrupt, sinful, depraved. Sm is not a "MfaiV", not an infirmity, '. Dot .a result ;of our environment nor the ootcoice of our ignorance. It is rebellion against God, and tbeantagohiun rf the will can only be removed and man recoocSed to God through tiu atoning merit ctJerosdiri^ personally applied to the heart Tho'primitive church made ample provision . lor the interchange of Christian thought among Sa members, but of the mode in which it was ? practised we iave so distinct account 'The eight or ten members of John Wesley's class . meeting were -sharers in one life and one fcope, end therefore they desired com munion. This, too, is what oor church fc?? desired to meet ?n her monthly ???-; ch'nrch-fellowship meetings. Let ns attend . oor das% meeting? and eocourage our neople to _~" do so.

And so will Slieylje to-day if tne,?>ame elements unite. T^-ilaUiUu been said about Jbo manner of cuu- jfaaiagonT.i??M?hip j moetmga. Xhare should they should be carried on. From the first the dass meeting has been the training-ground of the church, and from it has come, our Sunday-school teachers, our leaders and stewards, our local preachers and our ministers. Abandon the class-meeting and we give up that which has been the conservator of our use fulness and strength. It is a safeguard against the sacerdotal tendencies of our time. In certain quarters to-day there is a great in difference to all organised Christian life. Men are impatient of all lands of restraints. The cry is for liberty. But it must be borne in mind that it is hot a matter of indifference whether a Christian man belongs to the organic fellow ship of the church and is a faithful member of it or not. It is a dear Christian duty to serve the fellowship and to be served thereby, and whoever neglects so to do most inevitably suffer in the spiritual life. The church most be a home; in coming into it we come to be ministered untoand to minister* .A. great inheri tance of Christian fellowship has come to us: let us hand it on, improved by having passed through our bands, to our children. Let-us speak well of the church which under God has ?made us what we are; and let us be loyal and faithful to her institutions. One of the needs of to-day is a little more healthy denomina tionalism. We thank God for the Christian Endeavor movement, recognising in it an agency which has great possibilities for helping the spiritual life of the young. Let up throw ourselves into it as far as possible. The young to-day need all the help "and counsel we can give them. The pleasures of 4in are fascinatingly attractive. The gulf stream of worldlmess runs smooth and subtle, and the tendency to irreverence, disobedience, and tho casting off of all restraint is strong. In addition to the^a Sabbath desecration is on the', increase. Cycling bas put a new temptation in the pith of the yotmc to-whjeh. we fear many are yield ing., .Sunday escuraion^and picakaare takinc the pljjce of attendance on Divine arpnhip. pernicious literature which scoffs atcyangcliqa] religion is?apping tneiife of the young. These are some of the evils against which pur young people -have to do battle to-day. Let us in* every possibla way help them to fight them. As a church we heartily endorse the great Bocial "movements which: are at work for the betterment of our fellow^citizeha. Methodism has sought to be the chqrch ofthe people. In her government the lowest member Las tree access to the highest courts. Whilst av-; dhi£ "psrty polities'' we emphasise the fact wiat it is the duty of all our people to take a living interest in the public affairs of the land. We are freo citizens in a great country, and it is our duty to exercise our rights in the fear of God. Oor vote is a sacred trcst, and as such we must exercise it. It is a shame to. our Christian commonwealth that any unmoral man should be allowed to occupy a seat in the halls of pur legislature or*in our municipali ties. Snch seats, and. such honor .and suctf responsibilities should he for the chaste, tem perate, and God-fearing men of the land; We pray that the will of God may be done on earth as it is in neaven. Lei us help God to answer this prayer by taking our .conscierce to the ballot-box. Ability or party considera tions should not be' the first considerations, but'character. I need not ask this Conference whether it is the will of God that im morality and lustful induigenceshould be made difficult; whether women should be reverenced and honored; that gambling, the curse of Australia and die destroyer of men and women, should be hanrenwl from the land ; that the system of sweating- should b? swept away'; that intemperance and other social evQs which ore a menace to die eocial lite of our country should be put down. With one voice you say yes. Then let us see that right and true men are sent forward as our representatives. Next to the regeneration of the individual is the re generation of tiie State. Let us help in the KxECHOX Of PRESIDE!!. Hie election of a new president resulted as follows:—Sot. J. Berry, TO; Rev. R. a Cmely,U;Eev.W.^. Langsfotd. 7: Bey. J.-aTreronow, S; fee*. W. B.

He pave them as a motto for the coming year "Back to the Holy Ghost." WaTthe Holy. Ghost then neglected, i he asked, and unhesitatingly he answered "Yes." One proof, of it could be seen in the tone of .mfldetn literature. Was the Holy Spirit neglected in their preaching? It it were not they would not have a report of ? decrease in the year's work. They would only get the da "fire 'back 'in the church when they got bade to the Holy -Ghost. The question of Methodist TJnion, which made this Conference such an important- one, was on c on which he was not now called to express an opinion, but to could say that every man of them wanted the'earns thing—they wanted to know the will of .God.. In that respect there was absolute agreement in this Con ference, and it-was surely for him to indicate the direction in wbick that will could be ascertained. It was only by adopting- the motto for the year and carrying it out—"Back to the Holy Ghost." (Applause.)
