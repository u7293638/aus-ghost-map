PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR'S GHOST. Apropos of the volume of the "Prince of Wales's Speeches," published by Mr. John Murray to-day, is it permissible (asks a correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette) to wonder— in the very lowest whisper —whether the Prinoo keeps a "ghost?" Every statesman (who can afford it) includes this useful adjunct in his household; and most of "the admirable speeches made by Mr. So-and* So yesterday" were written the day before by Mr. So-and-So's private secretary. Of course, these little do mestic details are not generally talked about. The only persons who make no secrecy about their ghosts are American millionaires, one of whom in ooming over to England and adver tising once for a private secretary, stated that the chief duties of the post would be to issue all his invitations and to write all his opeeohes. Perhaps the Prince of Wales is industrious enough to dispense with such aid. Bat, at any rate, he does not expect his son to do so. Prinoo Albert "Victor's ghost vu for some time the accomplished Canon Dalton; and I remember onoe being Bhown a quarto sheet of paper on which the worthy tutor had written out the terms not only of the Bpeech-in-chief, but even of Buch formalities as, " Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very heartily for the kind way in which you hare received me."
