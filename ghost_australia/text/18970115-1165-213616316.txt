U K Y, FRIDAY, J MOAT CROFT OR, THE GHOST OF A CRIME. By A. E, HOOPER. CHAPTER I. A STORMY CHRISTMAS EVE. It was a five-mile ride to Silcoat HaE from tfee .nearest station, and with tlie snow lyinar thickly on the ground and the wind blowing boisterously, it seamed dou&ie; that diatanoe. I had looked forward io a brisk gallop along the frost -hardened road, and had hoped to n?ach the Hall before the usual fun of Christmas Eve commenced: but it had Been snowing heavily all dcy, and by the time I alighted at ths little- junction. a.Ui tthe roads and the 'mlrrotsnd- ing country* were blotted from sight, arid; on mounting the only horse procurable at the Station Inn. I found that the- ssayw was above the beast's fetlocks 1 Tliere^ n _ as- n^Xtfrmg for it bus: to T.afe the best oS the disappointment: so,. piling the las>pets ofi my fur travelling-cap well i3own over my" "cars," arid turning up my coat-coilar,. I bent my hesd-to tSa; almost bliniisng- ftSa-s-t. arid spurred'my •horse into a- eani>e?. It was hot- Ions before I diseover&di; tTrat I was ihaiihted upon a knock-kneed, broken-vrifideill steed, whose frequent stumblings- 'and hoarse giisVtft&s;* ai&8e& to the o my almost frozen Ra^iets and the i~szixclike sharpness of'tlie : wind.

Cowards for theiti&st; part are those wiio-have not been trdined to courage. I kept up my heart for a- t≠ by anticipations of the copifort awaiting me at the end of my ride. 1? had been a CTHrfstmas : guest at Siliraat Hall tor the last three years, arid I' knew what to «ipeet. There 'would be tlie ©Id, silverhaired squire himself, stout, ffoYid, and genial-—the very soiil of Tiospiiiality; and hiis Tady, a gentlewoman ,o>T the old sefiool, with her fine old'face- beaming wel'e&Hie;, her antique dignity and courtesy, serving as an admirable- foil to the bTuff frankness of the master of the house. Then I should meetx Tom Silcoat, my special chum since " iJ5ie Winchester days, and together: we should fighf again our 'Varsity, battles, which seemed to belong to such anefent history, though the last : of them was scarcely two years old. Besides these, there would be the girls, and'the married brothers and sisters, the uncles and" awmts, and hosts Of gra-mtnilrildren, wlio aBEways gathered together at Silcoat at thi» season of the yean* Yes. it would' be a glad meeting, awd 1 as "merry Christmas," well worth thiss miserable ridie; I pictured to myself tlie great oak-panelled hall, gleaming with the light of hundreds of candles, tfte roaring "Fule log, the wreaths of shining holly.,- tthe grim portraits of Sffeo®ts dead and' gone, and the stands of armour worn asnd borne by the soldiers of the f&mily-; and, as the picture rose vividly before me, I spurred my horse into a quicker pace. It was a thoughtless, iiot to say a brutai; act, and I suffered for-it. The poor beast, more willing than capable, broke m4o an awkward gallop; sighing like a blacksmith's bellows, and then, quite- suddenly,he stumbled and'pitched forward upon his knees; flinging-me far over his head into a deep-drift of snow. Thankful for the first time for the snow, which had given me a soft* fall, and saved 1 my Bones, I scrambled tO'.nay feet, andi proceeded to help up my?, sorry steed. He had fallen lame, anj as he stood in the middle of the road, ganting and' trembling in every limb, I cursed my folly in refusing Tom Silcoa«*s offer to meet me with horses. Beins?uncertain of my time for leaving town, I had made up my mind to trust to my own feet or to the chance of findings horse at the Station Inn; and here I was, two miles from the station and three from Silcoait. nearly up to my knees-Ih snow, shivering at every fresh blast- of the icy wind, and burdened with a disabled horse.. Two. things were clear to me: I coulcl not leave the poor beast to its fate, and I would not go back to the inn. So I seized 1 the bridle, and walked onwards at a- sibw pace, with my astiiimatieal steed' sighing and limping along beside me. How long I had been plodding along I do not know, but proba?*Ty I had not covered more than half a mile when I caught siigltt of a light twinkling ahead of me. I then remembered to Have noticed, on former visits, that there was a little roadside inn, midway befenreen thejunetaon aind Silcoat Hall; and the thought of being near to any-place of shelter put fresh life into nee, and I strode forward as qucikly asVmv lame liorae coukf go. T6n mintrtes later I halted in -the midst of "tile stream of yellow light TOfSich flowed* across tfte road from the uncurtained windows of the inn parlor. A shout brought an ostler to the door,.and when I Bad given directions for ttfce care of my horse, and had seen hinr led away to> the stable. I went into thenar of the i Travellers* Rest. CHAPTER II.—THE STGStY OF A CRIME. ; There was a large and rather noisy pariy gathered in the cosy little inn parlor. and a place was quickly found fourme near the fire. I was glad to fling off my coat and cap, and stretch my sti.fi limbs out before the blaze: and, after exchanging a few words with the land- •ord about the weather, I settled mysylf iown into a corner to enjoy half an hour's rest before proceeding on myjourney. There had been a lu-M in the conversation and laughter as T entered, but theparty "soon grew used to my presence, and the* talk began again. ""You was a-saying as how you seed a light in the window ®' the Moat Croft; Bob." said a stout, splemn-faced mari v tapping his pipe against a bar of the grate. The eyes of all present were, turned towards a young man who"* gat just inside the door. He was a lanky, loosejointed youth, with a pale face and a pair of Vacant-looking eyes, which shifted their gaze from face to face before their owner answered. "Well", neighbor," said he, at last, in a thin, remedy voice, "an* it's true, as I'm ready tQ. take my Bible oath on it. An' I don't know as/it's. §0 strange, after all. seeing as it was the ifLoat Croft, an' Seeing as it was on Christmas Eve!" "No, no: Bob's right." murmured several voices. "Well, but tell us. Bob, did you go an* look into the windows?" asked the stout man by the fire. Again Bob allowed his eyes to wander from face to face for a moment, and then he,brought them to bear upon his questioner. "Before I.answer, p'r'aps you'll let me Ask you a question." he said. "Answer me this. Jacob .Meadows: Will you go now and look into the windows of the Moat Groft ?" ANUARY J5, 189 Severarof the men "laughed, asd all of them smiled, "with the exception of the stout man. He shifted uneasily on his seat/ and took a deep pull at "his steaming glass. Bob seemed to feel that he had seorwi a point, and he hastened to follow his advantage. "It's Christmas Eve, you know, Jacob," he said—"the night of the murder, you remember. Won •t vm, inst 1 take a lonely walk to the Moat Croft an' come back an" tell us what you see ? " Again there TO a lausto at the stout man's expense, aml'.it seemed to irritate him, for he tapped his pipe so hard against the grate that he broke its stem. "I orrl?* asked a civii question," he cried an aggrieved yoiee. "You needn't take it so sareastic-like Bs»b." "Well, Ho more, I needn't; Jaicob." returned Bcft>, who was apparently satls-- fieri with impression he had matter, and was nrel:a«?d to be magiiSsn-iTtMiis. "An' I'll juSR tell yoa'.that I .agSfo'C l«®4r;l into the" windows of the Sloat Ci*oft last Christmas ETfe.

' "You" see, sir;" explained the landlord, "there was a bloody murder'done at the' Moat Ctoft five year ago, and them as did'it got off an' eould never be traced."' "Only the corpse was found." said Bob. in a hollow tone. "Tell me the- story," I said. "There's not much of a story to* tell." returned the landlord, "for nobody knows-the rights of what happened/The Croft has stood" empty for ten year -an' more, an" now itfs likely to stand empty till it tumbles t& pieces.

"I think I said 'A pair of horses,' Johnny,'" said Jaeob. thoughtfully;- "I wouldn't be sure, sir: but, when Johnny says 'A carnage.' I think I said, 'With a pair of horses;'' "* "Weil, weil'. two horses an* a ipair ^ comes- much to the Same thing,said the landlord". 'T know the sound* of' the wheels. stopped, an' I said, 'It's somebody ee3 means to stop at the Rest.' So I goes to-the ctoor .an* I sees tile face of a dark, foreign-lookin' man at* the -carriage window. 'Some brattd'J^— sharp!* cries he. 'We've got somebodyill hie re—look alive!' .You may be sure- I wasn't long gettin' the brandy; and;as- I gave it into the carriage I caughc sight of three people inside. There wasthe dark, foreign man, a beautiftrT young wioman with yellow tiaift who* was ery£n'; and a young gentleman wba was lying back, with his eyes siiut. r shall never forget that young gentileman's face, sir. I took partic'Iar notstee et'it at the time, for he looked' dfeat-frlypal'e. He was fair enough to be the Tady's brother. An' I have good" cause to remember him, for the n«??rt time r saw l'rim he was a corpse—a > murd'e-red' I corpse, sir!" "How was that ?" I asked: "Well. sir. the carriage dsccve-onv an" I" thought no mtfre' .about it- till nt^vs-. was brought to the Rest on- Christmasmorning that murder had been done at the Croft. I went to the olid' frouse with others, an' when I told about the. carsri'age T was showed the corpse. A»- T say, it was that, .very -.young mail,, stabbed' to*.'the heart"with ,a ijueer^ foreign-looking knife. J 'for the carriage and the two other people; nothing 'as ever been heard of tllem—leastways folk do say: as they might* be seen "near the Croft on any Christmas Eve: but .nobody cares to go an'* look for 'em." : The landlord mopped 1 his forehead, -Which liafi grown damp;-white he was speaking; and as he looked round the room his guests ^.ll shook their heads. < "Dp you mean to say that none of you will guide me to- Silcoat Hall for half-a-sovereign ?'* I" a-sfefc. " If you like 4® go the five-mile round, sir. I'll take you . for half that," said Bob. "No: I'll go by the- Moat Croft." T said. "Then twenty suvereigns wouldn'ttake me," he cried; and all the rest nodded. "Then I must go alone/' - I buttoned up my coat-and pulled 011 nay cap, while the whole.company gazed at me in surprised displeasure.- - "Y.ou say I must^turn -up a--tane- t<> the Croft? Is it all plain sailing afterwards?"' I asked, "after I had paid my reckoning and given instructions about my horse. "You cant miss the lane. It's the only turning to the right," returned the landlord: "an* if you get safely past the Croft, you must take.the second turn: .to the left, an' go straight on to the Hall. You'll see the Silcoat lights to your left vrk^n you get to the Croft. But if you'll take my advice, sir, you'll go the five- I mile round." 7 I laughed and shook my head, and then, hiring bidden the comi>any good night, 1 left the Travellers' Best and went out into tbe storm.

The girl had withdrawn her hand, and. was looking at me in surprise, and I could only bow stiffly, and say: "I—1 beg your pardon; I was a little startled for a moment." "Well, well ; sit down." said Tom. "See! they are putting the lights out." We sat down on the nearest chairs, and as we did so, the hall grew nearly dark. Just before us I saw a pair of heavy black velvet curtains, and presently a strong wliite. light was brought to bear iipdn the place where the curtains were slightly separated. Naturally every eye in the hall was fixed . upon this spot, and as I -gazed at .it,* a. feeling of strange uneasiness-crept over me. \- Suddenly the bliick curtains parted' slightly, and a pale face appeared at the aperture. Then, indeed. I gave a spasmodic gaisp. and pinched myself to •... see if I were awake. The face was the face of a young man. waxen in. its delicacy, and fair and' beautiful enough to be the face of Stella Silcoat's brother! ' "For Meaven's sake, tell me what this means, Tom !'" I whispered, hoarsely. "Why, what's got Into you, man?" he replied. "Can't you guess ? My Uncle Gerad's a ventriloquist, and that's his lay figure. Handsome chap. Isp't he?" Tom's voice was drowned in an out-' burst of clapping and cheering as the curtains were parted again for a moment to allow a second figure to pass through —the figure of a tall, foreign-looking man. with, black, pointed beard and' moustachlos. He was dressed In a suit of ruby velvet, and" wore the sword of an Italfan nobleman: and as he bowed to the company, Tom whispered: "That's my Uncle Gerad." I sank back into my chair in a state bordering upon collapse. I wanted to yell' aloud with Jaug&ter.but; I was afraid' if would disturb tfte entertainment. The • sudden tansition from tragedy to comedy-was almost too ntuch for my already excited nerves, and I was thankful that IJncTe Gerad's entertainment proved to be>of a comic nature- As it was, some of tfte graver children Tooked at me in astonishment from tinre to time to see if ii: could possib?i« be ®grown-up man whowas laughing so heartily at a children's^ entertainment."'" • After the affair was over and the children had: ali-gone fe bed. thie W^er'inem- ' bers of the compajry gathered round thej Yule log and. somebody suggested Shost jstories.
