THE EDUCATION QUESTION. OPINIONS 01? THE RELIGIOUS PRESS, (cnoncii or ENGLAND MESSENGER.) The real question, however, ia not whether the measure ia popular, but whether it is tight Here wo have a bods of our fellow citizena, membcra witü us of Christ s Church, though divided from our brunch of that church na much by their histor) is by their doctrines, appealing to ua with passionate protestations not to prevent them from bring ing up their children us their conaciencea re quire them, and giving pledfo of their sin crity by sinl ing all political differences in order to combine upon tina Bingle object A\ o cannot pretend to doubt tlint the disabilities they wish removed are real We ourselves, tliouc.li pressed by them leas heavily, are compUinmgof them ia intolerable Very much of the 1 inguage Hi it our Roman CUholic neighbours are now em plojmg ia the echo of what Ins been said Ly our bishop and other leading men of our church What anaiver, then ahull no nuke to their appeal' We cannot desire their children to recoil e no religious inatruc tion while we are moving heaven and earth to get it for our own We cannot mean that we would raiher they received none than they should be taught it by their own priests Knowing as care has been taken that we shall know, what the absence of religious instruction will mean to the next generation that would be too monetroua a position for Christian men to take up The most bigoted Protestant believes, at least, that there are good and pious men and women to be found in the Roman com munion, but he cannot believe that any good ness or piety is compatible with blank ignor ance of the foundation truths of morality and faith Even upon the most ultra anti papal principles, it must surely be better to give the children the chance of becoming good and pious Roman Catholics than to leave them in the slough of infidelity and vice We were all ready-and we should be ready again, if we had the chance-to accept the payment by result system all round But that is now past praying for, and need not be discussed by us anj longer Hie country IB pledged to the existing net, and so, to a great extent, aro we But if we would have accepted that system <n tato what principle can we be violating if we accept so much of it as concerna the Roman C ithohcs letting them simply have the aid that pay ment by results would have given them' To insist that they shall have no religious in struction except by joining with other re ligions bodies in some common scheme is unworthy and suicidal-unworthy, for it mocks them with an offer of facilities which we know they cannot accept, suicidal, for it effectually bars our own movement, which can only be successful by the churches being agreed Hie future of religious instruction m this colony is depending upon the ans« er now to be given not so much to Sir John 0 Shanaaay B bill aB to the Roman Catholic demand that ia behind it Let us make up our minds, then, .what we wish that answer to be, that we may not miBS our ann by playing at croBB purposes If this ia what wo mean that, a general payment by result syatcm Buch as Judgo Iellovvs proposed, being now out of the question, we are willing, pro vided that religious instruction be reatored to the Btate schools upon the plan agreed on ni the late conference of leading members of the Protestant denomination, to let the Church of Rome stand out with a grant for ita own achoola, let ua say so with no uncertain sound The Roman Catholics are evident!) counting upon our co operation I he general presa ia not quite sure of the position, and is looking to the churches to declare what they really mean If we sit still and make no sign, there will be an end in all probability, of the Catholic demand and an end, too, for many a long day, of all hope of Boiling the religious instructiondifliculty for ouraelvea But if we will mako a sacn lice of sectarian prejudices to the spiritual nghta of our neignboura, the opportunity is oura now to show that w e hav e indeed the religiouB welfare of tbo children in the colon) ot heart, and m helping to redress the Catholic grievance to secure the benefit we Beek for the whole commumtj (WESLITAV SrtCTlTOn) The question which we have to consider is whether we can consent to the elmina of the Koman Catholics being conceded If by a Bort of Bide wind, their demand amounts to a separate grant for their denomination, our answer IB plain- II e cannot consent Such a demand must be opposed moat earneatl) and peraiatcntly Our church does not ask for any return to denominationalism Not one of the Protestant churches, deanes it All of them would, we are Bure, emphatically reaist any attempt of that kind What the Pro testants do not ask for themselves they cannot be expected to give to the Roman Catholics One thing ia clear, that no large section of the community is aatiafied w itl> the Educa tion Act in ita operation , and the danger of the present movement ia not ao much from the Roman Catholic agitation as from the action of those Protestants who are juatl) m cenaed w ith tho shameful violation of good faith which has charoct»nsed the administra tionoftbeactbyeveryMnnstrj Tbel2thclause of the act vv aa framed for the express pur poae (and with the distinct assurance tint it would be ao U8ed) of enabling reb¿ioua teach jng to bo given in school buildings, before or after Behool hours , but from the time of Mr Stephen until now this clause haa been aya tematically aet aBide and, with just a few ex ceptiona, the building have been closed against the teacher ot religion liad tho school buildings, under suitable regulations, been available to Protestant ana Roman Catholic mimatera alike, tho cry of persecu tion, which the latter church ia now using so effectively, would have had no force, because religious teaching could have been given ni the school buildings out of school hours What course should bo pursued by the Wesleyan Church at the present juncture we shall not now venturo to indicate, be cause we understand that the Education Committco ia to meet shortly, and to it belongs the right and duty of con nexional action We may briefly say, that our object should bo to secure the Bible in the atato school, with liberty to uao the biddings before or after school hours for religious teaching Hitherto the act has been vv orked in the interests of the Bmalleat and bittereat of the sects, vi/, " the secularists It ia time that Chria tmnity, winch has been excised from the Behool booka, should assert its right and be no longer excluded from our scliool build inge. (SOUTIILBV cnoss ) It is wiso ana just to treat the Catholic agitation with respect though when the prieata begin ao to fight with ghoatls weapons to fulminate excommunications to threaten the terrora of purgatory, to reiuae baptism to infants and bunal to tlie dead in order to carry out their polie) a feeling is very apt to rise, compounded one half of con tempt and the other half of indignation If the Romanists, however, are showing themselves to bo in earnest, we muât bo in earneat too , and it is surely time for Pro testants to organise Wo need to have defined aims, an intelligible policy, and a reaolute and agreed cftort to gno effect to that policy The idea of a r Bible Union baa boon flitting to and fro, like a ghost, through Pro testant circlea and it ia surely timo the idea found practical embodiment Dr Moor house is, by tho active part ho baa taken m the matter, the natural leader of the Protestant churches on thia subject, and it would, undoubtedly, be opportune on his part to convene a meeting of all thoae who will join with lum on the basis of auch a union 'Io drift, to bo mere waitera on chance to allow a qucation in which wo aro vitally interested to be settled by othera, is a position neither dignified nor useful Let there be formed a Protestant orgamaation wbich shall havo for its object tho mainte nance of the general principles of the present educational system, and their amendment where amendment ia deemed necessary Will Dr Moorhouse move in the matter' TO THE EDITOR OF THE Allans Sir,-As you wero good enough to insert my letter show ing the defects in one of the measures propoaed for the relief of Cathohca from tho present educational burden laid on them, perhaps you will kindly allow mo to point out the inadmiaaibility of aeveral other plans which have been much spoken of, that the ground may be cleared for a definite pro position by the adoption of which juatico can be done to Cathohca without any injustice to the Btate, or to private individuóla or uistitu tiona 'Ihe Rev Dr Corbett at the St Kilda meeting, is reported to havo said-1 I should be very sorry to prevent free discuaaion and tina expreaaion of opinion, being so fully in accordance with the spirit of British con stitutional liberty and p irliamentary go vernment, shows that neither clergy nor lniiy are averse to a full examination ot tlio chums they aro about to put forward What form their claima will eventually t iko I have no means of knowing, and the suggestion I venturo to make ia offered on my ow n re sponsibility At the same time, I enjoy no monopoly of the idea, which ia now working ita way eftectually among reflecting Catholics I consider the Protestant public baa alao a light to diacuBa the subject, ao that whatever plan be finally adopted may be unobjection able to them Besides the plan spoken of in my first letter, three olhera have been men tioned - 1 A B»parato grant to Catholics 2 A renewal of the old capitation system 3 A system (unexplained) of payments by resulta and a capitation rate The firBt of these Protestants would natu rally object to, nor havo I heard a singlo educated Catholic express a wish for it Tlie only people who adv ocato it aro thoao who don t know tho meaning of the words they use A section of the press appears to wiall the public to believe that Cathohca wanta separate grant 1 hey dont Hie old capitation system ia to be con demned, because it did not pay schools on their ment8, but on the merits of other Bchoola namely, the nearest st ite schools It also frequently inflicted other pecuniary hardships on mdiv idual teachers , and, worst of all, under that system the Btate had no guarantee that good secular instruction was given Ihe third plan referred to abov o I admit I don t clearly understand But if it doca not secure perfect equ ihty for all classes of the community it ia defective, and whether it docs secure equality or not, it is not so simple ÜB that I proi oae It ai neara to mc justice to all would be attained by an amendment of the present act bated on the following principles - 1 That teachers in Catholic achools be examined and classified exactlv aa state teachera are a proviaional elasaification being made to allow fair time for examina tion 2 That Catholic schools bo inspected and examined exactly aa Btate schools are S That teachers in Catholic schools be p ud exactly as state school te imbers are 4 That appointments m Catholic schools reBt with the correspondent recognised by the department of 1 ducation subject to fixed conditions aa to claaaification of teachera and amount of secular instruction 5 ihat Cathohca find their own land and build their own schoola, but be aupplied w ith school rcquisitea aa state achools are, and on the same conditions By this plan, which would disturb no ex isting arrangement8 tho whole of the Catholic schoola would be brought within the junadiction of the Lducation department BO far as Bocular teaching goes, and would become incorporated m the Btate system which would then be a truly national system embracing all primary achoola m the colony 1 his plan, far from depriv ing any one of the benefit of the state Behool ay atem.'w ould ox tend the advantagea of that system to all And here, fair, I would place before the lovers of secular learning, and of our IcgiB 1 itors in particular, an important considera tion m reference to a material flaw m the present state system of primary m Btruction Those who are moat ardent in opposing the improvement of the pre aent act raiae the cry that this act must be maintained "in its integrity" Permit me to remind Bach people of the fact that the act nov er had an integrity It vv oa de vised to secure sound secular education to all the children attending primary schools m Victoria It waa BO ill devised, however that it never has had, and never can have, such a result Sound secular education has indeed, been Becured to children in the state schools and the fact ia guaranteed by the Behool inspectors But there aro now some 23 000 children in denomination ii primary schools under teachers for the most part unclaasified, and the state has no guarantee whatever that tho children in these achoola receiv e sound secular inatruc tion I '1 Ina is a difficulty which the Govern ment sooner or later, will have to grapple with and by adopting the definite proposition now suggested it ceasoB to be a difficulty I submit, then, that if the supporters of the prêtent act really wiah to be assured that solid secular knowledge ia being imparted in all primary schools, that assurance they can have by improving the act so aa to ¡,ive it the full effect it ought to havo Mr Mirams I believe, stated m Parliament recently that J.800 000 would be wanted yet for state school buildings This amount may be cutdovvn one fourth by doing justice to the Catholics, aa the latter would lind their own achools In conclusion, Sir, how can anyone bo looked on aa a friend of the present act if he docs not wish to see ita benefits extended to the whole community' When it baa the hearty support of a united people there will be no lnaiiimouiitable financial difficulty 'I ill it RPciirpH such sunnort it will always be a thorn in the aido of the body politic -I am, J.
