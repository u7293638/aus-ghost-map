THE HOSPITAL ANNUAL ENTER M?ENTS. \------- TH se8ond and last entertainment of. the season will take place this evening at the Victoria Theatre, and should from every standpoint be as sucoessful as its predecessor was on Thursday. The escenes from "Ham let" and "Othello," with Mr. O. H. EHannell in the ~itle role and Mr. Harry Leston as the Ghost and Iago, which were so eminently senoeessful, will be again,played, and we can assure those who have not seen them that they have a rich treat in store should they attend the theatre this evening. The concert part of the programme intro duces several singers who did not take' part on Thursday, and who arce all firet-olass performers. One of the great features of the entertaiement will be the violin solo of Mr. Allpress. This gentleman has given his services to assist the good cause in hand, and no doubt will be heartily welcomed and his superb playing duly appreciated. The bicycle will be on view at the theatre during the performance, It is a splendid article, and complete with lamp, &o.; The lucky winner will have cause to be satisfied with it. Mr. and Mrs. Han nell have generously given the machine fof the benefit of the hospital. It will, doubt less, be the means of largely increasing the funds of the institution, and a monster audienoe is expected. The Mayor will supervise' the drawing, assisted by a com. mittee selected by the audience. Mr. Hannell has had made a proper box, in which the tickets are to be placed and which is so con structed that they will be well mixed up ere the lucky number is drawi.
