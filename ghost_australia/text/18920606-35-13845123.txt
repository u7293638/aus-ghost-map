PITT-STREET CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. I THE PROBLEM OF THE POOR. I At the Congregational Church, Pitt-street, last evening, the Rev V Scott delivered a sermon on "ThoProblomof the Poor Suggested Bom dies " There was a large congregation The discussion was based on the text-" The blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up and the poor have the Gospel preached to them "-Matthew xi, c The preacher, in commencing his address said that the medical man saw his patients covered with foul sores, but he did not immediately presence outside applications He knew that it was in the blood, and the applied remedy would be to purify the blood It would be perfectly useless to depend solely upon external treatment The root of man's poverty and misery was man's moral and spiritual degradation, and the remedy must be radical Let ameliorative he applied, but he claimed that the only redemption of the poor from misery was the redemption from sin, and the means of that Redemption was the Creator of the infinite love, of the infinite sacrifice of the eternal Christ That was the only Gospel which could touch the root of the evil It could enter the dark chaos of the human heart, it could enter the dark cells of the human life it could uplift the very poorest to self-respect, and then beyond reigned the canopies of possibilities He wanted them to look upon the wreck of our city life, the honors of our city life, and the polluting foulness of our city life. He know London well, and he was told that every eleventh person they met was a recipient in some measure and at some time of the year of poor law relief There were many poverty- stricken in that great city, and their rags and tatters were the outward signs of their poverty The self-satisfied and more favoured people of the city passed them by, and appeared to regard these poor wretches as just as much a part of the living landscape as the locks and shoals were a part of the natural landscape The brotherhood of man never entered their hearts They passed on, and never for a moment thought of the ghost of misery which had crossed their path of And then what did they find here, in this very centre of the world's civilisation, in this free land under this glorious sun, in this land which should be free from the wreckage of the old land, and which should have begun a free life unfettered by the bonds of old Governments P Tho degradation and the misery and the poverty which they found at home would he found in some measure at least here there was homes-God save the mark '-homes in Sydney as vile, polluted, immoral, and as degraded as they could find in London There were homes in this very city where father, mother, boys and girls occupied one room In such demand Plums 03 they had in Sydney there was little chance for the children. It was gratifying, however, to think that so far they had no paper law here, and they were better without one Such a law brought precious little lives up in the pathway of rome There were many children in Sydney at that moment vi hose of future must be associated with crime and sin in every department of life, and why? Because there was no love, no health, and no decency And then they came to the important question, " Is there no remedy, apparent for the little children i "Were there no means, no remedies that would take these little children away from the little) homes ? Could not they take them away of John these houses named í Could not the law compel the landlords to provide rooms commensurate with the demands at least, so far us dividing space was concerned? The preacher then dealt with the train- ing School ships of London and elsewhere He sympathised with those who thought it a crime to send little children to gaol The Christian instincts and Christian principle of our Christian life in the city ought to devise some means to prevent the sum of your lives Had our legislator nothing better to do in this southerly land Ihm to fight the faction fights and to tax human life P Could not they turn their attention to social problems and remedy the wrongs existing in their very doors, instead of fighting)' over local issues P The neglect of the little chilcUcu led to an increase in the ranks of the larrikins und scoundrels who In ed with girls of tender years in open sin He wanted to see the multiplication of the means that would take them and grasp them from such polluted heads of sm and rum, and make it possible for them to grow into honest men and w onion Another important aspect of the question was drink, that which fostered and developed came, and which was licensed licensed by the Government to create drunk ada He did not know what the figures w ere here, but from observation he should think that in proportion to the population, drunkenness born could not be loss-he fancied it was greater than in the old country In England £30,000,000 was spent in drink annually a sum sufficient to redeem the whole country from poverty In Birmingham there vi 010 1300 public-houses licensed to make j drunkards The took of those were w stood, and it was found that out of one of them came a OR persons in one day the worse for drink, and on the following morning only 18 out of that number were arrested At drinks door laya mighty responsibility Were there no means of checking this terrible curse? Were there no means of standing between the poor drunkard and the doom which was beyond P A simple change in the licensing laws of Sweden, by putting the liquor in the hands of people not interested in selling it, had reformed it from a drunken into a temperate country Then there was General Booth's scheme, which now called every success, for the reason that General Booth recognised that no permanent benefit could accrue, and men and women could not be drawn out of their degradation and poverty, until the soul was touched with the power of 6 x1 in the gospel of Jesus Christ The poor, he had found were more kind to the poor than wore the rich, because they sympathised with each other, and their jo) s and sorrow were the entire property of their community, but with the nell the reverse was the case there were numbers of people who liked to give their usual guinea to the various public charities, and who liked to be included among the munificent gives, hut they should give their own, and not other people's property They should preach the Gospel, and give what was theirs It was not to tell the story of the Bible in a perfunctory way It was to administer their faith until that faith touched their hearts, and assured them, even in the midst of their poverty Whatever means they might use to help the poor for a moment or for a time was not theirs to give, it was first God's, and then it belonged to every man who needed What they could and should give of their own w 000 the spiritual blessings of their spiritual life. He trusted, 111 conclusion, that his remarks upon such an important question might hear fruit
