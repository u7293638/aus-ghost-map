THE GEELONG RACES. Tho annual race meeting of the Geelong Racing Club will bo commenced to-day on tho racecourse atMarBballtown. There are sis events on the programme, for each of which there are very fair entries, and there was last night no alteration m the names as mentioned below. The only scratching on the board was that of Britisher for the Handicap, to bo run for to-morrow. Although there was a fairly large attendance of sporting men at the Victoria Hotel last evening, there was really no straight-out betting on any of the horses, backers preferring to make their wagers on the course to-day. There has been a good deal of " tipping " for the events to be run to-day, but a correspondent, "Cliflio, prefers to differ materially with some of the sporting men, and plunges for the following without any reluctances Handicap Hurdle Race -Ace, 1st ; xet Again, 2ud; Goodwood, 3rd. Railway Stakes-The Nun, 1st; Walhalla, 2nd. Sires Produce Stakes— Perfume, 1st; Tabard, 2nd ; Nectarine, 3rd. Gold Gup —Meteor, lBt; Sheet Anchor, -11 , Camerine, 3rd. Connewarre Plate— ihe Ghost, 1st; Idalia, 2nd ; Lubra, 3rd. Grand Stand Stakes—Kohai, 1st; Straight Shot, 2nd ; Tempest, 3rd. Of course the tipBters for the sporting papers differ materially, but that does not matter, as at best the whole is guess • work. The catering in the grand stand and saddling paddock enclosures is to be performed for the public by Mr Skinner, of South Melbourne, whilst the outside public may have every confidence of boing well provided for by Mr J. O'Keefc, of tho Belmont Hotel.
