COLLIERY TROUBLES. Newcastle, Tuesday. A diihculty has cropped up in the leasing of the New Lambton Colliery to a party of miners who were about to work it on tribute. Work should have commenced yesterday, as it was undor- stood that all preliminaries had been arranged whereby tho tender of the men who were working at the mine up to August 1, when operations were ens- ponded, to run it on co-operative lines, and place the coal in the proprietors' waggonB at the pit top at 5s 9u for round and 2s for Bmull coal bad been accepted. Just when everything seemed ready for a favorable commencement under tho new Bystcm a hitch— the precise nature of which is not known — occurred, and so far no satisfactory settlement has been arrived at. On August I wages to tho amount of £250 were due to the 50 men employed at at the East Lambton Mine, but, in theatrical parlance, the " ghost did not walk," either on that day or any day since, and the men, after waiting patiently for over a week, have nnw put the matter in the hands of Mr. W. Hparke, solicitor.
