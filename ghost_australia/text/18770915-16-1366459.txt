Tile Other World. The April number of the Church Quarterly Review magazine written and edited by men of great scholarly attainments contains a remarkable paper on the ' Other AS world which gives a startling addition to the many existing stones which testify to appearances of a dying man at the moment of death to distant friends Here it is - The fact is that this class of what are called ghost stories s so numerous and s > thoroughly well authenticated, that the hesitation would rather be an t whether they be A paper by supernatural at all We mean that the question arises whether it may not be possible in the nature of things under tertaincircumstances for the departing spirit to in unrest itself to distant friends at the instant, the fleeting moment, of transition from this world to the other 1 If any one replies, of how he is in not even more common ? our answer is easy There are numbers of things quite natural which are much more uncommon than the well ascertained Instances of this class of event in the house in which these pages are written, a tall and v. ide staircase window, with a northern aspect, throws a strong side light on the entrance into the chief living room, which stands at the end of a passage running nearly the length of the house It was after midday, m midwinter, many years since, that the writer left his study, which opens into the passage just mentioned, on his way to his early dinner The day was rather foggy, but there was not density of vapor, yet the door at the end of the passage seemed obscured by mist As he advanced, the mist, so to call it, gathered into one spot, deepened, and formed itself into the outline of a human figure, the head and shoulders becoming more and more distinct, while the rest of the body seemed enveloped in a gauzy, cloak like vestment of many folds, reaching downwards so as to hide the feet, and from its width, as it rested on the flagged passage, giving a pyramidal outline The full light of the window fell on the object, which was so thin and tenuous in its consistency that the light on the panels of a highly varnished door were visible through this lower part of the dress It was altogether colorless, a statue carved in mist. The writer was so startled, that he is uncertain whether he moved forward or stood still He was rather astonished than terrified, for his first notion was that he was witnessing some hitherto unnoticed effect of light and shade He had no thought of anything supernatural, tell, as he gazed, the head was turned towards him, and he at once recognised the features of a very dear friend The expression of his countenance was that of holy, peaceful repose, and the gentle, kindly aspect which it was in daily life was intensified (so the writer, in recalling the Bight, has ever since felt into a parting glance of deep affection And then, man instant, all passed away Hardly, till then, did he realise that he had been brought into close communion with the supernatural The result was great awe, but no terror, so that instead of retreating to his study he went forward and opened the door, close to which the apparition had stood Of course he could not doubt the import of what he had seen, and the morrow or the next day's post brought the tidings that his friend had tranquilly passed out of this world at the time when he was seen by the writer It must be stated that it was a sudden summons that the writer had heard nothing of it in for some weeks previously, and that nothing had brought him to his thought on the day of his decease '
