I THE SUGAR ÏIKKT INDUSTRY. The proposai of Mr. Leo, M.L.A., to establish the sugar beet Industry In Tenterfield, and other parts of New England bus, it .would seem, come to grief. At any rate, lt has been suspended. Without a .great difficulty Mr, Lee got a number of farmers in his electorate to promise to produce a certain quantity of beet-roots per annum, under conditions regarding, price that were named by him. That work having been accomplished, he I old the farmers that he intended going to the London market for capital to. erect crushing and refining plant. To ray mind, that wns an indication that Mr. Lee had not much'confidence in his. scheme.: For the capital required was, he'said, only £20,000, and if the enterprise was the good thing he represented it to be, there should have been no difficulty in getting the requisite capital in New South Wales, But in view of the complete removal of tbs sugar duties, there was- not a capitalist tn this colony who would Invest u Bingle ten pound note in the speculation. Perhaps .lt was . thought that some capitalists in England would be more gullible than the local possessors' of surplus coin, but they have proved that, so fur us the Tenterfield, proposed sugar industry 1B con- cerned, they are not. German beet sugar, they told Mr, Lee In effect, will be poured into New South Wales in such quantities and at such prices when the duties are completely removed that the local beet sugar producers would not have a ghost of a show against the foreign manufactures. If Mr, Lee did not know that,, he must be very ignorant. No more, I predict, will be heard of the Tenterfield beet-root industry until the sugar duties have been re-imposed.
