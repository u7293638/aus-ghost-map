THE CHUECH IN THE WOELD. UNIVERSALITY OF CATHOLIC FAITH. No one of the distinctive marks of the Church is, perhaps, so universally shared with all organiza tions sprung from it as the vital power of growth and expansion, which produces from the smallest germ results the most far-reaching and wide spreading. The general distribution of different forms of religion is summed up in the following table : — MONOTHEISTS. Catholics.-, ? 217,000,000 Protestants ? 124,000,000 , Schismatics..; ? 84,000,000 ? Jews ? 7,000,000 j Mussulmans ? 169,000,000 1 IDOLATOB8. Brahminists ? 170,000,000 Pure Buddhists ? 7,000,000 Buddhists, Taouists, and Conf usian ists. ..............:....................... 390,000,000 Buddhists and Shintoists........... 36,000,000 Pagans ? 233,000,000 ,1437,000,000 It will be seen, that Buddhism, with kindred associated forms of belief, is the most widely diffused of all creeds, and its adherents equal in number those of Catholicism, Protestantism, and the Greek schism. Catholicity is the most numerous of any body professing one definite doctrine and subject of one Head. All other creeds, like that of Protestant ism or of Buddhism, are split into antagonistic sects. Catholicity, though outnumbered in popu lation, claims universality in point of space. The Chair of St. Peter alone claims supremacy over all peoples and tribes, and tongues ; only the Church of Eome acknowledges in space no limit, as in time no term. The whole earth is mapped out between twenty Missionary Societies, some made up of Eegulars and some composed of Secular clergy for whom the College of Propa ganda is the oldest and greatest training school. The islands of Japan, the Corean Peninsula, ihe steppes and forests of Mandchuria are an appanage of the Missions Etrangers of Paris, that heroic novitiate of martyrdom ; Kansu and Mongolia offer a vast and difficult; field to the labours of the Belgian Missionaries. The middle Kingdom is divided between five Orders ; in the north and centre are the Lazarists and the humble and de voted Franciscans who gave Pekin its first Arch bishop ,in 1590 j in the west the Dominicans and Jesuits, the latter the founders of the flourishing Missions of the seventeenth cen .tu'ry '; and in the east and south again Les Missions Etrangeres, which have the lion's share, as they occupy more than a third of the superficial area of China. Passing on to the Indo TUhinese Peninsula, we find the same enterprising society in almost exclusive possession of its vast block of territory, only a seventh of which is shared with the Domincians and the Milanese Foreign Missions. In Hindostan the high ground at the foot of the Himalayas is occupied by the Capuchins, while at three angles of the Peninsula/ at Calcutta, at Madure, and Mangalore the Jesuits are established, with the Mill Hill Missionaries and Irish priests at Madras, and the Salesians of Annecy, Fathers of the Holy Ghost, Carmelites, Benedictines and Foreign Missionaries of Paris and Milan in the centre and on other points of the coast. In Ceylon, the Oblates make head against three enemies at once — the gums of Brahma, the bonzes of Buddha, and the marbouts of Mohammed. Persia belongs to the Lazarists'; Mesopotamia to the Dominicans ; Syria and Armenia to French and Italian religious, Jesuits, Franciscans, Lazarists, and Carmelites. Africa offers a field where the energies of all the Missionary Societies may find ample scope, and in addition to those already existing, three new Congrega tions, the Algerian Missionaries, and the African Mission of Lyons and of Verona, have been specially founded for its evangelization. The Jesuits on the Nile and Zambesi, the Fathers of the Holy Ghost on the Zanzibar and Guinea coasts ; the Capuchins in Tunis ; Lazarists, Franciscans, and Oblates of Mary in other parts of the continent,- all vie with each other in the Herculean task of the conversion of Africa. In the New World the work' of the evangelization of the Indians is still being carried on by the Jesuits, who early succeeded in winning the sympathies of these savages, and by the Bene dictines, who have entered on tho work with redoubled zeal, while that of the still wilder Patagonians in the extreme south has been recently undertaken for the first time by the Salesians of Turin, founded by Dom Bosco. The scattered islands of the ' Pacific are divided be tween the Society of Mary and the Congregation of the Sacred Heart, while the great island of Borneo, only recently rendered accessible, falls to the English Missionaries of Mill Hill' 3 arid New Guinea has just assisted at the first Mass ever said upon its shores, by the Fathers of the society of Issoudun, to whom that mission has recently been confided. In addition to the regular Orders and Missionary Congregations a great number of secular priests are working with equal zeal in the Old and New Worlds among the North American and East Indians, negroes, and mixed races of Asia. To give an idea of the number of priests sent out by Europe to the East, we subjoin some figures taken mainly from the Madras Directory of 1886. In British India and Siain Les Missions Etrangeres of Paris have 8 bishops and 259 priests ; their brethren of ^Milan, 1 bishop and 25 priests ; the Jesuits, 4 bishops and 241 priest 3 the Oblates of Mary, 2 bishops and 72 priests; Carmelites, 3 bishops and 458 priests ; Capuchins, 3 bishops and 65 priests ; Salacians of Arirecy, 1 bishop and 30 priests 5 Benedictines, 2 bishops and 17 priests. In the whole of this region there are 26 bishops, 2 Prefects Apostolic, 1198 priests, 1,220,598 Catho lics, 1662 schools and 74,591 children in attend anca. In addition to the above^ there are 165 priests and 128,513 Catholics under the jurisdic tion of the Archbishop of Goa. In the further East, 19 bishops and 613 of the Missions Etran geres, of Paris, are working side by side with 3 bishops and 27 priests of the Belgian Missionaries, and 2 bishops and 26 priests of the Milanese Foreign Missions with 2 Jesuit bishops and 153 priests, forming with Lazarists, Franciscans, Do minicans, and other orders, a total' for the Chinese Missions of 47 bishops, 749 European and 749 native priests, 40 colleges, 16, convents, and 1,115,661 Catholics. Under the headship of the Propaganda the most active agency for the diffusion of the Missionary work has been the So ciety for the Propaganda of the Faith. Founded in Lyons, in 1822, with comparatively limited aims, it has become a world-embracing scheme of Christian co-operation. The alms collected' and disbursed by it in the sixty years of it3 existence amount to no less than 222 million francs, not far short of ten millions sterling, and largely through its assistance, more than 270 bishoprics, prefec tures, or vicariates apostolic have been created by the Holy See in heretic or infidel countries. The stimulus it has given to the apostolic ac tivity of the Church may be estimated by a com parison between the present ecclesiastical juris dictions in heathen countries and those existing at the time of its foundation. The. African continent did not then contain a single episcopal See, and the Cross was only planted on some points of its vast littoral. 2 archbishops, 16 apostolic prefec tures, and 17 vicariafces, are now distributed over its surface, leaving a comparatively small portion unappropriated by the Church. The Episcopate of Asia numbered in 1822 but twelve Sees, six in China, four in Indo-China, and two in India. Hindostan and Ceylon have now. 26 bishops and archbishops, with 1,200 priests 5 in Chinese Empire, Indo- China, and. Japan, the spiritual wants of a million and a half of faithful' are in charge of 50 vicars and prefects apostolic, and 1,400, priests, foreign and native. In North America, the ? Church was represented down to 1822 only by the archbishopric of Quebec and Montreal, with a vicariate apostolic for Upper Canada, and by three dioceses in the United States, with no more than about 12 priests in each. Now the Dominion contains 30 bishops and 2,000 priests, with a Catholic population of two millions, and the United States 77 bishoprics and archbishoprics, 7,000 priests; and eight mil lions of Catholics. -Australia and Polynesia, which at thG date of the foundation of the Society, were absolutely without Catholic organization, have now 23 bishops adminstering to the wants of increasing congregations in Australia, New Zealand, and the islands of the Pacific. The genoral distribution of the Catholic population of the globe is as fol lows : — Area . ' . Sq. Miles. Population. - Catholics.

The modern revolutionary spirit is universally hostile to all forms of authority, secular or spiritual ; but while temporal kingdoms may crumble into anarchy and annihilation before its onslaught, the Church will suffer no shipwreck in the storm, and will still reign' supreme, .though perhaps under ' changed conditions'. A glance .at the fore-going table will show how in the east, west, and south, her empire is fast extending, and how the ground won in these new lands more than .counterbalances the defection of older countries. The following paragraph concerning a rev. gentleman formerly connected with St. Ignatius' College, Eiverview, and well known in Sydney, wiil bo read with interest. — ' The Very Eev. John Eyan, S.J., preached in St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday on behalf of the Magdalen Asylum. Melboure. .The appeal was persuasive and touch ing, and the congregation responded most gene rously.'
