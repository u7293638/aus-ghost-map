A PLACE OF IDLENESS. ? » Some people suppose that it is easy to be idle in J whatever may of your lot may be cast (writes R S H. in the " World "). But to many natures idleness is almost an impossibility They are very modern , they cannot rest Accustomed, perhaps, to cities, to the vision and to the sound of everlasting tumult, peace irritates them, quiet almoB) alarms them The) learn to think that life is a hurrying thing, like the ant, and that only m death-which they are peculiarly anxious to my orders the) rest and take an everlasting and terrible holiday. 'they should go for awhile to one of those enchanted cases which still exist in a world of machinery and telegraph posts-to one of those places in which it is easy to be idle They should go, for instance, to the Sahara Desert, and dwell in the tents, not of Shorn, but of Biskra I am being idle in one of them now, in a white Moorish palace, above of whose manner floats in the pellucid as the flag of France. It is early morning and the English chaplain, who is wintering here, bits opposite me in the big lynched garden taking his coffee under a tree that may or may not be an umbrella pine Beyond his little table Hoods of pale pink and white roses are going up at the sun, which is already hot over the site rounding desert and over the palm shaded oasis in which lies the village of Biskra In the distance one can hear the softened cups of Arab children playing, the guttural call of a negro anxious to dispose of some mysterious and, the granting Of camels lying in the white dust, the tingling of a tiny bell displaying some hidden traveller's desire for his petit dejeuner in the slight but deliciously fresh breeze, tall red flowers, like the jinssion-ilower, ways the scarlet geraniums and their heads, the asphodel trembles And the shadow that lies beyond me on the garden walk shrinks gradually to my feet as the sun mounts higher the glorious sun that dominates, caresses, endows with its enchantment this perfect place of idleness Mlio could not rest, who could not dream hero P In Algiors one looks, alas! on savage passions In T unis one watches the picturesque tumult of the man ellous bazaars, and, at moments, can almost suppose that one is within hail of the intense bustle of Shepherd's In Biskra one dreams hind lets the happy) d was gedo by, too fast and yet too fast For perfect idleness quickens strangely the pulse of time, and di earning hastens the fly ing feet of the years I saw Biskra first under a full moon It looked a silver Village through whose streets stole silver ghosts. for the moon rays fell on lines of white houses, and on the Arabs in their snow white robes, with huge white hoods drawn forward above their dark faces By 6 o'clock the French soldiers the Zouaves, in their broad red trousers and round turbans , the magnificent Spahis, in their red, blue, and white Arab uniforms are safe in the barracks that stand on the frontier of the desert near the yellow Catholic church, and only a few Arabs glidosoftl) to and fro Unless, indeed, verge into one of the two little streets close to the Hotel Royal w hole dry and the painted dancers of the desert,

lamps Enormous negroes pass to fro Through doorways one patches here and there a glimpse of wonderful interiors On the left, near the top of the street, some White figures are solemnly leaping against a back ground that looks dark as ebony, while all the foreground is hazy with a sombre smoke, as if a hid veil of tissue werobeingdrnyvniipwaid by in- visible hands to hide the dancers On the right, in a cafe whose walls are hung with gay tufts, p line of strange figures is enthroned upon a tiered platform lit by parish lamps A very fat vomit 3 astern girl, covered from head to foot with

expressive face But, although each night there is dosing m Biskra, the note of the place is peace It is the safest, the most respectable Eastern village I have as 01 soon It is true that there are no temples and four tombs to see but the desert drives are delightful Go out, for instance, to the sulphur springs at Tontam Chance, which has at the foot of the brown velvety looking hills behind which the sun acts Tuite a cup of tea, with goat's milk, 111 the pleasant airy cafe of the bath house, and return towards evening You will see the strangest and most exquisite effects of atmosphere and colour as the sun goes down in front of you (stretches the illimitable Sahara, marked here and there with faint dark lines, which indicate the close growing palms of some cases Behind you the brown hills are turning to 11 dimmer hue, to a darkness that seems powdered with a dust of purple On the left, still strongly touched by the declin- ing sun, in a long line of mountains rosy as the mountains of Libya, and cleft here and there with flesh colour Before you ho the groves and the white houses and the flowing rills of Biskra The sky is scarlet and gold, and the air, which does not become cold at sundown, is marvellously dry and rosie. As you draw near to the station, which stands alone outside the village, you see the Arabs streaming up to meet the evening train Some Trench officers with loose red trousers and clanking swords, mingle in the crowd. Little French children, bred up among the Arabs, toddle on holding their nurses' hands The motor omnibuses roll heavily along the white road, circled by the clouds of dust But all this bustle is still in the distance Nearer, you see the empty plain Still yellow in the sunlight, and, soft in the yellow 98 in a frame two jet blaokfigurcs moving slowly and sadly They are mourners who have been out to pray in the desert cemetery where are buried so 1 v 1 reach The light leaves them while you "ie they are swallowed in the grey shadow a Von follow the sun It still bathes the exercising ground between the station and the village Two BpahiB are galloping there, mounted on magnificent white Arab horses Their robes float out in the evening air above their gay red Baddies They dart and lum, sway and sweep the birds Some playing negro boy shriek at them as they pass A Zouave strolls on with an Arab friend who is wrapped in a deep blue robe no is talking of St Louis and Senegal, of comrades who have fought in the desert campaigns, who have died and been buried in the devouring sands the setting sun beats upon his turbaned head, but r^heavonuesof BisKia are full of evening, and the Traces of the rats are ejjenkwg mysteriously to the shadows and as you pass to your hotel, the white figures stealing among the trees are like phantoms, and in the desert the tires in the camps of the Nomads are twinkling like fallen stars.
