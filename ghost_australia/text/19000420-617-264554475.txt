Mr. Furnival: Oh, hang the sweets! 1 beg your pardon, but conf you know what I mean, perfectly well. Don't say you don't, or you'll make me more miserable thau I am already. Madge dear, pitch into me. Say anything you like, only for goodness' sake, don't sit there so demure and pretty, and so—.unapproachable. Well there, I'm sorry. TJpon my soul I don't know what I've done, but whatever it is, I'm sorry. Mrs. Furnival: Poor boy 1 But why should you be sorry. I hope you are not going to be ill, for then I should be sorry.
