Reception to the Confraternities.-On Sunday afternoon the interesting ceremony of the reception of candidates to the Confraternities took place at St. Mary's pro-Cathedral. Prior to the reception, the old members of the Confraternities to the number of 73 marched in procession from the school across the grounds to the church, each wear- ing a distinctive badge-that of Holy Mary, blue ribbon ; Holy Angels, green ; St. Aloysius, blue ribbon and sash ; and of Holy Child, red ribbon. The Kev. Dean O'Sullivan preached an appropriate sermon on the occasion, and administered the bene- diction of the Ble√≠sed Sacrament, the children, without the assistance of the choir, beautifully rendering the hymn to the Holy Ghost at opening, and " The vow is made" after the reception. The reception to the Confraternities was as follows : 10 to the Children of Mary, 13 to the Children of the Holy Angels, 40 to the Children of the Holy Child, and six to the Children of St. Aloysius. There was a fair attendance of members of the congregation.
