A FREE MARKET. Tbe litoal meaning of the word " Fair," ia its commercial sense, is a "bee matat." In other 1 "iM^tnflftn^i »T]DrW^ why* «H may purchase or not without tea; subjected to fee or tax, and alsa where sll|aiid every enn sell without any such disabilities as attach to ordinary markets. At one time the fairs in England were great features in (he social and Industrial life of the people; but, since the establishment of railways, and the quicker interco jmunicataon whichgias reanltedjthpnfjfaira have retty well died ont, a^na-it^r perliaps, for regret, in some respects, but inevitable under th*> •* «nged cosdit—«i of the national life. Hen n Australia |£uis are unknown, -ndoed vetylittle of the old fasbianed methods obtain in these fast go-a-bead colonies. Ijife is not BO elow and lethargic as in Borope, and bunness is done with a movement and force to which, even in this day, few provincial folic in the old country are accustomed. This, knrerer is a necessity, following upon our freer and more prosperous condition, as well as the avakentd energies and intelligence of the last half century, life, too. though longer in its average than our worthy forefathers enjoyed, is suU too short for Blow or cumbrous metttods; and tbe art now is Bought in all directions to do as much in an hour as 100 years ago was accomplished in a week. This, however, is not a matter for marvel. H we tivtr at higher pressure, we obtain 1 higher rewards than the aHl . folk could possibly earn.

In a word, it isj impossible for a observer to look on at the ceaseless influx and out-flux of visitors to this dunr to be insensible to the circumstance that these fairs serve a higher puiposo than perhaps ever entered into the calcula tkais of the originators thcsnselves.
