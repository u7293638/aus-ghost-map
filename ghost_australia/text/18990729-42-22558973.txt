LIMESTONE CAVES IN QUEENSLAND. REMARKABLE DISCOVERIES NEAR CAMOOWEAL. That Queensland has more than an aver- age endowment of natural wonders is be- coming plainer as the country is more thor- oughly explored, and those who a few years ago were fond of asserting that there was nothing to attract the tourist to the colony have found it necessary to change their ideas considerably. The Barron Falls, the Chillagoe Caves, and Mount Morgan are but an infinitesimal portion of the curiosities of which we shall one day be able to boast. Every rear new wonders are added to the list, which has already reached quite re- spectable proportions. In the far North-west, where the popular idea pictures nothing but dreary monotony, there are some remarkable features worthy of the attention of scientists. It is known that in that part of Queensland artesian water is met with nearer the surface than in any other district—-indeed the water actually bubbles out of its own accord in the famous springs which were described in these col- umns a year or two ago. The existence of some strange cavernous formations in tbe neighbourhood of Camooweal, near the Northern Territory border, was discovered some time ago, and several attempts have bean made to follow these caves down to their lowermost depths. By the courtesy of Mr. J. B. Henderson, Engineer in Charge of the Water Supply Department, we have been placed in posession of documents in which an account is given of a successful ex- ploration of the caves down to the water level by Mr. D. W. Merison, post and tele- graph master at Camooweal, and Messrs. T. P. Keys and W. Bridison. the discoverers, and others. The caves are at Gum Holes, on Nowrani Creek, about thirteen miles south-south east of Camooweal, and on Rocklands run. The flrst attempt was made about August last year, and the journey was thus described by Mr. Morison:— "From the surface down a rugged hole, about 100 ft., we entered a large cave, the measurement of which was not taken, and on exploring it we found numerous corridors and passages leading into other caves of various sizes. The floors of all of them had a downward trend, and at last we found a hole in the floor of one of the caves, which, on a man being lowered down, proved to lead into a lower cave. We examined this, and found another hole leading down into a cave at a still greater depth. On exploring this we found still another shaft, and one of the party, who was lowered into it, found the water level; but we were unable, for want of time and means, to find the depth or direc- tion in which the water was running. It was good water to drink, and similar to that obtained by boring. The oaves are full of limestone stalactites and stalagmites of all sizes and shapes."  Later in the year a party was made up to further explore the caves and take measure- ments, and Mr. Morison wrote again as fol- lows:— To make a start from the beginning, I may state that it has been the desire of myself and others to prove it were possible to get down through any of the many holes and caves that exist about this district to the water level; and, further to see if they could be explored for geological purposes, it was my intention to send a full description to the Royal Geographical Society (Queens- land branch), of which I am a member. Other friends of mine had the same desire, and far more time at their disposal, and they have used their time to a successful issue, proving, first, that you can get down to water level; second, that geological explora- tion can be personally made to a depth per- pendicular of 260ft. from the surface, and, as some believe, to the bottom of the lime- stone formations. This was done by my friends, Tbomas Pelham Keys and William Bridison, and as they reported their success with very primitive means, we decided to make a party to drive out, and on the 17th of September Messrs. Thomas P. Keys, Wil- liam Bridison, the explorers, and A. H. Glissan, F. Mylne, George Huddy, and my- self left town at 3 p.m. in two large buggies, taking about 500ft. of rope, lamps, candles. and measuring tape. At 8 p.m. we arrived at the "canon" or creek; but about half-a mile east of a waterhole, called "Gum Hole," in Nowrani Creek. The canon or chasm In which the caves are is out on the point of spinlfex ridges, just near where they come on to the open downs. We camped for the night, and at daylight on the morning of the 18th began to make the exploration. On reaching the brink of the hole it was found to be very rocky; large flat boulders all round, of a burnt limestone, thrown about in all shapes until the perpendicular edge is reached. When you get here, and stand- ing at the extreme south edge of the hole, it assumes gigantic proportions. Looking due north about 400 ft. you will see on the surface a small hill, on each aide of which a small watercourse (dry) comes and stops abruptly as if the half of the hill had sud- ("Queenslander" Pboto. IN THE THICK OF IT. The Second Test Football Match. denly fallen straight down 103 ft. to the bot- tom of the canon on whose edge you stand. The dimensions of this canon are—north to south,, 400 ft.; east to west (at its widest part, when the watercourses enter it), from 250ft. to 300 ft.; but it comes back to almost a point at the south end, where there is a tree, to which we made the ropes fast, and which allowed us to descend perpendicularly 90ft. to the floor of the canon, whence we walked down to the entrance ot the uppermost cave. The bottom or floor of the hole or canon slopes downwards to the north, and is cover- ed with large rocks broken in all sizes and shapes. When you get to its north end you enter cave No. 1, near the hill referred to, by a large arch about 50ft. wide aud 40ft. high. It becomes quite dark here, and you have to light up, and proceed with extreme caution for about 350 ft. along a tunnel- shaped cave, which retains its height and its width, and has many smaller and beautiful caves branching off from it. It is in these caves—called by us by different names, such as the "organ loft," "music hall," "ghost chamber," the "grottoes"—that the stalac- tites are found. I will not attempt to de- scribe the beauty of these chambers and grottoes as seen by us with six different lights flitting about among their many lovely Gothic arches, the carvings made by the ac- tion of water on the limestones, other than to say they remind me of mosaic carvings and the pillars and domes of Pompeii or Rome. as shown in photos. After having spent an hour exploring these, we again, by means of ropes, of which each of us carried a supply, lowered our- selves down a hole having a diameter of 45ft. to 60ft., and a depth of 58ft. perpen- dicular, on to the floor of the second or mid- dle cave. We continued north along this cave for a distance of 280ft., its roof being, as well as we could see by the "fireball" lights we used, about 50ft. to 80ft. high, and its width about 40ft. to 50ft. Thus it would be 280ft. x 58ft. x 50ft. But we could find no smaller cares of any beauty on its level leading off from it; nor does any stal- actite exist in it; it is simply a passage by means of which you can get deeper down, and through which a torrent of water rushes during the wet seasons and the two creeks falling over the surface into the canon and along the top cave down through this cave to others still deeper. At its north end we found another hole of a diameter of 40ft., and a depth of 47ft. perpendicular, down which we again descended by the ropes to the bottom of a third or lower cave, which has a size of 200ft. x 40ft. x 47ft. We proceeded north along its floor exploring, but found no cavee of any beauty leading out on its level, but at the north end and north-west corner we found an opening cut out and somewhat resembling a shoot or waterway, and on going down this came on to the top of an enormous bell-shaped hole going down a further 28ft. On throwing down our "pilot" (as we termed our fireballs, made of sacking rolled in balls and steeped in kerosene) we found it struck water; we then lowered Mr. Kays and Mr. Glissan, and they stood on a ledge of rock trusting to the sling rope, and in the water. They found the water fresh and clear as crystal, and to taste much the same as surface water. At a depth of 3ft. under the water was a very soft mud, which would bear no weight, nor could we get any bottom to it. The shape of this hole, as I said before, is that of a bell, and the water level reaches just where the bell takes the outward tun at its bottom. Mr. Keys, standing on the ledge before mentioned, threw a lead-line in under the water all round the bell, and for a distance of 10ft. to 13ft., but found no wall, and it proved to us that we were at the level of the water—that is, the surface intake from the surrounding hills and downs—and that it was, in fact, the first water met in all Rocklands bores, of which there are now twelve, at from 250ft. to 280ft., all having struck this water lerel, but passed on to the running water found at from 290 ft. to 320ft., whloh I have proved to drillers who hare lately come here to be the true sub-artesian running water, and which cannot be reduced by a 4.5 pump running up to forty strokes a minute, 2ft. stroke. I will explain my reason for saying this water is running, and leave you to judge if I am right or wrong. I have taken a deep interest in all bores put down in these parts for the last nine years, and one experience has been that at from 250ft. to 280ft. fresh water has been struck, but on sending down the sand pump it always came back with the water discoloured, and mixed with the rock- drillings, and on being tested by a pump it was readily reduced, but on being allowed to "spell" for a few hours the water would again make to the same lerel. In another instance, on the bore being continued to a depth of 290ft. or 300ft., a second supply has been got, but its action was quite different, for it at once rose from 20ft. to 25ft. in the bore, and on putting the sand pump down the water came up as clear as crystal, and no vestage of roek-drilllng in the pump, not even when drilling was continued into a very hard rock below it. From a well or bore hole in that rock the drillings would present again in the sand pump, but fairly clear water, until a third supply was struck, when the same clear water and loss of rock-drill- ing occurred, and it was impossible with a 4.5 pump to make the slightest impression on either the second or third flow. My rea- sons for calling it running are :—First, clearance of the water pumped; second, loss of rock-drtlllngs; thlrd. inability to reduce flow; fourth, taste at once changes to highly mineralised waiter as against the first or sur- face water struck. I have now given an account of the ex- plorations as well as I can, and the reasons for our undertaking them. Of course none of us are practical men, but to a geologist this cave should offer a good field for re- search, and his report would be of. the deep- est interest to many whose whole existence depends on getting water at a reasonable depth. Here are my perpendicular measurements: —Surface to floor of hole or canon, 90ft.; fall of floor from south to north, 13ft; fall of floor of top cave to edge of hole, 10ft; depth of second hole to floor of cave 2. 58ft; depth to floor to north of cave N0.2, 5ft.; depth of third hole to floor of 2 cave, 47ft.; depth of floor to north of care No: 3, 4ft,; depth of the bell- hole well to water 23ft.; total. 330 ft. Length under ground :—From mouth of first cave to hole to 2 cave, 350 ft.; from south to north of 2 cave, 280 ft.; length from south to north of 3 cave, 200 ft.; total; 820ft. I may state that the air during all the time we were down, although warm, was quite pure, and we did not feel the slightest in- convenience from it. We took six hours exploring the caverns from end to end. It is our intention to explore another cave about twenty-five miles north-west from here as soon as we can arrange the necessary tools and requirements, it being a very much deeper hole from the surface to the apparent first floor, and more in the shape of a big well. Should we succeed, I shall be happy to send the best description I can of It.
