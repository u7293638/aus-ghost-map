THE NEW MORMONTSML. (UBDOK TZHE5.) Ths Monpons have come out with a newprofession of faith, the result of a conference of elders, which has lasted several weeks. This declaration says :— " We believe in God the Father, in Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; that men win be punished for their own sins, not for those of Adam, that mankind may be saved through Christ, and obedience to the laws and ordinances which appertain to the faith in Christ and through repentuice; in baptism by immersion, and laying on of hands. We believe in the same organisation as that of the Primitive Church —namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists. We believe in the gift of tongues, in prophecy, revelations, visions, and healing. We believe the Bible to be the Word of God, so far as it is translated correctly, and also that the Book of Mormon is the Word of God. We believe all God has revealed and is now revealing, pdwe believe that He will yet reveal many important things regarding the Kingdom of God. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel, in the restoration of the Ten Tribes, and that Zion will be built on this continent. We claim the privilege to worship God according to the dictates of our own eonscience, and allow others to do the same. We believe that we mast obey our rulers so long as they are honest, true, chaste, benevo lent, and virtuous." Article 12 of the declaration abandons the system of polygamy. The political effect of this departure will be very great in Idaho. There are 11,100 Mbrmons in this territory who will now be able to vote under this new declaration. , At s SEarmtm Conferenoe heU at M take CSfcy on 6th O O ^ IOM V ^ ^ attended. President Woodruff's official manifesto forbidding jJirwl marriages was approved and adopted by a unanimous vote of the apoetles, bishops, and elders. This is the most important step taken by the Mormon Church in a quarter of a century. George Q. Cannon, one of the oldest leaders of the church, addressed the conference, saying that the manifesto was the act of God. President Woodruff having had a special communication from the Almighty. The speaker said that he was sorry that the step was necessary, because be believed God had ordained polvsramv. The martvrs of the church had suffered much, 800 of them having been confined in the penitentiary for the alleged offence of polygamy; but it was useless for the church to fight 60.000,000 people any longer. God would hold the nation responsible for depriving citizens of their right to worship according to the dictates of their consciences. The sufferings of the Mormons were recorded in Heaven, and would one day appear upon the noblest page of modern history, but the speaker bowed, in submission to God's will. The conference confirmed the original dents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honouring, and sustaining the law." • The action taken by the conference effectually ends the Mormon trouble in Utah, and bars polygamy in tbe fu tire. The official manifesto of President Woodruff, forbidding plural marriages in the Mormon Church, is as follows:—" To whom it may concern:—Press despatches having been sent for political purposes from Salt Lake City, which have been widely published, to the effect that the Utah Commission, in a recent report to the Secretary of the Interior, allege that plural marriages are still solemnized; that forty or more marriages have been contracted in Utah since last June or dnring the pa?t year; also that in public discourses the leaders of the church have taught, encouraged, and urged the continuance of the practice of polygamy, I, therefore, as president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, do hereby in the most solemn manner declare theee charges false. " We are not teaching polygamy or plural marriages, nor are we permitting aay person to enter upon its practice. I deny that either forty, or any number. *f plural marriags during that period have been scrfemaieed in oar temples, or in any other place in the territory. One casn has been reported im which parties have alleged that a Buuriags was performed at the Endowment House ia Salt Lake City in the spring of 1389, but I have not been able to Learn who performed the ceremony. Whatever was dose was done without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence the Endowment House was by my instructions taken down without delay, inasmuch as laws had been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws, moreover, had been pronounced constitutianel by the court. " As a last resort, I hereby declare my intention to submit to the laws, and to nse my influence with members of the church over which I preside to have them do likewise. There is nothing in my teachings in the church, or in those of my associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably construed to inculcate or to encourage polygamy. When any elder of the church has used language which appeared to convey pcch teachings, he has been promptly reproved. I now oubiicly declare my advice to the Latter Day Saints, which is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land. " (Signal) Wilfobd Woodkuff. President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints." This document havins been adopted by the conference, the President offered the following resolution:— "That recognising Wilfrod WVdruff, President of the Church of Jesus Canst of Latter Day Saints, as the only man on earth at the present time who holds the keys for sealing ordinaries, we consider him fully authorised by virtue of hu position to issue the manifesto which has been read in. our hearing, and which is dated 2-xflt September. 1SSK': further, that, as the Church General Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning plural marriages as authoritative and binding." This resolution was unanimously adopted bv the vast assemblage. 'After Mr. Geonre Cannon bad spoken, President Woodruff {stated that the decision embodied in the manifesto had. been reached only after a long session of prayer. The fiat bad gone forth, and the will of God must i^a.' > " •. - Tbe question 'of "wimlshalL be "done case of members who are already sealed remains to be debated at a meeting of the Mormon priesthood.
