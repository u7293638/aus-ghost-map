To the Editor of the Herald. Sir-Your TV indEor correspondent in to-day's paper professes to furnish the report of a lecture on "The worth of fresh air," delivered at the School of Arts, in that town, by the Rev. G. A. C. Jones. In the report the rev lecturer is made to state " that air was only pure when it consisted of one part of ox gen and three of nitrogen "that nitrogen, high we breathe out, is a poisonous gas, area necessary for the growth of the vegetable kingdom" Ihm the air is found to dm cairn he retains it ascends, having produced alarming effects on those aeronauts who have made an ascent of five or six miles," or It can hardly be supposed that an educated man would profess to lecture on a subject of which the above quotations would furnish such glaring proofs of igor cell and I therefore acquit the rev, lecturer (of whom I know nothing even byname of ever having uttered such arrant nonsense but it is much to be regretted that your correspondent should have profited so little by what he may have heard, especially when he states that "the lecturer showed by some interesting chemical illustrations the wonderful effect nitrogen would have on the human frame were it not for the existence of oxygen" and " that one of these (the experiments), which seemed particularly to interest the audience, was that which exhibited spontaneous combustion, explained by the lecturer us the phenomenon which is sometimes observed as Eight in church-yard, and which superstitious people believe to be the ghosts or spirits of the departed, dust which is merely the emphasis of tar once acid gas, created by the decomposition of its ad ladies." 1 call attention to your correspondent's remarks as they may suggest to those gentlemen who are in the habit of addressing a miscellaneous audience on scientific subjects the propriety of themselves furnishing an analysis of their lectures, which would at least prevent their names being associated with such a tissue of unscientific misstatements as are exhibited in the extracts I have made from our correspondent's report, I am, Sir, yours respectfully, W. 11, 8.
