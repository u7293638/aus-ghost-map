More Wedding Bells. On Wednesday, Dec. 26th, a wedding was celebrated at the Temperance Hall, Mill- thorpe. In order to bring in the dollars the Army people had announced a wedding, but kept the names as far secret as possible. The secret was disclosed in return for a silver coin, when those present saw Tresurer Frank Ernest Hancock, of Nyngan, and Miss Mary Lowenson (late Salvation Army Captain) united in the bonds of matrimony according to the peculiar forms of the Army, and after a somewhat novel benediction had been pronounced on the newly-wedded couple—"In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, and the Salvation Army"—those present proceeded to take out another shillings worth at the banquet, which was graced by the presence of some of the local talent, who made things lively by putting soap in other people's tea, and other brilliant and original proceedings best known to local hoodlums. Staff- Captain Dennis conducted the marriage.
