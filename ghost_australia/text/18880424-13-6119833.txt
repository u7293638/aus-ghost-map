NOTES AND COMMENTS. AT. AN ARTIST'S SMOKE NIGHT. The Australian artist has only recently begun to assert himself, to come out of holes and comers and back places of the city, to take his high and proper place amongst the professions, and to beard the Philistine with a bold front A year or two ago the architect had no thought of him build studios I Who SO road as to dream of it It would be as ridiculous as building suites of apartments for new arrivals of a Rented sort Nobody had any faith in the artists for the reason, perhaps, that the artists did not make any bold and open display of confidence in them selves. Happily for art and for Melbourne the old order changes the artists band themselves together, and getting from under the wings of the half educated distance would be patrons of art, set up in their own houses, and speak to the world with their own works, and in their own was A little while ago it was a very difficult matter for an artist to find a house Pile on pile of brick and mortar was heaped up for the accommodation of any limb of the law who had been duly licensed by the courts to fleece mankind The doctors took and held their own end of Collins street, and the artist had to he content with any hole or any corner where he could set up his easel and six his modest plate to a back door The beginning of the end of his troubles in that way has approached by the opening of Grosvenor chambers, wherein he really is to be first considered Grosvenor chambers were opened on Friday night The enterprising proprietor, Mr C S Patterson, wished to make some little announcement of what he had done, and with the artists who have become tenants of his studios, issued inn stations for a "smoke night." The term, which is creeping into everyday use, is not very good. is not every night a smoke night in most men's lives ' A\ by not a music night, a drink night, a picture night' None of these would be more absurd than another There is, indeed, only one word in the land range which adequately describes an affair of the sort, and to that there would doubtless be objections The artists invited their friends to a "spree ' It began about 8 o'clock. A hundred people had gathered by that time, and were running over the building, somewhat amazed, a few of them, to find an artist nearly as comfortably disposed as a bank manager, with Miss Ina wants anticipated and supplied An ante room nicely furnished for arriving visitors , a studio within almost as rich in decoration and upholstery as a dentist's; or photographers room The high south windows, which all day long flood the easel and the sitter's throne with light, darkened now, and only the gaslight showing the pictures on the walls There was no great display of work, or desire on the part of the artists established here to anticipate their fellows at the exhibition shortly to be held It was only a look around the studios, and then a gathering in the big room below. The big room is the smoke place and the music place, and the drink place, and the "spree place There Signor Hazon then ders melodiously on the piano, and Mr Gladstone Wright strolls out his good songs in a style which fetches the audience (who are a grade above the average, perhaps in unmistakable fashion It is strange how very rarely a good singer will sing a good song lime tenths of the men and women to whom nature gave good vocal powers waste them over elaborate bush, or on ineffective flights towards inaccessible heights, or in those aim pering silly songs of the time which are born pering silly songs of the time which are born out of a " society sentiment," but are neither English, Scotch, nor Irish, nor expressive of any thing but affectation, weakness, and de- generally The Bones go on, the story telling keeps pace, the glasses go round, and the ascending smoke thickens. There is but one desire in the minds of the hosts. They wish "The (cast to be more joyous, And the guests be more contented " 'I lie feast is joyous and the guests are well content, and when 10 o'clock is over and II past, and 12 approaching, 'the merry enough Yes, * Vlcrrj in the hall, VV hon the boards was all," when every man can sing and dance, too, at need, when the Volkslieder come to mind, and the walls echo, and the roof rattles, and the poor Salvation Army man, walking home after a stiff battle in the slums, listens awhile for new ideas of drill and battle, and crosses himself, and gets along, praying for the salvation of those who are nearer heaven, perhaps, than they will ever be again Why should not the lawyer, and the doctor, and the merchant, and the poor scribe (who will have "an awful' head the morn")dance a foursome reel with all the vigour of Maggie Lauder, or that other Maggie who tripped it to such a time in Kirk Alloway on an eventful night' The spree, moderately controlled and brought to a timely end is a great anti- done better than podophyllin for the liver of nitroglycerine for the heart. No man who can dance in a foursome reel at raid night will ever die of dyspepsia, but then it may be that no man fairly cantankerous with dyspepsia can imbibe enough whisky to raise the steam necessary for a proper performance of the dance. It is time, however, to let the curtain fall. The best Boree the world ever saw yields but a poor ghost. It is pleasant medicine to be taken and forgotten, and will never, perhaps, receive the cordial approval of a majority of women '1 he artists should study the women of the land a little, and now that they are properly housed hold an occasional after noon reception whereat society might present itself and learn how dignified and courtly and graceful and gracious art is and should be in all its essentials and adjuncts. The natural and proper order is for society to court art and the artist, not to patronise It is time the very name of patron was struck out of the records of every artistic society Melbourne requires to be taught the art is a courtly and delicate, no less than a beautiful thing, and will not be slow to learn when once the artist begins to teach. learn when once the artist begins to tenor. And through the processes of teaching and learning much good will he wrought. A wielder fortnightly or monthly afternoon ftttheatudioa would he a pleasant departure from the beaten tracks of city and society line It would encourage a little intellectual and artistic convocation, thought, habit , would slowly increase the numbers of the minority who can really appreciate beautiful work, and distinguish between the good and the indifferent in art, The private great advantage will be found in all this and also the great, and true', and persistent gain of the public.
