A Baseless Charge. John Bethune, a very respectable-looking man, described as a laborer, was charged before Mr. Addison, S.M., at the Central P. Court yesterday, with having attempted to steal Is Id from John Kelly. Prosecutor stated that he lived any where, sometimes sleeping at the Salvation Army Barracks, , and other different places. He went to sleep under a tree in the park with hia coat over nig head, and woke up and found accused with his hand in his pocket. He followed accused, and held him till a constable came up, and gave him into custody. In reply to his Worship prosecutor stated that'he was not sober, and had had three or four drinks, and might have had six. ' Yes,' remarked his Worship, 'you're one of those poor men who have no money and have to sleep in the park. Poor fellow, I'm afraid there's a great many like you.' Accused said that the whole thing was a wicked falsehood. He owned 250 acres of land in Victoria, and was going away to Grenfell that day, and had a slip in his pocket for money he had transmitted to that place. His Worship remarked that possibly some one put their hand into prosecutor's pocket but prose cutor was under the influence of drink and did not know who it was. TTia Worship discharged accused and remarked ' I believe you are an innocent man, and have been brought here on a false charge altogether.'
