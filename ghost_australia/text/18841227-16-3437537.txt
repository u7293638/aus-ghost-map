DIARY OF A TRIP IN A LABOUR VESSEL. BY TRAVELLER. September 25, 1884 - This being the day appointed for our sailing, shortly after lunch I repaired on board the Roderick Dhu, in company with Mr. R. A. McMurdo, Govern- ment agent, and there found that owing to some delay on the part of the Government officials, we should not be able to get away till late in the evening, so Captain Thomas and I made up our minds to go on ashore again to bid a fond farewell to our friends. We found, however, that it was much easier to go ashore than it was to get afloat again - there were so many "good-byes" to say, and so many "safe journeys"and "quick returns" to drink, and it was not until we were whistled for twice that we finally tore ourselves away from that very hospitable and jolly host. Niel Blue, of the Melbourne Hotel, where the majority of us had been staying, awaiting the pleasure of the immigration agent, who only wanted to be shown everything about half-a-dozen times before he condescended to pass the ship, and then, at the last moment, the "boys"had to be mustered again, because he was not quite sure whether a certain "return labourer" named " Thlanvirpoolchgwingergoboo " spelled his name with one "o" or with two. At 6 p.m. we finally got away, being towed down the river by the paddle steamer Cerodatus, and were still undergoing that interesting operation when we turned in for the night. September 2(1.-A ¡.trongN.W. wind greeted us on our appearance on deck this morning, and ¡it S.15 a.m. wo cast anchor at Horseshoe Bond. Mr. Evans, the pilot, being nuable to pass tho di'odgo stationed there, although he miulo three laudable attempts to do so, the Corodatus cast olf to prevent nibbing. Tito monotony of tho day was broken by the Government agent mustering the return labourers. At S p.m. it was blowing a gale, and we had still to lie at anchor, metaphori- cally speaking at the morey of the waves-the waves ibeins soniowlnt exaggerated Mary Uiver ripples. I think that a few words here, describing the vessel I am sailing in, will not be out of place. She is a fine roomy brigantine, of 163 tons register, built in Auckland, New Zealand. She has first-rate accommodation aft for the officers and Government agent, with an extra portable bunk, which comes in very handy for me. She has a clean-swept hold, on either side of which one tier of bunks is arranged. This place is intended to carry 109 islanders, and, in the present instance, there are seventy-eight return labourers occupying it, irrespective of nine women and two children, also return labourers, who have a special place allotted to them. The crew consists of six Europeans, exclusive of officers, and fifteen natives, which form what is called the "boat's crew". She has large yam boilers on deck, sufficient to cook for 131 islanders, her original complement under the old Act of 1880, and now reduced, under the new Act of April, 1884, to 109. The boys appear to be perfectly happy and contented with the arrangements made for their comfort, and fully appreciate the kindness of the Go- vernment agent, who does not restrict them to the Government allowance of rations, but allows them to have as much as they can com- fortably, or otherwise, stow away - the ample storerooms of the Roderick Dhu being well supplied for both the Europeans and natives. She is a smart sailer, and proved herself such by more than holding her own against the noted "flyer", the Young Dick, whilst beating against her from the White Cliffs to the Fair- way Buoy. In conclusion, I must say that great credit is due to the agents, Messrs. Rankin, O'Kane, and Co., for the business-like way in which they have turned her out. She is fitted with mostly all new gear, besides two new boats, and her commissanat would do credit to the catering of Gunter himself. She is also supplied with a well assorted medicine chest, from which our Government agent ad- ministers to the wants and requirements of the sick return labourers daily, there being no less than five, all of whom are in a very dangerous and critical state. It seems a very great shame that such cases should be sent on board, more especially as the Government agent, whose duty it is to attend to the sick, is not furnished with any paitieulais as to their several maladies, nor with instructions as to their future treatment. September 27 -'N e got und« w ay at day bleak, the Cerodatus doing the honouis with tho tow line at 7 a m We biou^ht up at the Fairway Buoy, and at half jast S we paitcd company w ith our auxiliary, w ho c idently w as quite satisfied with the way in whirh she had acquitted hersei, for she s ilutcd us with a volume of smoke and blew h« self out to an cvtraoidinary extent, and \amly tucd to whistle "Goodbye, Sweetheait, Goodbye" At noon we again got underway, this time | on our own monts, independent of tugs oi anything else, steering for Sandy Cape to a light west south west bieczc and line cleai weathci. September 2S -During the night the wind \ceied lound, and this morning theio was a light south south irest breche blowing We rounded Sandy Cape Spit at 4 a m , at least so lam infoimecl, I at that interesting juncttue being safe in the aims of what I once heaida man call "Murphy" Dunng the day the wind dropped, and when wo turned in foi the night it was almost a calm Septembei 29 andáO-Ihe wind during the whole of these two days was \eiy light, and foi se\«al houis wc weie becalmed Nothing of any note occun ed, and I feel sure that my putting in tho different positions of the wind will not in any way add to the interest of my diary, EO I shall refrain fiom so doing October 1 -At noon we sighted Clarence Peak, and in the afternoon the Noith and South Sfthtaues carno into MOW One of the sick "leturn laboui eis" that I i of« red to above died this evening, and we consigned the poor fellow to his watery gia\e at sundown I cannot refrain from heie making a few re mailes with respect to the gioss inhumanity shown by the authouties in sanctioning the removal of "boys' when in sueh a stale as I have already mentioned from the hospital, and by putting them on board in an almost hope less condition To saj the least of it, it docs seem a most uncharitable and cruel piocecdin¿ on the part of sonioouo 01 other-with every facility and convenience at hand on shore for their treatment, that these poor unfortunates should bo literally caited on board (I use the wold advisedly, as one of thom was so ill that ho had to bo sent down to the wharf in a diay), whore, as j ou may well imagine, the facilities for ti eating the sick must ncccssauly bo much moro limited and rcstucted than on shore, and to make matters still w orso, tho Gov crament agent, as I said bcfoio, is not infoimcd as to the nature of their soi oral diseuses, noi docs ho receive any insti notions whatsoever as to the medicines toadministei to them I consider that great pi aise is due to Mi M'Murdo foi tho great troublo ho takes and tho way in which he lays lumsolf out to alleviate then suif ci nigs Ho allows thom sago, ai low root, and other nutritious food, and docs his utmost to make thom as comfoi table as ho can- not spaung blankets 01 anything elso that is likely to add to their comfoi 101 to make then unhappy lot ca3iei tobcai llio other four boys aro still in a veiy critical stivto,
