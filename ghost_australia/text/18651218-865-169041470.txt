T W O A M E R IC A N COM ED IA N S. W ith in th e la st few w eeks we have been been favored w ith visits from tw o A m erican actors o f w h a t is called " c h a ra c te r.” B oth o f them h ave earned a h ig h reputation in those citieB o f th e U nited S tates w hich can alone confer th e a tric a l honors on th e oth er side o f th e A tla n tic . A t home, we understan d . th e y distinguished them selves in w h at is com m only term ed " le g itim a te ” business; th a t is to say , th e y acted in the old stockoomedies, w ith o u t relying on pieces w ritten fo r th e sole purpose of suiting their ow n peculiarities. H ere, how ever th e y have represented c ertain exceptional types of h u m anity supposed to be am ong the offshoots o f A m erican soil. M r J o h n E. Owens, who h as lately le ft us, represented an exceedingly stolid aad u n cu ltiv ated farm e r, the in h ab itan t o f some E a ste e rn S tate. M r Jefferson, who has very recently m ade bis appearance am ong us, p o rtra y s th e D u tch settler of tb e early period of N ew Y ork civilization, as exhibited by W ashington Irv in g in his story of Rip van W inkle. T h e th e a tre fo r both has been th e A d elp h i. D istin ct a s these tw o acto rs are from eaeh o ther in look, m anner and style, as well as in tlie description o f c h a ra c te r selected fo r representatio n , th ey both apparently proceed on the com m on p rinciple of taking in band, perhaps in v e n tin g , a m arked idiosyncrasy, and w ork in g o u t his d etails to the highest possible degree o f finish. For thi9 reason they m ay be classed w ith M r Sothern, since w ith him also m inuteness of detail is th e grand consideration. Broad sketches do not, a9 i t seem s, belong to th e notions of h istrionic a r t entertained l>v these three pro ­ ficients. A s th e old D u tch painter is aiid to have boasted of th e num ber of to ad ies w hich lie boasted on th e elaboration of shirtcollar, so m ay th ese new actors trained on the oth er side of th e A tla n tic , g lory in the quantity of ira in u te actio n w hich th e y em ploy in order to io d iz e th e ir conception of a character w hich they have th o u g h t w orthy of study. How th e old conventional fop of tw o ccn*i furies’ sta n d in g w as sublim ated into the unique Lord D u n d reary by M r Sothern, has now been know n to e v ery playgoer fo r th e last tw o years; and B ro ’hcr Sum .w ho a t present reigns in D u n d re a ry 's place — for he is expected hack in L ondon a fte r Christm aB—is Another illustration of the successful application of th e sam e m ethod o f proceeding. In addressing him self to the L ondon public, Mr Sothern was rem ark ably fo rtu n a te io the character w hich had m ade his fo rtu n e in the O nitcd S tates, and w hich p erh ap s owed p art of its A m erican p o p ularity to a desire of the Y ankees to laugh nt a B ritisher, who was a lord into th e barg ain . W hile th e details of D undreary w erecD tircly fresh, the basis from which they sprang wns p erfectly fa m ilia r to th e Hay* m ark et audience, w ho could th erefore u n d e rs'a n d . th e m oral and in tellectual sta tu s which h e was intended to represent. F ro m th e days of O harlts 1 1 , we have h ad o u r Foppingtons and F latters, who stood n p a rt from (he D orim ants and tho M irabels—lib ertin es of a m ore robust so rt— as cu ltiv ato rs of an effem inate dialect and an extrem e indolence of m anner. T hese fops were som etim es supposed to ape the fashions o f F rance and Ita ly , as. even nt tlie present day, fops on tlie G erm an stage are very fond of th e v erb s in “ iro n ;” h u t they were n o t half so foreign ns (hey looked. T he m ilitary swell, who is allied to ilie old fop by an out* vrsrd sem blance of cfficm inncy and indolence, b u t differs from him in the firm retention of his soldicr-likc courage,w ould seem to be of a later grow ih. H e was m ade perhaps more prom inent th an he had been before, about forty y e a rs since, w hen tho Hii'B&rs; of tho 10th regim ent rendered them selves unpopular by cciuaiu stran g e affectations, and w ere satirized n o t ouly by th e caricaturists of th e day, b u t by th e R ev G eorge Croly in bis com edy, “ P rid o shall h ave a F a ll.” Since (h at tim e lie has n ot bc&n; allowed w holly to disappear, an d he still lives in M r L eech's draw ings of fashionable guardsm en. D u n - dreary grasped w ithin him self the peculian* ties of m any varieties of tb e genus fop, ( and oAch of th ese could be p erfectly appreciated b y every L ondon playgoer, though tho co m ­ pound re su lt w as entirely novel.
