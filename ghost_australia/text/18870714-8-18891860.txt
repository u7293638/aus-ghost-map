Could he find bim ho would prora It l'rove G on'a Image waa no other Than the grinning monkey's kinsman Just a more developed brother. But to prool he showed a blindness. Followed a theoretic ghost; England'! own immortal poet Wrote the proof his labors lost. , For my views upon the subject What they possibly may weigh- , I refer you unto '* Hamlet," To the fifth aot ot the play.
