Lilith. BY HENRY KENDALL. Strange is the song ; and the soul that is singing Falters because of the vision it sees ! Voice that is not of the living is ringing Down in the depths where the darkness is clinging, Even when Noon is the lord of the leas. Fast like a curse to the ghosts of the trees ! Half with the darkness, and hall with the day, Face of a woman, but face of a wonder, Vivid and wild as a flame of the thunder, Flashing on me like the wonderful, white bear at the meeting of morning and night ! "Look to thy Saviour and down on thy knee, man, Lean on the Lord as the Zebedee leaned! Turn to the Christ to be succored and screened— Saved from the eyes of a marvellous fiend ! " Serpent die is in the shape at a woman — Brighter than woman, ineffably fair ! Shelter thyself from the splendour and sue, man. Light that was never a loveliness human Lives in the face of this sinister snare, Longing to strangle thy soul with her hair ! Lilith who came to the father and bound him fast with her eyes in the first of the Springs— Lilith she is ; but remember she drowned him Shedding her flood of gold tresses around him— Lulled him to sleep with the lyric she sings : Melody strange with unspeakable things I "Low is her voice; but beware of it ever- Swift bitter death is the fruit of delay ! Never was song of its beauty — ah, never— Beard on the mountain, or meadow, or river, Not of the eight is it, not of the day- Fly from it, stranger, away and away !" Back on the hills is the blossom and feather, Glory of noon is on valley and spire ! Here is the grace of magnificent weather- Where is the Woman from gulfs of the nether- Whore is the Fiend with theface of desire ! Gone, with a cry, in miraculous fire ! Sound that was not of this world, or the spacious Splendid blue heaven, has passed from the lea. Dead is the voice of the devil audacious : Only a dream is her music fallacious, Here in the song and the shadow of tree, Down by the green and the gold of the sea.
