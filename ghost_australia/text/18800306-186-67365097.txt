The lady Paesideot replied that Mrs. Phelan was in the Hospital, and her children in the . Asylum. Mr. biggins further stated that he bebeved tilis person had received a quantity of rations, and that £4 had been sent from her husband to her. The Lady President said that Dr. Gregory bad stated that the woman could not live. She had bean informed that at one time the children had nothing bnt bread and water to subsist on, and that Mrs. Phelan was not able to work. Mr. Kdman had sent a report concerning lbs. Pbelan, which was of an indifferent character; and had had forwarded a cheque for £6 towards the support of her children. Mr. Fergoson called attention to the fact that Mrs. ^K^ had been receiving relief for the pssnK^ months ; and that this was not a case calbnf^ for relief, especial]? u there at i many widow* who needed assistance. Mr. Diggens said that fiiis woman's bustard was at Aramar. The Committee decided to give relief for a few weeks longer. In the case of Mrs. Harty, Mrs. Ferguson thought that as she had a husband, and had been on the books for six months, that her naioe Bhonld now be taken off. Mr. Harvey thought Mrs. Harty should endeavour to ascertain where her husband was, and obtain his -— =-t-T otherwise relief should be stopped.

Again, thanks.' ]*- A FKESH addition to the steamers trading to this port arrived on 37th nit. intheehapeof the screw steamship Pretty Jane, commanded by Captain Tison, long and favourably known as chief officer of the Wentworth and Victoria running in the weekly coast mail service. The Pretty Jane was purchased in Auckland by the A. S. N. Company about four months ago, and placed in the insular trade between Levnka, Tonga, and other islands of the Fiji group. She spas, bowerer, found too cmsS for the trade, and it was decided to ran her between Rockhampton, Broadsound, and alackay, where there is every prospect of her running at a profit to tiie Company. The Jane made a good voyage of nine days from Levnka to Brisbane, and then had an overturn!. Sbe left Brisbane on Tuesdav and experienced dirty weather to Doable Island Point ; thence to arrival fine weather with a strong south-east breeze. The steamer is fitted with a twin screw, the engines being forty hone power, contains accommodation for forty ninw ilgMM, has a neatly furnished saloon amidships, and is 135 tons registered. She took the flour ship Claymore in tow. and had to leave her at anchor below the Elbow as the fresh was too strong. The Pretty Jane is likely to prove a convenience to travellers between this port, Broadsonnd, and Mackay. The announcement in the papers of Dr. Paterson's marriage in Brisbane, to a young Udy recently from Scotland, appears to have been received by the inmates of the Hospital (of which be is Resident Surgeon) as an event of no common order, and the Doctor's return on Saturday last, accompanied by his wile, was made die occasion for great rejoicings. Daring some days previously, busy hands had been at work draping and decorating tiie approaches to tiie Hospital with flags, ever greens, and mottoes ; and the gay appearance of the building with its surroundings made it a .conspicuous object of attention. Over the main gateway were the significant words ' God bless the happy pair;'' and the meaning of the extensive preparatms in progress was still more plainly disclosed, by an archway over tiie Doctor's private residence with 'Welcome borne' artistically worked upon it in large letters. The decorations were arranged with good taste, aad their general effect was very pleasing. On Saturday afternoon Dr. and r Mrs. Patenon arrived by the a. Lady Bowen, and drove up to tiie Hospital. On reaching the entrance to the Grounds there was a general turn oat of officials, servants, and con valescent patients, all anzuns to show the esteem they entertained for Dr. Patwatm and to rive the newly-wedded couple a right royal welcome. There were losty cheers and excited movements. Fortunately the horses were quiet, and they were quickly released from further duty. Toe carriage was tiieu drawn by hand through the grounds to the private entrance to the building. Here the occupants alighted aad Or. Patersou, in a few well chosen words, thanked bis many friends for their warm «- ?atsaiuu of kindly feeling towards lbs. Paterson and himself, which to them was the more agreeable because it was altogether un expected. The remainder of tin day aeems to have bees spent in festivities, aad in tte even ing rocket* were let off and the Easpital Grounds were brilliantly muminated by torches. It is evident that Dr. Paterson, daring In. brief connection with the hospital, has Bade Uandi a general favourite, ?ndtmn the hearts of all the inmates. In dosing this Botift we wysMttinn tta* a poem of coo ?Wk lesgtii and eaaadmgly well written, expressive of welcome to Bocttaamtrm to Dr. Etterson and Us bride, was lent to as for pub ucatkm. bat declined, solely because in refer ernes to private lifemirirt bane been deemed out of place in a general newspaper. Cental BaBway line was concluded on Monday morning, when the evidence af Petter Geddes (bridge inspector) and Loms Gibson (railway guard) was taken. Their testimony merely corroborated the chief particulars elicited The overdue mans from Aramae, Sprmo enre, and St. Lawrence came to hand at the post office on Tuesday. Tee St. Lawrence mailman report* the Fifczroy River very high stYaambs,aadstnirismg. The man, bad t» be panted across Alligator Creek bridge, aad as tiie mad horses were swimmmg over, one of them was nearly swept away by the current, aad with dtmcatt/wasaaved. We are informed by Mr. da Costa, post master, that he has been instmcted by tele gram from the Under Secretary of tiie 'Postal Department, Brisbane, that in consequence of a cable mrisgc received from London on Saturday last, the ftcrfte and newspaper notices respecting tbe increased rates of postage on letters and newspapers for the United Kingdom have been cancelled, and the old rates of sixpence on letters and one penny on newspapers have been reverted to. This information was anticipated by our press messages from London, bat tbe notice now grnai Is official and takes effect immediately. A sncui. general meeting of the members of No. 6 Building Society, was held at the offices of *6e Secretary -Mr. S. L. Dibdia) on Monday afternoon at four o'clock. Cor tiie purpose of electing a Treasurer, according to instructions received from the Attoraey-Generai, who has deemed it newmary that such an appointment, in connection with Building Societies shall be made. Upon the motion of Mr. G. Bletcher, Mr. T. S. Han, manager of the Queensland National Bank, Eorthampton, was appointed Treasurer to the Society. This being the only business for which tiie meeting was con vened, the inembers separated. Tbe Berry Miaistey lias been defeated. The appeal to the country on the Beform ery has resulted in an emphatic vote of want of confidence in tbe would-he reformers. Our Melbourne telegram states that tbe Hon. Graham Berry obtiinert only a small majority, and Sir Bryan OToghleu has been defeated. The Ministry itself has therefore been handled roughly by the country, and afmwterial sup porters hare fared even worse, thirty-nine only having been returned, while the Opposi tion have secured forty-seven seats oat of a total number for the Assembly of dghtv aix. This gives the Opposition a dear majority of eight members, and it may be expected that tie disclosure of this result wOl cause defections from the Ministerial ranks and give tiie Opposition a strong working majority. This revnhnon of public opinion ill Victoria is fraught with momentous come qnences. It may be hoped Oat mob-rule baa received a wholesome cheek, and that a change of the right sort in the fiscal policy of -£e colony will soon be made. Tbe Govenmat, GasMe of 25th February contains a short statute passed by tbe Imperial Parliament, entitled tbe Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act. The Act deakwith offences ' committed on the open sea within » certain distance of the coasts of the United Kingdom, and of all other parts of her Majesty's dominions, by whomsoever com mitted.' The fin* section enacts that an offence committed by a person, whether a subject of Her Majesty or not, on the open sea within tiie territorial waters of her Majesty's dominions, is an offence vitbin the jurisdiction of the Admiral, although it may have been committed on board or by means of a foreign ship, and the person who committed such offence may be tned, arrested and punished accordingly. No proceeding for such anofienee against a person who is not a Britishmbjectisto be so instituted in tile United Kingdom without tin consent of one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, or in any colony without the consent of tile Governor of tbe same, tfathing in tbe Act shall be construed to be in derogation of any rigntful jurisdiction of Her Majesty, under the law of nations. On Wednesday, the 35th ultimo, a deputa tion from tiie Council of the National Asso ciation waited on tiie Government for the purpose of arginjE upon them the necessity of immediate steps being taken to have Queens land properly utpii'w.'iited at the forthcoming Melbourne Exhibition. The deputation was received by tbe Attorney-General in the absence, from Brisbane, of tiie Colonial Secre tary. Mr. Griffith introduced the deputation, and urged the necessity of this colony being well represented at the Melbourne Exhibi tion, considermg the snecess that has at tended onr efforts at the Sydney Exhi bition. If we are not represented, Mr. Griffith urged, tint oar Victorian neigh bours would look upon it as an unfriendly act, do time should be lost in this matter. The National Association would do as they had done with respect to the Sydney Exhi bition. Mr. Scott remarked that it was generally supposed that one of the Princes of the Royal Family would pay Melbourne a visit during tile Exhibition. It would be a pity S tius colony, with its royal name should not be represented. The Attorney-General informed tiie deputation that the question had xenpied the attention of the Government. An application had been made for 8800 feet of space for this colour, and a reply had been reeetVed in aeknowleagmest, hot not atxtmg what space would be reserved. Tbe matfaer would be brought before the GovernoKot, but no reply would be given until the return of the Caloaial Secretary. The Attorney Generalsaid that he might place this matter before tbe Cabinet but did not think anything waa likely to be decided satil Mr. Palmers EBiitma 'WITtr wlMnawrtl The Visiting Justice. Mr. T.

A SGICTBE dispbtving anasnal detenninstion waa committed on Monday afternoon by a man named Vs. White. It appears White, who was a sauor, lately arrived in town from the coturbry, and since then has been drinking heavily. Yesterday afternoon, when some distance past tbe Deep Water Wharf, on the river bank, he cut his throat with a knife, mfiietiuga wound about 6ve inches long aad slightly cottisr tiie wind-pipe. Wbitethrew the knife into the river, into which be jumped, apparently with the intention of drownmc himself. A Bailor from the barons Bertie7 who was in charge of the ship's boat at the wharf, seeing tbe man in the water, west to the rescue, and attaching a cope to White's body, and with other --? '?*?- — . succeeded in dnaggmgbini ashore. The pahce were sent for, and on the arrival of Constable WflTliams he found White lying face downwards on the grass and bleeding profusely tram the wound m his throat Be tamed him on his back, to arrest the bleeding, aad mbaeewntly con veyed him in a vehicle to the Police Station. On arrival there Dr. Robertson stitched op the wound and bandaged it after which White was haadcofted and conveyed in chaos of two constables to the Hospital. Ob reaching tiie Instsotian. Dr. Patersan was found to be ihoent but shottiy returned. The man immediately afterwards expired from internal hemorrhage.

A HOT about eight years of age, son of Mr. John Holmau, had a narrow escape for his life on tbe 27th ultimo, about eleven o'clock. He was standing at the edge of the southern bank of tbe river near tbe Gas Works watching the progress of tne FHzroy as she steamed up tbe river, when tbe bank, which had become undermined by tiie action of the fiaod, shpped down and precipitated him into the river. Tbe chad ssnk twice but nltimatelj struck out boldly, paddling like a dog, aad by this means kept himself afloat. A boat manned by two men put off from the r^tzroy, bat in the excitement of the moment one of tiiem ' ought a crab ' and lost his paddle. In response to shoots from the steamer to swim towards the child. »rho was by this time being carried down the river, one of tile men, Mr. Thomas Roberts, jumped into the water. Being a good swimmer he soon reached the boy, and held him up until they were both rescued by the boat. Tbe little fellow was afterwards landed apparently Uttie tiie worse for his immersion, bis mother arriving at the spot just at the time. His presence of mind in striking out un doubtedly saved his life. Tbis case should be a warning to other children not to approach the edge of tbe river bank while the flood is Me.

On this evening it was seen from many -iffiW^T*t- pTar^H in t^F^ and iflip. neighbouring colonies. On tie Srd the clouds broke in Sydney, and the comet's tail was seen between the clouds, extrading upwards from S. W. horizon, past Beta Grins, but nearer to L.

Above that it faded rapidly, tie northern side being tie best marked; near tie bank of clouds on tie horizon it became very narrow, as if near tie head ; but no lindens could be «*»« On the 5th a similar view was obtained, and it appeared that tie upper part of tie tail was moving northwards much Caster tJian that near tie horizon ; and the tr*-*!. though fainter, ex tends farther from the horizon, as if the nndeus were rising ; but it could not be seen here.
