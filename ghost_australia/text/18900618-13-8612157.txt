WEDNESDAY, JUNE 18, 1890 The Government Railway Bill was introduced into Parliament yesterday, and is now before the interested dis tricts for their consideration. The localities that are served will of course be hugely satisfied with the measure as it is and those that are not served will be, and indeed through their representatives they already are, loud in their expressions of discontent, and of course it is impossible at the first blush to say whether praise or blame should rightly predominate with regard to the division of the mileage. Taking the measure as a whole, it is not one that need necessarily alarm those amongst us who are afraid of the colony being plunged into an undue loan expenditure though here again explanation is necessary before a final opinion can be formed. Forty three country lines are proposed, and ten suburban lines. The country dis tricts obtain 787 miles and the metro politan suburbs 30 miles. The country lines will cost £5, 458,000, and the suburban lines £l,683,000, so that as the lion's share of the ex- penditure goes in the one direction - the right direction no doubt - there is scant occasion for raising the cry of town v. country, which it would seem we are to have. The number of lines in comparison with the mileage is very large, so that it is evident that no trunk railways are proposed, but that the bill is one of extensions, branches, and connections and this is actually the case. The expendituie of £7,000 000 just stated is exclusive of permanent way material, which will not cost less than £1,000 000, and may cost more accord ing as the iron market firms or relaxes, and, more important still, the expendi- ture is exclusive of rolling stock. The reason given by Mr GILLIES for not taking rolling stock into consideration is certainly a curious one. The engineers in 1884 estimated that £173,000 would be required for rolling stock for the lines then proposed, whereas altogether a sum of £2,000,000 has been expended on that item. The existing store of engines, carriages, and trucks will certainly not supply the proposed additional mileage, and an other million of money must be added on this account to the total, making £9,000 000 in all. Then all the while these new railways are being built the old lines will be demanding new sidings, new station sheds, new interlocking apparatus, new bridges, new subways, and so on. The more new traffic is brought on to the older lines, the more imperative will be the demand for outlay of this character. We know about the heavv expenditure of the past few years under this head, and neither Mr GILLIES nor Mr SPEIGHT would venture to say that the outlay is likely to cease in the future. It cannot so cease. The skeleton lines which we construct in the first instance must be more and more clothed or equipped as trade develops, and consequently there is not the slightest reason to suppose that we shall depart in future from the rule that has obtained of late years, that for each mile of railway we build we add £14,000 to the capital account. The total for 817 miles according to this rule, would be £11,400,000. There is not the slightest probability of this out lay being reduced, and indeed as Mr GILLIES admits that the cost of construc tion is sure to be much larger than it was because of heavy engineering works and the higher price of land and the pro bable advance in rails, the round figures of £12 000 000 may safely be adopted as the expenditure under the new scheme. In 1884 the loan asked for was £6,000 000, and £13,600,000 has been required, and now that £8, 000, 000 is asked for at least £12,000,000 will be required. We are sure that not one of the estimates in this calculation can be challenged, and that it is a mere shutting of the eyes to plain facts to assume a lower outlay. And what it is now de sirable should be known is the period over which this outlay of £12,000,000 is to spread. If the time is six years, an annual railway outlay of £2,000, 000 is quite heavy enough. If the estimated period is four years, the annual outlay on railways alone would be £3, 000, 000, and this is far too much. It would mean that we would have to raise £12, 000, 000 for the new lines, the £2,000,000 now owing for old works, and say £2,000,000 for waterworks and miscellaneous pur poses, or £16, 000,000 in four years , and few will say that this is not too heavy a borrowing. Mr GILLIES spoke admirably on this subject of undue loan expendí ture. It was pleasant to hear him rehearse orthodox sentiments of not unduly rushing the money market, but at the same time he gave no pledge that would prevent his Ministry making permanent the outlay of £5,600,000 per annum asked for this year. On this issue the House should certainly express an opinion. It is to be noted that Mr GILLIES in timated to the House that many of the country lines recently constructed do not pay, and that he does not expect that any of the country lines included in the new measure will pay for several years to come. He thinks that they have a future, but ho will go no further than this somewhat vague declaration He sees that there will be more or less heavy deficits in the railway accounts, involving charges on the general tax payer for some time to come, and he asks the House to consider whether it would not be advisable to make some special appropriation or to provide some extraordinary subsidy to meet this loss. Any such scheme will require to be considered on its merits. The suggestion that we must be prepared for railway deficits requir ing to be specially provided for shows that we are making a new depar ture in railway construction, and is evidence in itself that the greatest care ought to be taken in adding to the Go vernment proposals. There will be a clamorons demand for more mileage. And evidently the Opposition consider that the weak part of the Government scheme is the proposal for a double communication with the northern suburbs. Members are already being canvassed for votes for striking out either the Collingwood or the Fitzroy line and for using the money for country railways. A plausible case can be made out for the omission, but at the same time it has to be borne in mind that the experts are strongly of opinion that these two lines would yield handsome returns, while the new lines to be put in their places would be railways less re- munerative than the non remunerative lines which Mr GILLILS has adopted \- for of course the Ministry have taken the best of the bunch. We have always been advocates of a development of the country which shall be generous to outlying districts but, as the Premier put the case, it is better to build 10 per cent suburban lines, and use the profit to ease the country loss, than it is to throw that loss directly on the revenue and to strike out the remunerative lines in the bill with a view of adding to the non remunerative lines, would appear to be hardly the right way to bring about the desired result of making the state railways pay as a whole. It is astonishing to find in a country which boasts of a large number of industries, and which offers many roads to success in life, that there are over 11,000 applications for some 600 vacancies in the Railway department. The very multitude of the applicants is sufficient to prove that this widespread wish to enter the Government service is not due to any lack of employment. The great majority, if not all of them, are at the present moment earning their livelihood in the service of private firms. Many of them doubtless hail from the country districts, but they prefer to clean engines or to strut about a rail way platform in a porters uniform rather than to till the soil and clear the bush. Many of them are probably employed by con tractors in the towns but even though they may be earning higher wages out side, the Government stroke has irresistible charms for them. On every occasion that the Railway Commis sioners have advertised the number of applicants has steadily increased. Not only have they been able to fill every vacancy without difficulty, but they have been beset by applications from thousands of men beyond the number required. This fact is a crushing reply to the demand which is made in Par liament for an increase in the rate of wages paid to the railway servants. The wages at present given are sufficient to attract applicants from private em ployment in embarrassing numbers. When we learn that there are no less than 3, 780 able bodied young men who want to become engine-cleaners, and 1,186 whose highest ambition is to be porters, we certainly fail to see that the rates of pay are too low. At present the rail- way service is evidently the most popular in the country with a large section at least, of workmen and if the wages were raised, half the adult population of the community would apply for vacancies, and would entreat the members of Parliament to use their influence with the commissioners and get situations for them. Whence has arisen this immense craving to enter the Government ser vice, and why should a man who has the opportunity of spending a useful life in the free air of the country desire to clean engines? There are far more substantial rewards to be obtained out side the department. Whatever pro motion the railway authorities have to give is far off and comes slowly. There is, of course, the odd chance that the railway porter, if he lives long enough, may become a Stationmaster, and that an engine cleaner may rise to be an engine driver. But for all of them the prospect is distant, and many of them will probably remain in the same subservient position to the end of their days. As for the large number who aspire to be railway clerks, they are certain to be kept permanently, like the line repairers at the same routine and drudgery. The chances outside of the department are infinitely better for every young man who has an indepen dent spirit . The work of the country may be hard, but, as long as there is land to be cultivated and a market for the products every agricultural labourer has the chance of making for himself a comfortable home in the most mdepen dent fashion. We may make the same re mark about other classes of labourers. For those among them who are self reliant and energetic and shrewd, there are greater opportunities of rising in the world outside of the department altogether. What, then, is the cause of this wild rush for insignificant posts in the railway service? It will be noticed that the great bulk of the applicants are unskilled labourers. They have learnt enough to know that the supply of work for them is sometimes pre carious, and they are well aware that as soon as they enter the Government service they are secure for life. Their situation is regarded as a perpetual pension, the condition that they are to work for a certain number of hours a day being modified by a considerable sprinkling of holidays. The promotions may be small, the rate of wages definitely fixed ¡ but, then, the money is paid every month, and there is no necessity to seek for a new job when a contract is completed. Parents feel that they have done their duty, and that their children are thoroughly pro vided for, when they have got a situation in the Government service. A great many people seem to shrink from the long apprenticeship which is required in learning a trade properly. On the one side it is found that young men can earn high wages at an earlier period by unskilled or half skilled labour, and their apprenticeship, with all that it m volves in the future, is sacrificed. On the other side are many parents who think that their sons are too good or too refined to take their place in foundries and workshops, and fondly imagine that they do well by making them clerks. The result in both cases is the same, that the men find themselves in a class which is overcrowded, and then work is frequently precarious. Ex perience has shown in England that tho skilled artisans suffer comparatively slightly even during a depression. A similar experience may be learnt in this colony, for it will be seen that the pro- portion of skilled workers applying for situations in the railway service is not so outrageously large as in the other classes. The inference is plain. The surest way to success and independence is to master one occupa tion thoroughly, whether it be in the country or the city and to keep to it. Otherwise men become dependent, they look to the Government to find them in wages, they feel that when they are outside the charmed circle of state paid servants, their livelihood is precarious and they lose the quali ties of self reliance and individual energy which make true manhood. They rush after Government situations instead of striking out a career for themselves, they become in a sense hangers on instead of being producers. It was not so that the early pioneers acted ; it is not by this timid feeling that the real wealth of the country will be increased. Many of our young men are fitted for much better things than cleaning engines and dawdling about railway platforms, their strong arms and clear heads are required to bring the country under cultivation, and to add to the resources of the colony to which they belong.

They were ex pectant but dubious for while all hoped for much from the Railway Bill, every man was uncertain as to his fate. Never before was Mr Gillies listened to with so much anxiety but instead of showing his hand at once he spent considerable time in introductory remarks He seemed to enjoy the situation greatly. At last he came to the list of new lines, and he read in a loud voice the first, "Alberton to Boodyarn," "To where?" shouted the astonished House with one voice, none of the members having heard such an extraordinary name. "To Boo dy arn," replied Mr Gillies emphasis ing every syllable. "It is a place in South Gippsland." "Oh !" sighed the House in relief. Then the list was read without interruption until the line "Stawell to Wallaloo," was mentioned. "That suits me," cried Mr Woods, as he reached for his hat and, to the accompani- ment of roars of laughter walked out of the chamber, to telegraph the good news to his district. The few remaining lines were named, maps were distributed, and the members who knew the worst could hardly disguise their disgust. On the whole, the general feeling may be said to be against the measure, because of the meagreness of the proposals, but it is never safe to predict the course of events in connection with a bill of this kind. Several Opposition members having expressed their views, the bill was introduced, read a first time and will be sent to the Railway Commissioners for estimates of the cost of each line, and of the probable traffic and so on. The only other business was the introduction of several Government bills and the House adjourned at a quarter to 9 o'clock. The Railway Bill provides for the con- struction of 814 miles of line of which 783.60 miles in 43 separate lines will be in the country and 30. 95 miles in 10 lines in the suburbs. The estimated cost of land, earth- works, etc. for country lines is £6,965 per mile or a total of £5,458,000, and for sub- urban lines £54,387 per mile or a total of £1,683,000. To these estimates £765, 000 has to be added for permanent way material, such as rails, giving a gross total of £7,906,000. The country lines are distributed over all parts of the colony. Provision is made for tapping the mallee by extensions from Dimboola, Warracknabeal, Donald and Glenloth, and communication is to be ex tended westwards from Natimuk towards the South Australian border parallel with the existing line to Adelaide. The wheat grow- ing areas in the north are to be served with branches from present lines from Ingle- wood, EImore, Heathcote and Kyabram. Junctions are to be made between Laane- coorie and Arnold's bridge, Dunolly and Bradford, Guildford and Daylesford, Scars dale and Beeac with a branch to Camperdown. Other lines in the Western district will be from Allansford to Nirranda and Larpent to Scott's Creek, while a small extension will be made from Geelong to Barwon Heads. In the north east it is pro- posed to make connection between Benalla and Fifteen Mile Creek, Alexandra and the present terminus of the Alexandra line, Wangaratta and Hedi, Tallangatta and Koetong, Yackandandah and Dederang. The Heidleberg line will be extended to Diamond Creek, the Lilydale line to Launching Place, the Mornington line to the vicinity of Dromana. A short length will be extended from Beaconsfield to Gem brook and the Gippsland lines will be as follows: - Neerim South to Neerim, Mono meith to McDonald's Track, Moe to Moon- darra, Leongatha to Boyle's Creek, Meeniyan to Lower Tarwin, Alberton to Boodyarn via Yarram, Yarram to Woodside, Montgomery to Strathfieldsaye, Bairnsdale to Bruthen, Bairnsdale to Colquhoun. The character of the proposals in regard to country lines may be gauged from the fact that the longest line will be but 36 miles. The suburban lines in- clude direct lines to Fitzroy and Collingwood, the latter to be continued to the Yarra Bend reserve, a line from Kew to Templestowe with a branch from Bulleen road to Don caster, a line from Flemington bridge to Pascoevale, and others from Newmarket to Keilor, Essendon to Bulla, and Sandringham to Cheltenham. An Opposition caucus was held last even ing during the refreshment hour at which the Railway Bill was briefly discussed. It was found impossible to enter into details but general dissatisfaction was expressed. Several members urged that nothing should be said at that stage, but there were others who thoueht that their constituents would expect to hear their views. Accorlingly everyone was allowed a free hand but very few members took advantage of the opportunity to speak when the House resumed. Mr Munro, Sir Bryan O'Loghlen and Mr Baker had condemned the bill before the adjournment for refresh ments. Other members spoke afterwards. Mr M Intyre declared himself satisfied and urged that country members should not op- pose the suburban lines, seeing that the metropohtin railways had in the past as sisted to meet the loss on the provincial lines. Mr Turner expressed surprise at the omission of the line from St. Kilda to Elwood, which had been marked on the plans of Government land to be sold in that quar ter. Mr Mc Lellan, Mr Taverner, Mr Hall, Mr Dixon, and Mr Officer all expressed disapproval more or less emphatic, while Mr Levien and Mr Zox gave support to the Government. Mr Armytage openly imputed corruption, by saying "All the lines have gone to the Government side," and by further re marking that the five Opposition members who voted for the Government on the recent no confidence division had each secured a line while the two Opposition members most satisfied (Mr McIntyre and Mr Woods) were strong supporters of the increase of Mr Speight's salary. Mr Gillies in moving for leave to intro- duce the Railway Bill in the Legislative Assembly last evening mentioned that appli cations had been made for 6000 miles of lines, of which 1,500 were for alternative routes. This left 4,500 to be dealt with and the principle of selection was that the settlers in agricultural districts, far removed from railway communication should first be served and then that others living in diffi- cult country and requiring special facilities should be attended to. When those requirements had been met it was found impossible to go further, having regard to the amount to be expended. Consequently the applications for cross lines to join one railway town with another were set aside. While being determined not to show undue timidity, the Government was also deter mined not to make such a demand on the London market as would frighten investors and therefore fixed £8,000,000 as about the amount which could reasonably be authorised to be expotided on the lines. We should not attempt to do too much in any one year and if we overrun the constable we would have to pay a larger price for our loans than was now paid. Members were informed that the estimates might be relied upon. They were heavier than were submitted for the last act but then the amount for that act, which was originally set down at £5,000,000 was exceeded by £2,500,000. The actual cost of the lines under that act had formed the basis of the estimates for the lines now proposed. But no provision was to be made for rolling stock, as in former bills. The estimates of the cost of rolling stock on the basis of the mileage of the lines were altogether illusory. For instance in the act of 1884, £178,000 was set aside for that purpose but since that year £222,000 had been expended. During his speech on the Railway Bill last night Mr Gillies was interrupted by a remark from Sir Bryan O'Loghlen to the effect that there were no lines for the Western district. Mr Gillies then spoke sympathetically. He had visited that quarter of the colony and found that while the land was good it was held in large areas by few owners and settlement was consequently sparse. "You will not find half a dozen people in as many miles" was his descrip tion. Under these circumstances it appeared to him to be unjustifiable to propose the construction of lines in that part of the colony much as he would have liked to have done so. Railways would not pay until the land was subdivided. A new and important departure in regard to the construction of railways was proposed by Mr Gillies last night and loudly cheered. He said that much of the excess of expendi ture over estimate in former years was due to an unexpected rise in the price of land re quired. The fact that a railway line was to be made was held to give the land a value which it would not otherwise have had and therefore the state was fined for doing good. In order to prevent such loss in connection with the new lines it was pro posed in the bill that in assessing the amount of compensation the value of the land on the date of the introduction of the bill should be the maximum, not the value at the time the land was to be actually taken for the lines. "And" said the Premier, "if we have to pay compensation to a man for land taken for railway purposes, he is entitled to pay some thing on account of the additional value given to the remaining land by the construction of a line." Another statement, also well re ceived foreshadowed rather vaguely the adoption of a new policy in regard to making good the loss on new lines. The hon gentleman frankly avowed that though all the country lines would ultimately pay, all of them would be unprofitable for some years, and it would be a question for Parlia ment to consider whether or not special pro vision should be made for meeting the defi ciency in every case in which a line failed to pay working expenses and interest on cost of construction. "What do you propose?" asked Mr Dixon. "1 am not going to make any proposal at the present time," replied Mr Gillies, "but the matter is of sufficient importance to be thought over by hon members, and when they have had that opportunity the Government will state what its views are. Any course we pursue in this direction will certainly improve our credit in the London market. Apart from the clause authorising the con struction of the lines the most important sections in the Railway Bill are 15 and 16, dealing with the payment of compensation for land resumed. Clause 15 reads as fol lows -" Notwithstanding anything con tained in section 35 of the Lands Compensa tion Act 1890, the amount of purchase money or compensation payable for or in respect of any land purchased or taken by the commissioners for the purposes of this act shall not exceed the value thereof on the 17th day of June, in the year 1890." Clause 10 is in these words -" In estimating the purchase money or compensation to be paid to any person for or in respect of any land purchased or taken by the commis sioners for the purposes of this act, regard shall be had by the magistrates, arbitrators, surveyors, valuators or jury, as the case may be, to the enhancement in value of any ad joining lands belonging to such person, and also to the advantages which will accrue to such person by reason of the construction and use of such railway, and a deduction shall be made accordingly from the amount which but for this provision would have been paid or payable as purchase money or compensa tion. Two important questions involving vital principles in railway administration, were asked and replied to in the Legislative Assembly yesterday. Mr Turner requested Mr Gillies to " direct the Railway Commis sioners to provide extra train accommodation on the St. Kilda line, but the Premier said that he would not do so. The management of traffic was essentially a matter for the commissioners to decide upon, and he (Mr Gillies) did not desire to assume the re sponsibility of interfering in the manner sug gested. He would, however, be happy to con- sult with the commissioners on the point but doubted whether the running of additional trains would obviate the crowding of some of the trains on the line. Passengers were im patient to get away and rushed the carriages, though in a few minutes they could be accommodated in another train. The traffic would not be properly regulated until the station accommodation was recast so that only so many passengers as a train could accom modate comfortably would be allowed on the platform at one time. The second question was in regard to Mr Allison Smith. Mr Clark asked that the House might have an opportunity of consider ing the subject of that gentleman's proposed appointment to be locomotive superintendent before such appointment was made. Several members cheered the request, but many others cheered the Premier when he replied firmly in the negative. He thought it would be a very bad precedent to invite the House to make appointments, and thereby assume a responsi bility which did not belong to it. It was not in the public interest that there should be any interference with the commissioners in such matters, unless there were good reason to believe that a highly improper appointment had been made. The annual report of Sir William McGregor, the Administrator of Her Majesty's Govern ment in British New Guinea, was laid upon the table of tue Legislative Assembly last evening, and gives an interesting account of the work done in the development of that territory during the last 12 months.
