THE EDGE OF THE EAST. By Rudvaed Kiplis« in the Melbourne Aiyn*. The mist was clearing off Yokoliama har bour, and a hundred junks had their sails hoisted for the .norniDg breeze, so that the veiled horizon was stippled with square blurs of silver. An English man-of-war showed Muc- white on the haze, so new was the day light, and all the water lay out as smooth as the inside of an ovster-shell. Two children in blue and white, their tanned limbs pink in the fresh air, sculled a marvellous boat of lemon-hued wood, and that was o'iir fairy craft, to tlie shore across the stillness aud the mother -o'-pearl Levels. There are ways aud ways of entering Japan. The best is to descuud upon it from America and the Pacific— from the barbariaus aud the deep sea. Coming from the East, the blaze of India and the insolent tropical vegetation of Singapore dull the eye to half colours and little tones. It is at Bombay that the Smell of All Asia boards the ship miles off shore, and holds the passenger's uosc till lie is clear of Asia again. That is n violent, an aggressive smell, apt to pre judice the stranger, but kin uooe the less stole across the light airs of the daybreak when the fairy boat weut to shore — a smell of very clean new wood ; split bamboos, wood smoke, damp earth, and the things that people who are not white people cat —a homelike and comforting smelL Then followed on shore the sound of an Kasteru tongue, that is beautiful or not, as you happen to kuow it. The Western races have iiiauy languages, but a. crowd of Europeans heard thioug^i closed doors talk with the Western pitch aud cadence. So it is with the East. A line of Gen rickshaw coolies sat in the sun discoursing to each other, and it was as though they were welcoming a return in speech that the listener must know as well as English. They talked and they talked, but the ghosts of familiar words would not grow any clearer Till pre sently the Smell came down tlie open streets again, saying that this was the East where nothing matters, and trifles old as the Tower of Babel mattered less than nothing, and that there were old acquaintances wsitiug at every Smell of the East ! Railways, telegraphs, docks, and gunboats cannot banish it, and it will endure till the railwavs are dead. He who has not smelt that smell has not lived. Three years ago Yokohama was sufficiently Europea nised in its shops to suit the worst and wickedest fcvste. To-day it is still worse if you keep to the town limits. Ten steps beyond into the fields all the civilisation stops exactly as it does in another land a feu* thou sand miles further west. The globe-trotting millionaires, anxious to spend money, with a fancies, ba-i explained to us aboardsbip that they came to Japan in liastc, advised by their guide-books to do so, lest the la^id should be suddenly civilised between s'caiuer-sailing and stea-iner-sailiug. When they touched laud they ran away to the curio shops to buy things which are prepared for them — mauve this time they have a J/ array under one ami, aud an electric blue eagle, with a. copperas beak and a yellow ' E jitunbit* auuia '' embroidered ou apple-preen silk, uuder the other.

Our garden overhangs the harbour, and by pushing aside one branch we look dowu upon a lieavy-stcrued fishing boat, the straw-gold mats of the deck -house pushed Uack to &how; the perfect order and property of the house keeping that is going forward. The father fishcr, sitting frog-fashioo, is poking at a tiny box full of charcoal, and the light white ash is blown back into the face of a largish Japanese doll, price 2s. 3d. in BayswaUir. The doll wakes, turns into a Japanese baby something more valuable than money could buy — a baby with a sbaveu head and aimless legs. It crawls to the thing in the polished brown box, is picked up just as it ib ready to cat live coals, aud set down behind a thuart, where it drums upon & bucket, addressing the firebox, from afar. Half-a-dozen cherry hlossains elide off a bough aud waver down to the water close to the Japanese doll, who in another minute M'ill be overside in pursuit of these miracles. The father-fisher lias it by the pink hind leg, and this time it is tucked away, all but the top knot, out of sight among umber act£ and sepia cordige. Ruing an Oriental, it makes no protest, aud the boat scute out to join the little fleet iu the offing. Then two sailors of a man-of-war come aloug the sea face, lean over the canal below the garden, spit, and roll away. The sailor in port is the only superior man. To him all matters, rare and curious, are either ' them things '* or ** them other things.' He does net hurry himself, he does not seek adjectives other than those which custom puts ^into his mouth for all occasions ; but the beauty of life ]-enetrates his being in sensibly till he get£ drunk, falls foul of the local policeiuau, smites him into the nearest canal, and disposes of the question of treaty revision with a hiccup. AU the same, Jack says that he has a grievance against the policeman, who is paid a dollar for every strayed seaman he brings np to the Consular Courts for overstaying his leave and so forth. Jack says that the little fellows deliberately hiuder him from getting back to his skip, and then, with devilish art and craft -of wrestling tricks — ** there are about a hundred of 'em, and they can throw you with every qualified one ' — carry him to justice. Koh', when Jack, is softened with drink Ue docs not tell lies. This is his grievance, and he says that them blanketed consuls ought to know. ' They plays into each other's hand, and. stops yoo at the Hatoba ' — tlie policemen. The visitor who is neither a seauian nor drunk cannot swear to the truth of this, or indeed fascinating scenes aud a lovely people, but, as he is sure to fiud out before lie has been a day ashore, between stormy questions. Three years ago there were no uucstions that were not going to be settled oflliand in a blaze of It had a grey pale cover with a chrysanthe mum at the hackT and a Japanese editor told as other countries, and *o il is all right. Now we are quite civilised because of Constitu tion.' A perfectly irrelevant story comes to miud here. Do you know tliut in Madeira, once they had a revolution which lasted just long uatioual anthem, aud then was put dowD t All that is left of the revolt now is Hie song that you hear on the t wangling noe/iettm, the baby -ban joes of a moonlight night under the banana fronds at the back of Fuuchal. And the high- pitched uasal refrain of it is ihe first and the last of them is, that of Tn- aty Revision.
