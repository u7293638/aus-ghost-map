THEORY AND PRACTICE. Mrs. Elizabeth Graimis, a lady of great wealth, and president of the. "Ladies' League for the Suppression of Vice," was entertaining the members of the league at her house in New York, on July 14, when the premises were invaded by a drunken tramp, who walked into the basement and proceeded to take off various articles of I113 clothing. When nearly all his apparel had been cast aside the intruder caluily walked Upstairs and appeared, an un invited guest, in~the midst of the gathering. The ghost of 13 an quo could not have startled them more. The fifty ladies engaged in de vising ways and means of reforming the wickedness of a degenerate age set up a suc cession of shrieks that drowned the whistling of "the locomotives on "the elevated." The tramp, saying that lie was very tirecl arid only needed sleep, calmly stretched himself up'dn the carpet and prepared for rest. A police man was promptly upon the scene, and the in truder was haled before a _ magistrate to explain, if he could, his inconsiderate conduct.
