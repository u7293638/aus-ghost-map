" A HAPPY HEW YEAR." The Christmas Time is the happiest time, The season when all is' gay ; When bells ring out with their merriest chime ; Nay, to wear a sad look is a positive crime On a merry Christmas Day ! 'Tis the season which Britons love the most Of all seasons m the year — A time when gaiety rules the roast, And sweetens our Christmas cheer. 'Tis a time for long-parted friends to meet, No matter how chang'd they may be ; A time when life's blisses are doubly sweet, A time when the pulses of charity beat With a kindly throb and a free ! 'Tis a time when bitterest foes should take Each others' hands and agree To end all dispute, with forgiving shake Beneath the Christmas Tree ! Last week in these pages Punch tried to paint The union he 'd like to see — How men should get rid of the passions which taint The mortal clay of both sinner and saint And be from prejudice free ! For some of the friends whom Punch holds dear Have given and taken hard knocks ; Nay, some seem to think a box on the ear The best sort of Christmas Box ! And who were the men in our picture shewn So lovingly linked together ? Why, the Kiama Ghost, with a comely crown, And the Governor, too, with a goose come down : . There were birds of every feather ; Martin and Parkes, and the pick of their crew — The Freeman and the Banner — Eagar and Duncan, and Robertson, too, All grouped in a friendly manner ! Here's a health to all who figure here, Both the foolish and the wise ones ; May Folly die out with the closing year And Wisdom become to all men more dear, And may all our lots be prize ones. This night the Old Year doth cover his face — A scene in Life's Pantomime shifts — And Hope cometh up with a beaming face, All laden with New Year's Gifts.
