Hod's (forttcr. IN THE FIELDS. Cold Wiutcr's pallid ghost hath frighted been, And, smiling, in his place comes tliiugs more fair ; Spring's pleasant promise is in all the sir, Like lover's presence, felt ere yet 'tis sceu. Awaking, as from long and deadly trance, Earth'u bare and withered bosom seems to move, While peeping, timid suuboama kiss in love The naked, trembling boughs through which they glance. All nature leels me gcutie innu ami waists, Delights, yet knows not what it ia delights, Her quickened soul, save that all dreary nights Are past, and she new vernal vigour take*. There is a gentler music iu llie brook, Sudden the woods a new green glory fills, As, 'neath a laved one's gaze a sleeper thrills. So stirs the Karth beneath Spring s loving look. Stire, starts, and trembling wakes to life anew â€” To glad, green meadows, to broad fields aglow With daffodil and primrose, to the flow Of breathless music from the o'er- arching blue. Where floats the lark upon a sea of song Poured from the thrilling riches of his throat, A feathered Binging-spirit, every note Bearing his soul in love and joy along. O gentle Spring, sweet type of life eterne ! Be my life fragrant, fresh, and pure as theu With new hope rising, may I, even now, See Life from Death iu springing flower and fern. Allan S. Laing.
