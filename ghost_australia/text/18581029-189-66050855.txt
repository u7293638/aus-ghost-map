THE MAGISTRACY. iTo the Editor of the Star.) SIB,-I am grieved to witness the develop ment of a very uuamiable .piiitvritb reference, to the late Magisterial appointments. The Ministry seem to be blamed for elevating men to the dignity of magistrates who are really quite unfit to fill eo* important and honorable a position. The ill-natured remarks I have heard are happily inapplicable to- some of the gentlemen appointed for this district. Indeed tbe selection, in oneor two instances especially, is peculiarly happy.- To silence the envious earplugs of the disappointed many, I will briefly recapitulate the qualifications of those newly appointed gentlemen who may be called upou to assume the functions of judge in bur Ballarat Courts. Of 'all the number gazetted, none "will tend to raise the estimation of the Bench,".'or resound more to the praise of ' the Ministry, 1 than tbe appointment of Mr W. C. Smith. Gifted with an eloquence rarely equalled, ' sublime in his conceptions of what is great | and true ; never permitting himself to be j driven by external circumstances from that pith of rectitude which he loves to follow ; possessed of a ready flowing diction, generous, upright and manly, Mr ¡fenith is the very em- j bodiment of all those virtues which befit a man to fill with honor, the grave duties of a Justice of the Peace. With a prepossessing exterior, and without any outward show of knowledge, he yet carries 'about with him a load of wisdom, weighty as "the massive gates of Somnaulh,and varied aa the tints of ah English meadow. Unlike Dr Johnson, Mr Smith has given his days and nights to the study of Blackstone, 'rather than of Addison ; his style being already incapable of greater perfection, and Iiis mind needing only that ' which happily it craves for-a sound knowledge of justice between man and man. His forensic skill is beyond that of Erskine,: his varied talents Burke (or Bare) alone ex-' celled. Transcendent as are the abilities bf Mr W. C. Smith, -they are greatly,enhanced by his modesty "of demeanor and his lowliness of manner. He even consented to act as a" cicerone to Mr O'shanassy]-the Irish Moses having been driven , about the country by the noble-minded Smith. " Many people will say that. this was only a sample of the toadyism which earned the honor now conferred!^ Every ope; except' those whom niahce has blinded, knows right well r that the .Great Q believed himself to; be cohferring the greatest possible dignity upon "bus ministry, when he obtoined the unwilling consent bf Mr Smith to grace the magistracy with bis . ríame and talents.
