FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT. In the best men there is a tendency to do certain things they ought not, but the more they are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more it is true of them that they are kept from doing what otherwise they would. When I was a boy I used to go to the Polytechnic in London, where my favourite diversion was a diving bell, which had seats around the rim, and which at a given time was filled with people and lowered into a tank. We used to go down deeper, deeper into the water, but not a drop ever came into that diving-bell, though it had no bottom, and the- water was quite within reach, because th9 bell was so full of air that the water lusted against the air, the air lusted againBt the water because air was being pumped in all the time from the top, and the water could not do what it other wise would do. If you are full of the Holy Ghost, the fleBh life is underneath you, and though it would surge up, it is kept out. â€” F.'B. Meyer.
