A LADY'S PARTING ADDRESS TO IAIN DON. S?J juminta vacant, el solinclivat, eund&m; est. And must we part! dear Town, adieu! Whereevery object still was new, Where days and nights so swiftly flew — Farewell, dear London ! $o more tbj bustle shall delight, JNo more thy shops shall glad my sight, With every ware and dainly dight— Farewell, dear London Where else such bargains can we buy 2 Where make so quick the money fly .' And every wildest want supply, As in dear London ? Where can we gad the lirelong day Amidst variety so gay r And then at night 10 see a play! O charming London ! 0 happy City, bless'd bj fate ! Where else do people dine so late, Lords, merchants, ministers of state, As in dear London r How sweet at night, by hook or crook, To squeeze througli crowds, and match a look, Elbowing bishop, lord, or duke, On stairs in London. And oft :it operas, balls, and plays, With nonchalance affect to gaze At painted girls and men in stays, Who throng in London. Alas ! such joys are mine no more, 1 go to join my Aunt — the bore ! To rise at seven, and dine at four, Far, far from London. How oft in tedious winter nights, When every gentler saund affrights, Shall 1 remember thy delights, Too charming London ! Nay, when the cypresses shall wave Their mournful branches o'er my craw. Oil shall my ghost escape, and have A peep at London.
