CIIAPTEI. XXXVI. MIR. LrEICESTERs pursued his way after what he had heard, sorely perplexed in spirit. All along he had felt sure that there was fraud in Vera's possession of . filverstone, but he could see no way to prove his suspicions. He knew enough of Betty Bird to be sure that if he approached the subject with her and accused her of having spoken as she did she would deny it outright. Not very long before all the changes that had. taken place at, Milverstoue, and while Betty'was in the depths of poverty, he had heard Mrs. Deacon 'lecturing her for using her tongue too~freely. It was about a trifling matter, and Betty had declared ii the most penitent manner that she did not know any thing about it'- that she had been drunk when she "said the offending words, and nothing had been farther from her mind than to give offence Were he to accuse her of having spoken as she did and demand to know what.she meant, she would be ready with the.same excuse, and be on her guard for the future, He must watch-watch both her and 'the new owners of Milverstone. There, was more to come of Vera's successful claim,, he, was sure, than had already appeared.: He was on his way to Raybrook when he accidentally came "upon Neville Delamere and the old worian. He liad fancied 'therd was a slight change in the poor squire of late, and he longed to propose a remedy which his skill told him '?would be efficacious. He, had mentioned it at first'.iwhen' the other doctors were, summoned from London, but the great men had' pooh- poohed his suggestion and rather treated him as if'hbe were an inexperienced beginer. ;He had felt annoyed, but he had not liked to press the point, which, after all was un certain. ' Now he felt, a little differenitly, -Mri, Blennerbasset had learned 'to like-him and trust him, and he had been a great aidto her in her lonelhness. He helped to cheer her more than she had ever thought' anyone could, and always bade her hope for the best. He would not allow that the squire'would not get better, it was quite' possible" that his senses would return and that he would get about. . She tried to believe him, but she had come to be in a certain 'way content with her lot, and to thinkihat the silentfigure on ihe bed would be all she would 'ever have again:of the husband who had loved her. so vwell. It would have been almost better if he had been killed outtight, she sometimes thought, till Belton' Leicesteir, with his cheery words and frank, hope.inspiring face, bade her, put away such dismal thoughts and look forward 'to a brighter future."' ." She met limi,on this day with a teaiful face-she Was generally calm-and he won dered at her agitated look and her broken speech. ' What has hap~pened ?' he asked, softly. 'Nothing seriotus, I hope.' ' I don't know-perhaps nothing, but he-is different, Mr: Leicester. -He seems to look about him as ifhbe was: wondering.' If ahb were not deceiving berself it was a great step in the -right direction, -but he feared she mtiust 'be mistaken; 'Shall I go up to him ?'I he nasked.' SHe is'asleep, now orI should not be down she replied. :' They are to call me the minute he opens his-eye?'.:- ' . lMrs. Blenireir?sset had a trussy:ti'urse sl'oE attended on the invalid, doing.everything for. him with the assistance of his ow;n man;,whbo had grown-giey in 'the: Rabrool service anid' would not leave his master, and, she was obliged to confess that thh twio between them did tar better than if she. had done ,whatat first she would have liked to do and' attend on her helpless husband herself;: She looklted at Belton Leicester with critical eyes as he sat oppposite to her;on.the sofa..: *Are you ill, Mr. Leicester ?i she asked.,' ' No.' Troiubled about something then ?': 'You. have, quick eyes,' heI: said, with a, smile.,- :-ies I:am'. troubled more,than I can tell.' , ' What about?.Ahb: forgive:nime, Perhaps that is a question I should not-l?ut. .:I it is about any;of: your villagework can I not help you ? . - â‚¬ : " ..; .-: : :, . , .,., . ?

She would not stop at murder'td attain any object.' 'Murder ? Oh i Mr. Leicester.' 'I am talking in a safe place,' he said, smil ing, 'or.I should not make such an assertion, I belieire tlhe'da will;come when I-'shall be asked to make it in public.

'oison Do 'you mean to say thtat that woman wanted to murder her, Mr. Leicester ?' 'Nd I don't think she did, but she wanted her place, and she knew what would make her ill. I know wlhat she bought for the pur pose and. where she bought it, and something else too that I have an idea she found use ful. D)id you ever see those letters, Mrs. Blennerhiseact ?' 'The ones she found ? 'Yes.' 'No but I heard enough about them. I remember something about them years ago, when we had little notion what was in them. Sir Darcie was in an awful way about somie thing no one kne;v what.' ' I beliede the whole thing will turn oit to be an imposition, and thatsome day we shall see the right ownier back,' ' Heaven girant we may. I believe it would bring my poor old man babk to life, th6ugh he doesn't know anything about yit yet. Wasn't it str?nge that the aceident ahould happen the very night of all the fuss ? It seemed as if it wasto be. I believe hgwduld know about it if anyone did. : 'Imust get at Betty, Birds antecedents,' Belton Leicester said. 'This much Iknow: she' was not alwaysthe wretched creature she has seemedhere. She was an actress and'ac: quainted with Mrs. Delamere's parents.' . ' And she's keeping some wicked secretfor her,' the squire's wife said, excitedly, .' That's it, Mr. Lhicester"; she must blie made to speak.' ;'I am afraid that would be a difficult mat ter if she did not' choose.'" Driunken, people are always the mnst difficult to deal with,' they can lay everything to' the s'core of their failing. They can deny evdrything point blank, as I have no doubt she' will when thie time comes to question her.' .. .-'.Oh, why did that poor child run away?' Mrs Blennerhasset said, with tears in her eyes. i'lWhly'id she not stay and let us take care of her ? She should have been a, dear daughter to me, and something better still to you I am thinking. Ab, you needn'i look at me like that; we old women have eyes, Mr. Leicesteir, arid I have read your secret this many a day.' 'I seem to have carried myheart upon my sleeve,' he returned, sadly, ' and Heaven knows I did not mean to. 1 do love her, and now that there is little chance of my ever seeing her again I don't mind- confessing it.' 'But you 'will' see her.again, she will be found some day,'and if she 'is and says you nay when you ask tec, he 'vont be the Nellie I take her for.' ' I shall never ask lher, madame.': 'Not if we find her and she is. willing, as she will be ? She liked you even while she was blinded by that wicked nephew of mine. Ydtir sheltering arms would be a havein of rest for h'er, poorchild. 'And you lbve aier.' ' As I love my life.'. ' I don't think I quite understand you. Why waould you ndt ask her? She is friendless and alone. Is that it?' i That would be the first reasonfor trying to win her.. IHow can.. ask her to marry me, knowing as I do, feeling sure that some day she will come to her own again ? It will look asif I traded on my belief. I will do all. I can to help her and bring her back, and it will be done, and then- ' 'And then what?' - ' . ...: '. I will turn my back ulpon En'gland forever, thankful to know that she is happy;and at rest.' ' It strikes me we are both talking non sense,'. Mrs. Bleanerhasset said, smiling, though the tears were in her eyes; .' We.had better go upstairs I think. Ah,'here is nurse. Is he awake, nurse ?' .'Yes, ma'am.' They went up to the pleasant room where the squire lay. It 'was airy aid comfortable aind in summer had been a very bower of flowers and gireenery. ' He loves flowers so,' Mrse. Blennerlasset had said'when Mrs. Deacon 'expressed' her surprise at the trouble 'aklen for one whoa.p parently could neithe see 'nodr" hear. ' And though he's lying:there so still I don't kaow that he doesn't see and smell them.'" So' the flowers held their placeall through the bright weather, and now. they he'd given 'place tosall sorts of comforts that the squire had been lised to. The room was arranged just as if hIe were going to get up and occupy the easy chair that stood iniÂ·itihgly by the fire,: and his dressing gown hung where it could be ''eached at a ininute's notice. 'His eyes were wide 'opein as' the young doctor and his wife entered the room, and it 'really seemed to Belton Leicester as if there was somne little 'seculation in tliem. They ~re not so b.glassy as.they hbad ben and they' moved slightly, following them about the room as it seemed. . i Is it gopd or bad ?' asked Mrs. Blennerhas-. set, i'i a .wbisper. ,. Good, I hope,' was the reassuring reply, and Mr. Leicester; as he bent over the still figure on the bed, felt sure that he was right'in his idea and thit the squire 'riiglit be cldre'd. , : : CHAPTER XXXII. ! WILL you trust :meI dear lady?' was ::the' question put by' Belton Leicester. to Mrs: lBlennerhasset, after:a careful iispectibon of hbtr h'uslband's state. :,:. " : . ': i !Thait I will,' was thelhearty reply... ', But what I wish to do'nay fail, I don't helieve'it will, butit may, '.nd then ' ' And then I shall know thatwhat; was done was for the best,' she said'holdiiig' out hbe~r, hand 'coidially. ',Mr,' Le.icester, :I. kn'ow you would restore my poor old man- if :you could, if it cost you your righ-lt hand, i' I think I wouild it' :it .dcost me my life,' wa?s the grave answer, 'but I have good hope. that it will be at no sticl sacrifice. I am sure- that;he cat bh:cured. .I don't say that hbe.will everrbe tIe bright, hearty gintleman everyone .iemembered him, but you, may have many years of peaceful life together.' -' Don'itsay it--don't make me hope yet,' the poor lady said, with tears. 'Mr. Leicester, I could not l~ear tlhe disappoint meiit-tse gfief- if---, . :; We shall not have any,' he sai'd, gently, in a 'firm voice.- 'It shall be a certainty; with' Heavien's help,' and then he ltook her hand and thoroughly expllained to her what lie wished to do.' She :did:not understand tlie".'technical terms of cburse,'but sheocom-' prehcided all that was meant. The bopera tion proposed would be a 'risk, If it tailed to rehleve what Mr."Leicester declared to -be only pressure on a vital part of the brain, the squire 'would never regain unconsciousness as long is.helived. If.it succeeded, as he hoped and believed it would, there would he ari annendment,'and in due timena coinplete recovery of reasos and s"peech, pirovided ino exciteie nt.or anxiety were allowed to inter rupt him.''-.'.' ... , ::: - ' You w'ilFl' do it yourseilf?'

Juidd for instance.' s . , :Sir Marcus Judd wias one of the doctors they hliad sumnioned frbin 'on ilbii at h'te time bf the ac'cidernt. He was one of the, first surgeons of ,th'e da?y, and ,he had negatived the proposal of thsei illage doctor, to:operate' of: the equire with :a. covert, scorn that wounded Mr; Leicester'greatly. ' I can't bear' to thiihl of the way that nian' treated :you. ' I sar it evne int:he inidst of my grief. He sieered at you as if you were a boy.' . . ' .' . ' ' 'So: I am -in'experience compared with him, I dorsot think he would sneer at the proposal now, and there is not a man in the profession with a surer hand or quicker eye. You had better send for him and hear what hlie says.' Mrs. Blennerhasset hesitated. She did not want Sir Marcus Judd, she said, but Mr. Leicester was firm. Without'the' sanction and assistance of the great London surgeon he would not undertake the operation. He had small fear of opposition now. The Symptoms that had developed themselves warranted immediate measures. So Sir Marcas Judd was telegraphed for, and came .with.what speed he might, and they awaited his verdict with such impatience as those. only know who have watched and wept'by theside bf all they hold most dear on earth,.' But they need.not have feared. The clevcr face had no shade on it when Sir Miacus camie td them and told them that Mr. Leicester.was right, and-there was room for:hope that an operation would be attended with success. Very gracefully he made his apologie. 'for his. difference of opinion: on that fortisr occiasion. 'You .had the clearer perceptiop,. Mr, Leicester,' he said,..in a cordial fashion that ' ivas orth a ,whole; .lifetime of' fees, the "young doctor declared aft.rwtirds to' his friends. :' You ; were riglit.abodlt the opieration; though. it might hasve bee'n premoature to perform it, ekactly, when you proposed ' â€¢ " :.r I have no doubt it would,' wai thbe ready, reply ' MIr.

'Not undertake it, St Marcus ? Why.' i 'Because ybu have a steady. hand ,and a cool head. It is your right--you proposed it, and. I anh ee in Mrs.. Blennerhasset's, eyes thta she would like it.. I will be here with 'pleasure if I can be of any use. ' Oh, ifyoiu please,' the squire's wife said; ' and you were. right, Sir Marcus, in' thinking that I should like Mi. Leicester to do it-no offence.to you-but.no one but me knows what he has been to me in all this dreadful time, and I think my husband, if lie could speak or know anything. abput it, would like it too.' The tears were in her eyes i.s she Â·spoke. She uvas:infeigndly'glad: that the great' mni had done Beltoo.

As she looked at his listless, joyless face as be stood by his wife in the box and gazed round the theatre with no sign of \- interest, she almost thought liher liberty well purchased, even at the cost of home and position. 'I would not change places with her now,' she said to herself, as a hand was laid on her shoulder, and she turned to see Miss Dar lington by her side, : Well, have )oti, gazed your. fiil ?'. she asked,: kindly..'

' His, wealth was great, but his family were of tle' obscurest, and her ladyship, who was the daughter of a lawyer herself and cohsequeritly at liberty to consider herself of the aristocra-. tic orders, had declared that the family' dignity would be compromised by such a match.
