" "GOODWOOD." GOODWOOD 3 To -tie uninitiated.tdoes not "the" word-conjure- up a-vision- ofja long'-and. delightful drive through »' shady unci -wooded park, of a smooth lawn- dapplecl oyer with'-the prettiest flowers '(in petfipoats) that our ( English garden rf beauty Wx boast ofcos'tumes v«ym^cen<£, i; n mi noh -'An irv.-At)fit aflM' ;re£ards|th^ but, for the r rest,f truth compels ns to. uncomfortable kind of. thing unless one happens -to he one of the house partial the Diie'df "Richm^ to " wluch^S^Kte^^ salves ^ iuSlgff'S^ when we preach, the station^ we can obtain a seat at all in thetrain, and 'bleBsed indeed if .we have noone to stand on our. toes or ram his; elbows .into our suffering sides. As we glide into Chichester sti^on, a vision as of a thousand chariots and a .thousand ' ^ drivers all ^massed together in : a ,state o : apparently inextricable confusion passes before our eyes.. Crossing to the other ; side, we .spy ouivcbachman afar off-: / but, alas I discover that his . getting to us is as hopeless as our.'getting .to him, so we wait our turn in the struggling, jostling, shouting' crowd,, pestered by brazenvoioed drivers, besieged, by vendors of . race-cards,- -harassed by trampling '{eel and pushing shoulders,-surrounded by ladies, cloaked and hooded, who might have come straight from an Eastern harem, to judge of the jealous care with which feature and /form , are shrouded frompublie^vie'w.xNottliat they- fear their jealous lord and master,. Mr. Sultan; :tbe' dust is theirs tyrant, .and \- decidedmeasureshave.jhadto be taken to escape iis-aiominion.* • "When we are -safely off, with a grinding of wheels, a ^r^re-^scri&Sa;^ surroundi^cJehus;andageneralsensation of .having only-escaped by. the skin of our teeth ifiom a'vterrific smash, we •discover that-the>"8trarigesnovy" lies ; half a-foot 'deep, and that it is pouring itself down our throats, into our clothes and eyes,-and making -us wish with all our hearts that either the heavens 'had , opened their floodgates last night, or that : TOme'':aniaiy-of merciful watiercamers had - perambulated the roads : ever siiicef* daybreak. Conversation is impaBsible^' ' we are : all''possessed by the consuming-desire for somethiny to drink.: ; A well-filled, drag just before us makes the ladies' of -our party feel spiteful. They say it must lie cooler up therejthan it is down here'; but, alas ! there can be "rio fre^mirdin^ie^king, blin<lirg_ matter ai^wbere, u^ess 'il-m^li'oe in, .-_ a balloon!. .Turning. into the park, we find it only, one degree less' unbearable than the road; but presently find an agreeable "diversion in observing the antics, gesticulations, and extraordinary percussive powers of the. riders of tlie supplementary horses in waiting to assist carriages up the steep ascent., The horsemanship ,of these uncouth pioneers provokes from us smiles that . would be J laughter if we were not all so dusty, and hot, and thirsty. One Irishman .in particular, galloping down the hill -at full.speed;.]iis arms and legs sawing the air like windmills, his enormous, mouth opened to., its utmost ; . width in . -apparent enjoyment: :of the ludicroiis spectacle he binds himself to : afford, revives us all so that we are ; ' cheerful when we reach the - top of th hill, y where-there is, .indeed, cool shadow and a ghost of a freshening breeze. ; We console ourselves byreflecting that . yesterday, was (^rtainlybotterthari-is to-day, and a.lady, who stall belnameless, remarks .• that, . for < the r ver .credit's sake of • the milliners, - ther mustsurelybe some gowns worth seeing torday, as: there was "none'yesterday to speak of..: In'another'half-hour we have washed the dust from our faccs, and • Bome from our throats, and reached the ;v lawn, already (it is only one o'clock) ' crowded with people,' concerning whom it would: be hard to say•: whether the . splendour of the costumes or the plainness of the ladies who wear them is the most remarkable. Pausing to look up : at our bonnie Princess, the prettiest woman by far, present this Cup .Day of 1876, we do' 1 not fail-to note that 1 she wears -her favourite pale blue, that "her bonnet is perfection/ and that she : is laughihg-wrth all her heart, thereby showing the whitest lows oflittle, even, sparkling teeth. Foraging "for chairs, we discover that a-great -and ^grievous / army of maids and matrons have con^ fiscated'ieyeryone, tiayj"worse, tliey h : the effrontery 1 to. place parasols, -fans -. •• ij^'tilbajla^^^ .up and down, a piece of selfishness we prevent .one doing'the same thing later on in the day, when a few chairs are . abandoned for good. It is a case of sitting on our "thumbs or the .grass, so . • we • select '-the t latter,. and taking f o : i abased. positions with a .tolerably good .grace, open our eyes widely to see all that,3s to be seen. We find that to-day is not as yesterday,~and that fiveout of every-six have ... come I here: witli thedetermination of outdoing -every other woman present, -and sinceallcannot be . first?oreven : : second;- it-is somewhat difficult to decide upon.their .merits, or .whom to fixupon •as the lucky, owner of "The Goodwood Dress.?^,Every imaginable eccentricity * and extravagance in yellow paled before a splendid costume" of ? gold^coloured satin; .wifh flouncesof old yellow-gold ft: ' feathers and silk Among 'the white costumes—-and very fresh and'delicate isome of them wejpe^tbe palm iriiist be . wii liy d Frenchwoman, embossed'and .embroidered superbly iir T^it® «lk,;and looking as if it 'could havecome (in " " "" ' - ' bunches .about it, with trimmings of the -paleat-pirik feathers, makes'aprodigious .sensation, and every one turns to look -^w^o^eliMt-wonMnron J ear£h illidreraed It pu^ia^Tis" torday ^hfere all the beauties of- oiir country -can have got tol They are"'not seated under the "tr^aibehind^u^ and we ^an'^tinguish ^nothii^ Worth the seeking on the drags mis8.the icliarifiing; icpmpilatioii Wiially the'siihny-fafeed blondes 'tod-:"the ''Spark-. ling_bnHiant';* brunettes. 1 We' <K>nfide our disappointment to such of our. male acquain'tance as approach 1 us,.1)iit - they duguste^, consdou's,c no ' .doubt^ ..that Go6dwo^3fl : iot;;aplac^ bipea; man/ A'o^.'.te,.^yaiitage.'In" truth he is as simple.an adjvuict of the ^as^^^are^her^bMteVTandpo^es—^ "dispensable and necessary > but there his value, as a man> ceases, while his f duties as a. machine be^ns.

Betaking ourselves to the luncheonlaid for us under the trees, we meet by the way. ia wonderful toilette of .dustcoloured silk, smothered in really .splendid lace ot the same colour, and are further attracted by a costume of pale green, embroidered ' with brown arid gold,' w-hicli somebody whispers is :" The Goodwood Dress" (if the week.

At present there appeal's to be only confusion, heat, and more dust than ever, but as ; we get aw'ay- fronvtbe mass of carriages, carts, and waggons, arid rattle down over the hill, our spirits rise, we look-out for our Irishman, are as pleased as schoolboys when we discover him, and so with the dust to the right and dust to the left of us, drags .before: gigs behind us, everv known conveyance on earth winding its slow length along behind us, we reach Chichester, catch pur train, arid getting back in time for dinner, -ask aloud, as we have so many times done before, " Does anything we have seen at Goodwood (except the Princess)! compensate e for.the heat, dust, inconvenience, and trouble of'getting there 1"—rGraphic. . ? ?
