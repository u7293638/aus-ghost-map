CONGREGATIONAL UNION. The twenty-seventh annual session of the New South Wales Congregational Union was opened in the Pitt-street Congregational Church last evening, when the annual sermon was preached by the Rev. A J Griffith, of Croydon The church was well filled The preacher took as his text John xiv , part of 17th verse, ' He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you ' He said they would find upon inquiry that the spirit working in the Church through individual members The apostle Paul regarded the Church as composed of individuals, and the Holy Ghost dwelt in the Church because it dwelt in the individual members of the Church The quality and effectiveness of any body of men was elevated when the quality of the separate members was noble and exalted In fronting the difficulties which beset the Church, tile secret of her strength lay in the full recognition of the fact that the Holy Ghost dwelt in the individuals composing the Church here were two elements in our own land which rendered the work of the Church Decuhurly difficult, viz, materialism and secularism That tendency was not altogether surprising in such a land as ours-the land of the golden fleece In their fierce haste after wealth men had been led to forget their dependence upon God Many men and women spent their days in a life as pagan as that of the old Athenians every little township had its racecourse, and the leaders of society patronised instead of discouraging some of the worst amusements of the people The conditions created by our material prosperity and progress presented serious difficulties to the Church of Christ. So also did secularism, through the intellectual culture of the people Everyone could read, and the people b perceptive e faculties had been developed by the very admirable school system which had been established in the land. People took their ideas from the novel and the newspaper Hard study and thinking upon great ethical and spiritual questions excited only a very languid interest It was a very grave matter when the nation developed intelligence, but did not at the same time develop religious principle - when it grew in knowledge but decreased in faith in the face of these obstacles the strength of the Church lay in the realisation of the truth of the text, * He dwelleth in you That was the great counter- acting force to the evils existing in society The people must uphold the Church in her endeavours to impress spiritual truths upon the world People must not demand of the minister that he should preach beautiful, or brilliant, or clover sermons That was not his mission What they should demand of the minister was that he should preach under the direct enlightenment of the Holy Ghost. The insistence upon the three tremendous facts of God the soul and the future world was the mission of the Church under the guidance of the Holy Ghost The Church could also combat the evils of society by preaching contentment Contentment was a leading principle of Christianity A simple, holy spirit of contentment was created by the Holy Spirit in the minds of those in whom it dwelt When the new political economy according to Jesus Christ came to be written it would be found to contain three parts first that men were not to hunger for gain second, that they must be content with moderate means and third, that acquired wealth must be held as a sacred trust, to be expended on behalf of others To the practice of those simple rules the Holy Ghost was gradually leading the members of Christ's Church By the end of next century, if not before, these would be looked upon as the most elementary axioms of Christian conduct A collection was made on behalf of the funds of the union, and after ords the service of the Lord's Supper was observed, the Rev John For dyce M A (the acting chairman), officiating The service of praise was led by the choir of the church at Dulwich Hill
