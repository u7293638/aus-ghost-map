THE UNION OF THE CHURCHES- ' -Â» CANON POTTER'S REPLY TO ARCHBISHOP CARR. Canon Potter delivered a lectures at AU I Saints' Church, St. Kilda, last evening, and titled" Archbishop Carr's Last Words." There was a large congregation. He took as his text Acts, second chapter 42nd verse the) con turned steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship in the breaking of bread and the prayers He Bindango have here summed up in the words of Scripture the marks of the Holy Catholic Church (1) the teaching of the apostles e , the tell tale 1 facts of the Christian milk and the rules of conduct is Inch they imply, (2) the fellow ship of the apostles of the maintenance of the threefold ministr) n inch has been from the apostles time in Christ 's church , (3) the breaking of bread t e , the Holy 1 eucharist, celebrated according to our Lord's own command, and (4) common prayer And I have called your attention to the fact that our mother church, the Church of England exhibits these four marks, and so is part of the Holy Catholic Church Controllers), and I think especially the present controversy has at least one good point about it It can strains us to test our position, and make sure of it. As a correspondent writes to me- It makes us examine our title deeds But control cray has great spiritual dangers attending it. It is apt to be come personal to stir the temper, and to express itself in irritating language Now, let us eschew all this let us not adopt the drum and trumpet style, let us not bluster If anyone bare misquoted either documents or history, let his man presentation be exposed And as for scholarship if it cannot take care of itself it is not worth taking care of A great question like til it now at isauetannot be settled by petty) personal details the question is not whether your antagonist bait neither humour nor learning the question is What can heroic' Now, I do want to keep the Archbishop to the point He touches without answer Borne of my arguments he evades others, and passed by still others in silence lit said that the claim of the Church of England to be the same church as before the Helot relation was not heard of until fifty years and more after 1922 I prove I from documents that it had already been authoritatively made in that len year The Archbishop does not answer I pointed out that Gregory I strongly condemned the title of 'universal bishop ' Gregor) no doubt claimed for him Belt a supreme) n Inch neither the Anglican Church now, nor the primitive churches, would ever have thought of admitting. But he did not of use to Bit by depot) on all the episcopal thrones of Christendom and that is the claim which must be made good for the Popes before the rights of the present Anglican Episcopi he can be denied I line is the claim implied in the title "universal bishop with Gregory condemns Hu archbishops answer is not forthcoming Just so he treats Dr Littledale He Ha) so that Dr Lee discovered 101 errors in Plum Reasons I said, Will the Archbishop gave the particulars of one of those errors and then we can judge' But no, because I might say there was enough left still Well if there was of course Id so) it Surely if one shot In a bus dred fails there are still meet) same to be accounted for when says the Archbishop again Father Ryder confused Dr Littledale Well 111 show presently some thing of Father Hydery quality as a reasoner 'His Archbishop gets very angry about " the Italian mission and he talks a little girl) about 'felons docks and Ines in danger ' No doubt there was a great deal of bad language talked at the time, and I am not going to do and it And no doubt there was a miscarriage of justice in the case of Dr Newman but the Archbishop himself admits that a new as it was ordered And it is really quite ridiculous to go into hysterics atthis time of day over the stupid spreudtogltism with which John Bull liberated his temper when he sic! and ot lies just ' no Pope's fever lit more than 16 years ago 'The Arch bishop sn)sihttt 1 bare hills back on the temperance argument I expressly declined to build any argument for spiritual Status on the undisturbed possession at the temporalities I proved from it a corporate continual) And 1 proud the spiritual ton must) be) quite adherent rule of argument I showe i that we held the same line of faith and conduct as the primitive church and the same orders of the apostolic ministry The Archbishop says after Sir William Harcourt that the county of the Church of 1 England is like the continuity of an in t. with a fine head and knew handle But than proved that we have both the old handle and the old head and so the 1er) same car axe with the dust and mud rubbed off it The Archbishop professes to give the Anglican orchard a somewhat lengthened examination but he begins by) making discovery, which if it be genuine man is all further examination quite unnecessary) Ills discovery is that Cranmer was the chief author of tin Anglican ordinal Units easily) tested You have your proper books in the- bands Now, the essence of the ordinary, that on which its whole salient depends is as follows -for the ordering of priests the bishop and the priests present lay hands on the head of the person to be or Jaiucil, and the bishop says - 'Receive the Holy Ghost whose wings then (lost forgive they are formers and those same thou dost retain they are retained And for the consecration of bishops the consecrating bishop and at least two other bishops lay their hands on the bend of the bishop elect, and the consecrating bishop sn) s - Keech of the Holy Ghost and remember that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee by the high position of halls for foci hath not often as the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of other news Now, that is the essence of the ordinary, and, used very will know, these are the secrets of our Lord Jesus Christ and of St Paul His apostle and they are written in St. John xx 22, and in 2 Tim i 0 7 And yet the Archbishop says that Cranmer as the chief author of the ordinal The Archbishop goes on to quote several private opinions which he attributes to Anglican writers It would be sheer loss of time to examine these opinions 1 he) mostly concern the question, XX hit would Christians have to do It orders were extinct' But as orders have not be come extinct, that is entirely a theoretical question And besides we are none of us bound, whether Doman or Anglican II men's private opinions What concerns us is that what was actually done And we know that what was done was this-that Parker was validly consecrated, and that Christ and His apostle (and not Cranmer) were the authors of the words of consecration But the Archbishop wiilpirhapaanswer, Oh burthensome did not intend to toiiBicrate and so the consecration has invited Well I am much) for him there, and I will answer him not in my own words but in the words of a distinguished member of his own church The Abbe Duchesne is amongst the foremost of French ecclesiastics, and he has lately written a criticism of a tract by another Roman writer on Anglican orders The Abbe Duchesne says The author of II c tract her as h) demonstrating that Iarliir a d Harlow from who is the Anglican cleric) derive their orders were really consecrated li crop or at the least that there is no good reason for dont time their consecration And on the other hand the r Ulai of the 1 flush Church is enhilan tially the canvas the ritual of the Greek Church and I even of the landing church up to the t 19th century) It follows that the orders of the l Ministers of the English Church are just as good as those of the Lather clerk.) of primitive and early t incidental times The author of the tract which the Abbe criticiBis raises this very question of men lion and this is the Abbey answer -a 1 IT you tell me that such and such a prelate, or even li o I relish Church itself has taught clear es which differ from those which are involved in the Roman Church I read it that those things have little to do with intention ' ' English coronations he goes on to say, " have uhvaiB bicniidminiBttrcd by persons who wished to make bishops and priests and BO on more we must not ask for 'Hu Alibi concludes that 1 English ordinary build saw Archbishop Carr did me the honour to introduce me to Dr Child and Mr Pocock, and he think a I do but suffering appreciate the honour Will one good turn deserves another so be mil p unit me to introduce him to the Abbe Duclusni And I sent to say that he is a hum better worth knowing than Dr Child and Mr Pocock rolled into one But he ii had not come down so far in time as the Abbe Duebisne for a Bonum admission of the sale list) of Anglican orders A core spend lit a fire to a passage in Hook s z y of J'ole and 1 June cure fully invited Ina re. len net There are learn that one Store lifts but in consecrated a bishop by the English ordinal, and that Bonner, in Queen Mary's time natur him to the exercise of his office without any riiotiBccrution And Pope 1 plan III in the same reign a IdrisRcel a brief to Cardinal Pole directing him to restore tin 1 English bishops who might set out to Home to the use of the gift of loans credits abroad) bestowed upon them boil until 1901 when the 1 English ordinal had been our 150 years in use, is there any more of such reconsecration The Archbishop proceeds to allege that Grannie r n IIB It had must Nutt, I am not going to whitewash Crinum r In mia neither saint nor here but I want to know what has that to do with the matter DOCB the Archbishop wish to show hatred) that we had a bad bishops in the Church of England, or does he rather wish us to understand that a bad bishop On churches A church? father line is a very delicate one for a KOUUMI coulroverstoUst to take Did the Archbishop never hear of one Uorlerio Borgia, after and Pope Alexander VI for of one Balthasar Cossu afterward Pope John XXIII I Or did he ever read him Hnronius on the Popes of the tenth century?
