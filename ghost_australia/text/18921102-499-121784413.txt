SAILING NOTES. DOUBLE B*Y BEGATTA. (Bl ' BiCZSTlT.') This reggatta is always the first aquatic ' event of the season, taking place on. the last Saturday in Ootober, whioh wae the 29th nit,, dud . every thinB went off well, and anothdr most successful day has been added to, .tho lone list of regattas held in Double Bay. This, i.s greatly due to the energies of tEe hbii. me-.-. Mr. Goorge Hollings, and hpn. treasurer; Mr. F.- C. Katbn, who worked very llRFd to' make, it the success it was. The committee also was a very influential one, who, oiie find all, gave their help to the affair. The officers were :— Sailing races : Starter, Mr. E. Oatley ; jndires, Messrs. H. C. Stookham aiid E. F; ..Tones. KdvVing races: Starter, Mr. J. H. Myers; judge, Mr. W. Woods; umpire, Mr. John Blaokma'h. It is needless to say that these' gentlemen carried oiit their respective duties in a most satisfactory manner. The day was . all that could bo desired, except that perhaps' tho light easterly breeze which was blowing waS not quite strong enough for the Hailing faces, but suitod tho pulling fraternity nicely. Until lnBt year's regatta hard breezes' were the order of the day, generally from tho north- east, which quarter Double Bay is mnali exposed. Last year the wind was from nearly the same quarter as it wa3 on Saturday, but unfortunately did not last as long, tile consequence boiug that several of tho sailing races were hot (hiisuod: The fine steamer New castle was placed at tho committeo's disposal for a flagship, and a right good one she made'; ami Captain Skinner and his officers did all they1 could for the visitor*. She was moored niucli further up the bay than heretofore. .The Centennial Band, under Baudinaater Vas'sie, added in no small degree to the atrfu8binfent of the afternoon. The South Shoro Steam Ferry Company conveyed the visitors from Circular Quay, running at frequent in tervals, anil each trip being well filled. Several people woro left on Elizabeth Bay'nnd Darling Point wharves tMough ttie steamer not eaTlin*, although advertised to (to so. Another steamer waa kept constantly em ployed conveying passenger's fromtlje Double Bay wharf, whilst a well-tilled steamer foli lowed eaoh of tho rowing races, which woro well contested. An unfortunate ..error crept into the report in the Sunday TiMK'a, when it waa stated that tho Tub Kjicq.was won by W. .Stauuard, whereas, it should havo been J. Heliings, who Banllod a .very. {food race from start to finish. It is to be regretted that noyaohts entered for tlie Yaol|t JCaco. This certainly docs not look like much advance ment in yachting. In tho race for 2 i raters only the Norna entered, but tbo Louelle came forward later on, but after the programme had been tixed, bo it was agreed that these two yachts were to have a private race, under the auspices of the regatta committee, which resulted, in a very tume affair, tlie Norna. beating her opponent by about iif teen minutes, the liouoilo not carrying .suinqiont sail for the light day. There was also another race that fell.through, viz., that for residents of I'ad: dinRton and Woollahra, in lona-jide watermen skiffs;, double soulla, tho only entry being Messrs. T. Strettlos and W. Stanuard. The prizes, wpre good audAiumerous, several races liayine four prizes allotted to. them.
