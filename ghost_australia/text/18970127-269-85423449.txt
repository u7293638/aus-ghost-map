PlAIRT TV. , I told Philip the next morning. There was no need to 'bespeak his at tention- I think he felt as nearly as .horrified as I had done anyself at the jufea that .our ,own MtherEo foright, cheerf ul home was to <be haunted' by $b&a; awM ttMug-Influence or presence, <Mi it what you w;il. And the sugges tions, which I on to make, struct him, too, with a sense of relief. He sat in silence for some time after making me recapitulate as precisely as possible every dei'ali- ol. Sqptiy's etory *'You are sure it was the door into the Library Lc said, at last. "Quite sutiv' I replied, "and, oh, Phalip," I went on, "it has just occur red to me that i'aiher felt a ehiJl .there the other evening." For tilil that <momenit the little in cident in question had escaped my memory* 'Do you re»Dj ember which of thg. portieres hung hi front of 'tbeMl^r* at Finster ?" said I shook jasr*liead. n r -SPowffv^ would.'* I said, "he used to "examine the pictures in the tapestry wlffch great interest. I should not know one f rom the other. There is an old <castde in the distance in each, and a lot off trees, asd something meant for a iake." iBut to diis turn Phiifp shook his head. ^No," he said, "I won't speak to Dorany aJbour it if I can possilbly help it. Leave it to me, Leila, and try to put it out of your, our <mind as onuoh as you possibly can, and don't be sur prised a.t any t il ing you may notice in tthe next few days. I waM -tell you, first of anyone, whenever I have any thing -to 'teil." That was aCl I could get out of him. So I tools his advice. Luckily, as k tunned out, Mr Miles, tthe only outeider, so to say {exjceg»fc the unfortunate keeper), wiho had witness ed the ghostly drama, was one of the shooting' fixi-iiy expected that day Amd him PhiC p at once determined to consult sibGiii this new and utterly unexpected 'manifestation. He did not leil me this. Indeed, it was not tiX fully a week later that I heard any;t3i:ng, and fhen in a letter a very long letter from my ^brother, which I think, will reuate 'the sequel of our strange ghost story better uian any narration at second-Jsamd of -my own. Mr Miles oa-Iy stayed two nights with us. The very day after he caane lie announced that, to (his great regret, he was obliged-most unexpectedly-to return to Raxtrew on important busi ness. "And,1' l:e r -nuued, *1 am aifHaid you wiSl all fr-;" :i:i!C-h more vexed with me when I tell you I am going to carry off Phil witb me." Father was, looking blank indeed. "Phil J" exclaimed. "and how aibout our shooting ?" "You can easily replace us," said my 'bwther, "I have thought of that," and he added something1 in a. lower tone to father. He-Phil-was leaving *t'he room- at the .time. I thought it had reference to the real reason of Ms accompanying1 Mr AHiles, -but I was mistaken. Father, however, said noth ing 'more in opposition to the plan, and the .next momng the two went off. We happened to "be standing1 at the hall door-^several of us-for we 'were a large party now-when PJiiil and h5s friend drove awa^. 'As we turned to re-enter the 'house,. I «felt someone touch me. It was £&:*vhy-. »She was going oat for s . ? -i . ? agonal with Mass Larpent, but k,u stopped a moment to speak to me. "Leila," she s^jd to a whisper, "why have #hey-did you know that the tapestry has 'been taken down Ty .She ©Lameed at me with a peculiar expression. I <had not observed it. Now, looting r?p, I saw that the two looked doors were vi&Me; m 'the dark polish of th^ o'd mahogany as of yore-no longer shrouded <by the an cient pm^ariOT-*,*T*^^rfed in surprise. ****$&, [whispered in return, "I did not know. .Never mind, iSophy. I sus pect there is a reason (for it which we shall know in good time." I felt strongly tesmjpted-the moon being still at the fuil-to visit the hall that night-iii the hopes of seeing 'nothing.' IBut when the time drew near, my courage failed ; besides I had fcaicitily promised PiMlip to think as Jittle as I possibly could about the mat ter, and any vigil of the kind would certsfSnCy -not have been aicting 3a ac eordiance with the spirit of his sadjviee. I think I will now "copy as it stands the letter foom Philip which I received a week or so later. It was dated from his club in .London , ^My dear T/eiia,-I have a, long-story to fceli you and a vety extraordinary one. I think it is well ith&t; it (should be put inito writing, so I .wdlsl devote this evening to the task--especially as I shai£ most be home for ten days or so. "You. onlay have suspected thiat I took Miles into my confidence as soon as he arrived. If you did- you were right. He was the best pertson to speak to for several reasons. He looked, I must say, rather-well '"bCiank" scarcely ex presses it-when I told him of the ghost's re-appearance, not only at the Rectory, -but iu our own; house, and on both occasions to persons-<N&t; and then Sophy-who had not {heard a breath of the story, ©at when I went on to propound your suggestion, MEes cheered up. He .had1 been, I fancy, a trifle touchy about our caffiing Finster haunted, and it was evidently a satis faction to him to start another theory. We talked it well over, and' we de cided to test the thing agaiOr-at took some resolution, I awn, to do so. We sat up that night-bright moonMght luckily-and-well, I needn't repeat it all. Sophy was quite correct}- It came again-the horrid creeping ftfoaxiow poor wretch. I'm ra42ier sorry for it now-just in the odd way: quite as much at home in shire, apparently, as iii the Castile. It stopped at the closed library door, and fumbled away, then1 started off again-JUgh"! We watched it closely, but kept well' in the 'middle of the room, so * that the cold did not strike us so badly. We both noted the special part of the tapestry -where its hands seemed .to sprawl, and' meant to stay ifor another roiund-but -when, it Game to the point we f unked It, and-went to bed. Next tmominig, on pretence oif exam ining the date >f the tapestry, we ted it down-you were ell out-audi we foiind-vTost wher^ the bands felt afaoat, -there had foeeai a cot -Miree cots, three sides of a square, as It were, making a sotit of door in the stuff, tli© fourth side ieayamg ev&denibly; acted as a hinge, for there was a mark wihere it had (beens folded foack.

The tapestry 'had Ibeen used to eosoiceal a small door in <febe -wall -the door of <a secret ^u$&6ardi prolb abdy. Tflie ghostly fingers had fceen vainly seeking for the spring wiMoh in the days of ft&eir; flesh and- b«ne U&ey; had "been aiceustomed tx> ppese! "The first 4Miigr to do," salft 'Miles, "is to Cook up Hunter and make ham teJl1 where ;he get the tapestry from. Then we jshaill see." ISihall we take the {portiere with us?" I said' (But IMdSes shuddered, 'though he ihaJf laughed too. "No, thank you," he said._ "I'an not going to <tiravel with the evil tblnig." .We -can't hang It up a^am, fchoug,Ji," I said, '"after tbils last experience." In- (the end we rolled1 up the two portieres, not to attract attention by onily -moviing one, and-weli, I thought at just possffibUe the gi&ost; anight imate a mistake, and II did not want any more scares wh§le I <wa® away-we rolled' them up together, first <eiarefiuiUly meas uring -the cut, and ats position in the curtain^ and then we hid them aiway in one of the Cofts thaifc no owe ever enters, where they are at this moment, and where the ghost anay have toeen da spotting! ihiimse^; for all I tonotw, though 1'Gancy the 'has given it <up by this time, for reasons you shall hear. Then tMflles and I, as yon know, set off for RjaKtrew. I smoothed my father dowo shout at, by reminding! hlan how good-natured tfhey had* been to us, and teiMing him Males really needed; me. We went stoaight to Hunter. He hummed' and: hawed a good deal-he 'had not distinctly prom ised to give the name of the place the tapestry 'had come from, but he knew the gentleman he had .bought it from did not want it known. <eWihy ?" said Mfiles .. "Is it some family that has come in the world, and is forced1 to past with things to get some ready money T' "Oh dear no," said Hunter. "It is not that, at all. It was only that-I suppose I mufet give you- the name Captain iDevereux^-dad not want'any gossip to get affront, as to*-" "Devereux 1" repeated Miles, "you don't mean the twv»>!p Mikgw ?" ^The same," said Hunter. "'If you know them, sir, you wall be careftH, I hon* to assure the Obtain that I did my best to carry out Ms wishes?" "Certainly," said Males, l'H exont . erate you."* - And' then Humter told us that D^veT eux, who only came onto the Hallsnger property a few years ago, had been much^aneoyed by stories getting about of the place being haunted, and' thin had led to 'his dim&ntling;: one wing, B^artfer though^ but wa$ quite clear as io this-gulling down senate rooms altogether. <But he, Dev ereux, "was very touchy on the subject -he-did aot want tobelaughed at., "And the tapestry csame from. 'Ham you arecertain as itothat ?" Miles re pealed. "Positive, sir. I took it down with my own hands. IS; was fitted otn to two panels in wihat they caM the round room at jEDaMoger-tihere were, oh, I daresay a dozen of them with tapestry nailed on, bints I only bought these two pieces-the otihers were soM to a 1km dom dealer." "The -roundi room," I said. Ijeola, the expression struck me. .Mes, it appeared, knew Devereux fairly 'weCS. tfailffinger is only tea miles off. We drove over there, but found lie was b London. So oar next move was .to follow 4iim there. We called twice eut bis .dub, and then Miles made am appointment, saying that he wamted to see him' om private business. Ho received us civilJy of course. He is &> quite young:. feilow-An the Guards . D^ut when Miles began 4o ex plain to Mm what we had come aibout, fee stiffened.

'""Wiait a mbmeut," said "Mules, and as he went om I saw that Devereux changed. «H$s fa<ce grew intent -with interest and sa queer sort of eagerness and at Ja&t; vhe started to Ms feet. "Upon iny soul," he said, "I be lieve you've run Mm to earth for me -the ghost I mean, and' If so, you shall have my endCess gratitude.

It appeared that on succeeding! to HaH linger, on the death of an miide, young Devereux «had' made consideraMe changes iiL the house. ;He htad aimwng othot things, opened out a small wing -a. sont of round tower-which had tbeen completely (dism antled amd brick ed up for, I thwife he said; over a hund red years.
