TUESDAY, SE1"IEMBE1H, 1883. The debate on the Public Service Bill will be commenced in the Legislative Assembly to-day, and notwithstanding the importance of the subject' there is no reason why the discussion should extend over any great length of time. The principle of the measure will, we apprehend, be as heartily accepted by the House as it is by the country, and under these circumstances the real work is to be done in committee, where such modifications as consideration may show to be necessary can be made. The practice which leads to the greatest waste of time of all in our Legislature is that of one set of members after another rising, not to throw any new light on the issue, but to express their own personal views, and to indulge in a vain repetition of what has been said before them. But when the ideas and the objections of a member have been fully stated, his views are sufficiently expressed by his vote. After the experience of the Mallee Bill, when hours were spent in useless reiteration, it is as well to remind the House that a close, practical, business procedure is necessary if the session is to have its expected brilliant results. More particularly is this the case also if, as appears probable, the sitting will have to be broken into by an adjournment for the purposes of the Federal Convention. It is all very well for dilatory members, such as Mr. ANGUS 'MACKAY, to plead piteously that too much work is being crowded in the period. The hon. member must have forgotten, in a long sleep at Sydney, that the subjects before the Houses have been discussed and considered for years. The crop is ripe, and what is now needed is despatch in gathering in the harvest. The M'Coll, the Mirams, and the Major Smith contingent will probably once more lift up their voices and weep because patronage is to be abolished. They will prophesy that something still worse will befall the service than political administration. The great point is that nothing worse can befall the country- that so far as the community is concerned any change must be for the better. We need not be surprised if to a certain extent the scheme should prove to be unpopular with the public service as it exists to-day, for we must remember that the service has been formed on a political basis, and doubtless there are numbers of individuals who would far rather take their chance with a Minister than see promotion made a matter of rigorous test and examination and scrutiny by a board. The change in Great Britain, which transferred the departments from the politicians who had friends to serve to commissioners who had the efficiency of the service at heart, was not made without the most strenuous opposition from the ranks. The reform was effected not from within but from without. We say this merely that too much importance may not be attached to any complaints from the offices. On the other hand, we would be the first to admit that men have a right to be distrustful and anxious about a change in their tenure of office; that whatever the civil, servants have to say is entitled to patient consideration, and.thatilho ,utmpstj_are should bo.taken,..D do no . injustice to the present; occupants of office, and to arrange Brim satisfactory future, theThe amendments should be proposed in a friendly spirit, recognising that, in settling the terms, Ministers desire to hold the scales fairly between the service and the country, and they should not be so stated as to strengthen any opposition to the bill itself. While insisting strongly that it would be infinitely better to carry the bill as a whole as it now stands, rather than weaken its central principle that politicians shall have nothing to do with the service, we may admit that there are many details affecting the country little and the officers much where changes and modification appear to be necessary. In the first place, there is the question of appeal. The com- mission! is are required to reclassify the work of the service. Two of them constitute a quorum, and the senior member has a casting vote, and so, it is urged, an officer's work maybe wrongly estimated by the one man. Of course, if tho value of the work is under- estimated it does not follow that the officer would lose grade. He is to be offered a position equivalent to the salary he is receiving; but still there seems to be a general feeling in the departments that the power is too great to be conferred upon an individual. We would submit that the sting would be taken out of the clause in question if the classifica- tion were always made by the full board, and if the following provision were omitted-" but if the board be " unable to transfer such officer " Lin salary shall be reduced to the " maximum of the class to which he is " office shall have been assigned, and the shall receive as compensation a * Bum amounting to one-twelfth of such " reduction for each year of service " If this proviso were struck out, the present occupant of a reduced office would retain both his post and his salary until proper employment could be provided for him, and we apprehend that in that case very few individuals would care about an appeal for the sake of the status of their post, however much they might desire to go from authority to authority as regards themselves Work, it must be borne in mind, requires to be classified as a whole In personal issues, however, an appeal is usually desirable thus with the provision that the certificate of the head of the department shall be necessary when an officer is promoted, and a certificate of good behaviour shall be required to entitle the other to his in siemens Such a check upon misconduct and idleness is very necessary But the head may be prejudiced or per verse, and when the certificate is refused, an appeal may well be to the commissioner s It is urged, also, and with considerable feeling, that the proposed scale of payment is insufficient, but much of this criticism is based upon one 'line calculation is that a man must be 56 before he can work his way up to ¿tvbOO per annum, but the assumption is that each officer must earn each increment, and must remain in the various classes in turn until by the lapse of time he has reached the maximum salary Not only does the bill say nothing of the sort, but it sa) S the -\ city opposite, so that we fear the gentlemen who have advanced this argi|ttjt)PÍfj V could fail in a competitive examination about the measure It is laid down in a dozen passages that " pfóhfotlon is to be by seniority and " merit combined," and the coming Bionersaieto frame regulations for discussion in Parliament, stating how ments to be ascertained And promotion from the third class into the higher and well paid grades is by competitive examination, to test the business qualities of the third class candidates Thus a clever man may be in the fourth class long before he is 30, and may reach the top appointments by middle ago There appears to be some hardship, however, as regards the third class instead of six inches events of £25 per annum as at present, the proposal is to spread an inclement of id 10, or £10 less, over 19 years, and if should be easy to effect a compromise between these two extremes Certain amendments in the Audit Act are proposed by clause 2 Without reference to the merits of these changes and the propriety of one of them at least is doubtful-it may be urged that a bill to repeal the Civil Service Act should not be used to vary the statute providing for the issue of the public money Other details might be mentioned We are sure, however, the country will endorse the statement that as a whole the bill is most acceptable, and that the duty of the Assembly is to limit the strike second reading discussion as much as possible, and to ended vour to perfect in committee what may fairly be called a great measure As it is possible that the Railway Management Bill may be reported in the Legislative Council this afternoon, and be recommitted for the consideration of the postponed clauses, we think it desirable to say a few words as to the views expressed with regard to the proposed commissioners and their tenure of office the Government originally in tended that these gentlemen should stand on a footing of equality, and that all questions should be determined by a majority of votes It was soon soon, however, that it would be something in the nature of an absurdity to import an experienced chairman from England at a heavy expense, and then to render him liable to have his judgment can usually overruled by his less accom plished colleagues An amendment was therefore submitted by Mr GILLIES providing that whenever the chairman may differ from the other two commis 3101101 s with respect to any matter awaiting decision " Suth matter shall be determined according to the deliberate judgment of the chairman, irrespective of the decision of the other two commissioners, and the chairman shall in all such cases enter upon the minutes of the proceedings of the commissioners his 'disons at length for deciding such matter in opposition to the other two commissioners, and shall forward to the Minister a true copy of such minute, certified under his hand, for presentation to Parliament, ' We regard this as a very proper and sensible au angement Mr ZEAL thinks that some alteration is necessary to prevent those collisions occurring between the than man and his two brothers commissioners, which Dr DOBSON prophesies will frequently happen It would be a great mistake, however, to attempt to lay down hard and fast lines to regulate the relations between the chairman and the other members of the board We may assume that the gentlemen appointed will not be deficient in common sense and business qualifications in which case they will soon discover A modus vivendi for themselves. The fact of their not doing so would argnd smell a want of fitness for high office as to warrant the removal of those Hvho, on investigation, might be found in fault There is no reason to suppose that the commissioners will seek occasion to disagree Ilion comfort and interest will be best served by the maintenance of amicable relations, and the conduct of the business with as little faction as possible The chairman will be inclined to moderation by the thought that he cannot ever rule, his colleagues without having his conduct reviewed in Parliament, while the sub oiilinatocoiiimissioneis will be deterred from factious opposition by the knowledge of a power in reserve which at any moment could neutralise their machinations We believe that Mr &AUC001;) took a rational view of the probable situation when he said - In the management of large financial in stitutions it was not found that any serious differences of opinion occurred and although a just instit arise in which the overruling power confers td by the bill might be ever existed it did not think that instances of this kind would frequently occur, or that when they did they would be very detrimental to the public service. After considering the subject in all its bearings, we have come to the conclusion that it would be a great mistake to meddle with the settlement effected in the Lower House In commenting on the tenure of office which the biHjiroposes to confer on the commissioners, Mr ZKAA sag gashed an aviation which is deserving of notice According to clause 8 they are to be a pointed for a term of SON on years, and to be eligible for reappoint spirit if. the end of that time Mr ZIAL "considers that it would be better to - anoint on probation for a shorter term and in the event of the gentlemen selected proving suitable to let the reappointment give possession during good behaviour Considered in the abstract, this would be an admirable arrangement, but it appears to us that the practical difficulties it would create ought to prevent its adoption Notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, we feel convinced that we shall not obtain the ideal chairman we desire on the conditions prescribed by the Assembly But if we cannot hope for a first-class man under a seven years' tenure, -what likelihood would there be of our obtaining such an officer for a term of one or two years,. It will take time to re- arrange the department, to bring it into working order, to over come obst action, and to make the employs, understand that they are the servants, and not the masters, of the public Vast establishments cannot be reformed in a day, and even when they have been set in order, it may take years before the results of improved organisation and management become plainly apparent If commissioners were appointed on the, thur turn of probation would probably expire while matters were in a transition state, and before an impatient public always given to expect miracles and to underrate the difficulties of administration had had time to recognise the advantages of their rule Any suitable man to whom we may offer the situation of chairman will have to give up very good prospects at home in order to take it, and is it reasonable to suppose that any first-class officer would make the necessary seen (ice if his chance of reappointment after, say, two years' work depended on a proper appreciation of services which were only in the process of bearing fruit . Instead of shortening the proposed tenure, the Council would do well to amend it in an opposite direction for our own part, we should be quite satisfied to make the appointments permanent-i e, tenable during good behaviour in the first instance, as we consider that the means provided of getting rid of incapable Or Refractory commissioners are ample for all practical purposes We fear however, that such an alteration would not be favour ably regarded by the Assembly, and therefore we would suggest that " ten" be substituted for "seven, ' as the number of years during which appointments shall hold good Mr SARGOOD, on behalf of the Government, has told us that the seven years' teams is approved by eminent railway men in England, but we do not attach much significance to this fact Their approval has, doubtless, been given on the supposition that railway affairs in this country are conducted in a great measure on lines such as those followed by the great commercial companies at home We who are familiar with the evils and disturbing in fluences inseparable from political interference, know how far this is from being the ti util, and know more over, the exact value of conclusions drawn from such erroneous premisses We may be told, however, that the agent-general has been communicated with, and he has assured the Cabinet that for a salary of £3,000 per annum for a term of seven years it can get the man it wants But what sort of man does it want. Does it want the same class of man as the country wants 1 We must say we have grave doubts on this point "The managers of the large English railways said Mr Sargood, who are paid much larger salaries have to devise means for securing traffic at the expense of mail companies and have to employ special powers in other directions which will not be required in the management of the state railways of Victoria. This statement seems to indicate a complete misapprehension of the subject dealt with The English managers are first class men all round, and the fact that their attention is given to special branches of their duty, results from the peculiarities of the traffic they control But the natural qualifications and general training which give them a mastery over the difficulties by which they are immediately confronted, would prove equally valuable under other conditions The principal matters in connection with our railway administration may differ considerably from those which claim attention in England, but though dissimilar they are not less troublesome or embarassing In both cases first class talent only can produce the best results, and it is evident, we submit, that the Government contemplates the engagement of a gentleman only competent to fill a third or fourth rate posit ion Such a proceeding would be a fatal mistake, as the new system might be thereby discredited This is a substantial danger which the Council should do its utmost to avert What the public has road in the papers with regard to the New market collision should str lengthen the deal and for a full and independent inquiry into the bl -to issue the community has a right to expect an official st<itoiiieiit of how it was that the continuous brakes in UBU failed to avert a collision though the train was travelling at a low speed and though the guard was aware of the danger 350 yards from the scene of the collision, and the driver saw the obstacle when 30 yards way No doubt the primary cause of the accident was the tyranny of the passenger train on to the wrong line, but the very use of a continuous brake is to compensate for carelessness of this kind And, assuredly, with a first class brake the driver could have stopped his engine before running into the cattle trucks and the guard could be of brought the train to a standstill 300 yards from. the scene of the disaster HUB it will be seen is a test case Mr W oons himself is interested in having the question aiiBwoied- how was it that under shell Simple circumstances the brake was practically inoperative The statement of the guard as first published brought into notice one of the alleged defects of the brake, namely, that it cannot be swiftly applied from the rear The engine driver is now a edited with in explanation which rex calls the operation of a second inherent and radical defect in the bl like The apparatus loses power enormously with cull application, the reservoir from which the force is supplied requiring to be replenished by the engine pump before power is to acquit 'the driver alleges, It seems, that having to stop twice immediately before the collision, the brake power, so to Speak, had run out, and as sufficient time had not olupuod to enable him to pump up the pressure, he was practically powerless when the cases occurred This fault in the construction of the brake has been pointed out frequently, and We are now told that the defect came into play, and thus the second chance of averting the collision was lost First the guard found himself powerless, and then the driver The driver s statement is in effect that at the trial moment he had not a continuous brake at his com main but an apology for one We do in seek to prejudge the ISSUE, but we do urge -that the public is entitled to the truth and it will be a poor thing if, in order to smooth matters for a politician, the Government is content with prosecuting the signalman, and does not also inquire into the failure of the brake to perform an important, but a simple and easy task The Acclimatisation Society, it appears, has recommended to the Chief Secretary the imposition of a gun tax The objects of the society in making this recommends-. tion are patent enough Not only are the British song-birds introduced by the society ruthlessly destroyed at present by bands of thoughtless, holiday-making hobbledehoys, but useful birds and legitimate g uno are similarly slaughtered in season and out of season Added to this, a very large number of accidents is directly traceable to the use of firearms by those who either do not understand them, or who are dangerously careless in the use of them A gun tax would go a long way towards remedying those ox is Genuine sportsmen will thereforeappioxo of it. The proposal to institute a close season for Bingo is, however, a different matter. Though conceived in a proper spirit, the Acehniu.iMtion society has acted wisely in postponing the matter until fuller information on the habits of the ship is at hand All we know at present about this delicious migratory bud is that it visits us about the beginning of September, and dis appears shortly after Christmas Where it goes no one has yet been able to tell us with accuracy Unlike the quill, however, it does not come to this country to breed, and therefore at first sight it would seem to need no protection at our hands If it could be shown that a good season for snipe followed that in which few xx are killed and few sold in the market, there would be some justification for the establishment of a close season The experience of sportsmen is. however, that no explanation has yet been given which satisfactorily accounts for < good or a bad sugar season That the birds are not now as plentiful as they used to be, is in a large degree attribut- able to the rapid destruction of their feeding gi omits under the various drain- age processes to which farmers and selectors resort to utilise the swamps on their holdings. The third proposal of the society is to establish a close season for blackfish from September to January. We presume that this proposal is made in accordance with well ascertained facts con- trolling the spawning season of these delicate native fish If so, it might, if adopted, operate beneficially, but there would be almost insurmountable difficulties in the way of carrying out the regulation Black- fish have almost entirely disappeared from the Lower Yarra, t s , below Dight's Falls, but they abound in all up-country streams, and especially in the tributaries to the Yarra One of the chief causes assigned by anglers for the partial extinction of this fish is the acclimatisation of the Murray cod in the Yarra This voracious fish was introduced to the Yarra some 15 years ago. It has increased amazingly, and is reputed to live largely on black- fish The cod can now be caught in the river at all stages from 2in in length to 10lb xv eight If, then, the appear ance of the blackfish is due to the presence of the cod, no close season can ward off the ultimate extinction in the river of the defenceless creature. It is a mere matter of time There are seven orders of the day on the notice paper of the Legislative Council for this afternoon, not more than three of which are likely to be called on The principal measure is the Railways Management Bill, which will be further considered in committee In the Legislative Assembly, after questions have been answered, precedent will be given to the Public Service Bill, the second reading of which will be formally moved by Mr Service Mr Mirams is to ask the Minister of Rail ways when he will be in a position to give further information respect- to the Kensington hill purchase 'the draft report of the chairman of the Tanti Commission, Mr James Minims, M.L.A., will be formally submitted to the members of that body on '1 Tuesday next. It was the original intention of Mr Mirams to have submitted the report to the commission direct before publishing it, but his experience in connexion with the stock tax report want to show that it is hopeless to expect privacy where 21 printed copies are " confidentially " circulated amongst members Mr Mirams has arranged for copies of the draft report being supplied to the public by Mr. M L Hutchinson, of Collins street, and Messrs. Dunn and Collins, Bourke street west A misapprehension has arisen as to the nature of the alteration in the duty on imported ale and stout recommended in the draft report prepared by Mr Mirams, the chairman of the Tariff Commission An increase from is 6d to 3s a dozen on quart bottles, and from 9d to is 9d on ports, is apparently proposed, but the recommendation has to be read in conjunction with the modification suggested in the duty imposed on bottles, and it has also to be explained that the object in view is to oblige the trade to import are in full sized quarter pint bottles, instead of in reputed "quarts and pints, continuing only two thirds of the quantity they profess to hold Bottles containing beer will pay duty us here before in the interests of protection, but the Special impost will be included in the ordinary customs tax on fermented liquor. On beer imported in imperial quarts and pints, the duty per gallon would be the same as at present, but on " reputed " measures it would be much higher On empty bottles an impost of 20 per cent is proposed Mr Mirams has favoured us with the means of making the above explanation in regard to his report On Saturday morning a tram precisely similar to that which run into a cattle train at New market on Tuesday last was subjected to a number of tests on the line between the Newmarket station and the point of col liston The tram consisted of a tank engine, two four wheeled carriages, an American bogie carriage, and a four wheeled break-van The distance between the Newmarket station and the point of collision IS 145ft, and the distance at which Shunter Dickin son stood from the cattle tram on the night of the collision, when he gave the danger signal to the Essendon turn, was 72ft The principal trials on Saturday were made for the purpose of ascertaining within what space the train could be pulled up by the brake In the first of these trials, the tram was brought to a standstill within a space of lSUft In the second, the train was pulled up in 1926, and in the third 18 ft, all considerably within the distance from which the danger signal was given The tram on cause occasion, travelled at a speed of between 15 and 20 miles per hour The work in connection with the new boilers to the Cerberus will be sufficiently far advanced in about 10 days to enable her to be removed from the south x. wharf to the buy The operations will be continued at her moorings, and it is likely that she will then be docked to have her overhaul completed An arrangement has been made by the Public Works department with the owners of alienated low lying lands on the south bank of the Yarra, whereby they will take over the Govtrninuit plant now being used in distributing silt They will I employ it in reclaiming the land they have purchased, and they will take over the labourers now working for the department The Government auditors under the Local Government Act were appointed at a meeting of the Executive Council yesterday afternoon They numbered 01, a reduction of 17 on the number of last year, and in selecting them the Commissioner of Public Works first took all who had performed the work satisfactorily for three consecutive years ; then those who had been engaged during the last two years, and then those who were appointed for the first time last year By that means he selected 00, and had only to take one tram the new applicants.
