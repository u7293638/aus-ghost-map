Cora's Treachery:/'V- ' a \ '-.v -i 1 or a moment 1 gave myselt up as lost; 1 remembered how the black waters of the gulf coiled and circled, and knew that there must be some strong current underneath; remembered, too/how; the stick I had thrown into it had disappeared from sight, and felt that there could be no hope for me.. But this was only for, a moment. I was a strong swimmer and had: been accustomed to the water all my life. After-all/ "Hell's Mouth" wasnot Very wide, and-I hoped I should be able to grasp the edge of the rocks and thus save • myself. . Then 1, remembered that Cap'n Jack and, his followers would,, if possible; keep, me .from ever escaping if ..if were in their power sotodo. rI had in a moment destroyed . their hopes of ,eyer getting Granfer Fraddam's treasure,-i for not, one'of them woulddare to.desceud.into the.treacherous "depths of the* waters' where "I had thrown it: All this passed through my mind like a flash and then I felt myself drawn by a terrible ; current down and down into the depths. It's all over;"I thought; "I shall have to go to.my Maker without ever saying good-bye tdfhj "darling;" and then death seemed terrible to. me. So terrible, indeed, was the thought of it that I, determined I would not die, and I .'held my breath as well as I could while I was carried':' a|ong! by the forco of the current. ,, How long Iiwas under- water I cannot say. ThvCqnld. not shave; been long, for one cannot seemed ages to :me.''/:,'As I'li9ok back' hbw it seems as though •those few'secohds.Sy.erCfong years.

As 'soon, as I Was able I looked'around me, but ithe.'surroundings were' entirely strange. ijAbbydmC'^rpse' a clifXa good many feet high -and-tdwardsAhis I swam; being very careful, rh'dweyer/ tp. saye inyself from striking against jian^iSfp10 hbmitless^rocks, sonie of which were :only;partially c'oyeredi*,,, 1 , was my 1salvatibn/ifor.vpresently;"I>i,Was~ able to get a ! \ footmg. oh"!cmehf;thArocks,.Without being hurt. ®e, but all in! ; -Vainp/iQiithe: one ' hand' was the sea, on the Aslit said-the riiglit'was very/calm, only now; .ahdVtlien.the'sbbbihg, moaning wind swept '^alohy the waters," aiid it was through this fact thatXi^ceftaihed my whereabouts. On listen-, ■ihg l tliought/I heard the sound of voices, -loud,, angry voices / but I was so bewildered | tb*at atrfirst I knew not what they meant, but ll fancied they were not far away ; then I fell! ito thinking of the direction from which the sound came and I imagined that the current must have carried me to the east side of the island, not far from the southern', extremity where I had been. '■< This brought back to my mind the reason why I had been thrust into the water, for those terrible feelings which possessed me as I was sucked down into the depths of Hell's Mouth had driven from my mind all thoughts of the purpose which had brought me on the island. And here I must confess, to my shame, that my first definite'thought on realising my condition wasuot thankfulness toGod for having saved mo from manifold dangers, but one of anger and impatience because , 1 had . been foiled in my purposes. ; It seemed to me as though defeat tracked my steps everywhere. Ever and always T was outwitted by more cibvei\brains thanmy own; and now, when I fancied I had wealth and power within my grasp, it wa3 snatched from me in a moment. I did hot remember the probability that the sup posed treasure was 110 treasure at all, for the improbability of anyone hiding a box of great value .at. such a place had never occurred to me. To my mind the whole business had been plain enough. Granfer Eraddam knew, of such a thing and had kept its whereabouts a pi'ofound secret: and only through the clever nsss and affection of Eli had I discovered the 'hiding-place. Evidently, too, Cap'n Jack Truscott's anxiety to possess the direc tions showed his belief in the reality of hidden riches! Since then, however, I have much doubted it. It seems, to me , next to im possible that such a place should be chosen to hide great riches. Moreover, what was the reason for hiding it'! Why had it not been taken away before ? And vet,'on the other, hand, why had the box been placed there with so much carearid iu such a, wild unfrequented place if it did not contain something of great value? These questions,'I suppose, will never be answered now. The box lies at. the bottom of "Hell's Mouth," and all the riches of the world would not tempt ine to'' try and drag it. from its resting-place.' I was saved by the in-' finite mercy of God and,'strong man as I am,' I . cannot help shuddering even now at the thought of what I felt as I was dragged by. unknown powers through the depths of that awful place. I write this that any who may read these ..lines may not be tempted to* ven ture life and reason to obtain that iron chest. Not even Cap'n Jack Truscott or any of his gang dared, do this and what they dared not attempt is' not for flesh and blood to regard as possible. At that time, however, I did not think of these things. To me it contained un told riches; in that iron casket lay love,, riches, Happiness, home. JT bad failed to obtain it, even although I haddragged it from its resting-place, because of : the subtlety of Cap'n Jack's gang. And yet T' rejoiced that I had thrown'it into the gulf. If they had foiled me I had also toiled them. All the; same I was enraged because of my failure, especially as I saw no means" of getting back Pennington. Then I thought of Naomi at Muilion' Cove and .'wondered how she t fared. ' I had told her that when I came to her again I should bring the means whereby ail her difficulties would be removed, and the intensity of my love for her made my disappointment the greater. I thought how sorrbwful she wouldfbe, and yet I rejoiced with a great joy because, of her love for me. Ay, even then, clinging to a rock close to that lonely island with enemies near me, I-could have shouted with joy at the memory of her words to me as I left her by the cottage to ivhichT had taken her. V Tor love overcometh all things. •' All these 'things passed quickly through my slow-working brain; indeed, they were an j impression rather than a series of thoughts.! Presently, too, I was able to distinguish the words that were spoken._ I could hear Eli pouring forth curses which I will not here write down, while the stranger seemed to be speaking in my praise., _ As for pap'n Jaclc, he | seemed anxious; to conciliate Eli's anger. \ Come now, booy," I heard him say, " 'tis a pity, for sure. ! I be as zorry as can be. I be all for paice, I be. I wos a bit vexed when Jaspar thrawed un into the say—who.wuddun lie ? But I did'n main to kill un. Ther, now, itcaan't be 'elped now ; and Jaspar Penning ton ed'n the fust good man that's gone to the bottom of the say." ; "He's at the bottom of 'Ell's Mouth,-" shrieked Eli, "You'thrawed un thear. But 'yo shall suffer, Jack Fraddam. If mawtheres a witch, I .be a wizard, and you shall suffer wuss than the darkness of thicky plaace, -I ded love Jaspar—He was kind to me, he .was; he loved me, he" did. He tooked?little vEli round" with un, he did.'- And then followed words which I will not write, for, indeed, they were very terrible. After this many things were said,-.: until Cap'n Jack got angry. ; • "Gabon, you little varmin," he cried; "-gab on. You thought you could outwit Jack; did 'ee? Will you be quiet now, or you'll foiler Jaspar." -; " : ••Youdarn't tich me," shrieked Eli; "you darn't. I'd maake yer flesh shrink up ef yer did." Pd make yer eye-balls burn like coals of vire, I wud. Begone from 'ere now, or Pll summons the devil, I will. Ho ed'n var from 'ere, I. tell 'ee." And then he said things which he must have borrowed from his mother, •for -1 know, of no other who could: think of them.; Any how.he -frightened (Cap'n Jack and his gang, for they cried out to their leader to leave Eli and the madman, because, they ; were afraid. This: they did with many terrible oaths and threats. :All ! the. same' they left, although they tried to seem to try and leave-in a brave way. . . ■ ;'J ' .. . 7 '7 ; "77'7 "Iss." I , heard . Israel.

And he' laughed- brutally; and yet. fearfully,: I thought. - . • -J I believe I should have cried out at < this had I not heard a'moan of agony such as;I' trust I may;'neyer Hear again; It was the stranger I was'sure whom 1 had heard.." 7 ' 7 7.7 77-' : " Tell"; me where she . is,"- he.- cried,' 'andI knew ,ho. had. followed them.: Then Lheard the sound of blows followed by groabs. " Lev us :do .'for thicky: little imp, too,"-1 heard a voice say,and then nobody 'U know. iiothin'." "7/ 7 1 ■ "I ''-77':" 77777 7" No,-"; cried Cap'n Jack,:"Betseyjlliyind out ef we do," and then. I heard their footsteps going northward.1 All this time I had been lying"-against-the rock and half of my body being ■ under water T-was chilled to the 'bone; Wheh-T tried to move I: found' that all my limbs-Were numb, and again I began to fear of escaping from wheroj-I was. ' But-this did not remain long. -The: words Israel Barnicoat Had spoken about Naomi made despair impossible and quickened my mind and;body to action:; I1 waited until'T' !;judged ' Captain 'Jack's gang'to be.out of hearing,, then i' gave a'loiv whistle", the nature of 'winch was known', only; to Eli and myself:1- / /In an instant I .heaid ' an answering cry and a few seconds/later I. heard his hoarse, 'guttural voice overhead.- ; ; , J"»/// "Jaspar, Jaspar, es ot you?

'/ Tho cliff was .perhaps . thirty" feet f in height ; just:here—I could not judge, exactly— but it was alrnost perpendicular,-so I could not climb iff ' After much struggling, however, I reach a point where ascent was possible/and aided by :-Eli, who' pulled; like a madman at the rope I had fastened around my body, 'I. at length reached a place of safety.1' "Oh, Maaster1 Jaspar !

Let us go to him." •" - 1 By the aid of the bright moonlight we found him dying seemly_ stark " and dead on the ground.1 I soon discovered to my joy/ how ever,- .-that "he: was1 only "-stunned- and 'a few minutes later he'sat up and spoke' to'us. ■ ' \--1" Jaspar Pennington not dead !' he cried. : " No/?

"Then let us go." ■ " Go • where ?" be said in a dazed kind-of way. "I must go to Naomi," I said. • "Yes,- yes," he cried eagerly; "how could' I forget ? - Yes/ we must go ■ this moment—this very inonieht. 11 am quite well and strdiig. Come at once." ' 1 "' '-"'-"-'I • He spoke with1 a'-kiiid1 of dignity, and I looked at him again to assure myself that he was the madman who had saved me byTrevose Head , "We caan'fc go .tb-iiight, ted'n saafe," said Eli/ who "continued to fondle ihy bauds and to utter all sorts of endearing, terms. „,<> " We must," ho cried, ." we must. .There's nota second to lose.

"Everything, Jaspar Pennington," lie re plied. ,;" I am Naomi Penryn's father/' ; What ?":I cried; aghast.:!! i/'Yes/Ahe repeated,.",! am Naomi Penryn's father.1 i Come lnther, Jaspar Pennington,' and let me .tell you;" He led*mo away 1 from Eli, who uttered strange low sounds/'ashealways^did when ho was excited,, and then • the man whom. I had tbought.mad spoke to me in low .earnest tones. •; "You"'have"' heard my story, . Jaspar;Pen nington,"1 lie said—/'heard how I -8trUclC/my| wife.'whijn she was in'aj^rilbub/randilabQ,;';''^ isf true.:..

You thought me mad; perhaps Ij have been—I think I have. A little while ago X was drawn to come back to Trevose, ,but I was afraid to ask any questions. I seemed to bo followed by the powers ot darkness, who forbade me to, speak. And yet I was fascinated ■ to the spot. You can guess why. I need not tell you anything else now, you know what I would . say. j The thought that I have a daughter alive and that I did not kill my wife has made the world new!" "And you did not commit suicide, then?" I said in an unmeaning, foolish sort of. way,. "•.No. Coward that I was I ran away,'and for years—years,- nearly, twenty now—I have been followed by-—-, but never mind,, it is gone—all gone. Only let us go! ;Yon, love ;my child, Jaspar Pennington. Come, we must Bud her!" ... . ., ' . . ; . " Yes, yes," I replied; "but why did, you follow me here ?' . • . "Why?, In my madness-I felt that you had the secret of my life's joy, and ..because my life has been such that I .could not bear, you,.to obtain that .which is the price of lost squls. I—X have been—where I have.heard, the.his; tory of that thing which lies under wateiv , ,,Xt j is nod a treasure, Jaspar Pennington, '/;it"is damnation. Perhaps I will' tell you more some day, but not now., Let, us leave the island.".'. • "But it .is not safe toleave.it by night.': , " Yes, X know the way. , I have b^en here many times—X mean among these islands. ,...I will take you to the sailing boat which,brought ma to St. .Agnes. Come, I will,tell you,all that needs telling as wp, go back." 1.: .... "But Cap'n Jack's gang?' - jV •..V...,: "Their boat is at St. Mary's." "How do you know?' . " ' "Enough that I have found out their plans." . ; After this Eli and I followed him to a little cove where a boat rocked and. ere. long we were landed at St. Agnes. • Here ;we! found 'a good-sized sailing boat, and here, toty I dried my clothes in a fisherman's cottage! wondering all the while at the strange tilings, which had befallen me. ... ., As soon.as morning came we started.for St. Ives, for thither Naomi'afatlier.determined..to go—for Naomi's father,I believed bimf;o be.; " He said that we should thus escape Oap'n Jaok's gang and be almost as near Muliion as if we had landed at Penzance., We did,not,; however, .land, at: St. Ives. , The .men who owned the boat consented to; take,us , on ,to Hayle, which- was five miles nearer .Muliion thanSt. lves. During our''sail across I reproached^myself greatly for' placing Naomi in'-the care of Tamsin Truscott, lor I believed that she-had been led to be unfaithful and had told Israel Barnicoat of her whereabouts; I talked much with" John Penryii about these • things, over whom a very great change had come. _ He was no longer violent in language or in deed, rather he seemed subdued and very thoughtful.; 'He spoke very calmly and carefully; and sug-j gested many things whicli would never have, occurred to mb. Moreover,, all his fears seemed; to have gone, the wild, haunted look-had passed! away from his eyes, while his.-actions -were; those of a refined gentleman. 'On: arriving" at; Hayle we, after much delay; and difficulty,1 obtained ; horses and'* rode, rapidly towards' Muliion, my heart sometimes! beating high with hope and at' others lying; heavily in- my bosom as though all "joy -were gone ; for, be it known, the revelations'of the' last few hours had *made!evefythihgappear'ih! a new light. If this man was Naomi'S father —and, as I said, 1 believed he was—I eohld'ho longer assume the position' of her -guardian and protector. She would no longer look to me as her sofa helper .and" friend. Her lather would' claim :to';be first. This led1 to many other surmises, : not many of which''avere pleasant and which made me orttimes glbomy and dejected. • , : - But these were' not .'the : matters'- concerning which'1 troubled the 'most.' I troubled about the'words of Israei Barnicobt. - What did-1 he mean by saying that Naomi was whereTshbuld never ' be able to get to her ?~:f ! -. •>: "Ihadhad butlittlesleepformariy, manjrhours, but T felt ho weariness.''My strength" seemed to indreate with my difficulties, and Ddid' not once droop in my saddle or rub' iny eves like a drowsy man. It must have be'en near atweiity miles' ride from HayJefo.Mihlion,' but we were hot long in covering itindeed, aft'er'we had reached Helstpmwe rode as fast as (the hors'es woiild carry us,, On, coming in sight of ' Mrs. Crantock's house I left my companions! so eager was,S; ahd';thus reached * the .white house with 'a green porch some minutes before they came up. Opening the door without knocking I entered and found Mrs. Orantoek looking pale and worried, but I could nowhere see Naomi. "Thank God you have come,? cried the woman. "Why? Where is she?" I asked.; ' "She's gone!'I know not where." . . "How'is that?" I cried angrily. , "You promised that you would care for her, that you would guard her as if she were your own child." ; " Yes, yes. Oh ! young man, it is wrong to trust to an arm of flesh." "Look you," I cried, catching her roughly by the arm, "I want no religious talk. I left a lonesome, helpless maid with you, whom you promised to protect. Where is she now ?" I said this like" one demented; as indeed I was. I heard Eli; and ( Naomi's father enter the room,, but I took no heed,."neither did I listen carefully to the sifory the woman told. '•"•I'l^ave some vague remembrance about her saying-she went 'to ihear' Mr.'^Charles Wesley, "leaving Naomi with', Tamsin;' and 'that oh her 'feturn that mbfhihg:both* had^'gone; • She!:had'en quired of her neighbors aii'd had .been 'told that three men had'come,to-'the ihbuse'at'lday break and-tha'f when 'they wenf'away Tamsin and Naomi rode- with ; them -in. the^carrjage they had brought. , It was well -Naomi's father was.-with;me,'ifor I my mind was too confused to ask the necessity questions.;;;I :reproached myselfifor;itrustimg Tamsin and for not talcing better precautions.
