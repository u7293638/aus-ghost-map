THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION MEETING IN THE FREEMASONS' HALL. A NOTABLE DEMONSTRATION. PROMINENT PUBLIC MEN ON THE SITUATION. SOME TRENCHANT SPEECHES. The members of the National Association made their annual meeting, which was held last night in the Freemasons'-hall, the occasion for an imposing political demonstration representatives of the Country party and the newly-formed Young Victorian Patriotic League joining forces with them for that purpose. Keen interest was taken in the proceedings, and consider- ably before 8 o'clock the hall was crowded, both as regards the floor space and the gal- leries The \ ice chairman of the association, Mr 11 S Inglis, presided in the absence through illness of the president, Mr James Macdougall He was supported bj a number of gentlemen, among them being Mr J B. Patterson M L A Mr R Murray Smith, Mr. James Campbell, Mr F Langton, Mr li. Harpei, M L A , Mr L L Smith, M L A., Mr J M Bruce, Mr M Knox, Mr H. Butler Mr J G W W îlmot Mr S Miller, Mr. Ü It M'Gregoi, Mr W 1 Johnston, Mr L\ Jowett, Mr 1" Madden, Mr J Buchan, Mr. A ¡? King Mr I Catto, Mi C H Davu. mid Mr G G Crcspin Hie CHUUMVN saul the) were met that night as an association in conformit) vv ith their rulo which provided that the annual meeting should be held in lebruary. 'Ihey had been only seven mouths in existence, but the council of the asso- ciation had vviselv determined that, in- stead of hav mg a mere formal meeting for the presentation of a report, they would in« vite some of the most prominent political men to give then views on some of the prominent questions which would ntitnte their minds at the general election. (Cheers) It was to be regretted that their president (Mr Tames Macdougall) was absent through illness but ho (the chairman) felt pleased to preside over so large and in- fluential a meeting He trusted that a fair hearing would be given to all tlie speakers. (Hear, near) This was a time of importance when it behoved every man who had the interest of the colony at heart to take one side or the other (Hear hear) He moved the adoption of the following report - * We take this opportunity of submittin; a bnöf rcport of the association's operations in order Ixl conform with our rules During the association B existence a number of publie meetings hay e been held in the suburbs to expound our views with ttie result that numerous branches have been established around the inetrojiolis and at the same timo cou staut correspondence IKIB been kept up with tho varlous country districts v here a number of pamphlets have been issued The result is tint our causo has taken a good hold in the provinces and that our programme has been generally adopted The deprtment of our operations devoted to electoral registration has done very satisfactory work The apathetic section of the publio were aroused to a sense of their duties before the tima expired for the issue of elector» right« the rculti I oin,* visible in the large accession tu the raiburbaji rolls Till« combined with the operations of th* llolls Purification let will have a marked influenco in favour of the peace and progress candidates at the next elections He congratulated the association on the* amount of work it had been able to do It had afhrmed not only m Melbourne and suburbs but throughout the country districts, the desirability of taking decided action at the coming election (Cheers ) It had also done good w ork in connection with the elec- toral roll It was surprising that so many young men did not take advantage of their right to vote, but he could assure them that when the new roll came out it would be seen that there had been a large accession to the numbers of manhood suffrage votes. (Cheers ) Hie motion was seconded b) Mr F. Madden, and carried unanimously Mr J B PATURSON, ULA, who was re ceiv ed w ith prolonged cheers, movetl the first resolution The) hudtotakcintocoiisideration how thev desired to be represented for the next three ) ears , and the term of Parliament itself did not by anv means express or rcprcsent the influence of that Parliament for good or ill There might be many sections and groups ot parties , but, m his opinion, the cen ti al consideration niter all waa that there were two distinct parties in this commumy, One must be regarded as the party of order (hear hear)-which according to the laws of nature and the evidences of experience, led to national prosperity (Cheers) Hie other part), by its teaching, was justly entitled to be called the party of anaichy (Cheers and interruption ) Such teachings led to national decay (Cheers and ' No, no ) The) had had a bitter experience of the arrogance and tyranny of one party-(cheers and "No, no )-which had ripened into a public respect for the other, and they had the advantnge of knowing what was wanted for the good of the community and what was not wanted Now was the time to speak out plainly and for public men to assert what they meant Ihe could point out a few things that we did not want We did not want a continuation of the present depression, nor the elevation to political power of any set of men to increase our mis fortunes (Cheers and interruption ) 'We did not wish to foster any form of tyranny or boycott in this community (Cheers ) We did not want to confiscate other peoples earnings and shirk liability ourselves (Cheers ) "We did not want to increase the voting power of the metropolis and cripple the country districts (Cheers) We would do our best to avoid the calamity of handing over the government of this beautiful country to a communistic crowd who were howling about the streets (Prolonged cheering ) That was very plain speaking—remarkably plain speaking (Heur, hear ) Now he wished to speak of some things we did want We wanted to restore prosperity in this com- munity, and to pay our way with our own money (Cheers ) We were resolved to maintain order, and to uphold constitutional authority at any cost (Cheers) We wanted to encourage the investment of capital, so that our great resources might be developed and our products increased The call list, as against that of the dividends, was an ad- mirable lesson to those who desired to drive capital out of the country Ihey all wanted employment to be plentiful and profitable in eveiy branch of nidustry and they looked to private enterprise as the foundation of suc- cess (Cheers ) He mifht say further although he trusted his friend Mr Shiels, would not be offended-that they wanted, a Government with a policy and with the courage to proclaim that policy without pro- crastination (Cheers ) And havimg pro claimed that policy, a Government was wanted with backbone to carty it out We had had no Government in this country since the first week in Janiuary, and now the Premier, it was authoritatively stated, would make no speech until the 11th March That was flouting the community Close on the day of the general election we knew nothing of the polioy of the men in power, and therefore the other parties had to make up a policy outside the Government and that was radically unconstitutional (Cheers ) He had given them something like what he called his confession of faith, and he re- garded that meeting as something like a triple alliance to give a guarantee of peace and security for the future (Cheers ) In the ranks he saw before him there were old heads of wisdom and experience and there were young men of vigour and intellect (Cheers ) And therefore they welcomed to this meeting the Victorian patriotic youngsters (Cheers ) The country party were the practical party of progress in this country They desired to foster and encourage agricultural and horti cultural, mining and manufacturing in- dustries to the utmost and if it was desired to gain the favour of the farmer it would be necessary to recognise his claims and treat him justly in matters both of legislation and administration (Ghi em) llie National Association inscribed on its banner the words dear to the British race everywhere, viz, "Freedom and Personal Liberty." (Cheers) The 'Young Victorian Patriotic party unfurled the flag of patriotism With patriotism the progress of these colonies need know no bounds with these three sections or parties combined for good, what advance ment we would have here ! And it united to re sist the poisoned doctrines being taught —the deadening influence of which was not known to those who prescribed the poison—these parties, so consolidated could take into their ranks men from every walk of life A great deal had been said about the "one man one vote." It ran truppingly on the tongue like the prattle of the parrot and a grnut many were caught by the music who new nothing about the matter As the result of one vote we had these hard working labouring men like his logical friend Mr Trenwith in Parlia ment the bluff Mr Hancock and the spruce and kind hearted Mr Malony (Laughter) And yet round the city of Melbourne and the suburbs from the lips of these men who were continually clamouring for one man one vote we had many other vain conceits The thing itself was not so very bad at the proper time, but it came, like Hamlet's ghost, in such a questionable shape that we had only to speak to it and, depend upon it, it would vanish away. If ever there was a time when we were called upon in the in terests of the colony to put our minds together, to put the national tram on patriotic rails, that timo w as now, and the coming struggle would not be the end but the beginning (Cheers) The general elec- tions would introduce into Parliament a number 01 joung men, a number of new men, and he trusted to see a higher and nobler political life, because wo had been drifting and drifting, nnd men had become indifferent to the great interests of the colony, till at last we began to look to some hero, or some patent medicine, for rescue That wos a re llcction upon our common sense He felt convinced that if thej presented themselves before the public under the standard of pro gress, freedom, and liberty, and if the three parties combined, the public would not bo appealed to m vuin He was glad to see this kirge gathering He was Riad that public feeling was aroused In France and other countries the great oharge was that the best men did not come for« ard 1 hose men were nahamed to face a matter of this kind, which vv as not a simple matte r '1 hese men did not care to present themselves before public criticism He was pleased and delighted to be present at this great gathering, nnd he had much pleasure m submitting the foi low ing resolution - "That this meeting regareis It OB imperativo for tlio restoration of industrial prosj erllj that tlio orcdlt of tlio colonj should bo strengthened and Tilth this objcot adiooatcs such Increased taxation ?coupled with general retrenchment, as will plaoo tlio finances on a thoroughl} sound basis and justify a. moderato expenditure on reproductivo public works (Cheers ) Mr It McmrtAT SMITH, who was received with cheers seconded tho resolution Mi Patterson had dealt so broadly and com ?prehcnsively with the general question In volved in the foundation and progiess of the .National Association that ho proposed, in following thnt gentleman, to address him self cluellj to tlie financial details of the resolution, which appeared to him to be a series of pretty well indisputable propositions He supposed no one would deny that oredit tw as absolutely necessary for the progress of nnj new countrj In proportion as the natural resources of anj new country were great, and in proportion to the energj and activ lty of its inhabitants, was the neceBsitj .for appealing to older countries for a supplj of that necessary capital w ithout which these .resources could not be utilised or that energy demonstrated Itwasdesirablethatthatsupply of capital should be judicious constant and liberal With regard to the judiciousness ot that supply Sir Graham Berrj m his remarks the other day seemed to think that the ..nghsh capitalist was to some estent re sponsible for our present situation, inasmuch as he had almost forced on Sir Graham, when Agent General rather more monoy than he wanted lhat capital hod been lent to us with the implied obligation that we should use it wisely and well, and if we failed to do so the fault was not with the Tnghsh capitalist-the fault was our own With regard to the hberahtj and constancy of the supply we had hud nothing to com plain of up to the presmt moment On the 1st of Janunrj, 18S3, the debt of this colony was £22,000 000, it was now, or was on the 1st of January, _8'I2, £43,000,000 So that in Government capital alone we had derived from the mother country in the short space of nine j cars £22 600,000 In addition to that-he took no account of the treasury bills which were to be negotiated-according to Mr Hayters statistics the borrow mg of the v anous public and municipal bodies amounted to £0,000,000, nnd he thought it would be a very moderate estimate indeed to take the private borrowings as equivalent to that, which made np a total of about £14,000 000, which during nine j ears the colony had received from the mother countrj 1 his no doubt vi as responsible for tw o cv Us firstly, the excessive land speculation, and secondly and more important, the gigantio and reckless expenditure to which our apparent prosperity lind tempted the Govern ment. The expenditure of 18S7 8 was largo enough, but that of the following j ear was more bj half a million, and that again was topped bj the expenditure of 1888 00, which exceeded it by a million and three quarters As everjone knew, the reducing of expendí ture was difficult and the succeeding Treasurer had been forced into nn expendí turo which landed the colony last year m a deficit of over £200,000, which, if increased by unrccoiipcd advances, would amount to over £700,000 Under tliesu circumstances it was not surprising if our credit had rather waned , but what, it must be asked, bud we done w ith this mass of money Î Much of it, he feared had been wasted (Hear, hear ) Railwajs had been made, as he had heard it said, starting from a pubhehouse and ending in a swamp public works undertaken which served no useful purpose, and, as regarded private expendí ture, palatial houses and fcorgeous shops built for which there were no tennnts No wonder, therefore, our credit had suffered to the extent shown by tho late Agent General recently when he called ntten tion to the fact that our 1. per cent debentures iloated at 103 were now only salo able at 01, a loss of 12 per cent w Inch meant of course that in every million no might borrow now we should lose compared with that operation, £120,000 Anothor instance was furnished by the city of Mel bourne loan, which during the earlj period of his own ici m as Agent General vins floated at 101 gross, or 100. net, while the Metropolitan Boord of Works at present was nimble, to Uoiit a loan of exactly the sumo amount at anv reasonable rate J he question was vv hat steps w ere now to bo taken, because ciedit was absolutely necessary to us if we were to go on progressing 'lhe first step that must occur to everyone was re trenchmint-the setting of our finances upon nn equilibrium, and making income and ox penditure balance Nothing produced a stronger and more direct effect upon the financiers ot Great Britain than an examina tion of the public balance sheets year by jour When thej Baw that a country was attending to its financial business, and making its ledger balance, its credit was re garded as safe, and they hastened to entrust their gigantic savings to the custodj of that country 'therefore, men of all Bides would agree that the first thing necessarj to be done was to adjust our linanoes '1 hat, however, could not be done to any large extent by retrenchment Re Ironchment hastily carried out was not nn unmixed good It was certain to inflict considerable hardship and injustice, and not the lease evil of the previous reckless ex travagance was that it rindered the path backward so difficult 'I he gups must there fore be filled up mundy bj new taxation Hu himself, thank goodness, was not treasurer of the countiy, and did not envy poor Mr Shiels his task 1 hat gentleman would no tloubt lind some means of bridging over the gap, but this after all woultl only amount to temporarj relief We must turn our at- tention to tlie development of our industrial lesourccs, especially to our export business (Cheers ) Years ago both m speaking and wrihng, he pointed out the extraordinary dis erepanoj between our imports and exports In 1890 the imports were £0,000,000 more than the exports and though last year this difference was lessened to about £0,000,000, we had not yet as regarded our exports got back to the level of 1880 We absolutely ex ported from this colony more m 1880 than in 1801 Considering the increased population, the enormously increased expenditure, and the sums lavished upon us by the mother country, was not this an extraordinary and unsatisfactory state of things to everyone in the community ? (Hear, hear) To pro duce the change desired we mpst pay atten tion strnctly to reproductive work, and, as a corollary, abandon unreproductive work It was no use digging holes and filling them up again The subject was a difficult one, and in this connection he must allude to the unemployed problem If we could always make certain of full work and high wages this would be a paradise for the working man and everyone else (A Voice-" What do you do for a living? ) He could anly say thit he fancied he worked quite as hard as if not a little harder than, the author of that interjection (Cheers and laughter ) An extraordinary error many of these men made was that no one worked with any honour at all, no matter what a man did, whether he worked with his head or his hands, unless he belonged to the sacred ranks of those injudiciously and falsely called the labouring classes (Cheers ) It would be a good thing it the working men could receive good employment at high wages, and he fully recognised the responsi bihty which the Government had to undergo atn period like this because the Government was and always had been the largest employer of labour in the country The Government must lace the difficult situation and do their best to lessen the depression which previous extravagance had caused It might be very hanlon Mr Shiels and Mr Munro to have to answer for the sins of their predecessors but a Government was continuous, and must accept its responsibilities But the help of the Government could only be temporary, and must be confined in the narrowest pos sible limits, and brought to an end as soon as possible All classes were in the same boat and HiifTi ring ulilti J lu re hud been no Ulysses amongst them, who liad not listone 1 to the sirtn voices of the land boom, and had not found as a result an attenuated income mid unsiitisfnu tory bank balance (Cheers und laughter ) The wage earning class could not expect to be free from the depression The wages had been temporarily - only temporarily they hoped-depleted If the same rate of wages were kept up it must be divided amongst the smaller number, or if among the larger number, the rate of wages must be reduced All they could do was to try to get rid of the depression as soon as possible, and take care that it did not occur again Without having the slightest wish to question the sin cerity or earnestness of the labour leaders he said that it was because they did not appreciate or understand tho important fact he had just mentioned, and because the objects they aimed at were impossible, and because any attempt at their realisation would be very damaging to the state—it was for these reasons he felt bound on the present occasion, as ho had done many n time before to urge a strenuous and united opposition to those labour leaders (Cheers ) 'Jhe realisation of their aims would be more disastrous even to the wage earners them selves than defeat would be their defeat would conduce to the advantage of the state at large and to their own class in particular (Cheers and No, No ) He eamestly asked all who thought with hlm to lay aside all minor considerations m the coming contest 1 very one of thom had some particular predilection or particular dislike , but let them set aside all minor con siderations ¡and addiess themselves to the task, which would tax their energies to the utmost of restoring pence pro.iess, mid prospinty to the counti) to which we be longed (Cheers ) He trusted the opposi tion iv ould be strenuous, and he welcomed, as Mr Patterson had done, tho great assist ance which the Young Victorian Patrnotic Association was about to render to the cause of law order and progress (Cheers ) He hoped the league would go on and prosper, possessed of youth, enthusioasm, energy, and of education, winch would rightly guide that enthusiasm and energy, and they could commit Victoria with confidence to the help and guidance ot that patriotic association (Cheers ) He wished before sitting down to say a few words to that very large class of decent ordorly people who professed not to understand politics, who went their own road and paid their own way, and whose political aspira tions were limited, like Mr Pickwicks, to shouting with the crowd, and. if there were two crowds, with the larger (Cheers) The time was past for that sort of thing They could no longer halt between two opinions It was not sufficient to mean well by their country, if they never carried out that mean nig in any possible direction Their op ponents, and rightly too, took the trouble to get votes All ought to make up their minds for one side or the other The general population of the country was thoroughly in favour of progress and order, and if they acted unitedly he felt certain they would be successful and their victory would be beneficial not only or chiefly to themselves, but to every man be his opinions what they might, who was interested in the progress and prosperity of the colony (Cheers ) '1 ho resolution wus carried almost unam mously Mr HonERT nAitiKn, ML A, who was received with cheers and some mild ' boohoolng, moved the following résolu tion - ' That inasmuch as tho solo object of the National Assouiation is tho preservation of tho interest of all sections of tho community and especially of the great producing Interests It is in the opinion of this meeting highl) dcsirablo that every effort be made to form effective alliances vvilh Oreanisitlons having similar aims lu order that concerted action may be taken at tho forthcoming elections It waa about sev cn months since he had the honour of proposing a resolution at the for mation of this association On that occasion there wns a w idespread feeling that our political affairs had become almost desperate, and that we were drifting into a position w Inch would be disastrous in the extreme, and the formation of that association was the first sign of new life sturt nig the mass m this countr) The resolution he had proposed was one that recognised the fact that the National Association was not the onl) exhibition of a wide and deep feeling about the condition of this country Other associations had been formed to ncluei e the same objects, and it was his duty to propose that while they recognised these associations, the) sought to join with them hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, in order to pull this country through (Cheers ) The National Associa tion hud been objected to on the grounds that it was purely a conservative connivance which wies meant to take aw a) the liberties of the people, and that it was intended to promote class interests Those who made that charge had not lead the programme of the association, else the) could make no such nssertion Hussocict) was formed to embrace all classes Owing to the recent course of poll tics, it was considered necessar) that new alliances should be formed, and that men m opposing camps should be brought together m Older that the countr) might be saved (Cheers ) If the liberals had not come into the association it was thpir fault, but he was (,lad to sa) that the chairman of the meeting wus one of the liberals who had come in (Cheers ) On the other hand, they had been told that the association was too neutral mid toe colourless 1 he piomoters of the associa tion showed wisdom in making the pro gramme neutral as far as party politics w ere concerned, but there was no uncer taint) of sound as to its objects, which were to preserve and promote the right of personal hbert) (Cheers ) If this as Boclation had done nothing more than to bring into being the \oung Victorian I'ntnotio League there would be no cause to regret the crisis which now existed In a free anddemocraticcountr) there was nothing so dangerous ns np lth), and the apathy of the )oung men who would have to govern in the future was the most dangerous of nil 1 he) vv ere desirous of co operating with these )oung men as a new regiment m tho nrm), which they trusted was now marching on to victory (Cheers and disorder ) The National Association sought to promote the interests of all the treat pioducing classes of this country, and the countr) party in Parliament had recently adopted a programme which in every respect was covered by that of the National Asso ciation 1 he) all rejoiced that nt hist the great backbone of the country-the great producing interest« of this countr)-were woking up to their true interests nnd were determined to be no longer sacrificed (Cheers) Nothing would give lum greater pleasure than to welcome a fourth regiment which would be composed of those respect- able working men-(cheirs)-who were dominated by the Trades hall influence (Interruption and cheers ) He believed that to no small degree we owed the failure of our credit to the thorough want of confidence generated during the last three years by the belief prevailing that a class of socialistic agitators - (interruption and cheers)-had to some extent succeeded in misleading a large body of the working classes, and were striving to get hold of the reins of Government Our safety lay in re storing confidence,avoiding extremes, laying aside all the various socialistic and com munistic theories-(interruption and cheers) -and practising industry (Cheers ) Mr G D Muni-rr. seconded the íesolu tion Hie National Association-(A Voice ' National Ass )-had paid the hyh comph ment to the Young Victorian Patriotic League of inviting itB members to be present that evening and the council of the latter had done Mr E Jowett and himself the honour of asking them to explain why the league was created and how it. meant to work It wus onl) right to take the op portumty of thanking the National Asso elation, committee, members and score tar), who had from the first extended the right hand of fellowship to the league (Hear, heai ) Oneil) because the National Association WOB composed of their fathers and older friends representing the pioneers who had developed this great country and built up this great city, he wished to make it clear that the Young Vic lorian Patriotic League had no desire to supersede those pioneers, or ask them to step aside and allow the younger men to ti) and govern this colony The most satisfac tory evidence of this was, that the older politicians did not resent the entrance of the league into the domain Hiey were as Mr Harper had said, but a regiment m the great electoral army, but they would furnish volunteers for forlorn hopes, and they would always be found in tlioviry vanguard lighting anarchy (Cheers, groans, and laughter ) One point he wishrd to make plain with some vehemence was that the) were not an oflshoot of the National Association The latter body never suggested or started the league and the league would never be absorbed by it For years post, since the unfortunate abolition of part) government, the oountiy had been asleep and there had been no way for young men to exercise political thought This period of inactivity had been disastrous be cause the generation which must supply the statesmen and workers of the future had in consequence not been politically educated The young men were therefore, politically ignorant ("Hear, hear and laughter ) lins was now to be lemedicd Hie young men were to be taught to take up the mantle of the oldi r men, and would in time guide this countr) to the (.reutest hcijjit of prospint) an) nation bud ever nttaine 1 (Applause and ironical eheeis ) As the result of the indifference of the past, power had been boldly bid for by a band of unscrupulous and scheming agitators ( linn hear and (.roans)-and the remedy for political apalhy was to be found in united action now Of 2*0 0U0 Assembly voters 1/35 000 weie between tin ages of 21 and 10 so it would be seen that those whom the league was likely to embrace were as three to two to the rest of the community, and hud the power of actually deciding the ensuing elections (Cheers ) A number of them had awakened at last to the fact that they had political rights and meant to advance them They were gectting tired of going to the allegcd logicnl Irenwith the humorous Hancock, and the kind hearted Dr Malone)-(laughter)-cap in hand and ask nig these tlirio gentlemen with bated breath lor leave to live in their own native land (Chienne, ) At present wc wanted peace, not votes-(hear hear)-work for the unem ployed not only the labouring classes but for clerks, shopmen and even some employers That the league would do its best to obtain Tho great strength of the Trades hall was derived from the young men -(hear, hear)-and many of these could by persuasion be brought to see he believed that their interests were those of the league -at least that this was our country as much as theirs. They should be on the side of the league-(cries of "No )-and by proper per suasion he believed many stragglers would be won from the Socialist camp (Cheers) As Mr Harper had said, the great blot upon our record at present was cowardice-(A Voice- Where will you be when the time comes' )-but the league looked with faith to the people themselv es and trusted that thej would no longei be seen going about whining over the situation He experienced a sense of abasement to think that Australians the proud sons of a proud race, should give way in this manner (Cheers, and a voice-' Dontcrj ) Tust as no man spoke of his own private financial affuirs so we should avoid us far as possible speaking of the national finances and if thej were men tioned it should bo only to bolster up our credit not to run it dow n Notwithstanding that the league had ovei 1 000 members, anil that it bud twelve suburban meetings to come he lind heard it described as a Hash in the pan (A Voice-' So it is ) Perhaps it was in the sense that it would set fire to a train of patriotic gunpowder which they hoped would blow to the four winds of heaven the pieaohers of sedition treason and anarchy The league meant to do its best by organisation to tear this up root and branch (Hear, hear) Hte members did not intend that their heritage should de scend to the level of the Argentine Re public and were resolved to work unitedly for the restoration of confidence Mr JAMES CAMPBELL moved That this meeting is opposed to tho principle of one man one vote as tending to throw the balance of political power into the hands of tho class who have no settled Interests in the colony, and advocates tho due representation of thrift in any reform of tho franchise He had had such a great deal to do recently with the one man one vote question, that he was afraid he had got it on the brain (Laughter ) He had a few ideas to lay before that meeting Some five years ago he was in Japan, and there, near Yokohama in the middle of a plain stood a magnificent idol one of the grandest works ever executed by man, some 55ft high and of so majestic an expression that one had a feeling to fall down and do it reverence But on going round to the back, and entering a little door one was tempted to burst into the exclamation of the Yankee on looking down into the hold of a ship Why the darned thing is hollow (Cheers and laughter ) Lately a great idol had been erected on the plains of Victoria, (Cheers ' No no, and 'Yes yes ) Me had been called to bow down and do reverence be fore it lhere was a procession headed by Mr Shiels or Mr Munro he was not sure which, with a dulcimer, Mr Trenwith with a psaltery, and Mr Hancock with a sackbut-(cheers and laughter)-and winding up the procès sion, as a land of anachronism, came Mr Maloney wîth a penny whistle (Cheers and laughter) lins great Victorian idol was called "one man one vote." It was a cry beautiful very majestic but when they got inside they found the darned thing was hollow (Laughter and cheers ) He was a great admirer of the theory of one man one vote Starthng as it migbt sound he admired the theory It had, however, two trifling defects Hte first was that it was logically false-(Cheers, ' No, no and "Yes jes ) and the Second was that it was practically dangerous (Cheers No and ' \es Hte theory of the one man one vote briefly stated, was that a man was entitled to a vote because he was a man (Cheers ) Ah, did that not make the great heart of Collingwood respond? (Laughter cheers and interruption ) He asked a ques tion the other day and was longing for an answer The question was, 'Are there any who believe in one man one vote—who believe in giving a man a vote for hIns man hood only—who would give a vote to a Chinaman' (Cheers laughter, and interrup tion ) Would they give the Solomon Islanders a vote simply because they were men? They knew they would not Before they gave a man a vote they demanded something else beside mere manhood (Cheers No and 'Yes ) 'What made manhood great wits not the phjsical semblance of a man but the moral qualities in a man (Cheers and interruption ) Would any gentleman who believed in one man one vote give in his prnvnte business equal rewards for unequal merits? Would they then, in public affairs give equal political powers to those of unequal merits? Under the existing law they said that no man should vote unless he could read and write (Hear hear) Htat was admir able and right and proper but did the sup porters of one man one vote not see that it cut from under their feet instantly the ground that a man waS entitled to a vote simply because he was a man ? There were certain qualities which must be in a man before he could exercise the franchise and he trusted Victoria would alwajs insist on qualities, and say that men should prove them solves worthy of the franchise before it could be committed to them (Cheers) I here were etornnl limitations in nature that man could not overpass The supporters of the one man one vote prnctically said they would put aside the laws of nature and give all men equal merit and position That was a funda mental fallacy from the beginning lhere never could be good legislation or a nation built up on what was a false foundation to start with Some people asked how the best men were to be found That was a practical objection All the difficulties that could be put in the way regarding the dual vote were difficulties of mechanism but the difficulty that could be thrown in the way of the one man one vote was that it was beginning with what was radically wrong at the start and must work out wrong in the same way as a calculation beginning with one wrong figure (Cheers ) A Voice -What about New Zealand ? Mr CAMPUKLL - They had to remember that the life of a nation was counted by decades and centuries and not by years and they had to wait to see how it would work out Furthermore, the political history of New Zealand was not very encouraging (Cheers ) Ihe one man one vote was dangerous, because sO far as this colony was concerned it was likely to shift the balance of power into the wrong hands (Cheers and pro longed interruption ) It was obvious that he was stinging his opponents (Laughter ) Ihey had heard Mr Patterson as to the effect of the one man one vote on tho resldents of the country ;and one of the most thoughtful things said for many years was that the great cities were cancers of civilisation What should be done as far as possible was to hold the balance of power in safe hands as against unsafe hands They wished to maintain the equilibrium and to have the power of the country in the hands of the strong solid element of society which could build up a strong national life (Cheers) They might ask now did the one man one vote legislation arise It was never really demanded by a great consensus of public opinion But it had arisen, and had to be faced and it had to be replied to, and it had been replied to by the dual vote ('Oh ob and cheers ) When first the dual vote was proposed it was laughed to scorn by a large section of people who had no idea of the strength of public opinion behind the demand They had discovered, as the Americans said, that the dual vote "had caught on," and what they were now praying for was a com fortable back door through which to slip (Cheers ) He could not say that the existing proposal of the dual vote covered all the ground It would require to be amended in many ways-it would have to be enlarged There should be a representation of thrift in other forms than that of property It was an open question whether education should not be represented He should be inclined to substitute for the term "dual vote" tho term "home franchise" (Cheers ) The men who owned homes were the solid men—(cheers) - and should have a voting power because they had homes (Cheers) They were the very salt of the community— tho backbone of the nation. In their hands the franchise was safe (Cheers) This was a practical programme which repudiated the miserable bastard political communism that so much had been heard of and if they made this their programme they would make the pillars of the state and set them down on tho foundation of equality and justice (Cheers ) Mr E. JOWETT seconded tho motion (Cheers) The only moral justification for governing lay in the well being of the community The valid claim that any man had to a vote lay not in the fact that he was a man, but in his capacity and desire to use that vote for the well being of the community (Cheers) The claim that every man had a right to the same voting power was an attempt to establish the spurious right of equality where no such equality existed (Cheers ) The real object of the men who were behind this one man one vote proposal was to destroy the influence of tho working classes who were thrifty and provident-(cheers)— to destroy the legitimate political influence of the former and the business man, the politi cal influence of the settled interests of this country because they knew that so long as this influence prevailed it would always stand in the way of their socialistic experiments and schemes of confiscation and disorder (Cheers) Their real object was not to raise the position of the working classes, but to usurp the control of the Legislature for their own purposes to confiscate property of the thrifty classes of the community and to re venge themselves upon the employers of labour (Cheers ) It behoved all law abiding citizens to subordinate all party and local considerations and to combine together as one man to resist the attempted domina tion of the labour party and their one man one vote (Cheers ) The motion was put and declared carried unanimously, amidst loud cheers Mr II Berri En moved a vote of thanks to tho chairman for his impartiality and firmness In prcserv mg order The motion was earned unanimous!), ana the meeting then closed
