THE T H'A N T MINE E. ("A xtonj of the old gold digging days.) "Triti, you a ghost, story," said my uncle Ned,:"a halo Old gentleman of 70 years. . " Well, I will relate a peculiar affair that happened on Tallmans Gully, in 1859." We were all attention, and listened to the very remark able narrative he related in the following manner : " You must know." commenced my uncle, " that I and four mates were living in a tent on the banks of the river— living, I .said, I should have called it existing, for we were most unfortunate; only finding sufficient gold to keep us in the commonest tucker. After our evcryday's work, you, rnay.be sure we were tired enough ; but we were every night- disturbed in our rest by the clin'k, clink, clink of a pick, about fifty yarns from our canvas home. This confounded noise always eommenccd.at midnight, and did not- cease , until the .break of day. One night we were determined to see who it. was ; so we sallied forth in the bright moonlight, .and saw a figure in a coarse red flamrel shirt,;high.bpots, arid slouched hat, hard at work by an old claim which had, been deserted for many years. I was chosen spokcsinau, to expostulate with this noisy digger; but wheii-l'vvasiwithiti-twenty yards of him, I stood still, transfixed with horror, — fof tbe"'we<arer of the digger's clothes was no living man, hut-a sltcleton /" " 'Uncle Ned 1" we all.cried, " ho.w fearful." 'I-Orie night, our tent" was visited by- a handsome, well- to- do .looking man,' of '.about fifty years of age, who enquired ffbr a digger of vvhqm we knew nothing about. Heitold iis. th.atdn'Bl he and a mate of his- deserted from one.of 'Hm- Majesty's .ships, and started for -the Tallm.ans gold fields They worked with prett.y good luck for a few months, when the new comer went down to Melbourne to see about some letters. Before he went, he s.aid to his majfe, 'Bbij, whatever you do, never stop working the cl.aim fpra day until ! come hack.' /Bob promised, and they parted. 'I went! down to Melbourne,! said the ex- digger,' and there w.as arrested as a deserter, and sent on boar'd ;''-'an'd now that I have obtained my discharge, I have hastened up here to, find ray old chum.' 'You will see ihiin to-night,' I-,8gid-;., Vl3ut''you'lrfind him very much chagged.' At J midnight, the everlasting clink of the phantom's pick' was'be.ard; qndjwc all burned: out.
