A LETTER TO AN ASPIRING NOVELIST. By WALTER MURDOCH. | You have honoured me by asking for my judgment on your first essay in fiction, and I hasten, not ss. without some misgivings, to reply What you really wish I suppose, is a candid opinion from an outsider on vom chances of ultimate success, and as I have been watching, with some interest, that the methods employed by the really successful novelists during the last twenty years, possibly Borne of my observations may be of use to you at the outset of your career In the first place, I trust that you have had Yourself of one youthful illusions you may have had as to the profession you have chosen, that you have long since given up the idea of building for eternity" and the like absurdities Have you ever read a novel called "Anna, or, the Memoirs of a Welsh Heiress, interspersed with Anecdotes of a Nabob It was published in 1785, its author was a Mrs A M Ileioctt,«'and the first edition was completely exhausted on the first day of issue, so renowned was the writers name Another offer master pieces, "Vicissitudes Abroad, or the Ghost of My Father ' (1800), was in six volumes, each volume cost six shillings, and yet two thousand copies of the whole work were sold on the day of publication! This Mrs Bennett was evidently the Miss Corelli of her time I would have you observe, too, that in the very year that witnessed Mrs Bennetts most signal triumph an obscure authoress, who was destined to be compared with Shakespeare by no less a critic than Macaulay, and whose novels me the delight of every intelligent render today, was hawking her sense and sensibility' from publisher to publisher, and that thirteen years were to pass before she could find anyone willing to take the risk I love to dwell on these facts You can scarcely talk of building for eternity when you reflect that Mrs Ben nett, who charmed and edified so many thousands in her day, is now so completely forgotten that even the biographical die libraries are mute concerning her those who, among ourselves, have succeeded li! e Mrs Bennett must expect to shine her fate, me! well for them that it is so The only popular novelist at the present time who still talks about the praises of pos tests is Mr Hall Caine, and he must surely be the unhappiest man alive if he seriously belief, es that such a book as The Christian will be remembered and treasured up against him by succeeding generations His fears, however, are groundless A merciful oblivion will fall like the gentle den, on that admired romance, and the names winch at present bulk largest on the literary horizon and, before very long, have joined the choir invisible of those who have written for the moment and leaped the few yards of the moment and how splendid the rewards ire' I have seen it stated that the present is the Golden Age of fiction, and, indeed, the Statement brooks with no demand Neither Mrs Bennett, not Monk Lewis, nor Jin ]{idchfie, not the other member of the chest of the forgotten, was quite so celebrated or quite so nimbly solvent, as the popular novelist of to day is not the voice of the interviewer heard at his doors from morn to night, clamorous for an audience of the great man' And are not his lightest sayings piously chronicled, and eagerly treasured up by a public greedy for details of their favourite' He hopes the public interest in and by an engaging cm dom, entering the interviewer with an affable smile, and treating him to a thousand delightful confidences, which appear, in due course, in the magazine that had the honour of publishing his last tremendous send His worst enemy ein seal tely assert that his soul is like a star and dwells apart He has no ferrets from his film rub What his set in by is what brand of elgin he affects, when he pitied up that famously an oil walking stick of his, what his inmost applications sure, how much he got for his latest master piece, whether his wife appreciates him, what his favourite quotation is these the. things which we are all privileged to know by heart If his bull terrier has a cast in its etc the public is not long kept in ignor once of the fact ( a mysterious epidemic has made its appearance among Mr Boothby's dogs" was a statement which appeared in three probably more, but certainly three of the London journals lost j ear) Everybody, I suppose, is by this time familiar with Mr Hall Caines castle in the Isle of Man I protest that if some genie should transport me to that very desirable residence tomorrow I could find my ni) blindfold to the donors keep without any difficult;, The lights and the Rockefeller of the future will be the men who have had on the taste of the town with their loin units and it is not difficult to foresee the time when the illustrious author of The yellow Vstcnsk ' will be appointed,
