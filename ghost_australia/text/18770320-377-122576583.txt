Hearing the desperate fight of life But as a far- off' pleasant noise Come, ere on thy bold way thou start, While not a cloud thy future mars, And still that wildly-beating heart SUnder the stars. A stormy prime, eo'beautiful With fierce delight, ecstatic pain, Spelding and being spent; no lull, '-j 6-6 ret, no want of loss or gain Ere with tired feet thou come to tread The blood-stained field of ended wars, Pause: bow the glories of thy head Under the stars; A heavy time of brows discrowned, Of hanging hands and feeble knees, With piteous pale ghosts haunted round, And longings.for impossible ease Ah, beat to more like wounded bird 'Against Fate's iron prison bars ! When all sounds cease, God's voice is heard S U U der'th stars. Soon, oo66 will come the supreme hour ,When like a painted show life seems, Of pertme tof remembered flower, Or~ear dead faces seen in dreams.
