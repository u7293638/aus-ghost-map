? THE PlitlsrciPASi. BOY. Act I. Bv L. Zakgwill. To sit out a play is a loore ; to sit out a. dance demands less patience. Even when you do it merely to prevent, your partner dancing with-you, it is the less disagreeable alternative. But it sometimes makes you giddier than galoping. Frank Rcdhill, lost liis head, a. well-built head, i-ouipletely through indulging in it; and without tin.' head to look after it the heart Minn goes. He held Lucy's" "liPtt'e hand in his hot clasp. She wished' he would get himself "-loves large i-nough not to split at the thumbs","" and felt quite affectionate towards the. deal-, untidy bov. As a woman almost out of her teens, she could permit herself a little motherly feeling for a lad who had hut just attained his majority. The little, thing loul;ed very sweet in ti detiiuro dress of null's veiling, which Frank would liny described as white robes." For lie was only an undergraduate. Nome undergraduates are past masters in the art. and science of woman ; Hut Ki-.-uik was not in that set. Nor did he herd with tho athletic, who drift mainly into the unpaid magistrate. nor with the worldly, who usually go in "for the c.hnrch. lie was a reading man. Only he did not .stick to the curriculum, but fed himself on t.lio cnnivits of the pools, and thirsted to redeem mankind. So he got a second class. Hut this is anticipating'. Perhaps Lncy hart been antieipai iiiLi' loo. At any rate she went Ihrotiirh the scene as admirably as if she had ruhe.o'sed for it.

Ho Luuy dccJaime 1 one of Aihalie's terrible speeches in a way that enthralled those who understood it, and. made (hose who didn't, enthusiastic. • The applause did not seem to gratify the (.'tiardiau Angel as much as usual. Lucy wondered how much rshc had seen, and, disliking useless domestic discussion, extorted a pro- mise of secrecy from her lover before they parted. He did not. euro about keeping anything from his fallr.r — especially something of which his approval was dubious. Still, all's fair and houonrable in love,—or love makes it seem so. Frank took a. solemn view of engagement. and embraced Lncy in his general scheme for the redemption of mankind. He felt, she was n. sacred as well as a precious charge, and he promised himself to attend to her spiritual salvation in so far as her pure instincts needed guidance. He directed her reading in bulky letters bearing the Oxford post-mark. Meantime, Lucy disapproved of his neofc ties. She thought he would be even nicer with a loving wife to look after his wardrobe. Act II. When Frank achieved the iudis- tinction of a second class, as pi-enia^ turel.y- revealed, he went to Canada and "became a farm, pupil. It was not that his physique warranted the wort,- but there seemed no way in the old country^of; making - enough money to. marry Lucy (much less to redeemmankind) on. He was .suffering, too, at the moment, from a disgust with" the schools, and a sentimental yearning to " return to nature The parting with Lucy was bitter, but he carried her bright' image in his heart, and wrote to her by every mail. In Canada he did not look at a we; man, as the saying goes; true, the opportunities were scanton. the lonely log- farm.

A, suspicion tlmtiie hieked;worldly wisdom dawned, upon him for the first' time, as he rang'the lifilT.Poor lii-tle Lucy 1 Well, whatever she had gone through, the bright days were come, at last. The ocean which had severed; them for so many weary moons no, longer rolled between tliern—thank; flod, only the panels of the street door divided them now. In another, instant that darling head—no move the haunting elusive phantom of dream would be upon his breast. Then, the door opened, the thought Unshed upon him that she might not be in—the idea of waiting a single moment longer for her turned him sick. But his fears vanished at the encouraging expression on the faee of the maid servant who opened the door. "Hiss Grny's npstairs," she mumbled without waiting for him to speak. And, all inlelligentrcllectiou swamped bv a great wave of joy, he followed her up a narrow flight of stairs, and passed eagerly into a room to which she pointed. It was a bright, cosy room, prettily furnished, and a cheerful fire crackled on the hear! h. There were books and flowers about, anil engravings on the walls. The little round table was laid for tea. liverything smiled " welcome." But these details only gradually pellet rat ed Frank's consciousness—for the moment all he saw was that tihr was not there. Then ho became aware of the lire, and moved involuntarily towards il. and hehl his hands over it, for they were almost numbed "with cold. Straightening himself again, he was startled by his own while lace in the glass. He ga/.ed o.t it dreamily, and beyond it towards the foiding-doors, which lead into au adjoining room. His eyes fixed themselves fascinated upon these reflected doors, and strayed no more. It was through them that she would come. Suddenly a dreadful thought occurred to him. When she came through those doors, what would bci tlw effect of his presence upon her Would not the sudden shock, joyful; though it was, upset the fragile little' beauty 'f Had he not even heard of people dying from foy r Why ha.d he not prepared heivfor iiis.i'eturu, uf only to the timest, extent i The suspicion that he lacked worldly wisdom ,ined in foi'ce. Tumultous suggestions of retreat crossed his mind—but before he could move, the folding loors m the mirror flew apart, and a radiant image dashed lightly through them- It was a vision of dazzling splendour that made Ins eyes blink— a beautiful glittering figure iu tights and tinsel, the prancing prince of pantomime. For an mfiultesiaial fraction of a second. Frank had the horror of the thought that he had come into the wroug house. " Good evening. George, the Prince cried; " I had almost given you up. Great God ! Was the voice, indeed :Lucy's? Frank grasped.at the man tel, sick and blind, the world tumbling abovit his ears. The suspicion that he lacked worldly wisdom became: a certainty. Slowly he turned his head •to face tl\e wav.es of dazzling colour that danced before'-lns"dizzy eyes The Prince s outstretched band dropped snddenlv. A startled shriek broke -from the painted bps.
