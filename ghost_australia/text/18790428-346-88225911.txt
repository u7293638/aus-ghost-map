THE GHOST ENTERTAINMENT AT SANDHURST. (To the Editor of the Bemlbjo Advertiser.) Sir,—Having noticed in to-day's issue your insertion of Medcalfe's letter, I beg you will kindly insert my reply thereto, which appeared in to-dav's A<je, aud oblige, yours faithfully, JU'AKUV K1SAJJ. City Club Hotel, Sandhurst, 2Gdi April. The following is the reply referred to:— To the Editor of the Age.—Sir,—In yesterday's Age I noticed a paragraph relative to the cases which came into court for the recovery of accounts for advertising and printing, etc., for my ghost en teitainment, ordered byJIr. IU:dcalfe. To-day I see_ there is a letter in which he states that it "simply resolves itself into a breach of contract." It may be very simple in his estimation, but not in mine, as his conduct has cost me upwards of t'SO, which I have been oompelled to pay through his misrepresentations to those who gave him credit here that he Was inertly acting as my agent, and not on his own account, the proprietors of the papers stating in court that if the}' had thought it was for Mcdcalfe they would not have given him credit for a shilling advertisement. I had no idea of any account being unpaid, as he has misled me altogether. Mecicalfe states that "it will come before the court shortly." When I catch hiin it will, and in a manner that he will not relish.— Yours, etc., D'AliCY Beau. Sandhurst, 25th April, New Insolvent,—Henry Ferris, of Eehuca, laborer.
