His Angel.* CHAPTER IX.—"YOU HAVE BEEN MY FATHER." BY HENRY HERMAN. Author of "Eagle Joe," "Scarlet Fortune," "For Old Virginia," and joint author of "He Fell Among Thieves," &c.;, &c.; While the black thunderclouds of the exposure of her father's shame were rolling nearer and threatening Miss Angel's peace the young lady was in the happiest and busiest of moods. An outfit had to be ordered, and for the first time in her young life Miss Eershaw took an interest, a great interest, in female finery and milliners' artifices. She considered that, in going abroad, she was leaving her country, which was her own home, and where she could dress as she pleased, for one where the foibles of oeremonioas society had to be taken into account, and where a sop had to be thrown to the Cerberus of fashion, if she desired to associate with people who were her equals in station. She had shrewd common sense enough to understand that whilst in New Tork and the States she was Miss Kershaw of Angelica city —a personality whom most people knew, and who oould afford to dress as simply or as oddly as she pleased—in Europe the customs and habits of society would have to be considered, and she would not be able, for instanoe, to go to a dinner party in her ordinary walking dress without attracting unoharitable notice. Much as she disliked it, therefore, at first, she had to hand herself over to the tender meroieß of the fashionable dressmaker. But appetite comes with eating; and whether it was that the enthusiasm of the modiste about gorgeous gownß, and mantles, and what not, was contagious, or that the young lady had never really understood what delight the female mind oan find over the selection of materials, the all-important decisions anent out and shape, and especially over that superlatively exciting occupation of trying on, Miss Angel's opinions about frooks and frook builders gradually, but surely, underwent a complete change, and she was as happy over her newly discovered excitement as a ohild over a new toy. Miss Kershaw was closeted with her philo sopher and guide, the fashionable milliner and dressmaker, deep in the study of the intrioaoies of the last Parisian edicts relating to frooks, when Hubert Underwood was admitted below, and immediately proceeded to the library, where he hoped to find Daniel Eershaw. The young man was pale. His eyes wan dered about the room restlessly, and his hands trembled. Mr. Kershaw happened to be momentarily absent, and to the young jour nalist the few minutes that elapsed before the millionaire entered the library appeared in terminable. The old pioneer at once noticed the pecu liarly nervous condition of the usually so calm and unexcitable young man, and immediately faced him with the remark: "Thar's somethin' gone crooked, boy, I know. What nit?" ♦'Mr. Kershaw," answered Underwood, "I had intended, if possible, to spare you the worry and annoyanoe which are bound to arise from the disclosure I have to make to you; but matters have taken suoh a turn that I deem it my duty to tell you what has happened." "Holdhard," exolaimed the old man. "I guess what yew're goin' to tell me ain't as sweet as maple sugar, an' if yew don't mind I'll sit down to it. Now, my boy," he con tinued, seating himself in his big armohair, "yew can start, an' run, an' race, an' have the whole length o' the road." " My father, the father of whom I have such reason to be ashamed," continued Hubert with an anxious tremor thrilling in his voioe, " is in New York. He has been in flew York for some days." It was Daniel Eershaw's turn now to feel his nerves tingling with an unacoustomed trepidation. He had faced dangers of all kinds over and over again; he had laughed gaunt death in the face on soores of occasions; but shame, and especially shame and distress to his Angel, afflighted him. A ghost had haunted him for two or three days past—a ghost oalled up by Michael Turner's face, which he had seen from his window—the ghost of Hellfire Joe, that scowled at him of a night, and glared at him from odd corners of his dreams, and pointed with olaw-like fingers to its torn and swollen neck, and cried, " What right have you with my daughter? Give up my daughter! Tell her that you killed me!" " Waal," he said slowly, " that ain't news as one would print, an' buy a frame for, an' hang in the parlour; but I guess it wos to be some day or other. I reckon he wants money, an' he'll have to have it." " I have given him money," retorted Under wood bitterly, " but it is like droplets thrown into the ocean. The more you give the more he wastes in debauohery, and the more he wants. That would be little, but he has just escaped from gaol, and there i 3 no orime that he would not commit when in drink or to get drink. He made a great show of being anxious to reform, and very nearly sucoeeded in throw ing dust in my eyes. Luckily he betrayed him self, and he betrayed himself over a real or pretended grudge against you." " Agin me?" oried the old man in astonish ment. " What's he got agin me ?" The whole story had to be told—the sore had to be laid fully bare. "He says," continued Hubert with slow nervous deliberation, "that you hanged his partner, Hellfire Joe, that you nearly hanged him, that Miss Kershaw is Hellfire Joe's daughter, and that he will not allow her to remain in ignorance of her father's name." The old frontiersman had risen slowly, with blanching face, and stonily hardening features, silent and grim. Gradually the heaving bosom swelled, the lips opened, showing the teeth hard set, and a fierce solemnity, the solemnity of outraged justice, shone in hia eyes. "Mike Turner yewr father!" hissed Ker shaw, " an' he'll tell my Angel that her father wos a murderer, an* that I hanged him! Not much ho won't, I reckon. Whar is he ?" he demanded nearly savagely. " I have him safe for the moment," answered Underwood, aghast at the impression his announcement had made upon the millionaire. "He is under look and key in a small hotel in Canal-street,' and the proprietor is keeping watoh and guard over him." " But yew cayn't keep him thar for ever," cried the pioneer. " Let's keep our heads 0001, an' see that the primin's dry. It won't do now to go to Yewrup, an* leave him heear. That would look cowardly, an' no man or devil shall ever say that Dan'l Kershaw wos afraid of him. It ain't yewr fault, my boy, that Oheesefaoe Mike is yewr father, any more than it's my Angel's fault that Hellfire Joe was hers." He had confessed the hard naked truth without knowing that he had confessed it; but, now that it was told, he felt the load of a millstone taken from his mind. For years he had jealously guarded the secret. Now another man shared it, the man of all others mo9t likely to shield, with the bulwark of Mb own life, her whom it threatened. And Hubert, knowing that his betrothed was of as lowly, as mean, and as despioable birth as himself, was so steeped in his love that he felt not even a tinge of added joy over the discovery which brought Angelioa Eershaw to a nearer level with himself. She wa3 not lowered a hair-breadth in his esteem, in his reverence, in his adoration. Only a tremorous pity, a tender sorrow that anointed his lovo and made it a trifle sorter and balmier. Not a remark, not an exclamation of surprise, escaped from his lips. His Angel was his Angel, and he would as lief have ohided a butterfly for having sprung from a chrysalis as have dreamed of deeming it a reproaoh that she was as low-bom as himßelf. " I guess yew*ve got to let me handle that father o' yewrn," continued Daniel Kershaw. " It ain't to be reckoned as yew'd keep the grip on him another man could. He ain't quite a dog-gone fool, Oheesefaoe Mike ain't. If he's jest escaped from pris'n he knows that he can be sent baok agin. He may think that his own son wouldn't do that, but he's tasted samples of my pepper afore, an' I guess his mouth is smartin' yet. Thar's two things to be did. Mike Turner's got to be made to keep a olose tongue, and "—here the old man's voice dropped, and a tremor vibrated through it—" my Angel's got to know that I ain't her father." " But surely " exolaimed Hubert. "Oh, don't yew go an' frighten yourself," interrupted Eershaw. "I ain't goin* to tell her nothen about Hellfire Joe an' his gallows. Thar ain't nothen to be gained by that. But I count as I got to be honest at last,*an' tell her as I've stole her love, an' beg her to forgive me—to forgive me." The voioe became softer and nearly tearful as he went on. It was the voioe of a poor repentant sinner proclaiming his hope of a pardon to come. " Yes, my boy," he repeated, " I've stole her love; an' what's more," he added with a stern resolution, "I mean to keep it, Ood bein* willin', all the days of my life. Now yew go down town, an' if it can be did, yew bring that father o' yewrn to me heear. If it eayn't be did, yew come baok an' let me know, an' I'll go down to him." "It's ony right," he muttered when the young man was gone. "It wasn't fair to start with, an' Qod knows I've tried to fight agin it, an' tell her of it this many a year past." The young lady was in a pretty pout at being disturbed. "What a bother, daddie dear!" she ex olaimed as she oame into the room, radiant with the glow of agreeable excitement. " Mrs. Mortimer is upstairs, and her assistant, and she has to go back nearly immediately, and she oan't wait." •' Sit down heear, my Angel," he said softly. " Never mind the dressmaker for a few minits." "A few minutes?" she cried, pursing her pretty lips. " A few minutes ?" " Yes, a few minita," he replied. " Perhaps ten—perhaps fifteen. Yew'll give them to yewr daddie, won't yew, if he asks yew?" " Why, you're as serious as a judge, daddie dear," rejoined Miss Angel, seating herself on a footstool at his feet and looking up into his eyes. "What it the matter? What has happened?" He took her head between his two hands and kissed her upon the forehead, long and fervently. "I love yew so, my Angel," he breathed. " I believe I'd die if I were forbid to love yew. I ain't much of a hand at sayin' whys, nor wherefores, nor hows, but I know that yew've settled jest heear—jest on my heart, an'growed thar." " I know this, daddie darling," she whispered surprisedly. " I have known it ever since I've been able to understand what it is to be loved." " An* yew love me, my dear," he continued in the same tenderly vibrating half-broken voice. " Yew love me as a good gell ought to love her father. Tell me, dearie, do yew love me becos yew think I'm yewr father, or do yew love me becos it's yewr nature, an' yew cayn't help lovin' me ?" She looked up at him with her big dark eyes brimming with her heart's full devotedness. " What a question to ask, daddie ?" she said smilingly. "I love you because I love you. Beoause you're the dearest daddie in the world; beoause not to love you would be impossible." " Ah, would it ?" he retorted. •• Suppose— jest suppose—l wosn't yewr father, Snppose yewr father wos dead an' gone long ago, an 1 I've taken his place, an' given out as I woa yewr father." ,.,. His eyes were glued upon her as he spoke. He watched every movement of her features, as if all his heaven were staked upon her reply. " I don't want to suppose any Buch thing," she answered. " What is the good of it?" "Answer me," he pleaded. "Suppose it ♦ The right of publication of " Hlb Angel" has boon purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company, Limited. wos. Suppose I wosn't yewr father— how would it be then?" "Why, if it were so," she replied with drooped eyes, and the fingers of one hand nervously moving across the open palm of the other, " you have been my father—l know no other. I can remember no other—l can think of no other." " But if I had told yew lies," he went on in a hoarse stoniness —" if I had told yew stories that wosn't truo, becos I had to say somethin', yew know, when yew asked questions—an' yew did ask a lot, yew know —all sorts of 'em— about yewr mother, an' about things—an' I, I told them one after another, an' one wickeder than another. Becos, yew see, my dearie," he cried in an agony of confession, " I am not yjwr father, an* I've lied to yew all this while. An' now it's had to come out, an' yew'll despise me." fie tamed his face aside and buried it in his hands. She, slowly and gently, and with the tears of piteous sympathy welling in her eyes and rolling over her cheeks, drew his fingers aside from where they rested, and encircling his neck with her soft arms, pressed her face against his, sobbing as if her heart-strings were over strained in their effort to make sweet music "No, daddiedarling," she cried. "Never, daddie darling—never, now in this life which is yours—never, now or hereafter. You not my father ? There is only one for me beside you— the Master in heaven. A thousand times more niy father now than you ever could have been." And kissing him again and again in such holy embrace as a daughter may give to her parent, she laid her head on his bosom, and the sturdy pioneer wept with her as though they both were children. She pulled out her handkerchief and dried hit eyes and hers at the same time. "Listen to me, my Angel," he whispered. " I'll have it off my chest—as much of it, at any rate, as yew need be told." A shiver of self-reproach went through him at that moment, as he reflected that a portion at least of the dread facts would have to be concealed from her. "Yew wob a tiny wee babby,"he went on slowly and stolidly, "when yewr father died— jest about 3 year old—an' yew had no one in the wide wide world to give yew as much as a drop o' water—no father, no mother, no sister, no brother, no nobody. I knowed yewr father. He wo« not a very good man, but it ain't my place heear to say a word agin him afore yew, his daughter. Tew wos the prettiest babby that I ever seed, an' the moment I set my eyes on yew I took to yew, an' yew took to me. Yew could barely toddle then, an' I wos as pleased as a squaw over a new red blanket to have a little thing like yew erowin' at me when I cum home from the mountins or from prairie loafin'. An' then yew growed, an' the more yew growed the more yew got to be a need to me, an' I would rather have done without my pipe, an' my whisky, fifty times ay, than without yew. An' then yew got to be old enough to talk, an' to ask about things, an' then the lies had to begin, far yew called me daddie, an' I didn't like to say nay to that—it would have hurt me to say nay to that Then all the folks about called yew Kershaw'B little wench, an' I didn't say nay to that either; an' the bigger yew growed, the prettier yew growed, an' yew got to be jest a bit of my heart like, an* a man might as easy have out a slice o' that oat as yew. Then I got rioh, an' the gold earn tumblin' in, waggint fall, an' I wos glad it earn. I said to myself, that's all for my Angel; an' that pleased me, yew know, an' made me work harder, 'cos I had yew, my dearie, to work for. An' yew growed quite a lady, an' so hensum, an' so lovin' an' so kind to me; an' all the people loved yew, an' I wos so proud that they did love yew, an' though I often did think of tellin' yew, I never had the toeart to do it till now. An' now I have told yew, an' yew haven't called me names, an' yew've kissed me, an' I'm happier than ever I wos, 'oos I've told yew what yew ought to have knowed years agone." He raised her and drew her to his breast, and enfolded her slight frame with his great strong arms, and pressed her to his heart, and neither of them uttered a whisper for the space of a minute or two. "Do not speak of this again, daddie darling," she breathed. " I want to know no more about it. I am doubly your ohild, for now my sense of gratitude is awakened, and I am beginning to feel how much I owe to your love. But for you I might be a poor, wretched, forlorn waif of the prairies—a straw east before the winds—and here I am rich, respected, beloved, and cared for. I have not yet been able to arrive at a full appreciation of my debt to you; but I will soon, daddie dear; I will. But I'll love you all the more, it that be possible. I'm a fright," she exclaimed with changed countenance, jumping up and regarding herself in the mirror, "and Mrs. Mortimer will think that you've been scolding me, and have made me cry. I don't care," she added brightly, smoothing her tresses and cooling her glowing face with her handkerchief; •' let her think what she likes." She blew a kiss to him as she paused for a moment at the door. " God bless you, daddie darling t" she whis pered, and was gone. Gone like a soft breeze that has cooled the burning face. Gone like a bounteous shower that has refreshed the sun-scorched plain. Gone like blessed charity that leaves its happi ness in its wake. Gone as love does go, when it has brought life and hope, and has promised to return. The pioneer was sitting in his armchair dreamily, as he had never remembered himself before. A doubt still battled in his mind. Ought Ito have told her all ? he deliberated with himself. Ought Ito tell her still ? No, no, no, no! came the answer of his conscience olear as a clarion; you must not break her young heart, and blast all her life with the cankering thought that her father was an assassin. At that moment young Underwood appeared at the door, paler even than he had been earlier in the morning. "What's the sign now?" asked Eershaw. *' Is thar a painther loose ?". "No," gasped the young man, "but a creature that's far worse. My father has got away again." "Got away!" exclaimed the pioneer. " Waal!" "He has nearly murdered the landlord of the hotel," continued Underwood. "He made a ghastly horrible sling-shot by filling a heavy tumbler with the iron tops screwed off from the fire-irons, and tying the lot in a handkerchief. He lay in wait behind the door for the poor man, and when the latter entered to give him his luncheon, he struok him a fearful blow over the back of the head, breaking the tumbler into half-a-dozen pieces, and fracturing the skull. It is doubtful whether or not the wounded man will live, and in the hurry and skurry my father got clean away." " Waal, boy, what do yew propose to do ?" aßked Kershaw. " Heaven only knows," replied the journalist. " There'll be a trial now, and an exposure, and Misa Angelica may hear all about it, for the old villain will certainly not hold his tongue. 0 God," he cried, "is it a sin to wish one's own father dead ?"
