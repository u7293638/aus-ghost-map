tercets ot the ii bolo community that tho ministerial ranks should bo recruited from the best educated classes But though I nin better able than I was on my arrival to uudeistand the causes which account for the regrettable phenomenon i et none the less serious are the fact and its mipoit nor is the situation bettered b\ the thought that the causes aie of a nature which w II not be easily

strength and stability for the Church m thrs land Eiery true lendei of nus«iouaiy enterprise knolls nell that his eftorts must bo directed to the raising by-and by of a narrie nuiustry-and the same principle is true as applied to the colonial Church The amount of «elf sacrifice winch such supply mi oh es is the measure of the reality and progress of the religious lrf o of the people I need not tepeat what I have said in my last address on tins oi on any othei topit Enough to stato here that one more y eai s experience in the Diocese leads mo by no means to modify, except by M ay or emphasis, most of ii hat I then said The e\ptession of the hope m n hich I indulged last yeal that one day might seo a TJnneisity established ior Queensland to uhich wo might affiliate a Church ot

archdeaconry was not actually filled until after the Synod had risen, for though I had some time sought to lay its responsibilities on one who was in my judgment by no means unfitted to sustain them, yet he at first shrank from the acceptance of the same. Ultimately he acceded to my wish, and at my next visit to Toowoomba it was my privilege to admit the Rev. Thomas Jones to the archdeaconry of the Darling Downs.

The object of the bequest, briefly stated, is to promote the mission of the Church in the remoter parts of the diocese of Brisbane. The disposal of this money, both as to its apportionment and as regards amounts and method, is absolutely at the dis- cretion of the trustees, and subject only to this, that the grantees are to be in Holy Orders of the Church of England, and holding the license of the Bishop of the diocese, and that the scene of their labour is to be the remoter parts of the diocese. There can be no manner of doubt, therefore, that it is absolutely within the discretion of the trus- tees to employ an adequate portion of the fund for the support of a missionary Bishop in the remoter parts of the diocese of Brisbane, the only point which the trustees would have to consider would be whether they would rather be guided by the Bishop's judgment of that he, from his present knowledge of the diocese as the result of his ob- servation and experience deemed best, or whether they would prefer to strike out some path of their own. The Diocesan Council have, as you have seen, come to the conclusion announced in their report. Further than this it would have been scarcely respectful for them to go, having due re- gard to the position of the trustees. Speaking under the full sense of that responsi- bility which belongs to my office, I will only place on record my distinct conviction that such a method of application as I have foreshadowed would be giving the fullest effect to the desires of the testatrix, having regard to the fact that the spread of religion is the real object of the bequests; that no other conceivable expen- diture of the money would at this moment be productive of anything like the same aid to religion and to the work of the Church in this diocese: nay it would do more than any- thing else to further the founding of a new Bishopric. If I were able to persuade the trustees to accompany me in my coming pastoral tour to Winton no further argu- ment would be needed. In order to retain their legitimate control their grant might be made triennially. With every respect I com- mend these thoughts both to the Synod and to the trustees under the will of the late Mrs. Peattie, who have in their hands an opportunity of doing a work of the greatest im- portance if, with the true spirit of comprehensive statesmanship, they rise to the greatness of the occasion.

of piondiug funds for tho extension of the work of the Chuich, and for foundrng the Cathedral, but this ti ¡is all now aggressive norh, and did not touch ei.rsh.ng fiscal arraugements I knew rrorn my piedecessoi before leating Englaud that thero was no fund applicable for either pulposo, so the creation of the Brshop of Brisbane s fund (foi Mission Clergy and Church Extension) and the Cathedral Fund woie obviously tho first thing to be done, and dono it ti as accordingly But as to the genoial finance of the diocese, and in view of the tact that a great part of tho financial year had mu out before the charge of tho dioceso tías committed to me, I felt that the treasure! was the natuinl chaucelloi of the exchequer, and would bring foi ward his otvh budget As this, however, was done chiefly at a meeting of a cominittco specially appointed for the purpose, the Chinch public at largo woio not m possession of the facts, and no such budget appears on the face of tho proceedings of last öy noa Such bony the case, smco the now treasurer has but just entered upon his M ork, and as the mattei ot one of considerable impor- tance to tiro well-being of the diocese, it is well that I should briefly summanso tho facts, which churchmen have to cousrdei Li tho financial year lefoned to (1SS5 G) tho general contributions to all diocesan purposes and the innous funds wore only £397 103 6d (including £3S 3s given to tho Bishop of Busbaue's fund), and all offertory collecbous for such pulposos amounted to £215 17s 4d (in- cluding -bli!) ICs 3d for the Bishop of Brisbane's tund), making a total of £013 7s lOd or, if you excludo tho Cathedral Fund and the Bishop of Brisbane's fund, iv hich were new, tho total con tnbuted to the dioceso, including olteitones, was £113 The total contribution to oxcoutito ex penses thrs yeal was £o2Ss Cd ,whüo tho cost of the office n as at least fit o tunes that sum I exclude, of couise, from the crtegory the pay- ments by tho clergy to the Supeiannuatron Tuud such payments being of the natuioof anrnsuronco rather than as a contubution to the diocesan funds No doubt the tordnuco of tho seo and the irrten al bettteeu the two adnmns tintions, added to tho effects of the four years' drought, may be held m a mensuro to account foi any temporary subsidence on tho part of the futid but only m a measure, for I irnd that 111 îefereuce to the two piecodiug y cars scarce any bettor record is gil en-iGoô ¿s Cd and £608 la Cd benig tho totals of each year respectitelj It must bo that einnehmen

J. E. Dickson, that the value of his services must by no means bo estimated by his attendance at council. Naturally enough in his rocent position of Acting Chief of H.M.

Brethren,-I have detained you too long, and I thank you for your attention. An all important era is this in the history of our diocese. The wholo Church is hero by representatives to consider how it can best improvo its organisation and remove all obstacles to its life, its progress, its unity, that it may the better fulfil its essential and characteristic duty of exhibiting on earth a divine order. Tho work is great and requires the concentration of all our powers iii a greater and more united effort than we have yet mado. I am tho moro earnestly anxious to see this in a fair way of accomplishment. It would certainly bo a cause of much thankfulness to me if during my tenure of this rosponsiblo post the dioceso could so have been brought into working order, that when the pastoral staff of the diocese passed into younger and abler hands each successor might find something like organisation and order, winch is a necessary condition of effective work. While then I heartily thank both clergy and laity for tho cordial support which they have given to their Bishop, and while I hail the im- provements which I have noted as a whisper aud an earnest of better things to come, yet the stato of our Church in its mam features is for too nearly the antitype of the scene in Ezokiel's vision. Tho valley was full of bones, an'd lo ! they were very dry. Be it ours, thon, to see repeated the sequel of that story ; to lift up over the dry bones the living voice of prophecy. Let the hearts of earnest men -to whom that article of the faith is a Uve one-I boliove in the Holy Ghost, Life giver ; let such, with aU tho might of au. availing intercession, with all its inspiring and impolling force, send up unitedlythat prophetic prayer, " Como from the four winds, 0 breath, and broatho upon these slain that they may live." Already thero is a uoiso and a ''Ehaiiug,, among the dry bones. You havo but to persevere un- tiringly through evil report and good report. Tho increase will not bo withheld. Tho breath of a new life will como into them. They will live and stand upon their feet an exceeding great arruj-. Mr. Justico HAJtDrxa briefly moved tho adoption of tho address, and asked that it bo printed. The Hon. J. R. DICKSON, in seconding' the motion, said the thanks of tho Synod were duo to tho Bishop for his nblo and interesting address, which would bo interesting1 to every Ohnrcliman throughout Australia. It would be received with satisfaction as a very ahio exposition undjwwis of the work of the Church in this dioceso dulong the time it had been under Dr. Webber's ablo administration. Ho trusted the address would bo printed aud circu- lated. The motion was unanimously agreed to. In roplj- to a question by Mr. Drow as to how the various points in tho Bishop's address could be dealt with by the council, his LOETJSHIP said it would ho inconvenient to discuss the Bishop's address as EUCII, but it would perhaps ho de- sirable that any recommendation thrown out in the address Bhould f orm the subject of a motion to he put on the paper. Archdeacon Jones, Rev. James Matthews, Hon. G. King, and Mr. W. L. G. Drew, wero appointed a conunittee of elections and qualifi- cations. Several notices of motion wcro given for tlio following day. JMr. W. BARRETT presented n petition from the Church of England members residing in Sandgate, in connection with tho church ac- commodation there, praying that certain land may be conveyed to local trustees for the purposo of borrowing money on the security of the said land. It was agreed to consider the petition the following day. Tlie report of the Diocesan Council was presented, and its consideration was mado an order of the day for to-day. Tlie Rev. E. 0. OSBORNE, who has recently returned from a visit to England, said the members of tho Synod would no doubt ho pleased to know that just before ho left homo it was his privilege to pay a visit to Bishop Hale, whoso health had ven' much improved since he left tho diocese. When Bishop Halo went homo lie lind a serious illness, which for some months kept him. to his house. When he visited lum at Olifton, howover, he was very much better. Bishop Hale still took a lively interest in the Church work of the Brisbano diocese, and lip inquired particularly of all that had been done hero since ho left. Ho also asked individually after all the leading synodsmen of tho diocese and asked to be re- membered kindly to nil those with whom ho had been brought into contact here. Bishop Webber said he was sure the Synod was very much obliged to Mr. Osborne for con- veying to them the remembrance of their former Bishop. Nono of them need be afraid but that Bishop Hale would retain an affection for his old dioceso. The Bishop then pronounced the benediction, and the sitting terminated. In tlie evening a special service was held in St. John's pro-Cathedral, when the Rev. B. R. Wilson delivered to a large congregation an impressive sermon, founded ou a text chosen from the Epistle to the Ephesians iv., 14, lo, and 1S. Tho object of tho apostle, lie said, fell into two grooves. First of nil, when he pic- tured tho Church in tho figure of a temple, when all his similes were takeii from a biiilding where Christ, in his divine nature, was repre- sented as tho master builder; and, secondly, there were passages which pictured to us tho Church in tho figure of a living body. In further exposition of Paul's meaning, tho > preacher likened tho body of man to the templo of God. Speaking of the present Synod time, he said that where thoBishop of the church was surrounded by tlie clergy of his diocese, they had a temple of God in a united church. Tho Synod in itself was a grand witness of the fact that they wero gathered together as a completo Cliurch in themselves, complete in their privi- leges, and complete therefore in their duties and responsibilities. Their Ufe carne to them from Christ tlie head, the master builder, who had placed them here, whether as ministers or laymen, or members of parochial councils, to do some special work in detail for Him, which would help to carry out the scheme of ' tlie whole. The preacher urged each one, in whateversphero, to complete hisportioncarefully and well, and, as it were, each to elaborate his own separate leaf of tho capital of a column. In the courso of his further remarks the rev. gentleman alluded to a reference mado in the Bishop'3 address to tho desirableness of establishing a fund for the construction of » grand cathedral to the honour and glory of the Almighty, and made nn earnest appeal to his hearers to do their best towards the accom- plishment of snob, an objeot, putting aside all selfish ideas which might present themselves in view of tiio impossibility of the work being completed for generations to come. The monthly general meeting of the Bris- bane Chamber* of Commerce will be held this afternoon. The principal business on tho pape.1 is the reception of the report of the committeo appointed to consider the. constitu- tion of the Marine Board of this colony, and ballotting for new members.
