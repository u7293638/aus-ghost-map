Morning broke in the East! A new day ] dawned upon tho silent sea, and on the world | of light and sound. The sunrise crossed the j waters by a path of gold, and fell upon the golden raiment of the Wanderer as he slept, making it blaze like a living fire. As the sun touched him, the prow of a black ship i stole swiftly round the headland, for the wind I was fair in her wake, and the oarsmen drove ber well with the oars. Any man who saw her would have known her to be a vessel of the j merchants of Sidon—the most cunning people and the greediest of gain—for on her prow were two big-headed shapes of dwarfs, with gaping mouths and knotted limbs. Such gods as those were worshipped by the Sidonians. She was now returning from Albion, an isle beyond the pillars of Hercules and the gates of the great sea, where much store of tin is found; and she bad rich merchandise on board. On the half-deck beside the steersman j was the captain, a thin, keen- eyed sailor, who looked shoreward and saw the sun blaze on the golden armour of the Wanderer. They • were so far off that he could not see clearly what it was that glittered yellow, but all that glittered ycllowwas a lure for him, and gold drew him on as iron draws the bands of heroes. So he bade the helmsman steer straight in, for the sea was deep below the rock, and they all saw a man lying asleep in golden armour. They whispered together, laughing silently, and then sprang ashore, taking with them a rope of twisted ox hide, a hawser of the ship, and a strong cable of byblus, the papyrus plant. On these ropes they cast a loop and a running knot, a lasso for throwing, so that they might capture the man in safety from a distance. With these in their hands they crept up the cliff, for their purpose was to noose the man in golden armour, and drag him on board their vessel, and carry him to tne mouth of the river of Egypt, and there sell him for a slave to the King. For the Sidonians, who were greedy of everything, loved nothing better than to catch free men and women, who might be purchased by mere force or guile, and then be sold again for gold and silver and cattle. Many kings'sons had thus been captured by them, and had seen the day of slavery in Babylon, or Tyre, or Egyp tian Thebes, and bod died sadly, far from the Argive land. So the Sidonians went round warily, and creeping' in silence over the short grassand thyme towards the Wanderer, were soon as near him as a child could throw a stone. Like shepherds who seek to net a sleeping lion they came cunningly; yet not so cunningly but that the Wanderer heard them through his dreams, and tnrned and sat up, looking around him hall awake. But as he woke the noose fell about his neck and over his arms, and they drew it hard, and threw him on his back.' Before they could touch him he was on his' feet again, crying his war- cry terribly, the cry that shook the towers of Llium, and ne rushed - upon them, clutching at bis sword hilt. The. men who were nearest him and hadhold of the rope let it full from their hands and fled, but the others swung behind him, and dragged with all their force. If his arms had been free so that he might draw his sword it would have. §one ill with them, many as they were, for the idonians have no stomach for sword blades; but hiB arms were held in the noose. Yet they did not easily master him; but, as those who had fled came back, and they all laid hands on' the rope together, they overpowered him by main force at last, and hauled mm, Btep by step, till he stumbled on a rock and fell. Then they rushed at him, and threw themselves all upon his body, and bound him with ropes in cunning sailor knots. But the booty was dearly won, and they did not all return alive; for he crushed one man with his knees till the breath left him, and the thigh of another he broke with a blow of his foot. But at last bis strength was spent, and they had him like a bird in a snare; so, by might and main, they bore him to their ship, an<T threw him down on the foredeok of the vessel. There they mocked him, though they were half afraid; for even now he was terrible. Then they hauled up the sail again, and sat down to the oars. The wind blew fair for the mouth of the Nile and the slave-market of Egypt. The wind was fair, and their hearts were light, for tbey had been among the first of their people to deal with the wild tribes of the island Albion, and had bought tin and gold for African seasbells and rude glass beads from Egypt. And now, near the very end of their adventure, they had caught a man whose armour and whose body were worth a king's ran60in. It was a lucky voyage, they said, and the wind was fair ! The rest of,the journey was long, but in well known waters. They passed by Cephalonia and the rock of .ligilips, and wooded Zaoyh thus, and Same, sua all of those'isles lie was the lord, whom they were now selling into captivity. But he lay still, breathing heavily," and he stirred but once—that was when they, neared Zaoynthus. Then lie strained his head round with a mighty strain, and he saw the sun go down upon the heights of rocky Ithaca, for that last time of all. So the swift ship ran along the coast, slip ping by forgotten towns that died before his tory began. Past the Echinean isles, and the Elian shore, and pleasant Eirene they sped, and it was dusk ere they reached Ilarion. Deep night had fallen when they ran by Pylos; and the'light of the fires in the hall of Fisis tratns, the son of Xestor the Old, shone out across the sandy sea coast and the sea. But. when they were come near Malea, the south ernmost point of land, where two seas meet, there the storm snatched them, and drove them ever southwards, beyond Crete, towards the mouth of the Kile. They scudded along be fore the storm-wind, losing their reckoning, and rushing by island temples that showed like ghosts through the mist, and past havens which they oould not win. On they fled, and the men would gladly have lightened the ship by casting all the cargo overboard; but the captain watched the hatches with a sword and two bronze-tipped spears in his. hand. He would sink or swim with the ship ; he would go down with his treasure, or reach Sidon, the City of Blowers, and build a white house among the palms by the waters of Bostren, and never try the sea again. So he swore; and he would not let them cast the Wanderer overboard, as they desired, because he had brought bad luck. "He shall bring a good price in Tanis," cried tbecaptain. And at last the storm abated, and the Sido nians took heart, and were glad like men escaped from death; so they sacrificed and poured forth wine before the dwarf-gods on Hm prow of their vessel, and burned incense on their little altar. In their mirth, and to mock the Wanderer, they hung his sword and his skidd against the mash and his quiver and his ; bow they arrayed in tne fashion of a trophy; and they mocked him, supposing that he knew no word of their speech. But he knew it well, as be knew the speech of the people of Egypt; for he had seen tbe cities or many men, and hod spoken with captains and mercenaries from many a land in the great wars. The SidonianB, however, jibed and spoke freely before him, saying how they were bound for the rich city of Tanis, on the banks of the river of Egypt, and how the captain was minded to pay his toll to Pharaoh with the body and tbe armour of Wanderer. That he might seem the comelier, and a gift more fit for a King, the sailors slackened his bonds a little, and Drought him dried meat and wine, and he ate till his strength returned to him. Then he entreated them by signs to loosen the cord that bound his legs; for indeed his limbs were dead through the strength of the bonds, and his armour was eating into his flesh. At his prayer they took some pity of him and loosened his bonds again, and he lay upon his back, moving bis legs to and fro till bis strength came back. So they Bailed southward ever, through smooth waters and past the islands that lie like waterlilies in the midland sea. _ Many a strange sight they saw; vessels bearing slaves, whose sighing might be heard above the sigh ing of wind and water—young men and maidens of Ionia and Achai, stolen by slave traders into bondage; now they would touch at the white havens of a peaceful city; and again they would watch a smoke on the sea-' line all day, rising black into the heavens; but by nightfall the smoke would change to a great roaring fire from the beacons of a beleaguered island town; the fire would blaze on the masts of the ships of the besiegers, and show blood red on tneir soils, ana glitter on the gilded shields that lined the bulwarks of the ships. But the Sidonians never stopped till one night they anchored off a little isle that lies over against the mouth of the Nile. Off this isle they moored the ship and slept, most of them ashore. Then the Wanderer began to plot a way to escape, though the enterprise seemed desperate enough. He was lying in the darkness of the hold, sleeplesB and fsore with his bonds, while his guard watched under an awning in the moonlight on deck. They dreamed so little of his escaping that they visited him only by watches, now and again; and, as' it chanced, ' | the man whose turn it was to see that all was 1 | secure fell asleep. Many a thought went through the prisoner's mind, and now it seemed to him that the vision of the Goddess was only a vision of sleep, which came, as they said, through the false Gates of Ivory, and not through the Gates of Horn. So he was to live j in slavery after all, a king no lcnger, but a captive, toiling in the Egyptian mines of Sinai, or a soldier at a palace gate, till he died. Thus | he brooded, till out of the stillness came a thin, | faint, thrilling sound from the bow that hung against the mast over his head, the bow that he never thought to string again. There Was a noise of the singing of tho bow and of the - string, and the wordless song shaped itself thus in the heart of the Wanderer— * hoi the hour is nigh Ami the time to smite, When the foe shall fly From the arrow's flight ! Let tho bronze bite deep! Let the war-birds fly Upon them that sleep And are ripe to diet Shrill and low Do the grey shafts sing The Songof tlio Bow, The sound of Uie string ! Then the low music died into the silence, and the Wanderer knew that the next sun would not set on the day of slavery, and that his revenge was near. His bonds would be no. barrier to bis vengeance; they would break like burnt tow, he knew, in the fire of his' anger. Long since, iu his old wandering days, Calypso, his love, had taught him in the summer leisure of her seagirt isle how to tie. knots that no man could untie, and to undo all the kots that man can bind. He remembered this lesson in the night when the bow sang of war. So be thought no more of sleeping, out cunningly and swiftly unknotted all the cords and the bonds which bound him to a bar of iron in the bold. He might have escaped now, perhaps, if he bad stolen on deck without waking the guards, dived thence, and swam under water towards the island, where he might have hidden himself in the bush. But he desired revenge no less than freedom, and had set his heart on coming in a ship of lus own, and with all the great treasure of the Sidonians, before the Egyptian King. With this in his mind, he did not throw off the cords, but let them lie on his arms and legs and about his body, as if they were still tied fast. But he fought against sleep, lest in moving when he woke he might reveal the trick, and be bound again. So he lay and waited, and in the morning the sailors came_ on board, and mocked at him again. In bis mirth one of the men took a dish of meat and of lentils, and set it a little out of the Wanderer's reach as he lay bound, and said in the Phoenician tongue: "Mighty Lord, art thou some God of Javan (for so the Sidonians called tho Achacans), " and wilt thou deign to taste our ' sacrifice 7 Is not the savour sweet in the nostrils of my Lord? Why will be not put forth his hand to touch our offering?" Then the heart of Odysseus muttered sullenly within him, in wrath at the insolence of the man. But he constrained himself and smiled, - and said: Wilt tbounot bring the mess a very little • nearer, my friend, that I may smell the sweet incense of the sacrifice ?" • ■ i They were amazed when they heard him speak in their own tongno; but he who held viie dish brought it nearer, like a man that angers a dog now offering the meat, and now taking it away. So soon as the man wo3 within reach, the Wanderer sprang out, the loosened bonds falling at his feet, and Bmote the sailor beneath the ear with his clenohed fist. The blow was so fierce, for all his anger went into it, that it crushed the bone, and drove the man against the mast of the ship so that the strong mast shook. Where be fell, there he lay, his feet kicking the floor of the hold in his death-pain. Then the Wanderer snatched from the mast his bow and biB short sword, slung the quiver about his shoulders, and ran on to the raised decking of the prow. The bulwarks of the deck were high, and the vessel was narrow, and before the sailors could stir for amazement the Wanderer had taken Mb stand behind the little alt&r; and the dwarf gods. Here be stood with an arrow on the string, and the bow drawn to his ear, looking about him terribly. Now panic and dread came on the Sidonians when they saw him standing thus, and one of the sailors cried— " Alas! what god have we taken and bound 1 Our ship may not contain him. Surely he is Reset Mikal, the God of the Bow, whom they of Javan call Apollo. Nay, let us land him on the isle and come not to blows with him, but entreat his mercy, lest he rouse the waves and the winds againBt us." But the captain of the ship of the Sidomans cried:— "Not. so, ye knaves 1 Have at him, for he is no god, but a mortal man; and bis armour is worth many a yoke of oxen." Then he bade some of them climb the deck ing at the farther end of the shin and throw spears at him thence; and he called others to bring up one of the long spears and charge him with that Now, these were huge pikes that were wielded by five or six men at once, and no armour coula withstand them. They were used in the fights to drive back boarders, and to ward off attacks on ships which were beached on shore in the sieges of towns. The men whom the captain appointed little liked the task, for the long spears were laid on tressels along the bulwarks, and to reach them and unship them it was needful to come within range of the bow. But the sailors on the further deck threw all their spears at onoe, while five men leaped on the deck where the Wanderer stood. He loosed the bowstring and tbe shaft sped on its way; again be drew and loosed, and now two of them had fallen beneath his arrows, and one was struck by a chance blow from a spear thrown from tbe further deck, and the other two leaped back into the hold. Then the Wanderer shouted from the high decking of the prow in the speech of the Sidonians— "Ye dogs, ye have sailed on your latest sea faring, and never again shall ye bring the day of slavery on any man." So he cried, and the sailors gathered to gether in the hold, and took counsel how they should deal with him. But meanwhile the bow was not silent, and of those on the hinder deck who were casting spears one dropped, and the others quickly fled to their fellows below, for on the deck they had no cover. The sun was now well risen and shone on the Wanderer's golden mail as he stood alone on the decking with his bow drawn. Tbe sun shone, there was silence, tbe ship swung to her anchor; and still ho waited, looking down, his arrow pointed at the level of the deck to shoot at the first head which rose above the planking. Suddenly there came a rush of men on to the further decking, and certain of them tore the shields that lined the bulwarks from | their pins, and threw them down to those who were below, while others cast a shower of spears at the Wanderer. Some of the spears he avoided; others leaped back from his mail; others stood fast in the altar and in the bodies of the dwarf • gods; while he answered with an arrow that did not miss its aim. But his eyes were always watching moBt keenly tbe hatches nearest him, whence a gang way ran down to the lower part of the ship, where the oarsmen sat; for only thence could they make a rush on him. As he watched and drew an arrow from the quiver on hisshoulder, be felt, as it were, a shadow between him and the deck. He glanced np quickly, and there on the yard above his head, a man, who had climbed the mast from behind, was creeping down to drop on him from above. Then the Wanderer snatched a short spear and cast it at the man. The spear sped quicker than a thought, and pinned his two hands to the yard so that he hong there helpless, shrieking to his friends. But the arrows of the Wan derer kept raining on ,the men who. stood pn the further deck, and presently some of them, too, leaped down in terror, crying that he was a god and not a man, while others threw themselves into the sea, and swam for the island. Then the Wanderer himself waited no longer, seeing them all amazed, but he drew his sword and leaped down among them with, a cry, like a sea-eagle sweeping on soamews in the crevice of a rock.. To right and left he smote wifh .his short eword, making a havoc and sparing none, for the sword ravened in his hand. And some , fell ;over. the benches and oars, but such of the sailors as could flee rushed up the gangway into the furtlierdeik, and thence sprang overboard, while those who had not the luck to flee fell where they stood, and scarcely struck a blow. Only the'captain of the ship, knowing that all was lost, turned and threw a spear in the Wanderer's face. But he watched the flash of the bronze and stooped his bead, so that the spear struck only the golden helm and pierced it through, but scarcely grazed his head. Now the Wanderer sprang on the Sidonian captain, and smote him with the flat of his sword, so that he fell senseless on the deck, and then he bound him hand and foot with cords as he himself had been bound, and made him fast to the iron bar in the hold. Next he gathered up the dead in his mighty arms, and set them against the bul warks of the foredeck—harvesting the fruits of War. Above the deck the man who had crept along the yard was hanging by his two hands which the spear had pinned together to the yard. "Art thou there, friend?" cried the Wan derer, mocking him. " Hast thou chosen -to stay with me rather than go with thy friends, or seek new Bervice? Nay, then, as thou art ! so staunch, abide there, and keep a good look out for the River mouth and the market where thou art to sell me for a great price." So lie spoke, but the man was already dead of pain and fear. Then the Wanderer unbuckled his golden armour, which clanged upon the deck, and drew fresh water from the hold to cleanse himself, for he was stained like a lion that has devoured an ox. Next, with a golden comb he combed his long dark curls, and lie gathered his arrows out of the bodies of the dead, and out of the thwarts and the sides of the ship, ' cleansed them, and laid them back in the ' quiver. When all this was ended he put ou his armour again ; but strong as he was, he : could not'tear the spear from the helm without breaking the- gold ; so he snapped the shaft and put on the helmet with the point of tjie javelin still fixed Ann in the crest, lis Fate would have it so, and this was the beginning of liis sorrows. Next he ate meat and bread, i and drank wine, and poured forth some of the wjne before his gods. Lastly he dragged up the heavy stone with which the ship was moored, a stone heavier far, they say, than three other men could lift. Ho took the tiller in bis hand; the steady north wind, the Ete sian wind, kept blowing in the sails, and he steered straight southward for the mouths of the Nile.
