A Bunch of Withered Shamrock. Just a bunch of Irish Shamrock In a letter where the tears, Which have blotted words together, Have been dried these many years. Loving lines, yet sadly cheerful, How " 'twas lonesome here to day," When a pause, a little cheerful— " Dear, you are so far away." Every sentence has its token Of a love which could not fail, Throbbing with a faith unspoken, Though the ink is growing pale. Faded are the lines, dim lettered, Like sad ghosts upon the page, Ah i that poor love should be fettered With the rusty iron of age. Then the line, " I picked the Shamrock From the spot, dear, you well know, Where we walked and talked together— Oh ! it seems so long ago !" And at last—" Love, how much better It will be when, by and bye, We'll not need to write a letter To each other, you and I." God ! with what another meaning That one line has long been true, With death's silence intervening Since I last have heard from you. When you dropped life's weary fetters, When you went "so far away." Thought you of unwritten letters I was missing from that day ? If you know how I have needed Some new token through the years You have slept away unheeded— ' It must move your ghost to tears. If you still know how I love you, How I've missed you day by day, Since your death in fair Columba— You could never stay away. Take all treasures that I cherish, Fame and hope and life at last— Flitting things that needs must perish— Spare this mem'ry of the past Lying with a bunch of Shamrock In a letter where the tears, Which have blotted words together,
