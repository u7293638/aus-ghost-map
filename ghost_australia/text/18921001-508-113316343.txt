A Cash ' Collection.' THE OLD MANAGER'S STORY. Before Barnum's Museum shallowed Tip all the minor collections, our chief cities gave a man a living with a tolerable Omnium Gatherum. In seedy buildings, strung along the main streets, you might have come upon dingy and dusty shows, not a natch on the dime xnusees of our days, but affording fair returns to the pro prietors until the cold weather financial set in. Among the swept away memories of the past, when a good run of Sunday-schools and benevolent asylums were a solid income, was the Aboriginal Collection of old Steve Gulmore. As he had but the vaguest idea of what aboriginal meant, he had added to his attractions everything that would hang on to our native Indians, and some of those tags which, they hang on to themselves — namely, scalps — as they came into the market cheap. I never knew what the Smithsonian was doing that it let Gulf or d battle with ad verse fate without buying him out, sorting aside the barefaced humbugs, and putting the rest in the .Ethnological Department. But, alas! years after he had to vacate his old stand, just off New Bond-street, he had, in boxes, in a stable at the back of his house on one of the Sixtieth-streets, East River, the veritable Red Jacket of Red Jacket, the crooked bone from Billy Bowleg*s bow leg, the paddle of Tippe canoe, &c; He had piled away the spondulix in his flush times, but was living on his capital after the war. Over and over he tried ;to sell the stuff, as he got to call it, but the Wampanoag Historical Society and such like fought shy. He slunk into the fourth flat, back of the house, where he once reigned the boss — it having had three superstructures raised on it^-rand he was pretty glad once a year to ?* go a bu'ster,' to use his word, for a couple of months in the heated spell. Rigged out in a rather old fashioned way, but decent, with fine old jewellery' and steel diamonds, he cut a middling swath in the off color seaside and southern health resorts. He had a dim notion, the old rascal, that he would be compensated for his long single life by capturing a heiress, who would not scorn the fortune which he felt persuaded would fall in one of these days by the aboriginal collection finding a purchaser. Most of the present generation, who looked at the faded catalogue which he showed, like the brick to sell a house by with a jeering air, thought the whole stack would be dust with him before anybody was deluded. *« Perhaps anybody won't buy,' he would say, ' but I am in negotiation with a body that wilL' . * , In fact, he was in perpetsal corre spondence with some foreign society, whose secretary had, for a hoax, been gammoned into calling on Gulmore, and testing some real '68 Monongahela which he had in the cellar. It was just about then that his finances, not letting m-m figure at short Branch even, he retired for the summer to Mannet Crossing, a little place up in New York State. Once notad for a medicinal spring, and attended by the beaux and belles from even the chief towns, it was as quiet as' Sunday in a theatre in a Quaker town, as G-ulmore wrote to his friends. What brought him here was the fear that his principal source of income was in a bad way. fie had lent on mortgage of a farm at Manuet, It was all very well when the farmer, within a hundred of New York, had a long price for apples, wheat, and milk ; but everything had gone down in Consequence of western competition, helped by the Long Haul railroads. When poor old Steve saw the woebegone farms, he was willing to swap his mortgage on the Yon Gattein .property for a striped snake, a gila monster, and a fat pig which eays 'papa' and spells the name of the next President with block letters. With, them he might have made a start in the 'side' business— he never wanted for «« side,' but that mortgage I — oh, what a chump he had been to lend £4X)QO an those 300 odd aetes* . However, there he was. He put -up at the house, where the station-master reckoned Widder Gyles would 'commerdate him — though it was rather y'early in the season for summer beasders. And he Btrolled out, ehewing a cigar ais lie rue rainated. :V; ' : V \ ' ;.';' '' V '':''' .'...' lie bad the map of the estate on; srhich was Ma lien well in Mb mind's eye.

Old Gulmore, who tad Bung '? A Rake, a Rake Among the Garden Flowers Lay'rT;o great applause, at eggnogg suppers in road side bowses, thought he had never seen a more lovely girl. He regretted the loveli ness, for he feared that, if this were the daughter — she Was too young to be the wife of Yon Gastein — she might make him, with a tear or two of those sky blue eyes, be hard on the delinquent. So he stopped by the old, worn fence, hid partly in some sumachs, and watched this nymph among the kine with the mixed feeling mentioned. He had guessed to a T. That was Miria Von Gastein, the belle for 20 miles round, bar none. ^ Gulmore, who had the capital sight of a showman, . who has to be keen, or many a plugged half would b» taken at the door— also saw another person or two. In a field beyond a stone wall a hand some young fellow was pretending to stake up some young peach trees ; but, bleBsydtot, Gulmore, with half the good eyes w\ praised, could' see that he was looking wistfully towards the girl. In still another place, between Ihese two young folks, but far back, skulking among the gnarled and lichen coated boughs of two or three enormous apple trees, felled by a blizzard and allowed, to rot, an elderly man was perceptible to the showman, though the others were too wrapped up in themselves to suspect him. ' That's the dad*' mused Gulmore, whose programmes displayed a quick fancy. ' That is Yon Gastein, bet you what you like ! This is his daughter and she is stealing over to flirt with that likely young chap.' _ Well, the spy was not Mina's father — or his actions were anything but fatherly. He had caught sight of a large hornets' nest among the boughs of the fallen trees. He had fastened an open jack-knife to a pole, and with this kind of a spear he not only detached the bag of concentrated deviltry, but sent it rolling down the slope between the girl and the stone wall, and aimed to hit her with the accuracy of a ball flung by the four thousand dollar pitcher of a champion league. Gulmore had but a faint memory of upland hornets, but that was enough, to chill his blood, though a June day. He opened his mouth to yell an alarm, but at the same moment the perpetrator of this grim joke halloa' d in a gruff voice— - ' Aha 1 what are you doing there, sir P After my girl again, ugh ?' \- At this outcry the young farmer, seized with dismay, fled on his straight long legs, and, what was more singular to the visitor, who was climbing over the wood fence to the rescue, the supposed father turned and fled in another direction. Gulmore had no idea whither either went, as he was bent on succoring the girl. Never was such a demoniacal missile pro jected. Talk of dynamite bombs, they were but pulling crackers to it. At every bound, out flew hornets, the black and white kind, large, round as bumble bees, each emitting an angry whuzz, that would have made Caesar want his thickest suit of armor on. These all joined in pursuit of their roll ing home, which was careering towards the girl. She stood, appalled into quiet, +.51} tJiA vAno-Harrl nf fchfl ntSasr&Ta; whizzed round her head, when she pulled her dainty check apron over her face, and gracefully keeled over into a bed of creep ing blackberries. It was just then that Gulmore arrived. With his vigor of 80 years revived by the maiden in distress, her pink ears threatened by the winged pests, her trim ankles, and her creamy hands, which the buzzers -were* about to attack — he gave the nest a kick, which hurled it 60ft into the brook, where, luckily, the dispossessed tenants followed it* He gallantly took the girl up in his arms, and, as soon as he could recover breath, lugged her off towards the nearest building. He kept gasping that she was not to be alarmed — that the horrible things were gone, and all the solace inventiblc He wished he had the strength to carry her, but, romance to the contrary, to say nothing of his age — Minawas pretty sub stantial, and he was not sorry when she recovered, at the margin of the mead, and let fall the apron from her terrified eyes. The terror changed to surprise. « I am a stranger,' Gulmore hastened to sav j ' never mind me. What am I to do now?' ?* What was that ? Who rolled the hornets at me?' ** I guess it was your father'— if you. are ? ' ' I am Wilhemina Yon Gastein, and. my father would not do such a thing — — - n , ' Wouldn*t, eh ?

Miss Yon Gastein waB still in the swoon. ** If it were iiot her dad, who was it F Oh, perhaps the lover's dad,' thought Gulmore. ''This is very awkward. Lucky, she loves that young f«llow— -or I might be coerced, with a shotgun, into marrying this fain tee, almost caught in my arms.

Had be been erect, he\ would nave both somewhere about his midribs, where they would do the moBt harm. Pale as a ghost, unnerved, but hearing' the girl scream, which made a man of him, lie filled the dipper with a palsied hand, and trotted back to the mead,- with all the manner he could remember of the tijfngy of Pontiac in his Collection. 1 ' *^ Heaven be good,' she faltered, $ what ever was that ? Are yo.u not shotP_ Are you hurt, you dear good old man?' ;; 'Old man?' Old? the game was up, if he had hoped his devotion and bravery were to be rewarded by her hand. ' No j but your father has a tragic way of guarding ids milk pans. You ought to have come out of your faint just to tell a stranger of his spring guns.' 'My father, again ? Oh, no, it is some murderer. Oh, it is that hideous Pole, Dr. Saginski, who wanted, and hoped to blow my poor Schuyler's brainB out.' And she sobbed and wept till her apron was a wet rag.
