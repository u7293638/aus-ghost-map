The Advertiser SATURDAY, MAY 4, 1895. THINGS THEATRICAL. THE season at the Theatre Royal that closed last night has been signalised by the temporary return to the stage of Mr. Wybert Reeve in a part that appears to give him partacolar pleasure, and a play! which contains, among various scenes of more or less *roentj at least one supremely fcrnnytdtoafion. i4A. Night Off" is,like "The Private Secretary," an adaptation from the German, "The New Boy," however, is entirely English in ite origin, and thoroughly well hssit beanrepresettted byacompanyevidently?electedwithaview to the physical conditions on which tiie' plot depends. The run of the piece has jusfcomerto an end in London. "When "Charley's Aunt" had been i? Existence for ft little over two years Mr. Perdey eb^ed that it "bad been played by more companies, in man languages, and in more conafcriee than any other pieoe, sad had made mote money than any other play ever written." As to the latter point it may be added that Mr. Brandon Thomas, tie fortunate aothar, draw? a. royalty an every per formance, and has consequently re ceived .more from this play +fr?n was ever before received v by any drama tist whatsoever for a angle work. The; figures in -this case are. not made public. Some idea, however, of the pos sibilities that attend the lottery of thea trical production may be gathered from tin admission of Mr. Arthur law that he lias pocketed £6,000 as net profit in the first year on the sale of the "town, provincial, and out-of yviglMid" rights on "The New Boy." Mr. Weedon Grossmith, more discreet, keeps the managerial profit to himself, bat as be has been compelled to put tie piece on the stage 427 times in the twelve months—it being the delight of the " suburban matin^or"—his share cannot well be a light one, - The recent epidemic of inflmmm jn England has 'removed two notable per sonages who might well be said to be of the stage, though not on it. The less known but more powerful one was Mr. Edward Pigoth the official licenser of Flays. It is .difficnlt to understand (exactly how far hia functions extended, but all dramatic pieces had to receive his sanction before production. If apasaage here and there was pruned the public was not likely to hear of the fact. But if, as rarely happened, the play was pro hibited as a whole, the author waa apt to air his grievance in the news papers, and probably of iate years to pub lish in book-form a production .that has Obtained so good an advertisement. Osoar Wilde had a still better idea. His play "Salome" being prohibited on the ground that it dealt with Scriptural sub jects he merely wrote it again in French and had it produced in Paris instead of Jjpndon. Mr. Pigott's decease caused perhaps more exoitament than his blame leas career had ever done. Many wild suggestions were made as to various author* and critics from whom bis successor should be chosen, but all this baa been brought to an end by tie appointment of his im mediate subordinate in the department, which will therefore be carried on upon the old traditions. Yet, as the PdU Mall says:—"Suoh an office must in the nature of things be ineffective! The words and directions of a scene may be of a columbine innocency, and the came scene when acted of a serpentine wicked ness." Especially ia ttiia Hie cage in these days of comic opera and variety flay, when the actors are notoriously reliod ?*? to "work up" their parts, aad botfc dialogue and "business? 1 have at timei yery little connection with tbe ostensible authored the piece. The other celebrity to whose untimely demise we have referred was Mr. Comey Grain, and as his co proprietors in the entertainment known as "German BeedV died in the same week, it is to be feared that St. George's Hall will know no more its pleasant after noon performances, the delight of many Who never entered a theatre. The cental, and to many the chief, feature of each entertainment was the monologue de livered by Mr. Comey Grain himself, seated at the piano. He was a man of enormous baud, by the way, aad " thumped" on occasion, and he professed to be haunted by the ghost of an " iron grand" which claimed to have suffered destruction at his hands. Mr. George G-ipossmitfl, bis professional rival and in timate friend, has already paid a touching tribute to his personal qualities. - Still more noteworthy, however, vert the remarks of the Archdeacon of Louden..., when preaching in St. Paul's Cathedral on the Sunday after Mr. Grain'* death, 33?e deceased comedian was spoken of as '?a wholesome humorist, whoHaftiriaedottc follies and fashions so gently and kindly that we delighted in his lessons, and who, in all the variety of hi? provision for pur recreation, conferred oneoaety-the signal benefit of sever forgettdnc 4se standard of Christian morality." In rajfo^^r,. - Baid the preacher, was to be^oaunendod v the, fact that "lie and his friends cob- . tinued to purvey, in the face of many tendencies to tbe.contraiy, healthy Jner- - riment for boys, and .liMMfflff.*-.
