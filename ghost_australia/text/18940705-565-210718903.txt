" Let nie tell the harrowing tale," and Mr. Burgess fixed himself com fortably. " A uiO'itii after you It ft, in my coy and diliident manner, I asktd Miss Harriet one day on the street if 1 cinhin't walk home with her. Bhe was just too swvet for am tliiilg, " — Fred winced — "and said it would charm her beyond espie- ssion. fjo 1 walked along with ll-r, ta k ng ahutn you ami other young mm. Mis- llariiet was eurapt ired to hear what 1 said of y u and of the other young men, and then very demure y sdd sb; thought older men were so much iiic-r. Then I was charmed, and when we rescind her home she invited me to call wiih such a winning grace that j couldn't resist it, and accepted the in- vitutii u in my very best style." Fied got up ami tramped around the libiary awhile. " Confound the woman," he Slid " Did you go i" " Didn't I go 5" responded the father with a semi- vi hoop, " Well, I shou'd say I difl, and until four day ago 1 didn't give one of those other young sters a ghost of a chance at any thing. By the way, Fred," he added regret fully, " it costs like the mischief to court a girl right these days, doesn't it 1 I had no idea it was such an ex pensive luxury." Fred writhed in his chair. " Go on," he said almost sternly. " Oh, I did go on," laughed the father, " and she encouraged me, too, and, by Jove, young fellow, I became so interested I couldn't stop going on." Fred looked at his father in amaze ment. If this thing continued he felt ; that something disagreeable would happen to him, but he said nothing. '' Well," resumed Mr. Burgess, "four days ago, at 8 p.m., I called for the four dozenth time, and my mind was made up to have that girl iu the family, even if I had to prove myself a traitor to do i(." Fred almost forgot himself, but he exetcised all his powers c.f restraint. " Said T," continued Mr. Burg<ss, "after I Lad beaten r round ihe emotional bush for half an hour.
