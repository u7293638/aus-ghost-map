A Mesmeric Evangelist. Considerable oxcitemont is being manifested at Langley (said tho Birmingham DAILY GAZETTE) owing to the appearance of the " Eev. Dinock/' from Berkshire, who is going through some extra- ordinary performances at tho Primitive Methodist Chapel in that locality. Crowds of peoplo are flocking to tho place nightly-most of thom ont of curiosity on account of the wonderful stories that are abroad. No one knows much of tho antecedents of the rev. gentleman, who seems to combine tho preacher, mesmerist, and spiritualist all in one. After the ordinary service, at which ho holds forth at great length, a limited number of persons √çB invitod to enter an ante-room " to roceivo tho Holy Ghost." By performing a number of mes- meric passes, and apparently calling to the spirit world for assistance, ho makes a number of people fall from their scats on to the floor and roll un- derneath tho honchos, apparently unconscious; during which time the rev. gentleman declares " that tho Holy Ghost has entered into thom, and taken possession of their whole being." Moro mesmeric passes and mysterious antics follow, after which the individuals operated upon sud- denly recover consciousness, and are said to have become converted.
