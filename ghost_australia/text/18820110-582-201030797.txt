HAUNTED. Like unto ghosts that come when darkness broods O'er tower and turret of some castle hoary, And people once again its solitudes With shades of vanished glory ; From out the haunted chambers of our hearts, Where all the lost things of the Past lie hidden, Some subtle incense will as day departs, Steal softly forth unbidden. Incense from off the altar of dead dreams, Whereon new hopes to higher heights have risen, And calmly shining, shed down milder beams, To gild this earthly prison. But still a mournful sweetness hovers round These mystic phantoms from the heart's recesses: The tender touch of lips that yield no sound — The sheen of silken tresses ; The nameless tokens of the dear dead days, The twilight (frystes?), by moonlit waters smiling, The golden sunsets wrapped in dreamy base, The spell of Love's beguiling ; The rapture of a summer long ago, The song that came and went in broken numbers, The holy hush of Death, the brow of snow, The churchyard where she slumbers ; The tender pressure of a vanished hand, The broken chain that time must further sever, The merry laughter of the childish, band, ; The voices hushed for ever. Strains of sad music from a far-off shore — Mute memories these that woo with soft caresses, And tinge with sacred radiance evermore Life's lonely wildernesses. W. C. H.
