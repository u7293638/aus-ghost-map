The Territory. TO THE EDITOR. Sir—I am very glad to hear the Omeo is bringing us some 15 or 16 fresh additions to our population. I had almost given up hopes of ever again seeing even the ghost of a fresh arrival. Why, Sir, I suppose those coming will be almost one-half the number the Omeo will take away with her. Well, let us be thankful for small mercies. But, Sir, I have been thinking, seeing our population is leaving us so gradually, and that we are drifting on to the verge of a collapse, whether our leading men cannot do something by petitioning (or otherwise as they, may deem best) the Government, setting forth our impoverished condition, and asking the Government whether they cannot hold out a hand for the rescue —either by the Overland Railway, or in any other way that would in their wisdom prove both servicible and profitable. I believe the Railway across would have been commenced ere this only for a few who thought the land in the interior too valuable to give in exchange for value received. But we all know the land in the interior of the continent is useless, and ever will remain so until we have easy communication; and that alone will make the land worth three times what it is now or ever will be without it, and which at the same time would open up a grand scheme of colonization. I really believe were our colonists to take the matter up with a will the Government would do something to help us. If not, it is quite evident we shall have to go on the wallaby track and leave the place to the Telegraph Officers and the niggers, and I cannot think it was for that the Government were so anxious a few years back to have the Territory, and which has cost so much labor and capital. I am, Sir, &c.;, PROBOS.
