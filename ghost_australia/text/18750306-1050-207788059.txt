THE BABYLON OF THE REVELATION OF ST. JOHN. By the Right. Rev. Bishop Wordswobth. \- ' . Chapter II. Whether Babylon in the Apocalypse is the Church . "J" of Rome. i: We now advance a step further in the argu ment ; and our present Inquiry is, Whether the Apocalyptic prophecies, which have been specified, refer to Rome in her spiritual as well as in her temporal character ; , that is, whether they concern her, not only as a City, but as a Church ? ,1. The great City, the City on the Seven Hills, and the City which in the age of St. John reigned over the , Kings of the Earth, the mystical Babylon enthroned upon many waters, . this, we have seen, is the City of Rome. And , Rome ,it is acknowledged to. be by the con- ; .current voice of the Christian Church in . the age of St. John and to this day. ; 2\. So strong, indeed, is the evidence of this identity, that, the Divines. of Papal Rome have . not been able to resist it. It is enough to: mention three most eminent among them — .Cardinal Bellarmine, Cardinal Baronius, and the famous French Bishop, Bossuet.(l) ,"S.t. John in the Apocalypse," says Cardinal; Bellarmine, (2) calls Rome Babylon ; for no other city, besides Rome reigned iu his age over the (Kings of the Earth, and it is well known that Rome was seated upon seven hills. " fit is confessed by all," says Cardinal Baronius, (3) " that Rome is signified iii the Apocalypse by the name of Babylon;". And the language of the; celebrated French Prelate, Bossuet, (4) in. > his Exposition of the Book of Revelation, is : " The features (in the (Apocalypse) are, so marked, that it is easy. to decipher Rome under the figure-of Babylon." ! Such is the avowal of the most lebrned Divines . of papal Rome. . J. Here, then, we see, the question is brought into a narrow compass. . The' Babylon- of the Apocalypse, it is allowed by Romish as well as Protestant writers, is .the City of Rome. . ' ; 4\. But, it- may now. beiasked ... - , Since such heavy. ( judgments ,are denounced \- on Babylon . in the Apocalypse, how- could any persons acknowledge Rome to be the Apocalyptic Babylon, and yet regard her . as the Mother and Mistress, of Churches.?: : . : > v/i ... The answer is, the Divines of .Rome affirm .that .what, St. John, predicted of Babylon, icon-; cerns. Rome as a City, but not as a Church; And,, soip&.iof . them .add:,that> it concerned ancient, , hqathen Rome, but does not. refer to it as Ghristia\i,t) , . . i; - - j,: In support of this opinion it is alleged by them, -for (instance by. Bossuet;.. who has most, laboured this point, in his Commentary on the Apocalypse, (6), that the ancient Christian .Fathers, did indeed identify the. Apocalyptic , Babylon with the City of Rome; kutihe affirms that they did' not identify it with the Church of Rome ; and he adds that every person of judg ment will prefer the interpretation of the ancient; Fathers .to that of those modern Ex positors who (identify Babylon with the Church ,of Rome. ,. , , ._ .. I. . 5. B.ut on this allegation - it may be ob served— , . .; ... ' . The Fathers. . , who li ved> in the . first : three .centuries, .that is,, who flourished before'Rome became Christian, recognised the City of Rome in the Apocalyptic Babylon ; so did the Fathers who. lived .in, the- fourth, fifth, : and ; sixth centuries, when . Rome was . becoming, and in the end |did become, Christian, c And we follcw the Fathers, as far as they go. - We, with, tliem, see the City, of Rome in Babylon. But tlie question is— Must we not see something more ?, , And' here we make a distinction., bit.., John was inspired,., by the Holy Ghopt ,; he , was , a prophet, and was . enabled to, foresee and., tp foretell what ; the Church of Rome would, he- dome.' '.'But'' 'ilie Fathers were, not prophets g they 'knew Rome only as she was in , their .own age ; arid we do not , pretend that , the,, phurgh: gf Rome, was then, what she is now., ; .

Indeed, oib of our strongest objection to the Church of y&orae; is, that she enforces joetrines which ths ancient. Fathers never knej and which (as tie Romish , advocates of the Ditrine of Development allow) she herself did ncexplicitly 'profess for many centuries. And, she had held th«se doctrines in the days of tl ancient Fathers, then our argument against je novelty of tl'ese doctrines would fall to the und. Our answer theiore is : — We <io not pretend, that in the age I the Fathers, the Church of Rome was Babyli'j but the question to be considered is, whaershe did not .become Baby lon; by adopting jd enforcing doctrines .which neither they nor se held or dreairit of in their : age; and whetlr, by now holding those doctrines, and b' anathematizing all who do. not receive them, fie does not identify herself with the Apocalyjic Babylon, who requires .all, men to drink of hecun.(d) And we think, that if the Fathers wej alive, they would join with us in the' inquit whether she is not the Babylon? f . . ' 6. The truth ao is, that- Bossuet misrepre sents the interptation which identifies , the Church of Rome ,1th Babylon. He calls it "a. Protestant iriterptation ;" by which he means, "thkt it is a \iodern interpretation, con temporary with, r subsequent to, the Reforma tion in the sixteeth century. But this is an versight. For no sooner did the Church, of ome begin to put forth , her present claims, ; d enforce her modern creed, than it was prociiried by many witnesses, that by so doing she as identifying herself with the Babylon of the i localypse. ., . Dating ' from fope Gregory the First, who made a prophet; protest against the title of Universal Bishp at the close of the . sixth century, we caitrace (1) a succession of. such witnesses to th day. In that series we may enumerate the felebrated Peter of Blois, the Waldenses, an Joachim of ,-Calabria, (2) Ubertinus de Caali, Peter Olivi, (3) Marsilius of Padua, and the illustrious names of Dante, and Petrarch.(4) . , / The interprtation, which identifies the 'Church of Rorii with the Apocalyptic Babylon, dbes-.nW date firm the Reformation ; .the truth is,r ;that it was prior to the Reformation, and did mrich to pruuee the Reformation. , . ' In the sevenn and following centuries, the Church of Rom was united with the City pi Rome, by thepunctiori of the temporal ' and spiritual poweij in the person , of the Roman PontiflF ; and wen the Chtirch of Roine begau to put forth hi" new dogmas, and.,. to enforce them as necesjary to salvation, . then it was publicly affirmol by many (although she burnt some'who affirned it) that she was fulfilling the Apocalyptic pbphecies concerning Babylon. And though the destruction of heathen Rome by the Goths in Ihe fifth century was . a most striking event, yet not a single (5) witness of any antiquity Ban be cited in favour of the Exposition of Bossuet and his co-religionists, who see a fulfilment of the predictions of the Apocalypse, concerning the ,. destruction of Babylon, - in thi fall of heathen Rome by the sword of Alaric! r . . ;-r : Indeed- that Exposition is a modem one , ; it is 'an ,'aflerthoughl ; and has been . devised by Bossuet and others to meet the. other, .which they call : the Protestant, interpretation. The identification of the Apocalyptic Babylon with ancient heathen Rome, as its adequate antitype, is an invention of modern papal Rome. 7\. Let us how suppose, for argument's sake, with' Bossuet and the great body of the Romish Interpreters, that the prophecies of the Apocalypse concerned Rome only as a City, a pagan City, and do not concern her now both as aiGity and a. Church. Arid let us also suppose with them, that Rome is, as they affii-iriher to be,: the "Mother and' Mistress of all Churches';" and that there is one thing needful for all men -as:all Romish Divines assert— namely, to be ini communion with Rome. v-iWhat then is the 8tate of the case ? b. Hero is the Apocalypse, a prophetical Book; as -they allow, dictated 'by.1 the Holy Ghost,' revealing the history of Christianity., from the Apostolic age . to Christ's Second . Advent, arid designed for the edification arid comfott.o'f the faithful members of the Church in. the dangers,, | trials, i difficulties,' ' 1 arid- 1 petplexities which awaited them!"1 /Under such circumstances as, I these, :.nothing would' have "been - more natural;! 1 nothing, -we may almost add,' more riecessaryl jthan' that Bt./'John "should have' saidptqt'.!'the, ! followers;! of ' Christ— You' /will;' J .foresee, be J'and by I heresies; and' schisms f rom withiri''; . ybu ' yill be.

But be of good cheer, you need not be distressed, you need not be perplexed. There : is one Church which cannot err, and will never fail — the Church of Rome. Rome is now a heathen city, the Queen of the Gentile World:- but Rome will, ere long, .become the Capital of Christen dom. And the Church of Rome is, by Christ's appointment,: the Mother and Mistress of Churches. He who noio rules' at .Rome is a Pagan Prince; but when a few years have elapsed, the sovereignty of Rome will pass into other hands ; it will be swayed for iiore than a thousand years by -the Bishop of Rome. He is Infallible ; he is the Arbiter of the Faith ; hiB chair -is the Centre -of- Unity ; he is the Vicar of Christ. . One thing is indispensable ; remain in communion with him;. . Obey him ; then nothing can harm you, nothing can disturb you. You will be safe, -you will be blessed' for ever. , ' v f To be continued,)
