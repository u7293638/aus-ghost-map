The northern belief . in ghosts disappears almost entirely in the realistic mind ot the South. While tEe limit of power of the sorcerer in the Delta does not extend .. be yond the 'evil eye ' (el-ain), love-charms, , &c.; the Soudan does not content itself with such modest results. Nay, to the utmost fright and terror of the Nubian and s negro, both, gifted with a fan tastic imagination, the sorcerer transforms him self here at night-time into the most savage animal, acd under this disguise devours his innocent victim. ? ' ' In' the N Arabic-speaking Soudan, the. most common spotted hyena is called 'maraful.' This animal plays an important part in African super stition by its nightly habits or living, its appear ance and horrible voiee, which changes from a | deep howl' into sounds reminding -one of the laughter of '*» maniac. The popular belief in Sennar and the Eastern Soudan is that the hyena is not an animal, but an evildoes changed by black witchcraft into animal form. Never has the hyena1 been' seen in sunshine, because the latter^s believed to Ireak the spell of witchcraft; J)ut as soon as the light of Heaven has disappeared ' in the West, the hoarse cries of these monsters gathering to their nightly feasts resound from every side. Aged wocnen with red eyes and hoarse voices, T»ho have missed their vocation in life, are gene rally believed to be witchee, who take the form of these horrible beasts 'by manipulating the teeth of a hyena, or strange roots, or by other forms of 'sorcery. The purpose «f this trans formation is supposed to be a secret, desire for human flesh and thirst for vengeance. Can one imagine a more horrible revenge than th«a tearing of the enemy's body out of the grave and de TTOTITMTl-O' it ^ If such a hyena is killed, it dies as an animal. If it is only wounded, and it succeeds in Teaching .its hiding-place, where the tranBfowuation from man to beaBt has taken place (generally an. ant hill), it will jretake its human shape. The wound, however, will remain, ana, by following the traces of blood, the sorcerer can be iiumed down. The superstitious natives are generally afraid of shooting a hyena, lest they chould commit a murder. In tbe districts of Sennar, witchcraft ani sorcery seem- to be well spread and developed. Even the ?waters of the blue Nile are made tbe scene of evil deeds, where th« villain is disguised as a crocodile, and attacks mankind. The sor cerers transformed into crocodiles have a chieftain called ' Bunnie,' who once a year is visible on a small sandy island opposite Sencar. It is an old male crocodile ot. more than five metres in length. These supernatural crocodiles cannot be distin guished externally, from the real amphibia whose form they have taken as disguise. It is. how ever, believed that the eroccdiles which, at sun rise, raise themselves out of the water and lace the morning sun are transformed human beings. Some sorcerers are said to kill their victims by earing awaj their intestines in some inexplicable manner; and so to cause their slow tut ;certain death.. As an example, an Arabian military doctor told me the following : In the year 1878, an old w«man in IPdzogl bad been accused of causing the death of a soldier in this manner, and she was publicly executed. The doctor him self bad made the post-mortem examination of the soldier's body and -had found the intestine s eaten away and torn. ? ? In Qualiabat, at the frontier of Habesh, soase of the Takarri are said to have .brought from tbeir former home iufhe Darlur knowledge of secret science, and 'to have developed. the art of sorcery to such a degree that they can 'transform themselves 'net only into hyenas and crocodiles but also into lions. How deeply superstition is rooted in all' classes of tbe .Soudanese population is shown by the ? fact that, under the Governor Musa Pasha at the Hokimdarieh of Khartoum, there was in 1863 a round earthenware vessel still in existence, filled with mysterious roots, to which were led all persons denounced for sorcery. . Were 'they innocent, they- could approach the jog with a firm step.- ?? Jf,' however, they were in league with an evil power they would tremble at the aspect of the urn, hesitate in their move ments, and willingly confess their guilt without having 'been submitted, to a cross- examination. Taming to the neighboring Christian Abys sinia . (Amhara), we find that witchcraft and sorcery are* in a similar way at their nefarious work. Here it is the ' Buddha ' who addresses his intended victim in ~ full daylight in the street or in the market under some pretext, and so bewitches him' that he falls into a fever, and, attracted by an irresistible power, goes to find his sorcerer in the night, who in bis bouse or come quiet spot kills him to satisfy his cannibal .desire tor human flesh. This spell, however, can be broken if in good time some roots or. leaves of special medical power are inserted into the nostril* oi tbe victim and certain chapters of ? i-.V»*a S/-t»lT^4-.n7*/- £kv*A road frrt llim In the year 1879, by order of King John, the property of several proven sorcerers was con fiscated, and they we're marked on the forehead v itb. red- hot irons to prevent them from doing further harm. The Nubians, Abyssinians, and the negro tribes of the White fflie have a firm' belief in tbe power of the 'evil eye.' It is sup posed to dcharm to cattle and horses and so to bewitch guns that they constantly zbies their aim.' The eye of envious people is generally said to be gitted with this mysterious power, and persons having a beautiful child, a, fine horse or camel, will expose them as little as' possible to the gaze of strangers. . They adorn them with all kinds of amulets to. guard them ' against evil influence. ' Such charms are a p mall bright silver plate, & pierced silver coin, tusks of the wild boar, pieces of hard roots, or, as the most powerful of all, a entail leather bag^pontaining a piece of paper on which a quotation irom tbe sacred writings is copied. To preserve his harvest of 'durrah'r against the~ma.licious influence of the evil eye, ihe, native of Toka plants in bis field a pole upen which tbe bleached skull of an ox is placed. ' .. ? . ... ? . - Fortune-telling and divination are everywhere at honva in Africa ; they are carried on in the Eastern Souoan by a manipulation of sand ;-dharb-er-ramle). l This is the art of reading, the secrets' of the future and - predicting- distant events from signs and impressions made with' the fingers at haphazard on loose sand. The Baggara Arabs and tha blaik Fur are most renowned for their skill and ? Adroitness in this secret art. In Eordofan and Imrfur nobody, will start on along journey or undertake any matter of importance without firet consulting the local sand- oracle upon the result: of hip enterprise.
