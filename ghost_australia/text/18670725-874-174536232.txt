3STo End of a Start. THE theatrical critic of the Age wrote last week of Mr. ANDERSON'S " HAMLET —" The start of horror with which he recognises the presence of the ghost was worthy of the elder KEAN." The same authority, who seems, by the way, to be on the most familiar terms with the elder KB AN, writes in Tuesday's Age concerning Mr. ANDERSON'S " MACBETH •."—" The start of horror with which he first recognises the visiter from the other side of the Styx was worthy of the elder KEAN." We shall be curious to see if, according to the Age, Mr. ANDERSON will have one of these "starts of horror" to spare for " RICHARD III."
