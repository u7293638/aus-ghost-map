THE CARNIVAL AT ROME. I \- w9 CIRCUS MHsIMUS AT THE PIAZZA DEL POPOLO. The Roma correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph writes as follows son 20th February - The Roman Carnival, and indeed most of its con- geners throughout Italy, have become not only the mournful at survivals of a past altogether out of touch with the present, but also wearisome bore, and in some cases intolerable nuisances As a rule the Italians are a very well-behaved and polite people Stabbing among themselves is of painfully frequent occurrence, and each Monday 's issue of the Mttagero contains a perfectly appalling hat of eolMlatt, often fatal, and nearly always due to the most trifling causes but the people are very rarely aggressive or even rude to foreigners At carnival time they take to fool liberties with all and sundry, and in most places in the Peninsula the buffoonery and horse play of the three last days are so dear old of ill-nature as not to be worth resenting Rome is an exception to this pleasant rule the Roman populace seem to regard Shrove Tuesday as a kind of Emperors and although slavery has long since ceased to exist, the spirit of the Saturnalia still seems to linger among the lower grades of the people The flinging broadcast of confers, or pieces of coloured chalk pretending to be sweetmeats, does not do much harm, perhaps, beyond covering your garments with white dust, but the Onriuvnlcrque ushers, or practical jokes, assumed another and decidedly unpleasant aspect, when, if a stranger is so imprudent as to show h myself, either on foot or in a carriage, in the corner in a tall hat, the mob forth- with began to pelt him with the stumps of decayed cabbages, bunches of withered flowers with a few pebbles artfully concealed in the loaves and fragments of mutton, or brickbats Among ins, whom away from their own soft that wearing country seem to have a kind of cult for the stove e-pipe, are in particular the objects of the indelicate attention of that ruffianly section of the Roman canaille who, out of Cannvul time, divert themselves by exploding stockings full of dynamite under the lee walls of places, hotels, and private houses Under these circumstances being by this time rather more than an ancient Roman than a Dane-or n bora conveyed generally give the Caron as out of doors a very trade berth, and keep at home until the ruffianly saturnalia has come to on end. Yesterday, however, I was tempted by the strong representations of an old Italian friend he has a Herman name, and his engenders is Trench-to make an appointment at J in the afternoon for the purpose of witnessing the sequel to a sports and chariot races in the special amphi- theatre constructed for these games at the Piazza del Popolo "It will be very like the Circus «.lai-tmus-it will, indeed," my friend assured me. " Blood is thicker than water and the Roman people yetpre«er\e( almost intact, many of the artistic and social tradi- tions of their remotest ancestors " I ventured to remind him that the ancient Circus Maximus, between the Palatine and the Argentine, was culpable, in the time of Pliny, of accommodating on its tiers of Stone seats as many as 200,000 spectators, and that the last chariot and horse race took place there under the auspices of Tobita, King of the Goths, so far back as A.D 619 "Well," my friend admitted, "we can't seat quite so many people as that in the Piazza del Popolo, still, I expect that the spectacle will be curiously like the Circus Maximus so put on a pot hit and come along I did his bidding, even as the Wedding Guest did the bidding of the Ancient Mariner. I heard no "loud bas- soon," although the squeaking of the trumpets and fife, was distressingly audible all round and although I did not beat my breast as Golendpo's Guest did, 1 buttoned my greatcoat every closed over my bosom in view of the contingent of there being any but values at the modern Circus who affectionately adhered to the traditions of their ancestors, the surprises, at the old one Liken ise, r our ltlistiudiug the indispensable precaution of w naring wideawake we agreed that it would be better to drive to the Piazza del Popolo, not through the Corso, but by the Via Babuino, which runs parallel with it from the Piazza di Spagna The Popolo itself, from Hindi as all visitors to Rome know there are two entrances to the pleasant carriage drive on the Pincian Hill, had undergone, in honour of the festive season, a wondrous transformation A speculative individual had prevailed on the municipality of Rome for the second or third time, and for a consideration, 1 apprehend-to convert the immense area at the foot of Monte Pinero into a racecourse The Romans and, indeed, the Italians generally, are, I need scarcely say, unsurpassed as architectural and decorative Yampi ovation In their painted carpentry work they literally lie Like truth and in their pictorial ocular deceptions, or distant cSe allusions, their skill is simply marvellous The Milanese decorators even succeeded in deceiving Napoleon the Great by piston.. in a few hours on canvas the simulrcrum 01 a groined Gothic vault, which, attached to the flat ceiling of the nave of the Duomo at Milan, looked precisely like so much delicately carved stonework At the Piazza del Popolo, in tho course of a very few days, eyo-deceiv ing results, almost as wonderful as the typical feat at Milan, had been obtained Standing in the centre of the immense c mular arena you saw what appeared to be tiers upon tiers of seats of polished white marble, those of the fore- most row having a frontage of seemingly carved worked, exquisite in richness of detail There was a Tribune of Honour, flanked by fluted columns of the Corinthian order, and canopied and draped with rich stuffs for the Caesar of the day, and there was a kind of triumphal arch, abundant in bas-reliefs and statuary for the entrance of the chariots and the steeds with their charioteers and riders Any special rostrum for the Vestal Virgins I failed to discern , but they were thereof they were there, of that you may be certain it was all, architectural!;, and statuesque speaking, a sham the most impu- dent, but the most picturesque of frauds There indeed, were the many tiers of seats the Tribune of Honour, and the arch for the ingress and egress of the actors in the spectacle but the entire construction was only so many deal boards nailed together, painted w bite, out artfully embellished with architectural details The seeming Sculpture was com closed of plaster casts in fact the Roman decorators had done for the speculative individual who had devised it in the Piazza t del Popolo something very like what the Lyceum scone punters with the counsel of Mr Knowles did for Mr Henry Irving when Lord Tennyson's "Cup was produces But the Italian decorators, indigent handicrafts men, earning perhaps not more than four francs a day, and supporting existence mainly on mac razors, strachie cheese, a little thin wine, and Sore filed intestines on high days and holidays, had enjoyed, in carrying out their work, aid and assistance of w 'Inch the Lyceum artists w ere deprived First, the February sky was an unclouded blue-not the argentiferous blue of the Antipodes, but the genuine Italian azure, deep and lustrous the February sun shone brightly, and as the afternoon waned the lights of the distant buildings grew pink and salinon-hued and the shadows purple, next the circus was overlooked by the Pincian Hill, its slopes glowing with sub-tropical vegetation palms, popenno, aloes, japonica, pretty pear, and cactus and, finally side by side with the Saucy Sham there was the sublime and % honorable Heal The altar of Truth remained mundane eternal close to the ephemeral platform of the journey- man decorator In the centre of the arena towered, uncommunicative, mysterious inscrutable, the great Egyptian obelisk, brought by order of Augustus from Hohonolts after the defeat of Antony, which originally stood in the ancient Circus M iximus It was brought hither in 1689 by Pope Sixttaf V To the west is an ancient arched wall, with statues of Neptune and Tritons while opposite is a similar structure adorned with antique sculpture symbolising Rome between the Tiber and the Arno And that church with the lofty cupola at the entrance to the Corso ? It in Santa Maria del Popolo, which, although the present structure is medieval, was founded in 1999 by Pope Paschal II on the site of the burial-place of New his old nurse and a wench who loved him laid the dead tyrant there, and wept for him, they say and which was reputed to be taunted b) evil spirits There were no evil spirits in the Porta del Popolo yesterday. The populace nobody being in a tall hat-were very well behaved, and although there were a few raggedy oh makers in the throng, var- cars with their nightgowns over their clothes, and jude's in print calico and tinsel like "My Lady who used to foot it with Juck-in-tho-Groen on May Day in the London bygone there was no throwing of rotten greenstuff withered flowers, or incomplete bricks The people in the arena, who might have been about 5000 in number, appeared to take the very deepest interest in the races, and greeted the successful competitors with enthusiastic shouts and clapping of hands The modern Italians, indeed, seem to be fast becoming as horsey a people of their forefathers were in the days of ant quite Already in the sporting intelligence in the Roman papers you find allusions to vitreous," " written e " and "Miss," recalling walk-over, light-weights, and dead heat, and they have actually Italianise 1 our term to handicap into a verb, " handicapped " Whether they call a Kelaher a "galleries "I have not been told Possibly there are no washers on the Roman turf, any more than there are snakes in Ireland Scattered on the tiers of sham marble seats-I do not know what kind of Caesar or of con- suls and senators in the Tribune of Honour-were about 1000 more spectators The price of admission to the arena was half-share, or fourpence halfpenny, to the seats, on fire, or nine-pence My friend being a journalist, had carefully provided himself with a couple of tickets, so we enjoyed the entertainment as (load-heads " Why not" The 300,000 spectators at the ancientCirc is Maximus were invariably dead-head It is good now and again to rub up our classical memories Patient el suceeded forever ' Only the swarthy and unwashed young Roman citizen, in a slouched hat and a ragged suit of 'dittoes" who prowled about the seats with a basket full of cakes, oranges, sausages, and cigars resembling the dried leaves rats, and little flasks of wine with paper stoppers, did not offer us any of their wares gratuitously, There was a chariot race going on as we took our seats, the course being a wide track laid with tan and running right round the arena. I turned to invoke Maicenas, descendant of kings, and say something neat and Horatian to him on the subject of the Olympian games, but Moon as was not there he never is when you want him-and when I looked down on the drivers urging onwards their panting and foaming steeds I found to my dismay that the chariots, about eight in number, were not atoll of tho"biga"or "quadriga" order. There were three bad imita- tions of an American trotting waggon, a feeble plagiarism of an Australian buggy, a downright gig, a cabriolet without a hood, the ghost of a man phaeton, and a mysterious little shandrydan which in my youth used to be known as a " denied," but which it would be safer to call a " conveyance." The horses were arrant screws, and the charioteers excited them to speed not only by the unsparing use of the whip, but by yelling, anathematising, and do riding them. The last device seemed realty to give them an impetus I thought of the Western trapper who, walking abroad w thou this rule, uuo-poctauly met a bear. "I had no shooting-iron," the trapper was accustomed to narrate, " but I missed that bar and bemoaned his powerful, and the critter growled and concluded to get, that is, to decamp. One of ? the screws the most powerfully " besmeared " one, perhaps contrived to stagger just as the ' treeguard " or post, and the triumphant winner drove his trotting waggon round the circus alone, was, mg a red flag in token of this victory when, after a brief lull, and the per formance of a jangling march by a military band, came a horse ice, ridden by lady, jockeys, in Amazon efforts of course One of the fair daughters of Chifney won. her hair in a pigtiul-roney a jockey in a pigtail' 'The tresses of another boy. dishevelled of. cr her shoulders, while a third equestrienne ta as thrown from his horse. the crops r," however, was of no great moment, she fell softly, and came to no worse grief than the loss of her chignon, which was subsequently drawn trod and restored to her by the careful reader of the ice-covered track.
