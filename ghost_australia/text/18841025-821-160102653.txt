RACING IN VICTORIA. THE VICTORIAN AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. Second Day. rev Tfilea-rarth. I TFrom our own Reporter.! Melbourne. October IS. The second day of the V.A.T.C. Spring Meeting was the moBt successful ever held at CaulGeld. The weather was dull and. over cast in the. morning, but there was no rain, and. the attendance most nave Deen some thousands in advance of any previous meeting. Not only ' was the Stand crowded, but during the races there was scarcely 'standing room on the lawn. The sport was first-class, the finishes in the Murray Handicap and Steeplechase being yery exciting. The Cup was a great boil-over for backers, as Blink Bonny was scarcely backed at allj except by the Tas manian, division, and her owner only won £2,000. Cracknell had been engaged to ride ber, but Hingwood beat her so easily in a trial at Ballarat early in the week that be refused the mount, and the result was that on the day of the race Cracknel^ was engaged for Helene, and Blair, who was to have.ridden the Lockley's filly, was obliged, very much against his will, to pilot the ulti mate winner. Last year the ring ' were heavily hit over Calma's victory, but to-day Blink Bonny amply revenged them. Anarchy whs pulled out of the Selling Race, and aiter a good contest Mistake disposed of Castaway and Stonebroke rather easily. Backers plunged on to Ontario, When the numbers went up for the hurdle race, but the owner, resenting the interference, promptly scratched the big horse, and relied upon Hazard. . Gasalier. was. made warm favourite,. but after getting over the last fence Hazard beat her easily. Schobeloff was in front to the turn, but retired directly Hazard and Gasalier came on'the scene. The Nursery Handicap was a grand fight between three, and it waB only in the last few strides that The Teacher Becure'd the verdict. The Cud came next, and the twenty-eight coloured weighed out. Vergy looked so well when stripped that there was a rush to get on him, and he left the paddock a very hot favourite at 3 to 1, Colstoun was not liked, bnt Martini-Henry came again, and at one time touched 10 to 1, while Fryinypan, Bend Or, and Helene were most in demand of the others. The story of the race is told elsewhere. Colstoun was never dangerous, and neither was Bend Or, hut the rest of the favourites r&n; well, though they were all beaten by a couple of outsiders. Vergy had bad luck or he would certainly have Deen second, but Blink Bonnv had the race in hand half a mile from home, and won just as she pleased. Lord Wilton was always in a nice place, and ran a good colt, con-1 sidering that he had only gone the dis tance twice before the race. Fryingpanand Martini-Henry were both under suspicion before the start, and in all probability their racing career is nearly over. The hero of the piece was Malua, who seemed to be galloping over everything at the finish, despite the fact that Mr. Inglis was apparently making no effort to ride nim oat. The Steeplechase was worth going miles to see. Ten horses raced in cluster almost from the start to the finish, and after a grand set-to Straggler won by a head from the Tasmanion Echo. Our representative: Chester, jumped badly, and was outpaced from the start, while tne much vaunted Marquis, of Waterford also ran badly. Directly betting opened on the .Windsor Handicap there was a rush to.get qn St, John, tod the trainer of Mr. Hart's colt endeavoured to follow the Ontario example, bpt finding himself too late to scratch ,he was obliged to let tbe horse rnh. Entering the straight he and Irrallee were together, but St. John rati out towards the rails, 'and Mozart disposing of Irralee without 4a ■ effort,' scored another victory for Tasmania'. During the afternoon a .very heavy' commission .was executed in favour of Newitead for the Mari byrnong Plate, . , the colt being backed to win ' £10,000 at about. 12 to 1. In the rooms'at night'Vergy appeared to be in most demand for the Melbourne Cup, while Uralla and Melodious were backed at 6 to 1 each for theMaribyrnong Plate, New stead at 10 to 1, and 3"he Teacher at 12 to 1. There were offers to take'7 to 4 against Bargo for tbe Derby. . The following are the results 1 SELLING RACE, > ' .' Of 100 sovs. The winner to be soli for £150.

To a wretched start Satire and Telltale were off first, bnt after going a few strides Mistake and Hi nnibal went to the front land made play to the tnm, where Stonebroke ana Castaway were rapidly getting on terms. Hannibal retired at the distance and left Mistake in front from Castaway, faint though the latter challenged vigorously she could never get up, and was beaten by a snort length. Stonebroke was the same distance off third, with Hannibal, Achmet, and Hopetoun following in the order named. Time; 1 min, 6 sec. SECOND HURDLE RACE.

Tantalizer was the first off, with Don Quixote, Sinking Fund, and Scobeloff next, the others being close handy. At the five-furlong' post Scobeloff took Becond place, with Sinking Fund and Fishhook next, and there was no alteration to the turn, where Scobeloff joined Tantalizer, with Ditto and Sundowner close up. Passing the Stand Tantalizer, Scobeloff, Sinking Fund, and Hazard jumped almost together, with the others in a cluster, but rising the hill Scobeloff took a clear lead from Tantalizer and Hazard, while Gasalier, who had been running in the rear, now ran through her field and tock third place. Scobeloff held a clear lead of Gasalier and Hazard at the back of the course, the three coming right away from the field as they raced round the far turn. The South- Eastern horse kept his place until nearing the turn, when he shut up suddenly and Gasalier was left in front, but Hazard caught her at the final hurdle and won easily by three lengths. Scobeloff was. pulled up and. Tattler obtained third plape, with Sundowner, Scobeloff, and Fishhook next, in the'order named. Time, 4 min. 8 sec. NURSERV HANDICAP.

Gasburner quickly retired in favour of Wolseley, Delamia, and Ocista, who ran abreast past the half-mile and round the turn. Entering the straight Wolseley, on the inside, was joined by The Teacher, and a grand race home resulted in the latter staying longer and winning by a short head.

Harrington, Yately, and Fryingpan. Thelot came oh in fair line for 100 yards, when Lavington over powered Weazel and dashed to the front. As they began to.settle into their .places Yately was following the leader, with Bend Or. Vergy, Battali ons, and Privateer at the head'of tne others, the rear . being hronght np by Argent, and Malna. : (At the Stand Lavington led- Yately a length,'.and' then came Battalions, Helene, and . Vernet, with Vergy, Bapid, Norfolk, Lord Wilton, Fryingpan, Martini-Henry. Colstoun, and Bend Or in good places, -while Malua and The Agent were still whipping, in.. Signer fell opposite tne Judge's box, and created some confusion among the rear most horses, Going up the hill Lavington was pulled back to Yately, and Batalious and Helene still lying together were just clear of Vergy, Norfolk, and Bapid, who were heading the main. body, in' the centte of which Colstonn's rose jacket was.very conspicuous. As tbey began to . make the descent Yately took up the running, and carried them along at a 'clipping pace, Lavington' lying second; with Helene and Battalions in their ' original' places, and Bapid, Lord Wilton, Norfolk,' ana Vergy Well clear of a bunch, among which the colours erf Fiyingpan, Martini-Henry, Colstonn, and Claptrap Were conspicuous, while Malna hid de serted the company of The Agent, and was going up to his field on the ontside. Bating along the far side of the course, Yately increased his advan tage to three lengths, and lavington, Helens, Battalions, Bapid, and- Lord Wilton kept their positions, hut1 Norfolk strack Vergy, and the favourite dropped hack several places, 'while it' could nbw be seen'that Colstonn was failing to stand his ground.. Yately held his own round the far' turn;' Helene was doting on Lavington, and1 Lord Wilton joined Battalions, whue Blink Bonny could be seen catching her horses on the outside, and Fiyingpan was also improv. his place, hut vergy was still lying with uig r , . — the ruck, and Colstoun was rapidly fading away. Yately continued to lead them along the, bena, bnt before tbe half-mile poBt was reached Helene bad passed Lavington ana got to the grey's girths, the Lockleys mare being* very cloaely, attended by Battalions and Lord Wilton, with Blink Bonny coming np hand over band on the out-' side, the. only others left with any chance now! being Vergy, Fryingpan, Claptrap, and Martini-! Henry. Blink Bonny made her run at the turn, and; Helene coming with her the pair 'caught Yately,' and Blink Bonny taking a clear lead she pulled in' next the rails as they entered the straight, and,! with Blair looking round at bis pnrsuers, it' was evident tbe race was all over. Vergy here made: a great ran'on tbe ontside, and for a moment his: name was shouted as the winner, bnt, though he and thongh Lord Wilton, who had followed the Tasmanlan mare and Helene into the straight,' headed the latter at the distance and struggled on: he could never catch Blink Bonny, who won easilyl by nearly three lengths. Malua was set going at' tne top of the straight, and came like a shot from a gun at the finish, and was only beaten by a neck for1 third place, with Claptrap fifth, Helene Blxth,' Fryingpan seventh, and Martini-Heniy eighth.
