With the Cape York Prospecting Party.- XIV. Being an Account of a Trip from Cape York to the Carron Range, with Various Peninsula Sidelights. By M.W.S. The Cape York Aboriginals.—A Short Account of Their Customs, &c;, with a Few Words of Their Different Dialects. Language. The pronoun* and the tenses of verbs in the Cape York dialects are bewildering and hair-bleaching institution!. You get a pronoun " upended" and admire the results of yAir labour, and then you hitch him on to * verb and he is knocked Into the un determinable shape of a Donnybrook hat. The native habit of applying names when speaking of absent third persons, and the finger or chin when speaking to or of people present, may have helped to demoralise the grammatical persons. Sometimes they pre cede a verb with elision of end of pronoun and beginning of verb ; sometimes they are found in a changing affix attached to the verb; and sometimes goodness only knows wber£ they are. And etlll if a person but -s«t, himself to the thorough comprehension of (Be language it might prove not a whit more difficulty nor unexplainable than, say, Latin. I have taken the verb " go," pre sent 'tense, as an example of native con struction, and 1t really appears a much simpler and more reasonably constructed tense than the Latin " 80, is, it," *c. The termination " urra" —" durra," " mnrra," " gurra"—is the general verbal indication of present motion. Examples : Climb, rituagamurra ; crush, akelgurra ; cry, mnggungamurra ; cut, utedung-gurra ; eat, atedurm; laugh, ung-garung-gurra; paddle, utyena-gurra ; sail, reng-gamurra ; shave, angkarunggurra ; seize, glbaburra ; speak, ekaJkamurra; drink, ung-genga; dance, uncht-gul-kamurra ; come here, impe blnno ;go away, elnpira. Those words are of the Oudung language. Cape York littoral, and I •m indebted for some of them to Mr. M'Oillivray's collection of Oudung words. The following Yadlgan equivalents of the same English words show a very striking differnce between the languages, or dialects : —Climb, ampanya ; crush, ithop unya ; cry, yunka ; cut, yokungota ; eat, unyah ; laugh, ungari ; paddle, korabbo ; sail, antuanm wllll ; shave, ota-ta ; seise, eperri ; speak, itch* ; drink, epinya ; dance, evaitcha ;' come here, antharro ; go away, endendi ; sing, ewaramea ; cold, unkmnba ; hot, umi ; thunder, unthadmo ; lightning, waaho-wampa. I made several effort* to discover if those verbs underwent any change in regard to number or time, and am satisfied that they undergo no change in those respects. Cape York Dialect*.
