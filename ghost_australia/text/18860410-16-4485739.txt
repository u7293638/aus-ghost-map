THE GULF COUNTRY. By J. R. C in the Queenslander. Vv active brown horse carrying a saddle, a pouch, a quart pot, and a gumsucker. An old sociable bay horse carrying a saddle quart pot, a big swag, two pairs of hobbles buckled round his neck, and aw co suite of a blackboy That's us, the former is the winter If anyone thinks it a pity I didn't let the blackboy write, if hell drop a line the nigger can write up the next trip we make. We left Normanton on the 22nd of February A strong sun glares down on 119 as we make our way of 61 the hard spinifex ridges outside the town The heat is intense almost beyond en orange but we 0 stay it out A few miles puts us beyond the edges, and we got on to open plains, well grassed The country is low and swampy, were following up the Norman River A fringe of mange ove grows along the bank, now and then we go through a belt of stunted timber poplar gum, blood woods, bastard stringy bark 01 messmate, and 1 tree entirely new to me, called "gutta poieha'wood in these par is ilioappoarnncoof the foliage of the gutta percha is exactly like an English damson tice, but the trunk 13 coal sor The branches are tough, and sold freely without by taking As you bend the boughs a white milky substance comes from the pores of the bill and milks the wood sticky and unpleasant to handle I am told the foliage is poison some months past a drover lost several valuable rams by it He camped and made a yard of the boughs, the sheep ate the leaves and died Dr every passing this way may make a note of this Twelve miles up the Norman River then 0 is a rocky crossing at a fall Alligators are said to be plentiful and dangerous in this locality, but they were probably away from home when we crossed I am as laid no Southern people are had by these alligator yarns we hear The fact It alligators are scarce and very timid, one might Ino on the Norman River a year and never see one Gulf water is said to pi notice a remarkable aptitude for telling lies , as all games are almost unknown South, of course they all ord a fair held to one who has di milk Gulf water from this out I intend to "pan out' all alligator stones I hear After crossing the river we of an oiled up through the bush. The country is sandy, with numerous lagoons and swampy crooks often apel ding it Here and those we cross an iron stone ridge glowing wattle scrub On the sandy flats of the co is the only timber, and we stop along theories, wet ground sixteen or seventeen miles until we reach the mci again, which now makes away eastward the tide does not come up this far The river is muddy with a slight fresh, and we have a difficulty crossing until at last we come to a place where a few ti-trees grow in the water We flounder 111 among boulders and deep holes and finally (got over safely, but wet It is great fun to my companion, who laughs is moderately and seems to have no fear 01 knowledge of danger After crossing we travel on through thickly grassed plains and for est country up Spear Creek, which bears about south west Coolabah is the only timber now, it grows all over the flats This means flooded country, which doubtless will require consideration when the Cloncurry railway is making A great quantity of rain has fallen on this country lately The track is sloppy, every lagoon and hole is full Birds of all kinds abound in the forest, great flocks of black cockatoos precede us coming as they fly from tree to tree I see little over Wagtail here, or perhaps I should call him the fan tail fly catcher , Ina habitat seems to be all over Australia, I know him well on the Murray Little kingFishers Hit about on the water edge, and in every lagoon there are black ducks lace also flocks of this, spur winged plover, slate back merinos, and the long war by spoon bill stalking cautiously along, with his neck stretch ed and the weather eye open Clouds of w whistling ducks ino everywhere, and so very tame that my companion is afforded much amusement by throwing sticks at them and occasionally hitting one In his way he-the boy I mean is a character he is a keen ob- serves , no sign or secret of the for cat escaped lunches is great at hunting the small by 1 rubbish of the bush At one dinner camps he will the 11 out lizards and grubs from all sorts of unexpected places. He reads them, and has great feeds Sometimes when he has a very tasty morsel In iguanas tail or a fat grub he fetches it to me, and says, " on , you budgeree lockout " But his opinion and mine on the subject of " budgeree cuckoos" do not agree, so he generally has it all to himself During the heat of noonday wo camp under the seas on the sandy bank of the clock 'those great shade trees as 0 called " pear s " They are certainly no relation to the english pear They have a very heavy foliage of broad leaves and a rough bark, and they grow to a height of 30ft or 40ft Their shade is very acceptable I notice also other shade trees a pool variety of cedar, stunted and small, but evidently a cedar Unlike the larger variety that grows in open places, sometimes away from other timber, but only along the creeks or on big lagoons Pushing on again we travel through scrubs of the gutta pel elia tree, with belts of coolabah, and occasional plains, until dark, when we camp near a big lagoon After a banquet oil a roasted whistler that we caught this afternoon cock spreads his own bed-myself a waterproof coat and a small rug, the blackboy our two saddlecloths-and then on our saddle pillows we beck sweet balmy sleep, but by and by an odd mosquito comes along and disturbs us slightly 1 many, however, I doze off until the wind ceases, then I awake with a peculiar sensation of prickly heat about the hands and face What ! Mosquitoes ÃŽ By the great Caesar's ghost, believe you I spend the balance of the night cowering over a smoking fire I have made some yards away At dawn I am after the horses Returning to the camp I find Mr Blackboy with his bare feet tied up in my blanket, his head in the bag that our flour had been in his hands under his head asleep, clouds of mosquitoes around him I found turn up, and we get out of an uncomfortable camp as quickly as possible At this place there is a sand ridge that runs parallel with the creek for a few miles, a little timber of the same val letica as grow around Normanton, just a mile or two of spinifex, and we are on to the swampy plains and coolabah Hats, as before, Hooded ground every where Think it over, you railway engineers On the plains the Flinders and Mitchell grasses grow luxuriantly, and (in the swamp) sorghum grows to a height of 5ft or 6ft Melon vines and ci keepers of all kinds are at their best I notice also a vine very much resembling that of a sweet potato that the horses ate with a relish All day we have been passing through cattle country, occasionally we have seen small mobs standing in the waterholes with just their hear Is out, this is to got away from the flies Inovciy shallow holes the water is stirred up and muddy If I could spare the time, the inconvenience of standing in the water would be as nought to the curse of the flies, and I would gladly adopt it Thousands of Hies busy round your head from earliest dawn to dark, they are into every morsel of food you eat, you have to strain drowned flies through your teeth as you drink your tea I feel that I cannot do justice to these Hies here, so I pass At sundown we reach Vena Park station, the property of A S Haydon The country around is magnificent The home station is situated on the side of a great lagoon, half a mile long by a quarter of a mile wide, a splendid sheet of water, permanent with gently sloping banks, a useful hole, to which cattle can descend at any place I see the milking cows, mountains of beef, brought in this evening by the gins maids of all work here, general servants, gardeners c To see a (in carrying water out of the lagoon to the vegetable garden at day dawn is a novel sight and more they do it without being told We spend the night here, with nearly as many mosquitoes as last night. The bullock is fat the damper is not shoddy Leaving the station the country continues good, and in splendid condition. The creek gets smaller as we go up, and the country seems to use a little Though we (go through miles of blue bush Huts, yet Everything seems to indicate dryer ground. There are flocks of galahs and topknot parrots, plain and key a emus, and native comp mons stalk about unmolested on the plain At dinner camp my friend caught a little bush rat that is a stranger to me, a little gray fellow about the size of a house rate with silky fur climber too, as he caught it in a tree spent It was roasted, and went the same way as other small fry who catches, and no doubt was budgeree lockout ' At 2 or i o clock we make the lower end of a very large waterhole on the far bank of which stands Iffley station This is the finest inland waterhole I have seen ABI steamer could turn in it. There are legends about alligators having been seen in this hole , it is scarcely probable they are so far inland Crocodiles, however, abound, and it fell to my lot to see one, a big ugly brute about 16ft long, with great scales on him. He is said to be quite harmless , he don't look so. Here it is evident we are done with the flooded ground ; the country has become downs all at once Our camp is a comfortable one without mosquitoes Next day at noon we left Spear Creek and crossed over the watershed dividing it from the Saxby River, there is no range The Saxby isabigchannc!, now running almost a banker from recent rains near the head The country about here is not well grassed. On camp eighteen miles up the Saxby was a bad one, and to make matters worse we met with a handful time by my friend's horse filling into the river, rider and all, and so getting everything we possessed except one little stock of tea and sugar which I have carried in my pouch We got out of our camp early and pushed forward over country fairly well grassed, with all lagoons full Twenty miles on we saw Taldora station just a mile or two to the left The country improves a we go on it could not be in better condition every billabong, every lagoon, is full, and the river itself running At sundown we camp in among the billabongs on splendid grass and water, though our own nation bag is short The few crabs that we caught in a hole by our Lamp afford something to pick at until sleeping time. Another day over plains growing every con sensible kind of grass and herbage, with great Hollis of pigeons flying to and fro across the track, brings us to Millungera station, Mcie filth Alciuics, and Co, owners, where the hospitable manager, Mr Nutting, making things lively for everyone until my horses are on grasS myself seated at as well covered table, and my blackboy up to his eyes in beef and his end, in the camp, then, and only then, did this white man last and inquire where I'd come of from and about the country, and soon And when I had finished my dinner, and he said, 1 here's cigars in that box, whisk) in that bottle, and books thee, my soul went out to him in gratitude Never in my life did I am requite kindness and hospitality more, for I was tuckered out completely Millungera is a big inn, with about 20 000 head of cattle upon it The home station house is a good one, built at great expense a 12ft l c and all round a good kitchen, stores, and outbuildings, with a good pens ment hole of water close by Just a short distance away from the house in Meredith a piave Poor Meredith' the last time I saw him was it Ijiuerald, when he also had the last teams away to commence improving this country He was a man of great energy and perseverance Work keep doing,, was his motto The two lines on his tombstone are well "chosen Whatever the final findeth to do Do it with Ho pursuit After leaving Milluiigcia we followed up unborn Creek for tim by miles over country almost destitute of grass and water then crossed over to the -"Flinders, where there is abundant water but no grass Another day of Unit) miles blinks as to the main Oloiieuiry road As I am now into well known country it will scarcely interest you to vi rise more
