THE GHOST UPON THE BAIL. \ ??? ''????? ????? ? \rikVtBB-i.' ?'..- It;waa a mnM?1»\ight— an Australian winter's night— in the middle of July, when; two wealthy farmers, in the dirtrict of Pen rith, Now South 'Wales, sat of er tho fire of : .?'?'.. a public-house, which was about a milo dis tant from their homes. Tho namool tuo ono was John Fisher, and of the other Edward! .Smith. Both of these farmers, had boon transported to the colony; tad served their1 tiine; bought land; cultivated it ; and pros ..-. pored. Fisher had the reputation of being. posse'lsod o( a considerable sum in ready: moiSjr -, arid it was well known that he was: ttieVmortgagee ot BBveral houses in the town ; . of Sydney, besides being the owner of a ?:-.'. farm of three. hundred acres, which was; rery productive, and on which ho lived. Smith- also was in good circumstances ; : : arising out of his own exertions 03 his f arm ; ;but, uulike his neighbour, he had not put : ? by much money. ' yfhj don't you go home, John, and see i your friends and relations?' asked Smith ; ; V ' ' yoiibe now very warm in the pookot, and, ;- ' mark my words, they would be very glad to ''???':'-..':.

There was a small l ; score against him ; and While taking the V money the landlord remarked that he was .:. .-.; \v \sorry.Mr. Fisher had not kept his word and ?ocm» to bid him 'good-bye.' Mr. Smith ' ; explained that Fisher had very good reasons : for haviUg his departure kept a secret until after he had loft the colony; not that he r» wanted^ to idefraud anybody, far from it, he ;. N added.'and then darkly hinted , that one of V .; vMr.'.'Fishir'sp'ribcipal reasons for going off .; ' sostealthily was to prevent being annoyed ':.--. by a woman who wanted him to marry her. ?'?i\ i!iAi)i:lEBe,' said the landlord, ('and \- that's what he must have meant that night when he said, 'if I don't you'll hear the reason why!' *'? I '^Ifeelthelosa of his society very much,' said. Smith, 'for when we did. not come here together to spend our evening, he would come to my house, or I would go to bis, to play cards, smoke a pipe, and drink a; glass of grog. Having taken charge of alFhia affairs, under a power of attorney, I , hajp gone to livo at his place, and left my overseer in charge of my own plaoe. When he comes baok in the course of a oouple of years, I am going home to England, and he will do for me what I am now doing for him. ' Between otlrselvM, Mr. Dean, h* has gone hometb%eta wife.' ' ??Indued !''.said the landlord. Here the conversation ended and Mr. Smith went home. .? :( ,: Fisher's sudden departuro occasioned some . surprise throughout the district, but when ; the explanation afforded byfMr. Smith was ? , spread abroad by Mr. Deal, the landlord, /.'; people ciased to tliink any tore about the !;V 'Vj .-matter, n . . . ' !?? ; .. 1 .;;,']., A yeaf elapsed^'and Mr.sSmith gays out ?i'.;: that ho had ;reoeived:=;* letter from f':^;; Fisher, /in, which he stated that it was : ,;V ? - not'his iritentioni' fo retura to Sydney ; and ?£:-;. that he wished the whole of his property to : -, be sold, and' the iproceeds remitted to him. s '; ; Tuis letter Mr. Smith showed to several of ..-Fisher's most ' intimato i acquaintances, , j, ; who regretted extremely that they would rs; ;l»ee no more of scj good a neighbour and so ; -;: ? worthy a man. ! ; \- f; Acting upon the power of attorney which, .: .».?:.'. he held, Mr. Smith * advertised the property ?~-. ^-yfo^sale :j the.farm, the livestook, the farm ; v.;x'ux;implem,eiits, the furniture,- etc., in the: ?. ;i!M farmhouse; also 6omo cottages and pieces of : i-,.;,-i'Uud iu and uoar Sydney aid Parramatta : with Fisher's mortgagors, also, he came to an agreement for the repayment, withiu a few months, of the sums duo by them. rOHAPTEH H; About a month previous to the day of sale, an old man, one David Weir, who farmed a small pieco of land in the Fenrith road, and who took every .week to the Sydney market, butter, eggs, fowls, and a few bushels of Indian maize, was returning to his home, when he saw, seated on a rail, tho well known form of Mr. Fisher. It was V6ry dark, but the figure and face were as plainly visible as possible. The old man, who was not drunk, though ho had boen drinking at Dean's public-house, pulled-up and called out, 'Hulloa, Mr. Fishor! I thought you wore at .home in England}' There was no reply and the old man, who tros impatient to get homo, as was his horso, loosed the reins and procooclod on his jour aey. ' Mother,' said old Weir to his wife, while she was helping him off with his old top-coat, ?' I've seen either Mr. Fishor or his ghost.' ' Nonsense !' oried the old woman ; ' you could not have seen Mr. Fisher, for he is in Old England; and as for spirits, you never see any without drinking them ; and you aro full of 'em now.' ' Do you mean to say I'm drunk, mother ?' ' No, but you have liquory our on board.' 'Yes, but I can see, and hear, and under stand, and know what I nm about.' : 'Well, then, have your supper arid go to bed, and take my advice, and say nothing to anybody about this ghost, or you will only get laughed at for your pains. Ghost esses, indeed ! at your age to take on about such things, after swearing all your life you nevor believed in them.' 'But I tell you I saw him as plain as plain could be; just us. we used to see him sitting sometimes when the day was warm, and ho had been round looking at his fencos to soo that they were all right.' ' Yes, very well, tell mo all about it to morrow,' said the old woman. 'As I was up before daylight and it is now nearly midnight, I feel too tired to listen to a story about a prh.-.st. Have you sold everything well?' : ?/'' ' Yes, and brought back all tho money safe. Hore it is.' Tho old man handed the bag over to his partner, and retired to his bed ; not to rest, however, for the vision had made so great an impression upon his 'mind he could not help thinking of it, and lay awake till daylight, when he arose, as did his wife, to go through the ordinary avocations of the day. After. ho had milked the cows, and brought the filled pails into the dairy whero the old woman was churn ing she said to him : ' Well, David, what about the ghost ?' ' I tell you I seed it,' said the old man. ' And there's no call for you to laugh at mo. If Mr. Fisher be not gone away —and I don't thiuk be would have done so without coming to say good-byo to us — I'll make a talk of this. I'll go and tell Sir John, and Dostor Mackenzie, and Mr. Cox, and old parsi-n Fulton, and everybody else in the commission of the peace. I will, .is I am a living man ! What should take Fisher to England? England would be no homo for him after being so mauy years in this coun try. And what's more he has told mo as much many a time.'' \ 'Well, and so he has told mo, Duvid. But then, you know, people will alter thoir minds, and you hoard what Mr. Smith said about that woman ?' 'Yos. But I don't boliovo Smith. I nevor had a good opinion of that man, for he could sever look me straight in tho fnco, and he is too oily a character to please iae; If, as I tell you, Mr. Fisher is not alivo in this country then that was his ghost that I saw, and ho has blen murdered ? ' Be caro(Jl, David, what you say ; and whatever you do don't offend Mr. Smith. Bomember he is a rich man, and you are a poor one ; and if you say a word to his dis credit, he may take the law 'of you, and make you pay for it; and that would boa pretty business for people who aro striving tn lay by just enough to keop them when they are no longer ible to work.' .'? 'There'B been foul jploy,! 1: tell you,, old woman. Jam cortaiu of it.' 'But'ihafc'can't bo proved' by you saying that you saw a ghost sitting on a rail, when yiiU were coming-home from market none the hotter for what you drank upon the road. And if Mr. Fisher should be alivo ia England — and you know that letters have lately been ' received from : him— what } a preoious fool you would look 1' ' Well, perhaps you are right. But wheul tell you that I saw either Mr. Fishor or his ghost sitting on that rail,. don't laugh at me because you will raakb mo angry !'.' . . ' Well, I won't laugh at you, though , it must have been your fancy, old man. Whereabouts was it you saw or thought you sawhim?/' ?! :? :,',' ^- ...; . ' . . ,] 'You know; the cross fence that divides Fisher's land from Smith's— near . the old bridge at tho bottom of Iron Gang Hill ?' 'Yes.1! 5' Well, it was there. I'll tell you what he was dressed, in. You hnow that old fus tian coat with ythe brass buttons, and the corduroy waistcoat and trousers, and that red silk bandanna handkerchief that he used to tie round bis neok ?' ; 'YeB.' . ?., ' .. ; ? ' . ,; . . ' Well, that's how he was: dressed. His straw hat he held in'his left hand, arid' his right arm was resting on.one of tho'poata. I was about ton or nloyen yards from him, for the road is broad -just there and the fence stands well 'back.' ? ?, ''And you called him,,y'ou say ?'y,- ; : 'Yes, but he did not' 'answo'r. If tho horse had not beenjso fidgbly, 'I'd havo got down and gone up to him.' ' And then you would have found out that it was all smoke.' Say that again and you will put me into a passion.' Tho old woman held hor tongue, and suf fered old. David to talk all that day and the next about tho ghoBt, without making any remark whatever. (To Ix continued^
