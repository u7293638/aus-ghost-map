The sports meeting organise^ by the Amateur Athletic Association cfj Victoria and the Amateur Cyclists' Unionjwas held at St. Kilda oo Saturday, The weather was dull and showery, with the result that the attendance was only moderate.

Not for years has thejaeof®* trary of the club had the pleasure of writing down such satisfactory lists of entiles as these which have been seat in for the various events. On the list we notice quite a contingent of visitors, which goes jbo show that) the (Sorts of the Q,T.C. are command ing th'1 attention of horse-owners at a dis tant.

It has always ap peared to us that club runs are mote pronounced failures the larger a club grows. It is only the smaller organisa tions that get any thing like representa tive musters. The prime object of a bicycle club used *o fee to organise an enjoyable run with the members on a Saturday afternoon or Sunday, or, may be, on some holiday. Now It is different. A club's committee seems only to have one object in view— to make the club's coffers heavy. And this is done by inducing all and sundry to Join, with an occasional race meeting as a speculation. * * # ' 1'latt-BetU once again has broken ,a record -news which seems to be attaining a stereotyped regularity in its announce ment, The English paced crack made bis b -w to the Australian publican Sydney on Saturday last at the opening of the Summer meet of the local league. An exhibition mile spurt attracted his attention, and by the aid of pacemakers he wheeled the distance in the Australian record time of hnin. -losec. In an attempt to lower th« rive miles-Australasian record, which at present stands at ttmin. SOse^-as made by Lwna at Adelaide, Betts was unsuccess ~ ful by 1 Cwtc, owing to a few seconds bejog lost oo account of the tire of the pacing machine blowing out, as ho was easily inside the record up to four miles. *W * # The final heat of the- International Scratch Mile at the above meetiog was run twice.

March meeting, when he went searching for the sijalp of Knnwlee, the Australian manager oi a certain bike company, for not Hipply ing him with proper pacing trains; and another at liallarat (Vic.) last- \raas Day, whwi Bill threatened to ping one of the riders iii a certain race. When, however, the trainer uf the rider in question, who was at one, time middle-weight champion of Victoria, informed ' Plugger Bill ' that he did the punching anrf tifrft racing mfrn the pedalling, Bill politely withdrew. * * = * The saddest of thoughts is a dinner of hash, The eaddest of words 'It might have been,' But the saddest of things is a bicycle smash Onahired-for-the-afternoonnewncachine. * # * In Ohio a tricycle is used f ur conveying prisoners to the lockup. Of course the man who is being jugged refuses to do any pedalling. * * * We will readily admit that) there are hundreds of fools who ride bicycles, but you muBt allow that there are thousands of tools who don't. * # * In cycling espeaiaUy, it is not always that great strength and great endurance go together.

The First-clans Handicap was won by Morrison, wish Snowden second, and Middleton $h'rd. Porta got home first in the Ten mile Scratch, The great event of the year — the Mel bourne Cup — will be run'on Tuesday next, when- thousands of excited and interested persons will be there to see Ine finish, while thousands of others unable to get there will be anxiously waiting the result, tip to time of writing thirty remain in, and, according to betting, Wait-a-bit i3 the favourite. We do not oretend to know too much ; we, therefore, will endeavour to reverse the visual tipster's method, with the knowledge that we can't) make a bigger mess of it than the average man. Waita bit (a name Bu&cienb; to stiffen any horse) hasn't a ghost of a show ; Trent, Pbsitano, Aurrnn, Fueile, and Delaware are in the same boat. Coil may have a show, but, if he has, well, t-h-*n. Battalion must have a better. We think the following half-dozen will 'furnish the winner : Battalion, l'ar thenu[_.-tiu8, Devon, Gaulus, The Marry Boy, or True Blue. If an outsider should get home it may be in Aurum, Wait-a-bit, Fucile, or Delaware. A motto for the race track : 'Of the making of books there U no end.' * # * Cabled $ha-% Mrs. Lang try won £40,000 by the victory of Merman, an Australian horse, by Grand Flaneur, the Hawkesbury sir?, in she Cesarewich Stakes in England a fortnight back.
