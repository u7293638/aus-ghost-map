PENNANT HILLS. Mrs. Muir, an old and respected resident of this district, died rather suddenly on Thurs- day night of last week. She had been ailing and had removed to Paling's, at Thornleigh, but her death was un- expected. A daughter who came down from up-country that morning, being fatigues with her journey, deferred visiting her mother till next morning, when she learned that the old lady was dead. Death was due to heart failure. Mr. Geo. Evans' 17 year old son Herbert was critically ill in the Parramatta Hospital on Wednesday, and not expected to recover. The Lawn Tennis Club had an outing to the Prospect Reservoir on Tuesday. The Progress Association are anxious to have the work of repairing the New Line Road done as soon as possible. The matter was to have been discussed at last meeting, which lapsed. The Band of Hope will hold its regular meeting to-night. A lad named Arthur Evans was proceeding to work on Wednesday morning on an old horse which he had won in a raffle a few days before. When near Thompson's corner, the old curiosity suddenly stopped, shivered in every limb and fell down in the roadway, throwing its rider, who was unhurt. But the old nag rolled over twice and quietly gave up the ghost. The whole affair happened in less than ten seconds.
