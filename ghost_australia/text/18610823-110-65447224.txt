If he must needls publish his foulish desire for a public disciusica, he might in candour have pub. lished the ilote ill reply. The finc is that st evely fesh atitempt to a:gui the ques. tier, lii really shoc s mole and more his utter incapacity to cornmprehend the v,.ry terms of the controversy. . \Ve showed belore bow his argument was really an attempt to prove that tinti is not mind. We have in his last another absurd nitemlpt, to prove that matter is not matter.

We have had no intention of going further than merely ppminting out the lottenihess of the loundanuon of our Iesoatel's argnuielt, which an intellig. nt eye 'w, ht discern tit t glance. It is none of iut biiiiness to instruect our contem porary in metaphysics. If when his inind is duecred to the fallacy of ti e assumuptiot at the basis of his argument ; or when it is shewn how le is deceiving himself by the use of ambiguotus phiases, us for in stance in such terllms as "occupying space," " having locality," " being soume. wh.iut or something "-lte ms which when apphed to matter mean one thing, but wl en appllied to mind, mean another thing;-if we say when this is pointed out and lie yet does not apprehend this f;llury of ambiguous tee ms running through his argument, we can only refer heim to the A I3 C of mienal philosoplhy.
