Select poetry. THE EMIGRANT AT SEA. It is morning-and I am away From the star-spangled land of my- birth, From the sweet early breezes that play O'er that valley-, the fairest on earth. I am bound for a happier land, Than my fathers' can promise to be, Where the wings of my soul may expand, And Peace ! find her portion in thee ! My morning of life opened sweet, As the first building blossoms of May ; Fair hope strewed her flowers for my feet,. ' As the light of life broke on my day. But " the Winter TideSiligh on the blast," A As the sun of my hopes touched the noon ; While sorrows and storms flutter past, -And destroy my young hopes but too soon. It is evening-and calmly in sleep, The weaned waves cease their wild war, As we lie on the breast of the deep, The moon shines in silver after, "With a kiss to the ripples that try To mirror her form in their breast ; Rho tells of pure peace in the sky', And points to that haven of rest It is midnight-and I am alone ; How still is this ocean night hour ! '. Recalling the shades of the gone ; Even memory smiles at its power As it conjures some scene of the past, Like a ghost from the wave's silent bed, And beckons me " Hear in the blest, A requiem sung for the dead." Oh ! may I not hope, when the day Of life's journey is drawn to a close, To find a fair evening while they, Who love me, may share my repose Or till death sets his seal on my care, If to wander through life is my doom, "Must I wait for a resting place there Yes, an Emigrant's rest is the tomb ! \- South Australian.
