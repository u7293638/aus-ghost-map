WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 1, 1879. It cannot be denied that the New Year opens gloomily, and that the hope- ful tone which it is natural for the inhabitants of a young country to adopt as they close up the records of the year that is gone, and open the fair white page upon which is inscribed "the 1st of " January, 1879," is considerably dashed with anxiety and despondency. Yet it is not in the nature of Englishmen to succumb to depression, or to adopt the philosophy of despair. There is an element of elasticity in the national character, which enables us to sustain with an undrooping fortitude calamities and trials beneath which people of a less strenuous temperament, and with a less resilient energy, would sink in sheer submission to what they might regard as the inevitable. But in our language there is no such word as " Kismet." On many occasions and in many ways has the mother country stood upon the verge of what appeared to be an overwhelming catastrophe, and to be threatened with something like extinction. But she never lost heart, never relinquished her invincible trust in herself, and never omitted to act in the spirit of CROM WELL'S advice, by putting her trust in GOD and keeping her powder dry. Her statesmen never despaired of the re- public ; and in every great emergency some natural king of men stood forward, and by his wisdom at the council table, or his transcendant skill and valour on the field of battle or on the quarter deck of the admiral's flagship, he carried the nation through a tremendous crisis in her history, and vindicated her in- domitable pluck and prowess in the eyes of a half-envious half-admiring world . We should be degenerate descendants of the men who rose superior to every trial, and never flinched from con- fronting the most formidable dangers, we should be untrue to the noblest and most inspiring traditions of our race, and we should be unworthy to take up and continue that glorious his tory which covers the thousand years that have intervened between Alfred and Victoria, if we allowed ourselves to believe that the sombre cloud which now envelopes our prospects, is likely to be permanent, or that the popular de lusions which have been rie during the year that has just passed away, were less evanescent than similar phenomena have been in the mother country. There have been waves of political frenzy, as of religious fanaticism ; arising, nobody knew how or why, sweeping over the face of the population like an epi demic, stimulating people to strange excesses, and subsiding as rapidly and unnaccountably as they originated. Just as that ridiculous monster, CALIBAN, " made a wonder of a poor drunkard, and worshipped STEPHANO, SO we have seen or heard of multitudes of persons going mad in adoration of a fanatic like Lord GEORGE GORDON, or a profligate demagogue like JOHN WILKES ; hailing poor THOM of Canterbuyy as the MES SIAH, accepting FEARGUS O'CONNOR as the MOSES who was to lead them into a land flowing' with milk and honey , and indulging in de lirious transports of enthusiasm on behalf of such a wretched impostor as the corpulent butcher of Wagga Wagga. All these violent delights have had a ludicious termination, when the paroxysm of passion had spent its force, and then the idol of yesterday was either pitched into the dusthole or chopped up for firewood ; common sense resumed its sway, and all parties concurred in forgetting the delusion as soon as pos sible. It is this substratum of reason and mother-wit that preserves Englishmen from carrying such periodical crazes too far, and has saved them from the popular excesses of other countries, and especially from "the red fool fury of "the Seine". Thanks to that good sense, and to the more phlegmatic tem perament of the British people, " con " sideration, like an angel, comes and " whips the offending ADAM out of us," before we have proceeded to the ex tremeties of which more volatile and impulsive nations are capable under the strain of a similar excitement or the influence of a corresponding hallucina tion. During the last twenty years in this colony, we have seen at least half a dozen political fetishes set up, incense burnt before them, and the most ex travagant adulation offered to them, but they are now as much out of date as an old almanac, and as completely for gotten as the jokes of an ancient panto mime. And so, it maj be confidently predicted, it will be with the poli tical swashbucklers of today, who threaten us with broken heads and burning houses in so melodramatic a fashion "In my day, says GRAVES, in the late Lord Lytton's comedy of "Money," "I have been " already eighteen crises , six annihila " tions of agriculture and commerce, "four overthrows of the Church, and "three last, find, awful, and irreme " diable destructions of the entire con " stitution. Nevertheless England contrived to survive all these predicted evils, and proved herself to be none the worse for the gloomy vaticinations of foreign enemies, or of the more dyspeptic and atrabilious of her own children. And so it will be, we cannot doubt, with this colony if those who are permanently identified with its wel fare do their duty as good citizens, and resolutely and intelligently sustain then full share of the activities and responsi bilities of political life. For, as there are prejudices to be combated, errors to be dispelled, ignorance to be en lightened, and the insidious tactics of mercenary demagogues to be exposed and counteracted, these things can only be accomplished by the educated and propertied classes sustaining their legi timate portion of the work, and striving as zealously to efface the artificial line of demarcation between labour and capi lal, and to harmonise and consoli date the various elements of society, as the anarchists are labouring for its dis integration and destruction. And as to conserve and to build up is more bene ficent and blessed than to ravage and destroy, those who engage in these praiseworthy and patriotic efforts will have the satisfaction of knowing that they are doing their best to promote, both for themselves and for others, that which we wish our readers individually and collectively, namely, a Happy New leai According to a member of the United States Senate, the methods of appoint- ment to office in that country resolve themselves into " the system of compe " tition by demagogues in the matter of " ability to do the largest amount of " political dirty work-the ability, for " instance, to offer the greatest number " of drinks to thirsty voters on election " days." The statement has been chal- lenged by defenders of the system, but its general accuracy has been affirmed by some of the ablest writers, and by most of the leading reviews and independent organs of public opinion in America. Nothing has contributed moro effectually to the demoralisation of politics in the United States than the system animadverted upon, while it has led to wholesale plunder of the general revenue. It is estimated Ivy experts that the frauds which are annually perpetrated in the New York Custom-house, with the com- plicity of its officers, amount to four millions sierling. In the Pension Bureau of Philadelphia between £1,000,000 and £1,100,000 was pocketed by dishonest officials, who manufactured bogus claims. The investigations of the Indian Bureau at Washington, which owed their origin to Professor MARSH, the well- known scientist, disclosed the fact that hundreds of thousands of pounds had been paid to agents with the connivance of corrupt civil servants, and had never reached the Indians, who were starving for want of the supplies voted to them by Con- gress. In California the report pre sented to the Treasury department at Washington two years ago by Mr. A. B. Clark, the special revenue agent, showed that public appointments were. openly sold for £1,000 each and upwards, by a sort of office-broker known as Billy Carr ; , that one firm of distil lers had defrauded the revenue of £300,000 ; that the officers were regu larly, bribed, and allowed the distillers to make out their own returns of duty ; and that, in the words of Mr. Clark, " the civil service was utterly demoralised " by the partisan and despotic " authority of those in California who "cditiolk.il the 1 cdei ii pitiontge ti " A\ i4nn_ton, so tint eich oflieer, or " lus induction, sinipl} asked himself.
