She. ran down her casting In latitude «' S., and passed 8, of Van Dicmen's Land. A serious (Ire broke out on the 3rd of May, which, but for the energy displayed by all on board, might have terminated fatally. The (Ire broke out in the fore hold, dense volumes of smoke forcing ita way through the fore batch.' Bands were at once Bet to work to breach through the deck, and about twenty feet was ripped up and two engines set in motion to pour water below, After three hours' hard work tho flames were got under, when the hatches wcro opened and a considerable quantity ol the cargo stowed forward was found on fire and at once thrown overboard.

Co.'s new steamer Auckland arrived at Mel bourne on tbc 5th instant, after a passage of eighty days from London, and would leave again for Sydney forthwith. It is pro bable BLe will proceed to Auckland with the next mail. The Pluto (s.)— As the public are naturally anxious to obtain any information respecting this vessel, now considerably over-due at Brisbane, we give all the particulars that it has been possible to collect respecting her. As before stated, she left Sydney on the 26th ultimo, under the command of Captain Bowden, an ex- perienced officer, and was seen by the Yarra Yarra (s.) on the following day, a considerable distance a-head. At four p.m. on the same date the James Paterson sighted the Yarra Yarra, in shore, and at 5.30 p.m. the smoke of a second steamer was dis tinctly seen by the James Paterson, also in shore. The gale was at this time increasing in violence, the wind being from the S.S.E. The James Paterson held her course for Sydney until seven p.m., when she was compelled to bear up and run for Brisbane. She was then between Fort Macquarie and Smoky Cape, or some sixty miles of othe Solitaries. As the night wore on, the gale increased, the fires were banked up, and the steamer kept dead before the wind under a close-reefed foretopsail, the screw making sixteen revolutions per minute with the speed of the vessel. A fearful sea was running, and frequently broke on board, The Pluto ought therefore to have arrived at Brisbane on the night of the 28th or during the 29th, had all gone well. She was a remarkably well-built craft, and pronounced by competent judges to be a first-class ship. Of course, all is conjecture as to what has become of her, and opinions among nautical men intimately acquainted with the northern coast are divided. Some incline to the belief that ehe has hauled off the land and has lost her masts or damaged her machinery ; while others are of opinion, from the extraordinary high seas running during a heavy gale on this portion of the Northern coast, that she has been pooped and gone down by being fairly overpowered, We can only hope that the first idea may prove the true one, and that intelligence may be received of her having reached some port in safely. The Pluto was built by Mr. Cuthbert for the coast trade, and owned by the following gentlemen :— Messrs. Metcalfe, Norrie, Milson, P. N. Russell, Murnin, Brewster, Cape, and Cuthbert, and is insured for £6000 in the following offices :— New South Wales, £1200 ; Metcalfe's, £2400 ; the General, £1200 ; and the United, £1200. The cargo, which we give below, is also insured in various offices to the amount of £3000 : — 10 quarter- casks wine, C.

N, Co,, have in the course of construction an iron gun-boat for the New Zealand Government, and intended for service on the inland waters, She is 140 feet in length, 20 feet beam, 8 feet 6 inches depth of hold, and will draw only 2 feet 6 inches of water; she is built of g-iron, which will render her bullet proof, and is fitted with four water-tight compartments. The propelling power consists of an overhanging stern wheel, with feathering floats, driven by two engines of thirty horse-power each, supplied with steam from two boilers placed fifty- four feet for- ward of the engines, for the purpose of keeping the vessel of an even keel. On deck are placed two cupolas, each. of seven feet diameter, the sides being pierced for rifles ; the cupolas are placed one forward and the other aft, the communication being from below. In the construction of this steamer it was Important to protect her against being boarded in the event or her getting aground, and for this purpose a 3-inch iron pipe is carried fore and aft flush with the gunwale, and connected with one of the boilers. The pipe is pierced with a series of holes, so that a continuous jet of hot water is thrown from her gunwale should an enemy come alongside. She will be ready for launching in about ten days, and will, when ready for sea, have occupied about four months in the construction. It is intended to rig her as a three- masted schooner, for the purpose of proceeding to Auckland, where her stern- wheel will be fitted. When ready for active service, she will afford accommodation for 300 men. The Clarence Packet left Anictam on the 17th Juno, and reports the Curlew lyiDg there, with fifty-eight tuns sperai oil on board.

Tub Riven Etraheub.— Tho Wentworth correspondent of the 1'cslernl Times (June 17) writes :-Tuc Murray has been rising rapidly during the last week. Tbe Darling lias fallen several feet at Mount Murcsison, but still there Is plenty or water to admit a steamer up the river. The Albury has gone up the river with four barges in tow and a very large cargo, upwards of 000 tons, pilncipally for the Hurrumbtdgce, but as that stream was low, we believe Captain Johnston San taken the boat up the Murray to £chuca, and will proceed to the Murrumhldgce when tho river rises. The Btcamere Bunyip and Lady Augusta arc also up the river, and the Moolgcwanke Is dally expected. There are over COO bales of wool now lying here, brought down principally by tho Gundagai and Lady Daly for Echuca, which boats are do«n tho rivers, and will take up the wool in their way. I hear there is a Sock of sheep on their way down, from Mount Mnrcbi Bon, tbe Darling being so high they were compelled to coiue down the ana-branches, and arc bound for the Melbourne market. , NEWCASTLE.

She was making so much water and had encounter^ such bad weather that Captain Wybrow put into teosc islands for shelter, and intends to cell on that station duriflg the remainder of the ecason. He had 45 barrels of oil on board. On the 19th June, Captab Sennet parted company with the barque Oflly, of Hobart Town, Hobinson niaftcr, six weeks out, and all well On that date also he boarded the Victoria, of Hobart Town, Onnstalk master, about 50 miles to the E.S.E. of Cito's Bank. She was sis weeks out. and was *? clean.' The Victoria had spoken the Eury, and Carnarvon, both clean, and the Amhcrst, Lee master, with 45 barrels oil.— MM. Wekck of the echoonep. Peince of DENMAnK.*-From the information we were able to gather yesterday respecting the wreck of this vessel, it appears that 6he left Sydney about the beginninE; of Februarv last, for one of the ielandB of the Chester field Group, on which is situated a whaling station. She was loaded with stores for this station, where she arrived about the SOth February. Ehe had landed successfully nearly the whole of her cargo when, on the 19th March, during a heavy gale, she parted her cables and went ashore. In about halt' an hour scarcely a vestige of the vessel was to be seen. The whole or the crew with great difficulty succeeded in earing their lives by cither swimming or floatiiigonthe debris of the wreck to the shore On the second day after the wreck tbe weather became calm, and some of the island blacks, by diving, succeeded in bringing up from the wreck sundry Email articles, among which Trrrc several of tbc carpenter's tools and spy-glass, end one or two chests belonging to the seamen. Ab early as passible after the wreck, the crew commenced the building of the little vessel which has brought ten of the crew safely from Bramplon Shoal, to Brisbane, a distance of about COO miles ; this voyage was com pleted in eight days. The vessel, which was somewhat appro priately and good humouredly named by the crew Hamlet's Ghost, is built partly from portions of the wreck which were woEhed on shore, and partly from some boat planking which was brought from Sydney for the use of thestalion. Sheis built after the American style, and taking into consideration the difficulties under which she waB constructed, [he is a very creditable piece of work. She is cutter rigged, and we understand from the crew that she behaves well in a seaway, her speed ii not despicable as may be ascertained by tic quick run she ruade to this port. Eleven ol the natives who were part of the crew of tbc Echooucr Prince of Denmark were left on the island with about eighteen months* provisions. During the voyage of tbe Hamlet's Ghost to Brisbane, she expf- rienccd tine wcu'lher until ncaiinir this coast, when she encountered strong southerly winds for the last two days . The crew had plenty of provisions during the whale of the passage. The following vessels were spoken : The Eliza, brig (whaler), Captain Cornstalk, from Ilobart Town, six weeks out and clean ; the American barque Eliza, from New Bedford, thirty months out, with 1000 barrels of oil. This vessel supplied them with water aud a quantity of provisions. The Offlcy, a whaler, Captain Robinson, from Ilobart Town, two months out, and clean ; and the Donny Doun, Captain Wybrow, with forty barrels of oil, and in a leaky conditioH. We understand that the schooner Prince of Denmark was the property of Captain Bennet, and that Ehe was built of British oak as far hack as the year IM-QvuW Guardian, 1st instant.

Heavy Gale at Auckland.— (From the Ar«t- Zealander, Jute 23rd,) — A gale of great severity, but wbicb gave timely and un mistaKcable notice of its approach, visited tbis city through out the whole of Saturday night and Sunday last. To* wardB 6aturday afternoon the wind began to breeze up from the nortb-eaetwurd, and the barometer steadily to fall. Between eleven o'clock and midnight it blew hard, increasing to a tempest as the morning advanced, accompanied with hau-icanc squalls of rain. As day broke, the wind still increased with the rising tide, a high nnd broken sea running, and the numerous fleet of coasting craft, which had taken the precaution to haul from alongside tbe wharf, ridmg uneasily and heavily at their anchors. In the coureo of Saturday afternoon Captain Eltis, harbour- muster, took occa sion to warn tbe masters of Bmall craft, and to urge tbc necessity of hnuliag from off the weather side of the wharf, Atthciimoofhigh water on Sunday the sea was very wild, making clean breaches over parts of the wharf, and grinding such, small craft as still lay alongside in the most destructive manner. As tho tide ebbed and the inuhorc vcEtsls took the ground, they struck hard, but in most cases without sustaining material iujury. The barque Brcadalhane, from Newcastle, the schooners Sea Breeze, Bt. KildD, and Wildfire, all came into port during the height of the storm, snd anchored in safety. There was a short and very partial lull in the course of Sunday afternoon ; but, towards dusk, as tho flood tide made, it blew, if possible, with greater violence thau ever. We have experienced no Bucb tempestuous weather for a length of time. Tnc direction of tbc gale was steady from the caet-uonh-easU From Saturday afternoon until Sunday at mid night the barometer declined five-tenths, remaining stationary at 29 fti, from which point it bus unco been gradually on the rise, standing at 2907 yesterday at dusk. Considering the fury of the gale, there has been comparatively little damage done. Collision between toe sb. aiiledalk and tub Barque JorerlilNK. — On inquiry into the particulars of the recent collision between the Airedale and Josephine we have obtained the follow ing information. Tbc Airedale it appears, at the time tho collision took place, was approaching the wburf, with her speed moderate, aiidherllghui lit, and placed In accordance with tbo Harbour Regulations ; no light being visible to indicate the where abouts ol tho Josephine. Immediately the vessels oame into collision, Captain Kennedy hailed tbc barque to know where tholr light was, and was answered tbat It wbb at the fore-top-maBt hold, which, according to tbc old regulations, was correct, although, from the position in which the josephlno was lying, being stern on to the Airedale, which vessel would of course be approach ing stem on, the light^becanie for tho time hidden. Accord ing to our port reirulutioDB, It appears that tho light is to be suspended at tbo peak. The bowsprit of the Airedale entered one of tho after cabin windows, tearing away everything in ita pro greeB, and eventually ripping up tho deck and toeing Its yny through. Captains Csrlton and Armstrong held a survey, and ' cttitmtad -lio damage sustained by tho Jowphine to bo some where about £180. Captain Kennedy wished to settle the matter by arbitration, which, however, Captain Jacobs refused to do, and at preunt nutters remain in itata ?uo. It is regretted that tbe Harbour Muter had not been a little more careful tho first or second sight tbe ship was anchored off, and cautioned her com mander about his light, or fined him in tho event of its not bclug placed in its proper position, and thereby have prevented tho accident, which need not, nor would not have happened in our watcre, Captain Kennedy's knows carefulness being proverbial.— Wellington Independent, June 9.

The principal fatigue in fitting comes from your sliding ibrvveid. and thus straining the iigament s*m the small of the hack. Tee expedient advised will obviate this t' ii&tcv;, 'id add greatly to the comtort and health fulmss of the sitting posture. The front edge of a chair 6b«uld not be more than fifteen, inches high for tbe average man. The average chair is now seventeen inches high for all, which no amount of slanting in the teat ««n make comfortable. — Lewis's Gymnasium. Fast Men.— The vicious die caily; they fall like shedows, or tumble like wrecks and ruins into the grave — often while quite young ; almost always before forty, The wicked ' liveth not half his days.' The woild at once ratifies the truth, and assigns the reason by describing the dissolute as ' fast men ;' that is, tl'iey live fast ; they spend their twelve hours in six, getting through the whole before the meridian, and iiioppiug out of eight into darkness while others are in tlic glow and glory of life. ' Their sun goes down while it is yet day.' And they might have helped it. Many a one dieB long btfore he need. Your men of genius, like Burns and Byron, to whom, when, dis sipated and profligate, thirty-seven is so fatnl ; and your obscure and nameless ' wandering stars,' who waste their youth inlibenime indulgence, they cannot live long, they must die early. They put on the stenm till they blow up the boiler. They run at such a rate that the fire goes (out for want of fuel. The machinery is destroyed by teckle6B speed aud rapid wear. Nothing can cave them. Their physical sytem cannot stand the strain they put it to : while the state of their minds is often such that the soul would rot the substance of the most robust body, and make for itself a way of escape from the incessant hell of its oira thoughts.— J?m. 1'. liimuy.
