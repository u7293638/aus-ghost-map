o. Broughton's Hospitality. By C.H.C. COPYRIGHT. II. It "was wearisome work struggling on across hill and valley. Now and then be stopped to pick tke deceptively tempting wild cherries. He killed a couple of dull squat mountain snakes, that seemed too sleepy to get out of his way, and sometimes he wus tempted to shoot pigeons and lyre birds In easy range, but refrained, lest bis cartridges might later on be' needed. At noon be found ley cold water for bis flask in a fern glade,, bordered" with musk and hazel, In the dip of two long spurs, and rested awhile to cat the sandwiches in bis pack. He had no Idea- wliut . distance he bad travelled, nor where' bo might be, for be could seldom get any extended view through the forest, but he was aware that ou; tlie .whole, be bud been gradually ascending,' anil as his pace, though slow, had been steady, be knew that be niust have walked many miles: . ; i ( By-nnd-b.vo bo caught occasional glimpses : of a rugged hare mountain'.'sumniit towering above' the other ranges;, and about 4 qlelock, with ,a disappointed, 'j.'tuixiousy feollngi-' that. \- 'cither, the directions were nilslradlng. or he <; had- nilssod his .wny. h'e/foundiliimsolf.ouce ' mo'ro ' In ; a ! creek" bottom,! with (a , .steep hill hoyoiul.

"You are fond of reading, X see," ho said, glancing towards Wnrne. "So am I, That Is why X love tlio bush — far from the fools who will not allow a man to pursue undjs- turbed bis studies, or his other fancies, what ever thcy_ may. be— y" understand, whatever they may be. Here I am a law unto myself.' Evidently greatly amused nt bis own con- celts, be laughed again, without waiting for a reply. "Whisky or brandy?" "Whisky, please." Broughton banded tlie decanter to Wnrne, and half opened a door leading oft the dining- room. "Alice, my love!" he called. "Will you come In here. I want to Introduce a visitor I have brought you."- "A visitor! Who ?" "Husli, my dear! lie Is In tills room," in terrupted Broughton, chocking bis wife's be wildered inquiry, and turning sharply In time to see Wnrne put down his glass with a clatter and fix bis eyes on the door. "Is anything the matter?" be nsked. "You don't care about the whisky?" Wnrne fneod Broughton's stnre, nnd no ticed again the peculiar smile. which be was beginning to detect.

Uad she lived here ever since, lie wondered, for It was clear Unit Broughton and hls( wife must have been married several years? ( ite; could form no settled plan of action. -1 His" thoughts would project themselves to 'n'o- more distant future than half an hour hence, when he should sco again as another man's wife the woman he loved — touch her liand, possibly hear from "her lips why she lmd broken faith with him and. left him to gra-; dually lottru that hearts do not break. t Ho still clung to the hope that slie liad been deceived. Unless she bad lied with cruel skill, there was real belief in the ptis- slonnte accusations of some unnamed conduct on bis part which must prevcut them from ever meeting again. He remembered every word of tho letter that be had read with dazed eyes ou the last morning of tlielr voj-age, when lie went to seek her on the deck as the steamer crawled up the Thames, aud found that she had left the boat at Tilbury an hour before to dis appear from his life until to-day. One letter of tierce remonstrance and protestation hail' como back unopened. It and her own ho kept still locked away In a desk, but all else connected with her be bad striven to blot from bis memory. Did she know at last how she had wronged him? Would she speak of it, and could be ever forgive her for doing Mic utmost pos sible to blast bis life? He pondered these questions dreanilly, aud was aroused from bis reverie by a knock nt the door. It was Only the servant bringing him hot water, but Warne stared at her with a fascinated stnre, only recalled to bimsclf by an ungry little laugh, when be apologised for Uls rudeness, aud took the jug from her baud. She wus a young, full limbed creature, with splendid eyes and teelli, nnd jet black ltalr— a Sainonu half- caste, be guessed, with all the sensuous beauty of the islanders— but It was' not her appearance that bad bold blm onclialneil, save In so far as he saw In her face every characteristic of the hoy's features that was not as patent!' derived from the father. He : was excited— Indignant on the wife's behalf — and yet, though he despised himself for It,- conscious of an immense sense of relief. Did she know? It was Impossible tliat she should not, and he swore llercely. to lifms'clf that Broughton should pay for this Insult, then- shrugged his shoulders, stalling at his vehemence, as he realised how powerless he was, ignorant even whether Mrs, Broughton would speak to him, let aloncr accept' him as a champion of her wrongs. .. .( ( , 7 The one thing clear was that fie must keep a watch on Broughton, ..anil perfect . control of -blmself, endeavoring lt( possible to olitiUii an Interview with (Mrs. .Broughton alone,' an endeavor which . fie , feli.V.t,(,lwi:('.'fiiwlSintf would do. lite best to defeat.'.
