"Well, 'I will rel .ate' a' peculiar ' affair that h.appened on T.allmans Gully, in 18.59." S We were .all attentiohi .and listened td the very remark - (- able narrative he related in the following manner : J . " You must know," commenced my uncle, that l and \ four m.ates were living in .a tent on the banks of the f river — living, I said, I should li.ave called it existing, for ) we were most unfortun.atc, only finding sufficient gold to \ keep us in the commonest tucker. After our everyday's ( work, you may be sure we were tired enough ; but we were ) every night disturbed in our rest by the clink, clink, clink \ of .a pick, about fifty yards from our canvas home. This ( confounded noise always commenced at midnight, and did ) not cease until the break of day. ..One night we were C determined to see who it w.as ; so we sallied forth in the f bright moonlight, and saw a figure in a co.arse red flannel ) shirt, high boots; and slouched ;;h,at, hard at work by an C old claim which had been deserted for many years. I w.as f chosen spokesman, to expostulate with this noisy digger; \ but when I was within twenty yards of him, I stood still, C transfixed with horror, — for the wearer of the digger's f clothes was no living man, hut a, sJteleton f " Uncle Ned 1" we all cried, 9 how fearful." C ' " One night, our tent was vi.sited by a handsome, well- tp-do looking man, of about 'fifty years of age, who f enquired for a digger of whom \ve knew nothing about. I He told iis that in '51 he andA.matepf his deserted from ? one of Her Majesty's ships, and st.artcd for the Tallmans \ gold fields. They worked witlTpretty good luck for a few rhonths, when the new comer went down .to Melbourne / see about some letters. (. Before he went, he said to his \ mate, -'Bob, -whatever yon do, never stop working the I claim for a day until -I come back.' Bob proinised, and they parted." 'I went down to Melbourne,' said the ex- \ digger, 'anil tlierc' was arrested as a deserter, and sent on , b.oard and how that I hare obtained my disch.arge, I f have hastened up here to find my old chum.' ' You will \ sde hinr tprnight,' I said; 'but you'll find him very much changed.',.. At midnight, the everlasting clink of the ) phantom's pick was he.ard, and we all turned out. ' Ah ! ' J cried the sailor, ' there's -.dear old Bob. Bob, here I .am tack. " Bob, speak to me.' He ran to the figure, which > turned its hideous face on him. With a loud shriek the seeker k fell senseless on the ground. " The ghost 'threw down its pick, and, vanished.
