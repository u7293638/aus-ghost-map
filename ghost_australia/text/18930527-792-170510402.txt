DIOCESE OF SANDHUBST. (From our own Correspondent.) AT the early Mass on last Sunday the coadjutor-Bishop of Sandhurst addressed the congregation at some length on the festival of the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles, Whit Sunday. His lordship said that the present need of the guidance of the Holy Spirit was great, and we should invoke His aid in all our undertakings. We should likewise have recourse to the Virgin Mother of Good Counsel, who was most powerful befor,e the throne of God. At 11 o'clock, Fr. Carroll sang High Mass, Coram Fpitcopo, a^d in the presence also of a crowded congregation. The monthly meeting of the Pious Union of Oar Lady of Good Counsel was ™ at r£ ended on Sundav afternoon at T Th e Very Bev. Nicholas Crane, VERED F u T P ra ctical discourse on the Christian education of children, and warned his hearers against that worldly spirit which some weak-minded al P"ents l °w to take root in their children. Benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament brought the exercises to a close. ..The Christian Doctrine Society's library offers great advantages for the circulation of sound Catholic literature, and should receive a more generous support thanitatpresentenjoys.
