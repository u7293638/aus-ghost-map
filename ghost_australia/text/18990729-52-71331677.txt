CLASS B. "Glenmore-road, Paddington. .Dear. Queen Ybu'ngheart,-How strange that Â«o few city boys and girls,write to you! They could teW you just as good stories as the country boys and girls. I am a city boy, and shall tell you of my trip to Queensland. Some time ago I was on the Darling Downs, about 20 miles from Too- woomba., It was just grand to see the great paddocks of corn and watch the men mowing the wheat. It was fine fun learning to ride. My friends gave me a horse called Gipsy, and in a little while I could gallop all over the plains. She was a dear old thing, her color jet black, and she looked for all the. world like the model in the Art- Gallery, i I cried at leaving her, although Watson said he would be kind to her for my sake. "I knew nothing of country life before, but I liked it far better than Sydney. They had a hovse called Billy on the farm. He was very wicked, and iised'to bite and kick. One day I was cross- ing a paddock where he was hobbled, and I went , over to pat; him on the neck. ? He rushed at me with /wide-open mouth, and his two hobbled feet in the air. I thought Twas done for, so I turn ed: and, .made for/the house as fast as my legs would carry me. When I got home aunt sa'd I was as white as a ghost, and wanted to know what happened me. ; I told her my story, and next . day I saw that Billy was put into a pad- dock that I did not cross so often. There was a milk factory ; a little way from our house ; we used-to take our milk to lt, and I must tell you all about that when next I write to-you. If I win your prize, I shall also-tell you about Plain View School, the master, and his scholars, and something about the Haystack Mountain, and how , the master's dog Bob brought the cow home from there. Good-bye.. I remain, dear Queen Youngheart, yours truly, WV J. B. (aged ll years). (Queen Youngheart, shaking her head: "I am afraid ii' a schoolboy were encouraged to write his opinion of his master, this paper would be soon sued for libel.")
