THE LADIES' OOL.UMN The Old Path. The same old path! Long years have flown Stine last I trod itse way; I scarcely thought-such change I've known To find its marks to day. But still its lovely course I trace, Unchanged, by fence and rill, Through meadow, wood, and briery place, And o'er the verdant hill. And in the valley, far ahead, The evening shadows hbold The house to which my footateps led In twilight hours of old. Who treads the path ?-who dwells there now? I neither know nor care; I only know no tender brow And voice await me there. And that to walk that quiet trail Would give me such deep pain As all my soul could not avail To drie from me again. Alas! I know not where thoen art, What time has done with thee 'Tis but the ghost of my younr heart WhIch bahunnta this place and me. Buot I would give my" lfo's beat pride, Could this old path once more But lead me, dearest, to thy side, Audto the love of yore t Joam B. Jsgrsrr. The illustrations show two pretty dresses for girls.
