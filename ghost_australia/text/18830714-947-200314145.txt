'.h; The ^ debate' on the Ireply 'to the' address 1. made this ..fact: abundantly -plain. :.?;, Wh'eniDr.v Rose, .with an' ,.amount;;of (fluency arid aelf-sufficienoy, somewhat rare, in: ''the. youngest member of theHo'use,'' :'as'he styled' hitnself; and Mr. : f Charles Smith, with a modesty, and a brevity -equally, rare,; 'had- respectively^;:: movedi. ? and.' seconded the usual reply to the address, . there certainly was an, opportunity afforded' for the; exhibition of; a little -. self- control on the. part of honourable members.- But the temptation was -too, strong, and: Mr. M'Intyre, the hon. member for Maiden, who has to alls' intents:, and purposes 'jumped' the position and ;asaumed the leadership, of' the Opposition, could not: resist it. , So he talked, on, in. his amusing fashion for ' nearly an hour by Shrews-: bury clo.ck,' ,and;half a dozen '.members following .his example, .the debate, which should . have closed at half-past' six, , did. hot /terminate until.past eleven...,, On the. next evening the game was continued, and : ?a?ittle^ 'stonewalling' was indulgedj.in by- , ,Mr. .Shield, : who ,; talked .against; time for upwards of two mortal. hours. His object was. .to. postpone,, the -division on the motion proposed.. by ,Mr. ;Mirams: condemning the action) of the trustees ' in . opening the. Museum and Picture Gallery on Sundays. But his ^tactics ,-;were.-*-iin- . availing, for by an ,overwhelmine; ,:ma-. jority .the members of the.,, Assembly, whom one of their, number, in the course of his.apeech, described as the, .'goody goody lot,' affirmed . the proposition of the representative, of Collingwood. , What a'ction the. trustees will take ,in . conse q'uence of the. vote;iB.pow matter for con jecture. Some people epine , they ' will a'tonceibpw to the; expressed -will, of the people's representatives ; ,; others; again affirm that they will take no notice of the debate but — to quote an expression of Sir Charles Gavan Duffy's — ' look over the heads of Parliament to tho people be yond.' Singularly enough, this is a matter upon which the electors and the elected are not united. Were the man hood of the colony polled on the question there is small doubt that an emphatic vote would be given in favour of giving to the people the opportunity of inspect ing their naturar;workB of art on the day on which they can. most conveniently avail themselves of the privilege. But the Wesleyan and Presbyterian bodies are a power at election times. They give a 'solid' vote at the ballot box, and bo can bring pressure to bear. And they are, moreover, gifted with ah amount of perti nacity which, when once (hey , make up their minds, to take any course, causes them to puraue, it to the bitter, end. , The last has riot! been heard of this Sunday question. At present, it is , the little cloud no bigger than a man's hand, that may develope . into a ^torm that may, perchance wreck the prestige of the Government; ,' .'?' ,.' ,,,' ? .. ... ??,:. ! ?
