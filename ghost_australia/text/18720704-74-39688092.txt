SUNDAY DISTURBANCES. To the Editor of the Examiner. Smi,-Allow mo through the medium of your paper to call the attention of the Christian pthb lic to little scenes enacted in York-street in an open square, noises and sounds thoere to be heard outrivalling any heathen ones. While. some benevolent and zealous man (whoso zeal seeooms mistaken), tries in vain to now the good seed of eternal hif. We talk of foreign mis sions. There are many needed in our own streets, if our friends of truth would walk our streets on Sunday afternoons. But a word to the wise is suflicient. We are tempted to ask whoro are our constables, for not a " ghost'of oho" over shadows the Sunday promenades. Trusting you will favor myoself and those con corned,-by giving this publicity.-I am, yours obliged, Launceston, July 1872. Hu .zrrr.
