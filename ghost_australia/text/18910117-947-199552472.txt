Events were hurrying . rapidly in; this month of November, 1851; .and... with Orleanist politics in a sorry plight, Dr. Jaquet held himself, in readiness for a flight upon short notice, though he did not abandon all; hope' that the machina tions of the Prince President might yet be defeated. ' Hope springs eternal ' in the breast of a political intriguer, as iri; the breasts of :other- men. ; But the con aolidation of Louib Napoleon's influence, and ithe rapidly diminishing chances of an O'rleaniat's return, constituted one cause fpr'Dr. Jaquet's unrest. ? - : . -?.';? But he had another secret cause for dissatisfaction. -It had nbeen his fate to contract a loveless marriago.-' The match had been arranged six years,. before, after the ; most approved French fashion. Mademoiselle Clare Benoit, the daughter of an avocat at Lille, ; was considered the? most eligible parti in tho circle in which the Jaquets moved. The Jacquets had. little money, but much 'pi ido of birth. Felix inherited the beauty of the family, and more than a share of 'its talents. :. M.:r Benoit was of yesterday, butvriimour at- : tributed to him the' pi ssessibn of co'n siderable wealth. There ;was the usual i discussion between the.. - elders i of the' ? i respective families, and sfterM.
