Saturday, November 9, 1878 The surprise created in the Minis- terial caucus by the revelation that we are living under a Berry-Duffy Govern- ment, and have so lived for eighteen months past, will be shared by the country. Mr. Berry, no doubt, made tha statement with reluctance. His dilemma was that to make the confes- sion damages himself, and still more his associate, and yet if he did not make it and did not state his obligations to the Speaker, the party would never consent to the proposed appointment. Thus the acknowledgment was wrung from him. There has been a constant suspicion that the restless, lntuguing occupmt of the Speakei s chau was playing some pail in the stonny scenes of the hsl eighteen mouths, but the extent to which he has been implicated in those traimc lions was certainly nevei imagined The lion gentleman took the Speakoiohip, and in accepting it he made a stiong piofession of "unshakable niipai " tiahty -and the obsenance of an unshakable impaitiality is undoubtedly, as he declaied, the hist duty attaching to the office But these piofessions were a mask Sn Chyrlls Gav vn Dun-y was playing his own game lie recog nised that the Chief Secietary would ha\ e a still bcttei gift than the Speaker ship to bestow m Apiil, 1879, and he acted accoi dingly Outside the House the Speakei can cvcit a gi eat in fiuence as a non party officer îepiesent nig thewhole Chambei,and Sn Chyrlls G y v. yn Dun v.'. connexion with public men in England, and with the EnglLsh piess, gave lum special oppoitunities, if he so desned, of making that influence felt Ihe lion gentleman sold his ni iluence Mi Bucky sold the agent genei llship Thus what the Peaiaon Fai i eil job is on a small scale, the Dufly appointment is on a large In both instances, a bargain is stiuck which in its essence is coirupt, and it is an extraoidmary thing that the two commissioners who arc to accompany Mi Bebí y should go home w ith the same taint attaching to them Sir Cn veles Gavan Duhv. is cun nmg of fence, he is skilled m the ait of " making the worso appear the bottei "îeason," but every man of a frank and honest turn of mind will see that it is unseemly that the Speakei of the House should foi eighteen months have been secretly an active partisan, working m the daik in all directions An instinctive feeling of fairplay will tell eveiy one that it is not right for the Speaker to piepaie resolutions, declaiations, and manifestoes, to be fatheicd by the Chief Secietary, and passed ovei the heads of a dissenting minority \et this was the case, it seems, all last session The cases and îeasons which Mi Sermcl used to descube as "sacks of chaff," originated w ith the Speakei The voice that lead them was the \oice of Blrry, but the biains that framed thein wcie the bnins of Durry But even lins conduct is tin own into the shade by (he discoveiy that the Speakei's func lions have included the delicate but important task of " keeping the "Governor stiaiglit," under which elegant euphuism is cloaked the fact that Sir Charles G wan Dun y has used all his aits and has piosti tuted his position to induce the Governor to coopeiate with the Beiry Government It is only natural that Mr Berry should have laid the greatest stress upon this paiti cular service, because it involves the greatest of the breaches of trust and the most serious of the constitutional im proprieties of which the Speaker as Speaker has been guilty The Speaker, as Lenthall declared, has no eyes to see and no tongue to speak except as the Commons direct him " I am only " the mouthpiece of the House," said Sir C G Duffy himself on Thursday -the last sitting of the Assembly And this being the case, it 'nay be asked, when did tho Legislative Assembly o\er direct its oflicor to "koop tho *' Goi- ernok straight " Tho Assembly left the GovtRNOK in the hands of lui Ministers, and now wo ire told tlut Mimstcis could havo done little of thom seh cs, and that to the »Sooakor attaches tho credit of reducing His Exa llenlv to tho position of a Libeial tool The GovUiNOit could havo resisted Mi Birr*., but the wiles of tho Speaker of the chief officer of the Home-wera too much foi him Aftei tho serious business of " keep " nig tho Go\ i rnou straight tin; alleged work and 1 iboui done in con ncxion with the English press presents an amusing aspect It ls something of a joke to learn that it was nota ici! lion, not an independent critic, but om old fnend Bottom who was loaung in the cxtiaordmary articles which have appealed in the weekly and dailj papen in London llio mystery is now et plained It can be seen how it is th it the Duffy Land Act ls dngged into these elTu-sions on all occasions Wo can sc-iieely credit that tho Speakei was tht. actual penman of the ai tides in question because they are full of local errors, and very likely some half contiadiction of Mr Bhîrys announcement will appear, but the statements in the ai tides in ques tion about the membeis of the Couu eil being elected for life, and about the majority of their number being squatters, and about the coiLspiiacies to cicate large estates, are meie hteial îeid mgs of tho cunning and exaggerated language m which Sir Cn utLL-> G u \t. Dun y is wont on these subjects to indulge the lion gentleman has possibly m) stifled the Chief Secictaiy a little, but that theie is a substratum oftiuthinMr Bfrr\ s reniai ks is not to be doubted And not only did tlia Speakei mspno editorial articles, but we aie told he figuied as an anonymous coricspondent He has been Protean in Ins appeaianccs-now a Speaker, now a. journalist, now a coriespondent with gi cat men and now an anonymous letter writer and now a secret counselloi But still his labours m "keeping tlis "Gomrnor straight head the list of bis sei vices, because neither the

Molesworth in reference to the order com mitting him for two months for contempt in throwing a paper weight at Mr Anderson during the taxation of costs in the suit of Slack. v Atkinson. His Honour refused to hear him unless he surrendered, which Mr Slack immediately did, and by direc- tion of his Honour he was taken into custody by Mr Ellis, the deputy sheriff. After the business on the list had been dis posed of, Mr Slack wished to take some objec tion to the proceedings against him, but his Honour refused to entertain that question, as Mr Slack had had every opportunity of being heard and had said nothing. Mr Slack then asked to see the warrant against him, but there was no warrant in existence, and his Honour told him he could go, which Mr Slack immediately did. His Honour was very indignant at the delay in the preparation of the warrant, and said it was extraordinary that where Slack was con cerned everything seemed to be done to puzzle the Court. It was understood that the war rant had been prepared by counsel, during the morning, and had been sent to the Crown solicitor's office to be engrossed, but it had not been returned at the time that Slack was brought before the Court. What effect these proceedings will have in respect to the order against Slack seems doubtful.
