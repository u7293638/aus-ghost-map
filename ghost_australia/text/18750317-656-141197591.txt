' ' RIGHTS OF MEN. ''Who shall judge a man from manners Wlio shall know him by his dress? Papers may be fit for princes, Princes fit for something less ; Crumpled slurfc and dirty jacket May oft clothe the golden ore Of the deepest thoughts and feelings ; Satin vests could do no more. There are spirits of crystal nectar : Ever welling out of stone ; There are purple buds and golden, Hidden, crushed, and oyer grown. God, who counts by souls, not dress, Loves and prospers you and me, While He values thrones the highest But as pebbles of the sea. Man upraised above his fellows Oft forgets his fellows then ; ? Masters, rulers, lords, remember *^mt your meanest kind are men â€” Men by labour, men by feeling, Men by tli ought, and men by fame ; Claiming equal rights to ' sunshine, In a man's ennobling name. There are foam-embroidered oceans, There are little well-clad rills; There are feeble inch-high saplings, There are cedars 011 the hills. God, who counts by souls, not stations, ? Loves and prospers you and me, For to Him all vain distinctions ' Are as pebbles in the sea. Toiling hands alone are builders Of a nation's wealth or fame; Titled laziness is pensioned, , Fed and fattened on the same; By the sweat of others' foreheads, '.Living only to rejoice, [dom While the poor man's outraged free Vainly lifteth up his voice. Truth and j ustice are eternal, Born with loveliness and .light.: Secret wrong shall never prosper While there is a sunny right. God, whose world-li?ard voice is ringing ! Boundless love to you and me, Sinks oppression with the titles, As the pebbles of the sea ( A man who pretended to have seen a ghost was asked what the ghost said to him. 'How should I understand what he said,' lie replied, ' I am not skilled in any pf the dead lan guages.' ? ? ?
