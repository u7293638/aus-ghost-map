ROMAN CATHOLIC PASTORAL. i I -I,-. The following is the second Pastoral Letter, addressed to the clergy and laity of the Roman Catholic Church in the archdiocese of Sydney : " Roger Bede, by the grace of God and the favour of the Apostolic See, Archbishop of Sydney and Metropolitan, to the Clergy, Secular and Regular, and the Faithful of the said Archdiocese. " Health and benediction in" the Lord. " Reverend and dear brethren, and dear children in Jesus Christ, " Though the Catholic Church is by far the most formid- able opponent of the great apostasy, still she is not its solo opponent. Her foes themselves, if they possess any sound' heart of Christianity, are compelled, in self- preservation, to set themselves against it nor does it follow, from their being at one in this, that they are mutual fr ends : because two men, for their own private reasons, hate a third man, that does not even tend to prove that they love each other. Those who profess the Catholic faith and those who protest against that faith can for causes known to themselves, and these causes may be radically different, strike out against one and the same antagonist. Thus, the Catholic Church and the English nation, whilst conflicting with each other, are compelled, by force of principle, to resist the advances of the great apostasy. "The English nation, though it be not Catholic, is still in many' ways profoundly Christian For well-nigh 1000 years England lay steeped, as in a bath of supernatural light, in the strong Christianity of the Catholic Church, and the benign influence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, of that most touching period of England's history, still exerts a certain way over the people's conscience It took possession of ind moulded the national sentiment, and at the date of lung St Edward's death those laws, customs, and traditions which still give evidence of their influence had stamped an especial character on the national heart Die five centuries of Norman-English rule consolidated and deemed the work of the previous period, and the Catholic Church expanded in power as she did in organization, and become part and parcel, not only of the law, but of the blood and heart of England The venerable sees, her r nowned universities, her great monastic orders, her schools and munificent charities, her cargo prerogatives in the temporal older, her glorious past, written in a city in illuminated page, her saints and martyrs, her kings and queens, wearing the smells of sonctitt,and her absolute bold on the popular imagination how could England living for wellnigh 1000 years in such a thrill as this, help being permanently affected in her national character A Down to the 16th century we may fairly say that the Jindhid open living the life of the Catholic Church, as it his learned some of the most beautiful pines other history Since that date, robust the Church's authority bas be "'rejected, many of her broad fundament late things have remained "Looks the England of so duv;iiudsi} whether or no you do not perceive in some of the main outlines of her character deep indelible lol eng of past influences? What do we see a direct, a national Church, with the old cathedrals and old age, and the village churches, all pro- claiming their origin in every "tone of them, i hierarchy of archbishops and bishops, with the prayer book and the ritual breathing, if they been the an} breath at all, a breath redolent of ancient days, then there are the old universities of Oxford and Cambridge, seed plots of great men in every walk of life, and pregnant, in form and temper, with a spirit which took hundreds of years to bring to anything like perfection the surface of things is changed, but in the depths, sleeping, but not dead, the old spirit watches and protects the Christ city of England. There is much of the antique spirit in the high nobility - the honour, self-respect, truthfulness, honesty, and generosity of a chivalrous age The people are, as a body, charitable, earnest, religious, and unconquerable in their perseverance they love order and law, they are honourable in their commercial transactions, they are the most domestic people in the world, and possess many beautiful natural virtues- which are elevate and relayed through the nose traditionary pi principles which, as a salt, keep the nation sound at heart, and help to maintain it vigorously Christian Added to these virtues, there is their deep love and reverence for the Word of God By its means the idea of the supernatural is kept from day mg out, and the thought of the Almighty, His Providence, Christ's Atonement, Hismeicy love, and grace become a precious heritage amongst the people there the great moral virtues are found illustrated and enforced, and so deeply is the Bible treasured that it is looked upon by the masses as being as essential an element in the nation's greatness as the majesty of the throne itself to its stability " Thus, the Life _ people are profoundly impressed with the conviction that the nation's gre witness and prestige spring from this principles Christianity that its soundness of heart, its enterprise and its successes on a large scale, are due in the ultimate limits to the fact that the broad foundations of the Empire are set in the man of the Gospel, and the principles dictated by the Inspired "Word Almost as a consequence of this, the two leading traits of the national chat acted are honest and thorough- ness and what Lngh hmen pus. most for themselves and others is civil and religious lil east " Look at the condition of England at the present hour Unity ot I faith is tone Its price is tal pa by 150 different sect? The nation must accept this state of things is it according to the national spirit to invent a belli- me for fusing all these religions into one Such an idea is abhorrent from the national feeling It his nothing about it either of honesty 01 thoroughness it is more in c interest with a masked infidelity, and with a sort of trifling with Divine things, and with God himself, from which an earnest delicious mud so erroneously recoils Englishmen being thorough themselves the other to be there also They infinitely pi efer an outspoken, fear loos enemy to one who circles though they may detests man's creed 01 i replied, they still more dote t, they loathe cowardice in him who his net courage to express or to maintain what in his head he thinks to be the truth In! of the case of English Catholic in English society at home In thorough English Protestant Society the way to gain influence and respect is to be thorough also Cardinal Manning, having moved in both societies in Catholic and Protestant is able to give incontestable evidence upon this point He an Englishman, for half of his life an Anglican, thoroughly conversant with English ways and views, in his Miscellanies '* writes as follows ' English society, with all its vices, he says does after all represent the English character There is something downright manly and decided in it, and it respects the time, that is, its own, qualities in others as much us it despises and ridicules all servile or petty eagerness to court with favour Downright masculine and decided Catholics-more Norman than Rome, more ultramontane than the Pope himself may enter English society and be treated with goodwill and respect even v where, if only they will hold their own n with self respect and a delicate consideration of what is due to others. It is this a, boldness which inspires both respect and confidence It the pledge of sincerity, and sincerity is respected by every body worthy of the name of English- man No greater blunder could be committed than to try to propitiate Englishmen or English society by a tame, diluted, timid, or worldly Catholicism ' Now how does all this len upon Catholic education i It bears upon it in the directest manner For, it English- men loves nothing better than honesty and thoroughness, even in the holding of a creed which they think a grand mistake, they will be consistent, and will love honesty and thoroughness in education They will hold that, if there must be diversity of creed at all events there should be thoroughness and honesty in the holds g to that diversity I he nate man honesty and thoroughness with them is a potent element in national strength If a man be true to his bed, there is a chance of his being time to his country But he who would barter away his religion, or treat it lightly, would turn out a poor creature in the day of a nation's tend Honest, though he condemns Catholicity, an Englishman has no faith in a lukewarm Catholic, any more than he his in a timid soldier He says, in effect, ' Let the nation be bought up honest and thorough, and then we stand a chance of holding our own, and maintaining the press of the Empire Let the young, who will take our places when we ni<> tone, be drilled into this great idea Lot all of whatever creed, have equal chance in the race, and, whilst each is earnestly and thoroughly trained in his own religion, let all be equally assisted in the fitting of the mind for life's battle when it comes ' "What is the course quence of this master principle which energies so strongly in a nation's life It is this that even that creed which the nation has rejected for 300 years receives equal to its ent with the established of cod in the scheme of national education for the people England knows well that a bad

framed such a system as this and was it because they loved the Pope that the English people accepted it All who have any knowledge of the national spirit are well aware that had there not been some profound reason conn' acted with the national prosperity, the Catholic Church would have been ill-used in England, or a system would have been set on foot to weaken the blood m Catholic veins, and meet the rigour of Catholic life out of the people. The creeds would have had to send their children to schools without religion, or so arranged that no decent man, with self-respect, could teach a legion in them. The creed schools would be treated with disfavour by the Government or their officials the State schools would be is palaces through the land, with the best masters and appointments whilst those schools where the love and fear of God and the great directive principles of religion, were horn by hour insisted on would, on the principle of the deer of the weakest, dw ndle gradually a\va},usa nation would be reared up with less and less religion, and more and more of that pagan spirit which is, if history ever taught a person, the sure presage of moral effeminacy t_d national decay Tar seeing English statesmen, possessing the characteristic of the race, resisted this spirit of a national apostasy, and respecting as gentlemen do, the conscientious convictions of the humblest, gate fair p in to ill and conciliated the love and affection of England s Gath be subjects Thus the nation will continue to held her own in the broad contests of international life her nerve and sinew will be teach, her heart sound and the principles of her imperial sit ly will still be founded in the depth of a Cheshire spirit the, on broad, to wide-reaching principles of statesman ship maintains a system of education based on a principle that would satisfy the requirements of the Catholic Church in resisting Secularist Education ' we are in reality, resisting a principle of national overthrow it and by maintaining our rights as Catholics we are doing untold service to the State Here, interests are identical in Here, whilst we are holding, of struggling, for our own, we are laying lines of future prosperity We are the true friends of the people and of the country, for we found our own honour and great- ness on our conscientious convictions regarding morality and filth, and let us do all that in us lies to make known to others, who know them not these great principles of religious liberty; religious thoroughness, and religious honesty, on which imperial England's greatness mainly rests "Dearly beloved let us continue to press our claim to equality We cannot, in conscience, send our children to Public schools ' We are bound in duty to bring them up thorough Catholics, not thorough Protea ings, however exemplary Protestants maybe this is no cry started for a purpose The whole Cul hole world knows and all intelligent Protestants know, the Catholics who have any thoroughness in them cannot bring of themselves to jeopardize the future Catholicity of their children by sending them to Public schools The Anglican Bishop of Melbourne, Dr Moorhouse, a prelate of thorough English mind, recog- sizes the full force of the Church's teaching,; on this subject.
