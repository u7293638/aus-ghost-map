The subjects of a denominational publication, and of a Provident and Superannuation Fund, were then discussed, and adjourned to a future day In the evening, a public meeting was held and the following address was presented by the chairman - T "Many of you know with what feelings of reluctance I undertook the duties which I have now to fill those who have formerly on similar occasions addressed you have had the advantage of a long ministerial experience, and then swords have been wise and weighty "With me the case is very different, and I feel the difficulties of the position even more than when you called upon me to occupy it It is useless, however, to make apologies, and it will be better to proceed at once to the subjects with which I have to deal. In addressing v i n upon some of the changes of thought which are affecting the Church of Christ in our time, you will not suppose that I am assuming the place of original teacher, or claiming to seek with authority " I cannot help remembering one who, if he had been in the colony and to his life had been prolonged, would very likely have been chairman of our Union this year I mean the Rev J E Veitch He had much to do in forming this Union When he left the colony we missed his wise help and his kind and generous Christi m spirit We have lately heard that he has been called to his rest We remember his vigorous and well-cultivated mind his readiness to help in all that was good his noble unselfishness of heart, his humble earnestness in the work of the ministry He left many, very many, friends in this colony, who now mourn his death And I think you will all agree with me that this opportunity ought not to be passed by "without expressing our sense of his worth, and offering our sympathy to those who have to son or even more than we to do "The changes of thought which are affecting the Church of Christ we may consider under two heads. 1st The internal changes in the Church itself and we shall confine our attention to a few of these which are practically modifying the organization of the Church, and changing the attitude of different versions of it towards one another and, secondly, —The changes which affect modern thought in relation to the truth to which the Church has to bear witness. Of course anything like a complete review is out of the question, and will be neither expected on your part, nor attempted on mine. In dealing with the first part of the subject, I shall have to refer some matters in which concern us as Congregationalists. I do so, because to ignore our position and to pass by such topics would be cowardly But I hope not one word I may have to say will be con- strued as expressly of of bitterness of feeling against those who conscientiously differ from us, and whom we are bound to esteem as brethren Christ, just as fully us if they called themselves by our name Nor let it be thought that we are always harping upon Congregationalism For myself I can say that since I have been a minister, I have not spent five months of the time I have occupied in public teaching in preaching Congregationalism, or in showing its advantages as compared with other systems There are others who could say as much Perhaps we have been wrong in this but I mention it thus emph cruelly, because I feel that there are some who misjudge us in this matter, and who might be ready to suppose if any reference be made to our distinctive principles here, that this is the subject that is always uppermost in our minds. " One subject upon which there is a great change of thought and feeling among Christian people generally is the method of avowing religious belief. There is a growing feeling that the way which has been most common—that of subscription to articles of faith— is unsatisfactory. I think we have reason to be glad when we consider the progress that has been made in general opinion upon this subject. The minds and consciences of men are becoming awakened about it. Once men signed articles of faith without considering the solemn responsibility involved. It is a simple fact that many, solemnly before God and man, testified their belief in articles of faith which they had never so much as read, and still more frequently in articles which they could not be said to believe, because they had never considered them. There is still a fearful laxity in this respect. Men still pronounce the condemnation of all who do not believe what in their hearts they do not believe themselves. It is cheering, however, to observe that there is a change for the better, and there are many indications that such a state of things will not be allowed to continue. My convictions on this subject are strong, and I shall always claim the liberty of denouncing a system which, to my own knowledge, has tended to corrupt men's consciences, and which is seriously interfering with the power of that testimony which the Church should bear for Christ. Here, however, I should like to draw a distinction between denouncing a system and denouncing those whom we consider to have been misled by it. There are in my among them whom we admire and even reverence—many whose example in Christian earnestness and devotion we shall do well to follow It may seem easy sometimes to convict them of inconsistency Yet it seems to me hardly fair to throw the whole odium of a system which has been continued for generations upon any one man. The responsibility belongs more or less to every one who has in any way countenanced it—layman or clergyman Even if such method of bringing home to ears go to logically just, it seems scarcely generous It is like bringing the whole force of an army to crush a sentinel. I cannot but grievously lament the tone sometimes taken on this subject, for it seems to me hard and cruel We are apt to forget the difficulty which men have in dissociating themselves from a system which they have been taught to reverence. It is only at a heavy cost that they can save themselves from it—a heavy cost, not of prejudice only, but of strong spiritual sympathies. It seems hard that a man should shut himself out from what he feels to be his proper work in the world and sever himself from those with whom his sympathies lie just because he cannot with a perfectly clear conscience say, in regard to some matter which may seem to him and to others of minor consequence, I believe. Strict duty says that, no matter what the cost may be, he must bear it but the sacrifice is very hard to make, and it is quite possible in the conflict of mind which it involves (and there has often been a grievous conflict) the way of duty may not appear perfectly plain The system of subscription which involves all this we may, and must denounce; but we shall do well in not denouncing nor affecting contemptuously to pity (which is just as bad) those who suffer from its consequences The conviction is gain- ing ground that subscription to elaborate creeds affords no real security for unity of belief Such creeds are like the multiplied wards in old-fashioned locks, presenting to the uninitiated the appearance of great security, and seelming tp set at defiance any ingenuity that may be brought to bear upon them The burglar knows better, and opens the lock with the greatest ease with a piece of bent iron. Another principle which is making rapid progress is the liberation of the Church from the State. I do not look upon the the establishment of the Irish Episcopal Church as a very great triumph of this principle. A triumph it certainly was, but not so great as some imagine. I fear the measure was supported by many who did not care for the freedom of the Church, nor care for the principle, that money should never be forced by the State for religious purposes from those who are unwilling to give it. They supported it as a measure of expediency for the purpose of pacifying a disturbed country, and as a sort of reparation for the system of religious persecution which existed for a long time in Ireland. Whether upon their own ground they were right, or how for they were right, we do not stay to enquire As for the higher principle, it would have been better if the measure had been once or twice rejected. It would have given rise to a more thorough discussion of the subject, and men would have begun to consider what is right and what is wrong, not in one case of establishment only, but in all. The question, however, will come up again, and it seems pretty well agreed on every hand that when it does come to be settled, it can only to settled in one way Some high in dignity and authority suppose it will take ten years to settle the question some less, but assuredly it will be settled, and one great hindrance to the Church of Christ will be removed " Another question in which we are deeply interested is the form of Church government 1 believe of that progress is being made in this respect also, or, more strictly, that there is a return, however slow, towards what we consider Apostolic simplicity. It is not to those who have avowed Congregational principles that this change is chiefly due Except indirectly they have had but little influence It is the work of God's providence that has been unfolding the doctrine, for centuries forgotten, of Christian liberty The contrary principle —that of religious coercion—which, sad to say, has been the current doctrine of the Church during the greater part of its history, reached its culmina- tion in the times preceding the Reformation—in the supremacy of the Popedom—that parody of Christ's spiritual kingdom, which men had gravely enacted upon earth. The reformers, much as they did for mankind, held essentially the same doctrine, and embodied it in the forms of Church government which they established. We must remember that it was very difficult to make a beginning in religious toleration To tolerate, at that time, meant to tolerate men who would have taken the first opportunity of putting all who differed with them to the torture and to death. It was only gradually that the doctrine of toleration grew. Even so good a man as Baxter would not have suffered a Unitarian to live in England, and laughed Cromwell to scorn for using such a phrase as liberty of conscience. The elements of the lesson of liberty were not learnt till countless lives had been sacrificed and incalculable misery inflicted upon multitudes It was not among the more powerful, but among the smaller religious communities that the truth became known, and upon them it was deeply impressed by the stern discipline of persecution. It was in this school that the smaller communities—Independents, Baptists, Quakers, and the like—so thoroughly learnt the lesson which they have since taught to mankind. It is true that it proceeds naturally from the principles which they hold, but it was persecution that gave so much strength and earnestness to their convictions. Much as we deplore the divisions of the Church of Christ, we must remember that it has only been through these divisions that this truth, which men would not learn from Christ and his Apostles, has been impressed upon men's hearts The place which the smaller religious denominations have filled in the history of the Church may be compared to that filled in civil history by the petty republics in Europe in the middle ages. They kept alive the principle of liberty and counteracted the effects of great central despotisms. In this way, under tho Providence of God, they have been useful, and while we admit that their names are disfigured by many records of perversity and pride, we must remember that they have prepared the way for the only union of the Church of Christ which is possible or desirable— a unity which will be founded upon liberty and not upon constraint—a unity which will result from the inward working of one spirit, not from the outward control of one power—a unity which will be established, not in the peace of slavery, but in the peace of brotherhood. " 'The general acceptance in our own country of the truth that we have no right to coerce the consciences of others is quite recent—if indeed we can say that it is generally received even now. That a right of coercion exists, but that it may be expedient not to exercise it, has for a long time been held by many— for men are often forced away from error practically before they give it up in theory. There are many people who shrink from the coarse brutality of the Inquisition of the Star Chamber who would not scruple to use every means of social oppression to force others to agree with them. Some have only gone the length of seeing in toleration of high virtue in something like a counsel of perfection. A high virtue it is not, unless it be a high virtue not to pick a man's pocket or break into his house. But ever since toleration began, whether accepted as expedient or acknowledged as simple justice, it has had a most powerful, though very gradual, influence upon Church government. It could not but be so, since the generally accepted systems of Church government were founded upon the contrary principle— the right of using, force. Force to obtain money— force to make people go to church—force to punish them if they worshipped in any other way than that appointed. The change has been so gradual, however, that many have failed to observe it, but it is certainly taking place. Indeed the fact is acknowledged by many who are well qualified to observe it. Not long ago I read the express statement of one of the foremost clergy men in England—Dr Vaughan, of the Temple—that the Church of England is rapidly becoming Congregational. Though not in the same words the same sentiment is frequently expressed. Dr Vaughan's expression struck me the more when I read it because it was almost identical with one that was used by one of the ablest ministers in Scotland with regard to his own Church Indeed long ago the sagacious mind of Principal Hill saw clearly that it was in this direction that change might be anticipated, and it is plain that the successive secessions and disruptions in Scotland have tended practically towards the same result, while in England there is an increasing aversion to see law resorted to in Church matters, and a feeling that some change must be made "We do not claim this as a party triumph, nor do we suppose that all denominations are going to turn at once into Congregationalists. The change has affected many who scarcely know what Congregationalism is. What we do care for is this—that the right and duty of each man to worship God according to his own conscience be recognised, and that every congregation of faithful men shall be free from external coercion. Towards this state of things I believe that God's providence, rather than any human teach ing, is leading His Church. I am well aware that those principles must be held under considerable modifications Congregations may agree to select differences to some one whose Christian experience may guide them, or to some body of men whom they can trust But in the very making of such an arrangement the right of the congregation is recognised It is their voluntary act. It is not the act of a central power enforcing submission and compelling unifor mity, or appointing what is to be believed and taught. Such a system, as I have referred to, may be adopted by some, and may be harmless enough as long as those who adopt it do not shut out those who choose another way from the the name and the full privileges of Christian brotherhood. It is this rather than preference for one form of Church government over another which is the crying sin of the Church of Christ. We are all more or or less in danger of having Christianity driven out of out hearts by Churchism. We are in danger of being known as good Churchmen, stanch Presbyterians, earnest Wesleyans, zealous Congre gationalists, rather than good Christians "I know that there are some who will ask if the systems which now maintain a sort of unity among many lose their power—if creeds and confessions, which certainly secure a profession of unity of belief among many be abolished, where is the unity of the Church to be found? Does it not appear rather like a complete breaking up of the Church, and a destruction of everything like visible unity? In one sense it is so. There has been a disuniting process going on, and it is going on now But in this we see not so much cause of fear as of hope; for something like this has to be done before the Church of Christ can be free to show its true unity. If men stand united to each other by a false relation, it must be undone of the true relation between them is to be established. For example, a master and slave are united—they may have interests in common, and even some mutual affection, but if we wish to put them into a proper relation to each other, we must utterly destroy the false relation which exists that they may be able to stand in the true position of the men. I use this case not as an exact parallel to the present condition of the Church, but is an illustration of the general principle. Nor ought we to be surprised that the progress of Christ's kingdom should involve a great work of destruction. It was thus He came —His religion began in apparent schism—among one nation, that Jew and Gentile might be gathered together. He came bringing peace, yet bringing also a sword to plant and yet to look up —gathering in, yet bringing consuming fire. And still His work is going on. He is shaking the earth to establish the kingdom that cannot be moved—overturning till He come whose right it is It is vain to resist this work , it is the hopeless task of fighting against God. Man's wisest eley lees and noblest and most cherished institutions must give way, if they oppose this work They may appear strong and able to resist change We may be ready to say) See what manner of stones, and w hat buildings are here, but it is not the less certain not one stone shall be left upon another which shall not be thrown down The appearance of strength in human Systems it, often delusive Often they have seemed most firmly) established when nearest their end They stand like some old forest tree, massive and stable to outward appearance, but decayed within, not bending to the passing wind, and seemingly secure and immovable till the stronger blast comes that brings them down Yet we must remember that when God in the work of His Kingdom destroys, it is that he may build up Often he destroys much that to man may seem fair and good-much that man regards with affection and reverence, but he will put something better in its place, and we must learn to look with hope and trust upon what seems to be a work of desolation "When the Great Husbandman drives the ploughshare deep through holds that we in our own way have cultivated, and which seem to us to be pleasant enough as they are we must not look upon the black furrow without thinking of the harvest as it is to come " And in the matter of which we have been speaking there are many signs that the work which has been going on is not one of destruction merely While many systems devised by man show symptoms of decay), and became power lets for the ends for which they were at first contrived, there are many earnest and true he was seeking for a better way, longing for a true union in Christ's Chut cb I had intended to refer to man) earnest expressions of this desire by many high in position, and influence in the home country, and I add with pleasure in this colony, but where there are so many coming from so many quarters, we cannot refer to all we cannot believe that the wishes so earnestly expressed will remain without result, and we have every reason to believe that they will lead to deep views about Christ's kingdom, and deeper convictions i oncoming the relations which exist between Christ's followers-a subject to which more thought must be given than has been, and on which the consciences of Christian people must be awakened more thoroughly than they have been as yet. " How, then, are we to look for the accomplishment of the hopes cherished by so many * After so much failure, after so many well devised attempts have come to nothing, and after the means to which men have generally looked for securing unity have proved themselves a cask and ineffectual, where are we to look with hope i We answer, Such failures were norcMwr) God of ten leads us to the true way by shutting against me every other, and there is one way, and e only one left now, a way that has never been fully tried since the time of the Apostles It is indicated in one short sentence in the Apostles' Creed,-' I believe in the Holy Ghost ' "It is the unity of the Spirit that is desirable, and no either We believe o that there is one Spirit working in mon, I by whose working men who joined to Christ We believe that God is self consistent-that under different for at Ho yet works in no way and for one end, we see a good ground of hope for the Church, when the restraints that hedge men in from each other are broken down. For it is fact that men's Hjslcnislinvo separated them from each other, and hindered the natural result of the similar vi ark in men's hearts from a} pending It is a plain fact that in it the system of petty behind which Christians entrench themselves were abolished, there would be an immediate tendency to union on the part of many who are now separated Many who never think of each other without more or less of aver ion, and contempt would naturally and (spontaneously unite as brethren " Let it be distinctly understood that we do not look upon the Church of Christ merely) as involuntary considered) It in one, but it is something more. It is a society instituted by one Supreme will and subject to one Lord It has a central power, but that power is spiritual and un- seen We must call no man our ulster unearth Our Lord contrasts His kingdom with kingdoms of this world 'He policy which suits them, and is beneficial in their case for order and security is out of place and pernicious in Ilib Kingdom. 'It shall not be so among you' If we substitute any power on earth for that of the King immortal and invisible, wo bliuU infallibly lead men to a false conception of the Kingdom of Christ The) will think of His Kingdom as a mere outward institution-of entrance into (but Kingdom as a merely external change, rather than an entering upon a new relation to God. and to things spiritual and eternal In short, Church will be substituted for Christ "There are many practical difficulties to be overcome, no doubt, and there is much that concerns the unity of the Church which must be left to be determined by the only true test-that of spiritual S) mp ithy and the desire to cooperate for common ends " We trust in the power of a Divine principle in men's hearts to draw them together if they are only left free Practically I do not believe the difficulty would be so great as it appears if once the idea were thoroughly abandoned that man can control the faith of man 1 horse will draw together, and only those who are like minded If Christ's Church he earnest in glorifying Him and doing His work, it will gather into itself those who want to do the same if its aims are directly spiritual it will not be in much danger of having forced upon it those whose names are totally different he spiritual life of the Church, like all life, will have power to assimilate and power to reject and Ictus distinctly keep in view the fact that eternal unit) is desirable only when it expresses truly an eternal unity If a number of people gloss over their differences and agree to be called by one name, disliking each other all the time, this is not Christianity, but merely a falsehood It is pretending that something exists which does not "All such topics as we have held out about Christian unit) it may be said are very vague and unmeaning 11 some it may seem so-it may seem to see me to be simply giving freedom to men to unite for worship and for work and leaving the unity of the Church to chance I fear there are some who will be apt to think that every thing left to the vi work of the Holy Spirit is left to chance We long for the overthrow of restraints that are upon men now that the work of the Spirit may appeal Liberty is the condition in which the Divine boat works, and, if free scope is given, the units of the work will appear there will not be the unity of operation that man have desired, but there will be the unity of the St mt and the bond of peace "Meanwhile there are many lessons which have been taught us by the divisions of the Christ in Church that we shall do well to ponder Deplorable and scandalous as many of the divisions of the ChuMim Church have been, they have not been so employ able and scandalous as the evil which under God s Providence they have over- thrown While unity meant bondage it warm evil, and in to far as division has meant liberty, it his boon not an unmixed evil, but rather a blessing It may be truly affirmed that in some of the divisions of the Christian Church, there has been opportunity afforded for the growth of some forms of genius in life which would not have been tolerated as others, or which would have found in others a very uncongenial soil 'the earliest cnlhiiMiumi willah would have been ridiculed in one, has been allowed in others, and has produced incalculable good While in others the quiet earnest goodness which men of enthusiasm are apt to despatches found a home and leaf And so it has been with other differences of Ghi istian to sacrament It is a thousand pities that these different finals of th some life would not tolerate each other Lie h needed the other and the more closely they were joined the better would it have been for each 3 each has had to be taught that when it said to the other, ' I have no need of theo, it lied again t Gods truth and Gods Spirit the ex patience which has been teaching this lesson has been very bitter, but it has been salutary) the Church in its life has repeated the history of the fall of man It has ob- tained the knowledge of good and evil Not content to abide by the truth of Christ and His great commandment, it has, had to learn the excellence of we line is good by sad experience of the consequences of evil It has had to learn and to long for the blessedness of unity by feeling the evils of elissenbiou-to learn Chirit B law of

the car has to be educated to like discords It his to learn to wait in a sort of faith for their resolution, trusting that the master who uses them has his meaning and failing in anticipation of the

experience to widen our sympathies for different forms of good, we must also remember a danger to which each division of the Church is liable "W c have said that man) for any of life have found rest

of Separating what God meant to be joined Each body of Christians has been in danger from the want of certain elements of strength to be found in others, but not, at least to a sufficient extent, in

church or denomination rather than directly in the interest of Christ s kingdom 1 his danger is sometimes treated very lightly Most of us have heard much excellent declamation upon the subject, in which the idea of working for an) early object has been scouted Such a motive is supposed to be too mean to be entertained for a single me ment so that one might suppose that the danger of working for such an inferior aim is one of the last to which a mi want of Christ would be liable 1 distrust this view of the case I believe the temptation to be a real and a very common one, against which there is need of constant watchfulness and pi an or. Those will be most in danger of falling, into this temptation who do not see its reality The great danger is not of excluding the higher motive altogether, but of so adulterating it with the lower that it is hard for the man himself to distinguish one from the other I join heartily in all that is said to denounce such motives of action the new church politician is a poor case and at his best, and a very mischievous one at his worst Jealous) of others, and a desire for denominational aggrandisement, are very unworthy) motives, but the) arc motives very apt to enter the heart, especially when, as often happens, they disguise their by no nature, and hide their inherent hopefulness b) associ lung themselves with much that is good "If we look upon the present state of the Church one of transition, it may be asked how long is it to last ' It will last till the evil which caused it is brought to an end the evil of attempting to control i nth b) human power Beyond saying this, it is vain to attempt an answer Thought travels rapidly in our times more rapidly than ever it did Changes have been accomplished which a generation ago would have been looked upon as impossible 'They have been accomplished gradually, and the most important of them have been accomplished quietly It is in spiritual things as in natural, the quiet forces are the most powerful the force which day by day raises the water s of the ocean into the air that they may descend in fruitful showers, is greater than that of earthquake or volcano, and has more of real effect It should not surprise us that the same principle holds in spiritual things, for we have been taught that the Kingdom of Heaven cometh not with observation The greatness of the changes which have occurred, lead to a reasonable hope that still greater change is impending, but it is useless to speculate as to when it will be, or as to what will be its precise details , besides we must remember that the evils toboovercomoaio of long standing Meanwhile, present duty is plain We must be just as regards the excellencies of others for Christian justice Is the first step to brotherly love While we hold tenaciously) our own principles, they must be held in no sorrow or sectarian spirit Above all, we must avoid that boastful spirit which is so apt to corrupt the work of the Church of Christ, and Team in reality and not in words only, to give the glory to God For assuredly, when the change for which we hope does come, the excellency of the power ' will be seen to be of God.

Christ's time, as it is in ours There was a form of active opposition to Him besides, but it would have been of little avail had it not been for the guilty apathy of men to the truths which He taught by word and by life While we give special attention to the forms of opposition to Christianity which characterise our own age, let us not forget where the great practical work of the Church is to be done. "As to the form of active and direct opposition to Christianity , now most prevalent, there will be, I think, but little difference of opinion. It is what is generally denoted by the vague term Rationalism, and claims to be the natural and inevitable result of the spirit of scientific inquiry, which has been in modern times so active, and in its own field so wonderfully successful. The term Rationalism is vague; for it is sometimes applied to the method of criticism followed by many in Germany, and by some elsewhere, with regard to the Scriptures, sometimes the term is used with special reference to the principle which is the basis of the greater part of the Destructive Criticism —the denial of the supernatural—a principle to which, it is alleged, every man is led who has rightly apprehended the laws of nature, unfolded to us by the discoveries of science. For it is not denied, but, on the contrary, plainly avowed, that this is the principle which must be taken as a sure guide in matters of criticism, that miracle is an impossibility, and that every document which professes to record one must be, in so far, untrustworthy " It seems to be the case that every controversy has to pass through a dishonest stage before it reaches an honest one I do not refer of course to conscious dis- honesty , but to that stage in controversy in which the to a question involved is avoided, and a false issue substituted for it 'The real difficulty to which the progress of scientific inquiry and the growth of scientific conceptions have brought us is the difficulty of reconciling lived in truth law and will—or, to speak broadly, the difficulty of reconciling fixed law with spiritual existence in any form in man or beyond man. Men are beginning to see that this is the real question at stake, and I think it is a very hopeful sign that the controversy is beginning to be fought upon fair ground For the objection against miracle is ultimately an objection against will. " To those of us who believe that law is but the orderly unfolding of will—that what we call laws of nature are but the continued expressions of a will perfectly self-consistent, it must be cheering to see this question assuming its fine shape We see the principle even in the life of a man of high character and motives. His acts of will may be reduced to laws Given certain circumstances, we can foretell the course will pursue The law to which we reduce his actions is only one manner of conception of the perfect orderliness of the self-consistency of his nature We believe this to be as rational —to say the least—a way of reconciling law and will as that which believes any intervention of will in what is supposed to be the fixed series of events an impossibility. Either matter is controlled and conditioned by spirit, or what we call spirit is a product of matter. That spirit can control matter consciousness seems to teach us in our daily experience How matter could generate spirit is what no science has shown, and I think we can go the length of saying that it is absolutely inconceivable that science ever should. This question 'is virtue then a gas' goes a great deal further that many who consider themselves imbued with scientific concep- tions seem able to understand. That the material universe is subject to a spiritual, subordinate to it and controlled by it, is the doctrine of Revelation. We believe it to be a perfectly reasonable doctrine— one, against which true science alleges nothing—and I think we have rea son to rejoice if the progress of controversy leads men to consider this fact, and to ponder well whether it is reasonable or not; and if it be well considered, the supposed antecedent presumption against the occurrence of any thing supernatural will be removed. Of course, we do not say that this proves any one miracle, but it removes the objection which many suppose to be against the very concep- tion of a miracle, apart from any special evidence for or against it. "Yet it may still be asked, how is it that this feeling of the antecedent improbability of a miracle is so widely spread, and spread apparently at the same time with the progress of science ? Science has, undoubtedly, discovered much truth; and are we to suppose that truth is the road to error? The answer to this is to be found in the fact that in a nature out of moral balance (as man's undoubtedly is) truth and error, knowledge and prejudice seem to grow side by side We can see this principle with equal plainness, whether we consider the growth of intelligence in a child, or the progress of knowledge in the his- tory of the world. In the first case, we see that as intelligence advances false judgments grow up with its prejudices which education has to remove Every one knows this who has tried to teach child certain truths —as, for example, that the earth turns round; for there is a hasty and false generalisation about motion, the error of which has to be shown. And so, ever since science began, there has been a tendency to suppose that the knowledge obtained led further than it really did. When men obtained some knowledge of astronomy there were some who supposed that they had the key to all knowledge, and that sufficient observation would a event to them things in heaven and on earth, present and to come Once there were some who supposed, incredible as it may seem, that mathematics would be sufficient to solve all the vexed questions of medicine. When chemical knowledge advanced many thought that by chemical anearlsis all the problems of life would become clear When the first laws of electricity were discovered, some imagined that they were to unravel the mysteries of feeling and thought. Iach age has had its false science, founded on pride, as well as its true, founded on humility ; astro logy , or alchemy, or anthropology threatening sometimes to destroy the power of the truth by overwhelming it with error ,—just as soemtimes in the forest there is a rank underflowth which threatens to destroy the forest-trees heneath whose shelter it grew, and round whose trunks it entwines itself. In our own age the same tendency exists —men knowing a little elaim in to know much; it mistakes science for omniscience. The present age is repeating the experience of past times in a new and more subtle shape " Besides, it is to be remembered that the development of science has of necessity been one-sided M ltenal things rather than consciousness have been the favorite hold of investigation Some indeed, boast of this The Positivist (though it must be allowed that the doctrines of Positivism have been variously modified) after postulating a whole system of metaphysics, after assuming in full faith the integrity of the testimony of consciousness, and of the operations of reason, declines to consider metaphysical questions There is much to account for the comparative neglect of the study of mind We speak, of course, generally when we speak of this neglect There have been many able men who have turned their attention to such matters, but then speculations reach comparatively few, and excite but little interest. There is much in the com- parative certainty and immediate fruitfulness of physical investigation to attract men to its pursuit; while, on the other hand, the facts of man's spiritual nature are hard to be understood, and apparently slow to yield scientific fruit Some despair of anything like certainty in such knowledge some think that if any real knowledge is to be gained it will be by approaching such questions from the physical sides-a method which will certainly yield a good deal of valuable knowledge, but which can never solve any real difficulty Some, seeing how small a part of mental and spiritual life comes within the domain of consciousness, may despair of finding the laws of mental life, because there seems to be no adequate instrument of investigation, the origin of thought and feeling and will being a subject about which consciousness tells us nothing But whether we can trace laws or not we are not justified in disregard- ing facts Yet this is the habit of mind into which many fall To them the substances and processes of external nature have a reality which belongs to nothing mental or spiritual eyes and stones, electricity and chemical affinity, seem things more real than mind and thought, righteousness and sin While there is reason to fear the effects of the present state of things upon the thoughtless who are easily imposed upon by strong dogmatism and loud proclamations of in- fallibility from whatsoever source they may come—and upon thoughtful men too, upon those thoughtful enough to see 'difficulties, but who fail from different causes sometimes, honesty compels us to say, from want of moral earnestness, to see any thing but difficulties Let it be distinctly kept in view that I am attempting to account for a certain form of opposition to Christianity, The evil lies deeper than the form and we must not imagine that a change in the direction of scientific inquiry would eradicate the evil There is yet a satisfaction in feeling that the controversies which have long distracted men's minds are beginning to assume a more honest form The great question, said a great German thinker long ago is, 'Is there a God ?' Many are terrified to have such a question moved Some who cling to bare theism shrink from considering it, and are intolerant of every one who points out the difficulties and anomalies of their position, while ready enough to point out the difficulties of any position but their own. Would you drive us; they say, to mere atheism ? Christians are sometimes afraid lest controversy should take such a shape, afraid to see in a distinct form the very same enemy which under different disguises they have been combating all along. But whether it be desirable to have controversy in this shape or not, come I believe it will. It will be a rude shock to many. Faiths— so called— founded on the commandments and traditions of men may go down before it—but faith which is not founded upon truth is worth nothing. So far as true faith is concerned the contest will do it good, and it may have some effect in rousing some from indifference and heartlessness. I do not make light of the transient forms of controversy which come up from time to time, but I am fully persuaded that the question raised so often about the credibility of miracles, the possibility of prophecy, the utility of prayer are frequently false issues which hide the real question from men's minds. They are great questions, but the answers to them depends upon the answer given to others, which go even deeper, but which men will not face "We have had to refer to science. Let us never be tempted to take up a false position with regard to science as though it were in any sense an antagonist to religion. Good men have been tempted into this position, and the truth has triumphed over them. Let us not repeat their error and attack an ally as an enemy. Faith in Christ will make us rejoice in all scientific success. If we believe that the material universe is a product of a spiritual power —if we believe that the invisible things are seen and under stood by the things which are made —we may be sure that all the discoveries of science will ultimately tend to enlarge our knowledge of God, and things spiritual and eternal. Science too has done great service to religion by giving clearer conceptions of the nature of law. Once the highest form of order known to them was that of human law, and, as I think is practically admitted by all now, this method of conceiving of God's ways led to one-sided views of His character and government Of course the laws of matter will never explain the laws of spirit, but they help to an understanding of them This very discipline of law has been a great training for the Church of Christ, analo gous in some respects to the training of the Jewish Church under the ceremonial law One great lesson it has taught is the sacredness of truth even in little things There is something deeply instructive in the patient, humble, the toll- able spirit which has characterised the true searchers into nature their reverence for their work and thorough conscientiousness in it-their desire to search out the truth and to present it in its own simplicity and inherent beauty have been an example to us all It is true that sometimes the same men who would give the most patient and persevering attention to the physical inquiries to which they have devoted themselves, are rash and unguarded in speaking of matters of far higher moment It is sad, that any one who would give days and weeks of patient investigation to the habits of an animalculae, should be ready with the boldest conscience to pronounce, without thought or sense or reverence, upon all the difficulties of the moral universe Nevertheless, the lesson which in their own department of knowledge they teach, is a valuable one, and it has been one much needed. When we consider how ready men, even in the main good men, have been to pro his faith in any thing and everything they were told to believc., we see the need of such a lesson To what strange results this Injury has led Some have thought of man's belief as if it were a thing that he had a right to give up or retain at his own pleasure-to give up if it will tend to formal unity-or to be adopted if others agreed to it-the theory of Church councils This is to make man mastered the truth, and not its servant Some have thought that bold profession of faith in matters not considered and not understood was unflinching adherence to truth, instead of being a brazen adherence to falsehood While, by reaction, some have identified carelessness about doctrine with liberality of mind, and have looked upon it as a sort of merit to have as few beliefs as possible All these are sinsngatnst the sacredness of truth, and from what cover source we learn that truth even in its humbler forms, is a sacred thing and learn ray of once for it, let us be glad of the lesson The lesson which science has learnt, as Bacon long ago pointed out, is the lesson of the kingdom of Heaven, that man must humble himself to learn The sound which it caught it echoes back to us Let the patient care which is bestowed in tracing out the wisdom of God in his humbler works teach us the reverence and the patient thought and humble spirit with which we ought to approach the most momentous facts with which we have to deal, Gol H truth in His word, His revel ition by His Son, the cb e never of the Almighty maker of all, and His wonderful ways to the children of men "Let us find, we may add, religiously up in our good, deal in the controversies with which we have to deal who form to the spirit of Christ in trying to defend the truth the weapons of denunciation and abuse which come so readily to hand we must avoid they will do no real good The spectacle of a man holding up to se Ern and contempt men more able und vastly more lent ned than himself, on the by subjects of which he is speaking, is not an edifying one Nor is such denunciation worthy of a Christian Every man, however humble his attainments and talents, has a right to avow his heart-felt convictions, and to give a reason of his faith, if he does so with meekness and so doing he may with God's blessing on the result and leave the is he to Him if he has spoken the truth and perhaps from many wiser in this world's knowledge it will not be in vain But we must not all the denunciations so easily made, and which was a little cheap and worthless applause from the unthinking, are sometimes but little better than so much profane swearing Surely we can confess our Lord without using the means which the apostle took when denying him oaths and cursing "I feel that I must have these rather desultory and very imperfect remarks to a conclusion I have omitted much that I intended to say in connection with the topics which I have touched upon We live beyond doubt, in times of rapid change, and we may say in one sense, of very great peril Those who have the burden of the ministry of the word to bear have need of much wisdom, and very deep earnestness Otu safeguard, as has been truly said by one to whose wise counsels given at home, and which have done us good here, lies in preaching Christ I live on devoured to discriminate between the passing forms of conti over sy and the spiritual deadness of mens nature, which is the real evil with which we hay c to cope To reach this we must preach Christ and Him crucified M o must proclaim His tenderness and gentleness, His strength and His righteousness We must preach Hun fully, do clearing His redeeming mercy, His revelation of God, His example to men We must preach Him as the man Christ Jesus, and as the Word made flesh We must preach Ills perfect sacrifice, Ills death for Bins We must not 1 east of His words and be ashamed of Ilia cross We must preach because we believe o, and not one word more than we believe We must not preach because we have heard certain things which it has never occurred to us to question We must preach truths not because they have been generally received, but because we personally have felt their power We me to speak not as hearsay witnesses, but as living witnesses to Chnst s living power And we are to preach, humbly feeling that we have as much need of Christ s redeeming love as the outcast who walks the streets " And for all Christian men there is a noble work to be done Show by word and by life that spiritual things are no mere dreams—that the things of Christ are a real power within us. This is the witness for Christ which all his people should bear, and this witness attacks directly the great evil against which the work of the Church of Christ lies. It is a most instructive fact that at the time of the reaction against Rationalism in Germany, some who did most good were men by no means of large learning or vast powers of mind, and their influence was felt and acknowledged by men of the most vigorous intellect, and most profound learning If the Church of Christ would awake to its great work of bearing witness for Him humbly and faithfully, what a change would be effected We should not see the sad spectacle of people calling themselves Christians, and spending more upon their amusements than they are willing to give for the work of Christ's kingdom— giving to the service of then Lord and the study of His truth only the time when they are too wearied to engage in what they are pleased to call active duties of life. To live a life of faith in the best resistance we can offer to the dangers of our time. Is there danger in Rationalism? We shall best overcome it by showing that religion is no mere name, but a mighty power over heart and life. Is there danger in Ritualism?— an evil which also proceeds from man's spiritual deadness, and his aversion to make the salutary effort to apprehend directly that which is spiritual. We shall best avoid it by realising the fact that the spirit of God is the spirit of holiness and purity and love, which cannot, from its very nature, be transmitted in a so-called Apostolic succession, as a magical charm by the hands of men, many of whom were steeped in infamy, and who reached their position in the nominal Church by treachery and bloodshed. Let us show our conviction of the Real Presence of the Saviour with His people— real, because Spiritual—and we shall not want to see our Redeemer in a piece of bread. A faithful witness borne to Christ in a holy life is the best witness against infidelity in all its forms, and the most powerful in its effect. It rebukes indifference, and is a divinely- appointed means of awaken- ing others to solemn thought " We have said that in one sense we live in times of peril. It is only true in one sense, however. In one sense the Church always in danger. It is always in danger of falling short of the work to which Christ has called it. In another sense it is never in danger It is never in danger from without. The danger is, lest the faith of the disciples should fail, not lest they should be lost in the tempest while Christ is with them. We have His pro- mises and His presence. Out of seeming danger He will bring deliverance. He has often brought good to His Church out of apparent adversity, and we may be sure that He will not leave us Perhaps out of the dangers which seem to encompass His kingdom, He is going to bring good It may be that He will bring out of the ranks of opposition those who will fight His battle those who will love His truths, not as a peaceful position, handed down to them, but as that which has saved them from the shores of doubt and despair those who will guide others, and who will bring His authors from time to time it has to be brought to His people with fresh and living power Did we not thus those Saul of 'Tarsus? One thing is certain In one way or another He will defend his own cause, and His light and glory shall shine through His Church upon the world for the voice that spoke at the beginning shall speak once again, say ing Let there be light, and there shall be light, for the glory of God shall lighten it, and the Lamb shall be the light thereof.
