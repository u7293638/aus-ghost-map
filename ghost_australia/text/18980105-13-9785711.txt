WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1898. The municipal Czar, disguised as a mayor, which New York has invented has just entered upon the duties of his remarkable office. Mr. Van Wyck, who holds this office, and who is to New York what the Czar is to Russia or the Mikado to Japan, is the nominee of the Tammany ring, and represents, of course, all the principles which have made the very name of that ring an abhorred sound in the ears of honest men. As our cable messages of yesterday reported, Mr. Van Wyck, as his first official act, has removed 52 of the chief municipal officials, and re- placed them by Tammany Hall nomi- nees. The principle of "the spoils to " the victors" runs through American politics. It was erected into a car- dinal principle of public policy by General Jackson when be became President, and has been the curse and the scandal of American public life ever since. Tammany Hall is, in a sense, the political heir of General Jackson, and in New York it has carried his evil "spoil system" to a very high pitch indeed. Great offices in the city and in the state are so much booty—mere plunder to be divided between the thieves and rascals who, by the agency of the party "machine" and of "boss" rule, have captured the city. And never was there such a field for gigantic " steals" as that offered by New York under its new municipal system. The Greater New York Charter Bill has created a mammoth city, in area larger than London, in population only a little smaller, and with property assessments amounting to £600,000,000 sterling. It is not so much a city as a state. It has a revenue of £15,000,000 sterling—a revenue which might well make all the second-class powers of the modern world turn green with envy. And to guard this vast muni- cipality, congested with wealth, from falling, like so many other American cities, into the hands of thieves a type of mayor has been invented such as the astonished world has never before beheld. In power he resembles rather a Pope of the Middle Ages, or the Em- peror of China amongst his pig-tailed subjects, than any municipal head the other great cities of the civilised world would tolerate. He holds office for four years. He has a veto over all expenditure. He makes all appoint- ments; under certain limitations he decides all assessments. He exercises, practically without control, all the patronage of a huge city-state. Now, this glorified mayor, a mere civic em- peror, with his autocratic powers, was invented to save New York from thieves. There was to be, in brief, one single and responsible officer, elected by universal suffrage, with ab- solute power and a fixed term of office. The "machine" system, it was calcu- lated, would be powerless against such a great official, and the reign of the political "boss" would be over. No satire is so keen and biting, however, as the satire of history; and, by a stroke of practical irony which it would be difficult to parallel, all this elaborate machinery, which was de- signed to make the reign of the "boss" impossible, has resulted in the apotheosis of the "boss"! Tammany Hall has captured Greater New York. Mr. Van Wyck is its nominee; the " spoils" are once more being dis- tributed amongst the victors, and never before were the spoils so golden. At one stroke 52 of the leading muni- cipal officers of New York have been dismissed, and will be replaced by Tammany nominees. According to the Tammany Hall principle, too, each official appointed pays a percentage of his income into the treasury of the " machine" so that a huge fighting fund is always in existence to buy votes, and to bribe newspapers, and to carry on new campaigns. The real governors of New York, in fact, are the 34 "sachems" or "bosses" of Tam- many Hall, who hold no legal office whatever, who are mere party managers, but who have captured Greater New York. The new civic emperor, its mayor, is its mere puppet, and all the municipal offices of New York, big or little, will be held by Tammany Hall nominees. New York already bears an evil name as being one of the most corrupt of muni- cipalities in the English-speaking world; and it pays the penalty of cor- ruption in the circumstance that it is the worst managed and most heavily taxed of all the great cities of the modern world. But what may not happen to New York now that its new charter has become a mere tool in the hands of the "bosses" and " heelers" of Tammany Hall? "Boss" Tweed was an example of what was done in the green tree; what may not happen in the dry? It is a proof of the high standard of integrity and common sense which obtains in our public affairs that we can hardly so much as imagine the " spoils" system being established amongst us. The temper of our politics is sometimes sordid enough, but what would be the state of things amongst us if, say, with every change of Ministry every postmaster in the colony was dismissed, and his place filled by a local politician of the same complexion as the party that had just come into power? If every office in the civil service were the prize of poli- tical warfare it is easy to understand how this would corrupt politics and fatally injure the public service. If the " spoils" system, again, crept into the municipalities, and the officers of the city appeared and vanished like so many troops of flitting ghosts with each new mayoral election, it is easy to understand that the result would be to turn the cities themselves into fer- menting nests of corruption. Yet this is the spectacle we behold in Greater New York! And this, too, has come into existence in a pure demo- cracy, and under the system of uni- versal suffrage! This is a state of things which might almost drive a despondent critic to despair, if not of the race, yet of the democratic system as a method for governing the race. But despair is never a sane mood. New York will, no doubt, learn wisdom in time by the things it suffers, and com- mon sense in that great city on the Atlantic sea-board will vindicate itself in due time.

The power to supervise outworkers under the Factories Act was granted solely upou the ground of wages, because It was strongly urged that this was the only menus by which sweating eoold bo delcatetl and the "log" prices main- tained lu the Interests of those Inside and outside factories alike. The point was yielded with misgiving, because of- the unpleasant air It- liad of mar- shalling and ticketing honest work- women ns though they weie prosecut- ing some dangerous or suspicious call lug. Ami nlienily we see this attempt by jealous and prejudiced people to carry Hie dragooning process further. Because outworkers have been regis- tered, and permission given lo visit mid Interrogate them as to their rate of pay, it Is audaciously assumed that homo sewing work lins been niade ¡in industry which can only be legally engaged in under the badge of utter poverty. So far as we know, tim inetnl budge of the bottle and bone collector, or the license of the suburban hawker, have not to be competed for under such grinding restrictions. It is pleasant to nuilee Mr. I'ottcock's correctness of attitude. But why explain so suavely to these applicants that ninny of tim women referred to, despite the decency lu externals which tiley bravely uiaintuin, are probably sorely in want of Hie few shillings they ob- tain by factory work? It is perfectly time, no doubt, in tilla nnd other branches of industry. The most needy and tho most deserving are often those who Indomitably concenl their strait- ened menus from the prying eyes of the world. But the "objectors who would step between them and their livelihood hnvo no title to any consola- tory nssiirnnces of tho sort ¡it the hands oí the Government. The right to labour lins not yet been ubrognted Ia this colony, nnd no net of the Legislature has provided that the sewing-machine must bo worked by pauper», mid by no others at their peril.
