FORWARDING AGENTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-Will reference to Mr. J. Dennistoun Wood's letter in your issue of of to- day, may I ask that gentleman to point out in what part of the Carriers' Act the usual provisions in a penal statute are to be found, defining and regulate the mode of recovering the penalties affixed by the Act, whether by action of the Attorney-General in the Supreme Court, or by proceedings before the Justices in Petty Sessions in a summary way and how such penalties, when recovered, are to be appropriated and distributed, I have failed to discover any such provision, and unless I am greatly mistaken, the clauses quoted by Mr. Wood, as well as several others, are wholly inoperative, and the Justices authoress referred to were perfectly correct in dismissing the charge, as being altogether ultra vires. your obedient servant, July 18.
