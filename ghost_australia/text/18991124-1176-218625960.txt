A GHOST IN A COPPER MINE. ——— BLAYNEY, Monday. — Some consternation has been caused amongst some of the miners at the copper mine by the visitations of a ghost in one of the shafts. The men hear strange noises, bells ringing, sighing, groanings, etc. Miners going below have their candles extinguished by a supernatural visitor, and some of the miners allege that something brushed past them. Six men have left the mine owing to the terror the ghost has inspired.
