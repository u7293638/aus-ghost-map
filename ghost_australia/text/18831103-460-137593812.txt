THE DERBY. Last year I gave in these columns a history of tile Melbourne Cop, and now a little gossip relating to the great three-year-old race, established by the victoria Rating Club in 1868, will doubtless be read with interest by all who are fond of reminiscences of the past. There had been many Derbys previously ran imder the auspices of the Melbourne Turf and Joekey Clubs, but it was not until the demise of these two institutions, and the birth from their ashes of our present leading racing institution, that the Derby was made the attractive event it now is. The first Derby ran under the auspices of the Victoria Jockey Club was that which was decided at Flemington in October, 1857, when Mr. Greene's Tricolor, by The Premier, was triumphant - This beautiful daughteraoin of Toiyboy waa 'the^Sm^of that sterling8!)!^of stuff Norma, winner of the Australian Cup, end whose son Pollio was successful in the same race, and this year is fancied for the Mel bourne Cup by many of the knowing ones who have been watching the doinga of the horses preparing at Cwnlfield. In 1858 another son of The Premier carried off the. bine riband, this bring ho other than Mr. Austin's Brownlock; and in l8w the memor able set-to between Buzzard and Flying Buck took place. That was the year pf the first great Champion Kaee. which had been won by Mr. W. Yuille's Plying Buck,' and consequently he wasroonrideted a metal for the three-year-old event, bat he mat h' rattling good colt in Mr. John Gr&Busated;, who caught the Buck a bit"off" andbeat him. There was a great hubbub about the defeat of the favourite, but 1 believe there waa nothing in it Flying Buck subsequently won races, but he never recovered his trip to Sidney, whither he went to ran for^the son rimnmd^mwinner in I860, whenlis fiUy Flying Colours carried his jacket to the front; She was ridden by a good- natured Irishman whom wemed in Imr days to call "old Billy Treacey."

Fire works, whom I remembered as a powerful clean-legged, peculiar- coloured youngster that 1 had seen running in the lnrnriant paddocks of Maribymong, was not considered good enough to give a high price for at that extra ordinary disposal of the Maribymong Stud, which tookptace cloee'to old Fishermans grave! when a member of the Tattereall | wielded the hammer, and so successfully got through one of the most sensational Bales of modern times. Those who were present will remember the almost fabnlons prices paid for some of the descendants of Fisherman, while the white-legged Bon of Kelpie and Gaslight was allowed to be knocked down to the solitary bid of 200 guineas, given by Mr. P. J. Keighran, then one of the most (successful men on the turf. I be lieve Mr. S. Martin purchased & half I Bhare in the colt, who was so loaded with oerfluoUB beef that it was found impos jle to thoroughly prepare him for die | Flemington Stakes in the autumn, and he came to the poet full of flesh. His driest.by Little Fish was not therefore, unexpected. Bat later on, when he had improved in con dition, he had ample revenge in the A.J.C. ' Champagne Stakes, wherein he and Little | Fish fought their battle o'er again, with the result that the places were reversed, Fire ' works beating Little Fish easily by three | lengths, while another great animal of the future was third, this Mug no other than Glenooe. After carrying 8st 121b., and win ning the Nursery Handicap, Fireworks was disposed of to Major Mylne, who leased the colt to Mr. John Tait for all of his three-year old »og»ge- inenta, and in the popular yrilow and black the Bon of Kelpie accomplished his most famous victories. After winning the A.J.C. Derby and the Derby run at the | V.R.C. spring meeting, be once more was opposed oy Little Fish in the first Victoria Derby, which waa decided on the 1st of January, 1868. The only other starters were Token and Kingfisher, but none of them had a show with Fireworks, who won in a hand I rflntpri and directly afterwards cao&e; wrt 6st upon his back and won the Mid I summer Handicap, one mile and three* Quarters, in 3m. 6a.
