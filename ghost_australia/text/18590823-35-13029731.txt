A STATESMAN. ' Captain ho he, my England, who doth know it Not careful cowie, with inland wUoomes warm, But who, with heart infallible, can go Straight to the gulf streams of the World, where blow the inevitable Winds. Let cockies swarm The sounded shores. He helms Theo, England ! who, Faced by the very Spirit of the Storm, Tall at the phantom drives his dauntless prowl And tho' the vision read in reeks of blood, ' And help In thunder from his feeling Beats, The compass in his hand, beholds the flood Beneath, o'er head the c\ everlasting stars Dim thro' the gory ghost, and calm In these, Thro' that tremendous dream sails on to hippie seas.
