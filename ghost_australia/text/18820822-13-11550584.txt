THE HE-OnaANlSAt'ION OF THE LOCAL FORCES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-We have read in your issue of the nth net a letter signed " Tribune," on the re or, assertion of the local forces With much of what the writer has advanced I entirely agree, as do, no doubt, most other officers, I am there is one " matter of fact " in which I think he is in error, and if so I am sure he will excuse me for setting; him right I allude to his comparison of the numerical strength of the officers of the local forces with that of the regular army The given the number of officers of the former at 2? , but I have before me the local army list, and I can only find 200 names of those actively employed, including that is, all the stuff, but not, of course, the unattached or retired hats 'Una will give, for 1,000 men ("Tribune's" number), one officer to every 20 men Now, let us take a Line regiments), the 18th, the last of which any portion was stationed in this colony and we shall find, on reference to the Army List, O officers for the 1st and 2nd battalions, which, taking those battalions, BB "Tribune' does at SOO men each, gives rather more than one officer 23 men, so that you are, the dia proportion is very little, and if in the latter case as in the former, the general and district staffs were taken into account the difference would be still further reduced, and might possibly) be even in favour of the local forces And now, Sir, though my original intention in addressing you was simply to rectify what I believed to be an error, it will not perhaps be considered out of place, if I add a few general remarks respecting our volunteer system, which, BE I understand, it is in contemplation shortly to abolish altogether. That that system is in some respects defective and capable of improvement, both in its organisation and in many of its details, I freely admit, but both as a citizen and a soldier, I should very much regret to witness the total extinction Much has been said of insubordination and of want of discipline end of the means of enforcing it well For some years past I have not taken any active part in military matters, and therefore am unacquainted with the existing state of any of the various volunteer crew, but I once had the honour of being in immediate command of one for over tea years I not only carried out to the letter the local regulations, but rigid') enforced the principles which govern the regular array, Mid I can safely say, not only that I never met with a single instance of insubordination, or disregard of my authority, but that the discipline of the corps would have borne very favourable comparison With that of any regiment in the British arms 1 attended ever) parade, and personally drilled the corps once a week, and my mate actions were invariably received with attention and respect, and my orders promptly and im- police!) obeyed It was always with pride and pleasure that I met my comrades, on parade or elsewhere, and life so confident that any commandant of volunteers who is conversant with his duty and posesses a reasonable amount of tact and discretion, may easily find him self in a similar position Something too, and not a little, has been Old about the men not attending enough daylight parades, and therefore having assaulted and opportunities of learning anything of battalion or brigade movements No doubt there is something in this, so far as the superior officers are concerned, but to the rain h and fill it If, I think, of little importance If a man can load and fire, match, (countermand, sec at the word of command, if, in short, he is a good shot and a proficient in company drill-a thorough knowledge of which he can acquire in a large orderly-room as much as any where else he can do nearly all that will ever be expected from him in the field, for what are the measures of a battalion, a brigade, or even a large army, but combinations of company movements' Doubt- less, as I said before, it is desirable that the superior officers should possess a knowledge of ( extended operations, but I think that with a little good management, and perhaps a little additional expense, they may easily be afforded opportunities of learning all that IS neceesary Moreover, I am one of those who think that there is not a " ghost of a chance of our ever, or at least for many years to come, having to encounter a large army, or to enter on a protracted campaign , the most that we can expect, and even that is scarcely probable, is that a few hundred men may be landed at Western Port or somewhere on the cover, and I am much mistaken if our dear- ing volunteer force, let them be even as bad as they are represented to be, would not effectually dispose of such an invasion in a few hours, or days at the utmost. What we want, Sir, is a permanent force of skilled artillery men to man our batteries and work our guns, plenty of torpedoes, with men who know how to use them without blowing each other to pieces, and perhaps a gunboat or two By all means let us have these at whatever coat, but not cents, I would say leave well alone A bird in the hand, it is said, is worth two in the bush. Let us hold just to one bird till we have caught another and a better Let us try and improve our volunteer system by gentle means and gradual steps not by total Subversion The existing force can supply plenty of first-rate shots to support our artillery in the batteries and elsewhere, and I have no doubt that they would, in caused a hostile landing turn out almost to a son. though very possibly they would not or could not, serve for a lengthened period a net, however, they will)! never be «"«'"fj'i1-0: and whatever may be said in 'disparagement of our present system, I think o'! v. ftlT * that it affords, to say the least of it, an excellent "state school" for military to join Uar young men, if they only serve for a few months and many have served for years learn the use of arms, and can scarcely fail to acquire habits of obedience and self control, and something like a knowledge of military discipline, and so fit themselves to render good service to their country hereafter should any need for it unfortunately arise and even if tll1e!r,v0_,u?__ Mary and gratuitous enrolment should lean to nothing else, the drill they undergo must im- prove their personal carriage and physical up pearance, . , , , "" r One forward step in the right direction I have always advocated, for the reasons so are quently urged by yourself that Myles's capitulate them I mean the selection from the regular army of Staff officers, to be relieved at stated interval, as in the case I believe, of all staff appointments in the im- perial service. This step, it 0PPea"|f.,f been already decided on, and minor alters lions and improvements may, I venl.u_rp8,,f,. think, be easily effected, so as to render unnecessary a resort to the last alternative-the abolition of the volunteer force - Yours, w, C.
