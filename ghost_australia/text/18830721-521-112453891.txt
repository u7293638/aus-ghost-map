THE DYING BAUD. (An Allegory.) His honra were numbered—'twas the last, TliO aged linrd was dying fast The.harp he loved lay idly by And caught 110 more Iiis dimming cyo : A youth passed slowly by the way And marked the sufferer as lie lay, And proffered aid, and asked to bring The cooling water from the spring. He murmured thanks in low reply, But I'ointud where the harp, lay by : " Haut thou a soul for song," he said, " Uro mortal darknoss round me spread," " 'Twould cheer my heart, 'twould ease my pain " " To hear that blessed voice again." With burning soul and eye of fire The youth' took up the fallen lyre ; Boldly and well he struck the chords, But uori'ow trembled in his words ; —Called from the past its living ghost And causod to pass th' immortal host "Whoso song hath kept the spirit whole, And guards the altars of the soul : He watched the old bard's kindling eye And thought that yet he might not die ; But fainter tones and failing breath Showed nighor drew the s(ep.of death ; And soon in palsied cheek was shown A pilgrim to the land unknown. The old bard praised the strains he loved, And so his wrealh of bays removed ; Awoke from dream« of vanished joy, And with his chaplet crowned the boy ; And calm in death before him lay His soul on music borne away.
