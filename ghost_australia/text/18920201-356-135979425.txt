cORRESPONDENCE CdROUNDINt0 O'P T1iE S.S. TEKPLO. To THE EDITORt. SIa,--One of the most damaging advertise. ments for Newcastle harbour that has visited us for some time was the unfortunato incident of the grounding of this steamer through apparently no possible fault of the captain and oflfcers of that vessel. Although it may be ruinous to them, and necessitating con siderable pocuuiary lose to the owners, the calamity may be productive of good in the future, if the powers that be, and those whose duty it is to watch and guard our interests, do their duty. One of the vitals of this is the improvement in deepening our harbour, and especially the entrance, so as to ensure better and safer navigation to the owners of the valuable shipping pro perty that frequents our waters. This die. aster should have the effect of stimulating the somewhat phlegmatic spirit that existsin our midst, and more particularly those whose concern it is to bring about the amprove ments absolutely requisite for the safety of entrance to our port, the delay of which is penal. It is nauseating to refer to the ghost-like Local Govornmort Bill that ap pears on the soene periodically. Ytt there is a gloam of hope under the present administration of gettiog a proper measure through the prasant Parliament. Provision would therein be made, no doubt, for dealing with the subject under discus sion, and other paramount matters of im portance. It is disagreeable to pose as a pessimist, but when the propor fanctionaries whoso .province it is remain reticent, a reminder is wholesome, that the sooner a movement is made to form a Harbour 'Trust the better for all concerned, I shall not refer to other portions of Australia, nearly all ports of importance, except Newcastle, have a Harbour Trust. I tou.Qt those more closely identified with maritime effairs will agitate until a Harbour Trust for Newcastle is an accomplished fact.-I am, &o.;, C W. RIIADEI?T. Stosaton, 30th January.
