POETRY. EVERY HEART HAS GOT ITS ANTHEM. Every heart has something hidden In its cells that nought can sever, Pure as when it first had birth, And, like incense, burning ever. Guilt may float its crimson banners Close around its cloistered rest; Sorrow, ghost-like, hourly haunting, May for ever be its guest. Still unchanged and undefiled, Sings the voice implanted there-- Low and sweet, now fond and weeping, Blending, one and all, in pray'r. Strange and many are the anthems Breathed among life's quivering chords-- Mingling like the angels' voices, Chaunting to the "Lord of Lords." Now it leads the soul far downward Life's untranquil, restless sea, When the spotless brow was resting Meekly on a mother's knee. Now it shows a love long buried In a tress of silken hair-- Some dear one whose presence ever Haunts you in that vacant chair. Loving eyes of wife or lover, Sorrowful perchance they be; Broken vows and sable garments Rustle in its minstrelsy. E'en the voice of bird and river Run among its crystal bars; Up and down, for aye and ever, Changeless as the pathless stars. Every one has voices calling, From the uplands of the past-- Voices which may speak, and lead us Upward to a home at last. OSCAR HUGHAN.
