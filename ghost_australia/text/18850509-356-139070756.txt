Smugglers, Old and New. SWEEK X or so80 in an old smuggling vil lage. is extremely entertaining to the lover of ancient yarns, also an excel lent opportunity for filling a cigar- case. 8muggling is popularly sup. posed to be extinci; the chairman of the Board of Customs will tell you a very different story. This old mill, which stands out so picturesque and darksome against the twilight sky, has beneath it huge cellars, cut in the rock, edinmunicatiog with the miller's house hard by. In the old days, when the favourite method of smuggling was "running a bit of a carg'y," these caves have often been crammed with rum, hollands, and cognac, with bales of silk and many an ell of delicate point and Mezhlin. Increased taxa tion has made tobacco and cigars more profitable to these smugglers than ''right Nantz" or French silks. The cellars of the mill are empty now of contraband, and the moon, as she coyly shows herself side-face through the clouds, will not see a cargo " run" t~o.night. For, indeed, Will Watch is dead and gone, and the dark men in petticoats who fought at his back and made such havoc of their natural enemies, the coastguards and preven tive men, have disappeared into space, and are nowadays unknown to the very stage. Where is T. P. Cooke? and where the terrible 0. imith? and Fitzball of the hundred melodramas, and Ben Brace, and Jack Rattlin, and Tom Binnacle, and all their gallant confraternity? Only in the mansions of Skelt, his heirs and successors, do their semblances exist and their manly ghosts still walk.
