FIGHT FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP ; between KABLE AND CHALKER, This fight was nominally for £100 aside, but it was really a matter of mere emulation between the two boxing heroes of the Australian P. R. It came off on Friday last. The bets upon the event of this fight, were unprecedented in amount among the sporting circles of the Colony, and the interest the match excited in the breasts of the native youth, amounted to an ethusiasm which was expected to be at- tended with unpleasant consequences. The spot chosen for the contest, was about a mile and a half from Pyes' public house on the Windsor road, and no or- dinary pains were taken by the department, to render the ring commodious, and to prevent intrusion ; for this purpose, a high paling was put up a few yards dis- tant from and around the ring ; a platform, large enough to hold about 20 persons, was built on one side, the admission to which was purchased at the rate of half a crown a head. At an early hour in the morning, the roads leading from all quar- ters to the ground, were crowded by vehicles hurrying to the spot ; in fact it might be supposed by a new comer, that a good portion of the whole population of the Colony was assembled to witness the fight. At half past 9 o'clock, the parties met at the half-way house, when Chalker saluted Kable with a hearty shake of the fist, and they entered into friendly conversation together, as though they were unconcerned about the after- piece. † Both appeared in fine condition and in high spirits, and they parted to make the necessary preparations for the ___________________________________ † We cannot but look upon this anecdote of Australian nationality without feelings of pride.

Kable was the second who made his appearance on the ground. He was greeted with deafening shouts by the Hawksbury lads and lasses, many of the latter, we are sorry to say, having assembled (some on horseback others in gigs) near the spot, to testify to the hon- our of the Windsor Hope,‡ who was con- fidently expected to polish off the South- Creek hero in the first five rounds. Chalker had arrived about a quarter of an hour before ; but so great was the interest which the majority of the spectators took in the Champion, that Chalker was scarcely noticed until introduced on the Arena. Since his last set-to, Chalker seemed to have acquired a degree of easy non- chalance in his fighting, which formed a strong contest with the evident loss sus- tained in the science by the Champion. The heralds having called the comba- tants, and every thing being arranged, the two boxers, impatient of delay, en- tered the ring ; Chalker being waited on by Jack Cosgrove, and Kable by Keys, both of milling notoriety. On coming to the scratch, the Herculanean frames of the men foreboded evil to the vanquished. Chalker however appeared to have the advantage in compactness , whilst Kable had the ascendancy in weight, and in the length of his reach. FIGHT. Round 1. — Some good sparring was dis- played by each party, Kable trying to lead Chalker after him, in his usual style. Chalker, wide awake, stood his ground, setting- too very closely. Kable often shifted, and at last finding his decoy would not take, he rushed in, and gave Chalker a heavy fall. 2 to 1 on the Champion. Round 2. —Kable was quickly up, and appeared determined for work. Chalker rigidly kept his ground, with all his points covered in fine attitude, and Kable a second failed in his endeavours to move him. In delivering a feint, Kable receiv- ed a nobber from Chalker, which made the claret fly, and Kable again rushed in and threw Chalker heavily. Round 3. — Kable made play at Chal- ker's bread-basket, but the South-Creeker dropped his guard over his victualling office, and stopped every blow. Kable then changed his system, and effected several heavy body hits, which did not appear to be felt by Chalker. Chalker put in a mowing hit on Kable's wind chest, when they closed, and Kable ef- fected a third heavy throw, which shook but did not injure Chalker. Round 4. — It was pretty clear to the most superficial observer, that Kable threw much strength away in the exertions he had made to throw his adversary, and in setting to, he appeared all abroad, which enabled Chalker to place a giant- like stroke on his temple, which grogified the champion, and made the odds more in favour of the former, who again went to the ground under the powerful arm of the champion, but without receiving any in- jury. Round 5.— Kable summoned all his powers and Chalker received a little punishment about the body which altered his fighting for a second or two ; Kable immediately perceived his advan- tage, and with a well-directed left hander, brought Chalker to the grass. Ronnd 6. — The last round had cooled Chalker, who came to the scratch with de- termined bottom, and with even greater self-possession than he had yet shewn ; his stopping was fine, and he nobbed the champion, receiving however, full change in his hull, which exhibited the handy-work of the Windsor hero, when they both went down, Kable undermost. Round 7- — Chalker was still in his best trim, while Kable was wearing away. Ka- ble still trying to decoy his man and get him off his guard, but Chalker was im- moveable, and planted some heavy facers, when they closed, and both went down, Kable again down. Round 8. — Kable mustered his force, and went in, in earnest, throwing out right and left, but losing his distance eve- ry hit. Chalker studying philosophy , and receiving every blow on his guard, con- vincing the spectators that in addition to his other qualifications, he might now be considered as a first-rate tactition. Chalker after wearying his antagonist by his cool- ness, took the measure of the Champion's os frontis, and sent him off his pins. Any odds in favor of Chalker. Round 9. — Kable was feeble in coming to the scratch. He had asked his second for a drink of brandy and water, which was gone for, but time was called be- fore he could take it. Chalker, with Australian good nature, requested him to wait for it, and not hurry himself ; this offer the Champion was too proud to ac- cept, and they "met again," but found in each other no ghost. Chalker was cool, in good wind, and scarcely scrached ; Ka- ble was queer in his bellows, much beaten, and seemed losing his self-possession. Chalker now commenced to do his work in earnest ; he knocked down the Cham- pion's guard, and put in a facer, which sent the latter on the ropes ; Chalker fol- lowed up, and was prepared with a finish- er, when seeing that his man was incapa- ble of exertion, he threw up his hands, & walked to his seconds, amidst the plaudits of the spectators. Round 10. — Kable was evidently done up ; he scornfully rejected the proposal of some of his friends, to resign the belt to __________________________________ ‡ Very peculiar also, but not quite so hon- ourable.

A rally ; both down ; Kable under. Rounds 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, were nearly similar in their results. Chalker's repeated fibbing had occasioned the champion's nut to loom like Beachy- head in a fog ; he was under in every fall, which closed all these rounds. Round 17. — Kable recovered himself surprisingly, went in, and hit out right and left, which told on Chalker's ribs like the roll of a kettle drum ; Chalker fighting on the defensive, apparently little concerned for the hammering, and plant- ing some stunning nobbers, when the champion's guard at length opened, and Chalker grassed his man. Round 18. — Chalker at the scratch, smiling like a May morning ; Kable back- ward in coming to time, but determined to hold out for a chance. After some smart hitting on both sides, they closed, and both went down, Chalker falling on Kable with great force. Rounds 19 to 30, were mere repetitions of the last round, Kable falling off in every round, whilst Chalker seemed to acquire fresh strength, and seldom hit out without. fixing his mark, and bringing the champion to the ground. In the 30th round, Kable's friends, finding that he could not hit, and that he was dreadfully beaten, resigned the palm to Chalker, who immediately leapt the ropes, and was led away in triumph by the South- Creekers. Kable was removed in a gig, suffering acutely from Ned's discipline. REMARKS. The Hawksbury lads stood aghast at at the fate of this champion ; they had been sanguine beyond measure on the well-known prowess of their hero. All Windsor had staked thumping sums on their favourite, and when the news was carried home, the town appeared quite " down in the mouth." The rejection of the Reform Bill scarcely threw a greater damp on the people of England, than the events of this day did upon the lower orders of the district of Windsor. It was remarked, that Kable, from the com- mencement of the fight, had displayed a want of confidence, which helped to throw him out of his tact; and rendered the victory more easy to Chalker. Chalker, on the other hand, had wonderfully im- proved in science ; his attitudes were of the best, and his cool courage was enough to enrage a saint. It had not been without much labour, that Chalker was enabled to attain the perfection he displayed ; from the time the match was made, he accustomed himself to endure the most harrassing fa- tigue, by working as top-sawyer in a saw- pit, & the gains by the battle were scarcely equal to the proceeds of his labour before it. Finally, possessing all the advantages in the fight, he scorned to take advantage of the chances which fortune threw in his way, and acquired more honour by his manly forbearance, than he did by his courage and skill. Kable is rapidly on the decline ; he has a wife and family, which Chalker has not ; and it is to be hoped, that this fight will close his exer- tions in the Prize Ring, and lead him to some more respectable and certain mode of obtaining his living. At the lowest estimation it is reported, that £2000 ex- changed pockets on the fight.
