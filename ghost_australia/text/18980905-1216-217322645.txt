ANOTHER OUTRAGE AT THE ISLANDS. MURDER AND CANNIBALISM. SYDNEY, September 4. Another story of a ship's crew being massacred was brought to Sydney by the steamer Moresby from New Guinea ports. About a month ago the cutter Sea Ghost was despatched on a trading cruise to the Solomon group, under command of Capt. Colohorn. Near the island of Vusa, near Bogainville, the natives clambered aboard in large numbers. The captain was butchered, and four of the native crew, after a desperate fight, were overcome. The other two were taken prisoners, but escaped. The Sea Ghost was run ashore, looted and destroyed. The remains of the murdered men were taken to a village and consumed at a cannibalistic feast. The German warship Falke proceeds to the islenl to punish the perpetrators of the outrage.
