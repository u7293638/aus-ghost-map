Fieet Mail Carriers. The Indian runners are familiar figures in Mexico. They are employed by the Government to carry the mails among the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and make better time ttian any animal that could be em ployed. A ranaer will carry from 20 to 30 pounds of mail, and never be delayed by j ' washouts ' or swollen streams. He is i always on an easy run that must carry him j along at the rate of six or seven miles an \ hour at least. He is nearly always j dressed in white cotton cloth, which, makes ) him a conspicuous figure against the sombre ? green and black tints of the high mountain - levels, and which, late in the evening, ' causes him to look like a ghost or spectre flitting among the pines and firs and moss covered boulders strewn along the trail. The trails7oh the steep places, wind back ward and forward in stretches from 50 to 75 yards in length, in order to find a grade up which a heavily laden pack mule can make his way. But the athletic carrier does not run tne whole length of these windings in descend ing a hill, He cuts off the corners at each bend by placing his hand on the edge of the trail and vaulting to tne lower level whenever the two levels are not more than six or seven feet apart./ All this time he never . gives up the little dog trot that is Carrying him, for ward sa rapidly and, surely. The carrier will, in half an nour, go down a mountain Bide that would take the best mule in a bullion train or the fleetest on? ridden by the little Mexican eaballero, the beBt rider in the world, half a day to accomplish.* In ascending, too, the carrier has methods of taking shorter cuts up the steep in ciineB, so as to gain time and distance at every turn. â€” Liepincott's Magazine.
