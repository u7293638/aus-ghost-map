A VERY NARROW ESCAPE. All the ghost, mnrder and explosion stories had been told, and then a grizzly old captain took afresh chew of tobacco and observed : ' The "narrowest escape I ever saw was that of a man who came here in the hold of a vessel loaded with , pig iron He crept into the boat when she waa empty and went to sleep and when they came to load her they covered him np with iron . I suppose there wasn't less than 500 tons of the stnff on- top of him, and he was in that position for seven or eight days with nothing to eat or drink. When they got down to him .they took him ont; and a more surprised lot of dock wollopere yqu never saw.' ' ' How did he work it !' was asked. Work what I' 'Why, how did he escape being crashed ?' He was crashed. He .was as flat and Hin as that there sail.' ' I don't see where .the. narrow 'soape comes -in then,' said the lineman. ' Well, I do,' continued the. nomtor, and so would yon if yon had seen them just, take him out , through a seam In tbe side oft he boat.'- Then themeg broke up.â€” CRicapo Herald, , .
