Compensation, The hope that illumines the way of life Is a wili-o'-the-wiep that afar Lead* th through me zee --f toil and strife, A ghost in the guipe of a star. Then why should I oovet a, share, sweetheart, Of tie laurels with which they are crowned, Who vanquish, if no one will cars, sweetheart, When I am under the ground ? Transient and fleeting the light of love That indifference shadoweth soon, Fairest iilus on will often prove A bli ht where we hoped for a boon. Thus memory crushes my soul, sweetheart, With the bandage in which I am bound Till dtstiny deal out my dole, sweetheart, And I am under the ground ! Fruit is a dreamfie'd of youth's blight day, With life in its beauty and bloom, Eap).y the reapers who hear away Its fru ts, at the harvest time, home. But bitter the sorrowful thought, sweetheart, Though my name may be widely renowned ; How barren the waste where I wrought, sweetheart, When I am under the ground ! Joyous the day with its toils and tears. And troubled the visions ot night, Dr ary the gloom of the passing years, In their lonely monotonous flight. 'Tis but in remembering thee, sweetheart, -That my life's compensation is found ; Thou'lt cheriEh my meni'ry and me, sweetheart, When I am under the ground !
