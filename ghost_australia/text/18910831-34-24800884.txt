AMUSEMENTS. THEATERE ROYAL. At she Theatre Royal on Saturday night Mr. Dampier and his company presented for the first time in Adelaide a dramatized version of Rolf Boldrewood's novel "The Miners Bight" The play is well stagi^d, and the story an interesting one. In the lirst act wo find the hero, Hereward Pole (Mr. Dampier), about to leave England in company with his friend, Joe Bulder <ilr. J. 11. Atirtin). Their plans are ail made for aii immediate departure by the Red Jacket, with Melbourne as their destination, when they are stopped by a con spiracy between Algernon Malgrade (ilr. 1". C. Appleton), a dissolute and wort? thin lialf ruined resident of the ncighljorhood, and Ned Morsley (Mr. Robert Vernon), a low acquain tance of his. Malgrade is anxious to supplant Hereward in the affections of Uuth Auerton (Miss Rose Dampier), the squire's daughter, and Ned Morsley is .jealous of him because of the evident liking which his (Morsley's) sweet heart, Jane Mangold (Miss Lily Dampier), evinces for the young man, though in reality Hereward in no way returns her love. Sla! gra<!i> and Morsley put their viilanous heads together, commit a robbery at the hall, and succeed in getting Hereward arrested with the proceeds of the robbery actually in his passes sion. Everything looks very black against him, when, at the last moment, Jane Mangold brings forward evidence which completely turns the tables, and Malgradeand Morsley arc led off to prison, while Hereward and Joe Solder start for Australia. In the second act an interval of four years is supposed to have elapsed. We are at liallarat early in the "fifties?," nnd after a number of incidents illustrative of camp life we And Morsley and Malgrade—who have come out to Australia — in league with a third rascal named Poynter (Mr. Edmund Holloway), and endeavoring to oust Hereward and liis dividing mutes, Major Borlase (Mr. A. Rolfe), Cyrus Yorke (Mr. George Deanl, and good old .Too Bolder from their claim. They make two separate attempts in this direction, but arv twice foiled. Hence, in the third act, they turn their attention to robbery with violence, and, thanks once more to Jane, now Morsley's wife, their cleverly-laid schemes are again upset. Morsley, finding his wife acting as Heretrard's guardian angvl, grows madly jealous, and in a tit of delirium stabs and kills her, while Malgrade utilises the course of events that Hereward, instead of the guilty man, is arrested for the crime. Here wardi s trial forms an interesting scene. Every thing goes against him until the last moment, when certain testimony given by Mrs. Man grove (Miss Katherine Russell) fixes the guilt in tlie right quarter, and Ned Morsley is led away to gaol, while Uere vrard is released, but the arch-plotter Mai grade c«apt« from the clutches of the lav. and racaking down the shaft of the mine worked by Hereward and his mates, lays a train to several barrels of blasting powder, and fires this train just as a number of visitors including the chief characters of the drama, are inspecting the main drive. The train thus lurnted creep? like a fiery serpent across the stage until it all but touches the open powder barrels, when Mrs. Mangrove, who arrives on the scene in thr nick of time, uijee> her handkerchief most <-tf«> tively and prevents the impending catastrophe. Then Herewwd and Malgnde myet in a tinal hand-to-hand struggle, and the latter most satisfactorily receives iiis quietus. Such is thy barest outline of a plot which from first to last fairly bristles witii .-<?nsation, int<Tspersed with plenty of broad humor. There are numerous supporting'characters in the play, and the piece was performed in a style which evoked tho fre quest applause of the audience. It will be re peated until Thursday, when "As You Like It'" will be produced. THE "COt-NTT KAIR."' The sensational American drama, tliv "County Fair." the right to produce ■which in Australia lias been secured by Messrs. MacMahon, and which was played for tix weeks in Melbourne, will be i«tx3no«i in Adelaide on Saturday night next for the first time at the Theatre RoyaL The principals—Mr. F. J. Currier and 2Ubs Sadie Stringiiam—were engaged in America specially for this production. It is said to be redolent of Ivew England, the characters of Otis Tucker, Solen Hammerhead, and Abigail Prut-, being <**seutialiy Yankee in their style. One of ll.c jrr«-at attractions of the pl?3- is its scenery and mechanical effects. Chief amongst thellatlcr is tlie race scene, in which it is claimed that "'The spectacle is realised for the tirtt time upnn the stage, and with a reality that is pos-itiv«-ly startling in its effect, ff a real rnee actually run \>y real horses for a full milt- distance, at record speed in full view of th<\- audience.
