Sad. IN the Argus of Saturday we find the following notice under the head of " Marriages ".*— MACK.—On Monday tbe Rev. Nathaniel Kinsman, the Free Church of England in Victoria, celebrated, tlie 2500th marriage, marking the occasion by presenting the newly married couple, Mr. and Mrs Mack, of Prahran, with a large family Bible. Two thousand five hundred ! Fancy the amount of hairpulling and flat-ironing Nathaniel Kinsman is responsible for. Wonder if he is ever haunted by ghosts? ghosts of hairless husbands, pointing their latch keyless fingers at him, saying, " A little more than Kin(sman) be less than kind."
