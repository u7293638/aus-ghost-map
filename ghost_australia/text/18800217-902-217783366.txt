MRS. HUME'S LICENSE. (TO THE EDITOR;) SiR, — That's a nice characteristic of your con temporary's—blowing with the breeze. Time was,, and not so long since, when the P.M. was anything but a geutleman— everything but one competent to discbarge the onerous duties imposed on him. in its , estimation. But now " things is changed," as it | recently said, and Mr. Martin is a gentlemau, ur- bane, hnmppe, honest, up-right, and down straight, although that is a fact long since known to the right-thinking of our community. Now, don't you smell an " old man" rat, Mr. Editor, in this last effort to gain a little popularity in a direction which will only tolerate genuineness ? lean. Bat the effort is futile. No, Sir. nothing but sterling honesty and sincerity for that quarter. Bare-faced effrontery, won't wash. , And does the " local pho tometer think that that sort of fulsome i&atitery; will cause the P M. to forget his duty ? " Usual disposition to be kiDd !-" Rubbish, bosh, humbug > The P.M., like roost gentlemen, feels that justice knows no kindness, auy more than, there is friend- sliip in business. I quite commeud the action of the euch. in the matter., ofc Mjs. Hume's license. It was not because the good lpdy is. poor and has a large family, nor that her character was in any way other than it should be. But simply because there is uot sufficient police-protection at " The Boyd," and that " poor, lone widders is. no, sort of people to go having beer houses were meu are wot is, and that- is that some on vthein.are.duced rough"— in a lar rikin point, you see. There is already one public- house at Newton Boyd, which is said to fully meet the requirements of all parties. It is no doubt very good of your contemporary fishing for an extra s,op„ out the great drawback to the realisation of that blessed hope is that the P.M. can't see the Joe Miller of it. — Yours, &c..; TUCK;S GHOST,
