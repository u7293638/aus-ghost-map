A GHOST STORY. 'THeeER is a sleepy little place named Germani ton, near Albiry, where the inhabitants, in want of something to talk about' perhaps, . have raised a ghost of their own, and are becoming quite excited about it. The local correspondent of the Albury Mail gives the following version of the vision: On Friday night last, as a gentleman well-known here was returning to the township by a lonely road, he was greatly startled by the sudden appraranee of a man on horseback who seemed to arise out of a neighbouring dam or waterhole, and after crossing the road by which he was proceeding disappeared in a mysterious manner. The samoe unearthlyvisit antis reported to have been seen by two old residents of the district some 18 months ago, and who are prepared to vouch for the ac curacy of their statement, so much so that neither care to pass that way after nightfall. In both cases the ghostly visitant is said to Ee riding a grey cob. That some discontented spirit is dissatisfied with his mode of exit from this sublunary sphere is evident, but why bring the spirit of his horse ? Why not let the spirit of his Bueephalus rest in the happy hunting ground? But perhaps the horse wishes to gaze on the pastures where once he fed. It is said that one or two ven turesome individuals purpose. interviewing his ghostship.
