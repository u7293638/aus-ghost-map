The Enmore Mystery Un veiled. Like the Cock Lane Ghost of another cen tury and another clime, the great Enmore Mystery, when solved, turned out to be a very trumpery affair indeed. The 'mystery' in sooth, turned out to be a Miss Greaves, an undersized girl of some 12 years or so, an inmate of the very house suffering from the suppositious scientific spiritualistic stone throwing. This small prececity, Eva by name, was a State child and had evidently the bump of mischief strongly developed. It was her habit to throw a brick quietly at the doomed house, rush in, arrive almost as soon as the missile itself, and then say : ' Missus, the sperrits are at it again.' [ ] she was cute enough to perform her little seances under the very shadow of the house itself, it was some time before the machina tions of the mischievous little imp were dis covered. She did it once too often how ever, and enlightenment as to the method adopted came about in this manner. On Thursday night last Mrs. Hurcombe, who lives in No. 1 Mason's-terrace, was looking out of her window and saw someone in Mrs. McCann's yard throw a stone, and then dart back into the shadow of the house. She in formed the police, and they marked some bricks and placed them in the yard. On Friday morning when Senior-constable Meyers was watching from one of Mrs. Hur combe's rooms, he saw a small girl throw one of the bricks on to the roof of the bathroom. He ran quickly round and knocked at McCann's door, being admitted by the child herself, who coolly denied having thrown the missile when taxed by the officer. She. how ever, subsequently confessed to having done all the throwing from the commencement, saying she dreamed she had to do it. The girl, Greaves, has been taken back to the Home in Begg-street. Any ' kind lady ' wishing to adopt a brick-heaving ' medium ' has now a splendid opportunity afforded her.
