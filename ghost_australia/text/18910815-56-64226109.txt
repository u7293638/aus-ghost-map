' This b an Unekpecltd pleasure, ser geant. Id. the first place, you look very dry, and I imiat confoss thai ray own throat resembles a lime-kiln more than anything else, so let us have some claret and long sodas.' ' The invitation sounded cool and re freshing to the senses, mere especially when, as everybody knew, Dr. Brook kept imported claret and that good of its sort. ' I'll have none of that confounded Colonial rubbish. It's all very well people ?aying that you get to like it in time, but for my part I never could. Too new and heady, sir. Too new and heady.' And as the worthy man uttered these words he let down a canvas bag from the rafters of the verandah. ' Now I'll be bound you'll get no better wine than this either in or out of the colony.' He then proceeded to lift from the cool water a bottle of choice claret known as the Clidleuu 2Iargaux. The sergeant looked on, and would have preferred whisky if he had had his ohoico, but he knew that .the dector esohewed spirits in tho .Queensland cli mate as he would poison. ?

Still the fact must remain that in many cases their errors of judgment are un pnrdonable when a man is arrested on a charge of which he is wholly innocent. In their endeavors to earn for them selves praise of the world, handsome re muneration and speedy promotion, there is a tendency to overshoot the mark. Sergeant Popham had had many suc cessful coups, and in this particular in stance eomforted himself in the belief that he knew where to lay hands on the right person. It was past eleven o'clook when Pop ham rose to take his departure. ' To-morrow; then, you'll set to work, doctor, and I hope furnish us with some valuable information.' After this tho trooper sauntered through the trim little garden, with its wealth of flowering ah'rubs and plants, sending forth their aromatic fragrance on the still night air. The quiet highway which led through thickly-grown clumps of pandauus palms and bamboos, looked dreary enough as ho tramped along, sending up the fine -white dust whioh lay nukla-deep on tho foadway. ? ?
