Your Heart and Mine. We sometimes sigh and we can't tell why, And we sometimes laugh at our care. We are sometimes sad when the world is glad, And we weep when the skies are fair. There's an underflow to the joy and woe That comes with a touch divine, In the pleasure and pain, the sunshine and rain, That steals into your heart and mine. There are phantom hosts of dead hope's ghosts, And the echo of funeral bells ; There's the lasting bliss of a fadeles kiss And the pleasure our dream foretells. There the hopes entombed and the joys un- bloomed Their lilies and ivy entwine, And no one knows of the thorn and the rose That are hidden in your heart and mine.
