?LabiNe' Column. Spok'en in Anger'. 'Twas bat a little word in anger spoken, While proud eyes flashed through bitter, burnng tears ; I But oh, I felt that fatal word had broken The cord of love that bound our hearts for years. Thy tortured face, that long, wild look of sorrow, Like some pale ghost, musthaunt me while I live; And yet, how bright, how full of joy the mor row, Had I but breathed one simple word " Forgive! " I did not hear the tender voice appealing, Nor marked thy anguish, when I cried, " Depart I" Too blind to see thy pitjying glance, reveal ing The generous promptings of thynobleheart. flow could I know that faithful heart was yearnuig, Though crushed and wounded to its inmost core, To take me back, like a weary bird return ing In fear and trembling, when the storm is o'er. " Remember, love, that it may be forever; To see my face no more bynight or day. Be calm, rash heart, think well before we sever, Recall the angry word and bid me stay." SDead silence fell; the song-birds hushed their siging. "REnough," I proudly cried; "I choose my fate." While even through my maddened brain kept riaging . The death-knell of my love-tao late, too late I "Forgive, forgive I " I wailed, the wild tears streaming, As, 'mid the meaning trees, I stood alone; "Love, let thy kisses wake me from my dreaming." Thy pleading voice, thy tortured face, was gone. That angry word, I may recall it never; For o'er thy narrow grave rank weeds have grown. " Remember, love, that it may be forever.'". Ah, words prophetic I love, had I but known I My locks are gray, my eyes are dim with weepmng, The face once loved by thee, no longer fair ! Beneath the daisies thou art calmly sleep ing; There a lone woman often kneels in prayer. Ah. sweetheart mine, thou art so lowly lying, T'hou canst not hear the tearful voice above, That with the night wind evermore is sigh. iag, "I ?oke in anger; oh, forgive me, love I " -F6sny ?,wreter.
