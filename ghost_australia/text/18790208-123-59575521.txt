Mr. Freeman expressed a hope that the Bishop's arduous efforts would be rewarded with success, and that St. Lake's would be one of the most flourish ing churches in the Diocese. After the laying of the stone the Bishop gave a brief sketch of the history of St. Lake's, since his arrival in the colony, and after passing a high ecnonium on the Incumbent, he con cluded an impressive address by invoking the blessing of God on the undertaking. The rest of the ceremony included singing. and prayer, the usual offertory and bene diction. Messrs. C. Baker sen., and G. Guillanme were present, bat the Mayor of Fitzroy-who was to have spoken-was absent in the country. The anniversary tea meeting afterwards took place in the Temperance Hall, which was crowded to excess, but thanks to the exertions of Mr. Jobson and the ladies everything passed off smoothly notwithstanding the heat. A public meeting then took place, the chair being occupied by the Incumbent who called on the rev. chairman at the con clusion of a neat speech called upon the Rev. R. Barlow whose remarks on the sub ject of church architecture and his flings at some of the churches including his own not sparing St. James' Cathedral convulsed the audience. St Luke's, however (he con tinned) would bean ornament to the locality but he strongly advised them to keep out of debt as he spoke from experience. The rev. gentleman who was loudly applauded was succeeded by the Bishop who complimented his wittyspeech. Dr. Moorhouse ina stirring address, remarked that in these days. when it was asserted that the Church was losing its hold on men, no better answer could be given than the building of an edifice con secrated to the glory of God. As another instance he alluded to the building of a chapel in connection with the college at which he was educated, the young men of which contributed no less than .80.000 towards the fund. He denounced in strong terms the infidelity of modern Germany, but he predicted a glorious future for Christianity. The Bishop's address was listened to with wrapped attention, and he was loudly applauded. The Rev. H. Langley, who was well received, offered a fewremarks on Church music. The Rev. C. M. Yelland delivered a witty speech on "grumblers," and amidst much laughter he related that a member of his congregation had recently told him that his sermons were too long. whilst another had told him they were too short. The grumblers had a disposition to criticise the colonial clergymen, on the score that they were inferior to the English. Whilst speaking on the colonial article, he alluded tothe doings of " Our boys" in che cricket field, the rev. gentleman being vociferously applauded. In the course of his speech he stated the interest he felt in St. Luke's and its pastor. This concluded the business of the evening. Mr. Hope moved and Mr. Jobson seconded a vote of thanks to the Bishop and speakers, which was carried. Dr. Moorhouse returned thanks, referring humorously to the Rev. C. M. Yelland and his "grnmblers." Mr. Cooze moved and Mr. Scott seconded a vote -to the ladies. The chairman responded. During the evening the choir contributed selections of music. After the singing of the Dorology the Bishop pronounced the benediction and the proceedings were brought to a close. The new church will accommodate comfortably 500 people, who will have`lenty of air, by means of tobins, and ventilators, and the cost of the work now in hand will slightly exceed Â£3000, inclusive of seats and gasfittings.
