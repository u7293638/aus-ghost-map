THE DEFICIT AND TAXATION. TO THE KDtrOtt. Sir— Mathematics is not muoh in my line, but I should like to ask a question acd give a few riguret* that may tugge*: the working out ot an interesting problem. Does increased taxation oau«e a annnlcase in tb* revenue, or, in other words, is it pusubl* to connect the annual *hnnk»2e from many sources of State inoome wish the increase or as a result of increased taxation? Kxatnule A.— A piece of land oa North terrace has ja*t been sold for £23 per foot. The frontage, I believe, i* about 100 fees. Firs y««rs azo a would-be purrhaiw wa* n*k~d £90 per foot for thisland. Whatba- caused this treiuendou* deterioration ? Many will an*wer ''taxation.' Now wewillpresu»ielurthei-aktiof ar-ument that five year* ago this pieo* of land waa as-*f««ed as £Wptr ft. for tix*tion purpoiet. The value uow u but £23, there fore tho amount taxable is ?oiaetatng like £?-',300, as az*in*t £9.000 formerly. If, then, the taxation screw bait squt-ezed away the .-turn of £G,700 is it any wonder that a deticic is in strong evidence* Kxampla B. — A Civil servant is in receipt of £300 a year, which he spend*, £70 in rant, and £230 in livinz expense*, insurance, .fcc Item one, tb* exigencies of th* State render it nece«tary to increase th* income tax. Item two, bis salary is reduced 10 per oeofc. or 15 per oenfc. Thus we will say his income is cut down to £230 per annum by taxes and reduc tion*, consequently he spends £20 a year leis than before. Houte r*at ba« to com* down, and trade gener ally suffers, so also Cu«toins receipts. Apply this principle til round and how does it work out * Does the perpetual increase ia taxation cans* a well-cenned shrinkage in income from tbe very sources taxed? If so, how loof will it be b»for* various hem* will be taxed a wav completely, or beam* nothing but taxes? I do not presum* to effsr an opinion, butask to b* *oli«ht*a*d. I am. Sir.
