AN OPEN LETTER TO THE DELEGATES OF THE FEDERATION CONVENTION. BY HENRY COPELAND, M.L.A. Gentlemen, Now that the preliminary stages of the Conference are passed and sub-committees have retired to hatch out a Federal Constitution Bill, a few words about that "Lion in the Path" may not be out of place, because that venerable animal is sure to show out again as soon as the Committee resumes to consider the bill in detail. I may say at once that he is of the Royal Bengal species I have seen him before on several occasions and in the same place, but he is not up to much now When you face him, in fact, he is only a Bpootril lion, the more shadow of a quadruped long since gone to his fathers, though I don't dispute the fact of his having been a terrible old man-eater in his day and generation This spectral illusions gool by the name of' the " People's Ulgula", but if you now so much as prick him with a book, he will vanish into thin air. the roar of this old lion, of which we now only hear the dimmest of echoes, used to take some such, form as taxation and representation must go together, "the power of the people is the power of the pure" I would, however, ask in the name of all that is sensible, where in this free land of Australia (now that Western Australia has obtained Us Constitution) will you and any other power or even shadow of power, than the " power of the people " If every particle of political power of every conceivable form was collected from each colony of Australia and put in the crucible, where would on find, after the most careful and so-, the slightest trace of any counteracting or antagonistic power i At could not the result be power of the points" in its purest form a Why, then, all this fear of entrusting a second Federal Chambers with sensible, judicious, and rational powers of legislation? If you, as representing the people, say "we will have two Federal Chambers, and the people endorse your recommendation, will not the second Chamber by the creation of the people, equally with the first or Lower Chamber, and, being the creation of the people must not He life's breath be the voice of the people Moreover, if the people have the power to create, then, on the principle of the greater including the loss, they (the people) must also have the power of amending at any time, if found necessary, a constitution created by themselves. The days of usurping the power of the people have passed into ancient history , but, if this be not the case, pray, good delegates, be kind enough to unmask the usurper' Have some of you, unknown to the public, been guilty of secretly harbouring some crafty and unscrupulous monarch, or have you imported a batch of old-fashioned and rapacious barons? If such is not the case, and you are all, as you profess to be, loyal to the libel case of the people, then, I ask, where is this old lion to be found in the flesh í If alive, his lair must be sought for in the land of the bunyip I think, however, horn as dead as the marble man, tor in all the wide domain of Australia no power does, or ever can exist but the power of the people, fully and freely expressed You are deputed to frame a Federal Constitution for the people of Australia Then may I ask, "Why seek ye the living among the dead" For, assuredly some of your speeches appear redolent with the dead bones of King John. Why seek inspiration from the spirits of our early progenitors or search for political procedure in the dead-house of the forefathers of our nation, instead of originating for by ourself c« methods suitable to the altered circumstances of the twentieth century ' Apparently you are unanimous in approving a set and Federal Chamber, yet an opinion seems largely to prevail that second Chambers are haunted by some demoniacal agency -some invisible and lUHcrutablo power antagonistic to the welfare and interests of the people as a whole. Why then have a second Chamber ? Is it not because actual experience has taught you that, in addition to the to-doliboratlvo and revising powers of Upper Chambers they have frequently stood between the Lower Chamber and the people, and prevented busy and unwise legislation until cooler and wiser counsels prevailed It It may, on the other hand, be freely admitted that at times a second Chamber has delayed, and for the time being defeated, useful legislation, but are Lower Chambers free from all reproach ? D i they alway e represent the people i If so, then it must be sheer folly to dissolve and " go to the people " so frequently If you cannot chum absolute representation of the people for the Lower Chamber, why expect it for the U Upper Chamber i Are we to wait for Federal Australia until political institutions are discovered perfect in all their parts, and scientifically accurate in their detail workings r If so, the race will have ceased to be human, and, having become divine, will probably be "able to dispense with politics. The question is. Do we or do we not require the Bor vices of a second Chamber at critical junctures , or is it only when politics are plain sailing that we are to avail ourselves of the matured wisdom of Australia? Would any sago councillor advise his country to be exceedingly cautious about passing unimportant laws, and for that purpose to be sure and provide a second Chamber to carefully criticise, discuss and, if thought necessary, amend or perchance oven reject bills of secondary importance, butwhouthomostcriticaljunatunsarise,wbon ills affecting the most vital interests of the State are under discussion, when millions] of money are to be voted perhaps for unwise over measure, or may be taxa- tion of an inequitable character or to an unjust extent is to be levied on the moule, then, under the circumstances be sure you raise the ghost of the did Lion, and twist his tail till he gives his ancient roar deprive of your second Chamber of every vestige of power, and trust the whole issue to the Lower Chamber only It is true that Chamber may not be in complete accord, or in accord at all with the majority of the people, yet whenever the storm gathers up dangers arise, the people must shut their eyes, open their mouths, and uncouple uningly swallow what the Lower Chamber sendsrbem I would indeed and so you on these occasions but only by way of a joke to send such bills to the Upper Chamber, and allow them to be read for their edification , but, under no possible circumstance should they be allowed to interfere with those measures or amend them in anyway." I ask again, would he wise man deliberately advise his country to act in this way ' Yet, this is an accurate interpretation of the modern roar of the old spectral lion Would any captain, other than the captain of a State ship, take the precaution of pumping two. all lies of man so as to ensure the safety of his vessel as far as possible, and though he made use of both watt has in (no w other, yet as soon as bad weather threatened in the coast became dangerous, would he, I ask if in his sober tion. batten down the second watch, and so deprive himself of their services at a time when shipwreck might be imminent, especially when he know that must of those men were old, staid hands, who know every human hope in the value from the keel to the (ruck, while many of those he kept on deck had hardly learned the points of the company or know how to late a rout in the topsails. As a matter of course you all agree that money bills should only originate in the Lower Chamber r This position needs no bolstering with ancient arguments Happily, however, we have no king likely to levy troops or to go to war without tlio^iooplo'a resiDent nor have we a nobility intent on Bhuntiug all State burdens on to the shoulders of the people so that they (the privileged class) might escape their legitimate contributions Common sense, however, dic- ta tee to us that whilst all power of taxation and expenditure must emanate from the people, whether centred to a greater or less extent in either Chamber, yet the power to originate such measures could not possibly rest with two separate Chunibirant one and the same time, no matter how constituted Otherwise one Chamber might be dish using the raising of revenue by one method while the other Ch miller proposed the very reverse, and as to expenditure we should be sure to have the candle burning at both ends It is hardly necessary to say that this procedure is distinctly on forced by our Constitution Act, which provides that all such bills " shall originate in the Legislative Assembly " But having provided for their origination the Act is absolutely silent as to their subsequent treatment in either Chamber, evidently intending no further distinction to be drawn between them and other bills of an ordinary character. A similar silence loading to diverse interpretations is, however not likely to occur many bill drawn by politicians so fully alive as yourselves to the dangers of misconstrue long and an important constitutional provision, and whatever course is deluded on in this respect should, even at the expense of an additional clause, be clearly and explicitly set forth It does not follow that an apple is not wholesome fruit because it differs from an orange or that a mill won't (land equally good Hour whether driven by wind, water, steam, or electricity , and by the same reasoning, a nominee or soiri-notiuneo Chamber may equally represent the people's opinions, although not welcomed and W what happens at present to be our electoral system for choosing the members of the Lower House If two Chambers are chosen by a similar process, them in the same ratio that you oiuulmo the franchise be tween the two Chambers, so you develop the spirit of antagonism, because each man then fairly claim to equally represent the opinions of the people If the elective system is adopted for the second Ck miliar, as well as the first, then the question arises whether it would not be better to have three Chambers than two, as in that case the Lower House would be pretty sure to have one of the others In accord and the majority would rule Yon can, however, secure all the good possible or desirable to be obtained from a second Chunibi r, by adopting a nominee system for however paradoxical It may appear to some its comparative weakness, while giving it strength enough for good, will prevent it roasting too frequently the more powerful Chamber, and Its independence of temporary, social, and political ex- statements will prove a tower of strength in the people's best interests. If then such a chamber is to be really useful when most needed, it should clearly have the power of a first amendment or re- jection If these powers should be exercised in such a manner that the Lower Chamber could not acquiesce, and yet deemed the passing of the measure as of vital importance, a special session could be immediately summoned to deal with that particular bill, which could again be passed through the ordinary stages in both Houses, and if again refused by the Upper Cham- ber, both Houses should sit together and lot The majority of the combined Chambers decide the whole question Of course, there in nothing new in this suggestion, but I have always thought it the most simple and practical method of avoiding a deadlock There is no great need for an appeal to the country, for whether the country is in favour or against that particular proposal of the Lower Chamber, the people have a clear, ringing voice in the areas, through which' they will soon make themselves heard, and in any case the policy could be reversed at the next general election in conclusion, your humble servant has every confl doHoe that you will provide us with a Constitution clean out and rigid in its definition, but with provisions so elastic that without rapture it can be expanded or contracted from time to time by the developed will of the people, and your names will then remain for over green in our history.
