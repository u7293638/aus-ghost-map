SELECTED POETRY. THE WAY OF THE WORLD. There sate a crow on a lotty tree, ' Watching the world go by: He saw a throng that swept along With laughter loud and high. " In and ont through the motley rout" â€¢ Pale ghosts stole on unseen; Their hearts were longing for one sweet word Of the lovethat once had been, Bnt never a lip there spoke their names, Never a tear was shed: The crow looked down from his Ioftv free, "'lie the way of the world," he said. A singer stood in the market-pi ice, .Singing a tender lay, Bnt no one heeded his sorrow!ul.faee, . No one bad time to stay. He turned away; he sang no more; How could he sing.in vain ? And then the world came to his door, Bidding Mm sing again, But he recked not whether they came or went, He in bis garret dead. The crow looked down from his lofty tree, " 'lis the way of the world," he said. There sate a Queen by a cottage bed, Spoke to the widow there; Did she not know the same hard blow The peasant had to bear? And she kissed that humble peasant's brow, And then she bent her knee: " God of the widow, help her. now, . As thon hast helped me." " Now God be than* ed,'-' said the old, old crow. . As he sped from his lofty bough; "The times are ill, but there's much good still In the way of the world, I trow."
