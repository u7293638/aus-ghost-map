AQUATICS Intercolonial ROWING. FOUR-OAR AND SCULLING CHAMPIONSHIPS. SLACK WINS EASILY. SYDNEY, May 24. (By Telegraph from our Correspondent.) A more miserably disheartening day for the aquatic intercolonial championship events could hardly be imagined than yesterday. A strong southerly gale; -accompanied by showers of "sleet, blew .with great violence all the after noon, and made racing, both hazardous and .unpleasant . In the first event—the, Champion Fours—the three crews ranged themselves at the starting point, The Brothers. :The course was two and a-quarter miles, upon the Parramatta, River, and great regret was expressed at the non-participation of. Queensland in the event, owing to the Inability of; that colony to procure a suitable boat'in; Sydney. Victoria -p^it a splendid. crew out, who, it was thought,, would in fine, weather hold: the race in' the palm of their hand; but it was felt• that, pro-' bably> the -strong -windI send -choppy sea would give New Zealand an opportunity ; to snatch a win,, under conditions suited to the great weight and strength of the crew. The New South Wales crew had only practised together during the week, and so It was felt that they had not the ghost of • a . -chance, and this surmise proved to be correct. The race was started half-an-hour late, New Zealand being on the northern shore, New South Wales in the middle, and Victoria on the southern shore, the latter gaining a material advantage from its position. The crews got well away, Victoria strik ing forty-five strokes to the minute, New- South Wales forty-three, and New Zea land forty-four. They all got the wash of the ferry steamer, but then Victoria began to forge ahead, and at Abbotsford led from New Zealand by half- a-lehgth, and New South Wales by a full length. Approaching Gladesville the force of the wind began to be felt, and the New" Zea land crew made up a little of their lost ground. The wind drove the two crews towards the wharf,- and the-New-Zea- landers held, up a hand as a protest,' which, however, was not sustained, a-1-o though :the oars: of the two boats actually touched. The rough water -tested the' endurance of the crews across to! Hen and Chickens Bay, and the Victorians showed a tendency to roll.' The New* Zealanders pressed them hard here; but••-. Sloane called upon his men, and they; in- • c£gSpd^eh^e*a to a length. The eflfoftsjof th« Newr;Zealanders here began to tell^on tbenvKof J and No. 3 especially being -dißfresßed.:.: 3They, however, Kept on xnanfuMy t ;butjffhe Victorians, with the rmoe.well in hand, just kept a lead of a JS?^Sri tIM ;'neinrtn« the winning post, 1""1*1 three lengths ahead ? f wrZealandi New South Wales being 32%a©5^^^ lX^ Ind- Tlme ' iSa^a' and \EtepKnjfta^ s fWcforia). - Sla^^dii^/.iiffp. disposition, on the l!^ YW^-ti^Wfi^^f>^:Poweir^;and- M'€o^^ i,-^a^i^vxir<>aiß : in-the- Qrder* named to the southern shore,, the latter being on the southern side;,..' .The bet ting was 5 to 4 and even money against Blapk, and 6^0,4, y.
