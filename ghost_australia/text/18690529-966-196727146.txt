A DREAM OF THE SOUTH WIND. [BY PAUL H. HATNELJ O fresh, how fresh and fair. Through the crystal gulfs of air. The fairy South Wind floated on the subtle wings of balm; And the green earth lapped in bliss. To the magic of her kiss, Seems yearning upward fondly through the golden* crested calm! From the distant tropics strand. Where the billows bright and bland. Go creeping, curling round the palms with sweet; faint undertone. From its fields of purpling flowers, Still wet with flagrant showers, The happy South Wind lingering sweeps, the royal bloomB of June. All heavenly fancies rise On the perfume of her sighs, Which steep the inmost spirit in a langour rare and fine. And a peace more pure than sleep's Unto dim half-unconscious deeps. Transports me, lulled and dreaming; on its twilight tides divine. Those dreamB; ah me! the splendour; So mystic clear and tender, Wherewith like soft heat lightningB they gird their meaning round. And those waters calling, calling, With a nameless charm enthralling, Like the ghost of music melting on a talldmr spray of sound! Touch, touch me not, nor wake me, Lest grosser thoughts o'ertake met For earth receding faintly with her dreary dins ami m jars, What viewless arms caress me, What whispered voices bless me. With welcome dropping dew-like from the Â«(U and wondrous 6tais! Alas! dim, dim, and dimmer Grows the preternatural glimmer Of that trance the South Wind brought me (in her subtle wings of balm; For behold its spirit flietb. And its fairy murmur dieth. As the silence closing round me in a doll soundless calm!
