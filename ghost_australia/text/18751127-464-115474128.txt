ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS: ' T. M.,' East Maitland, asks—' la ifc legal for lessee, owner, and occupier to vote for one and the same property, in the election of alder men ?' Section 52 of Municipalities Aot de olares that ' every person of the full age of twenty -one years who, on the 7th day of January in any year, shall be the occupier, lessee, or owner of any rateable property within any municipality, and liable to he rated for the same, shall be entitled to be enrolled. . . as an elector thereof.' An explanatory note dis tinguishes between the right to be enrolled as an elector and the right to vote. This note reads as follows: — 'Three persona may be ' liable' for the rates of one property — an occupier, a lessee, and the owner. Either of these may pay the rates, and by such payment, beoome entitled to vote. The names of all three, therefore, should be on the roll.' It will be seen that whichever one of the three who pays the rates — and lie only — is entitled to vote. ' Veritas.'— Your letter on ' Fisher's Ghost' will appear in oui- next issue.
