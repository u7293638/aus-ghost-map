The greatest drawback here will arise from the heavy currents which are certain to occur during the spring months when :. the accumulated snows will melt and rushing down the precipitous sides of the ranges into the narrow gorge through which the river forces its way, will scarcely leave a vestage of water-race flume, or dam. The vast quantities of driftwood hurled and jammed together on the upper portion of the river, give ample evidence of the volume and force of those tremendous vernal floods. There is one peculiar feature in the whole of these mountainous ranges; as a rule, there is scarcely a single living trea of any size, say from twelve inches and upwards - whitened by the wintry storms, they present one vast dreary scene of naked desolation, the very ghosts and skeletons of the old forest rings, many of them from three to five feet in diameter. The reason adduced for this general and premature check to forest life, is the supposition, that the baneful effects resulting from the wide spread conflagrations of 'Black Thurs day,' killed, at one fell swoop the entire vegetation of these upper regions. In the absence of any positive proof of the accuracy of the above supposition I may state, that there are now rapidly growing up whole forests of young sap lings, many of them sixty and seventy feet high, few of them having a diameter of more than six inches at the butt. Twelve years of vigorous growth would carry them up their present size dating their birth from 1851, the period at which their sires are suppose to have succumbed to the fiery devastation of that memorable day.
