mARTlAL SONG. Pshaw ! Tears in my eyes at tho sound of your music! 1 soit as a girl when' I stood like a rock, And the battle waves broke, and in fire and smoke My regiment reeled, but was brave in the shock 1 . Ah 1 the old days, the, fierce days, the days when I lived, How they troop back like phantoms as you minstrels play The struma of the march, the songs of the camp-ground. The wild, Bweet staccatos that led to the fray I. Pshaw 1 I'm ashamed, boys 1 But yet my eyes blur. I'm back in my twenties ; I'm fearless apd strong ! There's nothing can daunt me ; there's no thing to haunt me ; : I ride like the wind, lilte the lilt of yonr soug. Ah 1 the brave days, the blithe days, the days when I lived ! They throng here again, all alive, as you 'play. It is I am the ghost, the wan, weary sur vivor, i Of scenes that were r' 'ono grand bygone I , day.
