REVIVAL MISSION AT ASHFIELD. We are pleased to be able to report good news from the Ashfield Circuit. For some time past special services have been carried on in different parts of the circuit, Lewis ham leading the way, and Summer Hill, Moorfields, and Canterbury following later on, in every place most blessed results being vouchsafed. On Simday, August 6th the mission at Ashfield began (prepartory meetings having been held during the week previous). All day a very gracious in fluence was felt but the outward manifesta tions began when at the evening service ten persons decided for Christ. Every evening during the week souls were saved and the power of the Holy Ghost to convince and convert was gloriously displayed. Each afternoon a bible reading was given in the School Hall and they were well apprecia ted. An open-air service was held every night followed by a torchlight procession to the church. The mission closed on Sunday, 13th instant, when again ten more came forward making a total of fifty for the week. On Tuesday evening a thanks giving service was held in the church, there was a large attendance and what was better still the presence of God was power fully realised. When the opportunity was given for testimony upwards of sixty persons spoke in less than half and hour. It was a delightful meeting. We are all devoutly thankful to God to whom be all the praise for the blessed results of the mission and we are now looking forward to further ' showers of blessing ' at Croydon and Oroydon Park.
