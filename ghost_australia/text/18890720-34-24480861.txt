FARMERS AND SEED WHEAT. TO THE EDITOR. Sirâ€” Mr. Jenkin Coles professes to be astonished that the present Government have not granted assistance to the farmers in the shape of a loan of seed wheat. In the dis- tiiota requiring seed wheat it is ntnal to sow in February or March, and no sane man would think of towing in the middle of July. I oDoe finished sowing in June, and although the crop averaged 10 bushels the part sown in June was not worth reaping, and a similar result would follow thia season with land sown in July. I may aay that owing to crops tailing three yean in sueoeuioD, and being hunted in a bailiff-like manner by the late Commissioner of Crown Lands, this season I have not sown a grain; yet with ?0 acres of fallow, should the piesent Government offer me the loan of the seed, I would not accept it, v it would be a waste to put it in tbe ground. Thw Mr. .Coles well knows, but it suits him to appear to think otherwise. Speaking in the no eon fideace debate the hon.lgentteman stated that in no ease had be treated selectors harshly; yet strange t> aay the name of Coles k thoroughly detested in the northern areas, and 1 trurt the time will never again arrive which will place tbe power of eviction in the bauds of one ao cruel and hard-hearted. I noticed the hon. gentleman, wishing to appear funny, quoted poetry at the expense of Mr. Borgoyne.
