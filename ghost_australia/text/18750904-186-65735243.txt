I gave an nnlnmted order on the larder, and a set of spoons that had served us as Ikitbfally as Eaty; and then, with a sinking heart, went to csrrr the news and the tontation to mother. 'Ton ought to he ashamed of yourself to en CDGrage the child in such folly! Tod are old enough to know better, if she isn't. Send Eaty tome. ITl atop ber nonsense !' was the pleasant reception tint awsited the story that had been ?o&ened; and cushioned to meet the occasion. Sot when was wise cuuzjsel ever taken, of vhen did intermeddline Brail in » Ion ?Siir? Certainly not this time, for at the hour appointed we crossed the street to St. Uary*s and found the bridal party in » dimly lighted passage in Hie rear of the church, awaiting the convenience of Father Boooey, who, as informed by the sexton, 'was harm' dinnereompany.andeoaldn't come to wanst,' and we bided his time. I looked aratmd at my eompainone. Here -wai Katy-s mother, a atalwart bjabwoman, dad in the blanket-shawl and alpaca hood dear to the Illlllliiii 1 of Erin. 8he was offering good advice to a. friend soflermg from ' cowU,** and giving tin mis tor making a posset, which she called -fte fey.' As it was Un. Brice'e panacea for moat bodily Ha, and had been advised for my taking many Can, I recognised the QVfanhle ?ffy'!*1?''' -s white whey. Eaty herself waa bright and neat ma gram ?bdrdnss that bad been dedicated to 8t Patrick ? few months henre.

The parlr of the first part was aittine; in a dar- eomer with two or three of his friends, and I could not make him out dearly ontfl we were summoned to owati me nvereoee at thealtar, and it was too late to match Esty from ber doom. He was by no -means ft'yonng 'boy,' bang at least fifteen years beyond oar twenly tbree-year-old Xjsty. fie was coarse and stapni and ahameftced, wiih his bair plsstered no«n almost to bis red^immed, sheepish eyes, and' wilh an upper lip so abort that his teeth were always on «aew. fndeed, in every way altoeetbor a bad subject. I looted on and listened fa a half-dazed way to the very brief service thatgeve Katy her sentence fcr life. Once before I had witnessed a mirriage in St. MjtnV Then it was a — **— ' of d«y-*%bt and candles, flowen and ineeaee, gorgeoas vestmente and many priests and much ceremony.

Itwas not only the ebmge, bat the eharacter of it, that shocked me. Die besntuul hair, that seems to thrive best trader nepleet — the wavy glossy l-i«h hair, so long and abundant— was uncombed sad twisted in s rauhballoa the bit* of her neck, with locks straggling to ber wAt Bot worse than jlleUe was the perviitngand reekleai ntnjduiess ofher dr.-sssnd person. Xbe inevitable hbnketrdiswl was'eecored by a hairpin, and the whole toilet unshedoffabyaeoBed woiOenhoed. Father fiooa«y*a dhmb nuptial wish bad been fr'filV*, and Ejtty's misery was crowned with a baby in every way a repetitio-i of its mother's unwhole someoess and eonalor. Before £ could give ex pression to my astonishment, Katy's sweet voice, whirh had alone escaped the mnenl wreck, broke in with, ' An ' how have ye been since, Ifisi Marr ?' 'Ton msy well say ' since;1 you poor child, for yon look as if every thing cone before might be blotted oat,' said L ' And now teU me the trouble.' ' Well, ye see, miss, Jerry is out of wo*, because of the strikes an' he hive been mostly since. Hen are so wake, ye know, miss !

I took the baby with a, shudder I etmU scarcely bide, and seating its mother in the big Shaker chair, called for something to strengthen and revive the poor girl, making an effort at tbe same time to turn bermind from bertrouMes ' What is the baby's name, Esty?' E asked. -Auastssis. Do von like it, IGasKary? I wanted to call ber for you, but, ye see, sbe fell on St. Anastauaa's Day, an' Father Barney said UwouU bring her good leek. Poorbaby!

I don't think IK means to be bad; but men can't bear double.'
