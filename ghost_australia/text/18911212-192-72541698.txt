Cricket. The Agricultural College Club met the Sackville players in Windsor on Saturday last, and received a crushing defeat. From the start it was evident they were over* matched, but, nevertheless, the College boys took their gruel splendidly and pegged away with dogged persistence when they hadn't a ghost's show of winning. The aboriginal, Barber, for Sackville team, exhibited good form behind the wickets. He is a clever wicket-keeper-too clever in fact, for in one case at least he whipped the bails off before the ball reached the wicket, and appealed. The umpire, falling a victim to the darkey's outeness, gave the batsman out. Scores: SACKVILLE.
