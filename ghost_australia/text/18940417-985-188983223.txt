HOW THE PREMIER WAS KNIGHTED. The following is an extract from an interesting character sketch of the Premier written by J. Tigbe Ryan for the Review of Re views :â€”" I can only give a weak description of his interviews with the Queen. Lord Knutsford pre sented him to Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace, where he had the honor of answering her many inquiries about the people of Aus tralia. She introduced him to one of her daughters. The Queen, be ing in mourning, wore a plain black dress. Sir George was charmed with her simple manners. ' I afterwards went to the Isle of Wight,' he said, 'and drove with Lord Knutsford to the palace in the royal carriage. Lord Knuts ford announced me to Her Majesty. I went down on one knee, and she asked General Byng for his sword. He offered her the uniform dress sword, but she requested him to present his own sword instead. She then took the sword, and, touching my head and shoulder, said," In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, arise Sir George Dibbs." She then invested me with the gold collar, and handed me the star. The ceremony over, I had another conversation with Her Majesty. Finally, I kissed her hand bowed out of the room.' "
