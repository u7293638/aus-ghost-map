" Coinu or Rh quasas.-The August sitting lof the Launceston Court of Re quests will be opened at the Court House, Patterson-street, at 10 a.m. to-morrow, before his Honor Mr. Commissioner White foord. There are no less than 257 cases et down for hearing, besides a number of defendedo cases adjourned from the last Court.. It is anticipated thiat at least two days will be occupled in disposing of the list. The unusual number of cases is a "sign of the times," and anything but a desirable one. . Recsrvan.-The Church News for August is to hand. It contains a good variety of reading matter. .The leading article refers to the approaching meeting of the Church Society at Launceston. Amongst : other papers is one on the Rev. H. B. Bromby's trip to Europe, also,a report of the presen tation of an address, accompanied by a' watch, to the Rev. Robert Henry Cole, assistant curate of Holy Trinity Church, Launceston.-The Catholic Standard for the current month contains a full account of the death and obsequies of the late Rev. Joseph Basil Roper, the first Tasmanian born priest of the Roman Catholic Com munion. The leading article treats of the Tasmanian Royal Commission on Educa tion. As usual there is a good budget of original and extract matter, including as usual another shy at Freemasonry, which seems to be the bets foir of the compilers of this particular journal.-We have also received the first number of the Pioneer, a small monthly periodical devoted to religious and gospel temperance matter, but under whose auspices is not stated. BsEACONSFIELD '-BANK ROBBERY. - This morning the men now under arrest on suspicion' of being implicated in the late robbery at the Beaconsfield Bank will be brought before Mr. A. K. Chapman, Stipendiary Magistrate, at the Police Court, Beaconsfield, when a remand until Friday will probably be asked- for by the I prosecution, on the ground that Mr. R. B. SMiller is unavoidably prevented by other engagements from attending to conduct the case on behalf of the Bank of Tas Smania. This will, we understand, be opposed by Mr., W. Croft, who is retained for O'Keefe, his contention being that it is an act of injustice to the prisoners to detain I them in custody for so long aperiod without trial. Richard Collins and his son will Sappear pro foerma to answer to their bail and will be discharged. Oua VOLrVNTEErs.-Lieut.-Col. Legge Swill arrive from Hobart by the express train to-day, for the purpose of inspecting the northern regiments. He will inspect Sthe Launceston Volunteer Artillery Corps this eveningat 8 o'clock, and the?'Launceston Volunteer Rifle Regiment to-morroweven ing at the same hour. The notice given has been rather short, the first intimation of Col. Legge's visit only being received in town on Saturday, and though the Artillery Corps are generally ready for duty, it is not always easy or possible for volunteer Scorps to arrange for a full muster on such short intimation, as of course other ar rangements have often to be considered. \- Both the Artillery Corps and the Rifle SRegiment will appear in full dress. We understand that the Government is in com munication with Mr. W. Barnes,'' of I Trevallysi, in the hope of securing a site upon that estate for a rifle range, but nothinghasyet been settled. SUNDAY EvaENxNO Lecruass. - The Rev. W. Law continued. his. course of Sunday evening' lectures - yester day at :Prince's Square Congrega tional Church, when the' subject was .Â¶Mount Olivet," '?the text being taken from II. Samuel, xv, 80. Mr. Law gave a graphic' description of the mount, and it grand situation, overlooking the entire city of Jerusalem. David did penance for his past sins, and chiefly the sin of placing Uriah in the front of the battle, and causing his death, by going bareheaded, and with bare feet up this mountain. He dealt at. length with David's. trouble through life, especially with his sons. Our Saviour's weariness, on the mountain was then reviewed, and the lecturer said the mount had three summits, on one of which was now builta monastery, which wassup posed to be the spot where Christ wept over the city. Another of the summits was called: the "mount of Offence," be cause it was there that Solomon had built a heathen temple forhis manywives. It was on that mount that Christ gave a de scription to His disciples of His second; coming. The church was well filled, and the lecture, which was highly interesting, was listened to with attention. VAccNTIvroN.-A correspondent writes:' -At the last sitting of the Deloraino Police Court, the principal business set down for hearing. was a number of cases against parents for neglecting to have their children vaccinated. Several infor mations .were heard, those 'who pleaded guilty being fined, ls with ,2s 6d costs. Several cases were adjourned for a fort night in' order to get the opinion of the Attorney-General theleon; the parents pleading not guilty, as the children were over twelve months old. About thirty summonses were issued; andit is said that' there are about ;100 more parents to be proceeded against on the same charge.,: I believe that the Government Vaccinator was in attendance at the P-blid Buildings, Launceston, last Wednesday, and that the names of 9110 infants were down as not: being vaccinated, and out of this number there was but one taken to the Government' official. CONCEiT. AT .LoNoGFORD.-Our corres iondent writes:,- - The grand concert at which Mrs. Leonard made.her farewell ap pearance to a Longford audience came off on Friday evening in the Assembly Room, and was fairly patronised; most of the front seats were occupied, the back ones only 'not being as well filled: as upon the last occasion. A number of pot plants and ferns, kindly lent by Dr. Appleyard, were placed on the platforms andI con nveyed a faint idea of the Palace Garden scene in the rendering of the operetta. The following progrismme was submitted: -=-Part 1-Instrumental solo, Mr. C. :H. King; duet, "The Sailor, sighs," Mrs. Leonard and Mr. Latheam song, "Love never dies," Mr. F.. Higgins; song, "Tell me my heart," Mrs. W. A. Anderson ; violin solo, Mr. C. H. King song, "When the tide , comes ,in," Mrs. Leonard song, "The Owl," Mr. F. Higgins ; duet; "When shall we Meet," Mrs. W. A. Anderson and Mrs. Leonard. Part 2.-Balfe's charming operetta, "The Sleeping Queen." The Queen of Leon, Mrs.; W'. A. Anderson; Donna Agnes (maid of honour), Mrs. Leonard; Don Phillips (a 'soldier of fortune), Mr. Latham ; the Regent, Mr. F. Higgins. The performers were loudly applauded throughout the evening, aind in the first part frequently encored, especially with the duet, "When shall we Meet;" the audience almost persisting in a repetition. As, however, time would not permit, and it was necessary to reserve voice for the operetta, no encores were responded to, thei compliment in each case being acknow ledged with a graceful bow. Toe LANDns OFce.- Mr. C. P. Sprent, the Deputy Commissioner of Crown Lands, was in attendance at the Public Buildings on Saturday till 1 p.m., but the business brought imder his notice was merely of a departmental nature. Mr. Sprenout returned to Hobart by the express train in the after' n . M. C.

Arthur, Esq., of iNorley Cottage, Longford (who died on Tudeday last), took place this afternoon, leaving the late residence of deceased at half-past throe o'clock, and was one of the largest which has taken place here for a considerable time. The chief mourners, hon. Thos. Reibey, Rev. C. R. 'Arthur, and Messrs. T. K. Arthur and Gee. H. Arthur, walked abreast next the hiearse, the pall bearers being the hen. W. Dodory, Adys Douglas, M.H.A., W. H> D. Archer, M.H.A., Joseph Archer, J; D. Toosey, and 'H. R. Dumarcsq, Esqs. I also noticed in the coerege the hon. F. W. 'Grubb, Revs. J. M. Norman (Cressy), E. P. ;Xdams (Hagley), A. Barkway (Launceston), A. Chambers (Evandale), Drs. Appleyard and Mason, Messrs. D. Archer, T. C. Archer, A. Whitfeld, 'R. J. Archer, 'H. Gatenby, J:H. Stewart, C. B.

Wilmore, Alfred Youl, R. Horne, R. H. Douglas, E. Whitfeld, and others. The incumbent of Christ Church (Rev. A. Wayn) conducted the burial service, the church being nearly filled. Hymns No. 328, "A few more years shall roll," and No; 479, " On the resurreition morning," from Church hymns were sung, by the choir; Miss E. Wayn presiding at the organ. After leaving the chnrch the coffin, Which was covered with wreaths, etc., of flowers, was deposited in tie family vault in the churchyard, making the sixth, the last placed thero containing the re mains of Mr. John Lake Allen Arthur, who died April 26, 1877, aged 30. The funeral was conducted by Mr. John Wright. In additionuto the offices held by the deceased (mentioned in Wednesday's issue), I find that girovious to Mr. Arthur's coming to Longford he was police magistrate at New Norfolk; he was also to the time of his death a Commissioner of the Suprepse Court of Tasmania for this district, and one of tie old trustees of Christ's College, Bishopebourne, who assisted by the management of the finances Ito free that institution from the debt incurred in its working. Deceased also, with Col. Home, took an interest in the volunteer movement about 1860, holding the position of Captain of the Longford Volunteer Rifle Corps from its fotmation to its disbandment in 1864 (the late F. B. Watson being Lieutenant). Mr. Arthur also at various intervals, ex ,tending over as 'number of years; held the office of churchwarden at Christ Church, finally retiring at the' end of last year, when his son, Mr. Gee. Arthur, was chosen as his successor. Mr. Albert F. Arthur, I am informed, is a -Lieutenant on H.M.S. Albatross, at present onithe Chinastation. 3 TAE LAD GowLAND.-IUpon, enquiry at i theHospital last evening welear nt that, the lad Gowland was making favuxrable progress. The eruptive disease from which he is suffering has now reached the a stage at which its true nature may be I better diagnosed, and Dr. Thompson has 3 invited the whole of the honorary medical Sofficers of the institution to a consultation, which it is to be hoped will enable some Sdefinite opinion to be pronounced. It will \- be remembered that when Mr. Barker was 3 attacked with an unknown eruptive 1 disease, which in his case proved fatal, Safter his return from Launcoston to Mel 1 bourne, it was suggested that the disease Smight .' be one which is known amongst 1 persons in hides and skins warehouses in l England, which is considered peculiar to the trade. It appears that the father of Sthe lad Gowlannd is, like Mr. Barker, a Sdealer in hides and skins, and it is sug 'gested that the lad may be suffering from a similar form of eruptive disease to that s of Mr. Barker. S PosrolSES IN TE TAsAR.a.-A consider able amount of excitement was created 1 abodt 11 a.m. yesterday by the unexpected 3 appearance of a shoal of porpoises near the i Queen's Wharf.

Mr. R.. Marshall, then gave a read ing from the Life of J.. B. Gough,'".and supplemented : the 'reading. with a few remarks on .the- victims, to drink in our midst. Mr; 'A: 3, Scott then sang "Help the fallen brother," the choir.taking up the chorus. - Mr. Hisedox,, a visitor from Ade laide, then addressed the meeting on "Little beginnings," saying it was' the first start in 'drinking which led to a man's ruin.

Susman and Company's furnishing warehouse were thrown open for the first time to the public, and from that time until the hour of clos ing (10 pan.) 'a coitinuouis stream of visitors thronged the spacious show rooms, which were brilliantly lighted up; The display made surprised many of the visitors, and general expressions of com mendation were heard on the enterprise of the firm inintroducing this new line of business, the general opinion apparently being that it would supply a public want, and deserved to meet with success. A WHALE SToav.-From a contemporary we learn that " a recent number of the John o'Groat's Journal, a newspaper pub lislied in' the north 'of Scotland, asserts that a huge whale, 62ft. long and 72 tons weight, was captured'in June of last year, at the entrance of Behring's Straits, with one of the Henty's Portland harpoons stuck' in it. The wound caused by the weapon had healed, that is, a cartilage had grown round the harpoon,and sheathed and prevented it from penetrating any further, and the weapon bore the following brand:-'Henty L 18388' the L probably standing for Launceston, where the Hentys had a number of harpoons made." It was about the time mentioned as the date of the making of the harpoon that Messrs.

NATIONAL WATER. SCHEME.-As our readers 'aoe\aware, tlie highly imnportant subject of a National Water: Scheme for the north-eastern districts, which has fre quently been mooted, has recently been warmly taken up by residents of the localities interested, and the delegates ap pointed'at a public meeting recently held at Branxholm arrived in town a few days ago to endeavour to enlist the support of Launceston residents and others in the proposed scheme. A public meeting will be called at an early date, when the matter will be fully gone into and explained, and as it is one which, if it can be carried into practical effect, will mark a new era in the history of tin mining in: the north-eastern districts, 'we hope that it will receive hearty support, and the fullest enquiry into its feasibility and the probable cost of such undertaking made. The proposals which the delegates are advocating are to ask the Government to expend a sum of Â£50,000 for the purpose of cutting a large race from the river at Upper 3ingarooma to near Boobyalla Port, for the purposo of working the stanniferous deposits along its course, and we are credibly insformed that applications for water will far exceed numerically the number stated in the peti tion to Parliament. LAUNCESTON BICYCLE CLUB. - This club enjoyed a run on Saturday afternoon, Corra Linn being the place visited, but which was only reached after much jostling with rocks, loose metal, newly made roads without metal, which necessitated several dismounts and re-mounts. Every man had to keep well on the alert to keep his gravity, but the beautiful scenery along the road, and the view off Corra Linn Bridge well repaid the members. The following members put in an appearance :-Messrs. W. G. Cox (capt.), J. Dwyer, J. V. Porter, A. J. and R. Scott. The start was made at 2.35 p.m., Corra Linn being reached at 3.40 p.m., and after 15 minutes breathing time town was again reached at 5 o'clock, after a rather tough but pleasant journey.

THE HAwTHoRN SOANDAL.--The. Mel bourne correspondent of a Bendigo paper thus refers to a scandal which 'has been freely referred to by Victorian journals, though the names of the parties have hitherto been suppressede:- "For some little time past the people of Haw thorn have been talking about Mr. Arthur Manton, a solicitor, in connection with a serious charge, which it was alleged would be preferred against him by Florence Lymer, a domestic servant in his employ. The case was called on at the local Yolice Court this morning, but the girl withdrew the charge. Mr. Puryes, who appeared for the defence, said itwas a pity that the girl could not be forced to go on, in order that her statements might be disproved. Mr. Manton, on his part, wished the very fullest investigation to be made into the matter." ". THE BAD AND WORnTILEss are never imitated or counterfeited.. This is espe cially true of a family medicine, and it is positive proof that the remedy imitated is of the highest value. As soon as it had been tested and proved by the whole world that Hop Bitters was the purest, best, and most valuable family medicine on earth, many imitations sprung up and began to steal the notices in which the Press and the people of the country had expressed the merits of H. B., and in every way trying to indiuce suffering invalids to use their stuff instead, expecting to make money on the credit and good name of H. B. Many others started nostrums put up in similar style to H. B., with variously devised names in which the word "Hop" or "Hops" were used in a way to induce people to believe they were the same as Hop Bitters. All such pretended remedies or cures, no matter what their style or name is, and especially those with the word "Hop" or "Hops" in their name orin any way connected with them or their name, are imitations or counterfeits. Beware of them. Touch none of them. Use nothing but genuine American Hop Bitters, with a bunch or cluster of green Hops on the white label, and Dr. Soule's name blown in the glass. Trust nothing else. Druggists and chemists are warned against dealing in imitations or counter feite. ITiiit LAia, Ms. E.

The : andigpd Independent is a leading article declare that "atax on food isan iniquitous thing, and such is the StockTax,"andstigmatises it as "shortsighted" and vexatious. "It is" says our Victoria contemporary, "on' a small scale a revival of the odious, ad tyrannical English Corn Law, the thin end of the wedge, which, if its operation 'be tolerated, will open the way hereafter for a general taxation.of the necessaries of the many in the interests of the few. And the Legistature could not have struck, on. an article which should be freer from tax ation than beef and mntton; what wheaten bread is to the Englishman, and rice to the Hindoo, so are they to the Anglo-Aus tralian. 'Hands off our necessaries' should be the unanimous and stern com mand of the people; they cannot affoid them to be trifled with by legistators : for, as the Corn Law hero, John Bright, warned the Sydney protectionists a few months ago, once an impost is inflicted it is easier to increase than remove it. Governments are often moved by the ear wigging of small, compact and active sections of .the public, to perform actions which are to the detriment of the greait simple mass of the outside public." SA DIsoRAcEron Pe'OCEEDING.-An item of Cainadian news to hand by the last mail states there was great excitement at Oak Creek recently' over the action of the relatives of Horace Baldwin, in sawing off his legs after his 'death to niake them fit the coffin. Baldwin was 6 feet 7 inches in height, and when the day for his funeral had come it was found that his body was too long for the coffin. His nephew com menced to sever his feet from his body with a. common saw. While at work he thought Baldwin' moved, and he.fell in a dead faint, when another relation finished cutting off the limbs. At one time, soon after the funeral, it was thought that the the' nephew would be mobbed by the neighbours.

The adoption of this advice would be conducivd to happiness in house holds now divided on the smoke question. I always pity, those unfortunate smokers in homes where their pipes are as un welcome as small-pox to the citizen of Mel bourn. SAFETY MATCH . QuesTeiO.-There has recently beensome littleagitation amongst the Victorian shire councils and other public bodies in favour of prohibiting the importation of all matches except those manufactured on the "safety" and "light. ing' only on the box" principle. The Government was memorialised to that effect.
