NEW CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH, BURWOOD. ON Tuesday, the foundation stone of a new church was laid at Burwood. The ceremony was commenced by sing- ing Dr Watts's hymn, " Come, let us join our cheerful songs with angels round the throne," &c; Afterwards a selection from the Sacred Scriptures was read by the Rev J E Vetch. The Rev William Slatyer offered up prayer. The resident minister, the Rev G G Howden, then made a statement respecting the services hitherto carried on for several years in the old building and tho necessity that existed tor enlarged accommodation. The land, he said, in part had been kindly presented by Mr Hilly the architect, and another portion had been purchased. Mr Howden then read tho following - " This document, with copies of the Sydney daily news- papers, is placed beneath the foundation stone of the Congregational Church, Burwood. This church is erected to accommodate those who are worshipping in a building on the Parramatta Road, but which building is found to be neither sufficiently large nor central in situation. The members of the church were first united in church fellow- ship on March 17th, 1864. The number of members was then nine. At the present date it is thirty-five. The pre- sent minister, the Rev G G Howden, is the first settled pastor over the church, and has been connected with the congregation since January, 1864. The foundation stone of the new building is laid by John Fairfax, Esq. Com- mittee of management-Messrs D Alderton, Drynan, A Garran, and Roche; secretary, Mr John Bubb, trea- surer Mr John Row, trustees, Messrs J R Fairfax, A Fairfax, J Row, D Vernon, T H Henderson, G Butterfield; architect, Mr T Rowe ; contractor, Mr F Lavers.

The plan is an oblong in shape 50 foot by 33 feet 6 inches entered from two porches in the front, and a large vestry (22 feet by 13 feet) for the minister in the rear.

The entrance end will présent two porches, with moulded jambs, coloured vouissoirs, and libels on corbels carved, the crowned with moulded coping on kneelers, moulded with trefoils above. The effect of the church from the Railway Station especially and from other parts, will be very picturesque.
