ABOUT THE BRITISH MUSEUM:. (From the Daily Telegraph.) If anybody, from the ghost of John Philip de Lorme downwards, could tell where the British Constitution began whether in Stonehenge, among a select circle of Druidical junsconsults, 01 in a Saxon Wittenngeniote, or in an assembly of Danish Berserkers, then the British Constitution might be likened to the British Museum Unfortunately, with regard to the establishment in Great Russell street, the date of the foundation is well known a fact which stakes at once at the foot of our parallel Otherwise time is some thing essentially constitutional about our national collection of antiquities It is an omnibus gallie) um like the Constitution of odds and ends of wisdom and learning, from all parts of the world, and its treasures have been called morn repositories now of yesterday's date and now thousands of years sold It is the most aged and the most juvenile of scientific institutions Popular. though the Museum is in its every condition of existence, we me yet constitutionally of opinion that its adieu lustration must be confided to a body of trustees, who are genet filly Bishops or L Cabinet Ministers, or some kindred variety of the genus "bigwig" And, finally, like the British Constitution, the British Museum stands in perpetual need of some thing to be done for it. It has never been finished, and probably never will be It in never be marked "complet,' like a French omnibus, of the Louvre, or the Organic Law of the Empire It is always being cobbled and patched, tinkered and stitched Now a little bit more is added to it now we contemplate enlarging it on a very grand scale, and then we pass several years in discussing w be the the next best thing would not be to let it alone Yet, on the whole, the Constitution and the Museum work well, and with all their faults, when we think of the Habeas Corpus and the Bill of Rights in the one hand and the Reading Room, the National History Collection, md the . Nineveh bas reliefs on the other, we are P inclined to back both against any other I Constitution 01 Museum to be found the whole world over the astonishing collection of literary, scientific, antiquarian, and artistic treasures known as the British Museum has been the growth of little more than a century The first purchase towards its formation was mile in 1756 The last suggestion for a Museum sprang horn the will of the famous physician, Sir Hans Sloane who offered to the Government, for twenty thousand pounds, the duties which k had spent fifty thousand in collecting the offer was accepted, and the nation be came possessed of all So Hans' books, drawings, manuscripts, punts, medals, each, cameos, mt gives, precious stones, agites, j dispels, crystals, mathematical instruments, and pictures " About the same time the Har term collection of manuscripts was also required by the State and to hold all these treasures, Montagu House was purchased from Lord Halifax, all the necessary funds being raised by a hundred thousand pound lottery So that, for once in a way, some good came out of g Embling The respectable Montagu House soon proved a Castle of Otranto, for the Museum grew too big fortis dwelling, and proposals were made for its removal to Buckingham House, now the town residence of Her Majesty At one time it was -very nearly) being installed in Old Palace lot ii At present, is everybody knows, Mr Cole and the wise men of Brompton nie Molently anxious to carry on at least a portion of the contents of the British Museum to South Kensington The structure has been for many years subjected to an intermittent process of architectural patching In 1823 George IV presented his father's library to the nation-a noble gift, though in accumulating its splendid materials George He boasted that he never spent more than two hundred a year To accommodate the King's library a new building was erected in the rear of the original one Gradually, the quaint old red brick built quadrangle of Montagu House gave pi ice to a gloom) and grand Grajeo Ionic fabric designed by Mr ?jmuke The last relic of the ancient in mision to disappear was the gateway in Great Russell street, with its picturesque octagonal turret, clock, and cupola 'I the present aspect of the Museum is familiar to the public. It is a very imposing mass of stone work , but it would be slightly more productive of pleasurable impressions in the mind of the spectator if it did not quite so closely resemble a county gaol, with the usual brick wall replaced by a thundering bronze lading profusely gilt Huge as it is, and vast as the sums which have been spent upon it, the exterior of the Museum has decidedly unfinished look There are big pedestals flanking the portico designed to support the monumental groups of sculpture but the statues have not yet been carved on cast, nor, so far as we know, even modelled Beneath the colossal columns of the facade nestle the paltriest imaginable sheds of blackened timbers rudely glazed, in which are huddled away, for want of room inside the building a sumptuous collection of antiquities from Hahcarnassus and other famous clas steal localities Inside the place full to bursting The cellars are full of priceless " cures " in the sculpture galleries, which are in themselves little better than family v. asks, exquisitely beautiful statues and busts are stacked after the fashion of the "compo" stags, lions, unicorns, Cupids, Peaches, and Infant Samuels in the Euston road be cabined, cribbed, and confined is the British Museum, that fully one third of its treasures remain concealed from the public gaze A Londoner may live till eighty without having set eyes upon the prints, the drawings, the coins, the medals, and the gems in Great Russell street objects which have been bought with the money of the nation, and which are as clearly national property as the National Gallery , an American paper says that house flies may be effectually destroyed by tiling half a spoonful of powdered black pepper on a teaspoonful of brown sugar, and one teaspoonful of cream, put them well together and place in a room where the flies are troublesome, and they will soon disappear
