k.t ' \\.eif ease — -»« ? dife^zr'Ainusements The rain interfered greatly with the attendances at the theatres last night. ' Pygmalion' was received at the Boyal with no less enthusiasm, the apparent in telligence and intense feeling with -which Sliss Carey played the heroine gained for her frequent storms of applause. Mr. Lazar was more at home as Ghryeos than on his first appearance, and repeatedly brought down the house. The general presentation was equally good, but the dissolving statue business was no improvement on the previous uighfs failure. — ''Fritz' was received with the usual favour. His Excellency the Governor patronizes the Victoria Theatre, on Thursday night, when a large and fashionable attendance is expected — The Minstrels had comparatively the best house, atthe School of Arts. The entertainment is essentially eujoyable and chaste, though thoroughly enjoy able. There is only one exception to be taken* and that is to the ghost. It is old and hor rible. The ghost of the present company is evidently made up by one learned in domonology, and is enough to frighten a grown-up person of any sensibility, while it must haunt the minds of any children that may be present for years. A policeman would be just a« funny and it is a pity to introduce a repulsive feature into so otherwise pleasant an entertainment. — Messrs. Baker and Farran are billed to appear at the Boyal after the Morton's, who play on Friday for a benefit.
