It was urged that while the action of Queensland with respect to New Guinea is under the consideration of lim: Majesty's udvisers, it would be well to raise the larger question. We havo heard frequently of late that tho French are about to extend their possessions in the neighbourhood of New Caledonia, and the prospect has oxcited uneasiness in various quarters. The Australian churches aro alarmed lest the missions on which they havo spout large sums should be interfered with or suppressed, while the genoral public is unwilling to see any more convict settlements or military posts established within a short distance of our coasts. The gentlemen who interviewed Mr. Service did not counsel annoxatiou against the wishes of tho native races. They proposed to give the islanders an option in the matter, but stated that the long connexion of the British people with them in-missionary work and com- mercial enterprise had begotten a kindly feoliuc which left little doubt as to tho decision. Tho inhabitants of the New Hebrides were said to be particularly desirous of placing themselves under British rule, while, according to the Rev. John G. Paton, senior missionary to the group, they "fear and hate the " French." The necessity for bringing the labour trade, which in the opinion of some is almost bringing " Christianity " and civilisation to a standstill," under better control, was also urged as another reason why the wishes of the deputation should be complied with. Mr. SERVICE promised to submit the matter to his colleagues without delay, and to do everything in his power to secure compliance with the views sub- mitted to him. He said that, unfortu- nately, " Humanitarian, civilising, and " christianising movements are often, " if not antagonistic to political con " siderations, at all events not in the " same line with them," but that in the present case " politics, religion, " commerce, civilisation, and humanity" would all be served by the adoption of the course suggested. The Premier acted with his usual promptitude. Within a few days His Excellency addressed the Secretary of State by cable, and tho agent general was in- structed to support the project in Downing-street. In addition to this, the co-operation of the other colonies was secured, so that the policy advocated by the deputation will be pressed on the attention of Lord DERBY by gentlemen representing united Australia. The reuson given for this somewhat precipi- tate action is that the answer received by the deputation had been telegraphed to the French Government,and delay might have rendered further proceedings use less. We pointed out that a tactical mistake had been made, and that in all probability the Imperial Government, instead of complying with our request, would take advantage of it to get out of the difficulty it is in with respect to New Guinea. It cannot take a portion of that island under the British flag without offending a large number of its poli tical supporters, and the demand for further annexation coming before it has made up its mind what to do with referenco to an inconvenient request, already under consideration, gives it an excuse for suymg that it will not enter upon a policy of which it can- not see tho end We nave since heard by cable that the radicals are urging Hj k MAiLbiv'b advisers to avail them selves of the excuso which our ill advised importunity has alloidcd them Wo also drew attentiou to the fact that however nun h the Imperial authori ties might be disposed to fall in with our viüWB, they would certainly net enteitiuu an application buch as that about to be submitted unaccompanied by an olfer to bain a fair sliare of the expenses nivohed 'W e subsequently learnt that the agents general were also well assuicd on the point, and hid como to the conclusion that belora waiting on the Sccietaiy of »Stato they should be placed in ii position to say how much the colonies would be pi upai ed to contribute lu tIib original telegram to Mr 1» MumivY Smuii, Air ¿lrmci' stated geneially that tboy might give something towards the cost of govern mg und protecting tho islands, but ufiei its expérience m tho case of 1 ip, the Home Government is not likely to be satisfied with such vague geueiahties In communicating with the othoi colonies no îeference was made, apparently, to this most impoituit part of the business, and it is possible that if oin neighbours had known that they would bo expected to put their li mds into then pockets to support then lecommendations, they would not have been in quite such a hurry to fall in with the \ lews of Mr Srr\ ice's Administration It is ono thing to suggest annexation at the expense of tho people of England, and altogethei auothei to place a sum on colonial estimates foi the purposes of effecting it. Heroic measures lose a great deal of their attractiveness when they have to bo paid for. What arrangement may be come to, it is im- possible at present to say ; but the action of tho colonial Governments and Legislatures in this particular will indi- cate very clearly the extent of thoa interest in the proceedings to which they are seeking to commit the mother country. This is a matter that should he haudled by the Imperial Government in u statesmunlike way, and not subordi- nated to mere party convenience. Fioni a strictly Australian point of view it is very undesirable that the Now Hebrides the Solomon Islands, the Loyalty group, Now Britain, New Ireland, &c;, should, fall into the hands of foreign powers. As convict settlements or naval stations they would be standing nuisances aud menaces to these colonies. But no one can contend that their annexation is desirable for strictly Imperial purposes, and that being the case, wo cannot fairly ask the people of England to bear the cost of taking and keeping posses- sion. What the mother country may be fairly asked to do for Imperial in- terests in tho Pacific is to establish ports of refuge and coaling stations at strategic points along the great highways of trade, before the chance of doing so has passed away. All portions of Hub Majesty's dominions would bo bene- fited by such a proceeding, and con- sequently the cost would justly fall, under existing arrangements, on the Imperial exchequer. At the same time we think that annexation desired by Australia purely on Australian account should be made, if treaty engagements do not stand in the way, provided the colonies will undertake to defray the cost of governing the islands acquired, and to contribute towards their defence in time of war. The federal movement has been slumbering of late, but it glows while it sleeps, as do other healthy subjects The Albury demonstration to celebrate the completion of the railway union of Mel bourne ana Sydney appears to have awakened it to life and vigoui The announcement made by'Mr Siiimcb that the Victorian Ministiy aro intent upon taking an early opportunity of piessmg the issue upon the attention of the Government of New South Wales, and his hopeful declaration that he will live to be a Federal Mimstei himself, took the Albury audience by storm, and if the pi ess ia a ciitenon, the recoption of thenewsof theieuewcd effoit is equally cordial and enthusiastic m the country The federal sentiment is undoubtedly gaming stiength, and lecent political changes are to be icguided as altogether favouiublo to the causo The old leaders who tiled aud (ailed, and bome of whom never had their heait m their woik, are happily not now nt the he id ot afiuirs 1 n both colonies wo have new men nnd new Parliaments now important tins coimideiutum is will appeal when tile events ol the lust Yictonau Bession ure lecullcd Mi Mu\io tabled i motion iavouiable to federation, and speeches practically ol it hostile charnctei were delivered by the Premier, Sir BimN O'Logiilen, and by the leader of the Opposition, Mi BiititY ledoiation was descubed us lmpiucticublo and as a fad Discussion soon made it clear that the House waa with Mr Muniio, and the motion would probably have boon cai ried against the chiefs, nid a confei etice committee would havo been ap- pointed to supersede Minutéis, if the block caused by the btoiiewalling ot the Tramway Bill had not been latal to the transaction ol private members' busi- ness Now that the Government are pledged to take the matter m hand technical difficulties will disuppeai Wa aie Bure that the new House will be as ready to support a willing Minister as was the old Assembly, and we have a Ministor, it seems, who is willing, and something more, in the person of Mr. Service. If New South Wales has been equally fortunate with its Assembly and its Premier, Mr. Stuaiit, then before tho year is out wa may hope that the federal sentiment will have found expression in sorno concrete form -that sorno practical step will have been taken towards tho establishment of the new Dominion of Australia. It is lor the Victorian Cabinet to settle its own differences. The Albury addresses disclose the existence of views which will have to bo reconciled, for I tho tono of Mr. Sehvice was not the ', tono of M r. Bunny, It pleased the J latter gentleman to throw tho blame of I past failures upon " public men, and ; " the public press." We are certainly not i called upon to defend the public men i who have conducted the federal negotia- ' tious in the days gono by, for us we , havo had occasion repeatedly to.declare, ¡ they have approached each other in a ' haggling spirit, as if each were intent , upon getting tho better of the other in ? some smart commercial transaction. There has been too little of. the breadth and the conciliation of statesmen, and ? far too muck of the scolding of Chiuesa Trawkoreand crafty housewives cone) ud nig n bargain in a back lane But Mr BiittnY should have spoken of tho " pro u tectimiist" ind not of the " public ' press If the ideas put forward from time to time by the protectionist organs were to be insisted upon, federation would indeed be a dream A rectification of frontiers is demanded, as though Biverma could be annexed without the consent of its settlers Ihe establish ment of snmotlung like equality in the sue ot the colonies is spoken of as an indispensable condition It is a hope less condition atao If America and if Gei ninny li id waited until the area of territory m the difieient states and kingdoms hud been assimilated, theie would havo been no Union and no ampire, and a te allotment of acreb montis the indefinite postponement of federation heie also Massachusetts is not one tenth the si/o of Texai, and a dozen Delawares could be put into Keutucky, m Geunatiy Prussia cou tams nearly 110,000 pquaie miles, and the list (mes down through Bavaria, Saxony ind Baden, to Waldeck with 150 square milos Wo aie not lil ely to hive such disparities ni Australia, be cause Victoria, the smallest of the colonies, it> a huge state, and the lurgci are the other colonies, the more probable is their ultímate subdivision The con stitutioual press, instead of manufac tunng obstacles of thiB class, has always been ready to accept the position as it stands, and federate nrst and leave sub divisions and rectifications to come after wards The wisdom of this course is apparent Federation would give us free and easy commercial intercourse with lliverina ; we should virtually annex that province, and in that case a readjust- ment of boundaries for the general con- venience would be a much simpler matter than it is to-day. The first thing, as we have urged, is to establish the Federal Council, even if that council could only deal with rail- ways, mail services, lighthouses, and défonce. But it would be a great disappointment if after a time the taritt* issue could not bo remitted to such a body also. Given a fairly constituted council-say the colonies to send a member for each 50,000 inhabitants-and we are sure that the freetraders of Victoria would offer no objection to the adjustment of the Australian tariff beiug left to the new authority. There would be troubles, no doubt, to face, and nice points to dispose of, but after all there should be no more difficulty in framing a tariff which should suit all Australia than there is in framing ono which will accommodate Edinburgh and Lon- don, or Bremen and Berlin, or New York on the Atlantic, and San Fran- cisco on the Pacific. If wo believe at all in such a body, we must assume thnt it would weigh and deliberate, would do nothing rashly, would be unjust to no established interest, and would consider solely how to promote the prosperity of the colonies as a whole. If we do establish a federal council, then the proper course, as wo submit, is to leave it to come to a free decision. If the " other side" in Victorian politics has au equal confidence in its own cause and in the federal principle, diffi- culties could bo regarded as at an end. But should the protectionists decline to trust the council of the union with the tariff, then we would establish the body for the other purposes, and would take half a loaf rather than go without the federal bread. It is, however, a poor device to describe as hostile to the cause a press which advocates a federal council to be left free to deal with all federal issues. The news can be sont to England that tho mission of the Redmond Bhothkks has dono good rather than harm in Vic- toria. Tho d dogates may collect sorno money for tho Irish Loaguo, but they have not been countenanced by the load- ing Irish colonists, and, what is moro, to tho point, their appearance has stirred the doep-Beated loyalty of the colonists ; and it íb impossible now for any party oither to tako up tho llome ltulo cry or to Bni'Or at tho Erapiro. Thoro was a great disposition to do these things a few montlis back. Tho radical organ in Melbourne was Tilled with allegations o£ " blood- guiltinoBs " against England in connexion with the Egyptian campaign, and the Homo Rulo causo was advocated with warmth. A Homo llulo motion wits tabled with tho consent of the radical party in tho Assombly, and one of tho features of Iho Redmond moetings íb tho quoting of nrticlos from the Melbourne radical journal, written apparently in support of that motion, to show that Homo Rulo is called for, and that Vic- toria ought to remonstrate with Groat Britain for not complying with the Irish domands. The dulogates treat their audiences lo mimbors of such sentences as these, culled from the radical journal " What is England doing at this very mo ment bat trying to stave off Home Hule by J assisting part of the Irish population to emi (.rate to tho colonies? But we do not want to take the bad bargains of the mother countty off her hands, und ne do not wish to assist Kngland io keeping the Bister island deprived of constitutional rights " However, it is a harmless amusoment for tho Messrs Redmond to read those passages to day Whatever radicalism may think, it lins lind to subrnit^to au overwhelming public opinion Thanks to I tho % mit of tho delegates, we shall have J no Home Rule motions proposed for discussion in the Assorubly again, foi opinion ia strong that those who would acclimatise the unhappy and burn nig Irish quostion here - whether I radicals or Redmonds-aro as foolish or as wicked as those who would introduce phylloxora, or hydrophobia, or any post or any plague We can woll (lispeiiBO with those evils Radicalism has gone ovor for tho timo The Messrs Bj'dmoïiD, aftor a rccoption which will oncourago no successors, will, we may trust, go away for evor.

In V...U, r* Hu) filet tllllt tile receipt of tho Now Zealand commnmcu tion will render a decision one way or tho othor an immediate necessity, wo think that Mr SKitvicb would do well to take advantago of Mr Sioakt's proseuco in Melbourne to discuss tho matter with that gentle man Tho expense to cich colony con corned would ho so trifling, while the possible benches aro so largo and nuiuoroa that wo should bo\erymuch surprised if such a conforonco were not to end m a determination to support tho undertaking The prospect of any gioat iraprovo mont in tho state of the Melbourne streets is by no moana encouraging At ono time it was thought that steam rollers would anuble the municipal authorities to piovide proper thorouahfares for tho con Bluntly increasing trdlic, but that idea has buen abandoned for various reasons In the li rat place, bluestone metal is un suitable lhe citizens' money is con verted into tins metal, and then poured into tho Yana In tho secorid place, the toilers expedito tho pulveiisation of the stone into po%\ der and lastly, when those machines aro used, tile public uro fie quontly put to great inconvenience, aud the municipal authorities incur considei ablo risk A case which came before tho law courts a few months a¿o, and which lull bo luthin tlio recollection of our readers, furnishes an instance of the lisle refoned to Iho Collingwood Council lout the Brunswick Council a rollei, and while it was proceeding along a Molbourno street to Bl uns wick, a Bpatk from tho ungiuo Hew into a girl's oyo, tho result being that the Melbourne Corporation «as involved in costs to the amount of over £500 Iho propriety of selling the steam rollers in its possession has ongagod tho attention of the Melbourne Council In place of bluostono metal, tho latter I council has resolved to extend the use of wooden blocks, which havo been tried elsewhere under Icbsfavourable conditions than the material will be exposed to here, and with satisfactory results. Owing, however, to the great coBt of wooden paving, this roruedy is, it seems, only to bo applied to a very limited oxtent in the hoartofthocity.Outof the loanof £200,000 which the council is about to raise, £45,000 has been sot apart for this paving, and the places in which It has to bo laid down have been defined. Bourke streot is to be . paved from K1 ¡nabotli to Russoll streets. CollhiB-streot from Swanston to Queen stroots, Flindora Btreot from Swanston to Elizabeth streets, Elizabeth-stroot from Flinders to Therry streets, and Swanston-Btreet from FlindorB to Viotoria streotB. It is doubt- ful whether all that work can bo done for tho rooney voted, and it is ovidont that a greater effort to moot the dilliculty ought to bo mado. As the overdraft of tho Corporation is about £35,000, it is to bo prosuraed that it cannot mako its annual rovonuo go further than at pre- sent. Under theso circumstances, it would be woll to take into consideration the dosirablenesB of increasing the rates. Tho Melbourno rates, which amount to only Is. 4d. in the £, aro much bolow tho average of those paid in tho motropolitau suburbs, and it must bo ronietnberod that the citizens of Melbourne have of lato years been relieved from direct charges that they formerly had to bear-namely, the cost of emptying cesspools, all sani- tary work of that nature boiug now dono Gratuitously by the Corporation, which, in effect, thus returns to the ratepayers about one-third of the genoral rate.

' lu a letter to The Tinfi Mr Mitrhol) nenry, member for County Galway, Btatea hia deep conviction that the evila of Ireland are Bociul and not political, und that the funda I mental error of our statesmen Ima been that they havo subordinated the material pros perity of that country to tho financial needa I of Euglund, and have cared little whnt | became of the toiling masaca of Iriah peasants so long aa they could make prosperity budgets | for England. Landlords ma) havo exacted heavy rents from their tenants, hut these have been light, indeed, in comparison with the lent England has exacted from the ¡ Irish people up to tho present moment. Such is the indictment, and now for the proof Since the greatfamine of IS 17-48 the Imperial taxes of Ireland have been more than J donbled. Up to that time Ireland con ubuted four millions annuilli to this I couiitr) lb« amount rosy have been too small, but the luquality waa more than re- dressed in the year 1853, when by the lmposi non of the income tax and the equalisation of tho Bpirit duties the Irish taxes were raised to eight millionB and a half. Of this Bum a return obtained by Mr M Laren in the years 1872 73 shows tbttt not oue fourth waa expended in Ireland itself. Tbe Treasury bus not supplied any later return, but making ample provision for all increases of expenditure, and adding a liberal amount for Ireland's share of the j expenses of Ministenal oflicea, diplomatic services, interest and management of debt, pensions, and aoon, it ¡b unqueationable that of the wholo Bum aunually raised by Ira penal authority in Ireland, between two and three millions ia nothing more nor leas than a tribute exacted by the richor and more powerful country from the poorer and weaker. Add to this weight of Imperial taxation the pressure of local taxes and the absentee rents paid to landlordB who expend nothing in the country, and it will be found that very nearly one fourth of everything that ib raised by agriculture or made by manufac tures in Ireland in the course of each 12 months goes in taxation No country in the world has e\er prospered under such conditions, and until this ia seen and understood there can be no hope of decont living among the people or of social improvement Hie pressure of taxeB is in proportion to income, and it ia nonaenae to say that each individual luehman paya no more than each individual Englishman, when the one ia ao much poorer than the other Tho aggregate richea or the aggregate poverty of the inhabitants of a country forma the largest element m the possibilities of ita ad vanee in civilisation, and bo long bb Irelaud produces so little and expendB bo much in taxes she will not progresa ' Diplomacy," at the Bijon Theatre, is one of the greateat successes of the time, ond the theatre is crowded nightly.

The performance of " Romany Rio " at the Theatre Rojal on Saturday night was at' tended by a very large audience. There was not a vacant seat in the building. The drama huB some points of attractiveness, and to the pit and gallery especially it ib apparently very interesting. The very numerous company engaged in its representation are satisfactorily efficient, aud the lead given them by Mir Rignold, Mr. Greville, Mr Carey, Mr. Leake, Miss Watts- Phillips, and Misb Henderson, is nell supported by the subordinates. The piece will be produced euch evening until further notice. Ihe Victoria.hu.il waa crowded again on Saturday eveuing, when the Federal Minstrels appeared in a new programme. The quat' lette of vocalists and Messrs. Lawton and Bent provided a very entertaining concert in the first portion of the entertainment, and subsequently Messrs Lawton and Kennedy aud Mr Bent appeared in specially sketches with Baccess. Messrs. Braham and Amery gave an udmirablo rendering of the " Army und Navy" duet, for which they were cor. dially applauded, and Mr. Heywood's per- formances in "ChowChow" were very well received. The Minstrels will reappear each evening until further notice. A benefit entertainment was tendered to Professor Miller, the winner of the recent glove contest with Laurence Poley, in the Princess's Theatre on Saturday night There waB a very large attendance. The programme included exhibitions of athletic skill by members of Professor Miller's gymnasium, drill and broadsword exercises by a detach ment of the Naval Reserve, boxing, and fencing .wit.h singlestick and foil. Pro- fessor Miller engaged m sparring boats with Mr J M Christie, hia trainer for the recent contest, and Mr John Thompson, the trainer of Foley, these eventB being recoived with loud applause. At the conclusion of the entertainment Prof, Miller returned thanks to Ins many friends for their kindness in providing lum with a benefit, and stated the opinion with regard to the late fight, that Foley was aa "game" an antagonist aa he ever faced, an announcement which waa heartily cheered. The Temperauca-hall, Kassell-street, waa crowded to excess on Saturday evening, at the weekly People's Concert of the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society, large numbera being unable to obtain admission for wunt of room. 1'ho programme was a very varied und attractive one, and judging from the frequent .pplause and numerous encores, it appeared to please the large audience assembled.
