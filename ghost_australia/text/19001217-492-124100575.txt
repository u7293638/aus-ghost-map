POETRY.^/ THE OLD DAGUERREOTYPES. Up in the attic I found them, locked in the cedar chest, 'Where the flowered gowns lie folded, which once were brave as the host ; .And, like the queer old jackets and the waistcoats gay with stripcB. Then tell of a wornoufc fashion — those ole daguerreo types. Quaint little folding cases, fastened with tiny hook. Seemingly made to tempt one to lift up the latch and look ; linings of purple and velvet, odd litfle frames of gold, Circling tho faded faces brought from the days of old. ' Grandpa and grandma, taken ever so long ago. Grandma's bonnet a marvel, grandpa's collar »a show ; Mother a tiny toddler, with rings on her baby hands Painted — lost 'riorie should notice — in glittering gilded bantlfe. Aunts and uncles and cousins, a starchy nnd stiff array, Itovcrs and brides, then blooming, but now so wrinklod and gray, Out through the misty glasses thoy gaze at me sit ting here Opening tho quaint old coses with a smile that is half a tsar, I will smile no more, little pictures, for heartless it, waB,. in truth, To drag to ifche cruel daylight theBC ghosts of a vanished youth.,. Go back to your cedar chamber, your gowns and your lavender, .And dream, 'mid thoir bygone graces, of the wonder ful days that were.
