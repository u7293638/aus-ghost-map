Henry Ward Beecher will, it is said, abandon the lecture platform almost entirely, and devote his attention to building up The Christian Union and completing his Life of Christ. The New York Herald denounces a proposition for a new trial in the Beecher case, and characterises the course of the counsel On reference, thereto as the repetition of a nasty drama which for months occupied the attention of the country. The whole Tilton business," it says, " has been a sham from beginning to end. Tilton was a sham plaintiff, striving for a sham verdict. He sued for damages, while he didn't want to prove the guilt of a wife whose faults he had condoned, to vindicate a reputation which he himself had destroyed, but to overthrow an. ante pianist with whom he had entered into a league and covenant of peace. Tilton's position is such that the best service friendship can render is to keep him out of the court- room., There can be no position more de- grading than a man of so much power to spend months in the presence of a jury asking vindication at the expense of a wife whose offences he had pardoned, and of the children she had borne' The new suit will be brought by Tilton, nevertheless."

Jones, from Clyde River, Shelburne county, N.S., were brutally outraged by the captain and all the crew, except the man (Greenwood), who now reveals the crime, and then killed, and their bodies thrown overboard.

On the night of the 6th July one of the most horrible railroad accidents that has ever happened in Chili occurred on the Santiago and Valparaiso Road. As the half-past 10 pm. train from Valparaiso was passing over the bridge at Limache, that structure gave way, and, with the exception of the engine and tender, the whole train, containing 50 passengers, was precipitated into the river below. The lamps were broken in the fall, and the oil running over, ignited, and set fire to the larger part of the wreck. The papers state that over half of the passengers were either crushed to death or perished by fire or water. The investigation shows that the accident was caused by a defection of the bridge, which was condemned by the engineers several months ago, without any measures being taken to remedy it At Newark, Ohio, on July 22, a terrible accident occurred, resulting in the serious, and perhaps fatal, burning of a number of persons. A test was to be made of a fire-ex- languishes, and a building had been erected, by consent of the City Council, which was to be fired for the occasion. It was thoroughly saturated with coal oil, and during the preparations it prematurely took fire. An explosion ensued, terribly burning D. C. Wine gardner, mayor ; Hon. J. D. Jones, Charles Hamilton, street commissioner and a bridge contractor from Toledo, and some 15 or 20 other men and boys. Some of the latter, it is thought, are fatally burned. CHINA AND JAPAN.

The failure of this long-established banking-house in New York, on the 27th of July, although productive of a great deal of inconvenience, and, in many cases, positive suffering, was not as unexpected as people generally believe. The credit of the house had been shaky for some time past suffi ciently so to have put on their guard persons with funds they wished, placed in safe keeping. For several months Duncan, Sherman, and Co. had to pay at the rate of 6 per cent tot accommodation, when others, not publicly supposed so solvent were accommodated at 4 per cent The direct cause of the suspension has not yet been clearly ascertained. One report traces the trouble to the failure of Alexander and William Collie, of London ; another that the refusal of their principal correspondents abroad; the Union Bank of London, and Baring Brothers,' to protect them, according to arrangement made in 1873, brought the financial sore to a head.' The firm, or, at least, some of its members, have, been prominently connected with unfortunate railway, enterprises, such, as Ene. A&unt; Und ,Great,,Wjesteh>,ond others of. similar?" character, Their indebtedness is, distributed over the country, consider., able amount Ming In the form pt letters of, credit held by travellers. " It has transpired that the foreign hills of the firm will amount to over £120,000 sterling. The former was founded in 1850 by Alexander Duncan, Watts Steanes, and Wm. Butler Duncan, the latter being the head of the present firm. He is' charged with mating transfers of real estate in anticipation of the recent catastrophe, and publishes a long card in explanation, showing that the trans- fers cover old transactions in real estate. The discovery has been made that a large amount of the indebtedness of the broken house was accommodation paper in the form of drafts drawn on them by a con- fidential clerk in their office, accepted by them, and sold to various banks through note brokers. Of this paper, probably not less than 600 600doL is held in Providence, Rhode Island, where the family of Duncan has been long and favorably known, and the agent met with little difficulty in disposing of it. One bank in New York holds CO.OOOdol., another oü.OOOdoL, and still another 30,000 dol" besides small amounts in the hands of numerous persons-the impression of acceptors being that it was drawn against merchandise and secured. Duncan Days this proceeding was entirely straight, in his opinion, and more or less the practice of the house for twenty years post Apprehension is felt that some unaccepted bills of the house on the Union Bank of London or on the Barings will complicate the settlement of the estate, if they do not bring the London parties into trouble, The amount as drawn against special moneys lodged in bank or with the Barings by third parties for their use and account, to be drawn for from New York by Duncan, Sherman, and Co., is stated to be about 425 600dol. The question will arise whether the London bankers can transfer these funds to the general account of the New York house, and refuse bills drawn as for special account. Approximate estimate places the liabilities of Duncan, Sherman, and Co. at4,872,128doL; assets, 2,112,7i0dol. This failure has hit the theatrical profession very hard. Theodore Moss had 60,000 do],, the firm of Henderson and Colville 30,fl00dol., Katherine Rogers S GOOdE, and William Wheatley also had a large sum on deposit. J. L. Toole, the London actor, on a visit to the United States, holds their paper, which he bought two weeks before the suspension, to the extent of 30,000 doL H. J. Montague deposited with them his earnings, and Joan Brougham had his entire fortune in their hands John T Raymond and W. J. Florence, also actors, hold letters of credit on the firm, OF do many of their professional friends at present abroad. It is said that the American Jockey Club deposited 20,000 dol in the house the Saturday before failure. The following extracts from a letter received from Paris will show the consequences of this bankruptcy to travellers holding letters of credit, of which Drexel, Hedges, and Co. have already redeemed lOO.OOOdoL : " Not half an hour passes that I don't hear of cases of distress arising from this failure. Probably the majority of losers are persons to whom the event will be a real hardship, as they have no reserve funds on which to rely. A widow who came to Europe a few months ago to reside here and educate her children, deposited all her money with Duncan, Sher- man, and Co., and took their letters of credit She has not now 10 dol. in her possession, and there are rent and school bills due. Her excitement and alarm are so great that her friends apprehend insanity. There are many teachers, students, and others in exactly the same condition, and they are not only in Paris, but all over the Continent At least four Americans, who heard of the failure before the news reached the Rothschild agency, secured their money, and have retired from Paris to avoid trouble. One of the four was visited by the cashier of the agency, who demanded a return of the money, which was refused. A policeman subsequently escorted the gentleman to the American Embassy, where Minister Washburne told the cashier he could not make the arrest He added that he could only seize his baggage, and advised him not to do that. The cashier said he would not, apologised, and departed." It is confidently stated in Wall-street that the deposits in Duncan, Sherman, and Co.'s bank amounted to 2,000,000dol.
