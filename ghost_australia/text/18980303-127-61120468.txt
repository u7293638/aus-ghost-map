AN APPARITION. This is a true English ghost story of an unconventional kind. A young lady arrived late at night on a visit to a friend. She awoke in the darkness to find a white figure at the foot of the bed. While she watched the bedclothes were suddenly whisked off, and the apparition vanished. After an anxious, not to say chilly, night, the visitor went down, with little appetite, At the table she was introduced to a gentleman, a very old friend of the family, who had, she learned, also been sleeping in the house. He complained of the cold. "I hope you will excuse me," he said to the hostess, "but I found it so cold during the night that, knowing the room next mine was unoccupied, I took the liberty of going in and carrying off the bedclothes to supplement my own." The room, as it happened, was not unoc cupied, but he never learned his mistake. 'My dear,' said Mr Simple to his wife, ' I dreamed last night that I was in Heaven looking for you ' 'And did you find me, dear ' ' No. They told me you were at the bargain counter.' Mother-Children, I holeo you peeled the apples before eating them 7 COhildren-Yes, mother, dear. .Mother-Wbat have you done with the peelings ? Children - Oh I we ate them after. Positive, wait; comparative, waiter; super lative, go and get.it yourself. How melancholy are our thoughts when summer time is done; especially that thought about: the price of coal per ton.
