TRUE GHOST STORY. This is a true gho3t story of an unconven tional kind. A young lady arrived late at night on a visit to a friend. She awoke in the darkness to find a white figure at the foot of the bed. While she watched, the oeaciotnes were suaaeniy wnisxea oti, and the apparition vanished. After an anxious not te say chilly night the visiter went down with little appetite for breakfast. At the table she was introduced, to a gentleman, a very old friend of the family, who had, she learned, also been sleeping in the house. He complained of the cold. ' I hope you will excuse me.' he said to the hostess, 'but I found it so cold during the night that, know ing that the room next mine was unoccupied, I took the liberty of going in and carrying off the bedclothes to supplement my own.' The room, as it happened, was not un occupied, but hs never learned his miatake.
