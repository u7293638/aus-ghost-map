There was an antique silver spirit stand with its accompaniments on one little table for the Squire, ,and there was another, little table on the opposite side of the hearth for Mrs. Tempest, with a dainty! tea-service sparkling'and shining in the red glowj. A glance tit these arrangements would have told you that they were old servants at the Abbey-House, servants wiio knew- their master's and mistress's ^ways,"and for whom, service was more or less a labour of love,;'...

She never fills her cellars pro perly, or trusts her butler thoroughly.' 'The dresses were lovely,' said Mrs. Tempest, 1 but everyone looked "bored. How did you like my dress, Edward ?
