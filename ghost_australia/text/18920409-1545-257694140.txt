Ail Old Australian Story. On one of those old and deserted roads, made by prisoners in the early days, just where the last cutting winds through the last black scrub, a little spring bubbles out of the rock. This spot was picked upon by an old swaginan for his final camp. The mailman, passing a few days later, carried the news to the town, and in due course the coroner, accompanied by a constable armed with a spade, went out and " sat on" the remains of the old fellow, and also gave him a very shallow burial, then made their way back to the nearest station on the tableland. During the evening the coroner commenced discoursing, in an imaginative manner, upon the manner of the lonely death and the weirdness of the locality. This sort of thing was laughed at by the squatter, who offered, for a bet of £5, to ride to the spring and back before midnight. The question arose as to how the coroner should know that the ride had been duly accomplished. The constable settled the question by remarking that the dead swagmau's pipe, knife, and tobacco were lying on a stone beside the remains of the fire.. However, the wager didn't come off. The squatter happened to be down at the men's hut the following evening. Noticing an old swagman sitting by the fire, he inquired: "Do you want any tobacco, old man ? " " No, thanks; I made a rise where I camped last night. Some carrier left his knife, pipe, and tobacco on a stone, and made a big heap of earth—what for, I couldn't make out. Anyhow, it served me for a pillow." Now, had the bet been made, and the squatter come cantering round the sharp turn in the road before reaching the spring, it is just possible that time would have been too precious for mutual inquiries. The old fellow might have been travelling towards the coast the next day, and the district would have had a brand-new ghost.
