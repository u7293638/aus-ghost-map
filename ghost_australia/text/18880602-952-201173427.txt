Their hands are clasped together over the stile; their heads.his dark and curly, hers yellow as the corn below her, are very close to each other. The first words of love have justbeen spoken between them, and ' they are as foolishly and blindly happy i as it is possible for. two young people to ' ? be. ??-?????' - ?'. ? -.- '? :.' '' ? .'',.' .And yet beyond their love, and its delici- : our novelty there is little enough to make themnhappy. Walter Dalmaine is Lord Dalmaine's nephew and his heir, ancl Mabel Browne is the daughter, of 'the village doctor. ? Is it likely that a marriage willbe. allowed between the two? ' ', ? , ' tLordDalmaiiie is a widower and childless.' He has bound up all the interests of his \- life in his nephew, and he looks to him to reward his affections by marrying well and suitably to the position in life which he is' ' destined to fill. ; : '/'.,'',.',.' ' , As to Dr. ' Browne, 'if ? he is poor; ' he is also proud, too proud to forget the .differ-, ence in rank between his' daughter and' ' My lord's nephew, or to imagine for one moment that the social gdp; between , Har- biury: Hall, with its- wide-stretching park about ? it, and Ivy Cottage in' the village; ?with, its little^ two-acre gardeny can' ever: by. any inagic be briged over. No,'nb;if, Lord Dalinaine is conscious of his superi ority, Dr Browne, too, knows his place; and is_ too true a gentleman at heart ever to de sire to step out of it. . ._.;??'?' , ' Now, what business 'Walter, and Mabel had -. under, these circumstances' to talk aboutlove to each other over the stile into, Farmer Gale's five-acre field of barley I am quite at. a lossto say.'

'??'?? ?. Walter Dalmaine was at home from Ox ford / for the summer vacation. ; , Last ? Christmas he had gone to Edine, instead1 of' coming to HaTbury ; and the summer be fore Mabel had been still in short peticoats, and twas very shy, drooping ; down her face under her broad-trimmed ; hat wb en she chanced to meet the 'young1 squire ' inN the .village, and answering him' only by the briefest monosyllables when 'he happened to. address a word iri: passihgto'her. But this . summer all that had been changed, Mabel had lifted a face' bright as a flower', and: sunny as the-' skies ' to ' greet him. She had been glad enough' to talk to Mm-r aye, .and to let him wnlkby her along the shady lanes; on through the sunny meadow,; ?where they, of ten met. ; And', some how the meetings ? became more and more f re quen't, the conversation^'between' the'twp more. and more ??interesting; iuntil'1tit length the; friendship i ended,' as such 'friendships' 'irw i Tariably do, in something sweeter far ; and' the '.Void; old story'1 was told again by the atUe into rFanner Gale's field.''

Here ? was something he had not at all reckoned upon! Mabel had alwas been so gentle and ; so. docile, that it had never even entered in to his head that she could display a will stronger than his own. ! ' I am surprised at you, Mabel! I never thought you would have been unreason ? able and have taken things this way,' was all;he could say. , i ' I am sorry to vex you, papa ' answered Mabel; more humbly ; ' but in such a matter as my whole life's happiness I cannot afford to be anything but sincere with you.' 'But do you not see,' urged the poor man, ' that you are not Walter Dalmaine's equal ?.

' 'I am afraid not, papa,' shaking her head, 'I am not the kind of girl to give a: man her heart one day and then take it away fl-ia iia-v-f. .' . . , . , ' Dr. Browne went about his day's work wiCh a load as of lead on his heart. As he drove along the summer lanes in. the high wheeled dogcart, ministering to the poor with as much care and. kindness, as he gave tp his richer patients, he could not get this .vexed question of Mabel's obstinacy out of liis mindforlOminutesatatime. .What was he to dp. witli.her? How was he to argue with :her-? In., what manner could her urge her further to give up her^lover ? Dr. Browne could not tell for the life of him, for the worse of it was .that at the very ibottom of his- heart, he believed-the girl to :be in' the right.1 Why should, not Walter Dalmaine marry her if he chose to do so ? What single real or valid cause could there be against ?such a union?, Mabel's strong common-sense and upright nature had not misled her. If Walter had asked her to. marry him and she had given him her word; the girl was right to stick to him.; She was as good a girl as ever lived, and as true a gentle woman as yon could find in all England; it might even' be that her' birth was better 'thannia. ' : , jAnd Dr. Browne's thoughts went back ' years and years ' ago. to' a dark, stormy night, in a foreign.' town, when he had been summoned in haste to the bedside of a dying woman — a woman so near to death that she had been unable to speak to him. She had. oiily motioned with her hand towards the infant that lay upon her. arm, and had only' just smiled faintly in her. last breath when' he had gathered the poor little babe to his heart, and told her that he would be as a father to it. Who was this dying woman ? He knew not. Mabel might well have as good blood iii' her veins ds the Dalmaiues. Who could tell ?? : ???:?''?/'?'. ' All tho same, Dr. Browne did not want to quarrel . with ; Lord ; Dalmaine. His bread ,and butter depended upon him, for his lordship might easily: make Harbury too hot to. hold him, and would probably do so were lie to run counter to his wishes. ? Dr. Browne did not. know quite what he .was to do in the matter. . -.. . -.- Meanwhile, Mabel herself had not wasted the morning. No sooner was her father well oil on his morning rounds, than the young lady fetched her hat and started forth alorte across the fields in the direction of Harbury Woods; It was her trysting place with AValter — and she was not wrong in imagining that whatever might havo passed between him and his uncle, he would not fail to keep the appointment he had himself made with her . -. Her lover was there, awaiting her under tlie . beech-trees. His brow was gloomy, and there was scarcely any brightness in the smile with which he forced himself to greet her. ; 'There has been no end of a row, Mabel,' said Walter, in the terse and explict lingo of :his age and class. , ? , .., ; ' So I gather.

Truth to say, Lord Dalmaine felt, at. the ? very bottom of his heart,, a certain amount of irritation against the wor thy old doctor,. . in that ho was as anxious as himself to break off the engagement between the ? young people. 1 1 was not flattering to his . self-love that Dr Browne should not even experience the temptation of wishing that' ;: Mabel might marry his heir; of course had - he allowed himself to express such a wish, Lord, Dalmaine would have been furious: ' ?. ? he would have called him a designing man,, and have accused him of plotting to entrap his nephe'w ; but Dr Browne's sentinienis; were so evidently in exact-accordance with ?? his own, that he was almost angered -there---' iby.

'Well, my lord, if you were to make; Mabol understand that by sticking to her lovo she is injuring lm prospects in life— if, ! in fact, you were to threaten to disinherit him if he persists in marrying her— I think my girl loves him sufficiently unselfishly to he willing to give him up.' Lord Dalmaine was silent. The disin heriting had been his own idea. He was rather surprised at the suggestion, coming ?from the hostile camp. . His next reinurk was 'perhaps a surprise to Dr Browne, who was unacquainted with the strange workings of his noble friends mind. . . ?: ; ' You seem uncommonly anxious to tall in with my wishes, Dr Browne. One would almost think that you considered my nep Jiew a bad match ior your daughter.' ' I do so, my lord, replied the doctor, staunchly, but with profound respect in his ? voice and manner: 'it would he an unequal match, and therefore of necessity a bad one.' Perh aps Lord Dalmaine felt less convinced of this fact than he had done before. '.'. Very well,' he answered. 'I will take your suggestions, doctor, and will write to your daughter.' Dr Browne withdrew, and Lord Dalmaine ?wrote to Mabel in the manner in which her father had told him. By breakfast time the following morning the young lady's answer was brought to him. He opened the letter ; there were two sheets of paper within — one was addressed to himself, and the other to his nephew. ' Bear Loud Dalmaine ' (wrote Mabel 1 to himself), ' what you say about Walter has quite decided me. Of course I love him too truly to stand in his light and ruin his life for him. I wish you to give him the enclosed letter, and to read it yourself be fore you do so, that you may understand that I am in earnest, and that I am content to sacrifice my own happiness, aud even to tell, him an untruth, in order to secure his. 'M. B.' Then, not without a slight sense of ?wonder, Lord Dalmaine unfolded the second letter to read it. ,» 'DeAb Walter, ?'I am afraid you will think very badly of me, and cousider me very fickie and changeable; but the fact is, that I find that since becoming engaged to you mjrfeelings have altered, orrather that I have been mistaken altogether. I do not love you, Walter, enough to become your wife ; I, therefore, release you from your engage ment. Please do not try to see me. I am going away to see some Mends by the twelvo o'clock, so you need not seek an ?intorview with me that would be as pain ful- as if; would be useless. I only ask you to forget me, and if possible to forgive me. .';.?. ' Mabel.' Lord Dalmaine sat for some moments with this letter in his hands, staring fixedly be fore him. Walter had not yet come down to break fast ; he was alone. He poured himself out » cup of tea and swallowed it hastily, then »' lie read the letter through once more. I ' She is a noble girl I' ho said to himself I aloud, 'and I will ro myself and tell her [j , that I think so !' Then he got up and rang the bell. i «' Take this up to Mr Dalmaine's room,' he said to the man-servant, giving himpoor Mabel's letter, which he previously slipped into a fresh envelope; ' But before you do so, get my hat and stick. I am going out:' i And before Walter had opened the myster : ious^missivo which the footman brought up ; to him on a silver tray, Lord Dalmaine was ; halt way across the parkin the direction of \\- tue village. ? \ Nobody knew, what those letters had cost i Mabel Browne to write. A sleeples night, !i oceans of despairing tears, a heartache that amounted to physical pain ; all this had left j. her in the morning pale as a ghost lieavy ii eyed and languid. She had breakfast in ii her own bedroom, and had only crept down stairs to her little snuggery, after that lier ?i father had started forth en his ; mornins' i rounds. . - ? She sat now silent and tearless ? by the I -window, her hands listessly crossed upon' j her kuess. her face white and - drawn; with the suffering she was undergoing. '!'I have done what is right,' she kept on . telling herself, in pitiful self-consolation. ' To be turned out a beggar upon the world because he married me 7 that I could never have borne! I had sooner he were happy. I shall bear it well enough — in time — in1 time !' But her self-sacrifice had well-nigh crush ed all the life out of her. : All she hoped was that Walter should not i attempt to see her before she left — she had, I in fact, given orders that he was not to be admitted if he called. To have seen him might have upset her fortitude — to listen to hisprayers or his reproaches would be more ' than she could bear. She had told her servants to pack her box, and to order the fly to take her to the station to meet the twelve o'clock train. She meant to leave before her father's return, and to leave a letter to tell him where she had gone. She had some friendB — old maiden ladies in the next county — to whom she could always go at a/moment's notice, and to whom she had already despatched a telegram. She was too worn out with the mental struggle she had gone through to take any active part in the preparations for her de parture. So she only sat there, pale and silent, looking out j with eyes that saw not ?upon the smiling little garden, and wonder ing with a numb, half-stunned wonder, how she- was ever to live out her life. 1 ' Suddenly the loud clanging of the front door bell rang through the silence of the little ; house'. Mabel started and turned pale; whilst her heart beat violently. Could it be- Walter? She listened breathlessly whilst the maid-servant went to open the door,' and she heard the tones of a man's voice without. ?: Yes; it must be Walter; but he would not) .-; be admitted— her orders had been peremptory. - But the visitor evidently had been ad ?mit.tp.fl- !for t/hflrp. enmn tlu- sniinrl nf Rfn-na across the little hall, arid in another minute theidoor.behind her opened. Mabel started ?to her feet, crimson with emotion, and Lord Dalmaine was ushered in. ; The poor child fell back pale and trembl ing; she would almost havo fainted, had not a strong sense.of pride braced her nerves and enabled her to present, a semblance at least, of tranquility. , : ? ;' ' ? She held out her hand timidly. :'; -Lord Dalmaine took it and. held it firmly- within , his.own. ?.....: ? .??- ?? .' , ?.?'??;.:' ' '.' 'Miss Browne, I have come to thank you — — ' '-. ? ?

' tell you how, nobly, -how bravely you have behaved in writing that letter.' ,' . ' 'You have given it tb'bim?' she faltered, with perhaps a faint, unacknowledged hope at her heart that he might have felt sufficient pity for her to withhold it. But Lord Dalmaine murmured an assent to her question. '-Mabel 'turned her face away from him with a shudder of absolute loathing, which her visitor apparently did not perceive, He went on speaking. ' 1 am sure you will never repent what you have done, aud that you will live to be glad that you had the strength of mind to break off this foolish attachment to my nephew. I am certain that you are a clever and a sensible girl, and you know better than I dp how prejudicial to Walter's future a marriage so below his social posi tion would be to him. I have looked to my nephow's marrying a wife whose connec tions shall help him on in. the world. He must go into Parliament, represent the county if possible. His wife must bring him both interest and money, and be a help not a clog to him— you see all this, I am sure.' Mabol nodded. ' If he were to marry in any other way,' continued Lord, Dalmaine, 'his career would be altered. He would lose my sup port— with it the hspe of making a' name and a position for himself. You will see that by the side of these grave considera tions—a passing attachment and foolish love fancy cannot count; it is wiser for you both to put an end at once to what would only — only — only- — '?' ''' ' Here Lord Dalmaine's voice waxed ? suddenly faint »nd faltering ; the flow of his eloquence seemed paralized ; his eyes ' became riveted with an expression ever more and more intense upon the ? slender figure of the girl before him. She was wearing a simple grey morning _ dress, de void of trimming and of decoration. One single ornament brightened the Quaker like simplicity of her attire ; it was an old-' fashioned locket, set about with pearls, fastened by a ribbon round her throat. It was upon this object that Lord Dal maine's eyes had become fixed as by a spell. ' Whore,' he faltered, cutting suddenly short his wise and prudent little speech-J— 'fpray toll me where you got this?' pointing to the ornament she wore, , 'This?' said Mabel, intensely surprised. 'My locket do you mean? It was my mother's ; but why do you ask?' - : ' It cannot have belonged \ to your mother,' cried Lord Dalmaine in 'evident agitation. ' I — I know that locket.- I designed the cypher of pearls that is on it myself. You must have bought it some-1 where.' ? 'I beg your pardon Lord Dalmaine ; you are mistaken. The locket belonged to my mother ; it contains her portrait?' ' ' Then for Heaven's sake show it to me !' he faltered. ? ''.'''' ' - ' '?'??- ? He was very pale and his hands trembled! Mabel, wpnderingly, acceded to his extra ordinary request. She disengaged the trin ket from her neck, and opening it; put it into his hands. Lord Dalmaine gazed at it for some minutes speechlessly— heseemed thunderstruck; then suddenly he '? drew Mable towards him, and claspedher to his heart. ? ? ; ' : 1 'Mabel, if this is your mother, you are my child — the child 1 had imagined to have died with her — for this is the portrait of my wife!' . ,:..-..?-. ? ? -*; ,: # ? ?« :? . # . . .:?
