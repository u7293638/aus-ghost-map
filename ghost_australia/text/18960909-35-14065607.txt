CARDINAL MORAN AND THE BISHOP OF GOULBURN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir-At unpleasing to me to know that my correspondence with Cardinal Moran is now drawing to an end Before L lay down my pen allow me to express my deep obligations to you for permitting me to reply to his strictures " For your enemy who takes to flight build a br dgo of gold " I am also much indebted to Cardinal Moran for furnishing me with this apt proverb It seems a pity, however, that he does not retire from the discussion without making additional rain statements Had it not been for the misstatements I should have allowed him to retire unmolested But I must now ask for a further hearing To mis- represent his antagonist, and then reply to what he did not say, is a controversial race of which Cardinal Moran makes full use When I stated that Roman theological and devotional writers teach that " the Blessed Virgin is present and received, together with her Divine Son, in the Holy Eucharist," I invented " noticing Cornelius i Rapide says "As often as we eat the flesh of Christ in the Eucharist, so often in it do we really eat the flesh of the Blessed Virgin ' Father Faber says that the Lord Himself " vouchsafed at Moss to show to St Ignatius the %eiypartof the Host which had once belonged to the substance or Mary " I again ask, where is the " gross inmpiifÂ«entationr> What is it that I have "invented In addition to Cardinal Moran's former fable about Anglican "enmity and hatred" to the Blessed Virgin (which he again insinuates by pretending that we wish to seek for " spot" " in the " sun " of her holy and sports les character), in addition also to his other fables about the Goulburn Protestant nuns and the cargo of the mi3"-inmuy ship, he has now given us is now fable, viz that I misrepresented Roman teaching i when I clothed in my own words a plain statement of fact, which is more than sufficiently borne out by certain approved Roman writers He has repudiated poor Oswald Will be repudiate Cornelius a. Lapido and Father Tabor, and (let me add) Salazar and Canon Oakley Why does he not be c mild enough to retract his | nights, instead of giving us some cheap talk about Aristotle and " our physiological friends " ? II wonder if beevor lend how many times the totality of the particles of a human body u changed and renewed in a life period of say 30 tons 5 I now ask for information If necessary it can Ijl given me privately Where is it recorded in any trustworthy ecclesiastical history that the Fathers of the Genoa ii Council of Ephesus formulated the in- vocation, "note' Mai ft mother of God, pray for us smilers " ? have real that they adopted the formula "Theo takes," but that Vu y added the formula " Ora pro nobis "I have not read I have also read this, that in the 7th canon they determined that " no person shall be allowed to bring forward or to write or to compose any other crop 1 beside that which was settled by the holy fathers who were assembled in the city of Nice with the Holy Ghost," find that this canon was after aids confirmed at Chalceduu How it was violated in the jeiirliHM by the Roman Pope Pius IV, when he put forth a series of and additions to the ancient Catholic creed, is a matter of history I'm i> crept up, in conclusion, that the tone I have adopted in this discussion has been forced upon me by Cardinal Moran himself I adopted it deliberated) because I perceived it was the only stone I could adopt with a cou tro herbalist of his particular type H in future Tio will L'op a civil tongue in his head when he director of the English Church, its clergy and then teething, I trust that he will not find us wanting in the antarctica of deb tie, in the event of our regarding it as worth while to dispute his state ments It I have followed the counsel of the Wise Men in Proverbs year, 5, I have also tried to observe his warning of the \oihq that precede I am, At WM.
