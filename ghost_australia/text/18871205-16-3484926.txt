The attention of everyone on enter- ing the church was at once turned to the sanctuary, wluoh presented a rare picture of rich colours tastefully harmonised. Behind the new marble altar a large cardinal- coloured curtain, the gift of Mrs Buchanan, was hung, looped up with cords and tassels of the same colour, the dark shade setting off the pure white altar to perfection. Above tho curtain and running the whole breadth of the eastern wall was a massive gilt cornice, immediately under which, in letters of gold, was the inscrip- tion, "Quam delicta Tabernacula, Tua domine Virtutuae Conciipeutl et tlejittt amma mea tu Atna Domini" (Psalm. IXXMII) An additional thiono bul been eieoted opposito that yyhich has tonnorly been in position.

After pontifical high mabs tho {investiture took placo. But before wo proccod to dosoribo tho ceremony, it might bo useful to state xvhat tho Pallium is. Tho Pallium, xvhioh is sent by tho Popu ohiofly to arehbishoris and npostolio legates, aud also somo sullragan bishops, is mudo of lamb'sxvool, dottcdjxvith purpleoiosses, and in breadth about 3iu. It is worn on tho shoulders like a sapulur. Tho xvool with which i it is made is tuken from xvhito lambs, xvhich aro blessed on tho feast of St. Agnes, in her church, where tho lelics of tho youthful virgin woro discovered during tho Pontificate ' of Paul V. in tho Nomontun-roud, and aro taken lo a convent till thoy uro shorn, and of thoir xvool tho PallimiiB aro made by tho nuns of St. Lavvronco in Panisferna. Previous to the blossing of tho PiilUums hy the Pope, thoy aro laid for tho wliolo night preceding tho festival of St. Peter on that apostle's tomb. The Pallium -was worn in a different form hy tho Roman Emperors, and when Romo becamo Chribtiau her rulers sent it to distinguished bishopB as a mark of tho Royal Priesthood of Christ. St. Isidoro, of Polusium, explains at length tho mybtic signification of tho Pallium. It is regarded as an ombloin of humility and chai ¡ty, putting tho prelate in miud that ho ought to seek out, in imitation of tho Good Shepherd, the lost sheep of his flock. Pope Syramaehus sent a Pulliinn to Gieanrius, Arch- bishop of Aries, his Aricar in Gaul in tho sixth century. Sometimes it is received from tho Pope in person, as xvas tho case of St. "William, Archbishop of York, in the txvolfth century. Tho Pallium is buried with tho arch- bishop at his death, and if tho prelato should dio before be receives his Pallium it is burned and tho ashes put into thosacrarium. Suoh in brief is the use and significance of tho Pallium. When the celebration of tho mass was com- pleted, the Bishop of Rockhampton and his assistants had left the sanctuary, the Cardinal xvus vested in cope and mitre, and the Archbishop assumed a chasuble and all other vestments becoming to his dignity except tho mitre. His Eminence, cto/ier in hand, then ascended the altar stops and took his seat on a faid-stool on the prcdolla. Father Fouhy approached the Cardinal and tendered him txvo Apostolic Briefs relating to the proposed iuvcstituio. The Cardinal handed them back to Father Fouhy, ordoring him to read them. Some ten minutes xvorooccupied in the rending of these documents, which xvere written in Latin. After this the Archbishop knelt at a prie-ditu before his Eminence, and reoited a. profession of faith, finishmg with nu oath on the boole of the gospolö, testifying th it this protos«ion xvas his belief He then took the oath of spiritual alleginuco to the Soxoreign Pontiff The Cardinal, rising norn his seat, noxt took tho Pallium whioh had boen spread out on tho altai, and placed it upon tho shouldeib of the Archbishop, at the same time rooitiug a prayoi This con- cluded tho ooiemon) of tho investiture CuduwlMoian was then reoonducted to his tlrrono, and, having beon dixestod of cope and mitre, proceeded to tho pulpit and dohvored a s înion HisEim,ENOE chose for his text tho xxords of the b.3rd Psalm, ' ' Glorious things aro said of thee, Oh city ot God," nndpiocoeded to shew that theso words ot prophecy had a leahsation lu tho Holy Church, in tho manner ol its founding, m its history, and in its actual con- dition The prophet Isaiah had predicted that it was to be a mauntam on tho top ot a moun- tain-so xasiblo that nono could ignoie its existence-and that all nations, kings, and peoples xvould flock tow aids it It xxas nibo prophesied that the second templo would surpass m its glory that of the fit st, and this prediction had been borne out The second temple xxas moro glorious than tho hist, bo caiibO Christ dw elt m it El its iouudiug it .w as glorious, becauso the Ahmghty had chosen foi its fiist pastors twelx o pool unie imed hshei - men, xvho had neithoi uithionco nor weildl) poxxei, and this xxas to bhoxx unto all men that the Church was God's own xvoik, md ' that no flesh ma) gloiy m his sight " Bul .w hen those mon w em iorth into tho xrorld it xx is " to toaeh " "Go," said Christ, "and teach all nations," and hence they xx eut into tho actual missionor) field, and indeed laid down thou* lix es m the cmso xvlnch they gloned in Had these men been.

PATRICK'S SCHOOLS. The foundation stone of the St. Patrick's Schools was laid yesterday afternoon by his Eminence Cardinal Moran in the presence of about 3000 persons, includ- ing many leading citizens. The arrange- ments for the convenience of spectators had not been made in anticipation of the large concourse that assembled, and in consequence considerable inconvenience was generally suf- fered. THE NEW SCHOOLS. The zeal of the Rev. Father Corrigan's ad- ministration of the Fortitude Valley parish has been as marked as his popularity. The provid- ing of new buildings to take the place of the present dilapidated St. Patrick's School, in Wickham-street, has long engaged his attention, and his efforts have been brought to a practical issue. The new schools are being erected under the supervision of Mr. F. D. G. Stanley, the architect, and are situated ie a more convenient locality than a busy thoroughfare like Wickham- street. The site of the new building extends along Ivory-street about four chains, and also opens on to Hope-street in the rear. Tho schools will, when completed, consist of a two-story building measuring 76ft by 36ft on each floor The lower one w ill bo used for the infant school and tho upper for the older girls, class-rooms 20ft by 10ft being provided. Both schools will be lofty, and special attention has been paid to the ventilation, which will be provided for on the most approved principle. The style of architecture is Italian, and the material used will bo brick, cement, and con- crete It is intended that the entrance shall be in Ivory-street where there will be a hand- some portico supported by eight columns, the school being also entered from the playground on both sides.
