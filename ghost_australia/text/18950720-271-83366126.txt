ODE TO BUMMERS. k GHOST'S MONODY. Who loudly to their brother churls, Make rude reirarka about the girls. And call them donahs, barts, and pearls ? The Bummers ! Who, when their brain; are soaked with ale. Protest, in terms obscure and stale, That women, one and all, are frail ? The Bummers ! Who, when they breathe a woman's name, However free she is from blame, Say something flash that will defame? The Bummers ! Who scruple not to raise a laugh, By ' jokea,' which, thought they call them chaff, Their ? pala ' pronounce too had by half ? The Bummers ! Who boot and yell when they are 'tight,' Make timid liat'aera quake with fright, Aud add new terrors to the night 'i The Bummers! Who, wheu they epeak, whate'er the theme. Unloose their tongues but to blaspheme. And ponr out oaths in turgid stream ? The Bummers ! Who, strong in ? blow,' in courage weak, When smitten, turn the other cheek, And ' take it ' ohrUtian-like aud meek P The Bummers I Whose actions all betray the brand Of scapegrace, stamped with brazen hand, A curse to this and every land ? The Bummers ! Who give their kindred oause to mourn That ever such as they were born To load the names they bear with scorn * The Bummers! The Cemetery, July 16, 1S9S.
