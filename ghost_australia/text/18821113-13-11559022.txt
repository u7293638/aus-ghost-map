THE AUSTRALIAN ELEVEN IN ENGLAND. Mr OH« or THE TEAM. THE I ZINGARI MATCH. SCARBOROUGH, SECT. 10. In about an hour after our victory over Nottingham county on the 6th Inst, we left for this famous watering place, arrived here at 6 pm and put up at the Queen's Hotel, a large and beautifully situated building within a stones throw from the beach At half post 11 on the 7th we were on the Scarborough ground, only CO yards from our hotel, and at noon our match with the celebrated Zingari clnbcommenced Every effort had been made by our opponents to get to gether their best eleven, and when the names were published it was admitted on all sides that, with the exception of W G Grace, the team was a representative eleven of the gentlemen of England Indeed, many persons regarded this as a return match with the gentlemen of England, and fondly hoped that on this occasion the result might be as disastrous to us as it was to the gentlemen when we met them at Kennington Oval in June Murdoch won the toss from the Hon A Lyttelton, and at a quarter past 12 Massie and Alick Bannerman opened against the bowling of C T Studd and Evans, who has SO altered his delivery that it is now perfectly fair At the outset Massie shaped brilliantly and piled the runs up fast, while Alick rested content in playing the ball gently back to the bowler By good cricket 50 went upon the board, and then MaRio was clean bowled by 1, Forbes who has a decidedly questionable de delivery, and sent down a very fast ball 1-01-57 Massie, who was loudly applauded on retiring, hit with much freedom both to the on and the off, and when occasion required it he showed strong and sound defence Murdoch was next but he was quickly sent to the rightabout by Forbes 2-0-57 M. Donnell joined Alick, but the dashing Melbourne before he had time to start an account played Forbes on and had to depart 3-0-17 Horan had not been long at the wickets when Alick wascaughtatshort Btopby A Lyttelton off Forbes 4-5sec Giffen, who succeeded Alick, made 3 singles, and was caught at point by C T Studd off Forbes (5 for 70) and the supporters of the I can learn delighted at our non success Bonnor and Horan Bent 00 up, and then the former, who had already been missed by the Hon E Lyttelton in the longfield off Steel was well caught at long off by Lucas, off Steel 0-17-05 Blackham put L> together rapidly, and on cutting at a loose ball from 1 Forbes was caught at third man by Marriott 7 for 129 Without any alteration in the total Horan was splendidly caught low down at mid-off by Forbes off Studd 8-d2-12J Garrett made a single, and Boyle was run out for 12 and at half-past 4 our innings closed for 153 a very poor total considering that the wicket was altogether in favour of the batsmen Forbes secured six wickets for 32 runs and C T Studd two for 23, and the fielding all round was capital After the usual in terval the Hon. A Lyttelton and 6 B Studd started for the I Zingari against the bowling of Spofforth and Giffen When 14 runs were made, Blackham at the wickets caught Lyttelton splendidly off Spofforth, and Lucas joined Stated. These two kept their stumps intact until call of time at 6 o'clock, when the score stood at 50 Lucas not out 21, and Studd not out 18 Next day, at a quarter to 12 play was resumed, and when 80 was recorded Spofforth clean bowled Lucas with a good length ball 2- 20-80 Lucas played steadily and well for his contribution C T Studd joined his brother, and by good play the century was sent up, 119 and 120 quickly followed, and then C T was well caught at short slip by Bonnor off Boyle ó-21-12.1 Lord Harrie and 6 B Studd, when the luncheon bell rang at 2 o'clock, had increased the score to 172, and on resuming at a quarter to 3,100 was not long in making its appearance, chiefly through the vigorous and telling strokes of the Kentish peer Shortly before the hoisting of 110, G B Studd was excellently caught at for ward point by Alick Bannerman, off Boyle 486 103 G B Studd was missed three times but for all that his display was commendable and fully merited the warm recognition it received A G Steel joined Lord Harris and when a few runs were added a fast ball from Boyle kicked up and hit Black barn so severe a blow in the mouth that he had to retire from the field for the rest of the day Murdoch, on Blackham d retirement, took the wickets and performed very creditably At 20 minutes to 3 Lord Harris was caught at mid-off by £Garrett, off Spofforth 5-47-20.) The retiring batsman played a very free and vigorous game, and was heartily applauded on returning to his tent The remaining five wickets added 7G between them, and shortly after 5 o'clock the innings closed for the capital total of 279 Steel 29, and RAH Mitchell 32, played genuine cricket for their respective scores Boyle bowled in his best form, and secured six wickets for 97 while Spofforth got four for 105 Our fielding was not up to first class form save in three or four instances, notably Alick Bannerman and Blackham, who was in splendid fettle behind the sticks Special mention must be made of two splendid catches effected by the Hon A Lyttelton, who very kindly fielded for us when Blackham had to leave the held With 326 runs to wipe out before we could make a start Alick Bannerman and Massie, as usual, opened for us, and when 23 runs were made the latter was caught and bowled by Forbes for a well made 18 It being now within a few minutes of 6 o'clock Boyle stepped to the wickets in lieu of Murdoch, and when the stumps were drawn at 6 o clock the record was 30 for one wicket, Bannerman, not out, 7, and Boyle, not out 1 Yesterday at half- past 11 play was resumed, and at 38 Boyle fell before a break back from Steel Murdoch joined Alick and by sterling play on the part of each batsman the runs mounted up until at last we had the satisfaction of seeing the 120 wiped out Both batsmen were splendidly set at this stage and had to all appearance fairly mastered the bowling Hence we looked forward to a very long partnership but when 3 runs were added to the 120, Murdoch, to our astonishment, had his leg stump knocked out of the ground by a plain fast ball from Evans 3-53-129 Murdoch played in his best form and gave no chances Our position now was really three wickets down for 3 runs, but not in the least disconcerted at this state of things, Percy M Donnell and Alick played right merrily, and before long had loO 100,170, and ISO on the board Percy had been sinking away at a rare old rate, but at length he let out at a fast straight one from Evans, and missing it was clean bowled 4-12-189 Percy a was not altogether a faultless innings, but his hitting was hard and clean Horan, who came next, made 26 rapidly and well, and then retired caught at the wickets by the Hon A Lyttelton oil C T Studd Ti ve for 229 Giffen put 15 together quickly, and was well caught at long off by LucasoffC T Studd Six for 256 Bonnor joined Alick, and now the spectators received a treat in the shape of about the " tallest' hitting ever witnessed in cricket From the start the giant opened his shoulders, and though change after change of bowling was tried the efforts to separate the batsmen were fruitless Bonnor, when he had made several tourers, lifted Steel clean out of the ground for 6 and then A P Lucas went on The first ball Lucas sent down went fly has out of the ground for 6 Lucas's next over was a maiden, but his third was not, for Bonnor sent the first ball for 4, the second for, the third for 6 and the last for 4, in all 20 runs off four balls Lucas was taken off at this stage, and Bonnor was cheered again and again for his terrific hitting 300 and 400 went up, and the bowlers and fielders looked completely prostrated with the exception of Lord Harris and the Hon A Lyttelton, who worked as well at the finish as they did at the start. At last G o clock came, and Bonnor and Bannerman were still there, the former with 122 not out, and the latter 120 not out, and our total 423 for six wickets. Thus the game, which when we started our second innings looked altogether in favour of our opponents, resulted in a draw entirely in our favour. Such a complete change in the completion of a game of cricket has seldom occurred, and in this case the lookers on and our opponents received quite an unpleasant surprise Bonnor's score includes four hits each for 6 and 16 each for 4 He gave two chances, but neither was easy, and he deserves the highest praise for his really superb batting One of the sisters went fully 150 yards from the bar to where the ball pitched, and old cricketers on the ground said they never saw a better hit This is Bonnor a first century in England, and a similar re- mark will apply to Alick Bannerman, whose magnificent innings of 120 not out is absolutely free from any blemish He was at the wickets altogether about seven hours, and during that time he did not give the ghost of a chance, and maintained a perfect defence, while now and then he hit with a vigour which surprised those who look upon him as nothing but a stonewaller Alick had been at the wickets more than five hours, and had made 03, when Bonnor joined him, and yet the giant headed him at the finish The weather was delightful each day, and the attendance altogether was about 8000 and this number included Lord Londesborough and several other representatives of the nobility of England.
