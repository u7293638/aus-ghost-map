The weather wns lovely and the attendance large, tliore being about 10,000 on the ground. The Sydney innings was de void of interest on account of the 'tamo stylo of bat ting, The Victorians bowled nnd fielded grandly; xiuuiiur puriiuumny iiisiinguianeti mmaeii, umur- tunately towards the end of the innings lie ruptured a ligature of tbeanklo and had to retire. It is doubt ful whether ho will bo ablo to play on Saturday against tho Englishmen. Tha feature of to-day's play was at the commencement of tho oecoud inn ings of the Victorians, when M'Donncll and Black- bam were batting grandly, particularly the former. At noon exactly the Victorians took tbe field, nnd Banncrman and Murdoch, the two not-ouc men, took their places at the wickets. Tho Now South Wales captain had not quite recovered from his lameness of Saturday, but was quite at home with the bat. I Bruce opened from tlie pavilion, and Midwinter ' trundling from other end. Both bowlers were well on ! tho spot, nnd it wub not till 10 overs had been sent , down, scvcu of them maidens, that 80 appeared. ' After five more maidens lind been scut down, Banner- j man put Midwinter uppishly to the off, but no ono being near, three resulted. When three more maidona j had been recorded, Murdoch hit ono of Midwintor's bnrd back, and the bowler mado a splendid attempt at a catch, hut only just managed to save I runs. Murdoch now drovo Bruce linrd past mid-off for a brace, Bonnor grandly saving the 4. He then ; drove the colt in the same direction for a quartette, : 00 going up. At this stage a change was made by : Allan relieving Bruce, but runa cama still more j quickly, the century appearing amidst applause. | After a few more overs Allan changed enda and Boyle relieved Midwinter, bowling underhand slows. The game now became more lively, and 10'a went up in rapid succession till 1.70 appeared, both bats men scoring freely — Murdoch, 00 ; Banncrman, 02 ; both not out. Scott, at this stage, relieved Boyle, who had been getting punished severely, and this made a material difference in tho batting, which again became of the stonawall character. Sevoa maidens having been Bent down, Murdoch's time now came, as lie was grandly canght by Blackbam at tbo wickets off Ailau, and had to retnrn after a patiently-played 71. 2—71—186 appeared aB Davis went to tbe vacant crease. The 140 wns not long in appearing. When four more runs had been addedan adjournment for lunch took place. On resuming, Allan and Scott again trundled, and Bannerman with a triplet, and Davis with a brace, brought the score to 149, thus topping tho Victorian total. A couple to Bannerman, and then Davis was clean bowled by Scott, tho board showing 8— C — 157. Jones was the next mun, and the score waa raised very Blowly lo 108, when Bannerman was run out, 4—78—108. Alick had played a grand in nings, without giving the ghost of a chance. Garrett joined Jones, nnd tho gamo became very f ut, the new comer scoring freely, nnd tho 170 and than 180 soon appeared, Garrett bit Scott hard to tiro off, and Bonnor fa; (aTfag;th6;4, trod in' the ' (rattier !sindTjl wrenched his ankle badly, which necessitated , hirgS retirement fromtheifield,,hia place being filled J.
