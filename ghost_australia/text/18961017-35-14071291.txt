TWO WHEELS. A CAMP ON THE LAPSTONE. The rough road near Bull's camp had delayed us a good deal, and we worked our way down to Faulconbridge curve against a northerly gust of wind with much abjuration of teamsters , but it was still early when we run through the Spring stood crossing, where a severed goods train method along the siding Lightly, with the gusts behind us now, we slid by the half a yy stoned Oriental Hotel and dropped over the hill in an eddy of red sand It was a morning of the cheers fullest, springy me cry sense of the yy ord The sky was specked here and there with the arrest of cloudlets The road was all glint with heavy leay ea and (sad to say) botlleglass Every bush Host er had a flush of colour in it, as if the sap I an to its petals like blood to the cheek of a blushing girl The rail way, Unit all down these ridges playa kissing the ring with the road was an added beauty its delicate threads of shining steel la) along the heaving bosom of the range, in the old tracks and on deserted embankments there was the the green of new grass , the white stone gatehouses at each crossing had their spots of wind colour on one a scarlet climbing geranium, about another the opulent bloom of wistaria, while a third was set with purple stocks and golden oranges shone from behind it Near Valley Heights (Blue Mountain nomenclature is not happy ) ttt o small girls waved at us a big bunch of wild flou ors I suppose they have names, these floyy ors-probabl) names half a yard long in small type , some of them looked like potentates grow- ing on a ti-tree, and others v ere violets on hedgehog wire stems At Karnbrar, as we struggled up an over-study pinch, a small boy) came down gleefully past is on a very old tri c) ole, his bare legs paddling energetically on the mary pedals Not another soul did we see in these cheery morning hours till the tram went skidding through the Blaxland crossing with a grunt of disgust at being pulled up in its rush to I Penrith Blue Mountain nomenclature, I repeat, is not happy It was not or less so than when the name of the real discoverer, the man whose reasoning and by those leading broke this prot tous!) impenetrable mountain barrier, was tacked on to a petty platform where it cannot even reign alone Wentworth and Lawson hay of christened thriving little townships, Blaxland boasts of nothing but a railway platform, for all the fields about it shriek themselves " Waste " and " tYascoo " again, and insistently' " Wascoe " He, not Wentis orth-he, not Lawson gave us the boundless West, and all that remains to him is a she 1 and some yards of decking here, and beyond Katoomba a B on a tree stump and his share of an inscription even less true than it is grammatical The road dips to the left below this platform, and presently drops into an open green space yy hero teamsters' camp Tyy of teams were there as we came ii; by levy of it, and the sight of the fire suggested breakfast We stopped The men were friendly enough in ne' , one billy more, they said, made no difference to the fire , if we liked (but we didn't, knowing bush tea of old we could take some of theirs, and save boiling a fresh lot of yy tor But they were not exactly companionable One of them gruffly half explained that he was tired of talking to bicyclists "Ever) blessed airwomen," he said, tells us ye are cutting up the roads Can't he tell us something we don't know ? These hero roads are made out of cheese, and a baby in a perambulator would cut them up We don't want to it's harder on our horses than it is on your wheels" He was quite willing to use broader tired wheels if the Government would supply them, but he was of opinion that if the Government wished to save money on road mending it should not save it out of his pocket Then he became silent, and we made our camp a little way off The wind, such as it was, set in one direction, and talk from the other camp made itself very audible Horse stones, of course, were pre- dominant, notably some relating to an animal 28 j ear old A swagman who was sharing the big musters' Ire infest grow incredulous " Dicken, oldman, Dicken," he said " By the Hogan's ghost, and it's a fact," said the grub! teamster " You could hobble him and tie his head down to the hobbles, and then yon couldn't catch him Jim Tynan was the only man I knew that could But he was a terror was Jim, when he set out to do a thing he just did it, and that was all about it I saw him once with that old bay I was telling you of-him with the roach back He'd had a three weeks'' spell, which was more than Jim's horses usually got and when Tynan went to mount him who backed away from him and went off up the paddock Jim looked at him and shook his head, but didn't say anything , then he took off his coat, just as if he was going to bed, and hung it over the top rail, and put his hat on a post, and took his boots off and put them by the post, and tucked his trousers up to his kn as he hadn't got any socks on and then he started after the horse and caught him and that time the beast bucked to wards him and the stirrup leather broke, and then the girth broke, and Jim went on with the saddle between his legs, and he came down with out in and lit on the b iv barebacksKl, and took him the worst ride lie over did since he was foaled Oh, he was none too bad a rider, was Tim Tynan '" There was a prolonged silence after this "I wash cycles would buck or bleak away or do something," said Ted in a half whisper, " it must be delightful to tell stories like that " Presently the talk across to of way flies ed again Horses being but ed, woman (as the next most important subject) came up for discussion The teamster expressed admiration for the Hawkesbury damsels, especially for their suc- But the swa_rsnian's turn had come He pooh poohed the "Wh), Bill," he said Rd was the second teamster, who came from Sw aggie's dis trict You remember Kate Johnson, don't you f-her that hold her head so high ?" " My oath said Bill, gravely , " I've seen her that when she cried the tears 'd ran down her back " "That girl Swaggie turned to the gruff man-" was six and a half foot high I ain't tell- ing no boss about it I remember her at a dance on e A young fellow asked her for a dance (do you remember Tom Catts, Bill ? tiny little beggar he was and she looked at him and says, '111 give you a dance on my) knees, if J on like, bah),' She says And he was a perky little idiot-oh, Bill a'" " Aug-gh," ground Bill, " you could tell him for a fool-his legs bent at the knees " " Well, he was a fool and he plagued her for a dance So she stood up with him, and when the music started she just swung line right round the room office and let go, and he fell all of a heap up in a corner And then he wasn't contented " " Some men," said Bill, " would grumble if you hanged them, because they wasn't drowned " The gruff man broke in decisively I don't call that girl any good of a girl 1 That's not fair treatment of a man-first wipe the floor with him, and then chuck him away Ne girl's got a right to treat a man as if he was a dishcloth " He paused, and summed up with a rebuking look at the swagman " I'm not well pleased with your female acquaintances your's and Bill's " This last was apparently an afterthought, to lessen the blow There was only one subject now left for dis erosion We had finished our meal, and busied ourselves with strapping our kits on the machines As I stooped to oil Ted's crank axle a whiff of wind blow over to us some last words from the other camp " And he drank that tumbler of rum right off," Bmd Bill, " and got on his horse and was off to Gerringong " " What an artistic sense of fitness those men have," murmured Ted " Doesn't that just sound the right place to go to, under the circum stances ''" f- one day, under different circumstances, we Too will go to Gerringong In the meanwhile, we had the Lapstone before us a delightful shadow dappled slope of load that swung round a mile and, to! an old massive of stone bridge, all white of orange, brown, and orcuniy-yellow gleaming through the tangle of light woods and festooning tree pors And beyond the bridge the road in will back-it's arm round the bridge" was, in the apeak-and out viciously into steep roi lie along the gully side to keep itself from slipping into an unseen stream bed, and came out at last with " wriggle of satisffl/itlon-tAustiallan roads have not much sense of tbiipiotnrcsquo)--iipoÂ» was nice" I will and the widening Nepean Plains, in which Ti with lay steaming before us, an island of darker smoke beyond the shimmering line of hazes that marks the river All that blaze of bare land in front, and the Lopstono'a coolness just behind, surely there never was a road in such a hurry to get hot We were in a hurry, too, now The machines raced each other across the reappearing railway (for the gales, somehow, were open), and down the long white track that streaks Lmu PI ins from falls To river We shot the river, quivering with the nimbus of a long goods train, and spent a sleepy day in the shadows of the great mountain cleft, by which the range above Illawarra and the range behind Capertoo pour out their mingled waters to make a regatta for the dusty metropolis JACK.
