HOW MAEK TWAIN WAS SOLD IN NEWARK. The Newark Frets contains the following exposition of what " Mark Twain" terms " A Wicked Fraud," perpetrated on him during bis recent visit to that city:—It is seldom pleasant to tell oa oneself, but sometimes it is a sort of relief to a man to make a sad confession. I wish to unburden my mind now, and yet I almost believe that I am moved to do it more because I long to bring censure upon another man than because I desire to pour balm upon my wounded heart (I don't know what balm is, but I believe it is the correct expression to use in this connection—never having seen any balm.) ¥ou may remember that I lectured in Newark lately for the young gentlemen of the Clayonian society i I did at any rate. During tbe afternoon of that day I was talking with one of the young geutlemea just referred to, and he said he had an uncle who, from some cause or other, seemed to have grown permanently bereft of all emotion. And with tears in his eyes this young man said, " Oh, if I could only see him laugh once more ! Oh, if I could only see him weep !" I was touched. I could never withstand distress. I said, " Bring him to" my lecture. Til start him for you." "Ob, if I could but do it 1 If you could but do it, all our family would bless you for evermore—for he is so very dear tons. Oh, my benefactor, can you make him laugh can you bring soothing tears to those parched orbs ? I was profoundly moved. I said : my son, bring the old party around. I have got some jokes in that, lecture that will make him laugh if there is any laugh in him , and if they miss fire I have got some others that will make him cry or Mil him, one or the other.' Then the young man blessed me, and wept on my neck, aud blew his nose ou my coat tail, aud went after his uncle. He placed him in full view, and in the second row of benches that night, and I began oa him. I tried Mm with mild jokes, then with severe ones; I dosed him with bad jokes and riddled him with good ones; I fired old stale jokes into him, and peppered him fore and aft with red-hot new ones ; I warmed up to my work, and assaulted him right and left, in front and behind ; I fumed and sweated and charged and routed till I was hoarse and sick, and frantic and furious ; but I never moved him once—I never started a smile or a tear ! Never a ghost of a smile, and never a suspicion of moisture ! I was astounded. I closed the lecture at last with one despairing shriek—with one wild burst of humour, and hurled a joke of supernatural atrocity full at him ! Then I sat down bewildered and exhausted. The president of the society came up and bathed my bead with cold water, and said : " What made you carry on so towards the last ?" I said I was trying to make that confounded old fool laugh, in the second row. And he said : " Well, you were wasting your time, because he is deaf and dumb, and as blind as' a badger." Now, was that any way for that old man's nephew to impose on a stranger aud orphan like me i I simply ask you, as a man and a brother, if that was any way for Mm to do ? A successor has at length been found to Sir Richard Mayne in the Commissionership of Metropolitan Police.

Colonel Henderson has, up to the present time, tilled the positions of Surveyor- General of Prisons and Chairman of the Directors of onvict Prison®
