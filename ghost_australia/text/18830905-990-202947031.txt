An instance of mismanagement on the part of the railway authorities has just come to our knowledge which deserves public mention. It appears thaton the 17th inst sixteen trucks of sheep, containing 1,500 in the flock, were trucked at Parachilna at noon. The engine did not then leave but stayed till four o'clock, reaching Quorn after midnight and Terowie at half- past six in the morning. At Terowie retrucking bad to be performed, the sheep not arriving at Adelaide till late on Saturday night. It was not, in fact, till the Sunday morning that they were taken to a paddock and their wants attended to, the poor animals having been kept all that time without food or water. If this is not cruelty to animals what is ? Who is to blame but the Government ? Instead of bringing these poor sheep through in twenty-four hours things were so badly—nay, abominably—managed, or rather mismanaged, that 1,500 sheep, as pervious to hunger and thirst as ourselves, were forced to starve for something like forty-eight hours! This is only one instance out of many of the incapacity of our Railway Department. Had a private compaay been guilty of anything like such cruelty the whole country would have cried shame, and they would assuredly have suffered for their misdeeds. Lstthe Hon. Mr Eamsay, Commissioner of Bailways, stoop down a moment from his elevation in the Cabinet and reply. We draw the attention of OHr readers to the advertisment respecting the visit of Bishop Kennion to Port Augusta. A meeting confined to members of the congregation of St Augustine's Church, will be. held on Friday in the school-room at 7 30 p.m., the Bishop being present. On Saturday, at 3 p.m., the consecration of the church takes place. We subjoin a few particulars from the special form of service to be used, with which probably few people are familiar. The Bishop, attended by his chaplains and registrar, is accompanied to the west door of the cburchby the clergy, choir and committee. Here he is met by the wardens, who deliver the petition to consecrate the building, the same having been read, and the Bishop having signified his willingness to carry out the prayer of the petition, the procession moves up the church, the bishop and choir singing alternately the verees of the 24th psalm. The Bishop then, in his chair within the altar rails, receives the deeds of the church which, together with the petition, are laid upon the holy table. Turning to eastward he says " peace be to this bouse." Certain suffrages then follow, afterwards collects; the Bishop then blesses the building and offeis up intercessions for these who minister, who shall be baptized, who shall be confirmed, who shall be married, for communicants, bearers, worshippers and penitents. " Then all standing up the sentence of consecration shall be read , aloud by the registrar, and signed by the Bishop, and by him shall be ordered with the petition and other deeds to be duly recorded sod registered in the Diooitu Registry. When this has been done the Bitihup standing forward shall say:—I declare this church of St. Augustine, Port Augusta, to be now consecrated and set apart to God for ever in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost' Evensong, with proper psalms and lessons is tben srd, the Bishop deliver iog the sermon." We unikrstanr 1 that the collection will go to the church building {and.
