RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE A CORRESONDENT forwards us tha excerpt from the Ipswich letter of the "Age" with a request hat we publish it, as it is of general inter "Standard" must have met the No ghost, for it seems to have lost itself the last issue an article is publis h is one of the most contemptible at to stir up religious strife that has ever in the Australian Press. It is published purely a political purpose, as three of the etors of that paper are to contest seats at coming election. The article states that one of the teachers of the Girls' Grammar School was given notice terminating her engagement, and that, it is rumoored, the notice is in conse- quench of her religious opinions, she having placed herself under the influence and instruc- tion of Father Horan, and on this account was found unsuitable. Father Horan states emphatically that never on any occasion has the young lady in question mentioned the subject of religion to him, and, further, as far as Father Horan knows, she has never spoken of religion to any of the other priests in Ipswich, and no one would be more surprised than Father Horan himself to hear that the teacher in question contemplated changing her religious belief. It was a remarkable conclusion for any paper to arrive at if the slightest inquiry had been made. The policy of the "Standard" seems to be the use of every means, no matter how unfair, in order to promote its political purposes. A drowning man will clutch at a straw. But the result will be a miserable failure. The may be seen in every line of the article, and the time is not far dis- tant when the" Standard" and those who are connected with it will sink into political oblivion.
