?Chapteu V. It was Christmas day, and Captain Am brose, having dined alone, sat looking — not, according to old country traditions, into the blazing suceestiveness of -a., fire.'-'' but out through -the open. French window at the red glory of the evening sun. upon the tops of the trees that bordered his' well-kept' lawn. - 1 will not, after the evil example of. too many modern story tellers, describe, to the fold of a. curtain or the pattern of a mantel ornament, the room in whioh the , lonely man sat.. Let it be enough to -say'; that there was evidence of much wealth, directed by 'not a little taste and culture, the'; whole, however, lacking the refining touch of woman's pre sence, for the captain wa3 daughterless, and had been a widower for many years. Therefore it '\wastlmtl one could almost have'pitied'him,~ as, with an untasted glass of wine at his elbow and a forgotten cigar between his fingers, he sat there in a reverie that was no pleasant one, or the deep -frown- on his forehead lied. But even ugly thoughts will not always drive away an after.-dinner drowsiness, when the, thermometer has been all day at 90 in the shade, and, presently Captain Ambrose slept. Slept, f and. dreamt what he had often dreamt of ., late — a 'painful retrospective dream. . ? And ;'thia was - his-' dream. ' . 'Hayeyou ever sailed' with me' before, my man ?' - said the , captain of the . Venezuela, standing by., the',' cabin' '-door -' in the break of, th'e' 'poop, and addressing' a seaman who happened to pass near .Kim. ' Your face seems familiar to me.' It was about the middle of the first dog watch, and the Venezuela, a large iron clipper, about a week out from London for Melbourne, was running seven or eight knots on a wind that developed every now and then into a smart but shortlived squall/ The man spoken to did not immediately reply. He looked ; first away at the bleak horizon,, then up at the taut-weather rigging/ and finally full at the captain. \ - ?' 'The face of your father's son -ought; to^-be familiar to you,' he said, then, in a lowjvoice.1' ??What? WJtat did you say?' was' the6 astonished answer. ' I said,' returned the man, in louder tones, ' that your brother's face ought not to be* alto- gether .strange to you J' * ' 'Great Heaven !' exclaimed the captain, ' do you mean to say that — that you are ? ' ' That I am Mark Ambrose ! Yes ! — as surely as you are Gilbert I' i ' Come — come inside here,' said the captain, speaking in tho strange, -mechanical mapner,of one who has received a violent' ahock.^and leading the way iuto the cabin, where the steward was just lighting the lamp. The Venezuela carried no passengers, and so, when the man had left them, the two were alone, as face to face under the swinging light they stood, and looked at each other. The 'captain was a tall man, the seaman a short one. The captain's hair and beard were brown and well-trimmed ; the seaman's grey and shaggy. The captain's features were clear-cut and aquiline ; the seaman's blunt and rugged. The captain's voice was clear and resonant ; the seaman's deep and thunderous as the surf on some hollow shore. Nevertheless they were brothers, and the captain's next words acknow ledged the relationship. 'You are Mark, Bure enough,1' he said, 'But how changed'! You weren't lost in the Honduras, then, after all.?' ' The ship was lost ; but, as you see, / was not.' ' ' I am glad of it,' said the captain,' ' You don't believe me, I see,' he added, 'finding that the other only smiled bitterly in 'reply. ' 'No!'' growled Murk, 'I don't*! It's a lie !' ' Why should you think so ':' 'Why? Because I know you, Brother Gilbert ! — let that be enough ! You are-7io« glad to find me alive ! You are sorry ! — so sorry that, if you safely could,' you'd put me out of the way with all possible speed ! I know all about'it !' ' About what ?' aud the captain's florid face turned pale with anger, or apprehension, or. both. ' About old Thistlethwaite's money.' The captain-Went to the door and locked- it. 'Sit down,' he said, bringing a bottle from a locker and taking a couple of glasses from a swinging tray overhead. ' Sit down and tell me what you do- know'.'' '' Why, I know how' the money's left, first to me, and — failing v 'my - appearance within1 twelve months from the1 old 'man's1' death— to you.' ' And when did yon learn all this ?' ' Not till we were.; well down Channel, worse luck ! There's a'Whitehaven man in the crew, and 'I saw 'all about it in a news naner he lent me.'.';-C' *- 'Ah. well, it's all true enough !' said t lie- captain, with an effdrtf'tb: appear easy and un concerned. 'And ' though^ of course, I was counting on the money, I must put up with the change in my prospects as best I can. You don't drink?' 'I never do, now,' said the other, putting aside the glass which the captaiu' bad filled for him. .' It's rather late in the day to stop it,' perhaps, after it's brought me down' to ' a common foremast Jack ; but I 'haven't tasted any for three years.' ' Oh, indeed ?' said Gilbert Ambrose in a1 tone that lie vainly strove to render a grati fied one ; but the seaman readhis thought, and smiled again^-a bitter, contemptuous' smile. , 'And why have you shipped iwith'-me'!'' asked the captain after a pause, in -'whiclAhe keenly scrutinised his brother's weatherbeaten features. \- 'I wanted a ship, and the Venezuela Buitedr me as well as., another.' - * 'And of course you'll oommunicate with the executors as -soon as wo get to -? Mel bourne.' y-. 'Ay, or sooner, if we should Lappen.to get within heaving distance of a'homeward-bound. I've a~*letter ready written,'1 - N ,'Oh,,you have? Well,) there's not much ch'ance of your ? getting,, it sent home that ?way.' ' , 'I know there isn't. But Ten on the safe side, anyhow.'1 ' . ' ' Yes,' 'said the captain), 'with a curious ab stracted tone in his voice.'' ' On the safe 'side ; yes, certainly. But don't think f- — with' sudden', fierceness of manner—' *t!iat*»I'll'put the ship a' yard out of her course 'to' suit 'you or anybody else !',_ , ', ' ' . - * ?_ '', J' You»needn't'-teir:me' that, Gilbert Am broBe;'\'-was', the 'calm ' answer. ' I know you tootweil.' ? j '' Perhaps.you don't. . Perhaps you've some thing to learn from mo yet,' said the captain, with calm ominousneBS.,., 'What name did you sign articles tinder '?' John Green, wasn't ifcw, - -' . Mark Ambrose nodded. \- 'Well then, get away for'rard, John Green,' said Gilbert, rising' with a dangerous gleam in his eye. ' 'As John Green you shall be treated in my ship — neither better nor worse than anybody eke.' ' . ' As for the better,' growled Mark, as he left the cabin, ' I don't expect it. And for the worse,' he added, to hiodself, as he walked forward, ' I wouldn't trust youy if you only dared.' ' Man overboard !' It was about four bells in the first watch, or about five hours after the Btrange interview between the two brothers, that the cry which thrills every seaman's heart came wildly from the forecastle of the Venezuela. The ship, with a smart breeze, had bee-i going free on the starboard tack, whin a sudden in crease of wind had rendered it necessary to shorten sail, and it was while helping to stow the main-royal sail that the man had fallen from . the yard. Scarcely had the hoarse cry time . to be echoed by another voice before the first mate cut away a life-buoy, and scarcely had the buoy touched the water before the captain 'was on deck. ' ' ' Who is it ?' he sung out. r 'Green, sir,' answeredTliaif ! a dozen voice?',, as several of the crew, expecting the ship to be brought to the wind,- and anxious to volun teer, ran- towards tho boats on the skids. Anxiously/ . too, the man at the wheel atrained'his ears for tho expected order,' and wonderingly the mate looked at his superior, when, 'instead of the orders' to put the helm down and back the main yard, came, short; and sharp; the words — ''Hold;on with that boat !' It' was a clear moonlight night ; the squall was slackening as suddenly as it had arisen, and as the ship was not making more than T knbta, the men, eager .to save a cb'mrade's life, could scarcely believe their ears. '' 'The boat would live easily, tir,'' the mate yenturcd to say. . ' I am of a different'opinion,' said the cap tain. ' And, besides, to put the helm down, now would take the foremast out of ' the ship.' ' If we were to let go the t'gallant halyards, sir?' suggested tlie mate eagerly. ' That will do !' was tho sharp answer. ' I am captairTof this ship ! Go forward, men !' . Slowly' and reluctantly the men obeyed. Well did they know that the ship could have been hove to without any difficulty, andVx* burly boatswain only expressed the feelid y of them all when, upon getting out of earshot oE the captain, he declared,' with a tremendous oath',- that it was nothing short of murder.' ,';A pretty state of things,' 'he Baid, ' if a man's to be drownded, on a fine night like this ere, like a rat in a bucket, -without a blessed, hand bein' stirred to save him !' 'There's a tidy jump of a sea on, too,' re marked another man. ' ' 'Sea be bio wed !' Too much sea for a racing' houtrigger, may be, but nothing' to speak of where a man's life's in question. Poor devil ! I hope, for his own sake, he ain't much- of a swimmer ; his sufferin's will be the sooner over. And as for' the 'skipper, I'll make him smart ' for this ai soon as we gets to Melbourne, as sure 'as my name's Bill Fut tock!'' - ~ ' ,-. ' 'But'-'the''castftway,''»3 it 'happened, was a. good swimmer, and, '-though half, stunned by his fall from such a Keightr, soon found himself mechanically striking but in the moonlit water.'*- Half blinded' at first, in a few mo ments hfo vision cleared, and, as he rose on the crest; of 'one wave; he saw 'something white showing ?'clear against' the dark surface of the next — it was'the'Hfe-buoy. With half a dozen strokes' he reached'1 it, and, passing it under his 'armpits, raised himself to look out for 'the ship' — hove to, by this time, he' thought, beyond a doubt. Up the long slope of the sea he rose — eagerly he looked round—there wa9 the ship ! '' How far she's run, beforo they could round: her to !' he thought, as, after 'but a momen tary' glimpse, the black ridge of 'a wave shut out the welcome sight again. ' Again he rose gently on a hill of water, and, knowing this time exaotly where' to turn his eyes, had space for a longer look. , 'Farther still, she seems,' he thought. ' My God !' he added, aloud— ' she's not hove- to at all 1 She has kept on her course, and left me to perish !' 1 Down iuto the trough he sank again, but, before: he began to ascend the succeeding wave, he nnderstood'Jt nil. 'Murderer!' he shouted, as tho heaving water once more gave him a sight of the fast receding ship'. The hoarse cry sounded far. over the lonely waste of waters ; the lost man disappeared' from the crest of the ridge ; and — Gilbert Ambrose awoke, bathed in perspira tion, from a vision which had filled in with horrible completeness the details which were wanting to his actual, waking experience. The daylight had almost died out of the room, but, dark against the dim light of the open window, l there stood a silent' and mysterious figure. ' The captain started ujpwitha hoarse oryf upsetting a decanter with a^ crash— and, dart ing at the figure, seized it. by the breast and shook it with a strange, uncalled for violence,, bora of the strain upon his - nerves. ' Who are you ?' he cried, ''Ma Heaven'* name, who are you J' V ' My dear father,' said a voice1 quietly, 'he calm! I did not intend to startle you.1' ?. ?:. The captain shrank back, trembling. 'I, must, be dreaming still !' he mattered. 'I thought that was Jackie voice !'- . ? . .? . ' And so it was,' answered the other. ' Jack's voice and Jack himself, , as you will see if you'll strike a light.' ???'.- . . ??'?;? ? ? 'The captain lit the gas. He was pale still, and his hands shoo .but he, had regained most of his habitual self command. ? ,- 'Sly dear; boy,'- he said, seizing -both hands of - the sun-browned 'young ' fellow whose acquaintance we have already made in , Queensland.' 'Consider! all these .* years without writing, and then to come upon me out of the dark like a ghost ! Why it would shake the nerves of; an elephant!'.' - ? '[ It was' rather ill-considered, sir, I admit, but :I got your man to ..let me steal a march upon you, as this is ?Christmas night, and I have a' strange Christmas present to make you.

Then I , wen^; to England, and without making myself ..knoiyri, found, that you had settled down here. . -vSg.

Then I xnadeit.my.^busiT .ness.to'watch you, and saw that, bold as was - the .face you kept to the world, the devil of remorse was eating your heart out. So I said to myself, 'This is better! Let him go on thinking himself a murderer, and nothing I can do will punish him half so much.' ? ' -Well, things were going on in this way, when, one^day, about a year back,. I dropped . across an old. chap that came from Scarrosk, Jerry Holt by name; He'd been out here a good many yeara, and I didn't know him; but he knew me in ' a moment, and spoke' to \- me. ' He was' dreadfully hard up, and wanted to. go to. Queensland,' where he'd lived a long ? time before . so I paid his passage for him on condition hsM never. mention to. anybody that ? he'd seen me alive. You see, Gilbert, my heart was still hard against you, and' I was afraid . if you found out I wasn't drowned you'd have the load taken off your mind. But somehow from hat time my, feelings began to change. . Whether it; was. the falling in with a man that had known us both when we were innocent little boys, or not, I can't say ; but at any rate . I began to see that if I went on wearing yon to your grave, as I was doing, I wasn't any better than a murderer myself ; and then, just at the right time, down comes this fine young ; chap of.' yours froin Queensland, and. Btrikes while.thj iron's hot. .-....- ? 'It 'seems' oddly .enough that old Jerry Holt was on the' same' station as he was, and got speared by the blacks, so, when he wa8 dying he thought lie ought' nt to keep the .promise: he had ' made to me 'any longer, es pecially as he Lad just found out that morn ing that Jack was an Ambrose. Well, he tells Jack where he thinks I'm to be found in Melbourne, and down comes Jaok from Queensland without losing a minute. 'And bo, to cut matterB short, he hadn't much trouble in persuading me to come here to-night with him, and give you a surprise In honor of the day. And ail I can say,' con cluded Bugged old Mark, 'is that if your repentance is as sincere as my forgiveness, there is no reason why. we three shouldn't - yet have a merry Christmas night of it !' .
