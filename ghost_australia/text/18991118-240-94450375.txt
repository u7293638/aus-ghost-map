An Artful Beggar. A beggar who was sentenced :o 14 days at 31arylbono, by hi~ merhods would seem to haro been a fisherman in h-I better days A constable who watched the whole preceedings sasW im throw a crn- cf bread lnto the read. ie stos l and walted till the fish ho hoped to h!ook camo up. Presently a lady approached, and the be-ar rushed into the road, snatched up the br.td, and began to gnaw at it ravenously. The lady stopped, gaTzed sympatheticaly at the apparently hcang- man, and gaTe him twopnce. When she had pased by the man thore the bait into the road, with the same happy reslt. Then he waor ar- reted, and hi bag examined. H had on him thir teen pennies and a threepenny piece. That wa a good retmr fer a cr~3t of bread. Every day some noea method of getting money out of the charitabla is hit ponr. Lately a man has been going roand with a pla-ard stating that he lost his voice in trying to save a drowning child; while another-and perhaps this is the most acda?ions statement a beggar ever =ado -has " been a toctotaller for 50 yea-s, and was then r-- over by a brewers dray." Do naught to-day thou mayat regret to morzow ; For tho3,h to-day may die, ita ghost will liager And hauns thee with a cetaeleo_ igh of ormaw, And point rmorsse with an ccusing finger. Say no unkindly word. or, like an ember In a dead bire, a breath will blow it living : Tho worst of punibhmenta is to re member, When tears are rain and wrongs are paut forglving.
