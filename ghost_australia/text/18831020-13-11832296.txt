SATURDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1883. The readiness with which the Victorian Parliament has recognised the, necessity of terminating its session at an early date, in order that Ministers may prepare for the Anti-Cancer Convention, is a proof in itself of the earnest desire which is entertained for the success of the new national movement. Mr. SERVICE has put his heart in the work. His spirit has animated the Legislature, and from the addresses which are daily pouring in it would appear that the population, which at first was rather acquiescent than energetic, has come to regard the subject as a living issue. The magnitude of the danger is realised, and also the nobility of the task before us. All is well at home, and the hope now to be entertained is that the Victorian Premier will be successful in influencing those of the Governments of the sister colonies which do not as yet seem to have altogether risen to the occasion. The correspondence between Mr. STUART and Mr. SERVICE published yesterday would be read with interest, and those who are most earnest about seeming accord in Australia and victory abroad will be the most ready to agree with the Victorian Premier that the convention should be constituted upon national rather than party lines That is to say the Convention should be composed not only of the politicians who are in office to day but also of those AY he will, in the north nary course of events, have power to morrow The issue does not concern one party more than another Federals and Constitutionalists have both of them the same ambition to make the country great and to keep it pure so that its children may decline their birth place with pride, and not with any sense of humiliation 01 shame And Radical and Constitutionalist both see that if whole groups of the Pacific Islands, one after another, are to be transformed into penal settlements, our morality at home and our character abroad must alike suffer We shall box of the prostitution which is too foul for J Hope in our bay cent Mjiuid these inland devilry which are too dangerous for old world civilisation will establish Kerosene congenial slums Australia would come to be regarded as the refuse heap of modern society, and that is what it would be Mon and women should be able to idealise their country, even as the English and the Swiss and the Americans do theirs to day Given a free nation, and its children NOW it " in the light that never wason season land' But the "patriot " capture" could scarcely exist about a country which complacently received the oil scourges of humanity and though the convicts are not to be absolutely let loose on our mainland, we can no more dissociate Australia from its islands than America can be separated from its as yet unsettled back states These are the ideas which animate the would be founders of the Anti Convict League, and they belong to no party and no creed Missionary, merchant, and politician are united in the cause, the poor are as much interested as the nell, the protectionist is entitled to be as fervid as the freetrade and as Mr St RIver submits, it is well to make this fact patent in the constitution of the Convention No doubt Mr iSicrutT may argue that the one set of men being in accord with the community xxiii represent it as well as a mixed commission but the moral effect is lost, and the danger of ultimate discord e pi m J [Dinan nature has v> weaknesses, and the politician, of all men, is the least free from them 'The rule with past con four senses has been that so soon as the resolutions have been announced, the Opposition has been moved to declare that, however good the intention, the plan adopted was defective and dangerous and intolerable free, man) a promising scheme has been destroyed in the bud In this case discussion after an event would mean that we should show a weakening front, whereas what's xx wanted is that the scheme of the convention, should have behind it a united Australia Union would mean resolution on our past, and resolution would mean the accomplishment of our purpose, for Victory xxiii go to the strongest xxiii life would be convict I am mci s of the New Hebrides are clever enough to take advantage of any party criticism after the event, but we may be sure that they would be powerless as against a determined Australia The precedents quoted by Mr fentvici 18 most valuable The Canadian Conven- tion w which gave birth to the Dominion xx is composed equally of all parties Uto representation was made national, and so "blond based upon a peoples "xxiii,' expressed by the whole of a people's representatives, should be the Anti Convict League of Australasia Judging from recent telegrams, it would seem that the Gladstone Ministry are determined if possible to carry out their fire peated promise of bringing to an end the occupation of Egypt by British troops Official papers recently published state that Sir EVELYN Moon, who has been engaged in the re- organisation of the native army, has, in reply to inquiries made by the British Go-. x ei ancient, declared himself favourable to the early withdrawal of the bulk of the British away from Egypt, and has expressed his readiness to be answer able for the preservation of order with the entire force under his command The Pall Mall Gazette, also a journal generally supposed to be the confidence of the Ministry, asserts that three regiments of British troops xxiii soon be ordered home, and that the withdrawal of the remainder of the in my of occupation xxiii he decided upon when the Cabinet meets in November next So many statements have been mails from time to time by members of the Ministry as to the period when the British occupation of Egypt is over menace, that the public has naturally grown rather sceptical on the subject, while in some quarters it is thought that the protestations of -Ministers are intended rather for the satisfaction of then Radical supporters, who have all along chafed at the ton tinued occupation, than as announce ments of the real intentions of the Cox eminent Although there may he some truth in this view of the matter, the statements referred to will none the less give use to a feeling of uneasiness lest the Ministry should allow themselves to be urged on by a section of their followers into taking a step of the most vital moment to the interests and safety of the British Empire the declaration of Sir EVELYN WOOD will certainly not tend to reassure those who believe that the presence of British troops is the sole guarantee for the maintenance of peace and order in Egypt 'The general who negotiated the shameful and humiliating treaty with the Boers has already shown himself a compliant agent for carrying out the will of ns official superiors, and the fact that his opinion on the present occasion was given in reply to inquiries made by the British Government," will only confirm those who doubt whether it represents the real views of this distinguished officer For no rational person can believe that a native army, even if largely officered by English men, can be relied upon when the last British regiment has been withdrawn from the country All expouoncc,all history, contradicts such a notion Can anyone imagine that British rule in India would be secure if it was maintained only by native armit"-, though all the officers were English? 'The special circumstances of Egypt moreover, only bring out the ghosts folly and absurdity of supposing that the Government of the KHEDIVE could last long if it relied altogether upon.tW' native army organised by Sir Eve«» WOOD A strong man like MMi_.M-r As might maintain the independence of Egypt, though his power was based upon an army of Turks and Arabs rather than of native Egyptians His successors, SAID and ISMAIL, though men of far less ability, were able to keep going the system that had been bequeathed to them by the illustrious founder of their dynasty But the campaign of lolelKcbir swept that system away The old Egyptian army has vanished, and li WUK Pasha, the present Khedive, is admittedly a weak man, fit indeed to be the puppet governor of a power Lko 1 n land, but quite incapable of sway in by his own strength the discordant elements of which the country is composed No one who really understands the true state of Egypt can doubt for a moment that the withdrawal of the last led coated Englishman from the land of the Nile will be the signal for a revolution with what result no one can predict, most probably the snatch me" of the prize so rashly thrown away by some foreign power, that will certainly not make the interest of England the primary object of its concern All the results of last years operations will have been heedlessly thrown away, and England. will be stultified and limited in the eyes of the world But this is not the whole of the matter. The question of the occupation of Egypt is closely bound up with that of the control of the Suez Canal Once let England lose her hold upon the Nile valley, and there is no certainty that she will be assured of the free navigation of the canal But it is scarcely necessary to point out what this would mean to England and to all the eastern portions of the British Empire As is shown man able article in the August number of the Nineteenth Cailiti if by Mr LÜW VRD Dien, in which the writer contends that England ought to purchase the Canal, more than four fifths of the whole of the traffic that passes through it is carried under the Union Jack Last year 5,198 steamers passed between Suez and Port Said, of which 256') were British vessels France came next with the paltry total of 165 ships Considering the rapid growth of the Eastern dependencies of the British Empire, India, South Africa, and Australasia, this proportion is likely to increase in the coming years 'The Suez Canal will become of scarcely less importance to Great Britain than the English Channel itself to secure the free passage of the Mediterranean, former English Government thought it worth while to conquer and hold Gibraltar and Malta 'to make the Mediterranean of any Ashantis equally necessary for England to keep Egypt, now that she has gained possession of that country But it is not England alone that is vitally concerned in the future of Egypt These colonies have also a great stake in the land of the Nile The growth of Australasia, the in creasing commerce and communication between it and Europe, render the possession of this precious waterway as necessary to is as to the mother country And yet it seems possible that we may have to look on and see our most vital interests, present and future, recklessly, and with almost in conceivable fatality, thrown away by rulers who seem utterly unable to use to the occasion, or to realise to what an extent the interests of the English race throughout the world depend upon the soundness of their decision in the present crisis lins grave question is another example of the necessity that exists for these colonies to have some effective voice in deciding upon matters that we really affect their interests As things now stand these mo continually in danger of being sacrificed to satisfy the Vilnius of a small party of crotchet mongers and doeth mares at home We have already come to understand this in the case of the SouthScvlslands Egypt and the Suez Canal are only another and perhaps less piessinginstance of the same danger It may bethatourworstfeais will not be realised, and that at the last moment the English Ministry will hesitate before committing themselves to such a fatal and removable step as the evacuation of Egypt The danger, however, is scarcely the less serious. The mere fact that an energetic though perhaps small section of the Liberal party has to be kept quiet by such promises and subterfuges is sufficiently unsatisfactory, and shows the need for the more healthy and vigorous public opinion of the colonies being brought to bear upon these matters 'the approaching convention of the Australasian colonies will have plenty to do in dealing with subjects of immediate and local content to all, such as the annexation of the Pacific Islands and the French project for thetianspoitation of commons to the South Seas It is not to be expected that it will touch upon questions, however important, that more remotely affect us But it is as well that the public should become alive to the fact that there are such questions, and that interests of great moment to these colonies are constantly in jeopardy, chiefly owing to the want of some means of expressing their collective opinions, which it is one object of the coming conference to provide for While the attention of what usually designates itself the public is occupied by such matters the Strong case, the threatened rift in Pi Presbyterianism, the abolition of political patronage, the great annexation question, the lectures of Mr MONCUR, CONWAY, and even such very small beer as the discontented sagging of Mr MACKAY, We are apt to form get that side by side with this public there is another, to which all those subjects are matters of serene in difference, and which, nevertheless, is keenly interested in subjects of its own We of course refer to the world of womankind It is by no means from any want of mental activity on the part of women that consideration of what we call public affairs is left to be monopolised by the masculine half of humanity Women show abundance of intellectual zeal and eagerness with respect to matters in which they take interest, and if they do not display tins with regard to the matters we have referred to, this is because their attention is fully engrossed in other things as, for instance, in domestic affairs (their own and their friends ), and also the affairs of the factitious personages whom novelists call into existence for the purpose of of extending women's sphere of interest and observation, but above all, in the enthralling, over new subject of dress, the manifold and ceaseless changes of which impose such a strain on the female mind that fines-and of course oil must try to follow them, as men who loiter through business, and what they call work, can scarcely realise In these days, when we seem at times to be threatened by the irruption into all the professions and trades of a number of energetic and ambitious women, eager for emancipation and for a share in the work of the world, we seldom recognise what a protecting banner is afforded us by this enthralling interest of dress for the female mind It is not too much to say that the awful rule and right supremacy of the coarser sex at the present time lest on this alone The convenient doctrine which served its purpose so long, that women were unsuited for work, and that work was unsuited for women, has been refuted by many great and signal examples The masculine notion that men have highly superior intellects to those of women is scarcely compatible with social observation of the comparative intellectual status of husbands and wives, and the mental estimate they hold of each other s faculties At any rate, it is merely masculine judgment, which was never accepted by women except under dr ess, and is, in these days of emancipation openly secured These safeguards having disappeared, and the legal disabilities which men, from an instinct of trades unionism, imposed on women, being surrendered on all sides, the prospect of men continuing to engross to themselves the work and public authority of the world would look very dubious, were it not for the advantage we derive from the female mind so steadfastly occupying itself with the subject of dress Since we have adopted the democratic principle of an open career for all, without distinction of class or sex-, it is hopeless for us to exclude women from the competitions of the world, unless we can contrive to do so by amusing and interesting them in some other way And, in practice, no amusement 01 interest is found so potent, so captivating, so full of charm and in finite variety, as that afforded by dress If we attempt, then, to discourse in a clumsy, inaccurate, masculine way on the topic of ladies dress, and with special reference to the preparations for the forthcoming display at the spring racing carnival, we are conscious of servingatonceapatnotie purpose and the interest of the ironically styled superior sex Under ordinary circumstances it would be vain to spread the not so openly before even the silliest bird, but the fascination of dress to women is so great that even the candid avowal of our object, into which we have been betrayed, will not prevent the hue exercising its intended effect What, then, let us ask, will be the leading characteristics of the spring fashions, which will be unfolded in grace and beauty in two or three weeks time? How will they compare with those worn last year, and what will be their chief points of change So far as we can gather from an exhaustive study of the exoteric sources of information open to male inquirers, we may predict that dresses which recall the time of HeNRI Doux will be conspicuous dresses which we associate with the days of labor chivalry, when high born ladies made by the side of then cavaliers, hunting of hawking his character is shown in the Redingote style of dress, and is also suggested by the long gauntlets gloves, as though forcairy nig a falcon on the w rest In another style, Oriental patterns will be displayed month silks and also in studs Again, white dresses will be largely worn in many different designs In the ruling shapes a great change will be noticed The closely drawn skirts, which defined the figure almost as distinctly as the soft flowing robe of a G leek nymph, will give place to designs modelled on the balloon style of 20 years ago We should blush to have to record this in aesthetic valuation were it not that so long as we have novelties and in fashion there are no novelties save old styles revived-to attract and hold spell bound the female mind, it is little matter how tasteless the novelties may be If the designs of ladies' dresses were intended to please the eye of male mankind, the graceful clinging draperies of a couple of years ago would never have been abandoned to allow of the reinstatement of the hideous inflated skirts that we thought had been laid aside for ever, but that those of ladies' dress has long since been given up Not that it is to be understood that we are to return to crinolines à I imperative LUI/L/UL pure and simple, but that the most alive charlotte which obtained a footing, so to speak, last year, is expanding, and is being supplemented by a who 1 mining round the lower edge of the skirt Another archaic style which has been revived is that of the old Paisley patterns, which are among the latest novel tics Luxurious trimmings of lace and embroidery are to be worn over every thing As the dresses are wide), so are the shoulders increased 111 altitude, another point in regard to which masculine taste can only importantly protest The barbaric adornments of jewellery in which the primeval savage who makes a hole in his nose and introduces therein a piece of stone, stn vives 111 civilised woman are gone out for the time, and the huge lockets and earrings of the recent past have disappeared Is it the taste of the ago for natural science which has induced ladies to pile for a cultural specimens, in the shape of flowers and fruit on their heads as bonnet decorations The equestrian element in present dress fashions again appears in the jockey eau shape in which so many bonnets are moulded Muslin and cambric handkerchiefs have vanished, and coloured silk is now your only wear, while the soft ruffling at the throat and wrist is to be exchanged for the pain and formal looking linen collars and cuffs This is a slight forecast of the devices in which ladies will array themselves for the Flemington campaign, but it would be impossible even to sketch the strenuous mental labour spent on their origination As to the result, it will certainly be delightful to masculine eyes, whatever may be the intrinsic absurdity of the fashions adopted, and however ? tastefully or tastelessly the other sex may adorn itself, to them the fashions will be as nothing, and the ever interesting reality will be that of which a poet of our day speaks as "the perfect and " everlasting woman " The managers of the Austin Hospital for Incurable. IUIYO determined to hold a bazaar next Eastertide for the purpose of of clearing off the deficiency in the marine names account, and of providing funds for future requirements- The first annual report for the year ending June 30, 1883 shows that something must be done to place the charity on a satisfactory footing The bank overdraft at the date mentioned amounted to £601 Is. and although the institution hits money standing at the a credit of various special funds, it cannot be applied either to a reduction of this overdraft or to the discharge of current liabilities Up to the present time this charity has not received aid fromthofîovcniment, although we fail to see why it has been treated with less liberality than the other agon cases for relieving suffering which have been considered deserving of state assistance It is satisfactory to find that justice has at last been done in this matter, and that out of the sum granted in aid of charitable xxoikfortho year 1885 I, the Treasurer has been able to apportion £750 to the Austin Hospital line will probably prevent any accretion to the existing debt, but it will do nothing towards the bqtn dation of existing obligations Mrs Aus l

In the opinion of the Speaker the wording of Una vote is sufficiently large to prevent the issue being raised again this session In order to set aside the difficulty Mr Binda on thursday abandoned his

New South Wales recently) suggested to Mr Berry that the colonies which subsidise the Eastern Ex tension telegraph Company should still further endow them morder that a reduction might be made in the cost of messages to and from Europe and the East the extra cost was estimated to be between £60 600 and 700 000 the matter was considered by the Cabinet and Mr Berry has replied that Victoria will readily acquiesce in the proposal it all the colonies are required to pay their share of the loss Under the present arrangement, Queensland, Tasmania, and New Zealand do not subsidise the company, and Ministers think it would be very unjust if those colonies now joined in the compact should be further taxed in respect to the service The Amending Water Conservation Bill which the Government have

The formation of irrigation trusts, is distinct from the trusts now in operation, is dealt with in a number of sections, defining the manner in which they are to be formed, the jurisdiction with which they are to be entrusted, and the work they must perform.

The fifth ordinary general meeting of R Goldsbrough and Co was held at Menzies Hotel at noon yesterday Sir William 1 Mitchell presided, and there was a numerous attendance of shareholders The report pre- sented by the directors showed that the amount available for distribution on the present occasion, including the balance brought forward from last half year, was £15,474 8s. 9d The directors recommended the payment of a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent per annum (£10,000), leaving a balance to be carried forward of £6,474 8s 5d.

The chairman explained that these details could be obtained by the shareholders on application to the general manager.

New South Wales having declined a proposal to play nine aside, each team will consist of seven players as in previous matches The Victorian seven have not yet been finally decided on, but Messrs Burns, Whisker, Goldsmith, Fisher 1 sling, and Stanley may be regarded as certain to take part in the match, and for the Seventh place the services of such strong players as Messrs Hamel, Stephen, or Vtitton will be ax tillable 'The Victorian team this year will thus be the strongest that has ever repre seated the colony.
