THE ELVE-AZD-WUITE ROOM, (Si Jiiiiies'i, Gazette I was staring straight into Christmas time with a pen in my hand, when a blob of ink fell on the blotting paper The ink was blue and the blotting paper white, and they reminded me between them that it was about time I had said my say about me in mind sisters No 1 spare bedroom there is a saying about good natured people looking at things through rose coloured spectacles My man led sister would not think you for surveying; that room through them They would not harmonize with the colouring of the room which is blue and while, md my sister would resent the intrusion of my spectacles that were not blue The last night I spent in that room I noticed that the blind was tie I up in such a way that I could not pull it down lthidhiiowed all day, and when I put my head on the pillow the cold back g Idea was is a heavy white ghost it the window I did not like it, and I said so next morning My sister i explained that the effect of the snow was a good against the blue and white I think, that was my Instflish into what he spare bedroom had become to my sister Yet she was mar had but the other day ! Now it is the truth that this room struck him in humorous aspect The doctors fice sion drove the gk up out of mine My brother in his is a doctor, and he has a keen ser se of humour Many a time have I said things that uncle him fling back his head But when I mentioned the blue mci white room he uncrossed his legs near vously We were downed-, in the surgery, blithe placed hurriedly to the door and his pipe went out I caught him looking covertly at my, and after in no cure) silence he said "The blue and while room, and lanDed m min usual high shelf he had no idea in excuse to be at me I sat on smoking things. gradually revealed themselves to me, and I saw that his use It did him much credit There are subjects which me best not discussed, run between brothers in 1 us and since then I have not mentioned the blue and white room to him. When we c bade each other good night that evening it was with an unusual in yap of the hinds We understood each other My gun meant to it, though he was in i ned men who had continually brought it on himself, I sympathised with him and his meant that if he had his way I would not have to sleep in the blue and white room To say that the bedroom is a study in blue and white is not to do it anything like justice in the furnishing of that loose my sister has disclosed a genius which we thought she quite lacked in her maiden days I found this out gradually the person who occupied the blue and white room never took it in at a glance He was always finding out something new (in blue or white) The room grew upon him and with it admiration for my sister Take the case of the books One day the doctor missed from his library a medical treatise, he could find it nowhere The lady of the house was questioned, and she suggested that he should make use of one of the other books instead This put him on the scent He went straight to the blue and white room, and soon returned with the treatise This induced me to make a scrutiny of the bookshelf in my bedroom All the books were blue or white My sister, I discovered, had searched the hot dry for books suitable for a blue and white bedroom and the books suitable for a blue and white bedroom are books that are bound in blue or white They were not a happy family up on that shelf There were two of Bl felt s novels, a pair h inientary handbook, a Thomson and Tail s elements of Natural Philosophy,' an "Anatomy, and several other medical works, a copy of Horace, two time tables, &o; One day I noticed that some Blue Books had been added There were too large for the shelf, so were laid in a stage attitude on the dressing table My sister is not one of those people who furnish a room and have done with it She was always adding something Once I missed a picket of business envelopes, and was just going out in an unpleasant frame of mind to buy more, when I remembered that they were white envelopes, and that the picket was kept together by a blue paper and so I went to my bedroom instead and there they were on a small table beside an ink bottle I did not try the risk but I have not the least doubt that it was blue The matchbox was painted in blue and white, and so were the photograph frames I had with me a black dressing case which I axed her form my days I did not know this or if emine I should have Showed it aw ty neddy I saw her busy sewing what looked like a small blue pillow case , aim soon threw side I found that case with my big inside it My initials had been neatly seen in blue upon a white label on the top one of mi sisters few failures was the coal scuttle It was a tiny wooden one, and" she had painted it a delicate blue, with a white bundle for the shovel But the fire did for th a delicate blue, making the scuttle look tembly grimy So in my time coals were brought from the kitchen-uiifoituiitHy coals are black-by a maid, who, whether by accident or design, wore a white cap with blue ribbons I have not mentioned the slippers They had been special y sewn by my sister for the bluffed white 100m, so I need not tell their color They were not meant for use, but they looked very well at the side of the fireplace I say at the side of the fireplace but it is too vague a phrase to be accu the There was one spot which was supposed to be the best for these slippers, and they were never long oil it The only joke I ever played on the blue and white room had these slippers for appli tins I got to notice that if they had been accidentally moved a lines his id the from the proper place they were ilwi)sietiitnid test win tillie room was put to rights I tried the experiment of moving the slippers every morning sometimes I put them beneath i eli in it other (lines 1 merely caused them to the other side of the sender Sometimes I tucked them under ith a w adobe once I dropped them into the waste paper basket but, no matter where I put them they were always returned to then light price, but not i words and Let it not be supposed that there is not an educational a blue and white room When my) sister married she was the only suit the of and who could not or would not sew Look it the big she saw e 1 for a) dressing case, and the slippers Whit taught her to sow ?
