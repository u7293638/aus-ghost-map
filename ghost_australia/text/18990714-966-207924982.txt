A Scot' of the ; Scots, he lias born in Fife, and educatel in Edinburgh, of which he. used to bo*a£ that he knew every street, every house, ' and every stone. As a young manne|be;;.'' came a minister of the Established , Church, and rose to great eminence as-a • preacher at Greyfriars. He was, .also.'*/ Theological ProfessOT in tie University of dinburgh, and the University of Gla^ow" made him a Doctor of Divinity. TWenty j-eai-s ago he abandoned the clerical sion, resigned his Professorship, and urtis appointed Editor of the 'Scotsman." He did not occupy that post very long, ^ut in 1886 he achieved a brilliant triumph by turning Mr. Goschen out of East Edmurgh, which he has represented ever sincei He also qualified as a barrister. and sooa' njoyed: a good practice. He vras a man of sound learning, and great ability, with A peculative turn of thought and areallybril-;. iant wit. At his best-there was no one like him in the House of Commons. -His peech, on the In and Out Clause, as it waa alled, in the Home Rule Bill of 1893 has een compared with Sheridan, and it com-- letel}; overcame Mr. Gladstone, who laughd in spite ot himself. In private life, Mr. allace was a singularly genial-and amiable , an, though extremely fond of controversy nd argument. He wrote, as-be spoke, with . olished ease, and tjhe current number ^f he "Contemporary Bieview" contains a- austic diatribe against Imperialism from ie pen.
