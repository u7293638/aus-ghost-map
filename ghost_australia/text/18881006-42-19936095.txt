LITERATURE Original Poetry. [WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.] The Shepherd. E. SCHOLEFIELD. Yes, I'll fence: I'm sick and tired Of these shepherds and their tales; So I'll have it all five-wired. That costs less than posts and rails. Here's another: "Hallo! Mickey, What on earth is up with you l" I wondT is he mad or tricky, Fit for gaol or Woogaroo.' " Well Oion, mister, I'll be lavia*; (iet a man to take the sheep ; They are y.irded; sure I'm slavin' All day long and get no sleep." " Well, hut you must stop o'er Sunday; Take the tlock another day, And I'll get one; tbonon Monday You'll be paid and ride away." " Faix, sir, not another mtnit In that i.lesfed hut I'll stay; fcure the very divil's iv it, I'll be aff widout delay. " What's the matter .' Why, last night, sir, I'd me tuy an hour or more, When IM just blowu out the light, sir, Somethiug came and pushed the door. " Then it opened, and I tdiivered At the eowld blast it sent in; Wid the clothes my head I kivercd, Shivcrin' tit to crack my akin. " Did I see it.' Was it human ? Mure I peejicd just at Die door, Then I sec t thin ould woman Wid the long black clonk she wore. " There it stood! Bcdad, I see it Wid my own two blessed eyes! When it stared and cursed at me, it Banged the door and all it Hies. "But it shrieked like fifty curlews, And I knew it wai a ghost. Oh : my slut, that I'd left her loose! But I'd chained her to a post. " Sure ye're laffln '. soria seize ye! Ay ve'd seen it ye'd have dioci. But I'll never stop to ple<ts> >c, Pay, or no pay, aff I'll ride." That's the wayâ€”he's no exception; Half the shepherds are as bad. I can't think it's all deception; Ceaaelew brooding drives them mad.
