No returns .---..(as-nappears--in- the-table of the Counties), were obtained from 213 places; 678 places (the difference between 9,309 plus 2,013 and 1x2,000), h:aving been struck out of the a ontainin . for the most part ver' small tpopulations, in no case amounting to 200 souls. On the whole it appears 9 309 places have made a return; that tity conrtain 10,9G5 schools, and .740 005 scholars, and 2 013 places . (possessing each of them a pepulation of above 200), have not made a retu'n, the committee having .been P'prevcnted obtaining one by t--Iefirci?iisatances-m entioned in-t he-Report (page 10,). If, therefore, a proportion, is •taken. viz. as 9,309: 7.|0,005=2,013: 160,020; the last term (160,020) will give the number of children in the places not reported on. And, as .the'first term con .tai:s all places which made a return (man) of which po-sensed populations below 200). and such thinly inhabited places have-been all excluded from the third term, it may be inferred, a: a statement below the truth, that there are 11,35'2 schools. with 900,925 scholars, at present in immediate connection U.vith the Eatablishe] Church, andnuder the superintendencee of the cler gy.

Ghost stories are absurd. Whenever a reail .hust appcars-by which I mean some man or woman dressed up to frighten another-if the supernatural character of the apparition has beenfor a moment be lievct, the-effects on titespectatoe have t~lways been mspat terrible; convulsion, idiotcymadnass,or even dOath on the spot. Consider the awful descriltion in the Old Testament of'the effects of a spiritual presence on the prophets ani seers or the Hebrews; the terror, the xeeaeding great c:read, the utter 1pas of? allanimal power. biut in our common. ghost stories, you always find that the seer, after a most i appalling apparition, as yoQ,are to believe, is quite Well the next day.

Thoy consist ptincipally n o'f articles for domnetic use, viz , a bedstead otf solid gold and a table of. the same metal. ii Thiere are also two chairs of solid silver, be- i sides olither ar.i-lee, the whole made in a man- 3 nor which would do credit to the most expert f European mechanic, Ieing richly chssfed and ornamented 'witL carved figures. These urti. - cles are now lodged in the warehouses of the~ Dock Company, and aro to remain until fur ther orders. In addition to the above, two t elephants, two Arabian horses, and ,tvp dwarf p bufflloes have been landed. O, Thursday d night the 'male elephant was removed in a t caravan to Mr. Cross's establishment at the Surry Zoological Gardens, and last night the female was to be removed to the Zoologic.l Gardens, Regent's-park, in obedience to the commands of .his Majesty. We understand a 'hat the two Arabain horses-two young and I heautiful animals,' hve been conve,ed to n WVindor. The whole of the presents are esti i mated to be of the value of £80,000. CAutnan PIGEONS -\e e hare not a doubt that it is by the eye alone that the i carrier pigeon performs tr ose extraordinary aerial journies which, have froin the car liest ages excited astonishmtent. We have. frequenily w.tnessed the experlinent made I with other pigeons of taking them to a ] distance'from a dove-cot, expressly to ob- I serve -their manner of finding, their way t biek, itnd we feel satisfied that their pro- I ceedings are uniformly the same. On I being let go from the bag in which they have been carried, in order to conceal I from their notice the objects on the road, I they dart off on an irregular excursion, a if it were more toascertain the rt a'ity of r their freedom than to make an etilort to re \- turn. When they find' themselves at ful! liberty, they direct their flight in circles I round the spot from whence they have been liberated--increasing the diameter of I t.he circle at every round, and rising at 1 the sa me time gradually higher. This i- t continuud as- long as the eye can discern I the birds, and hence we conclude that it i I also cgntinued after we lose sight of.them, I a constantly increasing circle being made I a till they ascertain some known object, en ' abling them to shape a direct course. It C- snot=a =little.interesting ontrast the t proceedings just described with thorc of i pigeon let off from a balloon elevated above v the clouds. Instead of rising in circles e like the former, the balloon pigeon dops > erpendicularly down, like a plummet, till d it is able to recognize, some indicatitons f as the earth below, when it begins to whet ), roundl and descend spirally, increasing in ; diameter, for the evident purpose- of- sur 3 veying its locality, arid discovering some e object previously known by which to di i rect its flight.- Chronicle.
