Murdoch Macdonald before the Melbourne Presbytery, as reported in 'The Argus of Wednesday last, the following sentence occurs - Let Mr. ulo (meaning the writer) show us any article of our creed that has been demonstrated to he inconsistent with the truth, and we will cast it out. I accept the challenge, but being unable for want of time to appear in the church courts to offer the demonstration required, I ask your kind indulgence to permit me to occupy a small portion of your space to quote a few short extracts from the Creed of the Presbyterian Church, which only require stating to exhibit their inherent inconsistency with truth and their utter unscnpturalneas My own observations will be exceedingly scanty, no necessity existing to descant at great length on what must be patent to all thoughtful inquiring minds the following extracts are made from a copy of the " Confession of Faith published in edinburgh, 1750 - Chap I , sec 1 - ' impressed the Lord atsiindrytlmosaiidiii divers manners to reveal himself and to declare his will unto the church and afterwards to commit the same u holly unto writing Will the Melbourne Presbytery produce a single statement contained in the authorised version of the Scriptures setting forth any book or chapter brothe collection alleged to have been written by the Lord ' If some thing else is meant than what is said, why say that which is not meant * They are at liberty to produce testimony from any reliable source outside Scripture, but it is not to be found t Therefore, the statement is untrue and unscriptural, and should be cast out Chapter III, sec 3 and 4 " by the decrees of God for the manifestation of His glory some men and angels are are deathrate unto everlasting. life and others fore ordained to ever Instill-, death rich mines and men thus pre destination and fore ordained are l particulars and unchangeably designed and their number is so curtain and definite that it cannot be either increased or diminished the Presbyterian Church affirms that no possible occurrence can ever have any effect upon the numbers of those who are destined to be either saved or damned Jesus Christ said "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel unto every creature Will preaching the Gospel then alter the unalterable decrees Does it not look some thing like a mockery and a blasphemous m suit to the creatures God hath fashioned in His own image to seal their inevitable fate from all eternity, and then to preach a Gospel the fruits of which can never be of the slightest utility for good or evil a Which is the true seed, Jesus Christ or the Presbyterian Church v Let us accept Christ's version, and cast out the unclean thing begotten of Presbyterian ism Chap IN , BOC 3 - ' Meet infant- dying in infancy are regenerated and saved by Christ through the spirit Sec " Others not elected . cannot be saved ' Compare Luke xv in 15 "And they brought unto Him infants, that He would touch them but when IBs disciples saw it they rebuked them But JCHUU called them unto him and said Suffer little children to come unto Me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom at Heaven "VV bom shall we believe, Christ or the presbytery Chnp IV , sec. 1 - It pleased the Father Son and Holy Ghost in the beguiling to create or make of nothing, the world and all things therein whether visible or in visible, in the space of six days, and all very good Will the Melbourne Presbytery please point out one statement in the Old or New testament setting forth that God made of nothing the world and all things therein' It is inconsistent with either scriptural or scientific truth It is only according to the Confession of 1 with Chap VI , sec. 1 " Our first parents being seduced by the subtlety and temptation of Satan, sinned in eating the for bidden fruit Compare Gen in 1 " Now, the serpent was more subtil than any boast of the field . , And he said unto the woman, be the confession has it Satan, the Scripture, a beast of the field Chap XXI, sec 7 " By a positive e moral and perpetual commandment, binding all men in all ages God hath appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath 1 rum the be ginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ was the last day of the week, and from the resurrection of Christ was changed into the first day of the week There is no positive moral and perpetual commandment binding on all men to be found in the New testament, where God hath changed the Sabbath from the last to the first day of the week " Larger Catechism answer to Q GO " They who having never heard the Gospel, know not Jesus Christ, and believe not in Him, cannot be saved, So they over so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature, or the law of that religion which they profess Comment is needless , the foregoing is but a sample of the hideous, repulsive, God dishonouring doctrines of which the creed of the Presbyterian Church is composed, they are utterly at variance with truth, justice, and Christ's teaching of the fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man, and no church that values its existence as a power for good among men will hesitate to cast them out at once and for ever -Yours, c, WILLIAM YULE.
