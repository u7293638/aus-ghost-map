CARDINAL MANNING ON FRENCH FASHIONS. On Sunday, August 19, the Feast of St. Joachim, the father of the Blessed Virgin, was observed at the Pro-Cathedral, Kensing ton. A crowded congregation assisted at the High Mass, which was sung by the Rev. Father G-uiron, The sermon was preached by the Cardinal-Archbishop from the text, ' Tho fruit of the Spirit is charity, joy, and peace.' His Eminence proceeded to con sider the abundance of the fruits of the Holy Ghost, their diversity, and their sweetness. In connection with the abundance of these fruits, his Eminence, in dwelling on the fruit of modesty, in so far as it related to our visible life, alluded to the pestilence of fashion which has come over and destroyed the modesty of our social life. Where do these fashions come from ? Out of the bottomless pit of a great Continental city. These fashions, grotesque and immodest, are devised, and wafted over to us, and the grave matrons of England are fascinated or befooled into following fashions which come from abroad, instead of abiding by the old traditions of the matrons of this land. In regard to the diversity of the fruits oE the Holy Ghost, it was proved by their abund ance. Nevertheless, one word might be said. In the whole pagan world before the Christian world was founded, there was no such thing as an hospital, no such thing as an orphanage, no such thing as a lunatic asylum — muck less was there such a thing as a house for the poor. And why P Because in the heart of the heathen world there was not the charity of God reigning. When the Son of God came into the world the description we have of Him is, 'He went about '—through the streets, the vil lages, the multitudes — ' doing good.'
