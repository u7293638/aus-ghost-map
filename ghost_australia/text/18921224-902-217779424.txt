The measureless erav that was over them all : Whose roar speaks more than a language spoken, _ W ordles3 and wonderful, cry oa cry. The sob of au earth that is vexed and broken, - The answering sob of a broken sky. What could theyj tell us I We see them ever, The trees, and the sky, and the Btretch of the land ; But they give us a word of their secret never ; They teU no story we understand. Yet haply the ghost-like birch out yonder Knows much in a placid and Bilent way ; The rain might tell what the gray clonds ponder, The windB repeat what the violets say. Why-.weeps the rain ! Do you know its sorrow ? Do you know why the wind is so sad, so sad ? Hive you stood in a rift 'twixt a day and a morrow, Seen their hands meet and their eyes grow glad 1 Is the tree's pride strong at its top's abasement / Is the white rose more of a saint than tbe red t What thinks the star as it sees through the casement A Vnllniv mwl 1 mnn ltnonftf,,! f \- ' : â€” Barry Pain, from Stories and Interludes.
