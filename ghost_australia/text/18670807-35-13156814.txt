THE BATTLE OF POSITION. \- ??? - 2 From the Spectator.) A coi-iiAOrois and clever writer fights hard in this I month a uilnekirood on behalf of those who struggle through life for what they call " position " It is, he says, rather cynically, by good an object in life as any other of the interior Birt, at least as good a one as money Yet everybody respects the toil for cash, an J everybody ridicules the toil for social position " S\ hy on earth do we all applaud a tradesman for pushing his business, and reckon it a merit in a man to confine himself to a dingy office for eight hours a day merely for the purpose of amassing pounds, shillings, and pence, and yet feel inclined to laugh at him when he spends some of this hard-earned money liberally in the evident desire to make himself a gentleman J The writer is careful to show that he means the struggle for position in its conventional or satirical sense, not a struggle for a real rise in life , but he asks where is the harm, if a man like that pursuit, of putting little wheels in motion to get on the Commission of the Peace, or to obtain a status among " country families, or to secure the entree to certain pleasant or, as it may be, merely aristocratic houses ? May not the strife for social success be an education, like any other strife, and develop some at least of the good qualities developed by most English contests good temper, address, endurance, and the spirit of toleration ' It is cleverly put all that, so cleverly that it will justify hundreds of English families in their own eyes who have before half suspected themselves of bung humbugs, and deserves therefore a passing reply The writer of the paper in Blackwood states nothing but the truth, and states it very well, by against the merely Battle school, but he either misses cr dial crately ignores the objection raised by graver and more candid men Nobody has ever argued gravely that a rise in society is a bad object, when the candidate genuinely wishes to obtain it as a real I end If he honestly thinks or, as may happen, knows that above him in a stratum of society where he will be more himself, where thought is wider, and i "experience less confined, and conversation free-, by all means let him mount So long as the process is not a series of unworthy compliance, the effort id right and praiseworthy, or at worst as h likes as the effort of water to reach its level The men who, born, to steel forks, or habituated to steel ftrkB, finds he can breathe more freely where silver is used, is quite in the right to seek those who habitually use silver there are men to whom a certain external refinement is as healthy as a certain purity a fair, and there is just as little reason against their working it. They are trying to be themselves to the full, which, though not an end exactly, is a means TUi essential to any good and the objection to the struggle for position is not that the end is bad-it may be good or indifferent but that, as a rule, there is no end at all The candidate does not want to be anything good or indifferent, but only to seem to be wants not to fulfil a function, but to act a part, which is sure to degrade him The infinite majority of those who struggle lr r j oBition are not stretching upwards towards the 1 well in order to see better, but trusting that a reflected light it from above falling on them may dazzle those they have left behind If a London tradesman de el rises he will be a County Member because as a county member he will be in his right place, will be able to exert the strength he feels in himself on politics, and to in prove the county administration as while a trades- man he could not do, all prosperity be with him He is certainly doing right according to his lights, pro babl) doing right according to lights much higher things, and what can he do more But for one who strives from this motive ten strive not because they hope to be Country Members in the efficient sense, but because they hope to seem County Members in the representative sense, which is defending BlaeMcood says it is not more degrading than in equal effort for money, but Blackwood is talking nonsense which would have made Christopher North, who was any pretension incarnate, blush with annoy the e Money does not improve a man, but the work wl Yeh wins it does Money is not a noble and except so far as it represents independence, or what is quite as timmun, "volition," the power to do what one con- save s to be worth doing, but then the means to that endless en if sought for itself, as cash, gold in the water s senseless work, and granting honest, work which must benefit somebody You cannot get cash out of anything whatever without increasing the sum of the world's power, which is good, even if work be not good in itself and for itself, which work, being partly discipline, probably is But the usual weapon in the battle for social position is not work, but intrigue, which instead of elevating degrades The strife is fought by a series of social deferences, each one of which does seem particle of injury to the candidate's moral nature by small compliances, each of which involves a he by small efforts, each of which is an expenditure of time that might be better employed In London the struggle for social position in the con- ventional sense is practically a struggle to please certain women who can be conciliated only by services, by adroit lying, or by yet more adroit flattery The services required may of course be unobjectionable but as a rule they are degrading, the politician, for example, being required to abandon or conceal, or modify) according to his strength his real convictions, while the fibB and flatteries are always and radically bad In the county, again, the battle is fought by de- ferences If the man who has got a block of land, and some brains, and no " standing " wants to get standing, he makes himself acceptable to a knot of magnates, partly by doing their work, which is all right if he likes it, partly by paying them court, which is all wrong, and partly by denying his own convictions, which is degrading simply. There is no harm in his keeping them straight on the Bench if he can, indeed, there may be good as matters go, for the poor benefit, but there is harm in always backing up the local peer whom the candidate does not believe in, and degradation in being savage to poachers when at heart he thinks the Game Laws an oppression All but the last may be pardoned if the object is really to live among brighter or less prejudiced minds, or people of easier habits, or those who for any reason whatever are more acceptable to the candidate, but that nine times out of ten is not his object He only wants to seem to people smaller than himself to be on a level with the great He does not want to be a J P to use Blackwood 3 illustration, because he wishes to distribute justice, or even because the distribution of justice interests and amuses him, but solely in order that his neighbours may think of him as on a level with other JP s That is base, if any - thing is base The writer in Blackwood objects to lofty standards, and we are not setting up any We do not object for a moment to any man wearing a red hunting coat, if it increases his power of riding We do not object, if it seems to him decidedly pretty in itself We do not object, if he feels more comtortable in it than in his ordinary clothes But we do decidedly object, if he wears the coat in order to convince people that he hunts when he does not, and that is what the struggle for position usually means the man who is himself is usually something, be it what it may, the reason why genuine aristocrats are often qua aris secrets so efficient but the man who merges himself, as the candidate for position must usually merge himself, in other people, is always less than himself, less, it may be, occasionally and exceptionally, as the diamond is less after cutting, but less usually, as the yew in after it has been cut into a peacock, or a lion, or a Noah's Ark toy We have spoken, of course only of the cases in which the strife is fair, in which the candidate really makes it his profession to rise, and uses all energies to that end, but frequently the effort is something smaller than this and worse than this, an attempt to misuse wealth either by exciting em j, or by unjust political pressure, or by the purchase of alliances, till it secures an end it ought not to secure, namely, a fictitious importance in the eyes of those who have it not The struggle in England is practically a struggle of wealth to buy position which it usually does Dy corrupt means of some kind That corruption degrades, and degrades all the more because the bad means are employed to serve a bad end-an appearance of that which does not exist We say bad means, because we are trying to define the moral evil, but in practice they are also weak means, and ridiculous on that ground Position, comes to the strong the quickly because it is not sought All that dangling, and compliance, and flunkeyism in the world will not raise a new man in London as quickly as a speech which shakes or supports a Ministry, or any other unmistakable evidence of power All the little was held in the world will not jm e a man i count) position be quite k1) as the ability to guide and lead the county, the power to say things which big j cope must reckon with, or to do things they strongly) like or dislike It is the weakness as well as the folly of the ordinary process when. bruises ridicule, me! which the writer in Dlacbtoood so can pletel) overlooks H half the power wasted in. conciliating the great lady of the count), if spent on a worthier object would give ON grea lad) of the county an interest in conciliating you And after all, else come is stated too favourably for the strugglers v hen the) are all represented his name. The Battle of Position, as it i > understood in England, is mainly for right out by women, and it is not a battle which improves the men are just as ostentatious and as vain as women, and we think rather more sub servient, but they do not suffer in this particular form of contention, as women do They cannot get quite so hot and dusty in the fight They have been, bred among realities, and the) infuse more readily into their object "With women who engage in. the strife the State itself is often the and and of all de- moralising prove 'to commend us to battle for battle'S sake.

I ExTitAonnríAiiT Tural or Skill my Pickfomws. -The Paris correspondent of the Morning Advertiser publishes the following account of the doings of French and English pickpockets at the Paris Exhibition He says -"The most successful demonstration of British industry that has yet been developed by the Exhibition has been displayed by English pickpocket in the art of ' taking a day they are unrivalled, and to this valuable acquirement they have now added that of eluding the vigilance of the Jurgens de ville, md of the private policemen with lurk in plain clothes in places where they are least expected Since competition is so much, in fashion in every thing now a days, a tin of strength and kill hits of late come off between the French and English thieves The former were stung with maddened jealousy at hearing the complaints of lost watches and purses, and challenged their rivals to a contest, which came off a few days since Seven English and seven French thieves started on their predatory expedition through the Exhibition, and agreed to meet at a cafe in the boulevards, or rather it a restaurateur s, where they had previously engaged a cabinet particulars, and ordered a supper, to be blood by the vanquished. They met at the appointed hour, and you will be proud of your country, is a superiority when you learn that" they triumphantly displayed forty-five watches and nine per economics, whereas the French tyros in the noble art could display but ten watches, t) rec j portemonnaie, and half a dozen handkerchiefs-' small deer,' which are disdained by the profile pickpocket, and are only ' faked during a novitiate in the profession They magnanimously avowed themselves vanquished, and agreed to recognise the superiority of the victors in the form most pleasing, to them by standing ' half a dozen of champagne, followed by bowls of blaming punch in quick succession Up to this stage all had been highly gratifying to our national pride, but the hour of Britain's humiliation was drawing nigh. Our countrymen fell under the table, their hosts, though they had not read the tale of Falstaff s disaster at Gadshill, fell upon the prostrate foes, eased them of their plunder, and retired in triumph with the forty-five watches, purses, c and, moreover, left the waiter s instructions to apply for the payment the bill to the gentlemen upstairs on the floor " A Ghost in a Lorton Squares -The inhabitants of Woburn square, Bloomsbury, have been annoyed during the past week by large numbers of the ragged and noisy population of St Giles in quest of a ghost said to be a denizen of their enclosed square garden. So great and increasing has been the crowd for the last night or two that police have been told off for the special service of maintaining order and making the populace move on The excitement appears to date from last Saturday night, and various absurd rumours of skeletons, women in white, We, are rife, though it is by no means clear who was the first to detect this supposed ghostly visitor, nor easy to find any one who can assert that he has seen any such appearance After a visit to the spot, we can affirm that the whole evidence of anything out of the common is confined to the existence of a patch of light falling upon an arbour at the north-east corner of the enclosure, and which is perfectly evident to any one looking through the railings on the west side of the square near the spot This light is, we believe, nothing more than that thrown by a gas lamp at the north end of the square, and which passing through a gap in the shrubs, is cast in a somewhat remarkable manner upon the spot in question We would strongly recommend that the light should be temporarily extinguished, when we believe that both the ghost and the consequent excitement would sub- side simultaneously Two other solutions have been suggested for the appearanee-the application of phosphorus, and the use of reflecting mirrors by some mischievous inhabitant of the neighbourhood Neither of these hypotheses is, in our opinion, tenable -The Lancet ARTEsiAN Wells in Algbria.-Twenty-three years ago the French colonists of Algeria made their first attempts to sink artesian wells in their newly acquired territory ; but after boring in two places in the province of Oran to a depth of 98 and 176 metres without striking water, the attempts were abandoned. In 1866, operations were resumed by the military corps of engineers, and from that date, with two or three exceptions, every boring has succeeded and at the end of 1804, seventy-five wells were flowing and delivering 4,200,000 litres of water every hour, or 100,000 cubic metres a day. The water is limpid and drinkable, but generally a little brackish. The effect of such a supply on the social life and industry of the country may be imagined. A village and date plantations rise up around every well, and the natives, having something to lose, prefer peace to precocity. Thirty-five of the wells are in the Ouled Kir district, which stretches far to the south. The deepest well is 176 metres, the shallowest 29 metres, and the total of all the borings amounts to 6628 metres. The entire cost, defrayed by a tax on the natives, was 400,000 francs. Among the material results, we are informed that 150,000 date-trees have been planted in the Ouled Kir district alone, besides fruit-trees of other kinds, and more than 2000 new gardens have been formed. "We may expect that these beneficial operations will be continued, for four boring brigades have been established, all well provided with implements, for the purpose of systematic exploration, and to sink wells in places likely to yield water. Guided by years of experience, their failures are now but few, and year by year their knowledge of the local hydro- graphy, surface and subterranean, becomes more complete Athenaeum. The Coal Trade or Great Britain. - The Amount Raised in 1865:-"If we take the area of Lincoln's Inn Fields," says Mr. Smyth, " measured up close to the houses, at eleven acres, about the dimensions of the base of the Great Pyramid, and could stack the coal as nature has done in the seams, the British coal raised last year would form, on that base a solid block of the height of 5229 feet, or as high as Snowden surmounted by another mountain of half its height. Again, taking the distance from London to Edinburgh, four hundred miles, the same quantity, similarly packed, would build a wall the whole way of twelve feet thick and ninety-nine feet high, whilst if put together in the broken state in which coal is commonly used, it would give a wall of more than double that thickness. This yearly production, obtained by the labour of 240,000 men, is palpably a gigantic effort for so small an area as that of our united coal-fields, and naturally excites apprehension for the future.
