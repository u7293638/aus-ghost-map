CHAPTER XII. Eastcote:was a typical Kejtish village. It `nestled between two hills, where it lay a dreaming as if in an enchanted valley. The 'ietreets were irregular, and almost as white 'as snow. The houses straggled here, there, .and everywhere in picturesque confusion. Most of them were covered with' trailing creepers, and even the shops had patches of =:flower-garden under their front windows. The expansive green1 with its mighty oak *tree, was in the centre of the village, and ``beneath its wide-spreading branches, in the \- drowsy'summer evenings, old battles were lost and won by the veterans of Eastcote. Behind the green, and embowered in trees, was the famous old inn, the ' Kings Arms,' a building all nooks and gables. More than eonce royalty had been entertained at the 'a Kink's Arms,' and a hundred and fifty i years before the inn had been patronised by a celebrated highwayman. To the villagers i-at least, the historical importance of East cote increased with every generation. Half-way up the pine-crowded hill, at the base of which the hamlet lay, the church -gleamed white against the dark background. "In the very shadow of the sacred building the Rectory windows peeped through the trees. The pathway from the village to the 'church ran alongside a purling brook; the hedgegrows were full of wild-flowers ; the air was always fragrant here. It was very late when Margaret and Jessie reached the nearest station to East cote. The Reverend James Fielding was waiting for them, and the old carriage from the Rectory was in charge of the man-of-all work. A dozen times had he trimmed his lights. It was a serious undertaking to drive soven miles through the dark lanes at midnight. ' Here we are, father !' Jessio cried; 'How good of you to bring all those wraps. I am shivering with cold I Why, the train must be an hour late ! This is my friend, Miss--Mrs Lynden. Margaret, my dear iusber 1' They were standing under the light of a flictrering oi'-'amp, and the Rcc'or gazed almost compassionately at Margaret. He had hea-d f. om his daughter of the approach ing marriage, and of the coming parting almost at the altar. ' I hope that you will be happy with us, my dear,' he said. His voice was soft and low, and his mild blue eyes, beamed with friendly earnestness. ' Now, Jo',u, be lively with the luggage ! We have a long drive before us.' Margaret felt chilly and depressed. Seven long miles in that shaky old brougham ! The coachman grumblel, and the Rector prosed good-naturedly. Jessie, enveloped in wraps, slept peacefully in her corner. ' Eastcote is famous for the beauty of its scenery," Mr. Fielding said. 'There is no approach to level monotony. But you will see for yourself by-and-by, Mrs. Lynden. In the spring, summer, and autunin,: there is hardly a more beautiful spot on the- face of the earth.' At last it was all over. For twenty minutes the horse had crawled up what must have been a precipitions way ; then the carriage stopped,- and John climbed down from his seat. An oil-lamp, sus pended in a vine-enwreuthed portico, shed a sickly light. It swayed to and fro in a dis consolate ways and its.. beams flickered mournfully.in the night wind. Mr. Fielding and his daughter alighted; then Jessie took one of Margaret's hands, saying ' Here we are, dear ! A warm welcome to your new home I ' They entered a spacious, but low-ceiled hall, and thence Jessie hastenened into a cheerful sitting-room, where-a bright fire glowed fiercely in a huge old-fashioned grate. ' Take off your things dear,' Jessie said. ' What would you like? Hot coffee and then to bed ? The table is already laid, you see. Our cook-housekeeper is a gem in her way. She has been with us for twenty five years. I cannot introduce you to my mother until morning.' 'I ani rather bewildered at present,' Mar garet replied, with a faint smile,. 'and shall be glad to go to my room. A cup of coffee, Jessie, and then I will say " Good-night! "' Jessie busied herself in various ways, and Mkargaret warmed her chilled hands before k the fire. The Rector came in, urbane, smiling. He was very much like his daugh e ter ; the kind face was too gentle for a man who has to fight life's battles. He talked e about his 'boys,' who were at college, and ° vaguely wondered for what profession they would be suitable. ' Arthur's tastes are artistic, Mrs. Lynden; , indeed, the boy already shows remarkable power of delineation. Did you go to the Academy last year ? No ? I think the best thing there was the "Piazza Novona.' It was painted by an unknown artist, I understand. I will show you some of Arthur's work to-morrow.' e 'Beyond the terminus from which we have travelled I have never been to London,' Margaret said. - 'Hateful place!' responded the Rector. ' Noise, dirt, and confui-ion ! Ah; what a pleasure it always is to get home again ! ' It was a relief to Margaret when Jessie I brought in the coffee, and a sigh of thank ' fulness escaped her when at last she was alone in her bed-room.. r How deathly the silence was ! She i r missed the thunder of the waves upon the shore. A sweet-toned clock chimed the hour of two;. a leaf tapped gently upon the window-pane. The young wife disrobed hastily.and crept into bed, and knew noth ing more until some hours later. A bright beam of morning sunlight gleamed upon the wall when she awoke, " and, shpping out of bed, Margaret drew up the blind. The scene before her was won drously beautiful-undulating meadows of intense green, dark plantations, and glitter. ing streams. It seemed that hundreds of birde were chattering noisily in the ivied walls of the church. Margaret had remem bered theta sitting room had been reserved for her use-a cosy little room downstairs, which would be all her own. She dressed slowly and thoughtfully. How could she occupy her time in this dull place ? It was worse than .Hampton- on-the-Sea-a thous and times worse! Seven miles from a railway station, and no season ! The Rec tor had spoken of his library, of carriage drives, and long walks. How could a man be satisfied with such a useless lotus-eating existence ? She went down-stairs, and the cook-house keeper met her in the hall. Shewas a prim elderly woman, severe of countenance. S' M'iss Jessie is not up yet, ma'am,' she said. ' Will you have breakfast in your own room ? ' 'If you will be so kind,' Margaret replied, gratefully and graciously. 'But I am not sure which is my room.' ' This way, ma'am. And you will call me "Ann" plea'el 1My name is Ann Pearson. I've never been married, so I'm plain "Ann" to everybody. My life has been devoted to the Rector and his family, or ( might have been mistress at the " King's Arms." John Hinds, Lord Grev ille's coachman that was, asked me to marry him when he took the public-house; but I loved my place hero the best, and now I hear that he's married a dressmaker.' Ann I laughed scornfully. ' She's too proud to serve behind the bar, save when the Squire's son looks in, or the Doctor. I suppose she fancies she's in society then I ' Lord Greville ! Where had Margaret a heard that name before ? He must be the t father of the Lady Natalio'Grevillo of whom Darcy had spoken once or twice. ' The Earl of Greville is lord of the manor,' Ann continued garrulously. ' He has a seat here and and another in the West of England. His sister, Lady Natalie, is one of the famous beauties of the day. Oh, I forgot to tell you that there was a letter, Mrs Lynden-it's on the table there I I can't call you Mrs. Lyndon all at once- - you look so yoiung.' Marga'et was pleased with her sitttng- b room. It was prettily furnishcd, and the , large bay-window commanded a beautiful vieow. The walls were hung with small water-colour drawings, and in the corner of each picture she saw that the name of Arthur Fielding had been inscribed. Two of the drawings were decidedly original, and perhaps clever. One was called 'Idealism,' the other' Realism.' He was a bit of a genins, this brother of Jessie Fielding's, and Margaret bec(mo interested. Ann brooght in her brelakast. It was a h plain appetising meal of coffee, new milk, new bread, and delicious butter, and the egg , the housekeeper assured her, were like cream. Iri another minute Margaret was alone. Now she could enjoy herself in her own way ; at last she real ised the delights of complete independence. i She glanced at the letter, and shivered -a , little. It was from her nsband ; she knew his bold hand- writing. Had he promised e to write to her at once ? She was riot sure, and a vague feeling of alarm took possess , ion of her. Perhaps something h1ad happened e -perhaps his regiment had received orders I to stay at home ! That would be a calamity \--she must have her freedom for a little while ! s Margaret poured out her coffee and cracked an egg ; then she turned'desperately I to the letter-the suspense was too much to bear. She slit the envelope with a e table-knife, and read, without a tremor. the a fierce burning words of love which had literally burst in a torrent fr?it the heart of the' man she had married on the day t before. n 'My darling Margaret-my wife-You a have gone out of my life for a little while, and the world is cold and dark-I fi'd no a consolation anywhere ! If I were a woman I should sob myself to sleep to-night, be d cause I have lost so much ; but, as I am not a woman, I can find no relief in tears. Instead I shall live over again the all too g, brief, the all too happy past, and picture your lovely face as I have seen it so many te times-flushed and radiant with hope. I would that-I could say ' love,' and that that d lovewere mine! How well I remember a the day-the hour-when my eyes first *e dwelt upon you, darling ! It was at the d close of a brilliant Sunday in summer after church hours-and I hear the rolling a. music of the organ even now. Let me quote Ld one of Poe's inspirations ; it suits me a, exactly in It was a July evening ; and from Out r- A full-orbed moon, that, like thine oIis soul iy soaring, Sought a precipitate pathway' up through heaven, 11 Then fell a silvery silken veil of light, - With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,' e, Upon the upturned faces of a thousand Roses that grew in an enchanted garden, Ad Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tip-toe re Fell on the upward faces of these roses e That smiled and died in this parterre, en chanted B9 thee, and by the poetry of thy presence .. n Rut now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight ad Into a western couch of thunder- cloud ; Id And then a ghost amid the entombing.trees ty Did glide away.

I believe that poor misguided Poe knew, a as I know, what it is to love. Every! word echoes through my soul in fond sympathy. e ' Margaret, it seems that we are divided by a boundless ocean, and I am almost s tempted to fly to you. A few short months \--or never again.

There will just be time for me to t receive it, or if this should be delayed, send me a telegram-send me something. ` 'Good-bye, my Margaret, my beautiful love. By night and by day my dreams will f be of you, until I hold you in my arms again. 'DARCY.' f Mgagaret laid the letter beside "here plate I and shivered; then she carefully put it away. Her first thought, had been to I destroy it. ' I cannot write,' she thought-' I have nothing to say.. I will telegraph that I have arrived at the Rectory, and that all is .well.' There was a tap at the door, and Jessie came in, her eyes sparkling, her face beam . ing. - ' Good morning, dear. How wall you are looking I I am quite ashamed that my guest should be left alone on the very first morn ing after her arrival ! But I really could not help it ; I was so tired and sleepy. You have had a letter, Ann told me, and I can guess whom it is from, poor fellow I' Her voice took a tender inflection. 'I have also had one-or at least, my father h's. It is from my brother Arthur. He is com ing home for good; his education is completed The trouble is, what is he to do in the fature ? He wants.to stedy art, and that means years of toil, and more money spent upon him. But all such news is of little interest to you.' 'This is your brother's work, is it not ?' Margaret said, pointing to the water-colours 'He is very clever. ' He idealises too much,' Jessie responded quickly. ' Who ever saw a sunset like that ?' she laughed and changed the subject. 'It is a glorious morning, and I want to know your slightest wisb, Margaret. If my absence is preferable to my company, send me away I am your devoted slave !' ' You shall show me the village,' Margaret said. 'I wish to send a telegram. There seems to be a delicious touch of spring in the air. It is quite delightful to be a per sonage of so much importance ! iNow per mit me to finish my breakfast in peace AK hour later Margaret made the acquain tance of Mrs Fielding, a handsome old lady, who regarded her critically. 'Yours is a most romantic story, Mrs I Lynden,' she said. 'I don't like too much romance in real life. The most prosaic lives r usually turn out the best. And you are so young,' she sighed. 'Tell me,' she continued 1 'do you feel that your heart is breaking at times? I am impelled to ask the question P because I remember my own bitter sorrow iP when I was about your age. - I was not c married; but my lover was sent abroad for a two years. Even now that timo constitutes Ii a black page in our history.' '-You need not waste any sympathy upon me, Mrs Fielding,' Margaret replied coldly. Il 'Cantain Lynden and I thoroughlyunder- n stool each other.' tl 'The girl has no heart I' the Rector's wife thought ; and she looked pained. 'I I will never mention her huabanda's name to her agaLn r .. . Margaret and Jessie went out into the clear sunshine. The Rector was in the garden, and he waved his hand genially. The whole of nature appeared to be walk ing into life; the rooks crawed in the elm trees ; the lark sang ecstatically in the air. 'This is all a delusion.' laughed Jessie- ' though it is a pleasing one. There will be more dark gusty days and tempestous nights before the spring fairly sets in ; but we will make the most of the present. I have to introduce you to lots of people.' ' I do not desire to know anybody,' Mar garet declared. ' Oh, yes you do, Margaret ! I mean people who are somebodies. You are a per fect aristocrat in; your learnings, petite. And I would have you know that the daughter of a 'clergyman is privileged at home. The snobs who cut me dead at Hampton-on-the-Sea would simply fawn at my feet here ! The Earl of Greville actually paid me great attention, and I believe that he world have proposed had not my engagement to Tom Tracy been announced. It was really a case of spoons ! ' 'The Earl is an elderly man, is he not ? ' 'Elderly ? ' Jessie opened her eyes wide. 'I thought that be had a daughter?' stammered Margaret. ' A sister,' corrected Jessie-' Lady Na talie. The old Earl has been dead more than a year. The present Earl is a hand some fascinating fellow, and enormously rich ! Greville Hall is only four miles dis tant. Now about your telegram. You can write it in the post-office, and a messenger will have to take it to Redland, the nearest telegraphic station. It will cost you five shillings. That is one of the advantages of being rural. Here is the post-office.' Margaret made the message as brief as possible. The curious glances of the apple-checked postmaster annoyed her. ' Arrived safely. No time to write.-M.' The man read it aloud several times before being satisfied ; then he had to con sult a ponderous official volume. The des patch of a telegram was not an everyday occurrence at Eastcote, and he had for gotten the exact charges. Margaret could hear Jessie's clear voice talking to some one outside; and a moment later she found her self being introduced to a tall aristocratic youngfellow, whoseeyes seemed tobe riveted on her face. 'I am really charmed to meet you, Mrs. Lynden,' he said lazily. ' And Miss Field ing informs me that she has returned home permanently. May I do myself the honounr of walking with you, or shall I be intrud ing ?.' ' Come with us by all means, ILord Greville,' Jess¶i said promptly.' ' It is not often now that -you favour us with your society at the Rectory.' 'I returned from the Riviera only last week,' the young Earl answered apologet ically, and he coloured faintly. 'L Ldy Natalie is there still, but I promise faith fully to renew my devotion at the shrine of beauty.' \- Margaret was conscious of his bold glances, and she blushed crimson. To her the elegant young aristocrat, was simply odious. -He had completely spoiled her morning's pleasure. 'I will accompany you to the Rectory, Miss Fielding,' Lord Greville continued, ' and invite myself to luncheon with your father. I was really on my way to see him when I met you.' He told the falsehood glibly enough, and Jessie's eyes twinkled; then, with a feeling of intense annoyance, she raw that his gaze was constantly directed towards Margaret's face. ' Your brother is coming home, is he not ? ' he drawled. ' A decidedly clever boy, Miss Fielding-but, it seems a shame that a gentleman should dream of painting for a. living!' - SThe Rector came out to meet Lord Greyv ille, and his lordship lunched at the Rectory. He did not see Mrs Lynden again that day,. but he wormed her romatic story out of Mra Fielding. [TO BE CONTINUED.], .
