LOCAL AND GENERAL NEWS. The principal event of the year with us-the annual show of the Queensland Pastoral and Agri cultural Society--opens to-day, and promises to be agreatsucess. The ground presented a very busy appearance yesterday, and numerous exhibits were being arranged in their places. Among other things. Martin's patent atmospheric gas machine in being fitted up, and Beale and Company's 57.apoburg pianos were being tuned. There were a large tumber of pigs, poultry, and horeses in their places, but com plainte were made that some of the stewards ap pointed did not put in an appearo ce. We wosd -dvise exbhibitorn tobring in theire-xhibits as-early this morning as possible, as there is likely to be little room to spare. The altow is to; be opened it noon by Sir Thomas M'llwraith, and a large attend ance is anticipated, as a great number of country - visitors were ain town last night. A mnan named John Goddard. employed 4i the Rossend Colliery, was admitted into the HRosetitel, on Saturdaylast, suffering from lacerated wounds on the foot, the result of an accident, which happened to! him while at work. On the same day Alexander Muller, aged thirteen months, ason of Mr. G. Muller: of Walloon, was also admitted into the institution, suffering from severe burns on the arm caused by ; lighted match having been thrown upon it by another child. The injuries were attended to, and in both instances the patients are doing well. The unlawful practice of laying poison-baits is being indulged in just now at North Ipswich,, and the carcasses of dogs are lying hereand therethro?tgh out that position of the town. The eouiance-m spector is having a pretty lively time of .it, And' yesterday he might have been seen perambulating the streets with a wheelbarrow, pick, and shotel, on,' his way to "undertake" the burial of the defunect canines, no fewer than seven of which were reported to be lying about the north side that morning. The indiscriminate laying of baits within the muncipal ity is a very reprehensible pracntice, for.while not a few of the many coreabout town might with bdvaih-. tage be dispensed with, valuable and fayoirrite animals may also fall victims by the very iuitehddn adopted to rid the town of the useless mongro which infest it. " y" A lecture was delivered on Sunday afterenoulaat in the Temperance Hall, Weat-street/by," Otptaik" - P. W. Cairns. on " The Salvation Army 'its (?l-iu Aims, antd Success." The attendance was onderate. The lecturer chose as the basis of his rmeinesai;tlf a 15th verse of the 16th chapterofStL. Mark anl the 13th verse of the 14th chapter of St. Luke ;'end,'after.ep interesting introduction, he proceeded to esay.:thetm the Salvation Army was a body of converti2sltnsae and women, joined together after the fashion of an army, for the purpose of using their best eudeavours to make all pple yield.. or at least listen, to4Lshe claims whichGod had to their love. andaervice. The drganisation had been brought intoexisnce, seven teen years ago, by the Rev. William Booth, who then resigned the position he held as minister, and withg his wife devoted himself exelhsively to e'atelitl_, work. Five yeare ago the orgatisation of which he oas the head came to be called the Salvation Army -a force as real, as active, as self-sacrifiengi slhd as much under control forsoul-saving purposes asno the ordinary military armies were for elaughter and destruction. Judging from the results'attaineduilk had made greater progress during tho time. it had been in existence than any eligious movement oftl) lasthundredyears. notwithstanding thatthe inethlds sometimes employed by its oficers wer ee idiffers(t ftrom the religions. usages and social tastesof.hipect. - ableandrefinedpeople.

The discourse anwas listehbd toe throughout with the greatest attention, and manyioft theose present testified to their sympathy' with?tb.' lecture by contributing towards the objhot for arhi:h' it was given. The annual festival in connection with the ',o?ol gregationalSunday-schoolatGatton tookplate od t'b' Queen's Birthday, , and proved to be one pf thp most pleasant and successful gatherings ever held at that place. The earlier part of the day was "eoncupied, a_ usual, with amusements and the partaking of re freshmente. At 3 o'clock the pubhe meeting cots menced, and was presided over by Mr.3. C?lins . It has been customary for some years at these meet ings for hymns to be sung and recitations given by the children in competition for prizes. 'On this one casion so great was the interest manifested 'in the" proceedings that there was not room to accommnodate all who were desirous of gaining admission.: One special feature was the number of very young chi dren taking part in the exercises, sonime of the old favourites being withdrawn to make room for themni. The children's programme having been gone through, one or two other recitations were given, after wluth" Bome remarks were made by the minister (the ?o', S. F. Whitebead), the superintendent (Mr. Joseph Lowe), the secretary (Mr. F. Lloyd), iinl the clia?i man. At the close, the meeting united in ,singing the National Anthem. The annual sermionswire. preached, on Sunday last, by the Rev. S. Larkin, of Laidley. At the Harrierille Police Court, yesterday, before Messra, S. D. Edwards, Wet. Winks, and dt "H.

A cricket statch was played at Deep Creek on' Thursilay last betweetn teams choeon from the Mount !lrislane ant the Fernl'mle Cricket Clubs. It re sulted ili a victory for the former by two ruis and one wicket. The cricket seaasou, we thought, wna oct some time ago, but the noble game is evidently stot by any iteans dead yet. if we mty judge ty the heartiness with which the sport was entered into in - the somewhat remote locality wheret- the matth was played. The memters of the Fernvale teita, wnho were tle visitors, were provided with a eapitsl luncheon by their hosts, and, after the matchi were invited to tia. The day was a very enjoyable one, tid its pr'o.ceedings were wotnd up by an etertain sntct given in the evening in the State Suhool, to which seaue of the visitor-e tayed. Theseores in the mnatch have kimlly bee- oupplied to us. but we haos utnt room for titent in this issue. We see, however, that the Fernvale menu made 50 runs in their first ienings and 38 in the eecond--a total if Oh5, to which James Thomsonu contributed 52.
