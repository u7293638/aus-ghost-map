ACADEMY OF MUSIC. T be attendance at tnia place of amusement was not large on Saturday evening, owing, no doubt, in some measure to other attractions. The Academy has been closed fpr soma time undergoing repairs and improvements, and has recently been sublet to Messrs. Davison and Wilks. who ODened with Professor Penner'a ghost. business, which they announce as "St. Vincent's Spectrescopc." It would, perhaps, bo unfair to judge of the merits of the show from a first night's point of view, as many of the effects were spoiled by the mismanagement of the gas arrangements, but taken as a whole, when everyone has settled down to his or her work it would be safe to predict a fairly suc cessful season for the mauagement. Caterers for the public should never begin beforo they are ready. Mr. Leston, as a ventriloquist, will compare favorably with others of his profes sion; but there was altogether too much same ness in the dialogue and jokes, and it would be refreshing to get something new. In the monologue entitled " The Spirit Tempter" the acting of the Anciont Knight was ridiculously amusing and the supposedly pathetic scenes were received with roars of laughter. Some of the apparitions and illusions were well managed. The performance had one especial meritâ€” it was over by 10 o'clock.
