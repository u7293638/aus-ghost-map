THE MEEKIE BURGLAR. OPERATIONS IN PERTH. A SMART CAPTURE. In view of the recent shooting at Fremantle, when tho local police camo in for some severe- criticism at tho hands of tho Proas, it is onlv fair on an officer effpctiu'1 a smart capture to accord , him his full meed of prnise. Last night the inmates of a bonrdiug-hoiifioin WcsfcPorili.closoto the railway station, wore disturbed from their Coolgardian droains by somebody moving about in an adjoining room. Ono ot tho bravo3fc of the boarders (all Perth boarders are bravo) slid into his unmentionables, and went out in search of a police-constable, his efforts being rowarded with success. Tho officer pulloil down his tuuic with both hands, tilted his cap on to tho back of his head, braced himself up, imd, 'all eiigor for tho i'ray,' ploughed noido lessly' through tho land. On hip arrival ho was met at the gato by u long array of Lcmrdura clad in spotless white, looking for all tho world as if a eomotery had broken looso. Breath lessly thoy pointed (a la the ghost of Hamlet's Royal papa) to the room whore footstnpa woro plainly audiblo.as if of someono out on a voyago of dis covory in search of all the valuables. 'Hi3t !' whispered the- officer as,norving himself up for a desperate resisttmco, he crept noaror and noarer, and with a rush— quick aa meditation or tho thoughts of lovo (wo believe our Shakespeavo ia correct)— ho seized tho intruder— a goat! Possibly, if this is outored up on the officer's record-sheet, promotion may follow, 'in the Bweot by aud bye.' In any case, thero is considerably moro souse in capturing goats than in firing at unoffending oitizeus.
