Disciplinarian though he wos, howver, he liked little the task which was now befotu him. He loohed up irem the papers, which were atretohred out on the rloketcy little round table, with a sudden movement, and bent hie frowning gaze upon the accused. The young man returned his gaze steadily, but the colour in his checks grow deeper. ",Herhbrt Dtreoeex, you stand accusld of a crime which, in your profeaeion, nothieg can palliate or excuse. thevr you anything to any for youreclf ?' "There will be no need for me to say anything, sir," was the prompt reply. " It in true that I turned my back upon the enemy, but It was to face a greoter danger. The man whoso life I saved cam disprove this cruel charge agoinst me in a moment. I admit that, from your point of view, ap pearanone m 0 auspicious, but yOU have only to learn from my halif-brother, iReport Dnvereux, why I quitted my post, and what I eilecton by no doing, to absolve me at least from all suapicion of cowardice, how. ever much I may be to blame A a matter of otecipine." General Lunton appeared surprised, a little relieved. "I hope cc," he said, not unkindly. itRoberts, sand am erderly to Lieutenant Deveronx's tout, and command his proesce at once." The man withdrew, and there was a few minutes' delay. Then the entrance to the test was lifted up, and a tall, dark youon man, with thin but decided features, And flashing black eyse, stopped forward. He was handaeme, altar a certain type, but his exprceslon was too eeilches and esperilioms to be prepoesessiog. Gtuorea Lxton looked up and nodded.

Â£egrly, and with a connident light in hir fair voeng face, the prisoner turned to wards the man to whom those words wear addressed. lint alowlyand ieliberetely the latter turned his bhck upon his half-brother without noticing his glauco ni appeal, and with a scornful light in his ayes.

The peculiar curve te the defile behind trench 4 anfortunateln hid you from the field of battle and prevents further evidence no to the occurrence which, yee say, took place. But that your story is false no one an espoeebly doubt. The place has been carofullyexamined, and there are no dead bodies within a hundred yards. It seems, from your appeal to your half-brother, that you expected him to shield you at the exponse Of his honour. This lie and false nasttmont oc yours you muet retreact if yu Leope for any mercy from me." There was a ooevalive agony In the boy's white. strained facet s he drew himself ap, and leaked half piteously, half indignantly at hit judge. Bat when he tried to speak he could not. and there was a minute or two's dead silence whilst he was struggling to obtain the mattery over himself. All ex reeted a confession, and General Luotoa removed his eyes from the prisoner, and bent close over his papers, thot none might lea l the compassion which was in his heart, and which was reflected in his face. The words came at l lt ; and shrill and incoherent though they were, there was a ring of geonine dignity In them. " General Leuton, I have been guilty neither of cowardice nor falsehood. I swear before God, on the sword which my father himself pat Into my hoods before I loft Eogland ; by everything that Is meat holy to me I swear that my account of this awful occirrence in true, Ask the men of whom I was in o cmmand heAn I caught sight of -ef him "-and ha pointed with a trembling finger and a gesture than which nothing could have been more dramatic to his half hrother-" ask them whether I bore myself like a coward when those spears ware whistling around us, er when we were fight ing hand.to.hand after the first repulse. fleat knows that I did noe. i left my pras to neounter a greater danger still. iittoerly do 1 regret that I ever did so ; but it is the 'niy Indiscretione f which I am dellty.

Your ?ommission is forfeited to the Queen, whose uniform you have disgraced." Never a sign of guilt in the prisoner's countenance. Proadly and indignantly he looked his General straight in the f?ee, hit cheeks red with a flgsh, which was not of shame, and the wild fury in his heart blat. lag out of his eyes.

Colonel Sir Charloe overox dropped the oigor which he had been peacefully smoking, aod brought to a sudden halt his leisurely perambulation of this, his favorito resort. Before him, with droeping head, with ounken obeeks, and with deep blank rime ondor his eyes, stood his eon Herbert, who, only a few weeks ago. had departed on hi. firot campaicgn, a heppy, caroeless young asub. Was it, indeed, his e00, or was it a ghost that had stolon upon him out of the gloomy shadows of the vast goliccy? "Iovalided I Would to God that I was dead I" broke from the boy's quivering lips.

Hie son had oank upon his knees b. fore him, and the moon was throwing a ghastly light upon his haggard, supplicating face.

About A mile seaward from Porlook, separated from it by a narew strip of the mowt luxuriant meadowland in Devonshire, lire the village of Boreington. Perhaps it were better called e hamlt, for ate the time when I know anything about it (whioh, let the tourist remember, is mwny years ago) it consisted but eof six or seven ottege, a farmhouse, and a halfruined old manor house, for the privilege of living in which my father pid ten pounds a year, or some such trifling sum, to the neighbouring clergyman whose property it was. Ben what the place lteked in size was certainly atoned for-and more than atoned for-by the beauty of Its situatlion. Bigh ebovo It, like a wighty grotrotieg giant, rore liorelngton hleadland, covered always with a roft, springy turf, and glow. ing in midsummer with tIe brilliant ooiour. rg of rich puopl htether and yellow gorso. olten nave I rtood on its highest point, and weth my head barod to the strong fresh nreeze, watched the sun rles over the Dart moor Hills cod D hnkerry Beacon, and waited until it shed its first warm gleams on the white oottages end queer cla church. tower of ?otlook, which lay oluetlrod to. gother in plotueorlUo irregularity at the head of the little bay. And almost as often have I gazed upon theo wme scene from the nenoe spot by the lets distinct hut more harmonieou light of the full harvest moon, and have wondered in which gnieo it seemed the fairent. Behind iBosington lay Allorcombe oVoods, great true-ooored hills sloping on one ride down to the road which connected, end still coneocts, i'orlock with Minehead and the outeide world, end on the other, dee. cending preolpitonely to the sea ; so precipi. tously ldeeod that it teemed always a wonder to me how the thickly growing but stunted fir treon could preserve their shape end regularity. The descent from Berring. ton foadlind into i'orloek wan by e stoep winding path through Alloroeombo Woods, end many l time I have looked through the thin eoating of green loeaves upon the nbolds which tretoohed like a pioea of petohwork below down to the see, and wondered whether mny" other country In the world (I htd never boon Out of Devonshire then) could be more beautiful than this. Within a etone's throw of where the blue son of onr English Bay of Naplep rippled in on to the firm white rends, was the tgmble. down old building in which we lived.

"I know it, my boy," he said, pityingly. "I have boon expectinog this. You are weary of the country." I stood op, with my hands in my pockets. and my back against the latticed wall of the house, gazing overo the sparkling, donniog seon, to where, on the horionen, th starse eemed to stoop and moot it. Was I tired of this quiet home ! I oarcely knew ; country sports and ontry sights were donr to m t s aod I had no desire to leoe them for over. I thought of the fat trout in the Exord wstrems, oand the huntsman's rallyinog all from "t'other aide Dnkerry," and the woild birds that needed so muach getting and such quick firing, and of ths doeep seon fishing, and the shoti inp the oomb from Frmo, r I'utlsford'e boat, oand of the delighto shipping ona hot snmmer' doy and diving deep down into the cool obracing water. Why shold I wish to leave all this'. What should I he likethly to find pleesontor in the world of which, so yet, I h.o nothinog? For a moment or two I hesitated-bht it was only fnr a moment or two. The ruatloeesoss which had been growing up woithin meo for years was bullt upon na solid foundation, end wouold not b fleenood. "No, i'm not tired of the country, father," I answered, slowly. "I love it too maeh over to be tired ofit. aBut men don't generelly live all their lioves In ono p'aeo, do they without having any work or anything to do except enjoy themselves 7' And what should you like to h e" my father nwked, quickly. I had long ago made sp my mind upon that point, and was not slow to anuwer "I should like to be a soldiers," I do' olsrod, emphatically. I was very little propnred for the rusult sf my words. A spatm of whatseeomed to he the most acute pain psseod across my fathor's face, and he covered it fora moment with his hands. When he withdrew them ho looked lhie a ghost, denthly pale in the golden moonlight, and when he epoke his coice trembled with emotion. "God forbid that you should wish It seriously t" he said, " forit is the one thing which you can never be." " Oh, Hugh, you do not mean it really ; you do not wish to go away from us 1" I turned round, ,for the voice, a soft nnd guetlo one, was my mother's. She was standing In the open window with a fleecy white shawl around her read, and her eyes, the sweetest 1 over saw, fixed appealingly spon me. I glauecd from one to the other hlankly. for my disapoiutmont was greot. Then, like a flash, a sudden conviction laid hold of me. Â£hMru was some great and mystoriouo reason why we had lived o loung apart from the world. (To ho (b'Clnncd,.)
