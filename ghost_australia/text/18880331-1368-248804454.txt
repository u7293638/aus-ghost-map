ROSE LEAVES. Tinder the feet of the years, Hidden from life and light, With its burden of grief and tears, The past has gone from my sight, Leaving only a dream And a lonely grave by the sea; And a song -with )ot& for a theme, Set to a miner key. like one who gathers the leaves Of a fragrant rose that is dead, -And sighs as he sadly grieves At the life and beauty fled; So I, from the buried past, Call back in its bloom a rose, â€¢And wonder if dreams that last Are the best that man over knows. I bore only a dream in my heart, And a face that is cow in my eyes1 Can a new love's smile impart The love that never dies P Can rose leaves, withered and dried, Be stronger than flesh to bold The love a new love would buy With itB coin of beauty's gold ? In my heart lives only a dream, And the ghost of a past that ii dead. In mine eyes the liviDg eyeB gleam, By fleeting desire fled. But the withered leaves in my hand Are sweet with the rose's breath, And a voice from the shadow-land Is-stronger than life or death.
