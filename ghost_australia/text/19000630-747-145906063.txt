Dear Worker, — Have lately been an unwilling and troublesome inmate of one of our local hospitals. Being a violent lover of rules and regulations, I respect fully submit the following simple ones to be plastered on to those already in existence : — 1\. Every patient, on admission, shall conceal his identity, and name and ad dress, and shall deliver to the first man he meets his watch, hat, purse, and boots, together with such articles as he may have stolen from the man who brought him in. 2\. No smoking allowed in the dead house, and the patient who thinks he can do it had better try ! 3\. Patients who blaspheme while undergoing surgical operations need ex pect no mercy. 4\. Every patient must regard it as a privilege to do hard labor about the premises. 5\. All patients must bathe regularly — once a year. 6\. The oath of allegiance is required of every man on admittance ; loyal intoxi cation, a khaki uniform, or free railway passes will be accepted as proof of loyalty. 7\. Patients must eat, drink, and sleep well, and make love to the nurses in their spare time. 8\. Visitors are only allowed to speak to a patient when there is no shadow of a ghost of a doubt left in the minds of the resident medical officers that said patient is a corpse. 9\. Patients must not leave the hospital without permission of the undertaker. 10\. Patients must not leave unclad even when their clothes have been eaten by moths in the hospital storeroom. 11\. Patients disregarding above rules will be cured. There now!— 6x8.
