_y<-»_T^>* AND COMMENTS. POLITICS IN NEW SOUTH WALES. There is collapse and consternation again Sir Henry Parkes has chosen to sit still and allow his majority to lapse from him A few bold well chosen words would have saved him with his party, but he was too proud or too contemptuous to give them utterance Mr John Want a leading barrister, once Attorney General of the colony, was chosen to resurrect certain charges which four j years. go, were preferred against some great firms of Australian carriers, and to associate them in some way with Mr Pelion recently appointed one of the Railway Commissioners in New South Wales It is very peculiar to find Mr John Want in this ) ole, and to remember that a few years ago he was Attorney- General of a Government which proposed to deal with the frauds so called in a trenchant and thorough manner, but only succeeded in bringing them to an abortive issue The story of the railway frauds was almost the story of the downfall of the late Administration It was felt that the prosecution was weak, vacillating, by no means in earnest Several leading and wealthy citizens stood charged with robbery of public funds, or rather with a conspiracy which defrauded the state of its due through manipulating weigh bills they were said to have kept to themselves at least £100,000 which should have gone into the coffers of the state, and which they had really taken from their own clients under false pretences There was a general cry in the colony for justice, and in the Parliament no little outcry for something like blood An ex-Minister of Works was in the dock It was expected that he would shortly be joined by other leading citizens But just when the trial was approaching, the Chief Justice, Sir James Martin, before whom it was to have been held, sickened and died '1 has delays occurred, and during the period of suspension a general election was held, and the Parkes party came into power Several members of the late Parliament who had been loudest in denouncing the "frauds" were appointed to office as Ministers, and a very prompt and impartial sifting of all the charges made was confidently expected But Ministers in office seemed ruled by different impulses to members in opposition The lapsed prosecu tionswerenotrenened Weeks, months. years passed, and the railway frauds ' would pro bably have passed quite out of memory had not Mr Want, who claims to know more about them than any man living, relished them in connection with Mr Fehon Mr Want was primarily responsible for the prosecution, and should have been chiefly concerned in its successful issue, but he allowed it all to lapse till a Victorian came across to take a place on the Railway Board Mr. Want chose to go at Mr 1 shop, assistant Commissioner of Railways, therefore the present Government is dethroned It is a peculiar crisis, hardly comprehensible to us in Victoria It Mr Want believed that fraud had been committed why did he hold his hand for four years, and so permit the men principally concerned to escape He had himself initiated and managed the abortive prosecution He must have known levi dence sufficient existed to justify any prose cution must, indeed, in his own mind have formed a clear opinion of guilty or not guilty against those charged nth-the conspiracy of fraud and yet he makes no move towards prosecution, I cops silent and holds his hand does nothing and sijsnothmgtillanoppor tunity and temptation to persecution occurs then launches forth Itisnota very creditable or enviable position in which the learned gentleman appears. Still there is a measure of retribution in the matter. The Parkes Government came to power pledged amongst other matters to push thee prosecutions through they allowed them to lapse wilfully and completely The present Minister for Mines had been loudest in denouncing the wealthy swindlers who had so robbed the country, but all his choice died out when once he had secured the emoluments of office. The Ministry indeed allowed the prosecution to I rose and die in most ignominious fashion, and there is some thing of justice in the way in which its ghost is raised now to scare them from their seats Yet what a travesty of government is the whole proceeding, and what a pitiful example does it afford of that almost insane arro grace which makes the weakness of Sir Henry Parkes He ' sits like God " in his place when duty calls him plainly enough to save his party and the state. He has but to say to his accuser and opponent ' You who know, you who are primarily responsible, speak out If any man is guilty of fraud, Mr Pelion, or another, place him as you should at the bar of the Criminal Court or cease to molest and malign him " ten minutes of strong straightforward manly speech from the Premier of New South Wales two nights ago would have saved his party, and, as we fully believe, cleared Mr Tenon and covered his adver sane with confusion and shame. He did not, would not, speak them, and why ' It is a peculiar and difficult question. Some folks say the Premier is weary of his party His party is based, indeed, on his own personality, and he may be wearied of the load But what will be the result of his resignation How did it affect him and his colony, and how will it share USA It will pay us to consider that last matter with a little care Sir Henry Parkes has resigned. Mr Want has declined, and Mr Dibbs has undertaken to form Ministry, but the result must ultimately be an appeal to the country, and a (.cncriilelection probably almost simultaneous with our own And what will be the cry of that election' It will be well for all our candidates for Parliament to consider that question carefully The two colonies will be profoundly agitated, and all the pools of public opinion and popular pre [ judges will be stirred to their deepest depths The cry of protection, which has of late been very blatantly raise! in New South Wales, will he received, and with tenfold vigour, throughout the electorates 'the protection | advocates in the elder colony will play every word that loraine places in their hands, and what an all conquering trump will they have it we push our insane crime about the border stock tax That Scully trumpery matter upset the 1 ulcer of the station, which really contained the most progressive measures the colony has been for a quarter of a century It ranked, more over in Sir Henry 1 makes s mind on his first visit here, as was very plainly seen And through the elections in New South Wales it will be used as the most powerful weapon of the protectionist party and as ample justification for the Ux tMionn which that party, if successful at the hustings, will certainly enforce Will our farmers and their friends look at this matter with a little care' Will they remember J hint simultaneous with their war-cry for a shilling a head on sheep and a pound on bullocks, there will be another raised across the border for a tax on every bag of potatoes and wheat and oats and child, on every truss of li a j tin 1 head of cubbine, as on every boy- and sale of luaiuilicture I hoods It will come to be a very serious business if the battle H fought out on these lines, and the (rattle,: of the financial policy of a le tons on to New South W nies will mean loss to us and disaster to them Hut is such a ballot pending' 13 that strong Government of New South Wales early in the pangs of dissolution Are we to say) or is history to record that because Sir Henry Parkes was bulky, the policy of the eldest Australian colony was subverted' Jove nods Olympus. troubles, but Sir Henry Parkes refuses to nod or perhaps nods 111 dramas and the Olympus he rules topples headlong credit is difficult to prognosticate any thing of so eminent in the older colony It has been Band there are no politics there, and the it is no progress 'Ino Parliaments invoiced elected now to deal with that great qui action of the proper disposal and settlement of the hinds.

No one /itieaetllemeut, no irrigation, no active and effective war against the ever increasing pests. The Parliament now supposed to be on its last legs was elected chiefly to put the finances straight, or at least in the way of getting straight What has been done in that direction? The last we hear in the way of finance is, that the leading journal of the colony gravely refers the Budget back to the Treasurer for correction. In the early or the mediaeval days, the affairs of the metropolis of New South Wales were taken quite out of the hands of municipal officers, and delivered over to a commission. The citizens were, indeed, declared to be incapable of managing their own affairs. And yet it is I doubtful if the affairs of the city of Sydney were ever in a worse muddle than are those of New South Wales at the present time.
