Poor things, they were like a pair of ?children in their emotion, much as they ..were ? in everything else pertaining, to mundane affairs. Delicately formed, 'StSlicately nurtured, they were like a couple of exotics battling against a rude east wind in their, present struggle for .'existence. She with her music lessons, he with his fugitive writings— what- hope was there for' either of them? They had managed to live with the aid of that timely loan ol Mr. Bob Billington's ; and with Hope, -manufactured on: an extensive scale, but -on a very shadowy basis, they sauced theii -daily bruad. ?--?.-???.:?

And just as before, Pi Felix found himself outside the. office in lit » twinkling. . ' ci( He went into a restaurant and ordered loi some coffee, and thought to himself that at Mr. Bob Billington was the most incom- yo prehensible specimen of humanity that ne his experience as yet had discovered, as His present resources barely amounted to ac twenty ahillings,and the transformation of st those shillings into golden sovereigns by th the following morning was a magical feat til considerably beyond hiB powers. Perhaps w the financier would listen to his entreaties to in the end, and that was the reason why he qi told Felix to see him at the theatre. Or perhaps Mr. Billington had not the ac remotest intention of seeing him at the ft theatre, and had given him the pais in w order to get rid of him arid his trouble- ai some importunities. For although Mr. pi Billington had read Mr. Felix Vane with oi very considerably accuracy,, that, young gentleman had been wholly unable to re- b( turn the compliment, and hia general lm- w pression of-the characteristics of the sub tle financier was a very, confused ,one, for be the? only fact he'\felt'' certain about wbb, r_: that^any thing that Mr. Billington did or ir said, could not 8urpriBevhim much.
