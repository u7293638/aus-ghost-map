TRINITY SUNDAY. Although the Sunday after Whitsunday has been specially observed in honour of the Holy Trinity from a very early age of the Church, the title ' Trinity Sunday' was unknown until a comparatively modern period. It is worthy of note that in the English Churches alone all the Sundays from now until Advent named 'after Trinity.' In the Roman Church they are 'Sundays after Pentecost.' This is one of (he smaller evidences to the fact that the Church of England was not of Eoman origin. Whatever may have been the history of the Festival and of its title, it forms a grand and fitting goal to the course of the Christian ear. The purport of the season through which we have passed is to set forth the Incarnate Life of the Word of God, and to reveal, as on Whitsunday, in what manner that Incarnate Life is now quickening the Church.. The more we enter int.) the mysteries of the Incar nation the more are we led on to acknowledge and worship the Eternal Trinity, of Whose power and love it is the manifesta tion. All other mysteries resolve themselves into this one We have thought in Advent of the waiting of God ; at Christmas, of His humility ; in Epiphany, of His methods of manifesting Himself ; in Lent, of His life of toil ; on Good Friday, of His passion ; at Easter, of His victory ; on Whit .sunday, of His bestowing of Himself upon men. Behind all these there is a deeper mystery lying. The mystery of God Himself — His Eternal 'Being, His Eternal glory. Thus the contemplation, of the Incarnation and its fruits finds its full satisfaction in the revelation of Trinity Sunday, when we adore the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, the fellow ship of the Holy Ghost. — Heavenly Mysteries, by Canon Vernon Hutton.
