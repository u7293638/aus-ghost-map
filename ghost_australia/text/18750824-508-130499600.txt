A Ghost Story. HrmBnTO free from notoriety of any kind — ob- jectionable or otherwise— our district (says tbe Tcjmut and Adrlonq Tihks) is likely to become famous for supernatural visitations. Two ghosts have been seen lately, one at a certnin spot between this and Aaelong, tbe other at Reedy Flat. Tbe ?first mentioned fcays regular nocturnal visits to a pirty of raadmakers in tbedireciou mentionod, but vanisaee whenever tbreatening measures are resbrted'to. A hammer, fur instancp,.was thrown at him, or tier (for the sex ia not quite certain), tbe other night, but without killing or disabling the intruder. Tfae 'presumption ib, it must have gorTe clean thjrouRh tbe visitor, for a etraigbt aim was takep; and a miss impossible. Qowever, no body, dead or injured, or any part-thereof, could be dit covered. That at Keedy Flat assumes the form of a candidate for marriage, and comes to regain the affections of bis intended bride, which were nipped before fruition by tbe death, of him who now takes this unusual form of renewing bis addresses. Tbe lady ie frightened oat ef bar wits, and bolts tbe moment the candidate appears. Tbe police have been consulted in the matter, and have given such instructions as may lead to the unraveSKng of these unpleasant mysteries.
