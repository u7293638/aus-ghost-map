8TBAY&0TE8 PROM THE PORT. By Timothy TmtAB8B- CRICKET. tBBKAKTU KABBltCD AMD BlUaLS TEAKB. This was a match made between the above, and came off on -Friday, the-£6th November. It was the opening play of the season, and the first scratch on the new Cricket Ground at the Port, ft -was anticipated the turf would have been anything ijut Batnfftotory ; however, it proved very tolerable. There was certainly a little unyielding, but, it will, with some further attention and ex pense, in the course of another year turn out a capital pilch. Messrs. Humble and Back were chosen Umpires of the contest, aad their positions throughout gave entire accord to both sides. Mr. Mnrmion, as Captain of tbe Married Team, won the toss from Mr. Parker, the Captain of the Singles, which seat them to the wickete. Alas! for the fate of the poor Benedicts, they had not the ghost of a chance against the Single Team from the first moment. Their bowling, their fielding, running and general activity, portrayed marked evidence of decadence; and yet, as will be seen on casting the eye over the scores of the married batsmen, many former good hands of the willow were there. The Singles Team was exceptionally strong and active, sundry feats of agility being achieved that would have commanded applause at Kensington Oval, and caused LiUywhite to smile approval. This augurs well for the coming season, provided always that none of the -Singles merge during the season -into the opposite ranks. The Singles were too powerful for the doubles, and fairly might throw down the gauntlet to any opposition that could be brought, from Perth, or other parts of the colony.
