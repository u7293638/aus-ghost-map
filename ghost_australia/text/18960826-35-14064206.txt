The Chinese Mission in our own dio cese is in an improved financial condition, and the land in Wexford-street for a ohurch and minister's residence is paid for. It is hoped that the foundation stone of the new buildings may be laid at the tune when the General Synod is assembled in Sydney. The contributions from the Diocese of Sydney to the New Guinea and Bellender Ker missions were only £166 and £131 respectively, but £316 were contri- buted to the general fund of the Board of Missions, and about £580 was contributed to tho Melanesian Mission.
