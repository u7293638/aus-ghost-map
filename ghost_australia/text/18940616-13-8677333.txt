THE PEOPLE OF THE MIST BY H. RIDER HAGGARD, (Continued from Saturday Last.) CHAPTER XXXVI. HOW OFFER CAME BACK. After he had rested a while at the bottom of the glacier, Otter set to work to explore the cliff on the top of which he found himself, with the view of descending it and hiding himself at its foot till nightfall, when he hoped to find the means of re-entering the city and putting himself in communication with Olfan Very soon, however, he discovered that if he was to return at\M he must follow the same route by which he had come the day was still young and he knew that it would be foolish to attempt escape from the pool before dark in front of him the mountain rose steeply till, go far as he could judge, it reached a pass that lay some two miles off, at the base of the main peak on whose snows the priests had watched the breaking of the drive Bart of this declivity was covered with blocks of green ice, but here and there appeared patches of earth, on which grew stunted trees shrubs and even trees and flowers Being very hungry), itoccurndto Otter that he might find edible roots among this scant) vegetation and with this hope he began to climb the slope to be revealed in due course by the discovery of a vegetable that he recognised, for it was the same which had been offered to him on the occasion of his unlucky outbreak, that had resulted in the casting away of the rubies With this poor food the dwarf filled him self and having found it bough that made him an excellent staff he continued his climb, desiring to see what there might be on the other side of the neck Arm ing there without any great difficulty, Other stood ostoniBlic i, although in a general way he was not much given to admiring scenery Between the neck of the pass and the snow field stretched a mighty rift or chasm, with Bidia so sheer that no boat could have kept a footing on them Yet this gully was not without its bridge, for rising from the bottom of the chasm was a rock wall that formed the bed of a glacier which spanned it from side to side, being in some placES comparatively level and in others having descents almost as sharp as those of a waterfall lins remarkable bridge of ice that varied from a hundred pages to a few ) area in width was bordered on either side by the most fearful precipice, while, just where its fall was sharpest and its width narran eat it seemed to spring across a space of nothingness, like the arch of a bridge thrown from bank to bank of a river In deed, at this point the line became so attenuated that in the glittering sunlight Otter could not be sure that it was not broken through for a distance of some yards Being of an inquiring mind that dwarf decided to satisfy himself upon the matter All around him lay slabs of rock, some of which were worn perfectly smooth and to the thin ness of a tombstone by centuries of polishing in the iron jaws of glaciers Selecting one of these of convenient size Otter approached the edge of the bridge, pushing the stone before him over the frozen snow Here the ice was perfect except for a slight hoar frost that covered it for the action of the wind prevented the snow from gathering on it and whenever the sun was strong enough to meet its surface it rose again at night, so that no slide upon a parish pond could have been more slippery or free from inequalities Otter gave his atone a push, and away it went Sometimes swiftly and sometimes at a tight" speed, according to the nature of the angle from which it passed, leaving a bright green ribbon upon the ice in its wake, whence it swept the hoar frost as it sped Once or twice he thought that it was going" to stop but it never did stop At length it approached the steepest and narrowest part of the descent, down which it rushed with fearful velocity Now I shall see whether the bridge is broken thought Otter and just then the stone, travelling like an arrow came to that portion of the glacier where, for a width difficult to estimate, it stretched issue ported over spick and measured only some few feet across On it rushed then seemed to leap into the air and once more speed forward till it reached the further slope of snow, up which it travelled for a distance, and stopped, appearing, even to Otter s keen bight, no larger than a midge upon a table cloth Now, if a man had been seated on that Blom, he would have passed this bridge in safety, Bud Otter to himself yet it is one that few would care to travel unless bure death were behind Then he turned down the mountain again for the afternoon was advancing When he reached the entrance to the river bed sunset was at Tahiti Some while he oat watch a big the fading light and eating some more roots which he had gathered then he crawled into the passage and commenced his dark Come journey towards the home of the dead Water dweller though what he was to do when he got there he did not know No accident befell him and in due course he arrived said, his journey being much facilitate 1 by the stall he bore, which enabled him to feel his way like a blind man After a while loneliness took hold of him he tried to sleep and could not font seemed to him that he saw eyes staring at him from the depths of the car and heard dead men whispering to each other tales of their dreadful mess Moment by moment his fears grew upon him, for Otter was very superstitious Now he fancied that he could distinguish the head of the reptile named in fire and resting on the edge of the rode as he had seen it that more m" Then to comfort himself he began to think aloud, a one, 1 Other unlucky) that you are, why did you not die at once instead of hung on to be tormented b) ghtistB' Perhaps your muster, the Baas, whom alone you love is dead now and waits for you to come and serve him You are very Und, su) now, Other would it not be well if you took that rope which is about j tar an Idle and hung yourself thus tott too would become a ghost an I be able to do battle with them in their own fashion And he give the 1 Ion 11) line of a sudden he grew fearful indeed, the short wool stood up upon his land, his teeth chatter d and, as he said afterwards, his very nose steamer to grow cold with terror 1 or as he sat he heard, or seemed to hear a voice speaking to him from the air, and that voice Ina mustors "Otter Otter, said the voice He made no answer, he was too frightened Otter, is that you' ' whispered the voice again Then he spoke "Yes, Baas, it is I I know that you are dead and call me, Give me one minute until I can make my rope, and I will kill myself and come to you " " I thank j on. Other Bind the voice with a ghostly attempt at a laugh but if it is all the Burne, I would much rather that you came alive ' Yes Baas and I too would rather stop alive but being alive how can I join you who are dead ' ^ on fool, I am not dead said Leonard 1 linn Bias, how is it that you speak out of the air '' Come near to me that I may touch you an 1 be comforted ' I cannot Offer I am bound and in prison al etc von 'Bibra is a hole in the floor and if you have a rope, na Ihearl you Bij perhaps you could climb up to me Now the dwarf 1 twin to understand Bluing, he stretched the long start he had with him just above his land and found to Ina di light but he could touch the roof of the cave Presently) the point of the State ceased to press upon the rock ' 15 the hole hue Runs' and Otter "It is here but you must throw the stick up like a spear through the hole, for I uni tied, and cannot put out my hand to take it has) a while,Iiaaa , first I must make the line last to it .'Ooitrii.hl 180 in the United States of America, by II Al Her Hair and The right of publishing this work throughout the colonies of Australasia has been purchased by the proprietors of 1 In Argui, Good, but be swift, for I am in danger " Hurriedly Otter undid the hide rope from about his middle, I getting it securely to the centre of the stick Then some five feet be low the stick he made a loop large enough for a man to place his foot in, and having ascertained the exact situation of the opening in the roof of the cave he hurled the stick upwards and jerked at the line. It is fixed," whispered Leonard from above " Now come up if you can The dwarf required no second invitation Scoring the rope as high as he could reach above his head he began to drag himself up hand over hand, no easy task for the hide cord was thin, and cut his fingers and his right leg, round which he had twisted it to be a better purchase Presently, however, he succeeded in setting his foot in the loop he had prepared when he found that his head and shoulders were in the hole, and that by reaching upwards he could grasp the staff which lay across it The rest was easy, and within half a minute he was gasping at his masters side "Ifavcyoualtnife, Otter? " Yes Baas, my small one the big ones are down there. I will tell you that story by and by "Never mind the story now, Otter My hands are tied behind my back Peel for the lashings and cut them, then give me the knife that I may free my legs ' Otter obeyed and presently Leonard rose and stretched himself with a sigh of relief. " Where is the Shepherdess, Bass ' ' "There, in the next cell they separated me from her, and since then I have been dangled by the legs over that hole bound and gauged, I fancy in order to persuade her to consent to something or other by the sight of my danger, for doubtless she was placed where she could see all Then they left me, and I managed to spit out the gag, but I could not undo the cords I expect that they will soon be back again "Then had we not better fly, Boas?" I have found a passage that leads to the moan teams " "How can we fly and late the Shepherdess, Other Since I have been held down the hole only two men have visited me from time to time, for they think me helpless Let us seize these men when they come in, and take their knives, for we are unarmed Then we can think , also we shall have their key of " I am ready, Baas, ' said Otter, " Where shall we stand' " Here," answered Leonard, leading him to the door " We will crouch in the shadow, one on either side of this door, and when the priests have entered and closed it, and begin to look round for me, then we will spring upon them Only, Otter, there must be no bungling and no noise "I think that there will be none, Bank, they will be too frightened to cry out at first, and after that they will become dumb " ' Otter, whispered Leonard, as they stood in the dark, "did you kill the Water dweller''' " Yes, yes. Baas," he chuckled in answer "I caught him with the book that I made ready But he did not die easily, Baas, and if I had not been able to swim well he would have drowned me " " Oh that is all very well," replied Leonard, and suddenly added, " Hush I Be ready ' As he spoke the door opened, and two great priests came through it, one of them bearing a candle He who bore the light turned to shut the door, for he suspected nothing Then at one and the same instant, Leonard, emerging from the shadow, dealt the first priest a blow upon the head with Others shaft which stunned if it did not kill him, for he fell like an ox beneath the pole axe, while Otter, standing where he was dexterously cast his hide rope about the throat of the second man, and drew the noose tight with a jerk that brought him to the earth In twenty seconds it was all over The men, who were the same that had held Leonard suspended in the oubliette, lay senseless or dead, and the dwarf and his master were engaged in possessing themselves of their knives and Leys by the light of the candle, which, though it had fallen to the ground, fortunately remained burning " That was well done, Otter,' said Leonard, " and I am not ashamed to have done it, for those devils kicked me when I was bound how we are armed, and have the keys What next' Just then Other sprang to his feet, crying, lookout, lines, here come more Leonard glanced up to see, and behold ! the second door in the cell was opened, and through it came Juanna, Clean, Join, See, and three other men For a moment there was silence then one of the captains cried out, "Seed Jill the god has come back, and already he claims its victims'' And he pointed to the two priests line followed a scene of confusion, for even 01 fun and Nain were amazed at what seemed to them little short of a miracle, while Leonard and Juana had only eyes for each other, and the three captains stared at Otter like men who Munk they see a "host Only one person in that company kept her head and that person was Seas The captain who guarded her had loosed his hold, silently she slunk back into the shadows, and, unseen by any, vanished through the doorway by which she had been led in A minute passed, and Otter, third ing that he heard a noise without the door of the cell by which the two priests had entered, and which had been left ajar, went to it and tried to open it Just this also, Off in missed box "Where is the woman, hams daughter?" he cried, " It seems that she has escaped and shut us in, King answered Otter, calmly followed by the others, Olfan sprang first totliedoorot the cell where they were, and then to touch the coast cling passage to that of Juanna s prison. It was true, both were closed, " It matters nothing, here are the keys," said Leonard "They will not avail us, Deliverer, an swered Olfun, for these doors are made fast without by bars of stone thicker than my arm Now this woman has gone to rouse the college of the priests, who will presently come to kill us like caged nita " Quick I ' sin 1 Leonard, waste no time, we must break down the doors "Yes, Deliverer, ' said "Sum mockingly. "Batter them in with your lists, cut through the stone work with your spturs , surely they will be nothing to your strength ' ' CHAPTER XXXVII "I AM REPAID, QUI IN " Their position was terrible Son had escaped, and boa knew everything More over, she was mad with hatred and longing for revenge on Li onord, Otter, and in a less degree on Clean the king Had they succeeded in revealing themselves to the people all would have gone well, for Otter and Juanna would certainly have been accepted as true gods, who had passed and repassed the gates of death scathless But now it was another matter She would tell the truth to the priests who, even if they were inclined to desert her father in his extremity, must strike for their own sakes and for that of their order, which was the most powerful among the Pi epic of the Mist, and had no desire to be placed under the yoke of secular authority It was clear to all of them that if they could not escape they must full story shortly into the hands of the priests who, knowing every thing, would not due to all w them to appeal to the army, or to the superstitions of the outside public not only good card they had was the possession of the nelson [of rain, though it remained to be seen how a far this would help them to begin with there are always some who would be (real to step in to the shoes of a high priest also Nain had blundered so extensively in the matter of the false soils Unit tin p r ate r part of the fraternity, whom he had involved in his mistakes, would not sorrow to see the half of him 'These facts, which were perfectly well known to 01 fan and guessed at by his com prices, Blmrpened their sense of danger in which they had been placed by boats ready rugs and a mining Indeed, their escape was a matter of life and di att to them and many hundreds of their adherents. If once they could reach the temple and proclaim the re arisen gods to the people all would go well, for the army would suffice to keep the priests from using violence But if they failed in this, their death warrant was already signed, for none of them would ever be heard of again No wonder, then, that they hurled them selves despairingly upon the stubborn door For an hour and more they laboured, but all in sam The massive timbers of hard wood, six inches or more in thickness could scarcely be touched by their bites and spears, no might their united strength servo even to stir the stone bolts and bars that held them fast, and they had nothing that could be used as a battering ram " It is useless ' said Leonard not lost, throwing down his knife in despair, " this wood is like iron-it would take us a week to cut through it "Why not try fire, BaaB'" suggested Otter Accordingly they attempted to burn down the doors, with the result that they nearly stilled themselves in the smoke and made but little impression upon the wood work At length they gave up the experiment-it was a failure-and sat looking blankly at each other as they listened to certain sounds which reached them from the passages with out, telling them that their enemies were gathered there "Has anyone a suggestion to make '" said Leonard at last, " If not, I think that this game is about played "Bass answered Otter, "I have a word to say We can all go down through that hole by which I came up to IOU The Water Dweller is dead, I slew him with my own hand, so there is nothing to fear from him Beneath the hole is a tunnel, and that tunnel leads to the slope of the mountain above. At the top of the slope in an ice bridge by which men may reach a fair country if they have a mind to " "Then for heaven's sake let us cross it," put in Juannn. "I have seen that bridge, said Olfan, while the captains stared wonderingly at the man whose might had prevailed against the ancient Snake, but never yet have I heard of the man who dared to set his foot upon it " " It is dangerous, but it can be crossed, ' replied Otter, " at the least, it is better to try it than to stay here to be murdered by the medicine men " " I think that we will go, Leonard," said Joanna, "if I am to die I wish to do so in the open mr Only what is to become of Nam ? And perhaps Olfan and the captains would prefer to stop here s ' "Nam will go with us wherever we go," answered Leonard grimly , " we have a long score to settle with that gentleman As for Olfan and the captains, they must please themselves " "What will you do, Off an" askedJuanna, speaking to him for the first time since the scene in the other prison. "It seems, Queen," he answered, with downcast eyes, "that I have sworn to defend you to the last, and this I will do the more readily because now my life is of little value As for my brethren here, I think that, like you, they will choose to die in the open rather than wait to be murdered by the priests " 1 he three captains nodded an assent to his words and then they set to work ' First they took food and drink, of which there was an ample supply in the other cell and hurried!) devouring some of it, disposed the rest about their persons as best they could, for the) foresaw that even if they succeeded in escaping it was likely that they would go hungry for many days Then Leonard wrapped Juanna in a goat skin cloak which he took from one of the dead priests, placing the second cloak over his own shoulders, for he knew that it would be bitterly cold on the mountains Lastly, they tied Nam s arms behind him and deprived him of his knife, so that the old man might work none of them a sudden injury in his rage All being prepared, Offer made his rope fast to the stall, and descended rapidly to the cave below As his feet touched the ground the priests began to batter upon the doors of the cell with beams of wood, or some such heat) instruments "Quick, Joanna!" said Leonard, sit in this house and hold the line , we will let you down Harr), those doors cannot stand for long ' Another minute and she was beside Otter, who stood beneath, candle in his hand Then Leonard came down "By the way, Other." he said, "have you seen anything of the jewels that are supposed to be here ' ' "There is a bag yonder, by the Water Dwellers bed, Bans," answered the dwarf carelessly "But I did not trouble to look into it. What is the use of the red stones to us now ? "None, but they may be of use after wards, if we get away " " Yea, Baoa, if we get away, answered Otter, be thinking himself of the ice bridge " M evil, we can pick it up as we go along " Just then Nam arrived, having been let down b) Olfan and the captains, and stood glaring round him, not without awe, for neither he nor any of his brethren had ever dared to visit the home of the Snake god 'then were captains descended, and last of all came Olfnn "We have little time to spare, Deliverer, said the king " the door is falling ' And as he spoke they heard a great crash above Other jerked famously at the rope, till by good luck one end of the stake slid over the edge of the hole and it fell among them "No need to leave this line for them to follow 1)), ' he said " results, it may be use ful At that moment something appeared looking through the hole It was the head of one of the pursuing priests Nain saw it and took his opportunity " The false gods escape hythe tunnel to the mountains he screamed and with them the false king follow and fear not, the V water Dweller is dead. 'Hunk Not of mt Nain but Blay them with an oath Often struck him heavily across the mouth, knocking him backwards but the mischief was done, for a voice said in matter " We hear you father, and will find ropes and follow Then the) started. The ball, Otter, where is the bog? " asked Leonard " Here, Baas,' answered the dwarf Leonard took the bag, and, opening its mouth which was drawn tight with a run ning strip of hide, peeped into it while Other held down the. candle that he might see From its depths came a glimmer of red and blue light that glowed like the heart of some dull fire "It is the treasure, ' he said, in a low tone of exultation. "At last the luck has turned ' How much does it weigh?" said Joanna, as they sped onwards "Some seven or eight pounds, I should Bill, he unsewered, still exultantly " Seven or eight solid pounds of gems, the finest in the world "Then give it me, she said, "I have nothing else to carry ion may have to use both join li mels presently "Inn heunsivired and passed the string of the bag over her head and they winton up the smooth sloping 1 ed of the stream, stiff ing little inconvenience except from the cold of the water that (flowed about their ankles The stream has been somewhat Baas, since I passed it this morning Doubtless this did a sun has melted some snow on its Bouict To morrow we might not have been able to travel this road "Vii) likelt, answered Leonard "I told you that our luck had turned at last twenty minutes » more and they reached the month of the. tunnel, and passing between the blocks of ice, found themselves upon the mountain she After a minute s hasty discussion they set to work to fill up the mouth of the tunnel, or rather the cracks between the blocks of ice that ulna 1> encumbered it, with such materials is to hand, namely lumps of frozen snow, gravel, and a few large stones which they were fortunate enough to died in the immediate vicinity, for the darkness rendered it impossible to search for these at a distance While they were thus engaged they heard the voices of priests speaking on the further side of their somewhat incoherent barrier and worked harder than ever think ing that the moment of attack had come To their astonishment, however, the sound of voices died away "Now where have they gone'" said Leonard- to climb the cliff by another p Uh and cut us off' "I think not Deliverer," answered Olian, " for I know of no such path I think that they have gone to bring heavy beams, by means of which they will batter down the ice wall " Still there is such a path, King," said one of the captains, " for I myself have often climbed it when I was young searching for snow flowers to bring to her whom I courted in those days " "Can you find it now, friend'' asked Olfon, eagerly. " I do not forget a road that I have trod, ' said the captain, "but it is one not easy to follow " " See now, Shepherdess," said Olfan, after thinking a while, shall we take this man for a guide and return down the cliff to the city, for there, unless fate is against us, we may find friends among the soldiers and fight out this battle with the priests " No, no," answered Tuanna, almost passionately, I would rather die than go back to that dreadful city to be murdered at last Do you go if you will, Olluu, and leave us to take our chance " That I cannot do, queen, for I am sworn to a certain service," he said proudly ' But hearken, my friend, follow this path of which you speak, if you can do so in the darkness, and find help Then return swiftly to this spot where I and your two comrades will hold the priests at bay Perchance you will not find us living, but this I charge you, if we are dead give it out that the gods have left the land because they were so evilly dealt with, and rouse up the people to fall upon the priests and make an end of them once and for ever, for thus only shall they win peace and safety." Making no reply the man shook Olfan and the other two captains by the hand, saluted Joanna, and vanished into the darkness Then they all sat down in front of the month of the tunnel to wait and watch and very glad were the) of the goatskin cloak which had belonged to the dead priests for as the night drew towards the dawn the cold became so bitter that they could scarcely bear it, but were obliged to rise and stamp to and fro to keep their wet feet from freezing " Leonard,' said Joanna, " you do not know what passed after Nam trapped you, and she told him all that tale When she had finished he rose, and taking Olfan by the hand, said, King, I thank you May fortune deal as well with you as you have dealt by me and mine ' " Say no more, Deliverer, ' answered Oltan hastily , " I have but done my duty and fulfilled my oath, though at times the path of duty 13 hard for a man to follow" And he looked towards Joanna and sighed Leonard sat down and was silent, but many a time both then and in after days did he wonder at the nobleness of mind shown by this sax age king, who, under circumstances so cruel, conquered his own passion, and was willing to lay down life and throne together that he might carry out his vow to protect a stranger who had brought him so much pain, and now left him for ever with his successful rival At length, looking at the mountain peak above them, they saw its snotvB begin to blush red with the coming of the dawn, and just then also they heard many voices talking within the tunnel, and caught glimpses of lights flashing through the openings in their rude fortifications The priests, who no doubt had been delayed by the procuring of the timbers which were to serve as battering rams and the labour necessary to drag them up the steep incline of the tunnel, had returned, and in force A few more minutes and a succession of dull thuds on the further side of the ice wall told the little band of defenders that their enemies were at work " The light grows quickly, Deliverer," said Olian quietly "I think that now you may begin to ascend the mountain and take ' uniform ' "What shall we do with this man?' asked Leonard pointing to Nam. " Kill him," said Offer 'No, not yet awhile ' answered Olfan "Take this," and he handed Leonard the spear of the third captain, who had left it when he started down the mountain, fearing that it might encumber him, and drive him along with you at its point. Should we be overpowered you may buy your lives as the price of his But should we hold them back and you escape, then do with him what you will " I know well what I would do," muttered Otter, glowering at the priest. " And now, farewell, went on Olfan in the same calm voice "Bring more ice, comrades, or alone if you can see any , the wall cracks Leonard and Otter wrung the kings hand in silence, but Juanna could not leave him thus, for her heart was melted at the thought of all his goodness "Forgive me," she murmured, "that I have brough up on grief, and, as I fear, death to follow grief." " The grief you could not help. Queen, and be sure I shall welcome death if he should choose me. Go now, and happiness go with you. May you escape in safety with the bright pebbles which you desire, and may you and your husband the Deliverer be blessed for many years in each other's love, and when you grow old together, from time to time tells kindly of that wild man who worshipped you when you were young and laid down his life to save you." Juana listened and the tears sprang to her eyes, then of a sudden she seized the great man's hand and kissed it. " I am repaid, Queen," he said, " and per- chance your husband will not be jealous. Now go, and swiftly." As he spoke, a small portion of the wall fell outwards and the fierce face of a priest appeared at the opening. With a shout Olian lifted his broad spear and thrust. The priest fell backwards, and just then his companions arrived with stones and stopped the hole. Then the three turned and fled up the mountain side, Otter driving Nam before him with blows and horses, till at length the old man fell and lay groaning on his face. Nor could the dwarfs blows, which were not of the softest, force him to use. "Get up, you treacherous dog," said Leonard Savagely, pricking him with the spear. "Then youmustloosemyarms, Deliverer," answered the priest, " I am very weak and I cannot travel up this mountain with my hands bound behind me. Surely you have nothing to fear from one aged and unarmed man." " Not much at present, I suppose," muttered Leonard, though we have had enough to hear from you in the past." And taking his knife he cut loose the rushings, While he did so, Juanna turned and looked behind her. Vat below them she could see the forms of Olfan and his companions stand big shoulder to shoulder, and even catch the gleams of light reflecting upon their spears, for now the sun was rising. Beneath them again she saw the grass grown roofs of that earthly hell the City of the People of the Mist, and the endless plain beyond through which the river wandered like a silver serpent. "Oh, what I have suffered in that place I" she thought to herself. " How have I lived through it, I wonder' And yet I have won something," and she glanced at Leonard, who was driving Nain towards her, "and if only vicarage, and I am the remains of enabling him to fulfil! his vow and buy back his home with these jewels I shall not regret all that I have on hand to win them. Yes, even when he is no longer be very much in love, he must always be grateful to me, for few women will have done us much for their husbands." Then Nain staggered past her hissing cursing, while the untiring Otter ruined blows upon his back, and losing sight of Olfan and his companions they went on in safety till they reached the neck and saw the ice-bridge glittering before them and the wide fields of snow beyond (To be Continued Nat Saturday.)
