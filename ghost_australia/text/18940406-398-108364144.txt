THE SECRET OF A. HAUNTED HOUSE. A rather curious lawsuit is reported from Paris. A gentleman living in the Avenue de Nenilly was terribly annoyed with rats in his house. They were large, ravenous, numerous and hard to catch. Finally he managed to trap one of the pests, and, equip ping him with a tiny hell, fastened to his neck with a bit of wire, set him again at liherty. The rat, of course, ran to find his companions, and they all ran as eagerly to avoid him, and in a little time there was not a rat left on the premises. Near by there lived a nervous gentleman, and one night he was awakened by a curious tink ling sound, which came on fitfully, and seemed to proceed from every corner of the roan. He lit a candle, and timorously pro ceeded to search. There was nothing vis ible, and yet the mysterious sound Win dis tinctly audible. He tried to think it was imagination, but failinsr, decided it must be ghosts. It was clear his house was haun tod—and haunted, too, by day as well as by night. For weeks he could uot sleep> and the anxiety told on his health. At laet a gossiping servant learned the truth, and the victim, instead of laughing at his own ©redulity, has begun an actios against the man who belled the rat.
