IN the enlightened days of the Nineteenth Century one may be forgiven for haring en- tertained the notion that ghosts and other imaginary creations bad long long since been consigned to scientific oblivion. But a New York paper is responsible-among sundry fables of the easy going, never-tell-the-truth-if you-can-belp-it style - for the following, which will or will not gain credence, according to the amount of intelligence people are gifted with. In the middle of the night in the month of February, four middle-aged women and two men-the latter merely to perform the mechanical portion of the work, however, -entered the churchyard of the Roman Catholic Cemetery at Birmingham, and pro- ceeded to disinter the remains of a,beauti- ful young woman, who had been buried a few days previously. They were not mere body - snatchers, but were actuated by a spiritual enthusiasm, which has so often led others with more enlightenment into grievous errors. The lid was forced off the coffin, and then the object of their mid- night task was revealed. The four women - including the mother of tbe corpse-rapidly ran their fingers through the grave-clothes, and then wita needle and thread the shroud was sewn up. Once more the lid was fastened on, and-for the last time, let us hope-the coffin- waa lowered to its proper resting place. The reason for their repulsive task is as extraordinary os one can possibly conceive. By what may be termed a careless oversight, the shroud had been pinned instead of sewn ; and the women, being of a superstitious nature, believed if the corpse was buried in that manner the BOUI-by what process is not explained-would be confined to the grave for all eternity. One of the women claimed ta have seen the ghost of the girl for three rac cessive nights ; and conceiving ita appear I ance to be the result of the pins, and I unable to stand it any longer, she consulted ber friends, and the result was their noc- turnal expedition.
