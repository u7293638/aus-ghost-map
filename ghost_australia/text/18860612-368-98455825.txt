GUNNING. From our Correspondent. WE have had fine clear weather here for the last few days, and clear moonlight nights, with sharp frosty mornings. A splendid shower of rain fell between 6 and 8 o'clock last evening, when the sky cleared up; but during the night rain came on again, and continued almost without intermission up to two 'o'clock to-day (Thursday). It is still cloudy, and threatening more rain. A con- siderable quantity of rain must have fallen, as I hear that Burriong, a short distance from here, was in a flooded state. The ghost mystery has been solved, and proved to be a half-caste woman, who had just returned to town after an absence of some weeks, and going to, as she thought, the camp, which had previously been at this par- ticular place, and seeing the tents of the strangers, made for them. She had on a new white blanket, which was all that could be seen in the dark, hence the dismay and dis- comfiture of those who saw what they thought was a ghost. April 10.
