§£kctcb ftotrg. FARMER BROWN'S CONCLUSION. Welt, the first I beard about 'em Was through eome boarders we had. That talked about microbes and suoh things Tflll own I was fairly soared. We've lived on a farm for thirty odd yean, And bin middlur healthy, too ; We've raised eight good, smart children, Whioh's as well as most folks do. But last summer we took some professors, And they made my blood run oold, For ghosts and goblins warn't nowhere Compared to the yarns they told About microbes that swim in the water And fly on wings through bhe air. That hare feet to walk about with ^ And am stick to your skin and hair. They peeked over the edge of the well-curb To see if the bucket was dean, And analysed the pertaters To find the Paris green That I put on the tops in earlyspnng Afore the pertaters was growed ; __ Then how they thought it oould get inside Was more than ever I knowed. They wanted our Tom-oat kept to home Because one of 'em'd heard a oase Where a cat brought home a disease in its fur. Though there warn't one to ketch in the place. They went np into the paster. To see if the oows eat weeds ; For if they did the milk we used Would be full of colic seeds. Well, after they'd gone away in the fall Matilda she says to me — ? ? The beBt thing we can do, Caleb, Is to let the whole thine; be.' So we come to this conclusion. No matter what microbes might bring, A little bit of learning Is a mighty dangerous thing.
