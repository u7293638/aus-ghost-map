MUNICIPAL. -- (To i^ie lfditor of'the Chronicle !}' ' H Sm,— The dect of theT^tepayers seem deter- , mined to wiE^or iSemselves notoriety by their eccentric induct of i municipal affairs. i ;Nor sooner are they rid . of the £20 vote -difficulty, than they deliberately impale themselves -on' the horns of a dilemma if possible even more preposterous. I refer to the unprecedented course adopted in respect to the appointment of their - officers: Advertisements appear in viting applications from qualified persons to fill cprtam «itnations--»ffiCiMit, !common «en66 wonldsuggest, .-through the death, resignation, or dismissal of the late,holders, who in ^either case ought not.to-be thought -of as 'Candidates for reappointment. But it appears that neither death*- reaignatiorvor dismissal* have occurred, nor, so far ,as I can - learn, has there been so much-as-the -ghost -of an imputation ^ -oa-^ie : conduct or efficiency of the present officers ; on the Contrary, the -aldermen generally are re portod-tohave expressed .themselves perfectly' satisfied with 'the past, and have confidently predicted that each will be reappointed I . Is it then intendejL to. have 'duplicate-officers' in the different- departments named i\ In :? this matter- the ? Council are -certainly not-acting wisely even* if -the feo'urse adopted 1 is free from legat ambiguity — which, with Judge Innes's ruling in the caSe of Eent.v: the Council in jny mindi ; .! T^bink is jppen to .'question. If the preseirt;. Sffife»^ ..haye ^iven sati^fctdpp, what good purpose «in possibly be served byichai^ ing them^for otheis who jnay or;may not give equAl-isatisfaction. /- I have.iearddt urged that the-Council «verer1compelled' bylaw to adver tisfr . in consequence of the amalgamation 'of two offiees ' and ' ^he ' alteration' of aH' the salaries. ^ I -do' ^nbtr know what dawafe on the^^^^mu^d ddring the an^mm ;Tjnt certain jr^m it jvas.snajt thnB ihey acted in the { palmy^4ays yore. When-the offices of ; whan and town clerk were amalgamated fetme four years ago^— if my jnemoiy serves, me .cor rectly^ — ^iIr. Cunoingham, who was at the time wharf clerk, Vas appoiiited chief of the amal gamated offices without the farce of advei ris ing ; and wheD these xtffices were again sepa- j rated Mr. C. had- the choice of which office he would retain, and bad his appointment con firmed without the indignity of being turned out, and made humbly to ask for re-admission. Again, I believe last year the ; salaiies of the wharf-cler^ rate collector, and municipal in spector were each altered, and yet it does not appear the alteration in any way affected the tenure of their original' appointments^ I notice by your, report of a special meeting of the Council on Monday last that a Mr. W. Gr. Wooletone was elected as assessor for the East ward.' Is not this' gentleman one of the appointed audi'-ors ? If so, permit me to direct his special attention to clause 51 .of Municipal Institutions Act - 1 It is evident there are men in other spheres of life besides ''coachmen' who pride them selves on their ability to drive their shandry dans ' within half-a-mile of -the edge of a dan gerous precipice — a qualification which may evince reckless ^driving, but which I fail to see the usefuluessof . The 'alderman most to my mind is he who will- at-all times strive to keep the municipal shandrydan. : as far from the brink; of any legal peecipice as circum stances-will permit. : ' ' ??
