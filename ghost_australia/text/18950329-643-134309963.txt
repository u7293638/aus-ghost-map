For i an hour he argued desperately with bur on . tbe advisability of lyirg still. She declared j that if ho wouldn't investigate she must die or get up herself. Finally tbey affected a t compromise by oreeping out of bed together. t They lit tbe lamp and looked cautiously, out of the chamber door. The first glance, Bolved tbo mystery.
