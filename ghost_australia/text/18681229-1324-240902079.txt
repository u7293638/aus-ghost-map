CONCERNING " THE GEEATEST PLAGUE IN LIFE "—The ordinary servant girl is not a very elevated creatnre. The education she possesses is just enough to enable her to read the very vilest trasb, and to write as great, if not as vile, trash to her young man, or men, as the case may be. Her moral education has teen worse than ber intellectual. The chief attributes of her character are vulgar vanity, gluttony of admiration, and a dread of ghosts. Yet ohe has one redeeming point—she is veiy fond of dogs and babie6; and she shows her fondness by cramming both with tbe uuwholesomest stuff ihe .can, her n»tii>n of kindiit-ss being to poison tbem. Ber great ambition is, when she goes ont of a Sunday, tó be mistaken for a lady; to Wfect which ends she ought first to make herself dumb, and then invisible. No man can look at her but she immediately begins to ttiggle, if, indeed, she waits to he looked at. and does not take the initiative by sniegerini!. which sit e takes t"r an expression of modesty. If she is ugly, she buys her ymng man, probably a worthless soldier who trades upon tbe only soldier-like thing about him, ilia uniform: or, if she is pretty, perhaps her young man buys her gaudy bonnets, and sham jewellery. The m-re ambitions are sensible enough to know the difference between real and sham millinery, and insist upon having eveiythiig juet like tiieir tni-tress real -lace, real kid-gloves, Sx. This .nay seem a hard and cruel picture; we wish it were not -a true one. —Tomahawk.
