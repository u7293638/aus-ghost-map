WATERLOO CUP BETTING. On the eve of the Waterloo Cup draw, it was but natural that some important move should transpire in connexion with an outside nomination. Mr, li. ii. Lord's sale of greyhounds provided the sensation, for Leo line, who became the property of a well known Sydney bookmaker, at the high price of 270 guineas, it soon oozed out would run for Mr. J. McRae, a Victorian course. Previous to the purchase of the bitch, however, the parties interested had not been idle, and they secured all the money available at long prices, so that the nomina- tion in a couple of hours was landed into the front rank. The list was called over at the Mitre Tavern yesterday evening at 8 o'clock, in the presence of a large assemblage. The betting was the most extensive since the issue of the nominations, and it was close upon 11 o'clock before the list had been run through. Mr. Bailey's name opened business at 50 to 1 to the extent of about £400, when 10 to 1 was offered. Then Mr. Bromell came into the market, and was bucked to win nearly 1.3,000 at 40 to 1, which price, however, was on offer at the finish. Mr. Chirnside opened at 10 to I wanted, with 100 to 11 offered. The first price was therefore laid to £300, the taker offering to book it all round the table ; but the fielders pulled up at 100 to 11, when 500 to 55 was booked and wanted. Glendubh, it was generally put about, was the representative of Mr. Cookson, and 50 to 1 was secured to all the money, followed by 40 to 1 to several hundreds in addition Mr. D. Davies was backed at Gil to 1, 150 to 1 40 to 1, and 100 to 3, to win fully £5,000. Mr. Donovan was backed to the extent of a thousand at 25 to 1, then a few hundreds at 22 to 1 and 20 to 1, the latter figure being on offer. Mr. Gore supported his nomination for £800 at 50 to 1, 40 to 1 then being offered. Mr. Hepburn was backed at the oLtsideprice x 100 to 1 to win 1400, and Mr. woman's name was written down at the same figure to 4,¡>Q0 The Sjilnuy nomination of Messrs. W. and J. Lee found a supporter to 1700 at 00 ,e>. 1 and 1500 at 50 to 1, whilst £1,400 was jookedaboutMr MontgomerieutlOOtol. Mr. M'Culloch took 200 to be five times about his nomination, after which 20 to 1 was offered and Mr. C. M'Culloch was the medium of some speculation at 50 to 1. After this Mr M Hare and Leoline came on the board To commence with 100 to 7 was booked twice, followed by 100 to b close on to £1.000 and 1,000 to ') was finally offered A good amount went on Mr Neustetel at 10 to 1, and Mr. Oliver was backed to win a couple of thousands at 100 to 2, Mr Harvey Patterson opened at the forlorn price of Ob to 1, which was. however, accepted, as also 50 to 1, and eventually 40 to 1. One feature of the evening's proceedings was the retrogression of Mr A. Park, who, it will be remembered, last week touched 100 to (5, but now CO to 1 was taken and offered Mr. Mundaynowannounced that Mr. Quinlivan, intended representative had gone amiss, and that the nomination had been placed in his hands Mr. A. R. Robertson was supported by commission at 40 to 1 and 100 to 3 to win about £2,000, and Mr. J. B Scott took £1,300 at OF to 1. Mr. Sydney Smith opened at LOG to 1, but about £2,000 went down at 50 to 1 After this 40 to 1 was offered, and the taker, still being willing, took some hundreds at the price. Mr. W. K. 'J Thomson's name gave rise to a lot of speculation, thereby showing that a good representative had been engaged. To commence with, £1,400 was written down at 100 to 1, then 1,000 to 15, and finally 1,000 to 20 Mr. W. Thomson was also hacked to win 1500 at 100 to 1. A rival to Mr Chirn- side now sprung up in Mr. Tilley. Opening at 10 to 1, which was booked to about £1,200, 100 to 11 went down twice, and was wanted, the two nominations named now being equal favourites Mr. W. Watson was well supported from 20 to 1 down to 20 to 1, Red Hind, it is understood, being his intended nomination The market prices of the evening are IIB follow - 100 to 11 agst Mr Chinisldu (fit and wtd) 100 - 11 Mr 'J »ley (Pk and E Ki) 100- s-Sir M'Iiuc(tk. and win) 20- 1-5th W W olson (Ik und u ul) £6- 1-Mr »lilu!it|.likiii(tk handed) to- Mr Donovan (to and oil) '22- Mr W M Tulloch (tk and wtd) 500- 7-Mr M'Quado(tk) -13 - 1 Mr. D Davies (tk and off) 33- 1 Mr Pearce (off, JO to wed) 33 - 1 Mr Swan (of!) 76 _ 2-Mr Ballina (tk and wtd) 40- Mr Hammond (tk and wind) 40-hour Lawford (tk and wd) 40-1 --- Mr Robertson (Mr and wd) 40 Mr S Smith (tk and off) 40- 1 Mr Rounsevell (bit and off) 40-hour Koustotol (fit and off) 40-hour Cookson (tk and off) 40- Mr llromoll.tk and off) 40- Mr A Smith (off) to- Mr J H Patterson (and) 60- Mr A L. lark( and and) 60- Mr R Paterson (tk and yd) TO- 1 Mr Bailey (that li by W- M Core (tk and wd) 60 Mr Jones (to and wd) 60 Mr Lord (to an 11 til) 60 Mr O M 0 Blood (fit and well) 00 - Mr W h TI cases (tk and off) 60- Mr J T li. lor (Ik an I off) f0 - Mr traitor (tk and off) 60 Messrs W and T J 1 co (oil) 60- Mr A Leo (oil) Oil - Mr Oliver (tk freely ) 08- i-Mr torre track and the) time - Mr A Clarke (to an 1 off) 00- Mr J H Scott (tk and off) 100- laborer J Clarke (of and a Id) 100- Mr Wolsteiilolieftl) 100- Mr W 1 lion son (of ) 100- Mr Munday (tk) 100- i-Mr Montgomerie (at) 100- Mr Ouroso (tk) 100- 1 Mr Dibden (tk and off, 100- Mr lrasor(kau1 or) 100- 1 Mr Inman (to an I off) 1904-5 Hor ham (fat and oil) loo- Mr Williams (off) 100 - Mr Willis (off) 1904-5 Town (off) 100- Mr Thomas (of) 100- Mr Uonnlok(oti) 100- Mr Hoctor(o(I) 100- Mr plant (off) 100 - Mr W I Sturgeon (off) 1904-5 Hall (off) 100 Mr J M'Culloch (of) 100- Mr T walking (off) 100- l-Mr Harris (off) 125- Mr Holt (off) 160- Mr Co lard (tk) 200- Mr Boioilde,o(tk).
