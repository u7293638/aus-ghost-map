IN DEATH'S VALLEY. (FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO CIUIONIOCE.) Death Valley) is known as the relation of the lowest depression in the world, besides claiming the flattering appellation of being the hottest place on earth It is also Â£30ft below the level of the sea. The valley is 75 miles long and from eight to fifteen miles wide On the east the valley is bounded by the I uncial Mountains, which attain an ele stationed from 6 600ft to 8 600ft. and on the west it is enclosed by the Panamint Range, which reaches a height of from 8 000 to 10 000 We arrived at the entrance or level of Death A aHcy and from this point saw for the first time a sandstorm When we saw it the northern part of the valley was obscured in a brownish coloured cloud which gradually thinned out until it crossed the entire valley Never at any moment did it entire]) obscure the sun which looked like a mere ghost of itself. The close I moved with great velocity in our direction and soon advance runners or hut puffs of wind reached us On arriving at the end of 1 urn ice Creek wash we saw the sandstorm in the northern part of the valley) This was shortly after sunrise The entire horizon and sk) were obscured by the sand and gravel which were buoyed in an atmos- phere oppressively hot and stifling Soon we were envelope 1 by a dense cloud of sand, and occasionally as a stronger puff of wind came gravel and even small rocks were hurled in our facts We covered our heads with blankets, and the mules instinctively turned their tails to the wind With all these precautions we did not escape for my guides fact and my own became badly bruised and lacerated In our exposed position we experienced all the fury of this desert smooth, and as the winds travelled across the alkali sink they increased in heat to such an extent that breathing bec time a matter of difficulty rainstorm lasted two days and in all this time it was impossible to move from our position We had to camp here for that period, being unable to light any fires or prepare meals Most of this time we were covered with blankets and literally) starved I never want to undergo that ordeal again This was i in the fall 1 he puffs of wind were so intensely hot and suffocating that they can be lil said to blasts from a furnace, and seemed to draw the very breath from our bodies is the storm piled the sand around our waggon and covered everything Occasionally looking down into the valley we could see a large sand auger or spout waltzing hither and thither over the country, carry ing the sand and alkali dust high into the air Though this storm was exceedingly severe to a novice like myself it is incomparable to the ones that sweep over this country) in middle summer in July or August with the thermometer registering from 120 to 127 degrees in the shade, it would be impossible for any living creature to exist in it even from hour After having passed safely through this and storm we continued our journey, and I made a thorough inspection of the valley there is much of interest to be told, but owing to the absence of much of an) data and statistics I would not venture to give you a description of our observations as many of them are based on scientific examinations and tests
