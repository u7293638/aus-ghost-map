HAVE YOU SEEN THE GHOST? One would imagine that the days of " haunted houses" were over, but it appears it is not so, as Stawell is possessed of one of these curiosities. Where it is situated is at present for various reasons kept a secret, rat that it is " haunted" in the most approved manner there is not room for a shadow of a doubt. Eren the most sceptical came away convinced after a visit. In the first place, two owners have died in the house, and one of them it is whispered was rather close. That he made money was generally known, but it never saw the inside of a bank. Vet, strange to say, when he died there was no hoard of gold unearthed. Several other demises have taken place in tiie house, and the present occupants have also lost one of their children. As soon as dark sets in mysterious noises commence, as though all the furniture were loose, or rather, as though the wall and floors were inhabited by **• little people.^ Occasional groans arc heard, and noises that cannot be compared to anything human. Nothing has yet been seen, but the residents are nightly expecting something that may elucidate the mystery. At present they are "all expectation," but so unpleasant have the scufflings and knockings and other sounds become that the occupants sit up till one o'clock every morning, when the interruptions usually scase.— P.
