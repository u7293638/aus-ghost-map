laiCemoriam; '95. (FOR THE REVIEW.) I sat besid^his bed la<t jiight and watched each labored ga.-p for breath, And mourned, as chimed the midnight hour, for '95 now still in deatb ; What jolly times together we had in his mic'dle life and d tys. Though somewhat etmnge at first, he proved '•i»ll right" when once you knew his ways. A,little straightlaced at the start and with good resolution bound, He shunned the bowl, the pipe and song, but later on he came around And joined the boys and quaffed his glass, and in the midnight revels shared, And oft twixt dark and dawn with him upon our homeward way we fared, Not half, so bad was '95— And he is dead and we alive. And '94 and '93 are in oblivion's shroud enwrapped Each went his way, as tripped along the New Year youugster gowned and capped, To join Old Time's procession long—-the ghosts of years that used to be- Now following, close, a , spectral throng gaunt items of Eternity ; Kach well- remembered feature still of dear dead days of joy and pain •Comes to us witliout 'strife of will—ah J could those days come back again When stout of arm and light of heart,' we laugbed at Time—of years the thief- How precious to ns now each .year—we in the sere and yellow leaf; How swiftly Old Time's wheels have spun Since you and I were twenty-one? Hail '96.! Young '90! Your baby hand! Here touch the glass :. Let's toast ourselves, let's toast the pipe, the wine which cheers, the bright-eyed lass ; Our wives and weans, our kin and friends : to each and all a glad New Year, With wealth of gold and want of grief, with rudest health and richest cheer ; Old '95 is gone to rest, you're here and in your praise we'll sing, He was, yon are, wherefore we .shout; " The king is dead ! Long live the king i" With no new vows to better live—old dogs with trouble learn new tricks— We'll do oar best, no more we can—your hand ; here's to you '!)(>. With just a sigh, so far we've run, Oh ! were we once more twenty one.
