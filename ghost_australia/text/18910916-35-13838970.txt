ANOTHER FISHERMAN'S DEPIT TATION TO THE PREMIER. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir, Once more a fishermen's deputation, accompanied as usual, by a union of Ms L A , has into vice ed the Premier, the object being twofold.. the appointment of two practical fishermen on the Fisheries Commission, and the removal of the closure from the upper waters of George's River The first demand is, in my opinion, ridiculous in its very inception if it were granted it would only tend to make confusion worse confounded I should like to know why fishermen mo am more entitled to costs at the fisheries board than selectors at the local board or publicans on the licensing bench ? 'Sty contention is now the same as it always has been, visit the Fisheries Department were properly constituted and efficiently administered there would be no occasion for the admission of any outside influence to its delibera- tions the ostensible reasons why the whereon are so desirous of obtaining seats on the Conlimsjion are amply in evidence their sole object is to remove the edict of closure applied to the upper yy store of the liitich-abUBcd followers I inmate n that under no circumstances should this be benefited, not only in the interests of the general public, but in the interests of the fishermen thousands, who as I have often previously remarked will not see beyond their noses One of tkoutcmbors of the deputation stated that "there were men in the room who had not earned 59 at their occupation for months past, and he attributed this state of things to the Commission " How the latter is to be condemned for such a miserable admission as this is beyond my comprehension The simple fact is if the fishermen mo impecunious and cannot obtain a livelihood at their calling, where does the fault Iron Surely not with the Commissioners, but with the elves Ihoquostion naturally areas, where the fishermen so poor and the fish so dear and scarce ? This is easily accounted for All our local waters are, comparatively speak lug, " fished out " In the majority of instances the fishermen refuse to move further afield They have been u used from their childhood to scrape the shallow s and benches of the local harbours and rivers, and it in quite evident while the ghost of a fish remains in those localities they will continue to scrape them, even should starvation stare them in the face Our coast line abounds with various species of fine edible fish but no effort is made to capture them in the localities of their abundance, for the very simple reason that neither the area nor the necessary appliances am forthcoming Beach - -camping is the congenial occupation of our local fisherman (1) Deep sea fishing is quite beyond show him or coming season and yet the men are -scarcely to be biting d for lins Deep-sea fishing means capital to be employed for its profitable day elopement the 1st tor are not possessed of it, and those who has out prefer i either to invest in bogus mines than to secure the vast treasures contained in the deep sea While such a state of things continues there is no other alterna In of for us but to continue to hunger in the midst of abundance and if all the fishermen in the colony were endowment with seats at the fisheries' board it would make no difference in our fish supply and I must say that to me it is a matter of great surprise that a man possessing the astuteness of Sir Henry Parkes should have given utterance to the following words -" to settle the matter it should be decided then and there to admit two practical fishermen to the board'" join inioiM JlioBocond request of the deputation was that the protected n areas of George's River, extending from Tom Ugly's Point up to Saltpan Creek, a distance of about three miles, should be thrown open to netting in dell race of the proclama- tion of the Fisheries Communion Why con- fine the demand to this locality P Why not moist that all the upper waters of the harbours and rivers of the colony should be by folded up to the rapacity of the fisherman both native and foreign ' Have the public no rights to be conserved ? Arn all the ciicloLcd waterways of the colony To Ira handed over to a few most unreservedly and the rights of thousands to be ignored self our fisheries are to lie resuscitate 1 more river and harbour w tiers must be closed for extended j ends, if not in perpetuity Not the men of the present mt indicate 1 localities should be by London upon the thoughtless stead of a few words came one whose thoughts are only for the day,, taking a i Leo 1 of to morrow Now let us suppose that their untimely requests were granted, and the upper waters of Georges River were thrown open for their time stricted manipulation, what would he the inevitable result As a matter of course the lucidity would be immediately rushed, 40 or 50 boats, each carrying a seine, would scour those placed and near stored waters for a few days and nights, all the fish contained therein both mature and immature would be annihilated the spawning beds would be devastated, and it would take years to amend the destruction caused by the operations of a few days I had the fishermen would obtain some " good hauls of fish is beyond a doubt, but in this game worth the candle." If these quiet waters were left alone the li I would increase in vast ntim bars, and cattle r ghtseisou of thoyoarwoultl migrate to the lower waters of the mu, and scatter them selves around Botany Bay 1 bon would arrive the fishermen's harvest, while the lower north and the spawning grounds would remain intact But no, for a few fleeting hours of " good hauling " all must be sacrificed, the goose must he killed for the golden (gg The scarcity of fish is certainly to be attributed to the continued and indiscriminate netting of the rivers and lagoons for many) long years quit time has not been given them to become resuscitated it is only of very late years that any protection h as been accorded to them, but the fishermen are impatient, they will not wait for results they know the fish are increasing in the upper waters and desire to capture them for immediate gain, regardless of the utter ruin theatre coursing and the ultimate injury they are inflicting on themselves I say again not only should these interdicted waters remain closed, but others should be added to their number, notwithstanding the whining of the fishermen of the untimely aid afforded them by members of Parliament Dion, perhaps, " boach-scraplug " would become a thing of the past, and the fishermen lie down to of iron their livelihood in a more lof/ituniito manner by seeking for their spoil in the deep sea Previous to concluding I desire to oUVii a few civil ments on the letter signed "G IN if," which appeared in your issue of Thursday last Tass correspondent I am sorry to say, can scarcely know anything about the subject he treats of the whole oomiiiiiuicjtioii is one series of absurdities for instance, w him he tells us of a school of sea mullet " chasing and devouring bream and other road fish" the climax is reached and we need go no further It would just be as reasonable to say that a rabbit could chase and devour a greyhound "G H V " further informs us that fish which take but are never caught a note ! Well, this is IIUHB indeed Are bream, whiting, flathead, solos, tailor, He He, never caught in note it but it would be a waste of time to follow your correspondent further in the farcical remarks on our Huh and fisheries but his shark theories are so utterly at variance with facts that a few words are necessary in reply Sharks do not do our fish in vast numbers, " simply because they have not the pony or of doing so Your correspondent in not singular in his belief in this respect It is commonly accepted that barks chase" and destroy huge quantities of fish stirs in not by any means the case Half a dozen porpoises would cause more destruction of fish in a harbour or river in a wool: than would an entire school of share ka in a year A shark is not swift enough to cause such fish as schnapper, bream, whiting, et hoc grant amnesty forte lies among such fish as the salmon and mullet when they are schooling and then only the latter are "top fish," and travel in great shoals Um Sharks follow them, and at intervals stock upon them from the depths below, and frequently gorge themselves to their hearts' content. A chink may sneak a fish now and then but only at rare intervals I have in my time soon Kiandra is of sharks disembowelled, but very seldom have I discovered 1 the remains of fish in the cavities of their not mocha Many huge monsters have been captured In Sydney Harbour, and in most instances, after ibiiBootion, The h of Ingredients found within them were composed of old bags, kerosene tins, bullock bones, old rope, &e; , late " G If V " is wrong , sharks are not great devourers of fish , it is the human or two-legged shark that causes the grey ghost destruction, I am, Ht, September 1,1.
