WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1878. Seven out of the fourteen railways it is proposed to construct in the first in- stance aro selectora' lines, with which we have already dealt. Two of thoso which remain, although not urgently re- quired, are properly scheduled amongst works to be undertaken at an early date. We allude to the lines from Caulfield to Mordialloc, and Hawthorn to Lilly- dale. The first-mentioned is a portion of the contemplated line to Hastings on Western Port Bay. In the opinion of the department this railway will attract business in the shape of market garden produce, fi_h, and, during tho summer and autumn, passengers glad to escape from the heat and dust of Melbourne to the sea shore. No doubt it will secure traffic of this de- scription, but its principal claim to consideration, we think, is its necessity to the completeness of our defensive arrangements. When the forts at the entrance to the channels through the shoals towards the Heads have been completed, we may regard the bay as practically closed to any enemy likely to pay us a visit. In land operations against the capital, Western Port would almost assuredly be adopted as the point of debarkation, and we require the means of rapid concentration in that direction. The second Uno mentioned, viz., Hawthorn to Lillydale, is a por- tion of the main line due to the Upper Yarra district and the country beyond. We havo very little doubt that it will pay, as the country in the direction indicated is rich in many forms of natural wealth. Apart, however, from this consideration, it properly be- longs to a national system of railways. There is one other line which should not only be made, but should be com- pleted with as little delay as possible, viz.,- that to Apsley. Whether Branx- holme is the best point of junction with the Hamilton and Portland line, we cannot say without a more thorough investigation into the sub ject than we have yet made But that tho line ought to bo started from that township or Hamilton as soon as possible, wo have not Ino slightest doubt If wo procrastinate, wo may soo i large portion of our western trade passing into the hands of South Aus traba Apart ft oin the selector^' lines, which stand on a footing of their own, the tluee we have just mentioned aie all out of the firat fouiteen forwhicü, m our opinion, anything like a case can bo made out undet existing cucum stances Let us take the remaining four linos of the first batch in tho older they appeal in tho schedule Bilhrit to Lintons, 21 miles Beyond the fact that this line would accommodate and aggrandise some of Major Smith s con stituents, we do not seo what claim it has to consideiation It is a sort of suburban affair, and while seveial parts of tho colony aie almost inaccessible in the absence of all means of communication, it is perfectly mon stious that a provincial town having good roads tunning in all directions should be supplied with local railways as well at the expense of the state It may be said, howcvei, that tins line to Lintons is only pait of a largei scheme -that hereafter it will be extended to Ellerslie, thus putting Ballarat into direct communication with W-irrnam bool and Belfast by means of a lino in eluded in the schodule We admit tins, but do not îecogmse the necessity iheie is some nonsenso put foi ward in connexion with the Araiat and Avoca junction, to the ofFect that it " will open up the markets of " the northern portion of the colony " and of Itivenna to the potato gioweis " of the Western distuct, and establish " lines of tiado between the interior and " the coast, which would bo impossible " without it We suppose tho same opinions are enteitamed officially with legaid to this Lintons, Elleishe, and Belfast line, but it appeals to m that thoy aie simple "Buncombe The potato and othei grow eis of the west, can take then pioduce by water to Melbourne, Geelong, 01 Portland, foi next to no thing, and leach all parts of the colony accessible by railway without oithei a line norn Araiat to A^oca, 01 one of which tho blanch to Lintons is designed eventually to foi in a part In passing we would call the attention of those interested to the flagrant mannet in which Major Smiths constituents aie fatouied m the Mmisteual pioposals Not only is this submban lino to Lintons included m the list of iaih\ays to bo first tal en in hand, but piousion is made in the schedule to gue Billuat dnect communication with "Melbourne bj connecting Goulons with the Sand buist line at keiloi Study tlio time has not yet come when we can affoid to indulge m the luxuiy of duplicate lines Is o doubt the peopleof Ballaiat are nicoll tenienced and taxed owing to the pic sent necessity of sending then tiaffic lound by way of Geelong, but they should ha^e pi otested ag mist the folly of suboidinatmg their inteiests to the supposed welfare of tho " Sleepy Hollow by Cono Bay when the wrong was ni contemplation They cannot fanly abk toha\e then commm ication with the metropolis ír/ipioted, while many dis tricts aie urtually cut on from Mel bourne in the absence of main loads 01 radwajs Colac to Camperdown, 32 miles This line goes thioughlarge estates, and would not bo proposed, w e imagine, did it not foi m part of the great trunk which it is proposed to run across the Western district from Geelong to Branx holme We think that this mam line is one of the last that should be made, as the Western district is piovided with a multiplicity of good macadamised roads, mostly constructed by means of state subsidies, and also possesses convenient shipping ports The Camperdown por tion might well await the time when it is convenient to take the whole work in hand I anccfiela road to Lancefield, 13 miles This branch is termed a " milk " line, ' and veiy properly so, too, for it seems designed for the special puipose of milking the state cow " Milk line, ' forsooth i Have we not real wants enough that we should go out of our way to piovide appliances suited only to enormous communities and countries already well furnished with essential necessaries 1 We shall be healing ne _t of a " cieam cheese line, oi a "bouquet line, or some other absurdity Richmond to Coburg, six miles lins is about as ridiculous a pioject as theie is in the bill Supposing a necessity to exist for connecting Coburg with the city by rail, would anyone m his senses ever think of carrying the track round by Richmond ? The pioposedlme would leave the Haw thorn branch somewheie between Rich mond hill and the Yarra, and it will be seen that, in compansor with this toute, the piojected outei enele was a short cut This Cobmg folly P meant to be the first section of a lme running north thiough Yan Yean by Whittlesea, and then turning to tlieleft, crossing the north Eastern Railway, and teiminatmgin the township of Kilmore So it appeals that to rewaid Mr Hu- devotion, Ministers are prepared to make some 40 miks of line which will run parallel to the North Eastern foi the greater portion of its length, and eventually cross it on its way to a Government borough The Yan Yean counti v no doubt ought to have railway communication bl ought within reach, but it should be done in some other way A branch from Craigieburn would probably answei the puipose It is not necessary that wo should say anything at present about tho lines, which w ill have to be postponed until more money is forthcoming They are of various degrees of merit Some will undoubtedly be constructed by the state sooner or later, while others will bo allowed to await the arrival of the Greek Kalends, if Parliament be well advised The great thing, as we said before, is to take care that in granting money for surveys the bill distinctly specifies the works which are to be taken in hand If the Assembly should place a large sum at Mr Woods' dis posai, to be expended at his discr.tion, it may find itself committed to under takings which its judgment, enlightened by subsequent discussion, could not approve _ The committee appointed to deal with the subject of an official daily Hansard has concluded its labours, and the House is to be invited to consider and order upon the report on an early day. The committee does not express any opinion as to whether such a publi- cation is desirable or necessary, but points out a plan by which it thinks the object can be effected. This is, that the Government should employ a staff of reporters and should erect powerful machinery at the printing office, and publish a document which should be given to the various newspapers to circulate as a supplement with their daily issues. The necessity of such a publication we are strongly disposed to deny. In the first place, as witnesses from this office submitted, a sufficient report, which does not cost the state one penny, is already in existence. To quote from the precis furnished by the committee of the evidence of these gentlemen, "The de- "bates are fully and fairly reported in "The Argus. The report each day is "in accordance with the importance of "the subject, the intelligence of the "speaker, and his acquaintance with "the subject debated, and are not in- "fluenced by political bias." We be- lieve that our record errs on the side of length rather than of brevity, and that a mere verbatim indiscriminating report reproducing everything, whether of im- portance or otherwise, would be an uninteresting and unattractive docu- ment, repelling far more readers than it would attract. In the interests of then constituents, the newspaper would still have to supply a narrative; this would be perused, and the official supplement would for the most part be treated as waste paper. Mis- chievous results other than the waste of public money are obvious. For many reasons it is not desirable that the leaders of the House should be buried alive by the prominence which must necessarily be given in a verbatim mechanical record to the voluminous bores. As every practical man is aware our Governments are embarrassed already by the amount of talk in the House, and in the interests of legisla- tion and administration it would be better to repress the volume rather than to encourage its growth. However, these are considerations for the House. What we desire to point out, in order to save Parliament from a serious error, is that the committee has fallen into a mistake as to cost which must be recog- nised by every one so soon as it is men- tioned, and which entirely alters the situation. The proposal is to supply the Han- sard to the newspapers as a supple- ment, by which means, says the report, "the widest possible circula- "tion will be obtained." There is no doubt of this. But the committee base their estimate of expenditure on a daily circulation of 10,000 copies, and the absurdity is apparent. The lowest estimate they received in evidence of the requirements of the Melbourne daily papers alone was 50,000 copies, and this number is probably considerably below the mark. And then the country papers have to be considered. We should be very sorry to see Parliament lend itself to a movement to stamp out the provincial journals, or to materially lessen their influence, and to withdraw from them, as is suggested, all Govern- ment custom in the form of the neces- sary local advertisements, and to refuse them even the Parliamentary supple- ment supplied to the Melbourne dailies, could not but have a most prejudicial effect on their interests. The local journals have their own mission to per- form, and a very valuable one it is. They are independent centres of thought, and are checks upon the natural ten- dency in the direction of the colony being too much governed and too much influenced by Melbourne agencies. It would be mere justice to supply the country papers with the official Hansard if the Melbourne papers were so supplied. The House could not resist the demand, and in that case the circulation would at one bound leap up to a minimum which cannot be estimated at less than 90,000, and which probably would be nearer 100,000. Taking the smaller number, and the committee's estimate must be increased ninefold. There is a saving of course in type- setting, the same type sufficing for 90,000 as for 10,000, but in paper, in machining, in stereo- typing, in ink, in folding, &c.;, the in- crease is in proportion to the circulation. And the estimate would be— First 10,000 £9,223 80 000 at £4,500 per 10,000 36,000 Reporting staff 4,150 £49,373 This calculation cannot possibly be ma- terially reduced. It is based on the low figures of the committee, altered only to suit the circulation required, and if there is any little saving on the one hand, we may be sure that incidental expenditure will arise on the other. The committee, it is true, have a set off amounting to £19,000 per annum, but we venture to describe the whole of it as illusory. The Government Gazette, the Police Gazette, and the state advertisements, are all to be thrown into the Hansard supplement, which will be published during the Parliamentary session only. Either during the re- mainder of the year there will be no Government Gazette, no Police Gazette, no calls for tenders, &c.;, or, what is equally preposterous, 90,000 or 100,000 copies of the formal Gazette notices must be gratuitously circulated at an expense of which no estimate is given us. If the Gazettes and the calls for tenders, and other official notifications, are continued in their present form to do their present work, the saving disappears, and if the new Hansard is to be a continuous pub- lication all the year round, very little of the sum will be left also. Any hon. member who gives the subject attention will see that this £19,000 must be struck off the balance sheet (the weekly Hansard item alone excepted), and will realise that if the official publication is to be undertaken, the Treasurer, besides a vote for plant and buildings, must ask the House for a grant of little less than £50,000 per annum. The committee has an alternative plan, namely, "that the debates should be "reported by a Government staff of "shorthand writers, and the copy "supplied by them to the publishers "of the Melbourne daily newspapers, "by whom it would be set up in "type and published in their re- "spective journals;" but the House must also be informed that the committee was distinctly assured that no Melbourne journal would dream of making use of such copy. The plan means that the newspapers should pay the bulk of the expense of the supplements and not the House, and this guileless overture they have one and all respectfully but firmly declined. The House is shut up to proposal number one—the £50,000 per annum scheme. This charge re- presents a capital of a million and a quarter of money, or 250 miles of rail- way, which, when made, would pay for themselves, and would relieve the state of the annual liability. The daily Han- sard demands that the Treasurer shall pay his £1,000 per week for all time without receiving anything in return, and the House is asked to sanction this expenditure when the land fund is run- ning out, when new taxation is officially announced to be immediately impend- ing, and when the strictest economy in every department ought to be the order of the day.
