Great Haul of "Glasgow fvlagistrates."- It is stated, that 10,000 tons of, Glasgow magistrates were taken cut of Loch. Fyne last year. This, is a startling statement (srvfs a London contemporary), especially as Glasgow bailies are generally supposed to.be BIuo Eibbouites, of which even .Mrs.. Or mis ; ten Chant can, approve.. }3ut " a Glasgow magistrate:' is not uecessarily a. bailie ; in fact, he is otherwise known, as a Loch Fyue herring, and why a Loch lTyne herring should be dubbed a.Glasgow magistrate.our revered iriend, 13ailio L^icol .larvie's ghost, can explain. One of the interesting statistical facts relating to 1897 is that iu that year no less than. 207,4 lecw.t ot" Glasgow raa^istratos" were, netted in. Loeb. Fyne. against only G4,12-cwt in 1896. Practically.ail that big haul-was in, the last sis. months, audit w;:. so big a haul that the weight of it burst many, nets, to the .sulphurous, impregnation of the atmosphere in, the neighbourhood,of the-boats. The language of .iishernjeiv—e\f,n of Scotch fishermen—at such times is..apt. to be £requent and free. Tho?e who have nev.«r Seer.', a herring fleet at work, can, have little knowledge of what a reserve of- hardy mariners there,is in. the country after all.
