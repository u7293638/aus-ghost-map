IV. It was quite light when we slipped into our room, unobserved as I thought, for Hubert was fast asleep. We slept late, until we were aroused by our Irish friend, who had just returned from a bathe, he told us ; and by the light in his eye, and his generally pleased expression, I guessed that he had also been saving a quiet tete-a-tete with Mrs.—— A boating excursion was planned, and a few minutes afterwards Hubert and I found ourselves together among the rows of corn, sampling some good sugar melons. He put his arm in mine and led me farther away from the house. ' Phil, old man, congratulate me ; Mrs. ——, that is, Zara, has accepted me.' By-the-bye, did Mrs.—— tell you how that house came to be haunted—or, rather, why they say it is ?' ' It is all rubbish. It is her property— belonged, I think, to her husband.' ' But what relation is she to the old lady ?' ' That I cannot say. But why all this catechising ?' asked Hubert with some warmth. ' Well, my friend, since you ask me, I may as well tell you that my friendship for you and Tom prompts me.' ' Tom !—what of him ?' ' Simply this : he is, or was, also madly in love with Mrs.——.' ' Tom ! why he is only a boy. There are the two girls : surely he don't dream of Mrs. —— reciprocating his mad fancy !' ' I'm afraid he does, or did, at any rate.' ' Did—why, what has changed him ?' ' Well, last night he visited the haunted house.' ' Ha !—ha !—ha ! and saw the ghost, I sup- pose ? Poor boy ! I must talk to him.' ' No, don't talk to him ; leave him alone in his fancies. Talking will do no good ; let them die out.' ' But did he see anything ?' ' There is nothing there for him to see,' said I, evasively. ' Of course not. Ghosts ? why, ghosts vanished from off the face of the earth at the end of the last century. But let us go now, or they'll think we have bolted ;' and he whisked me along through the rows of tall, dark corn-stalks as if I were a feather weight.
