Her bright Bmilo sort of wont through. me. Onco or twice I received a letter from her to post to him, I was sure, not that sho told mo so, bat I could tell it was by the way sho blushed when she handed them to mo. I looked at* tho address and name. It was a broker oa Third street. On the June following tho Valentine'* Day tho family went away, and did not return from out of town until October, but I did not fee the young lady, nor did I have any loiters for her. 'Hasn't sho re turned yet?' I tvoked tho colored waiter. 1 Oh, no, ahe won't be hero till Christmas. Sho is now on the 'coiiiieons' with her hus band. They woro married nt Newport in . August.' 'Oh,' says I. And I thought no more of tho matter ; events had taken their natural cotirro by ending in marriage, as all properly rcgalatcd love- letters ought to do. 11 S!-.e c.-.me bock with her husband at Christmas and began housekeeping in tho Fame fquare as her family, 'bo I delivered her letters. Sho taw mo on New Year's Day, and did not forget me, either. What sho gavo me wan sufficient to buy my wife a warm cloak for the wintor, with enough left over for a pair of ulioc-i for the baby. Tho newly-married couple had a heap of letter.) of all f orti Jdnds and descriptions. Invitations in any number for both 0/ them, and plenty of fcmalo cor rcspondencc for her. He Ecemcd to get let ters from nil part-i of the world, between them they had more than the rest of tho square put together. There teemed to bo gomo change by April. The envelopes of tho letters had the narnci of stere-kevpeni on them, and doubtless contained bill*. The following month similar letters came very thickly in deed, an»! so did letters with Iho names of. lawyers on the tipper right hand corner of tho envelopes. Ho feomed to bo always at hemrj for lie often cimo to iho door himself and took the lessors from me, as if s^iiss-i for tho ser vants not to fm them. A good-looking man ' ho was, with a proud manner and a di&sipatcd; face. '? ' We are going away to-morrow,' said tho colored servant one morning, as I handed ^ him the ordinary batch. ' ? Out of town ? ' I naked. ' ' Oat of dU lown, I f,'UMV lie replied, with a grin. ' Tho .'herifl'a officers are, in tho house.' ' When I wm delivering tho letter* tho next day, a hack drove up lo thn door, and I lingered a moment out of curiosity. Tho lady came down leaning on her husband's arm, looking »o miserable and altered I hardly rtcognirod her. Bhc must have noticed the expression on my face for she nodded to mo and smiled; but such a ghost of a smile 1 A few day* afterward tho things in Um hoaw were told by auction, and now people came to live there ; and noon, amid llio many thought* of life, I forgot all about the young lady. ' It was in Iho summer of 1S77, when I got pat on a routo in Ocrm&aiown.; I was not very well, and thought the country walking would do me good, so I changed routes, with Um permission of the postmaster, wilh a com rade who worked, as I said, in Oermantown. Boning oat my letlera, as I served on« of the pretty, leafy avenues, I came across one ad dr«*i»ed to um old familiar name, Mrs. ? — V and in the husband's handwriting. Tho postmark ni Colorado; so be wm away; that wm evident. Sho wm sitting on the porch of a pretty little collage, wilh a child ' in her arms. It wm e*»y to see she waa no longer rich. The dressc* of herself and child j and Um smallneas and dirtiness of the Irish servant maid, who wm cleaning a parlour window, denoted Um fact at a Blanco ; oat she did not look unhappy, and sho knew me at ooce« * - ? . .*? ' Why, povfmao, ahe exclaimed, ' is it poi.' . sible it can be yoa T ' '' Yes, ma'am,' I say*, ? it is; thanking yoa kindly for. remembering me, and here U one of hi* letters for you.1 ?? She look it from nw with Iho old eager aoM, and m she turned to go into the hou*e I noticed her pntuing it lo her lip*. He didn't write very o(Ua lo her— every two or three v««k*, not more, while sanuUme* much longer interval* elapsed. II uxd lo make me nolle miwrrahM when I noticed her pleading (*&\- m I pa»«l morning after morning with 001 anything for her. '? ' J oa mo quite sore you hare not got one, pottmaa' ', the would ask. .-.. ' Quite snre, ma'am.
