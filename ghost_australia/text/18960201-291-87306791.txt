; ^eiecteb P0ettg- A WEARY WEIRD TO DREE. There is a quaint old Scottish phrase That haunts my memory ; It speaks of dark and burdened days — A weary weird to dree. A weary weird ! Ah me, how oft The cry burste from some eoul, ' Give me a moment's respite soft From this my dreadful dole S To dree the fate, to linger on In daily anxious care, Until all hope and strength are gone, And earth shows nothing fair ; : How many thug from day to day Live this strange ' death in life, ' While all along the darksome way Are bitter curses rife. Until the frame grows wan and thin, The face like to a ghost's— What hope is there of aught to win Of all the wide earth boasts '? 'Twere better, better not to be But we must live our years Though hearts are wrung with agony And eyes are filled with tears. Ah, fateful phrase ! it doth but voice The suffering that is deep, When none may bid the heart rejoice, And brain is barred from sleep. ? A dreary fate to daily bear, This is a common lot ; ?? While unto some the earth is fair, To these delight is not. \- O poor sad hearts, oft wrung with pain, Who shall sure comfort bring ? Tfho yield you olden joys again, ! Such as ye knew in spring ? No angel in a mortal mould Will wipe away your tears, But the Unseen, with love ne'er cold, Will set aside your fears. And when the brighter days are come, \- Aud trials sharp are past, ? And ye reap richer joys than some Whose glory would not last ; ? And ye look back with calmer eyes Deep purposes to see, Ye will but count sis chastening wise The weird ye had to dree !
