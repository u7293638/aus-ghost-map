'(Continued.) George Bought Milly, who was, if one may .confess a thing Whioh should not bo a cause of shame, . in the kitohon making goose berry jam. This is a oonaorve favour ably regarded by the youthful palato, and is oheap. To the adult who is pick some, the jelly of Siberian crab, whioh is soft and ailkv to the palate — as thov sav of olaret and of tea— if preferable, as so is . the preserve made of blackberries, whioh is full-flavoured and fragrant, yet1 fresh from the wood. 'Milly, iny dear,' he said cheerfully, though he was oppressed with the thing he had to face, ' you look delightful in a white apron, and your fingers are bo sticky that you are defenceless.' . ? 'George,' she said demuerly, 'did .you stay away from business on purpose to kiss me3' :i 'Not quite, dear child. On the con trary, I ^have 'a great deal to Bay to you. First of .all, l'have made my cousin Roe;inald miserable, and Copernica as well.' 'Oh! But- why?' : 'Next, I. am going to make you, not miserable, but full of wonder. My dear Milly, a very strange and moBt un expeoted thing has happened. I do not' think I ought to tell you to-day what that is. Indeed, you must not hint or let fall- the slightest suspicion that any thing at all has happened.' ; 'Has it anything to do, George, with— with — with my father V ? ? ' A good deal, Milly.. But ask me no more.' ' Yes, tell me ; is it anything against him ? I told you, George, that I do not love him as I ought to love my father, but ? ' - 'But his honour is a sacred thing, Milly. There is nothing against your father's honour that I know of. Yet re member that Mr. Montorp does not know that, and must not be told or allowed for a moment to suspect,, until to- morrow.' ' It looks like conspiring against one's own father ; but I do not expeot that he will come here to-day.' ' It is not that, Milly, as you will see to-morrow. It is conspiring for him.' 'George,. I do not understand in the least. To-morrow ! Why, he is coming here to-morrow, to' meet. Mr. Richard : about ' the sale of the housos. Oh, my poor, houses ! I am so sorry they are to be sold.' 'I don't think they will be sold,' said George. ' And to-morrow I am to drive about London, to buy fine things for my outfit. ' ', Perhaps you will riot take thatdriye.' Baid George mysteriously^ ' ' 'And t had a letter to-day from my aunt Paulina. She has not see,n me for four years, but I told her, when 1 wrote last, that my father Had returned and she is coming here to- morrow to see him. ' Congratulate him,' she says, ' on his splendid success, and we shall always be pleased to see him, and you with him, at Wimbledon.'' George laughed; - ' I am glad your aunt . is coming. It will be another agreeable surprise for- your father. Does he know?' ' No, he does not. I only got the letter this morning. He has always declared that ho does not desire to see any of his. relations.'' ' ' ' Shall you send him the letter' ? ' 'Why,' said Milly, 'my father has never even, told me where he is staying.' ' I can' tell yoi; that, if you, want to^ know. Stay, T will tell you to-morrow.' 'George, you1 are most mysterious. Tell me, is this a bad thing that has- ? ' 'No, not a bad thing. It is, such a good thing, MiHyi that bad it not hap pened '—his face darkened — '1. would have wished you lying dead and buried in the graveyard, and myself beside you. Oh, my dear,' again he clenched his fisfc, and Innlrari litft nflA wrtn ?Hlirftfr.ft fnr n.nnftifiV man's blood, 'it is such a good thing that we shall have to go in humble grati tude for it all the , rest of our lives.

Why,, what can it be?' ' . ,., . ' ' '?'.'' 'You shall learn it' to-morrow. ' But for to-day, Milly, can you trust me? ' 'Why, George dear,' she said, throw ing her arm round his neck — it was not true that her fingers were sticky. — 'George,'if I cannot trust you, whom am I to trust?' i . .'' 1 f ' Then, my darling, obey me for exactly ?four-and-twenty hours, arid I will obey you for air my life to come. Listen, my dear.' He whispered. ' , The effect of that whisper could not be, equalled even . by the gallery ih. St. ? Paul's Cathedral. Milly blushed, and then turned pale ; first her eyes looked startled and frightened ; next, they became soft ;, first Bhe' opened 'her mouth, and gasped i then,; her' lipa -trembled, and gradually settled' into a smile.

It waa a formal doou ment, the nature of whioh became evident - to her after the first few words of preamble. '?-??'. But I sail the day after to-morrow'.' ' Do you think, my dear, that I am going to let you go ? ' ' But what am' I to say ? Oh, George, what will my father say ?' ' He will approve— he will consent ;and yet you will not go to America with him.' ; ' Oh, I am in a dream !' : 'Do you consent, then ,my dear 1' She gave him both her hands. i 'Yes, George, only tell me what to do.' / 'You have onjy to come to my rooms 1 ? to-morrow morning at ten. Bring Ooper- i nica — poor little maid ! — with you, and I say nothing— not one word — to any one, j my dear. I cannot rest for thinking that you are not yet under my protection. Only one day more to wait. You oannat ' UD UtkHlOLL UU 111 UUD Uit^i ' Who is to carry me off, George ? ' ' There is only one man, my dear, who would try, but he is possessed of many - devils. Kiss me, and trust me, and say ; nothing.' ? ' ' ' .' ? j All that day thero was a' restraint. at Veritaa Villa, and an uneasy feeling that something 'or other would happen. . Copernica went on with her taisk of cata loguing, but without heart; the' Dis coverer continued to sit before the notes of his inaugural lecture, but somehow hi« enthusiasm was, tor the moment, quenched. He even fell into one of those fits of despondency which sometimes, but rarely, filled his mind with the blackness of - despair, because at those times a mocking voice asked him how it was tnat ne could never account tor a lunar eclipse. What should he say, when his i class asked him how, on his system, he could produce an eslipse of the moon ? - o . \- 'Father,' said Copernica at length, .'It is no use trying to work. George meant something — he never talks idly ; ?but let us put the things away and go for -a -walk.' She took her father to the banks of the river, where they wandered^ in a Bettled gloom. The ohild tried to raise her father's spirits by pointing out ^ |the many proofs of the earth's flatness: 'which could be gathered from the pros-, pect around them. In fact anyone who 'contemplates the Wanstead Marshes long enough cannot fail 'at arriving at the conclusion that the earth is as flat as a pancake. But the Discoverer remained. ! dejected. Was the cup to be dashed away from his lips at the moment of fruition ? ;Was he really to go on in' the old half-hearted way, making a Recruit now and then, courting contempt, being held up to ridicule ? And then — the recollec- . tion of that cheque lay at his heart. Yet0 if one could not truat Milly 'a father, in whom waa trust to be placed ? To-morrow — to-morrow he. was to' know. .-?''- One person remained to be pre--^ pared. This was the unfortunate* Johnny. George took him in the after noon to see his old haunts. They visited together the places they had known in. the . old days : the cottage where he1 brought home his young wife, and was happy before the siBter married into carriage; company, and the baneful passion of envy . . was aroused; the church where he once held part of a pew ; the tavern, where there had onoe been a club, to which he went once a week, when there was a sing- song. Johnny— whom it is im possible to call Mr. Montoro — shed tears in thinking of that weekly sing-song. - Then they took train — in the old days it was an omnibus — .to the city, and gazed at the exterior of the house where'! ;he had once been a clerk. When the ? man's heart was thus softened with the'; past.George began to prepare him for th!ef morrow. ! i ' , ? 'I kept 'you a prisoner all this time,'- he said, ' partly for your own sake. Tell me, what would haphen if you had met the , ? ' Colonel in America ? '. ?., - \ 'I should have shot him,' he replied. '; Oh yes ! I know I should have shot : him ; 1 felt exactly like shooting him.'. 'If you were to meet him here in Eng- ; : land, what would you do ?' -; 'There would be a fight,' he said courageously. ' Yes, I think — I'm most, sure there'd' be a fight, because I bound* to call him a thief, and the Colonel is ;no'i ' i man likely to'stand that ? you lay your,.. ' last dollar he isn't.' So. there must tie' a' fight, you see.' ?.'',- -,-..- v 'It wouldbe a poor sort of a fight,' Baid George. -'Well,- suppose you heard that the Colonel was calling himself by your name— — '?:','' :.' ' ?' ?' ; \ ? ; ,'r ? Whafd he do that for ? ' CiL . - 1 , ' Suppose he. went to ;Mr.' Ambler's house and said ho was Mr. Montoro, andi that Milly was his daughter, arid sold her houses, and told her io go over. to America with him. ?'? '-' ' ? 'With, him ! Go' with him 1' Th:j ' man became pale, and trembling in ail his limbs. 'The little maid.go with him!' 'That is exaotly what he; has done. ' ... Then Johnny began to' swear, i Mild'as' r he was, he had learnod to swear after the manner of the American rough and rowdy.; j, Ho Bwore at i the Colonel so terribly that,-; George thought he would have some kind of fit. He swore so long that George r thought he. would never '^nish.'ii ;: :. vi. I 'Come,' he Baid' at length, ''if you ? hadn't already sworn enough for ten1 men, '? ' .i.^^Mi:;!': y . :,V-;.-:: r,. .',..,., ;f;:/;J I would ask you to sayit all over agunfor.i me. Now, I warn yon, to-morrow'you willmeet.that identioal villain. What are you going to do ?'-, - ' Why,' Johnny replied slowly, 'no hasri't'got the little maid, has he ? 'Twould be very different if he had. And he hasn't got the money, for them houses, ? haa ; he ? So, mister, I think, as I'm; a peaceful: man, I shall kind o' let him' go.( The Colonel's a terrible man to fight. Its a great thing to be peaceful— kind o\ gets a man on in the world.' - ' Yes,' : said George, '? you are a beautiful example, are you not ? ' ? ? ' ' But,' said ' Johnny, ' about them notes. Yes, I am afraid there may;. be: a fight.' ? ?? ' ?. ?! , Poor Milly !. Her luck in fathers was . very bad. George wondered whioh of the twain, on the whole, ? was the' moBt tin desirable: Difficult to honour either of! them— and there is an old world prejudice that it is better to be a sturdy'rogue than a coward. If the Colonel was a rogue he was sturdy.; If Johnny waB indifferent honest, he ^as'a niost dreadful coward; '. CHAPTER VIII. WHO! GrVETH AWAY ' THIS , /.WOMAN ? . ; ': .: ??'.- '\1 knew,' said Oopernioa when Milly asked her to put on her hat and go for a walk with her; ',I knew that ' something. . would happen to-day, and I knew it would be something to do with you, beoauss George was in it. . And it will be some thing to do with Mr. Montorb, because papa is in it. Yes, Milly dear, I will be readyin a minute. As for poor papa, he has not slept a wink all night; but walked .about groaning, and this, morning he ia sitting all-oE a heap-like among the boxes. And, oh, good . gracious, Milly ! you've' got on your white frock arid white gloves. 'What' in the world ? ' , ,: :.'Oome,' said Mi)ly,smiling ; 'you shall know in half an honr as much as I know-'my'sblf . ' Why, dear, as to what it all means, I know no more than you. But something has happened — something w&ch; is to make UB grateful all our days, George, says, and to-day we shall learn wiiat it is.' ? ?????:?.' ????'?.-? .'??'?But,1- why white flock' and white gloves?' Copernica persists. 'It is like a/.wedding.' ?? .- ., -. ^ ' 'Yes, dear,' Milly blushed, .;! it is terribly like a wedding, is it not?' First, they went to George's lodgings. This was in itself a remarkable thing, ' because George should have been at his business- Blithe was not, he, was stand ing, at/the garden -gate waiting for them. With him were two . gentlemen— ;one of: them Oopernioa's cousin, Mr. Richard ; the other, a strange man— not a gentle man, exactly, to judge by hio look, which! was! downcast and shy, as if he was droBsed in, a suit of clothes 'too good for him ; and really, when Oopernica, who 1 was sharp of observation, brought her eyes t6 bear upon that stranger's dress, she'; became, conscious that be was dressed; in George's clothes, which made her feel as.' if.vshe; was in a dream. She was certain of it— quite certain of it — she knew the pattern and recognised the cut. Who. was thiB strange, man, who must needs borrow a suit of George's clothes? Had he turned up with nothing to . wean? - And when he lifted his head' and Rooked round him— in a furtive, ashamed kind of way-4he child's brain became suddenly troubled, because he' re- minded her of somebody— she knew not, rtf for; the moment, who it could be. This mprethan ever made her feel like being in'.'a dream. . ? . ' _ . ?'This, uncanny ghost-like-feeling may be arrived at any day by walking about the ?streets 'of London at twilight, when yon just- catch a glimpse— no more — of the faces as they pass, and find your mind presently filled with old fancies and vague,, sorrowful suggestions. You have seen — youjremembor when they have' passed ' you— faces whioh reminded you of dead friends.' The' procession of London faces is 'endless ; as onegrows older the streets become more and more filled with the faces of the dead ; so that one thinks sometimes that this marching in procession beside the living may be one form of pur ' gatory-j'and one trembles' to think that if we were' to' grow] very old indeed, the pro cession-effaces in- acrowfled street would be wholly composed of dead men. To this girli' the face of the strange man suggested likheas to some one, a feeling of having seen it before somewhere ;. and it made ? her uncomfortable. George did not in-' trodiice him to them ; took no. notice of him; and merely nodded'to him when ho said' that it was time to be moving. ; , ?'They formed a little procession. George, arid J Milly went first ; Mr. Richard. and' Oopernica came next ; and the stranger followed behind, sayiug nothing, but hanging Ms- head with every ; appearance of great dejeotidn. , '..'??

That was one of the' things. But why? And; where, was.her father,? ?' ,A;nd, George looking as serious as if he was; going; to a funeral. At weddings people. ought to lauglfand be happy, she thought, being as yet young and ignorant,' arid riot thinking that from weddings spring most of the ills' which do afflict humanity ; such as a lean; purse, a nagging tongue, household troubles, sick ohildron, bad sons, disap-: pointing .daughters, distraction' of peace, abolition of comfort, arid iriany others. It is true that thereis the chance of groat blessings ; Buch as-t;— ; ;But they are knownto everybody, arid at the outset we all expect 'them, and moan /to have them,' and shape our course accordingly. _ ..But what,' Oopernioa wondered; what in the iworld did this mysterious person;moan by 'saying, 'Matilda in pink?' Who was Matilda? ?'? ? i . ,'; : ': ; , ' ; Then they went into ? the church.

And a curate 'was in.' the vestry putting on his ; robes ;of' Office. . ,;?. .-..., ; i They walked up the; aisle and stood ibeforeth'e altar, and presently the clergy-. Jman canoe out. of the vestry, and( toot his 'place,' book in hand, arid began the service. The words eohoed mockingly in the great ;empty church. Oopernica would have cried ?had not at the'very;beginning the Granger !dressed in Geprge'sj clothes, begun to isnuffle and to shed tears, which made;her: 'ashamed of being in His :companyr; -. ; Why; 'should he cry?- What business had he: iwiththe wedding at1 all? She would have liked'to whisper her 'opinion of' this con-, jduct to he'r'cousin Dick- Ambler, but he looked as serious as George, and bore jhimself aB if weeping,. strangers in other ^people's clothes belonged 'to every wed-' jding, like the dreadful old skeleton which iwas always present atlthe feast,. though'it ?was good mariners to take no manner of ^notice of it. '.,..' ? . : ?.. ! Another wonderful;' things -, When the. '.clergyman asked, ' M^ho giveth away this iwoman ?' the stranger it was -who officj lously stepped fornrard' and performed this 'duty which Oousin Dick should have donp, and he did it, too, With a most indecent 'choke and gulp, murmuring irreverently, !' You- bet I do,' which is not in the Prayer-book. . And then to. the end of the service he never took his eyes from the bride, who regarded him not at all, and |seemed,not to know that he was present, ?being wholly1 occupied with the ovef ;;whelmnirig ,faot th^t she was being iswif tly coriverted into a wife. . She (had her heart's ' desire — not quite :in the way- she had expected, . whioh jwas a way of- festivity and good wishes, :but she had her desire. Therefore she. lough to to have ' been j happy. , But, oh, what would her; father say? ' ', And what, about that promise to'go with him for two lyears ? Yet George assured her that her father would actually iconaent. Why, how could(that bei 1 But she was married, the ?ring was on her finger, and the words 'were said ; yet she was afraid — a girl on !such an occaoion wants to have her spirits ikept up by the gathering of her friends ; no one likes to be married in an abso jlutely empty churoh1 ; it was like some ;uncared-for creature to be married with no one to support her except Oopernica, and even her own father riot present. 1 When they went; to the vest^ to sign the strange man. caine with them, and 'signed his name after the bride, but she did not read his signature. ; Then the ceremony was complete, and ;Copernica' fell into the bride's arms and kissed and hugged her. ' ' / : ' Oh, Milly, Milly, [' she said, :' what does it mean ?. Are. you to stay while .we go away without you ? And what will your father- say, and what will he do ? Will he take you away with him just the same ?' ! j . ' What should he do ?' interposed the stranger huskily. ;' It isn't for the likes bf him to carry sweet maids , away to America. Don't you take on, triiss. He never, meant it. Not for one miaute did he think of- doing such a thing.' ! 'Qomej.- Milly dear,' said George . 'you have got-to listen to a little story' before you go home— I mean, before you go back to your old home. Your homo is with me now, thank heaven ! You will come too, Oopernica. It is a strange atoryi not very terrible, but it might have been.' , . So they all went back again. There was no wedding breakfast prepared, no champagne or drinking of healths, or wishing of joy, or throwing of rice; or ? looking up' of old- shoes-^riot at all. They went' ? silently into George's room, and stood looking at each other, and especially at the stranger, whose face betokened the most, painful shame and confusion.. ; i ' Now,'- Mr.: Richard said to him; 'you haye got something.' to tell us : arid sprae-; thing to oonfess. Try' to tell your 'story straight! through if: you can. ..You. had better begin at once. Milly, 'sit down' and listen. T 'We will all sjt^own.' ;? ; ' :.' .'?''.

But by. this time she quite under stood that?: spmething-.inpre unexpected even than her own wedding was to happen; and now she connected this walk ing mystery in George's tweeds with the un expected, than which, as we know, nothing is more certain; : , li When I went away,' this mysterious person began slowly, and as if feeling for his facts, ' I thought, being a fool and in experienced! that if you wanted money all you had to do was to go to America, where you would be sure to find it. Every, ,body, I thought, got rioh in. the States. It ? . waB only the trouble of , going ithere and pickin' up the dollars: Lord! !what a fool I was ! Don't none of you believe it. America's the biggeat fraud out. If anybody gets rich it's the Americans |themselveB. You've got to work there harder than at home. If there's any easy places they're, grabbed by the natives. Look at me: I gave up three pound a week to go out and make a, fortune. Did I ever get that three pourid'a iweek again 1 Did I ever get another easy place ? Don't you think it.' ' . , , . ' ' Isn't this,' asked Mr. Riohard un feelingly, ' rather a roundabout way of beginning?' ,;. ; ? Oopernica looked from Milly to the speaker, and back again. Strange, tie was like Milly ! ? _ ; 'Thank ypu, sir,' the' man replied humbly. ' I m comin' round to what J want to say. Lemme go my own way, if you please. Though if your've a better way, tell me that way, and-'I will go that ;way.' . : ? . i : ,' You Bhall £[o any way you please, said George, ' if only you get to the end [somehow.' ? - '? . . J j '' Thank you, sir,'he'replwd, ' you are the only man as has Baid a kind word to me for twenty years, - and I'm bound to please that man if I; can' — he kept look ing at Milly furtively— 'especially since' ihe's husband of the little maid.' Milly Started. 'Very well, then. Hard berthB I got, not easy at all. : Sometimes it iwbuldbe porter's work at a store.' Did I expect when I gave u p a. most gentle manly desk to go rolling casks of treacle 1 iDid I expfict to load the steamboats with wood? Did I go out there to do odd chores around, a day's work here, and another there, wiiha spade arid a hoe, or a crowbar and a hammer ? I've been a navvy on a railway ; I've dug graves for a cemetery ; I've cut wood arid stacked it. All the hard jobs 1 had to do, while the natives spread themselves out around.the stoves and put. up their feet. That's the way they reward a man who . gives up three pound a week to go out to them ; that's the kind of Fortune they let him make ; that's the kind of friend America ia ? a dollar and a hef a day and -leave it if you don't like it ; there's plenty of tramps on the road will take it ; that's what 1 gave up my berth for'; 'that's what, Matilda' — Milly started— 'my wife, Matilda,' sent me out' for -^ said I was.bb'und to bo ambitious; Told me I ought to soar.'

' I know;, who he; is,' said; Copernica, ; nodding her head.' - 'I am sure I know.' He gave her away. -Oh, I see now !' ' i 'Well,' Cfie ^continued,' ^' at first I thought- this was only.the.beginning— kind of a rough,, hearty, free. and easy welcome to new corners j presently^ I should get the hang of things,' and then I should begin to make that Fortune,' By this .time I. was. as ambitious.as 'Matilda could ha' wished, because I wanted. badly to get baok that three pound a week with store clothes and a Btove-pipe hat. Then, I concluded she'd ' be the least mite .anxious about me, and sol wrote her a lotter.
