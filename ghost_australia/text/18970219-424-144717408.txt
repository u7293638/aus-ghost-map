A MODERN PYTHIAS, i A gn-op of terinfa players were lounging nnda* the iocott teaea 4a the campns of * oolite. Tb^y bad jnrt Sniahed tue fifteenth 44 last game of ; tbe srMQm^fpr although November waa ttefr, the weather remained like summer. It wai ijfctta Tod McNott who found bis breath first, and broke tbe rilenco— ** Have yba got aoqmuntnd with the new soph yet— Fred Heraen ? Seems to be a genial sort.' 'Genial!' eoboed his neareet neighbour, Clifford Doope* ht a tone of infinite diagatt *? Wbet old- faahioned words yoo nae, Mac!

He gets acquainted easily, doesn't seam a bit home*iek or forlorn, aa the new fellow* taostiy are, sod takea his exsmraaUan like so much fnn.' *' You don't say ! n ejaculated Lex Small, the champion athlete of the school, who spent so much time and energy ou gymuaatifr that little wa* left for mathematics ' bo,' reasserted McNott. ' tinea* III get introduced. Be might help me out in trig,** aaid Let, thoughtfully. The boys all laagbed at characteristic remark, and fairlv shouted wben Shirley Deaoe, tbe ' pet lamb of tbe fluck,' aa be was railed, irtioved bis colours by hoping ** UiaL the girls would not go crazy over bin.** ?f Tbey will, 1 know,' spoke up Clifford, ** For I saw Flo Barnard talking with him in the library, and tbf girls all foflow ber lead.*1 There was a cborfer of groans at this, for thftae four young men were the admiration of tbe girl students, which auorct waa long since diMMvered, *n-J often discussed at their private onteliugs. '* In union there t* strength— mf^mly axiom, grntiemat^' prvclauned Lex. 44 A fellow has 00 beau,**** coming into this ooDepe two months liti.1, taking tbe front aeat a our rlass-rooms sn-- in our best girls' hearts. I propose we unite in downing this new and tbjrctionable jieraon, every time, everywhere, and ia every possible way !J ?'Agreed!' they shouted, McNott adding, 1 *' Let's begin right off '.

(3iff. prepare to outshine bim iu recitation to* niorrsw, aod Shirley look after tbe soundness of the girts' hearts.' Po, lsit£ biagly, they shouldered their rackets and aauotered into the house. '* Thus endeth tbe fifteenth last gam* !H exclaimeH Lex. ''One would think we were practising for tbe stage, with our numerous fanw^ll engagements. Bnprose, for a change, we turn to our work -s investigating committee, and he«r tb-- report of member*, Mac, first.' liaising himself- upon one elbow McNott be^an— ' 1 got acquainted with the new man and found h* was from New York. He didn't say whether it was the State or City ; in fact, be has the knsck of making a body talk, to 1 came away feeli* g tiiat he knew more about me tbau 1 did of him, «n-1 — that'* alf.' ' He didn't have a very good lesson this morning,' pot tu Shirley, '* aod he see ooed green to me — staring at every one who got op to reciu».' ♦4 Oh, new oat« all do !' objected McNutt. 'One thing 1 know,** asserted Lex, calmly proceeding amid the shouts of 41 Hear, bear f' '* Flo ha* introduced hint to half of the girls already, and I intend giving ber my opinion of such forward, unladylike cor^uct.*1 'He hasn't shown preference for any. so far,' said McNutt, thoughtfully scraping tbe seeds from the grasses around him, M bnt it bents me what a taucy be has for tbat stupid Jack Stokes. This i« Stokes' second term, you know, and be bsso't half a doxen trends tu uis name ; yet be and Hsnten were walking in tbe campus this morning like old cronies. n '* Ob,' yawned Clifford, 44 we are gossiping as they do at a ladies' tea party. Let's have another game by way of practice.' While these conversations were beiqg held on the lawn, the much-discussed student, Fred Hsrsen, was fast being initiated into tbe life of the college. All that the quartette of envious fellows had said of him was true, which is more than can be asserted of most gossip. Never had tbe college walla held a student ao popular io so short a apace of time. Tbe giris raved over his manliness aod good looks, » hile his ability and joviality woo tbe more reluctant reaped aod good will of tbe boys. All were amazed, however, that hs ahould form so ardent a friendship with Jack Stokes, a student far from popular among tbem. Hy-and bye tbey were rooming together, aod their den bt-came.headquarters for all tbe fun goiog. Here it was tbat the the boys congregated to plan tbt-ir first nleigb«ride ; chose aides tor a gulf match; elected their ghost to attend the girit.' lea party ; beld impromptu debates, and wrote essays for one another. liven Stokes beeame ' illumined with a rr flecU.*d popularity,' as Lex grumpily called it, and was invited everywhere bis comrade was. By timea be waa tbe Life of the company ; bot it was a htful gleam, and he invariably relapsed into a morbid gloom. Weeks passed making little change in tbe social affairs at tbe College ; one night* however, a strange procension wound its way through the grounds, and ooly the crunching of iee novated anoer broke the stillness. The bell boy shrieked with . terror when he opened the door to reoeire a group of men bearing two uuoocscious bodies. Tbuy bad gone out, a lively crew, in a loor-borae aJeigb ; but through fright or reckless .driving tbe horses Lad carried tbem over an embank ment, with this awful reanlt. Many wave oat and bruised, while Clifford Doeue had a leg broken, and Jiek jgtokee was internally injured. Soon there waa burryiug to-and-fro, and the excitement was for .days iutonaa. CUtford'a condition wa* paipfal, but bis reooverfrwas only a question of time ; Jack's life, however, .swung in tbe balance for many days; During that time Fred scarcely left his aide, declaring that he coud do aa well ss any trained nnrse,and that- he would give up bis place in daaa rather than deeert bis friend.
