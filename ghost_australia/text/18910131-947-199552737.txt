','? | ; ?:.-.. .WHAT, IS. ITi ?,'..? m ;?.,;:-;::.-: ?THE INFLUENCE THAT SOMETIMES ? .GUIDES USi AGAINST OUE WIOL. 'No, I. do :riot. believe, in ghosts,' said an old i lady of : great experience, 'butl- do believe in the ministration of spirits.' This is not the age. nor the .country in .which the supernatural flourishes.- Interest centres about the practical. '?? Haunted houses are rented without great difficulty, if the landlcrd is willing to knock off a portion of 'the rent. -There are many, however, who will admit the exertion at times of some peculiar influence swaying our actions. We are led to do things we should not do of our own volition— the : wisdom of which. we do not appreciate until afterwards ; then we wonder how we came to do them. We are forced to learn : that worldly wisdom is not always thit which guides into the wisest courses. In this practical age results are what people are looking after. They believe in what they see ; the ' evidence of things ? not seen' is to be weighed in the future. When a man is sick he wants to get well ; he dares little what medical method is em ployed if it cures. But if it does not cure ? he soon begins to doubt the skill of the physician, and enquire into his: methods of medication.. A happy thingjit is sometimes ? if some influence induce3 investigation be- : ' fore it i3 too late. .--: Mr E.t W.
