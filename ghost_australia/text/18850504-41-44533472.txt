SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB AUTUMN MEETING. BvTeleeraTjh.l I From our own .Reporter. 1 Melbourne. Mav 3. The S.A.J.C. bad nothing to complain of in the matter of weather on Saturday, but the attendance At Flemington was not equal to the general expectations. When the pro ceedings began there were very lew spec tators, but the appearance of the Stand improved later on, and Mr. Barnard seemed satisfied with the receipts at the gates. His Excellency the Governor and suite were present, and there were a good many leading sportsmen from New, South Wales in the paddock, bat Adelaide was rather thinly represented,. consider- ing that it was a South Australian meet ing. The card only contained five races, but there were good fields in the handicaps, and some of the finishes were very exciting. Late scratchings reduced the field in the Hurdle Race to five, and four of these were supported at short prices. The race was run at a slow pace for a mile, and then Echo, Old Soul, and. Sir Patrick raced together to the turn, where Echo was cannoned against, and the lad on Old Soul taking matters rather easy up the straight, Sir Patrick got away from him and just landed the race by a long neck. Silver King was established favourite for the Leger when the betting opened, but when stripped he looked tucked-up, and as The Broker was cool and hard he became nearly as good a favourite as Silver King before the fall of the flag. Sandal was also supported, and at one time her backers were io. ecstasies, as she led the two colts a merry race to the home turn. Here she collapsed altogether however, and is Silver King had taken a good deal on him self in chasing Sandal, he was not able to resist the* challenge of The Broker, who got bis head in ftont at the, distance, and won a pretty race by a short neck. The winner waa ridden with great judgment by Sanders. ' After lunch a field of twenty weighed out for the Goodwood Handicap. Most of the com petitors looked very fit when saddled up, and with Topaz out of the way the race would have been regarded as wonderfully open. . There was not much change in the betting, save that St. Lawrence hardened and further investments in favour of Lantern shortened bis price. They were not kept long at the post, and the start would have been a good one but for Topaz jumping round the wrong way as the flag fell. This ruined his chance completely, bat the accident probably made no difference as far as the actual result of the race was concerned, because Lantern strode away from his opponents after going a furlong and spreadeagled them just as he did the lot opposed to him at Oakbank on Easter Mon day. Lord Wilton struggled into second place again, and of the other favourites Iron master and St. 'Lawrence performed fairly well, bnt nothing had a chance with the winner. Lantern was not a good horse for the ring, though the owners did not win a large stake, owing to his having a bad passage over from Adelaide. That very smart filly Juanna made an example of Remus and The Teacher in the Sires' Produce Stakes, but South Australians were npt equal to follow ing up their successes in the Victorian Handicap, for which eighteen faced the starter. Meander and. Meerschaum were favourites, and the former should have won, but be- stumbled, and the accident enabled Pyrette to wind up a good day's sport with a clever win for the Messrs. Miller. The ring must have had a good day, though a few Adelaide men landed fair stakes over Lantern. The following is a description of the run ning:— FIRST nURDTJE RACE. A handicap swetpstakes of 5 so vs. each for starters, with 150 soys, added. About two miles. Mr. A Ferguson's bl.g. Sir Patrick, by Croagh. Patrick, 6 yrs., 11 st. 121b. (Fergusson).. .. 1 Mr. M. P.

Gasalier, 10 to 1 agrt. Yellow Hammer. Tbe first horse to move was Yellow Hammer, and he led Old Soul and Echo over the first hurdle, when Old Soul took up the running from Echo and Gasalier in the order named. At the distance Old Soul was just clear of Echo and Gasaller, and the three jumped the hurdles in front of the Stand almost together, with Sir Patrick and Yellow Hammer lying about six lengths behind. Bounding the river turn Old Soul and Echo drew away three lengths from Gasalier and Sir Patrick, but at the aSbabirs the ?fottr were closd toeetber, Old Svfll still being the mostprominent. T&e; favourite kept his advantage over Echo to tbe hurdle near the turn, when the Ballarat horso was cannoned against, and he dropped back to Gasalier, while Sir Patrick took second place. Entering the straight Sir Patrick was in front, and after a slashing race home he won by half a length from Old Soul, with Echo half a length behind the second horse. Gasalier was a good fourth, and Yellow Hammer a bad last. Time, i min. 2i sec. ST. LEGER STAKES. A sweepstakes of 20 sovs. each, 5 ft., with 150 added. For three-year-olds.

The Broker, i to i agst. Sandal. ???*,-?.. . The three left the post in a very leisurely manner, but after cantering to the distance' Sandal, went to the front and le 1 The Broker six lengths past the Stand, with Silver King lying last. At (the river turn Sandal had increased his lead to eight lengths, bnt racing along the back stretch The Broker and : Silver King abreast, began to* draw on the leader, and at the Dridge Sandal was only two lengths clear of Silver King, while The Broker had dropped back last, and this order was preserved to the turn, where Sandal sudddenly collapsed, and Silver King entered the straight in front. He was immediately joined by The Broker, however, and tbe latter quickly beaded him, but Silver King came again under punishment, and after a rattling finish be ' was ; only beaten by half a neck. Sandal was a . dozen lengths off.

The first to jump off, were 'St. John and Pailleroo, with Lord Wiltoo, Umberto, and Lantern next .These five were at the head of. affairs for the first furlong, the field being in good order, with the exception of Topaz, who was 150 yards behind everything. After going a furlong Lantern went up to the leaders, and after lying beside St. John to the abattoirs he strode to the front, followed by Umberto, Lord ? Wilton, Duenna, and Pailleroo, the rest beingwell packed, , with the exception of Topaz whipping in. Passing the sheds Lantern held a commanding lead from Pailleroo, Umbertb,'ahd Lord Wfltott, who were together, and as they raced along the bend th; vlg river horse was holding- his own comfortably from TJncas, Pailleroo, Lord Wilton, and Ironmaster, while the colours of St Lawrence and -The Ghost showed prominently at the head of the main body of tbe field, and .Topaz also made a faint run. Lantern continued, to stride along in front as they rounded the' turn, 'and here Pail lerbo. Lord Wilton, Ironmaster, St. Lawrence, and The Ghost were at the head of the second lot. But though Lord Wilton and The Ghost drew out from thereat of the field in. the', straight, neither could reach Lantern, who won with ridiculous ease by three lengths, lord Wilton beat. The Ghost by a neck for second place, and then csi&e; Ironmaster close up fourth, with St. Lawrence, Pailleroo, Middlemarcb, Uncas, and Duenna in the order named, the last to pass the post being Kingship.

They were at once dispatched to a splendid start, but Pyrette waa very quick on her legs, and at once took a clear lead from Miss Merlin, Surprise, and Honora, with Meander, Derision, and Agnes well up. Ihey crossed the tan in much the same order, bnt Meander lost ground through stumbling, and entering the course proper Pyrette was still in command from Honora and Miss Merlin, with Meander coming fast on the inside. From the dis tance'.to home Meander made up his ground in fine style, but Pyrette was iust equal to stalling off his challenger, a slashing finish between the pair ending in favour of the mare by a neck. Honora was a length from the second horse, with Miss Merlin a good fourth, the main body being headed by Agnes and Stafford. Time, 49J sec.
