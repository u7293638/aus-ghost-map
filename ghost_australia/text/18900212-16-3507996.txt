O'shea seeks a du orce against his wife, and makes Mr Parnell a co íespon dent This is done undor circumstances that are suspicious, and that ha-ve been publicly discussed The allegation of the Pamelhtes is that as there is difference m the domestic position since 18S6, tho case has been instituted at this particular time tn order to injure Parnell pohti callv, m older especially to lessen the damages which might be cast against the Tintes in the libel case that is pending The Times m large type announced the entenngof the writ, butasno intimation was given to Mrs O'Shea and Mi Parnell, tho lady's solicitor took the unusual step of demanding service, and publishing the letter at once in the Pi ess The Parnelhte3 m bust that this action is brought snuplj to bo hung ni fcirorcm over

brought before Both OShea and Parnell have been interviewed, and the lotteis of the solicitors on both sides have been published, along with all the gossip that could be collected The main fact that Parnell and Mis, 0 Shea have been living in the same house, has foi n long while boen an open seciet and it has been stated m print all over thocountiy duimg this piesont week A little zest is given to this scandal by a visit v Inch Mi Parnell has locontly paid to Mi Gladstone at Hawarden, tho malicious urging that if ho knows himself to be guiltj ho ought nevei to have pi of aned the saeied

the pinch of the Graphic experiment will be m doing everjthiug lapidlj, the e-vpomnoiit that is to bo attempted on so lal go a scale may very well causo some anxiety Then Mi Stead has ceased to ho

amount of mjstctj is kept upiespectmg this new candidate foi tho favour of the leading pubho, we may wait until the publication is out Mi Stead is a veiy clever man, but he pioved a bad fuend to tho Pall Mall, whose piopnotoi has loy ally stuck to linn through j eat s of ovil îepoit, but who must feel a measure of relief now that tho connection is sevciod The pietenca of having established a now journalism we maj put aside with tho lomail that the apostleslnp of the mutation of Ameiican methods, which are called new journalism, is now loudly claimed by the Star and the J lennia .Yen», the two halfpenny evening papéis of tho largest circulation in London Ibis is all brag and lrnpudenao 13ut Mi Stead did put hfo into the paper Nothing evei csenped it I ho moment anything of interest, or apparent mtorest, arose, the Pall Mall leaped upon it with all its olaws out Sometimes it carne a ctopper on the other side, sometimes it caught a Tai tar, sometimes the mauler was sadl j mauled, but often tho claws went into the flesh, savagely and deep and the quairy was brought down But looseness often accompanied smartness, and the nus tikes of the Pall Vail aro proverbial Take tho day bofoie yestcrdoy togo no furthct, as an example That temblé fire down at Torest Gate with twentj sixbojs suffocated, must be mado a sensation of Out therefore caine the bills, and the papei itself with " Total destruc tion of the Torest Gate Schools" in big type headlines Only two looms of one of the smallest annexes were burnt, and they not badly Mr Stead's advocacy was often clever and earnest, but lacking judgment He got wild His latest fad was to go to Rome and teach the Pope how to iule his gi eat histoncal Church The letters in thel'allMall fell flat as ditchvvater Yet the space of the piper is being wasted to this moment m attempts to make the question a sensation The bitterness of the Pall Mall has been as like malice, occasionallj, ns one pea is like anothet Look at the papers of the present week, the Parnell and O'Shea dtvoice case has been made the text every day of lenevving the old attacks upon Sir Charles Dilke, and this has been done with a relish that is not manlj The paper has never lost an opportumtj of sneering at the Daily Nexei ever since the imprisonment of Mr Stead, when the most cutting condemnation of tho prisoner was m the Daily Kew» leader columns With all his brilliant parts and bubbling enthusiasm (especially when he got in the neighbourhood of the seventh command ment), Mr Stead has not been a judicious editor As a contributor of leaders he will be in his right place, and the Pall Mall in that department will still have the benefit of his sen ices Browning was buried m Westminster Abbey on Tuesday, and the poet bad a splendid funeral The homage to him has been universal, and he worthily hes in a corner sacred to the memory of great and good men. And yesterday Charles Mackay was laid in the frozen ground in Kensal Green Cemetery, amidst a great gathering of clans-the literal Clan Mackay, represented by a contingent from Scotland, and the clans artistic, journalistic, and literary, from the metropolis I remember once m the Queensland bush a boundary rider who had left the old country just about the time when Mackay's songs were at the height of their popularity \ears had passed and the character of our ballads had changed altogether, but the fasmon to him still was " Cheer boy s, Cheer," and " There's a good time coming," and a very good fashion too. Cow-en, and Tosh, and Marztal are all very well, but boys don't whistle them in the streets, and you could not set an audience in outcry o£ chorus by starting one of their ¿hawing room pieces Bj his songs Mack«,} will be be=t remembered Ile wrote a quantitv of miscellaneous hteratuie, his best book perhaps, being his "History of Popular Delusions " At one lime he marked wojl for a foremost placo in journalism, but his special conespontlence foi the Times during the American war was on the wrong side for tho admirers who had learned to look upon him as a ballad wiiter for the people ~\Yo had lost sight of him m Lon don, vvheio he has never been a personal presence to the young men of the clubs, wheio he was once well known, for moie than ten years Di Lightfoot, the learned Bishop of Dutham, is another eminent man cut down by the lleaper m tho last days of the old year Ho was a shoit, stout, bullet hended, but most benevolent looking man, who never seemed at home in the House of Lords, m the pulpit, or on the platform, for ho was not an clpquout speaker, and was well awaio of it The study vv as his place, and the amount of work of tho highest ordei which ho did theie was simplj piodigioii". Fiom Bishops to pitzefighters is hut a step, and the so called Australian champion has been a bit of a hero of late, becauso he was tho only man who came out with anything like ci edit in the blackguaidly affair at Bulges I cannot lemember a pnze fight that has given so much satisfaction to the public as the scandalous abuse of pnze lighting last week m Belgium, m which tho contendmg patties were Smith, the Englishman, and Slav in, tho Queenslander Had the latter day levival of boxing matclic3 been anything hut a feocloi of tho took making fiatcimty it niijht have ha I a chanco It vvas not It proel ni nod itself any number of times dunng the last two jeais as a btbo imposition Ilespectablo it neve! vvns, but there was always fair pla) Whatevoi lovvdios outside tho ung might do, in the ung fan fighting was tho nile It is so no longei, and the public, m face of the dnstardlv mulambin of the Smith lot at Biuges, aie 1 think finally sick of the whole thing Tho most cunóos thing was that what happened was categoucally foretold befoiehand The rascal who lined the Birmingham loughs and took them ovei to pi event Slav m winning the fight was not only known, but Ins intentions wcie discussed lho sporting papéis wanted Slav m s fneilds oí what would bo done It is a thousand pities that piccnutions vvoro not taken so that, if it carne to tho point, theie was not a fice fight all lound ¿lavin's bo havioui was very good Ho was, of com so, tho best mau twice ovtoi, and knocked tho othei man all to pieces with his knuckles, as at tho public spamng matches ho had knocked all competitors with tho gloves But he gallantlj, knowing tho linndewous gang that wero icady foi linn, went mto Smith a coinei lound aftoi lound, and pounded away at tho skulking English impostoi, though blows mined upon him, and ho was lucked and knuclvledusted by the covvnidly held No wondei that atDovei and again m Tlcot stieet when ho made hw appeaianco nfteivvaids, ho received an ovation, 01 that the Stock Exchange mon, who nie not all membeis of tho Peaco Society 01 chapel goeiq heated him like a Shah and whipped up n puiso of three figures foi him In the ung the îeteice lost his head oompletelj Bj tho modem Hiles Smith twice foifeited the fight, and to declaio it "a diaw ' was just about adding insult to injurj rho Pelican Club, therefoie, as well ns Exeter Hall, and tho oidi naij pnblio who pick up a living between those* exti enies, aie unanimous in their disgust, and at the pantomimes nnv lofeience to this dis giaceful exhibition is a signal foi excciations foi the Englishman, and loud cheeib foi the Austinhan
