CAPITAL AND LABOUR. Trt THt »nrrrrt» Sir— I fail to understand the meaning of 'J. B. Sheridan' when he eays in & letter published in your issue of 2nd inst. 'that cnnital is an acrcrreeate of values, and that values are gnosts. i nave only got tar enougn myself to understand that, what is called capital weans the money and osU.i,es possessed by certain individuals,' who are continually trying to add more thereto, and in eo doing they make as much use of the labourer* as' possible, and got as much out of him or her, more than their just share, that they are really enabled to add to their etock of money and possessions ; and as there ia only a certain amount of money current the more the capitalist collects from labour the less is left for the labourez, and, consequently, the poor »re ever increasing in numbers in pro portion to the extra money collected by the capitalist. Sometimes in his speculative plans the capitalist does draw a blank, as in the case quoted by J. B. Sheridan, where the specula tors who paid the prospectors did lose pare of their capital, or part of their ghosts, according to J. B. Sberidaa. I ata, Sir, &c;, GEORGE HADLOW. Port Augusta.
