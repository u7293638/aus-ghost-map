The other day a Governmont officer was in a fir^t-class Cai-riage at Port. Adelaide- With was a female, who (as described to us) may have been a queen or a barmaid. A decentlookin^man and his wife entered the carriage, whe^anpon the G. O. rather insolently informed them-that that was a first-class carriage. The response was richly deserved. Said the man. "Thffrlk .you ! I should scarcely have thought so fromthe company I find here!" There was not the ghost"of a smile on that G. O.'s couritenance the remainder of. the journey. E ought to have an encyclopedia of railway incidents a sort of railwayania! The other day a recent arrival travelling per train from Adelaide to the Semaphore t asked by the collector for his ticket He liad given up at Alberton the only one he had, and said so "But," said the coUector, « You^s was a P o r ticket. I want one for the Semaphore." The stranger, misapprehending him, grew hotly indignant, and stubbornly refused to have anything to say to the collector. Finally that official, reinforced by the guard, made a solemn demand • for the fare from the Port to the Semaphore, which the stranger paid under very angry protest. It afterwards transpired that the poor victim thought the collector had insulted him by Saying that the ticket given up iat Alberton was a pawn-ticket, and he felt disgraced before a" carriageful of passengers. The echo of the roars of laughter may still hang about tlie corners of that carriage. HERE is one advantage in our Government T borrowing large sums of money and depositing some in the local Banks, 'and that is in the fact that it supplements the power of the directors* to assist their customers. Whether this is a sound practice or not we do not pretend to say. There may be many who will off-hand tell us that it is an excellent and justifiable policy; others may tell us that it is not wise nor well that the private financing companies of the solony (such as the banks for the most part are) h hould be dependent in any way on .the help ihey may get from such a source. We will not pretend to decide between the two; but of this ve are quite certain—that the withdrawal of the Government deposits and the dependence of he Government temporarily on the resources hich the banks have at. command, have worked ith injurious effect upon the trading community. If it were not for this we should not hear df a bank director in desperation declaring that he did not know where on. earth they (meaning his board of directors) were going to get money tp carry on certain accounts with.

This is not to be. accepted without some qualification; but of this we may rest assured, that an average member f; Parliament makes a most angular and difficult member of any -deliberative assembly. t|is related to us that durinjg one day's session, f] "the Wesleyan Conference this week one eptleman known to Parliamentary fame inlicted no fewer than twenty-eight speeches good, bad, and indifferent, but mostly long—= pon that long-suffering assembly. HE Hon. the Treasurer has been delighting T the Eedhill people with his enlightened oratory on the subject of education, and particularly the intelligence developed by the growth of Institutes (one of which he was opening) in the Northern Areas. Now, judging from the uses to which many of these are applied, and the entire absence of all educational, appliances save a few newspapers and cheap novels, we confess that a great deal of credit is due to Mr. Mann's imaginative faculty; Possibly there is a good deal done through newspapers for the intellectual advancement of the people •more than the newspapers may get credit for; but we doubt the efficacy of yellow-backed novels for the mental regeneration of hwoanity. I T is, however, noteworthy that Mr. Mann was attended on this occation by his accomplished friend and fidus Achates, Mr. Ward, with his inevitable—inevitable on all Institute occasions — lecture on Shakespeare. That these two great and good'men should have reconciled themselves, healed old sores, forgotten old denunciations, and united in an old love, speaks volumes for the easy temper of the one, and the strong aspirations of the other. Mr. Ward has "friz to the Treasurer with the most transparent purpose; but—we think he has miscalculated the chances ! ^ r |HE correspondent who assures us that the ___ coolest place in Port Adelaide on Wednesday was the stoke-hole of one of the steamships is attempting to mislead us. He forgets that we know Mr. Sawtell, and can refer to his thermometers. But this we will cheerfully admit: that it was generally felt to be impossible to maintain a frigid politeness even among the Port lumpers, and that's saying a great deal!
