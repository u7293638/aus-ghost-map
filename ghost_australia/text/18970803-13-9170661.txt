WARRNAMBOOL. At the annual meeting of subscribers to the Warrnambool Hospital, a discussion took place on the disproportion of sub- scriptions from country people as compared with townspeople.It was stated that re- sidents of the shire, which has a popula- tion of 9,500, contributed 30 per cent of sub- scriptions, and sent about 70 per cent of patients; the town with a population of 6,500, subscribed 70 per cent., and sent 30 per cent of patients. It was considered by several members that a poor rate should be imposed if country people would not sub- scribe more liberally. The officers ap- pointed were President, Mr. A. D. Dob- son; vice president Mr. Jas. Durrs; hon. treasurer, Mr. A. W. Butt; hon. auditors, Messrs Paterson and Helpman. Some consternation is being caused by the conduct of a man who is masquerading as a ghost at night in secluded parts of the town He has been seen with a white sheet, on, and also with his vest covered with phosphorus. Several women and children have been frightened, and on Friday night one woman got a shock from which she has not yet recovered. The police have been endevouring to find the perpetrator of these tricks.
