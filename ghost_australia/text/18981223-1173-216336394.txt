She tttinguisbfed the as she. closed the door of the i>est room, she locked it and slipped the key into her pocket. No one should know of hex folly. .Forah instant the glare from Miss Prime's kitchen light flaredout on io the snow. Then Die; man ..who lad knocked stepped inside, and,.taking the lamp from the woman's shaking hand, placed it on the table. Neither had spoken, for to Miss Prime- this was. but another of the day's ghosts, and although the man had planned many phrases, in the presence of the woman he had loved for fifteen yean and more his tongue was tied. " Do you still believe that I am -not worthy of your lore, Angy ?" he saidat last. It was almost as if he had been gone from her fifteenminutes instead of fifteen years,- • and her answer was given as it would harre been had he come back for an explanation in that far away past. " No, I never did believe that." ' But you listened toihe stories againstme.' I—I didn't believie^hem." " But you sent me from you." ' I only wanted to be sure that I loved you.' " And you are sure now " Yes, E1L" After a little while Miss Prime eaii shyly : " Our supper's ready, Ell." Then^rimson flush dyed her cheeks. " Goodness 1 MdRS," she cried, " you sit right hen end dtn't move until I call you f" .. . Then_«he.disappeared into the beit JBftoan. , s q u i e t l y - ijbe "I thought it wopia lo^k. more sociable for you to see the table set for two." ^
