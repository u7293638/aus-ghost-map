MR. BILLSON, MLA., AND PAYMENT OF MEMBERS. .RTTITOTt EVE THE! AHO B. Sir,-Thinking that the action in "another place" might give rise to some debate, I dropped into our "talkee" house this afternoon. I was not disappointed. The drama was advanced another stage. I was an Ovens elector in the last election, and having voted for Mr. Billson-in a certain critical division-I naturally watched him. Having a very distinct recollection how emphatically he pronounced against payment of members, in the innocence of my heart I expected him to go with the "noes" to the left instead he went stolidly with the "eyes" on the right I Bay stolidly, for he hold his head down as though intently study, ing the Appropriation Bill, when really, it the truth were known, sundry pledges given in St. George's Hall, Beechworth, come like unwelcome ghosts before his vision. Mr. Billson made quite clear to many of us who voted for him that we were saying good-bye to anything like an able or even intelligent discussion of what might be brought before the Assembly : but we were assured he was honest, could be relied on, it and hence we voted for him, and so narrow was the majority by which he won, that perhaps it is not too much to say that had I and my friends not voted as we did the election might have gone the other way. Oh, Mr. Billson, have you forgotten that " be sure your sin will find you out !" Nemesis, especially in politics in this part of the world, is swift-footed, as Sir James M'Culloch found in the last election, and miriam will find in another election not AN OVENS ELECTOR. Dec 12.
