Dream Tisions. i, The garden lies in silence-shadow deep ! , , On filmy wings of purple, soft, unfurl'd, Comes that ethoreal presence wo call sleep, To drug the throbbing sonsos of the world. ' Still is the night-ah, Heaven, how still and clear ! Acacia wrapp'd in showering shoots of bloom Droops ghost-like o'er tho pathway ; I can hear A scented potal falling in tho gloom. Oh, love ! whom nevermore I may call mine, I hear thy footsteps on tho pathway now : ,1 hear the music of that voice of thine As distinct harp notes, tremulous and low. I fold thee in mino arms-ah, rest, my love ! In this doath-silonco rest thou on my heart ! The wind goes shuddoring to palo stars above, We two are boro alono-tho world apart. Nay, steal not yot away ; my lips aro laid Upon thy lips of shadow-rest awhile Ah, me ! that spirit form may not be stay'd, And thy dream-presence passes in a smile.
