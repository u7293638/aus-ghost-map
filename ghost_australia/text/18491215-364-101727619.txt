PADDY THE PIPER. "I'L .tell you;:Sir, a mighty quare story, and it's as thrue as I'm standin' here, and that's no lie':- ::: '-It was in the time. of tihe 7ruction, (in surfection) whinl t 1e6 g"inifinei: days like many a fine fellow.s: pr!cioius lifhe,twasciiut 9shiot by iaison 'of. the f iiartial.law- that wouldn't, let a dacent boy. .be .out in the evenint, good or bad:; for Twhin: the day's work was over, divil· a" one - of uz dar go to meet a frind over 'a gl'ass, or.. a ;girl : at the dance, but must go home, and; shutourselves up, and never bridge nori rise- latch, nor dhlrw:boult antil the morning kern agin. "Well, to come ,to my story :-'Twas afther nightall .and we.wor sittin' round, the fi?e, and the pi?ties wor boilin', and the nog gins of ,butthermilk .wa standin'. ready for our suppers, whin a knock kem to the door. " ' Whisht:!' says my father, 'here's the sojers come upon us- now,' says., he; ' bad luck to .;thim, the villians, I'm afeared they seen a glimimer of the fire through the crack in the door,' says h e. f No,' says my motlier, ' for I'm afther hahigii'. an ouldi sack and -my iew petticoat agin it, awhile.ago.' w: ell, whishlt,' any how,' says my father, ' for theie'.s a knock ,agi3;' and we 'all held our tongues till another thump kem to the door. ":' Ohit's a folly to purtind. anymore,' says my father--. -they'e too cutetobe :put off thdt-a-way,9,says he. I Go, Shamus,'.says he to me, ' and see who's in.it."'? " -.How: can I see who's in it in the dark ?': says . - -I. - \- "Well,!'says- hei `light the candle thin, . and see who'sin :it, but don't open the door, for your life, barrin, .they.

"'O:?bloody iwar?!' says: I Paddy, wouldn't be in yo.i shoes ffd the ,king's ransoin,' says, I fo?'f you know .youiself it's a hangin' atmatier to iei cotched out" these times,' says I ;. '.Sure:l know that,' says :he, O.G.od help me; :aud that's whiat"I kern.- toyourfoi,'says ;:he and let:. me in for ould acquaintance si?ke, says poor Paddy . :,. `.Olh, bylthis `ad l'.th ' ??a;',sys I, I darnt 'open. the door for thlie .wide world,; : and sure you knoiv it and thioth, if the Husshians i.- the Yeos (Yeometn);" ketches you;' says; I, . they'll miirther you, as sure asyour nami'e's Paddy.' "'Many thanks to yoi,' says he, .'for y?t god iiitinttions ;Ibut,;'jlaze" the pigs, I hopie it's not the likes o: :that is istore for me, any how.':. "'Faix then,'.. says I, 'you had betther lose no time in hidin' yourself,' says I; 'for, throth I .tellyou?:it'ýi a'.;shdrt: thrial and a long:rope the Husshians would be after givin' you--fori they've no justice, and less marcy, the villians !'' -:m -s te :- ith t'hin: mor'e's the raison you Should leti mein,' Shanmus,' says poor Padd r. "'It's 'a folly to talk,' says I, 'I dair't open the doori,.'.s : :... ..-i,:: : : . 'Oh then, millia murthe' ?, says Paddy, ' what'll become of'me at all at all, says he. ;" Go af into the shed,' says I, ' behin' th6 house, where the cow is, and there thli"ers an iligant lock o' straw, that you may go sleep.in,' says I, ' and a fine bed it id'be for a lord, let alone a piper.' .. .. - " So off Paddy set to hlide i thli? hed; and throth it wint to bur hiearts to refuse him, and turn him away from' the door, more by token whlien the praties was ready -for sure the bit and the sup is always welkixim to the poor thraveller. Well,' we ildl wint to bed, and Paddy hid himself in the cow- house; and now I must tell you how it was with Paddy: " You see, afthcr sleeping for some time, Paddy wakened up, thinkin' it was mornin', but it wasn't mornin' at all, but only the light o' the moon that desaved him; but at all evints, he wanted to be stirrin' airly, be kase he was goin' off to the town hard by, it bein' fair day, to pick up a few ha'pence with his pipes-for the divil a betther piper was in all the counthry round, nor Paddy; and every one gave it up to Paddy that he was iligant an the pipes, and played 'Jinny bang'd the Weaver,' beyant tellin,' and the ' Hare in the Corn,' that you'd think the very' dogs was in it, and the horsemen ridin' like mnad. " Well, as I was sayin', he set off to go to the fair, and he wint meandherin' along through the fields, but he didn't go far, antil climbin' up through a hedge, when he was comin' out at t'other side, his head kern plump agin somethin' that made the fire flash out iv his eyes. So with that he looks up-and what do you think it was, Lord be marciful to uz, but a corpse hangin' out of a branch of a three. "' Oh, the top o' the mornin' to you, Sir,' says Paddy, ' and is that the way with you, my poor fellow ? throth you tuk a start out o' me,' says poor Paddy; and 'twas thrue for him, for it would make the heart of a stouter man nor Paddy jump, to seethe like, and to think of a Chrishthan crathur being banged.up, all as one as a dog. "Now, 'twas the rebels that hanged this chap-bekase, you see, the corpse had got clothes an him, and that's the raison that one might know it was the rebels-by raison that the Ilusshians and the Orangemen never hanged any body wid good clothes an him, but only the poor and definceless era thurs, like uz; so, as I said before, Paddy knew well it was the bolls that done it; and,' says Paddy, eyin' the corpse, 'by my sowl, thin, but you have a beautiful pair o' boots aft you,' says he, ' and it's what- I'm thinkin' you won't have any great use for thim no more; and sure it's a shame to the likes o' me,' says he, ' the best piper in ,the. sivin counties, to be trampin' wid a pairo6f ould brogues not worth three tranieeens, andi a corpse .with such an iligant pair o': boots, that wants some one to, wear. thim. .So, with that, Paddy lays hould of -him by the boots, arid began-a pullin' at .thim, but they wor: mighty stiff;- and whether it was by raison of their bein' so tight, or the branch of the three a-jiggin' ip an down, all as one as a iveighdee buckettee, an not lettin' Paddy cotch any right hoiilt o'-thim-he could get -no advantage o' thim at all-and at last he gev it up, and was goin' away, whin lookin' behind him agin, the sight of the iligant fine boot was too much for him, and he turned back, determined to have. the boots, any how, by fair means or .foul; and I'm loath to;tell you now how he got-thim- ~for. indeed it was a. dirty turn, and throtli it, was the only dirty turn I ever knewi Paddy to be guilty av; iand you, see it was:tlhis aivay;: pon my sowl, he;pilled ,outa °big knife, and, by tihe same token it~ was a knife with a fine: buck- handle, and, a murtherin' big blade, that an uncle o' imine, that iwas a gardener. at the lord's, made Paddy a prisint av; and, more by tokenr, it waas ion:the first mischief' tlhat knife 'done,' for'it cut love be tween thim, that was ,the best o6f frinds be fore , ;and sure 'twas the wondher -:of every one, that two' knowledgeable .,men, that ought to know betther, would d6o -the likes, and give and take sharp steel ih frindshii?; but I'i foirgettiri'--- wve!l,.he. outs with his knife, and what. does he .do, but he cuts off the legs of the corpse; '.and,' says l?e~ 'Ican take off the boots at my convaynience;'- and throth it wasas'I said before, a dii~y!turnii . S\ell, Sir lie tuck'e. the legs under his arms; and at that minit the moon peeped out from behind a cloud-' Oh ! is it there yoi are ?' says he to the moon, for he was an impidint chap-and thin, seein' that he made a mistake, and that the moon-light deccaved him, and that it wasn't the airly dawn, as he conceaved; and bein' friken'd for fear himself might be cotched and trated like the poor corpse he was afther a mal threating, if he was found walking the coun thry at that time-by gar, he turned about, walked back agin to the cow-house, and hidin': the corpse's legs in the sthraw, Paddy wint to sleep agin. But what do you think ? tIhe divil a long Paddy was there antil the sojers came in airnest, and, by the powers, they carried off Paddy-and faith it was only sarvin' him right for what he done to the pooi corpse. "( Well, whin the mornin' kem, my father says to me, ' Go, Shamus,' says he, ' to the shed, and bid poor Paddy come in, and take share o' the praties, for, I go bail, he's ready for his breakquest by this, any how ? " Well, out I wint to the cow- house, and called out ' Paddy !' and afther callin' three or four times, and gettin' no answer, I wint in, and called agin, and divil an answer I got still. ' Blood-an-agers!' says I,' Paddy, where are you at all at all ?' and so, castin' my eyes about the shed, I.seen two feet sticking out from undher the hape o' straw -' Musha! thin,' says I, ' bad luck to you, Paddy, but you're: fond of a warm corner, and maybe you haven't made yourself as snug as a flay in a blanket? but I'll disturb your dhirames, I'm thinkin',' says I, and with that I laid hould of his heels, (as I thought, God help me,) and, givin' a good pull to waken him, as I intinded, away I wint, head over heels; and my brains. was. a'most knocked out agin thel:wall. " Well, whin I recovered' myself ,.therel: was, an the broad o' my back, atd' two thiigs sticlkin' out o' 'iy hinds like a '-pai? ;o. I-Iusshian's horse-pist'ls-and I.thought the sight 'id lave my eyes, when I- seen they wor two mortial legs. " . . " My jew'l, I threw them down like a hot pratee, and jumpin' up, I roared out millia murther. ' Oh, you murtherin' villian,' says I, shakin' my fist at the-'cow---' Oh, yoi'iihn nath'ral baste,' says I, 'you've- " ate poor; Paddy, you thievin' cannible, you'ie :'ioise' than a neygar,' says I; ' and bad luck ltd you, how dainty you are, that nothin "'id; sarve you for your supper, but tthe, best:pipr: in Ireland. WVeirasthru ! .:weircstiru ! what'll the whole counthry say to such ran unnath'ral murther? and you lookiti'as in. nocent there as- a lainb, and atin'.your hay as quite as if notliin'ihappened.' With-that,. I run out-for, throth, I didn't -like to- be near her--and, goin' into the houseI: tould: them all about it.: - - "' Arra.h ! be aisy' says iby; father:. "' Bad luek.to the lie I tell you,' says I.: "'Is it ate Paddy ?' says they. "' Divil a doubt of it,' says I. "' Are you ,suie, Shamus ?' says my mo ther. "'I wish I was assure.:of a new pair o' brogues,' says I. :Bad luck to the bit she has left iv him but his two legs•.', "' And do you tell ine she ate the pipes too ?'` says. mniyfather. ",By gor, I b'lieve so,' says I. :: ' " Ohh: the divil fly away yw?id her,' says he, 'what a cruel taste shelha3s fdr munsi !' "Arrah !' says? my- mother;, ' don't be cursmin the cow that' gives the milk to the childhei. "'( Yis, I -will,' says my, father; ' why shouldn't I. curse sich: an :unnath'ral baste'?' 'f '.You ougli'tn't to curse any litiin' thing that's undher your roof,' says my tlother.. : "'By .my. sowl;, thin,' ..ys: my father,: 'she shan't be undher . my. roof any more ;. for I'll sind her. to the fair this minit;' says he, ' and sell her for whateve :she'll hbring.

" 'Throth I:,don't like.to dhrive her, says "Arilrah, don't be in' a gomm..agh of yourself,' says he.... i"'Faith, I don't,' says I i'" - e.ll, like or :no like,'? :Isays he you must :dhrive her:. - :" asie, yfaiii. ys , 'you could- take more cire ivhei youiself' ý;' "'That's'mighlty good,' says he, -to.keep a doeg, amd: bark:. myself ;'. and,, faith, I rec'llected the sayin-: -fi'om that hour--' let ime have iio more woids :aboutit says he 'but .be aff widl.you.: "So 8 aff Iwvintiandd it s nolie I m tellii'4 whin.

(He was' a snug lookin' farmer, 'ridin'a purty little gray hack.) - - . - . . "'Faith, thii,; you're right enough,' says I, 'it. is to the fair I'm goin'.: . "' What do youexpee' for her ?' says he. ' Faith, thin, myself doesn't know,' says I-and that was thrue enough, you see, be kase I was bewildhered like about the baste, entirely.
