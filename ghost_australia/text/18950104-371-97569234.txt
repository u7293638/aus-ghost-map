A Splendid Funeral Sermon. -TO BE: READ IMPRESSIVELY AND ALOUD. [By Brother Gardener, of the Limekilm ? Club] In announcia' de death of Brudder Sundown v7hite, which took place las' week,' said Brother Gardener, as he rose at the last meeting of the Lime kilmn Club, ' I wish to state dat he was no hero. He was not known by sight or name to 50 people in all dis world. Probably de greatest thing he eber did in all his life was to stop a runaway mewl. Nobody heard of him. in. oonneckshun wid Congris, de Legis lachnr, de Common Council, or any odder public offis. He nebber published a book, wrote a song, nor delibered a lecktur. I doubt if he eber took laughin' gas, rode on a 'lectric street kyar or had a chimbley on his house burnt out. He was jist a plain, eberyday sort of man, an* strangers passed him by widout a second look. A tew of us in dis club, but only a few, knowed him fur what he was— a man of hoBS sense. ' Brudder White didn't know nuffin' 'bout de pyramids of Egypt, but he was de puBSon who diskibered dat salt would make cabbages head up a week airlier dan usual. ' He nebber read fo' lines of poetry in all his b'n days, an' yit in one brief y'ar he found three plugs of terbacker, two jackknives, an' a five dollar bill on de sidewalk. 'He nebber saw Niagara Falls nor hear the roarin' of de sea, an' yit de white man who loaded twenty different sticks of wood wid powder an' left 'em on his pile couldn't blow Brodder White up. He got his supply from de bottom of de woodpile. ' Dat man nebber tooken a book on philosophy in his hand, an' yit he reasoned it out dat de man who paid cash down for his goods got no cheaper prices dan de deadbeat. ' Brudder White didn't de meanin' of de word persuasive,' an' yit, when I found him fillin' a bag wid mv cow cumbers one dark night, -he make me believe dat he reckoned he was in a white man's tater patch two miles away. ' It has bin said dat he was neither . aluvin' husband nor an affeckshunate fadder. Dat was a matter of philosophy wid him. He reasoned it out dat de mo' yo' lav yo'r wife de mo' new bonnets she wants, an' de mo1 affeckshunate yo' chlll'en de faster deir shoes w'ar out. 'Pears to me me he was perfeckly k'rect in dat. Should I go home to night an' kiss my ole woman an' ax her how her lame back got 'long she'd jist stand up an' want a new pa'r of yaller shoes an' blue stockin's to match. ' Brudder White owned a fightin' dawg, an' dat ciawg had fout ebery day of his life, but de owned nebber made no mistake— -dat is, he nebber rushed inan' , kicked «le odder man's dawg an' got his self sent to de hospital. He jist knowed dat human natur' would fight quicker an' harder . ober a two dollar .daTg dan 'bout a question of State rights.or a new Tariff Bill. 'On many occashuns. de late lamented was axed to decide disputes 'bout Jonah an' de whale an' Dan'i ' in de lions' den. He nebber cum to no decishun. He knowed dat if be decided dat de whale swallered- Jonah he'd sartinly lose one friend, an' if he said dat Dan'l wasn't 6keered when he found hisself among de . lion 6 den somebody vouid steal his, whitewash pail an' brushes to git even. When de dispute got redhot, Brudder White wonld try an' turn de snbjick to dreams an' ghosts an' cool ebery body down. ' While he didn't say. much, he observed and reasoned. If, in walkin' around, he cum across a sign of * No admittance/ he walked right in an' asked de reason why an' all 'bout it. Dat saved him- from gwiue home an1 wonderin' if it was a powder factory or de city hall. When he cum to a rail rode an' de sign of * Look out fur de rngiae,' he reasoned dat de sign was put up wid an' objick in view. He'd wait, around dar an1- look ont if it took him all day. ' 'Brudder White didn't pay as much pew rent as some, but he paid it ebery day an' in adyahce. Ebery mawnin' of hid life for. y'ars past he walked : ober to de «abin of de chnrch treasurer an1 laid down his nickel, an' if- dey hev any finanshul . panic in dat odder land de hardupness can't be laid. -to., him. He was, as I may. say right heab, de only pussou dat 1 eber knowed in all dis world who was willing to advance de Lawd 35 cents a week an' nebber ask 'fur a receipt. ..?-:/. :? .- ? ;?:???-'. .;-.-.. k ???--. - ?
