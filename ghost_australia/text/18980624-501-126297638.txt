The Late Referendum andl the Next. Moral victory both sides claim. Parliament must bear the blame Of the futile referendum. Undismayed, renew the fight ; As for those who when they might,' Wouldn't itte tlieir power aright ; After August— God defend 'em ! Soon tho charter must be signed (Deed bo long desiderated). Dolegates have met and 'wined.', . Quarrelled, compromised and dined, Aud 'tis known to all mankind How wo nearly fedoraled. Somo there bo who tempted Fate, Scorned their masters' clear mandate ; Now they cry, ' Too late ! too late !' In exceeding tribulation. Too late lo explain or fawn, Soon they'll fly when graveyards yawn ; Fly like gibbering ghosts nt dawn Of our glorious Federation. Trouble's waiting them in pecks, Barton's feet nre on their necks — No more picnics, no more cheques ; No more spouting in tho Forum ! Federal members fill each chair, Federal trumpets gaily blare, Hunted, scouted, everywhere, Till tliey scarcely form a quorum. Isolation is a sin, Union means strength concentrated, From the start once more begin. Pool the debts, join kin to kin, Fight again and fight to win, 'Till we're really federated. Kvans River. S. F.
