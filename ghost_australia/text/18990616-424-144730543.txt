Kloloiig'i Champion. At Wellington on Saturday Ted. Robardu, Molong's ohampion sprinter, added still another win to his already lengthy list. He mot T. Brummell in a foot- raoe'of 180 yards, conceding the latter seven yards start, for a stake of Â£20 aside. There were about 800 persons present to witness the match. After going 103 yards Robards over hauled his opponent, and won with ease by two yards. This will be good news for the popular sprinter's friends in this district, and verifies the opinion expressed by this journal when Brum mell issued his challenge, viz., that the latter ' wouldn't have the ghost of a chance of defeating Ted.'
