CHAPTEB X -OIL AXD WATER. IThe table <Tkote of the Grand Hotel ?de liad^Jiist composed itself te 1 bisque and Burgundy, when, an Englishman entered hurriedly, glanced right and left, and demanded of the attendant Mercury where his seat might be, adding that he had wired for a place to be reserved. Me<cury grimaced a little as in sur prise, cudgelled his memory, and found it wanting. 1 Over there,1 he whimpered, * Monsieur will find an ex cellent seat. further end of the tablej ' by devoung lady vid de young gentleiiaans.

Apropos?- . . ; _**:?? **He'a; gambled away a thousand: pounds at Monte^ <5arlb/ hissefl Kate, aud it was my money.'" ? The squire felt awkward.

The squire looked at her -with an expression of surprise. Very plain features were not improved by a viperish expression, nor was it pleasant to contemplate the spectacle of. a young wife thus accusing her ' husband to a total stranger. * I suppose the rapture of a toney * moon/ he replied, 4 brought on a very aggravated attack of black or scarlet fever!. Which was it, Charley ?' j Oh,' snapped Kate, flushing to the roots of her brown hair, it's no laughing m^ttfr. A thousand .pounds would have' . * Bother!' ejaculated Charley, who could hardly keep his seat for rage, * there's plenty more where that came " from.? ? ' 4 Yes,' she retorted^ with a cynical laugh, * bat it is my father's, alid will be tnine:' 4Q,niteso,' muttered her husband defiantly, 4audif it hadn't been tied tightly on you I think I may say, with truth, you would not have made a captive of me.' * He calls himself a captive!' almost sobbedKate, turning a pair of indigpant eyes en the squire. \- *A%illing One, I am sure,' added that judicious gentleman, in the hope of pouring oil upon the troubled waters. * I suppose you are going homewards ?' _ * ";L- T ,"; 4 Why, yes,' murmured Kate.

Charley Fitzhugh worried,* and in SL dogged moOd, qui te dissonant to-bis old bright teniperaineot, his wife, oil the other "band,' surcharged with spite. 'That is very unfortunate,' was John Crucival's quiet reply. ' 4 Very,' echoed Kate. But if young Benedicks will gamble and pick »up, strange acquaintances " in strange places, why" ^ ' Upon my honor "that is too bad,' cried Charley, laying dbwn his knife and fork,' and assuming the air &f; a man brought to bay.' "I Was fool ^enough to play-that I admit, tfioagh These people.squire, bowed to me-. that ifah Ml, Whereupon, my dear little wife invented at4rrible little drama <r»f depravity, with me . fflftlie . villaiiQ^ responded J>»hn Crucival, thoroughly tired oat, is grosslyuufaiiyandthatis tomake ?

He had nevei* passed a more awkward half hour, or dined luxuriously insnch unpleasant company. With the cigarettes Kate rose. She disliked tobacco about as much as &dstpeo;^^hbc^ wrangling, so her retrfeat ended' the fight. ? ^ - :* ~* . " That's what becomes of marryitig money,* muttered Charley contemp tuously, as he watched the retiring figure of his gorgeously apparelled spouse. ?? ?' "But,5 pleaded.Tohn Crucival, *you are in the wrongh«re, my friend/ ' Well,' retorted Charley,' * and suppose I am ? Do yon imagine that a woman who had no coin to back her would carry on in snch a fashion ?' 'Why not-if shewas jealous and angry? Besides, I thought your wife, Charley, was gone on you ?' * So she was. So she is. 1 That's the worst of it. She would have taken the ugly drop of four figures like a lamb but for those French girls. Andyet, l give you my word, there vwas no harm. A little chaff that was the best and tbe worst.' 'Then, Charley, make ifc up.

Tbe sqnire nodded gravely. 1 * TJjbere was a little sort of "flirtation,' continued Charley, * some years ago between us. I. was a boy; she was a girl, and it ended uaturally in ?4 Best for you and best for me.® I was sorry, but the affair looked so utterly impossible 'I thought it advisable to suppress my feelings, and'-.: ' To ignore hers,' suggested the squirei ' ' Quite so-there was no middle course. Well, alter our marriage Kateand I rah down to Dilford and put up atmy uncle's. Our visit lasted btit forty-eight hours, in which brief space we contrived to call at Crucival and see all of my old friends. Some one-I wish Ilknew who the fiend was -told Kate toomnch. Worse still, we passed that poorlittle ihing, Lil, onour way to the Court, and my silly old aunt, in a vein of mmwaise f&atisanterie;, alluded to her as my old flame. Kate had already remarked her good looks, so up went ber temper like a rocket. In vain I protested. She snarled like a fury. At last I had to ask my unci**, the rector, to assure; her that I had given him a pledge, years ago, to stop that game of folly, and h«d religiously kept it:' ' And fchjat pacified my lady?' 'A little. But of course it's; exceedingly unpl easant tobe tacked onto a jealous woman with an un controllable temper. It isn't as though I was madly in love with her. She is not, to be frank:, the sort of a woman' any man could hatch up a sentiment a^out. Lil Brocket now is different. 1 sbe' -* 'Leave her alone,' said the squire | in a tone bordering on sternness. : Cliayley stared a little. *' Why,%4ie asked, * do you think I did the wrong; thingvbythat |»irl?*,. - '- .."M * Fd rather not discuss that pro Weui/ replied John CruciraL 4 Her father is»a friendof mine.

And so over John Crucival's largesse they did kiss, but were the\r friends. We shall see. , CHAPTER XI.-Nemesis. The squire, after leaving Iiilias, had at once given, orders thas his luggage w&s; to follow him, and left for lion don. The blow hit Mm hard-not as it wonld have wounded another, in the direction of mnoiL-*- propr% but rather because his fairy illusion had been dissipated, And lie felt like one who, having been a firm believer, has suddenly been changed to scepticism: ' The ideal idol an imaginative brainhad moulded with such inconsequent art was shattered; While Ibis people were packing a bag in naste arid the carriage was being pat to, he wrote 'a letter to liady Manaton: 4 ©earest A^antie.-I tfainS: I shall abandon Crucival altogether to your disposition if you will consent to live and look aftei things, Th* place, certes Will know me no more, I have just passed through the bitterest experience a tortured breast can writhe under in being repulsed by one' At this point the carriage was an nounced, so he hastily crammed the unfinished epistle into his desk, and ^ ni^d^touir hisancient home aluidkt^ ^bp^pliieiiled;:;-'r;:;-'^ ; He did noit ^fess thait Mr, Robinson j happened to have a master- key to open every lock io his sanctum, or he would jiei^liaveleftthat confession! in black and white behind him. As it I was, his abrupt exodus bavingbeen reported to that limb of the law, ere ^Vervbe reached the metropolis acare ful" investigation had taben pla^e of his small correspondence, his diary containing sion I/il, and the coo nterf oil of his cheque-book, together with/this tell £ale avowqi.

True there were certain details to he arranged befo^^appiyim . Jor^ a summons;and being |l ^ bensive lest his bird should escape, be wired for a detective from Scotland Yard, whereby, the c nipt it .was placed lUider/sOTWplWce.;^.^..; : As for. that wretchedindividnal, when the tidings earned val's flight, his nervousness increased. He did not for a moment surmise that Lilies had dismissed her admirer, neither did the' young lady it. necessary to inform him on the subject. On the contrary, he attri buted the squire's departure to information concerning- himself* conveyed possibly per llobinson, .possibly per the baron. Guilt will ever raise ghosts to torment itself, and the hideous presentiment of approaching evil haunted him to such an extent that he actually contem plated making a dash for some such impossible-region as Sierra Leone with a few pounds at his disposal* and with intent kissed Lilias and; strolled towards the railway station. He had not, however, advanced three yards beyond his own gate when be espied a stranger.Somebojfr it occured to him that he had noticed that identical man idling on that identical spot tho previous evening, but he passed hitn leisurely ^ with apparent unconcern. A few minutes afterwards be chanced to look hack, ann now that idle fellow had suddenly ceased bis idling, and was following in his wake. It might mean nothing, so be marched into the bar of the Bishop Blaise Inn, drank a glass of beer, chatted with the landlady, and emerged. There was that same idler, and again when he turned towards the station, f ootsteps echoed behind hit*i. He shivered inuoluntarily. "What did. this mean? Bewildered, his heart beating, yet with the resolution of dispair, he hurried onwards. A train to Teverley was overdue. He took a ticket, and as soon as . the locomotvie stopped^ jumped into a crowded carriage, and macle for the farther corner. Tbe idling fellow somehow did not trouble to ask for a ticket, but whimpered to the guard and took his seat in the same carriage, a passenger being moved to make room for him. This manoeuvre carried its £wn inference on the face of it; so Captain Allister, his face flushing, just before the train started, made a dash for the door and regained the platform. Then he tore up his ticket'and walked home, the detective still dogging his steps. Entering, he slammed the door-in the man's face with such force as to startle^ Lilias, who petulanty inquired what in the world was the matter ? ' Simply this, girl,' cried the old sinner, the muscles of his face seeming to knot in bis wild despera tion, ' the game's up 'What do you. mean? Dear, daddy, what has happened ?' He paused, as one choking. . It really looked as if words coiild not. escape those liyjd, quivering,jLips. At last, with a mightyeffort, he contrived io stammer, ? It's come to this: You. and I must part company. . Never mind what becomes of me, or where I go to, saute qui geutl You must find a home somewhere at once, a» governess, companion, or something." 'Why, daddy?' (To be Continued). 4 .
