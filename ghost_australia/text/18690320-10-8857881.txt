I ' ADVANCE TASMANIA ? TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY SIR-My mind having been somewhat agitated with passing events for the last few days, my sleep has not been of that pleasant character which I usually enjoy, but has been disturbed by dreams , caused, no doubt, by my having anxiously waited for years past, that something might turn up for pool Tasmania Dreams are considered to embody (if I may use the term) our waking thoughts, of form, no doubt, in a very mutilated form, still, however, making some impression on the brain, and we are thereby able to reproduce them my dream last night was as follows, extending over a space of several years, but every event as plainly indicated as those announced annually in our almanacks - Mai cb 22nd, 1809 -W L C elected an M L C to represent the district of Hobart (happy day in our annals) August 15th Railway Bill carried through the upper house by the untiring exertions and influence of W L On August 17 -Ministry resign, W L C is sent for,cannotfoi in a Ministry, proposes to have a nominee Upper House to effect his purpose August 20 -House of Assembly dissolved Nov 1 Universal suffrage and payment of members resolved upon, and the constitution altered by the new Parliament Nov 17 -W L C in the ascendant (great expectations), Main Line Railway Loan Bill passed by acclamation, one million and a half for the Railway, Â£500,000 for connecting tramways Nov 30 Prosperity of the colony advances (in prospects) W L C proclaimed as the only true patriot that Tasmania has over produced, being so entirely disinterested in all he does, expects to be knighted, retire, and go to England as Sir William, Le March 21st, 1870 Unsatisfactory news from England falls on the colony like a thing derbolt, the railway loan cannot be floRed on the Stock Exchange owing to non payment of interest, and, among other causes, to reports that the Premier of Tasmania (Yv L C ) WAS, or had been, connected with a certain company of a very odoriferous character, in more senses than one, by which some of the members had been considerable losses April 1st (ominous says-A sudden collapse -the to credit of the colony at an end debentures down to 35 July, 1871 -The Imperial Government step in to prevent a general smash, by passing a bill enacting that constitutional government shall cease in this colony, that the name of Tasmania shall be again altered to Van Diemens' Land, and the colony made a dependence on " Western Australia " for the next half century, as a punishment for not having improved her privileges, but, alas ' become (poll locally) sunk in moral turpitude of the deepest dye I awoke suddenly, and found happily that this, Sit, was only a dream, and dreams are said to go by contraries May we not hope that in this case it may be so ? That the worthy representative of about one third of the R and P Association may be able to accomplish by his administrative talent (which only has to be proved) all that he desires and promises to do, to the admiration of his thick and thin friends and supporters, and the dismay and destruction of his cowardly enemies and detractors Then, Sammy the high minded and noble liberator of Tasmania from its present state of thraldom, enjoy a peaceful retirement from public life, and lived, many, many years, unmolested by " Billy's Ghost," which, at present (if report speaks of sly) keeps up a rather unpleasant for a life with one of the candidates for the representation of the district of Hobart AN ELECTOR N B -Tasmania " expects that every man will do his duty to his country, at this eventful crisis ' Hobart Town, March 18th, 1899
