THURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 1898: " It is plain dial the result of the test matches is too much for the philosophy of the British public. It has pricked John Bull's easy-going visits Somerville stolid temper into a spasm of un- reasoning finger with his own representatives. A hundred British newspapers are no doubt at the present moment occupied In distilling angry Ink on the heads of Mr. Stoddart and his fellow cricketers. The batting of the English team in these articles is described by wrathful English critics as 'wretched and paltry." This is, of course, lies is absurd and unjust. Frenchmen are accustomed to explain a defeat by the theory that they have been betrayed, and are ready to de- nounce In shrillest accents their own unfortunate representatives. But British good temper is usually of a tougher quality, and British justice of a more stable equilibrium. Mr. Stoddart's men have fought two losing games will gallant courage and no mean skill, and they deserve a better fate than, to be abused by English newspapers. Australian critics will certainly not underrate the fine qualities of the Englishmen. To do that would be to disparage the feat of our own men, and to dim the halo which shines just now on the somewhat astonished brow of Australian cricket. I'd have inflicted a single innings defeat twice in succession on what English critics themselves described as "the most formidable combination ever put upon the field to maintain " the honour of English cricket is a very shining performance, and one which raises the fame of Australian cricket to its very zenith. No doubt many ingenious "explain " lions" of the causes which have led to this double defeat of the English Eleven will be attempted. But these two overwhelming defeats need a good deal of "explaining" before they can be whittle- out of ex- ist ence. The defeat on the Melbourne ground by mi innings and ."."i runs might be sniffed at as a " Finke." But "linkes" do not usually go in pairs. The almost equally severe defeat on the Adelaide ground, a little more than a week afterwards, by mi innings and 161 runs, shows that the Australians have won on their merits, and by sheer force of more aggressive batting, fine. bowling, and more brilliant Holding. "Form" in ii cricketer is a curiously fluctuating and evasive quality. It appears and vanishes like a ghost. The batsman who can make a "century" to-day may next week, earlier something-if only a trouble in the bllo-gliuids-hits disturbed the subtle harmony of eye and wrist and nerve, sink to the ignominy of a "duck"! The "devil" will sometimes leak suddenly and mysteriously out of a great bowlers' deliveries, without the disgusted bowler himself being in the least able to explain the circumstance. And. whatever may be the case when the next test match has to be played, it is certain that in the last two, matches the Australians have been In tiller form than the English- men, and have played better cricket. The Englishmen's turn will, no doubt, come in due course, and then Australian scorers will have a very active time of II, and there will be deep joy in the hearts of English crowds on the other side of the sea. The Australians, in these marches it may be frankly admitted, have had thcbnlanee of' luck on their side. It was good luck for the Australians to gain the toss twice in succession. It was hard luck for the Englishmen to have to bat in an Adelaide dust-storm. But when all this is conceded the performance of the Australians remains a brilliant record in the cricketing history of the colonies. The English butting in the last two matches, it may he added, was plainly crippled by an over-anxiety, which, if it did not amount to nervous- ness, produced many of its mischief. The strain of disaster, too, reveals a flaw In Mr. Stoddart's team. It includes too many men to whom Australian I turf is a revelation and the light of Australian skies a perplexing and dazzling mystery. Out of the thirteen members of the team only four have played under Australian ('(militions previously. It might have changed the fortune of the last two matches if the English team and included an Abel or an Albert Ward in its ranks. Every geiierous-nilntli'tl Australian will heartily wish that Mr. Stoddart may win the loss at the next test match; but the whole system of determining which team shall take the wicket first by the toss of a coin Is vicious. It is plain that victory or defeat may turn on the question of which team goes first to the wickets, and this ought not to be left to the decision of mere chance. The ideal of a perfect game is to secure absolute equality of conditions for both tennis, and at every stage of the game. But no one can say that the conditions have been quite equal In the last two matches. In 11 series of (test matches, like those now in progress, it would be incomparably more just to the rival teams and more satisfactory to the general public If the choice of having in the first of the series was determined by tossing up, and then in the following matches each team alternately had the choice. Cricketers are a curiously and un- reasonably conservative class. Even the most obvious improvements are grudgingly adopted. The change from four halls to six balls in an over was resisted for years. There can be no good reason why, when a great match is in progress, the wicket should not at the close of each day's play, He put in the most perfect order possible. But the proposal to adopt this plan would be regarded as a heresy justify- ing hit the dniiintilory clauses of the Athanasian Creed! And the proposal to do away with that mysterious, mere money, the toss," at the beginning of every match In a series will no doubt be contemplated with shuddering horror by most old cricketers us 11 more excursion Into blasphemy.
