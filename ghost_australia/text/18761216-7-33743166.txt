" ' T ,B|tt reaiiy, tie Umvtmty^Jaancil ought 1 not to be content wuh things as they an. c^Te do not think it is the best thing for a youthful University to attract to itself by ■ any«dv??^v>us means, a large number «f etudenls at first. There is a good deal of quiet foundation work to be done in tile tearing of an edifice of learning, whu)h only those -who have taken part initcfn understand —-"wdrk which many will Criticise Bbt few appkrad. But thefo comes a time when there ought to be masy to rejoice m the rising structure, and help, it forward by their ptewnoa -and wo4c Andletlt be retnenibered that the studwna nods fiie University, not the Council npr the professors. If it be replied by any one, that already there are. a considerable num ber of students, it may be enquired in return how many.of these are bona Jie students, entering for a complete course of learning. Asiortbe youths and maidens who *re very usefully employing thiir vacaat hours an conning the poets, or occasionally attending the lectures of a Cavork?r?rofes?or in philosophy, these are not students in the higher sense. Popular study is one thing, and we hope it Will never be neglected as one of the subsidiary aims of the University, but learning is another thing, and this is the highest 4nd for which the University Is founded. ' Among our files by the last mail we p&~ oeived an account of the opening of; a College at Bristol, University College aaj it is called, which bids fair to be of consider able importance to the cause of higher education in the west of England. Its finances are by no means in as favorably a condition as the finances of the^ Adelaide University, but the' staff of professors Is far more complete, cGa&^the curriculnm much more extensive.
