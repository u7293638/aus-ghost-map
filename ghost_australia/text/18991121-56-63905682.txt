A Ghost in a Copper Mine. ? Â« ? ?? Blavney, Monday. Some consternation has ? been caused amongst some of the miners at the copper mine by. the visitations of a ghost in one of the shafts. The men hear strange noises, bells ringing, singing, groanings, etc. Miners going below have their candles extinguished by a supernatural visitor, and some of the men allege that something brushed passed them. Six men have left the mine owing to the terror the ghost has inspired. Some Fellow who knew what he was talking about said ' You cannct see a good thing too often' ; if that remark applies to any thing it is to that evergreen place of amuse ment, the Cyolorama in Sydney. No matter how often you go yon see something fresh in that mysterious Hall of Illusions, where there are now shown so many brain puzzlers and beautiful sights, any one of which is worth the modest shilling whioh passes you both to the Cyolorama and to the Hall of Illusions The management have determined to make the Hall of Illusions a special feature, and thoroughly up to date.* ; . . .
