OLD LADIES. I IMH world is notoriously unjust to its veterans, and above all u is unjust to its ancient females Every where, and from all time, an old woman has been taken to express the last stage of uselessness and exhaustion and while a meeting of bearded dotard goes by the name of a council of sages, and its deliberations are respected accordingly, a congregation of palsied marches IB nothing but a congregation of old woman whose thoughts and opinions on my s 2s ject whatsoever have no more value than the clutter ing of so many magpies In fact the poor old ladies have a hard time of it and it we look at it in its right light, perhaps nothing proves more thoroughly the course flavour of the world's esteem respecting women than this disdain which they excite when they are old And yet what charming old ladies one has known at times-women quite as charming in their own way at severity as their great daughters are at seventeen, and all the more so because they have no desire now to be charming, because they have given up the attempt to please for the reaction of praise, and long since have consented to become physically old, though they have never drifted into unreasonableness or neglect While retaining the intellectual vivacity and acme Br m pathies of maturity, they have added the softness, the mellowness, the tempering got only from experience and advancing age, they are women who have seen and known and read a great deal, and who have suffered much, but xx hose sorrow s have neither hardened nor secured them-rather have made them even more sympathetic with the sorrows of others, said pitiful for all the young They have lived through and lived down all their own trials, and have come out into piece on the other side That they remember the trials of the fiery passage, and they feel for those who have still to bear the pressure of the pain they have overcome These are not v omen much met with in society they are of the kind which mostly stay at home, and lets the world come to them. They have done with the hurry and glitter of life, and they no longer care to carry their grey hairs abroad , they retain their hold on the affections of their kind, they take an interest in the history, the science, the progress of the day, but they rest tranquil and content by their own fire side, and they Bit to receive e, but do not go out to gather The fashionable old lady who haunts the theatres and drawing rooms, bewigged, befitted, painted, ghastly in her vain attempts to appear young hideous in her frenzied clutch it the pleasures melting from her grasp, desperate in her wild hold on a life that is passing away from her so rapidly, knows nothing of the quiet dignity and happiness of her ancient sister who has been wise enough to renounce before she lost In her own house, where gather a small knot of men of mind and women of character, where the young bring their perplexities and they mature their deeper thoughts, the clear old lady of rare experience and loving sympathies and cultivated intellect holds a better court than is known to any of those Miserable old creatures who prowl about the gay places of the world, and wrestle with the young for their crowns and garlands- those wretched simulacra cf womanhood who will not grow old and who cannot become wise she is the best kind of old lady ex- tent, answering to the matron of classic times-to the Mother- in Israel before whom the tribes made benanee in token of respect the woman whose book 01 life has been well studied and closely read, and kept clean in all its pages he has been no price, however, and no mere idealist She must have been wife, mother, and widow that is she must have known many things of you and grief and have had the fountains of life unsealed However wise and good she may be, as a spinster she has had only half a life, and it is the best hall which has been denied her How can she tell others, when they come to her in their troubles, how time and a healthy will have wrought with her, if she has never passed through the same circumstances Theoretic comfort IS ill very well, but one word of experience goes beyond volumes of counsel based on general prince pies and a lively imagination One type of old lady, growing yearly scarcer, is the old lady of Radical political tendencies based on the doctrines of Voltaire and Paine B " Rights of Man the old lady who remembers Hunt and Thistle wood and the Birmingham riots, who talks of the French revolution as if it was yesterday, and who has heard so often of the Porteus mob from poor papa that one would think she had assisted at the hanging herself She is an infinitely old woman, for the most part birdlike, chirrup), and wonderfully active She has nex er gone beyond her early teaching, but is a fossil Radical of the old school, and she thinks the Code departed when Hunt and his set died out. She is an irreligious old creature, and scotts with more cleverness than grace it everything new or earnest She would as lief see Romanism rampant at once as this new fangled mummery they call Ritualism and Romanism is her version of the unchaining of Satan AB for science-well, it is all very wonderful, but more wonderful she thinks than true, and she cannot quite make up her mind about the spectroscope or the protoplasm Of the two, the protoplasm com- mends itself most to her imagination, for private reasons of her own connected with the Pentateuch , but these things are not so much in her way as "a ol faire and Diderot, Volney and John Paine, and she is content to abide by her ancient loves, and to leave the leaping poles of science to younger and stronger hands And this type of old lady is for the most part an ancient spinster, whose life has worn itself away in the arid deserts of mental doubt and emotional nega- tion If ever she loved it was in secret, some thin lipped embodied idea long j ears ago, but most likely she did not get even to this unsatisfactory length, but contented herself with books and discussions only If she has ever honestly loved and been loved, perhaps she would have gone beyond doubt, and have learned something holier than a soft The old lady of strong instinctive affections, who never reflects and never attempts to restrain her kindly weaknesses, Stands it the other end of the scale She is the grandmother par excellence, and spends her life in spoiling the little ones cramming them with sugar- plums and rich cake w hence er she had the chance, and nullifying mamma s punishments by surreptitious gifts and goodies She is the dearly beloved of our childish recollections and to the last days of our life we cherish the remembrance of the kind old lady with her beaming smile, taking out of her large black reticule, or the more mysterious recesses of her unfathomable pocket, wonderful little screws of paper, which her withered hands thrust into our chubby fast but we can understand now what an awful nuisance she must have been to the authorities and how impossible she made it to pre ser e anything like discipline and the terrors of the domestic law in the family the old lady who remains a mere child to the end, who looks very much like a faded old wax doll with her scanty hair blown out into transparent ringlets, and her jaunty cap bedecked with flowers and ax coloured bows, who cannot use into dignity of true womanliness, who knows nothing, can give no advice, has no sentiment of protection, but on the contrary de mandB all sorts of care and protection for herself-she simpering and giggling as it she were fifteen IS by no means an old lady of the finest type But she is better than the leering old lady who says coarse things and who, like Buanger s immortal creation, passes her time in regretting her plump arms and her well turned ankle, and the last time that can never be recalled, and who is altogether a most unedifying old person, and by no means nice company for the young Then there is the irascible old lady, who rates her servants, and is free with full flavoured epithets against shots in general, who is like a tigress over her last unmarried daughter, and when crippled and disabled still insists on keeping the keys, which she delivers up when wanted only with a snarl and a suspicious caution She has been one of the race of active housekeepers, and has prided herself on her exceptionable ability that we ty for so long that she cannot bear to give up, even when she can no longer be any good, so she sits in her easy chair, like old Pope and Pagan m Pilgrim's Progress, and gnaws her fingers at the younger world which passes her by She is an infliction to her daughter for all the years of her life, and to the last keeps her in leading strings, tied up as tight as the sinew by old hands can know them, treating her always as an irresponsible young thing that needs both gui lance and control, though the girl has passed into the middle aged woman by now-a poor spiritless thing, that has faded before she has fully blossomed, and dies like a fruit that has dropped from the tree before it has ripened 1 win sister to this kind is the (only female become ancient, the gaunt old lady with a stiff backbone, who sits upright, and walks with a firm tread like a man, a leathery old lady, xx he despises all your weak slips of girls that have nerves and headaches and cannot walk their paltry mile without fatigue a desiccated old lady, large boned and lean, without an ounce of superfluous fat about her, with keen eyes yet, with which she boasts that she can thread a needle and read small print by candle light, an indestructible old lady, who looks is if nothing short of an earthquake would put an end to her the friend other youth is now a stout, soft, helpless old lady, much Ibedrnped in woollen shawls, given to frequent Bip Tp ngB of brandy and water and ensconced in

friends and rivals Ah, poor Laura, she says, straightening herself, she has always a poor creature, and see what she is now to those who wait long enough the wheel always comes round, she thinks, and the days when Laura bore away the bell from her for grace and sweetness and nimbleness generally are avenged now, when the one is a mere mollusc and the other has a serviceable backbone that will last

quavers, and that she goes m n tripping, catching way, as if the keys of the piano were hot Sometimes she will sing, as a great f vi our, old world songs that are almost pathetic for the thin and broken voice that chumps out the sentiment with which they abound and sometimes, as a still greater favour she will stand up in the dance, and do the poor uncertain ghosts of what were once steps, in the days when dancing was dancing, and not the success lounge it is now Jut her dancing days are over, she says, after half a dozen turns, though, indeed, some times she takes a frisky fat, and pays for it the next day the very dress of old ladies is in itself a study and a revelation of character There are the beautiful old women who make themselves like old pictures by a profusion of soft lace and tender gre) s and the stately old ladies who affect rich rustling silks and sombre v ch st, and there are the original and individual old ladies, who dress themselves after their own kind, like Mrs Basil Montagu and Miss Jane Porter, and have a cachet of their own, with which fashion has nothing to do And there are the old women who wear rusty black stuffs and ugly helmet like caps, and those who affect uniformity and going with the stream, when the fashion has become national, and these have become much exercised of late with the chignon and the new bonnets. But Providence is liberal, and milliners are fertile in resources in fact, in this, as in all other sections of humanity, there are those who are beautiful and wise, and those who are foolish and unlovely , those who make the best of things as they are, and those who make the worst, by treating them as something they are not, those who extract the home), and those who find only person 1 or an old age, as in youth, are to be found beauty, use, grace, and a blue, but in different aspects and on another platform altogether and the folly is when this difference is not allowed for, or when the possibility of these graces is denied and their utility ignored -Saturday Review
