He had been received courteously and hospitably by a squatter—<laughter)—and at the same tune he had indited a telegram to take away half his ran, bat the squatter had never objected. He would have taken it all, if ft had been worth taking. (Hear; hear, and laughter.) He did not believe that as'far as- the agricultural class was ebneetned it was opposed to the sqnftt ting «lass of tiie; community. He had shown that the present Ministry must stand con dtt&ieu;, if judged by the same and xmly etandard with which they had judged the late Ministry.

(Hear, bear, and laughter, and "You're too sore," from the Treasurer.) The Estimates last year were £1,131,761 10s. 6d, and for the present year j £1471,609 Bs. Id., or an increase of £39,017 I 12b. 7cL, which would he further increased by j the Supplementary Estimates. Hie trusted the Treasurer when mnlH«g his financial speech would inform them how he could get out of the Wfikaltie? which bad beenpointed out. Bpeak-! ing of the leader of the Some, the Hon. Oom miwioner of Public Works, he believed Oat gentleman vat open to a charge of several short ooming? in tills way. (lAughter, aad hear, hear.) He was not the manto say that the hon. OommiKioner should be perfect and free from all shortcomings; but there were shortcomings that he ought to have avoided, and others that he should not have been guilty of. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the erection of the new Houses of Parliament, the hon. gentleman was very wrong in allowing that work to go on so shortly before the assembling of Parlia ment, a work involving an expenditure of £130,000. (A voice—£lso,ooo). The Hon. Commissioner should not have permitted that work to be commenced before Parliament bad net and given its opinion upon it. (A voice— Why, the House sanctioned it by its vote.} Mr. Basedow was proceeding farther upon this sub ject, when he was ruled oat of order by the Speaker, on Hie ground that he was reflecting upon the vote of the House. Sir. Basedow said he was sorry it he had offended against any of the rules of Che House, but the question of building the new Houses was being discussed in another place, and was sot yet settled there. As the money for this purpose had not yet been voted, this House Would liave another oppor tunity of expressing its opinions, and he would then avail himself of the same opportunity -to repeat that in this matter the Commissioner had hot acted as he should have dona. He could cite other instanties showing the inca pacity of the Commissioner of Public Works; and he then referred to the erection of the Gawler Station Goods Sheds having been re tarded. Honey was votedfor this purpose in 1874 —(laughter)—and if other Ministers had failed to carry out this work, the present Ministry when they obtained office declared themselves to be tire Ministry of action, and should have rectified the sins of their predecessors, but they had done nothing of the kind. During last session his colleague (Mr. Dunn) and himself pot the question, and were answered by the Commissioner of Public Works that the work should be gone on with without delay, but the work was-npt gone on with yet.' Only the pre vious day he heard with astonishment that ten ders had been accepted by the Commissioner fora shed £50 feet in length, and that after wards it was decided that it should be only 100 feet long, and the Commissioner of Public Works coolly told a deputation of bis (Mr. Basedpw's) constituents that ft had .been aoae entirely against his will, and that it was with out bis knowledge and consent that the plans had been altered. (The Commiasioaer of Public Works—" No, no.") Them there mi something' wrong in the office—a want of j itwiuifrymqait that should not exist* He would ■ not have mentioned this small matter ' only that it afforded the House some ihs^ght into the working of. the office. He would not say much against the Minister ot Crown Lands, as he rathsr liked that gentle man. He believed he had ever tried to-do hb duty like a man—(heat, hear) —and in regard to the land Bill that was on the table, it was* measure for which he deserved great credit. He had done well in that respect, and was doing his duty. (Hear, hear.) He would next deal with the Minister of Education. There seemed tobC a want of understanding between the Minister of Education and the Council of Edu cation, and Mr. Playford had hinted at some thing which occurred some time ago, when the Minister made certain assertions whioh he could not substantiate, and had to apologue to the Council. (The Minister of Agri culture and Education — " No.") It was his firm belief that whatever the quali fications and abilities of tile Minister of Agriculture and Education he did not thoroughly understand the education question. He believed our education system was drifting into a system which was never intended when the Education Act was framed. It was in tended duct the position of the teachers should be raised, that they should be placed in abettor position, financially and otherwise. (The Mmister ot Agriculture and Education—" So they are.") He demurred to that. He was aware that circulars had been sent out to the teachers, and only <me stated that he was not satisfied, but it was net said how many were dissatisfied. He asked if the teachers were in a position to come forward and make their com plaints—(no)—«adif ho complaints were made it was no argument that there were no complaints. If tie teachers could come forward they would put a different aspect on things. Thepeooniary position of teachers was wone now than under the old Kvetem, by which they wen allowed to carry outtheir own views'; bo! now they were bound and handicapped in «rery direction. By the education report it would be seen that they 'were not in the position ware entitled to as instznetors of the rumg generation, fine it appeared tint the teacher might be dismissed at any moment; he might be Beat from one place to another; he might be told by the ■■ Ommcfltf Education that he most remove from ■ the locality he had been for Many years,and go to aome otherjdttoa. In certain eases he-obaM ' be diafhiswfd without investigation. Was any other officer placed in a «imi)ar posi tion? If theie was a- charge against' a teacher, why should 4bere not be an ■inrotigatib?? JjA .his guilt be proved before be, was condemned. All the teacher's aetwra were subjected to tte ConrieU of Edu cation; he was not allowed to have an evening .school without their sanction. When he inten ded to open an evening «cbool he had to apply to the Council of Kdncation, and had to ask jpemoasion to charge for lessons, and the Council ifixedtbe amount he was to'eharge. 'Heeonten jded that the teachers should be allowed to name ftheir prices, for this extra work. Further, a teacher was1 not allowed to keep boarders. If the Council re&med; permission he could not fceep hnerdmi. What right had the Council to interfere in that way? The interference was jcarried to too great anertenfc. He would go Into this subject fully at another time, bnt he was jconvinced that the Minister of Education was not: ■thejnanto carry oat an enlightened system of .education. He had .heard statements made recently as to out educational progress which (were mjatepreeentatjoas. He did not aay tiiey jwene intentional,' but fmany of them were pnejely delusions. He would ask what results IfcheSloeation Act had produced? At the end of ISli the number of stihools in South Aus tralia 'was 320, at the end of Norombat, 1876, there-were only S6B, and at the end of 1874 the ■ putnber had decreased to 2*7. What was the reason of thi« V When-we spent handrodsof thonsands in education, when Pazliament was ready to vote more if properly applied, how was ' it that Ac number of schools was decreasing? At tiie end of 1674 the number of head teaoten ferae 313; in 187$ it had decreased to 267, and at theend of 1876 to 252. There was a decrease 1 also -in .the number of children educated. At i the end of ISlA&tert;, wen 24£85, while at the £nda£l«76 Mr. HANNAPOEDaskedif the hon. member fras in order. ; TfaeftPEAno?? requested the haa.member to confine himself to the notion. : Mr.BASEDOWsaidhuobjeetwastoshowtiutt public education had not made such progress as ftshooia havemade. . The SPKAKSK aaid4hat was not the ques tion before the House. ; Mr. BASBI>OW said hederind to show that this was due to the manngpirwrnt of the gentle man ettbe bead of die department, that with a Pariiamert (ready to vote any sum necessary With an enlightened public ready to have their childrenfetrueted, he did not see why thaw should not be better results. When they were told a?t«atof SSjOOQchadrenof a schoofgoioff ate only 25,600 were attending J« regrrttef ' that the money had been squandered in the way i* was, if bo ether iwolte eoold be obtained. With regard to schoolbonses, it might be Mid that the Council of Education bad built 49 schoolhouses throughout the eotanx, but when £160,000 was voted for building scbool hou?es, it was no credit to the Minister of Bdu cation. They could be built under the Com missioner of Public Works just as well. The Minister of Education ought to understand (be education system, should have an insight into tte way tie schools were conducted,not merely building school hon wen. He did not intend «ar thingpereonaltoaieMinUtay, batbedidm* think they were the right men in the right plaea, that the time bad come for a rimy and wife Goverwnen^ and that if an able Ministry were put in, their policy could be diammaed in a tangible form in which form this. Government could not submit a policy. Mr. JOHNSOtf said bavins ***& the two heavyweights of the House be might my be had never heard each a stale, flat, and unpro fitable bill of indictment. The late Sir Richard Hanson on a no-confidence motion was asensed of having been flat, stale, and unprofitable, and he said, "How could I be otherwise when I Tmew that there were 25 against me"—(laughter) and the mover of that motion was in theaame position. (No, and laughter.) The best things in his charge they bad often heard before, putting Mr. Ward and Mr. Boss against each other. The same thing could be said of the last Ministry. Mr. Mann said a good deal that was not very complimentary when on a diffaren side of the House to Mr. Boucant. If what one man had once eaid against another was to b« a reason for his not joining another in a Miaistry no Ministry could ever be formed. The point was, what had the country to get by a change of Mini?tryat the pT?Kattime? Thomwtbenin that House of coarse were too high-minded and patriotic to turn the Ministry oat except on , some great principle—H?pn«? B JM_.i?jHi^g T _MiJ pence went for nothing. (Laughter.) Sup posing the present Ministry wen ousted there were at least ten members who thought they bad a chance, and as there were only &vt;> in that House who could go in, it raally meant that five would be disappointed. These fire would go into opposition as soon as the new Government mi fanned, and it woald be literally as weak as water. They would not have a majority and could not stand a day. It was known throughout the city *&?* there wane seven members who wanted to get in. (Mr. Playford—" Untrue.") History would prove if he was untrue. (Mr. Playf ord—" Yes, and that the Ministry will be beaten.") What would the country gain by a «nange ? Four additional scheme* of taxation which the country did not want. The late <3overa ment proposed four schemes of taxation which the present Government did without. Mr. Playford said tile Government had taken the worst portions of the last Government policy, and had rejected the best. He denied that there was any demand in the country for additional taxation. They might gain by a new Ministry another white elephant—an outer harbor—to keep company with the one crossing the Murray. (Laughter.) They aught have a few light weights, such as Bishop Bugniaa and 50,000 Banians. (Laughter.) The charges which had been made were as weak as they well could be. He had generally listened to Mr. Flayford with pleasure, but he bad never heard him so fiat as he was that day. Mr. BOUCAJJT thought after the accusation made by the hon. member for Bast Tsczena, the Government should have made some reply. {The Commiarioner of Public Works—" Not worth it.") He had not had the advantage of bearing the speech, but from his knowledge of the hon. member* abilities he did not tnink the occupants of the Ministerial benches were justified in saying the speech was not worthy of an answer from the Minister of the Crown. That statement would not have any credit in the Houseor the country. ( Hear, bear; 0h,0i1.) In ability or standing the hon. member for East Torrens woald not compare unfavorably with any in the Ministry, so one of fclieni might hare replied, even if it had been only the Attorney-General. (Laughter.) He had brought with him copies of the Farmer* Metsotyo; the Methodist Journal, and the ! Premier's speech at Willunga. (Laughter.) , He had not the advantage of knowing what had i been said, bat there wore so many things to be I eaid with reference to that Ministry that it ! would be difficult for any one speaking on the : subject dos to say a great deal which would be damaging to the administration of the Govern ment. The Minister of Agriculture and Kduca ■ tion had advocated party government, *ad said, " I will teach you." (the Minister of Agricul ture and Education—" I never said that") The hon. member's speeches were saturated with the sentiment he had just enunciated. He con gratulated the Government on - having Mr. Blyth in their party. Did the boa. member when censuring him for not currying oat proper patty Government say that he was now ftWminwfoating party Government with the pre sent Ministry, which was a mass of incongruous atoms, and had nothing in romnwm between them. There was notttiag in common between the Minister of Agriculture and Education and Sir Henry Ayera, and was there any sympathy between the Minister and the Treasurer? (The Treasurer—"Yea"; laughter.) The apology given by tte hon. immbw at Bdi£hbuigh was that he recalled the words used at Gumeracha in a political but not in a private sense. That made the matter wone,and if any can demanded severe personal denunciation it was . that. He had personally Jwen bitterly attacked both in and out of session, and statements were made which wereconfeary to fact. .(Hear, hear; "Showthem.") The Oommi?uoner of Public Works *?*r* t????i^fif refnted one of the fHfTflrff. that he \\}"^ granted leases to souattaix. He would reminS the House that when the last no- confidence motion was debated, suggestions , had been made against the qtynpante of the j Treasurytancbee—whbhhe honed would not be repeated—by the Premier, who seemed to be of * religions turn of mind. It Ul became the head of the Government to be in unity with the Minister of Agriculture and Kdncatiori Sir Henry Ayers had done him great injustice in attacking him with regard to his own dis trict when he was ?w?y, and he now took the only opportunity Be had jpf replying to him. Sir Henry Ayers had said the Victor Harbor breakwater was lost by the intrigues between him and Mr. Morgan. His denied that, and as soon es he returned to the colony, he ob tained letters which proved it to be Abso lutely untrue. Mr. Main, who was interested in the work, waited on the Premier, and in the conversation the Premier scouted the idea of patting £35,000 an the Estimates after, the £100;000 had been lost. H*> would eal! fiiair attention to an extract from .the Methoditt Journal, one of the Ministerial Atgans. (Oh, -o h; laughter) Toe two Ministerial organs were that paper and *he termers' Messe*ytr, while all tbfi other papers opposed the Govern ment. ("Becan?e they axe not' In pur cong dence.") That meant tiieo, 4Jiat those tiro capers wore in their confidence. {Laughter.) The Library Committee had prohibited the Far mer? Messenger from being within the precincts of that House. The extract was, "We see Mr. Kay has given notice 'of ''motion requiring the production of the correapnndftcop anent the ap pointment of the new magistrates. That toe Government had comnrltted a serious blunder the best friends of tiie Ministry must admit. < Nevertheless, Mr Wbite, far receiving a con sideration not to bid, was no wane than the honored and honorable member of the T-"gislt> tive Council who gave the consideration.

He dunged the Go vernment with the reappoinbnent of Mr. James White to the toH of magistrates. The 'suggestion of comparing Mr. White to Mr. .Hay was entirely unwarranted, as Mr. Hay gave no consideration. (Mr, Whitej—"Twenty pounds. Ton had the consideration.")

As to Sir Henry Ayers, his whole: political career was, he argued, made op of in consistencies ; he had accepted a knighthood for; services he had Aever rendered; had broken, every pledge he had made, and he had simply > been all things to all men, without the Apostle's ability. He was merely 'file instrument of the dominant party of the ttme. - (laughter and' cheers.) The Ministry had simply i>een the: medium to fcass certain measures, aud now ttieir; mission was ended.

He was glad that the question of. the ap- . pointment of Justices of the Peace had -' been brought forward, as be did not' think ihe action of the Government the proper ■ action. He should like to hear something of ' the policy of those who proposed to take the places of the Government, ana in giving his vote should be guided -by a desire to study the interests of the country. He thought the Govern ment should be- annihilated as politicians for sanctioning three railway gauges, but the House generally was as. bad as the Government, foe they had agreed to'the same tiling. He condemned the Government also for the reck less system of immigration which. they had carried out. Thirdly, ne said the Government had neglected to 'give accommodation for a larger class of ocean steamer?, beyond an abortive attempt to remove the outer bar, which -would never be removed in that way. Then the Governmenthadernmeixi?lyendeavoredtoobtain a railway revenae., by. higii rates on all lines. He-sympatJiLied inch ajgood deal that had been said by Mr. Bees with regard to the Bishop Bugnion scheme. Nearly every Ministry that had ever been formed had been comparatively im becile. Nearly every Ministry seemed to be strong while in Opposition, but they appeared to lose all their power directly they got on the Treasury benches. Tfie tinders tori railway waggons had been mentioned, and if what was said was true it was accuse-of -gross- mtemansflement.
