AN APPARITION. The public of Vienna have been much troubled by the story of an apparition which has lately occupied the newspaper of tho Austrian Capital. A sentry, posted by night in the lobbies of the Imperial Palace, observed to his dismay a female figure, enveloped in the long folds of a capacious cloak, emerge from the chambers of the late Archduchess Sophia. The alarmed soldier at once saved himself from intercourse with the ghost by flight, and told his story to his superior officer. "Without putting faith in his narrative, the Marshal of thc Court established a watch, and caused the lobbies communicating with the room of the mother of the Emperor to be occupied by the palace guards. Next night tho mysterious vision wai again see» y several persons,' but vanished almost instantly Another night the phantom showed itself to a second sentry, who fainted with terror. Some days Inter a.no(T sentry saw the Bpcctro appronch, but moro bold than his companions, maintained his sang froid, and aimed ii blow at it with bis bayonet. Tho spectre thereupon took to flight, hut, pursued by the soldier, fell mor- tally wounded hy » bayonet thrust in tho back. Tho guards and attendants hastened to the spot on hearing tho cries of tho wounded ghoBt, and found a beardless youth, who was recognised ns a priest. Tho strangest part of tho business is that the conrt has done its utmost to hush tho matter up : and the soldier whoso bayonet led to tho discovery of the mystery bas been rouoved from his'sentry duties, and sent, as was said, to l'oin a distant garrison. The Tagblatt, bowovor, says he has been pat in a prison, and ia now in soli- tary confinement. The clerical papers deny that tho ghost was a priest; but, on the ether hand, it is alleged that bo was one of the young chaplains at- tached to tho palaco, and'a tool of tho Jesuits.
