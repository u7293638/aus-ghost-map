'You missed your opportunity ; and now that she has had too much liberty, Bhe naturally objects at first to restric tions. That means nothing.' I thought differently. It was a chill foggy November morning when I reached the 'Tollington Arms.' The entire landscape lay buried under the the thick grey, a blurred shaplees mass mingling with the misty grey clouds. Sometimes a tree appeared on the scene, very muoh resembling a ghost peering out beyond its shroud. It was a disagreeable pioture, and I engerly hurried to the com fort of the great blazing fire in the coffee room. Over my breakfast I inquired about the' locality of Tollington Hall. The inquiry considerably raised me in the eyes of the waiter. ' - ',.;? :.. Tollington Hall was exactly a quarter of an hour's walk from the village. It waa very merry just then ; there was a host of visitors ; the hunt was brilliant. _ Yes,-, he. believed that . there' was a meet that very day. , Was Lady Riversdale staying there A ? Oh, yes; the young Countess had by this quiet recovered the shock of the late Earl's death. Dreadful .murder, that, . air. And folks said it was quite a hacctdont. Hireland, he believed him self, was a dangerous, savage sort of place to live in. Folks could never rightly tell whether they were in for being shot or hot. Supposed it ran in the blood of the raoo, though certainly the late Lord Riversdale was as pleasant a man as you could ask to meet, and there was no one more generally admired than the young Hiriah lady staying at present at the Hall. A great heiress,' sir, and they say she' is ip married to Viscount Egerton, Lady Riveradale's brother. I had some difficulty in restaining my self from starting visibly. But I was pretty successful in an indifferent 'in- deed 1' and asked for the morning paper. Of course, I did not believed 4hat,,^finna had actually given cauBe1 .fbr'^he' repprt^ which I guessed to be jas. accurate as local gossip usually is,.bu6,' rievertholess, I felt, a little angry. ?
