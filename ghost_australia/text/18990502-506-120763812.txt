A New Magazine. ' SPLASHES.' Tho literary history of Sydney is going to bo written somo day when the man with tho power comes along. The iiiosd interesting chapters of the lob will bo connected with the starting of new papers. Hardly one of us bub has boon mixed up with several of them. The very mention of tho sub ject raises a row of ghosts along the roadside of the past, where the literary ventures aro buried, aud whab tragedies aro involved in some of them .' Ah mo ! Hero is another — ' Splashes.' It is a threepenny illuabrated monbhly magazine. Ib is the healthiest, hearfciesb, liveliest, cleanest-, likeliest looking literary babe that has come to bhe birth in Sydney for many years. Ib is printed on good paper, and well printed, too, even though ib was nob printed by Wm. Brooks and Co. Ib is admirably illustrated, and bho baby on the front pago ' Tho Newcomer,' is simply splendid. The literary matter is sharp, snappy, healthy and bright. Tho editor has not only brains enough to write, bub he's gob sense enough to make up his paper in an interesting way. Taking ib for all in all, ib is the most promis ing babe thab Sydney has seen fora long time. I object to its name, becauso it's better than that, but even ' Splashes ' is better than some of the splashes we've had in Sydney. We wish tho now venture all the success it deserves. The proprietor is George Wride, jor., Vickery's Chambers, 76 Pib'b-street, and the annual subscription is 3s ; beyond the colony 4s 6d. The motto of the paper is — ' Fear God, speak evil of none, Stick to tho truth and never be done.'
