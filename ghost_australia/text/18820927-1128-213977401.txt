NORTHAMPTON NOTES. I omitted in my last budget to report a veiy serious accident to Mr. William Harrison, of this town, and which was nearly proving fa tal. It appears that early on Monday morn ing last, Harrison mounted a restive, and only half- broken-in mare, belonging to Mr. C. Unpps, tor tbe purpose of giving ber a trial. iln noolrinrv Has 4no moro eonrvia/l hn sviiv a+ unviktug uvij LUV/ mmv KV VV enough, but suddenly, without the least inti mation . of what she was going to do, she reared up on her hind legs with such rapidi ty as to lose her equilibrium, and consequent ly fell backwards, the unfortunate rider being right under her, with the whole of her weight (she is a good sized mare) resting upon him. The manoeuvre was so quickly executed by the mare that poor Harrison hadn't the ghost of a chance to get clear of the saddle, and it is a miracle he was not crushed to death. Charley Cripps and others were soon on tbe scene of the accident and managed to convey the unfortunate man into his own house, where he has been lying in bed suffering ex cruciating pain ever since the unfortunate af fair happened. He has completely lost tbe use of his legs, aud up to date there doe&n;'t appear to be any improvement. Sport commences next week with the race between Oxenham's Ben Bolt, a veiy plncky little horse with plenty of stay in him too, and Mahon's Queen. The Black Diamonds will keep the sport going in the evening at the Working Men's Hall, and a ball at the Bailway Hotel will wind up the days pro ceedings. On the following-Saturday, our annual shear ing match comes off. Since last Saturday the weather has been tolerably warm with, an occasional light Bhower. Sept 22, 1882.
