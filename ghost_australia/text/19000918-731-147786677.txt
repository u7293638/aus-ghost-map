THE OPENING SERMON. The published report of Archbishop Red wood's sermon at the dedication of St. Mary's R. 0. Cathedral, Sydney, led to the insertion of the following letter in the S. M. Herald : — Sir,— At a meeting of the Evangelical Council held to- day, the following resolu tions were adopted, and direoted to be sent to you for publication, viz. : — 1\. That this counoil notes that at the opening of St. Mary's Roman Catholio Cathedral on Sunday last, bis Excellency the Governor attended in his offioial oapacity as representative of her Majesty tbe Queen, and was accompanied by their Excellencies the Governors of Queensland and New Guinea, who also attended in offioial costume and style. The counoil also notes that .his Worship tbe Mayor and other official' personages are also reported to have been present in their official capacities. 2\. That on that oocasion, and in presence of his Excellency, the appointed preaoher (Dr. Redwood) is reported to :have said : — ' The leaders and founders of Protestantism, Luther, Calvin, Zwinglius, &c.;, were notorious for their vices.' ? ? ? ' Pro testantism oovered Europe with blood and ruins in tbe sixteenth century, 'and has ever sinoe been the helper and instrument of the worst foes of Christianity. It dese orated the home, it polluted the nuptial bed, j it iowerad the dicrnitv nf wnnrnnJinnil. if. devastated the school, and stopped the pro gress of science.' . . . ' In fine, neither Protestants nor Greek sohismatics have shown that tbe action of the Ghost is with them. Their n^inisters haye no lawful mission, and tbey oannot say that they have been sent by Jesus Obrist,'' . , . ' Have they (the Protestant denomina tions) any of the marks of the trqe Church unity, sanetity, catholicity, and apqstolioity ? Surely not.'' 8\. The council notes that, so far as is reported, these words were listened to with out protest by her Majesty's representatives. It regards these statements as a direot calumny on her Majesty as the most illus trious member of the Anglican Ohurcb, to which the preacher speoially referred, and on all her subjects of the Protestant faith ; and in listening to them without protest his Exocllency and the other publio officials presentwere made to appear to be parties to an attack upon the faith held by ber Majesty and an overwhelming majority of her Eng- - lish-speaking subjects. 4\. The council also regards the statements made with reference to the pollution of the ] nuptial bed and the deseoration of the home as' an implication of personal immorality, on the part of members : qf the Protestant - communions. Th e oou noil /therefore, feels i strongly that by his.' action on tbe occasion his Exoellenoy permitted and was made to appear to ; sanction an aot of dishononr to her Majesty and her coreli gionists in these fealnjs ; and therefore de sires id express in the igost public way its disapproval and reprobation of the sarpe. 5\. Tbe council 'would also point ont that by her Majesty's oath her Majesty's attend ance at the Mass i$ precluded,- and it is, tbereforp, a matter of surprise that ber representative in IJew South Wales should have done that wliioh her Majesty herself is by oath is disallowed from doing. - W. M. Dill-Maokt, President. E.Paioa )Hoa, F. OolweuJ Sees. September 13. A representative Of the Press subsequently interviewed Archbishop Redwood as' to his statements regarding Protestants- and the Protestant religion, referred to in the ktter signed by the President and Secretaries of the Evangelioal Council, .and .reported in , certain papers as having formed part of tjie sermon preached in St. Mary's Oathdral lsar, Sunday.
