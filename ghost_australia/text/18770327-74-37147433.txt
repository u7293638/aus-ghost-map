Our Emu Bay correspondent states that he has been shown by Captain Patterson some fine samples of tin ore stated to have been found by the Meredith party at the Pieman River, or near it. We have obtained some further par- ticulars about the discovery of tin ore in the vicinity of Avoca, mentioned in our last issue. The locality is only a few miles from Avoca, in streams flowing off the end of Ben Lomond into the northern side of the South Esk river, and though the prospects at present obtained only give, we are informed a few ounces to the dish, it is genuine ruby tin ore, simi- lar to;= that obtained in the George's Bay district, and further investigation may lead to the discovery of payable deposits. Several sections have already been taken up, and preparations are being made by several parties for prospecting opera- tions. THE LATE BURNING CASE AT PERTH.— We regret having to announce the death of Mrs Pearson, whose accident by burn- ing was alluded to in our last. The re- port of the inquest, appears elsewhere. By a typographical error the occurrence was mentioned as a "suspicious" instead a of "serious" case of burning.
