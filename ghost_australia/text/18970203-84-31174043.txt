* The Federal Oampaign. Mr Reid's federal address has startled h:s supporters. He staris-" Clo'er study has only increased my antagonism to the main provisions of the 1891 Constitution." Mr Reid has written an able article for the Review of Reviews. Re excusea his former antagoni-m to federation on the plea that he could not abandon the impending fiscal betble. He looks forward to the Con vention in March with confidence. Mr Carruthers says the Ministry informed Sir Henry Parkes, a few months before his death, that they wished him to be president of the Conven-ion. Mr Carruthers was to have worked Sir Heniry's candidature, so te says. Jony is trying to win his own election by riding Sir Henry's ghost. Mr Barton compared the "prudent feder ationist" wilth a man with a gouty leg who c lled. himself a "prudent pedestrian." SMr B R. Wise is lecturing on " Union or Uni~y 7" The distinction is too fine for the public to worry over just now. Which will cost the least, is the point. Barton, O'Connor, and MsfcMillan have shown the best grip of the question so far. Reid is f. irly muddled. .The ang-r has increased in labor circles over the selection of the federal bunch. No one but rampant socialists are elected, while the absence of any country member is worse still. The labour candidates are doomed before they "are nominated. Mr Lyne has not yet decided whether he will. be a candidate or not. The big guns are all belching forth now, some in the city and some in the country. Mr Forsyth reports that Victoria is very eager for federat'on-more so than this colony. Since the Reid tariff the business men don't care so much, but the gre.tr mn-t of the pie.ple are just as keen for unity aq ever.
