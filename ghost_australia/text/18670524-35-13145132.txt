THE HABITS OF BUFFALO GHOSTS. THE Buffalo (New "York) Express contains the following extra ordinary communication - " I have reasons for not signing my name to the following statement, and for withholding it from every person living, although I can pledge the word of an honest man that every word I am now about to relate is, as far as I am capable of judging, as true as truth itself " On the night of Christmas eve, then, as I was returning home after attending Divine service in a certain church in this city, on nearing my residence I became suddenly aware that a stranger was walking close behind me, and keeping step with me in a man ner which I considered to be somewhat familiar and offensive influenced by the sacredness of the place I had just left, feeling that I should soon be relieved of such undesirable company, I said nothing, but hurried my pace until I reached the steps leading to my own door At this point I halted for a moment with the intention of scrutinising the stranger more closely as he passed, when I became sensible at once, that although it was snowing rather fast, from the time I became cognisant of the strangers proximity up to the time that I reached home none of the snow fell upon either side of us, but seemed to have been repelled about two feet all round from each of us, we both as it were, walking in a sort of vacuum Although I saw this palpably at the same time of its occurrence, and was quite aware that not a particle of snow touched either of us while we were together, yet strange to say, it never struck me as being singular until I had mounted the steps and found the flakes falling on me once more At this juncture I became very much alarmed, and the more so from the fact, when I turned round on the upper step of the flight, to endeavour to get a peep at the stranger's face, he was gone He had disappeared with the velocity of light, and under circumstances the most incomprehensible, leaving a strange impression that I had seen him before, but as to when or where I was totally unable to determine ' Completely astonished at an adventure so strange I entered my residence, where to my surprise I found an old friend seated in my study beside a cheerful coal fire that burned in the grate, and whom I had not seen for years, although I was in the habit of constantly corresponding with him "We were mutually delighted at the meeting, and I was happy at making him at home in my bachelor s quarters. have passed into the sere and yellow leaf without having been fortunate enough to make a favourable impression upon any one of the fair sex A the novelty of my position, and the gratification it afforded me, all remembrance of my adventure in the street was completely lost sight of, and I addressed myself to conversation and the meagre hospitalities that I could offer him at so late an hour of the night-my housekeeper having gone to bed " After supper and a single glass of ale each, we retired to our respective apartments, to renew our conversation at breakfast and spend a happy Christmas day together Somehow or other I did not sleep very well, but as I am rather abstemious, and quite an used to late suppers, I fancied that my restlessness was occasioned by even the single glass of ale and the few months I had eaten As the day began to dawn, however, I sank into a deep refreshing slumber, from which I was aroused about eight o'clock by the well known voice of my aged domestic announcing the breakfast ready I was soon up and dressed, and as was always my wont, passed into my study before going down stairs " Here, to my utter surprise, I perceived standing, on the table at which my friend and I had supped two glasses-one empty and the other filled with ale beside a plate, the contents of which appeared not to have been touched I was astonished and confused beyond measure at this, for, before retiring to rest I had locked a door leading out into the had at the head of the stairs, which effectually cut off both my study and my bedroom from all intrusion Unable to account for this strange condition of the table, I instantly hastened to the apartment of my friend, and knocked at the door Receiving no reply, I entered the room, when, lo and behold it was empty, while his bed bore all the evidence of its not having been slept in the night previously I ran down stairs in great con- sternation, and learned from my housekeeper that she? had not made up any beds that morning, and that not a soul had left or entered the house that morning "Utterly bewildered, I was about to make some inquiries when my attention was arrested by a knock at the hall door It was the postman He handed me a letter I opened it and sank into a chair It contained the announcement of my friends death, which had occurred at Washington a few days previous After having perused the sad contents, the recollection of my strange adv nature in the street rushed in with great force and distinctness upon my memory while my subsequent experience in my study absolutely, for the time being paralysed all my reasoning faculties, although I am far from being a stranger to mysterious sights and sounds, in the reality of which I never believed, nor do I fully yet but what conclusion can I am e at in this instance 5 As may be presumed the subject has been present with me ever since, and I no i give it to the public in the hope that some explanation my be offered in. connection with it rather than from any desire to make it no torious IVY adroitly rou DILM HHDS recent publication is excites attention to the sad effects of the vice of confirmed intemperance, which is so common at the present day and to the question of asylums for drunkards In other countries partial success only has attended the efforts to overcome the many difficulties that surround the matter of the suppression of drunkenness, or the management of those over whom it has asserted a permanent mastery for so many unpleasant considerations in which family relationships or friendly intercourse are concerned tend to engender silence, and bar the discussion of what is classed, conveniently in the category of ' unpleasant subjects The majority of men, however, are unable to resist the conviction that the evil is in great degree a self produced one and as the truth is dis- tasteful, it is natural that we seek for an explanation which plays the role of an excuse, and is calculated to secure a lenient sentence for those whose individual responsibility is blamed Clearly the mode of cure of drunkenness, at once, in itself, both efficient and easy of application is to cut off the supplies of the dim] cr but this involves distinct interference with the ' liberty of the subject, which the physician shrinks from recommending, and the public are not disposed to justify without very cogent reason the necessity, however, for special legislation in the matter is urgent, freely acknowledged on all hands and will no doubt by and by break through the thick crust of our many prejudices, and allow common sense and considerations of policy to exert their due influence Meanwhile it is the duty of the medical practitioners to facilitate legislation by determining accurately the nature of that habit to which psycho- logists give the terms ' monomania, " dipsomaniac," ' polydipsia, and which include cases of so called uncontrollable drunkenness Is it a crime, or the result of a diseased state of brain, of a passion for intoxicating, which is the chief symptom of a brain alteration, and which no will can therefore resist, but which conquers sense and intellect ' Charity may be allowed to assert the existence of the latter condition, but practical experience teaches us that uncontrolled is a more just expression than that of uncontrollable drunkenness-that this is not caused by disease, but is the effect of a habit which had us little beginnings that were left unchecked, and that cannot be held to have diminished the responsibility of the individual in whom it is exhibited the existence in the drunkard of a powerless desire to break away from the thraldom of a confirmed habit is no reason why we should make an excuse for him it is of his own election a violation of moral obligations to one's self and society involves its penalty in the case in point, as in other cognate instances-a penalty which finds one or its worse punishments in the haunting crave for the liquor which becomes the habitual drunkard s curse, and is the only remedy he finds against the " blue devils of his own producing It is an unhealthy sense that classes, with no little tinge of poetry, the sufferings of the drunkard with those of the self de ing martyr Public sanatoria or asylums for the confirmed inebriate are by all means desirable, but they should be under the strictest surveillance Private establishments would be open to great abuse, in which the element of commercial speculation might play a very prominent part. The drunkard is a criminal, and he should be deprived of" that, the possession of which renders him a positive source of evil to himself and society-his liberty In the regime under which he would be placed there need be nothing harsh, but it would be most pernicious in practice and wrong in. philosophy, if the drunkard could make for himself a voluntary arrangement to enter when he liked and to quit when pleases, es has been suggested -Lancet lrxiAMSM IN SCOTLAND ARREST or Six MEN. -It has been for some time been well known to the authorities in the West of Scotland that three American Fenians, deputies from New York (one of them said to be an ex-officer of the United States army), have been actively engaged in the Glasgow district, collecting subscriptions, holding secret meetings, and appointing sub head centres, so that there is not a, village in the mining districts wherein a large portion of the Irish population do not sympathise with and contribute freely to the cause of Fenianism in Ireland One of these agents is, understood to have been, for the last two or three weeks, exceedingly active in the Coatbridge districts there, are also in Parkhead, Caron, Calder, Holy town, and other places, secret meetings were held during the past week relative to future operations Under such circumstances, considerable uneasiness naturally prevails throughout the neighbourhood of Coatbridge among the respectable portion of the community. The various volunteers have removed their rides &c;, from the armouries, while the police keep a sharp look out for any indications of a disturbance Nothing has baffled the authorities more than the secrecy with which the meetings have been called, business transacted, and drill carried on It is known that for fully two years drill has been vigorously proceeded with in various localities , but up to Sunday morning not an instance has been brought under the notice of the authorities On that day a body of twenty five or thirty Fenians were surprised while drilling on the Glasgow and Edinburgh turnpike road, between the villages of Holytown and Mossend Sergeant M Naughten, of the county constabulary at Bell hill accompanied by two officers, named Urquhart and Murray, were on duty in the village of Mossend , but that locality being unusually quiet for a " pay night, they were extending their patrolling towards Holytown While proceeding in that direction they were somewhat astonished to hear sharp, regular, military steps approaching Stepping aside, the officers went into ambush, and waited the arrival of the " Irish troops, as the sergeant at once suspected them to be the leader, apparently fearing to lead his men past any of the inhabited houses, cried "Halt, front," about twenty yards from where the officers were concealed, and the "commander" congratulating them upon their appearance, dismissed them The police, seeing the turn affairs had taken, at once darted from their hiding-place and station- ing themselves across the road, so as to intercept the advancing mob, the sergeant desired them to " stand ' No sooner had the " patriots ' recovered from the alarm caused by the sudden appearance of the officers than they scattered like sheep, and fled towards Mossend Noth withstanding the large odds in the numbers, the officers followed Arriving at Mossend. Store they made six of the " brotherhood " prisoners The captives gave their names as Hugh Murphy Lawrence Finnigan, John Brogan, Thomas O'Hare, Peter Cormagen, and Francis M'Cabe, all residing in Mossend, and, as their names sufficiently indicate, all Irishmen the commander, who is alleged to be a stranger, effected his escape North British Daily Mail CONFESSION or K MURDER -A singular case of confession of murder has occurred at the Tipperary assize where a men, named Ryan, gave himself up to justice for a crime committed in 1832 A certain amount of corroboration for Ryan's confession was found in the evidence of the widow of the murdered man, who still survives.
