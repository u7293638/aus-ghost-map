EYonr time to time 1 felt that fatal sleep, tho sleep of dnath, overpowerinB nm. But I got up, and shak ing rnysnif, 1 pushed on. My limbs, weary with their day's long march, were getting benuniiied ; the snow, inliltrating itself into my long boots, render ed my walking more n«d mom difficult- Sud Meiily I sioi-i«I ; there were, there on my right, black and ghastly silhouettes, coming out on tlm snow like hideous phantom*. Tuny uere. uhlans scouting llm country. ( heard thfir ' ir«r dn V rep»ated from one to anoth er, mid which the wind carried duck ' to urn in that appalling silence. I lay down, nnd crouching on the snow, I waited till they were, out of sight. Once or twics, my cour agH failing me, I was on the point of beckon ing to them, of shouting to them that within thniri-each thtiro was an easy prey, incapable of dofendint; itself. But a struggle, took place within nn-. 'Sliull I go further? Is there not a limit duty ! Why go out Is there not, close by, lire, food, shelter, and Itfol But although instinct said ' Yen,' a stronger voice replied : 1 Duty.' ^.r * A.ud gathering* the little, strength left me. 1 cot up and flushed on. I was gradually fet-ldig mnru and more stupitied with cold, with taii^ue, with sleep, and the sufferings of hunger were' getting terrible. , My liuilu refused to carry me any farther, my legs were stiff, my hands cut and bleeding. I had been obliged to unloos* my brlt, and lrntve my trusty sword behind nm. The wind was get ting colder as llm night advanced, «ud the snoWof heaven and the snow of the earth, mixed into ore' mighty whirlwind, were liliijdini; me completely. On I went ; a voice still, though feebly, repeating : ' You must join your general ; duty iu lli«re !' * * j Uut btift' hruisud, and fnint, I could con tinue no lunger. I made a last eHort, but it was unavailing. I slid down utterly exhaus ted at the foot of a firtree. Sleep instantly overpowered me. I sank into a profound slumber. How long I remained iu this dead ly sleap, I cannot tell. When I woke up, I was walking along a road ; there were 6 res buring dimly in the distance, and a low rum bling, jike a bee-hive iu motion. I could hear close by me tlto tramp of soldiers. It was daylight. A strong arm was linked into mine, supporting my tottering steps. Then a'voice spake : ' You are all right now, and with friends.' ' Who are you f Where am 1 1' I inquired. ' Sergeant of thu 3rd Zouaves, 1st Brigade, 2nd Division,' answered the Mian proudly. ' And you are near Poutarlier. Yonder tires are those of our men.' ? He then explained that, living sent with his company on outpost duties, he had come across mo ; and seeing that life was not ex tinct, he and a companion hud rubbed nir with snow and brandy till I had revived. ' You gave us no end of trouble*' added ill* biave fellow. ' But I knew you would come back. Those who have fou;ht as you did at VillursHxel, oupht not to die miser ably in the snow.' - There is little inor« to be said. Til* army of the Eust, to which I belonged, had in its disordered and mistirahlts state no oth«r re source than to take refuge in Switzerland, every one, of course, laying down his anus, and trusting to the. hospitality of stranger*. About eighty thoumind men passed over tin frontier at Vtrrieres. With a small party, 1 was left to cover 'he retr.-ut, and it was with difficulty w« escaped thu enemy which hung on the rear. After wandering for a whule day and two nights in dorp suew, fol lowing uncertain trucks, without guides, with out food,- and I may say without shoes, we crossed the frontier on thy 3rd February, 1871. Whnt & relief from recent sufferings ! How thankful I was to n'nd the means of rest, the lirst night, I laydown at Orhe, my bed being a bun; table, uiy l-oot» without Solon, and my sicks without feet ! But how intensely I -|ept, not withstanding these discomforts! Etorywhere, the remnants of the French fcrce were treated by tho Sjgjss with a degree of kind consideration whj^Hs remembered uitli gratitude.
