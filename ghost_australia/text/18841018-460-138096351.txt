Your horse is Blue Grass. Good-night." . , , With these words ringing in her ears she began her journey. . The horse, as if eager to mnintain the reputation which his native district had given his race, as well as the race of the pretty woman behind him, lepped impatiently forward. But pulled together by the fine and firm fingers that seemed to guide rather than check his exuberance, be presently struck into the long swinging pace of his kind, and kept it throughout without " break or acceleration. Over the paved streets the light buggy rattled, and the slender shafts danced around his smooth barrel, bat when they touched the level high- road, horse and vehicle slipped forward through the ni^ht—a swift and noiseless phantom. Mrs. lacker coald see his graceful back dimly rising and falling before ner with tireless rhythm, and could feel the intelligent pressure of his mouth until it seemed the responsive grasp of a powerful but kindly hand. The faint glow of conquest came, to her cold cheek ; the alight stirring of pride moved her preoccupied heart. A soft light filled her hazel eyes. A desolate woman, bereft of husband and home, and flying through storm and night—she knew not where—she still leaned forward towards her horse. " Was he Blue Grass, then, dear old boy ?" she gently cooed at him in the darkness. He evidently »bom, and responded by blowing her an ostentatious equine kisa " And he would be good to his own forsaken Belle," she murmured caress ingly, "and wouldn't let anyone harm lier f But uere, overcome by the lazy witchery of her voice, he shook his head so violently that Mrs. Tucker, after the fashion of her sex, had the doable satisfaction of demurely restrain ing the passion she had evoked. To avoid the more travelled thoroughfare, while the evening was still early, it had been arranged that she should at first take a less direct but less frequented road. This was a famous pleasure drive from San Francisco—a gravelled and sanded stretch of eight miles to the sea and an ultimate " cocktail" in a "stately pleasure dome decreed " among the surf and rocks of the Pacific shore. It was deserted now, and left to the unobstructed sweep of the wind and rain. Mrs. Tucker would not have chosen this road. With the instinctive jealousy of a bucolic inland race bora by great rivers, she did not like the sea; and again thedim and dreary waste tended to recall the vision connected with her husband's flight, upon which she had resolutely shut her eyes. But when die had reached it the road suddenly turned, following the trend of the beach, and she was exposed to the full power of its dread fascinations. The combined roar of sea and shore was in her ears: as the direct force of the gale had compelled her to furl the protecting hood of toe baggy, to keep the light vehicle from oversetting or drifting to leeward, she could no longer shut out the heaving chaos cm toe right from which toe pallid ghosts of dead and dying breakers dimly rose and sank as if inawful salutation. At times through the darkness a white sheet appeared spread before toe path and beneath the wheels of the buggy, which, when with drawn with a reluctant hiss, seemed striving to drag the exhausted beach seaward with it. Bat toe blind terror, of her horse, who Bwerved at every sweep of toe surge, shamed her own half-superstitions fears, and with the effort to control his atenn she regained her own self- possession—albeit with eyelashes1 wet not altogether with the salt spray from the sea. This was followed by a reaction, perhaps stimulated by her victory over the beaten animal, when for a time—toe knew not how long—she felt only a mad senBe of freedom and power, oblivious of even her sorrows, her lost home and husband, and with intense feminine consciousness she longed to be a man. She was Bcarody aware that the track turned again inland until the beat , of toe horse's hoofs on toe firm ground and an acceleration of speed showed Iter she had left the beach and the mysterious eea behind her, and she remembered that she was near toe end of toe first stage of her journey. Half an hour later the twinkling lights of the roadside inn where she was to change horses rose out of the darkness. Happily for her toe ostler considered the lvorae, who had a local reputation, of more importance than toe unknown muffled figure in the shadow of the unfurled hood, and con fined hia attention to the animal. Altera careful examination of hia feet and a few comments addressed solely to the superior creation, he led him away. Mrs. Tucker would have liked to part more affectionately from her four-footed compatriot, and felt a sudden sense of loneliness at the loss of her new friend, but the recollection of certain cautions of Ouptaln Poindexter's kept her mute. Nevertheless, toe ostler's ostentations, adjuration of "Now then, aren't you going to brine out that mustang for the Senora T* puzzled her. It was not until toe fresh horse was put to. and she had flung a piece of sold into toe attendant's hand, that the "Groans" of his unmistakable Saxon speech revealed to her the reason of the lawyer's ckution. Poindexter had evidently represented her to these people as a native Califonmn who did not speak English. In her inconsistency her blood took ure at this first suggestion of deeeit, and bumeddn her face. Whyshontd he try to pass her off as anybody else? Why should sue-not useber own—her husbands name ? She stopped and bit her lip It wM but toe begining of an uneasy train of thought She suddenly found herself thinking of her visitor,' Calhoun Weaver— and not pleasantly.

Her cramped limbs aching, she took advantage of the security of the darkness and the familiar contiguity of the fields to get down from the vehicle, gather her skirts together, and run at the head of. the mustang, until her chill blood was thawed, night drawing a modest veil over this charming revelation of the. nymph mid woman. J tut the sudden shadow of a coyote checked the scouring feet, of this swift: Camilla, and sent her back precipitately to the buggy. Nevertheless, she waa refreshed and able to pursue her journey, until the cold grey of early morning found her at the end of her second stage. Her route was changed again from the main highway, rendered dangerous by the approach of-day and the oontignity of the neighbouring rancheros., Theroadwas rough and hilly, her new horsesnd vehicle in keep ing with the rudeness ot the route—by-far Hie mc«t difficult^ her whole journey. . The rare waggon tracks that indicated herrood were often scarcely discernible; at times they led her through openings in the half-cleared woods, Blurted auspicious morasses, painfully climbedthe .smooth dome-likehills, oy wound! along perilous slopes at a dangerous angle.1 Twice she bad to alight and cling to the1 sliding wheels on one of those treacherous in clines, or drag them from impending ruts or immovable mire. In the growing light she could distinguish the distant low - lying marshes eaten by encroaching sloughs and insidious channels, and beyond them the' faint grey waste of the Lower Bay. A darker peninsula in the marsh she. knew to be the: extreme boundary of, her future home—the Rancho de los Cuervos. In another hour she began to descend to the plain, and to once: more approach the math roaa, which now! ran nearly parallel with her track. She scanned it cautiously for any early traveller; it stretched north and Boutb in apparent un ending solitude. She struck into it boldly, and urged her horse to the top of his speed,' until siie reached the cross road that led to the rancho. But here she pausedand allowed the reins to drop idly on the mustang's back. A singular and unaccountable irresolution seised her. The difficulties of her journey were over; the rancho lay nearly two miles away; she had achieved the most important part of her task in the appointed time, but she hesitated. What had slie come for? She trial to recall Poindexter'a words, even her own enthusiasm, but in vain. She. wag going to take possession of her husband's property,. she knew—that was all. But the means Hie had taken seemed nowso exaggerated and mysterious for that simple end that she began to dread in impending something or some vague danger she bad not considered that she was rushing blindly to meet. Full of this strange feeling, she almost mechani cally stopped her horse as Bhe entered the cross toad. From this momentary hesitation & singular sound arousedfher. It seemed at first like the swift hajrying by of some viewless courier of thq air, the vague alarm of some invisible fiyiug herald, or like the inarticulate cry that precedes a storm. It seemed to rise and fall aroutjd her as if with some changing urgency of ghrpose. Raising .her eyes she suddenly recognised the two fur-stretchir linesof telegraph wire above her-bend, an knew the. saptian cry of the morning win along its vibrating chords.
