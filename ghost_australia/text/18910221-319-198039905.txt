sailing notes. Br Sl'I.X.YAKER. Tbo open race of the St. Kilda Y.C. proved a very interesting event. A light and rather puffy north wind prevailed, and just at the finish came a sudden lull, followed by a stron" southerly gale. A course between St. Kilda, Port Melbourne and Williamatown was sailed, and the distance on paper was 10 miles, but as a matter of fact tbo boats necessarily hold a course at least half as long again.

The Galatea, owing to head winds, was late in making ber arrival, and did not start ; nor did Mary Dunster, Nopean nor Iiopetoun. Tbo remainder were sent away to a good start at 3.39, Cotio, Camilla, Ormonde and Sunbeam being the first -past the Pert, which acted as flagship. In tho first round Native and Meteor both re tired. The former carried away licr gaff, and the latter tiro lasbing3 of her mainsail. G'orio,_ Yarana, Sunbeam and Camilla stood right in to land near the baths after the start ing gun wa3 fired. Yarana, sailed by Jack Alice (who recently parted with the Galatea), and Commodore Krone, of the Brighton club, was , tho first round the South Mel bourne and Nelson buoys. Corio, sailed by her builder, lllunt, held second place, followed by Sunbeam, Native, Hyacinth and Camilla. Some of tbe \Vniiamstown boats were at a disadvantage in carrying no spinnakers, but the only boats that were in tbe race with them at all were Yarana and Camilla. The former held her lead in the run down to the Point Ormonde buoy. Tbe first half dozen were hero all in a bunch, the balance of the fleet straggling in several companies in the rear. In tbe beat up to tho pier Corio camo out half a minute ahead of Yarana, and Sunbeam 12 sec. later, separated by 10 sec. from Camilla, and 20 sec. from Hyacinth. Ormonde was 3 min. 20 sec. behind tho leadcy, and Daisy, who had been in trouble with her jib, 4 min. 22 see. Next came Starlight, Watenvitch, Flying Scud, Genesta and Astoria. Leitchmcre's new boat and Daisy, distinguished from the others by- reason of their being varnished crafts, soon after wards left the contest. Watorwitch, Flying Scud and Genesta also gave up the ghost, and seven boats remained. In the beat to South Mel bourne buoy Yarana toll behind Sunbeam. Corio still Iod, and was leaving a big gap between her and Sunbeam. When off the Nelson Yarana had a misfortune. She was Bhort handed, and as the crew were getting out her spinnaker the tackle gave way, and sail and boom fell into the water. Camilla improved her position, nud Hyacinth camo up liko a racer. When Yarana had righted her accident a pretty contest took place between the three, Ormonde acting ns whippor in of tho division. As tho race uearcd the Bluff again Blunt'a three boats — Corio, Sunbeam and Hyacinth — were in the three leading positions, Yarana being between Camilla and Ormonde. Sunbeam's mainsail came down owing to the halliards parting, aud this with tho little beat to the pier made all tho difference. Corio sailed past a winner, 3 min. 45 sec. in front of Camilla, with Ormonde 38 sec. later, and Hyacinth 1 miu. 21 sec. later still, separated by 1 min. 5 seo. from Sunbeam. Yarana was next, aud Starlight last. Corio had 1 min. 37 sec. to spare over her time' allowance. The detailed times were : — n» First Second Round.

Tho Wil- liamstown steamer Acis and the St. Kilda club boat Union followed the race, and wcro crowded witn interested passengers. The Royals hold a second class raco this after noon for a 10 guinea trophy, postponed from the 7tk inst. Tho first of two events for Bradley Bros.' trophy will be sailed by the Hobson's Bay; club.

As before, keel and centre board boats are equally eligible to compete, and two of a olass cannot take prizes ill succes sion. If a centreboarder is first past tbe winning point, tbe second prize must go to a kcol boat, tbe third to a centreboarder, aud the fourth to a keel boat, and vice versa. The Viking, and ; periiapa the Iris nnd other Royal boats arc expected to enter. . A cruisers' race for Commodore Bowen's tropby was lately placed on the card for tbo same date, in ignor ance of the Williamstown fixture. Tho latter having been first in tbe field, no doubt tbe seniors will . ensure tbe success of tho juniors' contest by postponing their event to a future date. The final event for trophies presented by their president (Captain MTetrie) was sailed by the Fort Melbourne club on Saturday.. The following boats started Melb'a, Mavis, Othello, Jane and Fox. In tbe first round, the Fox, who was. leading, carried away tbe yard of her. Ing, and bad to retire.

This, with the result of the previous race (Fox 1, . Melba; 2, and Jaue 3), places tbe Melba first, Fox second, and Mavis third. The llatb tropby, sailed for by tbo Ballarat Yacht Club, has been won by Achievement (Mr. F. Williams), with Flying Scud second. Tbe winner was sailed by C. B. Rctallaok.
