"WANTED A GHOST. ' A correspondent of the Bath-rat Evening Post .is anxious to see a ghost. He couiplaius that, though the Spiritists have done a great deal in the way of throwing fowh about, and plaoing on tables inconveniently) pro minent articles of domestic use, they have not yet produced a veritable ghost. He is particularly desirous that the spirit of a de ceased grandmother — noted in the flesh for wearing a ohintz dress of a.peouliar pattern, afterwards utilised for bed curtains— should be recalled, and state's that, as sho was in the habit of pinohing his ear, a similar salutation froman invisible hand, would at ouco convince him that tho Jspirit of his venerable friend was in the looality. Here now is a chance for this solf-dubbed JDr. Dunn— a chance of doing something far more likely to convert acoptica that the worn-out' Davenport triok, and other vulgar manifes tations. Lot him send for thio writer, and get his ear pinched by a convenient me- diuiii. Ho will gain one follower at once. For ourselves we have a pleasauter remem brance of a deceased relative. We remember distinctly a grandfather, who used now and then to visit the public school of our youth- fuldays, and who invariably left a solatiumior his departure in the shape of silver, and sometimes gold, coin of the realm. If Dr. Dnnn will, at his next seance, place in our hands a similar coin to that last bestowed by tho venerable gentleman in question, we shall at once conclude thatjhia spirit is pre sent, and that the excellent habits of his mortal life have not deteriorated in Summer- land. At such seances we would be uightly attendants and firm be lievers.
