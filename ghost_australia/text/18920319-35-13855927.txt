\- LIFE IN LONDON AND THEREABOUT. I (CHRONICLED BY HENRY LWJT.) THE OPENING OF rABLIAlTENT-ITOTKIlEAIi LON- DON SIR. MORELL MAOKKNZIK-DYINO PAId UAJtBNT MR onAMBKIlLAlN AND HIS OR) COLLEAGUES WESTMINSTER, FEB. 12. The opening of the Parliamentary session is in ordinary years the beginning of that vmdi.frnn.blo epoch, the London season The BO ison grows slowly and imperceptibly, reaching its fullest bloom with the roses in June, suddenly and completely feeling after Goodwood, which comes in July But the arrival of some COO eminent gentlemen from the country, some bringing their families and fitting up their establishments, gives a marked impetus to Ufo in London At homes," those remarkable gatherings of well dressed and well-to-do humanity, which, according as they are successful, resemble a crowd penned up at a railway station, do not usually commence till after Easter But dinner parties, large and small, son in Milli considerable seventy first year 01 en the mighty influence of Parliament has failed to stir the sluggish pool of life London still lies under a funeral pall The air is full of farewells to the dying and mournings for the dead Baudot's inky cloak is the unit orsal garb in the street, at church, in the theatre, and at the dinner tables everyone wears black Many do it in token of vacant chairs at their own fireside For the rest it is the fashion, ordered in 'the Castle, and women who would, if opportunity presented itself, steal pearls out of the secret dose of their bosom friend, would not be soon out of doors in other than a black frock when black is the fashion The influenza, the malign influence that is the spring of all our wool, is at last beginning to disappear The weekly returns of the Registrar General show that in London and elsewhere the deaths attributable to it are rapidly decreasing Its last notable not he is Sir Morell Mackenzie, the specialist in throat diseases TV he played so prominent a part through the illness of the Emperor Frederick The shock of his death was added to by the suddenness of its coming One morning the bulletins announced that he was going on favourably The next morning all the world learned that at 10 o'clock at night the light had suddenly gone out, that the quick brain was dulled, and the deft hand stiff There were few men in London with a wider circle of friends and acquaintances than Morell Mackenzie He was a many-sided man, one of his leanings being towards the better kind of Bohemian life He lived in Harley-street, as great London doctors should But he had a house up the river where in summer time he spent his Sundays, keeping open house for all on Lady's Mnokenno's visiting list who passed that I am He had a w ida and intimate acquaintance with theatre people SA brother of the operations dr mint no stage All the great singers of the day were under his professional care I suppose some of them paid his fees it is certain that for any whose moans were doubtful his consulting room door was as wide open as to Path or tile Roszkes His son yielding to his father s proch \ cities, unwarped by his father s genius in another direction, has taken to the stage as a profession Mackenzie was not popular with his own pi of ea- ston, a not unusual thing in the case of a man who has aches, ed phenomenal success Controls era has raged bitterly round him in respect of his treatment of the Emperor Frederick He had, however, the satisfaction of being supported by the confidence and friendship of the Empress Frederick and the Royal circle at home When the Emperor died the Empress with her own hand despatched to Morell Mackenzie the breast pin he had worn, a special gift from the Queen in commemoration of her jubilee Many other tokens of Royal favour Morell Mackenzie has left-hand him but nothing so precious or endurable as the recollection of innumerable kindly deeds quietly performed without prospect of reward in the shape of fees or otherwise Before members of Parliament entered upon the scene of their labours the Palace at Westminster was sedulously fumigated Brimstone candles burned for hours in every chamber, crevices and keyholes whereof were jealously closed It is confidently announced by the authorities that whatever infection of influenza may a fortnight ago have lingered round the place, there is not now within the precincts of Parliament, the ghost of a bacillus That is a comforting assurance as far as it goes But there is another disease that has its grip on the throat of Parliament which no hand can shake off nor any prodigality of brimstone fame stifle One day last year, meeting Mr Gladstone in the corridor of the House of Commons, I ventured to remark upon his apparent blooming state of healthfulness " Yes," he said, smiling, there's nothing the matter with me but old age, and that is incurable " That is what's the matter with the present Parliament It has already passed the stage of existence equivalent to the three score years and ten of man's life, and the rest is but labour and sorrow In this first week of the session, when members come back to work after long recess, it is impossible not to note the sort of paralysis that affects the illustrious body Ministers have brought in a programme of work equal in length to an ordinary session, certainly more than the average of accomplishment Private members, not to fall behind in this kind of grim humour, have drafted and brought in over 300 bills, more than there is any chance of passing in five consecutive sessions Everyone knows this is a sort of melancholy bravado Of the more than 300 questions already in their first stage of submission to the arbitrament of the House of Commons, there is really only one that has any live interest When will the dissolution take place? That is what members within the House and mankind outside incessantly ask At present no answer is forthcoming, for the adequate reason that there is no one qualified to make one Ministers know no more the date than do right hon gentlemen on the front Opposition Bench It is probably certain that as far as circumstances can be controlled the session will drag along to the furthest date possible What Ministers, and, in less acute degree, Ministerialists, would prefer, is that the session should groan and stumble along till the usual date of prorogation in August, and that the dissolution should be cleaned with a view to the general election taking place in October, by which time harvest operations will be over Every effort will be made to achieve this end, but the coach may be upset at any of the numerous turnings it must pass through between now and August The lurking danger of which the Government are sensible lies in the lack of spirit among their supporters A considerable see tion of them do not intend to offer themselves for re-election They are sick and disappointed with the whole business, and are not in a humour to be galvanised into every spasmodic fits of loyalty the Opposition, on the other hand, are full of hope, aglow with animation Rossendale has, in their view, put the seal on the doom of the Government They are more than over anxious to hasten the general election, and they know that end would be powerfully contributed to by putting the Government to the indignity and embarrassment of occasional defeat in the division lobby On big issues, with fame given for mustering their forces, the Government are 9, fe enough Their men will, often in a while, come up to town and boat book the adversary But they will not camp on the ground, and some of rbf the Opposition will capture a Burpnsoro toiyU'tmaVforcotho hand of the Government ondpieoip at the general election The dulness of the opening week in Parliament has been varied by one episode It happened last night when Mr Chamberlain rose from his now Boat as official leader of the Dissentient Liberals to resume the debate on the Address He was in splendid fighting form, and vindicated his reputation as the most skilful and dangerous swordsman in the Parliamentary lists For the Conservatives, depressed and disheartened, it was refreshing, almost exhilarating, to hear Mr Chamberlain's cool, light hearted, confident girding at his old colleagues as in days gone by he used to stretch across the floor of the House and pink stout Tories The soon gained in dramatic effect from the personal proximity of the principal parties It would have been lively enough had Mr Chamberlain risen from the Conservative benches and, facing Sir Wm Harcourt and Mr John Morley, struck at them with almost malignant fury But the former colleague of Mr Gladstone, once the leader of the Radical party, retains the seat he occupied when he participated in their closest counsels Last night, when he wished to point the finger of scorn at his old colleagues, he had but to turn a little on his right heel, stretch forth his arm, and he almost touched the shock of Sir Wm Harcourt, flushed with anger at the proximity Mr John Morley is a gentleman of philosophic mind and equable temper. He rarely descends to personalities in debate. Last night even his sweet reasonableness was disturbed by his old friend's taunts and jeers. He followed him in the debate, and went straight to the pitch of the case when, speaking with deliberation that did not entirely hide the quiver in his voice, he said : "One of the many satisfactory circumstances attendant upon the tolerably speedy approach of the dissolution of this Parliament is that when that event hap- pons we shall- got rid of the unseemly comedy, from which we have suffered so much for the last six years, of a gentleman sitting on this side of libellous denouncing mid assailing from that position Liberal principles, Liberal measures, and His old Liberal colleagues." I let the gentlemen run on in the quotation, but midway, when the crowded and intently listening House caught at point, there went up from the Opposition benches a sudden, angry, prolonged cheer, that marked the deep gap of personal hate that lies between Mr. Chamberlain and the Liberal party.
