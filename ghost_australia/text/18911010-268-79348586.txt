:: ' I ' - . . IHCIBENTS. 1 . Mr. Belper, as may be anticipated, liad loiig since paid, thedebt of Nature. His last; months were embittered by the ba"& behavior of a worthless son in-law and the piteous complainings of an Injured daughter. -Kate, however, if to relieve a wounded spirit she persistently harped on the one theme, atall events displayed sincere affection towards the dying man. As soon as her confinement was over she devoted herself to him, smoothed the pillow of pain, and in her own ebullient fashion would draw contrasts between one who didlove her and one who did not. *Tou are mine and I'm yours, pa!" Bhe would snuffle in her Cockney "Vernacular; and he felt it a broad compliment to be thus placed above her Lothario of a husband. The wily old lawyer rewarded her. * Kate,' whispered he when they were alone and he knew the lamp of life was flickering* and must shortly go out, * Kate,' I've left you everything. No trustees for that fellow to cajole. Every sixpence under your own con trol. I can trust you not to let him handle anything. He shan't be your master if I can help it. I've promised that the business is to be sold. He's not my partner but my clerk, aiid if the feliow likes to serve under the new man he can. He don't benefit in any way by me-that I promise him. I've made the chap your pensioner, my girl, and mind you, hold your own, or, mark my words, he'll sell you!' Kate kissed hey father's wrinkled visage right jubilantly- It was glorious to think that Charl«v stood so completely at her mercy. There and then she registered a resolu hc tion to give him everything needed at home-the best horses to ride, the most luxurious table, raiment to consume King Solomon himself with jealously, but withal no money, or it would go belter-skelter to Mesdames Lais and Phryne. He was to be her servant- boarded,clothed indulged within a circumscribed radius, but wholly without wages. However, it takes two to make a bargain, and when Mr. Belper was gathered to his fathers, and the famous business was sold, Charley neatly contrived that the purchaser, -one Mr. Tarton, from Mauchester should take him as junior partner, with a view of keeping the connection together. That gave him a small, but independent income, and he there upon told Kate plainly that unless she consented to place the entire control of her large fortune at his dis posal she might go her way and he would go his, for it was his intention to be master of his own house. Bhe summoned the aid of relatives on her side, but when for the second time an appeal was launched to the Fitzhugh family, it fell flat-indeed, the vicar told her frankly that the role her ingenuity had chalked out for her husband was one which no man of spirit could accept. Her relatives, however, supported the demand she put forward, based as it was by the obvioujs purport of her late father's will, and then Charley proved a man of his word, He took chambers in St. James, and told her that whenever she might elect to behave as a wife towards him he could return home ; not before. The Jinks clan were, as might be supposed, outraged, and in their fury addressed themselves to Fitzaltamont Fitzhugh, Lord of the Manor of Rewley, in Cheshire, but failed to take the change out of that'gentleman. He replied, in fact, that the alliance with Mr. Belper's daughter was not one he should" have preferred for a son of his had it not been that the lady was supposed to possess the attraction of a small fortune. Further that Mr. Belper's will was conceived m a Spirit of hostility to his son, and lie for one felt that the poor fellow had been simply trapped into a mesalliance under false representa tions. * As for interfering--certainly not, Charley might have been a little frivolous, but this sort of treat meet beregarded as simply intolerable and outrageous. ; ' Itmaybeadded thatthe epithets burled by Mar. Fitzaltamont issued fromthe very depths of that gentfe tnan's heart. For this reason ; there was abeavyish mortgage on JBewley, and rents having fallen, four per cent interest thereon reduced his available income oeriOnslj^-r He had therefore concocted a little pleasant scheme whereby the existing morigage «hould be paid off with Mrs. K&te;'s money, and was prepared to psfy three per cent forthe accommodation. Without his son's friendly assistance this financial operation could not be carried oat, could not indeed be proposed, so that the *hoe pinched him hard and be begged Charley to stand firm. Charley needed no such paternal ex hortation. The freedom of bachelor's quarters, all the fan of the fair - alas, all its riot, suited him admirably. He informed the Jinks clan jauntily that he considered himself a fortunate and happy man. in being able -to associate entirely with gentlemen, in lieu of being muddled up with a set of people devoid of the faintest pre tention to breeding", and very much looked like one who had thrown off a load. In short, ^whereas they came whining and bullying, he met their grievances with cool insolence, and they returned in consequence/ ob jurga'ing vehemently, but ridiculously disconcerted. Moreover, the plan of taking sides in a quarrel between man and wife never yet paid meddlers. Fortified by her Jinkses, Kate held out bravely for a couple of months. Absence, however, makes the heart grow fonder, and Juno, dire as her wrath may be, is only a womrn. The advantage was all on his side, who cared not a button for her; the weakness on hers, who loved the man all the more on account, of the stimulus of jealousy. Every night as she rocked baby Charley to sleep the thought of Ins father tor tured her, and besides that, her little world of snobdom began to chatter.. At first it came with stilettoes in the shape of delicate inquiries after Mr. Fitzhugh, which she had to parry by taradiddles as to business taking him .from home. Next, the truth began to leak out, and then she had to face the fierce stabs of con dolence. To be sympathised with, for being a grass widow is a refined from of torture, and one a young woman of her stiff temper found about as agreeable as ' the scavenger's daughter.* She felt ereN long that she must bang the door in her friends' face. Her own misery seemed hard enough by itself, but was intensified a hundredfold in being so thoroughly enjoyed by people she had all along regarded as slightly her inferior. The situation was rapidly becoming unbearable. It terminated on the odinary lines of human nature. Lady Jinks, in a vein of mauvaise plaisanterie, had the effrontery to congratulate her on having dispensed with an incubus, whereupon the vane veered round abruptly to the opposite point. She informed her ladyship that it was exceedingly wrong to persuade a wife to disobey her husband, and accused the entire Jinks clan of mischief making. This, bien entendu, set up her ladyship's back, and in the. language of Cockaigne that sample of civic aristocracy dubbed poor Charley, a beast. Result-hysterical tears on the part of Kate, and a scene. She wanted some one to blame, not being prepared]to accept the entire onus in her proper person, so she quarrelled hand over head with well-meaning relatives,- whose only fault consisted . in their vehement partisanship of her cause. Odd, but nothing more than paradoxical! The Jinkses ought to have known that when a wife declares she hates her husband the interlinear significance of that utterance is blind love. Charley took the measure of his spouse far more accurately. Now arose the problem of re conciliation. She threw out a feeler. He was irresponsive: She went a ' little further. He replied coldly that the status quo seemed to suit her, and it certainly met his ideas to perfec tion. , She next proceeded to define herself as the most wretched woman on the planet, and pleaded that they had both made mistakes, but not, as she hoped, irretrievably. He sar castically congratulated her on a Revulsion towards rationality, bat begged she would take further tune to consider her position, as he did not intend to be the victim pf changing moods. Then she capitulated in the most abject fashion, offering to assent to any terms provided he! would re turn. So he reappeared with a grand air of injured innocence, assumedthe reins of power, played Jupiter minus the thunder, andmade her understand that he was king.
