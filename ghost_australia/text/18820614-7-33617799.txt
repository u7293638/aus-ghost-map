MR. TOMKINSON ON INDIA. TO THE EDITOR. ALIPH JEEM. Sir—There is an old adage that people who inhabit glass houses had better not throw stones. Your correspondent "Qui Hi" (which by the way is an old and fallacious Anglo-Indian system of spelling the veil-known words sig nifying "Is there anyone there") has ap parently forgotten this -wise miyrini, and has commenced to throw metaphorical stones at Mr. TomMnson on account of the alleged want of interest attaching to the Utter gentleman's lecture on his brief Indian experiences. "Qui Hi" leads the public to infer that lie h?m?>7f could hare done much better if he chose to lecture on his experiences. It may be so, but those vrho hare any acquaintance with Hindustani, when they neaii the absurd sentence which he puts into the mouth of a native magistrate, will perhaps come to another and a totally dif ferent conclusion. I quote his sentence :— "Sic&staydar;? Chda Betatee Sahib pucke tow.' Jeldse, Jddes! Sab Citohee Uyiou. Urn gfumtuF The ghost of Gilchrist would probably be tempted out of bis grave by | these sentences, supposed to i?m?""^ from a well-educated native of India. The literal | translation of this is as follows:—"Ho, policeman. Catch hold this little English gentleman." {Hie preposition "if 1* is mis- j sing.) ** Quickly, quickly. All take away, paoL =I (Preposition wanting here again.} The last two words are almost unintelligible. "Urn," by which "Qui Hi" means, I pre sume, " Hum," is the ?? r of polite parlance, "gheula." might be anything, but may mean, "am going." What the particular point of the whole thing is, when it is translated. most people will probably fail to see.—l am, &c;,
