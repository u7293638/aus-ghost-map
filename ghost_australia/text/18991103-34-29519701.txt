THE EVE OF WAR. EXCITING SCENES IN JOHANNES BURG. EXCITING SCENES. DITCH ASSERTIVENESS. "EXFRANCHISING THE ENGLISH MEN." (From our Special Correspondent.) Johannesburg, October 1, 1889. President Kruger's policy of the past four years has produced nothing but increased irritation amongst his Uitian-<*> der population until now it has readied a* point when Britain cut no longer afford to remain a passive q>ee-^ lator; indeed (he wonder is that she hag for so long remained inactive while. her people have been undergoing the ex- > perieoec of financial ruin, theie * loyalty was being sapped, and their belief in the power of the mother country to pro tect them against oppression or injustice was being destroyed. But as a last resonree - they made a despairing appeal to the *■ throne and fouiTd that the old lion was nei- ■fa ther deal nor indifferent, and while appa rently taking a nap had only been awaiting ~ S the favorable moment when to deal with ,^ those who had interfered with lsia whelps^ *? Those yearn of agitation, these apparently j^ endless protests, these dispatches. Impend and Transvaal, these racial animosities anH, "'XL recriminations, are noy about to bring t| forth their logical sequence, and we are -on. "\je the verge of war; war, with all its bm- **i tality, its horrors, iU indescribable crop «E y33 misery and death, and its honor and glory misery and death, and its honor and glory, \\- ~ | We cannot complain, however, that A 'Jj has come upon ns unexpectedly, lor yean - past it has been discussed as a probabi&y.;^J|§ and for the past few months its^mnincwi %Jh been looked upon as a certainty. Tniffc^x'pS months ago many persons, under 4he $B£*>£ig t pression that they would be allowed g? <P*?MkM main here even though hostiUties ahon&gibgagfsjj; cur, began to provide for that «I^t ing in a stock of food staffs. Js|sg however, information, more or less (J^uL*i''S| was made known to the effect that ?nife?-~™l| 'tish subjects would have to leave, and £iteO£|§i the exodus commenced, and grew gndnalhft?*~l| from a few hundreds a day, until yestes9§rv^ when over 2,000 persons left by the-!«£•>>■, ferent trams. '£be scenes at lile nfliiw^jj station, when the fight jvmitnpimffa £op shs""-*^ chance of a seat, baffles my power* nt H*? ? scription; but the scenes prior to jhrtwp ~% pathetic in all conscience. - A - very proportion of tluf refugees are 'women |USiy? children. Many of the women ■anMHfiruag crushed with the weight of their -WBM&jfcjxS; and broken-hearted atlhe thought*)* ****^S ing their homes and husbands *rfth~jf??|||! dread uncertainty as to when and^fceJiS^S -or if ever, they will be reunited.'.-, "ij^M^S Some of the poor creatures sire TentJHMfJi their grief in tears, and when a jraonp*t)E *|3g little children join in, in sympathy jrithT ?sS their mother, it ie calculated to givesUne^'lOl lump in the .throat and a desire ~io liml*M& pleasanter place. There is a very fijff Jjnm'-gii station in Johannesburg, bnt for xeS?Dn£x£f|f£ tlieir own the railway authorities'cpjnM,^!; people to entrain at what is -rety 4inffe£li more than a aiding, about a mile *maim*SM the town. Three days ago we had dt^BeS^^ rains of the reason; 2} in. fell in hlbimif&Wx; hours, and all at the time when I&iBg;&%SF3 train to the Cape was being got «nK?utit*S| a drenched and bedraggled crowd I-dfH^fcfsSfe think it -was ever.my lot to *cc mb^OHif-O^^ stood there in the downpour, very ftw'^Sm^ '^ mackintoshes or even ah nmbrella.* '^vi *'"£ luggage stood in the middle of a.laise.spSiitV' of water, the top portion being «fi3s3r._fi from above. Then came the rush for the''"f| carriages, .and people raced about in jrugr •■§& inches deep between the rails: one poor ~%f; woman, carrying an infant, tripped U£&f;<3lZ'<i'Q on her face in the water and lay until «$- "sSn sisted to rise. The men were placed in cat- *.*M tie trucks with a tan>aulin over tf*1 * 3^ top, and when that train «teaa?lsyg3 away I feel certain that over JSO per oent.'t&m; of its occupant? were drenched to the dan.--££|js Why «U this additional misery is inflictejs^^ no one teems 10 know, when the wnoTn.^jja?l tiling could be done .bo much better in-ttir^CgSS ligfct, shelter, and convenience of the «U^'ijsfj tion in ton-n.

Jf true, the answer does credit | ;: to his aense of humor, bat I fear thatt . . very few of them have any idea of tne '■■ manner4n which their gift will be received .at ot ihersort of present likely to be made to -them in return. Many i>crson? appear to believe that England lia== a long and tough straggle, ahead of her, but I cannot \- oelieve it. The Boers are well armed both with rifles and artillery, but there is not , a vestige of discipline amongst them. I . ' watched a gathering of them yesterday, ~ aad witnessed quite an animated dispute , between a grey-bearded and long-haired '- < -old man, and' the individual who was said to be the commandant- While at the stn ; tion entraining their horses ever}- man ap peared to insist of hi 3 own method, and , there was no telling who was commandant. ' captain, or private. If these men stand •■■" a .ghost of a chance against British troops \- ':-■ on this occasion, then all that 1 have been .toid concerning the value of drill and dis : «qdine\is so much fudge and bunkum. . ->'. Drill is merely a means of passing time ?.->MmF, and discipline is being insisted upon «'/.fjr the purnose ot feeding the personal ;, '$ytajt& of the members of the higher mili .Stary grades. ..Other value it cannot A- fcn*e:"if ■ the" -Zakhiar (branch hair) 1 .-SWier is as good or a better man C^;^attn'Toanmy Atkins.
