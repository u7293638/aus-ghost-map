MR. ijUrl commeneed the pnjeeedingsoy ^peaking «f ythe grrat advantages people derived ; nonl the ministrations of tha Cbureh; be alluded to the great want that was felt of religions isertices being 4ield before ha was • settled' anrongst-tliem,' but regretted 'that he had not received such enooursgement as Be" might have anticipated. He 1 attributed this to a variety of causes, one of which was our.earliest associations with sacred services- being connected most likely;.

He trusted that the erection of this Church would do an immense deal of good, both socially and morally, and that we should all derive great advantages, religiously and otherwise.' He said that they did not attempt. any great display in this service, which was of the simplest nature; and be paid a graoefal tribute to the character of our respected Police Magistrate, .whom he bad requested to officiate on the present oeoasion.

The Treasurer of tbe Hay Hospital acknowledges the receipt of £-5 from Mr. James Tyson, junior, being proeerfsof flos in a trespass esse. This example ii : worthy of imitation,as the custom of devoting fines to charitable institutions is a most excellent one, and frees the prosecutor from the imputation of sordid motives;—Oct. i.
