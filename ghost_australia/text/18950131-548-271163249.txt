Hey, Diddle, Diddle. Hey, diddle, diddle! The cat and the fiddle, Are getting old-fashioned, I trow, Moro novel ’twould be for a great wallaby The organ to play with one toe. For the moon to give chase to the man on her And the comet to join in the fun. For the evergreen rabbit to weep at the habit Of squatters infesting its run. For the novelist pale to yield up his tale To the sheep of Bo peep's woeful verse. For the ghost of the corner to sit on Jack Horner White Coroner Cats seek a hearse. For small dogs to giggle when cows give a wriRf-lo, That lands them away past the moon, Is really quite stale, as is also the talo Of the dish making oft’ with that spoon, Xow, not to make off with a spoon when there’s Is a far more astonishing thing. And to see the moon wriggle—oh, hey diddle, diddle, In that case you realty might sing. —K.T. In “Townand Country Journal.”
