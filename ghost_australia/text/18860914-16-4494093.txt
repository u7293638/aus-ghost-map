[ "THE CRUISE OF THE BACCHANTE THIS book, the record of the three years' commission of the Bacchante from 1870 to 1832, is being read in all parts of the empire, not perhaps because of its intrinsic merit as because it is the " prince " book And yet it possesses a great deal of interest, is full of most valuable information, and is illustrated by some excellent engravings It may be said at the outset that there is a great deal more of the Rev. Mr. Dalton in the book than is to be found in the not inconsiderable portion which is enclosed between brackets, and is avowedly written by the tutor. Not only is the narrative contributed by the princes themselves, evidently trimmed and dressed by the tutor, but it often seems as if the reflections were suggested by him There is a very visible tendency to work in quotations, and to moralise, not to be expected in boys-who were such very natural boys as the lads we saw here four years ago. This feature of the book is most marked in the early part of it, and becomes less distinct toward the end, when the lads having aged, and gained much and varied experience during three years at sea, began to think and record their own thoughts with less reference to the lessons they were taught. Still, even in the very first trip the lads manage to impress their own boyish nature on the pages The first voyage began by a cruise in the Mediterranean as far as Sicily, and the young authors begin to ex patients at Minorca, where they rather suddenly jump from a sententious description of scenery to state that they are prickly pear for the first time, and carried a remembrance of it " on their lips and fingers in the shape of little white and numberless soft thorns, which had the faculty of intruding themselves everywhere." They found the pulp of the pears to be of a bright orange colour, and tasting like a "mash of medlars slightly flavoured with hips and haws." They also record the fact that as they drove along some of the party, made , jumped out and played banditti, with the result of being left to walk home After leaving the Mediterranean the Bacchante sailed for the West Indus, and the descriptions given of the islands are really interesting. Queenslanders will be particularly interested in that of Trinidad, where Hindoo coolies of all sorts are imported, and seem to thrive amazingly. They go home, it appears, and often return, buying land and settling down A patriotic outburst occurs in this part of the book, mainly taken from a work by Charles Kingsley, which has already gone round the Australian Press, but will bear repetition here The Bacchante in her voyage from Barbadoes to Martinique passed over the waters where Rodney won his great naval victory of 1782 "The air yet, even in cloaroBt blare of sun shine," the princes write, "seems full of ghosts-the ghosts of gallant sailors and soldiers Truly, hero The spirits of our fathers Might start from every wave For the deck it was their field of mine And ocean was their grave Start, and ask us, their sons, ' What have you done with those islands which we won for you with precious blood'' And what could we answer ' We have misused them, neglected them, till at the present moment, ashamed of the slavery of the past, and too ignorant and helpless to govern them as a dependency of an overburdened colonial bureau in London, now slavery is gone we are half minded to throw them away again, and give them up' no matter to whom But was it for this that those lands were taken and retaken, till every gully and every foot of the ocean bed holds the skeleton of an English man' Was it for this that those seas were reddened with the blood of our own forefathers year after year' Did all those gallant souls go down to Hades is vain and leave nothing for the Englishman but the sad and proud memory of their useless valour ' ' It is a question of some interest how far these phrases contain an expression of the spontaneous opinion of the royal lads, and how much is due to the inspiration of their tutor Mr Dalton is evidently an enthusiastic Imperialist, and his habit of thought must, of course, have influenced his pupils Besides, the same sentiment probably prevails throughout that branch of the service which is specially intrusted with the defence of the colonial possessions of Great Britain. There is nothing surprising, there fore, in the fact that the elder of the two lads, who had reached an age when boys begin to think, should have felt moved to embody the prevailing sentiment of his associates-a south mont which he no doubt enthusiastically shared -in the outburst we have quoted Mr Dalton interpolated in this portion of the book a long and rather interesting dissertation on bounties and their effect on the sugar planting in dustry. It was on 20th September, 1839, that the Bacchante sailed from England on her second cruise to join the flying squadron, and with it visit Australia and China At Buenos Ayres they saw something of pastoral life, and were told some state stones about the "camp" or bush of the Argentine plains A square league 5760 acres of fair land will carry 2500 head of cattle or horses and 10 000 sheep, giving fleeces weighing on an average Gib, but not unfrequently as much as 10lb " Even if we substitute "work for "and in the foregoing sentence, the stock would be, according to our standard, a very heavy one This wonderful land, of which the princes were told " the best land in Australia is about on a par with the lightest and poorest here," can be purchased for about 25s an acre within ninety miles of the capital, and as cheaply as 55 further out Toncing coats £40 to £50 per mile All this was apparently learned at the house of a Mr. Shannon, an estate and stock owner, at whose place the lads had an exceedingly good time " They shot, played polo, saw lassoing, and visited the cemetery of the estate, where are three graves the first that of the doctor, who married the lady heiress of the estate, the next, that of her second husband (the doctor's executor), who died of yellow fever three months after his marriage , the third, that of the lady herself and her third husband, who was the first love of her youth, and who happened to be also a widower at the time when his old lady love required his services " The squadron called in at the Cape to " demonstrate," on account of the Boer war. Some of the Dutch inhabitants demonstrated on the other side by running up the Dutch flag as the fleet came to anchor in Simon's Bay After lying there for some time they sailed for Australia On the way they were overtaken by a severe gale, and the rudder of the Bacchante was entirely disabled However, improvised steering gear was rigged, and they ultimately made King George's Sound on the 14th May, 1884 The delay caused by the accident enabled the princes to have a goo I long run ashore and trip up country in Western Australia. It is not improbable that they enjoyed this part of their trip more than any other portion of their visit to our colonies They were almost entirely free from the attentions of ' leading citizens, and for a time at least officialism was only represented by two mounted troopers, native born West Australians, who were splendid horsemen, and could give wrinkles about fishing and duck shooting They had to go from Albany by the P an I O boat to Adelaide, and one of them-Pnnco George, we venture to guess records with great glee that he was midshipman of the guard boat, and condoled with one of the officers of the mail steam or who confided to him that he regarded it as a nuisance to have the princes as passengers From their arrival in Adelaide the princes were of course taken in hand by personages of all sorts. The reader misses the personal interest which is to be found in other parts of the book, because the youthful authors have struggled so hard to repeat some of the " useful information with which they were crammed that they have little space to record impressions, if, indeed, they had much opportunity given to them to receive them. At Sydney they first met our former Governor, the late Sir Arthur Kennedy, and the old gentleman took the earliest opportunity of interesting them in his favourites-the Chinese. " He says that he and Miss Kennedy and her maid are the only Europeans who allows in his house, everyone else is a Chinaman." The narrative of the visit to Brisbane is brief and rather bare. There is a record of all the things the princes did ; but nothing of what they thought. They mixed up some of the " useful information got here. Having met Mr. Gregory at Government HOUSE, they are led to speak of exploring generally, and after referring to Mr. Christie Palmerston's explora- tions on the Herberton plateau, they go in to write about Mr. Forrest's explorations in the Northern Territory, which they evidently suppose to be part of Queensland. Of the rivers he found, they say, " These rivers deposit large tracts of the finest alluvial soil, much of it in the south of Queensland fit for yielding all the fruits and cereals grown in temperate climates and that in the centre and not for most tropical products." The Trans continrntalRüilway project is spoken of enthusiastically, but a note states that Sir "The Outline of UM -. Riechinte, Uomuiiod from the Private journals letters. and Note- books of Prince Albert Victor and Prince George of Wales, with Additions by John N. Dalton," 1 London : Macmillan & Co. Thomas M'Ilwraith was defeated on the project " for the present, but the line will be made ultimately "There are about a couple of pages of information on the colony generally, in which the following sentence occurs - Not withstanding the prevailing dislike to the hordes of Chinamen who wish to pour into the land, there is no choice between resorting to their labour or abandoning all thought of making railways, opening up the interior, and generally developing the resources of a country so exceptionally favoured by Nature Of course the labour question is touched The " stern determination to make Queensland a white man's country is referred to as the reason why Europeans are found to labour in the cane brakes " As in Barbadoes, the first English settlers all worked in the sugar holds, so it is here now But as the races there degenerated in the tropics, 80 here in this particular it is probably attempting that for which it is not adapted The white labour party here are so determined that " should it be deemed absolutely necessary to till a portion of Northern Queensland by coolies, this party would be prepared, however reluctantly, to have a limited territory, clearly unadapted for European settlement, delineated, and to make of it a Crown colony along the north of Australia ' From Brisbane the squadron sailed away from Australia altogether " During the quarter of the year we have spent in Australia," the princes write, "we have enjoyed ourselves more than at any other place) since we left England, everybody has been so very hospitable We are glad that it has been our happy privilege to visit them (the shores of Australia), we are sorry they are not better known to our fellow countrymen in Great Britain ' Abundantia dissentions to Fiat pax in virtute tua et abundantly in turnbull tins Propter francs meets at proximo meets loquebar pacers de be, at question bona has ' From Brisbane the squadron sailed for FIJI, thence to Japan and China and the description of these two countries occupy half the second volume. The interest of the book increases as the cruise recorded lengthens Not only had the young authors advanced in years and at their age a period of eighteen months done much to mature a lad , but their observant and reflective powers had been much developed by the experience they had acquired Here for instance is an instance of what we mean The Mikado entertained the prices at his palace with a concert of very rare ancient Japanese music The musicians were in an adjacent room, and the sounds proceeding from it were so "faint and plaintive' that some of the party thought the players were tuning their instruments and asked when the concert would begin ' Like all Oriental music to a Western car, it appears altogether out of tune and full of discords being set in a wholly different key, and seeming to speak a wholly different language to our own But after listening to it attentively for some time, although we cannot say we like it, yet we can quite understand how some people do, just as others admire Mr Whistler's pictures on a piece of faded old silk work or the faint flavour or smell of some to our taste, Bickly flower or fruit In China the princes had plenty of fun, and some excellent shooting when they made excursions into the country. The most densely populated agricultural country is dotted with little thickets growing round the Bites of graves and in this cover pheasants and other game birds abound One difficulty they experienced was that the peasants everywhere crowded around them to see the shooting, so they could hardly put gun to shoulder without " covering a China- man ' One old fellow was slightly peppered by a member of the party, but was more than satisfied by the present of over a month's wages in compensation When out one day they met a Mandarin in his chair 'First came two pair of men in fancy dress, shouting to clear the way , then several pairs of attendants with long tails and arms of all sorts, and a little behind them the sedan chair with the old swell, spectacles on nose, gravely gazing out in the front The round pebbles of which these are composed are nearly 2in in diameter, and their run rests on his cheek bones the frame has a hinge between the glasses, and the machine is kept on by loops over the ears ' Of China, the princes say, after enumerating the changes that have taken place that he must be very blind or very ignorant who does not see that the giant is moving from China they sailed by Singapore and Ceylon to the Mediterranean There were trips in Egypt and Palestine, and a consider- able space is devoted to these via tu Tho in terest, as we have said, increases toward the end of the book Indeed it is interesting all through more so than the average book of travels and the mass of information collected and put into readable shape is remarkable The illustrations also are very good The book concludes pleasantly with the home coming the proud record that the high average of marks obtained by the Bacchante midshipmen for their examination papers put the ship first on the hat-and an extract from Archbishop Tait's address to the lads on their continuation, which sacred ceremony took place immediately after they had left their ship, and settled down on shore
