THE CAIRNS MEETING. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. SIR -in your issue of yesterday is a letter signed ' 1 T Wimble," the grammar and composition of which is sufficient to serve the ghosts of Lindley Murray and Moi eil howling to the remotest recesses of the universe In justice to the Cairns people and the Cairns Divisional Board you will allow me to explain the true value of Mr Wimble's letter His hatred to the board is the outcome of envy and disappointment At the last general election Mr Wimble was a candidate for a seat on the board, and the ratepayers recorded their appreciation of his splendid abilities and numerous virtues by placing him at the bottom of the poll He aspired to become a member and attain the position of chairman Finding both aspirations cruelly smashed up by a humiliating defeat that would have sent a sensitive man to an early grave and seeing no prospect of acquiring, divisional board distinction, he next tried to arrange a petition to have Cairns formed into a municipality, so that he would have a chance of becoming an alderman and perhaps even use to be the mayor himself His i of erences to Mr Kenny can be disposed of in a very summary fashion Mr Wimble is the proprietor and occasional editor of a publication called the Cairns Post a burlesque journalistic parody so completely devoted to the personal interests of the proprietor as to be generally referred to as Wimbles circular During the last Parliamentary election Mr Wimble and the Post advocated the M Ilwraith candidates with such ferocious enthusiasm, and such total absence of the animal, logic facts and judgment, that he succeeded magnificently in inflicting more injury on his own cause than the most 1 net getic and influential of its enemies When Mr Griffith enter ed office the Post expended all its time and the most of its space to show that the Griffith Ministry ought to be exported immediately if not sooner the cause of the continual denunciation was so clearly personal instead of patriotic that Mr. James Kenny in a crowded public meeting carried unanimously a declaration that the Port in no sense represented the public opinion of Cairns ' Since that meeting Mr Wimble's affection for Mr Kenny cannot be expressed by the English language Mr James Kenny is the present chairman of the divisional board, a man possessing the respect of all classes, and his colleagues on the board are likewise men of intelligence and unsullied character men 1 representing all classes of the community, and any one of there is immeasurably super let to Mr Wimble in ability education, and 1 reputation Mr Wimble s pretensions to being a representative man are treated in Can you with the same feeling that is bestowed on a small boy who stands on his head in the sand and imagines himself an acrobat He has not the remotest chance of ever being elected to any position in the control of the Cairns people, and his advocacy would be fatal to any body else His politics are of the patent reversible ty of an I since Mr Kenny's motion was carried the I oil has carefully avoided say ing anything in favour of the Opposition or prejudicial to the Government When the ou liant cat jumps the watchful Wimble will t ii e a flying- Imnclspiing in the same direction ie"ridlessof any point in the political compass In reference to the address to Sir Thomas At Uwi 6th I have to say that it was arranged with such secrecy that though it must have been signed and sent off before I left Cairns neither the divisional board nor the people of Cairns know anything about it A foolish friend 111 his folly is more to be dreaded than a crocodile robbed of her eggs and Wembley friendship since dangerous than bad dynamite But I have to inform Sir Thomas M Ilwraith that the Cairns meeting was in no sense unfriendly to him far from it, but only an indignant and emphatic protest against the impudent assumption of Mr Wimble pi ofes sing to represent the Cairns public whereas he really represents nobody but himself, and even does that in a very inferior manner -I am, sir, sea..
