THE REV. CHARLES CLARE'S . RECITALS. The announcement that tlie Rev. Charles" . Clark would recite Dickens's deiightful "Christmas .Carol" attracted. a verj: - large audience to the Town/ Hall. on . Monday pight. The gtfeat novelist's powerful word- . picture of the- best features of the' ' old English YuleticJe season is. true to ' life and human nature that repetition cannot detract from its charm; and those who had experienced the pleasure of listening to. the great-lecturer's dramatic interpretation of the piece during his previous visits to Adelaide enjoyed the ra&al; quite as much as did those who. were brought ; under his spdl for'the . first time. The familiar story of Scrooge's dismal life and his temfving interview with / Marley's ghost caused cbnsiddfcable amusement, which was intensified by the lee- . turer s' inimitable recital, of the quaint bat vivid description ofFezziwig's: domestic ball, Bob Cratchet's humble but happy dinner party, and the innocent frivolities of Scrooge's nephew's family circle. . By-his masterly r^nd^ri.tlfe of the pathetic and, sombre scene in".which the ghost of "things to -come" shows Scrooge Bob Cratchers family under the shadow oÂ£ their great sorrow at" the loss 1 of "Tiny Tim" the lecturer gave fresh proof of-his power of placing upon the feelings of his audience, and it was a relief to most of those- present when he passed on to. describe the humo-' rous efforts of the reclaimed Scrooge to make .amends for" hit' previous "callous "indifference'.,to the welfare of'bis fellow-men. During the evening songs were "given' by Mrs. Howie and Miss Hetty Holroyd, and each of these talented artists had to respond to well-deserved encores at the conclusion of each number: To-night the last ; but one of these po'pular entertainments will be given, when an entirely new programme- will be introduced.
