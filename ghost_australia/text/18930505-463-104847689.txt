POETRY. BESIDE MB SEA. ©own beaide Ae restless oce»n and its troubled ? tones of sadness, With my last hope left in fragments, like its suges on the shore, X can watch the waters laughing, in the mimicked smile of gladness, And. like them, hide all the sadness that still lingers ia the rear. And my thoughts ran back tocWUhood, with Ha stuuhine and the gleaming That looks brighter through the darkness that has gathered o'er its way ; And the pleasant fancies weaving things that are not dreams, yet seeming, Lift the phantoms of a beaoty that » life has breathed away. Sot the dead and dying fragranoe of the earliest flower we cherished, for the lore so like the shadow of a presence now no more, How each heart forgets its future, to revive the hour that perished, And to ask again the solace that its beauty gave before I But how ghost-like on tide morrow broods the shadow of the sorrow, Bull reproving, never moving from the wrong it comes to chide ! And how oft the heart must borrow all that shame and all that sorrow For the wrong that would not follow with the one who sinned and died 1 Sow the secret, sad complaining of the waters ever gaining, ZisAigbing, sighing, surging, dying, with a grief so like our own, Breathes a music ever framing sounds of sad' seas, while the feigning Of a gladness still remaining, laughs above the mournful moan ! And whene'er the past comes stealing with its shadows, otill concealing All the sunshine that would linger on the hour as yet unknown, I -can walk thu beach, appealing for the solace -of that feeling 'That the waters seem revealing in a voice half like iny own.
