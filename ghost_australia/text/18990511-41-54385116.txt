UNEMPLOYED LABOUR BUREAU. To the Editor. Sir— I would like to draw tne public at tention to the manner in which the unem ployed are treated at the Labour Bureau. I ?iave been to the office for about five weeks and have seen some very mean wore car ried on there in that time. I have been toll bv the Commissioner of Public Works that all notices of work were to Be put on the notice-board, but I find that a lot of the men hive been quietly put on to Barossa aud the pipe track and other places through the influence of some of the members for their districts. Those of us who have atten ded the office every day have not a ghost of a chance of getting employment while such practice is carried on. If the Labour Party would make some enquiry into the work ing of the Bundaleer works, I do not think there would be one man out of work to-day; but. Sir, hundreds of men have been on those works and discharged without being able to get any reason why. I should like to know if the Barossa works are at a standstill, or why the Government cannot put on a hundred, or so there, as things arc in a very bad state with a lot of the unem ploved. The Commissioner of Public Works said that there was to be no favour shown, yet whv does he allow tbat back-door way of sending men to different jobs? I for one would sooner see the Bureau closed than like it is now. . Hoping something will soon be done to better our position, I am, Sir, 4c, LBVAR. [We have referred this letter to the Supe rintendent of Public Buildings, who assures us that the Bureau is managed on the fair est possible lines. The men who were put on the Barossa works belonged to the dis trict, and, therefore, had claims to first con sideration. Mr. Sroythe also infonned us that he has difficulty in getting the men to accept work at Bundaleer.— Ed.] It is believed that in China there is twenty times as much coal as in all Europe.
