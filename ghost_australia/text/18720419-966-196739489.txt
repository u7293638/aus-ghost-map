COLONIAL LITERATURE.—We have to acknowledge the receipt from Messrs. E. S. Wigg and Son of a copy each of the two compilations of stories from the pen of Mr. R. P. Whitworth, just published by MacPhail &: Son, of Melbourne. A telegram the other day mentioned that the second edition had been bought up for Adelaide, and we can, apart from the raciness of some of the tales and the pleasing nature of others, understand how beeause of the neat jstyle and low price of the publications there should have been a run upon them. The titles of the sets, "Australian Stories Round the Camp Fire" and "Under the Dray," will of themselves give an idea of the outdoor sorts of topics and people that figure in the narratives. Station aud teamster life in all the varied phases of such free-air existences passes before the reader in a series of vivid pen pictures, wherein anecdotes and yarns fill a large space. " Melancholy Jack's Story" will be mused over by some people, while lovers of the more sensational will find pabulum in "The Trooper's Story of the Bank Robbery ;" while the Hawker, the Larrikin, and Chips each tells his tale in characteristic language. This list will show that under the dray and round the camp fire are places credited with being the scenes of lively gossip very diverse in sort; but when we add that a doctor is made to tell his experiences with a queer patient, a major recalls the past, an Irishman tells a ghost story, and aboriginal traits and exploits come in for a share of attention, it will be admitted that the bill of fare promises spicy, rich, and sparkling entertainment for quiet leisure time. We might possibly, had more apace been available, have been able to give our readers a slight taste of the quality; but as the books can now begot easily and ats;i extremely low rate, numbers of people will <3oubtlcss yet them .and digest the contents.
