There wasn't any view to speak of, the conntry being too hilly ip those parts to have much scenery, but for that: people were anxiousto say that they had been to the top of the steeple. ' There was an old maid in Mr. Humphreys' , congregation who was more t determined to get married than any woman yon fiver saw. She was one of those thin, persevering-lpoking women ; and a mighty dangerous sort they are. , Miss Payson, which was this lady's same,: .was bound to marry a young man by the name of Halsey, who had never done her any harm, and was about as sensible and well-behaved a chap as there was in all Athensville. Of course, he didn't have the least idea of marrying the woman, bnt he was one of those 'good-tempered chaps that are always afraid to say no when a woman asks them to do anything. Good temper Is the rain of lots of folks. It keeps me down, I know that. If I'd been one of these crusty, rampageous feilews that never does a kind action if he can help it, I should have been superintendent of this road instead of being only a station-maeter at one of the smallest stations in the Territory. Never you be too good-tempered. Of the two, it ruins mere men than whisky. €1 (\\**^ Jaw ^ff*M«l DillMIMt m1«A ^HM^M uus uuj, iuigo .- i.ajBuu euc |joba young Halsey to take her up in the steeple of the Baptist Church. You see, visitors were always going up that steeple between the hours of ten and five, during which the sexton stayed at the church to attend to thinsfs, and see that everybody conducted themselves as they should. At five o'clock he locked up the. door that led to the steeple, and then he locked up the church door, and went home. for the night. ' Miss Payson and her young man went up the steeple abont three o'clock in -the afternoon j bnt she said she cujujcu in uu pubu iuai jj.aiocjr nun prevailed upon to stay there with her a good deal later than he had intended to stay. She had kept him pointing ont all the houses in the town and every hill and valley in the whole neighbourhood ; and when she finally asked him to look at his watch and tell her the time, she was, as she pretended, dreadfully alarmed to find that it was half-past five. Halsey ran: down the stairs and found that the door was locked, and nobody was within hearing. The sexton had forgotten that there was anyone up the steeple, and had locked up and gone home at five o'clock, as usual. Halsey came back and told. Miss Payson, who burst into tears,' and said that her reputation -was ruined. She and Halsey would have to spend tbe night in tbe steeple, 'unless he was willing to jump out of tbe window, and break his neck, and she would rather die a thousand times than let Mm do that 'Halsey was considerably scared himself, for he saw that, unless he could invent some way of getting Miss Pay son out of that steeple, he would have to marry her whether he wanted to or not. He thought the matter over for a while, Miss Payson weeping her level best, and resting her head Tin a forgetful sort of way on. his shoulder. Finally a bright idea struck him. There was the bell rope, which was a stout one-inch mamila. Why snouldn 'the lower Miss Payson to the ground with it, and then slide down it himself. ' He explained his plan to the lady, but she didn't seem to like it. She said she was sarejj^rope would break, or that he would^orop it, or that she. would be filled in some sort of way if tbe experiment was tried. ' No,' says she ;!' I Jrill remain here, and trust to your honGir as a gentleman to defend me from the#neers of the heartless world. I reallv iiaven't the couraare to allow you lower me down. this awful height with any rope.' ''''..'','??'.? f ' Halsey.wouldn'tJiear, to her objec tions, and argued with her a long time^ It- wasn't' 'tintil ite accidentally men tioned that the' steeple was just chock full of mice, and rate, and bats, and such| that Miss Payson! consented to try! the! rope.

There wps the bell just above his head, and all he had to do was to climb np und ring ; it -by smnging~ the clapper from side to side, till 'flie^ alarm should bring back the sexto^ with the keys. By this .time it wa& getting rather dark, and Halsey set to work at the bell, and kept on tolling it slow and regular, for that was the only, way he conld inansge to ring it. '. ' It's the custom with us to toll ? the bell when anybody dies, and to give just as many strokes on the bell as the. deceased hod lived f^ue^ When Halsey began to , tpll ( the, ,bejl -the , Athensville people listened _^o tfin.5 '6ni how old the deceased had been. When the strokes had got up among the eighties, they allowed that the oldest settler in the town must have died very sudden, for he haid1 been seen drunk as usual and in perfect! health that afternoon, as; late as three v viuuk. .. uuii mo uen: Kept on, sua isooo ; after it had tolled some two hundred and ? fifty times, and Bhowed no sijpis 'of stopping, folks began to think that, the sexton had just happened to hear oabout death of Methuselah, and was notifying other people of the fact. - : ; ' ' You may ask why didn't somebody go to the cfanrch and find ont what I.UQ ucu nag iiugiug' i\ft. irvil ? tvr V11O thing it was just snpper fime, and nobody felt anxionfi to take « walk of a mile or two just at that hoar, . Then, too, it had been said that the Baptist churchyard was haunted, and there was not anv desire to interfere with the ffhnstR in case they shonld have taken a notion to toll the bell. The tolling kept on till Halsey had toiled the bell four hundred times and then Bey. Mr. Humphreys arrived, on the spot ; and when he heard Miss Payaon's voice somewhere in the air, over bis head, he was considerably startled, though not being a believer in ghosts he wasn't the least, bit frightened. : ' ''How on earth did you come -up there, ma'an?' asks the minister. 'And what are yon tolling the bell for?'-- ? .. \ ', '? ' -? ./ / .: ! ' Miss Payson explained wtiat was matter. She said that she and Mr, Halsey had come to the churoh in the afternoon cal'lating to find the parson there; and to get married ; that nbt finding him they had gone into': the steeple to see the view, and, had been acci dentally locked in. She was sure that she couldn't live many minutes longer, sbe felt so weak, and she hoped ( Mr. Humphreys would marry her to. Mr. Halsey without another minnteV debay, and bo save her reputation, even if it didn't save her life. The minister wanted to send for help, and get Tier safe on the solid ground before marry ing her, but she said she must be married - before she conld dare face any of her townsmen. Such, she said, ware also dear Mr. . Halsey's views,,; ; and if , Mr,. Humphreys had the feelings of a man and- a Christian, let alone a Baptist minister, he would go ahead with the marriage service. ./.'..' Mr. Humphreys finally consented, and'ealled out to Halsey to nod when he should see the minister wave his right1 arm, that being the only way in; which Halsey could make responses, seeing as hi« voice didn't fairly reach to the ground. Having arranged this' Batis factorily, as he thpnght, Mr. Hum phreys went ahead, and . in ; abont two minutes he had Miss Payson married to Mr. Halsey. Just then the sexton came up with the keys, and knowing where he could lay bis hand.on a length of rope, betook it ..up .into the steeple with him, and bent it on to the, bell rope. Then he and Mr. Halsey ^Dwered Miss Payson to, the igronnd, and came down the stairs togelhpr. - '-;;- . ; ''^^l^ndJ^^^JwiSng^for jpn: in jhe graveyard/ paro ^Mr^Hmn phreystoMr. Haleey^ ; :f She's naturally' a little excited, and 'she's' renting on a ' * If you mean Miss' Payson/ ^ays Halsfey ^ I jcani't tinderstattd ?
