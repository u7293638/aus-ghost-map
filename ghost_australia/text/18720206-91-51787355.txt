WE have heard ea mach lately from the plritnaUsta respecting the conveyance of cor- pulent persons througb.tha «ir by spirits than on account given by a correspondent of the Wettern Mau of an incident which occurred n fan days ago in the neighbourhood of the peace- ful little town or Crumlin does not «cito the surprise which might have been felt in loss en- lightened times than these. Still the story is uncomfortable. It seems that an aged "haulier" or labourer, who lives at Oroespsinmec, was ths other night awakened from his slumber by the sopnd of a voice. " John," said the voior, " you most come with me." "Go thy way, and let 'me alone to sleep," was the labourer's'veply. " You must como," said the Voice. " I will not -and cannot," replied the labourer. " You must come, and come willingly," rejoined the voic%> " otherwise I will tear thee to pieces." " You may depend I will not ; I cannot. I don't know thee," exclaimed the labourer in a rage, when suddenly the voice was silent. But in a few minutes the labourer saw standing before him tho ghost of a fellow- labourer who some years ago worked with him on the Bisca tram road, fie now consented to accompany his deceased friend, who gave him the choice of being conveyed by "uch wynt"-that is to say, either through the air or along the road. John said be had never been through the air, but would not mind trying it. The two accordingly proceeded hy air as far as Bieoa Bridge, a distance of sersn miles by road, but only eu by atmosphere. Here John was put down and directed io throw into the SUhowy River an old gun whieh had been concealed on the banks eint» the time of the rebellion in Monmouth- shire at the close of 1839. Having done this, he was taken back es route ** uch wynt," and gently replaced on his bed of straw. The L above statement, «sys the writer, is generali; ] f believed in Crumlin, and many respectable ?' tradesmen assert it to ba a fact.
