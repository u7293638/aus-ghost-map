The sitting lasted all day, and Ministers dealt fully with the re- commendations regarding the officers who were engaged in the pursuit and capture of the Kelly gang of bush- rangers. These recommendations were not approved of by the Cabinet. Assistant- commissioner Nicolson and Superintendent Hare, who were under suspension, and whom the commission advised should be superannuated, were reinstated. They will not, however, return to their former duties, but in a few weeks they will be appointed stipendi- ary police magistrates. Superintendent Sadleir was also rehabilitated. The Cabinet felt that he was open to censure for an indiscreet imputation of cowardice upon Senior-constable Kelly, but his con- duct generally was approved of, and Ministers refused to carry out the recom- mendation of the commission, which was that he be placed at the bot- tom of the list of superintendents. The commission suggested that Inspector Brook Smith should be called upon to retire, because of incapacity in con- nexion with the search, but as that officer was at the time of the inquiry in very delicate health, his case was not dealt with. Mr. Smith has since been superannuated. Detecive Ward was placed lowest on the list of second class detectives for having misled his superior offficers ; Sergeant Steele was granted a special board to report whether or not ho fired dohborately at ceitain innocent per sons when the police wero fighting the gang at Glenrowan, and Constables DuroBS, Alexander, and Dowling wero dismissed for gross cowardice m not facing two of the outlaws when Aaron Sherritt was murdered by them Mr H M Chomley, previously acting chief com missione, has been appointed per manently to that post, and is charged with tho duty of reporting upon the best means to be adopted to im- prove the efficiency of the force Tho Government, at ft subsequent sitting, loviowed the report of the board appointed to dUnbute the roward of £8,000 ottered jointly by Now South WaleB and Vic- toria for the capturo of the gang Thoy approved of the recommendations gene- rally, but decided to propose to Parlia- ment that £450 in addition to tho board's award of £550 should bo voted to Mr Thomas Curnow, state school master at Glenrowan, who courage- ously stopped the special train in which tho polico woro travelling In pursuit of the bushrangers, and thus prevented its desude u Mr Curnow will thus ro ceive 11,000 for his services 1h mpro\ement of the defences of üa 0 ny has also occupied tho atten hoi ni ¡Ministers New boilers have {>«. c I red for tho turret ship Cer- bero, which will be rendered thoroughly efhoent when they have been fitted The acting agent general has boen in struced to purchaso four Nordonfoldt guns rjr the Cerberus and Nelson, and six Ireeoh loading broadside 7 Inch pieces cm tie unproved Armstrong pattern for the Uter vessel These, with the neces 5?,fy fJPPly of ammunition, will cost about ¿ö^ßOi The permanent artillery force ^'^äed by the Berry Government in 1880 till be re organised on a firmer basis, ho mon to bo solely employed in gunner; duty They will be paid at an unprovLo; late according to their length of servici it i8 intended to secure an artillery autant through the War Office in London wno will serve five years in uns colonytn charge of the new corps ¿"o^eralbatterieafor tho defence of mt Phillip re being rapidlr comploted and equipped, For extra marine protec- tion it has bee determined to pinchase a ¿0 ton AlphsQeta gunboat, two 12 ton btaunch gunboalj Bnd two Thorneyoroft _K?0kuncheaimtable foroitherspar ?or Whitehead tor8d0e».

at the time of his death, and that he left a widow and nine children, some of whom were able to support themselves In this case, as in all the claims preferred against them, the Board of Land and Works did not dispute their liability, but left it to the jury to aasesB the damages The jury awarded the executors of Mr Stephen £3,000, directing that the amount should be invested, the in tereet paid to Mrs Stephen during her life, and at her death that the principal should be equally divided among her children The Kev. Mr Garrett left a widow and two children He was29yearaof age at hiadeath, and he had been in receipt of an income of nearly £200 per annum The jury awarded £3 500 in this case, directing that the sum Bhould be divided equally between the widow and children The trial in reference to the claim of Mr Bailliere s widow baa not yet taken place Of the other suffprers, Mr Alfred Bites, auctioneer and land agent, who sustained severe injuries to his legs and bod), has been nwarded £2,300 Mr, r Stephen, a solicitors clerk, who received an injury to the arm and leg and shock to the system, has been awarded £J >0 Mr T Miller, a solicitor, had bia shoulder dislocated, and waB otherwise injured He bas received £1,150 Mr R Jones, a grocer, who Buffered from an injury to the bead, has been allowed £400 Mr W Snook, a com mission agent, has been allowed £1,500 Mr Coach, formerly an officer in the Indian army, but latterly a clerk, has been awarded £725 for injuries to the head Miss Budd, a Behool teacher, who waa m the carriage next to the smoking one, and who has auatained a shock to the system, has been given £500 Mr A li Moore, a commission agent, had his arm and shoulder Êreatly injured, and waa notable to attend to is buainesB for nearly five months The jury have awarded him £2,500 There are some other claims still to be difposed of.

The Crown refused to prosecute, and Dr Jackson waa discharged An action was then com- menced by Mr. Hildor against Dr Jackson to recover from him a Bum of £100 which he bad lent to Dr. Jackson in March, April, and May laBt year The case came on for trial in the Supreme Court lately Dr. Jackson, who IB now in practice near Adelaide, attended and gave evidence.

before the lariff CommiEBion on the 2nd inst He stated that, in common with other mauufac turers of heavily protected articles he desired the free admission of various materials which v ero indispensable to his industry, and that if relief could be afforded him in that direc tion he could view with equanimity the total abolition of protection He had a largo and increasing export trade, arid waa conBe quently under the necessity of competing a_ainst the world in the open market of Sydney It was only by the system of draw back a that ho could get along at all, and if they were abolished and a duty placed on harnesB mountings, ho would have to move ucross tho border Ho desired more particularly that bogskina and all kinds of saddletrees should be admitted free, but while expresaing his personal aympathj for freedom of trade in many articles, he dis claimed anj desire to interfere with their pro duction in this colony should it be proved that there waa a reasonable chance of success On 'luesdaj, the 7th inst, the commissioners sut at Castlemaine and In ere town At the former place Mr David ihompson. member of a local firm of engineora and ironfounderB, gave some interesting evi- dence relative to the effect of the pre sent tariff on his business He asserted that, so far as the Bupenor class of engines was concerned, his firm could compete with the beet Lnghsh makera, but there waa a large number of wretchedly made engines a_ainst which it was almost |impossib!e to compete It was only against those that bia firm wiBhed to be protected TOOIB, he further stated, such as turning lathes and planing machineB, could_be made by his firm about as cheap as thej could be imported, but this statement was questioned by tho subsequent witness, Mr Horwood, another local iron founder Mr Horwood desired free trade pure and Bimple, and aatd that he would like to see the country Hooded with machi nerj of all kinds, for its utilisation would give a direct impetus to industries of every description, and his business would be natur Uly benefited in consequence He found that at present it paid him better to repair machinery than to make it, as British manufacturers could turn it out about 50 percent cheaper than Victorian makers At Fryerstown the commissioners heard the evidence of Mr E W H Rowe, one of the firm of Rowe Brothers,an extensivo mine owner and president of the local shire, to gether with Mr Mills, legal manager of several companies, Mr Elsbury, mining manager, and Mr James Reid, J P , mer- chant and agriculturist. Their evidence was all in favour of a reduction of the existing duties on mining machinery, fuse, powder, candles, and other articles, Mr Reid supplementing the list by the addition of all patent agricultu- ral machinery, cornsacks, and other articles exclusively used by farmers, stating that, as a quid pro quo, all the so called protective duties on articles produced in his district might be swept away at once. On the following day the commissioners sat at Maldon, and heard the evidenco of a large number of farmers, miners, and others interested in the operation of tho present fiecal policy The evidence of the farmers and glaziers waa not entirely unanimous, but the preponderance of the testimony went to show that absolute freedom of trade would be varuily welcomed m the farming districts of Maldon, Baringhup, and the Loddon '1 he Block tax was condemned by Mr Nichol, a farmer and grazier, who stated that tho small farmers depended to a great extent on a com- bination of farming and grazing, and the imposition of tbe tax had checked the impor tation of store cattle and sheep from Riverina the fattening of which sometimes yielded 90 or 100 per cent within a few months Another farmer declared that ho was on principle a thorough freetrader, but that BO long aa Melbourne people imposed duties for their own benefit, the farmers should cer- tainly have a little share of protection A third witness, Mr Mapson, of Muckleford, declared in favour of protection THIS DROUGHT The drought has beon daily becoming more aeriouB, itB effectB having been aggravated by exceeBive heat. In many parta of thecountry the residents bave been entirely dependent for a supply of water for domestic purposes on daily water trains despatched by the Go- vernment to their neighbourhood lu other parts dry localities have been supplied by means of pumpa which tho Government have furniBbed, and which have transferred water from ono or two rivera into amaller and dry watercourses It is a peculiarity of some of the rivers of Australia that they feed instead of being fed by creeks, the latter running at a lower level Several augers supplied by the Go vernment, have been also used in boring for water in other parts, and in some instances a good supply haB been obtained by that means Notwithstanding the exer- tions of the Government and othors, how- ever, there has been and is great distress amongst the selectors in the north and north western districts and many of them have had to temporarily abandon their homesteads and camp on the rivers still running In the meantime, water is becoming ecarcer every day One reBulfc of the drought is an outbreak of opthalmia in the country districts, which has beon par ticularly noticeable amongst the juvenile population Tor Borne days there have been Bigns that the drought is breaking up, and on Tuesday some rain fell in Melbourne Large numbers of Btock have perished through the drought _ CRICKET.

Shaw tried all his bowlerB, amongst whom Midwinterand Bates were the moBt aucceas ful, the former getting four, and the latter three wickets. In their Becond inningB the Englishmen batted splendidly, and at the cloBe of play for the day had lost only two wicket for 238J runs Ulyett played a fiue innings for G4, and Barlow, who waB thrown out from the long field, anjequally perfect in- nings for 50 Bates and Selby both carried out their bats, the former with 52 to hia credit, and the latter with 48 No chancea vveremiSBcd during the play, and the batting waa faultless all round. On the following day, Tuesday, the match nun to have been continued, but ram fell for the greater part of the day, and as tbe follow- ing day was occupied by the Australiana in preparation for their departure m the mail steamer Aeeam on Thursday, the contest could not be completed, and, therefore, re- sulted m a draw. VICTORIA V SOUTH AUSTRALIA On the same day that the international match waB commenced in Melbourne, another important cricketing conteat was in progresa at Adelaide, the competing teams being elevens of Victoria and South Australia, and the match the usual intercolonial between these colonies. As several of the beBtVic tottan playera wero included in the Aua Italian team, and othere were unable to under- take the trip to the sister colony, tho team doing battle for Victoria was only a second rate one The South Australians took the wicketa first, and were all disposed of for 119, Jarvis, a member of the last Australian Lleven, being chief Bcorer with 33, whileT O Richards came next with 21 M Shane, who it waa thought would be included in the AuBtrahan Eleven, performed exceedingly well with the ball, getting six wickets at the coBt of 42 runa The Victorian Eleven made a verj poor diBpla}, and were all out for 10G, Turner 34, Morris 28, and Stokes 12, being the only double figures Quilt}, who waB only included in the South Australian team at the last moment, bowled splendidly for his colony, getting nino of the Victorian wickets at a cost of 55 runs In the second innings of the South Aus- tralian team they improved considerably on their first performance, obtaining a total of 200 before the last wicket fell Tho highest Bcorers were J Noel G1, F, King 31, A, H Jarvis 33, and J E Gooden not out 27. The wicketB were about equally divided between M'Shano, Turner, Scott, and Macka} The Victorians in their second innings required 213 runs to win, but they fell short of that number by 31 runB, and thus Buffered defeat. Stokes, of the Richmond Club, who has ob- tained the best batting average of the Beaaon in challenge cup matches, waa the chief Bcorer, with 58, while Patemon and Trapp come next with 32 each After the conclusion of their match with the Australian Eleven, Shaw's team of pro feeaional cricketers play at Ballarat and Dunolly, these contests bringing their tour of the colonies to a conclusion THE AUSTRALIAN ELEVEN. The third Australian Eleven take their departure for England in the mail steamer Assam, which sails to morrow, The team consista of the following players -Banner- man, Garrett, Jones, Massie, Murdoch, and Spoffortb, from New South Wales, Boyle, Bonnor, Blackham, Horan, and Palmer, from Victoria , and Giffen, from South Australia. Evans ia the only representative Australian cricketer not included in the team, otherwise the team is the' strongest that can be got together m AuBtraha, bowling being its weakest point There are only three playera in the present combination who bavo not been included in former elevens, viz , MaBBie, Giffen, and Jonea, all first class pla} era, tho two latter being ablo to bowl well, although batting is their strong point. In AuBtrahan cricketing circles general regret ¡B expressed at the absence of Evans. He IB a bowler who ia never punished oven on the most perfect wicket, and the members of Shaw'B team believe that he would bo one of the most successful bowlers on an English wicket No eleven from which he is excluded can be called a representative Australian team Mr C W, Beale, of New South Wales, goes with tbo team in the capacity of manager.

A return has just been prepared ahowing the immigration and emigration of New ¿aa land during the month of January, 1882 From this it appears that 130 persons arrived in tho colony from Great Britain, 017 from tho Australian colonies, and 93 from other places , total, 1190 On tho other hand, 72 persona left New Zealand for Great Britain, 355 for the Australian colonies, and 03 for placea ; total, 490 Thus the net gain to the colony during the month was 700 Too 150 English arrivals included 13 Government no ruinated immigrants, and the 355 departures for the Australian colonies included 13 Chinese, It IB stated in the papera that the Budget will show an indisputable surplus of fully £100,000, as all branches of revenue are working up surprisingly There has been a remarkable increase in the railway receipts It was thought that the splendid return (£77,000) for tho four weeks ended 7th January, was mainly due to the exceptional traffic during the holidays, but aubsequent leturna are even more favourable propor tionately. It is now believed by those beat qualified to form an opinion, that the gross receiptB for the year will exceed £800 000, if indeed, they do not very nearly reach £900,000, jet, three months ago nobody an- ticipated that more than £375,000 would bo the total. This is a great improvement The working expenses show a Bteady decrease, and so far as can be calculated at present, the year's net profit will be quite £400,000 A large meeting was held at Cambridge on rebruarj 27 for the purpose of presenting an address to the Premier, and affording the natives an opportunity of bringing several mattera under Ins notice There was a very large attendance of natives and Furopeaiis The natnes congratulated the Premier on his arrival and thanked him for his visit Tho MaoriB thoroughly approved of the Thermal Springs Act of last session, and expected it would be the means of providing n living for themselves and their children Other complimentary remarks to Parliament wound up with "God Save the Queen." The Premier replied in terms which elicited strong marks of approval from both Maoris and _,uropeans He thanked the natives for their cordial welcome, and reminded them there could onlybeone&overeign; for tho people of thia country-namely, the Queen, whose desire it was to promote the welfare and happineaa of both races There was a Par liament to enact laws, and in this Parlia- ment there were nativ o representatives The duty of Ministers waa to carry out the laws which Parliament made.. Ile expressed pleasure at the natives' approval of the Thermal Spring Act Ile would lay the address before Parliament ne then asked the leading chiefs to explain thoir grievances to him. Seveial important matters aro being diBCussed A similar meeting waa held on the following daj at Ohiaemnta, the Maoris addressed the Premier for two boura With regard to the licensing law, the prohibition against supplying Maoris wa9 objected to bj them. They also wanted a school 03tab halted to teach their boys European traJes The Premier promised consideration of their request.
