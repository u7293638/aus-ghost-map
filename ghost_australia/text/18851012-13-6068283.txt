VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB. CAULFIELD GUINEAS DAY. Again the Victoria Amateur Turf Club was unfortunate in having a wet, disagree- able day for the opening of its spring; meeting at Caulfield Last year, it will be remembered, rain fell right through the day, and although there were longer stretches of fine weather on Saturday, the rain came at in- convenient periods generally, when the starter had just taken charge of his fields Up to 9 o'clock it seemed probable that the racing would have been got through with nothing more unpleasant than a threatening sky, so that the rain did not seriously affect the attendance Those leahy anxious to see the races for the Guineas and the Great Foal Stakes probably remembered that Caulfield is the best course in Australia for wet weather racing Although it was bleak and low bidding overhead, there was no discomfort under foot, the gross in the reserves having been cut so short that it held no moisture, and the porous soil nb sorbed the show ers as quickly as they fell The attendance was actually the largest yet seen on a Guineas day at Caulfield, and but for the unfavourable picture of the morning, the best Caulfield Cup statistics would certainly have been beaten The returns show that 3,81 people went out to the course by nil, and that 1 327 paid at the gates. On such a day it can be understood that the additions recently made to the stand were appreciated, but even the increased space was not equal to the demand for it when races were run during a falling shower With the abolition of the charge for admis Bimi, the outer stand came into immediate favour, but those more keenly interested in the racing preferred to muster, as usual, in the open opposite the weighing room, and a birdseye view of this portion of the course would have shown only an area of umbrellas The luncheon was not up to the Flemington standard of excellence, the caterer having entirely under estimated the demand for every sort of refreshment, but beyond this the public had no cause for complaint, all the arrangements for the racing being excellent At half-past 1 starters were called out in the middle of a heavy) shower for the Maiden Plate and a field of 10 seemed to indicate that the new scale of weights was regarded with favour by racing men The South Australians made Jocular a strong favourite, and put their money on the horse so freely that he left the paddock with the short eczema or C to 1 as the best offer against him there was very little speculation about the others Mr T Watson, who again took the starting ling in his Fathers place, got the lot oil after a couple of false starts, and for the greater part of the journey it seemed that Jocular had the race whenever he wished to go to the front and claim it by the time the turn was reached the Ballarat hone Jfccnll was alongside, and as soon as they commenced to race in earnest the south Australian was palpably beaten Recall strode along in a very taking sty) le and won by a good four lengths The inner ran second to Seahorse a few days ago for the B ii larat Handicap, and but that the former spoiled his qualifications as a maiden b) that victory), he would probably have won the event under notice just as he pleased, and it is a little surprising that, under the circumstances I recall had not a warmer support from the several "good judges of a racehorse connected with the Dowling Forest stable 1 exact!) a eleven saddled for the Hurdle Race, and Durations recent performance

together Anything like heavy) betting was limited to the three, and the triangular match created a great amount of interest There was a long delay at the post and rarely) has a field given the starter more trouble than this one The riders seemed determined to risk everything in order to get away, and time after time they anticipated the fall of the li ing by breaking away Acme at first stood at the post like a veteran but before they final 1) got away every rider had offended more or less After about a dozen breaks the Hag went down, and a glance at the mass of rustling colours as the one 'waters rushed down to the turn showed Clehn, Lottie, Anita and Munwyrtina as the leading division and Acme, being taken by Hales right round on the outside in order to get up she had the lead as they swung round for home and seemed like winning hands down, but the sun and Munwyrtina backed up their challenge with such good effect that Hale a back to wake up Acme within a few strides at home The

The two fillies Melodious and Jumma raced for the lead down towards the sod wall, but after passing that point Dunlop ain went to the front, while Ring master crept up towards the leaders As they approached the turn, Monte Christo could make no response to Hales efforts to rouse him and the favourite was beaten a quarter of a mile from home Dunlop came round the head with a lead, and looked like winning but Ringmaster at once coal leased the big horse, and, racing past him in the finest style won the Guineas by two lengths and a half from Dunlop Eagle Grange who pegged along persistently all through, ran into third place at the finish 1 minister, who 12 months ago made a name by winning the Great 1 coal Stakes has Several times a nice run in second rate form and but for his fine Performance in the mile race at Flemington a little over a week ago which threw some light on his real merit, would have started for this race with very little support from the general public As it was there was little to choose between him and Monte Christo in the betting, and the victory was consequently popular Monte Christo was never in the face from the start, and the sorry figure he cut should have the chief limiting Mr W hit«, s choice of a Derby) winner from his string of three year olds 'The Australian Hunters Cup brought out an excellent field of 14 horses and amongst them Narrung, who in Mr W Glasscock had a good horseman to steer him, and in its backed with great confidence, finishing at the short odds of 5 to 2 The race was a very good exhibition, the only horses that came to grief being Cunositv, Jack Sheppard, and Gold Top Gippslander led from the start, going as straight as possible, and never making the slightest mistake a per- formance in marked contrast to the recent exhibition of temper at Ballarat He was plucky), but by no means artistically ridden, and tired to nothing at the finish Nearly all the horses were in the same plight, however, Narrung, who took the lead at the finish, going through instead of over the brush, with a shock that almost knocked him off his legs. He cantered home a six lengths winner from the tired Gippslander, while Abdallah, who also shot his bolt in a run towards the rush, was a poor third, the others struggling home am how Another excellent field came out for the Toorak Handicap for which Sirocco had a warm support from his stable, who it was said looked upon the winning of this event as a preliminary to the appropriation of the Caul held Cup Even Cracknell s energetic riding could not, however, bring Sirocco to the front the finish being left to Too Too and Mentmore The latter ran unkindly and bored in so, that his n 1er bud to strain hard on the right rein, and it was only by giving the horse his head just at the proper moment that he won by abend A protest was entered by the rider of Too Too, on the ground that Mentmore shot across in front of his mare at the turn in and interfered with her, but as Too loownsfirstinto the straight, and Mentmore beat her fairly in the run home, the judges decision was not disturbed The following are the details of the racing - 31 JULY PLATE, Of 1.0 sons with as constancy of 3 sen 8. each added One mile.
