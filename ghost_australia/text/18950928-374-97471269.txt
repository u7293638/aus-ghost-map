Wemay transfer the scene from Acacia Cottage to a private room inGuy's Hotel, i <fi8t. Jamef8 Street—an establishment veryold-faahioned and rather dingy, but renowned in certain circles.

Max looked down from his window on a paved court heading to Pall Mali, which . the^sun -only tipped inpassing. A dozen games and spectacles which he lopged to \- see were advertised in the morningpapers. But honour or dignity commanded 'him to wait.ior the■ avenger. Max swore and famed, but never thought'of deserting his post before, the hour he had fixed. Wandering impatiently about the room, lie presently 'noticed someone moving itnpktiently in the court below—a big, ! square, man, so muffled that bis features I could ^lot ,bs identified from the first floor •1 in'lw k narrow' space.

Max had no solicitor, he was_ verybusy now, in his way, and he returned noaaswer. Some dayB afterwards he met an old schoolfellow, no it a lawyer's cleric, who had Been the stoiy in the newspapers— who -didnot at ihat iime? With, the frankneBB> of his yearaiahd station, Jim Leatherhead .asked details. A»d Max was ready enough to |^ve them. - ' * lib was all a plant,' he Baid. 'I make nodoubt that old Mumaonconcocted his scheme as soon as ever he got possession of me-^and that's before I can recollect. He didn't send me to a proper school ^-not for a rr inan of my fortune—afraid I should learn too much. I understand it all now. He never gavetae the slightest hint of my expectations.* No One inCap persley was so astonished as I when Knight told -ine thetruth lastFebraarythetwenty firstj the day I came xif age, I was regu larly taught to rail Lnqy my little wife— mind you, Lucy isn't in the swindle ? She was to be a victim, too. Why, Jim ! I can make the whole story clear in two words!—I never proposed to her in my life?' * That's good ! If you could only prove it I' 'lean prove something as effectual. Mrs. Mumson just took it for granted we were going to marry, and—I really don't knowhow she managed; Exactly. It's awful to think what a greenhorn I was ! But then, yon know, Lucy is a charming girl, and 1 had no reason to suspect a plot, being ignorant of my fortune.' 'Poor lamb! Led to the altar without even a kick ! But when it came to fixing theday, you must have, had words with Miss ■■MumsonT ' But I hadn't? The . morning after I came of age the old woman met me, hold-, ing Lucy by the hand, and says she,' I've consulted my dear girl. She feels herself very young to be a wife. But considering huw longyou have been engaged, I tefl her, you seem quite elderly people—or words to that effect.' ' Tour Mrs. Mumson is a oner 1 And what did the young lady say ? \- 1 Nothing that I recollect. She let me kisB her,, and poured out tea. Tou see Jim, it wasn't an ordinary case—we had been talking of marriage for weeks, if not exactly for years. Well, very soon after* that, all the chaps began to tell me whatft fool I was—and I saw it plainly enough. But perhaps I should have gone on for all that if Lucy hadn't given me to understand pretty clearly that she was not more anxious to many than I was. When I went to kiss her she would say, 'Oh, we shall have enough of that pre sently.' There were lots of little things like that, though we didn't meet so very often. I spb^e more than once very seriously, but she ran away. At last—it was onlythree days before the wedding— she broke out suddenly,'Why are we going to be married, Max?—and ran away, as usual. * I thought it out, Jim, that night. If I had broken out in the regular way, Lucy would have pud for it. But nobody could blame her if I bolted from the church door ; and she would be happy. That's what I did 1 And now you have all the story.' * There's another chapter to come, un fortunately, if Mrs. Mumson pursues her action. . Twelve thick-headed British householders won't be very ready to ac cept your defence, I warn you.' 4 But they will be satisfied with Lucy's evidence. Look at this!' He produced the letter which Captain Brailston would not read. It had no date, but the post-mark was ' Cappersley, April 23rd'—the very day of the scandal. ' My dear Max, - ' 1 understand your conduct, and it is noble. Never mind what mamma i does, or makes me do. £ shall,always be grateful to you.—Lucy.' ' Oh, this is grand! I say, don't hand it in to your lawyer and spoil the dramatic situation 1 Just keep dark, and slap it down when the plaintiffs case is concluded. By-the-bye, who are your lawyers f ' Your people, if you like ! I haven't any.' ' That's kind of you, Petherick. Will yuu call on us to-morrow ? Not a word about .this letter, though, I'll seal it up and keep it safe ready for use at the proper moment.' * AUright! Batlcan'tbebothered to call. Send me what papers are necessary to en able you to act, and I'll sign them.' So it was done. . <And. then Max started on that ' pro gress' whichyoung men of spirit, and of property, almost always drift into when brought up in ignorance of their future 'tortune. H his was not a bad case, tem perament s&vea; him. He disliked tosit anddrink; the youth so constituted will escapemore perns than drunkenness, and graver.. But Max soon learned to si£ and gamble. No vice is so useful for lifting a .man into society, if he have the means to support it, a pleasant ~adcU$ss, and the opportunity to drop into a good; circle at the beginning. . Max secured that advan tage—a questionable oneindeed—through some chance acquaintances at Guy's Hotel. Before many weeks paseied he found him self a member of the * Thoroughbred Club.' Gambling is as fair at that renowned es tablishment as it can ever be where grey vetaraus, men who live for play, and men who live by ,it, contend with hot and thoughtless youth, ~ The action proceeded in due course* but ^j8®^ly_jfeojutht of it. Mra. .MumBon claimed £10,000 damages. Butjfieeiid of the Long Yacation seemed ages dis tant. Some months he spent in high latitudes on board his friend Long Palgrave's yacht. As autumn closed in, they turned to the Mediterranean, and presently, of course, being members of the Thoroughbred, they looked in at Monte Carlo. The demon of gambling possessed him entirely now. Lord Palgrave, who had followed his play, departed with manysuperfluous thousands. Max was persuaded to accompany him as far as Naples. But there the fascination became irresistible. He returned to Monte Carlo. And then, of course, luck turned; to that, shape which is deadliest of all. Sometimes he won prodigiously, as of old; sometimes he lost. The seesaw proved fatal. When he fled at last, with a des ' perate effort, half his fortune had vanished. At that price Max finished his education. It had been fasfcin: gave up gambling for ever, an.d: took bis name off the books of the Thoroughbred dub. He meant to woife £or his livelihood now, and his Mends must be workers henceforward. After deliberation, Max resolved to take up law again. Vastly astonished were Mb solicitors when tiieir client begged admission asan articled clerk. That must stand orer till the suit should be decided. _ The suit was an eternal pre-occnpation bowl Should he feel the loss must be very serioos j and that escapade at Monte Garlowould prejudice anyjury agauurithim. Still, theycould not ignoreXucy'a own declaration of gratitude for' the breach which was herground of action—that is her mother's. He constantly rehearsed the scene to "be expected when Mar * slapped down' the letter, the existence of which had not been revealed to-any one. \- But Jim's dramatic fancy waB too realistic. The picture be drew forced: Max to think. HoW mean to shield him self behind a letter which an unsuspecting girl wrote from the fulness of her heart! j She would be there-1—obliged to own | before all the Court that the claim was an attempted swindle ? Had Lucy borne a willing part in it, indeed, the;case< would, be very different. But he kneVTBhe -was coerced by her mother. And then^ how: savagely that harridan would avenge her disappointment on the poor child 1 • | It shbnld not be! Without apprising' Leatherhead,Maxrecovered the letjjpr andforwarded it to tjucy with just one word of explanation. And he never re gretted the act for a moment. Total ruin might follow. But he had behaved as a gentleman should. It became more and more evident, how ever, on reviewing the circumstances, that Buccess must depend on his own personal testimony. And what was that worth, after Monte Oarlo ! A great deal less than nothing 1 The fight was hopeless there fore. Gradually Max came to a conclusion. He could not bring himself to offer a com promise, as counsel suggested. Besides, he felt sure it would be useless. But he would not submit to the indignity of an appearance which would make bad worse. There was no need to provoke discussion by apprising his lawyers of this resolve. (To be continued).
