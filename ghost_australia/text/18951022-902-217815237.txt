Searching for a Ghost. AN extraordinary scene was witnessed during the early hours of the morning in the church yard of the parish of St. John, at Hackney, re cently, when fully a thousand men and women turned out from their houses in the neighbor- hood to bunt for a supposed ghost. For some time people passing through the church yard late at night have been startled by the appear ance of 'a ghost.' Women have fainted with fright, and the local newspapers have published accounts of the strange affair. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the night a mixed crowd began to assemble at the rear of the church where 'the ghost' was supposed to be, and where in the usual way scarcely anyone passed after about 11 o'clock. A long wait until midnight, and then, as no ghost appealed, the crowd went in search of it. Armed with lanterns and candles, and carrying sticks and stones, the crowd climbed the railings from the pathways and took possession of the burial ground. Graves &Dd; tombstones were clambered oyer, and recently restored mounds were trampled down. A portion of the crowd looked upon the affair as a joke, and consequently every few minutes the cry was raised of 'There it goes 1' and im mediately the whole crowd rushed in the direc tion indicated. Others amused themselves by making the night hideous with imitations of unearthly crieB, aud altliough the police were requisitioned to clear the place, it was not until the verge of daylight that the last few strag. glers went away. The damage to the graves was very great, and efforts will be made to pre vent any further demonstrations. Many com. plaints were made by those present of having their pockets picked.
