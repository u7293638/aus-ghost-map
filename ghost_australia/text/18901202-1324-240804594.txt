B A E F O L D . {FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) The concert in aid of the Barfold Sun- day school took place on the evening of Wednesday last, and was a greater success than the teachers anticipated. 1 .' The programme was lengthy and; everyfnumber was well rendered, and . the 21st and last number, by Mr J. Anderson, had to be Tepiecitea. The opinion óf all is that Mr Anderson's rendering'of " Old England •and:1|ie:New' J beats any-previous record. The same might :almoBt he said of each one who, assisted- during the evening. Shortly summarised the local verdict is as 'follows :—Of Miss Clark, we.would very much like to hear her again; of Miss Purton, .sweetly- rendered; of Miss' -M'Eindley^ too much cannot "be saidin her praise I Miss S. M'Koight appeared for the fint-time as a public singer, and was well received ; Miss Hamilton sustained .the high opinion which we have always held of her; also Messrs Horefield, Manley, and W. and E. Sunderland merit more than a word of praise, pnethirdjof ,the nnmberson the-programme were recitations, each of which was 1 well rendered^- particularly so .''The Bridge of Sig"hs," by'Miss R.
