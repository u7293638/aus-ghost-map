THE SN1W. Lo I what wonders the day hath wrought Born of the soft and slumbrous snow ; Gradually silent, slowly wrought ; Even as an artist thought by thought - Writes expression on lip and brow. Hanging garlands the leaves o'erbrim, Deep drifts smother the paths below; The elms are shrouded, trunk and limb, And all the air is dizzy and dim With a whirl of dancing, dazzling snow. Dimly out of the baffled sight Houses and churoh-spires stretch away The trees, all spectral and still and white, Stand up like ghosts in the failing light, And fade and fain with the blinded day. Down from the roofs in gusts are hurled The eddying drifts to the waste below; And still is the banner of storm unfurled, Till all the drowned and desolate world Lies dumb and white in a trance of snow. Slowly the shadows gather and fall, Still the whispering snowfakes beat; N;ghs and darkness are over all; esat, pale city, beneath their pall I Sleep, white world, mn.thy winding-sheet. Clouds may thicken and. storm winds breathe; On my wall is a glimpse of R3me Land of my longing?!--nd underneath Swings and txembles my olive wreath ; Peaos and I are at home I FLOauxesu Paxe..
