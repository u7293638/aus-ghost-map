Melbourne Town, Hall.. The attendance..was very lairge His Worship the Mayor -(Mr 0. ewriicic)' occupied the chair; On the 'orchestra a number of the children of the .asylum were seated; and the rather dry .details., necessarily related at such a meeting -were agreeably interspersed with 'songs 'ad music by some of these children, while others (male and feinale) showed their proficiency in basket and net malting, knitting,. &c.; .The proceedings were opened-,with prayer by the Rev H., N. 'Wollaston, after -which the chairman de Slivered a brief address, in which he recom .mended- the- institution to the support of the public. The report' stated that at the close of 'i870 tlhere were seventy-six blind inmates . in the asylum. The number of admissions 'during .1871 was 11; two boys, whose sight had been restored by operations, had returned to their friends, "making the total iGinumber now in the house 85-being 62 toys, and 33 girls. Great necessity for .increasýed" acommodation had been felt' by the' committee for soine time," and the liberality of the ex-Mayor of Melbourne, Mir T. M'Pheerson, who defrayed the entire cost of concert in the Town Hall, given in aid of the building fund, the proceeds of whic.h were .£500 18s 4d, placed' the committee in a position.. to enter' into "a contract, for 'the- erection of 'additional buildings, to be called the M'?hersoii wing, which were. expected to be fit for occupa tion early in March. This. addition' will griealy add to the comfort of the inmates, and: relieve the boy's dormitory, w;-hich is now :considerably over crowded. It will also give additional accommodation for stock, and supply a.want:at present much felt, viz,; a show and sale. room for goods manufactured by the inmates.. ;The. com mittee had, in. June-.last, engaged the services'of Mr P. ;Holt,.. as basket. maker, to instruct the elder boys, and:that'branch of industry :was now. progressing satis factorily. , ;The. friends .of :.the .asylum ;were; invited to visit it,. to see the basket fanufucturing, and purchase the baskets, they being sold at moderate prices. Mats, net;s,,;and knittiig,. made at the,, asylum, may also be .purchased there, or at the following .dep6ts: .- Mr - Cowlishaw, Prahran;- Mr.Benjamin Lee, Melbourne.; Messrs. Bright 'and Hitchcock,, Geelong; and Messrs Christie, Ballarat. On the invitation of Mr Ducker, mayor of Geelong, and'Mir R. Lewis, mayor of Ballarat, 'con cer s, were 'given by thirty-three of tie blrind children in each of those places'in 0Qtober last, and resulted in net proceeds ini aid of the building fund of £185' ls 10d. The'committee referred with sorrow to the death 'of' three co-workers-the Rev -. Miackie, the hoit .G-; Rolfe, and Mr D. O~ilvy." "During "the' year an important charige has been made in the staff of the adsylumn. For reasons which it was not necessary to paiticularise,A Mr and Mrs Robinsniono.longer held the 'position 'of superintendent and matron, their conhiec tioh;with'the asylum ceasing in' December. The : ~ffices 'of' 'superintendent and head teacher had been separated, the increase in the number of inmates rendering it almost impossible for one person to discharge the duties of both offices. The committee had appointed' Mr and Mrs Drummond,. of Ballarat; ',as superintendent and' matron; and . Mr' M'Phee as' head teacher; and there was every ground for believing that the results would be satisfactory. The Parliament had voted £1000' .towards the same: object.' The health of the -inmates continued good, and the cominittee bore grateful testimony: to. the unremitting attention of the honorary medical staff to the duties undertaken by them.: ..:: '-,.,The financial statement showed--Re ceipts in connection .with the building fund:-Donations for buildings, £384 Os Sd'; proceeds of concert 'given at Town Hall by Mr T.
