SPIRITUALISM. Prof. G. G. Zerffi, in his new work " Spiritualism and Animal Magnetism," attempts to prove thatall phenomena, whether in the spiritual or material world, must be the - mere effect ef some causes. That we have an organ in us that can act oil the perceptive faculties of the brain from within. That this is the organ of dreams. That dreams may be classed 'as follows : dreams without meaning, half-dreams, theorematio dreams, alle gorical dreams, somnambulic dreams, -clairvoyant dreams, visionary dreams. That the organ of dreams has its Beat in the ganglionic system of nerves. That this organ may be acted upon from without. That there can _ be no such phenomena as spiritual manifestations from an objective point of view, but that they are all subjective. That spectral visions are the products of the disturbed balance between posi tive and negative magnetism. That persons in whom the negative magnetism is predominant, see, hear, smell, feel, taste,. and even think, what ever an individual charged with positive mag netism wills. That there is not a single accre dited ghost story, spectral vision, or spiritual manifestation, that could not be explained from a natural point of view. That the trade in spiritualism should be stopped by law, as it is a crime againBt society, demanding as much re pression as the trade in fortune- telling, for one credulity deserves aB much support as another.
