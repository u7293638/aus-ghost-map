MR. JOHN HAYNES WANTS A WELLINGTON. HE IS LIKELY TO FIND A WATERLOO. If the ghosts of men's past political deeds did rise up against them, it would be found that many of our political candidates would not only have a parliamentary skoleton in the cupboard, but a whole grave-yardful in the cellar too. They don't, however, and for this pleasant certainty Mr. John Hayne3 may ask the Lord to make him truly thankful.' John is now one of the most faithful followers of the venerable gentleman who has a patron saint — Saint Leonards — and who hungers for office with a degree of voracity exceeded only by a' Siberian wolf during a Russian winter. But at one time the Samsen of 'public life was not so true to that hairy chieftain. At one time ho ran a paper called Haynes Weekly, and in this he used to speak of Parkes in the language of tho men of Table Mountain. Likening the ex-Premier's face to a cheese in which there was a lump for a nose and a gash for a mouth was only one of the able editor's freaks of penmanship. His attacks on Parkes in those days wero as frequent, and painful, and free as, of late, they haven't been. John is now about to meet his Wellington. We have a very shrewd idea that he will find his Waterloo also — as Napoleon found it when John Haynes was one of the great unknown .
