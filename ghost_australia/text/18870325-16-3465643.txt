®he BRISBANE COURIER FRIDAY, MARCH 25, 1887. The, general feeling now in New South Wales with regard to the Parkes Govern ment is peculiar Sir Herny owes his pre sent " pride of place to two causes The first of these is personal. Of the past Government the country had had too much , of the present Government it knew too little to inspire it with confidence It was utterly sick of the humiliating spectacle presented by the impotent series of Governments which followed so thick and fast on the break up of Stuart Dalley combination Sir John Robertson was clearly hors de combat Sir Henry Parkes name called up the remembrance of the strongest Go vernments within present memory His ability was incontestable , his energy was clearly unexhausted It was true that, in those late Parliamntary proceedings which had turned the New South Wales Assembly into a disreputable bear garden, and made its name a byword among us all, he had played a part only too conspicuous But the public is, despite overything, immensely tolerant, and especially if it is in real need of the assistance of the sinner Public opinion, when it rises above the level of in difference, leaps to boiling point, and then drops correspondingly low The law that action and reaction equals its opposite, is truer nowhere than in the sphere of politics A politician's career is a ceaseless alternation between wild oats and hard work The recklessness of Opposition is tempeted by the responsibility of office. Who has forgotten the wild youth of Disraeli. Who does not remember the sobering effect high officialdom had only the other day on Lord Randolph Churchill ? So, at least, New South Wales argued, and in appealing to Sir Henry Parkes it pathetically asked him to remember past dignity, and lift the Legislative procedure of the mother colony out of the mud The great, the pressing question, of course, was the financial one, and on his settlement or non settlement of this Sir Henry's lease of popularity and power manifestly rested The country was ready to trust itself to Sir Henry, to return him to office, to install him, and give him a fair" chance of doing himself justice. But that was all. The country wanted Parkes in the place, but they wanted him there, not in permanency, but on approval. It is not surprising that, to so old a political hand as Sir Henry, and one who has been playing a desperate and dreary game so long, such a prospect was the reverse of acceptable. Sir Henry wanted, not a political constitutional monarchy, but political despotism. He had had this once, he would have it again. He is the professional politician, the man with the craving for office and patronage. Weak Governments seem to him only pleasant when they are other people's, and can be used as stepping-stones to strong Government for himself. His stone-walling policy against the Jennings Administration had made, as he has just astonished everyone by admitting, Parlia- mentary Government impossible. He saw that to attempt himself to form an Admi- nistration out of the materials to hand was absurd. He saw more. He saw that to form a strong Administration it was neces- sary to have a strong party question. Our political parties tend ceaselessly to tone off into one another -with a frightful rapidity. We have no Whigs and Tories, we have not even Liberals and Conservatives as they understand them in Europe. We are all Liberals. Sir Henry looked about for a strong cry for a general election, and found one ready to hand. He declared the Jennings financial schemes were treason against the fiscal policy of the country. He suddenly found in this an excuse for that past impossible stone-walling policy of his. He declared there was a conspiracy on baud to smuggle protection into the Legislature against the wish of the country. He was always a good hand at raising ghosts. The danger of pro- tection was practically speaking nu. The result of the elections have proved it. The Protectionists were not in the least prepared for a set contest at the polls. It was true that one of their organs had trumpeted out defiance and assurance of victory, but it had been doing that any time these six years. Sir Henry Parkes forced the hand of pro- tection in order to get himself a large majority, and he succeeded. The success, however, decisive as it appears, is airead beginning to show signs of its actual character. The community begins to perceive that the real vital question, the financial question, has been passed by. Sir B enry's programme stands manifest as one of negatives, Having found out the pro- tection bogey, people are beginning to ask themselves whether they have not been fooled with a side issue ? Disillusionment is in the air. Moreover, Sir Henry has not, after all, been sobered by office, but apparently the reverse. No two worse samples of doses of undiluted Billingsgate have been offered to the unhappy legislative genius of Now South AVales than those pro- duced by the recent Parkes-0'Hara and the Parkes-Dibbs combats. Sir Henry wholly lost control of himself, and Hung mud only the thicker and harder for the height from which he aimed it. Genial epithets like '. cur " and " reptile " do not sound well in the mouth of a Premier who was to restore the lost dignity of the Legislati ve debate. Nor is this all. Sir Henry's political ruse shows signs of turning against himself. It is becoming more aud moro manifest that this majority is only a majority on one question, that of free - trade, and now no one concerns himself in the least on that score. Those who do, however, those who perceive the time approaching when protection may actually be a problem that will have to be faced in New South Wales, bear Sir Henry no good- will for his unscrupulous use of the great cause in behalf of his mere personal gain. He has forced the hand of protection ; but, in making it an organised party, with a definite and fixed piirpose,he has madeit very formidable in a Parliament of little knots and gangs, who will pledge themselves to anything for a triumph over the others. Protectionists are now, as Mr. O'sullivan remarked, " a third of the House," and considering the peculiar formation of that House, that united and resolute third may yet play the powerful part that Mr. Parnell has played in England between the dis- membered Liberals and Radicals, and Tories and Conservatives. Altogether, then, things look far leas hopeful for the cause of good government in New South Wales than was supposed. The stability of the Parkes Administration ÍB quite questionable. Then, too, the mem- bers of the Cabinet can in no sense be said to bo satisfactory individually or as a body. The couutry will not long continue satisfied with negations on the financial question. After all, one really wonders if Sir Henry's clever ruse will achieve his object as well as, not to say better than, simple and straightforward grappling with this ques- tion would have done ? for on his settle- ment or non-settlement of it he will have to stand or fall, and that is just " the con- clusion of the whole matter." FROM the summer of 1878, when General Mesentzeff", chief of the Russian police, was struck down in his office by a fanatical disciple of Bacounin, until the autumn of 1884, when the terrorism he had invoked suddenly and mysteriously ceased, the Russian Nihilist was the central figure of Russian history, and the revolutionary movement was the most marked feature in Russian social life. St. Petersburg became a military camp ; every Russian was a spying on his neighbour, hundreds were executed, thousands imprisoned, and tens of thousands deported to Siberia. But in spite of the most desperate attempts to stamp it out, Nihilism lived and flourished, opening a prison here, " executing" a detested official there, undermining railways, exploding a mine in the palace itself ; at last scoring a dreadful victory by the horrible murder, on 13th March, 1881, of Czar Alexander II. After four years more of this terrorism came the lull of the past two years, which the Russian, police have claimed the result of their annihilation of the movement, but which now seems certainly to have followed a truce proclaimed by the revolutionary executive in order that the Czar might have opportunity to promulgate a constitution. It is also probable that the recent attempt signalises the close of these faithfully kept years of grace, and that the civilised world will once more watch with mingled sentiments of horror and admiration the savage war between an absolute bureaucracy and a secret society of revolutionists. And amid all the ruthless murders perpetrated by the one and the as ruthless cruelty perpetrated by the other, there looms up always the fear of the last resource of the revolutionists a course already formulated, wherein they claim a right to prevent their cause being finally lost by turning their dark weapons against all in authority, In the last struggle they murdered remorselessly,but never aimlessly every blow struck Was aimed at the heart of the absolutism, but at any time driven to bay, they may slaughter in discriminately policeman and chief of police, soldier, dvorbik, and Csar It is no wonder if, looking- at the work of this society, the world should forget the con ditions under which it exists, and the bitter wrongs it avenges, though these alone might plead for the excesses of Nihilism even if there were nothing commendable in it ultimate object Nihilism is little more than the absolutism has made it, it is the revolt of philosophical minds against most crush ing tyranny , it is a revolt which is-most peculiarly Russian The original Nihilist was a dreamy indi vidual, full of strange notions concerning the affections which he suppressed, and the intellect which he exalted He believed in reason, and he sacrificed himself to his belief with the dull but cherry hot passion that is an attribute of the Sclav. Tour genieff has painted him a Bazarov, the hero of " Fathers and Sons, and Stepniak accepts the portraiture , but this first " Nihilist has grown considerably since the days of Bazarov It was Bacounin who altered him, Bacounin, the Socialist Bacounin, the prophet of a deluge of blood, from which was to reappear the New Russia The old Nihilist sought to get rid of everything but individuality , then appealed the Inter nationale, the greatest revolutionary move ment of modem day's, and demanded from him his individuality, even to his life He surrendered The aristocratic Nihilist of the Bazarov school, the enthusiastic educa tionahist, the ardent student, the man who has stamped out the affections, and the woman in whom other affections take the place of those so rudely up rooted, were swept into the new creed It is this strange and fanatical mixture of intellect courage and patience which has made Nihilism what it is, and which the Czars have to fear Stepniak claims that the sympathies of the masses are with the movement but between every line the fact stares out that, as yet, Nihilism has made little or no impression upon the masses It is in relation to socio political life the Sclav version of that Socialistic movement which is worldwide, and which elsewhere relies for its future upon the inceasing intelligence of the workers In Russia there is no education whatever, except for a favoured few, and from these alone the Nihilists draw their recruits But the growth of Nihilism from a selfish philosophy to a superb self abnegation did not take place in a day All through the. decades of 1860 70, the change went on nurtured in Berne and Geneva, and gathering lmpetus even from the failure of the Paris Commune The propaganda, at first ridiculed, then laughed at, then passionately entered upon, went on in the great Russian cities until the Russian police awoke to the danger of the ideas which these white handed apostles of Bacounin were preacing It is useless for Nihilist writers to deny that even in those comparatively peaceful days then propagandist comrades preached a forcible revolution In fact, this is the idea continually hammered upon by Bacounin, the father of Nihilistic Socialism, his writings could not be disseminated without sowing the seeds of rebellion And this being so it can hardly be wondered at that the Russian Govern ment undertook the suppression of this revolutionary propaganda, although nothing can excuse the violence with which this suppression was conducted The Russian is patient, but the Nihilists patience was not strengthened by any reverence for the status quo and was soon tried too far Siberia and the knout, death for its men and worse than death for its women were the remedies presented for the cure of Nihilism But as we have pointed out, the very ideas of Nihilism made its followers above persecution Their philosophic con tempt for death, the sense of superiority -the supeiionty of the wise over the ignorant, the mad fanaticism which seethes under the stolidity of the Sclav, all urged on the terrorism The bloody executions and the horrible cruelties, hardly fit to be whispered, practised upon helpless prisoners, heaped on top of every thing else the stern desire for revenge The Nihilist took to dynamite, to dagger, and to poison, as a Frenchman takes to the barricade what can one expect when there is both a despotism and a Bakounin It must not be thought that all of the old Nihilist school followed the headlong rush into terionsm which took place after Vera Sassulics historic affair Many refused and withdrew , the young and the ardent, like the male and female students who became propagandists when the Russian Government recalled them from Zurich in 1873, composed the majority of those who remained the Revolutionists worked side by side, if we are to believe the best autho rities, with little money, with terrible suffering, and with undying devotion to the cause and to each other " My fate is not such a sad one after all, and you must not grieve about it, wrote the beautiful aristocrat Sophy Perovskaia to her mother when doomed to the scaffold for the murder of Czar Alexander II, and these simple words breath the devotion which charac tised the Nihilist Zola's Gouvarine in "Germinal, is- full of this devotion, though he falls far short of being, typical of his creed, and those who have studied his character will understand how the persecuted Nihilists waited through these two long years of truce As for the Constitutionalists and Pan slavists, who are in some vague way asso ciated with the reopening of the terrorism it must always be remembered that murder has for centuries been the orthodox Russian method of removing an objectionable sovereign Under a despotism there no other mode, the father of Alexander 11 was thus removed, and so have been fathers innumerable from the first entrance of the Romanoffs Both the Constitionalists who want a more liberal Government,and the Panalavista, who, jingo fashion, want to expel Turkey from Sclaviah .Europe,. unite the Sclava, under one rule, have cause to complain to the present Czar, But the occurrence of the attempt on the anniversary of the last assassination, together with the well known love for effect of the Nihilists justify as in assuming that to these revo lutionists the attempt was due. It has failed, as the Winter Palace attempt failed Next time it may succeed, as Perovskaia's attempt succeeded Our present system of magisterial inquiries, though preferable in some respects to the old coroners inquests, is not without it's draw backs, and in some cases is the cause of much unnecessary waste of time and also of expense to all parties concerned. A case in point occuned yesterday at the Police court when Mr Bruce drew attention to the somewhat anomalous position occupied by our Attorney General A few weeks ago a magisterial inquiry was held into the circumstances attending the acci lental drowning of a little girl named Sarah Jane Austen, who fell through Breakfast Creek Bridge during the progress of some repairs to the flooring of the sidewalk The inquiry was a long and very exhaustive one Counsel was employed by both parties con cerned in the occurrence, and every scrap of evidece bearing on the case was collected, as for varions reasons an unusual amount of interest was centered in the proceedings The evidence was duly taken down and the depositions forwarded to the Attorney General, who, after perusal, directed that the man in charge of the work men employed be prosecuted on a charge of manslaughter at the Police Court The prosecution is now going on and when it is over, should the police magist rate commit the case for trial, the Attorney General will again peruse the depositions which will be precisely the same as those taken at the inquiry He will then either findd a true bill or vice versa If the former he will be the prosecutor in the case himself This is the only course of procedure under our present system, and it seems a particularly roundabout course, to say the least of it. Would it not be better in those cases where exhaustive evidence has already been taken at an inquiry, for the Attorney General to direct that a prosecu tion should take place in the higher court forthwith? This would necessitate an alteration in the existing law, but it would remove an obstruction that cumbers the path of justice An even better plan would be to invest police magistrates with the power of themselves committing a man for trial at the conclusion of a magisterial inquiry in which the evidence seemed to support a criminal charge The power might be guarded by a proviso that the depositions should be forwarded at once to the proper Crown law officer, and that he should be required to decide with all reasonable speed whether a true bill should be filed before the superior court, so that the accused might not bee kept in suspense longer than was absolutely necessary We learn that Mr Buckland, M.L.A, waited yesterday on the Minister for Works with the resolutions passed at a meeting held recently in Cleveland to urge the construction of the railway to that place Mr Jordan, M.L.A. was prevented by an unavoidable ab sence from town from accompanying Mr Buckland The Minister received the resolu tion very cordialy, and expressed the opinion that they were reasonable Having consulted the Commissioner, Mr Curnow, as to whether the replies to the notices of resumption were favourible and been informed that they were, he , gave instructions that they should be tabu lated In conclusion, he assured Mr Buckland that it was his intention to proceed with all expedition both in the survey and construction of the line. We have been requested to ex plain in regard to the resumption notices that while the Minister expects the land-owners on the route-especially those holding large blocks of which only a portion would be taken, while the rest would be rendered more valuable -to be more modrate in their demands, hr dors not ob- ject to thr paymrnt of a reasonable price for the areas required A special meeting of the council of the Queensland National Association was held yes terday afternoon It was decided to hold a Jubilee Exhibition in August next despite the refusal of Government financial assistance which Mr Kellett said he thought was owing to a mistake It was decided to continue the improvements in the grounds and to offer in ducements at the coming show to exhibitors from the other colonies Mr John Fenwick was appointed to collect exhibits in the Southern colonies The case. set down for tial before his Honor Mr Justice Mein at the Criminal Sittings of the Supreme Court, which com- mence on Monday next, are as follow's -For trial Robert Walter Wilson, fraudulently appropriating property as a director of a public company (Q M and A ) six charges Gilbert Wilson fraudulently appropriating property as a director of a public company (Q M and A ), five charges Henry Diplock, perjury Charles Morris,and David Low, arson Frederick Edwards and Walter Francis Smith, robbery with violence James Robertson, larceny in a dwelling Thomas Watson, wounding with in- tent Norman Duncan larceny Billy (aborigi- nal) manslaughter James Howe, embezzlement three charges, and larceny as a clerk one charge for sentence -Francis J Tuko, false pre tence three charges Andrew J Murphy, forgery one charge, false pretences one charge , James Donnelly, horse stealing , James Part ridge Tucker larceny, six charges At yesterday's meeting of the Tramway board it was resolved to purchase the horses for the Bulimba extension, and the Works Com- mitte were requested to at once arrange for the erection of the necessary additional stabling at light street, as stated that the Points which were specially constructed in England, under the superintendence of the company's engineer Mr Brown, for the Ann and Bruns wick streets junction, had arrived per Taglia ferry and would be laid down in a few days, thus supplying the link which would enable cars to be run over the Ann-street line, which was otherwise ready for traffic over a year ago The Commissioner for Police has received a message from Senior-constable Walsh, at Augathella, as follows -" In reference to my telegram on the 18th instant giving particulars about a lost man, I have now to report that his name is Hector Souter, not Souttar, as then given.He arrived at Babbillora station on the 19th instant all right but much fatigued, hav- ing been four days without food. He had been in charge of 4950 sheep from Listowel station, the property of Messrs. Berkleman and Lam- bert and was tracked by two trackers and the senior constable through scrub mountains and spring country about 70 miles between the Warrego and Nive rivers. The Under Secretary of the Post Office has has received the following telegram from Gladstone under yesterdays date. Contractor M Kelly and horse were drowned in Boyne River yes terday.

The body and mails have been recovered, inspector Mossman of Toby 's Creek, opened bags and partly dried letters, which were forwarded to Devoncourt " A meeting of St John's Debating Society was held at the schoolhouse last evening The subject.That the imposition of the poll tax on Chinese is contary to the spirit of the British constitution and should be removed" gave rise to a very animated debate, and on division the motion was defeated by two votes The next debate is free trade versus protection, and takes Place on the 20th April The following return showing the estimated population of Queensland on the 31st Decem ber, 1886, is issued from the office of the Registrar-General -Estimated population 1st October, 1886 Males, 200,027, females, 140,176, total, 340,203 increase by excess of births over deaths during the quarter. Males, 794, females, 1138 total, 1932 increase by excess of immigration over emigration by sea dur ing the quarter Males, 765, females, 868, total, 1633 Astimated population on 31st December, 1886 Males, 201,586, females, 142,182 total, 343,768 Increase to population during the quarter Males, 1559 females, 2006, total, 3565 In reference to the application to the Post master-General for a new post and telegraph office at Caboolture, the Postmaster General has informed Mr Wakefield, M L A , that provision has been made at the railway station for those offices, and that another building is therefore unnecessary Mr R Wishart called a meeting of rate payers in the Red Hill School of Arts last night for the purpose of discussing the ques- tion of separating No 2 subdivision from No 3 subdivision, Ithaca, and forming it into a shire council under the Local Government Act Mr T Noyes presided, and the room was crowded Mr Wishart stated that he was opposed to separation, and wished to have the matter discussed publicly, for he believed many ratepayers had signed a petition on behalf of the severance in lgnorance of the provisions of the Local Government Act. He considered that the separation of the two subdivisions would be financial folly The expense that was sufficient under present circumstances for the two subdivisions would have to be nearly doubled were they separated, and in conse quence the ratepayers would be more heavily taxed Then, too, the rates would be much higher under the Local Government Act, which favored large landed proprietors who for every pound paid under the Divisional Boards Act, would only have to pay 16s if the pro- posed change were adopted. Altogether, he was of opinion that it would be for the collec tive good of the ratepayers to remain united, and so reduce the cost of administration to a minimum Mr Wishart spokr for an hour, during which he was frequently interrupted, and considerablr timo was wasted in the dis- cussion flying off to other matters An irre- gular argument then took place among several speakers regarding the point whether the rating would be higher under the Shire Council or not, and finally the meeting broke up without arriving at any decision Madame Rosenberg-Evers inaugurated her season of tuition by a soiree-dansante at the New Masonic hall, Alice-street, last evening, and the great success which attended it speaks well for the prospects of the season This is the first time that the new hall has been used for dancing puposes, and the -verdict last night was one of entire approval, the floor, which had been prepared under Madame's personal super vison with french-polish, obtaining high eulo gium from all the dancers About 200 persons were present, and, though the night was excessively hot, the programme of eighteen dances-alternate waltzs being the rule-was gone through with assiduity and, in most cases, with no little skill The music provided by Mr Nicholls at the piano was excellent, and the numerous corridors and anterooms formed admirably cool retreats between the dances In one of the side rooms light refreshments were provided During a break in the pro gamme Madame expressed the pleasure which it gave her to see so many present, and said she saw in it the token of a happy season, during which she would do her best to make their studies not only profitable, but thoroughly agreeable. One of the pupils bore testi- mony to her success as an instructress, and expressed, on behalf of those present, their appreciation of her invariable good nature. A general round of applause of a very hearty character followed this remark A Chinaman named Ah Ching was arrested by the police last evening on the charge of having wounded Mr Hugh M'Glynn, butcher, Albert-street An altercation took place be- tween the parties while the former was buying some meat, and Ah Ching caught up a meat saw which was lying near him and gashed M'Glynn on the forearm. The wound was a nasty one, 3in long, and ¾ in deep, and had to be sewn up. The man who was shuck down by heat apoplexy on Wednesday afternoon, and who afterwards died in the General Hospital, was Thomas Dalton, a recent arrival in the colony from Victoria, where his relativos reside. Here he was not well known At the time he was struck down he was driving a dray A tea-meeting was given in honour of the induction to the pastorate of the Valley Pres- byterian Church of the Rev James Ewen, last evening, in the Valley Hall, Wick ham street About 300 persons partook of the delicacies of the table After tea a public meeting was held in the church, Warner street, Mr P M'Lean in the chair The chairman welcomed the newly ordained pastor to his charge He had been both a pastor and a member of a congregation, and he related some of his experiences He ex horted the congregation to do all in their power to assist their new pastor. Addresses of a hearty, friendly, and congratulatory character were delivered by the Rev J A Nolan, Rev C Ogg, Rev A C Smith, Rev W. Whale, and Mr M'Nab The Rev James Ewen rose at a late hour to reply He referred to the unexpected kindness of his re ception, and especially to numerous useful gifts he had received for his house From their beginning, he hoped and looked for great and gratifying results. It had been suggested that the side galleries in the church should be removed, but he should vote against such a proposal, prefering to do his utmost to assist the adherents of the church in filling them. He expressed his gratitude at the breadth of thought which had been ex- hibited by the representatives of other de nominations It was high time for them to roll away the old sectarian barriers, and unite in prosecuting their common object-the salvation of souls The choir rendered excellent service by singing several anthems, among which were "We've sighted the golden gate," and " Cast ing all your care upon Him " Mr Ewen proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the chair man, and the meetmg was closed by singing and prayer The following cases were decided yesterday in the Small Debts Court, before Messrs D P Milne and Jarman, JJ P , and verdicts were entered for the plaintiffs with costs, except where otherwise stated -Undefended cases Wm Healion v Jas Watt, goods supplied, £27 Os 8d , judgment confessed, Sarah Straw v Thos O'Halloran, goods supplied, 13s 5d John Hicks v Mrs G Waterson, goods supplied, £3 15s Id , judgment con fesed, John Hicks v John Adam son, goods supplied, £2 12s , E MDermott v A Neilson, goods supplied, £3 4s 11d , Richmond Tobacco Company v Jones and Co , goods supplied, £3 3s 3d , E M'Dennott v G A Goold, goods supplied, £2 2s 4d , veidict for plaintiff, amount to be paid at the late of 10s per month, Quinn and Co v Edward Fossbrook, goods supplied, £7 3s some v George Elliott, goods supplied, £3 15s 4d Defended cases S Charlesworth v James Leo, work and labour done, £6 14s 4d , Mr King for plaintiff, verdict for plain- tiff, with £1 Is professional costs, Alfred Nelms v T C O'Brien, money received £11 15s 10d,, verdict for defendant with costs There appears some reason to hope that Bris bane may be favoured with a visit from Simon son's new Royal Italian Opera Company , who have been winning golden opinions in Victoria, and who are now playing in Sydney to crowded houses Signor G Tessero, agent for M Simonsen, is now on a visit to Brisbane, and the Theatre Royal having been leased from the end of May, a season of five weeks will be given In Brisbane if sufficient inducement is offered The visit of the company will therefore depend entirely upon Signor Tessero's success in ob- taining subscribers on terms very similar to those offered in Sydney. The season tickets will be transferrable and available for any one of the thirty nights. The operas to be perf ormed during the season will be " Trovatore," "Lucia di Lammermoor," 'Faust," "Norma," "Roberto Devereux," " Barber of Seville," Ballo in Maschera," "Rigoletto," " Promessi Sposi," "Lucrezia Borgia," "Belisaro," "Capuletti , Montchei," "Don Giovanni," "Traviata," and "La Sonnambula " A first meeting of creditors was held yes terday before the Deputy Registrar in the estate of Samuel Burns, of Ipswch, baker, in solvent, when Mr Joseph Peirson, accountant, was appointed trustee at a remuneration of 5 per cent on all assets realised, and Mr S G Melvin, of Ipswich, confectioner, was appointed a committee of inspection The following proofs of debt were handed in -E Goertz and Co , £26 Is 6d , Smith Bros , £71 Is 11d Gibbs, Bright, and Co , £18 10s Adelaide Milling Company, £108 3s Burns, Philp, and Co , £67 16s 3d , S G Melvin, £ 61 7s 7d A slight accident, which occasioned no small commotion, occuried in Stanley -street, nearly opposite the Mechanics' Institute, last evening shortly after 7 o'clock An elderly man, a horse-dealer from Ipswích known as Paddy Mack, hailed a tramcar that was travelling into town, and as it did not stop for him he stepped on to the other line of rails and pre- pared to light his pipe Some lads who were with him warned him that a car was approach ing from the opposite direction, but he did not aike any notice, and before the car driver saw him he was knocked down by the horses and fell under the car. Happily the vehicle was stopped before he got under the wheels, and he was pulled out a few minutes later little if any the worse for his narrow escape Alderman Heal has so far recovered from his recent illness that he was able to take a short drive on Wednesday, and yesterday morning he was in town for an hour or two The official weather reports for the twenty -four hours ended at 9 o'clock yesterday morning showed that the fol- lowing rainfalls had been chronicled - Ayr, 0 61in, Bloomsbury, 0.85in , Boulia, 0 50in Cairns, 2 07in Cardwell, 0 07in, Coen, 0 29in , Cooktown , 1 26in , Mackay, 0 66in Maytown, 0 10in , Musgrave, 0 60in , Port Douglas, 0 91in Rockhampton, 0 01in , St Lawrence, 0 45in Townsville, 0 20in , Brisbane, 0 006in , Bollon, 0 13in Duaringa, 0 02in Goondiwindi 1 37in , Inglewood, 0 lOin Mitchell,0 75in Nanango, 0 02in , Pitsworth, 0 22in , Springsure, 0 09in Stanthorpe, 0 35in St George, 0 50 in Toowoomba, 0 05in , Warwick, 0 28in and Welford Lagoon, 0 07m In Sydney yesterday morning the weather was fine, with thin white clouds, and there was a light south south-west wind blowing On the coast of New South Wales the weather was fine, the sea smooth, and the winds were light, varying from west to north west In the interior of that colony it was calm, fine, and warm Special reports taken at 3 o'clock in the afternoon showed that it was showery at Roma At Townsville the percen- tage for humidity was 72deg Rockhampton, 53deg , Roma, 75deg Brisbane, 67deg and Cape Moreton, 71deg The Government meteorologist considers these pecentages for humidity very interesting He adds, there is a low pressure to seaward near the Barrir Reef The usual weekly session of the Life boat Lodge, I O G T , was held on Wednesday evening, presided over by Bro W S Dunlop, W C Templar The Sick Committee furnished then report which referred to the sickness of Bros M'Kie and W Marshall A report was also presented by the committee appointed the previous session, and after considerable discussion was unanimously earned The motions on the digest for the Grand Lodge were read, and it was unanimously decided that the representatives at Grand Lodge should be invested with full liberty in the exercise of their votes A strong hope was expressed that the Grand Lodgo would appoint a deputation to the local authorities to put into operation the clauses of the Licensing Act on the Sunday question Arrangements were made to visit the Advance Lodge next Wednesday evening A deputation waited on the hon the Post- master General a few days ago to ask for a second mail - coach from Warwick to Goondiwindi, and for the telegraph line from Goondiwindi to South End The latter was urged as necessary to assist the police in dealing with cattle stealers, who were very plentiful in the neighbourhood The first request was declined on the ground that the present coaches were sufficient for the mail matter carried and in the second the Postmaster General said he could only grant the line on the basis of the residents subscribing the cost.
