The CM UK.-That may be, but we can only go bj the document The minutes vv ere confirmed WILLIAMSTOWN CHUKOH It waa resolved that the Williamstown congregation be allow ed to revive their call to tlie Rev.

Dr. MACDONALD gave a verbal report as chairman of the meeting held in Scots Church on Friday last Having con vened the meeting in the usual wai, he had really little to do as ita chairman, lor the onlj queBtion raised was whether tue congre- gation consented to the resignation of their pastor, and there waa no opposition The meeting agreed that the resignation should be accepted, and they made no condition It had been his fortune to meet many congrega- tions ol the Presb) tei ian Church, but, ni looking back over Ins experience, he had to Bay that he nevci took part in a congrega- tional meeting that waa characterised by deeper sorrow, greater unammit), greater atlcction for their minister, ami better feel lug and conduct in every respect (Ap- plause ) The MonntATon.-These pioceedings are of a most painful kind. '1 he severance of a pastoral tie under any circumstances is a very sore thing Let us try to restrain our feelings a little, and give a calm and most collective deliberation to the subject before us The Rev. Dr. MACDONALD desired to add to the remarks of the moderator that at the meeting in the Scots Church the other night there was a great deal of self restraint, and no attempt at an) thing like hui railing He trusted the good friends picscut would take the hint of the modeiutor, and so enable the presbyter) to conduct their business tis became a tribunal dealing with an important question Previous to the meeting in the Set is Church he found the kirk session trustees and the board of management sitting in session, and they agreed to a resolution which was afterwards adopted by the con giegntion, and which would now be sub nutted to the presb) ter) He might further state, for the information of the younger members of the presb) tery, tin t the trustees ot a church had important active duties assigned to them by law, and that that w as doubtless the reason wh) the trustees of the Scuts Church vv ere represented on the com mission Mr. Titos BAILLH, as chairman of the board of management, read a paper giving the résolutions pussed at the mectiiig ot Scots Church congiegittion on the 14th niBt, and said that noneot the deputation intended ealing unythuig in addition to that The resolution was as follows - "Hint coinnilssioucts from the congregation ho nppuinUll to attend ttio next meeting of the près hv ter), anti to inform the presb) tery that tho longicgntlon liavo received the intimation of Mr btron{, s resignation with prolollnil honow nnu ro grct, that during the eight ) ears of his ministry lils labours huvu beuu most tieccptahlo mid hlglil) appro cintcd, and tho congregation gratefully acknowledge that hy his aljilit) , euriiLstucss, and zeal, tiley have attained to a degree of prospciity und ellicicney uiiLVilnplcd In their histor} , that ho has endeared himself to all classes in the congregation, more especial!) to tho )oung, h) whom hu Is beloved and revered, that he continues to enjoy tile culilldcncu of his Hock, nnd that the rclntions bet» ecu him and them are of the most cordial and harmonious chnractci , that the eongrtgution rejoice Unit the) have been privileged to co operate with him in ins labours of love nnion^ tile sick, the poor, the outcast, and the fallen of elie eit) , that vv idle tlccpl} regret- ting the loss which Mr btrongs removal will entail upon the congregation, and, as the) believe, upon the church and the eomliiumt) gcllcrill)-a loss which the) have unsuccessful!) trietl to avert-the congrega tloii, liultfcrcucu to Mr fatron^ s desire to leave the Presb) terian Church of \ietotln, and lor no other nason, reluctant!) acquiesce in lils request that his rtjii^imtion be accepted ' It was further resolved " 1 hat the commissioners shall bo tho members of the Mik session, the tuistees, the lncmbirs ot the board of management, and Messrs W m Cumming, Jos Orkne),J S Johnston, elco Martin, III Wilkio, W ni Smith, vv in Craig, lYjnels Graham, and U G Uro» n *' faigncd for and on behalf of tho congregation, " lllOMAH ÜAILLIK, " Chairman of tile Board of .Management " Melbourne, lsth boptciiibel, l&SJ; " The CLLHK read the memorial from the Scots Church Social District Society. He Bind he had been instructed b) the business com iiuttee to expiess their reglet that it had not come up m the usual vvti), and also that statements m it lind been questioned, but the) were of opinion that it would be a right mid proper thing to give ever) possible ad- vantage to the memorialists, and the) theie fore suggested that the document be simply read It was signed by b3 persons Mr BAILLII. bind he might have been tech- nically wrong when he said that the memorial did not proceed from the District Suciut), but he must reiterate that it did not do so The paities who signed it were illiterate, and the) did not know exactly bow to vvoid the document Not one of those who had signed it was a seatholder or a member of Scots Church, they were Bimply people who had heard the gospel week by week from Mr Sttong, and who would not have heaid it had he not gone and found them out. The Rev. W. G. FHABLII thought the court Bhould now take Mr Strong's resignation mto consideration The MODHIATOU said that, according to the order ot business, he would call upon Mr. M'Tachran. The Rev. J. HAI supported the view taken b) Mr W G Fraser The MoDKitAroit BUKI he must adhere to the order of business Mr Hay could, if he chose, challenge Ins ruling The Rev J HAT moved that the ruling of the moderator be not approved Mi \V. li. TiionsoN seconded the motion The Rev. W. G. FBASHI saul he did not wish to challenge the ruling of the moderator. Ilia contention was that Mr Stiong's resigna- tion waa a distinct item of business beiore them, and that the) ought to considci it be fore taking up anything elbe 1 he motion was put and rejected h) a large hiujont), the movei and seconder dissent- ing. i he Rev. D S. M'EAOHIUN said he rose to bring against Mr Strong the charges of Winch he gave notice at last meeting ot presbytery As then intimated, he charged him with promulgating and publishing here- tical and unsound doctrine, both by his action m connexion with the lecent lecture of Mr. lliginbotham and otherwise, also, w. ith being guilty of teaching and conduct tending lo destroy the order, unity, and peace of the church ; also, with failure to assert, main- tain, und defend the doctrine of the church »hen it was in his power to do so: and, farther, with failure to comply with the instructions of the presbytery to give promi- nence in his teaching to the incarnation, the atoning life and death, and the resurrec- tion and ascension of our Lord. Ile made no apology for bringing this matter before tho presbytery. The duty had been laid upon him by a number of the most re spected ministers and elders of that court, and he dared not shrink from it The outrage which was committed on the ton science of the Christian community by the delivery of Mr. Higinbotham's lecture in the Scots Church was such that, did they not call Mr. Strong to account for it, he felt that they would be guilty of moral cowardice,and be un- worthy of the position which they occupied as rulers in the house of God Since he sent notice of his intention to bring the present charge forward, Mr. Strong had sent in his resignation to the presbytery. 1 hat altered the ease very considerably, but still it was no reason why they should not deal with him, and by so doing vindicate themselves before the church and the world He did not need to say anything with regard to the high ora torical gifts of the lecturer. Those were acknowledged by all, and he might be for- given if he said that they would lose none of their lustre if they were associated with a little more humility lhere was much, too, m what he said about music and art, about geology and astronomy, and about the existence and nature of God, with which he thoroughly agreed But his business, unfor- tunately, at present was not with the excel lences, but with the errors of the lecture The lecturer spoke in such a way as was fitted to shake the faith of men in the truth aud trustworthiness of those gospel records on which our Christianity rested. Hear what ho said - "Thoso who had the privilege of hearing the Great Teacher have admittedly failed to comprehend His meaning and His mission, and do not aj:rco with Olio another as to scierai particulars as well as to the general spirit of His doctrine The words of tlic Great Icaeher, of which tho gospels arc not the exclusive depositories, have come down to us by tradition only NO contemporary re cord of them exists, or has ever existed Not more than two of His immédiate followers committed to writlner His rememhered words, and the Gospel of bt John-assuming, as 1 do, that it Is genuine-uas not written till moro than 30 }cars, or, according to another atlthont}, moro than f»n years alter lils Master a last worein had been bpoken Tho general accurac} of his rc|tortcd utterances, spoken in ono language and recorded in another-and a ici-} dif ÍLrent language, depends largely, In rcsiwct both to force and substance, on what has been called 'the unccrtuin testunony of slippery uicmorj ' " In that cxtiaordinary statement there were some grains of truth It was true that not more than two of Christ's immediate fol- lowers committed to wntmg His remembered words, and that the gospel of St John was not written till more than 30 }ears after his Master's last words had been spoken It was also true that no contemporary record oí them existed, or, so far as they knew, had ever existed-that was to say, that no biography of Christ was written while He was ailie upon the earth But that, aurel}, was not a thing verj much to be wondered at M'c were not in the habit of writing the biographies of men w hile they w ere} etamongus It was after the} were taken from us that their lives were usunlly written , and so it was alter Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven that the biographies which we had of him m the four gospels weie written. These things which he had mentioned were true, and they w< re the only grains of truth in the extraordinary btatement which he had quoted All the rest was a tissue of the most baseless assumptions, which the lecturer had skilfully weaved together for the purpose of throwing discredit upon the accuracy of the Gospel narratives He spoke as though his assumptions were ad nntted, but that w as not the ease. Thus, it was not admitted that alter Pentecost the apostles fulled to comprehend Christ's meaning and mission It was not admitted that the} did not agree with one another as to sei ei al particulars, as well as to the general spirit of their doctrine It was not admitted that the words of the Great Teacher had tome down by tradition only. And it was not admitted that the general accuracy of His reported utterances depended hugely, both as to form and substance, " on the uncertain testimoii} of slippeiy memory." M'hat reason was there to doubt the truth and accuracy of the first and last gospels ' They bore upon the face of them the stamp of tiuth 'Hie} were watten by men who were fully cognisant of the things of which they wrote. Matthew, as was admitted on all hands, wrote his gospel when most of the other apostles w ero uh \ e, so | that if any errors had crept into it they would have been sure to have been corrected. John did not write as though there w as any un certainty about what he wiotc That thu gospels were not written for 30, or more than 30, years after the events which they recorded, did not affect their aceuraci, because, as ministers of the word, the apostles must bax o told orall}, over and over again, those sa}ings and doings of their Master which they after- wards committed to writing. Kcgardmg their narratives, then, simply as human composi- tions, w e had evidence for their truth and actuiacy such as we had for the tiuth and aeturaey ot no ancient profane histor} or biography Chribt expressly promised to guard Ilia disciples against "a slippery memory," when Ile promised them that the Holy Spirit should be given to them "to teach thuin all things, and bring all things to their remembrance whatsoever He had said unto them " Hither the Great Teuciier spake the truth when ho gave that pi omise, or bo did not If He did not speak the truth, then He was not a great teacher, but it He did speak the truth, then the narratives of the apostles rested not on "the uncertain testimony of slippery memory," but on the certain testi- mony of that infallible memory which was guaranteed to them hi Christ's promise of the Holy Spirit to bring all things to their remem- brance, whatsoever He had bind unto them With regard to the creation and fall of man, the lecturer told them that if there were any general conclu sions to which recent geological science had forcibly drawn the human mind, and to which laymen could not, if they would, re- fuse to accord belief, they were-that man at the first did not fall from a higher state of existence, but that he rose from a lower, and that what was called death existed millions of ages before the compara- tively recent date when man came first into being "There is here," said he, "irreconcilable variance between modern science and the doctrine of the Christian churches " This was a misrepresentation of the teaching of the churches which would not be expected from so learned a judge. No church in the world taught that death did not exist on this earth before the creation of man M'lut they taught was that death was intro- duced into the human family by the sin of the lirst man Geology had nothing, and could have nothing, to say with regard to that point Neither did the facts of ancient history contradict the teaching of the Scriptures with regard to the original con- dition of man On the contrary, the facts of ancient history all pointed the other way The further back they went the higher ap- peared to be the condition of man In the early vedas or sacred writings of the Hindoos, the faith was higher and purer than m those of a later date The pyramids of Egypt and the mounds of Babylonia did not point to ages of barbarism. And every nation had its tradition ot a golden age which had passed away. The late Archbishop Whately said - u We hal o no reason to believe tint any communie} c\ cr did or ever can ciuelvo, unassisted bl external hclp-f, from a state of buliaiimn into anything that can be called civilisation ' So much for the testimony of histor}, and as for the lecturer's statement that there was no express mention by the lounder of Chris tianity of the alleged tact that the drat man fell b} his own act from a perfect state, nor of the dogma of hereditiry guilt based upon it, that seemed to be neither more nor less than a piece of special pleading li our Lord did notexpreasl} mention them, He certainly b.ud over andover again whut implied them But what right had any man to shut out those writings of the prophets and apostles to which Christ set His heal, and which expressly declared that " God created mun m His own linage aftei His likeness," and " that by one man am entered into the world, and de ith b} sin , mid so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned ' Here, again, the lectuier was at irreconcilable variance w ith the teaching of the Word of God, and that, too, in respect of doetunes l}ingatthe found mon of revealed religion touching the cbametei of God and the need of a Itedcemer For if God did not make mun upright He made lum in a lower moral condition than that m which he was at present, then how could Ile be a holy God, and how could He be freed from the charge of being the uuthor of Bin ' And if man had not fallen, but was steadily rising by his unassisted energy from a lower to a hIgher state, then what need was there for a Redeemer, and especialy for a Divine Redeemer' The lecturer represented Christ as "diligently seeking and discovering the truth "tor Him self. In his view Christ was a mere philo soplier like Plato, or Socrates, or Confucius , and He was a fallible philosopher too He made mistakes and lell into errors which the lecturer held himself able to correct No doubt the lecturer called Hun the Light of the World, but ut the same time lie said that ile uttered a lew, a very few, discordant notes which a just and fearless criticism must reject, and that while His teaching as to duly liad gained for His person the tender reverence of millions, yet that ills doclmic was such that those sume millions liad never accepted it, because they could not understand it Surely a teacher, of whom such things could be said, did not deserve to be called the Light of the World. 'I hey who rejected or corrected His teaching had a better light, one would think, to that graud title. It was true that, ns a man, Christ grew in wisdom as m stature, that Ile searched the Scriptures, and that m so doing Ile had left an example which should be followed. Hut Christ never represented himself as a phdosophci He snake as one who was coin erbaut with all the secrets of Heaven and all the counsels of eternity He snake as one who was in the bosom of the Father, and He claimed to be able to speak of Heavenly things, because He was in Heaven at the ver} time that He waa on earth. He claimed the reception of His testimony, because He spake what He knew I and testified what Ho had seen. And such j I was the authority with which his testunony | was clothed, that He hesitated not to sa), "He that beheveth shall be saved, he that beheveth not BhtiU be condemned ' In accordance with the representation of Christ as a mere fallible philosopher the lecturer said, m the words of Leasing, that ' The contest now lies between the Christian re llglon and the religion of Jesus Christ-tho religion of which Jesus is di o object, and that of which Christ is tho subject That was to say, Christ was no longer to be the object of our trust, confidence, and vv orBhip, but was simply to be within us b) His character and spirit, He was to be our pattern, model, and example, and no more A more direct denial of the deity of our Lord there could not well be Hie lecturer further said that in former times God was conceived of as a magnified man, but that since our minds had been expanded and our views enlarged by the discoveries of astronomy and geology, " anthropomorphism, or the representation of God in the likeness of man, was no longer possible in any shape The Apostle John-whose gospel the lecturer admitted to be genuine-said that "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us " When, in answer to His question, ' Whom say ye that I am? Peter replied "Thou art the Christ the Son of thc Living God, did our Lord repudiate the divine dignity which was thus ascribed to Him ' No, but He said that upon that rock would He build His temple and the gates of hell should not prevail against it Hie words of the lecturer meant that the Son of God was not made in the likeness of man and that Jesus of Nazareth was not God manifest in the flesh The lecturer said that Jesus led a sublime life Either Christ spoke the truth when He claimed to be the Son of God or He did not If He did not speak the truth then He could not have led a sublime life but He must have been one of the worst und most wicked of men On the other hand if He spake the truth then the wondrous and glorious tact remained that God waa made in the likeness of mau The lecturer considered that the centre and excel lency of Christ s teaching consisted in thib that Ile taught that God vv us a Spirit and that we ought to love God and one another '1 Ins was the fcood news which the Great leacher wished to extend from the Semitic to other races of mankind In his address to the Athenians on Mars Hill, Paul proved from reason that God was a Spirit I hat we should love God and love one another waa a law written on the hearts of all men however much it mitht be disregarded Sceptics were m the habit of touig to dimmish the tjory of Christ by showing that some of His moral teaching wns to be found m the writings of heathen authors I hut merely proved thut, however much it mi lit be delaced and un heeded, the work of the moral of law of lov c to God and love to man w as writtcnon the hearts ot all men And if that were not the case, the heathen could have no sin-'for where no law is there ia no transgression In the view, then, of the lecturer, the excellency of Christ as a teacher consisted in this that Ile realised and brought out into view, us had not been done beiore these two principles of natural religion-that God was a spuit and that wc should love God and lov cone an other But till tho peculiar and distinctive truths-of Christiunit) the lecturer set aside us ot no importance or as that doctrine of Christ which millions could not accept be cause they did not understand it He ex pressly said that " If they excepted the lirRt article of the Apobtlea Creed, tiley would lintl scarcely an) thing m any of the creeds and standards that was not an unauthorised addition to the primitive simple doctrines 1 hat was to iii), the incarnation of the Son of God His atoning death, His resurrection from the dead, and ascension into heaven and His coram" to judt,e the world at the last da}-all the wonders of redeeming love and all the terrors of the coming judgment-in short lill revealed religion-waa tiirovvn oveiboardas an unauthorised addition to the primitive simple doctrines buch was the teachinc of the lecture , mid for the deliver) of that Tee ture m the Scots Church be held that Mr Strong wus responsible No doubt the Ice turcr told them that althounh Mr Strong brought him to the Scota Church, ' )ct he was not responsible tor a word that he should utter But there were other things to be set over against that Mr Higinbotham informed his audience that it was at Mr Strong's request the lecture was delivered And not oui) so, but he also informed them thal Mr Strong requested lum to select a particular subject, and assigned a reason for Ins request, so that be was not responsible for the subject of his lecture, nor, indeed, for the munner in which he should treat that subject Nay more, he informed them thalt Mr Strong yiv e lum such liberty to speak out his whole mind that he did not hold himself responsible for a word that he should utter further, the lecture wus delivered avowedly for the purpose of giving public support to Mr Strong, and after it was delivered Mr Strong, who presided over the micting lifted up no protest against it nay did not ev en vv hisper the fuintcbt dissent from any of its teachings Un the contrary he thanked ins llououi for the obhgitiou under which he bad luid him in delivering the lectuie Putting all those things tot,' ther he (Mr M I tichran) held that Mr Strong could not free himself lrom responsibility for the delivery of Mr Hmitibotham s lectur» in the Scots Church, lind it that were so, then the three hrst charges had leen substantially proven If it could be shown that Mr Strong was in sjmputliy with the views of the lecturer then his responsibility for the delivery oí the lecture in the Scots Church would be greatly increased It was a remarkable fact that the published teaching of Mr Strong was prccisel) in the line ot the teaching of the lee ture. 'J he lecturer had spoken out plainly, BO that no one could misunderstand his moantu/, but, in bo dotnn he had only said clearly and distinctly what Mr Strong had again and again aaid dimly and ambiguously ile would compare their teaching with regard to these three treat subjects I he inspira tion of tile Scriptures the Deity of Our Lord, and revealed religion m general Mr Strong had not gone so tar as the lecturer in plainly dulling the inspiration of the Scriptures, but his teaching on that subject pointed pre cisel) in the same direction The whole drift of his teaching was to lower the wratten Word of God im the esteem of men, and to shake the faith of men in its infallible truth and its Divine authority In his article on Jonah he said that while Jonah was an his torical person, ' the book of Jonah is a fiction." In his article on Lessing he wrote - Critic though he was he did not stop short at criticism but sought to rest on principles, and passing by the letter to find the ever-living spirit and truth of religion What he really aimed at doing was to place Christian faith on an indefinite basis and to show that spiritual truth is not touched by mere literary and historical criticism of the Scriptures Its root he held was in the heart and conscience of man Objections to tho Bible were not necessarily objections to religion Thou Luther hast freed us from the yoke of tradition who will free us from the more intolerable yoke of the letter ? lhese were given as the views of Lessing, but they were sent forth by Mr Strong with out one word ot caution, and, apparent!}, with the stamp of his approbation On the subject of the Oeit} ot our Lord, also, tile teaching of Mr Strong wus precisely in the line of that of the lecturer Iii his article on Lessing, he told them that The secondary place which ho assignod to tho historical clement in Chrlstlamt) niialit shock tim unthinkliii, but that nevertheless he was a man of faith Hint ¡s to sa), a mau mi) bo a man of faith or a true believer altliou|,li ho ossl^im a second irv place to the historical elcmuit in Christianity-to biicli lustouc ii f icts a.s the inuiru ition of our Lord His atomnc, death nilli His tesurreetion from the dead It is altogetl cr a mattu of iccoudarv im {Kirtauee whether wo believe in those "r .at historical tacts vi Inch form the basis of Chnstiunit} or not Ac,mn m his article on the 'Vtoncmeiit, he told them that tile general tendency of tho philosophers is to ldculisu the doctrine lcttin^ the historical facts winch aro regarded na tut the temporär) drnpcrv fall complete!)

Instead of condemning the lecture Mr. Strong took occasion to pass a high commendation on the work in which the lecturer and those who applauded him were engaged. The very apology which Mr. Strong made for the lecture showed that he was at bottom in sympathy with it. He (Mi M Lachran) thought he had now proved to u moral ceitaint} his three first charges lieft re passiu,, from tau he wished to come back for a moment to the second count or charge the charge, ii/, that he had been guilty of teaching and conduct tending to destroy the ordei, unit}, und peace of the church It seemed to him that that waa the work in winch Mr Strong had been engaged ei cr since he came to the colony, and that by his conduct in connexion with Mr Higmbothnms lecture he merely put a crown on that work In his pub lished unswertohisiMr M 1 achran sjspeech, Mr Strong had fully admitted the truth of the charge (Lxprcssioiis of dissent ) Mi J is BAU oca saulit was eontriry to the rules of the couit that the audience bhould be allowed to express approval or dis approval and when it waa done, it was quite competent for an}one to move that the court be cleared 1 be Morn UAroit -I have again to ask the audience that the court be allowed to con siller this nutter cahill} If }ou cannot re Iram from expressing disapproval, I am afraid the court must be cleared Mr H H hui)-Hua presbyterv has sufiered sufficiently from closed doors 1 hope it will not be attempted (Applause ) I he Kel b KODINSOV said they were anxious to keep the doors open but if there was dis iideily conduct they would be closed (Applause ) lue Kel D S MIACHBAN - Mr Strong hiullully acknowledged that he had been adla turber of the peate, and had pleadetl in justifieition of his conduct that he was a refoimer and that all reformers must disturb the peace of the body w ith which the} weie connected Ile was, therefore, t > be regarded as another Luther He humbly submitted however tbatthcrewaaadificrencc in all his reforms Luther never pulled up thi wunda tions, he held last by the great historical facts of Christianit), which even the Church of home had never rejected Mr strong would refoim by pulhn0 up the foundations and refining away into ideas the incarna tion, resurrection, und ascension ol our lord Moreover, Luther nailed up his '15 theses on the gate of the church at M lttem berg He (Mr M 1 achran) would like to see Mr Strong iinil up on the gate of the St ots Church tin theses which he was piepared to maintain Ile knew that hew uld be abused tor his narrowness, but humbl} ventuied to submit that there was a difference between Luther as a relonner mid Mr Stiong us a leformer He even ventured to think that ii Luther were alive and here to da}, he would soon sweep away Mr Strong s would be leforms Hie larst charge was that Mr Strong had failed to comply with the mstruc tions of the presbytery to give prominence m his teaching to the incarnation the atoning lite and death, and the resurrection and aseen bion ot our 1 ord It waa 1 letcher of Letton, who said- ' I et me make the songs of a eountr} mid 1 cure not who m il es its liws Hie songs of a eountr} had great in Uueiice m forming the character of a country 1 vin so the hymns ot u church had great inllucncc ni forinuig the character of a church Now how had Mr Strong re sponded to the admonition of the presbytery to give prominence in his teachin0 to tim great central iaeta and truths of Christianity? Ile had done so by lutrolucmg for the pur pose ot being sling in his congregation, ¿I hymns which were as destitute of Chris tiunit} as the school books of the suite HchooK One of the h} mns was an invocation to the Holy Ghost, but it was not Christum in its tone audit was a li) mu which even Mr Martmeau could sing I veiything depended upon what was meant by the Iloly Ghost \\\ hat was the 1 md of religi ma instruction which Mr Strong provide 1 lor the children ' He had placed in their hands a little cutt elusin entitled A 1 nat christian Gate chism It would have been much more nth entitled, A Kirst Unitarian Catechism I here w as not a w ord in it to which a Uni turinu would object Such was the gospel which Mr Strong taught to the children-a gospel which was not anothei, but which w as a peri ersion of the gospel of Christ If the kind of iebeious instruction given to chil dren were important not less important was the kind of ieh"ious instruction given to }Oung people at that lime ot hie wnen their characters were bein" lormed and lixed Now the text book which Mr Strong had been using for this purpose had been put into his (Mr M'Eachrau's) hands It was the work if Emerson Now they all knew what Emerson was He was simply a philosophical pantheist According to him Jesus was one of the gods like Socrates or Plato who had come in the flesh It was the work of such a man which, he was told on good authority, Mr Strong had been using for the purpose of giving, re bgious instruction to the young at the most importanit and most critical peniod of their life That was the way im which Mr Strong had complied with the instructions ot the presbytery to give prominence in his teaching to the incarnation the iteming life and death and the resurrection au 1 ascension of our Lord And if public report were coircct Mr Strong's public teaching was simply a reflection of the hymns which he had introduced and of the books which he used for the purpose of giving religious instruc- tion. There might be much that was good and true and beautiful in a man's teaching, both with regard to God and Jesus and duty but if the incarnation death and resurrection of our Lord were left out it was not Christianity but an improved natural religion which he taught. He thought he had made good his charges. At any rate he thought he had made out a case for inquiry. The duty which he had endeavoured to perform was the most painful and weighty which he had ever been called on to perform.
