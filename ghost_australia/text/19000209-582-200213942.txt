WAR. We bid farewell and cry aloud The hopes and deeds of those Whose youthful form may find a shroud Within the demon war's red cloud And duty's dark repose. We sing their praise — and thousands come, . To see them on their way With trumpet blast and beat of drum. Till o'er the land is heard the hum Of Austral's holiday. Regardless of each bleeding heart That's trembling now with fear And anguish of the soul to part With one whose absence seems a dart From sorrow sharp and drear. Look at that maiden pure and bright As our clear summer skios, Bidding a fond and last good night To him who is her soul's delight — Lord ! Keep all those ' good-byes !' And see that weeping mother there Now parted from her son VVhose curly looks of golden hair In childhood, was her fondest care Love lost — and glory won — Glory forsooth ! what is the boast "Fighting, he nobly fell !" - Is it a phantom, or a ghost ! Is war a part of Heaven's host Or monster from black hell ? Oh God of Battles, haste the time - When fiendish war shell cease, When men of ev'ry land and clime Shall ring the welcome, joyous chime Of Everlasting peace — TAM RATTRAY. Castlemaine.
