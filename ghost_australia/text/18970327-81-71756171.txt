In half a minute Harvey heard deep snores in the cabin, and be was staring blankly at Dan and ' Pennsylvania.'

At the iirst splash a silvery white ghost rose -bolt upright from the oily water and sighed a weird whistling sigh. Harvey started buck with a yell, but Dan only laughed. ' Grampus said he.
