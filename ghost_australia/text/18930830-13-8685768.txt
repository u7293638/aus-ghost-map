THE ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SHOW. A SPLENDID EXHIBITION. STATION, FARM, AND DAIRY. THE EXHIBITS JUDGED. The Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria has been rather unfortunate in the opening days of its big show. Last year it rained and the grounds were slushy, and although tberamjcsterdn} «as hunted to little more than nasty threats there was a high Mind that made everything unpleasant, and espc ciallj the task of show stewards, who have to w rite out and distribute prize cards as thej are won-for to win a pruc and not M par it were to deprive the victory of quite half its glorjy. Yesterday was a purely business dnay, in which the judges gave themselves entirely to the task of judging the stock, and nenrlv ever} one else present was occupied in judging the judges lor the general public the show reall} begins to da}, when His Excellency the Go\emor and the Countess of Hopetoun MBit the ?grounds, and the spice of sport, with out which n show is incomplete, is furnished in the juvenile hunters competí tion, beginning at 3 this afternoon All Roj al shows are as a spectacle much alike and though one familiar with details may find traces of the depression ni some of the stock sections, to the general observr it is as in terestmg as e\er IheNew 7LalandA}rslnres tire not entered this }ear, but they were sale rother than show cattle, and the culling out of auctioneers cattle has merel} resulted m a concentration of the cracks-and a more in terestmg competition J hat the dair} mc interest has some go in it is show n in the fact that this }ear detachments of Holstein, Kerr}, and Dexter Kerr} cattle more than supply the place ot any missing A}rslures or Jerseys, both of which are and arc like!} to be big classes It sounds strange at first to sn} that there is greater v anet} in the show of sheep than at the sheepbrecders speciul show but it is really the cuse, for many xarieties of farmers sheep, which have no place in the annual battle of mermoes, are pennedhere, whtlelinevvoolsaioconspicuousl} few In horse stock there is much the Barae variety as heretotoie lhe pavilion exhibits, such as butter, cheese, und bacon, maintain, like the uairy cattle, their high standard and for much the same reasons Every day there will boa régulai succession of parades and eacli da} has some special competition that appeals to the lo\ e for ex citement On Ihursdnj there is a sheep shearing competition by machiner}, and the heav} weight hunters will bt sent over the fences in the afternoon On Trida} there is the high jumping competition and on Saturdn} the trial of light weight hunters The following is a detailed uccount of the exhibition and awards - CATTLE THE BEEF «REEDS It would be exaggeration to sa} that the heav y beef producing cattle of this } eai are at all up to the best standard of tlieRo}nl Show «reeders naturally consider the chances of selling stock as well as winning prizes with them and there seems to havt been a general opinion amongst cattle men that prices would not for the present justif} uny special attention in the wa} ol building np cattle for show While, howe\er, the classes may thus suffer in appearance from a purel} practical point of Mew there is nothing lost lor with fat piled on reckless)} many good cattle break down w ith their ow n excess of weicht Provided cattle have enough condition to show that they can carr} beef when required, and are not natural!} light ordinary show requirements are ful filled 'lhe unsatisfactory thing with the short horns is tin, failing off in numbers amongst the voung Brock, the particular sections wherL with a Mew to the future one would wish to see competition most keen lour aged bulla were show n, that piel ed for first berne a tremendously big dark roan Duke of Glenroy 3rd owned by Mr lohn James, ot Colac 'Hit Bccond bull Oxford Duke 8th a nice roan, was close]} related to the winner both being by Mr ^ m M Culloch s Duke of Glenro} and botli their dams by another bull irom the same herd Lord Red Rose 2nd 'lhey were both bred by Mr J G Reid Hie three } ear olds made an imposing show on paper, but on!} three came into tile ring lhe winner wa« that handsome }oung bull Lord Waterloo Oth, who made a big bid for the championship last} ear Bloom has been mentioned as conspicuously wunting this j. tar, but the Colhn"rove Bliorthons are a marked

Duke 7th bred b} Mr M Cul loch coupled shape with action, and though clearly not made up for the occasion Ins merit could not be. overlooked Ile walked too, like a racehorse and was characteristic of tilt herd in shape and colour, tile even top line and popular light roan coat being con Bpicuous Hie class could hardly be called satisfactory however, as only live out of 21 on the catalogue came into the ring One bull that did not take a prize Mr I G Brisbane s Jessamine s Duke 14th was noticeable for ns pretty a henel piece as has been seen in this nn/ for many it da} A bi" class of 13 } ear lings were easil} weeded down to a half do/en Erom these Mr M Culloch s Minstrel Gw}nne 3rd was picked as best and he should be a show bull, for on both sides he comes of stock that ha\ c made their mark in }eurs past in the Melbourne }ard A calf, Lord Red Rose 23th w ith much the same lines in Ins pedigree, was also lirst in his class 1 here w as some interest as to w hether the two} ear old bull would successfully challenge the aged one s right to the chum pionship but the judges held that a big bull like Duke of Glenroy 3rd, who carried his weight with the ease ofacnlf and hadcleariy not been pampered must have the call o\ er a }oungster and the} gave lum the vellow ribbon Although there were only three cows paraded, they were all models Hie beautilul mountain of snow w Into, Rose

Tins company is well represented again tina }enr at tlie aliovv On the corner oppo Bite the Bociety s oflice (being the Bite formerly ocouplcd by Messrs James M'llwan and Co ) is to be seen probably the finest diaplny of harvesting anti cultivating machinery ever seen at any show in the colonies 'Hie exhibit consista of the Massey aide delivery reaper, loronto horse rakes, Toronto mowers their new shoe grain drill, different st}lea of cultivators nnd several Massiy Harris wide open reapers and binders (so well know n throughout the colonies aa the veteran trial winncra) nre shown to great advantage by a number of them being placed in a circulnr position on a large and hand somel) crecteil platform, and kept constantly m motion hy tneanu of power from shafting beneath the floor These machines nre kept continuously filled with ivhcatcu hn}, so long thut the benda extend out at tho rear of the muelnnc aome distance beyond the back edge of the elevator this unique idea of the ex lubitors illustrates very aptly the prominent feature in the new machine At first glance it resembles the old insluoned closed back machines shown by others, although mucli more compact nnd smaller looking It will readil} be seen, however that while the muclune bus both upper and lower cam aa belts lor elevating the grain from the cutters to the binder yet by on ingenious contrivance vi hereby the upper canvas ia aupported trom. the seat board, the back end of the machino is quite open, so that crop of any length can be elevnted without danger of chol mg or thrashing against ti« back elevator Bide besides the top cunvis flouts BO that it adjusts itself to any thickness of crop, mid no extra strain ia put upon the maehme in passing through a heavy piece of crop HUB new feature is considered to be very important by farmers and others used to working such machines so much ao that many of the leading machine manufacturers of both the United States and Jjiigland have made similar open back machines but it is alleged that owing to tin Massey Ilurria patents they have been kept off the Australian market -Another very important feature pointed out on the Massey Harria binder is the knotter It is very simple claiming to have less parta than any other knotter made 'Hie elmo wheel ia large and moves very Blovvly, only making one revolution for every seven alieaves bound, winch causes scarcely any friction, all plunger bolts dogs, spiral springs, latches, gates, and other traps being discarded from this knotter 'lliey nlso show tlie new Massey Harris ahoc drill in motion This seed drill appears to be very complete It lina a new feed run, which is highly spoken of by those who have seen îtlit work 1 he hoes can be compresaed bl ii lever to any desired depth 'I here is no change of gear to lessen or increase the quantity of gram , it is simply set with the hand on a face plate, which is numbered to anv desired quantity of grain per nore lheirnew spring tooth, atump jump culti vntorisvtry highly spoken of by those who liavo seen it at work in the field A great futuro l8 predicted for this machine It IB made in différant sections, which work inde pendently ot each other , the teeth ure fastened to each of those sections, and those who have seen them nt work on rough and stumpy lund state that tlie teeth will stand any amount of strain, as they aro made by a new improved process of oil tempered steel, and are BO constructed that they Bpring while nt work pulverising the ground as well as cultivating it 'this machine is claimed to take the place of the stump jump plough, us well as all the various, atj ka of disc and spading hairows, ordinary cultivators, giubbera, and Becd drills It looks as it it were just the thing tho Australian farmer wants-something that will do the Vi ork quickly and cheaply, and be purchased at a reasonable price I hey cut from Oft to 8ft. wide, and will cultivate and prepare from 10 to 12 acres per day If a seed box is attached (which can be done at a small cost) the seeding can be all finished at the samo time We can hardly do justice to such a machine as this in our limited space, but us the company offer a full trial in the field to any intending purchaser, it should be a proof oi its working qualities It ia really wonder ful how quickly tins cultivator has sprung into favour, largo numbera being Bold daily Mr Chas M'Leod, Australasian manager, is m attenduuee M'LEAN BROS.
