THE COMET CRY. A FEW weeks ago a paragraph went the round of the papers, which announced that on the 12th of August last, a comet would come into collision with our earth. This occasioned a very interesting letter in the Herald from tlie pen of our. Government Astronomer, Mr. H. C. Russell, in which lie showed ns that scientific investigation in this direction had produced irresistible proof that comets are very harmless things indeed; that they are celestial ghosts rather than heavenly bodies; that a few pounds of matter, or even a few ounces, would suffice for the manufacture of a formidable comet-tail ; and that they are so numerous that in all probability the earth passed through many of them in the course of each year. And so the 12 th of August came and went as other days. The brush has not hurt us. The earth seems to be traversing its old track in its old fashion.â€” Sydney Christian. Advocate.
