THE SIN OF OMISSION. or e , , or IT isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone Which gives you a bit of a heartache At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The floweryon might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of heartsome counsel Ton were hurried too much to say. The loving tonch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That yon had no time nor thought for, With tronbles enough of your own.
