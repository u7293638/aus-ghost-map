A Thirsty Corpse. A certified corpse was being taken by two porters to .the Morgue, in Paris, on a stretcher, when it suddenly alarmed its carriers by sitting up and asking for a drink. It was a worthy female who, having got out of a train at the jjiuui£/aiijubue oluuuij, leu uowii uu wit pun- form and apparently gave up the ghost. A re puted doctor who was near said that the wo- man's heart and pulse had ceased to beat, so she was accordingly sent, by a stretcher, to the unlovely establishment in mid Seine, where the dead bodies of city castaways are kept for dis section and burial. The woman awoke on the Place de Parvis de Notre Dame, and instead of taking her to tbe direful destination for which she had been intended, her kind carriers marched her into tbe adjacent hospital — the Hotel Dieu — where she was installed temporarily in a warm ward, and received refreshments, She had, ac cording to the Paris correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, been over-fatigued by|a railway jour ney from Brest, and the cold had brought on an attaek of congestion of the brain.
