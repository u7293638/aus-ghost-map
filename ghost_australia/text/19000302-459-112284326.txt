(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) A terrible dust storm passed over here on Monday night about 11 p.m. accompanied with thunder and lightning, but no rain; and if it does not soon rain here it will indeed be a severe winter. We have had some very hot winds lately with extreme heat, and what were grass flats a week or two back, is simply dust now. Rumor hath it that there is a ghost hovering around in the vicinity of the cemetery. Several aver that they have seen a light and various other signs. A whole party turned out during the week to see it, but it could not have been his night out, as the object never appeared after their waiting many hours. A day's racing will take place here on the 17th of March in Mr Thomas' paddock which is a first-class track. Several cash prizes will be run for ; also various other events. Everything promises well for a good day's sport. One of our local farmers has just disposed of his property here at, I hear Â£10.50, and Mr Hall is now I believe going to seek fresh fields and pastures new. February 27.
