PERSONAL ADTENTURES OF MAaTER HUMPHREY. THE OI.D CUEtGSlTY SHOP—CHAP. II. After combating for nearly a week the feeling which an polled me to revisit the place I had quitted uader the circumstances already detailed, I yielded to it at length; and determining that; this time I would present myself by the j light of day, bent my steps thither early in the afternoon. I walked past tbe bouse, and took several turns in the street, with that kind of hesitation which is natural to a man who is conscious that the visit be is about to pay is unexpected, and may not be very acceptable. However, as the door of the shop was shut, and it din not appear likely that I should be recognized by those within if L continued merely to pass up and down before it, I soon conquered this irresolution, and found myself in the Curiosity Dealer's warehouse. The old man acd another person were together in the back part, and there seemed to have been high wnxds between them, for their voices, "which were raised to a ve»y loud pitch, suddenly stopped on my entering and the old man, advancing hastily towards me, said, in a tremulous voice, that he was very glad I had come. " You interrupted us in a critical moment," he said, pointing to the man whom he had found in company with him, " this fellow will murder me one of these days, lie would have done so long ago if he had dared." " Bah !" Fou would swear away my life if you could," returned the other, after bestowing a stare and a frown unon me; " we all know that" J , * " I almost think I could," cried the old man, turning)feebly upon him. " If oaths, or prayers or words, could rid me of you, they should j I would be quit of you, and would be relived if you were dead." I know returned'the other. " f said so, didn't I \ But neither oaths, nor prayeis, nor words, mVl kill me, and therefore i live, and mean to ^ve/* l t - And his pother died !" cried the old man, passionately gasping his hands and looking upwards; ancj this is Heaven's justice." The other aood lounging, with his foot upon a chair, and rcatding him with a conteraptous. sneer. Be wis' a ybung r man of one-andr twenty or tlia-eabouts, well mtde, and certainly handsale, though the expression of his face'was farfrom prepossessing, having, in common wit^ his manner and evep his dress, a dissapated ad insolent air which repelled one. . '. " Justice b no justice,"* feaid die joung fellow, " hew I am, and here I shall "stop {ill such time think fit to go, unless you send 0 pot ine out—-which you won't 1 tell yod again that I want to for assistance d«j, I know see mv sister. "Your " Abl returned the have , done so sister that you her mind with 4>d affection fotfi death, and add week to. the ney you 1 I want.to see b , anil I will." said the old man bitterly, change the relationship," " If you could, you'd I wknt to see my >ug ago sep cooped up here, poisoning mr sly secn-ts, and pretending] er that you ma\ work her to few scraped shillings every can iiardly couht. jBerfe oraiist to talk of poisoning mind?!

A liar, too," he added in a lower voice as he drew -closer;- to meij " vtho knows how dear she is to me, and seeks to wound me even there because there is a stranger by.". r - " Strangers are nothing to tne, grandfather," saki tbe young feilow catching at the word,nor I to them X hope. The best they can do is to keep an eye to their business, and leave nie to mine. There's a friend of mine watting ontside, and as it seems that I may have to wait some time, I'll call Dim in with your leave." Saying this, he stepped, io the door, and looking down the street, beckoned several times to some unseen person, who, to judge from the air of.impatience witbr which these signals were accompanied, jeguired a great' deal of persuasion to induce him to advance. At length there sauntered up, on the opposite side of the -way—wish a bad pretence of passing by accident—3 figure conspicuous for its dirty smartness, which, after a great many frowns and jerks of the head, in resistance of tbe invitation, ultimately crossed the road atnd was brought into the shop. : "There. It's Dick Swiveller," said the t young fellow, piahing him in.- " Sit down,- Swiveller." | " But is the oldmin agreeable ?" said Mr Swiveller. " Sit down,'. 1 repeated bis companion. Mr Swiveller complied, and looking about him with a propitiatory smile, observed that last week was a fine week for the ducks, and this week was & fine week for the dust; he also observed that while standing by the post at the street corner he had observed a pig with a straw, in its mouth issuing out of the tobacco shop, from which appearance he augured that am ther fine week for the ducks was approaching, and that rain * would certainly ensue. Be furthermore took occasion to apologise for any negligence that might be perceptible in his diess, on the ground that last night he had had " the .sun in his eyes by which expression he was undeistqud to convey to his hearers, in the most delicate manner possible, the information that he had been extremely drunk. " But what," said Mr Swiveller with a sigh, " What is the odds so long as the fire of soul is kindled at the taper of conwiviality. and the wing of friendship never moults a feather 1 What is the odds so long as the spirit is expanded by means of rosy wine, and the present moment is the least happies of our existence 1'' "..You needn't act the chairman here," said his friend half aside. " Fred,*' cried Mr Swiveller, tapping his nose, ' a word to the wise is sufficient for thera —we may be good and happy without riches, Fred. Say not another syllable. I know my cue ; smart is the word. Only one little whisper, Fred—is the old 'nun friendly ? *' " Never you mind," replied his friend. " Right :.gain, quite right * aaid Mr Swiveller, " eantion Is tbe worid. and caution is the act" Wi*h that, he winked as if in preservation of some deep secret, and folding his arms and leaning back in his chair, looked up at the ceiling with profound gravity. It was perhaps not veiy unreasonable to sus- , pect, from what bad already passed, that Mr Swiveller was not quite recovered from the; effects of the po wet fill sunlight to which be had made allusion ; but if <no such suspicion had been awakened by his speech, his wiry hair, " dull eyes, and sallow face, , would still have been strong witnesses against him. His attire was. not, as lie had himself fainted, remarkable for the nicest arrangement, but was in a state of disorder which strongly induced "the idea that be had gone to bed in it. It consisred of a brown body-coat with a great many brass buttons up tbe front and one behind, a bright check neckerchief, a plaid waistcoat j soiled white trowsers, and a very limp bat, worn with the wrong side foremost, to bide a bole in the brira. Tbe breast of his coat was ornamented with an outside pocket from which there peeped forth the eleanest end, of a very large and ill favoured handkerchief; bis dirty wristbands were pulled down as far as'possible and ostentatiously folded back ; over: his cuffs ; be displayed no gloves, and carried a yellow cane having at the top a bone hand with -the semblance of a riug on its. little finger end and a black ball in itsgTasp." With all these personal advantages (to which may /be added a strong, savour of tnb&cco; smuke^/and a prevailing greasiness of appearance), Mr Swiveller leant back in bis chair with his eyes fixed on the ceiling, and occasionally pitching bis voice to the needful key, obliged the "company with a. few bars of an intensely dismal air, and then, ic the middle of a note, relapsed into bis former silence. The old man sat himself down in a fhair, and mirh folded hands, looked sometimes at his grandson and sometimes at his strange companion, as if be were utterly powerless and had no resource bpt to leave them to do as they pleased..* The young man reclined -against a table at aq great distance from his friend, in apparentindifference to everythihjg that had passed; and I^w^o^r'N^Vi^^^^attjr 1 .interl^n^notwithstand thatitheold irian had appealed to m^ both by words and looks —made tbe best feint icouMofbeing occupi in examining some of the goods that were diBrposed for.sale,wtA, flayi^,^^ Hi'tle ia^ to tbe persons before me.

Gentlemen, how does the case s^and upon the present ocqasipn ?. - vHcre;is a jolly old grandfather—say.it with the utmost respect—and here is a ,wil«i young grandson. The jolly old grandfather says to the wild yonng.grandson, ' I have brought you up and educated you,.

The jolly old grandfather unto this retorts, not only that hedeclines to fork out with that chect^ul readiness which is always so agreeable and jple'asant in a gentleman of his time of life, but- tbat he will blow up, and call names, and naake reflections whenever they meet. Then, the plain question is, an't it a pity that tbis state of things.should contin ue, and how much better would i t be for the old gentleman to band over a reas^bableamonat of tin, and make it all, right and 'comfortable?""- '''..J^'. ! V.:T' ^'^"'^.'''VX'-^i'Vf*'"-' Having delivered this oration with a great many waves and flourishes: of tbe, band,, Mr Swiveller abruptly thrust the head,of his cane into his mouth as if to prevent himself, from imparing the effect of bis speecb by, adding one otber word . ^ Why do you hunt and persecute me, God help me ?" said the old man; turning to'his grandson. " Why do you bring^your profligate companions here ? How ofteu am l to tell you, that my life ia one of care and selfdeniai, and that I am poor ?" • " How, often am I to : tell you,returned the other, looking coldly at him, " that I know better f" - - . • "You have "chosen your own path," said tbe, old man.
