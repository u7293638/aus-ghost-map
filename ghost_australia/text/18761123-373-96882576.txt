^xkktt ALL-ENGLAND ELEVEN ,F. TWENTY TWO OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA. [By our Special Reporter. 1 The great cricket match, which has been the general topic of conversation amongst all classes — and more especially cricketers — for the last few weeks, was commenced on Thursday, November 16\. _ At the beginning of the week it wae doubt ful if the weather would prove fine, and on Tuesday a hot wind was blowing all day, which was succeeded by a severe thunderstorm. This nad the effect of clearing the atmosphere, and on Thursday morning the sun shone out brightly, but being tempered by a southerly breeze, the heat was not at all unbearable. During Thursday morning the various coaches arriving' from the country were completely packed with passengers, and the trains from the North conveyed hundreds of visitors, so that the streets presented an unusually lively appearance. Way was announced to begin at 1 o'clock, but fully ah hour before that time hundreds were flocking to the Oval ; and by the time the game commenced, there could not have been less than ?' 6,000 persons on the ground, which number was increased to at least 7,000 during the afternoon. \- There were booths-and fruit-stalls on the ground, which were of course kept busily employed ? and the strains of the Goucordia Band added to the pleasure of the occasion. ....-? The Play, Soon after .1 o'clock the Twenty-two emerged from the pavilion, followed by Jupp and Ulyett (Lilly white having won the toss), and at 1*20 the real business began by Goodfellow bowling a maiden, which was followed by the same from Whitridge. In Goodfellow's second over ' first bloody was scored by Jupp for a fine hit for two to mid-on, which was acknowledged by tre mendous cheering. Ulyett now scored his first run by driving Whitridge straight for a single, which called forth another cheer .from the spectators. After another single had been ob tained by Ulyett the run-getting became very slow, the bowling being very straight and good, and it was a long time before the first 10 appeared on the board. The batsmen still played carefully, Ulyett doing the principal scoring, whose fine free hitting was universally admired, as was also Jupp's obstinate defence and fine leg play. At lunch-time (2-30) there wals no sign of getting a wicket, although the bowling had been changed. On resuming the game after lunch, the not-out men took their places, King and Cole bowling, and again treating the spectators to a splendid ex hibition of batting. However, the end was near, for Ulyett having tipped a ball from King, it was snapped up by Millard at the wickets -1—28—40. Ulyett's was a splendid innings, and his sci r-s was made without a sino-ifi rhanrp. wtiinh. with twenty-two men in the field, was no mean per formance. He was loudly cheered on his return ing to the pavilion. Selby came in next, and at first played carefully and scored slowly, but at the same time he was getting his ' eye in.' Fifty now appeared en the board, and Selby began to open his shoulders, knocking the bowling about in splendid style, Jupp's score meanwhile mourn ing slowly. Sixty up and only one wicket down. South Australia's backers were beginning to pull long faces, which grew still longer as 70 went up, and then'SO, in quick succession. All the changes in the bowling had been well rung, and Whitridge was again entrusted with the ball, and the change worked well, for Jupp having spooned a ball back, the bowler held it— 2— 35— 88. Jupp was at the wickets nearly three hours, and his score was carefully and correctly put together. A perfect storm of applause burst forth as he retired. Charlwood came next, and commenced in a pfi&cky; manner, and it was prophesied he would have a snort life ; and the prophecy was correct, for, after making three singles, he made a splendid hit to long-on off Whitridge, where it found a resting-place in Bright'6 hands— 3— 3— 98. This .was a fine catch, and the fieldsman was deservedly .applauded. Greenwood was the next man, and as he walked across ihe ground he was hailed with cheers. He was destined, however, soon to return, for, after making two singles, he was clean .bowled by Whitridge— 4— 2— 101. Selby still kept his wicket, and was now partnered by Pooley, who, after making singles for a drive to long-off, a draw, and a hit to the on. placed the ball in Morcom's hands, where it stopped — .5—3—109. iimmett next came on, and Selby having made two singles, time was called, thus leaving the scores at 111 for five wickets. The bowling and fielding of the Twenty-two were good, the fielding especially so. The wicket played very correctly, and bumped but little ex cept towards the close of the day. Friday's Play. It was notified that play would commence at J2 o'clock to- day, and accordingly before mid-day numbers were wending their way to the Oval. It was estimated there were at one time 4,000 persons on the ground. The weather was finer for cricket than on the previous day, not being so windy. A few minutes after 12 o'clock the Twenty ?two took the field, Selby and Emmett, the not-out mnn of Thursdav. taking their nlrma at. ihn -wickets. Emmett scored a two and a four, and then Goodfellow clean bowled him— 6— 6~122. Armitage filled the vacancy, and began to hit out at once, but failed to score, for having skied one .of Goodfellow's to long-leg, it was held by Fealherstone— 7-0— 122. Shaw joined Selby, and, like the previous batsman, began to hit, and soon run up nine, one or two of his hits being high, but out-of the' fieldmen's reach. Wallace, however, -was Atoo many for him, having made a good catehnoff Goodfellow's bowling— 8— 9—135. Lilrvwhite* the Captain, now appeared, and was heartily cheered by the spectators, and also by the Twenty-tflPO. He seemed to play rather Btifflyy: but nevertheless kept his wicket up, leaving the scoring to Selby. Whitridge's bowl ing being rather loose, he was relieved by Cole, who with his fourth ball in first over clean bowled die Notts batsman— 9— 59— 153. A deafening roar now arose from the spectators, and for a short time the excitement wss great. Selby's batting was admired by all ; and J may say that I never before saw such fine, free, faultless hitting, com bined with splendid defence. His play on the second day was not eo careful as was that of the first, -and he -? -^aied to be tired of batting. Allan Hill was th£ ^ast of the team, but his life was t short, bi hi »?ayed a ball from Cole down which ' bumped back and knocked his bails off — 'an in glorious end for so noble a life.' Lillywhite was not ont with three, and the cup was drained at about 1*30 for 153. This day's play was not nearly so careful as -that of Thursday ; had it been, I think the batsman would not have been disposed of for the afternoon. The bowling and fielding of the colonials, on the whole, were quite up to that of the previous day. Thb Twents-two at the Wickets. At about a quarter to 2 the Eleven took the field, followed by Gibbs and King, It was amusing to hear the remarks of some of the onlookers as to how the first men would shape at the bowling. Some said a wicket would go down first ball ; others gave it as their opinion that they would walk into the ' slow stuff.' Shaw started, bowling irom the south end, Allan Hill being at the north end. Gibbs took the first over safely, . which caused people to breathe freer. King now had to face the lightning bowler. Hill, whose first over he outlived. Shaw having bowled a tnaideBy'SX&g;* made a single off .the fast bowler, which drefo forth deafening; cheers from the multitude. The' batsmen appeared .to play, the bowling pretty wfl|» ?*?-! scored freejy .off Hill, Gibbs especially. King did ntft add to his score, +&, having put his leg where his'tat ought-to-have been, he retired — 1 — 1 — 4. Lungley partnered Gibbs, and the pair soon brought 11 on the board, which caused the friends of the colonials to brighten up and *' blow' a little. Play was now stopped, and the ' inner man'' refreshed ; after which Lungley was bowled by Shaw — 2 — 6 — 11. It would weary your readers to detail the fall of each wicket, so let it suffice to say that before 6 o'clock the team had succumbed for the small score of 54, Gibbs making 13 by very good play Some of the batsmen batted well as far as style was concerned, but they could not play the bowling into the field. Barnes, J. E. Gooden, and Ayers played in nice free style, and kept their wickets up well. Giles disappointed a good uiaDy, as be had promised to make 30 runs him self. He sticks very well, but is the ugliest bat in -the team. - With the -exception .of -Barnes, Gibbs, Gooden, and Ayeis, the whole team batted altogether too stiffly. . The bowling of Shaw and Emmett was splendid .; the former especially seemed to have great command over the ball. The fielding of the Eleven was good., and in some cases brilliant ; but there were several mulls, which, for an All-England Eleven, looked bad. The wicket- keeping of Pooley was a. treat in itself — the manner in which he took the fa-t bowling of Emmett was wonderful 5 indeed, I heard an ' old fogy' say he believed the ' old . gentleman' had so 1 ething to do with it. I think the wicket-keeper frightened many of the colonial , batsmen by the way he snapped off the bails occasionally. Saturday's Play. \ The third day broke cloudy, but that did not prevent the prevent the people from flocking in, and there were fully as many on the ground as on the first day. The price of admission had been reduced from 2s. 6d. to Is., which no doubt helped to swell the attendance. As the Twenty-two were more than 80 runs behind their opponents they had to ' follow their go.' The play in this innings was of just the same quality as that shown in the first, and the South Australians gave up the ghost for 63, thus leaving the Englishmen victors in one innings with 46 runs to spare. The two Goodens, Bright, Whitridge, and Barnes shaped very well, but the rest of the batsmen were altogether out of iheir element, many of them retiring without scoring. The bowling of the Eleven was again splendid, Armitage's underhands especially making dreadful havoc. Their fielding was fine, the manner in which the balls were picked up and returned being quite a caution to daring batsmen, and the smartness of Pooley behind the sticks was the finest ever witnessed in the colony. Time not being up the Englishmen a«ain went to the wickets, but they did not play with the caution they showed in the match, and began to hit out wildly, by which several of the best bats got their tickets-of-leave in a very short time* Subjoined are the scores : — All-England Eleven.
