THE HOMELESS ONE OF SYDNEY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD'. Sir-Dr. W. M. Foote has, I notice by to-day's Herald, and in another recent issue thereof, raised a ghost which appears to trouble him concerning " The homeless ones of Sydney, and the plan he proposes to lay it is to give it a dose of "judicious protection" whatever that may mean for I maintain that ". judicious protection " and injudicious protection are synonymous, and that judicious protection " at the start ends in injudicious protection at the finish. By the latest advices from Melbourne protection has not reduced its pauper element, but in spite of excessive taxation levied we are told to encourage native industry and to give the people employment, the ranks of the distressed unemployed are there fast increasing, and outnumber to a large extent those of Sydney. That is the result of protection wherever it finds a home, and would also be the case here if it once gained a permanent foothold. That there are some unemployed in Sydney deserv- ing assistance and sympathy three is no doubt, but there are also without doubt those amongst them who have sworn against work. Mr. Foote is evidently gone on protection, for according to his dicta nothing from the production of pig-iron to the manufacture of barbed wire and wire netting can prosper without it, although we have a large number of industries in full going order, and yielding large profits to those who are interested therein, who do not depend on such questionable and degrading support. Permit me, sir, to ask the working men of New South Wales if they intend to allow the protection propagandist of this colony to foist upon them a fiscal system which has been the curse of any country in which it has been tried, and which your Melbourne correspondent a few days ago said that tens of thousands in Victoria abominate, and hoping and praying to have ere long removed? and I hear them make answer emphatically No ! I am, &c.;, THOS. PETERS. February 6.
