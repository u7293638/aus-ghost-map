SLATTERY'S CAMPAIGN. Mr. Slattery opened his campaign in the Fitzroy Division on Monday evening. He had a large audience, but there was a pretty strong hostile element therein. It was, however, insignificant compared with the friendly element; The reception in general given to the candidate augured well for the success of his campaign. Although the issue he has placed before the electors is hostility to the Commonwealth Bill, yet he bad the courage to tell them in the very plainest language that he is opposed to both the land and income taxes of the Reid Government, and is in favour of raising the greater part of the taxation revenue needed by the coun- try by means of duties on imports. In addi- tion to Mr. Slattery, two Protectionists are in the field-one of them a local grocer with a fair following-but it is expected both will retire. It is quite certain that neither of them has a ' ghost of a chance of being returned ; neither would have even if Mr. Slattery were not in the field, and therefore it would be foolish on their part to remain in the .fight.' 'But if either of them remain in, I cannot see how Slattery will win, Many people, indeed, are of the opinion that if the contest is confined to Slattery and the Free trade candidate, Mr. Chapman, the former will be defeated. They, may be right, but whether they aro or not, it is generally admitted that the task' undertaken by Mr. Slattery is not an easy one. As the polling is to take plac√© on the same day that the. people will have to finally decide whether they will accept or reject, the Convention Bill, there will doubtless be heavy voting. If Slattery loses, it will, in my opinion, be useless for him to oppose Mr. Reid in the King Division at the general election. He will have lost prestige, and such a loss is, to a politician, very serious.
