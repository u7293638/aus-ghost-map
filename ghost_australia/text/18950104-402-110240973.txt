AN INDIAN LEGEND. A tradition of the Columbia River Indians will illustrate the belief of the aborigines in the activity of the spirits of their departed friends. The greatest demi god of all was Speel- yai, the coyote. At one time the people were dying at a rapid rate, and there was great mourning. Whai-a-ma, the eagle, who had lost many friends, was told by Speelyai that the dead would not remain in spirit- land, but, like the brown and dead leaves of autumn, would come to earth again with the opening buds and flowers of spring. Whai- a-ma was not willing to wait until spring, and persuaded the coyote to go with him to spirit-land and bring them back at once. After many days they came to a great water, on the other side of which was a large village. Spirits conducted than across the water, and they entered the principal house of the village, which was lighted by the moon ; this luminary was guarded by a monster frog that had jumped to it from the earth. Speelyai killed the frog and swallowed the moon, leaving the house in darkness. In the confusion that ensued, Whai-a-ma caught the spirits and confined them in a large box. Speelyai put the box on his shoulders and the two invaders started back for the land of the living. Soon the spirits in the box be- gan to come to life, and Speelyai's burden grew too heavy for him too carry. Thinking they were so far from the spirit land that the ghosts could not find their way bach again, Speelyai lifted the lid and let them out. They vanished immediately and re- turned to the land of the dead. Whai-a-ma was much disappointed, but said when the buds opened in the spring he would try again ; but the coyote said it was better to let the dead remain where they were. Had not Speelyai opened the box, the dead would now come to life every spring, according to the belief of those who put their faith in the legend.
