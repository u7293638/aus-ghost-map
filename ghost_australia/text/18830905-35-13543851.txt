"THE DEAD MATCH." TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-As a rule, I am peaceably disposed in matters musical ; but almost every time a volunteer or fire brigade funeral takes place, and the " Dead March " is performed, | my seniority is rudely disturbed by the unseemly speed I adopted by our volunteer bands in their performance of the " Dead March," which, in place of being rendered in slow I and solemn time, as originally intended, is rattled over more like a quickstep than anything else. I fun sure some of our local professors of music would willingly give these a and a loss in the performance of this grand and solemn march, and thus prevent the desecration of such a heart I stirring composition as this is, who played in correct time and with proper expression. I can, do., HANDEL'S GHOST.
