He need ask no leave from me, and need run no risk of my rebuff or of Princess Heinrich s stillness He knew all the world of Torstadt Prom favour or fear every door opened when he knocked at it. He knew, among the rest, Victoria s Baron over at Wnldcnweitcr From no place could be better observe the King Nowhere else was it so easy for a man to meet the King He came to Walden w letter, I jumped to the conclusion that to be near me was his only object By a stableman's chance remark, overheard as I vi is looking at my horses, I learnt of his presence on the morning of the day when Ararvilhers was to arrive at Artenberg We were coming together again, we three who had met last for pistol practice in the Garden Pavilion About two o'clock I went out alone and got into my e more It was a beautiful (day no excuse was needed for a lounge in the water I paddled up and down leisurely, wondering how soon the decor would bring me bird A quarter of an hour served the time I saw him saunter down to the water s edge He perceived mc, lifted his soft hit, and bowed I shot across the space between, and brought the canoe up to the edge of the level lawn that bordered on the river ' W hj, what brings you here' I ened His lips curved in a smile, as he replaced his line in obedience to a sign from me ' A passion for the Baroness, sire," said he Ah, that's only a virtuous pretence," I laughed ' You've a less creditable motive'" ' Why possibly, but who tells his less creditable motives' ' I looked at him curiously and attentively He had grown older, Her hair by his ears was grey, and he had ploughed furrows on his face ' W til, ' said I, a man might do even that who talks romance to the Chamber" He gave a short laugh as be lit his cig nette "Your Majesty has done me the honour of leading g what I said Is" ' I am told that I suggested it So runs the gossip in town, Doesn't it 'Mind your opinion on it" I think I went expose myself to your fire again said 1 It was careless lost time, it would be down might fully now" ' Then we are to say no more about it'" he asked, gravely ' Not a word tell me, how came you to know that Coralie loves her impresario' You told Annillters so" his h s twitched for a moment, but he answered, smiling "Because she has married him I heard something of ambition in the case of her career demanding the same lace ' V slander, sire, depend on it It is said in envy of her good fortune " ' Come, come, you love the Baroness so much that you must have all the world in love ' ' Indeed I can think of nobody more in love than I now with the Baroness " 1 think of me, Wetter " As though your Altijcsty could ever be all out from my thoughts,'" said he with a bow t wave of his cigarette, and a smile I laughed outright in sheer enjoyment of his sword play Anti since we parted, where have you been I nsl eel ' I have walked through shall, in such com- penny as the place afforded," he answered, with a shrug that spoke ill for hell's re SOUteCS will join me come out the other side" is there another side ' then yon is still there upon my word I don't know It's so like other places except that I picked up money time " 1 heard that Mr icsuirection made it obvious" V silence fell on both of us, then our eyes met and he smiled and, I knew you meant the Speech for me," I par I I was not entitled to congratulate you offically ' ' Ault have raised a mountain of misconception about mc m I orstudl, ' I complained ' V mountain top is a suitable regal seat and, perin' s, the only safe one " ' Vi don't you speak plainly to me ' ' ' Y es, if it is your pleasur e ' 'I have least of it of any pleasure in the world " ' Well, then, the Countess von Scuipnch grows no younger " "Ivo' "And Coralie Mason has married her in presence ' I know it " ' and my hands grey, and your eyes are (spin We both Itittghcd and fell again to smack me, in silence At last I spoke the line is golden and her eyes are shut,' said I ' Why did you try to open them" Wann t it to look on a hue Bight'" But you knew that the sight was not there ' ' She looked For an instant Then they turned her head the other way ' It was the devil in me You should have seen the chamber' Good God!

come to Artenberg'' "It is Princess Heinrich's house," he objected with a smile For the time, as Then come to me at, Forstner ' "Yes, unless I have disappeared again " He put his hand on the bows of my canoe, and thrust me out into the stream then he stood bring his head, and crumpling up the soft hat in his list I noticed now that his firm was grey all over his head he resumed his hat put his hands in his pockets, and stood without moving, that I turned my back to him Having reached the opposite bank, I looked round He was there still I waved my hand to | him, he returned the signal When we . both began to climb the hill, I to Allen bag he to Waldenweitcr, ho to his misery, I I to my happiness And - which is better, who know s ' At any rate, the Baroness was pleased I mounted through the woods slowly, although I had been detained longer than I expected, and was already too late to greet A*aivillteis on his arrival As I came near the terrace I heard the king of men voices The ladies and gentlemen of the household were all there, may tug a brave and gay group In the centre I saw my family and Miss A*orvilliers himself was standing by Princes Heinrichs side, talk tng fast and with great animation Bursts of glad laughter marked his points There was not a hint of care not a touch of bit Dearness Here was no laughing on a theory, as Wetter called it, but a simple enjoyment a whole heat ted acceptance of the world's good hours Were they not nearer | truth' Were they not, at least, nearer I wisdom' A lonction came on me in a I sudden moment a new resolve entered my head, again Aoivillters roused the impulse that he had power to raise in me I would make trial of this mode of living, and test this colour of mind I had been thin) ing about life when I might have been exulting in it I ran forward to the group, and, as they parted to let me through, I came quiet is to Aarvilliers with outstretched hands He seemed to me a good genius I Even my mother looked smiling and happy the faces of the rest were alight with gaiety Victoria was in the full tide of a happy laugh, and did not interrupt it on account of my arrival Lisa's lips were parted in a smile that was eager and won daring Her eyes sparkled, she clasped her hands, and nodded to me in a deb s tons, surprised men intent I caught A'ai j villiers by the arm, and made him sit by me A ci j arose that he should repeat the hat story for the Kings benefit He complied at once, and launched on some charming abBinditj Renewed applause greeted this story's point A rivalry arose who should cap it with a better flic contact of brains shock spark s Every man was better than his wont, every woman more radiant What the plague had I and Wetter been grumbling and snarling at down there on the river' The impulse lasted the evening out After dinner we fell to dancing in the long room that faced the gardens All mother and the Duchess retired early, but the rest of us set the hours at defiance and revelled far on into the night It was as though a new spirit had come to Altenberg, the very servants were broad grins as they bustled about, seeming to declare that here at list was something like what a youthful King s court should be William Adolphus was boisterous, A memorial forgot that she was learned and a patroness of the units, List threw herself into the inn with the zest and abandonment of a child I vied with Aaivilheis himself, seeking to wrest from him the title of master of the revels He could not stand against me A man man may be stronger than the finest ath late No native temper could vie with my foreign mood Suddenly I knew that I could do to night what I find v only tried to do, that to night, for to night at least, I felt something of what I had desired to feel the blood ran free in my veins, if I did not love her, yet I loved love and for love's sake would love 1 Isi If tonight the barrier between us could be broken down, it need never use ULtim, the vision, so impossible a few hours before, seemed now a faint reflection of what must soon be leaving I looked round for her, but I could not see her is started to walk across the room, threading jury way through the merry company, who danced no longer, but stood about in groups, bandying chaff and compliments engrossed with one another, they hardly I remembered to give me passage Presently ' I came on W tlliiiin Adolphus making him self very agreeable to one of his wife's I at times 'Have you seen Lisa' ' I asked him What, you v e remembered v on duty at last have you' he cried with a burst of laughter ' No, I believe I've forgotten it at last, I answered ' So here is the" ' '1 saw her with You villiers on the steps outside the window ' I turned in the direction which he indi coated, and

the terrace "Wetter'' I whispered, running down the steps and over to where he stood What he miss you here'" ' I could not sleep I saw your lights and I rowed HCIOBB I've been here for an hour " '
