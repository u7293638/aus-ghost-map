Edw ard Manning was Archdeacon of Chichester, surrounded by troops of friends, respected and roveied by tho leaders ot thought in England, and umv ersally regarded as ona of tbo chief pillars of tho Anglican Chuich, when, on Passion Sunday, in tho year lSol, ho turned his back on all tho honours which this woild could givo, and in meokness and humility entered thoono fold otChnst Ho had already refused tho Seo of Adolnidc, in South Australia, n hen the founders of th it diocoso desired to have lum for its first bishop, and it was unquestioned m public opinion that tho highest ccclesiasticul preferments w hich tho statesmen of England could confer wero within his reach It was not bv momentary impulso, nor as tho result of some hasty resolution that he thus forsook thoso honours of tho Estate, und that tho light of Catholic truth shono in all its brightness to his mind Slowly and gontlj Divino Prevalence had guided his footsteps m tho path w Inch leads to tile ity of God Ho made a tour through Puropo in 1818, aud ho sojournod for como weeks m Rome It was a year of revolutions Social ordoi was shaken to its foundations, and in tho general uphcav al old forms of government, with

tho shock ot tho Revolution came the r firms woro turned against themselves whilst tho fetters which would bind the Church were broken , and rulers and people alike recognised tho great truth that the Catholic Church was tho surest mainstay of justice and liberty and tho most effective barrier no less against the despotism of irresponsible power than against the tyranny and tho ruin with which the anti Christian revolutionists and secret societies menaced the world Hence it was that at this very time there had arisen throughout almost even country of Europe a general reaction in favour of tho Catholic Church It was during his stay in Rome that the tint ni of light beamed upon his mind as to tho Di\ ino c1 urns, ot dithol c truth Ho c isuall} cntored ouo morning the Church ot St Louis ot I

Tho decision of the highest tribunal of appeal in tho Gorham controversy, justifying as it did tho Anglican clergynion who would continue ratho ministry whilst rejecting tho doctrino of baptismal rcgoneiatiou, was to Manning tho final summons to renounco the dreams and delusions with which ho had hitherto cndoavoui ed to îocouoilo tho princip os of faith and the traditions of tho Church with tlio Anglican system A ocnos of resolutions drawn up by Dr Manning and his fricuds was ] ubhshed in March, 18o0, protesting against that decision " to admit (thoy snid) tho lawfulness of holding an exposition of an Articlo of tho Creed contradic- tor, of tho ossontial moaning of that articlo is lu truth and in fact to abandon that articlo ," and ' inasmuch as the faith is ono, and resta upon 0110 principio of nuthorit), the conscious, dohbciato, and wilful aban- donment of au article do3ttov s tho Dn mo foundation upon which alono tho entire faith is propounded and 'any portion of tho Chuich which docs so abandon an niticlo forfeits not only tho Catholic doctrino in that articlo, but also tho office and authority to witness and teach as a niemboi of tho Universal Church " lho«o resolutions pioduccd a singular oflect throughout tho vv hole English-spool nig vv orld, but the protct vv as mode lu vam, and tho Anglican Chuich was definitolycouiinitted to the judg- ment that its cleigy mi_ht ailinn 01 deny tho doctrino of baitisniu.1 regeneration as thoy pleased Ihero Moro sovoral ecclesiastical dignitaries who with Man- ning Bigucd the protest against enslaving tho doc- trinal teaching of tho Anglican body to tho soctilar po» or, but only six of thom, vv ith Manning at then head, follow ed at onco the lead ot tho grace of God nndontorod tho true fold Thee 111 tho exuberance of the joy which filled thoir hcnits, saluted Romo in tho sweet w ords penned by ono of them " O Church of tho Liviug Grod, pillar and ground ot the truth, fair as tho moon, bright as tho 6uu, tornblo as au army in battle arra}, 0 Mother o£ baiuts, Doctors, Martyrs, and Vu gins, clotho th}solf 111 tlio robo and aspoct, us thou host tho strength of Hun whoso Body thou art, the lovo for our sake incarnate aluno forth upon Thy lost chtldion, and draw thom to tho douhlo muntum of lhy bosom, tho vv ell-spnng of Iruth and Gruco " Mau} j cars attei wai üb, Di Manning, now Vrchbishop of Westminster, sotfoithinafuvv words tho leusoumg of thoso de- voted men w hou qmttiug tho Aughcau Communion " A church that eau hold its poaco m the presence of hoiosy is not tho Church of God A chuich that has a living consciousness of tho revelation of God, and of a Diviue commission to declare it to n polishing world could not ho ailout Popular tumults, tho power ot governments, loss of endowmonts, of legal position, of life itsolf, could not restiam it rho croatiou of mau may be bound and gigged The word of God is not bound Wnero tho burnt of tho Lord is, there is liberty" Again ho vv rites " I will not stay to ask how such a body (wita va_uo and ambiguous formu- lai íes) is tho pillar aud ground of tlio liuth, 01 tho w itness and kcoper of noly Writ, or the guaidmn of the F nth once doliv erod to the b tints or tho toaohor of the Iruth as it is in cluist, or how it can bo said of its voico, ho that heateth you hoarethMo lo Catholics all this is simply foariul It shocks the first instinct of f nth and fidelity " It w a9 no hurncd step that Manning took whilst turning uwa} from all that hitherto had boen most dear to lura Wlulst telling or the tide of conversion vv Inch sot in on this occasion ho desonbos tho emotions winch stirred his own Soul to its very depths " The gravity of the sub- ject (ho sa}s) and the fear of piccipitatioti cousod thom to act deliberately und to movo olowlj They felt it duo to tho sucredncss of truth to tho relations of public and pnv ate conhdeuce and f nondship, to tho trusts nnd duties of their past life, to tho respect thoy owed to many, and lastly to themselves, to allow no passion or precipitation to bias or huriy them in bo momentous a cr sis, in which a falso stop micrht afiect not themselves only, but many othors, not only for Hub hfo, but for tho life to come Whot in the end they did you know and I shall not say moie than that thoy wcro as keeul} sonsiblo as you could desire thom to be of all the losses and sorrows which they had to bear ni following their reason and their conscience, or, I may moro truly say, the divine voice of tho Church of God But from that hour what befoie was a conclusion of tho intellect became a consciousness of tho soul and au intuition of truth based upon a divine certainty has so filled their vv bolo soul that not only no Bhodow of a momenta! y doubt baa ov or passed ovor thou conscience or thoir reason, but asenso of woudei has or sou in thoir minds how thoy could so long hav 0 failed to perceiv 0 a truth which is now self- evident.
