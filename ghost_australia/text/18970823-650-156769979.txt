TRUNKEY NEWS. [From Advocate Oobiiespohdeint.] Trunkey, Friday. A comedy very closely related to tragedy occurred here the other evening, two sports men and a supposed ghost nearly furnishing material for a sensation. Two of our young men had been out shooting and coming home after dark along a lonely road in a sulky a 'ghost all in white ' sud- denly appeared on the road in front of them. They promptly pulled the horse up and the 'ghost ' appeared to spread its wings and float off into the bush, action which brought one of the lads out of the sulky with his gun to his shoulder demanding of the ' spirit ' that it would disclose its identity or be shot. It dissappeared and the shooters with their hair skywards struck for home. Before they had gone far, however, one of them expressed his dissatisfaction and deter mined to go back and have a final under standing and so the horse's head was turned and they soon came up with the apparition floating on the breeze as at first. This time it was challenged so vigorously with a loaded gun pointed straight at it to explain itself that it consented and the wearer of the fleecy cloak turned out to be one of our esteemed residents getting homeward and naturally careful whom she encountered in the dark. Had not a response come in the second case the gun would most certainly have been fired, so convinced were the occupants of the sulky that they had discovered a real live ghost and that the charge would have passed through a vacuum. All concerned are to be congratulated on the happy ending that was so nearly turning out most unhap pily. Our young sportsmen were much unnerved at finding how nearly they had gone to a tragedy and have decided that as there is no market at present for ghost skins or scalps they will not pursue that line of sports at present.
