TIIE GHOST DEAD-BELL. j It ui now many years since I was quartered with my regiment in Vienna. Among the ac;jua-mt;u:c * I formed there was a youns noblemnn who was in the Imperial Guard, the Bavou Vou Steingraff. He was the sole dttCTntknt of an ancient Styrian family 'that liad lived for centuries in a~castle near Salz burg. X A Uner-hearted fellow could not bfejfound in his Imperial Majesty's dominions, nori^Wtikt4 soldier in the army than Friedrich. Frankand ga\ as a companion, he wa6 a favourite with his own sex, and a good tignre, to say unfiling of a good property, made him not unacceptable with old mammas and young daughters. Friedrich, however, seemed to be no marrying man, though he had nothing misogvnistic in his nature. tion to ifceruaiaeiinonial 6bat£, and inexorable, ;has forbiddeume to qawg^gfe I him untaleiit 'eurpnse.

So come to me as soon as yon can, and who blows bat your happier interpretation of the gipsy's prophecy may, be . the true one :r-' t ? * f r * * I laughed h(^(fly'as^clo6ed the letter. - The. old story T' Woman^s tongue' had overcome man's resolve — pretty Roeschen had whipped the^ withered gipsy 'from the field! And so saying, I packed for my journey aud the morrow found me en route. At the close of a lovely autumn day I drove along the road between Salsburg and St Gilgen where it skirts the picturesque little of Mondsee, so snugly embosomed in precipitous hilisclpthgfl 'withering and lajccfc l£otSar¥tt-m sheltered by tie dark forests on whose bee-tops the evening sun glintened wannly. Thither I worked my way— but slowly— for the approach was steep and circuitous, and by the time J [ reached the) entrance and stood, under the heaTyarch'Softhe doorwlty thet son 'h^ At crakt, stone mass of Ibaflainff' wis ~lym£ in the -gloom- Uns'^gavQ mfe a strange,' unpleasant feeling. Which increased as I stood knocking for many minutes at the heavy Open portal without response from within.

Then the door opened and before me stood a person who looked more like a holzknecht, or woodsman, of the district the servitor of a well-ordered establishment such as I believed Friedrich's to be. He carried a lamp in his hand and over it he regarded me suspiciously. I stated who I inrtjrtfiff**** him to conduct me to his master. To tiiiste made no reply, but shaking his ill-looking head motioned me to follow. W e crossed the great hall and entered a «m»li chamber, where my- strange guide deposited the light «««? left ' with o at a word. ' A strange welcome/' X muttered, ' from a bridegroom to his best man,' then I looked about me. The room in which I stood alone was elegant ly and most comfortablv furnished. There were cases well filled with fapoia running along the walls, and above them itda weapons, many cohStVpeani and famfeg | gear. An €sctitioas of exqoiate workmanship stood near the fireplace, hntco dniwftii fin» pn fee hearth, a few talf-burned fogs laycSld on' .the iron -dags, and again the strange feeling of gloom and aei v mfriies^lsettled upon m Suddenly oonsctous ofcsome oflmc presence, I' looked npfrom the cheerieas hearth. An old* servant man ^tood in the doorway. Bowing respectfully, he entered the room, and in a. few words nlm the mystery of my strange , reception. . On the: very day his. master had j written me, he was Jjrostiatedwifh a serious^ iTlneaer^andMie' 'was now ~ in theeightii day, struggling with the delirium of fever. The doctors of SL (illffen divJanul thn msa t/t *Ka hopeless, but were in constant attendance. One had just left the young Baron and had said he would return, as the crisis would occur that very night. 1 need not say how this intelligence affected me. I determined, of course^ to the wis and asked to ]be shown to ^tteoHch's cm amber. In afewtnoraents^ stood byihehed eide of my dearest friend and looked down on a poor, shattered being, with flushed face, a burning lip and glazed eye, tossing and paving, whose 4iiTid WV4 uncoosiddins it of ,my; loving pTWirre.Cl^afc ^«de hfni ior hitrars.1- From - time to time I could distinguish words, through his mutteringe, which told how the bewildered spirit wrestled with horrible phantoms. With appalling incongruity he mingled scenes of the bndal chamber and the chaniel vault, now call ing on his bride to wrap her grave-clothes about her, now bidding the sexton pledge bim in a skull of vine. Terrible as all was to hear and painful to see, I determined to watch through the night, and the faithful ^ld buiier begged to remain also. Indeed, I felt so nervous ana distressed that I was glad of his company. The doctor was to return at midnight \Fhen it wanted but two hours of that time, Friedrich — who had gradually cease4 his raving, fell into a lethargic slumber. 1 left tbe bedside and went to sit by the fire. Old Klaus threw on a freflhlog and filled a glass with Hungarian ' wine from a flask on thetable. T nntiraf tlini: the old fellow's hand trembled and that his eyes were full of tears. I spoke a few -words of comfort and he sobbed aloud : ' AlaE I Herr Hauptmann, my mind mis gives me sadly ! X fear, every moment, that I shall hear the dismal ringing of the Ghost Dead At this uncanny title. I shivered. ' But what mav that be ?,F 1 asked anxiously. . 'Ach! What an -old 'fool I 41L . I forget lsometime&— but forgive it.' *' But Klaus,1* saad Z, what did yon mean r,T Klaus bent toward 4oe, his old face -drawn with fear. 'The.heU that rings out the life of every Von Stoograff,' said he, wi£h suppressed emotion. I suppose I looked both startled interested, and the old servant, glad of svm pathv and attention, continued in a. IiorW ' Mav|iap_ you observed ^t}ie moxiastexT war the cara%'-sir, as you cametip the driTCr' Klnns, and a fine, old ruin it is, with JnUtabore tteKTOtonase^itadji ; tbe abb-rt;-^»e baron wasafiercgfafl Tinnrftty ^ ^an t^bcaj^d little for choi^ilm^rieBt, a^d the abbot was as haughty in his way. bo the ^ feud -grew deadlier €renr day. Atvlast ithe abbot swore on &e; holy relics of Saint WcK gang that he would excommunicate the boron. And the baron swore by the cross upon tfs sword hilt that he weald tear the frock off the abbot's back and drive him and his monks out ef the monastery. The abbot was as good as -his word, and so, on the feast -of 'the blesed Saint Wolfgang, he and all -h«« mooks walked in procession through the churdi up - to the high altar aud the great book was opened and the anathemas read, and then the bell was tolled and the lighted caudles extinguished, and thus tiie baron waa«xcotnmunicated.' 14 Well! The bell was still tolling -und the priests were on their way back 'down- the uailft vhotl tfiA aVinttifl nf t-ia Viar^.n l.i. wild men-at-arms, his jigers and holz knedits rang at the walls, and sledges great pine beams were battering at the gates. ' Shortworkthey made of it! ' One mad fellow seized a splinter of wood and lit it at the altar, and then he fired the panels and the roof, and the dry wood was all ?soon in a blaze. The baron, as if posessed by an evil spirit, seized the bellrrope and rung out' a wild peal of triumph. But the abbot walked up to him, dressed in all his robes, and holding up his hands, cursed In* in in the name of the blessed Trinity, and said : M * As the Ev3 One peals that bell now through your hands, so shall he peal it when he dams the soul as it passes from the body of you and of your son, and of your son's son, in asecsls, smculorum. Amen !' ' So saying, the abbot called his monks, and they went their way down to the Lake of Aver. But the baron and his followers threw themselves upon the holy men and tore tie frocks from their backs and threw their books into the lake. The baron then seized the monastery lands, and held them, too, for might was right in those days, and he built tiie pre sent castle liard by the ruins of the monastery lest the abbot and his retainers should rally and seek to regain their old possessions. But they never did, for the abbot was not over loved in the country, and the baron was too powerful to be lightly meddled with, so the niouks built them a new monastery, where tho Church of Saint Wolfgang now stands. ' Time passed on and the baron had well nigh forgotten that abbot or monk had ever dwelt within the old blackened monastery walls. _ * 4 One wild winter's night the baron sat with .ac;nBL h«ii »-. veling,' as was their wont. The wind howled , in gusts fifiully, and in the pauses a loud kno3k; lug was !&|§g9fL2&$he open door, the very do§r| by wHcffyty£reffl&ed; this evening, Herr Haupt mann. TheThurhiiter, when he opened the door, saw no one, though the moon was at that moment shining through the drift of the clouds, but he felt a cold blast sweep across his face. So he shut the door again, and thought it must have been the storm that hatLdeceived him. ' The iiext moment those in the hall saw a monk ?t*3r hlackrfaabit, ' th his cowi.-idrawn , clcselyl|re| hi3phead,)entferand wadl^^^th Th.pn * 2 shouted^^^$Mt^oi^ in a hollow and solemn voice : * This night twenty years yc a and I met.

'* and again the old servant fell to weeping. -i Hush, Klaus, lest you disturb him,' 1 said hastily, although a glance at my poor Friedrich well nigh assured me that few sounds would disturb more. Then 1 paced the room and out into the hnll and down the stairs, for I heard the sound of horses at the gates, and I kney.the jahxsician had come* I .let him go up, alone, wmlell sat for aifew moments in ; the little chamber I hadjbeen jBhosmgto o£l a^y , arrrfal. vfItrouldr'no4 'iSfce'^y'ntnito^l from ftie : story of the Ghost-!BeILv X am not naturally credulous, but the shock X' had received after i the weariness of my journey of several days j had, X^uppose, told upon my ^nerves.

The&X; went to the chamber below. Old Klaus crept afterme. Heseemed to cling to me for sympathy, X sat down by the fire with a heavy hearL X pondered on the doctor's .words. I found myself wondering why X had put the question to 3nm, and then X recalled, arord for word, his iumrer. v-' A sudden thought shot through my brain. Hie had spoken of an old gipsy who stood, wiihtroisfccetched hand, by the roadside. Another scene rose before me. A fair-haired lad with his firm palm held ' fnnkiy4m£^ withered, oldiEsceibent over it, i ^^^fl^^^hecy^ ^^OTng' BGot, take heel I to your wading day!

I learned that she was lovely and amiable and ?Aeeply enamoured^ her ^handsome lover. His ilhiBW ^lad^heoilrept^lmzn her as long as possible, and though she knew her marriage must be postponed, she dreamed, as yet, of no change. 'AUs2M said j Klaus, 'should my lord not .recover, ..X∾ & ,wi&gor; hftf^ -,w5th the sweet young lady, for she loves him more than life. Who knows but there may be two burials rather than one bridal 1' *? The way to God's altar lies through God's acre 1' Would the words ever cease ringing in my ears? X shook myself impatiently. A coinci dence — & sad coincidence — that was all ! And my grief had surely unsettled my mind. X picked up a-book-from-one-of the shelves and tried to read. The words swam on the page. Not a sound was to be heard save the ticking of the great clock in th^ halL X laid down the book and sighed. J ust then the clock told the midnight hour. The deep bell struck twelve times loud and clear, and mechanically X counted eve:y stroke. Midnight ! A sudden thought — the crisis ! ISien my poor Friedrich might, even now. be passing the portal of Eternity! covered that he slept, exhausted, on the h«Tth ' God forbid,*' I cried aloud in my fear. 'Poor faithful soul !' thought X. 'Rest there awhile — you may awake to deepest grief!' For X realised that he, like myself — like Boeschen — most lose, with Friedrich, that which he best loved on eartiu . So X rose noiselessly, and passed sadly nnd aloneinto fhe great stone ball. A breath ' of cold air swept my Xt came from the end of the hall-nlown there, toward the outer doors. Xwasjrierced through and through ^fith its dull touch. Certainly, tiie outer doors most be open ! Could inan^ in his £4ixiety, . hare, forgotten to close them after the the doctor's entrance? X peered through the vista of dimly lighted arches toward tiie entrfhee and moved a few steps in thataliraeBon. As X &ids6;,l was sure I heard ; a muffled knocking at the nort&L; T lubtniwl intentiy and after a moment the sound was re* peated and followed almost imni ed t w tely ^the' sUpping oS a bolt; wifnab one, and^btHi aee ^j^^deariy -J-^re tae, jgndul^ accustomed jb^|he semi-daikness, and-T'perceived' tte massive~'doors swing in ward on their ^reat iron hinges, to admit a tall, daik fignr&xn; hood and doak. f8A priest !'

And f thai . again: Who has admitted him V' X, myself, had seen £his daik figure pass through doors bolted , and barred ! I had heard his muffled knocking I I saw him now before me, and yet of a certainty X knew that none had bade him enter, nor had any hand unclosed the gates to j give him entrance ! ? 1 Smitten with a nameless fear X stood, or rather leaned, against one of the stone pillars | for support. The dark figure now moved j toward me down the hall. Nearer — nearer it j came, and X saw that X was right — it was the figure of a nriest. . As he passed dose beside me his cowl fell back and revealed an old, wrinkled, ashy face in which were set two gleaming eves— ^black I andevil. Helooked not to the right nor the I left, but as he passed up the wide stair, he | raised one thin, white hand above his head, and the dark sleeve fell back and. showed the skinny, withered arm hare to the elbow. X stood frozen with terror to the spot — I know not -for howlong — when a harsh sound smote upon my ear. Xt was followed by a shrill scream, and old Klaus rushed from the room and threw himself at my feet. ' God have mercy - upon u* V' he shrieked, almost crazed with fright — ' the Ghost BeH !' Again came tbe harsh sound — the clanging of the iron bell! Xt smote cruelly upon my shattered senses — wild, fitful, irregular — and, God forgive me ! not as 'human hand could have rung it ! X flew un the Rbura — ITIftna dose behind mo. In a moment X was in the Baron's chamber. The physician laid his cold hand on mine — I saw the* truth written in his face — ' It is over,' he said.
