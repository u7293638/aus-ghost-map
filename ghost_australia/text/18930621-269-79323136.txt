I looked from one to the other. X felt ecaxed. I suppose I showed the feeling, for ' both men fipemed concerned. * Three l3' I said, in a curiously questioning voice, as if I were not sore of what I had seejj. * TT^omrwh'n1 (thai Wax tiie stoker Who had been J£Us) * and the new men-I don'tkaow their faces' * You'd bettor go to the. doctor again,' aid Pfctejfson - ' I was in tHere five minutes before ypueame; there was only Thompson and Biolker, one of the new hands, there ; .lid nobody has.gonein since.' * You see double, Logan,' said Danvera smiling. I was silent; nothing could have been easier than to return to the stoke-hole, and there and then «ettle the matter. But I had a sort of shrinking from seeing again that strange red figure, and preferred dropping the dispute. . . Thinking , over it later, it seemed probable that theothiers were right. Hat fierce light might piwiuce sill manner of effects, and the third man Bad certainly looked shadowy enough to be only an optical delusion. ? Bat thesecmd time I saw Holker was in broad daylight. I met him face to face in the - passage ^.running forward past the gurnets' cabins, an$L again there seemed someone behind him, another- man -a filmy shape, and yet distinct. I felt paralysed. There was nothing remarkable about the stoker-a quiet man, rather 'dose* with his mates, and therefore not much liked; but we engineers found him a good worker. I thought die fever was stall' about me, , but then I felt strong and well, slept soundly, and ate as only a eon valescentcan. I took to watching Holker, although I had a most horrible nervous feel ing about Mm. I asked Paterson once, and also the thirdengineer, if they saw anything odd about the man. Nothing at all, they said. Couldn't they see, I thought, that something always behind the stoker, that wasn't a likeness of him ? Whenever lesir him I saw it too-in the lurid glaze of the fire, about the lower deck and passages, in the fresh, sunshiny air-Was I mad, or was everyone else blind ? 1 Danvera/ I said, ione night; -he and I were walking thedeek, smoking; 4 do you believe in uncanny things ?' * Do yon mean ghosts ?* *Kbt exactly. I wish, you'd let me tell you something, only don't laugh at me.' ^Siot for worlds, I am not an entire un believer, and X know you have very devout belief in thesethingB," said Danvers. 1 IWih- It's about this Hblker. Do yon remember when I first saw him? I told Eaterson tljei® w»re three men.*. ' *' * . ' three figures-God knows -whefcherroeraild tfas a man/ I said in a trembling voice. 'It is no fancy. I, have \- proved it to be none. I am not ill-my nerves aie not unhinged; they axe as steady as yours. Always I see behind Hblker a shape-1 . '"What you Scotch call a wraith,' said Danrerg-*a warning of his death.* '*? * A wraith is a likeness of the person ' warned-this shadowy form is not in the least like Holier. What does it mean ?' I vaid pausing by his sde-Aen was a 'sort of despair inmy heart! 1 Why do I alone see it ? Is there something for me to do, ^ad I do xu^lowwwiiat?' I could feel that Danvers was sympathetic though he waseUent. ' It is veiy strange/ lie said thoughtfully. ' Xfcioay be ihat pa alone are a ghost-seer.' I hare read Hunt some people neFer can see anything. ' Ton do not doubt me tihen ?* *1 hardly know what to Bay. Can you de ; is aa cltear aBday, though bo misty.

Isaidspringingnp; my heart waB boding wildly. 'Hushl Sit down again. I was sent" on the tt&dk; ©f & murderer. We had certain information that he had escaped to Africa some wee&s; ago.

'The man wasatnutedserrait,lialf nurse. The murder-a peculiarly horrible one on a defenceless "man-was committed evidently for purposes of robbery. We shall find some of the spoil in Holker'e ehest. The murderer escaped, but we have evidence that will surely hong him. How do you see how great a service you have unconsciously done? Probably but, for this strange interposition, the mnniered man would never have been avenged. Our false information would have misled us, and while we wasted time in rectifying it, Holker would very likely have been lost to us altogether. ' I see/ was all I could say. | ' Now I have my hand on him/ said the ' detective. ('He is, of course, disguised I will arrange a plan, in which I shall need your Kelp, to Btrip him of this disguise. I arrest him, and he and I are put ashore at the first port we touch at, and return to England.* * Claim my entire cervices/ I said- 11 can hardly yet believe X am in my right'senses. Why was I, who know nothing of the circum stances, who was ignorant of the existence of Ijouis Temple-why was I chosen to bring thb horrible crime to light V 1 Ah, there we *get into the unfathomable,' said the detective.' beyond me, and beyond wiser and better people than L I don't see how one can get over the facts-which is all we have to do with.® That argument did not satisfy me, though I knew I never eoulclf get beyond it this eide the vail. The etrange, the awful thing was that the next time I saw Holker, the shadow was cone- " We made our plans, and I soon saw how necessaty my aid m I was thrown much more across the stoker than Danvers was, and the mifal movement was to drug the man, get him into my cabin tinder pretence he was ill, and there satisfy ourselves of his make-up.

I myself was the aensqtion of the hour, but I tried to avoid curious questioners. There was something top awesome to me in the mystery in which I had been the instrument to allow me to discuss it with, every idle tattler.
