Iíg1¡itej3 ^p 'by» lurid sunset-now into a ' - wood through which the narrow road wriggled like a snake, and the many pools .scattered amongst the trees were red as ~ bloVdín the rays of of the" angry setting. The trees themselves were huge without being beautiful, scant of foliage, with hideously .distorted branches-more like a hospital of crippled paralytic trees than a ri gepyo of .healthy timber.

Soon we- drove through a beautiful villagô with quaint gabled houses and a noble old Norman church. A' bright, rippling river flowed under the high-pitched arch of au ancient bride, "Oarstair," said my driver, in in answer to an; inquiring glance. Leaving the village behind us, we. drove through au avenue of .splendid beeches, and at length reached au aged and lordly gateway, its tall pillars surmounted by 'grotesque Hons, it was now almost the gloaming. A lovely child oponed the gato for us, sud" a quarter of an hour brought us through a majestic demesne to ail open from which I'saw "The Friary," a grand pile bf varied' Goihip; grey vjith a' great, age,. dr«jauiiugly and sadly V^utïfUl -iq. fha " pal$ witchery,"of a rising.'iiioon.' ..I was.sopnfiu a vast,and dimly lighted hall, welcomed by an. bid Uiau.wjio received me with the address .'of a well-bred servant, and by his elderly and comely wife* Everything was ready for my!reception in tue library, which opened into the hall,« cosy supper; in the great 1 gallery, the state -bedroom/ with cheerful -fire (for the night- was chill ) and :foür'-'täM: candles lightiug -Up dimly the oppressive grandeur of tue mighty four- poster, iii which générations of vanished Carstairs had'slept and died. t 'was'liungry and' tired, and, having soon consumed , my pleasant. meal, »n^d.e my way to bed,.., . ..

J confess I felt both angry and alarmed*; -Thougli I had nb belief ia the supernatural.

However, £ resolved to take things quietly .-to keep tty'eyes open ; and iu this spirit Went down stairs to the ample breakfast prepared for me. During ' the1 day I wandered through the house, through room after room full of quaint and antique furniture, the pictures of Carstairs old and young, civil and military, male and female; queer and valuable nlcknacks, curious ornaments of Asiatic" make, draw- ing-room toys of all kinds, ; grotesque china, books full of rare and Startling prints; presses full of old clothes.'from the buff .leathern jerkin of the soldier of the . Commonwealth to the fall. dress swallow-tail of modern times ; dirty piles of newspapers and manuscripts; weapons , of all characters, rusty with age. The rooms ran along the sides of galler-¡ ' iee lighted- at each end by -windows of j richly stained glass, the walls covered with paintings of great value, with ! recessed arches at intervals, in which ! stood mailed figares ia various attitudes' and 'with divers arms. Evening and dinner-time had come before I had completed my intensely interesting survey, and, not a little wear- ied,! sat down to a meal which did credit to the kitchen of Dame Mallory. The solids disposed of, I was peacefully enjoy ing a bottle of rare old Madeira from the well-stocked cellars of the Friary when I was startled' by a noise immediately be- hind my chair, followed-by the "Shee-e" I had heard twice before. I leaped to my feet, and turning quickly around, saw the' back of my slim, grey-clad friend with the thin legs vanishing through the. door. In an instant I was in the hall, which was' well lighted, "but, save a cosy little cat' that ; was placidly asleep, before ' the i fire, there was no sign of life. I oould stand it no longer : ringing the : bell, I summoned-Dame Mallory (her old husband had .gone to bed), and questioned her sharply as to-the-number of inmates in the Friary. ' Her hushahd, herself, Jonas Moflak, the porter ami coachman, two maid ser vants, and a stableman-that was certainly all.t Had she ever1 "Heard of anything curions or uuaccountable about the house, P Well, she had. She had hoard of such things .-nothing definite. She herself had seen nothing,.or.heard nothing either, 1 questioned no further, ordered a strung cup of coffee, and devoted myself to some literary work, at. which I was in-.arrears. Soon at such pleasant labour all else was forgotten ; and the clock striking mid- night,' I rose, set aside my manuscript, lighted my caudle, and, with my iniud. full of ray subject, made my way to the bedroom, which I locked. I was undressing slowly beiora the fire,' taking, as was my wont, to myself, whou the door 'stealthily opened. Agaiu 1 heard the noise' and.'the *' Shee-e." The thiug was.. becoming intolerable. I moved a few .'paces towards tho door, which'now Stood distinctly ajar, but tho slim gentle- man did not, as, hitherto, show himself. Reassured by this fact, I walked boldly OD, Seized the handle, and threw the door wide opeu. There he was-I could have touched <him-the long, thin back, the quaint; attenuated legs, the' antique - grey suit. He moved ou before ina rapidly, ;btit with perfect ease.' AU fOeling of foat had 'how. left ins. I felt convinced ij, was the victim of a trick, and caudle in hand, followed him boldly.. .He reached, the foot' of' a 'Winding', staircass .leading-; to a part of- tho mansion that '. had beou .abut up for -moro' thau a century, ¡ iud which I intended to "open and explore next day..
