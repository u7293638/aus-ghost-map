FrasT Dr.--Mo ?An.AAaxt 17. 'he revival of races on the-favonrite and tnme honoured course of Homebush has, so far, proved a Jow-'j-o.teeocess. Not, only ,were the peomoters Sod bld E?glisb sport at Homebush suocessful to i sgud ? tho. weather on this, the Bat day of.their "ewra mei- itor it:wasr loelyprd y, otwithstmad. ing tho.,tomw .o?.fer?id.rays of.the sn ,inthei earlier'artof tie day--but their energetic efforts of the .lsaepncf k ovpenusated-in the easemmblage ofan ammense concoprm?e of people, numbering from10,000 to 12,000 permons, It wase statedbymany persons who a~re well acquaiinted with the receseeting at Homebush in proevoqa yam, that apeh a large number had never ceiegregatei on the old conrse before. Ihe duty of keeping the course clear immediately before each race and wh~ile it.was being run, was a dificult one, and thee os certainly not a.suffcient fome on the.ground toePE ·bi p important ob?et. F?ortunately, however, there'wer noecedent ?nsing from this cause. There .as, iudee, but one accident that we heard of, from any source during Phe day, and that wae from the fall ing of Mr. Tait'iblsFon, at the baeck of the course, when runi in a prominent position for the Maiden Plate. The jcekey (Metineer) wea burled headlong o the ground, Got fortunately escsped comparatively uhurt, although the two horses immediately behind him jumped over him. Thehorse was unoteoo ortunate, as tiere. was a large piece cut out of his stife and he was otherwise injured. The course was very hard indeed- more lilke Ge>x-estreet than a race-course. The favourites were singularly unfortunate. Sir Solomon wa a favourite for the Maiden Plate, but he had not the ghost ofa chance against Mr. Coberoft's Voltigeur. For the Homebush Bevival nothing would go down but Mnemon, and he was backed for level moneyagninat tbhe field; but he made a hollow show of himelf bhy running fifth, the nrce being cleverly won by Mr. Ryans a Brisbane. Boman was an equally ~good favourite for the Publican's PFurse, bat here agam the pot boiled over, and the favourite obtained.naught but the empty honour of third ltee Atcaeon having won the race with comparative ease. With regard to the railway, the arrangements for conveying people to Homebush could scaresly have been better, and those for taking them away could not have been worse. Hundreds of persons stood on the reitway platform for upwards of three houn before a train wa in readiness to convey them to their resapec tivre localitie~, and an infinitely larger number waited upwards of two hours a stated. Many of those who had paid for first-clas carriages were glad enough to goet bk in a horse box or cattle pen. A great im provement must be medein the railway arrengements of the Homebush races are to succeed. With this by way of preliminary, we append a de. tailed account of the raemg. First Race.-The Maiden Plate of 10D sovereipns, with a sweep of 8 sovereigns added, for all maiden horses (including winners of two-year-old stakes) at the time of entrance; weight for age; second horse to meeive 25 aovereeign out of the stakes; distane 1* mile; no maiden allowanee ; penalties for winning after entrance, onc ie b., tee or more llb.

Sir Sblomon delared to carry three pounds'ovor weight. The lot appeared to get any well together, and there weas but little differense in their positions when they reahebed the stand; which was passed as follows :--Vol tigeur first Sir Solomon second (two lengths behind the leader), Falcou third, and Buckstone fourth, a dozen lengths in the rear. This order was maintained until they were lost to view behind the hill, and when they emerged Voltigeur was still leading, and apps ently had t all his own way, while Sir Bolomon was .sti-llag second. At the distanoee Sir Solomon made a game but fruitless eFort, for he could not get nearer than two lengths of Voltigeur-a rank outsider in the betting---end thimeus the favourite had to be contntt with seoond money. Hotepur was third about a dosen lengths behind the second horse. Time, 2 minutes 56 secondse. Falcon fell in this rae whlen running promi nently, em noticed elsewhere, and his jockey was some what heavily shaken by the fall. Second Rece.-Homebush Bevival, of 75 sovereigns, with a sweep of 8 sovereigns added, for all horses; weight for age: It mile, winners at starting-of any £100 prize 7 lb. extra, of £200 or over 10 lb. extra.
