SELECT POETRY. AFTER THE CURFEW. -. The play is over. While the light Yet lingers iu the darkening hall, X come to say a last good night Before tho tlual exeunt all. We gathered once, a joyous throng ; The jovial toasts went gaily round ; With jest, and laugh, ami shout and song, We made tho floors and walls resound. We come with feeble steps and slow, A little band of four or lire, Left from the wrecks of long ago, Still pleased to And ourselves alive. Alivo ! IIow living, too, aro they Whose memories it is ours to shore I Spread the long table's full array- There sits a ghost in every chair 1 One breathing form no more, alas ! Amid our slender group we see; With him wo still remained 44 the class"— Without his presence what are we 1 The hand wo over loved to clasp— That tireless hand which knew no rest — Loosed from affection's clinging grasp, Lies nerveless on the peaceful breast. The beaming eye, the cheering voice, That lent to life a generous glow, Whose every meaning said 44 rejoice," We see, we hear, no more below. The air seems darkened by his loss, Earth's shadowed features iook less fair, And heavier weighs the daily cross His willing shoulders helped us bear. Why mourn that we, the favored few Whom grasping Time so long has spared life's sweet illusions to pursue. The common lot of ago have shared ? In overy pulse of Friendship's heart There breeds unfelt a throb of pain- One hour must rend its links apart, Though years on years have forged the chain. So ends "The Boys"— a lifelong play. We, too, must hear the prompter's call To fairer scenos and brighter day. Farewell ! I let the curtain fall. —Oliver. Wendell Holmes in the atlantic.
