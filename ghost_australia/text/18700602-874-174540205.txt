AN AUSTRALIAN POEM. (Written in the approved style by Our Special Poet.) WHERE the wallaby wobbles for ever, By forest, by fell, and by tree, Comes the rush of the rain-riven river, "Swirling" down to the straits of the sea! Now Dandenong darkens, and voices Sonorous "brool" up from the bay; Now twilight and tremulous noises Are passing like phantoms away! What matter, ye woodlands, what matter, At the fall of the nebulous night, If a poet can't say who's his hatter As he topples home, turbulent, tight? Though "EUTERPE" be eaten with apples For sauce on her beautiful breast, What odds while the winter-sun dapples The nose of the wildering west? Are we to sit down in the ashes, With faces of sorrow and scorn, Because of the sodas and dashes We've mournfully taken at morn? Is it well to be comic and cunning In the heart of this hyaline land, Where peddling pays better than punning, And grocers are glaucous and grand? Far better, O darling, to "slither" Down depths of a bandicoot hole, Where ghosts of solicitors shiver In realms of the boreal pole.
