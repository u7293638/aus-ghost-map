CURRENT LITERATURE. At the present time, when the Egyptian question continues to occupy the attention of Europe, a book such as Mr Nassau Senior Con i ci sailor s and JonrnaU (Sampson Low and Co ) possesses great interest, It is true that Mr. Senior did not begin to keep his record till November, 18, and that tends within a few months after, 10s the value of his testimony, as conveyed in the well known manner of "conversations," can scarcely he exaggerated. Egyptian a country, as one of Mr Senior's correspondents remarks, which does not change What it was seven and Event) years ago it is today, and probably not very different from what it has been any time during these thousand and odd years The most remarkable of the Egyptian characteristics is this sameness The Government, the religion, the outward features of the country may alter, but the Egyptian remains the same The fellah is probably to do) what he was in the days of the Pharaohs the same in physique, in character, and in aspirations His rulers, whether Greek, Arab, Turk, or Mameluke, have made but little impression on him, taking from him nothing but taxes. All their efforts to plant themselves on the soil have been in vain, for Egypt is a land where no race of men thrives but the Egyptian. As one of Mr Seniors interlocutors remarks, himself a native Egyptian -'Torthelaat 2,000 years we have been under the domination of the H)ksos(the name given to the first foreign dynasty) It is the second of their irruptions that has been recorded, and it has been the longest. is perhaps, the worst The Perman the Macedonian, the Roman, and the Arab IlykBos were all more civilised than the Turkish Hyksos. Perhaps, we shall remain under the HyltBoa for 500 years longer perhaps for 700 But what are 3,000 years in Egyptian chronology'' Atthetimo of Mr Senior's visit, Said was the reigning pasha, a son of Mehemet Ali, who had just succeeded Abbas, assassinated His character is variously given by Mr Senior's witnesses, according as they were more or less dependent on him for favours past or to come By the French party he was described as an intelligent and successful ruler, chiefly because he favoured the policy of France, not so much out of love for France, but out of hatred for his nephew and predecessor, who preferred England. By others Said is characterised as a stupid, selfish, and frivolous tyrant, whose Parisian education had given him nothing but a good French accent and a turn for badinage M, de Lesseps, who figures largely in these pages, was of course on the side of those who thought well of Said Pasha, as he was then in treaty for the construction of the Suez Canal, a work which, there is no reason whatever to doubt, was forced upon the Egyptian viceroy as on atonement for what Abbas Pasha had done for England, As Abbas had made the railway to please England, he Said was pressed to make the Canal to please France. It is curious to read of some of the vaticinations respecting the Canal by the light of recent events Among the other arguments urged upon the Falaba, the chief was the enormous benefits which it would confer upon Egypt, besides those which would accrue to the civilised world It would enrich the Pasha himself, first, by a rent reserved to him of 15 percent on the net profits, and, secondly, by the increased wealth of his subjects Certainly, in whatever other respects the Canal has succeeded, it has not fulfilled either of these expectations The Suez Canal has not enriched but ruined the Viceroy, and is likely to put an end to the ruling dynasty) It was the first and chief cause of Egyptian indebtedness as it has been ever the cause for all the other extravagances which the Egyptian viceroys have committed Instead of being a source of wealth, it is paper petual drain on the Egyptian people, who, by means of the Canal, are deprived of all the benefits which they formerly derived from their position as the great world a highway The commerce and the wealth which the Canal has developed have been enormous, but it all goes past the Fgrptitma Nor, politically, can it be said that the Canal has been any blessing, but rather a curse to Egypt, at least from the patriotic point of view, The one reason why we cannot leave Egypt to the Egyptians is because of the Suez Canal, and it is the Suez Canal which, by a curious irony of fate, has served as the basis of the last brilliant campaign for the suppression of the native insurrection M De Lesseps him self, by a refinement of cruelty, having been made by destiny to help in using it in favour of the English dominion of the varied contents of Mr. Senior a book it is impossible to give any adequate idea within our limits. His method is to engage every leading person be meets, Egyptian or European, connected with tbeadmimatration, in talk, setting down with admirable clearness and point all the in formation which bears upon the character of the country, its rulers and their policy His witnesses do not by any means agree, but we always have an opportunity of comparing their opinions and of judging for ourselves of their worth One of the most intelligent of Mr Seniors informants was an Armenian, hekekyan Bey, brother in law to Arthur Pasha who was for many years the favourite Minister of Mehemet Ali Of Mehemet Ali himself we hear a great deal, thebalauceof testimony being all in his f w our He was a great man. and a true ruler of men, who made Egypt what it in lifting her from the rank of a Turkish passage almost to a level with civilised states Of his family, save only Ibrahim, who had a real genius for war, there has not been one as yet who has been other than vile, the best of them not rising higher than a decent mediocrity Among the other shrewd things said by Kekekyan Bay it is curious to come upon this one, apropos of the prospects of national rule in Egypt -"The good that I expect from a revolution is that it will accelerate the European intervention, which is my only real hope The European intervention has come, though hardly in the manner which sortie of those prophets had predicted All through this period namely, 18 " 6. we cannot help seeing that men a eyes were turned to the prospect of a collision in Egypt between France and England, the general opinion being that France, as the nearer and more active of the two powers, would prevail This has not happened, but perhaps it is a little too early to speak of the end of the latest turn in Egyptian affairs To those who would gain an insight into the politics of Egypt as well as into the character of the country and the people, we can heartily recommend these two volumes as by far the best contributions to our knowledge! of the subject A very good specimen of the opinions and the language of the people called ' aesthete is furnished in beautiful House), by Mrs Haweis (Sampson, Low and Co ) Mrs Haweis is the wife of a well known and eccentric West End preacher, and the beautiful houses are the dwellings of some of her friends which have been decorated in the latest aesthetic styles The little book is beautiful in itself, in a style which any lover of books must approve, with old fashioned broad faced type, thick ribbed paper of a subdued tint, flowery initial letters, and delicate head and tail pieces the ink is not too black nor the paper too white, and the margins are of the widest As to the contrary, it is hard to speak of them with gravity Mrs Haweis proposes to hold up to public admiration and presumably to imitation, certain houses which are declared to be truly artistic, according to the purest spirit of " the present re renascence of art in England This is one mark of the true aesthete to speak of renascence in place of the vulgar n finance The homes themselves, we are a little disappointed to learn, do not rolled any well defined period in art, but " are typical of certain minds and arranged with exquisite feeling devotion, and knowledge or at least which is rather a letting down from that great weight-" with all the skill that money and thought command in the nineteenth century,' When we come to the houses selected for description, we see at once that money has a great deal to do with it The house of Sir Frederick Leighton, the president of the Royal Academy, for instance might he the abode of some rich buyer of pictures able to command the services of professional decorators, regardless of expense quite as well as the home of one who is an artist in himself From the spacious vestibule, with its dead black drawings ' dotted with hollow gilt rosettes, to the presidents workroom, whose own sketches " breathe upon the cases, and carry us into an Arcadia where the music of the free hills and streams was in the shepherd s pipe the freedom of the bird and the flower in the maidens hearts -the money is at least as conspicuous as anything else Passing through ' peacock)- green arches into balls of " deepest sea blue tiles, with " hard floors (" the well known Mosaic of the Cesare palaces ) which caatup"ahtm mering lights upon the green, silver ceiling like water itself we feel we are among scenes which whether beautiful or not, are certainly expensive Mr Haweis is forced to confess, with a proud shame facedness, that " there is undoubtedly bore an important stateliness and strength of flavour, while the silence is like a throne There is a good deal of this strong flavour and throne like silence in the description, where language glows like one of Sir T s own Arcadian yet perhaps waxy pictures Let us quote he concluding sentence of it to show what is the too too utter in style -"Sweet opal visions we have had, but not the transmigration of our spirit into a land of peace and health and beauty and innocence, fair moonlight ghosts have passed before us, but not such as these, who might have breathed where How is this for high' as our Yankee friends say-Mrs Homing, indeed! Henceforth we shall take Mr Haweis for our guide to the whispering of the sweet ideal When we come to the house of the late Mr Burges, however, we shall find our notions of true art a good deal disturbed Mr Burges, it is interesting to know, was in the habit of using drinking vessels so precious that they were a pass to his friends to handle, from which we are made delicately to understand that Mr Haweis had been used to dine with Mr Burges In respect to furniture and decora- tion Mr Burges, according to all Philistine notices must be pronounced a little cocoa tree In his bedroom, of which the shutters are "plain gold, the knobs on the bed posts, the shelves of the tables, scintillate with facts "What is not pure gold in crystal, while "the whole room is like an ancient shrine, a reliquary There is no accounting for the ob For ourselves we would never sleep in a bedroom like this with the knobs on the bed-post scintillating with facets, the utensils all gold and crystal Enough has been said, perhaps, to give our readers a taste of Mt Haweis book, which, indeed, both for its language em d its curious revelations of the inner » athletic mood, is quite too precious.
