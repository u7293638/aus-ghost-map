All rights reserved.] CHAPTER V. : Theodosia returned home on favorable terms with herself and with the world. Vanity, that last survival of the passions, was sated. A couple of hundred francs, ? large gains in little Montr-eux, weighted her purse. She invited her dame cle compagnie to her rooni: A fairly pleasant evening, though, in deed, Polly, I grieved . to see you without attention — left in the cold. The men nowadays . are all for maturity.' Lady ,Erne glanced' at her mature charms in the mirror 'before which she had sunk. 'Women of fifty are the rage, and I do not think it fair on the demoiselles. 1 hinted as much to Mr. Gervase, but he was incorrigible.' '??Mr. Gervase,' echoed Polly, under her breath. Her lover had kept his place at the tables_ and beside Lady Erne throughout the night, not staking himself, but watch ing the motley, unlovely crowd who did stake with keen eyes. He had walked back to the Pension Bannerman with the two ladies, and at parting had slipped a tiny note into Polly's hand, a note which she had deftly read and concealed as she followed Lady Erne's ornate person up the ' stairs. 'Mr. Gervase appreciates you im mensely, Aunt Theo. I am afraid other people as well as I observed that fact. Baron Kalikoska is looking green. As for John,' she rattled quickly qp, 'he turned traitor, went off to' dance attendance on Zillah Meyerbeer at the Alpenstock. Oh, I was nowhere.' 'You were too pale, under the gaslights deathly. I don't know much about such things — Lady Erne stated this with the euolzme detachment of a woman who has painted inch deep for twenty years — 'but I really think a touch, just a touch, of carmine might be jinrdonable. Try it for to-morrow's ball, immediately below the eyes, you know.' ' 'I know,' the girl assented, her thoudits intent on the scrap of paper— a leaf from Gervase's note-book— which lay hidden in her breast. 'When I was young I used to be ac cused by other women of artifice. That exquisite blush-rose shade of color. Mr. Gervase tells me I have it still. Why are your clever men such invariable beauty-worshippers?' Lady Erne seemed to apostrophise, her own image in the mirror rather, than her niece. 'You do think him clever, then— I mean Mr. Gervasse?' Polly lowered her ey.es^to hide the smile Which she felt must lurk there. 'John declines to commit himself on that subject.' 'Tbe monkey is jealous.' It was Lady Erne's habit to speak of her son as an infant. 'He holds Gervase your admirer, ' an opinion, my dear child, in which I do not agree. Mr. Gervase thinks you picturesque,- Polly, voila! He put the whole Morlaix scene before my eyes. The savage fisher people, the unkempt gipsy girl posing for artists on the sands, the tumbledown marior,-house, you poor, dear, dilapidated grandpapa. A scene worthy, he said, of Pierre Loti, the great French animal painter,' exclaimed Theo dosia, with 'her usual inaccuracy. 'All this is very different to admiration, re member.' i 'Veiy different,' echoed Miss- Erne, still with eyelids down bent. 'And the antipodes to love. When 1 was a girl, fifteen, eighteen years ago,' said Lady Erne, with the., precision of exact truth, 'we were content to charm. Our complexions were protected by blue gauze, our hands by gauntlets. We appeared' in the ballroom as lilies — English lilies. The breed of six-fopt giantesses, muscular, sun scorched women wearing pince-nez and men's shirt fronts, had not seen light.' .Polly could be grave no longer. 'Dear. Aunt Theo, I am five feet five in : my highest heels. My skin, with or with out blue gauze, is too dark to scorch. I am innocent of pince-nez, and I have never yet worn a man's shirt-front. Do not put/ the sins of' a whole backsliding generation' on my shoulders.' They were noble shoulders, although, of course, disfigured by the' excrescences of. fashion, and her head and heck— and, above all, the nape of Polly's neck— rwere -charming. She had thrown off her cjoak and cap. and, .bellows in hand, knelt i'clever ly Janning the wood fire ^iich later on ? should 'witness the1 mysteries of Theodosia Eleuais.

Positively, ihy dear child, you have acquired genre, distinct genre, by being ,so much 'in public, and with me. You are young, but, as John sayH, there is not the faintest taste of breadand butter.' ?'.? 'More golden opinions. Aunt Theo, you Bpoilme;' . Polly suspended the bellows on their nail; she rose to her feet a little testily. 'I am bowed down by the weight of all these gentlemen's flatteries. No taste of breadTand-butter— there John is right. I am old for niy years, small wonder. Lady Erne had by this time divested her self of many of her adornments, and a heap of suspiciously showy rings and bracelets lay on the table at her side. In removing her wraps the bloom of one cheek had become slightly casual. The equilibrium of her hair was imperfect. Polly, no moraliser ordinarily, had a mental shiver. She thought of the abom ination of desolation yet to come. During the earthquakes of eighty- sis Tbeodosia resided at Mentone. The girl had heard whispers, from persons remembering the scene, ol certain details. - A, flight out «f Egypt in one slipper and a counterpane. A wreck glared on by next morning's light sans eyebrow, sans wig, sans teeth, sans nearly everything. 'You look as though you saw a ghost. A penny for your thoughts. Searching me through with those great eyes of yours.' 'I was thinking,' said Polly, 'how most things change.' Experience had shown her the merit of veracity with a difference. 'You-are my friend, Aunt Theo. Life on the whole is diverting me. Now and again I hear a pretty speech or two. I am fond of pretty speeches — I am under 20\. Give the kaleidoscope a twist. Pass over a dozen years, let us say, what then?' 'My poor girl, that you will age early is certain. It is not your fault. Your mother, I have always heard,- looked old at 30. Heaven,' observed Lady Erne, 'turns out a limited number of Ninons in each half-century and then. breaks the mould. Which of the poets -wrote that line so very true to life, 'Then breaks the mould?' You will have lively manners always, and a figure, and among a class of elderly men, a figure goes far. You will I trust also have me. Do not think I am unmindful of your future; only to night, as we walked together in the gar den, I was speaking of it to Mr. Ger vase.' ' ; 'The honor is great. What has Mr. Gervase, a stranger,' cried. Polly hotly, 'to do with my future?' Her voice flut tered and broke. 'John in due time will marry. Boys must have their romance, you see, dream their dream. It keeps them steady. I have always considered John's fancy for you a wholesome influence, but it will pass. Already, you tell me, he is running after some tawdry Jewess. John will marry, I hope, well.' An odd pain contracted the girl's heart. She saw young Ingram's defects as through a microscope, and during the past fortnight iad resolved more frequently than ever' not to marry him. But she did not desire the lads' adyiiration to cool — at least, not yet. Giving nothing herself, she would fain keeft all. A sad enough weakness, unknown of course among young women of heroic mould. 'I am glad to have been wholesome. One does so little good in -this world. When John has a wife I may still be of use, perhaps-^as an antiseptic.' 'It is unlikely I shall live out of England for ever; sooner or later one will have to grow old.' Lady Erne smiled, playfully incredulous, as she made the concession. 'When that time comes, poor John a settled paterfamilias, I have a fancy that Bath would suit us, Polly. Mr. Gervase quite thinks so. Yes, we might take our final rest on Zion Hill. Mr. Gervase knows the place well.' 'Mr. Gervase seems interested in our affairs,' said Polly, very stiff and cold. ' You see, there are 'The Waters.' '? Waters, no matter what their components, had long been an integral part of Lady Erne's soap-bubble existence. 'And Pump room concerts— for England that is some thing. And generals— quite an army, 't would seem, of retired generals.' 'How charming, . Aunt Theo ! How kind of Mr. Gervase to put forward all these exquisite temptations !' Miss Erne was standing beside the hearth, her eyes intently fixed upon the sparkling wood flame, a blaze of color on her face. Alter a minute's silence, 'Let me ask John to be quick in his wooing,' added she hastily. V 'Let us fly to Zion Hill Life is uncertain. A pity to delay our chances with the generals.'. 'Polly, you are too frivolous ! - Our chances! As if living -man could make me change my state. Count Kalikoska! i. ou mention his name too often. I have been pursued for years— at 'times,' mur mured Theodosia Erne, pathetically ^'al most driven to surrender in despair' One wearies of the eternal 'No/ but I have stood firm. My idea of the relations be tween the sexes is lofty. I should hold a third marriage a desecration.' 'Then the general's are for -me,' cried Pplly, with scornful, emphasising lips— for me! When you and Mr. Gervase discuss the Bath scheme next perhaps you will omit one unimportant factor— my matrimonial hopes.' Lady Erne raised a pencilled eyebrow at her niece. 'Ten years, remember, a. -twist of 'the kaleidoscope. A girl of twenty-nine— — ' 'May be humbly 'content, to snare* a Bajjh general. Happily, there is a wedge,' - exclaimed Polly— a wedge of ten substan tial yeara— between how. and then, and, happily, 'should Count Kalikoska arid vou grow tired of me I could always findsneiter. amonR the artists; the. model ih'jne^'iio.t dead.' .

'The scantiest of: drapery— an absence even of drapery — would be modest if all the- world adopted it. Otherwise— no, I will not argue. I repeat my . question : What would a man of delicacy — such a man as Mr. Gervase — say to your talk?' . 'I should be curious to know. When next you and he cast my horoscope to gether, try him. Say to Mr. Gervase that Polly Erne inclines far more to artists' studios than to Bath generals. Good night, Aunt Theo.' CHAPTER VI. The clocks were striking 12 when young Ingram reached the second landing of the Pension Bannerman. In less palmy days the pension had con sisted of a single -chalet; it had now join ed hands with a neighbor on either side. Wooden ' galleries of communication branched forth on' every landing, and one of these galleries had to be traversed by John on his way to his apartment in the dependence. 1 he gas was turned down, the house silent — so silent that. the tread of _ the young man's dancing shoes produc ed' eerie fantastic creakings as he- groped along the passage, his hand on the wall, and guided only _by indistinct moonlight. 'John, how disappointing!' The ejacu lation was Polly's. Lured by the night's fairness, the girl had lingered to watch lake and mountains from the gallery; an arm resting upon the balustrade- she glanc ed back over her shoulder .into thevblack ness -of the house. 'I have wanted all my life to see a ghost, and you sounded like one.' - ' ? 'And am myself. Disappointing, com monplace as tisual.' 'Are you engaged? John Ingrain?' 'Not more than -usual, Miss Erne.' 'Then, if you donlt mind night- air, you may stop and talk to me. I should not think it right,' said Miss Erne austerely, 'to converse at this hour with an engaged man.' Her furred cloak was thrown carelessly across her shoulders. The mopnlight showed like a nimbus round her hair; it played faintly in her face. John advanced -within -a yard of where she stood, then stopped. He thought — the poor wretch's perennial thought — that she had never looked so dangerous be fore He groaned nver her Leauty in his heart. v 'Your notions of decorum are admirable. One likes a little novelty now and then. And so' — he looked round, as if mistrusting the empty gallery-^-'you are alone? Your charming evening has come to an end at last?' 'The charming evening struck me at the time as slow. Aunt Theo and Mr. Ger vase were engrossed in each other, or in the tables. You had deserted me — the universe ... my dear boy'— Polly in terrupted herself briskly— 'you have danc ed yourself into a fever. ' You are pome granate. Where is your overcoat?' 'Hanging up in the entrance-hall, of course. 'Then you must have this;' and, dis engaging a silken searf from her throat, she threw it lasso fashion over his, then knotted it there. 'No need to frown so ferociously — I insist. White becomes your complexion, John; you look almost pretty.' She wore roses at her breast, as I have . said, and her scarf smelt of them.. The perfume thrilled Ingram like a caress. Much though he albhorred fooling, he had it not in his Jienrt to repulse hei. For, in his masculine obtuseness, John bad not yet surprised the secret of those diurnal roses. 'If I had a bad time, John, your mother looked radiant. Mr. Gervase'— she felt herself drawn magnetically to the perilous theme— 'made progress, it is clear, in Aunt Theo's favor.'' 'My mother .has a strong affinity for the Barber's Block. And it *uits Mr. Gervase's . purpose,' said John, his face darkening- 'to pay her court. Mr. Gervase has had predecessors.' ? . 'And '-will have successors,' Polly ^ as sented carelessly. Then, with a swift modulation of key, 'Cousin John,' said she, 'the word 'successors' reminds me of a eliock I. have had to-night.' 'Tie that fellow Gervase?' - 'Re that fellow Ingram. We were; chatting before the fire— Aunt Theo . and' I — when all at once, 'John,' observed your mother, without a note of warning, 'will in due time marry.' 'It came in the midst of some' regrets for Mr. :Wat kine—no, some pleasing little speculations as to our probable future. Well, deiaf boy, and of course you' will marry, and 'of course I ought to say % will ' be fond ? of your wife. ' I did. not ie'el' fond of anyone at that moment.' . . ... ??.,''' John Ingram -was untouched by the hint. Against his will the girl's personal cha,rni: held him enthralled as ever. The moral hold was loosed, the time' for .pretty am biguities was over. Three weeks ago a suggestion of jealousy had . gone nigh ? to -intoxicating him. , ? ' . ??:;?. '.

Lifting it to the light, he examined its delicate, strong chiselling' with bitter ihtentriesV; . .; ? . ? ~- 'A hand like that— exonerate ? me of compliments— needs no. diamonds, real or paste.' The girl flashed up' at him eager eyes. 'Paste-^oli, . John, xan it be possible ? Your ring— our ring—' she was be ginning.' ? The lad put her hand away from him. with a certain cold tenderness she re membered long. Then /he took her .scarf from his throat; he hung it across the wooden rail at Polly's side. 'Our ring ! As thougii you and I could hold anything in common ! Let us at least talk sense. That ring of mine which ? you wore and lost lies on your conscience, does it not ?' She assented mutely. 'Poor lily-white conscience, why add to its burthens? Miss Erne, the. diamonds were paste. No, donV thank* me,' inter rupted .=John Ingram, 'don't make me a single .sugared speech. I promised to show you a .short-cut out of your trouble. Here it is.' ' You promised — under conditions,' stammered Polly, very low. 'I was to say — to say — — .' 'Never . mind what. Your head ached after I and my mother had left you last night; or was it your heart — I forget the letter of the legend? And you went down to the landing-slip, and as you stood there the ring fell from your band, sank into deep water. What more likely?' 'You are cruel when you are most gene rous.' Gervase was not by to counsel her. The betraying utterance broke from Polly Erne unawares. 'Generous! I generous! My dear Polly, let fiction go; truth is lovelieS1. That ring you lost (when you were not in the society of Mr. Gervase) was a gift sent me with my mamma's benediction. Did you know it?' Polly writhed under his words. Warped she might be by circumstances, but her nature was proud and loyal, and pride and loyalty lay in the dust, ground small be neath John Ingram's wheel. 'I think I remember, John. We were in Paris; it was a present for your birth day.' . '.And mamma probably was not in funds. Well, the ring, I will say, was a goodlook ing one. No better market for such wares than the Palais Royal. I felt filially grate ful. -'Wrote back my parent mamma a letter full of nineteen-year-old sentiment, and — . You are going away?' Miss Erne had turned. She was moving an irresolute step or two in the direction of the staircase. 'Not till I hear the story. It does not seem a very nice one.' 'The reverse of nice— &a; bit of life, my cousin, not of romance. Mamma sent her beloved son his birthday ring, and shortly afterwards the beloved son, having card debts to pay, took the gift to a pawn broker.' 'A pawnbroker — card debts. You!' Her vision of John, good old badtemper ed, ugly John, had been a vision alwajrs of virtue unassailable. At his confession she was breathless. .'The card debts of a greater idiot than myself. A fool face to face with the per dition he deserved. The fellow, a parson's son, had been good enough to ruin ? him self in my rooms. I had to 6ee the thing kept dark— above all, from my guardian.' And you paid the debts? John, it was fine.' ^ 'It was nothing of the kind; girls don't understand such things. I carried my ring to a scoundrelly Jew pawnbroker and was offered thirty shillings on it. This is as much of the transaction as concerns us. The diamond was paste, like the maternal benediction, the filial sentiment. Requies cat in pace,' observed John Ingram with emphasis. 'And may all falsehood coine to as appropriate an end! - Gqod night, Miss Erne. I leave you with an uhbuithen ed conscience, do I not?' He left her with an overburdened heart. Polly tripped off gaily to her attic room on the fourth floor. Did she not know that John Ingram was jealously watching her? Then,' when she had locked herself in and lighted the candle, and thrown down her cloak, she burst into a passion of humil iated tears. 'Paste, as the maternal care, as the filial sentiment had been.' :'Was not the whole world paste?, the whole slothful, easy, suffocating life she lived a falsehood?, It seemed as though - John Ingram's cynicism had swung wide the doors 'of her conscience, as though she were looking at herself from outside, scanning the dif ferent parts, she played, 'admiration and loathing of herself nicely mixed. After a long, reverie, 'Yes, I am like the heroine in a bad French novel,' the poop - child cried aloud through her tears. ?' She raised her hands towards lietr tear scalded lace, and the touch of roseV arrest- ed .tliem half way. Paste! Were riot ro.ses real — real as love, . real as the site or paper which lay hidden in her breast? Trembljng, she drew1 SJjvfGeryase's note forth; «he re-read it. A 'date only, two words, ian initial, the jecprd of some moment that had struck a new -wellspring in the memo jjes bt both. . . But clould ajlrihe literature of Europe ;have said more' to Polly Erne?
