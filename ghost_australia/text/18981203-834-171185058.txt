The Spirit of Gordon. ♦ Now ends the wrong that never shall be tight — Wrong part atoned, and Britain's bravest man Sees from far calm the work he well began Made sure ; the Mahdi's hosts are turned to flight ! Breaks the red dawn ! and fades the weary night 1 The sower dares to sow, the caravan Starts from Darfour and ancient Kurdofan, And Nilus fears no more the tyrant's might. Men say that night before Omdurman fell They saw throughout the camp a headless ghost And heard a voice, ' Nay, think not, friends, of me, For others, lo, I perished at my post ! Strike, strike, for others' freedom ! all is well !' And Britain struck,. and half a world is free. Canon Rawnilty In London Dalit/ Xews.
