N3W YiAR'S DAY SPORTI. i.e ernL of " counter attractions," such as the Bosing Day Races, the R.C. Freebytery Bazaar, and numerous picnics, the annual gathering on New Year's Day, under the auspices of the Yea Athletic Clnb, attracted a large crowd of visitors, all the outside districts being particularly well represented. lThe sports were good, all of the events were keenly competed for, and the spectators took a very lively interest in most of the contests. The hon. secretaries(Messrs. C. E. Carr and C. S. M'Kay) had, as usual, the lim's share of the work to do, but got a good deal of help from the president (Mr. D. K. Borrie);'and from Mesars. S. A. Wall, J. Barrettland M. Nathan (members of the committee). Mr. I. Corlas proved as efficient with the pistol as of yore, a six months' residence in the balmy air of Kor rumburra steadying his arm and nerves for the occasion. Mr. D. Ferguson. Mr., Dan M'Leish, jnn, and Mr. E. M'Cristal did most of the judgingin a very satisfactory manner, anudwere assisted at times by Musarc. N. D. Ferguson, T. J. M'Leish,andScale. Thetak ings at the gates amounted to £20, and after handing over £5 of it to the trustees towards payiog.offthicontof fencing and seats, the club will probably come out with a somall balanceo?u the right side, after paying the stakes and other expenses. Complaint was madle ,ofa number of conveyances standing on the outside of the ground, from which the dcoupanta obtained a good view of. the racing and juminV, w1elile 'a good m'.iy. sneaked in thrug an unlocked gate. ,ýd the committee wish it to be understood that it is the gate money on which they have to principally depend to pay the prizes, as the nominations and acceptances would not anything like cover the expenK- of the day.

Great interest was taken in these contests. but particularly so in the wrestling between Osihent Scale and David Borrie, their first. eicounter being declared a tie by the judges; and in the wrestling off Scale jumped from his pony and on to Borrie's horse, landing him on the ground. In the final he had to compete with Stuart Borrie, and tried the same tactics, but it was a case of David wrestling with Goliath, the younger Borrie, who shapes for being one of the mast.power ful men in the district, proving a much more formidable antagonist than bil eldest brother. 12\. MENAGERIE RACE (Boys)..-Prize, Ss. Entrance, ANil. J. Borrrie won with a young rooster. 0\. M'Intoeh and J.

BOYS' AND GIRLS' RACES. A number of boys' and girls' races were run for toys dluring the afternoon, and also for small money prizes contributed by Mr. E. S. Purcell and the committee. Needleas to say, the starter and the handicappers (Messur. P. Galvin, J. i'Cormick, and S. A. Wall) had a noisy and iniious multitude to deal with, nearly every boy and girl claiming a good handicap. These juvenile events proved tolerably exciting for the on-lookers as well as the young.competitors.
