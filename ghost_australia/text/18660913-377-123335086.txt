WEST MORETON ELECTION. There has been a great deal of fun over this event perhaps too much. Since the meeting at the School of Arts on Saturday evening, Mr. Goggs was con sidered fair game. It was concluded by all that he had no other object in seeking election than to get a railway carried to Brisbane, and this of course left him not the ghost of a chance of being returned to Parliament until Redbank is erected into a separate constituency. It had been arranged to meet Mr. Goggs on Tues day morning on Limestone Hill, and convey him tri umphlantly to the Court House; but, when lie ap peared, there were only three persons to greet him, a?d hby these he wars led by his horse's bridle down Biisbaoe-street, a bugler walking before and playing "Cheer, boys, cheer." By thie time the " procession" had reached East-street, a few more persoss had joined, cheers were given, and the member (thlat was to be) was followed by a considerable crowd to the Court House. Here lie was met by the Collector for the Hospital, to whom he handed a cheque for Â£25 for thle bellefit of that institution. He also hired a numbir of cabs for the purpose of bringing up the eletiors to vote ; these were nmade use of prnmineuously. The " csmmittee" silt at Tattersall's, and provisions, both liquid and solid, were freely supplied. Shorily after four o'clhck, the result of the polling in Ipswieh, as given below, transpired, and the Red bank esdidate collapsed. An attempt was made to persuade him that thie deficiency had been made up at otlher polliag-plnces, and tlhat, as hlie was sure of yo turn, he ouaght to allow himself to be chlaired throughl the town ; but Ihe declined the honour, and returned home a sadder and a wiser man. The result of the polling, so far as the returns laove yet been received, is as follows:- Fleming. Gogs.g Cockburn.
