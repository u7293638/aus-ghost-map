POST'S COXtV£B AND I could weep \ Th* Oneida chief His deacaat wildty tbue began; But that I may not stain with grief The death S^NG* of my /"other's SOD, Nor bovr this head to woe— For hy my hand, and by my wravli, To-ajnrrow A re ou ski's breath, Which fires tbe world with storms of death, Shall light us to the foe. And thou shalt share, my christian boy, The foeman's blood, the avenger's joy. Tomorrow Jet us do or die, But when the bolt of death is burled, Ah J whither then wjtb thee to fly? Shall OntaUassi roam tbe world, Sefk we thy once lor'd home! Tbe hand is gone that cropped its flowers. The clock unheard repeats its boura. Cold is the hearth within its bowers ; And should we thither roam— The hollow and tbe empty tread Would sound like voiccs from the dead. Or shall we cross yon mountains blue, Whose streams my kindred cation quaffed, And by my side, in battle true, A thousand warriors drew tbe shaft—- Oh! all is desolation there! The grass o'ergrowe each mouldering bone, Tbe desert Berpent dwells alone, And e'en the stones,to ruin grown, Like me, ore death like-old,— Then seek we not their camp, for there The silence dwells of my despair* But hark ? the trump 1 to- morrow thou In glory's fires shall bathe thine eyes j See, from the land of spirits now, My father's nwful ghost arise Wbeje ereaing's repours roll- Shrouding the cruel and the cunt He bids me dry the last, the first, The only tears, that ever burst From Ontallasi's soul— For, that I may not stein with grief, The death song of an Indian Chief.—Campbells
