Thc Queensland Cup Handicap. TO THE EDITOR OP THE BMSDANK COURIER. Sir,?As your columns appear to bo very much open to correspondence on this subject, and aa my name has been dragged (I don't know why) into it, perhaps you will lot me say a few Words in reply. Tho " Admiral's Ghost" (save tho mark !) says I am abroad in my judgment of Safeguard, Prineo Ghnrlio, and Bronzewing. I think not. But oven if I wore, I have known the leading turf writers of Australia, such as " Augur," " Beacon," " Pegasus," " Nemo," kc, to bo vory much mistaken in their pro-estimate of horses that they Bee, or can soe, evory day. So, if I should do tho same by horses that I never have seen, it would be a less wonder. But then, Sir, it is tho legitimate business of professional turf writers to express opinions? astutely or not, as may be, but in all cases honestly ?on public racehorses. But anonymous out- siders, like tho " GhoBt," are oiit of place when they air their ideas in print, I havo always expressed my candid' opinion, and never played into tho hands of any bookmaker or particular stablo, nor have I written np or favored any section of tho racing community at thc expenao of another ono. Heuco I am not popular with sportsmen of tho " Ghost" class, nor havo I any wish to ho so. Their good opinion is not by a very long chalk tho diploma which I am hero to study for. In conclusion, Sir, tho end will provo tho Boundnoss, or othorwiso, of tho Q.T.C. handi- capping and general management. Qui vivra -Yours, &c;, a VRNTSON. AP P.S.?Admiral Rous was a correct and prcciso man. His " OhoHt" is very "mixed" indeed when he spoaks of tho " Queensland Cup Handi- cap" ns the " Queensland Turf Club Handicap" (soe his lotter), a horse of another color alto- gether; but theso great critics always aro tho greatest muddlers of all. It needs no tolling.
