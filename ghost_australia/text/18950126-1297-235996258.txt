SPOOK PERFORMANCE. On Wednesday evening; last a large num ber of friends assembled at Deltamu, the resldenco of Mr. David M. Myers, of Rand- wick, to witness a cabinet seance. The "medium" was .Master John Slmmonds, of Randwick, who, although only a lad of about 1G years, displayed skill In a ropro- duction of our old spectral acquaintances, "Gcordie," "Clssie," and "Josephine." The guests assembled In the large drawing- room, one end of which was reserved for the cabinet, a mere skeleton lathe frame work, with a curtain of common black sl- lesia, ami standing quite away from all doors and on the carpeted floor. The same tests were adopted as those applied to the clever performance of Mr. Iloskings at the Opera House, the "medium" changing his clothes under supervision of a committee to secure the proof of the absence of any white material about his person. lie was tied inside a black silosia bag. and a non- clastic tape fastened round his neck and knotted, anil the knots sealed, with a short loose end passed through a hole in the framework of the cabinet and knotted and sealed on the other side. A shrewd com mittee examined and assisted at the whole process. Within a few minutes of tlio lowering of the lights "astral" forms cloth ed in gloaming while drapery moved ghost- fully about the room to within a few yards of the spectators and shook hands with several of them. The bearded "Geordle" was strongly in evidence. No assistant or confederate was allowed near the cabinet oxcepl the promiscously-fonned committee. Shortly after tlio forms dematorlalised the lights were turned up, and the committee drew the curtains, discovering Master Slm monds sitting in the cabinet In his black bag tied as previously, and with seals in tact. The audience were fairly mystified, and warmly applauded the extremely clever illusion. Master Simmonds slates that he can repeat the performance with his hands tied In any manner that may be suggested.
