The second handicap race for the Markwell Cup between boats connected with the Brisbane Sailing Club took place on Saturday afternoon, the course being from the Hamilton to King Island The conditions imposed on competitors for this trophy are that if has to be sailed for three times, and the boat becoming the largest number of points was in the cup The first boat in each race scores two points, the second two, and the third one In the first race the Hinemoa was just, the Lassie second, and the Harriette Ann third The result of Saturday's races was that the Lassie won, while the Hinemoa was second, and the Labour third, thus giving the Lassie and Home a an equal num- bar of points to their credit The arrangements for Saturday) 's lace worn that it the wind was from the north east the course was to be round the Pile Lighthouse and outside St Helena and (given Islands to King Island if south-east, to the Beat Ptsjage to King Island Shortly before the start the wind was from the east, but it shortly) afterwards veered round to the south east, and was found to be a true south - caster outside, and blowing mee and fresh The order was given by the starter (Mr C B Lilley ) to take the Boat Passage course The start was a flying one, the signal being the hoisting of a flag at the boat club's shed five minutes before the start, and the lowering of it at the appointed time for starting (2 30 p in ). This air argument proved far less satisfactory than the firing of two guns at the times stated, with the hoisting of a preliminary flog a quarter of an hour before start, would have bean Most of the skippers of the competing boats were either too careless or too busily engaged to notice the hoisting of the flag, and with some of them it was hoisted and lowered again before they had seen it The result was an unsatisfactory start, but it was not the fault of the starter The boats competing were the Harriette Ann, 30ft, Mr C Palmer, series h the Hinemoa, 28ft , Mr Wetherill, 15min the Lassie, 2iffc,Mr R H Lawson, 15min, Fiona, 22ft, Mr Hains, 18min Sabrina, 20ft , Mr J Tolson, 20min and the Police, Mr A Edgar, Kimin The J apina, 10min and the Spray, 2min , did not start The Ladies s crew being the most vigilant in looking out for the starting flag, which was lowered punctually to time, got about two minutes' start of the other boats The Hinemoa and Sautelle Ann got away on pretty even terms, but the latter lost some time in picking up a late member of her crew after the start The smaller try also got a ay pretty nearly at the same time, but the Fiona, being badly handled, was soon out of it. The Lassie, if Anything, increased her lead down the liver, and nothing ever got near her The Hinemoa, sailing remarkably well, was chased down the Hamilton and Lytton Re notes by the Iliirnotto Ann, the latter off the Powder Magazine setting a 1 u ge topsail, which, however, as the wind was then east, did not no good She got nearly even with the Hinemoa off Lytton, but as it was then low tide and she had not the ghost of a chance of getting through the Boat Passage, sho^quaiedawayioi Bnbioona plonsuiouuise The other boats had then struggled out a good way astern No material alteration took place in the stiff seashore to King Island against a south-easter, and the order of finishing was, according to official time - Lassie, 5 28 pm , Hinemoa, s ou Sabrina, 5 52 Pelican, 6 2 , Piono, 0 1 The actual difference between the Lassie and Hinemoa at the finish was about eleven minutes, as, owing to the umpire's boat not having an lived, the for man's lime was taken when she brought up, while the Hmo men's time was taken from ft line considerably more to windward Mr W C Hume acted as umpire The Locos, had been announced as the flagboat, but Mr Hume after ty yards determined to sail down in his own yacht (the Perry, and she was substituted for Mr Marks ell's yacht The For a was a little late in arriving at her post, as she met with a slight mishap in beating down the mci There were about twenty pleasure boats at King Island and Wellington Point on Saturday night, nearly all of them being out for three days' cruise
