Botany Ba(i)ted. A BOTANICAL fete in London, with its aristocratic refinement, Jl\ would hardly be more astounding to the ghost of King W? Kacombau. than the "Bank" entertainment, "whereon the JLJh wierd time blows" on that day of healthful recreation, which a few of the most benighted communities in Christendom, hold in such solemn dread, would have opened the optics of the adventu- rous Captain Cook and the pioneers ot mercirui uarnnguurst. we uo not say that last Sunday's show was the climax of High Art, for we have before stated that Mr. W. E. Sheridans' forte is not the melo dramatic. But we have heard a clever mimic hold an appreciative audience spell-bound while reciting with the respective mannerisms of Kean, Phelps, Feebler, Irving, Toole, Buckstone, and a host of other brethren of the buskin, the immortal tragic lines : â€” "There was an old woman, her living. she got By selling Codlings, Hot, Hot, Hot ; And this little old woman she thought it no sin To take a little drop of gin." But " The Charge of the Light Brigade " is such a stirring piece of work, and the less hackneyed Little Hero" is so intensely pathetic, that he who can make no effect with them must be either a Sunday School teacher or a Blue Ribbon man. In the sententious Jacques' opinion of the world, however, the great Shakesporiau actor was in his true element, and conclusively proved to Mr. Frank Smith's visitors that New South Wales had now reached the " last scene of all, and was literally on the sobbeth." " Sans nobblers, wine, beer, schnapps, sans everything." Miss Louise Davenport was "Not Guilty" of spoiling her work. Quite the reverse, it was very fine. Well clone, Frank ! Keep the game alive. The Presbytery of Melbourne seems to ignore the old Christian maxim of "if you fire stronn be merciful," as in their late delibera tions (with closed doors) they were certainly most unmerciful on the Rev. Mr. Strong.
