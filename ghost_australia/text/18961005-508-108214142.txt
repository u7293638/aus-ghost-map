I Let them remember the cij?cumstiinces' of the I story as I have related them, iet^Jjem think I of how much depended on 'my .'discovery of I Kaffar, let them also try to fanbyspmething I of my fe.eh*ng6, and fh_en t^ey will' be Able to I piess at my weary nighjts and anxious days, I they will knpw how feyeri^ily I hurried from I port. to port and from, town to town. Any-: I bow, I will, not try . to describe them, for I I eliouJd-miserably fail. I Cairo was comparatively empty. The heat I had driven l^e tourists away to colder climes. I The waiters in the hotels lolled around, with I little or nothing to do. Only a few guests I required their attendance. Everything was I very qaiet. TMie burning sun fairly scorched ; I the leaves of the acacia trees, which grew i I everywhere. The Nile was exceedingly low, j I and water was comparatively scarce. The I older part Of Cairo was simply unbearable; I the little Coptic community dwelling- in the I low huts, which reeked- with dirt and vermin. I would, one would have thought, have been I glad to have died. I I had no success in Cairo. A dozen times I I was buoyed -up, a dozen times my hopes I were destroyed, leaving me more despairing I than ever. In spite of the terrible heat, all I that -eould be done I did. Heccjmmegded by I au MteJ proprietor,. I eng^ged'JtwO/Of the ( I shrewdest mien in this wonderful city to try j I iiud find Kaffar, but they could discover no i I trace of him. I went to mosques, to temples, j I to bazaars— in vain. If he were in 'Cairo, he | I 'was hiding. - . I Oh, the weary work, the dreadful uncertain I ty! Hoping, despairing, ever toiling, ever I searching, yet never achieving! The months I were slipping by. . It was now August, and I I was no nearer finding him than when I I .started. Must I give up,. then? Should I I renounce my.Jife's love? Should I yield my I darling to Volta-ire? Never! I I formed a. new resolution. I would go I back to England. Doubtless I had gone I clumsily to work, and thus my failure would I be explained. When once baek in London, I I would engage the cleverest detectives the city I could boast of, and I would state the whole I case to them. Perchance they could do what I I had failed to accomplish. This determina I tion I at once carried into practice, and in a I little more than a week I again saw the white I cliffs of Dover. I did not rest Arriving at I Victoria, I drove straight to Scotland Yard, I aiid in an hour later two of the most highly I recommended officers of the London detective I police were in possession of all the facts that I I could give them that would lead to the dis I covery of the Egyptian, providing he lived. I ? Then I drove back to my rooms in Gcwer I street, weary and sad, . yet not hopeless. I There were four months in which to act I Two clever men were at work, while, thank I God. I was free to act and to think. I Yet the future looked terribly, doubtful. I Would the inquiries be successful? Would I Gertrude be freed from Voltaire? And should I I be happy? I CHAPTER XVTI. I Two months passed, aid no tidings of I Kaffar— at least, none that was worthy of I consideration. The detectives had done all I that men could do; they had made every in ? quiry possible, they had set on foot dozens of ? schemes; but all in vain. Voltaire, who had ? been closely watched? was apparently living I a quiet harmless life, and was not, so far as I could be seen, in communication with him. I I had done all that I could do myself. I had I followed in England every possible clue, all I of which had ended in failure. Three months passed. Still no reliable news. One detective fancied he had detect ed him in Constantinople; another was equal ly certain he had, at the same time, seen him in Berlin. I became almost mad with de epair. The first, of December had come, and I was not a step nearer finding the man whose presence would free me from Voltaire's villainous charge. That which troubled me most was the fact that I did not know whether he was alive. Even if I did not kill him, perhaps Voltaire had got him out of the way so that he might fasten the guilt on me. 'What, after all,' was the thought that maddened me, 'if he should be lying at the bottom of Drearwater Pond?' There were only twenty-four days now. Three weeks and three days, and I knew not what to do. If I failed, my love would marry the man who was worse than a fiend, while I, for whom she was suffering this torture, I was unable to help her. j And yet I had tried; God alone knows how; I but only to fail. Still, there were twenty I four days; but what were they? Kaffar, if I he were alive, might be in Africa, Australia I —no one knew where^ I saw no hope. I A week more slipped by. There were only I seventeen days left now. I was sitting in I ay room, anxiously, waiting for the Contmen I tal mail, and any telegrams which might ar rive. I heard i;he postman's knock, and in a minute more letters. were brought in. Eagerly I opened those which came from the detec tives, and feverishly read them. '''Still in the dark; nothing discovered'— that summed up | the long, reports they. «ent me. I read the other letters; there was nothing in them to help me. .. \ ?.;..' Sill another week went by. Only ten days we^e wanting to Christmas Eve, and I knew no more of Kaffar's whereabouts than I did on the day- when I defied' Voltaire and started on my search. .Again reports from the detec tives came; and still no news. No doubt by this time, Voltaire was gloating over his vic tory, while I was nearly mad with despair. Only ten days! I must do something. ? It was my 4aty,-at all- hazards,-:to free €5ertrude Forrest from. Voltaire. -That waB plain. I could not; find the-Bgypiian, and thus it was probable I had killed him as had been said. What must I do? This, and this only. I must go to Scotland Yard, and relate to the authorities my whole story. I must tell them of Voltaire's influence, over me, and that it , wasrprobableJI|&ad;,.wliile.heId' under a mes merist's spell, Idlled the man! had been trying to find.

I paid the cabman, an4 knocked at the door wife a -beaming heart- ???- A «aupw-fiaced gM 'opened &$ door, an4 asked my business, : Was Professor Virchqw at home? Yes, he was at home, but would be engaged for the next quarter q£ an hour; after tfeat, he could see me on business connected with his profession. . I was accordingly ushered into $. mosty room, which sadly wanted light and air. The quarter of an hour dragged slowly away, ?when the sallow-faced girl again appeared, saying that Professor Von Yischow would be pleased to see me. He; was a little man, about five feet four inches high. He had, however, a big head, a prominent forehead, and keen grey eyes. He wore gold-rimmed spectacles, and was evir dently well-fed and on good terms with him self. '? ?-.?-?? 'You are a professor of- mesmerism and clairvoyance, I believe?' I began. 'That is my profession,' said the little man, stiffly. 'Then I am in hopes that you may be able to help me hi my difficulty.' . ? 'I shall be pleased to help yon,' he said, still stiffly. . 'Can you,' I went on, 'tell the whereabouts of a man whom I may describe to you?' 'That is very vague,' was the reply. JIYour description may be incorrect, or a hundred men might answer to it I would promise nothing under such conditions.',' 'Perhaps I had better tell my story,' I said. 'I think you had,' said the little professor, quietly. . . . 'On the second of January of the present year,' I said,, 'a .man disappeared in the night from a place in Yorkshire. He is an Egyptian, and easily distinguished. . A great deal jiepends on finding him at once. Ever since May, ? endeavors ? have ? been made to track him, but without success.' 'Perhaps he is dead,' said the professor. 'Perhaps so; but even then it is important to know.# Can you help me to find put his whereabouts?' . 'Undoubtedly I can; but I must have, a good photograph of him. Have you one?' 'I have not' -. ...... 'Could you obtain one?' 'I think not.' 'But this man has been seen by many peo ple. Could not some one you know, and who knows him, sketch a faithful likeness from memory?' 'I do not know of'any one.' 'Then I could not guarantee to find him. You see, I cannot work miracles. . I can only work through certain laws which I have been fortunate enough either to recognise or dis cover; but there must ever be some data up on which to go, and, you see, you give me none that is in the least satisfactory.' 'Perhaps you' can,5' I said, 'if I relate to you all the circumstances connected with what is, I think, a somewhat remarkable Story.' I had- determined to tell this little man every circumstance which might lead to Kaf far's discovery, especially thcsa which hap pened in Yorkshire. It seemed . my only re source, and I .felt that somehow something would come of it I therefore briefly related what I have written in this etory. 'That man' who mesmerised you is very clever,' said the professor, quietly, when I had finished. 'It was very unfortunate fot you that you should have matched yourself with such a one. His plot was well worked out in every respect He. only made a mis take in one thing.' 'And that?' ^ 'He thought it impossible that you should ever be freed from his power without his consent Still it was a well-planned affair. The story, the ghost, the quarrel— it was all well done.' . 'I fail to see what part the ghost had in the matter,' I said. The professor emiled. 'No?' he eaid. **Well, I should not think it was a vital part of his plan, but it was helpful. He calcula ted upon the young lady's superstitious fan cies. He knew what the particular form in which the .ghost appeared portended, and it fitted in with his scheme of murder. Evi dently he wanted the young lady 'to believe in your guilt, and thus give him greater chance of success. * Ah, he is a clever man.' 'But,' I 'asked anxiously, 'can you tell me Kaffar's whereabouts now?' 'No, I cannot— that is, not to-day.' . 'When, then?' 'I may not be able to do so at all. It all depends on one man.' 'Wiho is he?' 'Simon Slowden, I think you called him.' _ 'Simon' Slowden! How can he help us?' 'Evidently he is susceptible to mesmeric influences, and he knows the man you wish to find. But the difficulty lies here. Is he sufficiently susceptible?' 'Is; that the only hope?' 'All I can see at present I was going to suggest that you be thrown mto a ?mesmeric sleep; but you could hot be depended on. The experiences which yon have had would make you very uncertain.' ? 'Then your advice is — — ' ' 'Send for this man at once. If he fails— welt I have anptiigr alternative.' ^'^May I know- what?' 'No, not.^now.' -^'Answer me this. Do you th*'fr I killed Kaffar, the Egyptian?' 'No, I do not; but your enemy intended you should.' 'Why did I not, then?' 'Because the Egyptian also possessed a mesmerist's power, and hindered you. At any rate, such is my opinion. I am! not sure;' and. the little .man looked very .wise. 'Expect us early to-morrow morning,' I said, and then wejit away to the nearest, tele graph office, with a lighter heart than I had known for many long months. ' The little professor had given me some hope. The matter was still enshrouded in mystery, but still I thought I had found a possible solu tion. . . - .. . ? i- i :. ' ?? . '?? '??

I was nothing loth, and so, although it was still early, we were soon in a cab on our way to the professor's. On arriving, we were im mediately shown in, and the little man soon made his appearance. 'Ah! you've brought him?' said he. 'I'm glad to see you so prompt Would you mind taking this chair, my friend?', to Simon. That s it, thank you. You've been travel hTQS allnigbt and are a little tired, 1 expect. No? Well, it'js well to be strong and- able to bear fatigue. There, look at me. Ah, that's With that he put his fingers on Simon's forehead, and iny humble friend was uncon scious of what was going on around him. ? Hes very susceptible; but I'm afraid he has, not been under this influence a sufficient number of times for his vision to be clear. Still, we'll try. Simon!' 'That's me,' said Simon, sleepily. Do you see Kaffar, the Egyptian?' He looked around as if in doubt His eyes had a vacant look about them, and yet there seemed a certain amount of intelligence dis played—at any rate, it seemed so to me. 'I see lots of people, all dim like,' said Si mon, slowly; 'but I can't tell no faces. They allseem to be covered wi' a kind o' mist.' 'Look again,' said the professor. 'Yon can see more% clearly now.' . - ? (To be continued.)
