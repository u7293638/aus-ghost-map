A Curious Custom. IN the courts of Venice, when a prisoner is about to be sentenced to death, a tall, ghostly louking party, dressed in a long black gown, stalks mjestically to the centre of the chamber, bows solemnly to the juige, and in the sepulchral tone adopted by the ghost in Hamlet says, "lResember the baker." Then he bows again, forms h:mse?lf into a hollow square, and strides out with the proud air ot a man who has given the Bench something to think about for the next fifty years. To a stranger this proceeding suggests that the court is having a little " wholesome fun," as Chief Justice Darley would say, at the expense of the party rehind" the spikes, but everything connected with the affair is profoundly serious, and the custom arose from the fact that some three centuries ago a baker was executed in Venice. for a crlme of which it was afterwards proved he was wholly innocent. The judge who con demned the unlucky dough-banger was then ordered to provide funds for the setting up and perpetual burning of a lamp known as the " lamp of expiatron" In the palace of the Doges, arid the offictal ceremony just de scribed was instituted by way of imnpressing on all future judges the necessity for using the greatest caution in cases where a ciiizen's life is at stake. There is a lesson in this that we might very well take to ourselves to day.
