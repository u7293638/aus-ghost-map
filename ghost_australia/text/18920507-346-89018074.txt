TDK GIlUST OF CHiTElD SAiNT-CKUV. _ An American newspaper gives the transla tion of iali unfinished story of M. Guy de Maupassant's under the abovo title, written presumably just before his mental affliction. The story is told by an old marquis at mid night to two friends:— ■ .It ,\yasr"in 1827i iti,lh'e mojibhiof Jiily^ and my regiment was stationed at Rouen. 'One day, while out for a walk on the quay* I met a man whose face was familiar to me, and yet. I .could, not. exactly'. place ;him.

'It is hardly necessary for .no to loll yon,' ,he;addod,. 'that youIniiust not examine these papers even superficially.' These wofda uftended: 1neVarid';rhiiido a. motion to turn away, but Saint-Gcry laid his •eaprtftous palm on'my shoulder arid mattered out, ' Pardon me, I didn't know what I was saying—my mind'.was -wandering—li'trrustj. you implicitly.' .j ;[Tlpc.-narrator: .finally accepts the commis sion, and rides to tti'e Ohat-eau^Saint-Gery by moonlight 'Uu'uugh the woods.

You feel your soul slipping away like escaping vapor J your heart comes to-adead standstill jyollf whole, bod}- grows inert and limp and like an empty tenement.

I knew, liko all the,rest of you, that the dead .never.,como .from thair graces to walk the cold,'damp earth again; but yet this senseless fear of them came upon me, nevertheless. < .This' fairapparition-", hjdeous to liio', and in those few instants I stillered more of irresistible agony, liioro of awful dread of. tliOj supernatural than; in my whole life-puftogether*. . ' ' The apparition spoke.

I tried to say ' Yes,' but I nothing save a low, hissing sound escaped me.-."'.'Twits all I •was capablo of, and bo I bowed my head in sign of acquiescence. With this sho drew from under the folds' of her white gown a large-toothed tortoise-shell comb, and, hold ing it out to, me, whispered : ' Comb my hair, .oh, comb my hair ! It will cure' me, it will stop this pain ; it's the only; way. -Look at my head. See how I*am suffering; it-will drag me down to death !' ' 11 ' As she sat thero her wonderful head of hair fell around her like an,enveloping cloud, its edges resting upon the floor. : Why did I attempt to obey 1 Why did I reach out n ! tremulous hand for that comb, arid why did I take hold of those thick strands of hair, tho touch of which sent shivers of . intense cold ness through my hands and arms as if I were toying with, strings of serpents ? I cannot tell you, my friends, but believe me when T say that that sensation of cold ;s here yet and that I can feel it now. A horrible fascin ation: came upon me as I set to work. Cold and-heat by turns struck mo deep in the very vitals. I was caressing the dead, toying with liair cold and dank from the tomb. Oh, it was dreadful and yet it was heavenly ! Gradually my strength came to me. I was an adept ,iti the use of a comb, far almost . daily I w;is wont to comb and braid my horse's mane. ] couldn^t seo whether an expression of comfort had stolon over, that white face, but I could hear.that low breath ing, that softened groan which means relief from pain, as I proceeded with iny work.. Fepirating that luxuriant growth into several . parts, I took up each in turn and combed it to its full length. Then gathoring their, all together,.I began to braid them.'and as, .my .lingers lost niord and more the stifiVess which fear had caused, I went* faster to the end. Sho bowed her.head and continued to give forth those softened groans • which '-'seemed almost liko . the purring of a cat. Suddenly she murmured a word of thanks, • and reaching out quickly took the ; comb from my hand and darted out of the Mom,disappearing in the darkness of ilie hjilf opaned door, more like a spectro than over. The moment I found myself alone there came upon mo that dazed feeling so common to anyone escaping from the chains of 80'mc dreadful nightmare.
