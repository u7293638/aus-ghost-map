VANISHED HOURS. 'Where are they {rone,.those dear dead days. Those sweet past days of long ago, Whose ghosts go floating to and fro When evening leads us through her maze ? Where are they gone ? Ah.! who can tell ? Who weave once more that long-passed spell. They did exist when we vrere young, We met our life with strength and trust, We deemed all things were pure and just, Nor knew life had a double tongue, We lightly sang a happy song. Nor dreamed our way could e're be wrong. And then all changed; as life went by, The friend deceived, or bitter death Smiled as she drank our dear one's breath, And would not let us also die. Day followed day ; as on they went Kach tool; some gift that life had sent. T et, it was. nurs. that eerfoet past 1 We diil hive days that knew not pain, We once had friends death had not ta'en, And f'owurs and songs tint could not last Were oars in that most blessed time. When earth seemed Heaven's enchanted clime. And so 3 think, when lights burn low, A ml rdi the house is fast a-loep. From out a silence vast and deep Those (heir dead days we worshipped so, breathe on us from their bidden store Their long-lost peace, their faith once more. God keep those good old times; ah me! Beyond our vision tiiey may rest Till on some perfect day and blest (luce iiwrc those, dear dead days will be, For death, who took all, may restore The past wc loved, to ua once more.
