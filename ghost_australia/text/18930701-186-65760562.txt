(tinidrm's -f otumu. IN THE LOWER' BUBEAU DRAWER. (Harper** Young People.) iCHdudcd.) Though Mr. Gny bad promised to dispose of the skulls, it was no easy matter in a strange city, whose customs and laucoage be was entirely unfamiliar with. He took a cigar and went out into tbc street, the Calle Ran Francisco- His walk was interrupted by a young man who put ont bi& hand saying : — 'Good eveninc, Mr. Gray. This is a great time yon Americans have been making over at the Itarlude. I bope yon are not one of the eknll-stealcrs.' '* Why, Jose Molina V Mr. Gray exclaimed warmly grasping tie preferred band. *' I beard you were in the city, but I have uot been able to look yon up as you know I do not go to tbc theatre, I hear yon hare become a great actor.' ** Hardly so mnch as that,** the young man laughed; 'bat tilings have changed a little with me since I was one of your office boys in New York. 1 tell them 1 am not an actor at all, but a trickster, au acrobat, a ventrilo quist. But they seem to like me, and it pays. Tell me bow you happen to be in Mexico. It it natural enough for me to be here, for I ant a strolling player, and kuow Mexico as well as X know New York. Yon know I nut a native of Rio Janeiro, and this American company picked me up there, and we arc working our way slowly towards Kew York. Bat yon ?' 'I am merely making a short visit here with a party of American tourists,' Mr. Gray replied. ' And they have, as you say, been doing foolish things with the skulls. Bythe way, Jose M.olica, yon say you are acquainted with Mexico ; then you are just the mas to give me some assistance. If I should tell yon tli&t; a particular friend of mine has two of those skulls in his possession, and that we are at a loss to know haw to dispose of them, could you help us T ** Decidedly !** the young man excLinied. *' Help you? 1*11 do much more than that to oblige Mr. Gray. I'll take them away myself. It's perfectly easy. Where is your friend ?- 'He is at the Iturbide Hotel,' Mr. tiray answered. 'He is only a boy, who has thoughtlessly done this foolish thing. Do I si»y that be has done it ? I mean to say that the two— the two objects are in his room, and that who put them there remains to be seen. But they must be taken away.' ' I Bee, I Bee !*' the young man laughed again. ?'? They shall disappear to-night. And how I slmll enjoy a little lark like this ! I've not liad one of my frolics since 1 cairn: to Mexico. A boy, you say: Then here's a bargain :— The two objects shall disappear to nightimmediately after the performance, which will end shorUv before midnight. A boy? Ha : ha ! You know I have turned ventrilo quist, Mr. Gray, and 111 give this graverob biuglmy just a little bit of a fright. But mean while you are to mention this to nobody, not even to the boy. When the sun rises the objects are gone. I do uot care to kuow the boy's name. If you agree, 1 ueed only the number of his room and the loca'iou of I lie objects.' 'But liow is it possible, Jose, tor you to ** II is the easiest thing in the world/1 Jote replied, ' if you leave it lo inc. It is a bar ' You were always wortiiy of trust, Jose, and I trust you now.' Mr, Gray replied, taking his hand again. ' But you must not frighten the boy too badly. The number of his room is 88, and the objects are in the lower drawer of his bureau.' As Jose Molina stepped gayly off Lo the theatre be might easily have been mistaken n for a Mexican, with bis shortstature, bis rich brown complexion and bis velvety eyes and. straight black hair. Thus it happened tJialu little before 12 that night a peon boy, in bare feet, batless, trousers rolled np to his knees, shirt open at the throat, carrying a covered basket on his head, and with a porter's badge carefully made of tinfoil hung from his neck by a leather thong, entered the Iturbide Hotel, his badge taking him past the watchman withedt ^nes- ' tion. ~ Midnight would be a late hour lor delivering bundles in other conntries, bat it is early enough to excite Do couune&t-; in a Mexican hotel. Tap ! tap ! tap ! at the door of No. 88. '? VVbo U it r asked Harry Npanlding trom within, starting nervously from the unea£V sleep into which he had fallen. : 41 A friend,' responded the peon boy in a low voice. 'A friend from Mr. Gray. Be ooick 1' The mention of &lr.; Gra) 's name disarmed Harry's fear's and he unbolted the door. Ihe peon instantly pushed faiB way into tbe room, set down his basket, and bolted the door ' You have my grandfather's slmll here,' said he in the most matter-of-fact my. ' I - want it, please.' 'Yon— did— you— say— you — ' Hurry gasped, leaning against the bed and boMing to tbe post by one band, all the colour gone from ' his 'face in an instant. ' Don't keep me waiting, please,' said tbc - peon boy. *' I have brought a basket for l-id ever a messenger go about an errand with such fatal coolness? His grandfather's skull, please; and he had brongbt a basket' for it . ! . . Harry seized tbe bedpost now with both hands, 'and a cold perspiration moistened his 'I— I — I know n-n-nothing about your gr — ' be stammered. Bnt before he could finish the sentence' there came a sepulchral voice from -the bureau : ' I'm in tbe lower bureau drawer, Jose : Harry shook like a leaf. His knees refusal to support him, and he sank upon the bed, his teeth shattering. Had an ordinary conven tional white ghost appeared in the night be would most likely have laughed and thrown the pitcher at it, for he was not in the least superstitious. Bat a common street boy, a young Aztec Indian boy, coming to his room at midnight, and coolly demanding his grand father's sknll, was too mnchf orhisoverstauuned nerves, and his tnnsclfis gave way. Joec paid no attention to tbe frightened boy, but stepped quietly to the bureau mail opened the drawer. Then he took np one of tbe BknUs, held it in bis arms, patted its smooth crown, and stroked it as one might stroke the curly head of his child. After a moment of this be picked op the basket and began making a nest in the loose straw with which it was filled. Then the skoll spoke again. 'There's another one there !' ' All right, grandpop,' said Jose with the utmost coolness, as he took a handercbief from bis pocket, wrapped it round die skoll, and laid it carefully in tbe basket. Having deposited tbe basket again upon the floor, Jose returned to tbe bureau and lifted out the other sknlL The instant he looked at it he bad every appearance of being nearly as much frightened as Bury. He set it down upon the bureau as quickly as though it imi been red hot, and cried ont as loudly ms Me thought he could cry with safety. '1 ben he sprang lo Harry's side and shook him. ! ' Boy, boy, what have you done? Fly, Up for your life before it is too late. Yonder Iks tbe skull of Monlcmma, the beloved father of 'ThTsnaking of this latest flight bioigfat Harry partially to his senses: He was about to Epeak, wben the words were taken -ant at his month by-thtLtkulllitontbe bureau, which hoarsely JBtt&oud; :^— ' ' Water ! VCater-: As you hope for mercy. give me water '.^ ? This was too much apparently for the BtoicalJose. He sprang from Barry's ride, snatched np his basket, and inurbutant was unbolting the door as if to escape. . The horror of the situation gave Barry new strength, and he boon Jed to' 4t£ door and seized Jose by the arm. ' Do )soti,leave me with that — that — gentleman on th» Amrean !' he begged. 'I did not niean lo do yon any harm. I didn't know the ? Jrtherjgeutlenian was your grandfather. Upon iny word I didn't. Please don't leave me alone with that skull that talks.' Then a fcright idea struck him. '* Take him, too** he^added. ' Boy,*' Jose responded, in 'oBol, but thoughtful tones, ' you know oeVwhat yoo ask. And yet— and yet '— hel&iidfS;— ' if one of us must die, why Batlfvidtet him live who lias every thin-rln* liwfer* Rut my aged father ? f am his solejoKiort. If 1 make the sacrifice, I leave tbe aged one penni less ' . — ' No. no 'r Harry exclaimed, snatching bis purse from tlie washstand, where be bad laid il. ' Here is gold; take all I have.' If any thing happens they shall all be provided for — your whole family — when my father gets back. Oh, do take them both away !' Jose looked contemptuously at the purse, but took it. ' Ah : gold ! gold : ' he muttered. «* Base, treacherous gold, what awful sacri fices for thy worthless sake are made ! But' (turning to H&rry;) ' it is not epoogh. Remember, my young life is at stake.' 'My watcli,' Harry gasped, 'lay rings, my clothos— everything iu the room : OU, do ptoe take ihtm loth away :' ? ' ?? A v-atcb,' Jose repealed, aolilwjmianj again. 'Watches mark the swift passing of the honr« uid mind us every moment tbat that may be oar last. Get me tUe watch, boy.' So saying lie turned from the door, and Harry released his hold and while the quak ing hoy produced the watch, which, together with the purse. Jose thrnst them into hn pocket, the poor boy lifted the other skull from the bare&u;, and saying : — 14 Come, Monty, we're going none,' thrust it quickly into the basket beside the other and was gone.' A minute later an ordinary peon boy, with a porter's badge that protected him from police interference, was walking leisurely down the street with a basket on his head. When Jose Molina met Mr. Gray at break fast next morning, be handed over to him tbe watch and purse. Bat Harry Sp&ulding; lay abed with a headache.
