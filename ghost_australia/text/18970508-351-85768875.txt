SWEARING IN LAW COURTS. TO THE EDITOR. SIR, — Some time ago severe and merited criticism used to be passed on the frivolous and irreverent way in which officials in Law Courts were wont to gabble over the oath administered to witnesses. This has been altered, and a more decorous method is now observed. But it is possible to overdo a good thing. In the sessions held in Parramatta this week the presiding judge has himself administered the oath, and few who were present at all regularly can claim that the performance was a success. Reverence is all very well, but where it degenerates into mock emotion it is just as mischievous as irreverence. Judge Murray pronounces the last four words of the oath in a voice broken with elocutionary emotion, as if he could with difficulty restrain his tears — the sort of voice that might be appropriate to the "God have mercy on your soul" with which the death sen- tence ends. It is obvious that no mere man can feel genuine emotion about 50 times a day, and consequently Judge Murray's elocutionary effort, which may impress when heard once, becomes monotonous and evidently insincere on constant repetition. It irresistibly reminds one of the Ghost of Hamlet's father. Hamlet : Swear by my sword. Ghost (beneath in bass monotone) : Swear. Hamelt : Ha ! ha ! boy ! say'st thou so ? Art thou there, twopenny ? Come on — you hear this fellow in the cellar- age — Consent to swear. Yours, etc., M.A.G. [Judge Murray may argue that, if his man- ner of administering the oath is impressive when heard once, his purpose is served ; that his object is not to impress the public in the court, but the witness in the box. — ED.]
