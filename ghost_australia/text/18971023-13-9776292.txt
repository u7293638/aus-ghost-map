SATURDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1897. A revolution may sometimes creep into the world through a mere crevice; and, if we may believe some recent writers, a revolution which may change the industrial centre of the world, and alter the whole course both of civilisa- tion and of empire, is at this present moment stealing, ghost-like and un- noticed, into the system of things. Mechanical science, like the whirligig of time, has its "revenges." Water powere was the cheap, common, ubi- quitous mechanical force a century ago. Europe, for example, was mottled with mills drive by water- power. They represented the earliest attempts to substitute one of the great natural forces for human muscles and sinews as a mechanical energy. The service extracted from Nature in this way was limited, the method was crude. The mill had to stand directly above the water-wheel, was linked to it by a simple form of gearing, and the mechanical force generated rarely exceeded 100 horse-power. Steam power, of course, swept this primitive form of mechanics away as with a breath. Water became discredited as a mechanical force, and coal took its place. Manufacturing industry and wealth became almost the monopoly of nations which, like England, Germany, and Belgium, were rich in coal de- posits. The race learned to shiver in alarm as it was warned by one scien- tist or another that these coal deposits must some day be exhausted. What would become of England, it was asked, when its last ton of coal had been burnt? It would be pustuled with silent factories, half-buried be- neath a stratum of rusting and aban- doned machinery. But water is coming back to its king- dom as the great source of mechanical energy in the service of man. The tur- bine has taken the place of the water- wheel for collecting the energy of the cataract or the flow of a might river, and translating it into foot-pounds. The dynamo, again, changes the energy thus focussed into electrical force, and this can be transmitted along a wire, and made available for use over a whole province. Thus at Niagara there are single turbines which collect from a single watery thread of that tremendous river-leap 5,000 horse- power of force. A thousand such turbines can easily be brought into use, and in this way Niagara itself can be turned into foot-pounds of mechanical energy, diffused over half a continent along electric wires, and be delivered, like pints of milk or pats of butter, at pleasure at any desired point, and at a cost which leaves steam- power, extracted from the wedlock of coal and water, a hopeless bankrupt. The same miracle can be accomplished wherever a cataract leaps, a river flows, or a tide rises and falls. The energy of the loneliest mountain stream can in this way be taught to pour itself along a thread of wire, and drive the whirring looms of city factories, or the clanging hammers of smoky and crowded foundries, 500 miles away. This great mechanical revolution is described with much graphic force and detail by a corre- spondent of the London "Spec- " tator," who declares that " questions " of tremendous significance" for the modern world are raised by this cir- cumstance; that to Great Britain in particular it represents the most impor- tant change which even the nineteenth ceutury, so packed with dramatic changes, has witnessed. That the change represents an amaz- ing augmentation of the resources of the humau race cannot be doubted. While the sun shines, and the winds blow, and the rain falls, while heat and cold and moisture play their part in the infinite laboratory of the firmament, the rivers of the earth will keep their flow, streams will leap from the hill- sides, the sea tides will rise and fall. A pulse of the primary energy of the physical universe, which has its source beyond the planets, thrills in every running stream on the earth's surface. Here, plainly, is an energy exhaustless and ever-renewed; and if it can be changed at the bidding of human in- telligence into light and heat and me- chanical force, the resources of the human race by that single fact are mul- tiplied a hundredfold. We are only as yet, it is true, spelling out the first letters of this great alphabet, the tiniest syllables in this grammar of discovery and conquest. But science is winged. It files fast. What is a curiosity to- day is a commonplace to-morrow. The writer in the London "Spectator" quotes figures which show how various nations are extracting mechanical ser- vice from water. When the Niagara scheme is complete, America will have 150,000 horse-power from this source. Switzerland has 33,000 horse-power; France, when the schemes now in pro- gress are complete, will have 33,000 horse-power; Germany has one power plant in process of construction at the Rhine-falls, which will yield 16,000 horse-power; Sweden and Norway have between 10,000 and 20,000 horse-power each. England and Scotland come at the end of the list, with only 4,000 horse-power. This figures give an expressive hint of the changes which may follow in the train of this new discovery— changes which may amount to a revo- lution. The writer in the "Spectator" says that, as the result of the general applicition of this new mechanical force, we may witness "a re-arrange- " ment of the relative positions of the " nations of Europe." Not cheap coal but running water will become the condition of industrial supremacy. All the great manufacturing industries must gather around the cheapest centres of power, and these will be, not coal-beds, but cataracts, or swift- volumed rivers. The Amazon or the Nile or the Ganges may become the true nerve-centres of the industrial world! Irish politics and Irish poverty alike take their complexion from the fact that Ireland has no coal-bes and therefore no manufactures. But Ireland is full of the music of running streams, and these may create richer industries that the coal mines of Wales or of " the black country." England, under the changed conditions here suggested would fare badly, and Australia would fare still worse, for our rivers are the laziest and shallowest streams that seam the earth's surface. They vanish, indeed, like ghosts in midsummer. But does the pre-eminence of the all- conquering Anglo-Saxon race merely depend upon a geological accident, like the presence of coal deposits in par- ticular districts? Everyone quotes the New Zealander viewing the ruins of the metropolis from London Bridge. But is this tragical end to be accom- plished by a mere water-turbine? Will a discovery in mechanics, that is, change the course of history in this fashion? It is folly to imagine it. National power depends, in the last analysis, on national character, on the energy, the fortitude, the daring, the moral soundness of the race. Science, by its discoveries, no doubt powerfully affects history. But no change in mechanics, no revolution in science, can ever rob a race like the British of its great place in the world. If it is possible for Britons north of the Tweed to render "Scots wha hae" more fervently upon one occasion than another, the acme of patriotic enthu- siasm must have been reached at Stirling last month. The sixth cen- tenary of Wallace's victory at Cam- buskenneth over the English troops under Warenne—called in history the Battle of Stirling Bridge—was cele- brated by Scotchmen with the pride which memory of their hero always conjures up; and Lord Rosebery set the coping-stone to his popularity in Scotland by the stirring address he de- livered upon the leader who, if he did not himself permanently win indepen- dence for his country, made it pos- sible. There are plentiful reasons why Scotsmen should still celebrate the triumph of Stirling, and none why Englishmen should object. The "South- " rons" do not commemorate Falkirk or Flodden, for one thing because these fields were not won by them in the cause of national liberation.
