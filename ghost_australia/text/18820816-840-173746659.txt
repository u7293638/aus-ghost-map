TJNFAIE BUSINESS. i To tub Editor.— Sir, — There is a little game going on in this city which I think should be exposed. I allude to the manner in which certain labour offices are conducted. The modus operand* is to get men and women to leave their Bituationo and take others, whether they suit them or not, for the only purpose of getting 6n. from the person employed and 2s. 6d. from the employer. Thoso pooplo hang around your kitchon doors and find out if the a sorvant does his or hor work properly, and thon tho servant is persuade to leave on ncoount of the mistress or master having said they were going to discharge Polly or Tommy ; this ie, of course, HeB, and then Mr. Labour Agent gets tho fous on both sides. People who are comfortable in town aro often led to take places iu the buBh and else where, for whioh they aro quite unfitted ; tho fair promises of a good situation vanish at onco, and all for the sake of tho fees for tho agont. Again, thoy put advertise ments in tho daily papers for servants who are in want of situations without a ghost of a situa tion on their books, and I have kuown men, after paying tha 5s. foe, to bo sent long distances, to placos, tho proprietors of whichnevsr required anyono ; and so thoy go on, until tbo mau is wctiry and disgnsted, and leaves the oity, giving it a beautiful namo. I have no donbt that the offices, when properly managed, aro an accom modation, lint lot tho bueinejB be done iu alegiti ruati'|way, not by persuading pooplo to lcavo their situations, and putting ^oth oxployrrr. and employed to a great lo«s ard inconvenionco. I don't know but what they oould bo prose cuted for this.— Youre, &c.; 15th August, 1882. A Scweebii.
