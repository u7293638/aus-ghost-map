Doreen: The Story of a Singer. (Commenced on the 21st April.) By EDNA LYALL, Author of "Donovan," "We Two," "A Hardy Norseman," &c.; " What we wish it that where there has been' despondency there shall be hope; where there has been mistrust there shall be confidence; where there has been alienation and hate there shall be woven the ties of a strong attachment between man and man"— The Kigiit Hon. W. £. Gladbtonb. Chajjter VIII.—" Tbll Me, Mt Hiabt." Warren, the tenor, seemed greatly pleased with the substitute the agent had found him, and Doreen acquitted herself well, as even the unmusical Freen could guess. Her eagerness to do everything in the best possible way was satißfaotory; it was not every one, he reflected, who took so much pains for a oity dinner. "Come a little early to-morrow night," he said, " and we will rnn through the grace and the National Anthem in the artistes' room with the other parts. I will ask Mme. Saint Pierre to be kina enough to oome a few minutes beforehand for your Bake." Doreen could talk of nothing else when she got home, and the children shared in her ex oitement. Yet when the day actually otirae the poor girl felt sad enough, for tho craving for her mother's presenoe returned with over* whelming force, reaching its height when she unfolded the white Bilk dresß embroidered with shamrocks which had been the last work Mrs. O'Ryan had done before leaving New York. More than one hot tear fell as she put it on, and it was well that Dermot and Mollie came trotting up to beg to be her page and her maid, for nothing but their childish gaiety and their delight in the new dress could have cheered her. All too soon Hagar Muchmore came to carry them off to bed. "It's muob too early," protested Dermot, prepared to offer a stubborn resistance; " the dock only stroke 6 just now. I heared it." "That's so," said Hagar quietly; "but I guesß you'll always have to be in bed early the nights your sister sings, for I mast go and take care of her." " Why ?" asked Dermot. " I thought grown up people took care of their own selves, and Doreen is awfully old." This set them all laughing, and in her heart Doreen rather wondered how Mrs. Muohmore would comport herself in the artistes' room. Her presence), however, was decidedly comfort ing when, having left the ohildren safely in bed, taken a hurried farewell of Aunt Garth and Michael over their game of draughts, and of Uncle Garth buried in papyrus documents, she stepped forth into the cold night, and leaning back in the cab saw the gaslit streets and the busy passengers Hitting past as they rolled swiftly away to tho city. Arrived at the Grooers' Hall, she was taken upstairs to the room set apart for the performers, and having taken Warren's injunction to come early in the most literal sense, she waited through what seemed an eternity before any one else ap peared, growing more and more nervous every minute. At last Warren himself came in, accompanied by the pianist, who was intro duced to her; then, after an interval, a very fat, heavy bass, with an enormous black beard, stalked in with his music under his arm. Finally, with a little bustle of avrival which seemed to betoken her celebrity, there entered the great Madame St. Pierre, with her Frenoh maid in attendance. Warren treated her with the greatest deference, while Doreen, feeling horribly young and inexperienced, watched the great lady as she was divested of a magnificent plash oloak bordered with the most costly for, and contemplated with awe the regal gown of ruby velvet and the diamonds that flashed upon the ample white neok of the great con tralto. Beside such assured grandeur, such queenly composure, she felt like a wretched little white ghost; she was conscious, too, of being decidedly hungry after her long waiting and her very frugal 4 o'clock dinner; her knees trembled beneath her when Warren said: " May I introduce Miss Doreen O'Ryan to yon, Madame St. Pierre ? a debutante from America, and a pupil of Rathenow's." Madame St. Pierre gave her a Btately, somewhat frigid, greeting— novices from America were not popular. She consented, however, to run through the grace and the National Anthem, and at the close there was a distinct change in her manner. " Oh, you will get on very nicely; you need have no fear about that," she said good* nataredly. "By-the-byc, Mr. Warren, have you heard anything about Madame De Berg's projected tour in America? I hope it is not true that she intends to take with her that unluoky little violinist, a mere baby of 7, who ought to bo in the nursery." "No; her father will not permit her to appear as y«t in public, and is taking her to Germany to study there until she is 10 or 11." "That's tho most sensible thing Harry Kingston ever did in his life," said Madame St. Pierre approvingly; "it went to my heart to think of that unfortunate child being dragged through the United States in the company of Madame Do Berg." " She 13 Kingston sa cousin," said the tenor. " Yes, and has a most unlucky influence over him; it will be well for the child if her kins woman's caroer is over before her own begins. I should like to have invited Una to play with my own children, but I assure you it was out of the question: the child is a perfect little heathen, and lies as glibly as a hardened woman of the world. It's easy to see who has had the training of her." Doreen listened to the conversation with Homo interest, feeling not a little compassion for the infant violinist who was too depraved to meet Madame St. Pierre's children; and while she was still wondering what sort of person thin Madame De Berg could be the summons came for the performers to go down 1o the banqueting hall. • A brilliant soene was disclosed as they emerged from tho starroaae into the gallery at fene end of the building; down befow wero the ■ gorgeously decorated tables, with their lavish; \- display of Mowers and rioh plate, their tempting -ffait and dainty sweetmeats, darkly outlined by iheprosperouslooking diners in their sombre ißTßning dress. At the other side of the gallery sat a fow magnificently attired ladies, the wives of tho city magnates, and of the most distin guished gae3ts of tho evening. And now the dreaded moment had actually arrived, and Above the subdued roar of conversation rose the stentorian voioe of tho toastmaster, who stood behind tho chairman: " Gentlemen, pray silenco for grace." . It was a voice that made one feel as if the D.iy of Jndgraent had come. Doreen tried to forget the great hall and the glaring lights; she thought of the dim nursery at home, and of the children asleep; she tried to pretend that Bhe was siuging in the drawing-room to Max Here ford once more, and her voice rang out dearly •as she sang: '.. For tlieso rh<l*ll Thy meroies Riven t * % We" Wcsi'mrM prtriee Thy mono, O Lprfl; - ' " •** May wo reoeivy trhem witli thanksgiving, - , - TSvcir UijsUnsiiiThy Vfoid,. ... •• .. . ' 'I'D 'J'hceitipDO nshoDour, glory, \- ' "Now,;&JiG; ffoto ban&iforl;'h for cvermottS. Aifcrti. • ; The ordeal was over, and while the toaßt waster snooted out, " Gentlemen, be pleased \o iiU your glasses;, bumpers, if you please," Doreen. wa3. able, to Bit down, and was glad enough to do so, for the floor of the gallery seemed rocking beneath her; tho thought of her solo inado her shudder, and she scarcely heard tho chairman's speeoh. It was not till the whole assembly stood up, loyally shouting, "Tho Queen I tho Queen!" that she forgot her foarc. But when, as tho four performers stood up, a hush instantly fell upon tbo great gathering a sense of power and of keen delight in the power came to her. The pianist led off, and the first verse of the National Anthem was sung as a quartette. Then Doreen's fresh young voice rang through tbo building, and she first realised what it meant to ronso and stir an audience. In her rendering of the verse Thy choicest gilts in stove there waa such ardour, suoh contagious en thusiasm, that not only the professional singers but the wholo assembly joined in the chorus—-joinod, not formally or frigidly, but with purpose and intention. . "I oaH thiit-pretty good for a Fenian's \- daughter," observed the fat baas to Warren as the Bingcrs left the banqueting hall for a time. His voice had beeDinsufliciently lowered, and Doreen, who was a little in advance, turnod round to confront him. ■ "lama Home Ruler," she said, her colour rising a littlo, " not a Separatist. There is no one I rcverenre and admire more than the Queen. But when I pray that she may * defend our laws' I assuredly don't mean the countless Coeroion Acts under which my country has groaned, bat the just laws our Parliament of the future will pass. Even rebels know how to honour goodness. Meagher once thrashed a man who spoke disrespectfully of her Majesty." The fat bass stared—he did not in the least understand her; but Warren, the tenor, liked her spirit, and with a kindly word or two turned tho talk to some other subject. After thia came an interval when she was glad to sit quietly by Hagar Muchmore in the artistes' room. A strangely dreamy feeling cropt over her; sho forgot her present sur roundings, and fell to thinking of Max Here ford. Why had hin eyes rested so tenderly on her as he said that he grudged her to the city aldermen ? Why had be professed to be jealous of Brian Osmond, the doctor ? Why had he at parting taken her hand right into his and held it for a rainnte as if he would fain protect her? Not one of her New York admirers had been capable of reaching her heart; they had,been charmed by her singing and by her amusing talk, but Max Hereford, by a mere look, a mcro touch, had in a single afternoon outstripped them all. She turned over the leaves of her next sonp, by waj of checking her thoughts, but to littlo purpose; for was not the song " Tell me, my heart" ? And what wa3 i! that her heart was tolling her ? It was silent, quite silent about that great career which every one prophesied for her; it was not the very least slated by the consciousness of her power, or the knowledge that she had suoceeded well; it held only one image—that frank, open English face, with its warm colouring, its genial expression, Us light brown hair and well-opened hazel eye 3. If any ono had given her the choice at that moment of all that she most desired sho would unhesitatingly have said the presence of Max Hereford. " Time for your song, Mhra Doreen," B«id Hagar, " and you'd best be careful of yont dress on the stairs, for thoae waitors they've dropped gravy and cuetard, and I don't know what all, upon them." Doreen laughed aa sho gathered up her train; she wondered what had come over her that all at onoe she should feel 30 strong to face the world. Only a little while ago she had stood like a forlorn little ghost beside the great contralto, and had glanced with timid awe at those marvellous silk dresses; of the city ladies, wbioh looked as if they would stand alone from the inherent virtue of their extra Buperfine quality. There was surely, ton a new power in her rondering of Bishop's song. Never before had she attained such pathos as in the first verse, or suoh joyous, irrepressible happiness as in the seoond part of the song. The auditfnoe heartily approved of her, and she wont home with Hagar Muchmore, holding the three sovereigns and the three shillings in her hand with a glad conscious ness that they were but the earnest of muoh. more to follow. It was not until the quiet of the house in Bernard-street once more sur rounded her that she realised how lonely she was. Uncle and Aunt Garth were the kindest people in the world, but they had singularly little power of expression, and went on the prin otple of " deeds, not words." Now, Doreen was one of those who disputed the truth of this saying, stoutly maintaining that deeds without words were as dull aa bread without butter. She sorely missed the genial flow of talk which her father had accustomed bar to ; Bhe longed with an intolerable longing for her mother's, swoet faoe and ready sympathy. Half the pleasure of success.would have been in the joy it would have given to her parents, and some how it was impossible to givo a graphio descrip tion of the evening at the supper table, where Uncle: Garth sat with bis newspaper before him, N or to respond very much to Annt Garth's low-, toned questions. The profound gravity of tho atmosphere seemed to strangle all natural mirth ; moreover, there was something trying in the very small appetites of the host and hostess to this hungry girl of 18, who, after her very early dinner and the hard evening's work, could have eaten a far more substantial tneal than the one prepared. It was inevitablo that in the silence her thoughts should wander back again to Max Hereford—Max, who had some how helped her that night to sing as she had never sung before, and whose life, for weal or for woe, was irrevocably bonnd up with her own. It seemed the most natural thing in the world that he and his mother should call the next day. The house grew brighter at once to, h*r ianct, and. with an almost motherly jprida she «bjoyed showing the children to Mrs. Here-t ford, whose heart was tonohed by the littl&palo; faces, which showed evident signs of recent illness. "They want country air, my dear," she said. ?• You had better send them down to Monkton Yemey; we would take eveiy care of them. lUve you a nurse you could trust to take them there ?" " Yes; Mrs. Muchmore is the most trust worthy being in tbo world," said Doreen. "But there are so many of them; it would be giving co muoh trouble in your house. 4' "The place is just standing empty," said Mrs. Hereford; " and a month in the country would do them all the greatest good. As to trouble, you need not be afraid in the lea9t; the servants will be thankful to have them, for they find the months of our absence dull enough. Gome, let us arrange to send them dov n next week—it is such an easy journey—and then in Easter week, when we intend to spend a few days there ourselves, you will, I hope, come with us ; the country will be looking very pretty by that time. To my mind, there are great advantages in a late Easter, and you will be able to see how your little folks are getting on." Doreen's heart bounded with pleasure at the suggestion ; she dould only gladly consent to a plan so entirely in accordance with her own feelings, and, as Mrs. Hereford turned to talk to Mrs. Garth, she looked up half-shyly at Max. "Do you remember," she said, "how long ago in Ireland you told me all about your home, and abont the old priory, and tho fir hills, and the heather?" "Ah, we shall jnst be too early for the heather," said Max. " You must come again later on for that. There are dozens of places 1 want to take you to. We must climb Kooka bui-y together, and yon shall wish for a pros perous career at the Wishing Tree, and we will row on Trenoham Lake, and fancy that we aro once more- at Castle Karey; and, happy thought! we will have the grand opening of the new Fir dale coltee tavern while you are there." " After last night I feel more than half in clined to turn teetotaller," said Doreen. " What an atmosphere it was to sing in! And then, when I got back to the artistes' room with my throat all on fire with the smoke and the con centrated essence of the dinner which flouted up to us in tho gallery, there was all the dif ficulty in the world to get just a glass of water; thero was any amount of champagne, but a glass of water seemed unattainable until Hagar Muchmore, who is not easily beaten, went down herself to forage for it." "Who will go about with you if this Mrs. Muchmore is down at Monkton Verney with tho children?" ♦• Well, if I am lucky enough to get any en gagements, I shall havo to go alone," said Doreen. "But they say it is better, when you can, to have some one with you. I shall not be able to take Hagar about the country with me when I begin to get provincial engagements, though,' for you see tbo expenses would mount up dreadfully. Those who arc alone in the world must learn to fend for themselves." A look of trouble swept over Max Hereford's bright face ; he seemed about to speak, but at that moment little Moltie trotted up to her sister with a note which had just arrived. "Freen, tho agent!" said Doreen, glancing at the handwriting. " Perhaps he has heard of more work for me. Excuse me one moment." She read the letter, and looked up with spark ling eyes. "It is an offer to sinu in the * Messiah' the day after to-morrow at the Albert Hall—just think ! That charming Miss Latoucbe is still indisposed !*' They all laughed at her candid speech. " Well, well," she added, " I am, of coarse, sorry for her, and I hope it's a comfortable sort of illness. But only to think that my greatest wish should have come so soon ! I wonder howl shall manage 'Re joioe greatly' in that huge place ? It almost frightens me to think of it." •• We must come and hear you," said Mrs. Hereford. "By-the-bye, had yon not better drivo there with us ? What time should yon wish to be there ?" " Ob, not more than five minutes before the beginning,'' said Doroen. " Never again will I be unpunctual at the wrong end, and have a wholo hour to wait, as I had last night. It takes all the courage out of one, and sets one's nerves on edge. It is so very kind of you to offer to take me." "It will be a great pleasure," said Mrs. Here ford, kissing the sweet, sunshiny face, which seemed to her still to retain much of its child like charaoter. " I have of ton wondered whether I should ever again hear the voice that Max discovered in Ireland; and to hear you in the ' Messiah' will be a special treat." " I shall not feel so alone if you are in the audience," said Doreen. " I shall sing to you and forget the rest of the people." [to be continued.]
