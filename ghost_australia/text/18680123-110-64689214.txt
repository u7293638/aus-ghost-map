THE FUNERAL OF THE YEAR 1867. BY G. G. McC. Toll! for the dead old year, Prone on his starry bier, Sullenly passes. Strewn on his breast, dead hours Like ghosts of whithered flowers In dreamy masses, With doubts, and hopes and fears, Breathed in now deafen'd ears, Heart-mocking blisses, With transient smiles and tears, And pain and all his peers, Wan, worn-out kisses. Breathe! winds, that rise and fall, And gently wave the pall Whose cloud reposes Calm on the Death-King's thrall With faded roses-- That pall a midnight sky Stern in its majesty, Whose setting stars's pale rays Stream downward through the haze In silver tears, Blurred to the weeper's gaze, A pallid, fitful blaze, Since Grief crowns fears, Toll! He is passing on! Roll leaven's diapason In mournful thunder, And break the silent calm With grandly swelling psalm! Woe without wonder. The gates are won--Fall back! For centuries in the track Are pressing on. And ages of the past Their dim eyes towards him cast, Their hands extending. Blow! winds, the farewell blast! For bier and year have pass'd, Both space-wards wending. Closed is the wondrous gate-- Closed by the hand of Fate Within--the ages serried Surround, mayhap, the bier And pall of starry tear Till both be buried-- Buried to rise again And live--spite spot and stain-- In History's pages. A memory of pain And joy--of born and slain, And good and ill, For ages. \--The Colonial Monthly.
