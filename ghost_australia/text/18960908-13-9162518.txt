ANGLO-CATHOLICISM AND THE APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION. DE. RENTOUL'S REPLY TO CANON POTTER. On Sunday, in St. Kilda Presbyterian Church, Dr. Rentoul delivered his second lecture in reply to the lectures of Canon Potter. Taking as his text the words, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good," the lecturer said,—The use of con- troversy, its only worthy use, was just what the text expressed—to prove things, to sift specious error from truth, and to make clear and hold fast that which was good. Let them look at the great thing involved in this discussion. It is just the question of what Christ had come to do. The sacer- dotal—including the Anglo-Catholic—no- tion of religion was just the opposite of what Ghi ist lind taught It ssns the notion that the approach to God can bL secured only by nsvesomo c\tcinilism of objee tis c ritual-dono or tnnsicted aiithontn tisely by "conseeinted nnd ghostly men on your behalf, 01 hs penances or by men tonoits moitiheations of join body donc lis jouiself Only thus, its theory wa«, could von get God to bo fay oin able to jon' So, yy ithout external baptism, it taught, one cannot be saved Again, oven a St Paul, though he should lepent and be consorted set (ns the manual called "The Catholic Religion" tenches) ho ssns not regenerated -not bom agini until he was baptised c\ tel nally svith ssatei Again, only by a min eilled a "bishop' Injing his hands on join hcid m "coniiimation"-some nte not set forth in the New Testament, but imposed bv the Church-can yon recéis o the Holy Ghost Again, only thioiigh i man 01 darned to tho ministrs, by the laying on of external hands of a min called a ' bishop," and thus made a priest, can God s grace come lo believing men tlnoiigli objee tisc sacraments vshieh those piiLSts bless, then through the priest's consecrating player-"the bod} and blood of Christ (arc) present m the snciament sindel the form of broad and wine" ('Catholic Reit gion," pago 255) And so men "rocciv o the body nnd blood of Christ is Inch nie hidden beneath the bread and ssine" When you ask boss hay o those bishops ' the poss or to confer this ass ful ghostly function and vir tue sinon men, miking thom actual mediating priests, able to offei up the "sacrifice of the mnss ' foi other men, the answer is, Oh, the bishops aie "successors of Apostles," thnt is, "the ApostoliL sue cesston"1 And sslicn you sas, Hut I never lead in the New Testament that Apostles had nnv suth possei thcmsclses or es cr ann! c of the Lord's Suppei in this yy n>. or that they had nuy successots," and yvlien sou suy, .ultim, "Dear me, in the Ness Testament bishops and picsbytors. vere iiist the same"-Ah! there you begin to dig' into the historic empliiiLss and the fccnp turil talsilj of this whole puostlj thorny It is pagan, not Christian, it ia opposed to the \s hole spirit of the New *l cstnmciit Aichbishop Sinclair quotes Rtdlcs, the bishop nun ty i, as declaring this vv hole iden of a sierihce of the mass ssns "a noss blasphemous kind of sacrifice " In his for mer lectuics ho (Dr Rentoul) had piosed tint the first Refoimers of the Chut eli of Lnglnnd sscio m these matters quite at one svith Calvin, of Geneva, and suth the othct Svv iss iinil 1 rench Rcfoi mers The y icss of the Lord s Supper held by Crmmer, Ridley, Latimei, lfoojiei, md the test was the same ns that held bj Cabin, llueci and Kno\ Further, the first English Rofoimors did not in the least beliese in 'the Apostolic succession " or m tho dis mc light of cpis copaos Nor did es on Elizabeth's bishops believe in it He svus assnic that Canon Pottei challenged tins, owing to not having studied the facts But the facts could not be gainsaid Huillín said so, Lord Jlncnnlny said so Other eminent histoiinns said so Nuj, more, Canon Bright the one historian of note amongst the Anglo Catholics them seises, confessed it Amongst the many facts which prosed it olio or two would suf hoc 1 Ho hail bltown in his last lecture that in 1004, as Into us dames l's leign, the Convocation of Canterbury m both Houses had commanded all cleigvinen lo "praj foi the Holy Catholic Church i c, for the sy hole congregations of Christian people dis pcrsctl llnoiii,limit the whole world, and es pecially for the Chinches of England, Scot lind, and Ireland " Now, at that time the ordination of the ministry m the Church of beotland ssas purely Prcsbs tci inn 1 lint was in the seal lb04 Just the y eui before AVbitgrft, Aichbishop of CantLibury, In dtiectton of the King instructed all tliL elcigj of the Chinch of rnghnd to hive a contribution mnde m nil Ibu churches for the assistance of Calvin's eily of Oenevn, which had been put to great sufferings ind loss, lliiough an attack by the Ro mamst anny of the Duke of buoy, and yyhieh lnd prestousls incurred lteisv expense by its noble harbouring of and its unstinted hospitality given to the Church of Knghnd refugees in the -llirinn persecution Land had not jet risen 1'ngland still remem beied giatefullj the noble brothorh ness and succour of tho Refoinintton churches of the Continent 'Of that ltos pitnlity anti brollicibooti Wordsworth m our own da) still lcmcmbeicd, and sang of the Anglic m exiles talcing refuge under tho protection of tho Prosbjteiiau elim ches of the Continent -

They should remember, however, that Laud suffered by fiat of England's Parliament, for great crimes and intoler able cruelty. " Let them go and read in any impartial history, in Hallam or Green or Gardiner, the account of Laud's rule in England; his during plot along with Strat- ford to destroy all right of private judg- ment, and all liberty, civil and religious, in both England and Scotland. Let them read the woful decisions of tho Star-Cham ber, and he would defy most men to read them with eyes quite free from tears. Let them study the accounts of the awful sen- tences on Prynne, Burton,' llnstwick, mid Dr. Alex. Leighton-the ear-cropping, the nose-slitting, tlio branding with hot irons on the cheeks, the crushing (inca, the per- petual banishments into far-off prisons. J'hen, most tragic of nil, let them rend the noble bciiriiiK of these men's wives, heroic amid their husbands' sufferings; und the petty ruthlessness of Laud in urging Went- worth that the sufferers should not bo allowed to speak out of the pillory to the people, .and the dastardly refusal to let their wives see them ever moro in thoir imprisonment. And what wan their crime but the assertion of thnt freedom of speech which is tho birthright of every .english- man? In those cruelties historians tell thnt Land and his bishops were the fiercest instigators. Hut there was a moro drcad ful side to this. It was for resisting or criticising Charles J.'s "Book of Sports." for Sunday, mid the state of morals and of the theatre, that some of those sufferers were thus hnckeel and torn. Canon Potter had recklessly, talked oE "antinominnism," and had (copying a modern uubclioving writer) garbled a hymn which lind a place in u modern noble religious movement ns antinominnism. No!- The simple, ti nth was thnt the real nntinomians wore the Lnudinn nnd Stuart bishops and clergy, who enacted a book of Sunday sports and Sunday revels to tempt tho noonie /rom thal Bible reading which made Puritans. These things were facts of history, and you could read them cither in historians or in the pictures given of tlicm from that very time by great souls like Richard Baxter. England wu_ never more immoral than in that Laudian era. The heaviest condemna- tion upon Anglo-Catholicism was just this, that its forerunners in English history were identified with the most tyrannous and basest level the English nation ever reached, whether civil or religious. The picture of the doctrinos of the Laudian clergy sketched by Hallam was indis- tinguishable from the doctrines of the modern medii-valism called Anglo-Catholi- cism. Hallam names it Laud's "bastard re- form," nnd shows how near to Roman Catholicism it brought England Now, Canon Potlci, in his attempt to deal with lus (Dr Rentoul s) doset iption of Anglo Catholicism, did not impair it in nnj ssay His (tho lecturei s) description ysas bnscd exactly upon the Anglo Catholics' ow n svritniEs As to the "right of private judg n ent," that ex pi ession nnd his description of the Anglo Catholic hate of it was quoted from Newman himself Ncssmnn's svisn was toarrest thiscxerctso of privntojudgniontoii the part of tho laits and to get the Church of Englnnd graduallj accustomed to Bien sacerdotal methods without anj piolest Canon Pottci vsas singulnrls iirelcsant in trying to turn the flank of this, by nn attack on the Presbyterian Church's creed This was forceless as seen by two facts 1\. No one held that tho Presbyterian creed was necessary to salvation as the Anglo Catholics held then creed to be 2 Canon Potter's description of tho Presbyterian creed was a mere caricature on the articles of the Church of England itself For that church's Calvinism of predestination m its articles was exactly the same us that of tho Confession of faith But then the Presby terian Church had modified and modernised in its Declaration, its understandings of its doctrines, whereas Canon Pottci's articles stootl unchanged Also, the late Dean Stanley lind shown that the Westminster Confession of faith was the only creed that distinctly taught ' the right of private judg ment" and "tho liberty or contingency of second causes " and of man's choice 'I hen creed taught tho froeness of God's offoi of grace to all mon Es en to tho very grave side Cation Potter's formulnnes tarried the asset tton of "the number of the elect " So he should not throw stones at the creed of othei chuichcs No thought of baptism as nccessaiy to regeneration hampered the lnigeness of the Presbyterian Chuuhsl ciecd But lho most important muttei of all was Canon Potters dealing with the uso of ntes -mil symbols and cspeciallj with tho Lords Sttppci His picture ysas I of a mnn nt the Pool of Silonn in (lass when the ceremonial Insy ssns still neeis nuy riieie was n bcttci ptetiue, vi/, white Chi ist caine to a lunn lying nt the Pool of Bethesda, waiting for externalism of moving water and mystic angelic real presences But Christ said to the man rnse and will lho Chi ist s living presence and this mnn s need raino togcthei without any ritual xtttnulism Nlnntling lilvvcm And in His ihureh Christ had it duett! extininl ntl s to suth simplicity and «mnllucss- (two nits vi/ Hint of Imp twin mid of the louis Suppci, whcie His disnplis hit ni a ttimnion table with Himpli blond and wine, and with ni diiLCltous oi iitunl siy tn as to linn tit hy svhom those Minplt symbtls wen to be idniinisU led )-that oiiL yyoudiicd how the sicculotnl mulgum lion h itl IVLU 11 mismo ubi 1 tin se simple I lies mt i i ^ it I ifice it the Miss Ñoyy 1 y f ii tin mo I y it ii tliniL, in nil this (IISLUB sion hy just tilt IL C mon Potter, m his it tempt ti viiuliLitL the positions of the S.111,1 C ilhohis had. si_,nificunlls, SLt lum s li ti sindiLiitL the. tenehiiie. of tin ( I mili of 1 ngillin! on this mnttei 'Hint till not nnd any v indie illili lui no one hid (ilhd it nt inesent in question But I anon Pott e i i stntt nu ut w us m ithei n lucid n ii iieeiti id exi Kition ol the teucliiiiL, oí tin ( lim iii of 1 IIL.1 uni noi of the Amjo ( ilhohes I ot th it Umhin»; tiley lind Hinipls to Iinji to HIL ml handbook called Hie Catholic Religion, anti sie theic its pin tint UHR ft ilium \nil Hint bool yynsliss txtiLiiiL tbnii ninny of Hie handbool s whuh ssi IL lioiiiL, LiiLiilntetl by that pin ty UIIOULJI thi Chinch ot 1 ngluid I but book ilerlniLiI - Souls in the iiitiiincdiutL state (te, puic,nloiy) nn bctielited by tho ollei ing of thu 1 iiiliiiristii SIILIIIILC I lint was n nicdiiisal doetiinc whuh tilt Chinch of 1 III,IHUI1 ni tillen ltpndmtod '\KIIUI, the book declined - lho Holy 1 uilnuiht is a fiast upon ii Hicrtfiie lho bods mid blood of C hunt uro first offered to tho Menial 1 alliLi, and then partaken ol by tho tom ?nunmulta Apun it BUVB -'Chnsl has (.ism to Ilia iliuuh authority to toiiBu mitt, bj tin possii of the llolj bpint, bund mid vsino to lieionio His body anil blood When sve reieivc tho bread and the wine thus consecrated, wo vcnlv and m deed icceivo His sacred flesh and blood ' Again, the book command« -" \\\ c- should nevei speak of receiving bl cid and wine but i ither of i cecil ing the both and blood of Christ, which aie hidden bene ith the bread nnd wine" Again, " Plus îciliti is the body md blood of Chnst, present m the sitciiment under the form of blond and nine ' therefore minute directions m gil cn in the book "not to leave a inn ticlc ' of the bren!
