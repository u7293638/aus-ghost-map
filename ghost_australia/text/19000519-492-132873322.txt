CYCLING. Oassell's Journal is responsible for the following veruoious atory : — Some timo ago a wandering cyolist threw a whole district of the 'I'ranuvaul into a paroxysm of superstitious terror. Travelling by night, his advent might have been unnoticed if two Boers, early abroad next morning in search of strayed bullocko, had not seen the ' spoor or track of the wheelman. With the curiosity of their raao, they followed it for some miles, being anxious to aeuthe man who could trundle a whnelbar row ao far without a reBt. After an hour's trncking, one ot tho Boors remarked—' The fellow muBt bo thief. Lob us go and tell tho landdroat' (magis trate). Accordingly tho worthy Dutch justico wss brought on tho scene, aud ho was accompanied by a score of armed Boors. Tho wbolo party followed tho ' track token by tho oyclist, and halted at noon for dinner while tbo horaou grazed. Tho mystorious trail was tbo object ot muoh scrutiny. Suddenly, ono farmer exclaimed — ' Look hero, landdrost ! If it was a barrow, whore ia the ' spoor ' of the man who wheeled it ?' ' My graoioUB !' exclaimed that official ; '? I never thought of that! Let's bco. Yos; here is the wheel-mark right enough ; but whore are tho foot prints P It iB — 'it must bo— yep, yea — ride boys, ridt- — il's a ghost.' I'ruaumably, those aimo farmers are now quite familiar with tho roving whuelman, and the single track of tuo ubiquitous wheel. There iB no change in tho poraoui'l of tho riders in tho front rank in England, and, unlesB some now speed morchant dovelops, rnoing at homo promiooa to fall rathor. fiat. A. A.
