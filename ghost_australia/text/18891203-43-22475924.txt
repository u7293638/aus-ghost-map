AWAKENED. BY MRS. S.S. ALDRICH. Seen a pretty liomo it was—anoldfarm house, partially moJernised,,with a big bay window, broaupiazza, anil sunny verandas, and nn old-fashioned porch at tlie back over which the morning glories clambered. Tlio wide green lawn in front sloped down to a graded villngo street not ten minutes walk,from a large summer hotel. Hut back of jtho hdiiso acres and acres of rich, level farm land stretched away, wheri chttio fed, nnd whero big barns waited for the luxuriant crops of hay and grain that filled tho wido mows when tho haying season was over. Clyde- Orange was considered tho:finest farm in all tho country round, and when tho young master, Willis Clyde, five years ■before, brought to it his pretty wife, Milly, people said she was a fortunate woman. But Jlilly in her lovely homo, was not entirely happy. She was young and some thing ofa dreamer, and still had that old fashioned notion that husbands ought to be lovers. And Will, though ho had been an ardent lover, soon settled down after his marriage to his farm and its duties in a very prosaic"•way. Pretty brown-haired Jlilly! How lovely, how dainty sho was, with her pink and white face and her dove-liko eyes! And though so young, sho was a mo3t capable housekeeper, and the kindest mistress in the world, as Aunt Dolly, tho cook, and libra, the stout Irish housemaid, could both testify. Every room in the rambling old house was tastefully arranged.and in immaculate order. She made charming toilets, too, for Will bought her beautiful clothes. " But, oh, dear!" she thought so often, with tears in her pretty eyes, "what is the uso of changing mv dross at all except for ray own pleasure? Wili would never know whether I wore a satin or a faded calico gown." ■ Ho had bought for her own exclusive use a gcntlo pony and a pretty dog-cart; and though lie was never too busy to harness it for her, the careless way ho would toss her the lines afterward made Hilly remember, though Will forgot, that tho happiness of life, to one woman at least, was made up of little things. , " Delightful afternoon teas she gave, some times indoors, sometimes on .the wide, beautiful lawn. ; And they were always largely attended, for pretty Jfrs. Clyde had hosts of friends nt the big hotel and about the village. Other people were not un mindful of her charms if her husband was. And when sometimes at their tennis or cro quet Will passed through the yard on his way to the house or field-—Will, with his broad, handsomo shoulders and drooping black moustache—and carelessly touched his hat to tho players, for he knew them all, the tell-tale flush on llilly's chock, and the sparkle in her soft eyes, showed how proud she was of her former husband, "Willis' Clydo was a handsome man, hand somer far than even aristocratic Ncal Rivers, with his six feet of stature, his blonde moustache, and laughing blue eyes that could look so steoly, bitterly sarcastic He and his mother and his Cousin Clare were summering at the hotel. They came early in June when Neal was just recovering from a fever, and looked very much like a long limbed ghost. Long ago ho had grown brown and strong, but lie still lingered, though July had gone, and the ficry moutbed tiger lilies had opened their eyes to the blazing August sunshine. It was tho day for Longmead picnic; a slumbrous August day, almost sulphurous with intense heat. 1 lie long, dusty road stretched away like a winding white ser pent between the green hedges, making even the thought of cool, shadowy wood lands a delight on such a morning. They started at ten o'clock; Milly, who could not coax Will to go with her, riding with the others in a largo van. Ncal Rivers drove his Cousin Clare and Madge Winters over in his buggy. How glorious tho woods were after that dusty three miles' drive 1 They were soon scattered about in the shady grove, looking like tropical birds. Swings flashed through tho air, with their merry burdens; long tables were spread between tho trees, and far back in some cool retreat a band played dreamily. Jlilly enjoyed it all, but sho was ab stracted and more than usually quiet. Will could not come with her, and of lnte she found herself wondering if it was quite the thing for her to go so much without him. Neal Ith-ers was always with her; why, she told hers«lf, sho really saw more of him in a week than she saw of her husband. That surely was wrong. But why did he mon opolise her so, :when he knew she had a husband? Perhaps, and sho caught her breath quickly, ho was flirting with her, as Madge told him the other day he did flirt with every girl, adding that he ought to get a wifo and stop such nonsense. And though ho laughed, his faco flushod as he said rather impatiently,— "If that is my only safeguard, the chances are that I may flirt all my life, for I shall never have a wife." . ■ " : : He had a pleasant way of doing things, and she had enjoyed his attentions so much at first, as if ho had been her brother; but now, now sho was suspicious of everything, and flushed and paled if she caught his eyes quite unlike herself. And Madgq told him "Ho was like a restless ghost,' and could not keep quiet long enough to enjoy himself or let anybody else do so." : After the delicious dinner, Ifeal proposed that Jladge and Milly should row with him across the hike back of the grove, to a little island where some rare ferns grew among tho rocks. At first Milly declined, but Madge persisted so earnestly that sho reluc tantly consented. As it was cooler now, arid quite a brcozo was blowing, they had a merry, pleasant row. When the boat's keel touched the shore, and Jlr. Rivers was already landed, Jfadge, who was always a careless maiden, found to her dismay that she had lost one of tho beautiful bracelets her father had given her only a short time before. ; • :" Oh," she moaned," I must go right back and look for it. You go ashore with Mr. Rivers, Milly, and when I find it I will come directly back to you. Don't go for the ferns until 1 come, for I want to go too.". " Oh.no, Madge," Hilly said, sturdily. "I am^going back to help you find your brace " What foolishness, with all that crowd of people to help me, Milly! ■- Please get out—the man can row so much faster with out you." :■ But Jlilly still hesitated. She did not want to go ashore with Mr. Rivers, and her face showed it plainly. ■ "Come,">he said, in that masterful way ho had, tolding out Ids hand to help her, " Come, little Puritan," adding with a slightly sarcastic laugh, "there are no bears on the island to devour us while Madge is gone, so do not fear. I havo been here before and know every foot of it." And as he saw her vexed, flushed face he laughed again, but sho gavo him her hand and stepped ashore. They went a little way up tho bank, to where a large maple threw its cool shadow*, and after Mr. Rivers had arranged Milly's shawl over the stones en as to uiiike a com fortable seat, lie threw himself on the grass beside her, funning himself with his straw hat. They sat thus n good while, not talk ing much, watching the heat quiver across the lake like molten silver. For the breeze had gone down again, and again that sulphurous heat was everywhere. LHit clouds obscured the sun, now ami then and in the west huge " thunder-heads " piled themselves up. But they took no notice that a shower was coming, one of those sudden downpours that only come in the lurid heat of do~ days. It was two hours by Mr. Rivers' watch, and still no Madge, no boat " That careless girl lias probably forgotten nil about us," he said, rising. The sun was obscured by this tim.\ nnd there was a low moaning of wind t!imu"h the leaves. He looked about hastily, takin" in the situation at a glance. How"could ho have been so careless ns to take no heed that a shower was coming? tor even as ho looked there was a flash and the llrst muffled roll of thunder. How whito Milly's face grew! Ever since she could remember, she had been frantically afraid in a thunder shower. Even in the safe shelter of her home she sometimes nearly fainted with fright, and now- To the boat-house, quick! It is our hand Cr> SaW ' UaStily takins her They reached it just ns tho first wild torrent of ram dashed down. 110 made the clumsy door fast, nnd then went back to where she was stamling-for there was nothing to sit down upon but the floor She put out her hands and caught bis arm hiding her eyes against his sleeve. As he saw how white she was he drew his own breath hard, put his other arm around her. and let her lean there. Afterward, -when the ocean rolled lx>. tween them, tho memory of that pure, trusting, girlish face against his arm wa3 like a shield -nlxrat-Jiim, the whisper of a "peace, be still," to liis storm-tossed soul. , It, grew very dark in tho boat-hou?e lighted only by;two small -windows at either end;-one could scarcely sen the length of it. Tho lightning was appalling tho thunder terrific, ajfd the rain beat ami blurred against tho windows—and so they Vaited. Sometimes, Lwhen her clasjiini 'fingers lightened or she moaned n littla ns a louder crash shook their frail refuse, | l( , brushed her hair soothingly, and IoM l> t . r not to tremble so; tho worst of it must Boon bo over, anil tlusy could go out npain. When at last it was over, the boat cam',! back for them. They crossed in safety, nnl wero soon ■with tho others in the over crowded Httlo cottage near the grove, where they had taken refujje. Willy lofiknl palo and ill from her fright, and '.Veal was bo quiet that Madge told him lie "njijvnrt~l to haye fallen upon peace by the wayside." for his restlessness of the morning was nil gone. - , . The carriages came at last, the hr?r> van and Wilson, tho coachman, with Jlr. Hirer*' horse and buggy. / *? Madge," Neil said in his authoritntivn manner, as he came into the hall," you will ride in the van, and Milly must go in tlm buggy with Claro; she is tired." " " X'obody .else is, I suppose," Ma'lgo answered in a vexed tone. " ililly b ma<ie of better flesh and blood than the re*t of us." 'tl know that r " he said," so you are going in ;thb van with me, and 'Wilson will drivu Clare and Jl illy in tho buggy." And though Milly did not wish it she win too tired to argue the point, and he had lib way.O ■-l' r€~p<i^; i - I«cit,.day she" had-a nervous headache, and kept her room until nearly night. Tin girls caino to sec her, Madge chattering liku a magpie; ond pitied her, because her htvui ached, and told her -how " wretchedly iluil it had,been all day with Xeal also «ck. or if lie was not sick he wa3 cross and stupi.!, and had lounged on tho piazza all day, do: even;rcadihg. At. nigiit she crept downstairs into the parlbur.twben Wilf came in to read his paper, and sat down near him leaning her head oniiis knee. Sho wanted to tell him of her stay in tho boat-house with Jlr. Rivers, because she thought she ought in, and, he had evidently been nmdi worried about her,yesterday, knowing Jimr timil sho was in a shower,' But after In: found out there .was a house near by when! they took refuge, ho said no won;. So she lvgaii at once giving him the outline of the story rapidly and in a low tone; the roiv, the lost bracelet, the shower, and her stay in tho boat-house with Mr. Rivers while it lasted. When she had finished, she waited with burning cheeks for him to ecoM her. lint Will, who to do him credit, had not heard ten words of what she was saying, nothing but a confused jumble of a boaWiouse, ami ferns, and Madge, said irritably,— " How persistent you are, Milly! What do I care for those people and their small happenings? Enjoy yourself with them if you like, but don't expect me to be interested. I want to read now." Vexed and sorrowing she cried herself to sleep wondering why Will did not care about such a thing as that. She sat in the cool porch the next morn ing shelling peas, when the girls came for her to play tennis. But Milly shoot her head resolutely. " Xo," she said, " a housekeeper has othe; things to do in the morning than jihy tennis." " Wo shall have to send Neal for you, then," said Madge. " lie charged us not to come back without you." And though ililly felt her cheeks bum, she answered, — "You need not send Mr. Rivers. Why should I go for him moro than for you ? " Why, indeed? But ten minutes later ho sauntered lazily up the walk, put his laugh ing face in at the door, and said gaily,— "Como Milly, -we want you. "Don't refuse —we shall bo all going in a few weeks, you know, and then you can shell peas all winter." A3 she ran upstairs to brush her hair arvl get ready, she thought,— "What is the use? I may as well go, for as he says, they will soon bo gone, all of them, and then 1 can do penance, and— and—Will doesn't care." After that she never refused to go with her friends anywhere. She walked, roile, went sailing, played games, went to tho hops at tho hotel to watch the dancers, in short, drifted whichever way tho wav« carried her; because theywont,ed her, and because " Will didn't care!" The night was full of moonlight and tho soft chirp of crickets. It was the last hop of the season. To-morrow many were going home, among them Xeal Rivers and his mother and Cousin Clare, to sail for Europe. Madge wa3 disconsolate. A3 she passed Neal on tho piazza, he caught her arm. "Hasn't ililly come yet?" he said ex citedly. " No," she answered, " I am going now to sco why." " Here, give her tliis." 'He scrawled a few words on tho back of one of his cords, in the moonlight:— " Como back with Madge, You must say good-by. Seal." Sooner than ho thought possible they came, lie stood on the hotel steps waiting for them, hU hands crowded into his pockets, his face horribly pale in the moon light as he looked down upon her face. " Were you not coming ?" ("No," wearily. Then he put her hand' on his arm, and they walked slowly down tho yard into tho moonlit garden. Suddenly he ..turned her about and looked into the piteous white face. : " Little wild bird, your heart is stricken, too, because wo must be parted—and mine, oh. Heaven, mine is breaking!" "Say good-by, and let .ma go," sho panted. ■ Ills hand trembled; he gnawed his mous tache fiercely. " Milly, 1 love you," pleadingly. "Go with mo. over the ocean. You must—you Ehalll I cannot go without you! I never wanted any'other, woman^for my wife—l wjU "nover have any other. With you 1 can be'a good man, without you 1 shail drift to Uades! Come, come, my darling! He will not care—he is hard nnd cold. In a week he will forget he ever had you. In your two small hands you hold my fate— Milly, little brown-haired Milly!" " Milly—-little brown-haired Milly!" ju>t what Will had said, with his arms about her, so long-ago, in another moonlit garden filled with the soft hum of crickets. Over nnd over the words rang themselves iv her cars, — , . " " I am a plain man, not given to many words, but 1 love you, Milly, darling, littlo brown-haired Milly!" ■'> * And woven in somehow with the bars o£ moonlight and tho humming crickets were those other words in letters of lira: "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder}" Down the garden path sho fled like a wounded deer; panting, eager, breathless, she diil not stop until she threw herself across the bed in her own room, and faintol dead away. Two iluys later, when she crept down stairs in tho morning sunlight, with her pale, shadowy face, Will, waiting at the foot, lieM out his arms and clasped her to him, awakened at last.
