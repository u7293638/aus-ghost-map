A young follow offered to run it 200 yards, provided lie got fifty yards' start, and both pony and man to go round a post and back. Agreed. Young Sharisvit places his post so close to a wall that it was as impossibility for the pony to squeeze through. Of course soo classed to have won.. Referred to the Turf Club, they decided there could be no bet, as the youngsterr bet on a certainty. A just de cision beyond a doubt.

Two of the animals, who had, no doubt, managed to get , mere" than'a"'- fain shere of, the ;confectionery, fell " ill after their unusual fare, and at last died. No particular notice was taken of the fact until the stomachs of the monkeys were opened, when it was found that the intestines of one were plugged up. with plaster of Paris, an adulterating agent need in some cases in the manufacture of confectionery; while the death of the other was attributed to leand poisoning, caused by eating lollies colored with chrome yellow (chromate of lead). The Courier's informant also men tioned a case in which a whole family of children wore made seriously ill, ' and nearly died, through eating colored lollies. ODD FELLoWs'ANe SICK 'PAY.-At the Court of Requests at Hobart Town on Thursday, a man named Henry Hare sued Messrs Knoek,Johnson,and Duggan, representative of the Albert Lodge of Odd; Fellows, for Â£10, alleged to be due for ton weeks' sick allowance, in conss quetic-" of plaintiff having been laid up during that period with a broken leg. The defence was based upon a rule of the lodge to the effect that no allowance should be granted to any member during, sickness caused by. his own profligacy or drunkenness. From the evidence it appeared that plaintiff had met a girl on the afternoon of the 20th December crying. She told him that a man named Brown had struck her. Plaintiff saw' -IBrown about it, tolling him that it was cowardly of him to strike a girl. Brown snbsequently met plaintiff and knocked him down, the fall breaking his log. The I Commissioner,- after hearing other evi l dunce, said that plaintiff could not be reproved for interfering on behalf of 'a woman by calling the man who had struck her a coward. The attack was un warrantable, and the plaintiff was to be commended for his interference. It was certainly not the part of a profligate le took; he noted. in a manly spirit, and judgement for the amount claimed was as cordingly given.

S Fonscue TELLINO. - At the Police Court of tice town of 1Barnsley, Yorkshire, on February 0 (says the Dispatch), Sarahi Ellmoro, a married woman, was charged with professing to toll fortunes. The evi dence given by throe young girls was very oxtraordinary, one of them, Martha Ann I Casement, stating that she had had her fortune told several times by defendant at her house by mceans of cards. She said She could bowitch witness's mother, who was then staying at Low Valley, and ad vised that a toad be got, and then filled with pins, and this would have the offect, so defendant argued, of wasting Mrs Case I mont's existenco away. Witness's fattier repeatedly sent witness to look for a toad, n but she eover found one. Sarah Ann Hinchceliffe, aged sixteen, said she had ohoen several times to defendant's house during the last six months, to have her fortune told. She was to have plenty of i swoethearts, and she one day cut her too \- and finger nails, wrapped the parings carefully in a piece of laper, and then r placed the eaper in the ashes. Siee was told that if she did this she would got her future husband that night, who would ap \- pear to leer while she slept. He didn t, ehow-over. (Laughter.) The mayor son \- tonced the defendant to three months' \- hard labor. 5 A MuscULAR INsrEcron.-A quarrel \- took place on Tuesday, says the Argus, e between the Government inspector and lone of the contractors for the WVest Mel \- bourne Swamp, which will result in \- Police Court proceedings.
