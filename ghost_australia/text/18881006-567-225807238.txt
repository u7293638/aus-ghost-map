TEE INTERRUPTS! SENTENCE. ' Charley Robertson is coming Iimia next week,' observed Mrs. Brown. 'You don't say so,' «Tririm«ri ker mother, lire. Wilson. 'Margaret,, take care ! You were just going to poor the milk lustead of the not water into the teapot. Is he c lining home for good, then. Georgian?' ' Oh. no, only for a little holiday,' replied Mrs. Brown. ' He is getting on : beautifully not there, you know, and has a large estate, and I don't know how many thousand sheep.' ' What on earth does he wint to came home for ?' asked Mr. Wilson, with that inclination to disapprove of things in Teiiera! which is one of the symptoms of suppressed gout. 'To see his family, I suppose, papaj 'Rubbish!1 exclaimed Mr. Wilson; ' he had far better scop out and attend to his business.' ' How can yon say sof protested Mrs. Wilson warmly; ' think of his poor mother. Why, he his been away five years ; five years this very month, I do believe.' 'Geonrira,' said Mr; Wilson sharply, (A-Yiaw eilM frf unnru la fvemnlinn filinaa geraniums to pieces.' ' Dear me, so he is,' said Georgiua, looking up cranqnHly froma little skirt she was embroidering. ' Tommy ! Tommy, darling! Margaret, would. you mind fetching him, please.' Xbey were all sitting oo the little lawn surrounded by flower-beds; and shut out from the dusty high road., by wails cioihea in ivy, anil draped with rosea, crimson, white and pink. It wastes middle of June and the sou was Bhnrnro and the -ur was warm, and they were ! having .ea oatiof-doora They - made dins a pleasant lit He family group. Mrs. Wilson, who had been tunning about with her little grandsontiiLshewaa. unshed and exhausted, was now recover- ins her breath and her normal tempera ture in a big arm chair, white she had wiseiy preferred to the more fragile garden seats. Me. Wilson, who bad joined the circle under protest, looked: comfortable though discontented in the- even more lnximnns seat winch had been provided for him. Georgian, tea beauty, who always managed: to look cool in the hottest weather, shone, fresh I and fair as the milk-white roses behind : her. in her delicate iigh&coknnBd; gowni Margaret stood in tee centre of tee group beside the wicker-work table, making tea for them. alL She had not her sister's delicate features or wooing soft ness of expression. Still she was hand some in face as well figure. ' If only Mies Wilson were not so thin in the face,' people would say ; and bad a little mare colour, she would be qsrite as pretty as her meter.' 1 Ah-i but she would never have Mrs. Brown's winning ways,' somebody present was then certain to ramarir ' Bv the by, Margaret,' said Georgiua, as her sister moved to go in pursuit of Tommy, ' he most nut have any eaka : mere are currants in it. You had better take it away at once, before he ££fi3 it.' It was too late Tammy; having become suddenly amadous of the tea- table. came tearing across the lawn just :n rime to observe and to intercept this manoeuvre. A debate ensued condncted by Mrs. Brown, with alternate threats and ciressee and by Tommy with, steady and stentorian crying; till at last a compromise was suggested by Margsret and accepted by both sides, whereby ! strawberry jam was to be suhstituted.&r.; cake: Mr. Wilson dilated on the folly of producing either, as equally poisonous to old and young.. Mm Wilson., who had from the first openly-sided with her grandson, embraced him sympathetically ana comforted him. withdnmps of sugar dipped in cream, whilst Margaret went ap to fetch the jam, of.
