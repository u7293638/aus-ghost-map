SELECT POETRY. HORRIBLE THINGS. (By the Author of The Course of Time.) Heard ye ever the fiend of the wave Growl doleful along the dark shore? Heard ye ever a groan from the grave, Or the murder'd child shriek in its gore? Heard ye ever despair deeply sigh, When hope flitted far from his sight? Heard ye ever the traveller's cry, When beset by assassins of night? Heard ye ever the sprite of the blast Wail through the sad mansions of death? Heard ye ever a wretched outcast Blaspheme with his Iast gasping breath? Heard ye ever the cold clod of dust Crumble down on the coffin low laid? Heard ye ever the life- seeking thrust Of the murderer's blood-glutted blade? Heard ye ever the long thunder-clap Bellow through the dark womb of the night? Heard ye ever the death-warning rap, Or bell tolling without mortal might? Heard ye ever the ghost of the north Howl loud from the mountain's dark side? Heard ye ever the gore gurgle forth From the throat of the wild suicide? Heard ye ever the maniac's yell, Or the clank of the strong iron rings? Heard ye ever a groan from deep hell? If soâ€”ye have heard most horrible things.
