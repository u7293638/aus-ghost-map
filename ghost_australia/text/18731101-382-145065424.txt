THB BUSINESiS OP AMnentMieW t ThackbKat was always hsrpitig o|j(b ijea that it is a serious business for BarUyit^to makei peopie laugh.

Nature, in her queer and often crhel way, seems to exalt in illustrating .tbe principle of Voa turn vobis. Market-gardeners seldom est fruit, fishermen seldom taste .fish, grocers' apprentices are easily surfeited on raisias; critics of all kinds wisb that same Lethe could be diaoovered, by dipping In which tbey might reoover that freshness or taste and keenness of perception whidh the habit' of professional judging has dulled ; and lew people, we imagine, lead a harder life, or enjoy 1esa of unconstrained atad' happy langhter, than those whd avow it as their vocation to entertain the compa^inity. Perhaps I we ought to confine the application of. this ; remark to the rank and file of what, in the1 Era newspaper, is called * tbe profession^' or at least, to these and the subalterns and non commissioned officers. Of - the few persons of commanding genius in the theatrical and musical world, who have bnt to bold AH their band to fortune in order to be helped over a}i difficulties snd seated in ths high #f respect and affluence, we do not apeak. Possibly they have their own labours and sorrows. It rnny be no ess; matter to k»ep artistic skill, even when aeoompanied with genius, at that high pitch of bnroishing which can be relied on to fix the wandering eye of ibo publio; and there is no reason to l-eli£ye that, in the majority of cases, the irritability of genius decreases in proportion to its genuineness or its rat ity. But of those ' pro fessionals ' who take rank with poets or his torians of established reputation we do hot now speak. For one thing, their wave and feelings are comparatively hidden from ua. They- do not advertise. We refer, to that vast brotherhood end sisterhood who invite us in the strongest |iossible terms to lcno^ all al'Out tbem, and prodsim in eloquent ad.- ! vertisementB their power to amuse shd*] delight mankind. We have been looking,; over the advertising columns in several i successive nnmbers of the iSrs, and have been i impressed with the notion, first, that the world which opened upon ns is one of whidb most people khow very little ; and, in the; second place, that the business of- ammiifg men, women, and children, is, even at : this holiday Beason of the year, no laughing matter. The element of mere fun probably' takes s more 'prominent piece among enter- . tainmente in August thsn it wonld jn March A large proportion, however, of the 'artists'-' whose advertisements are before oa .ate in' harness the whole year round ; and the sola, variation hy which their mode of existence can be enlivened depends ..upon change of ' town for country, or upon episodiosl tours to America or on tbe Continent. Tbe word ' fun * mnBt indeed be taken to include Axdte ment of all kinds, exoept that which j^ongs' to tbe tragic stage.
