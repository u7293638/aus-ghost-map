2.-BRITAIN. Why wilt thou ever he unready Jiritam ! While envious foes still hold theo in theirsight, Waiting and'watching in thine armour bright To find a'fatal opening. It.is written ' ' Forewarned is still forearmed, ' ' yet art thou smitten. *By those who watch and hang upon thy might, And on thy glory, almost infinite, . » With the keen hunger of wolves famine- bitten ; And we, who are thy subjects, groan for theo, Groan' to seo precious lives of valient men Cast down and withered, even as the grass 1 Think|of 'foes, ceaseless wiles-the Khyber Pass, Worse than Rome's Caudine forks-a bloody den ! Has't thou thine eyes, and yet disdain'st to soo ? :'???-;?<?: : 3. . A ghost sits by my pillow, as I try To exorcise the fiend that looks like Shaine Waitingito speak dishonour of thy name, Britain ! that hast been and art still so high., i ; I know his features, although turned awry With anger, and with sorrow, and with blamo ; The lion shade of Cromwell, who made famo Wait on thy footsteps, nor dare question why ! He lifted up^his hand, and foes grew pale ; He struck a blow, and nought to strike remained, The wolves and panthers fied before his glance, Sweet peace is born of War-not dalliance Of War ; ¡but.swift destruction rained, - , Like fire from hell, that blasts them with its hail. ^/Ä'Ä-'T ? 4. Keeping sweet Peace for ever in thy sight, , Put war afar if war will keep afar ; But if it will not. let it then be War That turns tho air to blood, and day to night ; - Let foes have all they need, yea, turn and smite E'en to the death, all those thy foes who are ; . Then may sweet peace return, even as a star . Shines Out upon the bosom of dork night. Look to thine Indian borders. Break the jaws Of wolves that prowl that way. On slumbrous seas, Where fair Pacific islands seem to smile, Brook no disdain. Egypt's tangled guile, Leave to her crafty rulers ! Not ,for these Should British blood Btill flow in such a cause. Mowbray, January 23,1885.
