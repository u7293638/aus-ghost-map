ORIGINAL LINES THE INGRATES. What shall we say of the ingrates? those whom we trust as our friends, Gave them our best on the impulse, seeking no time-serving end; Led them to hidden recesses, sacred to honour and trust, Making a confidant of them, deeming them worthy and just? What shall we say of the ingrates, thrusting such friendship aside? Turning, and rending, and spurning, the hand which had never denied The offer of cheerful assistance, and always met their's with a grip Which told them "I like you, I trust you," though never a word passed their lips. What shall we say of the ingrates, breaking the seals of such trust, Entering on holy of holies and trampling our God's in the dust; Who betrayed us for no "silver pieces," and with less than a Judas-excuse, And lending their lips unto slander, loaded our hearth with abuse? Thus we will judge, them, and leave them to the taunts of their soul in the night; Judge them as cowards--like children, who whimper in darkness for light; To the ghosts of their evil devices; the envies and hates which they nursed Will mock them one day in their loneless, by them let the ingrates be cursed.
