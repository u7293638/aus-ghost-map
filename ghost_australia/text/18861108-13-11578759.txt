VICTORIA RACING CLUB SPRING MEETING. STEEPLECHASE DAY. Steeplechase Day has a popularity peculiar to itself. It follows the quiet enjoyment of the Oaks Day with a spice of excitement that makes it attractive. The field of horses facing the stiff fences of the course, and the skill and daring of the riders, contribute elements of personal risk entirely to the taste of the ardent lover of racing In addition, Steeplechase Day brings the Cup festivities to a close, and it therefore permits of a final plunge into the whirl of dissipation before the resumption of the routine of everyday life Moreover, backers who, technically speaking, are deep in the mire, seek for a recovery by heavy watering on this day, but the way in which outsiders turned up in several of the principal events on Saturday must have been deeply disastrous to such persons, in common with the public Followers of racing agree almost unanimously that the safest course to pursue in regard to any steeplechase is to "take the field, and the truth of the proverb, " Ubefield is a very good horse, was again exemplified by the result of Saturday s race The general sigh of disappointment uttered when Game fell told its tale as plainly as the " hurrah " shouted by the man who cared neither for the safety of the horse nor of the rider, so long as the downfall of the favourite secured him from loss. The victory of Trident in the Canterbury Plate in some measure recouped a portion of the public their losses, but his was not an equally severe blow to the very large number of persons who had backed Trenton The way in which the race was fought out to the bitter end, and the punishment inflicted on Trenton, were proofs, if any were needed, that more than ordinary consequences were involved in his defeat Again, the Free Handicap gave the public another taste of misfortune which must not have been at all palatable. The race was the last of the day, and therefore was made the occasion for a large amount of wagering Lord Vv Ilton was installed as the favourite, but Hogmansy's victory inflicted another reverse on the public The attendance at Saturday's meeting was again large, and when the steeplechase was run there must have been full) 25,000 persons on the course A great proportion of the visitors arrived by rail, every provision having been made by the Railway Commissioners to secure their transit to Flemington with comfort The train service was ample, and the arrangements for dealing with the traffic were as complete as on either Derby) or Cup Day Except at the close of the days racing no crush was observable, and even then the trains were despatched from the Dlatforma so quickly that an absolute block was rendered traps Bible. The grand stand was filled, and there was an equally large attendance on the hill, while the flat was also well patronised. His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by Lady Loch, Lord and Lady Carrington, and Sir William Dobinson and their respective suites, reached the course shortly before I o'clock The party were received by the members of the committee of the Victoria Racing Club, the Australian Military Band, under Signor Zelman, playing the National Anthem as they were being conducted to their seats The weather, though favourable to racing, was not quite so agreeable as on Oaks Day The grandstand provided an agreeable resort from the warmth of the sun's rays, and many of the visitors were content to remain within its shelter during the greater part of the afternoon The lawn at times was, however, well covered. The dresses worn were mostly subdued in colour, and thus presented none of the contrasts in hue observable on Cup Day The wind freshened towards the middle of the afternoon, and at times the fields of horses were hardly discernible through the clouds of dust which enveloped them The day's racing, however, as a whole, was decidedly successful, and was a fitting termination to the racing carnival of 1886 TUX, RACING Like most weight for age events at the close of a meeting, the Mares' Produce Stakes brought a small field to the post, and though a contest between three it was set down in general estimation as a walkover for Volcano, who was ridden by ladies The brown son of Chester looked much better than when beaten by Madrlelina for the Caulfield Guineas, and BO confident were backers that neither Lord William nor Menotti could make him gallop that odds of 3 to 4 were freely laid on him The race was never more easily won, for Hales took his colt to the front at once, and, keeping him well in band, was clear of the others all the way, Volcano finishing just as strongly as he commenced Although the produce stakes are of great interest to both owners and breeders, this particular cent have lately had little interest for the general public. As a rule the beat three year "Ids, should there be several of fairly equal merit, are reserved for the Canterbury Plate, and a held of moderate horace contest this event, as for example last year, when only four started, Remus winning As a race refer the second division of three year olds it would have a special interest but for the fact that the three year old racing at Randwick, Hawkesbury Caulfield, and on the earlier day of the VRC meeting has pretty well settled the merits of even the moderate three year olds before this event is run, and the result on S Saturday, us far as this particular race was concerned, was a held of three out of the annual list of 194 There were 40 two year olds on the card for the Flemington Stakes, and exactly half the number were brought out. The performances of the filly Hortense had been of such an exceptional character that the handicapper paid her the compliment of get ting her over lost to carry-a weight seldom inflicted on two year olds as the result of their spring victories Mr Barnard is evidently of opinion that Hortense is in a class by her self as compared with any other youngster Keep out this spring, and the public are very largely with him in this belief Mr Macdonald, however, was not inclined to ask too much from his v victorious hill, and he was probably right in concluding not to start her for this event, in which she was asked to move at least one of the competitors no less than 14st Leaving out of the question the Normanby Stakes on New Years Day, there are in the autumn meeting of the V RC several rich prizes for two year olds, and with her prospects in the Ascotvale and All aged stakes, it would be a pity to run the filly off but legs now that the handicap for the flemington butter was considered to be a good one was shown by the fact that backers held Oceiinu, Aberdeen, and Casuist in equal esteem, and in the face of the divided opinion the ring men fav e the comparatively good odds of 5 to 1 ngmnsteach of the trio Those who put their money on Casuist had, however, a good thing, for the black jacket and green cap worn by Damage darted away in front as soon as Mr Watson gave the signal, and although challenged in turn by several of the field CasuiBtwaa notoncetroubled, and raced to the post the easiest of winners Oceana, ridden by Robertson getting second while for the third place the judge could not separate Sumatra and Albert Loddon In the original issue of weights for the V H.C Handicap is horses appeared, with Isonomy at the top of the hat and the unfortunate silvermine next to him Although the latter was in the paddock he was not brought out for the race For some time before the race Brown and Konewasinprctt) constant demand, as a consequence of her creditable victory on the Oak s JJ is, but a run was made on Britisher, and from 3 to I at first offered his price was reduced to one _', leaving him when the bell ring for starting an equal favourite, with Brow n und Rose And but for bravo whose merits had been overlooked, the favourites would have had the finish to themselves The son of Grand Flaneur proved a friend to the ring in this clune, though but for the fact that Britisher was hit over the nose at the finish he would probably have passed his heel i at the post in front of the Sydney colt, No one was surprised to find the announcement ' protest promptly hoisted when the horses man to weigh a gallon the rider of Britisher Irvin" accused Campbell, who sits on the winner of hitting his head across the field with his whip but 1 finisher was struck near the finish there could be no doubt as ev erotic watching the tree saw the horse stop suddenly in the middle one fast run and throw up his head In further evidence of the fact the p m u red west across the horse s nostril which VVIIB slightly) bleed nee Irons The cut and he was kept in the weighing enclosure for inspection by the stewards 'I he st intendents of the rocks of the placed boats were however it ncoiillictivinnnturc, for while Campbell and Fallon were directly opposed in their st intendents Gough, the rider of Latin m I I once turned the balance. of testimony in favour of the winner by stating that he had accidentally struck Britisher when drawing the whip to his mare, and the protest was accordingly dismissed Britisher promises to run Silvermine very closely in the unenviable honour of filling second and third places. 'The great event of the day in popular estimation was the Steeplechase Contingent, Union, and Brown Eagle being the only three scratched, eight horses were left in a very fair field for a steeplechase Game, the winner of the Grand National, was a centre of attraction in the paddock, and the fine son of Panic looked [ bright and hard, though much finer than on either of the recent occasions of his appearance over a Melbourne course No pains had been spared in training to make him thoroughly fit for the exceptional feat he was now asked to perform and Corner, who rode him, was obliged to put a good deal of dead weight under the shade None of the great horses who during the last 20 years have won this race ever earned such a loud as was, now given to the Dowling forest jumper the heaviest weight previously, that of the grey Lone Hand from the same stable, being 8lb less than Game s impost Yet the horse was the firmest of favourites, the ring paying him the rare compliment of demanding a shade of odds rather than giving it. The constant old plodder Native, who was to be ridden by A Ferguson, was second best favourite, but had only the slightest call over Lady Ashton. Mr Pearson's mare has rarely looked better than she did on Saturday, and in place of the amateur who has several times ridden her so cleverly, M'Leod appeared in the saddle Amongst the others, most attention was given to Havelock and Curiosity 1 he Hunt Club Cup winner had evidently been spe emily prepared for the race, and those who were attracted by his remarkable colour must have noted his condition also A very wide interest apne used to be taken in the steeple chasers, more especially amongst the ladies, and there were more people in the paddock while the big horse s were being got ready than at any other period of the day The recent deliverance of an eminent 1 English authority on the subject of Australian jumping horses had given a special interest to the occasion Nearly all Austra- lians recognise in the steeplechase horse and rider superior types, audit was gratifying to find this opinion shared by experts from the home of steeplechasing Many people who have at first been dismayed by the measurements and distances of the historical Grand National course at Liverpool have wondered whether after all the height of an English needle is not measured by its tenderest topmost to gas, but the coping, of the stone walls at Flemington are as firm as their foundation, and there is nothing on the flat by the Saltwater River that a horse can go through If he fails to see over in one sense he certainly will in another Had unions said a year ago that a greater daring was required to race horses over these terrible harriers without easter or steadying than was necessary to win an ordinary steeplechase in England "Pendragon and a score of other authorities would have scorned the never non, and yet the writer just named has just borne special testimony to the appalling nature of the Flemington and Caulfield jumps The people in the paddock on Saturday seemed to recognise that they had held the valour of their horses and riders toocheuph, and were anxious to atone for the mistake by giving extra homage Unfortunately the race on this occasion was to be anything but a triumphal procession The first fence brought down Lady Carrington, and injured both mare and rider slightly, and at the back the field was further thinned by the fall of Moonlight M'Leod showed the way on Lady Ashton from the start, and when the six horses rattled in finest style over the big fences in front of the lawn there was great enthusiasm on the upper stand, which was packed almost as thickly as on Cup Day, the vice regal party amongst others viewing the race from this point Havelock fell in going up the river the second time, and the lost three fences reduced the race to a match Game, who had followed Lady Ashton closely for over two miles, and who, with all his weight, seemed able to go to the front when he pleased, made a mistake at the last fence but one, and the almost invincible green and white jacket, to the general regret, went down, while the tired in ickhfie and his rider rolled over almost alongside them Not even from the man,' was there any manifestation of feeling at the fall of the favourite Only three horses now stood up, and when Curiosity came down at the last lence, and remained lying under the jump the chapter of accidents was complete Uni j Lady Ashton and Native were left, and though both were unable to raise a gallop at the finish, the mare, who had never resigned the lead from the start, cantered home the winner Native, although not coming down in the race, had struck one of the fences sharply, and cut his off foreleg badly, the bone being exposed almost from the knee to the fetlock, and the wound had to be stitched up and Game not fallen it is certain that he would, with all his weight, have beaten the only two that finished, but Curiosity was going so well up to the time of his mishap at the last fence that, with it similar indulgence given him, he would have probably led all three to the post When the horse lay so long under the fence it was thought that he had broken his neck, but after a while everyone was pleased to notice M 'Gowan cantering down the straight, while Corrigan, on Game, followed close behind The crowd gathered about the fence at the sheds told that something was wrong there, and as Kain, the rider of Lady Carrington, who suffered from the shock of the fall, as well as injury to the throat, had to be driven to the casualty room, it was a long time before the ambulance waggon was taken to where Wickliffe and his rider Cree were being attended by the onlookers On being brought in it was evident from the fact that Cree suffered great pain whenever his legs were raised that some bones had been broken, and after being examined by the surgeons present, who are always assiduous in their attentions to any injured rider, it was found that the injuries were most serious, and as quickly as possible the unfortunate jockey was removed to the Melbourne Hospital There it was found that the pelvis bone was fractured, while the jagged edges of bone, being crushed inward by the weight of the horse as he fell upon CrcBj caused fearful lacerations and ruptures Early on sunday morning Mr 1 it-fgerold operated on the injured jockey in the hope of saving his life, but all the surgeons who have seen him entertain but faint hopes of his recovery A number of people called at the hospital yesterday to inquire after free, but they were not permitted to see him Attention was next absorbed in the Canterbury Plate, increased in distance to a three mile race. Last year Nordenfelt, a three year old, with hardly us brilliant a record as Trident, ran 1 renton toa neck, and though half a mile was added to the journey the fact that Trident had, at the A J C autumn meeting, shown himself a capable three mile horse, was held to enhance his chances, while, on the other hand, Trenton s performances in the Melbourne Cup and Royal park Stakes of this year, as compared with his record at the last spring meeting, showed him to be a better horse now than when he beat Nordenfelt The start saw Trenton the favourite with the odds of 5 to Ion, while the same price was quoted against Indent Two others were starting, but neither could have much to do with the issue Nemarluk was only being started to make a pace for her stable companion, and Cyclops, though he did run Matchlock to half a length in the Champion Race last autumn, was not likely to find the conditions so much in his favour now in the meeting between two such horses as Indent and Trenton vera fast course, everyone knew that the three mile record would be very nearly broken, and the duel between two great horses was as fine as could have been desired Tamarisk made the pace, as expected, while J Fenton, who seems to like lacing, pulled hard for the privilege of a rush with the leaders, For the first mile Robertson on Trenton was almost being back in the saddle, but though restrain life his horses eagerness he rode him very steadily With half the distance covered there was not much pulling required, for 'J amarisk had made the pace just as fast as Trident could desire it Up by the bridge the second time '1 tamarisk had gone as far as she could struggle with the land I have in every thing had gone just us Hales wished, and now intent was called upon to do his own running, and at a splendid pace the Derby winner streamed past Tamarisk though it was rather too soon for 1 reason to race, he must keep with his opponents, and Robertson took him close upon the heels of 'J trident The favourite was going so well near the sheds that his backers were not in the least uneasy When the two horses reached the straight almost together there was a period of intense excitement The jockeys gathered their energies for a supreme effort and as the favourite was the Instcilled upon there was-, shouting for 1 renton as the prince jacket was seen to close upon the blue A moment of doubt, then a counter cheer for Indent as the colt held his own 1 rpm the nail distance the weight told if tale on Trenton and Rules seemed to know that the fine is not Musi et was beaten almost as soon is the spectators rushed the hut In the last hundred yards Indent was eased md on sufferance I renton came within death this year" the distance by which the defeat of ventured last Slinn., wits revealed the true no J,--, b or e the record being it [erection of a second faster than the best time in the Champion Race made by Commotion and First long Both the horses and jockeys Were badly cheered us then came back to scale and so fast that they finished that CjcluiM mi 1 1 irascible were left far behind Although only a two horse race, the light between the weight for age champions of the span will be long remembered by those who saw it The seventy of the race was shown in the fact that Trenton's near side was fear fully torn with the spurs, and indeed it seemed that the horse had been pushed beyond the limits of necessity The meeting wound up as usual with the Free Handicap, and although there were T> horses on the card, only 13 of them were starters. Lord 'U Ilton was a strong favourite at 3 to J while a lot of money also went on Kitawa, and the backers of all three were disappointed for at the finish Ifnlcs on Romance came through the field and won easily The crack horse man thus wound up a good days work, having left home first three events Robert sons good riding was as usual, counterbalanced by his bad luck, and he had only the poor consolation of seconds as the reward of his efforts The following are details of the mucus - MARES PRODUCE RISES, Of 10 sovs each with 150 added For three year olds.
