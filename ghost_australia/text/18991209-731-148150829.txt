The Help that comes too late. It isn't the thing you do, dear. It's the thing you leave undone, That gives you a bit of a heartache At the setting of the sun, The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you did not eend, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way. The bit of heartsome counsel You were h-irried too much to say ; The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle winntDg tone, Which you had no time aod thought for With troubles of your own. Thoss little acts of kindness v^o easily out of mind, Those chances to be angelB Which we poor mortals find— They co ne in night aod silence, Each s«d reproaohful wraith, When hope is faint aod flagging And a chill has fallen on faith* For life i« all too short, dear. And sorrow is all too great To Buffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late ; And it isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the £hing you leave undone, Which gives you a bit of heartache At tho setting of the sun. — Mabuarec E. Sangsteb.
