Some. one brought the news op to Chovbaken Hall that Mr. Bunker had joined the committee of Sir Gobley Gander, a Tory candidate, and was annouoced to address a meet ing at Cranfield in the baronet's inte rest.' t ; ' I see it all now'3' exclaimed Mrs. Dix.

The day after this, Mr. Bunker's groom, and Mr, Dix's under-garderier got into . an i altercation on the road, and fought for [ten miiintea by the church dock, at the end of which time half the village came and joined in on one side or the other. In short, society in the Chor 4&ken; Division, from top to bottom,! got- into a state of heated bearings, the , heat culminating when Mr. Dix tookj proceedings [against a prominent sup porter of Sir Gobley Gander for| assault during a row at a Liberal j meeting, and Sir Gobley retorted by commencing an action against Dr.: Toms, of Cranfield, for a libel promul gated in a Radical handbill. It was a great relief to all peaceably disposed persons when at last polling-day arrived, and Sir Gobley X3*nder, in accordance with the general expectar tion, was returned by an overwhelming C gtr Gobley'accepted the result -with equanimity, as being no more than this dne. and prepared to rest upon his laurels. "Unhappily, he had yet to learn how many unsuspected snares aiwl.pitfallB lie. between the would-be Coanty Councillor, and the goal of his ainbition. It was a day or two after the elec tion that Sir Gobley took up his Times, ^an^,in the Jaw report of that journal read something which caused him to take a lengthy drive round the neigh ~borhood. An hour or itwo later he ^arrived at Mrs Bunker's. * I say, Bunker,' he said, ' this is a pretty business. I have been dri>ip^ round the country to look at our elec tion posters; and, So far as I can see from.tbose that ate not torn down, not one of them has got the printer's name and address on it. According to the rfepSHsihthe papers that is a serious offence.' ; . *1 am afraid .so,' replied Bunker; getting up and taking a book frpm the shelf. ' Let us look at the Act. Here we are: ' 47 and 48 Vict., c. 70] MunicijMtl Elections (Corrupt ?and .Illegal Practices) Act.' Let me '"seej ' Nanw and address of printer f od placards'—that must be it. ' Section 14.- 'Every bill, placard, or poster having reference to a municipal election' —and so on, and bo on,' and any person printing, publishing, or posting, or causing to be printed, published, or I posted'—and so on,—'shall* (this is the I important part), 'if he is a candidate, j be guilty of an illegul practice.' ' Well, and what does this mean f .inquired the baronet. ■ * Let's see what the Act says,' replied j Mr. Bunker, turning over the pages, i ' Punishment on conviction of illegal practices,' that is the passage, evidently, ' Section 7. A person guilty of illegal practice in reference to a municipal election shall be liable to a fine of not exceeding jSIOO, and be incapable during a period of five years from the date of conviction of being registered as an elector*or voting at any election,' &c.; 'Good heavens!' exclaimed Sir Gobley Gander. Dp you mean tosny that I . ' Can %e had up at the sessions and "fined jSl00—that's about'it/ said Mr. Bunker. ' And, by Gad, some of Due's people will do it, too, if they get the chance. You see, feeling has been so excited, that they would do anything to spite us.' ; *4Well, what i8 to be donef ^ '^ou 'must apply to the court for an indemnity,■ like the rest of them.! | There won't be any difficulty at present, I expect, dift it must be done at once. Let us go knd see your solicitor with out delay.* , . The two gentlemen went over to E Dulchester accordingly- that afternoon. Sir Gobley's solicitor informed . them that it would be nearly a fortnight before the mction could be heard, but he undertook to prepare the necessary af&dayitsand; notice«;at ;pncft fin3.fhe baronet returned home much easier iri his mind. Sis relief, however, -was somewhat shortlived. No sooner -were the-pre^ liminary steps tyken for the application to tbe Court, than Mr. Bunker came to the successful candidate with another ttnfortnriate disclosure. "■ ' lam sorry {to say/ h'esaid,* that I bay# just learped from Jackson ;that he misunderstood yoqr instructions, and paid two men halfna-crown apiece/for !can?assing in the Tipplehurat and Chorbaken districts. Unfortunately, the Act says that we miy only employ ifcwo paid men j and as yon know, we had two already.' 1 Hang the Act ]' exclaimed Sir Gobley. 'And what's the result of this?' ■ r . ' Wellifc seems to be ^illegal employ ment,' and illegal employment by a candidate is an illegal practise under section 17—penalty JE100.' * J ^Wo't know anything about section 17,' said the. baronet, help lessly. * Can't "I be whitewashed {or this at the same time as the other business?' * I fear not,' replied Bunker j * but we had better go over and consult your solicitor again.' They did so, and the solicitor con firmed Mr. Bunker's opinion that fresh ; proceedings were necessary in respect of this new offence. Fresh" proceedings were commenced accord ingiy,pindj^e result was soon seen in the^ shape of a notice to Sit-" ■Gtoblpy'sT solicitor that .the, jsecond' application to the court T^ouldfbe opposedby counsel on behalf of l)r. To»iis, of Cran field. The first - application, was granted fritfiouM^ur.. There jvere, in fact,1 tlWfe tfflBf 3®oun/yJ Coiin-: cillors in a similar predicament, and the member for the Chorbaken Division! was disposed of almost without notice.' But Sir Gobley naturally1 felt' ibrvofls about coming.before the. court again ra the following' vfeek, with his second: -application opposed. \- ' Hang that fellow.Toms !"he said to; Mr. Bunker, who by reason of his legal; knowledge, was now the baronet's principal confidant. ' This, , of- course, is ont"of^revenge for my luitertil action against him. Look here, Banker, I : wish you would go over to Toms and see if we can't , tome to some under* standing.' Mr. Bnnker readily complied. -The result of this mediation was that the libel action was dropped on the one side, and the opposition to the County Council motion on the other, but only on the terms of Sir Gobley Gander pay ing all costs. It was lucky that. the baronet- had thus bought off the opposition, for, even as it was, he did not get through' the court so easily - as on the last occasion. Mr. Justice Perkins, "the presiding judge, happened, unfor tunately, to have a wonderful memoTf for names, and at once spotted Sir Gobley Gander as having been up tin the same errand before. A 6er <on ferring together the Judges granted the application, but accompanied by a significant hint to Sir Gobley Gander's counsel: . -'Ton -had better tell your client,' saM Mr. Justice Perkins, biting the end of his pen, and casting a malicious glance at an imaginary individual,in the witness-bos, 'not to let it occur again. We can't go on granting indemnities for ever. If people come j forward as candidates at public elec tions they ought to learn the law.' Wi«h this admonition ringing in bis ears Sir "Gobley Gander returned* to Dnlcetshire. Scarcely had he reached ht»ne when Mr. Bunker was an nounced.^ With a rather long;face.the visitor handed to the baronet a letter SSJP Toms, of Cranfield, to ^he following extent:— deab Bunker,—After yonr kind ter in regard to Gander's action against felt it a sort of duty to warn you that certain other illegal practices have come to the knowledge of our party over here, and I know for a fact that some of onr people are about to go against Gander for penalties on acconnt of the hiring of the band which played ontside onr meeting at Yokelham. I hope that this hint (which please treat as strictly confidential) will "enable'Ganfler to obtain an indemnity from the.conrt in time ' *° P^Vent - farther inconvonience.—Yonri | truly, Gabriel Toms. ' Hiring band 1' exclaimed Sir Gob ley Gander. ' You don't mean to say that tfazt is illegal? ' I ara,sorry .to Bay that, after looking at Section Twelve—-——* 'Damn Section twelvef cried gthe baronet, with astonishing vehemence. 'Why, what on earth will "the Act permit, a fellow to dot You- will tell me next that X had no .business to address a meeting!' ; ° 'Well, the fact is, Sir .Gobley/ answered Bunker, with an ominous hesitation in his manner, ' that in con sequence of these discoveries - T have been looking into thematter, and I am not sure that we had any business to hold that meeting in the Forresters' Hall at Cranfield. I .find that at the back of the hall there is a door opening into a passage which communicates with a shed, from which there is another door leading into the kitchen of the King's Head. Now by sectiou sixteen——' - ' Oh, stop,-for Heaven'o sake!' Scried the baronet., /I don't want to hear any more about theconfopnded Act If you mean to say that the meeting ■was wrong too, just tell me what I am to do-—for I am blessed if I know!' We must go to the court again, I suppose,'said Bunker, rather deiectedlv ' What's the use,' after what the Judges said this morning! How can I go again next week—«nd with two offences this time?' BupktirW° 0411 but trf* resP°nded And try they did, but the baronet Even the application had .not been, opposed (a* ft waspon behalf ofvarious electors of the division, the court observed that they could not have consented to excuse a candidate f*»; have committed «mrv singleoffenoe that tlie Act contempla^l Itwasneceesary to let County Connl oilters 1cnow that the line must be drawn somewhere. The same evening Sir Gobley Gander was served with two summonses. 'Ah, I thought so! They are going to proceed against me for the penalties now, he said to Mr. Bunker, who had' come over to condole with him, iBan^er.toofc the documents, and glanced over them, giving vent to an exclamation of surprise as he did so to «T. Sir Gobley,* he ' thafc <*»■» summooseB are not in respect of the last offences. They refer to something «lse.'

I didn't .know that it was for that purpose. Then the second summons mention# 'rSection, twelve' and ' ribbons.' What does that mean ? Can it refer to the rosettes which your fellows wor6 pn the polling-iayj' * Don't ask me J* replied Sir Gobley, pioodiiy. *1 ana sick of the whole business.* ' Look here, Bunker,' he added, sifter a minute's silence. * I think, with all your legal knowledge, that yon might have kept me clear of this confounded mess. Bat the least you can do now is to get me out of it.' * My .dear sir, X wili do anything in oiy po wer/ replied Bunker; ' But what woald'you surestf. /Go and isee'these' devils,' said the baronet, 'and try if you can't square tbeni.' \- Bunker went. Hereturned twenty four hours later, f T have seen them,' he said. ' But Uiey. will only hear of staying -proceedings on one condition; and that is that you resign, and sup port Danbary Dix as candidate for the vacancy.' Sir Gobley groaned. < I .was afraid of that;' he said presently, * Look here, Bunker, ho w much am T liable Tor in. the way of ^.naltira nowT^:;M. J' " 'Let me see. There is the King's Head meeting—00; the Yokelham band —^100^ the-waggonette^T-iglOO ; our fello ws'fa vora—^100l! That makes four hundred altogether.' .' And "say j another four hundred behind,' observed the!baronetl *I have come to the conclusion, Bunker, that *f 1 a§rpfe the terms yon mention I shall get out of it cheaply. I shall resign, therefore, and if I ever .stand again, Heaven forgive me !' * * ' # if ■*. i Strange to bay, it Was Mr. Bunker himself who took the news of Sir Gobley Gander's resignation to Mr. Danbury Dix. He made at the same time a communication which surprised Mr. Dix even more than the appearance of his quondam friend at Cborbaken Hall. ; . 'You planned it, Bunker»' ex claimed Mr. Dix. «But what on earth was your ideal' 'I knew as well as every one else with his eyes open that you had not a ghost of a chance of beating Gander, with his enormous local influence. On the other hand, I knew that, if we could get Gander out of the way, you would have as good a chance as any body. Being aware at the iBame tithe that you were anxious to get in, I thought it was worth risking something 'My dear fellow, you arc awfully good. But still, T don't quite see how you i managed' —— Hush J Not eo loud J Xfc was not really difficult. When once I had gone over and..established myself in the confidence of the" fendsntes, it only needed a suggestion here and a angles tion there, and the things were done without anyone observing that I was connected with them. Then, of couree. I arranged with old Toms to workup the opposition when the illegal prac tices were brought to light.' ' But why not have given me a hint of all this f 'It would never have done. It nnght have led to our being had up for conspirarsy. I Vnew that in due couree j a word of explanation would make us friends again.' ' Friends!' exclaimed Mr. Dix. 'Why, I don't know how I am to thank jou.' ' I don't want thanks,' replied Bunker, ' I shall be amplv repaid i>y J^rS y^,^tn,rned as Liberal member for Chorbaken. And Bunker soon, had that satisfac tion, for such .was the impression created by Sir GobleyGander's ex periences of the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act, that Mr. Dix was elected without a contest.
