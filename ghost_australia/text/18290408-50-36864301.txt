LYRICS. ORIGINAL. EXTEMPORANEOUS EFFUSION. "On hearing of a recent appointment." Loquitur—magnificus homo. POOR B., the prime treasurer, gave up the ghost, In time to vacate for our brother, a post— Our brother, the Captain, so clever, so gallant; Adapted to fill, by his versatile talent, Each office of trust, and emolument here, From a knight of the staff, to a "chief engineer!" A chief engineer! then 'tis quite in his line, To spring,—as he now has effected,—"a mine!" But, can't the remove of this Proteus ex-captain Make a birth for some other "dear coz" to be clapp'd in? For, what of proconsular rule are the ends, But, like VERRES, to carve for ourself and our friends? Then, if gay Master De la (it needs not be won- der'd). Or, grave Ensign D--------, get the vacant "six hundred:" For, why should a good thing of profit, or place-- Me duce, escape our "illustrious race!" And, tho' not quite "PATRICIAN," I'll now be industrious, Make hay while the sun shines, and dub it, "il- lustrious." DECURIO.
