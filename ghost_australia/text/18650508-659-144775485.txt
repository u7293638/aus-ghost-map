ADELONG. (from our own correspondent.) Adelong, May 3rd. — The best news since my last notice is the long looked, for change in the weather, gloriously dispelling the lugubrious prognostication of many of our local Saxbys — setting the plough moving, and providing em nlnvmftnf. for mnnv xr--*/ ? — ? j ? I hear that the preliminary contract for the erection of the Catholic Church has been taken, and that in a few days a commencement will be made in that good work. It is indeed strange that the Wesleyan should have led the way so' long in providing a place of worship in this district, and that the denominations infinitely more numerous, should be so much in the rear. I hope the Episcopalians will profit by the lesson, and bestir themselves in the matter. Apropos of spiritual subjects, I am informed that the 'horrid shilling nobbier system' is about to give up the ghost, and thanks to Mr. Paul, one much more suited to the times inaugurated. I believe we are to drink as others do, for six pence. Our old Camp-street seems to have taken wings unto itself and flown to the township, a prediliction being shewn for that portion now designated the west end. That it may be diffi cult to recognise a likeness granted, but still there is something in a name. The Reefer machine has just completed the crushing of 49^ tons of stone for Messrs. Walton and Co.,' the prospectors a t Kimo — it yielded 106ozs. Sdwts. The shaft is now seventy-five feet deep, with a well defined reef, promising well for the fortunate claimholders.
