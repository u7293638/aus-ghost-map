THE DESERTED HOUSE IN MACQUARIE-ST. Than Syrian ruin, or that at the foot Of iEtna, this pile is forlorner ; In its crevices toadstools have taken strong root, And cockroaches crawl in each corner. No footstep is heard in those echoing halls Through which the wild breezes rush boldly ; But festering fungi have blackened the walls, And the stairs and the wainscots are mouldy. In the Chair where the Speaker used nightly to sit, And be bored by Jack Stewart the shameless, The loathsome bugs creep, and the nimble fleas flit, And vermin brood on that are nameless. No more do we hear the loud laugh and the jest, Where Dettman served nobblers out daily ; No more is the clamor for Hennessy's best Intermingled with " goaks " that go gaily. The pilgrim who halts now will listen in vain For the big, epithetic Buchanan ; His ear at the keyhole may ache for the strain Of Lloyd, or of Cummings, or Gannon. The orations of Lord, and the neatly- turned phrase Of Driver the epigrammatic, No longer are heard, or the thunders of praise From basement to lobby and attic. Where Hoskins dropt aitches, and bullied, and blared The rats are all frisky and feeding ; Where Weaver the House with inanities scared, The damp a thick mildew is breeding. In the darkns thereof is a shadowy sprite, But no one has courage to touch it ; Some say in a whisper, half-smothered by fright, 'Tis the ghost of Jeff Eagar's last budget. The spectres of aspirates dropped on the floor Troop, brushing the passers-by daunted ; And the wail of slain Grammar comes forth through the door, A sign that the building is haunted.
