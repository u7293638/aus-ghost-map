f* A Faded Rose, Btookupabookinatwiliglxtroom, . ;. . And from the leaves fell oat a red rose, ! \- Scentless and wither'd, in the dim grey gloom, WrappM with its tales ojE long: vanish'd woes. - Glowing with' beauty it once ioloom'd-f air, : ' - Stately and. proud, on a bending bough. \- Queen of the flowers in the summer air, Ah, what a wraith is left of it now! The room fades into an old garden fair, *j- ,, With winding alleys and leafy trees; , ? . ? ^Bsrfum'd breezes laden the slumbrous air, '; Andthe soft crooning of humming bees. '? if* Be true, my sweetheart,' a lover once said, ' For true am I as the sky above 1' But oh, he is gone, and the days are dead; There is naught left in the world to love ! The roses bloom fair on the red rose tree, In Bcented wreaths hang the twining vine, And the .ghost of a day Has come back to me, In the faint pale sheen of white moonshine. But ah ! What is this ? *Tis a vojce, a call ! And love has come back from days of yore. Love, with his beauty, with his tales, with all, But the rose said, ' He is here no more !' I awake from my dream in the dusk of day. With the faded rose in the twilight room, Dead as the past as the swallows own lay, And dark as my heart in its shrouded gloom. Fever for me will the red roses twine Around the tree in the sweet old way, Never the same droop the clusters of vine, For dead as this rose is my heart to-day.
