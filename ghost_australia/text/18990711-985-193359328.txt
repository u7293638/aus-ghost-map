Bocks that Ring. A Pennsylvania paper describes some veiy carious rocks that cover several acres at Pottstown. They have a ! metallic sound when struck with a hammer, and hence are called " Ring ing Rocks." During the first ' spring thunderstorms recently the night was quite dark. Persons passing the rocks were started to see a light bluish flame rise from the ground and spread over a space 10 or 12 yards square. This flame rose and fell after the manner of \\.the Northern lights, sometimes entirely disappearing and then flaming up again, lighting up the darkness around it. They stood and watched this mysteri ous light from a distance, and then went close to it to see what cause there was for it. Some old residents in that neighbourhood said they had seen the strange lights on nights during violent storms. They explained that the rocks were so metallic in formation that they attracted all the electricity in the atmosphere for miles around, and through some natural cause the electricity became luminous, like phos phorescent glow, that lit up likd the Northern lights. To some the fire looked like a flame rising up from the huge rocks whose cavernous depths be low have never been explored. These metallic or ringing rocks look as if they had been dumped into a vast lake and thoroughly filled it, so that the water entirely disappeared. Small pebbles dropped through the crevices of the rocks can be heard dropping from ledge to ledge until the sound is lost 50ffc. below. On some of the sur faces imprints of human feet or feet of beasts or birds can be seen, as if they had passed over the rocks when they were soft enough to receive an impression and then hardened and retained tbem. There was a story that a ghost that had emitted fire from its nostrils haunted the rocks, but scientific men deelare that the rocks are so highly charged with magnetism that any eleetric disturbance will cause the glow.
