" So much that I should likei t take it for the osummer," Paid the young Illn; " and my sister is also pleased with it. Who is the owner? " "The owner, sir, was a Mr. Wyndham, who used to live there, bhut died quite sudi denly i month ege on a visit to London. His executors are the persons to trent with. The affairs seem to have been left in some confu slon, but there is.no doubt you could have the house for the period you miention. "It looks the sort of pllacie that ought to have a story," said Liouis Lennox, while the agent wrote down the executors' names. "I never heard that it hand, sir; no ghosts or -anything of, that sort," said the agCelt, smiling. " Mr. Wyndlhan came into it un expectedly ashout two years ago, tlrough the death of a cousin-a very young lady, I be. lieve. But lie came frol another county, and her people did not live here, son I doi't know much about them. The place was al ways let till Mr. WYyndham took to living in it." . Br.

Nellie, coining in at the Uiolaent, asked what wlas the matter. " It sounded as ifsomeone called out,"said Iennox, looking perplexei. " I can't locate the sound, either." STime servantl are all out at-the back, and I've coome from the drawing-room," said Nellie. " It's faney." " I heard it soveral times, and then, as if things-heavy things-were being moved about..' " If you hear it at night it may be ghosts," said she, laughing. SleI helard it so continuously tha lie got nervous; it came from behlind the wall of the library, but tllere was no room there, as the outer wall of the house was not thick enough to conitain another apartment. But there wna no doubt a voice seemed to be coming out, ta iutllled cry, as if disttnce or some obstacle subdued it. What could it beo L unsnox declared hle could not tandl it, and au architect was called in to tap and sound the walls and gioe his opinion. "It's a human voice." said Lennox to lhis sister, " there's something uncanny about the place. I dream of t(lnt voice; 1 can't stop here if our search it baffled." Nellie did not laugh at hint. The architect discovered nothing, and thought Mlr. Lennox must have overstiudliced. " Nobody can be shueliot up there," staid Nellie, " yout can't imagine such ni absurd thing, Louis." " I don't imnagine anything, I hear sounds 1 can't necount for, wvhether they are human or not; anlld I mean to find them out if I pull downI the pinet for it."

Don't let him see me;" her eyes grew wild. Lennox smoothedl and re'-assured her, and pro iixed he or his sister would never leave her. " Somie devil's work here."hie thought, when the girl slept; is it possible that the cousin did not die as was thought, but was to be got out of the way by slow starvat.ion; per. hips this Wyndham would have her monney. And his death bas frustrated his vile design." tMutch of this was the store Nina told. She could not recall exactly how she had come to this house, but sh: was clear about her cousin's position; at her death hie came into possession of her propelrty. She had had some food, and no long a.s any strength remained to her, had eanselessly cried for help. Sometimes she had felt half mad, and thing the things anbuut in a frenzy. Her gratitude to iher resculers was speechless. The countryside rang with the story, but the only legal steps taken were to identify Nina Wyndbam; the would-bo murderer had escaped earthly justice. Nina recovered slowly. "You'll be tired of me,"sha said to Lenuox with unconscious wietfulness. " This.is your own house." he said, emil' ing; " you may he tired of Its,' " Ohi, nol hvow could I b e 1't " flow could I be 1" said Lennox, softly, taking a willing hand-" not even for a life time." " You're the beat right it me," Nina wlis pored, after a happy mtinute. " You saved my life; it ought to be yours." The undlerground room was lilled tlp." No one else shall ever stiffer as I did,"said Nina; and even in the eunshine of love and care bhe never could bear to recall that time.
