THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 18S7. After nil, tho amending Education Bill is to Lave a second reading dis cussion in the Assembly When a measure ought to bo debated before its details are dealt with timo is never gained by a rush, and in this instanco the net result of carrying tho second reading in an empty House after tho dinner hour 13 that a great deal of time has been wasted 'lhere has been much bickering, and at last a ícsolution to take second reading speeches on tho first clause had to be an ned at This is as it bhould be It will be possible for tho Government to form a general opinion of the views of tho people's lepresentatives on what is essentially a peoples question, and to amend the measuie accordingly 'lbo case for religious teaching by tho state was temperately put forward yestotday by Mr Andhews and Mr Andehsov (Villiers and Heytesbuiy), and their ploas will demand a temperato answer Of course both gentlemen approve of tho clause in the bill allow mg teachers to »ive religious instruction m schools other thin their own, and not only that, but they would go further, and allow tho teacher to give instruction in his own school And tins is whore the objection to tho clause comes in The concession is ve.} much of a sham as it stands, aud it would soon come to bo described as a sham and tho reality would bo demanded of allowing the teacher to act m his own behool And ouco that boon is granted, it is tolerably coi tain that the deuomi national bodies would clamour-and properly clamour-against tho stato behool supplying tho religious needs of tho district the ono 3 ear and abruptlj abandoning

allowed Educ. tionahsts would boldly say that even if the private schools were inferior to the state schools their existenco would be valuable as breaking the fatal Chinese monotony of the state system, but there is no need to talo this extreme position One and all of our private schools are perfoiming good woik, the schools established by the Roman Catholic clergy included There are practi call) no fiaudulcnt establishments con ducted in order to enable parents to evade tlie prowsions of the Education Act An} idea that such schools abound so as to require special lectslation is probably a crea tion of the Mmistei s brain, and is not to bo accepted without positive and conclusive pi oof lhe private schools might very well bo left alone, but if there is to bo interference, the state should content itself with seeing that education is given in good faith, and that the children attend with toler able reiiulaiity, and should not attempt to foi ce a tiuaut into the state school, nor yet attompt to force the state sys tem on the private establishments What the bill should grapple with, and what it fails to touch, is the failure of the boards 01 advice to take any position in our educational system It muht be confessed that these bodies have little weight in the community, and even if their poweis were enlarged, it may be doubted whether they would be a success as they aro at present constituted Podies with limited special functions SLldom aro either powerful or populai They become the resort of specialists and of men w ith ewes, who aro usually moie or less self elected The question suggests itself whether a valuable piacticil reform would not be effected if each munici pal council weio undo the boaid of advice for its own district, inas much as then parents would know to whom to apply, aud when difficulties arose, or drawbacks had to bo removed, the council could act with authority It could not bo snubbed and set aside by the department, as Mr Andirsov, Mr Whllllr, and Mr Andklws seem to agree that local boai ds are snubbed to da} School business would be trans acted every week or every fortnight in public and publicity means stiength lhe functions which tho boards of advico are supposed to discharge, are just those which a municipal council can perform and the chano0 fiom an unknown group of citizons to a popular public body, might bring this dead part of the sjstem into life at once And if we ever are to localise our school sjstem-as some day it should be localised-it would seem that this is I the wa) to make a beginning The protracted inquiry into the cir- cumstances surrounding the death of Miss Laura Swain has at length come to an end. As the event excited public interest in a very marked degree, and as it presented some mysterious points which urgently required explanation, there was every reason for making the investigation complete and thorough. It is probable, indeed, that every person who was near the Vic- toria street Bridge about the time of the occurrence has been brought forward to give evidonce. But while there has been a laudable desire to produce all the available evidence, we must strongly protest that in the conduct of the inquiry aud the examination of the wit- nesses zeal has outrun discretion. Any reader can see that a mass of irrelevant evidence has been allowed, which could serve no purpose but to tickle the ears of the peculiar groundlings who, having apparently nothing else to do, gratify a prurient curiosity by haunting the coroners court. Question after question was put and permitted that could not possibly affect an inquiry into the cause of death, and that was not used in the final statement of the case either by counsel or the coroner. It was the duty of the Court to find out what happened on the Victoria street Bridge at a particular time, the Court has apparently been trying to discover what occurred elsewhere and at other times, even when this could throw no light on the event. The coroner virtualy allowed everything that Mr. Smyth chose to urge. He, indeed, con- sulted the jury , but no jury in the world could undertake to dictate what evidence should be received If a jury- man were to object to any testimony, he would be sneered at, as was one of the jury at the inquest, who took ex- ception to some questions, and it would be insinuated by most barristers that he had reached a judgement on the case prematurely. It is for the judge-and the coroner is a judge- to decide on this point, and Mr Daly has evidently yet to learn the requirements of his position But the admission of unnecessary evidence would not have called for notice if there had been nothing worse. The coroner was appointed to hold an inquiry into the cause of a violent death, and Mr Smyth to arrange the evidence. Yet, for some reason, they both began by a most unwarrantable attack on Dr NIELD, who made the post mortem examination. It surely must be known to two experienced men, who assume an attitudoe of impartiality that Dr Neild kept strictly to the line of his duty. It was none of his business to write a disquisition, good or bad, on Miss Swains character. He had only to certify to the cause of death, refer- ring to any marks on the body that might be connected with this one point, and when he had given in a correct report as he appears to have done, it was the duty of the coroner to decide whether he should be questioned futther. Supposing their was a case in which a woman undoubtedly committed suicide, in which there was no occasion for an inquiry. What jus- tification would a medical man have for publishing prurient details about her previous life. By so doing' he would only give pain to her relatives, and please the wretched taste of a morbid crowd. Dr Nield followed the wholesome rule of medical practice, and held himself ready to give further evidence if it were required. To furnish gratuitously, and it might be unnecessarily, such evidence as the coroner and Mr Smyth demanded would only lead to demoralisation among the curious public. It is impossible on seeing his method of handling witnesses to resist the in- ference that at a very early stage of the investigation Mr.Smyth had formed a definite theory of the case. On finding the discrepencies be- tween the statements of Captain Moore and FLYNN and on discovering a wit- ness who thought that the screams first came from the bank-a point on which it would be difficult for a man at a dis tance to judge with certainty-he appa rentlv made up his mind that the case ought to be tried before a higher Court Every witness whose evidence conflicted with the theory, was treated virtually as a hostile witness. The young man Camp- bell, who believed that the splash could only have been caused by a body falling from the bridge was subjected to an examination evidently intended to throw doubt upon his word. The discrepancies in Captain Moore's statements and the differences be- tween them and the accounts of Flynn and Molloy were magnified, while an effort was made to shake all the other evidence. Now, this may be the duty of a Crown prosecutor, but it is certainly not the recognised method of conducting an inquest. An inquest, as the derivation of the word shows, is simply an in- quiry and it should be so held with the view of bringing out all the facts, that no party requires to be specially represented by counsel. This inquest, however, has been a regular trial. The Crown prosecutor treated Cap tain Moore, as a man accused of some crime, and for this reason would have declined to put him into the box. Yet Captain Moore was the last man who saw Miss Swain alive, and what testimony he had to give was essential. If he had refused to answer questions the responsibility would have rested with himself, but Mr Smyth had cer- tainly no right to assume that he was a culprit. The coroner seems also to have been influenced unwarrantably in the same direction. Captain Moore was cross examined apparently with the one object of establishing a pre conceived theory , and Mr Coldham, who ob- jected, was peremptorily silenced. What special value, for instance, was there in Captain Moore's opinion as to whether Miss Swain's clothes would be thoroughly soaked with water by a fall from the bridge. Such questions could only prove that the inquiry was made to tend towards a pre supposed point. The jury have been wiser than their guides. They have returned a clear verdict on the plain facts elicited by the examination. They have disbe- lieved Captain Moores statement, partly, no doubt, because it is thoroughly irreconcilable with the evidence as to a quarrel between him and Miss Swain, partly because it does not account for the time spent at the bridge, and partly because it discloses no motive for suicide Miss Swain certainly did not go to the bridge with the intention of dramatically ending her own life, and nothing in Captain Moore's version gives the slightest reason for such a sudden resolution. On the other hand no proof either of murder, suicide, or acci- dent has been advanced by the wit- nesses, who heard or saw nothing of the affair until Miss Swain was scream- ing in the water. The verdict is open and logical, though it still leaves the mystery unexplained. But one thing is clear, namely, that the censure on Captain Moore and Flynn is thoroughly well deserved. Whether the former was injured or not, he was at least strong enough to enter the water, and mere humanity or the excitement of the moment, if not any love for his affianced bride, might have moved a practised swimmer to attempt to save her life. It is almost incredible, it is altogether unintelligible and it is super- latively disgraceful, that a girl could have perished within a few feet of the bank of a river on which stood two men who could swim, without the slightest eflort being made to rescue her We publish to day a doleful and lamentable tale of the sea, almost as thrilling as that of the General rant, which was wrecked about twenty years ago on the same group of rocks that has now proved fatal to the Derry Castle. The too frequent marine disasters on our coasts, however cala- mitous they may be, involve no con- tinued privation to the survivors, after the shock mid struggle and exhaustion of the event. In the pre- sent instance, however, eight hapless human beings were in a position far removed from any possible succour or sympathv, and destitute of the materials for making their life even rudely com- fortable. Cast on a rocky and incle- ment island, they were exposed to con- stant rain and piercing winds, without tools, without food save what, like the primitive hunters of the race, they could catch and animated wholly by the inextinguishable hope of rescue. The labour required to keep the little forced settlement in existence seems alone to have enabled them to face the inevitable hardships. They had to provide them selves with food from the seals, they had to find a rough shelter from the blast, and they had to build a punt, so that they could leave the islet on which they were thrown. In this shaky craft they succeeded in reaching the main island of the Auckland group, whoere there was fortunately a Government depot, and where their struggle for life assumed a more hopeful phase The Derry Castle left Geelong in March last with a full cargo, a crew of 22 men, and one passenger. On the 19th of the month they were to the south of the Now /ealaud coast and as thoy had passed what are suggestively called tho Snares, tho captain seems to luvo imagined that tho unbroken stretch of tho Pacific Ocean lay before lum Ihoio was tho ftesh wind which the sailor loves in tho onen seo, and the blup earned a considerable press of canvas lu tho muidlo of the night, and when tiavelling at
