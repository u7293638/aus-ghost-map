SATURDAY, AUGUST 10, 1835. he more the results of the general election in the United Kingdom are considered the clearer it becomes that the causes of the crushing defeat of the heterogeneous party led by Lord Jvosi Bl i Y and Sn Wiri i vii Ilvitcouiu must be widespread and deep sorted the success of the linen tea was not confined to any part of Great Britain or any particular class of a constituent less an examination of the returns shows that in J 50 and the net Unionist gains in the boroughs and I counties are, nearly the same being 39 and 37 respectively, the proportion being slightly greater in the romance, which have 226 members-, than in the latter, which are represented by -Mr But while the Unionists us in the previous general elections since the Reform Bill of 1884 mo strongest in the boroughs, it is noteworthy that at the recent elections, although the Jvoso Services gained nine seats in the towns they captured only four from their opponents in the counties In Wales where at the elections in 1912 the Unionists could secure only two seats out of thirty thus have "saved six seats including the important towns of Cardiff and Swansea The reaction in Scotland is still more remarkable At the general election in Ih'JJ the 61 Estonians secured fifty seats and the Unionists twenty two In the campaign just closed the Unionists gained eighteen seats in cluding two in Glasgow, and the liosebeiyites hay the net Unionist gain being thirteen, winch reckoning two seats won by the Unionists at let out by e elections makes the total tim by eight against their opponents thirty of In other words the Unionists instead of being in a minority of twenty eight have a majority of four Jmlauil is the only part of the United Kingdom where the Unionists failed to gain ground I hp Nationalists Imp 111 feel, won two seat-- but against this may be set the fact that the Parnellites who are if anything more I your able to the Conservative than to the Liberal party have in creased their number from nine to twelve In endeavouring to assign the causes of the Unionist success it must 1 obey me in mind that for some time before the general election the tide had detily boon (lowing against the laosebciyttes This is shown by the recent bye- elections at which the Unionists gained half a dozen seats, and were gaming at such a late that it looked as though in a few more months Lord Jlosi Duty s majority would have disappeared altogether It can hardly, therefore be said that J and S vi issuing a programme of soil ml reform was solar) spots sible for the loss of the Jlndteals, though it had been for bottle time just foreseen that such a programme would be ml opt ed by the Conservatives The downfall of the old liberal party) is often attributed to the withdrawal of Mr Gr UISIOM and the want of a lentil 1 lil 0 him of commanding personality, but this explanation is obviously inadequate The do cadence of the party set III while Mr. G visitors was an active Render, though on his retirement it proceeded with accelerated rapidity) to better in roof of this could be alloted than his fail! to obtain a satisfactory majority III 1892 Besides, behind this stone lies the further question, how is it that the party which was led by Mr G VDSIOM lot 11 quarter of a century in so devoid of men capable of leadership 1 One and perhaps the chief reason seems to be that the classes who in the past furnished tim Liberals with their ablest men have gone over almost bodily, not exactly to the Conservatives, but to the party opposed to revolutionary innovations and the disintegration of the empire It is not so very many years since the Conservatives were described as the stupid party" Law will admit that the epithet is applicable to them now, when they include in their tanks such men as Lord SALISBURY, Jill 13 viz our, Sn Micirur He has He well, Lord Go one! H Mine, and son Envv van Civniu, and have only lately lost Lord Jivv won in G'nureiirLL For some time after the Peohtcs sepal read from the Conservatives and cast in their lot with the liberals the party led by Mr J)ISHVMI suffered seriously from want of able debaters and administrators, while the Liberals were strengthened by the adhesion of the seceders among whom was no less a man than Mr G VDalOM The first Cabinet formed by Jjoid Up RHY in 1862 was dubbed the 'Who? Who a Ministry," because the Duke of We ITIVGION, to whom the Prime Minister was tell- ing the names of his intended colleagues, and who was rather deaf, was heard to exclaim in surprise, as each obscure name was mentioned to him, "Mho? Who?' 'the long supremacy of Lord Pu Ml RSIOV helped to perpetuate this state of things as i many rising young politicians of Con I servative tendencies found no difficulty in joining a party led by a Liberals whose chief object seemed to both keep things as they were and stave off all i troublesome reforms It was some years before the House natives were able to find in their own i thinks men like Lord CuvMioitNi (now Marquis of Svnsiiuiv), the Earl of CARNARVON ' Lord Siusriv (afterwards Dill of Dating), and Lord CAIRNS, who as speaker-. and administer store could hold their own with any on the other side I the present situation is in some respects strikingly similar to that of forty years ago As the Conservative party was then weakened by the loss of the J'eehtes, so now the Jjibctiili punt) is suffering from the secession of the Liberal Unionists J hope tion of Mr Cn VMIII RI ON, WHO after some years of hesitation lins joined a Ministry in which the Conservatives preponderate, is not! unlike that of Mr G UISIONI who, after a similar period of indecision I finally threw in his lot with the i Liberals As to the Consul votives suffered a long eclipse after the dis ' eruption of then party under PI n, so it may be suspected the Gladstonian.
