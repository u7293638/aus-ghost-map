Under the t;:i& cl the GI;os t of Deadman's Isle, this extraordinary chronicle wili be told. On tbe 13;h ct Al^rcb, l-SIO, s£ the Lred'e assizes, s man, who gave his cstrss sr li-jfcsri - Penlotd, and his age as thiriy-Sre, wss charged wish inciting & mutiny c-a the l igh. i Eeas. 5s had been an able seaman, and j possessed gre-i in£aence over his ship- 1 makes.

Tiie ! . captain was a bonneeabie r-nc fchea^h ; be was smassinga for{3oe by his ifacit piac- ! t:c^s, the seamen, who rE.n mc=t risk, got j little for iheir trouble. ] Penfold wse particn.srly obnciioaB to the j e tipper, but as he was able to res a e,b i write ? (qaaliScations net to be despised in the he- ' ginning c£ the cectcry), and was z'so a good j BQUB&n;, -Captain Tremayne cssd hixn in his various tranEaciions, and concealed his diflifce. The men were nc lovers oi the captain, and at Ises they decided so pst him ashore on s return voyage and run sway with the lugger. Penfold to foe lesder. Tre»chery discovered the plot to Tremayne, and he speedily denounced Penfold Us the authorities. By a jscisioas system of pre sents to in3aentiai perp'e Excnnd Ilui*. the captain had for years sccceeced ia qiicjly j carrying oa his emcgclicg operatioss, una j this inSuecce stood him m geed ceed ween I ihe trial 'cf Penfold came c£f. The wiiy j e kipper had poi most of the crew oa hi= eide. | by insisting that i'safoid slons vss re- s saonEible fcr the i&iectkd; ESiity, and 1 three of them gsve eTidencs against his. j The refuls o! the trial wes that the sailer - sentericed to transportation to Tan Diz~-sn's !

In j the beginning cf 1SI1 be reached B'-eion (Hobart Town afterwards), and sisriei his hopeless seivitcde. j For a weary eighteen years he worked ia j misery at the ccnric; Beitlesaent. Vc; cn the ] morning of the £2aa or April, he was 1 fonsd to fee missing. No ci-e i;ad 54: c j eiighJest idea of how he escaped, bnt ] treachery wsb taspected. as, withcu: help ' from an ofiieial, is wae impossible thst the ' lifer ceuld Lave get awcy in so mysrerioif= a manner. The gaci employees were most | carelcllj eiamiiied, bGt no 'b:ame could be brocght home to them. i The aeasl routine cf thepecal siaiion had beea slightly disturbed a weekprevioct'y, by ihe arrival of a convict ch:p with a Isrge namber of tranqjcrteer, and this fse; mnst have aided Penfoid in his e^sepe. The neoal perfanetory eeerch was made for him, b^t withoat enocees, ana e= time rolled on snd he - did &ot; resurn to Hobart Tcwc. it wae generally concluded that he had perished in the inhospitable foreets, in which he would esek shelter from his parsaers. Same few persons thought that P-rsfo'd might have escaped by sea in a friendly whaler, bst, dead : or alive, he was not again £&£z £t Hobsrt Town, and he was gradcaUy forcotisn, and another felon took his number. The growing popalaticn cf free people in Hobsrt Town saggested the necessity oi re moving the convict prison, End Governor Arthur, shortly after the escape of P enfold, j . Mok efeps to dc eo, selecting Tasman'e PininEuis as the most enit&ble; place to erect the new gaol of Port Arthur. The cDsstnie tioa of sieh an extensive prison occspied a considerable time, bat at the end cf 1S33 it was ready for occupation, and hencJ»forwsxd wae the great can vies centre cf Van Uiemac'a. Ii»nd. The mortality amoegst the prKcner? from crdiSsry gj'cknecE was vrry high, scd with the cxecaticns ana the ordinary death rate of the gaarde, the cemelery of Bi&dmsy;'s Isle was epeediiy pet into me. The islet had been frequently visited by fcxeareioniste from Hobart Town snd others, bo that the prison Entbarities regarded it as a o § source that it should cot appear as an uninhabited island. Almost daily the prison oScials visited ihe place, and the establishment of the gaol on the peninsula had the effect cf bringing & greatly increased passenger traffic to Port Arthnr. A daily service between it1 and Hobart Town was insulated, bnt new that the lovely islet had beer: est apart for burial purposes few pssens landed on it, sslsse they had basin ees to perform.

This *13 the mssi exposed p&zt;, and the onceafiing &cticti; of tbe ocean had worn the clifis into etrsnge and fantastic shapes.

'To that time when the Bible says * ' there were giants in those days,' far lis sppsared to them as the Brobdignsg did to Gallivir^ . This mast be a haman monster they luind co. for it was. at ie3£t, thirty fee* high, and gieansie in proportion. HeSernan was as breve ss most men— indeed, braver than mast, for he was considered the dare-devil of his regirng-t — bat this colossal apparition altogether nnnervsd him. For the life of him hecc-iid cot take hie eyes away from the figore, bat as he *»i3 the soldiers looked it seemed grscasliy to become fainter and fainter, and &' last ii vanished completely. ?' ilercilui God,' said the corporal, as he wiped the perspiration from his face^ ' that was nothing mortaL I oculd see the stars eh in ing tb rough it; body.' ' So did I. Hsdn't we better get hcek. I'm cot St to work to-night,' answered a soldier. They were all cf the same mind in that respect, for an Irishman is peculiarly sus ceptible to superstitions fear. He will chaige a b*.it£ry of artiilery. or traverse wild and enksown regions, bat ask him to stay a night in £ haunted house, and he will refuse in jerrcr. Kiffemsn and his comrades, with many a frightened glance backward, soon reached their boat, and were speedily at the gaol* where they told of their Etrange adven ture. Ksit morning they accompanied the superintendent to the epot where they had seen the apparition, bat there was not the ice-t sign to show that either a material or an etherial body bad been there. In fact, if Htil?rasn had observed what he stated, it niust have been a phsatom, for no human being could have stood in snch a place, as it j was simply 3 precipice where two cliffs bad been rear, er worn in twain. Toe soldiers were b&dij; rallied by their j comrades 03 iheir faculty of second eight, j but all the jokes they listened to did nol ! shake iheir h=ii-f that a ghost had shown it sell to them. Eight days afterwards their story received a strong corroboration, which caused the authorities to take steps to eluci date the mystery. Oa the I3:h of September, Lieutenant French, with two other sub-officers, -went ggi in a boat from Port Arthur to £sh. The sicemoan was remarkably fine, and as they met with lock, they did not take notice of tbe Sight of lime. It was after midnight as ifcey rowed into Port Arthur, end as they fiosied under the shadow 'oi Dsadman's lab they decided to 'make a night of it.' by continoicg their piscatory pursuit. They stopped aimoss under tbe shadow of the s&uUi-esstern; cliSs, and continued their fish ing. The moon had only risen half -an -hour ptrviously, but it was already throwing & soft light s round. The night was unusually - calm, snd the ees seemed pb OEpherised by the myriads ef fish which were darting about. Lieutenant French was looking, in a sleepy way, as the sbsfis of greenish light thsE the no traa oi the fi-ih produced, when, hsppesieg tG raise his eyes to the tinted ciiiif, he wae e tarried to eee the gigantic fig ere thai fc&e; eo frightened Corporal Hef feman and his coirpanions eight days before. It-srac undoubtealy the form of a man, bat unottiably net material, fcr objects cculd be seen dearly through it. The thr^e uScers Jocked at it in bewildered wondsnnenx, and each sa w it distinctly, eo ihst it ccu!d net be the result of disordered imsgisstiea. French, tficcgh awestrack, was not raper etiticue, &n-3;, whupering to his companions, he se:z;-i sn cEr, and pulled towards the cull to obtain a batter view. The figure re m&m;&d; meiicniese as they approached, and i the lt£ut£i22iit ras able to see that a long beard fell from its chin. The dress, as well i as he could jadge. was the same as that worn | by the ordinary Eeitlers, and the ghost did ! not appear — If these outward signs might be [ depended oa — to be that of & convict. In lacs, the appearance — with long, sp : parently while, beard, and peculiar-looking I clothing— might well have passed as s j gigantic Brnid priest ; and tha surrounding caves and chasms and awe-striking prwipjpeg I would have been a fitting dwelling-place for t exponents cf that most cruel and mysterious j creed thai was once the great n»Knn«i ley„ j g'62 ol the Ancient Britons ; and the colossal j £gcrs womd have been a splendid specimen [ ci one of their hlgnest high priests in ?»« ! robes cf efke. As the c facers looked, with strained eyee, I tbe phantom gradually receded, and venieL^d | sb it had previously done. I ''There is some^ myEteiy here,' spoke | French, in a low v5ice. ' I don't believe in i ghosts, yet that figure most be supernatural. I suppose we wili be laughed at, the es i HeSernan and his fellows have been, when j we sell what we have seen, bet the three of 1 cs coald not be mistaken, and I will make a : full report of it to the superintendent as soon as we land.' ; ®* What csn ii be?' asked one of his com I pacions, with a slight shiver. ' Ever einoe | I came to this cursed land 1 have been seeing and hearing enough to make a man's blood , run ecld. i.'s bad encngh to be attending cacgusgs aad floggings nearly every day, bat this supernatural mystery is worse than ten years of that work.' 'I think we ought to make for the settle ment/' replied the third officer. ' If we stay here, we may have a return of oar unwelcome visitant.' ' This was readily agreed to, and within haif-an-IiGur they were admitted to the outer prison-; sr;3, -nrbera they saw Corporal Hef iernan on duty. They acquainted that personage of the incident that had befallen them, and then the soldier broke the grave silence with the following sage obeerva tion : 'GenUemsn, it's & ghost, sure aioogb.
