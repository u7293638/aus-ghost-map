Zoet's Corner. A COMMON TALK. Thkv said that he must .lie, aud ji;isse-l away WliisjiiTitigij-, pitj 'iugly. How little tlioy AH kmsr. for lie wm glad to die— so glad ; Life hud boon very weary to him, and, so sad; Like a waste garden full of withered blooms ; Like a Bad churchyard, fall of graves and toml»8 ; Dead flovrcrs of hopes that bloomed bright and fair ; Sad graves of those that once life's peopl'ing were. Like fairy ships o'er fancy's ocean Beut l'V-r precious cMgo, once his bright dreams vent Out o'er life's uusailed sea, and some no more Were heard of ; some as empty as before Came hack, aud some -oh deep and bitter pain !J With haunting ghosts all filled, came back ?again, Their decks bestrevru with broken hope and aim, To be relaunched never — buck they came ! Aud skeletons of love and friendship shook Their bony fingers from those decks, aud took from his robbed soul sweet hope and trust fore'er. Leaving him desolate ; and life so bare, So void of aim, o{ faith in anything. Why should he launch more dream-ships? Could they bring Back trust to soal ? love-balm to heart love sore? ? ?????? Though gay the mask of nature frank be wore. He held his fellow man his hidden foe E'ermore. Life teemed so long and Death so slow. (He always lingers when one beckons— like A wilful child— like him is quick to strike Who co were from him.) Death had come at last, And rest ; life's ?weary day was past. **♦«*.. His story but the tale of each that feels More than the common life each day reveals. G. II. V. K. ?'Mayrille,' Temora.
