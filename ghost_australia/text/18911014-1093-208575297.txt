A face well known once,' in another day ?" Then on the air these words grew audible- :< "Thesame she is who scorched thine eyes -with tears,.. .. . . ., . I But charigednow by; the'sovereignforce 6f years, , i And piteous grown,-and no.more terrible; < Look on her, now, who onoe thy life oppre3t* Called bitterest Sorrow then, but now nam4d . Rest!" !
