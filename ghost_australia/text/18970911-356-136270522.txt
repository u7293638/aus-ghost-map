ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. TIo TILE EDITOR. fir,-Neweastlo is now 100 years old, and we are all more or less busy preparing for a proper celebration of the city's centenary. We are telling each other something about the greatness- present and future-of New castle. We have invited the magnates of the adjoining colonies to come and see how we can jubilate when a fitting opportunity offers itself; and we are all swelling "wiaibly, " and, of curse, d~corously with the importance of the occasion. ot far so good. nut there are some inmttere in which this populous centre is very much behind indeed. Thus, the local electrio telegraph office is closed at 10 p.m., after which hour our citizens, like those of the most insignifloant back-bloclkse hamlet, are entirely out off from the outside world. e3urely there is room for improvement in this respect! Our business men and others should ba able to send a message away by wire at any hour of the day or night. Now, here is something to jubilate about to some purpose. Lot the somewhat dry bones of our Chamber of Commerce be galvaniseed into fresh oaction, if at all prosible, and keep them rattling until the very oecessary reform indicated is granted. I might mention other things which are not as they should be, but it doesn't do here to be in too much of a hurry. Better tackle one thing at a time, and hold on to it until it is satisfanctorily settled. IMeantime, I am, &c;, SHORTLND'B GHOBST.
