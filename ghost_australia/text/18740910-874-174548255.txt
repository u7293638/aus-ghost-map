The D- T. again. THE Daily Telegraph asserts a sort of preemptive claim to the limited amount of piety which is to be found distributed among the newspaper offices. And accordingly our contemporary is quite angry with anyone who ventures to speak of Divine laws, outside of its own little circle. Mr. Langton has incurred the displeasure of the D. T., for daring to affirm that free trade is a law of nature ; and, in a sneering article, which might have been written by the ghost of Tom Paine, it declares that " only old women now-a-days, insist on the identity of the laws of nature aud the laws of God in any binding sense." We should have thought if there wag any one fact in the economy of nature so obvious as to force itself on the attention of even the ribald scoffers of the D. T„ it would be this—that as every country and climate are endowed with special resources, and as these exist in such abundance as to exceed the wants of the inhabitants, it was manifestly intended by the Giver of this bounty that there should be an unrestricted interchange of the overplus. If the " young men of neglected education " who serve up daily doses of piety aud scepticism in the columns of the Daily Telegraph, would only put themselves to school for a few months aud acquire a slight smattering of history and political economy, they might not perhaps be too thickwitted to learn, that protection has been the curse of every country which has adopted it, and that no more subtle device was ever hit upon for grinding the faces of the poor, and concentrating wealth in the hands of the rich.
