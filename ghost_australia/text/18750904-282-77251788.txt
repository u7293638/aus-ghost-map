As no amount"of persuasion would in duce him to go smd look for himself, Patsey at length went to the door, and peeped .i-nutiously around. Then, pre tending great felir, he banged the door, and; jumped hack into bed, crying, "Bedad, ttiiri, it's a gliost sure enough *. All iv white, too, like a. hearse at a buryin'.. You'd betther spake to it." Frightened out of his wits, Tony muttered something or other. - ''?'?'??..-?? . . "What'sXtliat you're snyiug," said Patsey; "spake plain, and ask him what he wants."

After breakfast, we separated to our i work as usual. Returning to onr mid- ] day meal, Patsey in great glee told its he had seen Toriy with a priest, followed by a crowd in their best Sunday clothes coming towards the hut. "And bedad," he-added; '* they had more bibles and, prayorbooks among them than I've seen since I was christened." ; His information 'surprised us not-'a little ; for we had no notion that Tony's tale would find believers. .'.."'.??? "It won't do," said one, "to lot his reverence; be fooled like that—we must, get out of it somehow. We must say 'twas all a joke." . " Sure, then, if ye do that, the boys will kill yees alive," said Patsey. " Well, then, say Tony's mad. "That'll do," said Patsey. ?'.-The crowd came up, led by Toriy and the priest.
