A VICTORIAN GHOST STORY. Ghost stories have been somewhat numerous of late, shadowy visitors from the spirit land have made an appearance in two or three country towns. During the last week or two (we learn from the Ararat Advertiser) the equanimity of a number of people living near Elmhurst has been somewhat disturbed by the strange stories that have received currency of the existence of a spirit hitherto unknown in that locality. The nouse which has the reputation of being haunted is situated at Nowhere Creek. For some time past it has been deserted and there is about it an air of uninviting desolation, but recently some one claimed its shelter for a night's rest. About the witching hour of night be was, however, disturbed by a loud noise as if of an earthquake, and seized by terror he rushed out, to find, that perfect calm and quiet reigned. Since this time the place has been visited by a number of young men, who, however, experienced similar dis- turbance, and they quitted it with despatch in the full expectancy of seeing it fall in a heap of ruins. Outside, however, everything wasnorraal, but the young lellows could not summon up courage to agaiu enter the building that night. In the daytime a search was made, but nothing was revealed by which the strange sounds could be accounted for. The presumed unquiet spirit which haunts the place has not, AS far as we bave learned, yet been seen.
