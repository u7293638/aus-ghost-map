'Ybu are 'better now— my daughter,' aho.j (Baid, and Iris understood all the words implied. ' Dear Lady Franklin, you do not mind f.V.slio whispered 'Why should I?' Lodv Franklin answered— perhaps . making a virtue of necessity. ' You are very denr to mo for your own sake, and now that Philip is once more rich— ?thanks to Sir Jasper's hoard — lie is freo to choose a portion loss bride.

' And so ends Franklin's Folly,' Iris said, dreamily, thinking of tlio blackened heap of ruins. 'Although,' sho added more brightly — ' although, plenty of people will soy Franklin's folly continues when they hear Sir : Philip, now that he is rich, has chosen a poor penniless girl for his wife.' Sir Philip bent his head, and their lips met in a long kiss. ' ? ' If my love for you is folly, it is folly that will never end so long as I live.' he said. _'-????' ' i \ [the END.] '
