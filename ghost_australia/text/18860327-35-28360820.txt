THE GAIETY THEATRE. Alter two or threo weeks of drama of a more or les* sen- sational typv, the announcement of the reproduction of u Hamlet" at the ahoye pira» of amazement was in all pro- bability hailed aa a sort nf respite by a considerable) M'.äon of the public, who showed their appreciation of the cham*e by liberally patronising the Gaiety last night. Very fow seats were vacant in the lower port of the house, and En tho callory there was a Urge and some- what noisy crowd. Mr. Ddmnicr's interpreta!ion cf the Prince of DenmArfc has been referred to so often that it is &r;>t necessary to say more about lt than that it was as CA re- fill and intelligent os over, and he waa fairly wall supported by the rest of the company. Miss Katherine Bussell es Ophelia, although overweighted, played with care, and occxvionaily with some force, and Mws Julia Merton was appropriately dignified os tho Queen, Mr. B. X. Jane*' conception of th« character of Polonius was, ss might have bern rapectcd, axcollcut, and Messrs. H. Stoneham. A. Baothraan, G. M'Kcnzie, and C. Hollo- way as the King, Laertei, Horatio, and the Ghost re- spectively wera nl<K> effective. To-night tba dram» " All for Gold " will bo revived._
