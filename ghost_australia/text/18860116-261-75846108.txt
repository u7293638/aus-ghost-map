Of the Hinda legends the moBt striking feature {a their wfldness. li it a protest against the dull monotony ol lite in India Y Or iÂ» life leu monotonous to the native than to the European ? Lai Behari's tales, any how, an wilder than (he wildest bits ot the " Arabian Nights." A yeung man puts an egg of the toontoonia bird into a Clipboard, and ont of it oomes a babe that grows into the loveliest girl the world erer saw.
