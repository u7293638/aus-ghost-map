The days that follow are the happiest we have known since 'Robert's departure for China ; arid in some strange,' almost imper ceptible way, our financial affairs seem to have improved to an almost incredible ex tent since the coming of Uncle Phil. We ; who had thought to share our little with one who had perhaps even less than our-j selves, had somehow found that little in- , creased by what our guest called ' his ; humble contributions to the common stock' i that we were even better off than bef oie be' cdriie. Mamma and I had always lived ; very plainly and simply and for a time: j \incle Phil seemed to' fair into our ways I with all the ease'' imaginable ; and then' came a time when so many expensive little luxuries found their way to our table? that mamma began to look grave and troubled. '? 'I tell you what it is,: Uncle Phil,' I re monstrated one day, with a grave look at the tempting pair of roast fowls that gar nish bur humble board, 'we are all poor people in this establishment, and if you go on at this ? rate- you will be ruined, and' mamma and I so pampered and spoiled that we shall never be able to descend to a plain diet any more; Fowls to-day, a turkey on Sunday, and all sorts ;of extravagances last week!' I wonder what some people can be' thinking of?' . -. 'I know what I am ;thinking of — that' you had better eat your,' dinner and mind your own business, 'Madam Impudence !' Uncle Phil replies. ??'-'? : ; That is the title he generally bestows upon me now ; but for all that we are won' derful friends. ' I am already intensely proud and fond of my tall, good-looking uncle,' and never '' weary of all he tells us' about his old home at- the antipodes — of: the beloved daughter of whom he never1 spokle'very fully'-bu't once, and then in the twilight, as we all' sat talking 'together' round the fire- before the lamps were lighted one evening. His voice wa3 husky and I fancied '??here were tears in: his eyes as ? he told us of her sudden death in the first bright' flush of her girlish loveliness, and of ?the'quiet Australian grave in which he had ''? laid her by the side of the .mother and' brother who died so many years ago. '' CHAPTER' III.' ;-: Of 'his 'money losses he says nothing, nor does he enter into any details concerning! ' his present circumstances,,' From motives ' of delicacy mamma and I forbear to ques-. ',. tibh'him, although we tremble in private'^ over what we consider uncle I'liil's extraya- '., gance, for not only do the contributions to our' 'larder continue, but he often brings home'tickets for the theatre; aiid, in addi- ''( tion' to all this, he is falling into the habit' of making us little presents, which, if inex-' pensive in themselves, make me shudder 'when I think of what the sum-total of cost must-'bel ' ' ''' In'this way November wears away, anil',' Christmas is close upon us, when one dav '.' the parcel delivery cart deposits a box at No. 30, the contents of which almost take ( my breath away when it is opened. , J , A diamond locket and a sealskin jacket for me ! with a silk dress and a set of sables . ; — real sables — for mamma ! Speechless with aninxmnent, I drop into ';? the nearest chair, and stare at our mys terioosly acquired treasures. 'Who can have sent, them?' exclaims'' the. madfe, pale from astonishment as she'.''. passes her hand with a caressing touch'.'' over the soft, warm fur. ' If I did not : know,' my dear. Philip, that yon had lost all yoiir monejr, I should be inclined to bet .' you down as the culprit; but these things ';; must ' have cost a small fortune alto gether,' she adds, with a glance at the locket. : ' That's right, my dear ; pray acquit me ' of such extravagance as squandering my money'on such follies as furs and dia- 'v monds !' uncle Phil replies, glancing quietly ' up from his paper. '' ' 'It must be aunt Frances,' I . interpose ; ' ' but what can have possessed her ? She ' never did such a thing in all her life ' before!' ' ' No, my dear, disinterested generosity is ''' hardly': your aiint Frances' distinguishing . .- characteristic, I belibve !' is the ratlior dry '; reply that emanates from behind the'.. Times; ' ' . Bayly in the new year something occurs 't that occupies a great deal more of uncle , Phil's time than either mamma or I at all '.' » approved ?'. An old friend of my uncle's, who ' is shortly to 'arrive in England from Aus tralia,' has commissioned him to purchase and fit lip a house in readiness for his re- ' ceptibn on his arrival; and the' business '''? connected with this takes1 him so much from home that we miss him. 'Has your friend any ladies in his family, uncle Phil ?' I ask one day, won- '''' dering why he does not toll us more about : '/' this Mr Low, for whose1 reception so much ' preparation is being made. : ' ' 1 ' Yes, two. Why, my dear?'

W , the brief response. ? ; ??. . ?? ??^'U One day, a few -weeks later, uncle .Phil throws us into a nutter, of excitement, bj ,the proposal that mamma and 1 should, go, and inspect this new house, which is .quite, .'ready now for the reception of the , owner. He is anxious, he tells us, for our. opinion: on his taste and judgment, and theioUpw-, ing day is fixed upon for, the .visit. ? . , „ ; . 'But how are we to get there?., I 'inquire. ' It is at Richmond, is it not,?; ? ! 'My Low's carriage will fetch you .at one, my dear,' is the quiet reply. . .? ?? * ' Carriage 1' I gasp. 'Good gracious ! uncle PhD, does your, friend' propose to set up a carriage? Why it must be quite a grand place that we are going ; On the following' day the carriage— such a carriage as is seldom ? seen . in Alberta Terrace— dashes up. with a magnificent Weep before the door of No. 30 ; and uncle .Phil, evidently quite unimpressed, by the sight of the handsome bays and. solemn looking servants on the box, assists us.into iij with as much indifference as if it were . a common street-cab. , , ' ?. ; ' It is rather a silent drive. Mamma r sits looking with thoughtful, almost sorrowful, eves through the window, thinking, Ifancy, of the old days when carriage-tfiding _ was an everyday occurrence .with -her; and /for once in a way uncle Phil seems to -have very little to say for himself. ..??- ' ;i) ' .'.' Mr Low's well- appointed equipage ; has ?prepared me for a good deal in the way or wealth and elegance ; but ; for. all that the sight of the handsome .Richmond house, when at last we reach it, holds me almost speechless from surprise.., A grave- looking butler, who, from the .' respectability, or .his appearance, might have been a bishop, re ceives us in the hall with as much defer ence as if we had been the veritable owners o- this noble establishment; and uncle Phil, who, it seems to. ine,. is wonderfully at home in his iriend's house, leads us into the drawing-room, the refined and artistic elegance of which brings aery of delight to aiylips. : .,, ' 1 am glad you like it, Ada. Come and look over the rest of ttie house, and then; you shall tell me whether you think my friend will approve my taste,' uncle, Phil remarks as he leads the way into a charm ing little morning room,, which, like the, rirawincr-rnnm. is hridllt with, Tjictures and r^re china, and that opens into a large con servatory, from whence come the song of birds and perfume of flowers. To me, having lived out the greater part of.my nineteen-year-old life in the hum drum little house at Kennington, it seems like a dream of wealth and beauty as we ?wander from one apartment to the other, tout iny delight reaches a climax when, on ascending the broad, soft-carpeted stairs,, we enter a perfect little, gem of .a boudoir,, that opens en suite into the most charming of. dressing and sleeping rooms beyond, and which, as my uncle, informs me, have been fitted up ; expressly for the use of 'Mr Low's niece, ayonnglady, as I understand, ?of about my own age. ? 'What do you think of.it, Ada?1'.! he asks, as I pause in the middle of the room, looking gravely about me.. ? 'Is it likely to take a girl's fancy? , Will she like it, do you think ?' .-?..-? .'i She must be a very ; difficult young Jady to please, if^she.does not,' I- reply, ?with an almost envious glance at the costly fittings, the silken hangings, flowers, pic tures, and expensive knick-knacks scat tered profusely about. . ;',', Oh, uncle Phil ! how favored of fortune:, some people are! What a lovely home it is, take it altogether! If it were mine, I should never want to leave it for anything!' , . ., ??,.-.. ' ' Not even to marry ; Robert . Dalesf ord ?' he. returns, in his dry little way. 'But suppose we return to the ; drawing-room, my, dear ! I believe the servants are about to carry in tea.' , : ... A small gipsy table, with a lovely set of old Chelsea, ; /stands before the fire as we enter ;. and taking her seat behind the silver tray, mamma proceds to pour orange pekce and cream into small china cups as coolly as if she were in the little Kennington parlour, instead of this grand Richmond drawing- , room. ' , 7 , .,' 'f I don't know what, you may think, uncle Phil,' I remark, as I hand him a cup of 'tea where he stands, his tall figure rest ing' against the handsomely-carved mantel piece, ' but it seems to me. 't that we are making ourselves tolerably well at home in other people's house. I wonder what the owner of all this magnificence would think if he could but see us ! Bv-the-wav. what are the ladies like for .whom all these beautiful rooms have been prepared ? Are they deserving of their good fortune, do you -think?'. ' Yes, quite deserving of it ; but you wDl shortly have an opportunity of Judging for yourself, Ada. You must forgive me for springing such -i mine of surprise upon you Mabel,' uncle Phil replied, with a glance towards mamma; 'but Mr , Low and rhis family will be here this eyenirig '; . and not only them, but a gentleman from abroad whose acquaintance I. am anxious to make. No objections !' he exclaims, as I am about , to speak, 'I have provided for. all emer gencies, Upstairs in ybur--iri the dressing^ room, Ada— you will find, a box from -a fashionable West-end costumier. What it contains I am not precisely able to say ; but . it ought to be something that will enable, you and your mamma to put in a present able appearance at Mr Low's little reception, this' evening.' '?''-.,.. A presentable appearance indeed, I think,' as I shake, out the handsome black satin, with! rich old-lace collar and cuffs for mamma; and the pretty costume of heliotrope veiling, with silk and satin' brocading, for me. ? ? . Years ago, in my childish days, I used to like to fancy what poor little Cinderella's feeling must have been when first attired, in her fairy ball- dress ; and as I survey myself in the great cheval-mirror this evening, I fancy that I inust feel very much like lier in'my stylish new costume. I have . always been considered rather a pretty girl, but never before did my, fair skin and, 'piquant little face' — I, am quoting Robert i now— show to such advantage as in, the ' pretty new dress in which I follow mamma to the drawing-room to' receive my uncle's friends. ? /.,/ ? - A footman throws open the door on our appearance, and as we enter two gentlemen; ? stand talking together on the hearthrug. ?
