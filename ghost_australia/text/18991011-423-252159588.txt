? BLA.YNEY. (From the West Macquarit) Another month has rolled away and to-day is the all—important day when the " ghost walks," at the mine. Something jjke £3000 will be distributed, and as much of this immense sum must of a necessity find its way into the hands of the looal storekeepers, they should be joyful. Since smelting operations commenced the company has pud away, in wages, between £4000 and £5000, but as a large portion has been sent away to other districts to the wives and families of the men, the town Mb not received the benffit that it should. Several of the men employed iu sinking the tank at the copper mine being discontented at the wageB they were receiving, 6s per day, went out on strike for 7s. The draymen who were receiving 9« per day also went on strike for 10s. The contractor-refused the demand and some of the men went on at the old rate. The next Blayney show will be held on Wednesday and Thursday, 28th February and 1st April, 1900. This is just exaotly a week before the Orange show. " Last week an Assyrian hawker was robbed of £5 at Hobby's Yards. An arrest was made in connection with the matter by Constables Ferris and Airy, of Trunkey, on Saturday last. - v
