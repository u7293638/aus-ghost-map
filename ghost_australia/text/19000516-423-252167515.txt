LITUGOW. (From the Mercury.) The weather still remains beautifully fine, but the frost is now commencing. The season, however, is a good one, and reports from various farming centres are most encouraging. The railway ghost scare has died out. They say now that the ghost was a manj after all. The next ghost that appears willl be treated very disrespectfully. At the copper refining works the furnaoes, iooluding the waterjackets, ere going as usual. At the electrolytic works some preliminary trials have bean made. Mr. Longworth says that it will be some time yet before everything will be complete and ready for permanent work. In consequence of the non-arrival of the crane operations at the new etcel furnace at the ironworks have been on a reduced ecale. Still, however, they have turned out four casts this week, and the result continues very satisfactory. The orane is expeoted any day. At the bar mills and in the other departments work goes on eteadily, and will be better when the steel plant is fully engaged.
