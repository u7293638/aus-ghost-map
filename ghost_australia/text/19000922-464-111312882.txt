REPRINTED FAVOURITES. THE KING OF IRELAND'S CAIRN. Blow softly down the valley, O wind, and stir the fern That waves its green fronds over The King of Ireland's Cairn. Here in his last wild foray He fell, and here he lies— His armour makes no rattle, The clay is in his eyes. His spear, that once was lightning burled with unerring hand, Rusts by his fleshless fingers Beside his battle-brand. His shield, that made a pillow Beneath his noble head, Hath mouldered, quite forgotten, With the half -for gotten dead. Say, doth his ghost remember Old fights— old reveliings. When the victor-chant re-echoed la Tara of the King8 ? Say, in those Halls of Silence Hath he sought his shadowy Queen, Or doth he sleep contented To dream of what has been ? Nay, nay, he still is kingly — He wanders in a glen Whf re Fionn goes by a-hunting With misty Fenian men. He sees the Hounds of Wonder Bring down their fleeting prey He sees the swift blood flowing At dawning of the day. At night he holds his revels. Just as a King might do — But all the gueBts are ghostly, And all the lights burn blue. And he who crowns the feasting, His pale Queen by his side, Is cold as when they stretched him That .bitter eve he died, ' Tis well he seeks no tidings— : His heart would ache to know Taat all is changed in Ireland, And Tara lieth low. — Ethna Cabbbby.
