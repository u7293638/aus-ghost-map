MALDON ' v:' KTNETOX.—Yesterday afteroon a friendly Rifle Match between ten of the Maldon and a similar number of the Kyneton Volunteers, was commenced on-the Kyneton Racecourse. The day was beautifully fine, and being a holiday in commemoration of Her Majesty's Birthday, a considerable number of spectators assembled ; to witness the firing. The ranges agreed on were 20,0.and 500 yards, seven rounds at each distance ; and from the total of .the subjoined score, we. have not 'the least doubt as to whom the victory will be accredited, which is not, however, so much to be wondered at considering the very limited practice of the Kyneton men, whilst Maldon has enjoyedj the privilege of a Rifle Glubof some three or tour years standing, of which club the most of the volunteers are members, The Maldon men, we believe, fire to-day on their own ground. The" score oli the Kyneton side is as follows:— 200 TABDS. ; - Captain Powlett........
