GENTLE SOLDIERS. —Exchange. The King of Dahomey's Amazons, who are now executing a ghost dance, as it were against the French, are made up of three classes of women—stout maidens who ar- selected hy the King, unfaithful wives wh" are sent into service instead of being exr* cuted, and wives who are an vixenish that theirhnshandscannnt endure them. Them are 2500\. of these female soldiers, and everything possible is done to inspire them with cruelty. They take the scalps of their dead enemies, and smear the stncks of their muskets with the blood of their victims, permitting it to dry in the sun until it is caked into thick layers. The strictest celibacy is enjoined upon them, and any departure from it is punishable by death.-
