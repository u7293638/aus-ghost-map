The evi dence of Emma Jackson was to tbe effect that on tbe night of 16th March last Mrs. Small, William Baj'ner, and herself wore at her house, situate at Luddenham. On tbe night in question the cart stood alongside a shed, and the harness was in the shed. On tbe following morning she found the cart in tbe creek, with 24 spokes cut, the shafts broken, some harness cut ; she also missed portion of the harness, including a pair of winkers. Albert Jackson, the young man who saw the mysterious Olaremont ghost, also gave evidence, but it was of such a contradictory cbaraoter that the case was dismissed, and Jackson narrowly escaped being brought be fore the court on a charge of perjury. George Hope, drunk at St. MaryB, fined 5s, with the usual alternative. Fine paid.
