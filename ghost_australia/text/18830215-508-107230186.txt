For more than naif an hour no sound broke the silence of the library but the soft, continuous murmur of Lady , Beauchamp's eager, rapid voice, and the falit't, rustling Bound of hastily (opened letters. ' ? 'To the end of, that time Sir Eobert listened rwith a husked, breatliless attention. At the end of- it he caught mv lady's little finders, still -twined about his own, in a, transport of relief, jjoy, and gratitude to his lips. ' . 'Oh, my darling! my darling!' he cried, his \- voice hoarse and tremulous with emotion, * may jHeayen forever bless jou'for your tender, nnael JEsh devotion to mb. and mine ! And, oh, my jprecious wife, never. cease' to remember that I Siourly and moaaentiy thank that same Heaven tfor the priceless' boon of your counsel and sympathising love !

'1 jwill order the carriage at once.' ' As he epoke those concluding -words they both ynse. Sir Bobert hurried to the bell, Lady Beau Champ to her dressing-TOom.' With her great biack eye6 wide aaid blazing 'with excitement, toy lady bnc6t in upon Do lores. 'Quick, Dolores, quick I* she panted, 'my 'car- triage dress ! — the bronze 1 Not a word now, iDoUy, except that it's sailing upon rivers ot ipU !' * All's well, then?' 'All's well!' The woman's swarthy face noshed darkly, and her bead-like eyes sparkled with sinister delight ; jfcut Bhe said no more. ' ; 6he knew as well as Lady Beauchamp the .monstrous errand upon which her ladyship was aibout to start, and further confidences would shave retarded the progress of the toilet without materially enlightening her. J But despite Dolores's gratification there was a khadow of anxiety in her mind. T 'What will be the result?* she asked herself. f What if, after all— ' ? She suddenly broke away from that silent, oft tepeafced question, and ran after Lady Beau jchamp, as the latter was in the act of leaving the ►oom. ' One moment, Inez,' she exclaimed, catching !her by the arm, and pushing to the door again. i'Are you sure you have not over-rated your (power — your influence. Are you sure of suc cess P* . . ? Lady Beauchamp turned, looked at her, and then pointed to the flood of sunshine pooling in |fet one of the windows. I She answered, her eyes flashing, her nostrils jBilating, her graceful head proudly erect. *Am I sure the sun is shining?' she asked frapidly. ' Am I sure it is day, and not night ? |Am I sure I live, I breathe, X think, I feel ?' She paused. She went on : ' So sure am I of .my success ! So sure am I tthat Nina Beauchamp will in a few days, a few pours, perhaps, be on her way to ' ? Again she paused. Then, an evil smile jeurving her faultless lips, she nodded eig iuincantly to Dolores, and hastened from the jroom. The woman returned to her duties with a smile xcf proud satisfaction. * Who could doubt in the presence of suchcon Ldence P I doubt no longer. She takes a danger ous risk, but — she will succeed ! My little Isa, yon will one day be the richest lady in all Great jjritain/ Lady Beauchamp found Sir Eobert waiting for ter at the foot of the stairs. They proceeded .at 'once to the carriage, and were driven rapidly to Baville Row. As theyv&lighted; In front of Doctor JeffrieVs Residence, the baronet suddenly expressed a fear ?Chat the physician mijrht ba on his way to the park. Lady Beauchamp looked at her watch. * No/ she said decisively, ' we shall find t»n) at home. In the coarse of ray visits I have learned something of his methodical habits, and 'can positively, aeiure you that at this hour he ?will be luxuriously ensconced in his library vitb. ia book/ Lady Beauchamp proved correct. » . They had scarcely seated themselves in the drawing-room whdn the doctor; accompanied by' ids wife, bustled in in them. ' I was quite core it was a professional visits Lady Beauchamp/ exclaimed Mrs. Jeffries, as the shook hands with Inez, ' but I could not deny onyself the pleasure of jusb running 1st to speak to you.' Mrs. Jeffries was a meek Uttle woman whose ?whole life was bounded by her husband, and who rwas scarcely known to have an idea separate from the emanations* of her liege lord's brain. \- If, however, Mrs. Jeffries could have enter tained an opiadon strictly her own, it would icertainly have been upon the subjact of Lady ?Beauchamp. Bui happily, thanks to my lady's fwiles, upon that, as upon all others, husband and ?»rife were in perfect accord, both enthusiastically agreeing that for wit, grace, beauty, and heavenly loveliness of spirit lady Beaachsmp had never ladherequaL * ' Mrs. Jemries'e welcoming address' afforded my lady the finest opportunity to dash into the ?business that had brought her to SaviOe Bow. : - My dear, dearest Sirs.

'. . There was another momentary pause, in which Dr. and Mrs. Jeffries looked from Sir Sobert to my lady, and then, in a sudden-, overpowering ad miration of the lovely dissembler, turned and looked afc each other. ' Such matchless sweetness ! Such matchless consideration' and love !' said the mute but el** quent glance. Lady Beauchamp caught the glance with a thrill of satisfaction, and a new confidence in her power to bring lier atrocious plot to a successful issue. . . _ ' She turned to the pair — turned with a sudden anguished harry. ,'Oh, doctor ! doctor]' she cried, looking up a,t the physician through a fresh mist of gathering tears—* oh, doctor ! it is about poor, poor Nina !' ' ' Nina ? About 2fina ?' involuntarily echoed tae doctor and his wife, in their profound amaze ment. * About Nina !' sadly repeated Lady Beau champ. 'About Nina!* hoarsely whispered Sir Bobert. For the third time a short silence fell among them. For the last time Inez, deep down in her guilty soul, asked and answered a question. Gaaing through her fast-falling tears into the stout little doctor's round, ruddy face, she said, breathlessly, Bhudderingly to herself :' ' Is Fate -with, me or against nie ? Can I do it? Can I hookvrink him as I have hoodwinked my husband ? ^Can I say to him white is black; and make himl- elieve it black ?
