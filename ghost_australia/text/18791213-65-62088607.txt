ORARA. ____ THE strong sob of the chafing stream, That seaward fights its way Down crags of glitter, dells of gleam, Is in the hills to-day. But, far and faint, a grey-winged form Hangs where the wild lights wane : The phantom of a bygone storm--- A ghost of wind and rain. The soft white feet of Afternoon Are on the shining meads : The breeze is as a pleasant tune Amongst the happy reeds. The gloom-dividing fying fire That made the great caves ring. And scarred the slope and broke the spire, Is a forgotten thing. The air is full of mellow sounds ; The wet hill-heads are bright ; And, down the fall of fragrant grounds, The deep ways flame with light. A rose-red space of stream I see Past banks of tender fern : A radiant brook, unknown to me Beyond its upper turn. The singing silver life I hear, Whose home is in the green Far-folded woods of fountains clear Where I have never been. Ah, brook above the upper bond, I often long to stand Where you in soft cool shades descend From the untrodden Land ! Ah, folded woods that hide the grace Of moss and torrents strong, I often wish to know the face Of that which sings your song ! But I may linger long, and look Till night is over all : My eyes will never see the brook Or sweet strange waterfall. The world is round me with its heat And toil and cares that tire : I cannot with my feeble feet Climb after my desire. Butt, on the lap of lands unseen, Within a secret zone, There shines diviner gold and green Than man has ever known. And wher the silver waters sing, Down hushed mid holy dells, The flower of a celestial Spring A tenfold splendour dwells. Yea, in my dream of fall and brook By far sweet forests furled, I see that light for which I look In vain through all the world. The glory of a larger sky On slopes of hills sublime That speak with God and Morning, high Above the ways of Time ! Ah ! haply, in this sphere of change Where shadows spoil the beam, lt would not do to climb that range And test my radiant Dream. The slightest glimpse of yondor place, Untrodden and alone, Might wholly kill that nameless grace The charm of the Unknown. And, therefore, though I look and long, Perhaps the lot is bright Which keeps the river of the song A beauty out of sight. HENRY KENDALL.
