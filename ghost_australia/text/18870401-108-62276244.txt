PORTFOLIO. Pt.Lr S.on.r.-To-day begins the most solemn week in the whole year, the great and holy week of the Passion (or suffering) of our blessed Lord. From he ginning to end of it one thing is held up to us, even the C(ro. of Jesar . On that we are bidden to fix our eyes. It is that which must fill our hearts. Day by day in services of the Church is read the wonderful story of the Saviour's death. Day by day we are called upon to go up, as it were. in spirit to Calvary, and gaze on that blessed and awful sight. A voice seems to speak to us from Heaven, saying, " go up and behold" behold your Lord and your God sinking under the Cross, which He bears fir you : behold Him nailed to the accursed tree, bleeding with the strokes of the cruel scourge, torn with the thorns they have put upon His holy brow : be hold Him raised high in the air, like the brazen serpent in the wilderness, while the world stands round and mocks His agony: behold Him worn out with His awful weight of suffering, bowing His head, and giving up the ghost. Listen to His sacred voice praying for his murder ers : listen to His blessed promise to the penitent thief beside Him: listen to his words of fearful woe, when even the pre sence of the father seemed for a while with drawn, "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me 1" listen to that last pierc ing cry, when he gave up his spirit to God. Look upon the earthquake, and the sud den awful darkness, and the rending of the veil of the Temple, and the rising of the dead from their graves. Nay, let not man's weak words try to picture that mighty scene. Go to God's own word. Read there day by day this week of these things. And as you read try to realise to make it real to your hearts. Bring it all before you. See it. Hear it. Stand there amid the darkness and the signs and wonders, and try to feel yourself in the very presence of that scene, the most marvellous the world has ever known God hanging in death upon the Cross for man.-Bishlop of Becdford.
