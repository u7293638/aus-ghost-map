DUTY ON BRICKS. In our last issue we drew attention to the unfairness of those interested in the construction of the new edifice for the Bank of New South Wales using imported bricks when as equally good article can be obtained in the colony. We are glad tliat the question was brought forward in Parliament on Wednesday evening last, and we are giad, too, that it has been decided to " consider the advisability of increasing the duty." There are many industries in this colony that need no protection, for the simple reason that the conditions of the country will not allow of them to flourishâ€”cattlebreeding, to wat. It is amusing to learn that * during the debate Mr. Monger says " I fail to see the necessity for any increased duty." The member for York was not in the same frame of mind when his friends interests were in question. He w^s an ardent advocate for an exorbitant duty being placed on cattle, frozen meat, etc. He doesn't seem to grasp the fact that while we hive plenty of clay here, we have no grass. We CAN " grow " bricks, but we CAN'T grow beef. " He was afraid," he said, "that an increase duty wotilcj only create a monopoly." Great Cseser's Ghost ! This is the first time that Fred has appeared in the character of an antagonist to the monopolist. Did he never read the well-known lines of Bobby Burns about seeing ourselves as others see us. Monger and Alec Forrest are two of tfee greatest would-be monopolists in West Australia, They are indeed In this respect the head and frQnt of all offending." f t The CHRoarie&fi; does not believe in " protection run mad," but it does belive in protecting industries that can' be made to flourish in the country, and assist in giving work to the thousands of unemployed in our midst. It does not believe in protection that deprives the people of the necessaries of life, but it does believe in protection that will provide labor.
