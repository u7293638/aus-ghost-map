A Ghost Story. A sweep had been employed by a farmer, who lived in nn extremely lonely spot. It wns Into when his work wns finished, and he asked ixrmiftftiun to sloop in tho l-arn. This wns readily granted. In tho ni^ht the sweep was aroused from his }-cnceiul slumbers by hearing tho Iwvrn* door cautiously open. Ho looked up and saw two men enter, who at onco sot down tho lantern thoy had been carrying, and proceeded to fill two sacks with tho farmer's best malting bnrloy. ' If,' said ono of tho thioves, 'wo had someono to hold tho lantern up, wo shouldn't bo long.' ' No,' agreed tho othor 5 ' wish wo had someone.' ' I'll hold tho light for yoii,' offered the sweep, coming forward politely. Tho mon turned. Thoir hair rose on ond at the supposed apparition. With a blood* curdling yell, thoy both rushed from the bam. Not till noxt morning did it dawn on the sweep that the two men had mistakon him for his Satanio Majesty, or one of his angels. No moro barley was takon from that barn.
