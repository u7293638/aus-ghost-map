H EMBLEMS. 'M The wars whioh so . long devastated Eng land were carried on under the symbols of the Red and White Rose. The adherents of || the Houbb of Lancaster chose tbe red rose as ยง| their mark of distinction, whilst those ' of |H| York chose tbe white. The fratrioidal war $| continued until the union of the Rose by the m marriage of Henry VII. with the PrincesB || Elizabeth of Yorkin I486, since which time |v|| the rose has continued to be the emblem of 1 England ;?! When St. Patriok landed in Ireland, to 1 convert the Irish, A D. 432, tbe pagan in | habitants were ready to stone bim. He re | queBted to be beard, and endeavoured to ex li plain God to them as the Trinity in unity, I but they did not understand bim, until be I pluoked a trefoil or shamrock from the I ground, and said, ' Is it not as possible for the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost . to be one as ยงj for these three leaves to grow upon a single J stalk V ' Then,' !says Brand, ' the Irish 1 were convinced, - and became converts to 1 ? ? ? Christianity,' and in memory of thpt eveut tbey have ever since worn the shamrook as a badge of honour. ' When the Dunes invaded Scotland, on one occasion they resolved to adopt a stratagem, and, in order to prevent the Soots from de tecting them, they marched barefoot. The Danes thought tbey should reach the camp in a few minutes, when suddenly a man who wfent forward was so wounded by a stout Scotch thistle that he could not help crying out loudly with pain. This noise roused the camp ; the Scots flew to arms, and tbe Danes were vanquished. The thistle was afterwards adopted as the insignia of Scotland.
