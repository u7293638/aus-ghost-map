SUGGESTIVE THOUGHTS. The life of Christ is the rule by which the Holy Spirit guides our steps. The Image of Christ is presented to the believer's soul according to the portraiture of God's promises. The knowledge of Christ is the greatest talent that can be entrusted to man. The love of Christ is the believer's unanswerable argument, Who gave Himself for me. Christianity is Christ. Christianity is Christ formed in the heart. Christianity is not a science, nor a system, but the life of God in the soul; it cannot, therefore, be theoretically learnt. The Gospel is God's plan, by which he has restored the harmony between the believer's present state and his eternal sentence. The Gospel, to be the solace, must be also the guide of our lives. The effect of any truth on our lives will be in proportion to the faith by which it is received in the heart. We shall never overcome the world until we can glory in the victory of Christ. The price of our redemption is of God's own appointment. There can, therefore, be no question of its acceptance or sufficiency. The " Witness of the Spirit" is the only testimony received in the Court of Heaven. The end of the natural hearts action is self; that of the renewed heart is Christ. God is the measure of His own mercies, according to the riches of His glory. The darkest portion of Faith's path is brighter than the greatest splendour of the course of this world. Peace and joy in believing is the legacy of Christ, borne to the soul by the Holy Ghost; my peace I give unto you. A Divine truth fixed in the mind becomes a centre of life and light. [Selected by G.
