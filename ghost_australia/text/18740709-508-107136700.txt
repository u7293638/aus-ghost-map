The ttiriic Gbspel '_ (}from ike Saturday Review.) _ '/ ;' It appears that tor some months paBt much ercite ment has been produced in Edinburgh and other towns in Scotland by the singular, exercises of a couple of itinerant Americans— Mr! Moody and Mr. Sankey. . Fora very long time no entertainment has, been so popular in Edinburgh as that which goes by the name of these gentlemen, it is at tended by overflowing audiences. Crowds of enthusiasts follow the performers from one place to another, for |t is part of their system to have as much variety as possible, ? and to -hold their meet ings in all; sorts, of di&erent; \- buildings, in town halls, lecture-rooms, and churches of all denomina tions. The meetings are held at all -hours of the day,- and some are for young men, some for- mothers, ? some „ for fathers, others for young women, clerks, students, or little children.- Curiosity is stimulated by huge placards on tne wans, ana several penoaicais command a large; sale by describing the perform ances, The nature of the exhibition is stated in the following announcement: 'At 6.30 p.m., I Mr. Moody 'wilt preach the Gospel, and Mr. Saukey will sing the CktspeL' Mr. Moody and Mr. Saukey \ are Americans, from Chicago ; and we learn from one of theirjorgans that tbeir visit to Scotland was prompted :,by ». 'feeling'. that the churches theie stood ' specially in 'need of the application of. those brisker, livelier, more direct modus of appeal which-are characteristic of America.' Mr. Moody, ' weare further told, is 'not a man of much edu cation or culture ; his manner is abrupt and blunt ; his speech bristles, jvith Am,ericahisms; hie voice is sharp, rapid,. and. colloquial.' He is remark able for his- want of sanctimonicushess ; and 'a- play of humour spurts out sometimes in his most serious addresses.' He interlards Ms lectures with : droll or, wonderful stories, or, as the writer puts ' it, ' be has in this possession a large number of incidents and' experiences well fitted to throw light onihe points hp employs- taem' to elucidate', and to clinch the appeals which he uses' them to onfnnnBy?!

In common revivals mare shouting r 4™ shrieking nn'swer the purpose of the operators, but Mr. Moody's exercises are of a more artistic quality. ITriends 'of the mbvement, mingled with the audience, also lent tlieir aid. , TUey pounce upon any one who seems in be moved, end pour in their exhortations; and there are also ^private rooms to -which eases of distreas are cqnreyed. .

The '-workers' in; atteii'lonce on' her had to beep her ' constantly ' sup plied 'ytith 'a change of fresh pockethimd -kerchief8-ahd^dry hymn' books. Another time Mr. 'Moody called upon, seven1 'ientlemen on the platform to tell jUie company liow they were eaved. «lMost of them were well-known men, a mihi8ter,! a colonel in the army, n Hierchunt, a sheriff, a doetor, a Dobleman.' and a captain, in the navy. The effect was marvellous.' Prayers were offered iip for an ?'? uncle who is an infidel,'' for ' a -family, the father an avowed jhfide!, and the mother and children unoontErtea,'for 'a clergji Rktidnalietic-errors,' At one of the meetings the experiences of a young 'Ifdy were giyen as part of the entertainment 'For an hour she sat in the greatest agony; her hands were clasped, her eye balls looked as if tUwy would start from their sockets.' Even cliildren ;are^ worked upon— little children of eight or nine— with all the terrifying formula of the Sevivalist school. A little boy illustrated his faith by ; remarking that, if : his «ister received an offer of marriage from a very rich man who had promised she should live in a fine mansion, would she not be very foolish to refuse such an offer. At one meeting weare tbld of *? a dear little boj% about nine years of age, at most ten, wlip was crying as if feft littleTieart would break/; -while a 'kindly father-like UktaT was torturing the poor child with things too deep for him to understand. We read of a book which was sent to another child con taining three lfcaves— one white, the next blood red, and the third .white, indicating salvation. 'You '-can't hive too much blood,' is Moody's motto. ' ? ' : It is said to |-e, too soon to estimate tli o results of the agitation which has been carried on by these expedients; butitiB not. very difficult to anticipate what, judging from former experience, they are likely to be. It is impos sible to imagine anything more nn whole- . some .and debilitatintr than the sort of morbid' excitement and hysterical rapture which is thus cultivated; and in other cases the consequence his invariably been, a reaction of a deplorable kind. In the co untsy districts of Soot iand rpviiYBM Ifave usually left their mark in an increa»e;flf drv nkenness and a scandalous addition' io theSegiBtrar-Generars statistics of illegitimacy,. In Edinburgh ' ^ie heat . and: frenzy have probably been lese inter sglbanrmigu't be supposed from jth$ extravagantjt iguace of the organs of the move- i ment . It^sanfeadily be understood 1that, as one of these papew says, 'fcUndredB -of young.peraons who were f ornjerly ftcouetomed to go to 'the theatre, opera, and ;pantomime, gave up deliberately, and Com choice arid the force of conrictiori attended the prayer-meetiags}' 3but the explanation in a gre^t many cfeses.ifc no doubt, that the prayer jneeting^iwer* ^founo,;, to be more amusing and stimulating- Qneof Mr. goody's most .' screaming liit8,'a8they.iayintheplay-biUe,ifiamock repre sensation.of.li court of law for the trial of Jesus Christ. He asks the congregation to consider itself a court/of inquiry, and nominates one of the ministers present to be usher and to call in the witnesses, wbo are' then examined with Yankee freedom, and jocularity by Mr. Moody. Pilate's wife is called. Mrs. Pilate, and among the other witnesses are 'the Aposues, me angeis, ana tne Deity. ; This sbit of roaring fun goee beyond any thine on the stage. - It is bird to say whether the tteaBnent of wugion in this manner does most harm. -by bringing «aered things into ridicule, by afflicting some feeble minds with idle agony, or by overbalancing others with the inflation of self righteous arrogance and conceit. ' There is sot the faintest trace of educated intelligence or spiritual elevation in Mr. Moody's harangues. Thtey are a mere gabble of texto, interspersed with grotesque or sensational anecdotes, and Spiced with vulgar American slang. The. most extraor dinary feature of the agitation is that it should be connived at and patronised by the clergy of Edin burgh and other towns. It is obvious that if Moiidy and Sankey are right in tlieir mode of preaching the Gospel, and if the success of these performances it really a 'great awakening'' and the ' power of the Holy Ghost in Scotlang,' the ? ordinary services oi religion must be a melancholy, farce. Everybody who has been in Scotland must have been struck with the severe endurance and' fortitude with, which a Scotch congregation sits, out, not only* a long and dreary sermon, but a series of .prayers which are the worst sort of ser mons in disguiie ; and it 'is not surprising that the Scotch .laity should be thankful for a little relaxation. But that the ministers, themselves should come forward in this manner to proclaim publicly that their whole system is a failure end waste of time is really straiige. ; It jnuBt be still more wonderful if, in supporting and recommending Messrs. Moody and Sankey, they do not see that they are condemning -themselves. Either a great awakening is good for their flocks, or it is not; if it is, why do they not take mea sures to bring it about on their own account P The only justification which is offered for the eccentri cities and buffooneries of the Yankee propaganda is sipiply that the end justifies the means, ard thaV'the great thing is to produce an impression on -the public; mind, no matter how. It; would appear,- therefore, that sermons had better be abandoned '? for singing and story-telling, and there is no logical reason why the reform should stop here. The banjo and the bones might be sub stituted for i.-the harmonium, and Mr. Sankey's solos might -»e ^occasionally varied by a little' dancing.. The Fantee, Flip-flag Fandango would be an appropriate 'accompaniment to Mr. Moody-s '.' spurts of humour' and eelept anecdotes. ', If it is to ibe understood that it is the business of Christian churches to1 compete, as the Jfntuli JSumyeha, holds, with ' the theatre, opera, and pantomime,' why is the competition left' to theseAmerican gentlemen? It is stated that MeBsre.MoDdy and Sankey may shortly be 'expected in ; London ; .'but they will' perhaps discover that their line of bu»ineis has nliieady-been pretty -well worked at the Tabernacle and elsewhere.
