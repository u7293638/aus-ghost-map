A SHOUTING COMPETITION A curious contest has set itself up in the Kalgoorlie residence areas. Seeing the profit made out of fish by one fortunate liawfcer three others went to follow bis cart tracks. One more enterprising than the rest invented a new cry .which trills out for two or three minutes in eulogy of his wares. The others imitated him, and nowvhen Ihe four hawkers meet in the same street there is a ccntest against which the howling dervishes would not have the ghost of a chance. The residents so far grin and bear it but a few talk of purchasing guns.
