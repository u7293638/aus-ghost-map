Clutch- Soff bis arm, she pointed straight ahead and ^ yptsped : " Look, John. Look!" 1 down the road, just beside the glimfnering monuments of the old graveyard, he maw an apparition. It was that of a man with a long white beard sweeping over his inreast. The figure appeared to be eight #eet in height, and in one hand it carried a elnb, such as the brains of the old man had fceen beaten out with ten years before. JEBowty raising one arm, the ghost with a ynajeetic sweep beckoned French to come |M. He was too startled to do anything fexeepc try to restrain the prancing horses, jjwhich were straining at the harness in at- Itempts to break away and ran. A cold fiweat started out all over the body of the Ifarmer as he realised that he was at last looking at a ghost, and then the sound of jhis wife's voice came to him, begging him *o return the way they had come and eccape Ahe doom which seemed impending. French f»as still too much scared and excited to ^control the horses, and as he gazed stead- jfastly at the fearful white object in the mwd it slowly began to move toward them, The club was now raised to its shoulder, «a a soldier carries a rifle, and it seemed •o move forward; without touching the ground, like a winged thing. Then the farmer recovered his faculties. 'Whirling his team around, he lashed the 3w»es into a run and set out for the bouse «f the friend he had just left. Wh.u they •rived there, both the man and his wife were almost fainting from fright. The next man to see the ghost was Milaon Moon. He had the reputation for being JMfe only a man of intelligence, but one without fear. Hip experience was much the •ame as that of the Frenches, and it brought •bout several investigations by parties of jpeople. In each case they Baw and were convinced of the actual presence of the *host without being able to discover any satisfactory explanation. ; -An Interesting American ghost is that fiviiwh is said to dwell in the Forbes manor Jfconse at Bath-on-the-Hudsoa, near Albany.

Norfolk is another county which teems with tfboste. There is a pale, long-haired woman who runs shrieking amont? the pitt on Aylmerton Heath. There is a great black " shuck dog "—the word " shuck " j is said to mean the devil—which bat | a blazing eye in the centre of his forehead, j and has a brother at Peel Castle, in the Isle ' of Man. _ the _ r spirit , ,, of a murdered prisoner. j . rtV™™. who was murdered ; TTK merston, in APfifrtn 1565 by who vrlin his arranged guardian, B f that Sir Richard a Ful- ; n rocking horse ot, which the boy sat should fall, still prances about on a headless rocking-horse. Anne Boleyn etill rides down the avenue of Blickling Park once a year in a hearselike coach, drawn by four headless horses and driven by a headless driver, with hei head in her lap, and her father,Sir Thomas, does the same thing. At Caistor Castlf there is another cotcb and headless team, and yet another near Great Melton. This last rises from a pool every midday and midnight and, with its load of four headless dripping white robed ladies, passes slowly round the field and sinks again, and tradition says that at this spot long ago a brida! party were upset into this pool and nevei seen again.
