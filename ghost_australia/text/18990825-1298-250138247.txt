At last, whentheywere thinking of turning home, theV stooped in front a hoiile at which they decided to jpay their last visit. Scarcely had they stationed themselves in front of it and commenced their favourite song, d, merry, merry Christmas * bells," n a lady came outon the verandah, he waited patiently, till they had firstthen in- ^jpui^jfc they coming insidejj^sacL «f f^j^^outside. much but 'Unfortunately she .^lUiftJple to leave '; '«We will come in willingly*" re- "pm and] follo^ed the lady into wi^^into a large in ^ ^ ^ ^ j p o b ; %' littld of rafter- ; bn her^^oiijijg - face, was lying on a ^reading lamp ^jfiiag, she te t tb ' pfp you will sing ^^^^fv^iifti, "^pqk full",'pj- amu^n^nl-iit th<@' " ~ipid-'pen• the carpllfjre; wrTiere, she of the carols glistening with ' isHso fond o! said & one to sightly towards Horace, thus hiding her face partly from Harold. But her-.fears ;of discovery: were* not realized, for Harold, after giving a sealing glance at the faces of the Eing®jft3, crossed over to the side of his little sister. At the sound of his voice, Kathleen looked up eagerly and exclaimed, " Oli, Harold, I am so glad you have come; we are having a most delightful time." • "*'Well, .1 hope I haven't stopped rit)" said Harold,; pleasantly, for the singers had bec.ome silent at his entrance ; then turning towards our ' ftferry Men,' he continued, " I wish yoii would sing that again, if you don't mind ; I only heard the end of it, and, as Kathleen says, it is one'.of my favourites." . /'.Certainly, if you wish it," replied Edward, at'the same time loo'>ing in astonishment at Elsinore, quite unable to understand 'why she was making such desperate signs to him to refuse. , After the carol was finished, Edward made a sign to the others, and Frank aud Charlie shouldered their violins, preparatory to their departure. " You are not going yet," surely ?" said Kathleen. " Yes, we must," replied Edward, adding, as he looked towards Mrs.. Thornton, " we also have a mother, and she will be anxious if we stay away too long." " Well," remarked Harold, laughing, "I have not had much of your company, but I thank you for. the pleasure you have given my little sister." t Yes, I have enjoyed it so much," said Kathleen. "I am very glad of that," said Edward, and for a moment Elsie feared that he would offer to sing again, but he did not, and then Hareld took a light to & light them to the door. As he stood at the door, watching them as they passed through the gates, there came to him) through tbe still summer night,\in a merry, girlish voice, the ccy of " Good-night, Mr. Thornton! You are - a.. nice one to forget yorir fellow-passenger so soon! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year." l,':Harpld started, and gazed eagerly '^ifie^p^xigijBgaies, but they were ^ cfMSflWay for him to distinguish • " 4 ;CHiAPTER XL >L , CHBISTJUS DAY. . ^^^.^e^e^ifeiiy Men " after ivei^fli^^Sasa^siori that the sun 'l^i^lfl^ai hours . before ^^pj^fe^the first to awaken, ill ij^^lle was just turning; ^feep ; again when he ie* calling, " Come, it is quite time you itead to go to.church rose lazily, yawning »£ter rousing his ^W^gito went into the ^vfa.iwake t^e other ~ ir , .^^-jmedfiat him for his pkins, but'aftei|tygfeatSeal of trouble and schemin'g;^ Bdwcfird's part, at last consented ;to tiirji out of bed. In the meantime Mrs; Oreymount moused the girls. ,, In ; less than liar-: quarter of iour, 1 they all ^pjp^ared in therbreakfast-room, poking and feeling very qleepy, but" •M^the vtime they had .dressed for, ^ ' " h they had regained as nearly as Jle,;their usual spirits. Atthe -church they saw several of ' ^e whom thiy had visited the fore^ but suoh a transformav fteb place inthbir dresses that they were reoognized by no o,ne. After dinner was over, and they were all leaning over the verandah eating water-melons,'Frank said: . " Well, what aire ' this -'aftsrnoon's proceedings to be? Being ChristmSis Day, we can't .playjcricket or tennis, and it is too hot toSrenia n indoors." f'1'11 tell you what," said Nellie; " let us take the'boat and go down the river, but instead of landing as we usually do, we can stay in the boat, as it is cooler oh the water, .-and while the rest of us eat our Christmas dainties One can read aloud." • " Very nice for the one whc> readi aloud, I mu3t.say," remarked Charlie, " to see all the others enjoying them-' selves." " He couldn't see them if he Were reading," r torted Nellie. " Oh, I. gee the honoured persdq is to be a 'he,'" said Horace. " . < " Don't be silly, Horace," returned Nellie, laughingly I ^-Sof course we shall all takd tur'ns:'\ " That wouldn't" be too bad," said Edith; " but what book -shall we take?" " Why the one of all Ghristmas tales," said Jessie; " I am sure wfc all like it." • ^ " Considering that ,. we^ - haven't heard the name we can^iSECrcely express our opinions," said Horace.. " What is it ? n ask€d Elsie. " Charles. Dickens? < Christmas Carol,' or as it is^more generally, known,'Scrooge, andMarly'sGhost,'" replied Jessie. ; ^ : ~ • ' I've never-read it'-said.-Nellie. ' Well, you have missedf a treat," said Edward; "it is otfe. of the prettiest tales ever'written."v ^ . Then let us read it by all means," said Horace. S While the girls busied' themselves in getting the^ book and arranging their Christina's goods in a basket, as an easier way of managing than each carrying her own, two of the boys went to get the boat ready, and the other two searched out cushions so as to be as comfortable as possible. When everything was ready they all repaired to the boathouse. " Oh, throw the cushions in anywhere, Edward," exclaimed Mavourneen, as the former began to arrange them properly ; " thpy will only have to be arranged again when we reach our destination "; and with 'this she bundled them all into the stern of tbe boat, and jumped in herself, a proceeding which the others soon followed. When they reached <$ie creek they drew the boat into the Shade, near the banks, making it fast), to a branch hanging" over the water, and then proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as possible -with the aid of the cushions. After, they had all settled down* Edward took the book and began to read. When Mariey's ghost appeared to Scrooge they could not help giving ppcasional glances ; round as if to assure them selves that they were free from such spirits, but as the tale progressed they all became deeply interested, fcml ndiift word fras -spoken till the vision shown by the Ghost of the Past made Charlie exclaim : "Well, I am a beauty! There, I promised one of the fellows, who is not going home for his holidays, to wqte to him, and I have nuite forgotten all about it!" v .'; _ you are a nice -^fife/' replied Edithj «but I'll remind |pou when we get home, and then you$an writeC" ^^ All right,'' ianswerea Charlie; don't forget." , • (To be Continued.) ; burgicilMd Mechariical Dentxal^69 Queen sstreet.
