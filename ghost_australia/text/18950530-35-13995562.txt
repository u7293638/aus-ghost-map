The Y VICE PRESIDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE COI NCIL replie 1 and stated the considerations which lead the Public YY ores Committee to reduce the estimate to a 000 He had no objection to the insertion of an amendment in the hill so as to re- strict the expenditure to the amount stated The motion for the second reading of the hall was agreed to, and the House resolved itself into committee to consider the bill in detail Clause J iv:ts amends 1, on the motion of Mr Dangar, by inserting at the end of the clause the words And shall not under any circumstances exceed the estimated cost by more than 10 per cent " The remaining clauses were passed without amendment, and the House having resumed, the hill was reported with, an amendment and the report adopted H V IRRIG Al TION ACT AMI NUMEN DHL The VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FVICU TIVE COUNCIL moved the second reading of the Hay Irrigation Act Amendment Bill, and explained that the measure was intended to reetif j a mistake in the original bill!

The MCI PREsIDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL moved the second reading of the Randwick Cemetery Bill He said that the object of the measure was to close the cemetery, a course which appeared to be just held by the report of Dr Ashburton 1 Thompson, who stated that there was reason to believe that recent cases of diphtheria in it locally) contiguous to the cemetery there traceable to the opening of old graves. Mr PIGOTT said he did not oppose the second reading of the bill, but wished to point out reasons why certain amendments should be made in it His solo objection to the cemetery was, he was informed, raised by one gentleman who had bought a piece of land adjoining the cemetery and had erected a terrace of houses there Finding that they did not let, he attributed it to the cemetery hence the present agitation (Mr Dtscun Hear, hour I have heard the too ) He had seven! statutory declaration in reference to the bill The registrar of births, marriages, and deaths at Randwick, stated that there were no more deaths from diphtheria in the vicinity then in any other locality, and Mr Henry Now come Deputy Registrar-General, who had lived near the Randwick Cemetery for five years, said that during the whole time he had detecto 1 no smell from the cemetery, and that he did not know of any case of diphtheria in the immediate locality. The Government Statist chin also reported that the deaths at Randwick and AY Waverley were 10 per cent, less than in any other locality (Hear, hear.) Mr. E H D WHITE said the while sympathising with municipalities in their desire to conserve the health of the residents within their boundaries, he thought some consideration should be given to those who owned vaults in the cemetery He also pointed out that the cemetery existed long before private residences were erected round it Mr DAY said be thought that the bill was one in the right direction, and he should give it his support ThoATTORNEY.GENEnVL said that the bill did not in any way erasure from the Government, 1 but was proposed in consequence of an official report which stated that the health of the people of the locality was seriously endangered by the existence of this burial-ground A petition, which had been presented by Mr Pigott that evening in reference to the Randwick Cemetery, contained the names of some of his (Mr Want's) most intimate friends and several of his relatives, but in a matter such as this they must ignore personal sympathy and sentimental feeling and consider only the interests of public health. He believed that not only Randwick, but Waverley and other cemeteries in populous localities, should be closed. The motion for the second reading of the bill was carried, and the House went into committee on the bill In clause 4 Mr PIGOTT moved an amendment, " That persons possessing vaults should have the , right to inter bodies in the cemetery provided that the bodies were enclosed in leaden coffins, the lead to weigh not less than 5lb to the square foot " The amendment was carried on division by 16 to 7.

Upon the order of the day for the second reading of the Land and Income Tax Assessment Bill, The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that as far back as April last he desired to go on with the bill, but at the time he quite admitted that it was putting the cart before the horse to bring up the machinery of the bill before the bill itself was submitted It was, however, necessary to have the machinery of the bill ready for the Local Government Bill, which was one of the measures which it was thought at the time would come up at an early period, and for that reason he proposed in April last to go on. At the request of hon members he postponed the second reading from time to time, so that hon. members might hear the financial proposals of the Treasurer, which had now been published. It was, however, necessary to ask for a further postponement until the other bills came up. Sir WATSON Why prolong the agony The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said he did not know where the agony came in. Mr PIGOTT If this bill is not carried what is the use of bringing up the other bills connected with it The ATTORNEY-GENERAL Because this bill is merely the machinery to carry out the other bills that are to come up to move the postponement of the order of the day for a week. Mr DANGAR What is the use of postponing it for a week when there is not the ghost of a chance of the other bills coming up by then " The ATTORNEY-GENERAL Then say a fortnight Perhaps something will be done by then. Mr DAVIES said that the whole of the principles of the taxation proposals of the Government were involved in this mail, and by dealing with the measure they dealt with the whole question, as the others would simply relate to the figures connected with the direct taxation. Why then should they keep this matter hanging over the heads of the public for a fortnight ' After further discussion the order of the day was postponed for a fortnight BANKRUPTCY ACTS AMENDMENT BILL The House went into committee for further consideration of the postponed clauses of the Bankruptcy Acts Amendment Bill Clause 2 was agreed to.
