The Story of A Bream. There are a great many people who arc firm believers in dreams, and who are not ashamed to admit it, and a great many other people who will not plead guilty to what they call foolish superstition, and who yet are more or less impressed by a. bad or good dream. To the latter order (according to a paper published at Tientsin) a gentleman belonged wlio some years ago buried his father in a temporary grave whilst the tomb in course of construction for his remains was being finished. When completed the re moval from one spot to the other took place ; but on the tempormy grave being opened it ?was found filled with water, and the coffin was decayed. This being the statp of things, the undertaker hastily picked up tiicbonos, placed thein in an urn, and re-interred them. The same night the son dreamed that he saw his father in great displeasure, and, awaking from his dream he fell to slecpagain to have it repeated. This happened forsoveral successive nights, until at length he mentioned the circumstances to his friends, for, though no believer in dreams, his mind was .troubled. Onp of his .acquaintances suggested that perhaps his father's spirit objected to being removed; another hinted that, more likely, all the bones had not been collected- and this last Jiiut led 'to a search and to the find ing t-f a bone which had escaped notice. It was at oiico interred with the rest in the urn ; nn3 since, 13ia$ night the sou's slumbers have been undffif fii-bt&j; jQie ghost, his grievance set tles!,' nppeariiig as ^aovo, ,
