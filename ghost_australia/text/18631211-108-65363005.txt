Instances of successful enterprise in Melbourne are far from rare, but the growth of large mercantile establish- - ments from small beginnings are neces sarily so, from the recent date of the city's growth into a colonial metropolis. At the south-west corner of Bourke street and Swanston-street might be seen, eleven or twelve years back, a small outfitters' shop, some fifteen feet square' 'The proprietors, foi small as the concern was there were two partners, gradually increased their business and their premises, until they, having lately added the auction-room, &c.;, occupied by Isaac Lyons and Co.. have now for the purpose of their trade, one of the finest ranges of buildings in Melbourne, occupying some 250fl. -of valuable frontage, Nos, 6I, 66, and 69 in Bourke street, and 109, 111, and 113 in Swan ston-street.

The abundance and low. :price: of wheat in England this year are causing the farmers there to do what we have often had to do here, namely, calculate how far this grain can be profitably used in place of other articles for feeding and fattening stock of different kinds. The result will no doubt be the substi tution, to a great extent, of wheat for oilcake and . other substances now imported so largely, 'and the superabundance of breadstuffs will thus he converted into meat, of which last article of diet it sems impossible to keep up the supply equal to the de mand, no matter what the season may be; but sinch a use of wheat is only con sistent with a very low price, and the prospect of a continuance of this; and certainly the facilities for growing wheat are becoming so much greater in Eng. land each year,. that such an. abundance may for the future be looked for 'as the rule in all moderately favourable years. The general draining of wet lands, and consequent improvement of the clays, has tended much towards increasing these, as has every step towards the more general adoption of any one of the many changes with constitute the diffes renee between good 'and bad- farming; but, more than all the rest, the extended use of the steam-plough is rendering wheat- growing 'easy, by allowing of autumn tillage to an extent altogether impossible without its aid. No sooner are the crops off than the land. can be broken up again, and afterwards scari fled: and harrowed, and thoroughly. cleansed of weeds,- in good time for-the sowing of the wheat, and all this witholut waiting for the certainf amount .of rain which- must- fall. before the. ordinary' plough can turn over the stiff soils at all. It has often been said ihat the clay lands under tillage in England are capable of growing wheat enough foi"_tho popnla tion, and it would almost-seem as if the steam-plough -was,' -before - many years are over, to put a stop to, the necessity for importation. Even though-the' price of wheat has ruled so low for some years past compareds ith.whatit. used' to-be. the prejudice amongst fainmers.in favour of growing this grain is still very~ ltrong, and the temptation to sow it on "soil' in 'a condition to give a large returni is very great,' especially where the land is- fully prepared to receive the. seed, and at the best time for sowing it; as is always :the case where autumn culture is fully at tended to; and the advantages of this last.are now.so widely.,recogniiied. tht, to render the early smashing-up -of the stiff soils possible, the steamploogh lit coming into greater demand: 'eaclh. year, The thorough disentegration oftthe soil; and exposure to the dry, warm: aira, r fontnd to communicate to it and unex pected degree of fertility,' particularly it glvin?' -go d rthbr to the younig plant previobsiii to't itremio cold of: winter; ,pnd on land thus broken up early:the weeds can be most effectually destroyed.
