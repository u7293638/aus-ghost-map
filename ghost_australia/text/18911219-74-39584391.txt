THE DOCTORS SHOOK THEIR HEADS. "I would give a million dollars for a stomach," said a wealthy American re cently. Now, a million dollars (.8200,000) is a deal of money, but he was not able to buy the article even at that price. Mr Thomas Gaskin, of No. 3 Poplar Row. Darley Abbey, near Derby, is not so rich as many, being a gardener, but he was ready enough to give all he had for one thing he hadn't got. Here is his story, and he shall tell it in his own way. Mr Gaskin goes on to say-" Up to eight years ago I had never lost an hour's work through sickness. In December, 3882, whilst living at Beeston, near Not tingham, my appetite fell away, I had dreadful pain after eating, a bad taste in my mouth, which would fill with water and slime, the latter so thick and sticky that I often had to remove it with my fingers. My chest used to ' fill up' and my throat would swell so I couldn't button my shirt at the neck. I vomited a great deal, chiefly a yellowish green phlegm, I had a racking cough, and would cough and strain till I bled at the nose, and the blood rushed out of my ears. I became ex hausted and short of breath and had to call the doctor, and was in bed five or six weeks. "I then went as out-patient to the Nottingham Hospital, and after attending there for six months was very little better. I got so thin that I was like a ghost walking about, and my friends said it was all up with me. For eighteen months I kept getting better, then worse, and at last the doctors recommended me to try a change of air. So I came to Darley Abbey and my former master gave me an indoor recommendation to the Derbyshire In firmary, Derby. I found, however, that all the beds in the hospital were full, and I saw my club doctor, and also two doctors at Derby. The first one said,' You are in a galloping consumption and must die; the other doctors, after sounding my lungs and chest, said nothing, but shook their heads. " Getting a trifle better my old master allowed me to do what little I could in his gardens and grounds; and some days I worked a little, and then would be away for a few days. Things went on like this until December, 1888, when I caught cold, got very short of breath, and broke down completely. I was always coughing and spitting up phlegm, sometimes as much as a teacupful at once, and was afraid to go to slee for fear thephlegm would choke me. At this time the whites of my. eyes turned yellow, and my eyes were bloodshot. My lips and mouth were dry and parched and I often brokp out into a cold clammy sweat. My tongue was like a piece of brown leather, and I could keep nothing down. I lost over a stone weight in three weeks. "I managed to get up for a few hours at a time, but was so weak I had to take hold of the furniture to move a few yards. I was always tired and weary, and sitting or lying, was never at ease and got no real rest. To weak to read I often sat for hoars looking at my hands-nothing bhut skin and bhone, and was so nervous- I couldn't bear the least noise, and the children at play quite upset me. " The doctor kept on attending me, lbut he said, 'I can do you no good ; I can only patch you up, because your lungs are die cased. I then gave over taking his medicine and tried everything I could hear of. One thing was a cough cure from London that cost 22s a bottle. iBut nothing did any good, and my friends who came to see me said, ' VWell yaou won' cough much longer, you have merely to prepare for another world.' "About the middle of March, 1889, a neighbour named Joseph Tatham, who works in ,. paper mills at Darley Abbey, said to me,' Tose, did you ever:try Mother Seigcl's Syrup ?' and told me how be had been cured after being in the hospital.; He spoke so much in praise of this medicine I 'Rset my wife to Derby and got a bottle-at Mr Smith's stor',, in Victoria-street. After the first dose I had an evacuation black as ink, and vomited. Then I fell asleep, and felt rested when I awoke. After taking the medicine for three days my breathing got easier, my food kept down, .and in a few days more I was able to go out for a short walk. By the end of a fortnight I went to see my master, who asked what had wrought the improvement, add I told him, as I tell every one, that Mother Seigel's Syrup had saved my life. I com menced work at once, and have never lost a day's work since. " Of course my strength did not return all at once, but after taking Seigel's Syrup for six months I was strong as ever in my life and have continued so ever since." In giving his consent to the publication of this remarkable statement, Mr Gaskin requests us to refer all doubters to him or to Mr Keetley, Head Gardener, Darley Abbey, who is acquainted with all the facta alleged. MIr taskin has lived, at Derley Abbey 22 years and bears an excellent reputation. Now, what was the complaint from which he suffered ? Not galloping consump. lion, certainly (as one of the doctors thought), or he would have galloped into his grave in less than three months. instead of growing worse for seven years. His complaint was chronic inflammatory dyspopia (or chronic gastric catarrh), which has lung symptoms like consumption, for which it, is so often ignorantly mistaken and wrongly treated. When the right remedy, t'other Seigel's Syrup, was used the disease yi;,lded, as all diseases of the digesltice ractdo.yield to that magnificent preparation. We heartily congratulate Mr Gaskin on his recovery, and commend the facts of his case to all thinking people.
