mtftp; ^rps. FKIDAY, MAY 26, 1871. " CRYING over spilt milk" is an exer cise which, although a rather common one, is not by any means wise or profitable; it is, however often indulged in by politicians and jour nalists. Such an exercise may the present tone taken by some of the newspapers and legislators of England be called, when, as many of them have lately been, speaking- of Eng land's national debt. The}7 speak of it as an incubus, a millstone about their necks, a Nemesis-in fact, any and every terrible name they can think of -and profess to be valorously ready to submit to an income tax of a shilling' in the pound for its payment. Its sum frightens them, although it is by no means a ghost. To be nearly £800,000,000 in debt seems to them something so awful, that they forget tlieir country has been more heavily in debt than it is now, with less means for paying it, and has not been very much hurt by the burden ; it has even paid a good sum off it, without very much being known or thought of it by the greater part of the nation. In the hands of wise legislators, of whatever party, no doubt it will be less in time. If it be not, then it is but another proof of the nation's trust in its go vernors and their system of governance, by allowing such a debt to remain almost without a wish for its cancella tion. While speaking of such debt, too, no one must forget that other nations have national debts, which for the last half century have been in creasing, while that of England has been decreasing in tbe same period. This difference also exists - that, whereas England's debt is payable to its own people, the debts of other nations have* been incurred, not to their own people, but chiefly to Eng land. In 1870 the debts of the follow ing nations were :-United Kingdom, £793,000,000 ; North Germany, £150,000,000; France, £518,000,000; Austria, £300,000,000 ; Russia, £300,000,000; Spain, £225,000,000; Italy, £257,000,000; United States, £477,000,000. Even the group of Australasian colonies among them owed something like 35 or 36 millions. One of those debts has increased to a much greater extent in tbe half-cen tury than the others (all have increased but England's, which has been paid off to the extent of nearly £200,000,000), that one is France's. It was but £70,000,000 in 1820 j in 1870 it was £518,000,000, or more than seven times as much. To this must be added the £200,000,000 indemnity which was demanded by Germany on account of the late war j there must also be added the different requisitions made by the conquerors upon those cities and towns which had been so unfortunate as to fall before their "blood andiron9 march. At present it can hardly be said accurately what money will be wanted to pay all those demands, but one would not be very wide of the mark in puttiug it down as at least £400,000,000," and this with France's previous debt (£518,000,000) will, make her present one larger than Eng land's is now, and perhaps larger than that lias ever been. To most people the prospect of France being- able to borrow four or fire hundred millions sterling' is, to say the least, an exces sively cloudy one. Previous to the war its people were far more heavily taxed than many oUiers of the great nations, and yet their income did not meet their expenditure by many mil lions of pounds. How, then, can they, who had found it difficult to make both ends meet, pay the interest on new loans to meet the demands made by the Grermans ? The interest on these new loans alone would amount to about £1 per head for every man, woman, and child on French soil. To pay tins, in addition to other imposts and taxes, with a devastated and temporarily un productive country, and a lessened population, is a task of which ont> may well doubt the possibility of accomplishment. But we are talking1 of interest-paying1, when the princi pal is not yet borrowed. With a Re publican Government (which in France is never more than an experiment) whose tenure of office is problematical, and other drawbacks likely to affect the security question, is it likely that the great bankers and financiers of Europe will be ready to lay out their money. The time has certainly been extended for payiiig the first instal ment of the indemnity; but if a debtor requires extra time for beginning1 to pay, how about finishing' ? We are not committing the fault mentioned at the commencement of this article, but simply enunciating a few of the facts and ideas on what we think are im portant matters.
