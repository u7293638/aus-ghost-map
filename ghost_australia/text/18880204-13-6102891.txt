3- THE AUSTRALIAN IN ASIA , j .. AND EUROPE. ? as Br J. JX a THE GREATEST OF SILVER MINES. AT LAUIUUM. One of the most noticeable private resi- trenches in the Grecian capital attracts the attention and provokes the remarks of strangers The question as to ownership leads to others of a biographical nature Effects naturally aroused inquiry as to causes, and that down even to such small matters can damaged eye The mansion is that of one Serpin, an adventurer in some novel mining at Laurium To this place there proves to be easy access by rail, and a visit is recommended as to something a stranger should see There are not in Greece the long distances to be travelled which trouble one in Australia and America, 'lo wherever a railway runs the trouble is nothing beyond those of a return ticket, an overcoat, and an umbrella 'The real trouble is that there are but so few railways made We discuss the war news while waiting for the tram It is that breathes mid Spezzia are in want of provisions, which Greek boats dare not take to them The Government have thus to telegraph to a vessel at Corfu to carry supplies to these outlying places, as also to Jiigino 'the affairs of Greece, like those of the late Mr. Micawber, appear in this way tcWbe coming to a crisis There is much that is Micuwbensh in the Greek character; The people seem to talk themselves into any and ever) belief as to what they may and will do in the way of warfare When, f he time shall come 'things mean while are getting financially to a very low ebb There is nothing like a war scare for closing up the pocket and rendering all pro port) not portable nearly valueless Quite (if useless, and unable to borrow anything, fie cheeriness of Micawber as yet con spicuously visible, and his big talk heard generally) To occupy further spare time we visit a free school in what proves to be its holiday hour A play ground of little girls is here to be seen among whom I may distribute the bright new pennies, or drachmas of which I happen *~ nave a pool shoot This incident would not be memorable save for the names of some of these modern Greeks be pleasant!) producing those of their ancestors I make notes in this way of such prettinctiees as German, Olympia, and Clytie These are recipients of the bright coppers Bend on a I> and, Thisbe Hero, and Leda all for the 1) kc object Then Medea comes with Her 'tense and Marina-the latter bringing with her special memories of " Pericles, Prince of Tyre " I ask of my guide if he can find a Kal) dor or Paletot among the number but those Greek names, famous as they are with us, have no representatives here. I learn afterwards something more about Greek girls It is not etiquette here to congratulate napa upon the birth of a daughter. If there were ever families in which girls do not count, ' Greece in the country in which to Ionic for them. The French fashion of parental I) arranged marriages is here intense heat Miss I Electra, or throne, is never consulted about it-or her inclinations either This trouble is brought about by every wife being expected to bring a dowry Now, dowries impoverish the parental packet Captain Macheath wondered " how any man on earth could ever read a daughter the trouble with him being that she would so " (ling herself away in matrimony) Greek daughters have not that opportunity, as paper money is wanted with them and they don't get taken without the Greek, by will shortly be remarked being of a dispassionate nature When the Grecian father has got his daughter of his hands his troubles are over and hers begin she is allowed no voice in anything save singing to the baby She is not allowed to go out save in company with her husband of mother, and there is no law in Greece, as in England, as to the thickness of the stick with which recalcitrant wives may be Yveltetl by their very much lords and masters. In on further allusion to the Greeks and their fashions the man and his dress were, rightly enough, selected for first notice he is the best-looking, and the most dress). It is he, and not one, who pinches in the waist, witnesses for flue street, and shows most of vanity and pride of life In this respect the Greek adheres to Nature's preferences. It is the lion, which sports the decoration of the Empire, the turkey cock has the dressy bend Rear, and the peacock the brilliantly coloured and fjatly-bestarrcd tail, The world has taken its cues from Greece, with Europe adopts its ideas and examples that of feminine beauty included But womanly beauty was with the Greeks an ideal matter, as wan mostly all else of their wondrous world Of all that the Egean has produced in its many lanes of beauty, its most beautiful production was that of Aphrodite, drawn from its waters by Greek imagination, and then, thenceforth, and for ever, made the world a type of feminine loveliness. Apelles-the Greek combination of our Lawrence and DJlllttis- devoted his life to pic during her sculptors, as we see by their efforts found here and there, at lYleloa, Capua, and elsewhere, worked. but with BitmUr aim Had the Greek women been commonly beautiful, then feminine heart) would have been less noticed, and the worship of Venus been probably unknown. Hut the Venus of the Greeks is of Grecian type still, and that notwithstanding all that painters and sculptors have done towards .f'dcahsing her The Grecian features are here in their perfected form Nations and peoples' have every where created their goods in their own image, naturally enough unable to imagine anything else as being better " The Itlllop gods have Ithlop lips Dark eyes an 1 woolly hair, The Grecian lode are like the Greeks, Blue-eyed, thin slipped, and fair The Greeks are of a dispassionate nature and of intellectual tastes St Paul's description of them is a true one-all or the Athenians spent their time in nothing city butcher to tell or hear some new thing" 'They areas little inclined to manual labour as are the Hebrew race, preferring v York in which the head and must play a greater part than the muscles It is for this reason, perhaps, among others, that none of the Jewish perSuasion are found as settlers throughout the length and breadth of the land A great contrast in this respect exists between the Greek and the Hungarian-both equally proud and disinclined to manual labour The Ilungaiian has let the Jew monopolise everything Greeks were, in the wise provisions of their Rods, made of this dispassionate nature that they might sit out the performance of Greek tragedies. The theatres of Greece are closed wherever I go, but I should not go to see a Greek tragedy if any were performing I saw none play of that kind, and saw it twice. The season of the second time was that after an interval of forty two years, I had forgotten the previous effect Antigone," reproduced BY Covent- garden Theatre in 1893 was again produced in Melbourne in 1887 'The effect of it, with me, accounts, in one way, for the theatres being closed here. Another of the Greek habits is, perhaps, to be in like way accounted for. 1 ask \ "Why do these Greeks, sitting about, have so often a string of beads in their hands Frethey Roman Catholics, and counting them for a religious sense ' ' 1 had noticed this custom but little at first, but it is by repeti- tion forced upon one's attention Explanation is given that such custom is not a practice in the roster) exercise way of the Catholics, and has no religious wearing. It is but a habit of the Greeks to carry this circlet of beads with them as men elsewhere carry ornamental stn kB, as something to handle and lister only. As a down cast Yankee will whittle away at a stick with a knife for sure occupation of his fingers, so do many Greeks play with beads upon a string, and mostly so when engaged in conversation Here is one seated in a chair on the footpath, lacing in a fiasco table of a case, discussing the war aspects. All the while his fingers are going slowly over his head, as if 80 doing helped his thoughts and utterances. I purchase one of these rosaries to try the effect, but percieve that, like many other things, the help to be got from it must come from custom and not naturally Hamlets friends, in telling him of the ghost's visit, say that its time of talk with them was " while anyone with reasonable haste might count a hundred " These beads would likely have been useful to one in doing so Their use can be recommended to youths who wait about for long at stage doors for the rest of their Special pots, in place of the gnawing of the tops of their canes, or as a change from such occupation I am told that if Parliament was in session I might see many of the 2-10 deputies there engaged in this lingering of their beads, and that whether they were sitting listening, or Speaking in debate The more excited they become in speech the faster does the head fingering go on There is some sense, I perceive, in the practice, and especially so for silent members and those dull of bearing It has caused me wonderment ofttimes bow members of Parliament, on the back benches especially, manage to keep awake through the dull, dreary hours in which a man is saying at long length what could be better said briefly The head practice might come in very well in such situations, and be as useful as are knitting needles to some women whom I have seen in railway carriages, working in the dark with them One Liuiriura excursion is a shorter one than that to Corinth, or, what is all the same, level so Of the stations passed on the road is one from which a visit can be made to a monastery of some note A visit to a monastery must however, give way to one to a man with any Australian He, likely enough, does know something about mines perhaps too much His knowledge in that way may be similar to that of him who did t believe in ghosts he had seen too many of them ' 'the mines to which we are bound are what none of olden time the famous silver mines of Mount auratum, situate in a range of hills running down to the sea shore. This part of the most viz wind set in past times, to live in each; range was much in width, peace can save in its rocky formation veins of lead ore containing much of silver, a yield which, when worked by slave labour as it was largely enriched the country. It is interesting to read that this valuable produce was, by the Government at one time philanthropically distributed among the citizens of Athens Its liberal application in this way was stayed only by its being voted for patriotic war purposes against the Persians, and for building the fleet which was to face those invaders at Salamis has Launum range was the broken XTilSs of old Greece, and contained a lode as rich, or richer than the Comstock one. The miners left great heaps of scoria, taken from the workings as evidence of their long labours The example of the Greek Government in the public distribution of this silver might be followed elsewhere, to which probably Parliamentary attention might be called in Victoria The proposition would probably be popular The slave labour employed at Launum was something similar to that by which the Spaniards made the mines of Peru pay so well The profits of Australian mines cannot, however, be realised in this manner Those who doubt it the world has bettered in its way) a can be silenced at once on this slave labour aspect of the question Launum is the one place in Greece to be specially visited by an Australian It is to such what a North American Indian would call an old stamping ground In its aspect it is a mining camp, all mines and miners Here are the puddling machines and the crushing ones, and here are the steam engines to work them, and the smutty faced stokers and engineers Vast changes are also here and of horizontal position too and here are wheelbarrows and waggons for bringing the ore to the machines Launum is the silverton of Greece, or to speak with proper respect, Silverton is the Launum of Australia The mining work done here is mainly what Australia diggers term ' surfboard, That which m past ages was brought up from the deeply sunk pits all around here was submitted to some rough process of those times for the extraction from it of value only 1 or other value if it is then not Known What remained of the ore so treated was piled about in heaps here, much as is seen to be now done with the fate. or talimba of the main,; produce in Australia and other auriferous quarters Hiebe heaps of stuff are soon overgrown with vegetation, and, like other of Greece's valuable "finds, have to be uncovered to the eye it appears but as gravel mixed with clinkers and cinders, and little likely to prove as "payable" as it does 1 see this stud brought in cartloads and tilted into the machines for washing it for such is the best process to which it is submitted to the large hoppers it is all cast without selection of any Kind It thence passes to cylinders screened so as to retain only the larger pieces of it Swirling about in the water here that which passes through goes to another cylinder screened with lesser sized openings, and then this second) wished stuff passes on to a third c) hilder, and then to a fourth one. It now appears, as passing away from here to be nothing else but water, and any deposit which it had held must have been left behind It is not so, however, and very far from being so This water is full of particles of lead, which deposit themselves partly on the trough down which they run, and residually upon the floor awaiting them below from here, and from the troughs, this line deposit is scraped together and formed into bricks to be taken to the smelting works awaiting them into the furnaces of these works go also all which has been left of ore in the washing cylinders Tho whole of the gravel and cinders, clinkers and stones, so thrown in become quickly calcined here, and an) thing metallic m thorn fulls as a deposit to the bottom of the furnace This result then goes through another process, or firing, by which nothing of silver left by the miners of olden time is obtained by the present Laununi Mining Company 1 it by this is but washing the callings ' ' I exclaim and it is such work as in Australia general lily falls to the share of China \--> 1 I. o Fry ,"",) driver krvmovrnr or men out). It is too good work, However, to be left to any Chinese in this quarter, to which, by the way, they do not appear to have as yet come. 'The absence of the Chinese is as noticeable in Greece as that of the Jews, when one has seen how much the Mongolians are distributed elsewhere about the world. The produce of these lead mines is quite surprising to one when the figures are asked for, as the) very soon ure A royalty of no less than 15 per cent has to he paid to the Government by the company. The labourers whom I will not dignity) as miners-receive between "I and 3s per day of 10 hours of wages, the engineers and smelters getting something luther for pay "And what is paid as dividend'" I ask, and learn that the shareholders got a clear b per cent, have done so for years past, and, as things look now, are likely to do so for a dozen or score of years yet to come The lead goes, of course, to that world's market for all produce, Great Britain Nothing is wasted here. The smoke of the smelting furnace and the vapour from them is drafted along a slanting chimney, running away in that position against the side of a lull. This chang) is, I am told more than half a mile long, and it looks it. What issues from it is caught, and treated in some way by which more metal is got from it "Getting blood out of nations" will now no longer be to moan incredible thing Getting silver and lead deposits out of smoke, drawn off at such long distance, seems equally as improbable. No more sneers from me about things ending in smoke " 'They end valu- ably that we) in this quarter It needs a long chimney to carry away the fumes of lead smelting, and all labour at Such workBliould be well paid-it money can make up for loss of health and life. I say nothing whatever while at Lauriuin about the pale faces I see there, nor the more sickly looks of others. It is not polite to tell people that they are not looking well it is at most as bad as telling them that they are not well looking. But these of Luurium pay heavily for living as they do, us do all who work any where among the fumes of lead or in their neighbourhood The Government who get the 45 per cent out of such labour seem not to consider that it is human life, as much as lead, which brings such returns to the exchequer Macaulay tells in his day of " lToratiua," of one whose 800 slaves Bickened in some named mines The population of Laurium is not as large as that, nor are they slaves in the sense in which Macaulay wrote. They suffer, however, in a lesser felt way from Bundar causes | Near to these " Surfacing " works are the "drives" into the old mines from which the ancients obtained their ore. It was, however, the surfacing works now belonging to the Athenian Company wind made the wealth of the Italian speculator whose house I had noticed in Athens These works were originally the property of a foreign company, buttheGreeks are a much spoiled and very fractious people mother things than politics They cannot endure that foreigners should make profit out of their possessions, and so brought pressure to bear on the foreign company until sold out to the present native one. They are content for the present to Jet foreigners Frenchmen and others labour in the old workings, on 45 per cent tribute It will be, no doubt, made unpleasant for these people, also, if they do too well and let the Greeks know it Such feeling is not, I believe, confined to the people of Greece it has been exhibited by others, and elsewhere. These old "drives," and the extensive underground Workings to which they lead, recall to one the descriptions by Sir Francis Head, in his KotUjh Jlide Across the Pampas, of similar mines inspected by him in South America there is a rumour about that in one of these old workings at Laurium a great "find" was made of valuable ore, collected there and covered up for removal at Gorae time-which never came, apparently, to those intending to profit by it There have been many things left about in the world in the like way Witness to that is the half finished sacred bull left covered up at Memphis, and disinterred thence by the late Trenchexolorer M. Mariette The workmen who were to Dash it were summoned away suddenly and never returned A reference now comes in aptly to what Xenophon wrote of these silver mines in his essay "On the Means of Improving the Revenues of the State of Athens. ' He was of opinion that great profit might be let drawn from them, though as he writes " That they were wrought in very ancient times is well known to all, for assuredly no one attempts to specify at what time they began to be formed. For though the earth containing silver has been so long dug and cost up, consider how small a portion the heaps which have been thrown out are of the hills that remain still in their natural state and that contain silver underneath them Nor does the space of ground that is dug for silver appear to be at all diminished, but to be per petually extended in a wider circuit, and during the time that the greatest number of men were in the mines no one was ever in want of occupation, but there was a was s more work than enough for the hands employed, for when but few are engaged in digging and searching but little treasure is found, but when many are employed a far greater quantity of silver ore is discovered " He argues, next, in answer, seemingly, to the suggestion that there may be too much of a good thing, and in that way too much silver got. " In regard to silver mines the more silver ore is found, and the more silver is extracted therefrom, the greater is the number who devote themselves to mining Of furniture, when people have got enough of it for their houses they do not care for business ditional supplies, but nobody has ever yet had so much silver is not to desire an in crease of it, and if people have a super abundance they heard it, and are not less delighted with doing so than with putting it to use When communities are in a nourishing condition people have very great use for money, for men are ready to be at an expense in horses, carriages, houses, and furniture, and women for expensive dresses and ornaments " On the bl metallic question he says - "liTT, hand I now hint trial 1 IS hint If anyone should say that gold is not less useful for such purposes than silver, I do not dispute the truth of the assertion , but I am aware, at the same time, that gold, if it shows itself in great quantities, becomes less valuable and renders silver of a higher price. We should, therefore, with confidence send as many workmen as possible with the silver mines, and continue operations fully trusting that the yield of ore will not fail and that silver will never lose its value, The slate appears to know this, for it allows any foreigner that pleases to work in the mines on paying the same duty as the citizens In a footnote it is stated that this duty was a 11th part only of the profits Evidence enough is supplied in this smaller royalty of how much more liberal handed these old Greeks were in their dealings, not only with their own people, but with the foreigner Xenophon goes on to argue that the state should enrich itself, and Athena improve its revenues, as private individuals were doing by employing slave labour in the mines He instances the good thing that is being made of it by one INtetus, the most sanctified of men, and one much looked up to in that character this very good man kept a thousand slaves employed in the Latinum mine He leased them at so much a day to a slave driver named Soeina, who stipulated for having the number kept up by further supplies at the same rate as the pestiferous lead fumes kept killing them off This was a favourite way of profiting by the mines, in thus supplying slave labour Xenophon in stances that one Htppontcua let out, on similar terms, 100 and one Philemon 200 slates He concludes thus -' And if what I propose be carried into effect, the only new point in it would be that as these private in die ideas thus by slave labour, secure them selves a constant revenue so the state should also possess slates to the number of three for each Athenian citizen Attention must be given to the last paragraph, which Xenophon thus worked up to His meaning was that each Athenian citizen might hire from the Government three of such slaves, and let them out at an improved price to the slave drivers of the silver mines he goes on to argue the sound principles of such proposition in a statesmanlike style, considering all sides of the question except the one from which the slaves doubtlessly viewed it The Launum mines were twice worked over for Silver produce by) the ancient Greeks by other evidence than that quoted we learn of the great enrichment of the Greeks from such source. When turned from that purpose by the eloquent advice of Themistocles, the stream of wealth was, we see, diverted fortunately to the defence of the nation-to the building of the fleet which so famously served Greece and its people in crushing the Persian invaders Not all relating to Launum is told until mention is made of an American company) at work there. Practical people though they be in all things, they are not here on a mercenary venture They are archaeologists, and, in such scientific pursuit, are finding their reward, is zealous labourers mostly do The) have an covered something as valuable in their eyes as metalliferous ore Here among the hills of Launum, at what I am told is Thoncos, has been found a theatre now in course of being opened up, which is different in meaning to the theatrical term of re opening When all of it is brought to daylight it may prove as worthy the labour bestowed upon it as is that wonder of a theatre of Bacchus told of us at the rear of Athens a Aero police On the way down from Lnuuum I ask about the brigands and banditti, for which Greece has had a bad name Kuli in one's memory is the ghastly picture of half 11 dozen decapitated heads, given by the illustrated London papers some years back rib those of Greek brigands. " Have Hadgi Stavros, the King of the Mountains, and till his followers met the same fate '' ' I ask I am told that such is believed to be the case, and that Greece will no longer be troubled by these impediments to travelling in its territory The terrible retribution taken upon those whose fate I had seen pictured is believed to have been conclusive of the brigand business These bandits had murdered some tray ellers Messrs. Herbert Lloyd and Viner whom they detained for a ransom which was not forthcoming. " Where did that occur ' "Not further from Athens than where you have been travelling on your visits to Corinth and Launum " It was on the route to Marathon that these travellers were stopped in less distance from town in the opposite direction from it to where we have been visiting. Whether war troubles may lead to a renewal of this disgraceful brigandage has yet to be aT
