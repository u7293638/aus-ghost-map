LIBERAL. (To the Editor of the Bendigo Advertiser.) Sir,â€”As your correspondent, Mr. VV. (Jook, cannot soar up abovo the usual clap-trap style of so-called "Liberals " generally, I do not feel called upon to draw swords but with those worthy of my steel. His own circle won't recognise him again after the disconnected sen tences he has put forth in print; aud the refe rence ; to holy writ the ghost of Balaam will gurely haunt him with until he has changed front. 1 renlly did tliink my opponent could argue between right and wrong; but I have boon only mistaken with him, M with the usual class of National Reform Leaguers and Liberals, who have tho strut and impudenco only of sotting' up their sides against tho science of political economy in opposition to the most learned statesman. Tlio machinery for working out tho good government of this boautiful colony ro ijuiiT.s intelligent minds to represent tho pooplo; but with my experience of "liberals" in tho colony and this district especially, if they wero placed on uphill and eompeLiiivo work, tho occupation would bring thom to beggary. Tho world iu fact would stand still under thoir guidance). Thank goodness tho goneral election is at hand, and wo shall then see whether in telligent business men workers will not bo in a majority. I still beg to subscribo myself a be liever in tho natural lino of tho scionce of FREEDOM IN" EVERYTHING.
