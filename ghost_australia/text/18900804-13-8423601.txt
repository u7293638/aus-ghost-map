BIJOU THEATRE. "THE BALLOON." There was an overflowing audience at this theatre on Saturday evening, when Um bill presented two attractive features, the one an old favourite, and the other a new piece. Although the first " Kerry has held possession of the stage for a period of 30 years, it has lost nothing whatever of its power to interest and to charm It is, indeed, a masterpiece of its kind, and is never likely to grow old fashioned, because it depicts pos Bible incidents, actual personages, and real emotions, such as the early Greek dramatists | or the playwrights of the year 2000 might select with every confidence that they would touch sympathetic chords in the hearts of any audience When the comedy was first produced in Paris, in 1854, Th√©ophile Gautier compared it to a fire because of the great variety of tones by which a single idea had been embellished and illustrated by the accomplished writer, Mme de Gerardus I he grief of the mother, of the daughter, of the old servant, and of the friend, he observed, " springing from the same cause, are differently manifested, and produce that variety in unity, which is the perfection of art And this dramatic def d move is capitally interpreted by the company at the rJijou Mr G Boucicault, jun , who succeeds his father in the part of Kerry, the Irish domestic shows that he has also inherited his Fathers histrionic talent, and weaves the threads of humour and pathos into an agreeable and artistic tissue As Mrs Desmond, Mrs Robert Brough exhibits in the early portion of the comedy, the silent sorrow which finds expression in a restful aspect and a subdued, demeanour, rather than in words, and helps to accentuate by the force of contrast, the sudden outburst of powerful emotion which occurs towards the close of the scene, in which Mr Cecil Ward plays up to her with effective warmth, as the returned husband ; while the subordinate parts of the doctor, Captain Coldham, and Kate find adequate exposition in the hands of Mr Cathcart, Mr Chichester, and Miss Pattie Browne respectively The second piece, entitled '"The Balloon, played for the first time in this city on Saturday evening, is the joint production of Messrs. J ii Dandy and 2 Munville leon and was brought out originally at 'derry s Theatre in November 1883 It belongs to the some class as "'1 he barrister, " The Pickpocket, " Confusion,' and other three act farces The incidents are wildly improbable, the situa tions grotesquely so, and the characters harmonise with the incidents and situations , but the inn is fast and furious, and people leave the theatre with aching sides and with faces that look all the brighter for two hours of almost unrestrained hilarity In the matter of author craft, the first two acts are particularly good-the third is somewhat attenuated The action of the piece entirely passes in the consulting room of Dr Flynn (Mr Robert Brough) at Dover, who is represented for dramatic purposes is one of those old fashioned practitioners who dispense as well as prescribe He is to be married next day to Grace Wentworth (Miss E Temple), niece to Mrs lit/john (Miss Romer) and Dr Boyton (Mr G L Gordon) is going to take his practice during the honeymoon Mrs Fitzjohn, who is suffering from indigestion comes to the young doctor for advice and medicine and receives both Presently enters an old friend, Captain Cameron (Mr Lyndal), an amateur aeronaut, who announces that he is about to cross the Channel in a balloon Dr Glynn is suddenly called away, and a Miss Vere (Miss P Browne) appears upon the scene, and, miss taking the captain for the doctor, asks him to prescribe for a favourite St Bernard dog Cameron, who had previously fallen in love with the young lady, finding that the dog is his chief rival makes up a strong dose of Lqi Struck and leaves the bottle on the table Meanwhile a certain Mrs Rtppendale (Mra It Brough) turns up Glynn had met her in Rome, had believed her to be a widow, and had rashly made her an offer of marriage, and are now appears to claim fulfilment of the promise to add to the doctors troubles, a diverting old scoundrel, named Aubrey i Fitzjohn (Mr O W. Anson), appears upon the scene. He is acquainted with the escu made in Rome, and it enables him to levy blackmail on the doctor His immediate silence is purchased for the sum of five pounds and a bottle of brandy As soon as he has withdrawn into another room Miss Vera rushed in, exclaiming, "She's dead! ' Glynn, glancing at the bottle of strychnine on his writing table, immediately concludes that he has made a fatal mistake, and has poisoned the aunt of his Junee c Rushing from the house in the wildest agitation, he jumps into the balloon, and when the curtain falls he is drifting across the Channel in the direction of the French coast Next day the papers report the wreck of the balloon and the supposed death of Dr Glynn. Meanwhile Aubrey 1 Fitzjohn, who is the husband of the lady so named, believing her to have been poisoned, hastens to possess himself of her portable property, in the shape of silver plate, c, and deposits the portmanteau containing it man alcove m Dr Glynn's room There, also, Grace princes all the presents she has received from the man to whom she was engaged to be married, and leaves a note on his table saying, "Look into the alcove" Mrs Fitzjohn enters soon afterwards, and, catching the sound or her husband's voice, retreats into the recess Suddenly Dr Glynn reappears He was not drowned, but deposited in a prickly hedge on dry land, and a very dilapidated aspect he presents, He reads the note, draws aside the curtain which screens the alcove, and is astounded at the discovery of what he believes to be the ghost of the woman whom he imagines that he has inadvertently poisoned Happily he is convinced of the vital presence of the lady, and his mental sufferings are further relieved by the discovery that Aubrey Titijohn ia Ure Chippendales first husband, so that he is thus delivered simultaneously from the persecutions of the pretended widow and from the rapacity of her trying lord and master As a matter of course, Dr (Glynn makes his peace with the young lady to whom he is engaged, and Captain Cameron soothes the wounded feelings of Miss Vere by presenting her with another doer, in return for which he receives the gift of her hand 'the success of a piece of this kind depends even more upon the quality of the acting than upon the merits of the com- position itself The action must be rapid and an intermittent The delivery of the dialogue must be characterised by an impetuous volubility Every rejoinder and every repartee must come twanging off the tongue, like an arrow from a tense bowstring, and the audience must be kept in a simmer of mirthful enjoyment varied by occasional explosions of boisterous laughter from beginning to end All these requirements are fulfilled by the company at the Bijou, where the two characters upon whom is thrown the onus of the piece are exceptionally well filled Mr Robert Brough excels in the portrayal of mental perplexity and bewilderment and of that kind of anguish of mind is turn is almost tragical in real life, and yet is so intensely comic on the stage From the moment Mrs Ilippendale appears the poor wretch s position resembles that of the proverbial road under the harrow, but the more his feelings are lacerated the greater in the hilarity of the spectators Mr Brough s narrative of his aerial voyage was one of his happiest efforts, and was warmly applauded As a piece of eccentric character acting we do not think Mr Anson has done anything better than the bibulous blackmailer Voice, make up, gestures, and costume all contributed to the strength and verisimilitude of the portrait of the thoroughly unscrupulous but extremely diverting vagabond Mrs Brough plays an unamiable and ungemal part as earnestly and eileen cry as she does those characters in which the audience are best pleased to see her Rhine and Mr Lyn dale rattles through the role of Captain Cameron so as to make it contributory to the velocity of the general movement of the piece, white the completeness of the performance is also promoted by the efforts of the other ladies and gentlemen concerned There was a call at the end of each act, and a double one at the close of the second the same bill will be repeated every evening until further notice
