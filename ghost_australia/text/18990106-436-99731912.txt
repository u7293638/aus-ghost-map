A GHOST'S VENGEANCE. The Cock-lane ghost is a very famous one, perhaps chiefly from the fact that old Samuel Johnson was largely concerned in it. Here is the story in brief. In 1756 Mr. K., of Norfolk, married Miss F.L. In less than a year the wife died, aud her sister Fanny canoe to keep house. Fanny and Mr. K. were married after a while, though at first Mr. K., not liking the match, ran away from his ardent siater-in-law. Aiter their marriage they went to live in Cock lane, in the house of Mr. Parsons, clerk of St. Sepulchre's. During Mr. K.'s absence little Elizabeth Parsons, the landlord's daughter, slepfc with Mrs. K. Both of them ' were disturbed by strange scratohings and rappings.' The landlord's wife thought the cobbler next door was at the bottom of it. Having quarrelled with Parsons, Mr. K. and his wife Fanny went to live in Cler kenwell, where she died of smallpox, ns the physician and apothecary testified. After 18 months (why was the ghost silent so long ?) the noises in the Cock-!ane house began again. A girl who was attending the medium — Mary Fraser was her name — suggested that the ghost should be talked with by means of raps, one rap meaning ' yes,' two ' no.' Shrewd girl that Mary Frazer. The ghost rapped out its message. Fanny had been poisoned by Mr. K. with red arsenic in a draught of pui-1, for which Fanny, it ap peared, had a liking. The vindictive ghost added that it. — we mean she — wished to see It. hanged. Then followed public ex aminations of the ohild, ot which Dr. John ' con, among other coiobrities, was present , and the end of it was that Parsons, Mary Frazer, and several others were tried a' the Guildhall and convicted of a conspiracy on July 10, 1762.
