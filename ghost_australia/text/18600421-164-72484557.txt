BROKEN SLUMBERS. A fearful outcry rends the vista round," A piercing bitter shriek, as when a being lost Or tortured to the utmost of his life, Outpours his lamentation, as his strength, Gives up the contest and succumbs : Deep groans and wails, as though departed ghosts Had come lamenting o'er the crime : I,-who that dreadful note, so fraught with woe Did hear, and shuddered as its accents fell With curdling Â«ound of horror on mine ears Did tremble, as -with hasty step I flew To seek the cause, and aid perchance to give. ' What sounds are those ?' I cried to one I met, Whose sage and calm appearance spoke his ?worth ' What dreadful deed is being done that shrieks And groans so sad fill up the air of night ?' He gazed, and smiled, as in his accents calm He said ' Tis but the cats upon the roof.' G. B. M.
