Spirit, bu't in;the historica'l . and other portions of,Scripture they wroteund?der, his guidance anid superin tendence. Thus, ouu?~ blessed Lord assured'the apostles thait ,. the Holy Ghost should bring all things 'to their remeim= brance."' This,-as they were frail: men:like dur.,?= selves, was iecessary to enable them to hand down:=: to: posteriity, 'after .his 'disease, his: sayings and '% lhi doings; while, again, he. tells theniitht i',the?'. r: Holy: Ghost. should guide them into dil/ iruth.,.':'; Tlris was likewise equally necessary, that they: as: teachers of his will- should not be guilty of'pro:: pogating. error, and that: He, the=Spirit, should abide with them for ever, not merely by occasionial : effusions,.. but: that ?He should;, as ";teachers of ', the divine will, sbe their continual guide :. SNow, sir, the question is, were tlese promises" of Christ fulfilled `or inot. You believe :his' Di-> vinity, you' rmust therefore: believe tliht they were fulfilled.; In confirmation of this,'-we arelnoti however, left to beg the -uestion the aostles; declare' themselves <commissiond: to'l'preach sal. nation in His?iname, hnd :ini support ,of' their:; authority, 'to 'ork miliracles,-signs, andivoridrs and to possess th'e gifts 6of' the, HIoljR Gliost.':, ; Hebrews, xi. 4. : Could they'have'ippeale'd ?-iin ,' this way in"'tlie'face of the world if they weren not actually so empowered-so gifted ?: But: ka an additional proof that they were so gifted, we liave . in the 'New Testiment some most 'important iid clear, prophecies written 'by these 'men-=an evi?? l dence too frequently overlooked by :Christianiijn'4 reading the Epistles. We' have, ini cinn'exiioii: with Daniel, the prophecy-of St: Paiul;, in tivo;of"`'?, his Epistles` respecting the man of sin; we -?v?? the 'same- prophecy carried' out by Jo hn',ih'tlih book of Revelation we have inmthe Epistles' of St. Pauil the clearest'predictions of the restoratioli of' the Jews, arid of theri 'rise Tof infidelity (the: :same prediction'1i~iihig carieddbut' bt iSt Johf?," ' of a :general..spirit of instiboridination the pre-::. vailence of ,false teachers, and' other: defections:: . from ChGristiani practice;: in the writings;:of St., Peter, John and J ude,we lhav;e like remarkable pre; - dictions, togetheir: with a view of the 'estruction ' bf the .world by fire/'and of the day of judgment; ; whilein the.Apocalypse, which you seem to treat as an .Eastern:. piece, of. poetry because' of its, imagery, we have some of the most asfounding predictionis thatcan be'conceived,-the fate of the seven churches of Asia is clearly described-the rising of the false ,proph'et-the harlot of Babyloir; -the dismemberment of the.r Turkish power--.; the.-persecutions of the church- the spread and. triumph' of the Gospel-together with a number; of prophecies, tbo numerous for me to mention, forming a most intontestible proof thaotthese men spoke, as they were,:moved by the Holy Chost,. But, in addition to all this, we have their own frequentr' and`i constant declaration, that " they, speak not with enticing'or persuasible words of man's 'isdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and obfpower, and that God had revealed (those truths they taught) unto us (as apostles or' teachers) by hlis Spirit," " Now, we (we apostles or teachers, I presume,) have not the spirit of the world; but the. irit wliic 'is of God."--It wilt U, rs Gd - i\ i'e?een throughout the different Epistles that'th'e, .'?ostles continually declare themselves under'the: guidance of the Spirit and the 'teadching of God,. as "the servants of Jesus Christ; so that unless we deny the promise 6F hlirist-unless we "dei?y the chain of p~rophedies contained in the New Testament-- nless we ,deny the oft-repeated declarations of the apostles, that they .were .-taught, guided, and preserved by the Holy Ghost, I see no other possible conclusion we c'a t come to but that we have in :these $criptures a' declaration of the mind of Gol, by iris Spirit through the instrumentality of man. ' :. .I have said 'nothing of the remttrkable ipredir-e tions of-our Saviour, nor of the many predictions: fulfilled respecting him, .as hand.ed ,down to 'us in the ,Gospels, because you?acknowledge the di ' inity of' Christ, -and also seem toacknowledge tihe vercity'of:.the Gospels; ,neither have ,I :en-: '1tirged 'upon the -power. of miracles ..and 'the ,evii. dences we have of their having -beefi:perfonmed, because some of the greatest objectors Ito ,Christ-~ "anity have conceded the question, and 'I believe you will not deny it. " We have inthe New Testament writings then, prophecy and niracles, two of the'highest evidlences that can be given tf, supernatural communion with.God, anid ,of the. r~velation from him." I?In-examining the ulinternal evidences ,t'f the' V.Nw'.Te'stamerit wriitings, splce will ot ly: illow :me to enumerate them; first we find these writ-' 'iigs.to contain an exhibition of themnost sublime Sdoetrirnes, whidch are confirmed :to is by the most .ositive ;facts-doctrines, such as':philosophy for; ;reason, with all'their boasted powers, never could attain unto-the perfections:of God-thie fall of .i?ian rhis redemption .through :the:.incarnation a:.,:acscrifice :.of 'his only Son,-the mystery of ?-God.: manifested 'in the ;flesh-?-f his sufferings, Sdeath, and ; resurrection-the operations of the' Holy Ghost--the renewal 'of man Ltoxholiness, he 'resurrection of :the body, :and the day of jiudg-i ment,-&c.; "When our.
