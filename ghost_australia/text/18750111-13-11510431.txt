In the absence of all other topics of poll tical interest, the escapadeB of Mr Diarael and Mr Gladstone severally havo given ampi employment to our tongues and pens Thi few words dropped by the Pnme Minister a tho Guildhall Banquet innocently, I behove and without any amtre pensée, have boei taken up and explained, and commentée upon and expanded, till they have becomi swollen into something portentous Wha would have become of ua if The Times hac not been commissioned to say that Mr Disraeli meant nothing, I do not know Probably the German tleet would have re ceived orders to leavo Wilhelmshafen, 01 Bismarck would have sent overa detachment of Uhlans to take us into custody or tilt Emperor would at tina moment be deBpatch ing pious telegrams to Augusta from thesi shores The worst of it ia, that the explana hon having been given, tho matter lookB toi tunes worse than ever it did That ternbli gloss has only lont new meanings hithertt unsuspected to the text The wrath of th< Germans has been appeased, only to le loose the flood of Gallic sarcasm and in vective " See what you have brought upor yourselves now, you English " cries tbi French journalist, "by your base deser tion of Trance Our humiliation, great as n is, is not so great as yours We fought, a least, before we weTO humbled You wen humbled before >ou fought You have beer compelled to lick the dust before Bismarck You dare not speak your mind boforo the despot even m your Guildhall ancient shrint of liberty, with the effigies of your Pitts and your Wellingtons around you and in thf presence of the Lord Major himself Bah Serve you nght, you insolent and solusl islanders ' ' All this is excessively absurd, but a good deal of it baa been brought upon us by our selves, and we deserve it M hy on earth should a w ord hove been said in explanation of Mr Disraeli's speech ? Lither he meant, in the comparison of the British working mon to tho foreign nobleman, to refoi to the case of Count Arnim, or he did not If he did not, there was nothinf to explam If he did, he should havt stuck to it By going through thif elaborate process of explanation, ho hoc invested the incident with an importance which it net or would otherwise havo pos sessed. Not to speak of the clumsy manuel m which the explanation was made, the ab surd distinction which was drawn between what was arbitrary and what was legal (as ii a thing could not be both arbitrary and legal), to Bay anything at all in the nature of fl communiqué was a mistake The explanation was certain to give nse to oven more mis conceptions than the ongmal spooch People cannot help aBking since when we have got mto the habit of explaining away our after dinner phrases for the benefit of foreign powers? There were a good roany who read Mr DiBraelis Bpeech with the greater plea Bure because of this supposed Bpecial refer- ence to Count Arnim Why should wo bo depnved of this pleasure ' Tho Conservatives who hove been bragging hitherto of thoir Bpinted foreign policy, must bow their heada with Bhnme when the Liberals ask, "Is this then a specimen of the new spirit in which you are to conduct foreign affairs ' ' The Spec tator for once is nght in declanng that had Mr. Gladstone been the hero of thisincidont, there would have been no end to tho sar casms and the invectives which would have been poured upon his unhappy head. Another humiliation ! would havo boon the cry More Bunenders ' More humble pie . As if emulous of his rival and detormmed to keep pace with him before the public eye, Mr Gladstone also has had his blunder and given us something to talk about The "Ex- postulation' has puzzled both fnends and enemies, and the storm which it has raised is still raging over our heads The papers aro alive with the controversy Catholic after Catholic rushes into pnnt to assort his good citi7Cn8hip, fallibility or infallibility The infallible persons are found to dif fer m the most remarkable manner Canonist contradicts canonist with extraor dinary vigour and with a most pleasing effect Decrees meet decrees in the air, and pope onswerapope with perplexing readiness That is the one good thing which HOB come out of the controversy, that it has sot the Romanists themselves by the ears The faith which we all supposed to bo one and indivisible, con staut and unchangeable, is discovered to mean quite opposite things. While one authonty of tho church avers that the Vati can decrees have altered everything, another contends that they havo altered nothing Infallibility itself has had a bad time of it In the newspapers of the last fortnight We do not know who is infallible or whon, or how many. Infallible only when speaking ex cathedra-shouts one doughty champion and a sinner in the mortal part, like ourselves. But what is ex cathedra, and who shall define it' If tho Pope him self, who by the definition is changed from fallible to infallible, then practically he is personally infallible Again, there is Mon. signor Capel, oiliest of prelates, and a very successful catcher of English aristocrats into the net of St Peter, who declares that "the Bpintual and the temporal powers are differ ent but the former. miiBt ever define tho liants of either But if the spiritual power is to be the final judge of what is the tem poral power, what is this but a complete ecclesiastical dominion ' However this moy be-and I ought not to ontor into polemics it does not concern the question of Mr Gladstone's pamphlet There has been a great religious agitation stirred up, during which the capacity of Roman Catholic- to servo their country has been discussed Ought such a discussion to havo boen promoted by aman like Mr Gladstone, whoso glory it is to have restored the Irish Roman Catholics to all their pnvileges who Bought to give thom even moro than they can fairly claim, by banding o\ or tho higher odu cation of the Inah youth to tho Roman Catholic pneBthood? I fear that posterity will not give an answer favourable to the character of Mr Gladstone Itia truohehaa his consolations in tho present Mr Newdo gate ishiglily pleased, and is inclined to roceiv e the prodigal again to his bosom The Morning Advertiser alwavs said how it would bo when a man of so masculino a mind once looked at things in their proper light, and purged himself of the errors of Popory Sido by Bide with these certificates of character wo may placo tho sagacious and high minded comments of tho Osaervatorc liomano, that champion of the Popo, which declares that the lato Prime Minister of England, having boon "much, displeased in having hod to resign his post and retiro to a moro modest position,' has dictated this "garrulous and disconnoctod pamphlet" because ho desired to " got bun self talked about," and place himsolf " once more as far as possiblo boforo tho pnblio " Tho great masB of the Liborals are perplexed and uncortain as to how to intorprctMr Gladstone's conduct Somo woro very angry and abusive, declanng that thoir loader has abandoned the very cause which he had com polled them reluctantly to undertake Othors are jubilant at tho prospect of a now cry, which is to heal the in torn ni feuds, aud bung back tho Nonconformists to tUoic allegiance There is no donbt that a certain number of excellent Protestants have been gratified by Mr Gladstone's outspoken denunciation of Popery, but whether there are enough of them to counterbalance the total defection of tho Irish Roman Catholics and the J> nghah Catholic Liberals remains to be seen In any other man this publication would certainly appear as a bid for a new lease of popularity as a cry with which to "dish Disraeli just as Disraeli bad on two or three occasions ' dished ' the Liberal leader Apart from the agitation which has been aroused by Mr Gladatono s pamphlet there has been no life m home politics A sign of the extreme depreseion on one sido may be gathered from the fact that tho defeat of the Liberal candidate at Birkenhead tho other day was hailed by The Times as an 'ogreeablo surprise for the Libo rals What on earth is meant or dinary men know no "nore than why " Australia should bo languishing for labour ? from the islands of the Pacific-a fact 0£ which wo were gravely informed tho other day on tho Bomo authority Possessed of the samo spirit of curiosity as that which im- pelled Mr Pecksniff to ask of Mrs Todgers ber notion of a wooden leg I BUould like to submit this Times writer to the pane forte el dure while I questioned him as to his notions of an Australian labourer I ouppose the man had read somewhere that Polynesians aro employed in Queensland, and so has como to the conclusion that all Australia is languishing for coloured labour It ia a ludicioua notion, very much in harmony with what one reads constantly in The Times wheu a colonial question is on the tapts I am happy to say, however, thatwithiegardtotho Tijia The Tunea linn come round rapidly to a sense of their value, and of the necessity of the annexation This, after several urgent protests against the measure on all sorts of grounds-tbo ferocity of tbo inhabitants of whom tiloso who aro not cannibals are Wea lej ans-tho relaxing nature of the climate the dangers of complications with the States the careless habits of the white population and ev cry other cause which could be suggested to a lively mind impatient of Imperial obli- gations and concerned onlj about the moneyed interest It ia onlj a wonder that the celebrated largo pink flag that terror of Abyssinia, was not pressed into the service ogam, to point out the danger of an English annexation of tho 1 ijia A romantic story has readied England, through the suspicious channel of an American newspaper, respecting the end of the real Roger Tichborne He ia not at Millbank as an astonishing number of people in 1 ngland believe but he died in the South Seas and was buried in a remote ¡aland there, where your labour comes from Tho genuine Roger, also was educated at Stoney- hurst, and was tattooed by Lord Bellow, and had a twitch m his ejes and had no lobes to his ears, and went to South America, es- caped from the wreck of the Bella, waa picked up at sea, and afterwards died in tina desolate island W bat ia to become of Mr Whalley if tina be true 1 As for Dr Ke- nealy, he has nearly cometo an end already, with the Lnglishman.

(l'ROÍt OUR OWN COURESrONDEKT ) LONDON, Nov. 27. Mr GLADSTONES EXPOSTULATION It almost seems as if wo wore in the midst of that religious war which Mr Disraeli prognosticated The din of controversy rises on every side, and arguments are marshalled m hostile re_imonts spilling many words, if no blood All tho churchoB aro agitatod and tho world looks on with activo interest 1 Lvory Parliament m Europe is bocoming theological, BayB one dolly journal, nor is that all according to tho same sooidar judgment Social intercourse is disturbed by tho sounds of controversy about tho »undaniontttl questions of tho faith Mon who had hitherto mado light of tho disputes of tho oburchoa lind thom to bo as grim a rcahtyaBthequeBtionaoflocoUatmg " "Half Luropo,' soya an influential contemporary, comme vho immediate question, "iBQ.agi_0(i in controversyas to the power of the Pope 01 the. political consciences of his people." TI ia the direct issue raised by Mr. Gladstone his Political Expostulation on the beanng the Vatican decrees upon civil liberty. I his pamphlet is rather sign than cause of t great controversy, although it ha3 provok a storm of its own. The first result has be to define clearly the position which t Vltramontanes occupy in England, and set loose a considerable amount of indepi dent thought within the Roman Catlic Church. The letter in which Archbishop Mann: gave first answer to Mr. Gladstone's chai covered with vague lines of casuistry t actual differences between the Ultramonta and Protestant theories of civil life. Î so the trenchant words of Monsigt Capel, the eloquent preacher of I Kensington Pro Cathedral, who left doubt as to Ins meaning Not only did attempt to put Lord Acton and Le Camoys into their proper place, as m no w representative laymen, but he called on t former to substantiate his charges agau the Holy See, and warned the latter that he "senously and obstinately refuses accept 'the doctrine of the Personal lufa bility of the Pope,' then does he make ah wreck of the Faith, and tpso facto separ, himself from communion with the Chui and the See of Rome " Turther, while ma taming that the Vatican decrees have 1 changed anything, he asserts that tho chui has always held-"That all power, civil CccleBiaBtical, emanates from God , ti both, therefore, are to bo honoured ai obeyed, that tho ecclesiastical poit is Bunerior to the civil, aud defin the limit of one and the other, th where the ci\il power passes its prop province, then has the church tho right raise her voice aud condemn it " Ia afraid there aro Bomo controversial zealc who, in reading this letter, havo beon d posed to say, ' I thank thee, Jew, for givn me that word " Even Sir George Bowyt who for so many years has acted as mout piece and defender of the PopeinourEnglt newspapers, "thought it his duty "to stn that ho could not assent to Mouaigu Cupel's proposition aa to the superiority the ecclesiastical power, defining and lim ing the civil-that he held it to be true in 0 sense, dangerous in another, and that ti true doctrine was, that both powers we Bupreme, each in its own aphere." Lo Arundell, of Wardour, subsequently a nounced his agreement with bir Goori Dowyer in this view. Mr Henry Petro, a couBin of Lord Peti struck a still holder note ot opposition - ' will bo no oxagteration," he wrote, " affirm that among the Old Catholics of En land, however loath they may bo to appe in open opposition to the authority of the church, there aro many who watch wi anxiety, not unmmgled with regret ti reckless and irrational proceedings of ti Ultramontane party-a party seeking to ir pose upon the world, with all the means powerful combination at its command, ti astounding claims issuing from the Vatico -claims and pretensions long since suppost to have been extinct, which now m their r suscitation are tending to open hostih with modern progress and to collision w11 every civil authority m Europe For or who in early youth acquired the tene of his faith in tbo midst of a commum renowned as thestaunchestand most learnt bulwarks of the church (I can rofer ¡to 1 other than the distinguished Order of ti Society of Jesus), I can for one affirm with Loi Camoys, in support of Mr. Gladstone's stat ment, that dogmas now insisted upon 1 articles of faith were not thon presented 1 that light " " And in case of the collision 1 the power of the church with civil authont he went on to declare that the only roply loyal subject could make to Mr Gladstone appeal would be, 'An Englishman first, Catholic after.' " The general committee of the Cathol Union forthwith met and passed a resolutlo affirming "that the Catholics of Great Bl tam cordially accept and submit to ti decreesof the Council of the Vattcau.and tht their duties with regard to tho civil powi are in no woy affectod thereby, ' ale another protesting against the assumptio that Lords Acton and Camoys, and Mr Ifem Petre were in any sense spokesmen t the Catholic laity These resolutions wet forwarded to The Times, and signed by Lor Petre. But in epito of protests, it has be come apparent that tho Old Catholics havo party in England. Lord Acton has sine returned to the charge m a learned au elaborate letter, occupying several column of the leading journal, in which ho endet vours to make good his first statements I his last paragraph he avows his unsbake adherenco to tbo Roman Church, but 1 manly terms, which some other religionist might emulato with profit -"It would b well if men had never fallen into tho temptr tion of suppressing truth and encoura¿in error for the better security of religion Our church standa, and our faith shout stand, not on tho virtues of mon, bil on the Burcr ground of an institution and guidance that are divine Therefore, 1 rea miBhaken in tho belief that nothing whicl the inmost depths of history shall disclose 11 time to como shall ever bring to Catholic lust cause of shamo or fear I should die honour and betray the church if I entei tamed a suspicion that the evidences of re ligion could bo weakened or tho authority o councils, sapped by a knowledge of the fact with which I have beon dealing, or of others which aro not lesB grievous or loss certaii because they remain untold " Among other controversialists, Mr Martin Archer Sheo, tho Royal Academician, has contributed one or two Iettors of importance lie quotes a protestation of tho English Catholics, presented to Mr Pitt m 1788, whon tho question of disabilities waa under dis- cussion, m which wo und the following de- claration, wholly unqualified by anything contained m tho context -"Wo acknow- ledge no infallibility in tho Popo " Thia pro tCBtatioñ was, as wo learn from Mr Butlei m his Historical Memoirs of Cnghsh Caf/ioiics.Bigned by the four Vicars Apostolic, and, with a very inconsiderable excoption, by all the Catholic clergy and laity in Eng land Mr Sb.ee, who is a Roman Catholic, also pleads that he has no legal proof that the Vatican Council has pronounced any decree whateier on the question of Papal Infalli- bility Tho Popo has expressed an opinion "with the approbation of the council," but the council has assorted nothing on the subject, nor clenched it " by its own anathema In Ireland also Mr Gladstone's pamphlot has excited great commotion The O Dono gime declares that tho appeal is "a flagrant violation of thoao principles of relitious liberty which aro cherished by the masa of Englishmen, and that by tho courao ho has taken, notwithstanding his comparativo politeness, ho placoB himself on a level with tho blunt and curt bigota of Exeter hall " Bishop Ullathorne, of Biiininghain, has issued a pastoral dououncing the now sect of the Dollingerites," and formally de clanng that any person who, like Lord Acton, "adhores not with steadfastness to the dogmatic decisions of tho Popes and Councils" "ia no longer a child of tho church, and has no right to her sacraments or communion." Ibis week Archbishop Manning, with sot oral of the English biBhops, baa started for Rome, on what mission does not yet appear Wo havo had Bcvoral gross instances lately of the fabrication of falso noivs, but could not bo proparod for the statement from Romo that tho speoch m which tho Pope denounced Mr Gladstono as " a viper ' ia altogether an intention This speoch, which w as said lobato boen addressad to a deputation of English Catholics waa cominu luuited firat by the special correspondent ot the Dailn News One Roman nowspipor asBcrtB that tho speech was actually roportod from tho embassy to our own Foreign Office in the same terms It is au old saying that truth ia found in tho bottom of a well but it would appear that tho facilities of telo graphic communication with tho uppor world tempt 801110 men to make tho well deeper Another illustration of tho maunor in which facts aro roportod, and thon denied is found 111 tho rumours circulated rospectiiio a conspiracy at St PetoraburK Thrco thoa Band persona were said tóbate boon arrested, hut inquiry discovers nothing worso than a little political agitation among uui\orsity students, THE CA-vUST WAR Spanish nowa is notoriously untrust- worthy, and invnunbly nooda tho Biftmg of timo Somo of the earlier incidents cou nected with the siego of Irun, which com manda the dianne1 of tho Btdassoa, and is a frontier town of some importauco, tho hist on tho North of Sjiam Railway, carno to UB covered with a glow of romaneo which a few days sufficod to dissipate.

The guns from the various bo teries, Carlist and Republican, fired alt gether about 100 shots an hour. The a proach of Republican troops by the rivi compelled a cessation of the fire, and hurried removal of Bome of the guns. The followed a rumour, without foundation, thi Don CarloB had been driven across ti French frontier, and that the Spanish Gi vernment had demanded that he should I interned. A crisis seemed imminent. Agai the siege was renewed with vigour, but tb advancing forcea of Generals Loma an Laserna again chocked it.

Don Carle hastened to the scene of action, bv it was too late. A panic seized his troop and they were with difficulty held back froi taking refuge in French territory. Genen Loma pushed forward, and attacked the ri mainder of the Carliats in their ontroncl mente, The rout waa complote, and so wt the relief of Irun. It seomod for a momer as if the Corlists hod been overtaken by crushing defeat, and the supreme hour c this long struggle waa cloae at hand.

MR. DISRAELI AND COUNT ARNIM. Mr. Disraeli has thought it expedient t explain that the sentence in his Guildha speech, in which he spoke of the workin classes of this country as enj'oying permi nent rights which the nobility of othe countries do not possess-in thesacredncs of their persons and homes, and their fret dom from arbitrary arrests or domiciliar visits-hod no reference to the coso of Coun Arnim. Ho adds that it could not havo bee BO meant, because the Count was legall arrested. But if the allusion was not s intended, the words were an unfortunat slip, for everybody interpreted thom by th events which were then uppermost on th continent. It was immediately surmisei that tho Premior had received a hint o his mistake from Berlin. The Journal de Débats emphasised the suspicion, and de dared that even Mr. Disraeli was surrendoi ing to the overshadowing influence of Bie morck. The Berlin papers now kindly re mind us that we were the first to see Coun Arnim in the allusion. What else could w seo ? Meanwhile, we await with much in tcrest the trial of the Count. SOCIAL NOTES. November, despite some bright genial days and the clear cold touch of wintry frosts, ba been true to its character as the month o fogs. London, Liverpool, and some othor o our large towns have been wiapped in tho dense yellow gloom once supposed to be t"u peculiar prerogative of the metropolis, J stranger from the Bunny south emergini suddenly into one of our streets, hearini their confused murmur, but scarcely ablo ti penetrate its darkneas-with one dim ligh and another peering out of it like a posaini ghost-and then a ruddy glow from somi unseen window surprising him, might b excused if ho thought himself descendis into Avernus. These fogs, unfortunately have worse consequences than the imagination conjures. They bring with them a train of pro saic casualties, sometimes very serious. Thi traffic is interrupted, often entirely sus pended; and, notwithstanding every pre caution, many street accidents occur, limbs are broken, and lives lost, and this month the railways have added their contingent of disasters. We have as yet had no such visitation as that which last year sent up the bills of mortality, but the condition of the public health is not satisfactory. Fever has been rife during the last few months, and at present we have no sort of quarantine by which to check its progress in the poorer quarters. At Lewes, which is famous for its bonfires on the 5th of November, tho annual display was postponed in consequence of the prevalence of severe fever. Other towns are in as bad a plight. But the most notorious case is that of Over Darwen, a cotton manufacturing town in Lan cashire, where, out of a population of 21,000, there were 1,500 persons down with typhoid fever at the beginning of the present month. This state of things is due to the abominable filth of the place, which has out grown all sanitary decencies- the inhabitants tolerating the nuisances that abound, rather than raise the local rates. Paris has been startled by an explosion Bindiar to that which shook the north of London a few weeks ago. Accounts diffoi ns to the naturo of the inflammable mattoi which took fire. "Somo say it was a boiler full of comproBBod ether; others that it was a secret preparation of tho manufacturer, in the compofiition of which nitro-mothylino largely entered. At all ovents, some workmen im prudently, and, as it is said, against rules, entered tho warehouse whore tho substance was stored with a badly-closed lantern. A fire first ensued, and the work- men ian away crying ' Fire !' but in a few seconds the explosion came. Tho man carrying tho lantern was in an instant a calcined corpse. Another, takon to the hospital, died shortly afterwards. A third, I with a terrible wound in his back, is in an alarming state. About 15 others wore wounded. Fortunately the bulk of tho hands, 350 in number, did not come to work so early. The main part of the factory waa not destroyed ; but immense damage waa dons to the railway station and parts of St. Denis. It is calculated that one-fourth of the windows in the town aro broken." Wo havo, howover, had several catas- trophes less startling, but moro fata!, to record at home. Amongst them a colllory explosion near Rotherham. Botween half post 5 and C o'clock in tho morning tho men and boys descended the pit for what ia callod the " day shift." At the bottom there wero two ordinary " bonks " and a dip benk, each of which ÍB 22ft. wide, and worked by two men at each ond. Between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning the " fire trier" wont round the works, and pronounced thom safe. Half an hour afterwards the oxploBion occurred, and nearly all the mon and boys thon in the working wero killed instantaneously. Twcnty-threo bodies hove boon recovered, and three other deaths aro reported. A melancholy accident has also happened to a cutter belonging to Her Majesty's steamship Aurora, which was run down by the Dublin steamer Duke of Leinster in tho Clyde, and 17 Bailors wero drowned. At Liverpool, also, two steamtugs have como into collision and foundered, with somo loss of life. The policy of the Midland Company, in abolishing aecond-closs carriages, is likoly to have an important offect on ail our railways. | It has been warmly debated throughout the country, but at a great mooting of share- holders, held at Derby, a decisive majority declared in favour of it. The chairman of the company then Btated some facta of gene- ral intereat, from which it appoared that the annual earnings of a first-closa carriage aro ot present 118 per cent., of a second- class, 170, and of a third-cloBS 330 nor cent, of ita cost. A committee representing six railway companies had requested the Midland Com pony to postpone their decision till after tho usual half-yearly meetings, but this thoy declined to do, after tho resolution of tho ehareholdora. Accordingly, we are invited to mnko another social experi- ment, by which the public will imme- diately gain .in choaponod faroa, vvbilo it romaine to bo provod whether moro traffic will be çroated. The six companies, includ- ing tho Great Weatern, tho London and North Western, the Great Northern, and others in the North of England tonching tho territory travorscd by tho Midland, have since determined not follow its oxaraplo in the abolition of second class, but to reduce the second class fares considerably, and tho first class fuies at all points of contact to the somo rates as on tho lines of their rival that is to say, in both casos, about 25J per cent. PERSONAL, Tho prolonged absence of the Queen at Balmoral during the visit of the Empress of Russia to her daughter at Buckingham Polaco, lins been mado tbo subject of somo comment. Tho visit of tho Empress was of a purely piivato and family nature, but the country likes a moro generous manifestation of hospitality. Tho Queen, howover, re- turned in time to pay ono vbit of courtesy, and to bo prcsont at tho baptism of tho infant Princo, who takes tho namo of Alfred Alex- ander William Ernest Albert. Tho Einpreas, whoso stay amongst us has beon morrod by a severe cold, baa now left for the sunnier aouth of Franco. In the death of Mr. Tom Hood, tho editor of Fun, we havo lost a popular namo. Ho had not the genius ot his father, and doubt less'owed some part of his literary success ti that father's fame, but his genial naturi made him many friends, and his inde fatigable industry entitled him to some re warda.

About the samt time that this account reached Entland there appeared an announcement in somt 1 tench papers that one Francois Destrinf had taken his departure from Pans for Lon don, cn route to Australia, in connexion witl the Tichborne caae, he having been in AUB traha in 1805, and tbere witnessed the buna of the veritable Roger. Unfortunately fo: the interests of truth and justice, he hat been travelling m America for Bomo years and heard nothing of the procès Tichborne until it was over. Ho can show the exac spot whero the deceased " Roger lies bunec under the shade of a small group of trees on the banks of a rivulet called the Roc Riler." Dr Kenealy, who has engaged Sir. W, Harcourt to help him m an appeal to be made to the judges against the action of the benchers of Gray's inn, himself appeared thu week at the Old Bailey to answer a charge ol libel preferred against him by Mrs Fitton drcigb, whose name figured so prominently in the late trial in connexion with certain alleged forgeries Lord Coleridge had beer, subpanrcd for the defence, and Arthui Orton also , and the latter, looking very well, was in fact brought up from Millbank, and lodged in an nnte room, to be m readmesa ii required, while the former had a seat and waited on the bench But Mrs Pittendreigb was without counsel, and without evidenco, and ûeked for a postponement of the trial Dr. Kenealy, who appeared in ill health, shattered, and feeblo, and almost listloas in his prostration, was allowed a chau m the dock, and pleaded simply not guilty. Mr Bealey appeared to defend him, but it waa soon clear that there was nothing te do, In vain Mrs Pittendreigh pleaded thal abo was a ruined woman-that her six fatherless children wore crushed Tho Re- corder could only answer that her application for a poBtponement carno too late, that hot affidavit was insufficient, and that his duty left him no alternative but to instruct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. The jury assenting, the wholo case was dismissed m lesa than a quarter of an hour. Contrary to expectation, there was no popular excite ment in tho matter. Mrs Mina Jury, another of the Tichborne witnesses, has also figured again before the public, having been arrested at Macclesfield on the charge of pilfering various articles from hotels and lodging houses. She con- trived a novel device by which to escape from her cell-screamed, and brought some one to see what was the matter, when she complained that a rat had bitten her, and asked the warder to search for it. He "smelt a rat," and thought that enough , but a few days later sheo raised the same alarm, and another policeman coming in, she repeated the same request. He complied, and while he wasa stooping down to look, she rushed out and got away. The clever Mina was, how- ever, retaken at Leek, a town in Stafford- shire, and has since been sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

and lower, until city men begin to look grave and won der how it will all end Some of our financial seers months ago urged the directors to adopt in time the restrictive power at their com mond to prevent the efiiux of our bullion, and attract supplies to our inadequate hoard, but they did not respond to the appeal with any promptitude At length the movements of the monetary currents became BO obviously adverse that the Bank was stirred to action, and on Monday, the 16tb, the official nvm. mum was raised from 4 to 5 per cent The foreign drain had at length rendered such a step imperative and urgent It had been delayed too long probably under the ltnpres sion that the position of the Bank would be strengthened os usual at this Beoaon, by a contraction of the internal circulation to an extent sufficient to neutrahso the effecta of tho dram The immediate reBultof the advance WOB tempornnly to arrest the outflow of gold to 1 ranee, but the influence on the Pans Lx change has been so slight as to have altogether failed to place UB m a position of safety Hie next ominoua event waa the advance of its rate of discount by the Bank of Prussia to 6 per cent, and the roto of interest on adyonces to 7 per cent This was regardod as a challenge to the Bank of Lngland to follow suit, and a further nse waa accord- ingly generally looked 'or yesterday The directors, however, refrained from taking that step The reserve it waa found on the publication of the weekly return, had slightly improved and the proportion borno by it to liabilities had risen to 41 per cent, or 8a 2_d in the pound The coin and bullion, however still showed a gradual decline Some of the other features of tho return were more favourable Meanwhile, the open market rates both here and at Berlin do not follow the bank charges The deviation is very marked and IB puzzling to on lookers In Prussia the terms in the outside market are li to li below the official quotations and in London there is a discrepancy of _ to 1 per cent The fact is the demand "for commercial billa is extremely moderate both at the Bank and tho discount houses HUB anomalous state of things is provoking inquiry and discussion Nobody is able to trace the ultimate origin of the dis turbance We all know that gold is steadily and persistently leaving UB and also that most of it finds its way to Parrs and Berlin but the nature of the proceas of transfer ia a mystery to the general public Ihe limes m discussing some of the solu tions suggested, says that an impression prevails m some quarters that wo aro im porting unusually large

the present monetary phenomena l8 found m the declaration of competent authonties that the demand for money has not arisen in the ordinary way of business Another suppost tion is that there are still in London some balances of the subscriptions for tho last 1 rench loan, and which are now being with drawn V, hatever the causes, the position is highly inconvenient and not free from danger This

Nearly two years ago an attempt waa mado to organise a monthly Uno of powerful Btenmors botweon England and Melbourne viel the Cape of Good Hope, which were to convey mails, and transport to the colonies large batches of emigrants, in about 42 days One feature of tho scheme was the adoption of the venerable Great Britain as the pioneer vessel of this new and swifter service. This grave joke was too much for Jt/hn Bull, and the project penahed of denalon. Since then, the idea of establishing a regular dependable monthly steam service has never been re- linquished, and rumours have reached ua from time to time of newcombinations of capi- talists to give it practical development Six montbB ago we BOW the draft prospectus of a company, which waa registered, copitul had been promised, and arrangements wore made for the building of a fleet of suitable steamers, which were to sail from Bristol, and call at Milford Haven going and returning That scheme, too, would seem to havo col lapsed-its promoters probably lost faith m its practicability, and reserved their capital for moro promising ventures. Anyhow, tho protean project baa assumed a fresh shape, and a now group of promoters havo suddenly appealed to the money market for about a quarter of a million storhng to carry out the long nursed design The directors aro highly honourable men, but none of thom appear to have any special acquaintance with tho AuBtrahan trade, which is rather a negativo qualification for their post The abridged prospectus states that the object of the company is to oatabliah a regu- lar or monthly line of full powered steam- ships between Great Britain and Australia adopting the route «id the Capo of Good Hope, for the conveyance of passengers, mails, general merchandise, and specie, performing the voyage in from 42 to d5 days The trade of the Australian colonies employs annually between COO 000 and 000 000 tons jof sailing tonnage On reference to the Board of Trade returns, it will bo seen that tho value of ox ports to India during the vear ending Decein ber 31, 1873, was £22 4G1,51G, and to Australia £14,272 280, while on the same day (exclu Bive of the Peninsular and Oriental Com pany's Mail service) 28 steamers wero adver tiseu for India, representing over 00 000 tons, when, with the same exception, only one auxiliary steamer of 2 312 tons was advertised or Australia , thus allowing that thero is not only a great want, but a very wide ond remunerative held for the operations of a regular line of full powered steamers. lu order to commence the service at once, and to demonstrate conclusively that tho voyage can be peí formed in the time stated, and that the commercial result of a regular ser- vice would be satisfactory, tho directors have arranged for the purchase of the magnificent steamship Nebraska of 3,908 tons register, and 2 000 horse power effective, official num- ber 55 081 (to be called the Victoria), for the sum of £78 000 This vessel is a strong and powerful steamer of the highest class, and specially adapted for this trade, being fitted with compound engines, having now boilers and all tho latest improvements, combining greit speed with large carrying capacity, and m the pis Benger accommodation the arrangements are such as cannot bo excelled The Victoua will sail from London not later than the 1st day of February, 1875 The profitableness of the undertaking is made to appear from the following estimate of the expenditure and receipts of each Btcamor, assuming a voyage of 45 days each vi ay - To »ai.ee , .. .. .. . £2 DOO 0 0 Toprousion» 6,000 0 0 To insurance - ship, passengers, and freight " 2,700 0 0 To outfit repairs, and rcnomls . .. 2,000 0 0 loBtcvcdoro . ,, 800 0 0 To port chargea. - 800 0 0 To coala .. . . 6,600 0 0 To advertising, claims, Bub-agonclcs, commission, ofilco expenses, ic. .. 3,600 0 0 Total expenditure.£22,800 0 0 By freight out (average) 2,260 tons at 60s .£6,025 0 0 Passengers out.

These remarks very naturally initiated a corcapondenco in the commercial columns of the leading journol On tho following day a letter was inserted from Mr Edmund Thompson, the well known Australian shipper, in which he calls attention to the dangerously defective rig of certain steamers recently put upon tho routo Thoy aro under stood to be almost moBtlcss, so that in the event of their machinery becoming disabled, their loss at sea would bo almost certain Hero is the letter -"Sir,-Allow mo to make a few remarks upon the notice you have accorded m your city article of to day relative to direct steam communication with Australia in 15 days, and ¿ho company which has just been registered profeaaiug to carry outtbia,if attamable, moBt desirable object The Nebraska I believe, has had her now engines, and is thereforo in a better position than if she had still to receive them, it ia thereforo possible that she may, as an nounced, proceed to Melbourno on tho 1st of February next.

I havo beon connected with the Australian colomos as a loading broker for nearly 30 years, and havo had also somo experience of atoam in that trado, not, I am Borry to say, of a satisfactory character. I can therefore form some opinion upon the subject of the receipts and expenditure of steamers so omployod, and 1 venturo to suggest to the enterprising projectors of this company that if their estimato of receipts and expenditure wero rovorsed they would bo nearor the mark I havo it as tho opinion of the first engineers of the day, that no engines yot constructed could stand tho strain necessary to propol a vessel at tho late of 300 knots a day (tho speed required) for 45 dajs consecutivoly Au oxpenmeut is now being tnod, fortu notely not at the expense of tho public, but by prlvato enterprise, to settlo tina interest ing problem , tho St. Osyth, which Bailed lost month, being tbo pioncor ship, and the Whompoa is advertised to follow her in Do comber.

Indeed, it IB a question whpthor the Board of Trade is justified in giving them. a passenger certificate on such a voyage, as, in the event of losa of life arising from suca not impossible contingency, their naval ad. visers might incur a very grave roaponaibihty. No one would moro gladly see a 45 days' passage to Australia au accomplished anti certain fact than myself, as everything that tendB to reduce the distanco in time betwoon the mother country and these groat colomes cannot fail to promoto not only their prosperity, but that of all who are, like myself, engaged in tho trade I am afraid, however, that the efforts now being mado to solve this; problem ore not likely to prove BuccesBful " On the 21st Mr. L J Reed published a letter, intended to obviate any unwarrant- able inference from the uae mado of his nome m connexion with the new company . -"Sir,-I find from the letter of Mr Thomp. son, in The Times of to day, and from letters winch I am receiving, that it is assumed th it I am a director of the Australia Diroofc Steam Navigation Company.

One letter we print below, because it corrects tho statements made by us on apparently Bufliciout authority as to the condition of the steamahipä St. Osyth and Whampoa. It appears that they have, OB far as possible, been mado capable of going without steam before being put on the Australian route and that they are now furnished with the means of repairing any break in their machinery at sea Other points of the controversy wo can only refer to It IB, for instance, disputed that steam v easels aro incapable of going 45 consecutive days at seo, and evidence has been laid before us which seems to prove the contrary. Our remarks, howovor, referred rather to large passenger and cargo boats combined, auch as would be required to conduct a profi. table trade with Australia, and for theae it would be impossible, unless they coaled on the route, to steam such a distance, whatever the quality of their machinery. The larger tho veasel the greater its depend- ence on steam power, and the greater the necessity for carrying large quantities of coal."

Turther, she was only fitted with now boilers and cylinders, not with new engines "There cannot be the least objection, of couise, to the trial of tho experiment so long as its difficulty is fully recognised, but when the public aro presented with on ac- count showing the 'estimated expendí turo ond receipts of each steamer,' which leads them to suppose that tha undertaking ia to bo at once attended with large profits, the true position of affairs can hardly be Bald to bo before them The great American line to which we alluded yes- terday had to bo subsidised vory heavily by the United States Governmeut to enable it to maintain its pOBitiou, yet it runs botvveon countries doing great businesa and baa barely half tho dmtance to travel which an Australian line would have Wo havo good authority besides for saying that tho Queen of the Thames, a ship started os a direct Australian steamer some three years ago, only drew some £20 000 for tho two voyages out and in, and did not clear enough profit on that sum to pay her ínauranco, and she burnt 20 tons less coal a day than the NebraBka does " lhe subjoined letter ia in reply to some in. accuracies m tho remarka of Mr Edmund Thompson, quoted abovo - "Sir,-Refernng to tbo letter of Mr Ed mund 'Ihompson as to the Australian Direct Steam Navigation Company, in your city article of Thursday and adopting tho reply of my co director, Commander Cheyne, in The Times of yeaterday, I would ask apoco for a few words which are Btill due to the integrity of the subjoct, and to my own position as a director, wbich baa been unjua tifiobly impugned, for it is bad onougli to have a fair and promising enterprise sub- jected through your columns to any adverso opinion even though from a prophet of ovil whoso only point appoara to bo an absoluto conclusion OB to the impossi- bility of any further improvement in atcam power na applied to navigation.

The quotations from the United States havo continued to decline. In addition to the American sources of Bupply, it appears that some parta of Germany are rich in mineral oila. The Academy informs us that tho dis- covery of petroleum springs on the Lune burg Heaths in Northern Germany pro- misee to convert thi3 once barren and apparently unavailable tract into what might by comparison be designated as an Eldorado. Borings were made at Obere, by Hanoverian and French surveyors, as early as 1803, but then the measures taken failed to confirm the opinion which had been previously ad- vanced of the presence of oil. Since then tho heath has boen drained and rendered fit for cultivotion, and recently it has boen shown that petroleum can bo obtained by simple borings, and that at some snots, as at the village of Wietze, the sand is satu rated with rock-oil. In this part of the heath, since 1852, when tho owner of the land coused a shaft to be Bunk, petroleum has boen obtained without intermission, although tho proces8 adopted for ita extraction has con Bisted in little more than a mero washing o the eand, through which the oil waa Buffered to run into veBsels prepared for its reception. .In clearness, purity, and açecific weight, the Lüneburg oií is said to be identical with the American rock-oils, and it is almost without smell of any kind. Fish Oils.-The nearest value of sperm ia £105 to £10G per ton, there being no supply in first bonds. Palo southern is scarce, and other fish oils are quiet. Coprob.-At recent auction, 92 bags of Sjdney sold at £20, 310 bags Ceylon wore taken out. New Zealand hemp ia still very inactive, owing mainly to continued low prices of Manilla. Prices, however, keep tolerably firm, because holders refrain from pressing sales under present unfavourable circum- stances. Stock on 1st November, 2.0G1 tons, ogninBt 1,779. Imports Bince January 1, 1,755 tons, and deliveries 1,500. Cotton.-Tho receipts have been on a largo scale, upwards of 1,000,000 bales of the netv crop having reached the American ports. 1,000 bales of inferior to good Queensland sold at 7d. to 8d. per lb., and 320 bales of Fiji at OJd. to 8Jd. for low to good stained, lOd. to lid. for inferior to good long staple. Stocks in London almost exhausted. Tin.-During the first half of November there was an active market for this metal, and prices advanced, for Straits to £94 and £91 10s. cash, and for Auatralian to £91. Since the 10th the demand has been Bluggish, and quotations havo receded to £92 and £92, both for Straits and Australian ; but during the last week very few transactions in tho latter have taken çlace. English is also easier, and common ingot is only in moderato inquiry at 99s. to 100s.
