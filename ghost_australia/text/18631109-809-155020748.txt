THE THEATRES. HAYMARKET THEATRE. A brilliant houso on Saturday night witnessed tho performance and testified to the high merits of Mr Kean's Hamlet. We have already so fully remarked on tho cultivated intellect and patient, thoughtful art exhibited in this character, that we have nothing moro to rccord than tho fact of another popular verdict in its favor. A more than usually melancholv representative of the ghost of de parted majesty suggests a word of general remark for the critical consideration of thoso whose line it is to draw ' counterfeit presentments' from the world of spirits. Stage tradition says that Shnkspoai'o himself played The Ghost in 'Hamlet,' but there is nothing left to tell if tho personation was pervaded by the genius that conceived the char acter. Is it not worthy of the consideration of dramatic intelligence whother a long line of actors have succecdedin giving to their spiritual conceptions such heavy, sepulchral utterance, in the drawling long drawn out, of ghostly elocution ? As a voico from beyond the grave, should not tho narrativo of the spectral king be spoken with tlie most ethereal enunciution to which the human voice can bo ex alted ? Tho magnificent Dumas in his modest vorsion of Shakspeare Improved, makes The Ghost tho re presentative of ctcrual justice. Without going quito so high in the heroics we think a decided improve ment might be made in his elocution.
