A PEEP AT ANTWERP. By ALICE J. MUSKETT. ft here, at the end of a certain long summer spent in many places I turned my face once more to Paris and the winter's work, it was in company with a fellow-couutrynoman, also an Arts student whom I had met in my last halting place a li UP Dutch Village As Antwerp and on the way south as agreed to stop there and have added jaunting to celebrate our meeting on one ' chill October morning we said good-bye to our picturesque village by the Fnndhills and started off The journey began badly in the first place it poured with rain secondly, our various" trains did not connect, so that we were forced to spend some three hours in witt ing-rooms with nothing to do but to listen to run drops i nil study Baodcl or And Banded or deeply as I respect and admire him is falling in large quantities died at the Belgian frontier the officers of the course made themselves particularly diaii,"eoau!e open- our lunches and " poked ' recklessly, and were very suspicious about our paint- ing kit In fact when we reached I Autnerp, it being by this time dark and bitterly cold he were in the deepest depression, and it was not to tragically that we hailed a cab and drove off to our hotel Alter what seemed a very long drive our cab pulled up with a final rattle and bang at the door of the Hour d Or, and the hostess, plump and embling us a hostess should he came out smoothing down her ample apron, to welcome in We shook our heads when Madame ushered us into spacious rooms on the first floor with crimson velvet couches and glittering mirrors, and after a little parlor ing accepted the only alternatives, of small rooms at the top of the house, consoling ourselves with the reflection that it was only for one night. They were funnily quaint looms with red-tiled floors, and huge beds man alcove By leaning out of my window at a dangerous angle I could catch a glimpse of the tower of the Cathedral close by, the bells of whiehseemod to clash just over my head every few minutes As soon as possible we were downstairs again, in the warm dining-room A stove in the middle of the room was glowing with all its might, and we sit and have in front of it while Madame bustled in and out superintending the preparation of our dinner, the regular dinner hour being long past Madame ii as varnish, she told us, and spoke four languages, nile added proudly Anti ore is a large port, so it naturally follows that the travellers who come to the Flour d'Oraieof all nationalities It was now, however, growing,! late in the year for tourists There was a big grey parrot named Coco in a gilded cage who kept up a stirrup;

During these years the of family had gathered round them many valuable and beautiful possessions Who the business was finally given up everything was falling into decay, and there seemed a likelihood of the treasures being bought by art centres, and scattered wi Iel) abroad It was then the erna authorities bought the building with its contents, and maintained it as an example of sixteenth and seventeenth century life, everything being arranged as it was then the printing office, with its presses, stands ready as if work were to be resumed to-morrow. the composing-room has its types and blocks of initial letters, there are drawings for title-pages and vignettes, some b) Rubens, the shop, too is ready for customers The private rooms of the family are tapestries or hung with stamped leather , the furniture stands just us they used it Here is the spirit they played on, the beds they slept in, the spinning wheel is still waiting for the spinner to come back to her work, the miniatures and porcelain ale in the cabinet, in the bedroom of Morctus crucifix bangs over the prayer desk, upon which lies a missal ready open Portraits of the family, some painted by Rubens, hang upon the wall, and regard the sightseers severely It is not difficult to imagine them moving through these rooms, which still seem so distinctly three Along one little gallery especially, the steps leading down to which were worn hollow by the footfalls of man) generations, one felt a hesitancy in passing At least it seemed fitting to ask pardon of the ghosts. for causing, a mere intruder, into their own domain The library was pervaded by) a mellow glow for the autumn sunshine was reflected treacherous upon row a of calf-bound boil s, rare first editions many of them lhewindo\V3 looked upon the big central court round which the building runs One side of this court is covered by a vine said to have been planted by Platitiu himself in 1580 The custodian in the library) a complete contrast in every VTi) to our event) of the cathedral, with the air of at once perceiving our superior intelligence that good custodians twins have, said if we wished we could gather some leave-, from the vine as a memento " Or, stay" said he as if stirred by a casual thought " I have come leady presses " so he took a thick come on theology from the shelves and handed us two leaves apiece Charming hypocrite ' As if that solemn theological work were not tutor leave from the v me, all ready for tourists as if that sic of gentle deprecation with which he turned away) was not the one he calculated as boat to appeal to our finer feelings of --generosity) I hope his faith is never shaken, I do hope nobody ever takes his vine leaves without giving him the very modest tip this contents him in letting By the time we had gone through the museum the BUnskiuo had vanished and the rain clouds were rolling up , so, in place of the fact that a night's railway journey lay before us, we went back to the Fleur d'Or for dinner and a rest beside the stove with Coco and the dachshund before we said good by to cheery little Madame and started off once again.
