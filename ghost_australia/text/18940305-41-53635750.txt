TF/E CYCLORAMA. There is a -cornpkteness about this unique sntertainme/st which we havo often noted, and my novelty introduced is well thought out. On Saturday night th6 really extraordinary ulnsion -at the Ghost of J.apoleon mttde its !aat aprjearanee to a very large attendance of Bnthus/aatso spactatora. Thia illusion has mystified all who have seen it, and it is to bo regrf/jted that circumstances will cot permit of r* longer run. But the policy of the man Â«g'-Jment 1a to make rapid changes, and this evening there will be introduced a new and *-ery interesting illusion entitled 'The Sen try.' It is a beautiful illustration of the his torical episode in Napoleon's career, where he iind3 the sentry asleep and quietly takes up his rifle, standing himself as sentry until the horrified man awali^, thus giving him a never to-be-forgotten Id? son in nap. The likeness to the authentic portraits of Napoleon is remark able. The attendances at Waterloo have been very large during the past week, and this even ing tht-re should be another buinfjer house. The Enchanted Fountain is, too, one of the attractions of Adelaide.
