TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER, SIR-It is not an ed fying, and happily it is not in Queensland a common sight, that of members of Parliament trying to " jump" tin mining claims Such practices are generally confined to gold claims and to the lower order of society A perusal of your leader of to day, and of a report of the Broadwater Company's meeting in the same issue, induces me to put together a few facts on this matter In March last, some gentlemen in Brisbane fitted out Mr Crate to prospect for tin bearing country, and after some endurance of hardship and camping out he discovered the four rich blocks belonging now to the Broadwater Company, and lying at and near the junction of Reeves' Gully The application and money for these were lodged early in April by the pro motors of the Broadwater Company In May several of them visited the claims in question, and it was then that the Commissioner, Mr Gregory, was asked to rectify an alleged error of one or two words in the application named Like an honest public servant he first of all, ascertained that there were no other applications meantime for this land, and then allowed the command obvious intention of the applications to take effect, and any trifling alleged errors in the letter of the application were then ancestors condoned, compromised, and for over blotted out In June the permissive license was obtained and a company formed to work the claims. The survey has been completed for the present owners, and all legal forms for the full acquire ment of the property dull, so far, complied with At the end of July, or in August, appears an application from some members of Parliament for this same ground. The M P 's do not ap pear to have been heard of during the early camping out days of the tin field, and they are quite conspicuous by their absence during those months in which certain knowing ones pronounced the Broadwater" a " sol!, a duffer, and a swindle, and destitute of tin ," but, as soon as the in heavy deposits is found, the legislators appear on the scene like blue-bottles when the most beef is brought on the table, and with about as much right to share in it, and if anything less welcome than the insects named generally in their applications were rejected by the Commissioner, being only about four months later lodged than the Broadwater promoters were; and now the M P's has reported to be trying to "earwig" the Minister for Lands with their view of the case, like the little boys at cricket, who are always calling out, " How's that, umpire" and who, consequently, are never taken any notice of with their imaginary mare's nests However, for the fun of the thing, and by way of a reductio ad absurdum, we will suppose the members of Parliament triumphant, and the Broadwater promoters' claims scattered, some two miles up and some two miles down the river what follows ? Even the legislators don't deny that the promoters did apply for some land, and that they were the first applicants on the river, and that claims go by priority of application it follows then, that the promotors must have some land allotted them up and down the river, and to do this they must displace others who Inn of land already allotted, and are at work and spending money in improvements These, in their turn, must of course displace others, and in short the whole of the claims on the Severn River will have to be re distributed, the whole pack of cards re- shuffled, if the legislators, modest idea is to be made an accomplished fact, a hundred claims would have to be done injustice to for the sake of obliging some legislators who have not the ghost of a shadow of a log to stand upon in the justice of their case If every trifling clerical error which has appeared on the face of applications for tin lands were bruised about by the surveyors, and held to be fatal! to the applicants, I venture to assert that not a single tin selection would yet have been allotted, but all would still continue to be bones of contention and sources of litigation But, happily, the Commissioner and Staff were practical people, and regarded the spirit more than the letter, as far as they were able to judge of the same, in the applications I am interested in this case, as having bought five hundred promotors' shares in the company, and I am sure I am only expressing the feeling of disgust which many others share as to the conduct of those who ought to know better than to do as they have done heroin Yours, etc A SHAREHOLDER.
