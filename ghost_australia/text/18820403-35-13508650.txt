lined promissory notes for £100 in my hands before hotels for england and the Hon J Campbell, Walter Dmglas, 1 sea and others have again encouraged us by promises of further help When we consider the origin and the religion of a cathedral as the symbol of the unity of the Church in a diocese, all parts of the diocese being united in community of interests under one ecclesiastical head, we cannot but wonder at the backwardness of many who wait to be aged and pressed to enjoy the luxury of doing good Nevertheless, the committee look to all the members of the Church in the diocese for self donviOg contributions as well from a sense of obligation to help the no other church of the whole diocese, as from a feeling of gratitude to the parish of St Saviour s, Goulburn, for the large subsidies annually bestowed upon other parishes, as well for stipends to the clergy, as tor grants to church buildings A sum of nearly 8000, in addition to other large benefactions, has been contributed in the city of Goulburn within the past 17 years for the benefit of all the other parishes of the diocese Is it unreasonable to expect that those parishes, now advancing many cases to the stage of self supporting power, will, in return for past benefits and in gratitude to the Giver of All Good, combine by a universal ii effort to raise at least half that amount (£4000), and thus help us to render the cathedral be for public worship J If each parish would HUSO £110 towards the! building we should still be locally obliged to obtain or to contribute another sum of £1000 in addition to all present promises in order to meet our engagements with the con- tractor for thereof (Mr John Series of Sydney), and to complete the interior fittings In conclusion, I must add, that costly gifts for the cathedral have been freely bestowed, is, a magnificent carved stone pulpit, the gift of friends in England an equally beautiful carved stone font, the gift of a politic a most handsome and valuable silver service for the holy communion, the noble memorial gift of Mrs O'Brien of Douro, and a splendid polished brass eagle, the offering of Frederick I ooth, Esq., of 1 rich find and a
