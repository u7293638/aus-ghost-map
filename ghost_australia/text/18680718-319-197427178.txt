I was going to ask of Mrs Hollingford formal permission for my visit to,London,.and to say good-bye to her and the girls. I cried' sadly to myself walking over the happy moor and 'through the wood. I 'felt unutterably ' lonely and woebegone. I! was. going to part from my only friends, and, the separation wua us; miuu. ..x- nuow iuuu iuia Hollingford would blame me, and I felt it: h^dly worth my -while to defend myself; ? -I1 had quarrelled' with' John, and 'broken,' our, erigagemont. I was going to, London 'with gaje^r.. friends. Everything was. against me;, all the wrong seemed mine. I knew that the dea|r old- lady would say little, ©rily- look sad and disappointed, thinking in her heart that things wbrb'turnirig putnishohad prophesied; . would give me full permission to go where I pleased, and do what I pleased ; would kiss and bless me ; and then I should have the wide world before me. *?? - : ?- ' -; It was a radiant May day. A saint has said that 'peace is the tranquillily of order;''and such a peace brooded over the happy farm as I crossed its, sunny moadows, heard the bleating of its lambs, the lowing of its kine, met its' laborors coming and going. : An idler was piping somewhere in tho fields, the rooks were cawing, tho loaves on the boaghs just winked in tho breeze, the hall door' lay open as usual. I did not see a soul about, and I walked in without summoning any one. I opened the parlor door; the place smelt of May and myrtle, and there were fresh roses in the jars, but there was no one there. No one in the kitchen; dairy, still-room ; the maids were abroad this glorious noon. I wont up-stairs, looking for a face in vain till I came to our sohool room.
