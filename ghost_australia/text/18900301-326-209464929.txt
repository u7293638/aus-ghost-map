The Sin of Omission. Br Mabgaket E. Sangsteb. It isn't the thing you do, dear, Ik's the thing you leave undone, "Which gives you a bit of a headache At the setting of the sun. .the tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The dower you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted 7 Uut of a brother's way, The bit of liearthsome counsel, t- You are hurried too much to say. V The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone, "v. That you had no time nor thought for,' With trouble enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, These chances to be angels, "Which even mortals findâ€” They come in night and silence. . Each chill, .reproachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith, For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing to do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter headache At the setting of the sun.
