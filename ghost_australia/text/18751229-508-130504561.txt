He -kipt faith with her in this respect; Until yesterday morufne whan, about 10 o'clock, he called at tie .cottage in JTihder's-laoe. where Buckley lived. The hoiue i« one of a range of four, between RusseH'anil Steven streets, and consists of n fp-ht .'parlour and * back bedroom, both, meretriciously furnished after the j Ktyie of cuch abodes, with premises .to .the raaq, where' ilie ostensible lady of the house and her children ? ?i*Bpt.^J}nfi.iif the youngsters opened-the door. whims \- iecttjHMt knockedViiid, in accordance with- directions, ♦ informed Buckley, who was then in bed with*Tnafi, in , the back room, that '-a gentleman wanted, to sec Jier.' She, notkaowiaK who it was that. inquired for, her. mat wordfor him to call again. The. message! 3iaWng been conveyed to Miwkcwite, he left, stajaag! that lie would return about 1 o'clock. ,. The, woman,' rHKjuird to be aware who the visitor was, and accord ingly was prepared ? for him at the hour uamtxi. Punctually to promise he arrivod. He seemed troubled :aud ill- tempered, and without saying anything entered the parlour and took his seat upon u sofa. Buckley approached him in a friendly manner, and, placing Jier hand upan his shoulder, made some inquiry, about his going to'' the country. He said that he intended starting on the following day, and asked her if she .had got any money. She opened her purse, and Aiaudod him a' sovereign. Some conversation ensued as to what he purposed doing with the money. He replied that several articles of clothing belonging to iuia were in pawn, and he wanted to release them so Uut they- might . be useful to him in the country. This Batisfied her, and, on apparently friendly terms, he rote to take his departure. When at the hall door he stopped, and turning round he said, in tones that indicated determination, ' I shall return this evening .atflo'oteck, wjthout fail: Mind, I am determined to mx you, and 'therefore do not fail me.' Bhe said, ?' All right,' end he then went awiy. Shortly af ter %he hoar turned he knocked at the door, and there being .at the time no one else but herself in. the' house she gHve him admission. They both proceeded to the bedroom, and she, in the first instance, suggested th%t wile xhonld return him the pawn-tickets of his clothe* and other articles which she had in her pos twusiou. His manner was alls' racted, and the expres sion of his eyes was wild and revengeful ; but she 4ook ns particular notice of this until, he leaned over nadfltraclcher in the fase, at the same time .throwing a ..jtmutity of silver on the floor. This sent her seeling :agft«ut'thebed, on to which he pressed her, leaning -*ver, .and holding her down with a sort of convulsive effort. He.tlfen raised one of his fingers, and ad dresaing her said,*' Do you- see that? That is* ring ?composed pf ryour hair.' He at the same tune drew from his pjjkst a omul! pistol, .which he showed her. iTlie woman, believing he was going to shoot, shrieked and struggled to escape. The next., moment ;»he ? wear* artfort,and'fclt her hair nod faop deluged with ?Hood. She was so' terrified thnt f or a time she^re^ attained insensible, and on returning to consciousness, j*1m found herself lying on the bed and the room in ?darkness. She ' row, and looked about, and in the gloom distinguished! the body of her husband, hor ribly disfigured, lying on the floor beside the bod. She misned tolhe'door/ and in doing so had to stumble '.over the ottrW and cried for help. . Disturbances are -mifortuatitftly nnt rftrittpn in snc.h plarpo. ?« *.h»t n«ithnr *Jic noine of the piBtol repprt bor her cries created any .alarm. She succeeded after a time in escaping from rrJie root4,and then eoreuming like,% woman deranged, «he p«*d ap and' down the hall.' Ultimately the noise attracted attention, and several of the neighbours burst Sn, whea they found the unfortunate woman leaning ?over aud caressing. , the btood-stained eorp§e. A more tjekening sight could hardly be' imagined than was pre sented by the body. The deceased appeared a large ninu, with somewhat regular and prepossessing features. Me, in committing the act, had {Raced the muudeiof ..tbe, pistol jto hi*, mouth, ond fired it. The bullet took s=ntt ipi^ard ^urection, '^raVersing theMeft cheek, and oarryiiig away or splintering 'in fragments the entire .!cft heutisphereof the skull, leaving an aperture through which tke laceretod brains exuded, falling in amass mpju the floor.' Death, in its mint revolting from, . jmist have been instaataneous, and it was with difficulty the woman could be' dragged from the chamber. The upsctiusle presented .was truly terrible. Stretched; at #ull length, and filling up the greater portion of the racant space in ths ro:-m, A-os the b»dy the face and ?upper pntion covered with blood -that still trickled to the floor and added %a t!ie cnianguined jwol in whicli the head lay partly buried. The bed, with its elegant bwgings, all sprinkled with blood, the gaudy fur oiitnre. and pictures of women deaDlletees, conveyedan . idea of one of those tragic pictures of scenes of im morality and crime that, happily, are rarely witnessed amosgst us. Beside the body was found a document, from which it was evident that the wretched man had ?committed preaicditate-1 suicide from motives of jea lousy. The letter, vyhich is appen ed, adds, if p»s -niMe.s deeper and mare , ghastly shade to the affair, :«ul showethat the iniii miwt have been goaded to commit the. act while in a state of frenzy. It is us follows: — ' 17th December, lSTfl. — T write this in my propeT senses, nodi Intended to kill myself to-day, some way.
