THE ELEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS LOAN. CTo the Editor of the Bendigo Advertiser.) Sir,—I perctive that the Borongh Council, under a lamentable misapprehension and ignorance I of the nature of their own proceedings, are week after week calling up the ghost of their Resolution to borrow LI 1,000. ' - * j . This question of confirmation of that resolution has been once put to the vote, and not having been carried then by a majority of the whole of the Council as required by law, the resolution has ipso facto lapsed, is dead and can by no possible means be revived. _ I do not-know which is the more" absurd, the constantly-recurring notice of confirmation of a resolution long-since disposed of and rejected, or the notice to rescind a motion which is no longer in existence. The proposition to borrow LI 1 >000 is burked, beyond redemption; and the further discussion of the matter, whether by the ministerial or opposi tion side of. the Borough Council, is simply puerile and ridiculous. Some time in July 1869 this Council—should they still be bent on borrowing—may begin afresh by notices in ihe GazttU, &c..; Until then, nothing that they can do can make the special rate legal: I am. sir. vour obedient servant AMICUS CURIiE. 14th October.
