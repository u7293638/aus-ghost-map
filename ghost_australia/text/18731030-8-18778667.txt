THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH ANNIVERSARY. The annual services and tea and public meetings in celebration of the anniversary of the Congrega- tional Church, West Maitland, took place on Sunday and on Monday evening last The sermons were preached in the church on Sunda} b} the Rev T S Forsaith of Sydne}, the tea meeting was held in the behool of Arts, where about two hundred and fift} guests enjo} ed a sociable meal, and afterwards assembled in the church The pastor the Rev R T Hills, presided ov er the proceedings The choir sang the Hundredth Psalm, and pia} er was offered by the Rev T J Pepper The Chairman said he rejoiced at that meeting, that celebration of another anniversary, and he re- joiced also at meeting so many friends that he bad made during the past thirteen }ears, not only of his own congregation, but of other churches in the town It was true that he could not be insensible to the changes and the trials which as a congregation the} bad bad to pass through dunng the year Nevertheless, he certainly thought, and thought ver} decidedl}, that gratitude and hope should characterize them on that occasion Gratitude that they weie }et spared to see that God had graciously manifested His woik, Bnd had shown His power m their midst, notwithstanding unfavorable external circumstances, and hope, because of what they had experienced of God's long- suffering, of Hu power to sustain and to blesa in the past, because of the promises He had given them as to the future, because of what He had done and was still doing for them, around them and bj them , and above all, be- cause of what God is in Himself He thought therefore that though there might have been events in the past } ear which would cause depression in some minds, giatitudo and hope should in reality pervade their spirits, and that they should biace themselves up to overcome what was before them-weak though they weie in themselves they were strong m their God and in the power of His mi »lit He would not now take up more of their time-that was never bia custom on such occisions-but would call upon Mr Richard Proctor to read the annual report Mr R PaocTOB then read the iollowmg " Report of the Maitland Congregational Church for the Year ending September 30th, 1873 " Another anniversar} social re- înion affords your office-bearers an opportunit} of la}ing befoie }OU the report for the yeai Although our externals are not what human hearts would desire, we remember our Master's words ' The Kingdom of Heaven cometh not with observation ' and are thankful that with unbroken peace and unity we exist, retaining our ordinances, influences, and opportunities of witnessing for the truth in Chnst Jesus " We ha-"e been reminded that this is not our home, by visits of the ' last enem} ' At the beginning of the year one who for nearly fifteen years had been a consistent and esteemed member of our church was called away, and within the last few weeks another, in the morning of life, who loved her Sabbath School, i Church, and service of song, was taken, and from our Sabbath School two more have been removed by the same cold hand May we all hear, and be as ser- vants watcbingfor their Lord We bave Buffered more ] than usual by removals apart from other instances, in | the course of a few weeks between thirt} and forty souls leaving our town were also removed from our congregation Notwithstanding all changes in the Church, we bave had some additions, although we have had more removals, and at the last communion service the number present was above the average of the last two years " Our congregations remain about the same, and interest in the means of grace is well sustained "The young men's Bible class, held on Sabbath afternoons, maintains its existence, although it is now composed of entirely new members. " Uur Stations.-Through removals and sickness the attendance has varied, but services have been held as frequently as possible at Balclutha on the Paterson, and at Oakendale, about twenty miles dis- tant ; and it is hoped with spintual profit as well as with the appreciation of the hearers " The Sabbath school is as large as in years past, the average attendance very good, and the interest and perseverance of the teacheis unabated. " Our funds have fallen off, we regret to say, through removals and by reason of circumstances. Nothing has yet been done to reduce the debt of ¿350 on the manse: a little more earnestness and self-denial on the part of friends would remove all difficulty in this department. " We are thankful for the measure of grace en- joyed; and while we regret that there are many among us who stand aloof from Church membership, who should be in the Church, and being so united would be more happy and useful, we ascnbe honor and thanks to Him who has renewed them, and en- treat them to unite with us m unreserved consecration to Him who imparts to us truth and His Holy Spirit, that we, becoming one in Chnst Jesus, may abound In hope by the power of the Hoiy Ghost, and ulti- mately reach the measure of the stature of the ful- ness of Chnst. "James G. Mair, 1ti"«""".» "GEOBGEMooBE,jDeacons The Treasurer's statement wbb also read. The Rev. T. S. FoBSArrarose to move the adoption of the report, and was received with applause. He bad not expected to be called upon so early m the meeting, and he never felt himself very much at home on a platform, being in that respect like the late Mr. Jay of Bath, of whom he related an amusing anecdote. But he had very little difficulty m pro- posing the adoption of that report. He liked the tone of it. He liked the spirit that pervaded it. Although allusions were made in the report to certain discouraging circumstances connected with the his- tory of the church in the past year, jet be thought that on the whole they had rather cause to rejoice than to be sorrowful. He must confess that as far as his personal feelings went, be was very pleasantly disappointed with what he had Been and heard since he came to Maitland. He did not expect to see bo many evident signs of vitality as he had noticed If there was any defect it was in the report just read , in the little vein of regret and despondency runmng through it He thought it might have omitted the minor key, and have been pitched in a more joyous mood For joy is not only the Christian labourer's privilege, it is the Christian pilgnm's duty, whether regarded individually or as collective bodies of travellers Zionward. It is their privilege and their duty to rejoice always. If they would permit bim, he would touch a little more on the duty of culti- vating a joyous spirit during our earthly pilgnmage It was a very common notion that melancholy is a necessary ingredient in the Christian life: some people seem to think that just in proportion as a man advances in true pietj, so he must recede from oheerfulneas and joy. This mistake may proceed Irotn the very different estimate that men of the world and true Christians, form of joy, pleasure, and the elements which constitute happiness. And the mistake may be partlj due to the defective carnage of some Christians, who by their sombre and forbidding deportment forget the apostolic maxim, "rejoice," and bj their lachrjmose appearance countenance the popular error. But thej would agree with him that cheerfulness and joy were the essential elements, not the accidentals, of a truly Christian life. In the Old Testament, ex- pressions indicating joy were common in the mouths of the great and good men spoken of there. And what a noble resolution that was of the prophet what an exhibition of Christian expenence and de- termination. Placing things by his imagination in the most sombre and forbidding characters, he says. "Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be on the vine, and the labour of the olive sha'l fail, and the held shall jield no more, and the Socks of the shepherd shall be cut off from the field, and there shall be no herd in the stall"-he does not say " shall I weeu, shall I draw up a melancholy statement of my position," but " j et will 1 joj m the Lord, and will rejoice m the God of my salvation." And if it was so under the Old Testament dispensa- tion, it waB doubly so in the New. There the apostle, describing the constituent elements of a Christian life, would as soon have thought of leaving out the peace and the righteousness ab the joy, he gives joy a prominent place : "The Kingdom of God is righteous- ness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." lhe evidences of unrest and apprehension and dis- satisfaction which were visible m the world, were in his opinion manifestations of men's want of the knowledge of God, ard of the peace and joy that come through believing. Mm cannot rid him «elf of his religious instincts He too often seeks to gratify the cravings of his nature by having recourse to degrading pleasures, but he can find no solid peace and joy until he is willing to receive from God wisdom, righteousness, peace, sanctification, strength, and all the other ele- ments of a cheerful life There aie men who are above the necesoit} of yielding to the lower appe- tites, who shun the baser pleasures of sense, but who seek for pleasure in a way other than God appoints by the sole use of their reason, forgetting that man s wisdom is perfect foolishness, as his own righteous- ness is filth} rags But the jo} such men expenenced was very different fiom thut which God, through Christ Jesus, bestowed upon true Christians The prevailing tone and tendenc} of the age was to lead men to find happme s m cold and cheerless speculation They would strive to substitute for the joy which proceeJa from intercourse with a personal God, a joy resulting from the contemplation of a perfect 8} stem of natural laws They rejoice in the consciousness that the laws of nature are unaltei ible, that an irresistible force regulates all the operations of the universe, ana they idimt nothing above or beyond this force If Christians talk about rejoicing in the Lord, these men smile with scorn The language of this philosophy seems to be that devotion is all a matter of moon- shine, and that prayers are all in vain is not Law supreme, and can Law heal s These philosophers taught that you cannot oppose yourself to the opeia tion of established law, which would crush }ou, and that you must Jive under ami submit to those laws , and they would have men rejoice in such a state of thiDgs as that Such, however, had not been the teachings from that pulpit, and in thatchurch Those whohadlistenedtotheteichingsinthatplacehadread then Bibles and knew that the actions of Jesus Christ proved that He was the power of God.aud his words that He was the wisdom of God, the} knew that His power and wisdom and mere} a d love were adapted to all exigencies, and had learned to rejoice m something better than in unchangeable s}stem of organic laws They would learn fiom the philoso- phers »11 that they could teach them of science, but when they proposed to exclude the law-giver, they would rebel, the} would rise from the creature to the Creator, the} would obtain their joy from the Lord Jesus, because in Him is all fulness light, love, majesty, meekness, power, ands}mpathy-all that the} wanted to cheer, to f,mde, and to restrain He was full of perfection , He was unchangeable ns the ocean. The privilege of rejoicing tis a Christian was a very adapting punciple - the} could rejoice because of their ability to have personal access to Christ, an access which was »s real ai that of the shepherds on t ie p'ains of Beth- lehem, as that of the sons of Zebedee, or of Maltha who served Him in her house, and it could be had at all places and under all circumstances-at the nuptial feast at the tomb Christ could be met, and the jov of His salvation could be experienced The duty of Christians was to cultivate this jo}, not only when the worldsmile*,and when cucumstances were favourable, but also when depressiw and ti al beset them, and difficultiep had to be encounteied the precept was " Rejoice in the Lord alwav. s," the} should remember not to be butterfly Cbnstians and that all things work togethei for good to them that love God Thej should take that sentence as their kej-note, and learn to îejoice in the future, to walk with cheerful countenances, to remember tint though God had «ent them trials, He had also blessed them hitherto and would bless He urged them thei efore to lift up their heads, to walk hopefully and cheerfully and constantlj in that path which is as the shining light, shining more and more unto the perfect daj (Applause ) Mr J G Mair seconded the motion for the adoption of the repoit He denied that they were desponding, nnd urged the people to make up the deficiencies of the collections during the past \ear by greater liberahtj m the course of the present year The choir then rendered the anthem ' Forgive Blest Shade " The Rev Dr BoAOexpiessed his pleasure at being present at that celebration, und said he had been asked to speak of prajer aa relating to chuich pros pentj ilanj people had different ideas of what prav er is, but prayer would be correctly defined as a consciousness of our helplessness and of the all sufficiency of the Saviour Pra\er was simply the faithful utterance of the desires arising from our knowledge of our necessities The heart might thus be full of prajer, although the praj er be unexpressed We need not alwaj s expect an answer to prayer God may not give us what we want, but He will give us something better The blessed fruits of believing piaj er are joy and peace Prayer was the verj atmosphere of the Christian he cannot do without it 4nd as prayer was the necessity of a Chn«tian, so those who were placed above their brethren in the church, such as ministers and deacons, should be more constant in prayer than thev, and should moreearnestlyseekillumination from the Sun of Righteousness, so that they might reflect it upon those below them Prayer must be a steady, foithful looking to Jesus it must be associated with a meek and lowly spirit, with benevolence, with heavenh mindedness, and with a confident hope of a glonous immortality The Church needs light, and individuals need light, and light should be prajed for, no discouragement should anse from the apparent denial of prayers, for the praters were laid up as in a storehouse and would îeturn some day to the world as a shower of blessing9 Let them con inue to ask of the Lord and he would answer them abundantly out of His treasury of bene- fits (Applause ) The choir sang the anthem " Majesty ' The Rev J A Nola\ said he had been asked to speak of Christian liberality m relation to church prosperity Liberality had much relation to church proBpentj-more than people seemed to imagine One of the grandest things In the world is mnne\ Of course he did not mean from the miser's point of view , a miser is a fool as well as a sinner, but as being the representa- tive of all that is noble and useful and beautiful in the world It was monej that nudo the world to go just because money represents human activity and intelligence and benevolence, and human love and hum m nature It was one of the powers acknowledged bj God, bj which he would bring His Gospel to beal upon the world Therefore the monej question need not be regard»d as sordid but aa a question verj nearh roi ited to the prosperity of men's own souls and to the pros penty of the churches throughout the land He took this ground that Christian liber ility is a christian duty It was quite us much a dutj to give as it was a dutj to pray, and indeed if a man prayed much and gave little there would be soiw> suspicion of his sincerity (hear, hear) The test of his Chnsti anitj was the amount that he gave The Saviour re- quired at the verj outset of the profession of a Christian tho exercise of self-denial if a man would take up the Cross he must denv hitns»lf People were apt to say that thev could not afford to give more to the Church, but thej had no light to say that thev had no nght to saj, after having paid all their liabilities and provided or themselves not a few luxuries and comforts tint thej would then give the residue to the Church and the cause of God The old Jews did not give m that way thej gave of the first fruits And so Christians should do first give to God, and then guide their expenditure accordingly Thev should give proportionate!j to ttiPir means say they could affmd to give ten per cent of their annual income, ten pounds out of every hundred pounds, they could lay aside the mouey every quarter, or tbey could keep a regular debtor and creditor account, and see that the -egular contribution never fell short It was the duty »f Christians to give regularly, not at haphazard, but recognizing themselves as stewards of Gods bounty to them, which they had to return to Him The pnnciple of thank offe mgs was a good one they could not be said to give at all, indeed, till they felt they were giving,-till they realized that they were making a sacrifice He did not suppose that people meant to be etmgj, but they did want to be asked before they gave, and therefore collectors and organi£ation were necessary people must be ie minded of their obligations and it should be the duty of the collectors that no one escaped He was quite sure that a great blessing would rest upon the churches, if the duty of Christian liberality were more generally acknowledged (ADplause ) A collection was then made and an anthem, " Lord, for thy tender mercies' sake," was sung by the choir The Rev T J Pepper congratulated the church and the pastor on the state of things retsealed in the report He had been present at six ..nnirersary gathenngs such op that, and he remembered one onlj as successful as that one was He hoped therefore, that whatever of despondeney there might be m the report would be dispelled by the joyous and inspiriting character of that gathering He had to Bpeak on the subject of love, m its relation to church prosperity He looked upon this as one of the most important of the topics which had been presented It was the verj basis of true church prosperity It was one of the strongest of all bonds of union, it was the divinely-organised basis on which the family rests, and the family was the model society, presenting to us an example of how every other section of society shall be flamed A family wanting love, a family m which there ib disunion and dislike, though it might possess wealth and many of the elements of prosperity, could not prosper And so with the Christian Church Unless there be love-responsive affection between the mem- bers of a church-though there might be indications of proepenty, yet no true prospenty would be found And for this reason that the spint of love was an indication of the presence of the spint of God That spirit was necessary to true prosperity, which did not consist in great wealth, or in numbers, but m the growth of holy character, in such progressas was the result of tne conversion of sinners True prospenty was present in a church when its mem- bers were banded together in ardent affection, and when a Church had such members, its progress was secured They wanted manly earnest men in the church, such men ensured its progress, and if tbey had them, and they were animated bj mutual love and by love to Christ, that church, though small, would ray out its influences over the land ne had been asked to propose a resolution nnd he did bo with much pleasure It was that the thanks of that meeting be given to the ladies who provided and sorved the tea, to the members of other churches who had assisted the choir, and to the choir for their services (Applause ) The Rev J E Cabbuthebs seconded the resolu- tion. the Chairman on putting it, added "the ministers who had spoken," and in this form it was carried by acclamation The proceedings closed in the usual manner.
