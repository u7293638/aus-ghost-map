The Lord Jesus said truly- They hated me without a . cause," The cause on His part was goodness—" Full of grace and truth." 'On the part of His enemies, the cause was their own - malice, envy, : iand natural hatred of the truth;1 There cannot be ; a tru9 spirit of humility be fore;; God where- these feelings exist. In the' present day this is more u'otioe- able in professing Christians' than in the mere I worldling, ' for Satan " will keep his people blind -as to- the/; trup state of their, hearts in the sight'of God. Christians, whose' fate - is; weaik,ioarb often mistaken:; about the -triie ; ctJri- 5 dition of their own souls,'" until 'the' Holj Spirit gives- them '-'more light, iCh'rist said to the two disciples, ' "Ye knoto inot ivhat.manner of spirit' ye arq 'of..'.' .When> i - people ' are ' -habitiiallt prone 'to f set themkel vies' up 'to -pa'ss' Jiwij D;ivit>qiio giiirtioii'yi ithij jiull ' , bitter judgments on others, they can not have much unction from the Holy . One, if any.. The pangs they cause to- a sensitive spirit may wean the heart from esrthly friendships ; perhaps God knows that nothing ebe would do it. The Lord Jesus was bruised : He was despised and a reproach of men. If this were the case with Him, no wonder that His people are similarly treated. But the Holy Spirit imparts com fort as well as unction They who- would follow the Master to His crown must do it by the way of the Cross. All His people have an unction from1 the Holy One, but hot -all , who call themselves'Cliristians. ' Neither do all possess it in an equal degree,, thou gh- if t'rqeOhristians, ' they' ;-(must\ possess- some Vneasure of, 'it; hnwevei; 'small. 'Christ joh'iisessed the ,unetibn "froim'-the Holy One/without 'measure'. All the graces of the Holy Spirit were infused into' His human nature at once. His divine na.ture rendered His humanity capable of being 'endowed with a;larger portion. of '.the Spirit than any mere- man had a capacity to receive. Thoueh He received the fulness of the . Holy 'Spirit. at once, the "graces were mani fested in the , Exercise of them as He grew, ' " J esus increased in wisdom and stature, 'and ihj 'favour 'with God and mad-" " When He was made flesh,. He W'if<fplofgrahd;trath.,' He wa's'atidinted .visibly/at His baptism, on'His 'entrance upon His office; it \yas a visible t-pkeh', of His Father's approval of Him. , /God anbinted Him : Thou- ii.aist '; loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore; God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with oil of gladness, above thy. fellows." He ap plied the words in/'tha' .prophecy, of Isaiah to . Himself. :V "/The Spirit of the Lord God is'.up'oh ine ; because the Lord' hatli ah'oi ri ted m a to preach good tidings Tirlto1 the nieek."
