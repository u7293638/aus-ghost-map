A PACK BORSE ANfi A HACK. (Br 'Ghabtebs Jabdyke, Patoni') CHAPTES 1. THE TOWHSHIP ASD THE FOLK. Buhdqob&bill;? is a dirtyi dusty, dreary little township in Central Queensland, i Its chief characteristics are sin and sorrow and sweat — and . occasionally shearers on Btrike and battered blacklegs. In spite ot its isolation and many, other drawbacks, it is not always, in a deadand alive state, like ee many of tbe blistering, poverty-stricken, collections of gelvanised iron-roofed houses and 'humpies' oalled by courtesy and country pressmen ' rising inland townships.! No ; Bundoorabilly is often lively ; and onoe.a year, at l.east, it is b'ureting^ with full-blooded life and intense excitement. This is, when it holds high revel on the local racecourse. The annual race-meeting is held just after the end of the shearing, when the' shearers and ' rouseabouis ' come in from the outlaying stations — many to havo a few days spell before proceeding to their heiiseb in various Darts of the colons', i whdre their tidy .cheques will be very use ful in the way of ad'Jiag furfW necessary improvements to their selections, and the unfortunate rest (a burn holes in their cheques— aye I and holes in their Btoinachs^ too ; for the grog which is sold at thp twe puba bf the township is a devilish decoa tion, that pnts_ hell into many hearts that would' otherwise be stout, and true, and elean. And yet so used are some of thesb bilihinen to fiery grog tfiit they won't pa^ fbt tlib liqubf unless it ' bites.'

Although it is only ust past breakfast hour, tbe main and - nly 8 1 roe t if full of bustle and activity. 8- me of the Bport-seskers are boisterously jolkr, and as he passes ' The Shearers' Best, by J. S. Oreogb,' he is hailed effusively by a party of shearers on the wide verandah. 'Hey! mister; thafs the wrong road to tbe boilin' down: Torter turnod ter yer left Aa Ver wfSnt parrf Hobp War's froit-shop,' shouted one. 'Git orf, an' mate th' blanky mokes Swap loads,' said another. ' What a hapologee for a horse ! W'jy he's not fit ter feed crows.' ; 'ggy, ohaps, what price the Livin' Skeleton ? ' ' Yer edd eennt his blahky ribs with yer eyes shut ' Garn ! Wy, he's going to win th' Pnblican's Pnrse, he is.' The stranger pulled up after the first few retnafks, and legan to cut up a pipe ful of tobacco under this fire of chaff. When there was a lull in the sWfm hS said : ' Hev you coves finished slingin' muck at me ? ' looking half afraid, half defiant: ' rah !

' But 'fe race day, an! we're all on the razzle-dazzle ; Ain't we chaps ? ' The stranger hiing his mokes up to the' rail in frent of the pub, and went inside, there \Ver6 thrcie fthoilts in as many minutes. It was noticed that the stranger drank bottle ale. 'Yer go in fur a torfs drink, I Bee,' said one of the shearers, in a mildly remonstra tive tone. 'No, not in general ; but I'm only get tin', over a dreadful doin' I got down aotiih a Int. Ati' fed I ain't takid' any hard tatok now; bt stiyhdw -very, vftry littlb. I don't cafe toiueh fir this bloomin' rot-?ut sttiff.' As no groom had yet appeared on the scenej the stranger led his horses round to the stables, only te find that there was no room; eo he returned with .the horses and hitched them up again. The men yarned, Aiid smoked, and lied, And drank till about iO o'clock, and by tbat time most of the parly were vAry squiffey, and the stranger appeared to be the tightest of the cro#i He sang ' Two Little Girls in Bine ' and ' 'jj Da nno Where 'E Are,' while the cook from the surveyor's camp, a few miles biit of town,- played pianoforte accompani ments, which consisted mainly of all the five-finger exercises he could remember. The applknse was so liberal and so pro longed that the. stranger shouted, though the shearers didn't want him to do so, for,' as they said, he was nearly 'strung,' while they wfere ' flush;' GHAPTER I1L THE BAGE& At II o'clsok a start was made for the racecourse.
