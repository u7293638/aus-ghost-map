THE POET AND THE GHOST AT WOOBSIDE, An Original PoenfByThomas Meddal. ( Copyright Strictly Reserved.) Coming home from Woodaide One starry night from the post, A "figure stood before me Which jnst looked like a ghost. It issued from the Wesleyan Chnrch, All purely covered in white ; It looked quite awful solemn Upon a calm and quiet night. CHORUS. Young men, be careful how you act To men of genius sight, For they will sure to overcome Their enemies in the fight. I stood surprised with open eyes, With my mounted stick in my hand ; When the ghost said " I do claim yon " Then quick went down my stick so grand, Which quickly uncovered the ghost And showed his face to view, Who danced about quite lively ; Also Tommy Meddal too. It really made him stagger, Throwing off his winding-sheet, For lie thought old Satan had him For being a perfect cheat. He then sprang wildly at me Without a word or mutter ; Then again went down my stick, And we both fell in the gutter. We scrambled about together, But he did not like the treat; . M Then he shook himself together And ran down to Moff^t-street.
