THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND NAVY From the Morning Post.) The uncertainty which prevails with regard to the relations between England and Russia owing to the Areas! frontier question imparts additional interest to the state of the Russian military and naval resources The condition of the army of Russia was fully dealt with in an article which appeared reoeD I lay in these columns, and it will now be suf lenient for the purpose to state that, omitting from our chief lation non-combatants, Russia would in case of warheads to place into the hold at once 758 000 infantry, 53,000 rifle men, 56,000 cavalry (included in which force there would be 14 independent cavalry divisions, with 168 guns) in creased immediately by about 48 000 combatants by the formation of 79 additional Cossack regiments 88 000 artillery, with 346 guns, and 3000 engineers The above figures are based upon a work published quite recently on the Russian army, which enables us to form an accurate estimate of the land forces at the disposal of Russia The figures given show that that country possesses a Hold army of 1,038 000 combatants with over 3600 guns As however, according to the same source, in case of a mobilisation, an infantry reserve of 400,000 men would at once be available, the grand total of a possible Russian Hold army could be raised to 1,438 60 men But this does not by any means represent the real fighting strength of Russia, for there is available a second reserve, the first class of which would supply nearly 2,000,000 men, whilst no estimate has yet been formed of the number comprised in the second class It has been observed by a recent writer that Russia is practically unassailable in Europe by England To some extent the justness of his conclusions must be admitted but surely he cannot overlook the fact that in case of hostilities the Russian navy could not hope to successfully cope with that of great Britain Alarmists in this country notwithstanding, our navy is still a weapon not to be destroyed and the Russian Government knows very well that great injury would be inflicted by our ships At the same time, it would be folly if we omitted to take into account the tnsive power, such as it is which Russia possesses in her navy It is true that navy within recent years receded from the third position, which II formerly occurred, to the seventh place among naval Powers, yet it is still formidable enough to be respected as the following statement will show the Russian navy n divided into four divisions, the Baltic Fleet the Black 5c elect, the Siberian Fleet, and the Caspian Fleet. of which however, only the first two need be taken Boriouilf Â£10 accounts the Baltic 1 lost comprises 32 ironclads - vi? 6 turret frigates 8 armoured cruisers (3 of them building) 1 easomont ship, and the battery ships of the old type all classed as battle ships, besides lJ monitors for coast defence, and all launches before 1867 94 torpedo ves cars and boats 24 cruisers, , 2 torpedo ram cruisers (1 building 12 clipper ships of the new and 3 of the old (yee, 1 frigate, and 6 flush decked corvettes, 12 gunboats of the now and 5 of the old type 30 yachts , 9 steam yachts, 4 steam cutters, and 17 sailing yachts, and i'J transport, harbour, As , ships (2 building), of which only 1 are sailing ships (1 building) total strength of the Baltic Hoot 248 vessels of all classes (of which 5 are under construction). The Black Sea fleet comprises 7 ironclads viz 3 turret ships (all building), 2 Popoffkas, and armoured gunboats, 14 torpedo vessels and boats, 7 cruisers of the volunteer fleet, 3 auxiliary cruisers, 86 other un armoured vessels , 2 yachts 2 Hush-dock corvettes 1 screw-steamer 2 paddle steamers, 14 scrow-sohoonen, 1' vessels classed as steamers, 45 small steamers, 1 mine (hip and a fire ships Total strength of Black Sea Fleet He vessels of all descriptions, some of them, however, very of the three most powerful ships of that division of the Russian fleet are still under construction As was stated above, the Siberian and Caspian 1 feats do not count for much, and the latter would only come into requisition in case of an Afghan or Persian war for the transport of troops but to make this return complete they should be included The Siberian fleet comprises 6 torpedo boats, 1 clipper, 3 transport vessels, 4 gunboats, 14 steamers of various sizes, and 18 sailing vessels total, 40 vessels The flotilla of the Caspian consists of 3 scion gunboats, 1 Screw Steamer, 7 paddle steamers, 8 small steam vessels, 8 sailing transports, 3 other sailing vessels, and 3 are ships total, 33 vessels As the Caspian would, in case of a war with high vntstan, become an important route of communication, the deficiency of steam transports ought to be noted Russia also possesses some naval material on the sea of Aral, consisting of 6 steamers and about 20 Billing vessels but, leaving those, as immaterial, out of the reckoning the sum total of the Russian Navy amounts to 412 A ess Is of all descriptions Of this number, how ever a great many are almost useless and confining our ches to really efficient ships we find that Russia has only 185 of them were able for Service, 2 being ironclads (10 battle ships 13 coast defence vessels of the monitor class, and 2 armoured gunboats), 1 torpedo ram cruiser, 14 torpedo boats, 29 unarmoured cruisers, and 16 gunboats, besides a large number of transports, are We have not included in this estimate 1 casemate ship and 5 battery ships of an old type, nor the 2 Popoffkas nor finally gunboats and < raisers of antiquated pattern which would not stand the ghost of a chance in a naME encounter. In a possible collision in Afghanistan between, til r country and Russia, only a small proportion of the women e military forces at the disposal of the latter could be unfit d at present If a struggle were to take place now, Kuru would have to draw in the first place upon the troops located in Turkestan There are at present of regular troops 10 but lions of ii fies recruited and stationed in the 1 range spine pro\ rates say about 10 000 men There are no data available as to the number of cavalry and artillery (garrisoned there, nor of the irregular forces that could be raised on the spot in the next place, the Russian Government has a large force in re serve in 1 ranaeaucas a which it is at liberty to employ either in the direction of Turkey, Persia, or Afghanistan Russia his at present permanently stationed in the Transcaucasian provinces an army which, in a peace footing, numbers about 8000 men, but which will no doubt, be largely augmented by the introduction of compulsory military service in that portion of the Empire in case of war a considerable portion of the army would probably be shipped across the Caspian by way of Baku and Michailovsk, but the chief supply of combatants would be drawn from European Russia, over Odessa to Port, and thence by rail to Baku and across the Caspian. The most serious obstacle to the employment of a large force is the difficulty of transport The Trans Caspian Railway extends at present from Michuilovss to Kiztl Arvat 135 miles, only a short way to Herat which H 628 miles from the Caspian port, but there can be to doubt that its gradual extension to Aakabad, Sarakhs and Here is only a question of time the respite thus route to England ought to be made good use of
