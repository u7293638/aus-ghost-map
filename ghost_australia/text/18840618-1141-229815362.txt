THE CAULFIELD BRACELET MEETING. By "Vigilant." Tue general entries for Saturday's meet ing under the auspices of the V.A.T. Club appear in another column. As the weights will not bo uublished until noon to-dar. 1 am unable to analyse tbe chances of the different horses engaged. Eighteen performers over the little sticks bare been nominated for tho Hurdle Race, as compared with sixteen last year. The Victoria Gold Cup has not filled as well as Mr. Bond would haro liked, only six animals baring been entered. I scarcely think I shall be far out in tbis case if I couple last year's winoer, Black Jacket, with Fickle to furnish the winner. The number nominated for tho Bracelet this time ehowe a marked fatiing-off as compared with the two previous years. Against 55 in '62, and 57 in '63, the total of 41 ibis season looks small. As a matter of fuel, moro horses started for the raco last year than hare been entered this. Tbe Steeplechase lias attracted an entry of nineteen, as compared with twcnty-ouc last year; and the Richmond Handicap, which takes the place of the Selling Race, has twenty-four " milers " engaged. "From information received" I hare a very firm conviction that the Bracelet will be won by a Caulfield representative, and the best handicapped of Weekes' horses should about land it again this year. From what I know of the work performed recently, I like Countryman, Bassanio, Tue Ghost, and UmbbbtO; and, chanciog tho weights, will hazard an opinion that COUNTRYMAN or UMBERTO will win, with Buesanio and The Ghost close up. As I am now writing in blissful ignor ance of the probable imposts which Mr. Barnard will allot these horses, I need scarcely add that this tip is based entirely on the pre sent condition and past performances of the horses named.
