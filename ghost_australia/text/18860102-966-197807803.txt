We publish the following this week :— " What is the name and number of that novel in your hand?' " * Nature unveiled' with all the latest neics from no man's land." GRECIAN. Would you think it strange or novel, Were you sleeping in a hovel, If seme goblin, ghost, or sprite Suddenly at dead of night Called your name, disturbed your slumber, Told you plainly of the number Of the hours you had to live? Would you credence to him give 5 Would your nature acquiesce? Would you calmly answer ye ? Xo. Tour courage would refuse To believe the hateful news. NAUTILUS. In news-papers and novels, In weather fair or foul, 1 he farmers, we are often told, Have got the name to growl. It may be so, for all J know. But now they have some reason, For nature has withheld her stores In tbis unfruitful season. A number struggle all the year, To find their efforts fail; No news to cheer poor Whapstraw's heart Arrives by any mail. YARRA. " As preciousointment, so is a good name." A noble-man is one most free trom blame, And all can true and nolle be. Among that number great was Alfred's fame; It lives, for it is even now the same ; No king more wise or great than be. News of lamented Gordon now to hand Reads like a novel in this distant land, For sad indeed his cruel fate: Though dead he lives in public estimation Like nature fair, the glory of the nation, Faithful to his Creator, Queen and State.
