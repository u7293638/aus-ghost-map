©riginai flaetrg. A WAYSIDE FLOWER. With* happy sigh I wonder why One little eprifi of a wayside flower, With color and scent sweet as content, Shonld soothe my soul like a spell of power. A slim white vaee of antique grace My thred of autumn btightneBB holds, Just where a glance of eon may chance To kindle its misty greens and polds. Dark was the day. the skies were grey With threatening clouds and feints of rain, Asd over bill the wind, with shrill LatEtct, came to my lattice pane. 'Ala?,' I said, ' the 11 -wers are dead, Tbe gusty woods ate shaken bare ; W»n p&apetBB; chills the distant hills— Tbere is no brightness anywhere.' Then innij batd this fragile Etraad Of bloom so3-e one dropped carelessly ; 1 could sot hirfe the tcshiug tide Of teats that rose *nd blinded met A glance— a cord— rc»y touch some chord Of life long hidden, and dumb, and cold. And quicken and v?ake seme dead heartache To tbe grief and los.gipg we knew of eld. So sweet to me &s; the memory Of one who gladdened the bygone years, Tbe strange perfume of-this bit of bloom Thrills me with a pastioa of j --y and tears. And the long lost waj s of tbe vanished days Wi«h sudden glory grow plain and bright, And 1 wander through the sun and dew With the beautiful ghosts of my youth to night. The darkness falls on the cottage walls, The wi'd rains beat and the rough winds blow; With a happy eigh I wonder why The soul within as is fashioned so That in the gloom my narrow room Shines with a glory of dreams long fled, Eecanfe this spray, from Borne dim way Afield, hath power to wake the dead.
