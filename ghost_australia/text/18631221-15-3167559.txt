The foundation-stone of the new Congre- gational Church at Goodna, near Woogaroo, was laid on Thursday last by Mrs. Goggs, of Woolston House, in the presence of a nume- rous company who were gathered together to witness the ceremony. At 4 pm. the pro- ceedings were commenced by singing and prayer, after which an address was delivered by the Rev. E Griffiths, of Brisbane, who ex- plained the objects and importance of the work which was commenced in this formal manner. The declaration or history of the church was then read by Mr. Draper, who has very successfully ministered to the people for several months. The declaration itself, written on parchment, was enclosed in a sealed bottle, which was immediately after- wards deposited in the stone. Mrs. Goggs then proceeded to perform the great business of the day, and having spread the cement in a true workmanlike manner, the stone was lowered into its place, and finally adjusted by the lady with mallet and level, the Rev. Mr. Griffiths announcing that the stone was laid in the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Donations were then laid on the stone, and the proceedings were con- cluded with the doxology and prayer by Mr. Kirby, of Ipswich. Messrs. Godfrey and Johnson are the contractors for the erection of the building, and are progressing with the work most rapidly. Only a fortnight has elapsed since the contract was signed, and already the framework is up ready for the roof. The design is neat, and the building is calculated to accommodate about one hun- dred and fifty persons. On Saturday morning last, an ingenious mid woll-planned robbery was successfully carried ont, by which Mr. Bennett, of the West Riding Hotol, Queun-stroot, lost a cash box, contaiuiiig cash and pupers to tho valnu of Â£30.

Sollie little timo elapsed before it was found, and when Airs. Bennett returned to thu bur, both her cash-box mid tho in- dividuals who had partaken ol'lier hospitality were non est.
