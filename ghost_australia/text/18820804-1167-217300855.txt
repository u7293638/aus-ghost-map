PRAYER AND FORGIVENESS. AUGUST 13—AFTERNOON. Reading, Mark, xi. 21—33. Golden Text, Matt. vi. 12. INTRODUCTION—Prayer is simply asking God for what we want. Our lesson specifics certain conditions to be observed in order that our prayers may be heard and answered. I.—RRATER MUST BE DEFINITE. Ver. 24. In daily life a hungry man asks for Iread— a thirsty man for water, &c.; So in prayer ; there must be a real need—this will find definite expression. Meaningless words travel over a large space of fancied desires, but true prayer is limited to the one object sought for. Instances—Solomon ffrtlrtiimri iivi* prayed fnv for " wisilnlll wisdom "-—Kliia.ll "—Elijah for "rain"—the disciples for the "Holy Ghost." See, too, the petitions in the Lord's Prayer, each one for a definite object. II.—PRATER MUST BE OFFERED WITH EARNEST " DESIRE." Ver. 24. " Whatsoever things ye desire," i. e., with longing (Psa. cvii. 9). There must be holy importunity : our Saviour sets forth this in the parables of the "Importunate Widow" (Luke xviii.) and the "Friend asking for three loaves " (Luke xi.). III. PRATKR MUST BE OFFERED IN FAITH. Yer. 2-1. " Beliece that ye receive them." This is a more "difficult part of prayer. There must not be a doubt in the heart if mountains, i. e. difficulties, are to be removed by prayer. We should not say in our hearts, "Can God do it?" but be certain that we are asking according to the will of God (1 John v. 14,15). This gives boldness and confidence, and " we know that we have the petitions," &c.; Refer to the Israelites blowing the trumpets and the walls of Jericho falling down. Abraham, too, believed God against the greatest seeming impossibilities. Notice that the prayer of faith honours God (Heb. xi. 11). The prayer of faith pleases and glorifies God (see Rom. iv. 20, and Heb. xi. 5, 6). XV.—PRATER MUST BE OFFERED IN EXPECTATION OF AN ANSWER. We must look out for answers, or as Peter says (1 Pet. iv. 7), " Watch unto prayer." Not only so, but if prayer is not soon answered, Paul says, " Watching thereunto with all perseverance." Elijah on Mount. Carmel—like him, we shall hail the smallest sign of blessing, though it be not bigger than a man's hand. Such prayer is not discouraged by answers coming in a digerent'way from our expectations. "It may not be our way, but yet in His own way, the Lord will provide." v.—PRAYER WIR/L NOT BE ACCEPTED IF WE CHERISH AN UNFORGIVING SPIRIT TOWARDS OTHERS. Ver. 25, 26, and Golden Text (Matt. vi. 12). We acknowledge in this petition that we owe God delts. In Luke xi.4 this petition says "sins." Our fellow creatures' debts to us arc nothing in comparison with what we owe to God. See parable of the " Unjust Servant" (Matt, xviii.), ten thousand talents in comparison with a hundred pence. Copy the example of Christ in the forgiveness of injuries (1 Pet. ii. 23, and Luke xxiii. 34). BLACKBOARD. P R A Y E Power to work for Christ can come only from God. Resolve to attempt great things for God. Ask in faith for the required power. Yield not to obstacles that may be in the way. Earnest efforts in Goi's strength will overcome them. Really forgive others, or God will not forgive you. R M. LEWIS.
