Amos had ' walked-out: with: Jenny Fair tcrst for ten years: The cinders on the canal bank knew- thlen' well by this time;. The hedges at Willington Green',. stunted and begrimed. with coal-dusti had seen -themr pass night. by night. But difficulties- arose, in the shape of Jenny's father; broad of: shoulder, strong: of ist, Amos was lean and small. ' When art tha'. goin' t' wed my- daughter £ asked the fond parent. 'Same day as she weds me,' wasstie accu-' rate, it impertinent reply. - ' Tha'll-put up th' askin's on Eunday, or I'll pnnch:thy head.' :- -- ' Then, Bill Fairhurst, .thal'l -punci my S= . ,-, e ad - ' ...." --,? . -", . , ta en :-:. up, and at the same timwe:Amon Green was very. much taken drqwi?. 'After so affectionate an interview,. Amos could hiot be expected to keep up his fon~dness for Jenny. . Sb?-the cinders knew them'no -more; the: hedges bore their nightly disappnintment courageously, and Jenny showed evidence of" an unbroken heart: by at once accepting. 'Thomas Baldwistle's invitation . to explore that end of Wiilington green that leads to. Willington ('ommon.. On three successive .nights., this was repeated, and Fairhurst, Senior again inter fered. ' Tommy,' he shouted, as the. couple stood Sat the gardi-n gate in the 'lengthy. task of parting. ' Tha can coom i'side Torimy-ca'e txee deawn ou't' ettle?: Tommy was mueek and lowly.

He had meditated a- physical display, a definite and unmiatakeable vengeance Billy wonld understand, But when he realised that in Amos' sch-eme Jenny herself would he humiliated, that possibly, when shel saw her dispensa bility and the dispensability of all women, she would come back to him, daring the wrath of her fire-eating parent, he began to see that Amos' sug stion was not with out its merits.

A generation before, one lived there named Emmanual Cartright. He was a maker of the grim but niecessary apparatus of death. It was said that, as a ghost, .Emmanuel still kept up his ghostly business. SEvery accident at the colliery hal. the rasping of his. saw and the- tap of his. hammer las. its premonition.

Amos bought three. antimacassars., .Tommy, not to be outdone;" bought paper lamp shades,. Aimos got cushions for the. leather-seated chairs. That wasa work offsuperogation, to say the least. . - . • Tommy then. ii.vestedia ahuge glass globe. in.which; there loate-: a ?peckled glass On the:Saturday they made up. their ac counts.. SAlas, they were not living quite so in expensively and as economically as Amos.had prophesied.. it must be admitted that Tommy was the more successful in the domestic duties. OucA.Amos found, on raising the turned down plate which hid that which his friend had prepared for his. evening meal, that hilfa dozen beautiful currant fritters lay there. i They were nicely browned. They reposed in a sweet,; soft bed of _butter. :'he very, smell. was?. intoxiqating . Yet Amos could scarce eat, so overcome t was he of envy. How could he expect, with his amateurish cooking, to go one better than buttered frit ters . But after a sixth had gone, a bright thoughtcame to his- mind, - A benevolent Christian yeara had arraniged Pancake Tuesday on the..- week. follow-' ing. That was his week .of night duty: at- the hoppit, and of afternoon dudty atthe afire side. He would make pancakes. ' Before Tuesday arrived thesch-eme` began to evolve itself. - Would it not be better if, he- asked some woman, upon whom he could, depend,-: to.. creep in at the back door, and make:the p-pan cakes for him Then-why not ask. Jenny .. Accordingly the while-Tommy was at-work; on this excellent Shrove Tuesday, none other. than Jenny Fairhurst was, though'- unknown; to the world, preparing his feast' of- pain cakes, 'Amos,'she said. 'Aye, lass. ' . 'Bast e'er tried a bit of lemmin ini-- :par cakes ... 'N e v e r . . _ _- " .
