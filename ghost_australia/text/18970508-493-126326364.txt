THE BLESSEDNESS OF WORE. If you would havo sunlight in your home see that you have work in it. Nothing makes moroseness and heavy-heartedness in a house so fast as idleness. The very children gloom and sulk if they are left with nothing to do. If all havo their work, they have not only their own iov in creating thought, in making thought into form, in driving on something to completion, but they have the joy of minister ing to the movement of the whole house when they feel that wliat they do is part of a living whole. Tho morning is bright with the knowledge of how much has to be done. The hour of rest or play is a true joy ; the evening hour, when all has been done is talked over, is delightful ; and, sleep, ' sore labor's bath,' is only another piece of plear' sant work. All eyes in that household look forward, all its members are bright, all honor one another. Everyday there is tlie light of something conquered in the eyes of thoso who work. Time, the gray shadow, tabes- sub stance, walks as a friend with those who work, and he is a charming companion when we make him out of a ghost into a reality. In such a house' .if thero be also -the good, temper of love, sunshine never ceases.
