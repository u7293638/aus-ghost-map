Select Poetry. LINES ON THE RUINED AMPHITHEATRE AT POMPEII. "— Where are the men of might, the great in soul? Gone!—glimmering thro' the gloom of things that were." Byron. The crowd are gone—not one remains Of all that mighty throng, Who gaz'd upon the victim's pains, And heard the victor's song. No sight, nor sound for ear nor eye, Is left, but ghosts are gliding by Of ages past and gone. The broken seats, the dusty floor, The scene, with ruin trampled o'er, All echo "They are gone." Yes! gone the mighty and the proud, The lovely and the brave! Time, Time, before thee all have bow'd, Nor 'scap'd thy whelming wave. Pompeii's vacant streets declare How great, how sure, thy victories are, Its cheerless scenes among: The pathway trac'd—where are the feet That mov'd along that empty street? To the grave's silence gone! For low is laid the arm of might, In combat nerv'd and strong: And hush'd as is the hour of night, The shouting of the throng. The stately Toga's graceful fold, Round many a noble form was roll'd, Now prostrate in the dust, And sparkling eyes are clos'd for ever, To open on life's pageant, never, Till Time shall yield his trust. The giant works of elder days, The lofty forms that were— Are vanish'd now, and we but gaze On what the ruins are. The humblest shed, the loftiest tower Confess alike the sovereign power— Of Time—the mighty one!
