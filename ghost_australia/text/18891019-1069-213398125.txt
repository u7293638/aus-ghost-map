THE OLD HOUSE. In through tho porehandup tho silent stair; Little is changed, I know so woll tho ways ; Here, tho dead came to meet mo ; itwnsthero Tho dream was dreamed in unforgotten days. But who is this that hurries on before, A flitting Blndo tho brooding shades among ? She turned — I saw her face — Oh God ! it woro Tho face I usod to wear when I was young. I thought my spirit and my heart wore tamed' To deadnoss ; dead the pangs that agonise. Tho old grief springs to choko me — I am shamed Boforo that little ghost with eager eyos. Oh, turn away, lot her not soo, not know ! How should sho bear it, how Bliould under stand ? Oh, hasten down tho stairway, liafts and go, And leave hor dreaming in the silontland.
