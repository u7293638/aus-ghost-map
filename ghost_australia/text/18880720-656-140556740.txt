babies'- (Column. Jiaohclor's Hall. By H. 0. Dudok. Hurrah 1 hurrah for Bachelor's Hall ; Tho Queen's away and I'm monarch ot all ; I don't have to hang up my coat or my bat, And when I get lonely I talk to tho cat. I como when I- like, nnd I go when I Choose. The finest cigars help me scatter the blues ; No bundles 1 carry, and nothing I buy j There's no ono to care about— only ' big I.' I revel in wildest confusion around ; ^ There isn't a thing in its place to bo found ; My books and newspapers, they litter thu room That hasn't for weeks seen the sight of a broom. Thcro's clothing or something on every chair ; - , My bed's never made, but it's little I care ;. I sleep like a top, for there's no one to call — I take solid comfort in Bachelor's Hall. I've used all the dishes, and now it's my fate To cat, when I'm home, on the back of a plate ; I'm learning to cook, but, alas, I confess I choose to go hungry than swallow the me6S. But, Bachelor's Hall with its comfort and quiet, Is almost too spooky for regular diet ; No children live in it to welcome their dad, No supper is waiting, no wife— 0, so glad. No I Nothing but ghosts of the loved ones away Inhabit this tomb where alone I must stay, Compelled to break silence by having a chat With my woful companion, the strange act ing cat. 0, gladly I'll yield (my crown sceptre and all The Kingly delights of a Bachelor's Hall To the Queen of the Home when she comes ? ? with her train To wisely and lovingly over me reign.
