The B"ene on the road to riemington would have nfforded a new arrival matter for continuous interest and amuse ment, for eierjthing on wheels was represented in the panoramic procession of vehicles, and every phase of colonial life among the occupants of the vehicles Despite improvements for the comfort and quick conveyance of visitors to the course by rnil, " the road ' has still its attractions for thousands of rncegoers and will continue to baie hot winds and dust notwithstanding Some few trivial accidento occurred an axle snapped here a wheel off there, and a shalt broken further on, but not the least of the many mnriellous things about Cup day nppears to be its almost absolute immunity from serious casualties of any kind The tojk of the Railway department on Cup day grows greater year by year as the population of the colony increases and the popularity of the great etent extends within and bej ond our b ir lers And it is a pleasure to record after the he mest Cup traflic on record, that the m inajcmcnt of that traffic is improving yearby j ear Of course thero was more or less crowding at the ticl et boxes and crushing tit tne gates, as there doubtless will bo whenever and wherever a multitude of people are endeavouring to get to the hame pluce nt the same time, but it is satisfnctorj to find the discomfort and incon venience decreasing while the number of passenger!- increases Nor are the ruilwaj officials nlono to blnme for such of the crush mg nnd crowding as is preventable. Hie sufferers must toke a share of the responsi billi) There would be le«s pressure at ticket boxes, entrance gutes and e\ en at the trains if the means provided by tho de partaient were moro equally utilised One or tw o examples from obaen allons of an impartial eye witness will serie to demon Btrate this fact Some of the ticket boxes at Spencer street were literally besieged at times, when the bool ing clerks a little further on were unoccupied Dal fa dozen men Bta tioncd ulong the ticket boxes would perhnps help to modify this tendency to rush the nearest ticket box and also mal e the people better acquainted with the extra facilities prowled for their convenience But it was the return traflic that furnished the most stril mg instances of the kind alluded to The Cup race over, there was the usual rush from the course to the station, and offer a time the gates had to be closed to prevent dangerous overcrowding on the first class platform nearest to the giand stand, and although there were scores and scores waiting to gum admittance there, only one solitary passen ger, a young lad), was to be st cn in the road leading to the Melbourne end of the same platform, and the second trams were minni) filled b) passengers who had struggled for udmission nt the first gates, while others filtered slowly through the gates specially provided On the whole the railwa) traflic was nd mirably managed nnd the improvements recently described in 'Hie Ai(iui added greatly to the comfort of the passengers, and their speedy come)ance from the course There was no intersection of the tivo classes of traffic the crush was less Bevere than in previous years and although one fifth larger than on the Cup dav of 1881 the race traffic was finished in considerably les time The returns of )esterda) a rnilwu) traflic, as supplied by the officials at Spencer street station show tbatthc total number of passen gers earned to and from the racecourse was C8182, counting tu o for each return ticket; once outwards and once homewards-against 52 950 on Cup day last year, and the receipts were £9,440 8s, against 18 51-1 17s last year The number of single tickets issued from the booking ofliccs at the racecourse Btation W113 1,910 jesterda) against 1,555 last )ear De ducting these smje tickets from the total given above, and dividing the remainder, it wonld appear that oier -.8,000 persons were come)ed b) rail to the racecourse slution j esterday, against 25,G40 last j ear, and 23,830 in lSST This does not represent, however, the full contribution of the nuhvajs to the sum total numbei ut tho races, for man) patrons of the flat prefer to travel to the course by way of lootscraj, the number j esterday being about 0,000 against 0,000 last year, so that ni all nearly 3o,000 persons journejed to the races by rail on Cup Day 18bj, or, in round figures, about 4 000 more thin last year, no inconsiderable addition to the heal y burden which the Railway de partment had already to bear, and it is to be mentioned, to the credit of the officers and employes concerned, that nota single casualty occurred to mar the record of the days labours _ THE TOLL The hill was throiifeed with a dense, bust- ling busy crowd, who laughed and joked or growled and grumbled ns the humour seized them. The first trains brought hundreds of people who were iinxious to secure the special places on the slope rising above the grand stand, and thence, till the Cup was run, one continuous throng fought the way from the railway platforms to the top of the rise The hill lins been aptly termed the family circle. It is the home of the better lower classes '1 bey m"ct there in friendly com malitj and find the spongy turf as plensant a resting place as the luxurious carnage or the exten sue grandstand 'Hie hill too had special advantages yesterday The pleasant breeze had not become surcharged with dust when it reached the spectatots tlieie, but it then bore with it the fresh odours of wild flowers, and the scent of roses from the adjoining garden But the cleai heat and tempering wind, mid the enjojment of fine weather, gave not a moment s thought to the great mass of the people who were congregated there, san that they were the elements re quisite to ennbic them to see and to oc seen Hie outstictched landscape, tho glimpse of distant hills, the green fields, the velvet) lawn with its natural embroidery of choice plants were secondnr) mattera in tina great turmoil But in the early part of tho day, when the clouds of dust had not dimmed the view, the sceno was sufficiently attractive to win a thought from even those whose bent of mind does not lean to the pic turi-sque The most popular resort for those who sought to escape from the chatter mg Babel on the lull lop was the charming hollow below the ladies' cloak room. Its comparative seclusion, the plensant shndc afforded bj the dark bolt of pine tiees, and the outlook on to the lawn, gave it special attractions to picmcers Every nook and every corner was occupied, but Btill lhere wns room lor all, and thanks to the ad nu rallie provision made bj the management, no convenience wns wanting that could add to the comfort of the visitois. Those who were shut out from this pleasant retreat by a desire for still greater retirement found it m the paddock at the back of the booths Hundreds con sorted there, and though they could gain no glimpse of the Bports beyond, jet it was evident that they did not lack the elements of enjoyment But the crest and grand stand slope of the hill was a wonderful spectacle Never before has it been BO packed with a mass of people. All around there was the same eager fight tor place, the Bnme parsimony ot space, and the same greed of situation YY omen struggling, men pushing, and courtesy or kindness to the weaker ones wanting The only class who seemed to have any consideration shown them were the bookmakers and sweep men The bright colours of the costumes of these dusses, their clamorous erics, and above nil their marvellous impudence won for them security from m trusión or roughness. '1 lie) were necessary to gratify the gambling instinct that dorai niited the whole of the people surrounding them. YY'hnt mattered it if the prices offered were abnormally short, or that the respect ability of the bookmaker or sweepraaker was certainl) not guaranteed by his countenance, the public wanted to uamble and did not care much how tbey obtained the excitement so long as they got it They took the means at hand, and were prepared to mete ont prompt justice to any defaulter who might feel in. inclined to trifle with their pockets Tho crowd were critical to a degree. The greatest rush to the hill was shortly before the Cup iras run It then presented the appearance of an immense cluster of bees. All that could be discerned was a mass of black heads that Bwayed Bteadily aa the horses began then preliminary canter The crowd, however gradually melted away irom the timo when the Cup was over, so that when the last raes was over there was not the crush that might havo been expected. THE TLAT The flat wns patronised to a greater eilenl than has been the case at previous Cup meetings There are people of a certain class who never value anything unless it ia procnred at personal risk or at some considerable cost while they have, their opposites n those who do not care for enjoyment unless it can be gained at the cheapest possible rate These latter are ths men who toiled all the way along the dusty thoroughfare to 1 lemington to particípatelo an inexpensive vv ny in the great racing car nival of the year Men were there who are recognisable at all the great mee meetings of the year, who live with ona eye continually upturned on the audio, ritics and who thrive upon the wea] ncsscs of the body politic, men who are Hie dronea of cities the waifs and outcasts ol society-pickpockets, sharpers, mngsinen, and vagabonda-together with their nora honest fellow men But the nuthon ties are so rigid in their control over the frequenters of racecoursc3 that none ol those opportunities now prevail which once existed of obtaining largo sums by question able meana The games of chance the «lu cated monkey, the three card trick and such like diversions hav e been banished and the only excitementpermitted to the people is that which can bedenved from themoderutcswecpi got up by themselves or by loud voiced pro fessionals It vv as v ery amusing to vv atch tho silent dismay of a party of men who had brought their implements to the ground but who hud been prevented by the iclice from using them This oppresse! them and thej snt in n bunch underneath the shade ol the steeple chase null with facc3 glum and low enuc.
