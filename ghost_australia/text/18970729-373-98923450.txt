He said lie belieres in keeping the ? fountain head of jastice onre, and he recognised ?that hud Mr. Moreliead's sUnden been true he ? was not fit to sit in Parliament. If he had Hnot been able to produce evidence to vindicate flMmsel'', he said, he would aot have otnce back »fr.Hn Western Australia, Elected to the B House on Aoril 25, 1896, he was asked for ? auitunce by lilorebead oo Hay 25, ,and besides ? g'Tin-^ him money he got liim a Volition at 9 Broken Hil), from which he was dismissed at g his (Mr. O'Malley's) instigation on July 21 H The first blackmailing letter was received H from Morehead on July 29, and when after H wards in tie steel he' was refused help More M fcaad threatened to go to Mr. Chittleboroogh 9a»?retar« of the Licensed Victuallers' ? Association and tell him some storks abcnt ? him (Mr. -/M alley). In Norember he entered I an acti m against Morehead and it was tried ? on December 2 and he was treated, he com . ? plained, as thoagh ho was the defended and ? Morehead the iofomaiit. *' Didn't the jodge ? advise yoa to go into the box ?' s&id; Mr ? oiomon, the reply was 'No, he said I bs didn't bedere either of a«.' *' What were ? you both Americans ?' asked Mr. Wood, and ? there w«s a Uasth, after which Mr. O'Malley M remarked that neither Mr. Uave, If r.

He did not I wish be *aid, to bol-ter himself up ob the i, ghosts of the depared wit ai-4 wjsdu'n of the I Jead members of the O'Malley ianrily, bat I sto id on his own character. He then read a _; letter from Mr. W. Dampy, manager nf the p Home Insurance Company, -&n; Francisco, .i from which Morehead had alleged he had been ?| diMiaisseJ. The letter began '? Vy cear King i and in it Mr. Dnm|-hy tt»id hu had nev--r met £ Morehead. and he categorically denied the £i statements that pcrnon had made ii ooncerninu Mr. Kinj O'Malley. Mr. W. A Damphy nninned that Mr. t/MaUey was in no g way indehted to him or tin compiny, nud bure y-- testimony to the taut of his trustworthiness * and reliability, concluding with a su^ge?ticn .' that he would be glad to insure his lit- for e[ 10.0K0 dollars. He enclosed a letter written .; to tiim -y Mr thittlebjiou^h on October j 19,1896. in his capacity as as Secret' rv of [' of what Mr. O'Malley somewhat bitterly 'des cribed as that - hrlstian progress aud exaltu-j t xiicenced Victuallers' AsacKiiation, which e pretended to have nothing to do with AJore . Ur. Dumphy also sent the answer iorworded n to Mr. Chittaborugh on i-coeinl-er 9. in whicb t in which he stHtetl that Mr, O'Malley was a Canadian and wrote of him as an energetic \- man of marked ability strictly honest, entirely v reiiab'e it nd trustworthy. ' Why,' asked Mi'. f O.SIalley with warmth was that letter sup. J; (jrets-d by the Association ? and members ^ cheered lusilr, as they did afterwards when * he asserted that it is ths duty of tha House to * protect its member. He states ihut he will ;i move to have Mr. Chittleborough broug t '( before the bar as won at pu si ble, nnd he VX accused tin Licensed Victuallers' Association o!

'Well I k w it,' ^ interjected Mr. Wood, fervently. He '] has evidently been kept awake. Mr. V O'Malley finally challenged the police to h enforce the Sunday closing law which now he 'y. asserts is flagrantly violated.
