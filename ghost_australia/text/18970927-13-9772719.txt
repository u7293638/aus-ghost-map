MONDAY, SEPTEMBER27, 1807. Great Britain bas put ber navy right. There is no moral doubt about her as- sured and enormous superiority in ships mid men to-day, and what is equally im- portant, it is now certain that she will easily lead the way for the next half dozen years. Ships can he ordered in a day, but they are not built la a year or two years or three or even four years in foi olga dockyards, so that the Butish arrangements, which are well under way, cannot possibly be overtaken. And now, acording to the cable messages, the national conscience is to be _tirred up about the army. Lord Wolseley, the comuiander-ln-chief,N appeals to have spoken out as plainly about the ill-condition ol' the army as did the Iron Duke in the forties, and it may bo shrewdly imagined that he will speak with far more success. The Duke of Wellington was disregarded, and Great Britain paid the cost in the Crimean War, where an army was literally sent to the grave through lack of clothing and of food, though its base was only eight miles away from its front. Lord Wolseley's way has been well prepared for him. His allegations are very far from being a bolt from the blue. The annual navy statement lu July last caused the House of Commons to purr with satisfaction, while the army state- ment provoked a chorus of dissent. A sum of £07,000,000 is spout upon the army, and military experts declared that, given au emergency, a fully ecjuipped army of 50,000 could not bo put in the held. And the Minister, Mr. Brodrick, half admitted the impeach- ment, avowing that tlie position as a whole was receiving the gravest con- sideration. Moreover, such writers as Sir Charles Dilke, Mr. Spencer Wilkin- son, and Major-General Maurice are all in the Held, with many others-, to Insist on tlie rule that the army must be adequate to maintain on land the empire won by the sea, and to assert that It is not so adequate to-day. Major-General Maurice is the last writer o» tlie subject, and perhaps the most qualiiied. It is 25 years ago that the author of "National Defence," then Captain Maurice, signalised himself by winning the competition for the Wellington essay, as against Lord Wolseley, who, as a junior officer, was also a competitor, and now the two officers, the one of whom has lind a teaching and literary and the other a fighting career, ave working for a com- mon object. General Maurice took up the cause of tlie navy first, and brought upo» himself some sarcasms from Lord Wolseley, who has bad his eye on the army, denying always that the navy itself can ever secure (.rent Britain from invasion. But this rightful deference to the navy rendéis the Maurice plea for the reform and the strengthening of the army all the more valuable. The Home army, according to General Maurice and the other experts, is unlit to meet ii sudden and serious call, because a modern organi- sation has not been adopted, and the central hide - bound administration which broke down in the Crimea i_ still largely existent. There is no life, he says, no initiative. Tims, speaking with all the responsibility of his position, General Maurice tells us "that " while France annually manufactures " sulliciont new material for the supply " of high explosive shells to her army " and navy, England has contented her "self with a few insignificant experl " ments. lu existing circumstances, "therefore, our soldiers and sailors " may find themselves in the presence " of au enemy capable of making as " short work of them as the Prussian " needle-gun made of tho Austrians "and their muzzle-loaders. Not only " France and Germany, but Austria and " Russia provide money for experi " ments, which England is satisfied to " neglect altogether." He lins other startling statements as to the utterly routine and non-iutelllgeut chnracn r of the administration. He describes it as wooden and Inflexible. "A supreme navy, an adequate army, " and a skilled diplomacy" are said to bo necessary for the proper development of the empire. The'first of these con- ditions tho empire happily has. The third It must hope for The second has only to be demanded bj the men placed in authority, and It will be supplied And no doubt the national ruléis will be on the qui ?vive Thej know that in these days xvlicn war is declined the one month and is over the next, an initial disaster-or an inability to mobilise- can scarcely be redeemed In the fifties the men responsible for the mllitarj fiasco in the Crimea escaped, because the d Isa stei s wete lcpaitod, the enemy being i o more capable th in we weie But since then the militaty art has been btightened in, and it would be fatal to Gieat Bntalu

to accept the expert evidence given before tile coroner at the inquest on the body of young Truswell. Mr. Jonves", (he electrical inspector, attributed the fatalits'-apart from decensed's wan- ton folly in climbing the post-to bad insulation. The thin copper wire which held the electric main to the in- sulator had cut through the gutta- percha and tapped the current, with consequences most deadly to anyone who by chance should las' hands upon it. It may be assumed that there are many defects of a similar character in our electric mains running up and down our streets and across our house- tops, carrying death in one of ¡ts most sudden and terrible forms. Last year Parliament pnsed an act for the con- trol of the electric systems, and as one I of the regulations bears most directly upon the nature and extent of the iu , sidatiug material and the class of fas- tenings to be used, it may be asked whs steps have not been taken earlier to have the act. enforced, particularly in those matters where human life Is In- volved. Mr. Jenvcy told the coroner that, as there were only himself and one assistant, tiley liad not been able up to tho present to go into this matter of insulating, but in cross-examination the witness was compelled to admit that ho did not know if there was ans' wire available in the COIODS- which could be said to comply with the con- ditions of the act. Meanwhile tlie public must continue to take the risks when electric malus are blown down or come into contact with telephone wires at a poiut where the Insulation is not in accordance with the regula- tions.
