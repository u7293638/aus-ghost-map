A True Ghost Storyu Half a eentmry ago, .on Christmas ?eve, a lady threw herself from .the window of her house, situated on the outskirts of a town in the south of England. The event occurred on a Christmas Eve. Her death jed to law proceedings regarding the ownership of the house -in which she had resided. The house was thrown into Chancery, and in a few years got the reputation of being haunted. It was said that late .on every Christmas Eye a window was throwu open, a white figure appeared, a low moan was heard, and a figure was seen to throw itself on the lawn beneath, where.it fell with a ' dull thud.' This scene was supposed io be a repetition of that which had. occurred when the lady of the house had chosen that method of leaving it some years before. Christmas Eve, - eight years ago, a gentleman who did no believe in ghosts was passing tiat place. All the windows were broken, it was destitute of 'paint, and the grounds around it 'were a field of long rank grass. Just as the gentleman got in front of the house he heard something like a moan-; the clock struck 11, an upper window was thrown open, something, white appeared, fell headlong from the window, and struck the ground with a ' dull thud.' For a moment the spectator was nonplussed. ' 1 must have made a mistake, the clock struck 12, and that was the ghost,' he thought. His common sense soon, however, got the better of this idea, and he advanced to the gate to ex amine =the premises. The gate was unlocked, and this helped to reassure him. lie walked on to the lawu, and there found two oM women preparing to carry away a bnudle oi soiled linen. That was the ghoofc. The Chancery suit had been settled, and the con tents of the house were to be sold. The bed linen was being conveyed away by the eld women to be washed.; and to save earrying it downstairs they had thrown it out ef the window. ? i
