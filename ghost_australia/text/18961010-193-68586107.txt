ATTACHMENT :-Mr Jones, solicitor, made an unusual application to the Williamstown bench yesterday. On the sworn evidence of Mr Matthews, shipwright, he asked for an order against Captain George Brown, of the barque Oimara. From the applicant's state ment it appeared that Captain Brown had been served with a summons for Â£4 13s., returnable next Tuesday, but his vessel would leave before that date thereby enabling him, if he so denied, to evade payment. As the defendant had not been notified of the present proceedings the further hearing was adjourned till this morning.
