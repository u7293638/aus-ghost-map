THE BATTLE OF DORKING. reminiscences of a volunteer. A The interest excited by the article published under the above heading in the May number of Blackwood's Magazine has induced us to select from it the more salient passages. The article is generally attributed to the pen of Colonel Hamley, whose " Operations of War Explained and Illustrated," which he gave to the world about five years ago, proved his thorough so _ quaintance with the theory and practice of the art of warfare, and it is this special knowledge which lends so much to resemblance to the fictitious narrative here subjoined, since it has enabled him to describe with complete accuracy not only what might, but what, under certain conditions, inevitably would happen, supposing the preliminary circumstances to have come to pass in the manner indicated. the narrator of the story Sits down A d. 1925, to relate to his grandchildren the events which culminated in the Battle of Dorking, and the particulars of that decisive engagement, which occurred fifty years previously After briefly sketching the wealthy and prosperous condition of Great Britain just before the German invasion, he proceeds to define the cause of the defenceless condition of the mother country. HOW THE CRASH CAME ABOUT First, the rising in India drew away a part of our small army , then came the difficulty with America, which had been threatening for years, and we sent off 10,000 men to defend Canada a handful which did not go far to strengthen the real defences of that country, but formed an *f irresistible temptation to the Americans to try and take them prisoners, especially as the contingent included three battalions of the Guards Thus the regular army at home was even smaller than usual, and nearly half of it was in Ireland, to cheek the talked of Fenian invasion fitting out in the west WoisoBtill-though I do not know it would really have mattered as things turned out the meet was scattered abroad, some ships to guard the West Indies, others to check privateering in the China seas, and a large part to try and protect our colonies on the Northern Pacific shore of America, where, with incredible folly, we continued to retain possessions which we could not possibly defend America was not the great power forty years ago that it is now, but for us to try and hold territory on her shores which could only be reached by sailing round the Horn, was as absurd as if she had attempted to take the Isle of Man before the independence of Ireland We see this plainly enough now, but we were all blind then It was while we were in this state, with our ships all over the world, and our little bit of an army cut up into detachments, that the Secret Treaty was published, and Holland and Denmark were annexed People say now that we might have escaped the troubles which came upon us if we had at any rate kept quiet till our other difficulties were settled, but the British were always an impulsive lot, the whole country was boiling over with indignation, and the Government, egged on by the press, and going with the stream, declared war We had always got out of scrapes before, and we believed our old luck and pluck would somehow pull us through Then, of course, there was bustle and hurry all over the land. Not that the calling up of the army reserves caused much stir, for I think there were only about 5000 altogether, and a good many of these were not to be found when the time came, but recruiting was going on all over the country, with a tremendous high bounty, 50,000 more men having been voted for the army. Then there was a Ballot Bill passed for adding 5500 men to the nuntin, why a round number was not fixed on I don't know, but the Prime Minister said that this was the exact quota wanted to put the defences of the country on a sound footing in the ship building that begun ' Iron dads, despatch boats, gunboats, monitors, overy building yard in the country got its job, and they were offering 10s a day wages for anybody who could drive a rivet This didn't improve the recruit song, you may suppose I remember, too, there was a squabble in the House of Commons about whether artisans should be drawn for the ballot, as they were much wanted, and I think they got an exemption This sent numbers to thousands, and if we had had a couple of cars to prepare instead of a couple of weeks, I daresay we should have done very well It was on a Monday that the decline atio i of war was announced, and in a ion bellis no got our first inkling of the sort of preparation the enemy had made for the event which they had really brought about, although the actual declaration was made by us A pious appeal to the God of battles, whom it is said no had aroused, was telegraphed back, and from that moment all communication with the north of Europe was cut off Our embassies and legations were packed off at an hour's notice, and it was as if we had suddenly come back to the middle ages The dumb astonishment visible all over London the next morning, when the papers came out void of news, merely hinting at what had happened, was one of the most startling things in this war of surprises But everything had been arranged beforehand , nor ought he to have been surprised, for we had seen the same power, only a few months before, move down half a million of men on a few days notice, to conquer the greatest military nation in Europe, with no more fuss than our War Office used to make over the transport of a brigade from Aldershot to Hughton, and this, too, without the allies it had now What happened now was not a bit more wonderful in reality ; but people of this country could not bring themselves to believe that what had never occurred before to England could ever possibly happen Like our neighbors, he became so when it was too late Meanwhile the best part of the tract had been decoyed down to the Dirimidles, ant what remained of the Ch muel squadron was looking after Fenian filibusters oil the heat of Irclmcl Consequently what remained was innings it to cope with the enemy, and this it came to pass that we sustained A O HE IT Mr VT DEFEAT I had just come up to town by train as usual, and was walking to my call I, when the news boys began to cry, ' New edition-the men's Root in sight' i mi in it imagine the scene in London Business still went on at the banks, for bills matured although the independence of the country was being fought out under her own eyes, so to say and th speculators were active enough But even with the pi ope- who were making and losing their fortunes, the interest in the H et oven unie everything else , men who went to pay in or drun out their money flopped to show the 1 its bulletin to the cashier As for the strut you could hardly got along for the friend stopping to buy and read the pipers, still at every lion i orch e the members sit nths lv, 11 the common room, as if to keep dogs the 1 for comp my sending out some of their number every few minutes to get the latest elm n What this is what happened at our off but to sit still was us impossible us to do any thing, and most of us went out and was there I about among the crowI under a sort of 'thing that the news was quickly got it in this n n B id as the times nee coming I think the bickering g suspense of that day, and the shock which fol- lowed, was almost the worst that he underwent It was about 10 o'clock that the fun telegram came, an hour later the wife announced that the admiral had signalled to form line of battle, and shortly after that of of or a was given to bear down on the enemy's 1 eng it At li came the aiiiiouncuiuiit, ' fleet opened fire about three of miles followed 1 of us that in, the ship with the cable so far all had been expectancy , then came the first skin of < dainty "An iiJiulil his head blown up "-" the enemy's torpedoes are doing great d cargo " " the flagship is laid ahead I do enemy ' - ' the flagship appears to be sinking - (ho vice admiral has signally whether the able but are silent, and, as you know, no limit no more till two days afterward The solitary ironclad which escaped the disaster steamed into Portsmouth. 1 hull the hole story came out-how our sailors, gallant us ever, had tried to close with the enemy how the latter had evaded the conflict at close quarters, and, cheering off, left behind them the fatal engines which sent our ships one after the other, to the bottom , how all this happened almost in a few minutes The Government, it appears, had received warning of this invention , but to the nation this stuff ning blow was utterly unexpected. ASPECT OF THE CHI I run off as hard as I could for Westminster bridge, and so to the Waterloo aration The place had quite changed its aspect since the morning. The regular service of trains had ceased, and the station and approaches were full of troops, among them the guards and artillery. Everything was very orderly , the men had piled arms and were standing about in groups There was no sign of high spirits or enthusiasm Matters had been of too serious Every man's face reflected the general feeling that we had neglected the warnings given us, and that now the danger so long derided as ina possible and absurd had really come and found us unprepared But the soldiers, if grate, looked determined, like men who meant to do their duty whatever might happen A train full of guardsmen was just starting for Guildford I was told it would stop at Surbiton, and with several other volunteers, hurrying like myself to join our regiment, got a place in it w o did not arrive a moment too soon, for the regiment was marching from Kingston down to the station. The destination of our brigade was the east coast Empty carriages were drawn up in the siding and our regiment was to go first A large crowd was assembled to see it oil, including the recruits who had joined during the last fortnight, and who formed by far the largest part of our strength they were to stay behind, and were certainly very much in the way already , for us all the officers and sergeants belonged to the acute part, there was no one to keep discipline among them, and they came crowding round us, breaking the ranks and making it difficult to get into the train Here I saw our new brigadier for the first time He was a soldier like man, and no doubt know his duty, but he appeared not to volunteers, and did not seem to know how to deal with gentlemen privates I wanted very much to um home and get my greatcoat and knapsack, which I had bought a few days ago, but seem ed to be left behind , a good natured recruit volunteered to fetch them for me, but he had not returned before we started, and I began the campaign with a kit consisting of a mackintosh and a small pouch of tobacco It was a tremendous squeeze, in the train, for besides the ten men sitting down, therefore three or four standing up in every compartment, and the afternoon was close and sultry, and there were so many stoppages on thowaythutwo took nearly an hour and a half crawling up to Waterloo. It was between 5 and 6 in the after noon when we arrived there, and it was nearly 7 before he marched up to the Shoreditch station. The whole place was filled up with stores and ammunition, to be sent off to the East, so we piled arms in the street and scattered about to get food and drink, of which most of us stood in need, especially) the latter, for some Here is ready feeling the worse for the heat and crush I was just stepping into a public house with Travers, when who should (Into up but his pretty wife ' Most of our friends had paid their adieux at the Surbiton station, but she had driven up by the road in his brougham, bringing their little boy to have a last look at papa She had also brought his knapsack and great coat, and, what was still more acceptable, a basket continuing fowls, tongue, bread and butter, and biscuits, and a couple of bottles of claret, which priceless luxuries they insisted on into Binning Meanwhile the hours went on The 4th Surrey Militia, which had marched all the way from Kingston, had come up, as well as the other volunteer corps, the station had been partly cleared of the stores that encumbered it, some artillery, two militia regiments, and a battalion i of the line, had been dispatched, and our turn to stint had come, and long lines of carriages were drawn up ready for us, but still we remained in the street you may fancy the scene 1 here seemed to be as many people as over in the place, and we could hardly move for the . crowds of spectators fellows hawking fruits W and volunteers' comforts, newsboys and so forth to say nothing of the cabs and omnibuses, while orderlies and stall officers were constantly riding up with messages A good many of the militia men, and some of our people, too, had taken more than enough to drink, perhaps a hot sun had told on empty stomachs, say how they be came very noisy, The din, dirt and heat, were indescribable So the evening wore on, and all the information our offices could not from the brigadier, who appeared to be acting under an other general, was, that orders had come to stand fast for the present By this time, and while the volunteers were on route for Dorking, news reached them that the enemy had landed in force at Worthing All was confusion and disorder, and in two days the invaders had got more than 20 miles inland, and nothing effectual had been done to stop them VOLUNTEER CAMPAIGNING We had scarcely reached the hill above the town, which we were told was to be our bivouac for the night, when the welcome news came that a food train had arrived at the station, but there were no carts to bring the things up soufutiguo party went down and carried bieknsupph to us in their arms leaves, a barrel of rum, packets of tea, and joints of meat- abundance for all but there was not a kettle or a cooking pot in the regiment, and he could not cut the meat ian The colonel and officers were no better off they had arranged to have a regular mess, Uli crockery, steward, and all complete, but the es t ablishment never turned up, and what had he come of it no one knew Some of in were sent back into the town to see that no could not in the way of cooking Utensils We found the street full of artillery, baggage waggons, and mounted officers, and volunteers shops ing like ourselves, and all the houses appeared to be occupied by troops We succeeded in getting a few kettles and caus pans, and! obtained for myself a leather bag with a strip to go over the shoulder, what proved very Lum ley

that tbcoppo into hills on the South were dotted with fire", and no thought at first they must belong to the court, but to were told that the ground up there I is still held by a strong rear guard of acid era, and that there need be no few of a surprise Till SCENE OF OU RATIONS At the first sign of down, the burden of the regiments sounded the reveille, and we were or dived to lull in, and the roll was called About 20 men were absent she had fallen out sick the day before , they had been sent up to London by train during the night, I behave After standing in column for about half an hour, the brigade major came down with orders to pile arms and stand easy, and perhaps half an hour afterwards we were told to get breakfast as quickly as possible, and cook a day's food at the same time This operation was managed pretty much in the same way as the evening before, except that we had our cooking pots and kettles ready Meantime there was leisure to look around, and from where we stood there was a commanding view of one of the most beautiful scenes in England Our regiment was drawn upon the extremity of the ridge which runs from Guildford to Dorking line is indeed merely a part of the great chalk range with li extends from beyond Aldershot east to the Medway, but there is a gap in the ridge just above where the little stream that runs past Dorking turns suddenly to the north, to find its way to the flames We stood on the slope of the hill, as it trends down eastward towards this gap, and had passed our bivouac in what had appeared to be a gentleman's park A little way above us, and to our right, was a very fine country seat to which the park was attached, now occupied by the head quarters of our division From this house the hill sloped steeply down southward to the valley below, which runs nearly east and west parallel to the ridge, and carries the railway and the road from Guildford to Reigate, and in which alley, immediately) in front of the chateau, and perhaps a mile and a half distant from it, was the little town of Dorking, nestled in the trees, and rising up the foot of the slopes on the other side of the valley which stretched east ward nearly to our propel front, culminating in a small railway station from which the glassy slopes of the park rose up dotted with shrubs and trees to where we were standing Round this railway station was a cluster of villas and one or two mills, of whose gardens are thus had a bird's eye view, their little ornamental ponds glistening like looking glasses in the morning sun Iuinicdiatdj on our lift the park slope 1 steeply down to the gap before mentioned, through which ran the little stream, as well as the railway from Epsom to Brighton, nearly due north and south meeting the Guildford and Rcigato line at right angles Close to the point of intersection and the little station already mentioned, was the tation of the former place where no had stopped the day before Beyond the gap on the east (our left) and in continua- tion of our ridge rose the chalk hill again The shoulder of this ridge overlooking the gap is call 3d Box Hill, from the shrubbery of box wood with which it was covered Its sides were very steep, and the top of the ridge was covered with troops The natural strength of our position was manifested at a glance , a high grassy ii Igo steep to the south, with a shearn in front, and but little cover up the sides It seemed made for a bottle held The weak point was the gap , the ground at the junction of the railways and the roads immediately at the entrance of the gun formed a little valley, dotted, as I have said, with buildings and gardens tins, in one sense, was the key of the position for although it would not be tenable while we held the ridge commanding it, the enemy by carrying this point and advancing through the gap would cut our line in two But you must not suppose I scanned the ground thus on stalls at the time Anjbodv indeed might have been struck with the natural advantages of our position, but what, as I remember, most impressed me was, the peaceful beauty of the scene the little town with the outline of the houses ob scared by a blue mist, the missive crispness of the foliage, the outlines of the great trees, lighted up by the sun, and relieved by deep blue shade So thick was the timber hore, rising up the southern slopes of the valley, that it looked almost as if it might have been a primeval forest The quit of the scene was more impressive because contrasted in the mind with the stones no expected to follow and I can remember, us if it were yesterday, the sensation of bitter regret that it should now be too late to avon this coming desecration of our country, which might so easily have been prevented A little firmness, a little provision on the part of our rulers, even a little common sense, and this great calamity would have been rendered utterly impossible Too late, alas' We were like the foolish virgins in the parable THE BATTLE OF BOILING A tremendous thunderstorm, which had been gathering all day, burst on us, and a torrent of almost blinding i um c fine down, which obscured the view even more than the smoke, while the crashing of the thunder and the glare of the lightning could be heard and seen even above the roar and flashing of the artillery Once the mist lifted, and I saw for a minute an attack on Box Hill, on the other side of the gap on our lift It was like the scene at a theatre cur tam of smoke all round and a clear gap in the centre, with a sudden gleam of evening sunshine lighting it up lhoBtcop smooth slope of the hill was crowded with the dark blue figures of the enemy, whom I now saw for the first time an irregular outline in front, but very solid in rear, the whole body was moving forward by fits and starts, the mili- firing and advancing, the officers waving their swords the columns closing up and gradually making way Our people were almost conceded by the bushes at the top, we hence the smoke and their Ino could be seen proceeding presently from the bushes on the crest came out a led Inn, and (rushed down the brow of the hill, a Name of bro belching out from the front as it advanced Ihotncmj best I ited, (gave way, and finally ran back in a ton fused crowd down the hill Ulto the mist covered the scene, but the glimpse of this splendid chance was inspiriting, and I hoped we should show the same coolness when it came to our turn. It was about this time that our skir mitta rs fell back, a good many wounded, some limping along by themselves, others helped the main body retired in very fair order, halt ing to turn round and fire, we could see a mounted officer of the Guards riding up and down cntoutuL,ing them to be steady Now came our turn 1 or a few minutes he sun no thing, but a rattle of bullets came through the rain and it is, mostly, however,pussiug over the bank We began to fire in reply, stepping up against the bank to fire, and stooping down to you!, but our brigade major rode up with an order, and the word was passed through the men to reserve our fire in a very few moments it must have been that when ordered to stand, we soul I see the helmet spikes and then the figures of the skirmishers us tity am on a lot of them there appeared to be, Two or six deep I should say but in loose order, each man stopping to aim and fire, and thin coming of ground a little Just then the Brigadier fluttered on horseback up the 11 o " Now, then, gentlemen, {,1V u it them but 'he tried and bro away we did, as fast as ever no sure able A perfect j storm of bulli, to sea said to be lying about us too, and I thought much moment must be the list, escape seemed impossible, but I saw no one fall, for I was too busy, and so while we all to look to the right or left, but loaded and fired as fast as I could How long this went on I know but it could not have been long , nor that she could have lasted many minuted under such a line, but it ended by the enemy gi usually far line; back, and as soon as no sale this ner used a tremendous shout, and some of us a hoped upon the bank to give them our parting shots Suddenly the order was passed down the line to cease hung and no Boon discovered the cause, n b station of the Guards was charging obliquely across dom our left across our front It was I expect, them flank attack us much us our Ino ninth had turned back the room , and it has a splendid I sight to see then steady line as they advanced slowly across the smooth lawn below us, firing us they went, but as steady as if on parade w o leltiifcuat station at this moment, it seemed as if the battle was not Just then some body called out to look to the a founded, and for the last time I turned to glance down the rink along the lane Han I saw we had not beaten back the attack without loss Iinmo shady before me by 1 an ford of mt office, dead on his back from a ball through his forehead, his hand Mill grasping his life At every ship was some friend or acquaintance killed or wounded and a few pass down the same I found Travels, sitting with his back against the bank A bill had gone through his lungs, and blood was coming from his mouth Looking over the bank, I noticed for the first time the frightful execution our fire had treated the space in front was thickly strewed with dead and billy wounded, and beyond the bodies of the fallen enemy could just be Boon-for it was now getting dusk the bearskins and red coats of our own gallant Guards scattered over the slope, and marking the line of their victorious advance But hardly a minute could have passed in thus looking over the field, When our brigade major carne moving up the lane on foot (I suppose his horse had been shot), crying, " Stand to your arms, volunteers' they're coming on again," and we found ourselves a second time engaged in a hot musketry bro How long it went on I cannot now remember, but we could distinguish clearly the thick line of skirmishers, about 60 paces off, and mounted officers among them and we seemed to be keeping them well in check, for they were quite exposed to our bro, while we were protected nearly up to our shoulders, when I know not how became sensible that some thing had gone wrong " We are taken in flank !" called out some of to and looking along the left, sure enough, there were dark figures jumping over the bank into the lane and fines up along our line The volunteers in reserve, who had come down to take the place of the Guards, must have given way at this point, the enemy's skirmishers had got through our line, and turned our left 11 ink How the next move came about I cannot recollect, or whether it was without orders, but in a short time we found ourselves out of the lane, and drawn up in a straggling line about 30 yards in rear of it-at our end, that is the other Bank had fallen back a good deal more and the enemy were lining the hedge, and numbers of them passing over and forming upon our side. Beyond our left a confused mass were retreating, firing as they cut, followed by the advancing line of the enemy We stood in this way for a short space, firing at random as fast as we could Our colo not and major must have been shot, for there was noone to give an order, when somebody on horseback pulled out from behind I think it must have been the brigadier "Now, than, Volun tears give a British cheer, and go at them charge and with a shout, two rushed at the enemy Some of them run, some stopped to meet us, and for a moment it was a real hand to hand light I felt a sharp sting in my leg, as I drowsily bayonet light through the man in front of me I confess I shut my eyes, for I just got a glimpse of the poor wretch as he fell back, his eyes starting out of his head, and savage though we were, the sight was almost too horrible to look at But the struggle was over in a second, and we had cleared the ground again right up to the rear hedge of the lane Had no gone on, I believe we might have recovered the lane too, but we were now all out of order, There was no one to say what to do , the enemy began to line the hedge and open fire, and they were st roaming past our lost, and how it came about I know not, but no found ourselves falling back towards our right rear scarce any semblance of a line remaining, and the volunteers who had given way on our left mixed up with us, and adding to the confusion It was now nearly dark. On the slopes which we were retreating to was a large mass of resort or drawn upon columns Some of the leading files of alice, mistaking us for the enemy, began firing ill as , out fellows, crying out to them to stop, ran to wards their ranks, and in a few moments the whole slope of the hall became a scene of confusion that I cannot attempt to describe, regiments and detachments mixed up in hopeless disorder Most of us, I believe, turned towards the enemy and fired an day our few remaining cartridges , but it was too late to take min, for tunately) for us, or the guns which the enemy had brought up through the gap, and word As ing point blank, would have done more damage As it that, we could see little more than the bright flashes of their fire in our confusion we had jammed up a line regiment immediately behind us, and its colonel and house staff officers were in vain trying to make a passage out, and) their shouts to us to march to the rear and clear a road could he heard above the roar of the guns and the confused bah 1 of sound At last a mounted officer pushed his way through, followed by a company in sections, the men blushing past with firm Best tins, as if on a desperate tusk and the battalion, when it got clear, up prepared to deploy and ultimate down the slope I have also a dim recollection of seeing the Life Guards trot past the front, and push on towards the town-a last desperate attempt to save the da>-boforo we left the hold Out adjutant, who had got separated from our flank of the regiment in the confusion, now came up, and managed to lead us, or at any rate some of us, up to the crest of the hill in the roar, tore form, as he said , but there we met a fast crowd of volunteers, militia, and waggons, all 1 anning returned from the direction of the big house, and we were born in the stream for a mile at least be fore it was possible to stop At Inst the adjutant led us to an open space a little off the line of fugitives, and there were formed the remains of the coin] unions Telling us to hunt, he rode off to try and obtain orders, and find out where the rest of our brigade was From this point, a spur of high ground running oil from the mum plateau, we looked down through the dim twilight into the battle hold below. Artillery fire was still going on We could see the flashes from the guns on both sides, and now and then a stray shell came screaming up and burst near us, but we were beyond the sound of musketry This halt first gave us time to think about what it had happened.

The roll was here taken, and only ISO ans tied out of nearly 500 present on the morning of the battle How many of these were killed and wounded no one could tell, but it was contain many must have got separated in the confusion of the evening While resting here, we saw pass by, in the crowd of vehicles and men, a cart laden with commis sanat stores, driven by a man in uniform Food cried some one, and a dozen volunteers jumped up and surrounded the cart The driver tried to whip them off, but he was pulled off his coat, and the contents of the cart thrown out man instant They have preserved meat in tins, which we tore open with our boys riots The meat had been cooked before, I think, at any rate we devoured it Shortly after this a general cargo by with three or four stall officers He stopped and spoke to our adjutant, and then rode into the field "My lads," said he, "you shall your my division for the present fall in, and follow the regiment that is now passing " We rose up, soil in by companies, catch about twenty strong, and turned once more into the stream! moving along the road, regiments, detachments, single volun tears or militiamen, country people making oil, some with bundles, some without, a few in carts, but most on foot, here and there waggons of stores, with mon sitting wherever there was room, others crammed with wounded soldiers Many blocks occurred from hurst. falling, or tarts breaking down and filling up the road in the town the confusion was even worse, for all the houses scored full of volunteers and tmhtiauion, wounded or resting, or trying to obtain food, and the streets were almost choked up Some officers were in vain trying to restore order, but the task seemed a hopeless one One or two volunteer regiments which had arrived from the north the previous night, and had been halted here for orders, were drawn up along the roadside steadily enough, and some of the red eating regiments, including cuts, may have preserved the som branch of discipline, but for the most part the mass pushing to the rear was a more mob The regulars, or what remained of them, wore non, I believe, all in the rear, to hold the advancing army in check A few officers among such a crowd could do nothing To add to the ton fusion, several houses were being emptied of the wounded brought her of the night before, to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy, Soho imparts, some being carried to the railway by men The groans of these poor fellows as they were jostled through the street went to our mind Is, Bullish though fatigue and suffering had minions At last, following the guidance of a staff officer who was standing to show the way, we turned off from the main London road, and took that towards Kingston Here the crush was loss, and we managed to move along pretty steadily The air had been cooled by the storm, and there was no dust We passed through a village where our now general had seized all the public houses, and taken possession of the liquor , find each regiment as it came up was halted, and each man gets drink of beer, soft red out by companies. Whether the owners got paid, I know not, but it was like nectar It must have been about 1 o'clock in the afternoon that we came in sight of Kingston We had been on our legs six long hours, and had got over about twelve miles of ground There is a hill a little south of the Surbiton station, covered then mostly with villas, but open at the western extremity, where there was a clump of trees on the summit We had diverged from the road towards this, and here the general halted us and disposed the line of the division along his front, and to the south was, the right of the line sitting down to the Thames, the left extend ing along the southern slope of the hill, in the direction of the Epsom road by which we had come We were nearly indecently, occupy ing the knoll just in front of the general, who dis- mounted on the top, and (told his horse to a tree. It is not much of a lull, but commands an extensive view over the flat country around ; and us we lay wearily on the ground we could see the Thames glistening like a silver field in the bright sunshine, the palace at Hampton Court, the bridge at Kingston, and the old (church tower rising above the haze of the town, with the woods of Richmond park behind it To most of us the scene could not but call up the associations of happy days of yesterdays now ended and pi ice destroyed through national infatuation We did not say this to each other, but a deep depression had come upon us, partly due to weakness and fatigue, no doubt, but we saw that another stand was going to be Hindi, and we had no longer any court (fence in ourselves II no could not hold our own when stationary in line, on a good position, but had been broken up into a rabble at the first shook, what chance had we now of manoeuvring against a victorious enemy in this open ground ? A fu ling of desperation came over us, in deteriorate i to utrugdo on against hope , but anxiety for the future of the country, and our friends, and all dear to us, filled our thoughts now that we had time for reflection We had had no news of any kind anita Wo id joined us the day before know not what was doing in London, or what the Government was about, or anything else, and exhausted though we were, two fill an intense longing to know what was happening in other parts of the country Our general had expected to find a supply of food and ammunition line, but nothing turned up Most of us had hardly a cartridge left, solid ordered the regiment next to us, ninth came from the north and had not been engaged, to give us enough to make up twenty rounds a man, and he sent one of fatigue party to lung sion to try and get prove a man, while a det ich meet of our follows nus allowed to go for having among the villas in our rich and in about on hour and brought b k some bread I and meat, which gave us a slender meat all round They said most of the houses were i reply and that many had been stripped of all classes, and li good deal damaged already It must have been between T and 4 o'clock when the Bursill of (arduous ling h g in to be heart! in the front, a 11 we could see the smoke of the guns using above the woods of 1 slur and Co cement, and so he afterwards some troops emerged from the) fields below in It was the rourjjUirloi regular trips there are bones gillis also which will turn up the slope and took up their plants in ron and the knock There wire the tu batteries, but they only ( vomited eight guns unionist third Dolman I train was i i ted the line , it has a large, i le Opp mostly i I tour return nts but the whole did not look to be more than eight or nine hands I men Our Regiment and another had been much d a bills to the rear t in the pay for them, as I priH ally we were often! down at > occupy the railway station on my right it is My leg was now j still I could m longer inn i Willi III That, m I ii y left rain was very s volley an 1 one, in I id n i t ubi I as, bad anything seemed belli I t him I am left behind so that I offer the bill thou in best 1 tons down to the station here in a g to Is shed a lit it is in a line if it (I with line astonish It bin) ling, in I Inn inv ion party was past I 1 ties i at of one man but I the end! of the tin! ore A still is ci i is with us to increase the di tributing on the II It supports I In li to troops, li and iii I am a time in Uses a trim fill of the n (me shyly up Iron On I If or I was in a in the list, of an in, it out the train passed on and a party b ,' in to t ii up the rails while the rest my district I ii along the h ms son couch she An i, n s p early a upon us in our he I, and an engineer on a wild slippers came to I nick hull J in the wills far as to Bro from but there were only half ad in of tin in, to progress was not very rapid, and as no had no cool we could not help It win while we who Walling time job But the a lot mt who was as active as our looked in and it all in to music in the yard the fatigue party had come back for my Kingston, and a small bar in a bandent ot f 10d was made over to us us out here It contained loaves, flour and some parts of meat the meat or Hour we had not timber means to took the loaves wo devoured, and there was a tap of water in the yard, so we felt refreshed by the mood I should have liked to wash my wounds which were becoming very offensive, but I dared not take off my coat, feeling sure I should not be able to got it on again. It was while we were eating our broad that the rumor first reached us of another disaster, even greater than that we had ttitnossodoursoltes whence it came I know not, but a whisper went down the ranks that Woolwich had been captured We all knew that it was our only arsenal, and understood the significance of the blow No hope, if this were true, of saving the country Thinking over this, » of went back to the short Although this was only our second day of war, I think we were already old soldiers so far that so had come to be careless about Ure, and the shot and shell that now began to open on us made no sensation We felt, indeed, our need of discipline, and we saw plainly enough the slender chance of success coming out of such a rabble us no more, but I think we were all determined to light on as long as we could Our gallant adjutant gave his spirit to every body and the stall officer commanding was a very cheery folios, and went about as if we were certain of victory Just as the firing be gan he looked in to say that we were as safe us in a church, that we must be sure and pepper the enemy well, and that more cartridges would soon arrive There were some steps and benches in the shed, and on those a part of our men were standing, to fire through the upper loop holes, while the line soldiers and others stood on the ground, guarding the second son I sat on the door, for could not now use my name, and besides, there were more men than loop holes The artillery fire which had opened note on our position was from a longish range, and occupation for the abdomen had hardly begun when there was a crash in the shed, and I was knocked down by a blow on the head I was almost stunned for a time, and could not make out what had happened A shot or shell had hit the shed without penetrating the wall, but the blow had upset the stops resting against it, and the men standing on them, bringing down a cloud of plaster and brickbats, one of which had struck me I felt now past being of use I could not use my i ill t, and could barely stand and after a time I thought I would make for my own house, on the chance of finding some one Bills there I got up, therefore, and staggered homewards Musketry fire had now commenced, and outside her blazing away from the windows of the houses, and from behind walls, and from the shelter of some trucks still standing in the

row of villas their loading from the station to Kingston Had no been brought home, I wondered, as his faithful old servant promised, and was his safe home if I remember to this day the sensation of

Wood had been taken in way to work at repairing the railroad, and Lucy had run off from fright ; but the cook had stopped at her post, and had served up supper and opened the collar for the soldiers' as she did not understand what they I said, and they were rough and boorish, but not uncivil I should now go, she said, when my wounds were dressed, to look after my own home, where I might he wanted, for herself, she wished only to be allowed to remain watch nig there pointing to the room where lay the bodies of her husband and child whore she would not be molested I felt that her advice was good I could be of no use as protection, and I had an humous longing to know what has become of my neck met and sister; Besides, some arrangements must be made for the burial. I therefore limped away there was no need to express thanks on either side, and the grief was too deep to be reached by any outward show of sympathy. Outside the house there was a good deal of movement and bustle , many carts going along, the waggoners, from Sussex and Surrey, evidently implies ed and guarded! by soldiers and although no gas was but mug, the road towards Kingston was well lighted with torches held by persons at siding at short nilen als in line, who had been seized for the duty, some of them the tenants of neighboring villas Almost the first of these torch carpets I came to was an old gentleman whose face I was well acquainted with, from having frequently travelled up and down in the same train with him. He was a senior clerk in a Government office, I believe, and was a mild looking old man with a pretty face and a long neck, which he used to wrap in a wide double neckcloth, a thing even in those days seldom soon even in that moment of bitterness I could not help being amused by the absurd figure this poor old follow presented, with his solemn face and long i ra vat, doing a portico with a torch in front of his own door, to light up the path of our unique rors Ruta ' more seriOUS object now presented itself, a corporal's guard passing by, with two English volunteers in charge, their hands tied behind their backs They cast an imploring glance at me, and I stepped into the road to ask the corporal what was the matter, and even ventured, us he was passing on to I in my hand on his sleeve "Auf dear Wego, Spitzbubo " tiled the brute, lifting his wife, as if to knock me down "Must one prisoners who fire at us let shoot," he went on to tied and shot the poor fellows would have been, I suppose, if I had not interceded with an officer who happened to be riding by " Herr Hauptmann," I cried, as loud as I could, is this j out discipline, to let unarmed prisoners be shot without orders?" The officer, thus appealed to, routed in his home, and halted the guard till he heard what I had to say. My knowledge of other languages hero stood me in good stead, for the prisoners, north country factory hands apparently, were of course utterly unable to make themselves understood, and did not even know in what they had offended I therefore may pieced their explanation , they had been left behind while skirmishing near Ditton, in a barn, and coming out of their hiding pi i i In the midst of a party of the enemy, with their rifles in their hands, the latter thought they were going to fire at them from behind It was a wonder they were not shot down on the spot The captain heard the tide, and then told the guard to let them go, and tiny sink all at once into a by-road. He is was a huge soldier like man but nothing could exceed the inso uncle of his manner, which was perhaps all the greater himself seemed not intentional, but to arise from a sense of im- measurable superiority) Between the lame fthiwilIn/el pleading for his comrades, and the captain of the conquering army, there was, in his view, an minnie gun and the two men both dogs, their fate could not have been do tried more (contemptuously They were let go simply because they were not worth keeping as prisoners, and perhaps to kill any living thing without hush went against the Hauptmann's sense of pi time But why speak of this insult in particular i" Has not be ry man who lived there his tale to tell of humiliation and degradation i" For it was the same story everywhere. After the last stand in line, and when once they had got us in the mind, the utility laughed at us Our handful of rigid in troops was soon had almost to a man in a vain conflict with numbers, our volunteers and militia, with officers who did not know then work, without a ammunition or equipment, or stall to superintend, stalling in the midst of plenty, who had soon become a Itclplo s mob lighting despond ely Jura and 'li ii, but with whom, us a almsgiving around, him do opened invaders did just what they pleased Hippy those whose bones whitened the holds of Surrey j they at least are spared the disgrace no lived to and are Titi literal a sense .
