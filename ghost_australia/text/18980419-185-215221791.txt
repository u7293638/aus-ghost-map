MELBOURNE NEWS. Monday. MILDURA. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) The Government have not yet done with the evergreen Mildura question. Like a ghost of past sin, it rises up against them in a most unwarrantable way, as they have not been guilty of anything but generosity to the temperance (?) city. However, the Premier will next Wednesday be again called upon to face a deputation from Mildnra to listen to a request for the balance of loan nnder the bill specially passed by Parliament to meet their eternal tronbles. He will also be aeked to authorise tbe granting of certain titles to land at Renmark.
