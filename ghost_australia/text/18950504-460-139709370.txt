MR. HAWEIS'S LECTURES. The Rev. H. EL Jflaweia, who has been lecturing at the Athenaeum-hall during the week, ia one of the most vetaatile of men. On Sunday he preached at Christ Church, South Yarra, on Monday he lectured on "Music and Morals"-with violin accom paniments ; on Tuesday hia subject was "Tennyson, the Poet of the Age," and on Wednesday he doffed the ordinary evening dress of the lecturer, and appeared in full clerical costume to discourse on "Christ in Art, or the Church in the Catacombs." As & lecturer Mr. H&weis; possesses a style ab solutely unique-almost, indeed, eccentric and which on a first impression might at times appear grotesque. But he has the happy faculty of growing upon his audience, ana as 80011 as the peculiarities of his manner be come familiar the applause is always cordial. He is a talker and a rapid one, not an elocu tionist, and his address is full of ragged ends and sentences, which are completed by gesture instead oi words. The last two lec tures of hia Melbourne season are "Music and Noise" and "Modern Ghosts and Spiritualism."
