BATS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ADVERaTIERt. Sir,-Several times I have observed at duska recently, when tlhe sun has just net, a colony or large family of bats issuing from a tree. An the greyoa the evoeningdeopne these hats may he seen every evening iseu iag from what appears to bo a solid limb, bt which must he a very hollow one. First one little bat, looking for all the world (at a distanco and in tie gloamlng) like a flit ting butterfly. In a minute oat comes one or two more; thenlall is quiet again, when all at once there is n regular flatter, as you might term it, of a dozen or more. popping out, one at a time, but so qulickly that you must bo smart to count thoem; another lull, and then they appear in cores. eanch one viring with tihe other as "o which will he the quickest in gotling out first to its nightly haunts, are if each thought its fellow bat were flying to cut him out, or as if each one was more hungry then its fellow, and wanted, not the early worm, but the belated fly. I counted be tween sixty and seventy bats. Not the ghost of a nound is oherd, As this beat--shall I call it I-or bird, Like a phantom flits out of this tree, So weirdly yot wondrously free. The tree is la gum tree, and the first one on the blind road leading to the railway eattlo yards, end close to the wharf sema phore; its limbs almost reach over tile semaphore.-Yours, etc., H.
