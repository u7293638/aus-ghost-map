A Nihilist Ghost.- : - .

" On I will tell you this story as near as ppsslble she in this gentleman's own words-- - "Tiwo or three months after marriago.I tbok dec my young wife down to ma plne in the north is of Scotland to spend the ?ew?'ear, it having Ion be?n a tilmehonored'custom in our family to eoc do so. Though ate weather was bitterly cold, kno we all managed to enjoy ouriielves, and my onl ,ife, who was the onlyady mnongt us, A. do' in excellent spirits and the life of the partj:y, co uate in the evening of New Year's Day le thr u entlemer were amusing oursclies '.in the to illiard-room (it must hiae blten nearlytw.elvo she o'clock) when I was surlprised to hear iblot's" her voice calling me from above, ihe having retiredl n~i some time before. Ongoing up to her roem, out she informed me that she had beenmnuch its. so tonished by hearingttho tinkle of sledge bells, and that on opening her window she had seen a c sledge quickly approaching, drawn by a pair of ier ?a-nificent black horses- and that it had.pulled lai n?i mmediateIv under her window.

Jsitakod ter if she were quife:aure she had no~ been dreisaing, rwhen she indignantly replied that she had never felt more wide awake an hir life; loving at the time bhien sitting:dp iritinga most important letter. WVhen I"rlatdtdi'smv wife's story in the billiard-room, one oino f. converialtriends suggested tlmt we should all ;aelly forthin a body and search th grounds for the uufortunate beggar; who had'no doubt lnst his wayn ad would b very glad to be given a of drink. We all acted on this idea with alacrity, hii aey smail exitoment being acceptable in a .odt ohrmtre house. In the meantime the -eatt er the had anplotely changed, and it hand commenced m to snow heavily, which acounted satisfactorily for our not being able to disoveer traices of the sldge.

She' hardly eemed to knouw-wshat ahe was doing, and whed I e n-. quired what on earth w-as the matter,-sankmiato a chair, gnsping out, "He has come igaiu "-1 aeeing that she was really eifected I hastened all to get her a glass of wine, rind beggid ier to be wine me full particulars.

WeV all fnet most iudignant at walmt we began to think was a very impertinent Iractiual:jok, and do eneigniog my wife, to the care of hier maid pr rushed out with the intention of finding and c making it hout for the perpretator.

We all returned to tci the homa somewhat subdued, and talked the no matter well over, when we came to the con- ani elusion that there must' be something queer about the affair, as it was absurd to imagine that my sensible little wife could be the victim gi ofuch a delusion. Therefore we unanimouslyt decided on keeping a watch in the billiard- so room-which was imnediately beneath 'Violet's ro neem-on. the following night, and wait for to iwh.it might incur. In the meantime we hadt agesnl iior to mention the subject to my wig, .,ii and the next day, slhemnot appearingat all hi- I ehned to introduce it, things weiton muuh as Sme time afterahe had retired for the nighlt es being fortified with sundry glases of iiut oddy, repaired to- the billiard-room to coni- I mrnee our vigil, where we turned down the v and drew up the blinds, and were all on i the qgi sire for anything that might happen.

On my enquiring the reason of her agitation she excitedly exclaimed, "-Look there Il pointing to the foot of the "teps. When I declared I saw nothing, she seemed completely mttergtd, and imtplo?,ered h.to take her houte. Poor Violet clung to nc closely, passionately exclaiming lthut if I did not do so at once she know ithe would die, and findingremonstrances only iuncrdaed her distress I thought it best to do as a iswiehed.

For sone time she was quite impracticable, but seeing at last how mucch in earnest I was, mty dear little wife edidei tly made a great effort and consented to return with sme.
