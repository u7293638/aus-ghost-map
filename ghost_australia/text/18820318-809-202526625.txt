MR. BRKT AKD THR BRUNSWICK DEPUTATION. to tub bd1t0b 0? the aoe. Srn, — Surely tlio worst enemies of the present Ministry could not wish for anything more suit able to their purpose than the unedifying spec tacle urcscntcd on the occasion of the recent deputation to Mr. Bent on tho ; subject of the Brunswick and Ooburg railway. . Tho Minister s demeanor must' havo been very insulting to causo Mr. Ramsay to declaro ho would nover introduco another deputation to him, and if your report of Mr. Bont'8 roforenco to "tbo devil himself" is correct, he must) as ho gazed upon tho rotroating forms of tho deputation whom his rudeness chased . from tho room, have had good reason to say, with the King of Epirus, "anothor such victory and wo aro un done.' Surely suave Sir Bryan does not relish such Pyrrhic conquests. Men who re ceive direct poraonal insults from a Minister of tho Crown aro apt to overlook the obliga tions of party discipliuo ; and although Mr' Bent talks slightingly about " election time,' he knowB vory well that at theso same seasons the ghosts of past slights and wrong riso very uncomfortably beforo tho candidate for pubiio favor, howover-iauntv mav bo his attitude in tbo board room. — Yours, &c;%, MODERATION.
