The Speed mid Direction of Ghosts, (New York Times ) A very large proportion of ghost stones, when they come to be carefully examined, prove to have no me re basis in truth than has an average Tribune political tab's There is, however, one variety of ghost story which claims respectful attention It usually runs as follow a person sitting alone in his room suddenly sees the apparition of an absent friend He notes the precise time, and a few days later learns that the absent friend died at that exact hour and minute Incidents of this kind have happened to so many persons of such unimpeachable veracity that it is very difficult to doubt them They have happened too often to be explained 1 as singular coincidences, and unless we boldly assume that in all cases the persons thus visited by a leged ghosts were either deceived or deceivers, we must admit that this particular type of ghost story is worthy of belief There is one remarkable feature in all this ap- parition of ghosts who are understood to come straight from the death bed of their bodies to visit their distant and surviving friends They apparently make no allowance for differences of longitude A ghost, for example appears to a person in New York it say 9 o'clock on the night of the 10th of June, and the person subsequently learns that the ghost in question left its body in London it 9 o'clock on the same night Now in point of fact when it was 9 o'clock p m in London it is about 4 of c c pm. in this city and when it is 9 o'clock pm in New York it is about two of clock a m in London It is hence evident that when the ghost of a a person who died in London at 9 o'clock in the evening by London time presents himself here at 6 o'clock by New York time, that ghost has apparently been about five hours in crossing the Atlantic If he had made the journey at the electric late of speed at which ghosts are popularly believed to travel he would have arrived here at 4 o'clock in the afternoon by our time As he did not, it is clear that his rate of travel is precisely that of the earth's revolution on its axis In other words, the ghost has not travelled at all, but has simply passed himself in the London atmosphere and waited until New York came round. This is a fact the importance of which cannot be over estimated by students of ghosts and their habits A careful examination of all the authenticated ghost stories of the peculiar type now under discussion will show that in every instance the ghosts came from the East Persons in England have seen the ghosts of friends who lived in India or China, and persons living in America have seen the "hoots of persons who died on the Atlantic Ocean or in Europe In no instance has a ghost arrived in London in hot haste from the United States or has a New York man been visited by the ghost of a Chicago friend It seems to be the inv n Labor rule that a new ghost never travels in an easterly direction. The ghost may have to lay a course to the north west of the south west but no matter how much nothing of southing he makes he always appears at a point west of that home which he started We are now in a position to combine what we know of the direction and rate of speed of ghosts, and to deduce the important law that ghosts have the power of moving in a northerly or southerly direction, but that while they have an apparent motion from east to west coincident with the apparent motion of the sun, they cannot by any motion of their o vi change their longitude the new made London ghost, if he desires to visit a New York friend follows the meridian of London in the direction of the equator at a speed so great is to be inappreciable, and having reached the latitude of New York, poises himself in air, and when the revolution of the earth brings New York under his feet partly drops into his friend's room We have here the first well established ghost law that has ever been formulated and we have a firm basis of facts for its support in the shape of the only authenticated class of ghost stones We may go even further, and de Luce the hardly less important law that the period during which the now ghost can thus hover near the earth is less than twenty four hours If the London ghost could re- in on as long as he chose watching the earth revolve and selecting his own time for dropping in on his friends there would be an end of the interesting ap I e trance of ghosts at the precise time of their escape from their bodies The ghost the it appears to an nounce his escape from the body is never behind time, but always appears at the precise time, by th AREA watch at which the mel nobody event took place, r We are thus compelled to believe that, while the ghost can remain near the earth during twenty four hours, and can use that time in making farewell calls, he is afterward compelled to remove to some distant sphere between which and the earth there is no regular and easy communication these facts are submitted is the beginnings of a true science of ghosts and it is to hoped they will be followed by the discovery of other and equally important laws, the knowledge of which will enable us to separate with certainty the true from the false in ghost lore.
