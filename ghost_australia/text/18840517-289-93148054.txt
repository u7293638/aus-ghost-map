THE QUEEN'S NEW BOOK. Moee Leaves fkom the JoubnaXi op a Life in the Highlands, from 1862 to 188% Sunday, October 24. 18SS. A Highland 'Kiratnin' (Christening).— At a quarter to i I drove, with Louise, Beatrice, and Lady Ely, to John Thomsont the wood forester's house, for the christening of theirchild, threeweeks old. Here, in their little Bitting room, in front of the window stood a table covered with a white cloth, on which was placed a basin with water, a bible, and a paper with the certificate of the child's birth. We stood on one side, and John Thomson in his Highland dress next the minister, who was opposite me at the head of the^ table. Barbara.hiawife.stoodnexttohim, with; the, baby in her arms, and then the old Thomsons and their unmarried daughter, the Donald Stewarts, Grants, and Victoria, Morgan and sister, and Brown. Dr. Taylor (who wore his gown) then began with an address and prayer, giving thanks ' for a livicg mother and a living child,' after which followed another prayer ; he then read a few passages from scripture, after which came the usual questions, which he addressed to th£ father, and to which he bowed assent. Then the minister told him— 'Present your child for baptism.' After this the father took the child and held it while the minister baptised it, sprinkling it with water, but not making the sign of the cross, saying first to those present : ' The child's name is Vic toria ;'' and then to the child : 'Victoria, I baptise th.ee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, One God blessed for ever.— Amen. The Lord bless thee and keep tb.ee I The Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious onto thee ! The Lord lift up His countenanco upon thee and give thea peace !' The service was' concluded with aaother short prayer and the usual blessing. I thought it mo3t appropriate, touching', and impressive. I gave my present (* silver mug) to the father, kissed the little baby, and thca we all drank to its health and tbat of its mother in whisky, which was baaded roaad with cakes. It was all so nicely done, so simply, and yet with such dignity. Monday, November 1. A Second Christening, 186S —I drove do va at a quarter to 4 with Louise, Beatrice, Leopold (who was on the box wtttx Brotfa, and Lady Ely, to the Bush (William Brown's), to witness the christening of his firat child, just a week old, which was to be called Albeit. The service was nearly the same, only two in stead of three prayers, and the youog mother with the child, who was only a week old, was seated by the fire, lookiog very nice, with the baby on her lap. The old mother, Mm. Brown, in her white matcb, the three brothers, and a few neighbors, stood round the room. I gave my present. Ic wu a touching and impressive sight to see the young father holding bis child with an ex* presBion of so much devotion and earnest* neap. On this occasion a dinner was given by the father after we left, in which Dr. T*jlor took put. Sunday, August 22, 1833. I went' to see old Mrs. .Grant, whom! «rai ' grieved to eee sitting inher chair supported bf pillow*, and her poor feet raised apoo cushions, very much altered in her face, add I fear, dyifcg of- dropsy. Ou Au£u*t 2G I ?gaia»»w«b«r and gave hern shairi and pair tf socks, and tWnd the poor -dd tool la ba4, looking very weak and very ill, vut taring her head and thanking me in her u»:ul «*y. ' I took her hand and held it Oa the 27th sha died. On the 23th I stopped at her cotiqgs end went in with Louise and Leopold. W* found all so dean and tidy, bat all , so silent. Mre. Gordon, her daughter, was there, having arrived just in time to spend the last - evening -and night with her ; and then she lifted the sheet, and there the poor old woman, whom we had known and seen from the first here thaw ' twenry.one years, lay on a bier in a BhroooV but with her usual cap on, peaceful and little altered, her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death. She had OB the socks I gave her the day before yester day. She was in her eighty-ninth year. Wednesday, September 1, 1869. Visit to Invertrossachs.— We got op a* ** balf-p&st; 7, breakfasted at 8, and at half past S left Balmoral with Louise, Beatrice* and Jane Churchill (Brown as always, unless I mention to the contrary, on the box), for BaUater. A high and rather cold wind,4nit vexy bright bud, dreadfully dusty. Colonel Poneonby met us at the railway station. Emilie Dittweiler and Annie Maodonald, Ocklce (for the two girls), Jane Churchill's a aid, Charlie Thomson, and the footman Cannon, went with us ; Blake, Spong with the luggage, A. Thomson, with Sharp (my faithful collie dog), and Annie Gordon (hcusemaid), Kennedy, Arthur Grant, and Hiley (the groom) with the ponies, all went yesterday; and three cooks came from London. We had a saloon carriage, ' but not my own. It grew hot in the railway train. We stopped at Aberdeen and the Bridge of Sun, where Jane Churchill got into our carriage and had luncheon with as ; but we could have no one to help to pack and unpack it, which is now so comfortably,' arranged in my own railway carriage where there is a communication with, the atten dants. Stopping a moment at Oupar Angus, we passed through Perth, and had another, short halt at Dunblane, where the people' crowded very much, Here we got a view of ~ the old cathedral, and turned off to Callan di-r, which we reached at a quarter-past 3. There was a very well-behaved crowd at the quiet station. Mr. and JLady Eaiily Mac-' nughtec, to whose house (which tbey had, meat kindly lent us) we were going, and Sir Malcolm and Lady Helen McGregor (he is ftiies McGregor's nephew, she Lady Emily Macnaghten's niece), received us there, ' Their little girl gave me a nosegay. We at _; once got into our celebrated sociable, which has been to the top of the Furca in Switzer. land, &c.;, and had been sent on before,' Colonel Ponsonby and Brown going on the box. We drove off at once with post-horses through the small town oC Callsnder, which consists jjof one long street with very few '~ shops, and few good houses, but many poor' ones. Poor Konne (who was to have managed everj thing, but had fallen ill) was stall lucL up there. We drove on, and, after about three-quarters of a mile's drive, cam's to 'Loch. Vermacbar, a fine lake about four miles long, ?with Ben Venue and other high and beanti* ful mountains rising behind and around it. The road is thickly wooded with oak, birch, beech, mountain ash, &e.; The house stands extremely well on a high eminence, overlook* icg the loch and surrounded by trees, and you drive up through evergreens and trees' of all kinds. Half an hour brought us to the door of the house, Invertrossachs, which it small and comfortable. At the entrance is av nice little hall in which there is a small bQ. lisrd-table; to the left, beyond that, a very nice well-sized dining-room with one large ffindow. To the right of the hall is the drawing-room, very much like the one at Invennark (Lord Dalhousie's)-; altogether the house is in that style, but larger. The staircase is almost opposite the hall door, and there is a narrow passage which goes on to the left and right, along which ace Louise's, baby's (Beatrice's), my hitting-room (a snug little room), and my bedroom (very good size); and out of that two little looms which I use as dressing and: bath looms, and Emilie Dittweiler's. Farther; on, round a corner as it were, beyond ' Louise's, are Lady Churchill's, her maid's, and Colonel Ponsonby'd rooms, all very fair* sized and comfortable. Close to my dressings rooms is a staircase which goes upstairs to where Brown and our other people lire. The rooms are very comf ottably and simply far* Dished, and they have put down new carpets everywhere. In the absence of poorXaune* ' whom we are so sorry for, Jongblath, the . cook, acts as steward, and showed us over the rooms. v We took tea and rested a little, and at twenty minutes to 6 drove out with the two. girls (sweet Beatrice very happy and very good, the first time she had been without* governess) and Lady Churchill. We drove along the loch, which has always to be done* , as there it no road on the Invertrossachs aide further than Invertrossaohs itaelf , andcrossed over the bridge at Goilantogleford celebrated in the 'Lady of the Lake,' then to the night * down a steep hill and over the bridge 'by Kilmahog, where there are a few cottages and a turnpike, on through the Pass of Lehy, » which is now (like every other bam and river) nearly dry, overhang by beautif al trees „ with very grand hills, reminding me much oE ~* Switzerland from their greenness, the ragged rocks, and the great amount of wood which * grows at their base and a good way up. It reminded Louise and me very much of Pilatos ~'~ with its meadows and fine trees on the way ~ to HergessvyL We went as far as the be* ginning of Loch Lubnaig, a very fine, wil-J» grand-looking loohj turning there and going back the same way. The view of L?eh Ten- ' nachar, with the beautiful deep blue of Ben « Venae and the other hills, was lovely.' We came in at half-past 7. Darling Beatrix __ * took her supper on coming in, but she cams ,* and sat with us while we were -at dinner ' ''' for a short while. Only four at dinner. ' We went out for a moment aftermirdf, *'-*? Very mild and starlight. Louise went to '' bed. Jane read a little to me In the drawing* room, but I went upstairs soon, as I was^ , tired. - i Thursday, Septembers. .;. . A very fine, bright, warm morning. We ~ , decided to go on an expedition, 'but liot to Loch Lomond, 'as we should have to jstart so early. Breakfasted in the drawing-room with Louise and Beatrice. Then writing, *c, ~ ' At twenty minutes to 12 I. started- 'ia the sociable with Louise*, B sat rice, J*ne -_ ~ Churchill, and Colonel Ponsonby and Brown. ' T on the box, and drove (excellent post-horse*, _&?- always only a pair) to Callander, bat turned. '- to the right short of it, and went on sostfr ~\ ^ little way. On coming to the top of a hill we ^ saw Ben Ledi, a splendid hill ; to the north* - * Ben Yoirlicb, and to the east the' heights ot -f£ Uam Var, a pink heathery ridge of no gtmg ~^j elevation; and in the distance, rising up |rom. ^ the horizon, Dun Myat, and tho WaH«e%^i Monument on the Abbey Craig, near 'Stir- ^J ling. We went across a moor, and thea soni^ pM passed Loch Roskie, quite a small lake. ^fl»ii& country about here is rather lowlaad, but asjrft-~J| proceeded it was extremely pretty, jrftbTBl**^ fine trees and cornfields, and. hftrresSog^ifp. going on; and soon alter, (lesoe&diajg; aJ»Ili,V^ we cwne upon the Loch of 'Menteito* (tii»^^s only lock in Scotland which is ever -called i.^% lake). It reminds one very much t»f JJach^;^' Kinnord near Ballater, and very loir bluejutd.^ £ pink hills rise in the distance. TtierB atelwp \ 4 or three islands in it; in the huge one, fitch-£ A mahome, yon perceive amongst, the ftfisk^J woods the ruins of the ancient priory. ^JoeoaC*fe Mary lived there onoe, and there ate3B0ttfcj4-, mentB of the Menteiths to be seen on it- 3Bt£ji£$ the right we passed the rain of ^oSaa^Tm CuBtle, and to the ief t the gates of tJufeBxij$g|l Bcdcock, with very fine large tree*; ^usHWM Mr. Graham, the proprietor was trtaaiiijg^^ We^went on and passed the Olachaa olf ^StaB^g fojle (renowned in Sir Walter^Soot^Ci£^tl| Bo-'), and here the splendid soea6ry*a||o|^ -high, rugged, and green Wll*^n;mlnl^j|^g me again of Pilatoo), very ftn» Utg« #n&.JJaSjim beautiful pick heather, int«*per»ed -^g^^ brackru, recks, and muter wood, 'in the^tf^^^ lovely profttsion, and Bea L-XDoai *&mdiQJBgg;& up before us with' its noble iAnge.-#i(^^^^ oi. p*iUp* » quarter of a mile, *adr4t^|^ ihtD 2 o'clock, »e got out mad faBJ^IJMfflHaH g-M under un c*k »t tta«.M{r^^Sffi ^^yjpq Adoring.

'?whicareminded me very much of the drive ?loBgTfee Lake Zag in Switzerland, Alto *'«etb*i, the whole drive along Loch Ard, then ?-jsy.ly.tte~ very small Loch Dow and the fine ^vXiOcitCboft, which is verjr long, was lovely. ;: ' Tb.e*l);eatber in fail bloom, and of thericbcst ' \3dn5i Bome almost of a crimson color, and T' growing in rich tofts along the road. One ' - -can*ee, by the mounds or heaps of stone, all ~'*r_ along Loch Ghon, where tie Glasgow water / ' .wwIm are carried, but they have sot dis I .;'.'?. figured ttoe landscape. ' .-.»? . : - Emerging from this road we came upon the *?*-? Jjocfi Xjomond*road, having a fine view of liochArklet,on the banks of which Helen ?'??'??'? ^StqGregor is said to htve been born. The ;?-V-r««neof «nr drive to-day is all desoribed in I :- ^Kob Boy.' Iioch Arklet lies like Loch r\v CaUafer, only that the bills are higher and ' .. aiore pointed. ' Leaving this little loch to oar . v kit,' in a few minutes wo came upon Loch *r' Xatrine, which was seen in its greatest '\ .iv;; Scant-fin the fine evening light. Most lovely ! '^ .'We Btopped at Stronachlachar, a small inn ' . where people stay for a night sometimes, and : where they embark coming from Loch ? Lomond and vice versa. As the small ' steamer had not yet arrived we had to wait :- ; ~ for about a quarter of an hear. But there '??*?. -wWco crowd, no trouble or annoyance, and ;- -ViBnringthe whole of bur drive nothing could '.? 'fie quieter or more agreeable. Hardly a \- , . creature did we meet, and we passed merely a t;-;-- Wyiew pretty gentlemen's place*, or very \- -?' ' 'poor cottages with simple women and bare -'?' footed long-haired lassies and children, quiat ' mid tmassuming old men and laborers. This . ' solitude, the romance and wild loveliness of C '' every tiling here, the absence of hotels and ?? ?:. -riteggan, the independent simple people, who ; . v- all speak Gaelic here, all make beloved i- Scotland the proudest, finest country in the \- ?_ world. Then there is that beaatif al heather, y-'-x. ^which you do not see elsewhere. I prefer it ^greatly to Switzerland, magnificent and % --'?? glorious as the Bcenery of that country is. It * was about ten minutes past 5 when we went V ...- -«n board the very clean little steamer Rob -. Boy— the very same we had been on under \-- such different circumstances in 1859 on the -' : -r 14th 'of October, in dreadful weather, thick :''y::' anist and ' heavy rain, when my beloved : . : Imsband and I opened the Glasgow Water. works. We saw the spot and the cottage \- ?: '?where we lunched. We took a torn and \- steamed a little way up the bay called Glen ' Gjle, where there is a splendid glen beauti ' fully wooded, which is the country of the : . McGregors, and where there 'is a house * ? : . which belonged to McGregor, of Glen Gyle, * which, with the property, has been bought by ?V -'; aiich Glasgow innkeeper of the same clan. ?? ??'-??: We turned and went on, and nothing could t . * he more beautiful than the loch, wooded all : along the banks. The rugged Ban Venue, so -: famed In the 'Lady of the Lake' (which we -?': , iad with us as well as several guide-books, of '_ wtich we find Black's far the best), rises ?' ? :; majestically on the southern side of the lake, ; -:- and looking back you see the Alps of Ar ; -',' xochar, which well deserve the name, for they '?'. are quite pointed and most beautiful; their v names are Ben Yean, Ben Voirlich, Ban ? £im,-and Ben Croea. Next came the well ': inown'SilverStrand,' 'Helen's Idle,' ^Mca ':?''. Jb most lovely, and tUe narrow creek so teautafolly wooded below the splendid high ' lulls, and the little wooden landing-place \- which - I remembered so well ; and very melancholy and yet sweet were my feelings f ? when Handed and found on the path some of lhe same white pebbles which my dearest , -Albert pickedup and had made into abraclet '' ? ? for me. X picked up and carriedoff a handful -. i 'myself. We bad taken our tea on board on deck.. We bow entered two hired carriages, '- » toegu-ls and I in the first, with Brown on the txjx, and Jane Churchill and Colonel Pon- \- '. ?. ? : sonby in the second. The evening was lovely, ? ' / and the lights and pink and golden sky as we V *: drove through the beautiful Trossacha were glorious indeed— ' -' ? So wondions wild, the whole might seem ??'-.: .-??. Ihe scenery of a fairy dream— ' . ? and along Loch Achray— the setting sun ha ^liind Ben Venue, which rose above most .. Slortoualy, so beautifully described by Sir W. -.-: -';'-. jBcott— \- ' The -western waves of ebbing day — ' _L Boiled o'er tbe glen the IbTel way. ''. ? Each purple peak, each flinty spire TTas bathed in floods of living fire. We passed the fine Trossachs Inn where ' , Xiouise had stopped with Alice and Louis in ??*. . 1S65, and a lovely little church in a most ??; .; picturesque position, and lastly the Brig of ? ? . -: Surk. It is a long way round Loch Venna :?- : - . «har tolnvertrossachs ; you see the house for '1 '.;? three-quarters of an hour before you can get .' to it, Home at. 8. The drive back was ; lovely, for long after the sun had set the sky ; v';' remained beautifully pink behind the dark \- -?: i)lne hills. A most successful day. Dinner ??-j [ as yesfcerdsy. I felt very tired. :^;__\ ., . Friday, September 3. :-.-p;- ' A*ery dull, dark, thick morning, and the ?;;.-/;- - luHsbeyond Oallander hardly visible. Stall, \- ~r jiorain. Went np to my room and wrote a -:'- y'-; kittle, and at 12 took a walk in a very pretty V '' 'wood quite close below the house, from several ' \ .'*; poinisof which there are beautiful views, bat \--- : ' -the atmosphere was too thick to see them to f'-Z .;?'- ^ay. We lunchedall together. At half-pist ::;-' ;3we started again (just as yesterday), aud r - drove up the noble Pasa o£ XiBny, past KU jEahog.wherea little- bay tried to give me a nosegay which was fixed to a pole, and in jy trying to eaten it Colonel Ponsonby let it ^^fau. The little boy screamed 'Stop, stop!' j- :'and«uiin8uch an agony of disappointment \- ^batl^topped the carriage, and took it from ^ ?iim' tobis motber'a great delight. On oar ?S ;;*ay.we Eimr«ii a hill among woois Lsny : j ^ JHottre{belongingto Mr. BnchananHamilton), '^ ^'fFhae.Sir W.

It is four miles long, and i:^A--«W-1|wBI|na* There is a-raflway unfinished, ;;;? J-^ only ^a single line, on the western side, and *;iS^asit«an along tbe loch it again reminded me ^ J\«f the AicnstraBse at the points where it fj^-4SpeBtlow near the water. The road leads g^i:j«m|arlwHiafnlEjciittore trees. We passed ^te^'^Bn'&e; right a farmhouse called Ardnullary, ^l^wtere formerly the Abyssinian traveller g^^tjctoe.;-nsed to live, and nest entered S^-^Btmttyrej a fine broad open strath, woodsd ^^h;;:»na witti cornfields, the heather on the hills :y;:;&':4quite;pink.

We got oat and walked '^m^p**teep knoll overhanging the road, on ^^^^ielyrt&der; a cpHndid plane tree (we passed ^H»taeini»tl- autifallime8 jait before), ie&e; I:.-.-:,-: i!dkirkyardwlflia» ruins ttttheoldohurah. We went at once to look, it the tomb oC Bob Boy,ftfiatBtoneom»nichi« carved a figure * In « kflt, sad next to it a stone where his wife Is buried, and on which a sword is rudOy carved. His son's tomb is next to his, bat looks far more modern. We went on to look at a very curious old font, and then at two or three other tombstones. On one of these were some verses, which Mr. Cameron, the schoolmaster, an intelligent young man, recited, and afterwards wrote but for me. ? We afterwards went into the very pretty new church, which is close to the old ruin. Nothing can surpass the bsauty of the position of this spot, for it overlooks Lash Veil and a glen, or rather mere raviae or corry, with a hill rising behind it. We walked down again and re-entered our car riage, driving back the same way, and passing about half a mile from the Kirkton, on our road back, the present burial-place of the McGregors {whose country this is, or alas! lather was), which is a chspel standing in a wood, the whole enclosed by a wall and iron gbtetroy. We drove past the King's House a very short way, and then got out, scrambled up the hillside, sat down on a tank over* hanging a burn, kindled a fire, and had our Us. This was on Lord Breadslbane's pro perty. We got home from this very inter esting and beautiful drive by a quarter-past 8\. The day had not been bright— dark snd dull, but quite clear enough to see everjthicg in this truly beautiful country. Dinner as before. We always sit in the drawing-room, and Ja&e; road on: the 'news paper to us. (To be contained. )
