Wiii, -n.-li a t..i.-o argued, if they were unable to route Berer ley, anJ drive him from the field, never to return. Although Winifred protested against such an invasion, the necessary inflations were despatched, and in due course accepted by the parties concerned. In the meantime Bevtrley was supposed to be in London, and Winifred's heart was about as sad as it was possible for the heart of a maiden to be. Indeed, the only person who seemed to be enjoying the fes tive season at all was the grey ghost of Sir Michael, who, within the previous month, had been twice seen on his accus tomed promenade. The result was so upsetting from a domestic point of view that, instead of venerating him as he had iiern liroujrlit up to do, the Squire began to look uj»on his su]terna.tural relative as a nuisance second only to lfeverley him self. Though he protested that it was all Jj'.ncy and tlio^e who declared that they had sot-n the apparition must have dreamt !t, ' l:ii\c an idea that he was no more disjii.ui; lo pay a visit to the Quadrangle at night than were tbe maidservants them selves. AVbat was more lie confined his visits to the Chapel to daylight, and anx iously looked forward to the time when his visitors should arrive, and by so duin» Ai Ist-t the great Jay came and the stables found their time fully taken u|. Hall. Holly and mistletoe den-orated the corridors, [.-real logs spluttered on the lires. ami all was gaiety and merry mak ing'. The Squire. In all appearances, was jollity itself. He had a warm wel.-om;- for each new arrival, a joke for the men. and. will, if the truth must be told, a kiss for the Hrls. The sei-ds of some premising Iliitatinns were sown at afternoon tea. and l.y Hie lime ihe dre-ssing gong ^lundeil ???-11- Indeed, it was not ,i,,til |at-- in lUe evening, just a~ the bedroom cnndlestick made thnlj- ,,|,|u anim-e. that a damper n- ? ?i-l '!??'' liie spirits of the parlv.

I«Tha|:s. if the truth must be told, for still another. !!?? was well aware that she loved young Jlcierh-y, and lie was fille-d with sorrow that it should have fallen to his lot to have liven compelled to differ ironi her a, to the merits of the man of her choice. However, as the matter stood it was impossible for him to draw hark, and accordingly he was forced not only to let her suffer, but to suffer himself at the same time. lie thought of this when his guests had departed to their various bed rooms, and he and Winifred stood at the bottom of the great staircase, bidding each other pood-night. His old heart was when Winifred clasped her arms about lus neck and said. ** Dear old uncle, vou must try to think better of me. You Uave been so pood to me, and 1 have repaid your kindness so poorly. You will never know how grateful I am to you for it all.' Tooh, pooh,' said the Squire, ''you mustn't talk nonsense, little girl. Ron pway to bed. and come dowu to breakfast in the nioruing with the roses on your cheeks.' He noticed that the girl heaved a heny -igli as she turned to go upstairs, and. though I.e.- could not understand the rea He began to wonder whether young Bever ley mijcht not. with eni-ourageiuent. turn out better than he expected, and if he slii-uld give him the change. This led liim t.) think of his -},-.tr. dead brother, and of Winifred's mother. Loth of whom at orphan child. He ae-i.rdtngly heaved ano ther heavy sigh, more doleful than the first, and accompanied old Gregory on his lockingr-up operations -with an even sadder heart than ever. He had not retired to however, a sleepless couple by the way, when the unmista.kcaule dick of an iron latch in the Quadrangle below reached his ears. What could it mean * He sprang out of bed and hastened to the window. He was only just in time, for there, cross ing the open space, was a tall, grey figure, habited in the costume of a Cavalier. It was a frosty night, and the moon shone so cold and dear that even- detail of his costume was plainly observable, even to the love locks and the long grey Loots. For the first time in his life the Squire was looking upon the apparition whose appearance was supposed to foretell death or disaster to his family. Suddenly, how ever, something struck him as being some what singular, and whin he had seen the figure disappear by the small door into the chapel on the other side, he left tbe win dow and began to dress. Then, taking a tandle. he departed from his chamber, and set off on a tour of inspection- The hous? was- in total darkness, and as silent as a grave. He did not hesitate, however, hut pushed c.n. j avscd the billiard room, passed Ihe (haprl itself. Once there he blew out the light, and softly opened the door. Creeping in he found the worshipping place of his ancestors in total darkness, save where it was lighted by the moonbeams which entered through thp lancet windows on the further side. Tile marble effigies of his long departed relatives showed stiff and dark .-ihovc their tombs, but in the centre of the aisle stood two figures whom he clearlv rei-c^nised. One was the Grey Cavalier, th? ether Winifred, his niece. 1'min l.is place of vantage he could plainly overhiiir all that thev wrr? saying. Their -Are you sure. Dick dear. lliaV you mean what yon siiy »' whispirid the girl, who Lv the v.'itv had her arms round the Cava I fir's neel:. -(.'Kite sure.'' the ?ihc.ht of the C.rvy \--a\n!irr r.plicd. -The old man lovrs you, and though he doesn't trust me.

You say there is a l;all on Boxing Xijrlit. so 1 suppose 1 must wait until another night to wee you.' 'What, the Urey Cavalier make his appearance on such a festive occasion ? If you think you could manage lo slip away for a quarter of an hour I might 'I am sure I could. At any rate III do my best. Hut isn't it a great risk to ???:isk. not a lit of it.

So far a» that ]/orticular ni^ht was concerned, his rest was likely to he disturbed. In the room ing, however, he was a different iieinjr : he lutd come to an understanding with himself, and wa^ brijrhter in con^pi]uenw. I!is face at breakfast said as much. Never liad si:th a Christinas Day been known at i'enterten Hall. The Squire was like a IV. IV man: he proposed everyone's liallli «t lunch, and conducted himself like an auiialile lunatic during the remainder of the day. Uoxing liay arrived in due c-mditiou. Winifnd M-an-elv knew what A FITZROV GARDES. ANOTHER VIEW. A FITZROr GARDEN'. to make of hie beliaviour. Poor ehnd, the dance of that evening presented no chance of enjoyment for her. Before dusk the Squire summoned the Colonel and too or ihrce of the young men to his study, and kept them tiierv for upwards of an Iiour. It was to be observed that when they emerged they seemed to be staggering under the weight of a great responsibility. Of all the balls thirt have taken place at ^ .- 1'enterton, tliat of which I am about to f attempt a description will always be con sidered the most remarkable. One of tlie most noticeable features was the fact that sl.ortlr before midnight the Colonel and 'he young uipu aforesaid disappeared from ihe ball room. Winifred followed their v?.3n-|,K- a little later. The Squire also was nrit to be seen. The clock in the belfry had scarcely struck twelve before the door of the bail room opened and the Squire entered, es corting his niece. She was very pale, and seemed much put out about something. Almost at the same moment the door at the furthrr end of the room opened, and a singular figure, attired after the manner cf :fcc reign of the first Charles, entered, e-.~ort«I Ly tto Colonel and liis stalwart aides. Winifred, on seeing him. uttered a -iy. and would have run towards him hut thai the Squire heM her back. -Ladies and gentlemen,' the dear old fel low began, looking round at thos? present as he spoke, 'all of yon have heard of the famous Grey Cavalier of Penterton Hall. You will in the future be able to say that you have seen him face to face, and that he if not as terrible as you have been led to suppose. At last the Spectre has Wen laid by the heels! and in saying that I have to make a confession to you. My dear friend i. I feel that I am very much to blame. For a loop time past I lute listened to ihe voice of public opinion, and refused to hear that of love. The tfrst I ani about to put on one side ; upon the oli-cr for the future I will pin my faith.

From this mo tattt we will let bygones be bygones, and now'' (luxe he turned to the musicians) *' pipy lip : let us have some music.' Of. course, we all know the story of the at aivy rat*, those of us vt-h© were BjaT licd, drligiiied at the denouement. Wini fred's face was a picture lo see, and as for the ghost. welL if ever the Grey Cavalier was half as happy as lie appeared to be as he whirled his lady love over the liall room floor, he must have been as jolly a sjiectreas could have been found through lime. and the Squire has coiiiiiiiinded our presence at the cprcniony.
