NEWS BY THE MAIL. TOPICS OF THE WEEK. (FROM. GOD CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, FEB. 4. The time of Parliament during the week has been wholly occupied by a very general debate on the address in reply to the Queen's speech. The House of Lords This had no business of interest before it Biive once. On Friday night, just before the mail left, Lord Wear) ss brought up the whole question of our defensive preparations, and In the course of a discussion, Lord Northbrook Rave praise to Lord Salisbury for standing by his naval programme, in opposition to the imperious demands of Lord R. Churchill for retrench- ment The noble lord spoke emphatically of the necessity of completing the defences of the coaling stations Lord, Harris, making the official reply, promised and hinted at a great many things, but he said precisely that a repeating rifle for the army was almost chosen, and that every effort would be made to push on the works for the protection of the coaling stations Since Friday the Peers have literally done nothing The Commons having spent six day in a general discussion of the subjects mentioned in the Queen's speech, when three would have been ample, are about to start upon the seven or more amendments which have been tabled against the various paragraphs of the Address Of these the chief comes from Mr Farnell, who sets out in extensive, but very innocuous, phrase the assertion that the ills of Ireland would only cease upon the final settlement of the land question, and the concession of Home Rule. 'Taking the debate so far as it has gone, it must be confessed that it has been inordinately dull but it has not been absolutely devoid of interest On Friday night Sir M. Hicks Beach intervened at a late hour to make a defence of his action in putting pressure upon the Irish landlords to be consecrated to the tenants Previously there had been a little "scene about the Glen- leigh evictions. The Chief Secretary being interrogated by the Nationalists and their English allies Messrs 'Theodore Try and Con)beare-declared that the only remedy for such a case as this was to remove the poverty) stricken people to some other dis- trict in Ireland " or elsewhere " Upon this there were cries of "Shame" from the Irish benches, whereupon the speaker severely observed that this exclamation was quite un- parliamentary, that it was also quite new, and that he should not allow it to be used in the future. Being asked if the Government approved of the action of the agent in burn- ing out the Olenboigh tenants, the Chief Secretary declined to express an opinion, and amidst Boroo interruption He asked those who were honestly interested in the condition of these unfortunate people to co-operate with the Government in a measure of relief such as immigration Later on Sir Michael Hicks Beach renewed this offer of a relief bill, and made a vigorous defence of his administration in Ireland On this latter matter he denied that poverty gave a man a right to live in a house which did not belong to him, and therefore though he did not like the burnings at Glenleigh and destruction of the masses by the crowbar, he could not intervene He denied further that he had ever exercised a dispensing power in Ireland In no case could it be shown that protection had been refused to the sheriff doing his duty. As to the pressure said to have been put upon the landlords by the Government, it was true that he directed General Buller and other magistrates, when evictions were likely to rebut, to bring the circumstances before the owners and agents, especially where the former were non-resident and to use any influence of reason and argument to promote a settlement between landlord and tenant. I had no doubt was going beyond the ordinary line of his duty as Chief Secretary, but no one could produce a case in which any official threatened a landlord or told him he would not be protected so as to coerce him The Times Campaign was a criminal conspiracy, and consequently altogether different in its operation On Monday night Mr. Bradlaugh opened the bull with some pointed criticisms on Burmese affairs. He was followed by Lord Randolph Churchill, who surprised everybody by) making another speech of an hour's dura- tion, march) in justification of his withdrawal from the Government. Lord Ran- dolph spoke of the pleasure with which he had heard the instructions given to Sir Wai W lute In regard to Bulgaria, saying they seemed to be framed with prudence, caution, and wisdom, and might materially) assist to a settlement of the Balkans question. Here, I may interfere with the explanation that on the previous night Mr W. H. Smith stated that fair Win White had been ordered to guide his conduct in the negotiations now in progress at < Constantinople between the Porte and the Bulgars ins by the Berlin treaty, and subject to that, to deal with the proposal of Russia in a friendly spirit. Returning to Lord Randolph, it has to be said that he was very patronising to Sir M. Hicks Beach of whose great sacrifices" in remaining at Dublin Castle, the Opposition made merry But the noble lord excited not a little surprise in his own quarter by saying that he had never been much alarmed by " The Plan of Campaign " It was a singular and strange proceeding, and had consequently attracted attention, but it had prevailed on ft comparatively small scale As to the struggle for the maintenance of the union, he declared that in Ireland it was absolutely over it had left behind it great popular excitement, but it the opposition would place more confidence in their own agrarian remedies the Land Acts of 1881 and 1885-these would prove a most powerful narcotic in reference to the present condition of affairs But if the battle of the union was over in Ireland, it was not over in England. He believed the right way to maintain the union was to identify the Government of the union and the party of the union with good government, with efficient administration, and with progressive legisla- tion This was his object when he was in the Cabinet. He made it his constant thought to make things as easy as possible for the Liberal Unionists by proposing such measures as they might conscientiously support, and by making such electoral arrangements as would enable them to preserve their seats lnthntUouso But at the same time he looked upon the Liberal Ministry as a useful kind of crutch, and he looked forward to the time when the Tory party might walk alone, strong in its on the strength and conscious of its own merits. It was to the Tory party, and solely to the Tory party, that he looked for the raointen ance of the union From these remarkable utterances Lord Randolph passed on to utter a word of warning to his party as to the danger of the attempts at Liberal reconcilia- tion, and to throw ridicule upon Mr Chuni Britain's proposal that statesmen of all parties should join in an attempt to settle the Irish difficulty. The Tory party could never agree to a policy which, by any reasonable construction, could create in Dublin anything in the nature of an Irish Parliament. After stating that the proposed rules of procedure were precisely in the same form as when he left the Cabinet, Lord Randolph observed that if the estimates were really framed with due regard to economy and efficiency," as stated in the Queen's Speech, they must have been greatly altered within quite a recent period. He noticed, however, that Lord Salisbury had spoken of the rapid and most " injurious increase " of the public expenditure, and he looked upon that as a distinct advance. It seemed that the head of the Government was now prepared to co-operate with Parliament in reducing the public expenditure Consequently he would suggest two things first, that in regard to the discussion of the Estimates the House should have the statements of the responsible Ministers circulated and printed several days in advance, so as to be prepared for the discussion, and next, that after the Estimates were produced and the first votes on accounts taken they should then go to a committee of the House that would have power to send for persons and records, to take evidence, and to get all necessary information, Finally, Lord Randolph denied that he resigned office on the question of the defence of the coaling stations, Lord Salisbury cleverly identified his resignation will thutquestion, but he resigned upon retrenchment, and upon nothing else. This speech has caused something like a sensation. The Liberal Unionists have chosen to consider it as a deliberate "insult," and Lord Randolph has been told that if they are the "crutch ' the Tory party is the cripple," with many other things of the same sort. Of course, the Opposition have done their best to increase the discord which has arisen from the use of an unlucky metaphor On the other hand, the Government have acted handsomely towards their allies. Lord Geo Hamilton, speaking on Tuesday, expressly declared that the Government had no sympathy with Lord R. Churchill's observe tionsanenttho "crutch " " Wewereontneeve of the last battle for the Union, and certainly until that battle had been fought no member of the Government would be willing to insult those allies by whose assistance they gained so great and unexpected a victory last year ' As to Lord Randolph's practical suggestions, the First Lord of the Admiralty said if it were the general wish of the House the Government would circulate in advance the statements generally made by the chiefs of the War and Admiralty departments in introducing the estimates But thoLxecutivemustbeprimarilyand ultimately responsible for the expenditure recommended to Parliament, and this could not be relegated to the decision of a committee On two points, however, the Government would be glad of assistance were the establishments too large for the work done and did the country get an adequate return for its expenditure 3 The First Lord of the Treasury would consider whether the suggestion thrown out by the member for South Pad- dington could not be accepted in this limited Bhape. Later in the evening Lord R Church lull came in for a very severe drubbing From Mr, Chaplin Taking up the two speeches made by the noble lord on his resignation, Mr Chaplin declared that they had made his position worse than it was before Lord Randolph denied that he resigned on the question of the coaling stations, but there were his written words against him saying that " the war estimates night be considerably reduced in the policy of the expenditure on the military and mercantile ports and coaling stations were abandoned or modified ' But allowing the noble lord to have his way in this matter, what was to be said about his present cry for retrenchment, when a few months ago he declared to the interviewer of the little Mall Gazette that he believed in " the truth about the navy, and that it was evident that an expenditure of some millions was required to bring it up to the level of the national requirements In other speeches the noble lord declared that he believed the expenditure on the navy would be popular as well as patriotic Now he Bald husband your resources, make no preparation for the possibilities of war, leave your parts and your coaling stations altogether undefended , repose on the und> ing historic memories of the past, so that when war is actually upon you, and the light has already begun, you will be able to display the exuberance of our resources in all their irresistible might " Meanwhile Lord Randolph has gone off to the continent for a long tour he has been in great anxiety of mind, and his medical man has ordered a cruise on the Mediterranean, during which the noble Lord will visit Algiers and Tunis But he left word that he means business on his return, since he has made engagements to speak at Paddington and in Birmingham, besides which he is to lay before Parliament and the country some very important facts dealing with naval and military expenditure Next to Lord Randolph's doings and the week's Parliament, the speech delivered by Lord Hartington at Newcastle on Wednesday night is perhaps the chief event of the week It has been contended from certain casual expressions of the noble marquis but he is moving his ground, and drifting " towards his old friends But the wish is father to the thought On the contrary, Lord Hartington called upon his friends' to maintain their resistance to the dust. In explain- ing why he had remained outside the Government, he said that he thought he could best serve the cause of the union by maintaining his position within the ranks of the Liberal party, but he had advised Mr. Goschen to join Lord Salisbury because Mr Goschen, from former differences with his friends, had lost much of his first influence in the Liberal Councils Referring to the " crutch" speech of Lord Randolph Churchill, the noble Marquis questioned his wisdom, and retorted that the Tory party would not be permanently the prevailing political party in this country. Tile Liberal party] would surely return to power, and probably be the dominant party during our time Alluding to the attempts after Liberal reunion Lord Hartington said he wished well to the effort. He joined in the suggestion of Mr Chamberlain that men of all parties should come to the settlement of the Irish question, but he took care to remark that he did not see any possible advantage in the examination of the Canadian or any other form of Colonial Government they should on their own side know how much they were willing to concede, and demand to know the exact objects the other side were aiming at, else they would be getting into greater confusion and making the difficulties of the problem more insoluble than ever On the question more immediately before the country, he considered it was the duty of every Unionist to assist the authorities in maintaining law and order Whilst striving also to do justice to the people, the Government should deal firmly with the political agitators who acted from no motives of humanity] The pressing problem, said Lord Hartington was how to relieve the over crowding of population in certain parts, and here statesmen of all parties might join in effecting a national settlement of those great economical difficulties which be in the roof of the miseries of Ireland It will be for your readers to say from this how far there is reason in the suggestion that Lord Hartington is "drifting" from the Union moorings Irish affairs do not show much that is fresh the return of Mr Davitt from the States with his newly married wife has been niailetheoccasionofnationulistdemoiistration in Queenstown, Cork, and Dublin, and the Nationalists tell us that the ex convict will now take direction of the plan of campaign, pending the absence of the Irish members at Westminster At Belfast there has been some further rioting, in which firearms were used, but no one was killed. In Dublin, Cork, and Limerick the municipal authorities have declined to contribute to the imperial Institute, or to celebrate the jubilee in any way At Cork a resolution was passed declaring that the Prince of Wales would do better to seek the relief of Irish distress than to build such an institute Mr Goschen is to another political contest, but this time with the certainty of success Lord Algernon Percy, who represented St. George's, Hanover square, one of the most fashionable districts of London, has made way for him, and he will be elected early next week The malignity of the Liberals will not, however, permit Mr. Goschen to have a walkover, although there is not a ghost of a chance for his opponent. 'The European situation does not improve, and yesterday the London Stock Exchange, answering to the movements of the Continental Bourses, was in a state of panic. Nothing like it has been witnessed since 1885 The reported stones that the Emperor William and Prince Bismarck have both of them surrendered to the views of the Berlin War Office, which are known to be in favour of immediate hostilities against France, are preparing the public mind for the worst To these was added yesterday's statement that Germany was about to raise a loan of 15 millions sterling for war purposes This, of course, sent down prices with a crash Here in England the question of our responsibilities to Belgium is much discussed, and the Government will shortly be asked to show their hand in regard to it, The hope prevails that as Germany and France are to guarantors of Belgium with ourselves, Lord Salisbury would decline to act alone. In giving the Liverpool Steamship "ring" the new contracts for the carriage of the American mail, the Postmaster General has retained the Thursdays despatch by the North German Lloyds Steamer from South ampton, thus arranging four despatches weekly to the States, instead of three, as formerly Simultaneously the Admiralty has made arrangements to take over at peace rates, when needed, a certain number of the best and fastest American liners as armed cruisers. The White Star and other com- ponies are to build new boats on plans approved by the Admiralty for this purpose The floating of Allsopp's Brewery as a limited company caused a great scene in the city much beyond that which prevailed at Bnrint s Bank when Guiness a Brewery was put on the market At the end of the second day, however the premiums on the shares have fallen and there was great shyness amongst jobbers in touching them
