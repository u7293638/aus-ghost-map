A DETERMINED BRIDE. The ''Leader's'' Vancouver correspon dent, under dale July 26, forwards a grisly adventure which reads like a piece of Wesiern newspaper fiction, as, per haps, it is:â€” Miss Maud Cranston, who resides on Kootenay Lake, in the far eastern part of British Columbia, set out, along with her intended husband, J. A. Carson, and her relatives, on board the slAimor KlnnHikp. for Rmmer'K Perrv in the adjoining state of Idaho, there to get married. As the boat passed the house of the preacher who had originally under taken to perform the ceremony, but had failed to put in an appearance, they saw the reverend gentleman a prisoner on the roof of his submerged residence. The valley had become flooded by the sudden rise of the river. The parson was rescued and taken aboard. While he was changing his wet clothes the steamer made a brief stop at Rice's landing, where two fresh passengers came aboard with a rough pine coffin containing the remains of James Carter, who had been drowned in the river the day before. When the preacher came on deck in dry clothes the young couple said they would have the marriage take place there and then. The ceremony had proceeded almost to the point where the clergyman would declare them man and wife when two dogs, which began to fight, upset the flimsy pine coffin, the fall breaking it open. One glance at the dead man's features and the bride gave a 6eream and swooned away in the arms of the groom. The corpse was that of a for mer lover to whom she had been engaged to be married. When she recovered, how ever, she decided to proceed with the cere mony, declaring that neither ghosts nor corpses should prevent her from becoming Mrs. Carson.
