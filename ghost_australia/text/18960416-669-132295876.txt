THE GHOST THAT STARTLED THE PARMER. (By John Haynes, M.P.) Splendid old ghost that has long done duty for the rich monopolist in startling the farmer is the ghost of freetrade. And now when the ' poor farmer ' is being plundered (as tbey say) by a land tax, the famous ghost has been white- 1 washed and trotted out again. Say the j scouts of the big man â€” 'You've gone and taxed oar lands, and now you've taken off the duties and let in the foreigner to compete with us,' their I object being, of course, to get the farmer to vote down land tax and vote up pro tectionist taxes. But the fact is, our farmers are kept in beggary so long _a8 they are prevented from trading' with the world, and trading between nations is done only by exchange of goods. If we shut out goods from abroad, there is a corresponding decline in the purchase of our goods or products. There is no such thing as sending money out of the country, except, ofcourse, where excessive protection prevents exchange and ex BVir instance, in N.S.W. 20 years ago we had about eight millions of money coined for the use of the people, but though we have imported millions worth ot goods and sota minions worth since then, there is only about the same amount of money in the country. No more is required. Now and again some thousands of sovereigns are sent out from Sydney to London, but most of it is Queensland gold minted at Sydney, and the balance, a few thousands, goes to square up transactions bstween us and the outside world, . and which transac tions amount to many millions sterling. We all remember the old ghost's cry, ' Let us have protection and keep the money in the country.' There never was any money going out of the country. It was only school-boy talk. The only country that has had to send money out heavily to balance a badly top-sided trade is protectionist Victoria.
