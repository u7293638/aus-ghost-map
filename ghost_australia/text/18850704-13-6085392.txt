THE LAND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE. BY GEORGE AUGUSTUS SALA. I—ACROSS THE PACIFIC. Five years ago, in the early spring time, sojourning for a while at San Francisco, a friend drove me in his spider Waggon, one en- chanting, sunny morning, through the leafy glades of the Golden Gate Park, and so to an hotel on the seashore over against the famous Seal Rock. I mind the trip well for more 'han one reason Lunching at the hotel I lound my dear old friend Tdward Askew Sothern, who-as Lord Dundieary-had been playing to crowded houses at San Francisco during the week but who had been for a long time in deplorably bad health ne looked that Spring morning at the Clift house as on: unmistakably mur Iced tor death All who nu might read 'IhanatoB imprinted willi ghastly distinctness on his forehead He waa so pitiably weak and ill that ha was com polled to forego partaking of a little enter tamment which we had planned lor that afternoon, nnd to ho down on a couch until it was timo for lum to return to 1 Idorado and piny tom fool-and how inimitably did he play it-tor the iivo or bix thousandth time ns the eccentric whom he lind tuiijit millions of Americans and even I n"hsh men, to regard as the hfelll e type of a mern berof tho British anatocracy lins only to pazo upon his handsome fice and hstin to Ins kindly voice onu more on this side the grave A few months after our meeting on the shoro lund by tho Holden Gato I just had titnc to sha! o his hand mid Interchange half ti doren words with him in a private box ut the Puncessa I beatie, London A vervfew days afterwards I heard that poor Sothorn Yvnsdend But thoro is another reason v hy that trip to the Cliff house and tho Sold Bocks con tinues to dwell ni my memory J. was when tlie waggon tuined a sharp angle of the road, shortly before we arrived at our destination, that mino oyes first caught sight of the Pacific 's ea , ti e PqcIIic Ocean, a broad band of ultramarine, gleaming at the ond of a vista of graceful foliage 1 have heard of travellers who have expressed thoinseliea nB disappointed with tho Atlantic and who have even failed to boiinpreustl bl the first Bight of the 1 alls of \la"aia , and .t is related of John Kemblc, the tragedian, that visiting Chamounix veiy late in hfo, he made no secret of lus opinion that Mont Blanc was a much ovctrited mountain 1 own myself, that I have ga/ed without emotion on the Gtiadnlqiuvcr and that I never thought much of the Miuiennarcs But the first rapid glimpse of the Pacific filled me with almost unmuigled delight It was worth while well worth while-to havo como bo many thousands of miles lo hi hold that se i, to havo been jolted in tho train day after day from Chlingo to Omaha, from Omaha to Ogden from Ogden to Sacramento City , to have traversed Wearyfoot Common, other wise ti o Rocky Mountains to have run the gauntlet of the anowsheds mid Webber a Cafton mid the Devil h Slide, to have threaded the gorges of the Sierras Nevadas, and, entering at u st on the loy oils descent of the Pacific Slope, to have passed through what appeared to you as an earthly 1 den after all the snowy deserts which you lind painfully ploddel ovet And at last you had reached tho long yeained for Pacific 1 said tint my delight in reaching a bourne so anxiously awaifed was al most unmingled But there was just one little drop of bitter in my cup of joy 1 stood for a long time alone ni the votiintlah of the hotel, satiating my vision with thenowunim peded view of the blue ocean Over against mc, within pistol shot, was tho group of rocks up which the brown furred, black eyed good naturcd looking Beals were clambering, or lying basking m the sun by tho score und by the hundred Anon they would descend and dive into the buny breakers bent I sup pose, on a brief fishing excursion Now and again there would be u tumultuary splashing in tho water and an ominous popping up from the surface ol one bullet head after another-bullet heads displaying teeth like 1 wise-as thougn seal had fallen out willi Beal, and there was u fight in progress on some disputed question of piscatorial pro petty All this while the creatures, which wero clambering or al ylorkii« on the crags, or scattering the foam from their fur coats, ceasett not to bark fun ously The residents of the woslern ox tremity of the Manne parade, at Bnghton, used bitterly to complain of tho nocturnal uproar raised by the sen lions at the Aqua rlum 1 wonder what those delicately nerved people would havo thought ot the incessant bow wowing of tlie furry denizens of the Se ii Rods» Surely the narrow waterway be tween tho cra"s and tho eli fis oti=hc to bo called " Barking Creek But I looked far anead-far, far away be- yond the waste of blue I looked to the horizon Over there was China, over there was Japan, over thero was Australia, lor how many years liad I been longing to look nt life in the Southern Hemisphere' In the Bay of San Francisco thero was a plenitude of stout Bhips, which, in less than a month, would bear me to nong Kong, to Yokohama, or to Sydney And why not return to I ng land by the way of India' It was not to be tills time I had been globe trotting for many years but the pardonable ambition to be a circumnavigator was not yet to be giatificd Lcaidca, I had lett responsibilities behind me I had given hostages to 1 ortune in tho United States I hud come straight to '1 risco, leaving Utah unvisited I was morally bound, on my retain eastward, to turn aside at Ogden, branch ofl at Salt Lake City
