S.A.J.C. FLEMOGTON MEETING. [By Telegraph.! MelWmrrtfi. Mav 1O.1™ The second day's racing of the South Aus tralian Jockey Club, which was postponed from Thursday on account of wet weather, took place on Saturday, and though the attendance was very small at the time when tbe first race was run it materially increased afterwards, and when the Cup came on for decision there were at least 10,000 people pre sent, including the Governor and Lady Loch and suite. The weather, was rough and cloudy, but remained fine during the afternoon, and the course was in capital going, though not conducive to fast time. The Australian Mili tary Band performed selections during the day on the lawn, and -altogether the day was a most successful one. Great interest was centred in the Cup, and large num.; bers inspected the candidates in the pad dock. Lord Wilton and Camerine were the first on view, and no question could be raised as to the former's fitness. His coat shone like satin, and the handsome shape of the horse caused many post-bettors to invest in his favor. Camerine was also blooming, and his owner was somewhat sanguine as to his chance. Britisher, despite his reputation, was generally voted an underbred animal, though a horse of great size and turned out with T. Wilson's polish. Conjecture was another animal in splendid condition, but Sardius, Welcome Jack, and Prometheus were ali on the big side, and Anchorite was not within pounds of his form. Lantern looked none the worse for his Goodwood Handicap win, and his party were very sweet to the last. Other horses, however,_ attracted little attention, except from their own immediate partisans, though Anglesey, Hazard, and Plausible were looked upon as the most likely of the outside division to effect a coup. The mare Conjecture hardened to such an extent that she left the paddock at 3 to 1, Britisher being a point more, followed by Lantern at 5's, and then came Lord 'Wilton at 8's. Welcome Jack was strongly supported at 100's to 8. at which price Sardius was also backed. The prices of others varied from 15 to SO to 1, and as nearly every one was backed the books must have had -a good time of it. The raee, which is described m. detail below, resulted; in the victory of Lord WiltoDj .who was .followed home by Anchorite and Sardius. Tbe favorite, who was in front for a great part of the race, collapsed half a mile from home, while Britisher shot his bolt half-way down the straight, Lantern giving in just before that. MAIDEN PLATE. Capri, uy Yattendon— Mandragora, 9 St. (O'Crien) 1 Gonanna, S st. 7 lbs. (St. AJbans) ? 2 Hampstead, 6 st. 11 lbs. (Page) ? 3 Betting — 5 to i on Hampstead, 7 to 4 against Capri, 2 to 1 Gonanna. Hampstead jumped off with the lead, which he maintained to the abattoirs, where Gohanua ran up level with him. The latter had aslight advantage enter ing the straight, but Capri, who had been last from the fall of the nag, now came up and easily distanced the others when called upon, winning eventually by four lengths, Gohajina second two lengths ahead of the favorite.

Lantern had a slight lead as they went past the stand, Lord Wilton, Conjecture, Wel come Jack, Hazard, Camerine, Plausible, Anchorite, and Hobart being those who formed the leading division.

Conjecture was second, the others as they went along the river side, being Lord Wilton, Prometheus, Camerine, Hazard, Sardius, Britisher, Madcap, Welcome Jack, Anglesey, and Gohanna, with Grace Darling last.

Along the back of the course Conjecture led Prometheus, Lantern and Britisher occupjingthe best positions be hind her, while the top weight, Welcome Jack, was nearly last. As they passed the abattoirs Prometheus, Conjecture, Lantern, and Britisher were in the van, while Hazaid and Anchorite were gradually working to the' front Passing the sheds Lantern was again in command, with Prometheus, Britisher, and Anchorite close beh':nd him, the favorite having now been broughtback into the ruck. Coming round towards the straight Britisher came up on the outside, and led into the straight, with Lantern, Anchorite, and Lord Wilton as his nearest attendants. Lord Wilton gradually improved his position, and half way down the straight Britisher shot his bolt, and Lord Wilton assumed the lead, Anchorite with Sardius, who came out from the centre, close on him. The leader, however, finished like a racehorse, and succeeded in beating Anchorite by a length, while Sardius was a good third, onlybalfalengthbehmd,Plausiblewasfourth,thencanie Britisher, Lantern, Madcap, Grace Darling, Anglesey, Camerine, Gohanna, Welcome Jack, Conjecture, Hazard, and Ruby in order as written, with Prometheus last.
