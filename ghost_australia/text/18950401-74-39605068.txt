TAMAR-STREET CHURCH. The Rev. J. G. Wright preached special sermone yesterday to good congregations. The text selected for the morning was from Romans xv., 13-" Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost." Some pertinent rkmarks were made on the twofold blessing sought-joy and peace which were shown to be branches of the same tree. The Christians of to-day needed to possess these graces in full measure in order that their hope for larger blessings might be intensified; they must ever pay attutiun to the condition implied in believin g. in the evening Mr Wright discoursed upon ' Right living," basing an earnest and thoughtful address on Jer. xxxvii., 37. In simple but telling language he showed that right living im plied the possibility of holding intercourse with God and a firm decision to obey him. It meant holy living, aud holy living even to-day would make a man peculiar, but rightly to liVi. would be characterised by progressiveness, usefulness, and happiness. .Words of cheer were spoken to the Christian workers, and words of warning and exhortation to those who were unde cided to accept and follow Christ. The collections for the day were Â£22 12s Gd.
