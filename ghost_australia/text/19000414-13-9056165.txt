IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH. he futility of Hussein's signal to the lookout station on the hill was. due to the loyalty with which. Mark Telfer kept his pledged word to Joanna Under cover of the night he was rowed out to the Sea Hawk, and by means of old Bob Kent s cunning boat lore contrived to escape the vigilant eyes of the watch on deck But in skid of fixing the torpedo to the vessels bottom he allowed it to sink quietly to the bed of the lagoon, and omitted to couple the wires for the electric circuit -sow it was not the practice of Hussein Ala to prisoner tools which had served his purpose unless he was likely to want them for full re ust, and that was not so in Mark Telfer s case As a result of this peculiarity of Hussein's there was a lively experience in store for the diver on his return from his supposed successful expedition 1 he boil that took him out to the Sea Hawk and back was manned in addition to Kent, with a couple of native oarsmen Mark noticed on stepping on to the kind ing stage, that these two men. kept sus perilously close to him, and he was further insulted when one of them put his hands to his mouth and blew a low but pene triting whistle You It back to mind yourself, there is summit in the wind, w whispered old Kent '1 ran t of no sort of use You must shift for i our self His words were hardly spoken when, from the domed guard house, there came running half a dozen armed men, followed it a more leisurely pace by Hussein himself, fresh from his scene with Joanna in the tunnel, and accompanied by Mirza Khan, whom he had found at the landing place The two boatmen crowded round Marl more menacing.), as though only waiting the arrival of the approaching reinforcements to close in upon them The diver, scenting danger, took to his heels and ran without an) den idea of his destination He could at least put some distance between himself and his possible assailants till he was sure of their intentions The fact of his flight made that clear at once. The two boatmen, taken aback for a moment, started in pursuit, and the armed men from the guard house lim ried their price so as to head him off before he left the landing stage In this they were too late, and the whole pack broke into a threatening hue and cry as Mark settled down into a rush for the jungle that fringed the shore To reach it he had to pass the guard house, and as he approached it he saw by the light of a flickering oil lamp within that the place was deserted, all its occupants having quitted it at the postman's signal, to join in what had now become a chase Mark cast a glance over his shoulder He was screened by the first bushes of the jungle from his pursuers, and, acting on a sudden impulse, he darted into the building his intention being to he low till the) hail passed The very last place in which they would expect to find him would be in their own lair On rushing into the back, bench lined in tenor he gazed round for a hiding place, and his eyes fell upon a ) yawning gulf in the floor, alongside which a head) stone slab for it was the entrance to the tunnel from which Hussein had just emerged when the boatmen signal had given warning that the intended victim had landed, and there had been no time to replace the stone Mark H« that steps led down into the black abyss, and as the shouts of his pursuer-, were close at hand he i in down the steps so as to be out of sight when they passed the guard house But he had no sooner reached the slum floor of the sub xx ax than he heard voices above, and with a dull thud the great stone fell into pool tion, cutting off his chance of escape that way and also ex co glimmer of light from the lamp in the room above Mirza Khan, in rushing by towards the jungle, had noticed that the entrance to the tunnel had been left open, and and called to two of his followers to rectify the omission before continuing the chase alone in the ink black darkness, "XInrk for a few minutes abandoned himself to de span, but

that sort ' said Slink rather hurt ' I've been back to the end of the tunnel to see if I could lift the stone, but it was too heavy for me I could t even move the darned thing" for full half a minute no comment came from behind the door Could it have been that Joanna's motions were too much for her' Anxhoxx, Hine was a tremor in her voice when she said at last, "It's lucky yon couldn't move the stone The men in the guard room would certainly have killed you I daresay," replied Mark carelessly - he was still a little nettled at the charge of desertion- but I could have got on them the tip that you were boxed up down here last, you set, Miss ' Again there was a pause before the answer came, but when it did come it atoned for the delay), and caused the dive. a pang of shame for his business It also sent a thrill of something more than pride, yet less than triumph, coursing through his veins, for Mark, in happy ignorance that the sister of the "sultan considered herself an august personage, had conceived a simple hearted admiration at sight for the buxom brown girl on whom he had sat down an old Bob Kent's but You need not call me Miss," was the long delayed reply "You have tried to save my life at the expense of your own You may call me Joanna," ' With pleasure," responded Mark, restraining an inclination to attempt to dance a hornpipe on the uneven floor of the tunnel But Joanna hat am I to do to get you out of this' What is at the other end of the burrow ' Should I stand a better chance of breaking loose there' ' But Joanna had not made up her mind that she wanted him to break loose at either end of the subterranean passage She was certain that she wanted nothing of the kind unless it could be continued with out the diver falling into the hands of his enemies, and that seemed impossible ' The passage is closed at the other end by a stone as heavy as the other, and it opens into the heart of the palace You would be killed on sight without even a chance of explanation at that end, she said I wish that we could change places that you were here in the cave and that I was out in the tunnel ' "So do I," responded Mark, wondering at the same time it what sounded a rather selfish remark But her next words removed the impression You see," she went on, Then get a paper, signed by mi brother which, if I could only get it into the hands of one Mirza Khan, would prevent Hussein from further mischief If I was out in the tunnel, and could escape from it, as I think I could, I could make it all right for you as well as for myself " ' How would you escape from the tunnel' If you could, I can, if you will tell me how," Mark replied Now in Toannu s mind had been the signal knocks which it was imperative for those using the tunnel to give before the stone was raised, but, Desperate as was her case, she would not impart to him a knowledge which would send him to certain death It filled her with a new delight that the well favoured young white man had shown himself ready to face the risk on her behalf The name feeling prevented her from availing herself of it it would not Help me for you to got out, you would be cut down the moment you appeared," she replied For some minutes there was no more talk on either side of the iron door, but Mark is not idle during the interval An idea occurred to him, and be xx n down on his knees, evening first by the light of one of his few remaining matches, and then with sensitive fingers, the top, the sides, and the bottom of the door It fitted tightly, with not so much as a silt through which a postage stamps could have passed, but he observed that the ground at the foot, close to the iron framework, is somewhat worn presumably by the tread of persons passing in and out of the door When he stood upright again he thought he saw his way clear If I had that piper I could help you and myself too, if I could get out of the tunnel, he shouted through the door "You might," came the doubtful reply but, as I gave it in here, and there is no way of proving it to you, there is the use of thinking of the" But there is a xxiv," Mark cried excitedly 'The trend of the door is worn, and the rock is not very hard I cm scoop out a silt under the door big enough for you to pass the paper through It will take time, but it is better than doing no thing Without waiting for her reply he took out his clasp knife and set to work on the coral bed of the frame Progress was no certainly "slow in the day and at first he worked without a word of encouragement from the prisoner within 15ft after a while Joanna

and that she might see if she could slip the papel through, there was a new reason to weigh with the girl why she should crown his efforts with the chance of siness, or- she shuddered to think of it-of death at the hands of Hussein's following The lesson was an (ingrowing hunger and the pangs of tim st During the long hours of Mark's toil they had given as friendly as it was possible for a
