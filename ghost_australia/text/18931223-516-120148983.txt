The man who enters at the moment and stands just within the heavy Navn jo portiere, smilingly looking op at tiie group and quite conscious of tho almost vengeful glances in the eyes of the young girls, is a cavalry offi cer altout thirty-five years of age. He is a tall fellow, somewhat heavily huilr, yet well proportio-icd and athletic. His face is tanned by I oi if; exposure to the sun and wind of thn av1de''frontier. His lirown hair, close cropped, has a suspicion of gray just- silvering the temples. His i-yelirows aro thick and strong ly marked. The ryes beneath are deep set and fiingecl with heavy lushes. The mous tache, sweeping -from his upper lip, in of a. lighter drown than his hair, --ut equally thick, heavy and curling. Otherwise his fucu is smoothly shaved, and is one which inipreoios those who look upon it, even care lessly, as Siring and resolute, lie still wears the douMe- WaibXicoiit, with shiulder knots and fourragere.'jast as he had come off par tide, though he has exchungcil »j:'niet for for age cap, which latter head- gear'i»t this moment is being dandled in one hand, while the lingers of the oilier heat rapid tattoo Upon the visor. Gomrades of Holfe would tell you this is a sign that he is nervous ; yet to look at him there, smiling upon the group, quitp. as though remarking what a pretty pic ture they .nake, no one else would be apt to think of such a thing.

Winnie Berrien rushps from the parlor in to the paternal den^ 'voluble' with' 'protrsta-' t ions against such scandalous stories at mam ma's expense ; but Mrs. Berrien, flowly funning herself, remains calmly seated, as though impervious to these damagius shots, at which everybody else, is laughing merrily.

'Silence, Dick,' sternly murmurs Mrs. Berrien. 'There is no fun iu this aSair, and I warn you— not another word.' Twilight has fa'len upon the garrison as they stroll across thn parade.

Down at Jhe ^ate Cliu moonlight glinting on his polished sabre, the officer of the day is exchanging a few low tor.ed words words with Major Berrien. Rolfe, who with silent and dogged resolution lias taken his place at Miss Outlined side as «he came down the. stairs and escorted her to tiie doctor's, has turned from there and gone slowly across the parade to his own quarters on the other side. Every body seems to see uu-i know what has happened, and many half-whispered com ments are being made, not all iu sympathy wifh the willowed lover. Everybody re spects Rolfe, yet amongst the younger offi cers are several who feel no warmth of friend-, ship for hi-n, and as between man and man,* garrison girls- can only side, with the young-. steis. Their story of their slight differences is sometimes told again and again ; the elders' seldom, for th.-irs wuuld liirdly lie believed. Little by little the chut and laughter subside. ' Oh, why doesn't she come back I1' pouts Miss Berrien. ' The ambulnnces will be here iu less than half uu hour, nml we won't see anything of her.'
