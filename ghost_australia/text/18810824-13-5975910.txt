THE CONFESSION OF FAITH. We subjoin the concluding portion of the Westminster Confession of Faith With regard to Chapter Will , " or the Civil Magistrate," we believe that it is not fully accepted, without reservation, by the Presbyterian church of Victoria - CHAI- XXII -OF LAWFUL OATHS AND Vows I A lawful oath is a part of religious wor- ship, wherein upon just occasion the person swearing solemnly calleth God to witness what he asserted or promised and to judge him according to the truth or falsehood of what he swears II, The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear, and therein it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence ; there fore to swear family or rashly by that glorious and dreadful name, or to swear at all by any other thing, is awful and to be abhorred Yet as, in matters of weight and moment, an oath is warranted by the Word of God under the New Testament, as well as under the Old , so a lawful oath, being imposed by lawful authority, in such matters, ought to be taken, III A whosoever taketh an oath, ought duly to consider the weightiness of so solemn an act and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully persuaded is the 'truth. Neither will) any man bind himself by oath to any thing but what is good and just, and what he believeth so to be, and what he is able and resolved to perform Yet it is a sin to refuse an oath touching anything that is good and just being imposed by lawful authority. IV An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the words, without equivo- cation or mental reservation. It cannot oblige to sin , but in any thing not sinful, being taken, it binds to performance, although to a man s own hurt, nor is it to be violated, although made to heretics or infidels V A view is of the like nature with a pro- missory oath, and ought to be made with the like religious care, and to be performed with the same faithfulness, VI I do not to be made to any creature, but to God alone and that it may be accepted, it is to be made voluntarily, out of faith, and conscience of duty, in way of thankfulness for mercy received, or for the obtaining of what we want, whereby we more strictly bind ourselves to necessary duties, or to other things, so far and so long as they may stay conduce thereunto VII No man may vow to do anything for bidden in the Word of God or what would hinder any duty therein commanded, or which is not in his power, and for the performance whereof he hath no promise of ability from God In which respects Popish monastical vows of perpetual single life, pro fessed poverty, and regular obedience, are so far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are superstitious and sinful snares, in which no Christian may entangle himself CuAr XXIII -Or inn CIVIL MAGISTRATE I God, the supreme Lord and King of all the world, hath ordained civil magistrates to be under him over the people, for His own glory, and the public good and to this end hath armed them with the power of the sword for the defence and encouragement of them that are good, and for the punishment of evil doers II. It is lawful for Christians to accept and execute the office of a magistrate when called thereunto in the managing whereof, as they ought especially to maintain piety, justice, and peace, according to the whole some laws of each commonwealth, so, for that end, they may lawfully, now under the New Testament, wage war upon just and necessary occasions III The civil magistrate may not assume to himself the administration of the word and sacraments, or the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven yet he hath authority, and it is his duty, to take order, that unity and peace be preserved in the church, that the truth of God be kept pure and entire, that all blasphemies and heresies be suppressed, all corruptions and abuses in worship and discipline prevented or reformed, and all the ordinances of God duly settled, administered and observed for the better effecting whereof, hath power to call synods, to be present at them, and to provide that what soever is transacted in them be according to the mind of God IV It is the duty of people to pray for magistrates, to honour their persons, to pay them tribute and other dues to obey their lawful commands. and to be subject to their authority for conscience sake Infidelity, or difference in religion, doth not make void the magistrates just and legal authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to him from which ecclesiastical persons are not exempted, much less hath the Pope any power or jurisdiction over them in their dominions or over any of their people i and least of all to deprive them of their dominions or lives, if he shall judge them to be heretical, or upon any other pretence whatsoever CHAP XXIV-OF MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE Marriage is to be between one man and one woman neither is it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to have more than one husband, at the same time II Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue, and of the church with a holy seed and for preventing of uncleanness III It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry who are able with judgment to give their consent yet it is the duty of Christians to marry only in the Lord And therefore such as profess the true reformed religion should not marry with infidels, Papists, or other idolators neither should such as are godly be unequally yoked, by marrying with such as are notoriously wicked in their life, or maintain damnable heresies IN Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity forbidden in the word , nor can such incestuous marriages ever be made lawful by any law of man or consent of parties so as those persons may live together as man and wife The man may not marry any of his wife 's kindred nearer in blood than he may of his own, nor the woman of her husband 's kindred nearer in blood than of her own V Adultery or fornication committed after a contract, being detected before marriage, giveth just occasion to the innocent party to dissolve that contract In the case of adultery after marriage it'S lawful for the innocent party to sue out a divorce, and after the divorce, to marry another, as if the offending party were dead I VI Although the corruption of man be such as is apt to study arguments, unduly to put asunder those whom God hath joined together in marriage, yet nothing but adultery, or such wilful desertion as can no way be remedied by the church or civil magistrate, is cause sufficient of dissolving the bond of marriage wherein a public and orderly course of proceeding is to be observed, and the persons concerned in it not left to their own wills and discretion in their own case CHAP XXV -OF THE Cnoncn The catholic or universal church, which is invisible, consists of the whole number of the elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the head thereof and is the spouse, the body, the full ness of Him that filleth all in all. II The visible church, which is also catholic or universal under the Gospel (not confined to one nation, as before under the law) consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion, together with their children, and is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God, out of which there is no ordinary possibility of salvation III Unto this catholic visible church Christ hath given the ministry, oracles, and ordinances of God, for the gathering and perfect ing of the saints in this life, to the end of the world and death by his own presence and Spirit according to His promise, make them effectual thereunto IN This catholic church hath been sometimes more, sometimes less visible And particular churches, which are members thereof, are more or less pure, according as the doctrine of the gospel is taught and embraced, ordinances administered, and public worship performed more or less purely in them V The purest churches under heaven are subject both to mixture and error, and some have so degenerated as to become no churches of Christ, but synagogues of Satan Never whereas, there shall be always a church on earth to worship God according to His will. VI There is no other Head of the church but the Lord Jesus Christ nor can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof, but is that anti-christ, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth himself in the church against Christ, and all that is called God Cmr XXVI-OF COMMUNION or SVIHTS I All saints that are invited to Jesus Christ their head by His Spirit, and by faith, have fellowship with Him in His graces, sufferings death, resurrection, and glory And being united to one another in love, they have communion in each others gifts and graces, and are obliged to the performance of such duties, public and private, as do con- duce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man II Saints, by profession, are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification, as also in relieving each other in outward things, according to their several abilities and necessities Which communion, as God offered opportunity, is to be extended unto all those who in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus. III This communion which the saints have with Christ does not make them in any wise partakers of the substance of His God head, or to be equal with Christ in any respect either of which to affirm is impious and blasphemous Nor both their corn women one with another as saints take away or infringe the title or property which each man hath in his goods and possessions CHAI XXVII -OF THE SACRAMENT I Sacraments are holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace immediately institute 1 by God, to represent Christ and His benefits, and to confirm our interest in him , as also to put a visible difference between those that belong unto the church and the rest of the world, and solemnly to engage them to the service of God in Christ, according to His word II There is in every sacrament a Bpintnil relation, or sacramental!union, between the sin and the thing signified, whence it comes to pass, that the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other III The grace which is exhibited in or by the Sacraments, rightly used is not conferred by any power in them ; neither doth the off each of ft earramept depend upon the piety or intention of him that both administer it, but upon the work of the Spirit, and the wind UL institution which contains, together with a precept authorising the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers IV There be only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the Gospel-that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, neither of which may be dispensed by any but by a minister of the word, lawfully or darned V. The sacraments of the Old Testament, in regard of the spiritual things thereby signified and exhibited, were, for substance, the same with those of the New. CHAP, XXVIII -Or BAPTISM. I Baptism is a sacrament of the Natives- I ament, ordained by Jesus Christ, not only for the solemn admission of the party baptized into the visible church, but also to be unto him a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, of his ingrafting into Christ, of re- generation, of remission of sins and of his giving up unto God through Jesus Christ to walk in newness of life which sacrament is, by Christ a own appointment, to be continued in His Church until the end of the world II The outward element to be used in this sacrament is water, wherewith the party is to be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by a minister of the Gospel, lawfully called there unto III Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary, but baptism is rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person IV. Not only those that do actually profess faith in and obedience unto Christ, but also the infants of one or both believing parents are to be baptised V. Although it be a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance, yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as that no person can be regenerated or saved without it, or that all that are baptised are undoubtedly regenerated VI The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it is administered , yet notwithstanding, by the right use of this ordinance, the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited and conferred by the Holy Ghost to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the council n -A- 2 own vii..,." HIB appointed time VII -The sacrament of baptism is but once to be administered to any person CHAP XXIX -OF THE LORD S SUPPER I Our Lord Jesus, in the night wherein He was betrayed, instituted the sacrament of His body and blood, called the Lord a Supper to be observed in his church unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of Himself in His death, the sealing all benefits thereof unto true be Severe, their spiritual nourishment and growth in Him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they one unto Him, and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with Him, and with each other as members of his mystical body li In this sacrament Christ is not offered up to his father nor any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sins of the quick or dead, but only a commemoration of that one offering up of Himself, by himself, upon the cross, once for all, and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same, so that the Popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it is most abominably injurious to Christ a one only sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sins of the elect III 'The Lord Jesus bath in this Aramanda appointed his ministers to declare His word of institution to the people, to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to a holy use and to take and break the bread, to take the cup and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to the coming means, but to none who are not then present in the congregation IN Private masses or receiving this sacrament by a priest or any other alone , as like wise the denial of the cup to the people, worshipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended religious use are all contrary to the nature of this sacrament, and to the institution of Christ V The outward elements in this sacrament duly set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that truly, jet Bacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of Christ, albeit in substance and nature they still remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were before VI That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and wine into the substance of Christ a body and blood (commonly called transubstantiation) by consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant not to Scripture alone, but even to common sense and reason , overthroweth the nature of the sacrament and hath been and is the cause of manifold superstitions, yea of gross idolatrous VII Worthy receivers outwardly partaking of the visible elements in this Sacrament, do then also inwardly by faith, really and in deed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed upon Christ crucified, and all benefits of His death the body and blood of Christ being then not cor- porally or carnally in, with, or under the bread and wine , yet as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in. that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses VIII Although ignorant and wicked men receive the outward elements in this sacrament yet they receive not the thing signified thereby, but by their unworthy coming thereunto are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, to their own damnation Wherefore all ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Him, SO are they unworthy of the Lord a table, and cannot, without great But against Christ, while they remain much, partake of these holy myBtenea, or be admitted there unto Cmr XXX OF Cnuittn CENSURES The Lord Jesus, as king and head of his church, hath therein appointed a government in the hand of church officers, distinct from the civil magistrate II. To these officers the keys of the kingdom of heaven are committed, by virtue whereof they have power respectively to retain and remit Bins, to shut that kingdom against the impenitent, both by the word and censures, and to open it unto penitent sinners, by the ministry of the gospel, and by absolution from censures, as occasion shall require III Church censures are necessary for the reclaiming and gaining of offending brethren, or deterring of others from the bice offences , or purging out of that leaven which might affect the whole lump, for vindicating the honour of Christ, and the holy profession of the Gospel, and for preventing the wrath of God, which might justly fall upon the church, if they should suffer his covenant, and the seals thereof, to be profaned by notorious and obstinate offenders IV. for the better attaining of these ends, the officers of the church are to proceed by admonition, suspension from the sacrament of the Lord's Supper for a season, and by excommunication from the church, according to the nature of the crime and demerit of the person CHAP XXXI -Or SYNODS AND COUNCILS I For the better government and further edification of the church, there ought to be such assemblies as are commonly called synods or councils II As magistrates may lawfully call a synod of ministers and other fit persons, to consult and advise with about matters of religion, so if magistrates be open enemies to the church, the ministers of Christ, of themselves, by virtue of their office, or they, with other fit persons upon delegation from their churches, may meet together in such assemblies III It belongeth to synods and councils ministerially to determine controversies of faith, and cases of conscience to set down rules and directions for the better ordering of the public worship of God, and government of the church to receive complaints in cases of mal administration, and authoritatively to determine the same which decrees and determinations if consonant to the word of God, are to be received with reverence and submission, not only for their agreement with the word, but also for the power whereby they are made, as being an ordinance of God, appointed thereunto in His word. IV. All synods or councils since the apostles times. whether general or particular, may err, and many have erred ; therefore they are not to be made the rule of faith or practice, but to be used as an help in both. V. Ss novels and councils are to handle or conclude nothing but that which is eccle Siastical, and are not to intermeddle with civil affairs, which concern the common- wealth, unless by way of humble petition, in cases extraordinary , or by way of advice for satisfaction of conscience, if they be thereunto required by the civil magistrate. CiiAr XXXII -OF THE STATE or MEN AFTER DEATH, AND of all, RESURRECTION 01 mt DEAD. The bodies of men after death return to dust, and see corruption , but their souls (which neither she nor Sleep), having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them. The souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holi- ness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies and the souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in tor- ments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day. Besides these two places for souls separated from their bodies, the scripture acknowledged none. li At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed, and all the dead shall be raised up with the self same bodies, and none other, although with different qualities. which shall be united again to their souls for ever III. The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonour , the bodies of the just by His Spirit, unto honour, and be made conformable to His own glorious body. CHAP. XXXIII. OP THE LAST JUDGMENT. I God hath appointed a day wherein he will Judge the world in righteousness by Jesus Christ, to whom all power and judgment is given of the rather. In which day, not only the apostate angels shall be judged, but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give on account of their thoughts, words, and deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil. II. The end of God's appointing this day is for the manifestation of the glory of His mercy in the eternal salvation of the elect, and of his justice in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient For then shall the righteous go into everlast- ing life, and receive that fulness of joy and refreshing which shall come from the pre- sense of the Lord , but the wicked, who know not God, and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. III. As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity , so will He have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour Hw Lord will come, and may be ever prepared to say, Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly. Amen.
