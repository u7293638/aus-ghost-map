A MATCH FOE A Q.DEKN.-After Sir Paul Methuen had quitted court, Queen Caroline, who thought she had a talent for joking, frequently saw him when she dined'in company, during the kufs absence in Hanover. Once, when she dined with Lady Walpole, at Chelsea, Sir Paul was there as usual. People who pUy off their wit upon others generally hurp upon the same string. The Queens oonetanfc topic for teasing Sir Paul was his passion for rofflanoes, and he was weary of it, and not in good humour with her. "Well, Sir Paul," said the Queen, "what romanoee are you reading now f " None, madama ; I have gone through them alL" "Well, what are you. reading, then f" " I have got into a very foolish study, mad&me-the; history of the Kings sad Qaeeai of Eng land."

Cbogses of the new Order of the Grown of Italy have been freely given away on the occasion of the late royal marriage. Some of the recipients are not considered worthy of the decorations, and an Italian journalist has given his opinion of them in an epigram, which one of our contemporaries has Eng lished thus: In barbarous times, with careless toss, Men hung the thieves upon the cross; In gentler times, with '. by yoor leaves," Wen hang a cross upon the thieves. The Italian Government has shown, that it feels the point of the epigram, by seqnestratiug tlie journal in which it appeared.-.'fetar."

A lady was reading to her fere-year-old. boy, the story of a little fellow whose father was taken ill and died, after which the youngster set himself' diligently 10 work to assist in supporting himself and his mother. When she had finished the story, she said "Row, Tomm>, if pa were to die, wouldn't you work to help mamma?" "Why, ma," said tie little fellow, not relishing the idea of work, "what for? Ain't we got a good house to live in?" " Oh yet, my child," said the mother; *' but ue can't eat the house, you know."' " Well, ain't we got plenty of thing* in the pantry said tlie young hopeful. " Certainly, my dear," replied tlie mother; "but they will not last long-and what "then V " Well, ma," said the little incorrigible, "ain't there enough to last till you get, another husband ?"

ACCOBDIKG to the Atlantic Monthly, " Men say, in reply to those who object to their clubs, their men's oinner parties, and tbeir smoking rooms: 'Women overwhelm society with superfluous dry goods. The moment ladies are invited, the whole affair becomes a mere question of oottume. A party at which ladles assist is little more than ah exhibition of wearing apparel, They dress, too.-not for ;t tie pur- . pose of giving pleasure to men, but for the purpose of inflicting pain on one another. Besides, a lady who is carrying a considerable e»tate-upou lier pereou, must devote a great part of her attention to the management of that estate. She may be talkiug to Mr. Smith about Shaki*peare and the musical-glasses, but the thing her mind is really bent upon is crushing Mrs. Smith with her new lace. Even dancing is nothing but an exceedingly laborious and anxious wielding of yards of silk trailing out behind!'" &c.; A LONG COURTSHIP.-A marriage has been solemnised at Hark between ^sn old gentleman (a widower) of eighty and a widow of seventy-eight The circumstances are very peculiar. In 1812, the old lady now married gave birth to a daughter. At that time her present lrusband promised her marriage. About the yean ISIS she gave birth to two more daughter*, and an action was then oommenoed for breach of pro mise, and resulted in defendant's being imprisoned in Ilcbester gaol for several' months. At length the 1 matter was compromised. After this the two parties separated, married, each having a large family, who are all living in foreign countries and doing well. About nine years j^o they became widowand widower, and from that time up to the present the latter has been paying his constant addresses to the former, and at last he liaa made hor lus happy partner in life after a courtship ("off and on") of over £ixty years.-" "Srfctol Times."
