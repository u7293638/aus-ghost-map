Selected Poetxy. LEFT UNDONE; It i«n't the thing to do, dear ; It's the thing you've left undone Which ^ives you a bit of headache ' ? At the setting oF the sun— The tender word forgotten, ^ The letter you «1M not write. The flower you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. Th* stone you rafght have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of heflrtsome counsel You were hurried too much to say, The lovin? touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That you had no time or thought for With troubles enough of your ©wh. The little act of kindness, So easily out of mind ; . Those chances to be angels ' Which all we mortals find ; They come in night and silence — Each chill, reproachful wraith — When hope is faint and flagging And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, Ami sorrow is all too great To suffer our 6low compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undo ne Which gives you the bit of headache At the setting of the sun.
