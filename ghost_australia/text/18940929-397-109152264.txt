REMARKABLE RELIGION. A Russian journal deacribes a peculiar religious movement ia tbe winter of 1891-2 in the province of Kiev. The originator was a Russian, given to drink until the age of forty years, when he re formed and joined the Stundiate, following zealously tbe religious rites of the sect, and often going into a condition of ecstasy. A few years later he began to suffer from hallucinations, amSng others "perceiving pleasant perfumes, which he declared to be tbe smell of tbe Holy Ghost. Then he conceived that he was possessed of the Holy Ghost, and that he wasJVsus Christ. He obtained namerons peasant followers, who sold their possessions, gave up work, and looked upon their insane leader as the Saviour of the world, in which there should soon be new regulations ; uo one should die, and no one should have need to work or to care for tho future, for God would care for them all. Most of them suffered from hallucinations of the sense of smell, perceiving extremely agreeable odours, which they described as pertaining to God and Heaven. Many had a feeling of remarkable bodily lightness, as if floating in the air, and many others were taken with convulsions, manifestly hysterical. The congregations were always noisy and excited, some falling to tbe earth, others jumping, striking them selves on the brest, end shouting inarticu lately. Some would imitate conversation; but it conaisted of incomprehensible, sense less sounds, which they believed to be a language spoken somewhere. Most of them were emaciated and anemic. Tbe epidemic was finally overcome by the authorities ; those that were most insane being shut up in asylum, while the hysterical were sent to* hospitals and convents.
