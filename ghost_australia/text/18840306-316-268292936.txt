Bowdyism, blasphemy, drunkenness, continual fightB, formed the staple of- the devil's loafers, and general riff-rajfihat-waa ever seen on any diggings was that assembled at the start of Fiery Creek. Of coarse there were plenty of quiet, respectable! hardworking men there too. and ihey, with the aid of the police, and of pnbhc opinion (for there was suck a thing aspublicopiEioa «veo there) kept, at least, a semblance of order, although the roughs tried very hard to "rule with the right of might. \ - "There was one great slab-sided, powerful lellow, a Yankee, who with his mate, a halting brute from the Sydney Bide, was the terror of the camp. -He was an unmitigated bully and a, tluef to boot, as after events showed, and was never sohappy as when he was picking a quarrelwith some inoffensive man -who: was not his match in strength or brutality. He tried it on with me once; but I hadn't sparred in i the ring at nine years old for nothing, and before he well knew where he was, he was en his back in the creek with a gashed cheek, asplit nose, and two broken ribs. His mate didn't make any remarks, but got faia away to their tent Very quietly. He was,-laid np for three weeks, and it was wondertal. hov?meek he was after that. " Well, we . remained on the creek fonr months altogether, and we - did exceedingly well In fact, we were all noh man. Most of onr gold we had -sent away by the escort, but at last the wandering fit seized lis, and •yve determined to start for Melbourne, and see a little life. We had with os something like five hundred ounces of gold, and we knew perfectly well how dangerous it would be to carry it with us, and yet we wanted, if we could, to save the escort: duty. And now came one of the most curious things I ever , heard or knew of, a thing which, if I didn't know to be true, I could hardly believe. Jack Payne, who was a carpenter by trade, took the box off the dray, and on the top of the axle-bed or part of the shaft under the box, hang me if lie didn't cut . a groove, and m it placed the gold wrapped up in a chamois leather like a sausage, closing up the hole with a piece of wood BO cleverly cut as not to allow the joint to be seen. The wheels were then taken off 'for a blind,'as he said, and oiled, and the entire affair bolted together again. " Clever, wasn't it? Oh, yes, wonderfully clever! Bat you shall hean - We left Fiery Creek, and being a strongiBh party, and, moreover, being known toio well armed, were never molested, although hardly a day passed without small parties, or solitary travellers, being stuck up, and robbed or maltreated. In due course we got to the Keilor Flams, and camped one night on the Ttoolem Creek. We had finished tea,, and were Bitting yarning round the fire, when we were aware of two men coming towards us. "' Good evening, mates,"said one of thens- "' Good evening.' '"Going up or down.' '"Just come down, find hound for Melbourne,' said I. "' We've jnst made astart from Melbourne,' said the newcomer,'and intended to camp on this creek, but the wheel -of onr dray broke down hall a mile down the road, and seeing vour fire, we came to see who yen were. We've left onr mates with the dray-' Broke down are you, that's a pity.' *•' Well yes, it is a pity. We shall have to take the wheel back over four miles, and it's the loss of time we're thinking about ' " 'We've got a nice little dray here,' I said 1 we don't particularly want it; and we might make a deal if you like, for time is no particular object to us. 1 " Well the long and short of it was that we did make a make a deal the next day. We exchanged drays, we receiving twenty pounds to boot and taking the broken dray; not a lad bargain we thought, althought ours -was a better one though not so big as theirs had ever been. " In the course of conversation they told us that they were not bound lor any particular place, and asked us if we could lay them on to a good spot, and we informed them where we had just come from; that we had done well, and advised them to fay it. and to take a particular direction if they could not finda spot on the flat itself.- And EO we parted, they towards Ballarat, we to Melbonrne- " Now I never waspartjcularly enamoured of digging hie, and as I had determined to remain in Melbourne, and had a pretty round Bum of money, least about me, and at last determined to become a honiface; I found a good hotel in the market, situated opposite the wharf,andtherel weat mto business- It was not what you'd call afirst class house, my and diggers arriving by the steamers -. still it paid, and paid well. " In dnepourse, and when they had had their spin, my four mates came to me, having lodged a certain amount of their money in my hands, for a general squaring up, as they thought of making a fresh start: .. "'I wonder how those chajpg are doing we sold our dray to?' I said, in the course of general conversation. "•DrayJ' exclaimed Jack Payne, jumping up, and Ins face turning -white as a sheet- ' Oh Lord 1' '" What's the matter,* said we surprised. "'Matter,' he gasped, 'why don't yon remember the five hundred -ounces -we hid in the axle bed.' "We stared at one another as "if we had collectively seen a ghost. Strange,-almost incredible to relate, not one of us had ever thought about it nntil that instant- Howwe could possibly have forgottoa it, I know not, but we had. There was no mistake about that. Xt was gone,- five hundred ounces; say two thousand pounds in round numbers, four nundred pounds a man, and all wehadgot was twenty pounds, and a dray with a patched wheel. Beerimmationwasoutofthequesfcion, because we were all equBlly io blame- There was no use in crying over spilled milk; so with aregretful sigh, we wiped it oii the slate '•"'"' "And now, knowing as yon do, the stateof Victoria at that time, comes the still mors incredible part of the story. " My Jour mates started upiiendigo way, I preferring to remain m Melbonrne, bat being a sleeping partner in the concern. I didn't see them again- &r; nearly, twelve months, and when I did fhey staggered me a little.' They drove down in . the evening one aay, and didn'tsay mutSi that night about what ihey had been" doing, although I could not help remarking that they kept chuckling and laughing, as if soma great joke were under way. "Nextday we were till up early, and Jack Payne and Bill Thomas askedme to step into the yard and look at the new horse and dray. • • " .•• . -"-- v" J Why that,'Texclaimed, *. is no new horse, surely It's old Boxer, isn't it? 1 " The dray, although onedray fe >eo much' like another, seemed strangely -familiar, and I said, <}ood lieavenB l ™u -don*t meanto aay that you've got the disy bBck, and the—' "" They broke unto a burst of laughter, and BS1 Thomas explained in tins wise : „ " • Of course when we left here"we'd tieyer no hopes of every seeing either dray or gold again, and hadgivenitupjorabad.job." We warn't doing much either, and had been! knocking about Bendigo, Kangaroo Mak Eaglehawk, and soon, till we got tifed. 80 atlast Tve started fer the MclToK'The'seoOnd day butcher's for.some meat, when. what should I eee, tipped up close to a hole, >hut a dray that I thought Ireeogmsed somehow, although it a i smothered up.inyellowolay» f -®ays2tD 5 Jack; -here; * bothered if I don'ii'Hiink 7 that'e ; the vety dray as we want.' ^ Nonsense,' sayshe 'Rcnsense or true cense,' -Bays lr <Tm jigger'd if i don't believe it is.' 1 Well,' tnji he, 4 that's easily found out; If youthink so, go up and find out who's got at, and: where they got it.'
