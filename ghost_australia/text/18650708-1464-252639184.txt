BRUTUS AND THE GHOST Brutus . — Mr. Smart. Boy. — Mr. Wells, his Accountant. Ghost. — Mr. Eagar. Smart. — Bear with, me, Wells, I'm dreadfully forgetful, Can you hold up your heavy head awhile And sing a song or two ? Wells. — Ay, my lord, an' it please you. Smart. It does, good Wells : I m sorry so to trouble you. Wells. — Pray don't mention it. Smart. — I shall not work a willing horse too hard ; I know you like to take it easy. Wells. — I've had my nap already, Sir. Smart. — That's right ; you shall have another ; I won't detain you long : — if I remain in office, I'll make you Under Secretary. Wells sings. Hey diddle diddle Felis et fidicen, Vaeea transiluit lunam : Caniculus risit Talem ludum videre, Et patina cum cochleare aufugit. Smart. — Wot a sleepy tune ! — God bless me, Here's Wells gone fast asleep ! Good night, old fellow. Let me see. Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading in the Stamp Act ? Ah, here it is. &7s down. Enter the Ghost of Geoff. Eagar. How the gas stinks ! I must send a requisition For some colonial kerosene. Hullo ! who's this ? I think it is the beer I took at lunch, That shapes this monstrous boguey ! It comes upon me — Hullo, I say, keep off! Or with this massive ruler will I break Thy unsubstantial head ! Messenger ! Screams loudly , He comes not, and I am left alone To fight it out. I'll try to soap him down With smooth and honey'd sentences. Good Geoff. What are you up to now ? Can't you sleep well ? — What can I do for you, old fellow ? He bears a look of mischief in his eye That makes me funk. Speak, good Geoff. Say what you are. Geoff. — Your evil genius, Smart. Smart. You don't say so ! I thought I did not need one. Did you come To tell me that ? Geoff. — I came to tell you, Smart, You'll see me in the House next Session. Smart. — Gammon! the odds are against you, And Love, your old Robertson colleague, Will win the day. Geoff. — Bet vou ten to one he don't ! Smart. — Done ! ! ! Ghost vamoozes.
