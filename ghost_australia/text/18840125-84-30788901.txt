'WVhat was 'that noise?' t!"e steward asked suddenly, in the pause after a deafening peal. 'It sounded like the fall of a house.' 'Per Bacco-it was the tower!' one of the men exclaimed:.,' I thought the old owl's nest would, be downi some stormy night.'

W-With a hoarse inasiticulate cry hi broke from his com panions, and rushed up the steep road and across the slope to the spot where the tower had stood.; A great' formilless heap of ruin,'from which the duist was~ rising in clouds, was all,that remained of the sturdy-old building which' had resis. ted the shock- of" centuries. Hlie ran 'hither: and thither' distractedly. calling, :. Angelo-Teresa'', . But there was ' no voice, nor any that replied.'
