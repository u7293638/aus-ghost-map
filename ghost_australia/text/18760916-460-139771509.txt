UK BUM G. BY T. B. ALDBICH. (FBOM TBS ATLAKTIC MONTHLY.) As sweet u the b'eath that goes From the lips of the white rose, As weird a* Uie elfin lights That glimmer of frosty nights, As wild ss the winds that tear Tbe curled red leaf is the sir. Is the song 1 have never sung. In slumber a hundred times I've 8Ud the eBshsnted Thymes, Bnt ere I open my eyse This ghost of a poem Bies; Of the interfluent strains Not even a note remains; I know by my pulse's beat It wm something wild and sweet, ' And my heart is strangely stirred. I strive, bnt I strive in vain, To recall the lost refrain, On same miraculoas day Perhaps it will come and stay; In some unimagined spring I may find my voice and sing Tbe song I have never sung.
