IKGLEWOOD. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Monday. '.!7th July. A great improvement has been commenced in the State shool reserve by planting trees, mostly pines of a hardy variety. The money to do thi3 has been subscribed by the residents, and in a few years the rather naked look of the building will bo hidden by a pretty grove of trees all around. 'l'ho ghost scare has como to a termination after some mischief has been done. As a resident and hi9 wife were walking down the Tarnagulla road lately after dark the monster came out from the scrub attired in_ white, the lady fainted, but her com panion seized and threw the apparition violently on the ground, giving the intruder a few hearty cuffs, and unfortunately letting him go with puuishment all too light. As the name of the young man is freely mentioned, it is to lie hoped he will be made to answer for his performance at the local police court, that is if there is any law to punish ghosts.
