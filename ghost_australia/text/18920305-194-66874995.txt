oL~~~ f Tr~varro~k By Msrs. OLIPHANT. CHAPTER I. THIE MYSTERIOUS SThxarS. A tafl, siiflzt g1rL stood bcforc tlicit A sultry noon in August. The hot at-. mosphere seemed to quiver against the distant, low, dark hills; the small bro6k rmn ]anguidly through the dry, parched meadow--reduced to a mere thread., Not a soul was to be seen in the one narrow street, which is the whole of the sleepy lIttle Cornish illage of Trevarroclk. 'Yes -one old woman was hanging out a l hermnans red shirt to dry on the gray stone wall before her cottage; a tabby cat sat at the gate, purring luxuriously in the sun. The stranger, who had just crossed the" rough bridge, looked round him curious ly. He was a tall, stalwart mau: lean, loose limbed, with a powerful rather than landsome face, clean shaven, show ing a firn, somewhat stern mouth, and having a pair of deep set, blue gray eyes, which seemed to take in everything at a glance. He2niglht have been almost any age between thirty and 'forty, and his .crisply curling black hair was streaked - with silver at the temples. "Is this a city of the- dead?'- he said, addressing the old woman, who looked at him with curiosity-strangers were very rarely seen in Trev arock. "You seem td be all asleep down here," he con tinued, with a- lnugli, "or to be taking things very easily." "You're not from hereabouts. I reck on," said the woman, sailing in return, "or you'd lkmow that all the men are at thepilchard fishing, and the women and childrenl be mostly all down to the bay, to see the boats come in. Look 'es yon der." She-lifted her brown hand and and pointed towards the sea. and Harold Carrington, fbllowing its direction, sawv on the broad, blue waters that lay under the horizon's rim a cluster of boats drifting land ward. "This is only a fishing village, theni There is ncinn where I could get a lodg ing'"..?Heflgoked. somewhat, dismayed. down the tiny lane of houses. "No, tlisitthere bain't. Old Ben Tre bilco down yont"-designating.acottage, more dirty and klilapidate'd than its netghbors-"sells a drap of beer and sour cider, but he don't take in .no lodgers," answered the old woman.'in her soft. slow Cornish drawl. "Is there no general shop, or postoffice here Greateaheavens! whataplace!" the stranger muttered, with ill concealed im patience. "Oh, iss-1 be the postmistress, and ] keeps a morsel o' tea and sugar, and the like inside." -glass bottle of red and white striped sugar sticks, and two moldy oranges in the cottage window bore out old Judith Penale s words. "Well, then, I must trudge back to Penzance to-night-there's no help for it. And yet I should have been well content to stay here; it is just the sort of place that would have suited me. One could be perfectly hidden from the eyes of the world in such an out of the way spot." A light" step liehind hin made him suddenly look round. Judith, who was standing odi the threshold of her door, dropped-a courtesy, and her withered face lighited up. A tall, slight girl stood before them, a rush basket on her arm. The color came into.M-r. Carrington's face. He lhad seen many beautiful women in the course of his strange, eventful life, but none so beautiful as this one, who wore her shabby blue serge gown, withits patched elbows, and sui burned straw sailor hat as ,n empress might have worn ler royal robes and crown. She was no village Dulcinea or rustic red cheeked Queen of the 3May. No bloom graced the rounded outline of her face; but a rich, creamy pallor, pure as the heart of awhite rose, contrasted viv idly with a pair of glorious brown eyes, and the thick, dark hair lying in great lusterless waves above a brow low as that of Clytie. The mouth was perhaps a trifle sad and cynical in expression for one so young, the lips somewhat thin -: and compressed: But Harold Carring tonsaw 'no flaw in her -almost perfect loveliness. Involuntarily he raised his sott, gray s-ideawake, opening the gate for this apparition of beauty to pass through. - But Judith Penale stopped the girl, saying, as though struck by a brilliant idea: "Why, dearie, maybe your'n the -'ery one cit help us." She poured out Harold Carrington's di~lculties, in spite of his gestures of dis approval, while the strange young lady gravely listened. "it is quite. true, what Judith says, taat ao lodging is to be had in the vil Iago. But if you like to wait here for :i short time, I- will go and, speak to my auit,,Mirs. Trevylian. Perhaps she may be,ablo to think of some plan." The girl raised her large, da.rk eyes. and looked ?harold full in the face a: she spoke- They-:were strange eyes; deep. l!uid and unfathomable, but there was nm-trace of shyness in their 'steady gaze.. Er mmanner was calm and self possessesd. alm6st'tco much en for oiie so- young. he thought. "I am infinitely obliged to you; but I 'c am more than as.hamedto give such trouble,'" he said; bowing courteously. 1 "Can I not come with yon. and so save I you the return hither?' he added, apol ogetically. "Oh, no: please wait here, if you don't I mind," she respond:ld. quickly. "No let ters for us. Judith? Well, then I will be 1 off." With light and springy steps she cross ed the bridge and was soon lost to sight. , Harold's eager questioninig was antici pated by old Judith. who dearly loved n gossip. "That's Miss Olive St. Maur, as hand- 1 some a young leddy as ever stepped, to my thinking. Her aunt, Mrs. Trevelyian, lives yont," poiinting to a small white house, lying close" to . fir'plantation in the distance. "Miss Olive lives along o' she anid M"iss Madge, tl:t's Mrs. Tre-: elyian's daughter. I've heer'd tell Miss Olive's pa got rilled out to' the Injies, and her ma, pore young thing, died of grief or'summat, anyway. Miss Olive- 1 she warn't but a chiel then--came home to live with her aunt, who took to her and didfor hir the same as her otnn.a Sc she ,iad Miss Madge ird lilke sisters ,,ind share and share alike, though, poor souls,' there- nin't much for any on "n I'm m afeard. But Mrs. Trevelyian's a good. kind lady as ever -i:ais." "Is she a widow?" -Harold felt strange ly interested in old. Judith's garrulous chatter. -.... "YIes, chiel," using the quaint Cornish ] mode of address to man;?womnnor clild. "She's been a widow this long:while. Mr. Trevelyila, her lmsbhand, was passon ,downto St. Osyth's. He was a poor, sickly sort o' chap, mostly awandering I about with his book larning and the like; 1 he died -hen Mies Madge_ was i' baby, I afore Miss Olive came to 'en.. .Mrs. Trevelyiai's father wor a kind o'.gentle man fanner, and lived here at 'revar- I rock; but what wi' the land beihg poor. and his fooling away a lot o' money, thinking there was tin on it, he died 1 wi'out a brass farden, except the cottage i yont. That he left to Mrs. Trevelyian. Miss Olive's ma being dead. So when Passon Trevelyian died she was glad enoi to comenic and live in it; for folks say she ain't got more than'll keep body and soul together. Lor' bless you, chiel! Ive known them, root -and branch, these years and years. They were among the head folks about here once, but noa they'm decayed gentry. There be plenty such in Cornwall-ruined by the mines anul the badness o' the land" "Hush!" Harold lifted a warning. finger, but as Olive St. Maur came up the narrow garden path the ghost of a smile flickering i:t the corners of her miiouth told him that she guessed the- subject of. Judith's conversation. "My aunt, Mrs. Trevylian, says that if you do not mindhlinited accommniodation and very plain fare," with a rathelr p:hin ful blush, "sel will be glad to take you in herself. We do not usually let lodg ings, as- Judith can tell you, but--but why, after all. mince the truth? We are poor, and glad of the chance of earning .money. 1 Think what you will of my can dor, noiw you- have the facts, pure and simple." - There was a passionaten reckleissnes i about the last words which gave, Harold s a sensation almost of pain: â€¢. r Old Judith had gone into her little " shop to serve two bronzed .urchins with yellow saffron cakes. "Believe me or not, as you please, I e honor you from my heart for your frank e ness," he replied earnestly. "I, too, am a poor man; and though I have never been glad of it before, I shall be now, if I it gives me a greater chance of becoming e your friend." The two were walking up the heather d covered hill, side by side. Harold Cart. n rington felt a slight twinge of conscience h as he spoke; but, after all, was lie not poor-unspeakably, wretchedly so in 0 life's best gifts? . What was money tc I. one alone in the world--popularity, even It fame-if there was no heart to beat in e unison with his, no eye to brighten at d his joys or shed a tear for his sorrows. e Yes; hlie was poorer in these thiri;s than the miner who passed him and Olive just n then on his way home from his work, Ls and whose chubby children were scram r, bling up the hillside to meet him with e shouts of welcome. "Are you poor, too? -1 am glad of it, a though you may think me selfish. Ihate e the rich--hate them because I envy them n more than words can say. Why are if life's fairest things so unequally di a vided?" she went on, with sudden anger. ;r "It is a bitter, cruel shame." d Olive St. Maur's dark eyes flashed fire, it and a red spot burnt on each of her pale I7 cheeks. "I dare say you think I am a strange a girl to tall: to you, whom I have barely ro known an hour, about such subjects. SWell, I cannot help it. In the wilds of is Cornwall one has not much chance of v- learning manners oracquiring the placid s, sang froid of the upper ten thousand," it she added, with a laugh which had no c mirth in it. S? Harold felt by turns attracted and re r polled bly his companion. Astrange girl! n Olive St. IMaur had spoken truly. He had never seen anyone so beautiful; her Sironical, rather bitter words, had.es piquant fascination.' thougli they sad-. v dened him. s "Strange? Not at ali,"v was his riady rejoinder, made with the ease of a thor , ough man of the world, used to its light at fence as well as its more earnest com hi:ts. "WVhy should I think it, Miss St. raur? . - "How did you know my name?" She : tiiuned qnicly,, darting . a. searchitir i' glance at hiinm, theii added rather petpi: ly lantly--"Ah! I see, I thought as much. JudithliPenale has been entertaining ynn s, -with our famnily listory. It does not il- matter, though. -You know all about us . niow and there is no need of formal in y troduction or wear_ repetitiois."

When he does. things will. perhaps, be differ- a cut." For. the first time Olive nearly hated the thought of her cousin's delicate, wild. rose face, with its large, innocent, hazel , eyes and pretty d1iimples. Harold Carrington, little dreaming of the effect his idle words were destinied to' produce, continued:. "As I 'nid, I did not come here to sketch. 1. bind been feeling unwell- ?-overdone in town--and one day, look lug over my friend's portfolio, I came ;across a study of those low, ilue hills, with the wild sea dashing up to them, and a few scattered cottages lying close down by the beach. Somehow it stayed Sin my .memory 'and' fascinated me strangely. So, me voila. But I own when I first taclded old Jundith-before you s'o kindly c:ane to lmy rescue--1 Shealrtily w;ished I had asked my chum a little mnore ahont the place." :' " This is where my aunt lives," said Olive: They had reached the cottage, which a was built of gray.stone, arnd.wa only a little larger than those in the village be t low. But it. was covered with the glorious. crimsoni', irnia creelper; and its diamond latticed windows stood openu to the pure breelze of heaveni, showbhig I glimpses of spotless, snoivwvhite curtains. Thesmna:ll garden was neatly` tended, as a though.l y'liovinghands, asid old ?fash d ioned flowers bloomed in it, a.blaze of color-hollyhocks, white, red and golden; a tall blue larkspurs and large. deep i- :cupped lilies. '"The realization of a poet's dream,'" S..said Harold' Carrington: "a veritable o- paradise. Miss Olive.' I envy you for a having such a home." a "You need not." she returned, with a if sharpness in her voice that jarred upon g him. "'Wait until you see how small and pokey and poverty strickeni it is." a A tall, thin lady. dressed in black and r. wearing a widow's cap, came down the :e narrow path to meet tlhem. She was re it fined looking and rather hanidsome in is a somber, somewha't austere style, but her :c face wore an expression of sternnmess and a her hair was white as snow. a "You are welcome, i?ir."-- "Car it rington," put in Olive, quickly. "Alh! si Mr. Carrington, we shdll be glad to let s you a room and to do our best for you. st if, as I charged. my niece to say, our ac k, commodation is. not too humble to. suit a- your tastes." b Mrs. Trevylian's tone :was cold, but there was a straightforwardness and lack t, of affectation in herl speeh which at te once told Harold Carring<on;he was in in the presence of a lady: -. " ? re No mincing allusion to "better days,' i- or "merely to oblige:" whlicl i less supe r. rior woman wa uld not have rfailed to make. e, "It is very good of you to tkilieAie inl Il I feel surel shall -be comfortable 'here; the very .look of the place: is enough to Ie tell nme that--nud my tastes are plain !y ones.

The more she thought over it it, the more she felt convinced that Har iy old'Carriigton had a secret. And this at secret, she vowed to herself, it should hi te. her business to unravel-let 'the results be what they might. .r At last the party irrived at the bay, ee mind the ladies alighted.

Yes. only too will * ingly, ats she would have followed Har E old-Carrington to the world's end had ha j bidden her do so. ty Yet, tlidugh Harold loved her, he had I no intention that she should guess his o secret, at least then. There were many ,, Â· i ,7 reasons why he did not wish to marry wh'y he deemed it almodst impossible that he should do so. And Harold Carrington c was an bonorable man, who held old fashioned ideas. e No man, lhe told' i-'usclf, had a right to speak of love to a girl unless he in tended to ask her to be his wife. Yet for today at least he would be happy. Heaven knew that life had not as yet 1 held much brightness for him'. He and Madge walked along over the shining, yellow sands almost in silence. OJUe or two sea-gulls dipped and circled "over and around the pale blue-gray waste of waters. The rugged crags, sea t weed'grown. loomed purple and red be hind them. Here and there a ruined shanty. standing near enough to the sea to be bespattered by spray on a stormy night. gave token of human habitation, as did a long line of brown orange nets stretc?ed drying on the shingle. One or two black old hulls of fishing boats lay high up beyond the sea line. Harold paused suddenly. "Yes. this is the place from whence my friend, Norman, took his sketch. A weird, wild spot indeed," he said. r "You would say that if you knew all the legends of, the place. It was here thait, in the old smuggling days, many a cargo was rn ashore, and many a dark deed done. ,Tradition says that there are caves.out round the headland which run miles under the cliff. I have oftenlongeda to explore them, but dare not without a guide: and the people about here are, so irough and wild, one is almost afraid of them." answered Madge. S'Well, we'll have a look at them, one of these days, eh? What do you say t Miss Madge? You would not be afraid to venture with me?" "i With you? Oh, no.". * Madge looked shyly np at Harold. Her ;t eyes had a strange soft light in them. Her companion had unconsciously laid a tender emphasis on his lastwords, which had thrilled her to the very soul S"I do riot think I'should be, afraid to go anyHliere with yodu Oh!
