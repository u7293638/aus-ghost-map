THE AMERICAN STAGE. \------- AN INTERVIEW WITH ME. BEA.NDEEJ MATTHEWS. (By W. A., in tue Pall Mall Gazette.) To Mr Brander Matthews, of Now York, cntic, essayist, novelist, and playwright, wo owo the best book oxtant upon tho modern Trench, drama It w ould mean littlo to call it tho best English book, for thero is no other, but I do not know oven in Trench any book bo concise, accurato, and impartial Mr Matthews is ono of thoso good Americans who discount tho joys of eternity by frequent visits to Paris in tho flesh , and, going or returning, ho generally gives i fow weeks to London Tho other day ho favoured mo with a visit, aad, outiagmg tho la« s of hospitality, I seized tho occasion to interview him as to the present condition of tho American stage " In spite of cables tnd correspondents," I said, " wo stay-at-homes lu England find it very diffi- cult to fonn any in id conception of tho re ii substanco and movement of vour theatrical life Wo read of tho colossal success of this 01 that English star , fabulous estimates aro cabled of Ins or her total "pilo " at tho end of a season, ovon tho success or fniluro of a well-known English play is occasionally rumoured on thiH side Thus wo aro vaguely conscious of America as a sort of theatrical suburb of London But I pro sumo it is a great deal moro than that " " I was very much struck," Mr Matthews ropliod, "with what a young American literary man said to mo tho other day Ho had spent two 01 threo years m Loudon in tho thick of tho theatrical world, and ho told mo that ou returning to Amonca ho was surpnsol to find how much moro plcasuro ho re- ceived from tho American than from tho English Btagc It was bo much simpler, fresher, and nearer to hfo Society plays-dress-coat and whito-nccktio dramas-you do bettor than wo, but wo como much nearer than you to a genuino reflection of tho life of tho peoplo " " Then I presumo the long-looked-for American tlrumntist has como at last " " If not tho dramatist," said Mr Matthows, " nt least the dram i Of courso, as you know, wo havo long had a dramatist of tho first rank in Mr Bronson Howard but ho rather compotes with your Pinero and Grundy in tho society play w o'll talk of him anon Tho American drama I am now speaking of is really a development from tho variety show " Towv and Corr-rev " You aro thinking of tho Harrigan farces ?" " Partly, not mainly They dopiot hfo in tho lower quarters of No« "iork, very much as your Mr Chovalior dopictfl ono corner of London life If you can imagino a dozen or a Booro of Chevaliers, each hiving a different specialty- one portraying tho coster, another tho cabman, a third tho organ-grinder or penny ico man, a fourth tho workman politician, a fifth tho Gorman musician, n sixth the Irish navvy, and so forth-and all of theso brought togother in some farcical intrigue, helped out with olabor ito scenic realism, then you havo somo conception of tho sort of pliy which runs, year out year in, at Harr.gan's Theatre It was onginally an ni libitum mU6ic hall sketch, but it is now a con- structed and written drama It has followed a couiso of development very much Uko that of Trench and Italian comedy from tho improved eommedui dell' m te But it w as not the Harrigan play that I had chiefly in my mind " " What then r" " Why, tho play of country life, and mainly of Now England country life, of w Inch ' Tho Old Homestead ' is tho most famous example This play is entiroly tho creation of the actor, Denman Thompson, who plays the chief character, Uncle Josh Whitcomb It, too, had its germ in the music-hall sketch, hut has loug sinco grown "to n lerilrnn pnrpfnlh ordered drimil It is tho theatue.il counterpart of tho Mary E WilkinB or Sarah Orino Jowett story of Now England rural life Pkcro is nothing what e\er of tho Adelphi mclodrima about it thora is practically no plot and absolutely no villain Everything is quiet, refined, true to nature, under-xilayed rathol than over- played In tho first act j ou havo tho farmyard in summer, placed on tho stago with elaborate realism At ono theatre thoy got Phihppotenux to paint a cyclorama background for it Nows comes that tho son of tho houBo has got into troublo m Now York, and that is all tho story of tho first act In tho second act wo havo Lnclo Josh Wlntcomb in a wealthy Now York household Thero is somo exaggeration m tho staging of this act and an element of caricaturo in the traditional mistakes of tho country cousin Tho last act bhowa us tho prodigal's roturn , scone, tho interior of tho old homestead on a winter night Thero is ono survival of con\en tion in this play- the con\entiun of singing Tho farm hands drop into a quartotto as thoy go oft to their work, and so forth But tho bo all and end all of the play is tho exhibition of character , it presents a whole gallery of genuino rustió types, and tho pubhc recognises them and delights in them " 11 An exceedingly hopoful sign And has *" Tho Old Homestead' mado a school ' " Yes-or at least tneio aro several other plays which represent tho same artistic tendency Thero is 'Tho Count} Eau,' in which Neil Burgess, an cx- ncgro minstrel, plays an old maid Yes, tom mc- hen entendu, an old maid-but it is a really refined and artistic performance Then thero is ' Shore Acres ' written and acted by James A Hearne, which ran all tho winter in Boston tv, o seasons ago, and in New York last season " " Was not Mr Hearne concerned in soma sort of Theatre Libro experiment in Boston ' " " You mean tho production of ' Margaret Elem íug ' ? Yes, that was a play of tho same typo, but going rather deeper beneath tho surface The great sceno in it was ono in which a wife, inspired by tho maternal instinct, gives suck to her hus- band's illegitimate child, deserted by its mother Tho pi ry mado a great bl libation in Boston, and w us af tera arda produced ni Now York, but with- out success " " Now-tell me-suppose theso plays, ' Tho Old Ilomestend,' ' The Couutv Tair,' and ' Shore Acres ' printed, how "would tko\ read*"" Mi Matthew s mado a lougish pauso "Well,' he said, "von must remember that they aro all written for, and tho first and last of thora aro written by, tho character ictoi who plays tho leading part , so that naturally a great deal of character is expressed m business rather than in v, ords But they are nono tho w orso plays on that account " Tul LnTRArY Tr%-rjE\<ri "And has New England a monopoly of this c1 tss of work"" " Not at all," replied Mr Matthews, with alacrity "lins is only ono phaso of a literary movement w Inch is going on all over tho United States, though is yet ish moro obwous in tho novel than on tho stage Every district of the Union is finding its m^erpretei or interpreters in literatnro As yet, tho clnof repre- sentative of this movement on tho st igo is a young man named Augustus Thomas, whoso 'Alabama' and 'In Mi/7011111' havo both been very successful They depict Ufo 111 Alabama and Missouri in u manner which ma} bo described as a mixturo of Bret liai te and Miss Willuns Tho nnthoi's efiort is bent tow aids tho revolution of sweet hum 111 character Ho inclines to undor emphasis rather th m o\ er envphnsis, from tho same artistic feeling, perhaps, which leads Duso to underplay somo cf her pul ts and ho hail more of tho litcnry touch than such men as Denman Thomnson or Challes Ho}t " " HoytJ That 13 a now name " "Charles Ho}t is tho most successful of our author-maingcra (Let mo remark, in paren- theses, that except touring stars, woha\o no actor-managers in America, "wliilo au+hor mauagers aro common ) Hoyt is tho author of 'A Bunch of Keys,' 'A Rag Baby, 'A Tin Soldier,' the «.asth successful 'Trip to China- town ' (which Mr Tern«s is about to produce m Loudon), ' A Texas Steer,' satirising political hfo m Washington, and ' A Midnight Bell,' n drama oi Now Lngland life These, too, me character plays, though tho character t} pos aro a trillo surcharged Tho plot is vcrj simple aud there is no Adelphi villain Mr W D Howells was tho first critic of noto v,ho rceogni'-ed th" íery genuino merita of Mr Hoyt s woik " " How is it, then, that whilo you lune so much snpeiior work of jour own, our Adelphi melo- dramas remain so popuhu on vour sido 9" " They do not leumiu popí lar You aro speak- ing of a bygone state of things The \oguo of Mr Pottitt and his conipeeis is past Tho lue ii pla} s I havo mentioned uro r ipidl v dm ing Adelphi melodiama from tho stage Wo ha-vo, too, a sort of Adelphi plav of our own, somo specimens of which }Ou havo seen hero , for îustanco, Gillotto s ' Hold by tho Euomy ' (at tho Princess's), and Bolasco and Do Millo's « Man and Woman ' (at tho Opera Conuquo), and 'Tho Lost Paradiso ' (at tho Adelphi). Belasco has rccontly produced a very stirring and successful drama of this class, dealing with Indian warfare, under tho titlo of ' Tho Girl I Loft Behind Mo ' " " I gather that the local dramas you speak of aro for tuo most part developments from tho variety sho« What is tho dividing lino between tho music hall and tho theatre in America? " "Thoio is practically none ¡smoking and drinking aro unknown in tho theatre, ind almost unknown in tho musio hall, so that, whcthei a given building takes rank m one class or tho otliT depends simply on tho nature of tho entertain- ment th it happens to occupy tho boards At tho samo timo wo bato an mstitution that answers precisely to cnfi-'Chantnnt-tho (ioof-girdcn ' Several theatres in hovr York utihso their flat roofs m tho suramor scson as open-air cafes, with a music-hall enter- tainment thrown in It consists entirely of single ' turns '-there is no ballot, there aro no ' sketches ' Tho samo payment admits both to tho theatre and tho roof-gaiden, tho two entertainments going on simultaneously " " You promised to tell mo something about Mr Bronson Howard How is it that wc havo Reen nothing of his in London sinco 'ThoIIenriottt V" "Well, his chiof recent production, Aristo- cracy,* at Palmer's Theatre, is not precisoly a play for tho Lnghsh stage It is a scathing sátiro upon American Bnobbery and Anglomania I regard it as a most ablo work, with ono exceedingly daring and brilliant scene Mr Howaid's ' Shenandoah,' too, a very effective war drama is ono of tho most popular of recent American plays " " Whom should you describo ai tho leading literary dramatists of America r" " In tho first place, of course, Mr Howard and after him Mr Augustus Thomas and Mr Gillette " "Tinally, Mr Matthows, will you toll me if it can possibly bo truo that Ibsen's ' Ghosts ' has made a monetary success m America ^" " I was present at tho first performance in î<ow York, along w ith Mr Howells and Mr Aldrich and certainly it impressed mo deeply, though X don't kno« that I want to seo it again Mr Courtney Thorpo's Oswald struck mo as n very re marknblo picco of acting As for its success, it was at auyrato sufficient to encourage tho manage- ment to tako it 4 on the road,' and it is to mako a tour of tho leading cities this winter " " Wondors will never ceaso f If you had told mo that tho ' Prometheus Lnbound' wnsapopular success I should not been moro astonished "
