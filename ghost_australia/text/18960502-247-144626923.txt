Among tbe rocollections of Mr. Froadr, which ippear in the January number or tbe ' Con* temporary Keview,' the writer, the late Mrs. Alexander Ireland, relates the following aiUen ture which befell Mr. Froude, herself, and tome friends when out in a small Bailing boat naar Mr. Fronde's residence wind, and we were hurried along by s1*»-er force of the current of air and water. Opening my eyes, 1 was suddenly aware of a ch#nue in tbe ?oene. An ominous blackness lny on the water immediately around our little boat. l'he kuu still shone at a distance, but wc seemed in night. The cry nf tbe wind waa rained to a wild shriek, tbe water roae tumultuously, the litn-ce Sle came down one of those 4 chiur*,' as the evonsbire folk call them — one of those iiHrrow clefts between two hills. The sky, too, h«d changed ; tbe aail al- i-c6t struck the witer ; rain and aleet fell abundantly. 'Just before this change ef wcatl-er 1 had been saying to Mr. Ymude, * I shijll never be* lieve that I have been here ; it in '11 like a dream to me, tlm experience.' And my rom pauion had said, * You arc like Lbe loily wl.o saw a ghost in her dream aud would not be'iove in it.
