He who was a prinoo at morning is a beg gar of the night! ?,, She who held the world in Booming now ri may wither in itB Bight. All I a battle now it on ! tell the news and who has won I Hear the bullets ringing, stinging— Through the wires' spasmodic Ringing ; Chanting throughout the blood-dimmed day i And this in what they say :— Hot cannon heard upon the hills And rifles in the glen j Oh, ail the world will listen, now : For men are murdering men ! Not hunting God's four footed beasts Or feathered clans, they came : A nation it their hunting-ground, And other men their game. He wot a glittering general With thousands at his nod : He « a fragment of the turf : A clod beneath a clod. He mat a sunny-hearted boy — A hope, but even now : He it a spectre in his home, With blood upon hie brow. She wot a proud and winsome wife The world could not assail ; She malki the street a ghost in black Beneath the widows veil j She -o-u a mother, fond and proud, When morning's geni6 where strown : Bhe « a wrecked old women now, And writhes and sobs alone, — By Will Caeletok. One day, in advocating a more liberal loosening of the purse strings at the re cent Methodist Conference in Washing ton, D.C., Bishop Chandler said that sev ? era! years ago he sent an article to a paper in which he wrote that ' we pray too loud and work too little.' When the article appeared it read' ' We bray too loud and work too little.' ' I let it go at that,' said the bishop j 'the fact is I believe the printer wae right, and I never attempted to correct it.'
