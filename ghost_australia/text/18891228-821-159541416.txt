ECHOES AND RE-ECHOES. I do like that kindly onstom of sending Christmas and New Year cards—it has so much to reoommend it. Inlthe first place, it enables the poorest as well as the richest. person to convey a pleasant intimation to far distant friends that they are not forgotten; in the second plaoe, it is anenoonragement to artiBtio taste ; and in the third place; it is eoonomioal as well as prettily effective, inae mnoh as the giving of presents most find a limit even in the balkiest purse, whereas for the price of one good gift a hundred friends can be gratified by the receipt of a beautiful card delightfully and eloquently expressive of the generous feelings of the sender. The custom promotes good fellowship far and wide, and I notice that the women folk, who as a rule are rather fond of the pastime oi touching, ohi so deftly, one another's sore plaoes, are great Benders of Christmas and New Year curds; the sweet creatures, they sing and sting with equal facility, but they do not mean to be really rough upon one another—it's only a little way they have got! -What bushels and bushels of promises of amendment the hew year has thrown at its feet, and what quantities of those pledges remain on his hands at the end of the term without having been redeemed by these who voluntarily pat them is hla path. The old year has been treading knee deep in broken promises from the beginning,, and so will his euooesaor. It 1b a way people have got. They feel awfully sentimental and inclined to reform when the clock is approach ing the midnight honr and the old year Is giving up the ghost, bnt Bentiment soon suffers when It robs Bhonlders with self-in terest. There is very little of it left after the week's festivities are over and the direful effects of the indigestible Chrietmas pudding have worn off.
