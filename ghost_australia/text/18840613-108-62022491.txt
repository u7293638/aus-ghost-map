PORTFOLIO. THE TRINITY. At our blessed Lord's baptism the spirit of God "descended like a dove and rested upon Him, and a voice from heaven" de clared Him "to be the Son of God." And what can be plainer than the distinc tioi here between the Spirit descending and resting, the Father whose voice pro nounced Jesus His Son, and that Son himself, whom His Spirit rested upon, and His voice bore testimony to. "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever, even the spirit of truth. Now when the Comforteris come whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of me." Here are manifestly acts and persons and capacities different. The Father from whom the spirit proceeds, to whom the Son prays, and by whom at the Son's re quest the Comforter was given. The Son praying the Father, sending the Comforter from the Father, and testified of by the Spiritso sent And the Spirit prayed for, given by the Father, sent from the Father by:the Son, testifying of the Son and abiding for ever with those disciples from whom the Son had departed. Since we have devoted ourselves in baptism and there promised constant homage and obedience and adoration to the Trinity in Unity: let us all in humility and rever ence agree with angels and all heavenly powers, with cherubim and seraphim, with apostles and prophets and martyrs, and with the Holy Church throughout all the world in praising and acknowledging this Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Sab baoth. Even the Father of an infinite Majesty, His honourable, true, and only Son, and also the Holy Ghost the Com forter,. living and reigning, one God, World without end. Amen.-Dean Stan hope.
