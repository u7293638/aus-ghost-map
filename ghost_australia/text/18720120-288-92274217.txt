NEWS OF THE WEEK On Friday, January 19, Mr Henry Scott; J.P. held an inquest at Cossack's Hotel, Crafers, on the body of a little boy, the son of Mr Searle, who came to his death in a very singular manner. Mr. R. Driver was Foreman of the Jury. From the evidence it appeared that, the deceased had taken dinner to his father, and whilst returning home tripped, and, breaking a bottle he was carrying, a piece entered his neck, cutting the jugular vein and causing him to bleed to death. A verdict of accidental death was returned. '^Tlie Northern Argy&,r speaking : , -oj stmikes* says :— 'iast : ,weeki ; at ;a f^rm near.

The accounts show * balance of nearly £16^000 in favor of assets, and £1,623 8s. id., on. the right side of profit and loss. . ' ,' . , ' TKe' Government have, received from the Northern Territory despatches which are simply an elaboration of the telegraphic message brought by last mail. The difficulties Mr. Patterson has met with in carrying out bis work are attributed entirely to the 'selection of Port. Darwin instead of the Bpper as a starting point. At the Kbper the stock would have been landed in rich pasture, and would have recruited rapidly, but at Palmerston they had to' be driven seven or eight miles ^to feed.'- ; At the EoperJ the party ' wotild have been 220^ miles nearer ? ?. their work than -they were M Port Darwin. It has been often suggested' that the stock were injured by being;too-qui°ldy put'to work -before they had time ;to. lecove^ from the effects of their vpy.age3 and it is. now. known, that Jhis-^was. the case. '']&*. Patterson' divided' 'the ^expedition z' into:-'fourl parties, and one divisibfi lost 28 'per' cent, of their -bullocks, most -rf them dying after landing. The losses of the horse stock amounted to about 6 percent. 'The wiorst of !it4s-;that th«se lossei neairly.allLoccurred before ?the party g.bt .to ,the rpommencement.of their 'pr6perworfc,: ' and while engaged in useless and iunnecessaty- travellingv forced rupbnr them by the Government- in opposition to the;recpm mendations of land explorers, surveyors, and seamen, ' who1 knew -. the-cbuntry, arid iad heen ?specially employed to examine and report Suponit. . _ . ,,t.- - . ?. - .:.,.„... -..;?? i Our principal seaport jus still without a jhospital, though almost every week we have tof jr^Bord-some' serious -casualty to life or limb, ?with an addendum, to our paragraph, to the :effect that the poor sufferer has to 'endure _the ifurther s&rture; of ? having, to be sent1 to Ade laide to,bertreated at the Metropolitan Hospital, ?This necessity certainly does not arise from want iof m'edical%kill at the Port, for the practitioners there possess in ahigh.degreethe-cdnMenceof the'residenis-s ,and stfll poor shattered-humanity ican&bt; obtain proper relief within, eight miles iof the place of Accident^. supposing it occurs at ?the. chief ^harbor , of the colony- It is tixie, isimple Iractures of limbs are treated at the Casualty Hospital; and at ihe present time there is a woman 'lying there with a broken limb. The BO:called Casualty. Hospital consists pf a: room *at the Police ; Barracks scantily fur Inished. At times we have known as many as three patients confined to their beds for weeks in- this small' apartment, with a~_tem iperature of 90°, for perhaps 10 days, con Bequtiyely. ? Then, again when it occurs, and Ktofbrturiately it ;is'hot. rarely, 'that some poor icreature has had his limb or limbs sbsMttered jthafr amputation is necessary, -there is no jother place ^tp perform, the.. operation . but the. one rotfni already mentioned, and in. the, pre Bencfl-proijablyof a couple ot^fevered patients. fWJa-reniem.ber.^ recent pecurrenceof this sort jwhen^Dr. Gething amputated a manVarm that jhad been dreadfuUysfiatteVed ; and we could inention numbers of similar cases. After an operati&nbt;'this kind.is perlormpdno doubt tne ^'atierif'-'should' ibt Hi removed ; arid that jhe.£b.ouldi.hiave :tb lay- for -weeks or months in |the ;rpom' already described;. ?would be.,mani festlyTsrnel. Hence, when the doctor isJ called Buddenly^io attend a serious .case he is com pelled to alleviate the sufiEerer only to. such an extent as will prevent too much danger from the effects of his' removal to tbe Hospital. To make matters worse, tiie Casualty Hos pital is without ^proper appliances, such aa Splints, or lint, or other things that a tlospital should have. These remarks are immediately suggested' by .having witnessed a serious mishap tfiat befel- a' carter namfed'Jphn Holman, inrfihe employ of Bradley,oTreleaven, &Co.;, pn Thursday afternoon. He was engaged stowing coils pf wire rin. his .dray, which wassipiabed beneath the window of the upper btorjey, .at.. Messrs. : Harrpld U Gp.'s. The wire was being lowered by means of pulley, and from an accidental cause the hook holding one oithe bundles' allowed ii to fall out. and it came brushing on the poor - fellow from, a height ef about ly'feet from where he was' standing, and falling on his Bhoulder and left leg, fractuip.d the latter in a terrible manner below the knee. Dr. Gething was in' attendance a very few minutes after the accident, and at once took necessary precautions rto, stop the hemorrhage. Then, well kao wing the worse than uselessneas pf 'the: so- called Casualty Hospital, he was, with 1 the concurrence ; of Dr. Duncan, forced to ^advise the' poor sufferers immediate pemoval by train to the' Adelaide Hospital, where the injured limb- was amputated below the knee .by Dr. ,-Clindening, assisted by gcyerar other medicai gehtlemen. * i;Mr. M. * Kingsborotfgi^ of Adelaide, has received a letter from the Kev. Wm. Taylor, the American, evangelist, who is still in India. He' was at the beginning of last monthlaboriDg 5n Bombay, and the Guardian, a religious periodi cal publishedin Bombay, speaks in very favor able terms of the work being done by the rev. gentleman. Trom Mr. Taylor's letter. we ex tract the following: — 'I have been laboring here. lip w.(Noyember 22) eight days— Eervices at IT a.m. and half-past 6 p.m. We, have . from 40 jto 65 hearers in the niorning/and about 200 in jbhe- evening. f-[ The preachingijs translated into the Mahrattalangaage. ..JPe had 13 seekers for ward;lastnight,andtheworkis opening encourag ingly, considerisg tiie small ntmibeT of -workers, and that Methodist modes are entirely. :new to them. There is nbV a' Methodist ' Church or brganization on this side of India ; the nearest Would be in the Madras Presidency, say 800 miles, knd as for that it might as well be in China, as its mfiuence is not felt here.' Mr. Taylor wishes to-be remembered' +0 a number of friends in jtbis - colony,- : some' , of whom he mentions. by name, but says — 'There 'an? others 'whom I, love Whose names don't *sMke me.
