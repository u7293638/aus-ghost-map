THE MALTESE ASSES. We usually alluded a day or two since, to two very superior asses, imported by the Australian Agricultural Company, and we have since learned that the Company has spared no pains nor ex- pense in obtaining the best that could be got in the Island of Malta and Goza, where the breed is particulary attended to, and whence they are exported to all parts of the world. For the last twelve months the Company have used mules for supplying their distant sheep stations with rations and stores. From ten to eighteen are generally employed, attended by three men, and with a load of between two or three hundred pounds weight each, will travel forty miles in a day, for shorter journies they will carry four hundred pounds. These mules, which are of small size, were imported from Valparaiso. The produce of the stallions now imported out of three-parts bred mares, may be expected to be more powerful, and therefore able to carry greater burthen than those from South America, where, although the breed is very promiscuously carried on, and the mules are small, the usual weight is three hundred and fifty pounds besides the packs. The following is the pedigree of the asses imported by the Achilles, and to those who hate only been in the habit of seeing the dull, heavy looking "donkey" of England, the idea of calling asses by such names as "Sweet- heart," "The Pretty," and the "Golden Flower," will be amusing. JOCCO rising three years, by the famous Goza stallion, "Gigante" or the Giant, so called from his remarkable height of fifteen hands and two inches, and represented as an animal of great strength, power, and beauty; his progeny are considered the handsomest and tallest race now existing in the islands of Malta and Goza; Jocco's dam was bred in Malta, where she is well known in her "casal" (district) as the "Arnsa" or Sweetheart, from her fine shape and peculiar qualities as a brood jenny ass, - she esteemed of great value by her owner, as the dame or many fine colts that have been sold at high prices. YOUNG BURCHER is of a different race from "Jocca", being of more compact shape, short back, round barrel, large rocks, stout arms, deep chest, strong bony leges, and large hoofs, neck somewhat short, but standing well on the shoulders; this race of asses stand between thirteen and fourteen hands high; the same of Young Burcher is known in the "casal" as the "Sbaiah" or the pretty - a noted brood jenny ass, - her granddam "Fiur tah Dehel" or the golden flower, was a valuable brood jenny ass of compact shape, - her produce at two and three years old brought first rate prices. The Ame- ricans in the purchases give a preference to the deep chested asses, though standing from two to four inches lower. (Signed) S.

It will be found very useful for all persons in business Like all other work performed at Tegg's, the typography is very neat PUBLICANS' LICENSES - It appears that one half of the Sydney publicans had not the least idea of applying for an extension of their hours of selling until they were given to understand that their applications, toa certain extent, would be complied with. This, if true, shows that the merit or dement of the extension rests with the officials Among the ubsurdities of the present system is that of making £10 the price fora ten, eleven, or all night license BANK NOTES - During the present week several parlies have been apprehended for pass ing off country orders for bank cheques The committal of the parties has been postponed, m order that information of the forgeries may be communicated to those whose names are alleged to have been forged ROBBERY -On Friday night, about half past six, two men walked into Clarke's public hou e, (late Mrs Cole's) and had a glass, after which one of them pulled out the till and ran oil with it, on being pursued he turned it up-nde down, when the contorts fell on the ground; he was however, still pursued, and ultimately he and his companion were lodged in custody they turned out to be men assigned to one of the Harbour Master's boats TRADE OF SYDNEY.-The trade of Sydney will be annihilated in a few months -it may linger on until the end of the year, but by that time it will go out as clean as a candle, when an extinguisher is put upon it It is a melanchol) fact but doubtless true, for we have it asserted on the word of an auctioneer, whose seracily no one can doubt, that three new towns that have been established lately, or are to be estab lished some day, are each to attract at least half of the trade of Sydney, while another, he modestly announces, will have a considerable share. Of course the value ot property m these new towns will increase in proportion to the decrease of the importance of Sydney land and houses A3 money is w anted, perhaps a little could be raised by selling the harbour of Syd- ney, for as soon as all the new towns are estab lished, and "three halies" of our commerce is gone, we shall have no occasion for it IMPORTANT AUCTION SALES - We are re- quested to state that at 12 o'clock tins day Mr. Stubbs will sell some most valuable properties, viz , the beautiful steam packet Hunh ew, Bank Stock, and Union Assurance Shares, Flood's Pyrmont and St. Leonards', Bathurst and Sin- gleton Town Allotments, and to morrow the splendid stud of brood mares, fillies and geld mgs, of first-rate stock, at the Cattle Market, at li o'clock STEAM.-At tine dinner given to Lord John Russell by the Directors of the New Zealand Company, Mr G F Young announced that -A company to establish steam communication be- tween these Colonies and Pmama was m con- templation Wa give the following cxtr ict from hn speech -?"

A female who had en- tered the house with them, was also committed as nn occcssory TRANSFER OF LICENCES - On Friday last, a Speenl Petty Sessions was summoned to attend at the Sydney Police Office, for the purpose of considering a number of applications for the transfer of public an s licenses, but as only four or five magistrates attended, another Special Sessions has been summoned tor to day at noon for the same purpose, when it is hoped that at least fourteen magistra es will attend in order that the bu«in»ss may be gone througn INQUEST - On Thursday afternoon an in- quest was held at the Blue Bell, Sussex street, on the bodt of Elizabeth Kelly, a freed woman, about fifty seven years ot age, who had been found dead on the morning of that day, under a piece of tarpauling, attached to the skilling at the Soldier's point. From the evidence given at the inquest, it appeared that the deceased had been for some time previous cohabiting with one of the old hands of the town, known as Abba Bamford, who makes a living by cutting and carrying out firewood, and that she and her aged paramour had, on the preceding eveming, gone under the tarpaulin to enjoy their night's rest, that she was complaining of a pain in the bowels, but on the whole did not appear out of her usual way; that between three and four in the morning, when Bamford awoke, she was unusually cold, when he tried to make her hear hima, but received no answer At daylight he found she was dead. Dr Harnett having cer- tified that death was caused by natural causes a verdict to that effect was recorded. BAD FENCING -About half past six o'è'ock on Friday cieiiiug, as Inspector Nu ent was going up the precipitous nsccnt from Windmill to «Vort street, he met a man to whom he spoke, and was answered, but a few moments otter, hearing a try and a splash, he turned b\ck when ii was discotcred that the man lie hid just spoken to had fallen into the quam , ) c was fortunately got out npp-i ctttly but slightly in jurcd It ap'tits that after beni!- passed by the Inspettor he had taken hold of the fence in order to prevent him Iron» falling intl when leaning henvi y to it in consequence of his feet sliding, the rail gate wat wncn he and it Were precipitated down n perpendicular height of up- wards of thirty feet, and but for the hole being filled with water he must hase been killed in- stantaneously As several persons hate already been killed by falling o\ tr the same p'acc and on one oC the inquests which was held a present ment was made bv the jury of the unsafe part of the street, it was hoped that it would hate been attended to, as we recollect that the Coroner stated shortly after that he had rctetved an intimation in reply to it from his Excellency, stating that this should be the case We w ou'd en postant just remark that the north end of 1 ort street is not the only break neck portion of our St dnev thoroughfares.
