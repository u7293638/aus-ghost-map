VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB. Second Day.— Saturday, 18tu OorocRR. The second day of the V.A.T.C, spring meeting was in marked contrast to tho first, both in point of weather and attendance, and it may safoly bo' said that never before has bo largo a crowd boon gathered logothor on Caulfiold heath. At an approximation, it may bo estimated that noarly 20,000pcrsons wcro prosont, andtho fiatalonowas more extensively patronised than wo havo everbe- foro soon tho wholo racecourao, Tho woathor, though cloudy in tho morning, improvod as the day, wore on, aud tho afternoon was simply perfect tho buii shining out brightly, though tompored by a balmy southern broezo. Tho rail was tho favorite mothod of journeying out, 7072 persons patronis ing it, and, though special traius started at short intervals, tho authorities had. entiroly mis calculated tho trafiic. Every carriago was rushed as soon as it drew up, and if, after a sovoro strugglo, tho passonger managed to got in it 'was only to find tho compartment filled to twico its capacity. The same thing happened on tho return journey, and many of those who dosired to return in somo degreo of comfort had either to wait an hour or moro, or submit to tho extortionate de mands of tbo few cabraon who wero left. If the rail way people deBiro tomako thotrainroutc popu lar in futuro thoy must make arrangements moro in accordonce with requirements, and despatch trains from either ond as thoy are roquirod, and not have a rush as ouch car riage draws up at the platform. Tbo con- trast between tho Caulfiold and Fleming, ton railway management was most marked, ana, if it is possible to make pcrfoct arrangements for tho latter plaoo. thero should bo no difficulty iu improving on tho faulty mannor in which Satur day's trafiic was curried to Caulfiold. Whilo on tho subject of tho imperfections of tho mooting, tho attention of tho committoo of tho V.A.T.O. may be dirocted to tho utterly inadoquato ac commodation provided for tho press representa tives. In the first placo, tho spaco set apart was not noarly largo enough, and in tho noxt it was filled bystraugors, thoio/m fide presB mou being in many instances prevented from gotting near tho stand, owing to tbo crush, and tho work of reporting was rondcred most difficult in consequence. Tho stand is not noarly largo onough, and noxt year somo schomo for in creased accommodation will bo required. When this is done, it i3 to bo hopod that Mr. Bond will soo that propor provision is made for those who hnvc done not a littlo to mako his meetings as successful as they havo been. Tbo attondanco, as already stated, was tho largest known, and amongst tboso prosent wero his Excelioncy tho , Governor, Lady Loch and suite, who wcro drivon down by Mr. S. Miller. Waruecko'a military bnd played a numfcor of selections duriog tho afternoon, and the other arrangomcnts (oxciusivo of tboso faults montionod abovo), including tbo entering efforts of Mr. II. Skiunor, woro admir able. Tboracingcommcnccd with tbo Selling Raco, for which Stonobroko and Costawny wore in most uomana, oat oiu aiisiaxo, wno30 pneo Kept many backers away, who would otherwise havo sup ported him, galloped over tho top of the othorg at tbo finish, and won easily, Castaway being second. Aftor luncheon tbo olovon competitors saddled up for tbo Hurdlo Raco, and, when Ontario was scratched, a rush was mado to got on Gasalier, who was supported right out vory strongly as woll as in doubles with Friondloss. Huzard, whom Cbifnoy had in groat form, was noxt best favorite, and both Schoboloff and Don Quixoto wero also supported for money. Matador, whoso tomper appears to havo been quito ruined, stopped at tho post when Iho flag fell, and Tantaliser mado most of tho running for a mile and a half, when ho was done, andSchoboloff thon appeared tobegoing as woll as anything. Thelatter was soon beaten, and Gnenlier, who, wo imagino camo a bit too soon, thon assumed tho command and led ovor tho last hurdle, whero Hazard, who bad been most judiciously ridden by King, joinod issue, and beat tho maro homo rather easily. Tbo party fcohind tho winner did not back him for anything to speak of, and again the books had tho host of tho transaction. Tbo Nursoiy Han dicap had a field of thirteon, and. though at tho outlet Tho Teacher wa3 most in demand, Violet had so many friends that sho went out first favorite, though Tho Toachor, Ocista and Dan- souse woro woll supported. An interesting raco resulted, nnd Tho Teachor just got homo first from Wolseley, with Ocista, who was twico dis appointed, a very good third. Tho great raco of the mooting camo noxt, and ovoryono of tho 23 horsos colored on tho card wero aspirants, Thoro was tho nsnal rush for a look, and tho crowd was so great that it was Impossible toseo only a few. Fryingpan was tho first we saw, and ho lookod trained to tho hour, but ho appearod to bo a littlo tondcr in tho off forolog, on which ho woro a bandago, Coulstoun was ono of tho earliost saddled, and croatod a disappointing impression, as ho lacked inusclo, and cortainlv did nob itu- pross good judges with tho idoa that ho would get a milo and a half in tho time credited to him. Mnlua also looked too lusty, but Claptrap was iu porfoct condition. Martini- Houry was blooming, and thoro W2S no handsomor horse on tho ground than his stablo companion Despot. Hastings, Rapid, Battailous, Yatoly and Flyiug Jib woro alflo in fino form, whilo tho wook had mado a groat improvomont iu Ilolonc. Vorgy was mus cular, and tho oonfidonco of. his party remained unabated to tho last minute. Norfolk, who had been sold during tho morning to Captain Haimos with certain contingencies, wao also woll, but tho othors, 'excopt from tho partisans of thoir particular stables, rocolvod littlo attention, Blink Bonny having tho smallest lovco of any animal in tho paddock. In tho botting Vorgy hold tbo pride of plaoo at 4 to 1 ; whilst Colstoun recodod to slxos. Fryingpan and Bend Or woro .noxt ih domand, varying pricos boing called against tho othors down to 100 to 2. at which odds Blink Bonny's namo was frequently shouted without loadingtobusinoss. Thohistoryof tbo raco in 'soon told, as aftor Luvington and Yatoly led in turil to half a milo from homo, Blink Bonny ran upjon tho outsido, and drawing away from ' th'e otliora as if thoy woro ancborou, won oaBily by' foijr longtba ; Lord Wilton, anothor out- sidot jbeing just cloar of V Vorgy. Malua, who | kauio in tho moat extraordinary 'mannor at finish, was fourth, and in tho firat ton woro also Fryingpan, Martini, Claptrap, Hcleno, -Yatoly'and Norfolk. Vcrgy wao seriously inter- forod vfith along tho back and lost several lengths though wo don't think it mado any difforouco in tho result, but Colstoun was never dangerous and cliq# not socm at any timo oqual to the task of gotting near tho loadors. Tbo ring won largely by tbo result, as Blink Bonuy ran almost unbacked, her ownor having hU monoy on Vergy ind, beyond a fow small bots, tbo winner's narao was n'pvcr written, Tbo Steeplechase was re- f aided! ns rather a good thing for tho larquls of Watorford in Frlendloss's abaenco, but' a' fino finish saw an outsider, in Strugglor, jast got homo in front of anothejr uon-favonto, Echo. Tho St. John party wore very sweet on tho chanco of their horse fin tho concluding ovont of tho day, tbo Windsor Handicap, but Mozart, who is on- gaged yi tho Dorby, and handsome and woll bred enough to win that or any othor raco, camo like a racchorso at tho finish, and won oasily. cover ing tho 0 furlongs in capital tlino.

As they went along the sido towards tho back, Yately deprived Lavington of thole id, tho filly taking socondplnco, just in advance of Battailous.
