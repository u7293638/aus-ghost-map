TIIB FACING. By tho time tho bell rang- for tho horees to saddle up for tho Railway Stakes, tho firetraco of tho day, the crowd had increased to web an extent that loeoinotion in tho paddock was so difficult that it was almost impossible to sea thoborses. However, as scratching bad rteucea tho field to five runners, it was not tong be o visitors were enabled to seo inu tho Starters. Isonomy, both from bisprevi u. performnnco in tlio Derby «nd,.c0',",?d'"h appoarance, was tjuite a king m .the cro , his victory was regarded as nf it ? tainty. l'arsvaii, who ran third for th0 Caul- field Guineas, was the only horao sup posed to bo capable of clipping his wings, and he had a few friends. First "inoo was notoriously short of work, and lerchance, a handsome son of Gang Forward sud the im ported mare Peradventuro will require more time before ho is fully developed. In the bet ting market fconoiny was regarded as such a go, Id thing that the fielders tvould not ac cept less than 5 to 2. while the quo tations about tho others were merely nominal, First Prince being the only other ono backed. Tho race needs littlo description, an the favorite with Baroa Neckar mndo the run ning to the home turn, when tho former drew . « V«a»a».1 — »"" " — — w» mm m away, and, without over-being extended, won by two lengths from First Prince, who came very fast at the finish and beat Baron Neckar for second honors bv a head. 'Ae. s timo was excellent, and though lha state of the course was conducive to record breaking the performance of tho winner justi fied the Enpport acsorded to the celt by his trouth Australian friends for the Derby. There were halt a dozen starters for the Kensington Stakes, for nvo-year-olds. and. as the only per formers of merit included ih the lot' wore MacldeUna and Tho Nun. the punters were not long in selecting the former as tho best thing in. 3u fact, so pronounced were lackers in her favor that odds of C to 4 on were freely laid, and The Nun was next in demand at 5 to 2 against, tho if hers being comparatively neglected. No jv.istako was made in tho selections, as Mad rid ina shot out below the distance, and, though the Nun made .a vigorous effort a hundred yards irom home, she had no chance what ever with the Adelaide filly, who won without ever being extended. by a couple of lengths, while Telephone," the : bird favorite, was an indifferent third. Ac cording to the conditions of the race the winner dad to be sold ior 300 guineas, and, niter some smart competition, she was secured by Mr. \V. A. Long for £620. of which £320 - went to the club. The filly has on several occasions shown brilliant form, and was purchased very cheaply, tho time she inn tho live fur longs in being sufficient cvidenco of her )ossessin.g u great tarn of speed. Withdrawals for the Hurdle Race reduced the field to ten runners and on her performance in the Weight for Age Hurdle Ilace on Saturday against The Agent, Gasalicr was very justly made the first favorite at the outset." bnt a strong com mission coming into the market in favor of The Brigand at the last moment he left "Hi first favorite at 5 to- 4, a price that ur.u plenty of takers. Agitation and Kavensworth both had' followers at G to 1 each, hut none of tho others were supported with any. spirit, the friends of tho winner, Kubv, being doubtful oi her ability to get the distance. Mistake made the running for two- thirds of the journey, when Brigand shot to the iront. and appeared all over a winuer half a mile from home ; but he suddenly dropped back, and Buby and Ravens- worth wcro left- to fight it out, with tho result that tho former, aided by her light weight, drew away, after crossing the last hurdle, and won with case by half a dozen lengths. Dura- t ion, who had "been backed to win a good stake, extinguished his chance by falling near tbo abattoirs, and Brigand broke down so ' badly that it is doubtful whether bo will ever race again. The Hurdle Race was ail over, and tbo horses had weighed in at a few minutes after three o'clock, anil there intervened nearly an hour in which to inspect tho candidates for the Cnp, but- this was a" matter of some dif ficulty in consequence of tho crowd being eo dense in the paddock. Never before in tho his tory of the Melbourne Cup have so many people been anxious to obtain a peep at the favorites, and it was difficult to secure more than a cursory view of each ns they were saddled. Amongst the favorites was Despot, who looked healthy in his coat, bnt did not appear to have dono sufficient work to enable liim to get to tho end of a fast ran two miles, and Lord ton. who succeeded, was, with Tom Brown, .big and above himself. Prometheus was also \- on the stout side, his infirmity having -evidently prevented his trainer giving Hum enough work, but First Chester -was bright nnd blooming, having apparently been . benefitted by his gallop on Saturday. Arsenal did not not look to bo nearly fit, and Lord Exeter. Cyclops. Blink Bonny, Bosworth, "Warwick nnd Thunderbolt appeared a bit en the stout side, -so fitter animals were in tho paddock than Grace Darling, Nordeufeldt and Wing ; and Kit Nubbles, Trenton. Cerise nud Blue, Brown and Rose. Metal and br. John looked) fairly well. The win ner. Sheet Anchor, had evidently dono a great preparation, and he walked about as quiet :is r> sheep, but in consequcuco of the rumors as to his having been badly beaten in a trial with Britisher ho attracted little attention from any ibut his immediate followers. Trenton's. lino shape and commanding appearance were pass ports to tho good opinion" of those capable of judging, and, thoughsomedoubtswere expressed ais to his condition being good enough to 'bring him home, it was generally conceded that if ho were really woll he ought to win easily. After the saddling tho horses, iu- Ktead of going on the courso by tho gate near tho river, went through the lane from tho weighing stand to tho judge's box, the first to appear being Lord Wilton, who was followed in rapid succession by Despot, Nordca- feldt, Grace Darling, First Chester, Britisher, Cyclops, Wing, Acolyte, St. Lawrence. Kit Nub bles, Liverpool, Brown and Rose, Yellow Ham mer, Sheet Anchor, Dunlop Velocipede snd St. John, the last one oat being Cerise and Bine. Nothing wont better in, the preliminary canters than Grace Darling, Wing, Trenton, First Chester, Liverpool, Britisher, St. John, Brown nnd Rose and "Minerva, but Acolyte was sore, and Kit Nubbles, Dunlop, Velccipcdo and plausible went in anything hut a taking style. Sheet Anchor only cantered slowly past the judge's box, bnt he went with great- -determination, and O'Brien wore a confident look as he trotted.down to the winning post. "In the market Nordenfcldt ietaine.1 the pride of place, 5 to 1 being the best offer, and Trenton was a decided second favorite at 7 to 1. Bes- pot was at tens, as was Liverpool and Kit 1 Nubbles. Stornaway, Grace Darliag, Sheet 1 Anchor, Acolyte and Brown and Rosa woie next in dornand. While varying prices down -to 200 to 1 Yellow Hammer, which was laid were on offer about ten others. Mr. G. Watson, who again offioiated as starter in his best style, marshalled tho fiold nt the post punc tually to time, and after two slight breaks away ho lowered his flag to a bcaatiiul start, ami Promitheus, Thunderbolt, First Chester, Nor- , uonfelit and Trenton, led pretty close to gether past the stand. The five named com prised the leading division along the hack and Thunderbolt bad an advantage to the abattoirs, where Cerise and Bine took up the running, and, coming to tho straight, appeared, to have all the others in trouble. Hero Britisher shut out, and he in his turn looked like, winning itntil he suddenly collapsed, and then his stable companion. Sheet Anchor, came with a rush, and. established hints-Mi at tho head. of affairs. Grace Darling, who was one of the two naer flTCf frftr.rt TtfUMwl . who had made up her ground in the most ex traordinary manner, then tried.to get up on the inside, but being twice disappointed, lost a considerable amount of ground- The mare, however, struggled on with tho utmost game- mess, and , though she could not quite get to Sheet Anchor's head, was only defeated by .scarcely a neck, while Trenton was a 'head nwav third. Such, a finish natu rally excited the greatest enthusiasm, and O'Brien, who had won his first 3IelbonrneCap, was heartily applauded as ho re turn ad to scale. Grace Darling ran a great inure under, difficulties, as she was shut in twice, and must have won with a little luck, while Kordenfeldt's performance was quite equal to his previous victories. Trenton also proved tho correctness oi his. running In tho Melbourne Ftakos, bnt Torn Brown. Acolyte, Kit Nubbles. Liverpool, Plausible, Stornaway, Despot, 'Brown and Rose, Warwick and other favorites wcro never dangerous. Tho new judge, who. \- previous to tho Cup had mado one or two mis takes. hoisted Blink Bonny, who was not amongst the first dozen, as the second horse ior that event, and the crowd again recog nised his incapacity by derisive. cheers. After putting up the wrong horses as , winner of the Derby, and- secoml in j the Cnp, not to speak of' other juUtakes, j it is not too much to" say that Mr. VTakcly has j proved his incompetency, and tho earner a : change is made tho better it will bo for tho j club and the more satisiactory.to horeo owners. - The winner of the Cup has proved himself to be | a sterling good horse, as ho has ran. third for j the Newmarket Handicap, second for. the Australian Cup and first m. tuo -uei- 1 bpurno Cup, all under decent weights, and his performances stamp him as one , uf the ! best of the many good Tssaiaoian horses which I licve performed in Victoria. By his victory j Ids party throw in for a good stake, hut the ) Tingm on "got well round with their books, and j the balance over tho race will bo against the | general public. After the oxcitcmcnt over the great race had subsided to some extent, twenty youngsters weighed out ior the Nursery Hanoi- ! cap, and Yellow Jacket was installed as first favorite. The good thin; came off, us the colt was in front all the. way. j nnd evcntuallv won by a couple of ! lengths from Retort. Clelia and the others, j Backers were also in the swim." in. the sue-, reeding race, the Yan Yean Stakes, when they Jacked Merrimu down to 2 to 1. and- dc- suite tho opposition offered by a large field, the Bon of Argus, Scandal, came through at. tho j distance, nnd won a fine race irom Cimckstcr ; by a head, at least so it was returned by the j judge, though to other observers it looked more j Ian half a length.
