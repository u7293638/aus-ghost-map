. MASS AT. THE MILITARY CAMP. ' ??'. 1500 M13K PRESENT. On Easter Sunday, by official invitation, the Right Rev. Monsignor O'Brien said Mass at the military encampment, Rookwood. An ' open' tent was set . apart for the celebrant, and the congregation knelt outside. Fully 1500 Catholic men attended — all branches of the service being represented — and many of the Protestant officers were also present. Just before Mass Captain Ferguson, A.D.C. to his Exeellency the Governor, with 100 of the newly - formed Australian Horse, rode up. The Captain — a Protestant — remained with. his men to the end of the Mass. At the Elevation all heads -were uncovered. It was a impressive scene. The Irish ltifl.es had a position near the tent. They had been on all-night ? duty, and had only two hours' sleep. Captain Freehill and Lieutenant J. L. Mullins sewed Mass, Monsignor O'Brien, speaking outside the tent, de livered a brief discourse. His words were clearly heard by all the men. The preacher dwelt specially on the solemn scene immediately following the Crucifixion, when the Centurion, seeing that Our Saviour had. given up the ghost, said, ' Indeed, this man was the Son of God.' Before and after Mass the Irish Rifles Band played 'Faith of Our Fathers,' and other hymns. Monsignor O'Brien lunched with the officers, one of whom pleasantly remarked, ?' What an immense congregation you had ; at our Anglican service we ? had barely 500.' ? -A report was circulated on Good Friday night that 50 of the Irish Rifles had left the Encampment on account of the ' short rations' trouble. This looked like desertion. Some fifty men of the Irish Corps did leave the camp, but with the permission of their officers. These men were told by their employers in the city that unless they turned up to work on Saturday they would forfeit their places. All returned to camp on Saturday evening.
