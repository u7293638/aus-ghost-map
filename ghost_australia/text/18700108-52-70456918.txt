SPORTS ON THE MELBOURNE CRICKET GROUND. About 8000 persons assembled on Boxing Day at tho above ground to witness tho sports. It was also tho first appearance of tho English pedestrians, who were announced to go through their training exorcises during tho intervals between tho races. Harris, tho oolonial champion, was placed at scratch in two races, but did not appear. After the first event, Hewitt and Bird carno out of tho pavilion, and took a little exorciso round tho ground. Tho pace thoyl went at, however, was slow, and tho public gained very little idea of what either is capable of doing. Enough, however, was done to show that tho style of English pedestrians is widely different from that of tho colonials, and no doubt some of the latter picked up a wrinkle or two from tho little they wore permitted to seo. Topley's performance was watohed with more interest and curiosity, and his stylo callod for loud demonstrations of approba tion. He did a milo at a very good pace, and the man ner ho got over tho ground, fair heel and too, was mag nificent. Topley is a littlo pocket Hercules, and is generally allowed to bo tho best and fairest walkor tho old country ever- produced. It may bo remembered that ho and "Westhall aro tho only two men who have ever walked 21 miles within three horns. The foUow is the order of tho running : 4'14 YAKDS HANDICAP FLAT BACK.

Dillion, 120 yards This Vas the sensational race of the day, and created great arlemont, although some disappointment was felt at Frilay and Chapman doohning to go for it. Harwood ?w^s novor approached, and took all the ' obstacles'^ with ease. Thoso consisted of planks on an inohno, wity a corresponding fall, and with sufficient steam being got «p seemed easily surmounted. There wore two falls, however. Tho water jump was a mis nomer, as, instead of the planks being narrow and the water deep, planking was put under tho shallow water, and the 3ump was pla^i jU8t beforo it. This was a mistake, and wo imdorta^i^H be rectified next timo. TT would bo somji,-oW!iterivent in going ovor planks of 2 f eet or 18 niches wide, with tho risk of a bath if the bioycle were not steered straight, and at the same time less chance of damago to machino or ridor.
