Mac groarty police-magistrate on Monday, the 21st instant, into the murder of George Foster alias George Donnelly or the "Flying Cook," whose body was found within 200 yards of the Carriers' Arms Hotel at the twelve mile on the previous morning. Sergeant Ferguson gave the following evidence:—About 10 o'clock yes terday morning William Jones, a publican re siding at the Twelve-mile, reported that about half-past 5 o'clock that morning while out look ing for some horses he came across the dead body of a man a short distance from his own hotel at the junction of the Cloncurry and Mornington roads and that he believed he had been murdered by the blacks; I proceeded at once to the scene of the murder and examined the body; I found six cuts on the face and throat; one was a deep cut on the upper jaw and cheek-bone, severing a portion of the nose; it would be 2in. or 3in. deep and 3in. or 4in. long; the next was a deep cut between the lower lip and the point of the chin, almost severing the chin from the face; both these cuts were evidently inflicted by a sharp tomahawk ; besides these there were four parallel cuts on the throat, some of them deep enough to lay the windpipe bare; these seemed to be inflicted by a sharp knife; there was also a small wound on the right collar- bone; the wounds on the face would be suf ficient to cause death; the wounds all seemed to be inflicted by some person standing on the right side of the body; the body lay on its back, the head pointing towards the road and the feet towards the river; the deceased had nothing on but a print shirt, and no trousers or swag could be found, but from a tree near were suspended some cooked beef and a few johnny cakes; near the body I found a small folding mirror, and inside of it a cheque for £1, drawn by Stuart Russell Bros., on the Queensland National Bank, Normanton, in favour of "Cash;" before I reached the spot a heavy shower of rain had fallen, and no traces of footprints could be seen; the deceased was apparently about 28 years of age; I did not know the deceased when alive; a cable and anchor was tattooed on the right fore-arm, and a cross on the left. William Jones, the publican, in his evidence said: From the appearance of the ground about I should say the murder had been committed by the blacks, there were barefooted tracks of from twelve to twenty people round about; the tracks came from the direction of the public house but they could not be traced going from the body; saw the deceased about 10 o'clock the night before at Pearce's Hotel; knew him only as "George," or George Don nelly; the blacks have been about the Twelve- mile of late, and on Saturday night two zinc buckets and three or four pounds of suet were stolen from my kitchen Anothei lnqutiy was held b) Mr Gicen avviij, water police magistinfc on boor c1 the steamer Gunga on Tucsda),. the 22nd instant, into the death of i hi oman named Suker Mihomed, who swallowed a qiiantitj of car bohc acid on the Satmday pteviou«, and died iftei hilf an boni s agon) It appealed from the cv idenee that deceased aftei coming up fiom the engine loom took hold of a pint pot vi Inch was neill) full of em bobe acid and 1 efore he could be mfoiiiied of the nature of its contents poured the whole down lus tin oat An emetic was given to him bv enc of the ofhceis but it failed to have anj effect The ileconsed was a native of Calcutta and was about 2t> ) eui s of age lheie is no nason victibedfoi lus drinking tho poison, md the supposition is that ho mistook it foi watei The Gunga steamet is gaining foi hei self an unenviable notoutti for casiultus of a fatal chirjctei lust,.the enptun took bei ou a piospicting tom among the islands of JNew Guinea instead of 'lliuisday Island, and naiiowlv escaped having her vviceked, then one of tho passciigcis jumped overboard as u means of putting an end to Ins existence next, the second steward took a lit and died in i few minutes the coolie hi email swallowed caibohc acid and gave up the ghost at once and the next day the stew ml was nuudered b) the ing"or Apait from nauticil supeistition, the Qb> Compati) might m ungo to pince a moie toni foi table boat on the tropical watcis of the Gulf th in the Gunga The "Noiiuans have boen von active of late in the wav of meetings, hut the lesults eau onh be mticipated lhere was an inflti n'inl meeting held about establishing a local hos nital, and £4o0 was subscribed in the room The speakers wen not ver) eloquent but the) spoke a good deal of tmth about the vv mt of i doctoi and the ticatment of sick men m the tow n It is a matter of fact that in some of the lowei class public houses there have been two or three case» of death from actual neglect A meeting was held at Mr Jamiison's Hotel a few da) s ago for the purposo of hav ing a reading room established m tho town. £200 was subscribed, and the Govornmi.ni-1.
