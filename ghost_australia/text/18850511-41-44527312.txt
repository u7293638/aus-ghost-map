THE ADELAIDE CUP; , TEE SOUTH. AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB AUTUMN MEETING [By Telegraph.] [From gut own Reporter.! Melbourne, May 10. iiie fcoutn Australian Jockey Club were lucky in postponing the running of the Adelaide Cup until Saturday, as although the weather was cloudy and dull there was no_ return of rain, and the fact of the day .bcisg a half-holiday had a material effect upon the attendance. Neither of the stands were fall, but still they presented a very respectable appearance at the time the Cap was run, and I have no doubt the club will sustain no loss over the meeting. The pro gramme was spoilt by the retention of two such paltry races as the Maiden Plate and the Selling Hurdle Race, but the Adelaide Cap was one of the moat interesting handicaps o ; the season, and the excitement of this con test fully compensated for the other short comings in the card. The victory of Lord 'Wilton was very popular, as the son of Countryman throughout his career has been cce of those consistent performers which the public, follow, and every one was heartily pleased to see him break the spell of bad luck which has attended him in important races dnrisg the past twelve months. Mr. Ellis ?won about £3,GG0 by the success of his torse, and several others threw in for fair stakes, but the bulk of the money was won in Email amounts by the public. Three very moderate animals faced the starter for the Maiden Plate, and odds were laid on Hampstead, but he refused to try at any part of the race, and Capri won as he liked. Despite the heavy state of the ground Jnanna was saddled up for the Nursery Handicap, and well backed into the bargain. At five furlongs she was going at well as anything, but the weight told in the final struggle, and the well handicapped Remus drew away and won. easily a length from Honeycomb, Ulalume, and Delanii, who finished together. An hour elapsed between this race and the Cnp, and during the interval some heavy investments were made in favour of Welcome Jack, who came from 20 to 1 to 10 to 1 before the flag fell. When seen the Maori crack was not liked, as he looked too big to race. Conjecture was trained to the hour, and remained a hot favourite to the finish, while Britisher and Lantern kept their places in public favour. The most popular horse in the paddock, however, waa Lord Wilton, and the anxiety to get on the handsome chestnut caused him to advance to 8 to 1. Pro metheus was lame, and friendless in consequence, but the owner of Plausible supported his horse freely. Nothing in the lace looked better than Sardius, but nobody cared to back him owing to the feeling that he was held .safe by Lantern. The parade was led by Prometheus, Lantern, and Ruby, the last three to tile through the gate on to the course being Britisher, Hobart, and SardiuH. The preliminary canters having been got through, Mr. Watson took them in charge, and after Plausible and Conjecture had caused some delay the flag fell to a good Etart. Lantern was; on his legs racing while the others were thinking about it, and lie made play to the River turn before Hicholson could pull him back and allow Conjecture to go on in command. The favourite was never allowed to get far away, as Prometheus and Hazard stuck to her like leeches, and six furlongs from home the much-vaunted sister to Guess work threw up the sponge, and retired to the rear. Hazard was then left with the lead, but Lantern and Britisher quickly cut him down, and as they eniered the straight it looked odds on one of the two winning, No eooner were they in, a line for home, however, than Lord Wilton— who had been in a good position all the way— and Anchorite joined issue, and with their advent first Britisher and then Lantern died out, without being able to offer the famtestresistanoetothenew-comei'3, who went on together for a few strides, whea Lord Wilton, answering gamely to the whip, shook off his antagonist and won by alength. ^ardins, who was interfered with at the sheds, came with a grand rush when ha got clear, and was only beaten by half a length, by Anchorite, \\* hile Plausible also showed a bold front in the last part of the race. The winner was loudly cheered, and so was Sardius, whose splendid performance was a great satisfaction to his owner, and trainer, more especially as he confirmed the trial with Lantern. Whatever chance the latter had ?a as ruined by Nicholson righting with him all the way, instead of letting him sail along in front. The time waa very fast consi dering the state of the ground. After the race Mr. Watson had Moore before the Stewards for disobeying orders it the post, and the jockey was disqualified for three months. The Hurdle Race fell through, but a good field of sixteen saddled up for the Flying Handicap. Gymkhana being thrown into the handicap she was installed fiist favourite, but she could never go the pace, and after Mi3s Merlin had made all the running Middlemarch caught her at the lawn and romped home a ridiculously easy winner. During the afternoon the dispute between the club and Mr. Biackler w.-.s satisfactorily arranged. The following is a description of the running :— M.UDEN' riATE.

Entering the course proper Juanna looked all over a winner, but she tired as they came on. and a?, the distance Remus and JJelainia wers well ahead of TJI&iume;, Jnanna, and Honeycomb. From this out Remus kept a' slight advantage, and Delaraia, stopping to nothing in the lust few [strides, was beaten oat of a place by Honeycomb and Ulalume, who finished together a .'ength behind Remus. De'araia was only a head from the dead-heaters, with Juanna fifth, the lot Leing whipped in by Arsenal, Gaabarner, and Can dace. Time, 1 min. -0 sec ADELAIDE CfP.

Betting— 3 to 1 agst. Conjecture, 4 to 1 Britisher, 5 to 1 Lantern, 8 to 1 Lord Wilton, 10 to 1 Welcome Jack, 12 to 1 Sardios, li to 1 Madcap, 20 to 1 each Camerine, Prometheus, and Plaisible, 30 to 1 Anglesey, 33 to 1 each Grace Darliag and Anchorite, 50 to 1 each Hazard and Hobart. The start was delayed some little time owing to the fractiousness of Plausible and the anxiety on the part of IVIoore to get away with Conjecture. When the signal was given the lot were in very fair order, but Lantern went off the mark like lightning, and before they had gone fifty yards he was leading Lord Wilton and Conjecture by two lengths, with the others well together. Passing the Stand Lantern led Lord Wilton and Conjecture two lengths, -with Welcome Jack, Hazard, and Pro menheus together at the head of the others, the field being whipped in by Sardius, Anchorite, and i ohanna. Before they had rounded the first turn Bobart, who was running in the body of the field, fell, and interfered with the rearmost division, Sardius especially suffering. Lantern dashed past the wharf booth two lengths clear of Conjecture, on whose quarters was Lord Wilton, and then came Prometheus, Hazard, and Camerine, with the others well bunched. Bounding the river turn Nicholson succeeded in pulling Lantern back to his followers, and Conjecture went on in front, with Prometheus and Lantern together two lengths clear of Lord Wilton, behind whom came Britisher, Gohanna, and Hazard, the others being well bunched, with Grace Darling whipping in. Run ning along the back stretch Conjecture continued in command, with Prometheus at her girths and Lantern next, closely followed by Britisher, Go hanna, and Hazard, while the colours o£ Lord Wilton and Sardius were prominent at the head of the main body, the rearmost lot being whipped in by Welcome Jack, Anchorite, Anglesey, Ruby, and Grace Darling. Passing the bridge Prometheus had drawn almost level with Conjecture, and Hazard had taken third place, well clear of Lantein and Britisher still, anu two lengths bsbind this pair came Lord Wilton, Sardius, and Plausible. Between here and the abattoirs Hazard joined Cor-jecture and Prometheus, andthethreeran abreast for some little distance, with Lantern pulling double lying witti Britisher about two lengths frora the pair. At the sheds Hazard took a clear lead and both Conjecture and Prometheu3 retired. The rout of the favourite was most complete, as she dropped back -six or seven paces in as many strides. No sooner had Hazard taken first place than Lantern, going as strong as a lion, shot away from the rest of the Seld, and Anchorite's colours suddenly appeared at the heels of Britisher, while Lord Wilton took fifth place, Sardius, Plausible, and Madcap being the most prominent of the others. Racing down the bend Lantern and Britisher cut down Hazard, and with Lord Wilton and Anchorite in pursuit the two leaders rounded the turn side by side, both going well within them selves. Entering the straight Lantern and Britisher still held a clear lead of their pursuers, and for a few strides it looked a match between the pair, but directly Lord Wilton anil Anchorite challenged they were all abroad, and at the distance Anchorite and Lord Wilton were left in front with Sardius in hot pur suit. Anchorite stuck to Lord Wilton until the be ginning of the lawn, when he began to falter, and the chescut struggling on drew clear, and won rather cleverly by a good length. Sardius made up his ground in grand, style from the turn, and was only beaten by half a length for second place, while Plausible, who also came with a brilliant run in.the straight was a good fourth. Lantern was fifth, Britisher sixth, and Madcap seventh, the last three to pass the post being Ruby, Hazard, and Prometheus. Time, 2 min. 53J sec. WINNERS OK THE ADELAIDE CUP. Yr. ! Owner. | Winner.

A Revolution ey Marriage.— There is an interesting paper in the National Review which should make Mr. Hyndman think twice before he again declares the social revolution to be only attainable through bloodshed. The -writer, who signs himself a humble but Democratic Tory, shows us a much better way, bringing, indeed, not a sword, buttheoran^e wreath. All we have to do is to apply the law of z ompetitive examina tion to the law of marriage. All boys and girls in the country should be sent, of course, to the national schools, and the surviving of them to the universities, and then ' the man and the woman who siood aS the head of their respective lists in the examination would become husband and wife, and so on all down the list. It is thus obvious that the clever son of a shopkeeper might marry a duke's daughter, and that an earl might wed a farm servant's child.' This scheme is by no means altogether in the air, for already do not the girls who stand at the he.id of the examination-lists at Girton marry the men whose names are aDpended as examiners ? We wait for some of thesp ladies and gentlemen to subject the ingenious theory of the fictional Beckiccr to the test of experience.
