WHY WEDDINGS IN MAY ARE UNLUCKY. It has been considered unlucky to be married in May ever sinco the days of Ovid. In ancient Romo there was held in May a festival called the Leuiuria, or Feast of the Lemurcs, which wa8 a cere mony in honor of tho Speeches of Departed Souls. It became with the Romans what wc should call " bad form" to have matrimonial feasts at the season of a solemn ritual, being, no doubt, thought to be an insult to the dead to marry at such .1 time. From this u nurn* ber of stories grew of the revenga made by the outraged ghosts upon those who dared to disregard them, and if anything unfortuuate happened to a couple who had been married in May it wonld, of course, have been put down to retribu tion. So the tradition of ill luck arose, and its influence has lastad, ever since, even to our time.
