TUESDAY, MAY 28, 1889). There are two points in the elaborate judgment delivered against Mr. DALY yesterday by Chief Justice HIGINBOTHAM which challenge criticism, and as these determined the severity of the sentence an honest examination of them is a matter of no small importance in the last place, the Chief Justice seems to have placed an unnecessarily severe interpretation upon the unfortunate letter which "Mr DALY sent to the newspapers, and, in the second place, it may be argued that in weighing the penalty he has paid too little heed to the provocation given by Mr. Justice "WiLiiiYiss ill-advised speech after the trial of the last batch of the alleged perjurers We may assume that Mr DALY was technically or Donnally guilty of a contempt of Court His counsel, Mr Purvis, Yiitually admitted this much, testing the defence mainly on the contention that there had been no malicious intention, and that the for an offence was palliated by the remarks of a judge But, supposing an error to have been made, did it call for such a sentence as that which YYIS inflicted yesterday ? Chief TusticoJln INKOIHAYI IS housed at such pennies in Mr Dvn.-s letter as that the prisoners convicted before Mr. Justice A IILIAYIS had been unable " to say a word in their own defence, and that a " fearful and awful mistake of had ocean ed in a " one sided investigation " We certainly do not think that such language should be used by my solicitor, of that it was either wise or just I in it appears to be susceptible of a much milder explana- tion than that which is adopted in the judgment Ah DYIY could hardly have meant that the four and defended pi soldiers, were not allowed to say a word, for the Court is bound to receive any statement and to hear any defence that may be put forward it is more probable that he intended to convey the notion that in their honor ance they were unable to do for themselves what would have been done by practised counsel Even the most innocent man, if he is undefended, and if he is confronted with a case that has been laboriously) compiled against him by trained lawyers, tiny screw the roughly bewildered It in difficult for him to disentangle the true from the false to unravel all the threads of an circustances which envelop him as a matter of fact, it has been often found in experience that the hulk prisoner is the most voluble and tells the most plausible story), while the innocent man unaccustomed to the waYs courts is least able to defend himself And Chief Justice His iMioiiHYt should, at least have given due j canneries to the more lenient interpretation which lies on the very surface of Ah UM Y s letter But further, we find that these phrases in the denounced letter refer to Tunis which had been completed and sentences which had actually been passed by Mr Justice WILLIAMS It is true that \h THEY made an allusion to the other cases which were then awaiting trial ; but his language is for the most part directed to the fit-- cases which lately been finished, and in which the prisoners had been found guilty. NOW, the Chief Justice himself admits that those were perfectly open .'toÛJubriiiVieiit. '"As no injuries " tion," he says, appears to have been " been given by the. Court forbidding " the publication of evidence until the " conclusion of all the cases, the 'cows " ductors of the newspapers were under " no legal obligation to abstain from comments on the past trials." J n other words, the " past trials," the cases tried before Mr. Justice WILLIAMS, were legally open to public criticism. What, then, is-Mr. DALY'S especial fault that he should be visited with a month's imprisonment ? He may have gone to fur, and written in bad taste ; but if bad taste is to be treated as contempt of Court, the gaols of the colony will hardly hold the people who may be liable to conviction during the next month. Mr. DALY was certainly a solicitor under the jurisdiction of the Court, but there is no rule to prevent a, solicitor from criticising trials that are completed. It is said, however, that the strong language, though it was primarily used of past trials, was fitted to prejudice the conduct of the cases that had not been presented before the Court at the time. In this respect Mr. DALY may fairly claim that the same discrimina- tion should be allowed to him which is given to Mr. Justice WILLIAMS. It is a demonstrable fact that Mr. Justice WILLIAMS referred not only to the five prisoners who were convicted, but declared that nine prisoners, four of whom had not been tried, might have been charged with conspiracy. Undoubtedly the severest remarks in his sensational speech were levelled at the five convicted prisoners, but, at the same time, he did explicitly refer to the others. On this awkward, position Chief Justice HIGINBOTHAM: declares that the judge's observation was " limited to the cases of the five " men who were being sentenced " for perjury. Taken by itself, " it had no reference to the cases " yet to be heard, and it is an " likely that any prejudicial effect " would be created by it." But this very argument applies with equal, or perhaps with greater force to Mr. DALY'S letter. We are just as much entitled to say that that gentleman's strictures upon the past trials could not prejudice those which were to come on. If extreme prominence is given to the fact that the bulk of Mr. Justice AViM.iAMfs's charges were strictly confined to the convicted men, then a like prominence should be given to the fact that Mr. J") \LY was simply making an answer in regard to the very same cases. Moreover, Mr. Justice WILLIAMS Yvont out of his way to insinuate a charge which did not appear upon the sheet. The prisoners were arraigned for perjury ; he gratuitously informed them that they might have been accused of conspiracy. The Chief Justice explains that this was a " hypothetical .' charge," and, therefore, of no weight. But what business has a judge who is trying a definite matter to introduce " hypothetical charges " which, though they may be of little account in themselves, are almost bound to influence the public '; Chief Justice HitUNüOTiiAJt must be well aware that such remarks are apt to have a great effect. It is notorious, at any rate, that Mr. Justice WILLIAMS'S sensational speech did attract a large amount of attention, and called forth notices from the press, and influenced the people in many ways. No one imagined that he was merely playing with a hypothetical case ; everybody believed that, speaking from his place on the bench, he had real and reasonable grounds for his utterances. The truth is that there is too great a tendency on the part of the judges to deliver harangues on general principles. If they begin to give an example of premature commenting, others are certain to follow in their steps, and, though they may be guilty of some technical offence, they can never be considered as morally blameworthy And if, under such circumstances, the power of committing for contempt of Court is severely exercised, there will be an outcry for a change that will to some extent shake public confidence in the administration of justice. We have given the judges great powers and privileges ; we expect that these will be used with discretion. In July last, when the speculation foreruns approaching its highest point, the members of the Melbourne- Stock Exchange floated their association into a limited company, and 00,000 shares were offered to the public at 10s. per share. No fewer than 1,240,575 ivens applied for, and on allotment there were HIIIOH at considerably above JOs. Vcatortlay, how citY, the company was wound up in silence. Ten months ago the bank at which applications were lodged was thronged by a multitude whose temper recalled descriptions of the mad rush for South Sea stock in the last century. Yesterday the few disconsolate persons who had the misfortune to be shareholders in the concern, and who were not entirely bereft of fortitude, said " Pty " with one voice to the proposal to put up the shutters. Vast promises were made in the prospectus of the press which was to accrue to the proprietors from a participation in the brokerage receipts, but in January last the total receipts from commissions was but state gs. and,, in February 4123 as. 'Id., in March 26 f>s, ski,, and in April 54s. -4d. FOR the last Huco months in which business was done the receipts from this source were equal to about I per cent, per annum on the capital invested. For the marvellous concession which the promoters made to the public they received GOODE shares paid up to 10s. in return the contributing slmtoholdor.s have not only obtained nothing, but such of them as held on to their stud: have had to pay a call of five shillings per share to enable them to keep on the register. All those facts are instructive. They point to a time and to state of society which one would fain regard as beyond the dark ages, but which are comprehended in a retrospect five glance extending. no further back I lion 10 months ago. It is not desirable that they should be easily or quickly forgotten. J F pondered over, Choy become one .>i'-_sive, and convey a lesson which -OHIO day may he thought to have been cheap at the price. Yet it was not for the lack of warning that investors rushed for the shares. When the prospectus was issued and imaginations were heated, wo though- it li-coaseiry to say that " the " public are asked to present £30,000 " (not to speak, of the premium to " which the shares have been rushed) for " consideration of an unknown value." The) value has since been ascertained, and the shareholders no sooner acquired the knowledge than they united in demanding the winding up of the concern. It may be Hiunfaetory to them to be promised it division of' " respectably) assets," to use the words of the chairman at the, meeting yesterday, and it is to be hoped that the liquidation will result in some LI refusals to those feelings and modify the bitterness with which they may be tempted to regard the Melbourne Stock Exchange They will, no doubt, subscribe to MIGUHHS dictum that the 1 car til hirth bubbles as the water line, " and these are of them.

the election of these should be postponed until at least as much of the cathedral itself is finished as would be available for holding service in? the cathedral election board are admitted in want of funds at present, and the final completion of the building may write a long way off It might be good policy, therefore, if all the money now available were to be devoted to completing a portion of the building, leaving the western finished as fresh funds come in To hold divine service within the cathedral would be the best and most effective way of attracting contributions towards its completion Woraluppors would then be able to see for themselves what was wanted, and would thus be incited to provide the means for supplying it If possible, by far the boat we by out of the present difficulty would seem to be that the church should be allotted toleman where it is until the congregation could be accommodated within the walls of the cathedral But if, unfortunately, this cannot be carried out, it is at least to be hoped that some compromise in by yet be discovered which shall give the chapter what is absolutely necessary to them without inflicting upon the con legation as much hardship as the present scheme appears to involve To day, if all goes well, Melbourne people will have an opportunity of seeing H M S Calliope, and of welcoming the officers and crew who have made their ship
