A REMARKABLE FAMILY. Tim most remarkable family that Alabama ever produced was the Knight family, who lived three miles from St. Stephen's. John Knight was tho father of twenty-eight children. He was a fine specimen of physical manhood. He stood 6ft. 7 in. in his stocking feet, and his voice was like that of the lion's roar. His wife, the mother of those twenty-eight children, was less than five feet in height, and weighed about 1001b. Standing side by side her head scarcely reached his vest pocket. They were both industrious, and when their children got old enough to talk they were put to work. There was no loafing or indolence tolerated on the Knight plantation. Everyone had to rise with the dawn of day. There were eighteen boys and ten girls. The males inherited their father's physical prowess, the females their mother's diminutive size. LORD FITZHARDINGE, better known as Sir Alaurice Berkeley, was, like bis predecessors, a devoted champion of the huntingfield. In addition to being a capital rider he was a thoroughly practical man as a sportsman, and in breeding hounds entertained the same views as the previous earl, who did not fancy any dog-hound above twentythree inches, and cared more about the work they got through than their symmetry. "f don't care for all their looks," he went on to say; " huntsmen forget to breed hounds for their nosesâ€”they're all for looks. Give me the pack that will kill foxes." "DID you ever see a ghost ?" " Once." " Were you scared ?" "Was I scared? Was I? My false teeth were in a glass on a table three feet away from the bed, and they actually rattled so loud that they woke the neighbours.''
