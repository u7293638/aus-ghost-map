PICTURESQUE VICTORIA. BY TELBBAcnrjs. OUT ON THE WATERSHED No III. Up the gorge of the gloom, the narrow channel cut out of the tremendous forest, we approach the digger sharpening his picks at the hut door, and he rises to receive us courteously, as a patriarch of old, who should entertain angels unawares Unwashed, un- shaven, and marvellously apparelled, our appearance must have been as far removed from the angelic as was our miner's from the patriarchal. For he was an Australian native of 40 or thereabouts, but with five and twenty years of digging experience Twenty - five years of independent pioneering, that is, which have rendered himperfectlycourteous, years absolutely free of the slightest sense of inferiority to any living human creature as the Indian sachem, or the old-time, Maori chief, or the back-block stockman. The digger in the forest, and the stockman out on the bound- less plain, are good specimens of Australian life. They should be brought down and set up somewhere in the courtyards of the Exhibition, but no one would understand them unless they were set also in proper surroundings a few junks of the forest about the digger, a few square miles of the plains before the stockman, and, not less difficult, the proper atmosphere about each The ong, rank, dark, think woodwalk" leading up to the digger ; the desert mirage, or the broad day swooning on the red ox taste, to the stockman In these men and these things are the true Australian sentiment , that if you would know, you must go to them, for they will never come to you. "Sit ye down," says the digger, "and I'll put on the billy." Are you hungry 2 There, is a bit of bacon there and the tail end of a loan! Diggers never spoil their digestion with damper, You are sure you've had a bite' If it had been his last bite, and he had known positively that his mate would not return for four and twenty hours, he would still have persisted, and have chased you with his pick-handle had you offered him a sovereign at parting While the billy boiled, and later while the tea cooled (the one process is almost as tedious as the other) we yarded of all the diggings of the mountains, and of the old ways and the new. The old bush mines can endure anything but the sepulchre ways of the new mines, with their worse than charnel odours, and talks pitifully of the poor ghosts of creatures who labour there, taking in slow poison in James of rocks rock and dynamite and other giant powders things which should be used with care, and not without reason, in underground workings, for their effect, if continuous, is almost deadly on the stoutest constitution. "We have to stand a bit of it now and then ; sometimes there isn't a speck of luck In a year's prospecting', and than there is nothing left but wages " Here is the beginning of another year, and of the spending of the results of another year of toil maybe To-morrow the two mates will shoulder their picks and axes and enter then to the thickest jungle of the deepest gorge , they will cut a road through the hazel and feel it way through the gums, and seek day after day for some outcrop of rock that may be the matrix of gold And then begins the resolute attack.

Do not " The bodies and the bones of those XI he sought In other day is to pass, Lie v thence In the thickets close, Or bleaching on the dewy grass' (Mere are the men of the fifties, the pioneers of the last generation, the boys of the old brigade ' A handful, a remnant growing daily less, have mellowed into tv lirusperoas life, but where are the multi miles'' It matters not, it does not concern one jot the diggers of the present. The proverb is ever in their minds "The nam fail, the low succeed .

To wAr' why is' almost equivalent to asking one to set a limit to the possibilities of human folly WE asked ourselves why * 'Wartherearty danger in the live boughs over hanging the road Would any burden of snow bring them down. It so there was far more likelihood of a dead though saturated with rain falling Did the trees themselves look dangerously like coming down all across the road Not a bit. They seem rooted to stand for a thousand years Had a malignant madman escaped from Bedlam, and wandered through the mountains with an axe, mistaking all the big trees for his late keepers' We came on an oldroidraan next day, and demanded of him a reason, and he gave one. "The bark do be coming down, and littering the road, and when the tree be dead there be no more bark." That is true, of course, and we had better ride army in haste and digest it, or we might be disposed to demand of the old man if he was the author of that truth, and then he himself might be no more. At the foot of the mountain, in a hollow of the hills, an upper basin of the Steavenson River, is the hamlet of Marys die If any fair Mary was responsible for her own surname she would surely have made it Marydale of Mary glen, or Mary valley or Marys and What bourgeois creature insisted on bringing "tille' out here' We cross the brawling Steaven- son on a little bridge, or we can ford it with ease on the shining pebbly bed, and we ride up a street that seems permeated with scents and overshadowed with the sentiments of autumn. It was evening, of course, the autumn of every day, and all the willow leaves were falling and rustling yellow or were on the damp footpaths, and if it was fancy, or if there were some quince orchard near, I know not, but there seemed all about the place a scent as of (lying lem es and of apples that had ripened almost to decay on the boughs. We could hardly discern the cap of the cathedral spire on the Cathedral flange, and all down the lower lands which slope to the Goulburn there were mists and coming darkness and coldness?, and showers, and the sort of thing calculated to give a fellow who has got to camp out, and alone, most intolerable "blues." But our bourne was near. The lights of the hostel gleamed, the horses pricked up their ears, the groom appeared for them and the maid of the in the us, and in five minutes all the autumn sadness was outside and we were enjoying winter cheer within Morris Keppel's inn is known to 10,000 people, for it has stood there by the Stsaveii son River for a good many years, and has always kept up its reputation You might die from its visitors' books almost, if you had lunched substantially at midday 'I hey seem to savour so strongly of the comfortable digestion of good dinners. Like the boxes at the "Cock," to which Will Water proof did most resort, they are Landed with the steam of forty thousand dinners " I don't think, however, we bothered much with the books till after dinner We had not touched. Had that charming princess of " La Mascotte " asked us "Can you cut a leg of mutton at a meal, we should have replied, unblushingly and with perfect candour, "Princess, we can " And we did, and shortly after went to sleep States east of fact, at which any man who has had similar experiences will not be surprised. The morning is glorious at Marysville, and so was the breakfast at Host Keppel's. We were up by times and out and about a little, looking at the bath, a novelty in its way, for a pipe head of water brought from the river flows quite through it It is, in fact, a swimming bath, and is said and looks to be Dit. deep I don't think any one of the three of us could give positive evidence on that point, for there was hoar frost on the wet ground without, and we left one after the other with the remark that it was an excellent institution for the summer months. JJrcukfuBt is more to our taste in the winter, and there ready on the tick of 8, according to promise, was the jingle jungle of the bell, and there was our maid of the inn, looking really as cherry - checked and bright as it she swam in that cold bath every morning of the year and walked to the top of the Cathedral Range after. And they gave us a dish of steak, steaming hot and tempting, and plates that could hardly be touched with impunity, and we looked at the steak and divided it evenly, thinking it was only lack ing in quantity, and marvelling it half a dozen eggs, which already appeared, would be sufficient to-well, top up with But our doubts on this matter were hardly resolved when another dish cover made its appearance, and another steak, not quite so large as the first, hue equally hot and juicy and tender, and just big enough to afford us perfect satisfaction, and leave room for the eggs That hot and hot following was more like the traditional style of the good old 1 English inn than any thing I remember in Australia, and the steak itself was, I think, the second best Bred, fed, and killed in the district, ignorant of all travel, torture, fever, beef steak is a thing to be desired, beloved, and remembered The very best I ever ate Mas 100 miles north of the Darling River, cut from a carcase hang- ing on the gallows not more than five miles from the fattening n Baldock, and grilled on myall could, without any assistance of a gridiron It was just the same beef we get in Melbourne, bar the filling and the harassment Again we have a long day, and again we must start early Therefore the horses are out immediately breakfast is over, and full fed with corn, and eager with the cold that milk, the blood prickle- along all their veins, ready for a hunt after anything With the sun then just slanting along the work, and all the dew drops shining, and all your blood glowing, and a perfectly satisfactory breakfast just completed, and your pipe alight and drawing splendidly, and your horse keen but not boisterous, cannot you enter with all your heart into that sentiment w Inch Alfred Cellier has put into his "Dorothy" hunt well song " Aunt ' and ' it is our hunting dat, And the early dawn of the autumn morn is ready to show us the tt a) ? ' We were going n hunting, n hunting of a waterfall Across the 10 id, along the foot of the mountain, and up the Stevenson Valley There is a good bridle track on the way, but it is bordered and overhung in places with fern and scrub growth, and the wet wattle slaps you in the face as you gallop past and the broad fern fronds shower down baptism as your pace causes their trunks to vibrate, and the hazel sprays switch, and the broad leaves of the blanket scrub drench you, but what does it matter, you rattle on Down in the valley the water voice is ringing ; fur aloft the magpie You see the mountain wall to the left till glow, and down below the frequent flash and (gleam of the river water through the nodding plumes of the ferns, the stately heights of the gums, their trunks nil Silver, the beaded crocus and spears of bench and arsenical, till the wealth indent of a rich mountain valley close to your side, and immediately bein nth your eye But the track becomes narrower now, and a louder water voice is heard leaving ahead, and the crown of the bald head of the gorge is seen, and we watch for the silver streak of the fall It appears at length and suddenly, and justifies its voice. It is not a simple tall over a 1 ill's edge to a black rock basin below, but a series of plunges, leaps, bountlH, cataracts.oftendivldcd stud broken by jutting points and steps of the lock, and bordered from the summit to the base with fern and scrub foliage Its voice ' Is not thunderous, though touring ; a pleasant melodious sort of your, such the amount ate breeze uiakeBiimong thrill to US, 6th it is not silver or silver grey when in shadow from its first plunge over the topmost ledge till its wild rush beneath the fern tree screen at its base. There are rainbows when the sun works round, " Sleet of diamond drift and pearly rain," and other marvels of beauty common to all instances of falling water, and I should imagine from the £100ft. of broken rock face and some notion of the gathering ground above that, when a thunderstorm sends down three inches of rain in half an hour, and every hillside yields its sheet of water, and all converging above, plunge and thunder down, there must be grandeur of eight and sound such as is hardly approached elsewhere in the mountains some- thing to almost justify quotation of the wild and beautiful words of "Manfred."

And to and fro, like the pale coursers tall The cUntstccd to be beatrodeby death, As told in the Apocalypse To hunt for a waterfall and wait for a thunderstorm are not, however, to be accomplished in one day and one day's journey. We did not either want a thunderstorm We had the Black Spur to cross and Mount Juliet to climb, and also we had to return to the inn and say farewell to our homes, or, to put it in a more practical way, perhaps, strap in our x arises and pay the reckoning But there was a little bit of courtesy which is not quite in the ordinary way of Australian bush life about that simple operation lou generally got away from a bush hotel after shouting for the boss , but Here was our maid of the inn, the daughter of the house, with three little posies all drenched in dew " There are not many now," says Mrs. Keppel, "but there are always violets, and the big cloth of gold over the verandah bears blossoms nearly every month in the year" ' Doubtless, but the little lady's cheeks there bear roses all the months in the year ' Wherewith, there seemed to be a sudden infusion of carmine to the roses last mentioned, and with our posies beneath our noses we rode away up the hill There is not much to be seen after the first rise and fill out of Marysville You drop to the Acheron River and valley, and traverse a sterile and wilderness like waste, with occasional farms, which do not look too prosperous, and square miles of bark ringed timber, beneath which suckers have shot up high and dense as mallee scrub You cross creeks and rivers enough, for all the country is well watered, and at length you begin the ascent of the spur, at whose other side is Fern shows The scenery changes with the soil Wherever throughout the southern colonies of Australia trap rock has at any time been deposited by volcanic overflow or upheaved by earthquake action there is luxurious growth if nature has been allowed to run wild, and amazing fertility if there have been any attempts at cultivation. We cross in a halt dozen strides, mounting the spur from scrub and heath and stunted gum and box to the lords of the forest with all their luxurious undergrowth, and round a bend near the summit we come on it gorge Tilled full of beauty, which leads up to the almost perfect cone of Mount Dom Dom, some four miles away A few judicious use strokes are badly wanted here again not in the way of ring barking, but toppling two or three trees by the roadside right over into the gorge, where the scrub growth would speedily bury them If three trees were be removed, an uninterrupted view would be obtained of a valley and mountain which were designed by nature to prompt and gratify the painter's art. Just exactly suited to a moderate canvas, and not be stupendously grand as to scare away a modest una conscientious painter A little farther on we have to sec saw about to get a fair look at the Cathedral, and here also a little judicious clearing would afford as much relief and assistance These affairs appear to be in the category of nobody's business. I wish somebody would take them up before the springtime, and send a couple of axemen round to clear out views for the Exhibition visitors. More could be done up here for a £10 note than in Carlton gardens for £10,000 We must ride slowly down this spur which all the world knows, and say a little of the beauties which have found many chroniclers, if few interpreters The Black Spur, as ordinarily understood, is a misnomer. It was not originally the Black, but the Blacks' Spur, a place of rendezvous for the blacks, a camping, lulling, hunting ground, and a place of refuge perhaps when the white men begun to take up the Hats from the sea and push the old inhabitants back and back into the mountains and the inland wildernesses The road comes down the main ridge, to the right is Myrtle Creek, and to the left the valley of the Watts All the beauties of typical fern tree gullies are crowded around, and the mr is musical with the sound of running waters There are occasional glimpses of peculiar beauty in the groupings of myrtle, sassafras, and fern, and treasures in mosses trailing down like beards of fairy men from the myrtle boughs But the one supreme view is, I think, from a little bit of open ground about half way between the the first and second mile stones out of Fern blouse The long perspective of the valley, sloping gently upwards, Spear like, opens thence, spread with all its wealth of foliage, as if with intent of full display. Sassafras, round crowned lightwood and beech, careless graceful wattle and fan like ferns, arranged and unfolded as a perfect leaf in nature's book of beauty Beyond and above which, as a rough sheet from nature larger book of grandeur, a mountain side with a mighty forest stretching upward to the blue. The great forest is seen there as now here else in the ranges, perhaps The tall trunks are ranged as soldiers in a giant arms, and seem to mass and close as the eye endeavours to penetrate their depths It might be described as a specimen plot of the Big Bush arranged for public inspection, Nature is kind and considerate in this way at times, and has been specially thoughtful, of those tourists who like to take the height of steep mountains and the depths of rugged gorges as stated, in her architecture on the Black Spur. Anti in the valley of the Watts also, which is traversed a considerable distance by Morley's track, there have been placed some of the most wonderful fern I glades of the world broad terraces, where one sees the sunbeams strike beneath the fronds, and light on the rich brown trunks of an upper tier, while all below is in shallow. There are giant trees also the Watts, about which, in the summer time, you may drive in a buggy, and bowels and harbours at the extremities of open dells, where all that could be desired in the way of surrounding fur a summer picnic or encampment is provided. And winding about the valley goes the Watts, the main river of the second watershed, wisely reserved for the city. And just at the mouth of the valley is the township of Fernshaw, the about to be deserted village Plainly enough, the place is done! All the gardens are overgrown with weeds, all the walls are shedding their paint coats, moss is growing on the roofs, and in one or two deserted huts the windows were broken The place is doomed, yes, to destruction, and the landlord out in the road there, to-disappointment. For the two coaches have met, and both are empty. But why can't we stay and eat' His 1 o'clock-a fair and proper time to eat, and vigorously, and for the second time, in the bush "Well," said Mr. Davidson, "do you want to go up that mountain's' "Yes, but what has that to do with dinner' Dinner is n ade, and the mountain can wait " " It is a long way up that mountain, and the horses can't get all the way , we shall have to climb 1200ft. ' "Well" It is bad riding down an incline of two in one after dark, and there is a boggy part to come through at the bottom , besides, no want to look about a bit on the top " We wanted dinner, too, but at length agreed to a compromise of 10 minutes only, with bread and cheese and beer, and then for Mount Juliet, We did wisely and well, as all acknowledged in the evening Two o'clock saw us off the main track, and following' a bare! line through the scrub. Nothing formidable for the rat half mile only steadily up, up, up and yet the horses begun to blow, and before another mile was passed to punt and labour. The hills became magnified, too, all around us, as surrounding hills always do in rapid ascent, and yet we could not doubt but that we were gradually overtopping some that appeared fairly elevated from the base. steeper and steeper It became. We counted the distance by trees now-trees' heights, that is. " One more, and we shall come to the springs.wherethehorans must be left." The horses, poor brutes, were glad to hear that, and laboured up to a level patch of ground by some stout leafy scrub, where we looked them up and prepared for our share of the soil. Lots of people have been up Mount Juliet before some ladies, amongst others, I have been told, so that there is nothing heroic in the effort, but there is something which is very satisfying Mr Davidson has made the ascent several times ; he confesses himself to be at list satisfied I have accompanied tumours, and my satisfaction is complete and full I do not know that we registered a low, but am quite convinced we exchanged confidences, that if either of us should make the at tempt again he ought not to remain in the category of men of whom king Solomon is a type.
