A GHOST PARTY Is the supplanter of the book tea, and is also of American origin. The guests, who are called "spirits," enter from a dark room into a stage of light, an orchestra plays, while the apparition does a "witches' dance." On one occasion a lady representing "the spirit of gold" wore a gown of white crepe, to suggest Alaskan snows, gold coins were stitched to the hem, and her hair was powdered with gold dust. "The ghost party" will require more outlay in the way of costumes, and will be rather akin to a fancy dress ball.
