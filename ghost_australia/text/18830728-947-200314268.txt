MOUNT VICTORIA Ooiisidering' the general dejireasion in mining properties which has; so lately ?manifested.. .itself, .it would seem that much interest would not be felt in reading -any lengthy account ,of any mining district, but it is partly for this very reason that 1 venture to place before your ?readers.'a,!first attempt at a hurried deB nrint.ibn of the. above-mentioned locality and'the gold-bearing stone found there. ?But 'first: let me premise that although much, may be foretold by men of expe rience as tothe value of a discovery, still the.pases are ho numerous where oxpe rien'ce has been at fault, that.it can hardly be .regarded even as the rule that expe ' rienee is a guide in - mining matters ;' neither ia.hpnestyany guarantee of success, ' for some' 'of; the most honestly promoted ventures haveproved .failures, and vice versa, bo, that the average of the argument, leads-us back to the old Baying, viz., that' Xl ? !._'_£ — £ i-ltU.

This, though'started after the' Mercury, is by far the, most forward claim' on thefield. Here .there is 'a good,; strong reef,,.proyed;J,tb -a depth of 60ft., and; a tunneltdriven 170ft. in to meet the shaft, which, at' 'this.,. point, will, give 8Cft. of-. backsl;andas the hill is steep on the line of reef,, rising;, aboul one ,ln; three, it is to be expected the. reef will rise with it, which, will greafly increase the amount of ; Btorieto be worked from this level. 60ft. , from .the' mouth of ., the,. tunnel another goldTbearirig, reef,, 2ft.' ^wide,'. was cut ' which at this -place would give 39ft. of,, backs. Aigood sjte fpr machinery has., been .selected, near,, the river, which is. aborit,400ft. below the level of the tunnel. The 'battery,; a good part of -which, is on., the-'grourid.-is to.be driven -y water from the riyer, brought ;onrby, a race half ,a mile-ng- most of . which is excavated. The'wheel is to-be 37ft. diameter ana 3ft.f . breast oyershp't, built, on the ground..

A good road has been made by Government with commendable prompti tude from the settled part of Ringarooma up to the Ooriipany's machinery site, a diatanco of two miles, along which women and children' have already found their way and settled on some of the . claims, their voices making music where only a few months ago scarcely, a man had' set. his foot. , So much for mining. . ' And now, being down on the flat, a. few words about it may be appropriate. Tpf those who live in towns, and who have, a love for. forest scenery, this part' will afford real ploasure. The winding road along the bank of the little river, whose waters are the clearest of the clear ,; the majestio gums, the embowering myrtles,, the splendid fern trees, with the towering hills On all Bides; all go to form ' a picture riot so accessible in any other part, . ana which in tne warm.aays oi summer. wi,ll be delightful to travel, through: The' road is being extended another mile up the1 Valley, to'' the Mercury' Company's ?machinery, site, which in situation is almost 'a' counterpart of. the Premier.

During tho pastyear the Society: has/been quietly but efficiently fulfilling its mission of charity and mutual help. Happily no deathshave occurred. Those who have remained in the enjoyment;of health, and bo have not needed the par ticular, aid of tho Club, have no doubt' not' only beea grateful for that blessing, but.hiive felt a satisfaction in having been the1 means of assisting those of their brother members who have met with affliction. Notwithstanding tho .heavy demands upon the fundsiduring the year thejSpciety has, in a financial poiht of view, pretty well held its own. -The funds in hand now are .only £1 4a, Gd.less than, they were at the close of the reyious year. During the year ten, new: members have been admitted,, and others nominated. The accounts have, in accord ancelwith a resolution at the last Club meeting, been audited by Mr. Sidebottom andi- Mr. J.

Mr.'Waldron appeared on behalf of Mr. Barclay, and produced the necessary proofs, and intimated that his instruc tions woro not to press for an immediate, order, and that Mr. Barclay, who had been particularly patient in the matter, was' willing that a reasonable time should be given the Company to pay the amount. Mr. R. EL Pripe, the manager of the Company, admitted that the amount was owing, but explained to the Commissioner various reasons which had prevented the balance being paid. He -stated that calls would be made and money be coming in early in August. His Honor made an order ' to the effect that ' the amount be paid by the Company to the petitioning creditor, by the 20th August. 1 Genebal Tom Thumb. — This famous American dwarf, whose death was recently announced in our columns, visited Tas mania in 1870, when he and his wife were making a tour of the Australian colonies. His real name was Charles Stratton, and his height, when 25 years old, was 31in. He Was exhibited in England by the well known showman Barnum in 1846. In 1863; he married at New York Lavinia 'Warren, who was 32 inches high. Country.

The man Jones, who had :bdth legs broken at Port Lempriere on Monday, was brought to the Hospital yesterday, and upon enquiry last evening wo learn that he is progressing favourably.' A few days ago a .very painful accident \ happened to a son of Mr. J. 0. Greig, of Braemar, Invermay.

' In the Didoletian persecution of the year'289 he was. put to death, it is said; 'by being torn 'to 'pieces' with wool carders.1 What ,!he: had done to dbaorve this cruel fate is hot mentioned' in history.

' !' '1 he Belfast Beauty. — The people of Belfast, Ireland,', are said to have almost gone mad over the pure .Greek face, with its artistically arched bfpwj (the olassically., pillared throat, and exquisite complexion of a young Irish girl born in Blaokrock, county ' Cork, and a worker in Carter's - :mills in the city of fine linen. She isdes-, cribed as eclipsing any female which the British Isles or Ireland have produced in , all Aha elements of surpassing lovelineBS. oo great are ine crowds wiat surrouun we mill to see her, that the proprietors allow her' to depart half an hour before the other operatives, in order to; get rid of the polite mob. Lately, she visited a Bhde ehop on North -street, Belfast, kept by one Maginnis, and was followed by several hundred people. , The crowd increased to auoh an extent that policemen were called into' requisition, and: the besieged beauty was compelled to beat a retreat through a rear door. Ireland gave birth to the three Sheridan sisters, called the Three Graces in consequence of their extreme beauty, and here is a Hebe who seems to eclipse either. , .....-.? ?,..'... ASinguIiAb Accident.— The Lithgow, correspondent of the 8. M. Herald sends the following unjjer date 29th ult. J— An accident of a serious nature happened this afternoon at, the Ironworks. The slag had been tapped off from one of the puddling furnaces [into the wagon used for the purpose, ? and haying cooled sufficiently to form an outside. shell, the interior of the metal still being in a molten state, , a young man named Levie Collie was in tho act of removing it when suddenly an explosion took place. The molten slag waB violently thrown upwards in all directions and set fi.ro to the roof of ? the, shed. Some of this red hot metal poured in a volume over Collie, who with his clothing all on fire ran across the shed. He was terribly burned, and was as quickly as possible removed to his home, suffering greatly. He is by latest accounts, . in a very critical condition. ' Much com plaint exists among the ironworkers that no appliances exist upon the works to al leviate suffering in such cases. No oil even was at hand. The need of a hospital is mnoh felt here. ,'. ' ? F-3KB&S; ON PARLIAMENTARY REPRE SENTATIVES. — Mr. Archibald Forbes, in an article entitled 'Aus- tralian characteristics,' published in the 8. M. Herald, says :— ' It appears to me now accepted as a thing of course, as a matter not to be disguised but universally accepted as a broad fact, that a member goes to Parliament not so much accredited to legislate for the good of the commonwealth, 'as to agitate, struggle, intrigue, bully, for the constituency that sends him up. He is not an item in the aggregate of a Legislature ; he is a Dele gate from Little Peddllngton, or Bun-'1 goroobdora. His function is to obtain that, whether .the outlay be needed or not, without regard to the paramount claims of other places and regions, every pound of every loan that he can logroll or extort, by fair means or foul, shall be ex pended on Little Peddlington or Bun gorooboora.' Anotheb Tunnel Project. — An Eng lish paper saya: — People who are opposed to the Channel Tunnel may hope some day to encourage the idea of a tunnel connecting England with Ireland. The distance by way of Port Patriot is only 14£ ririUus.' - . The advantage to Ireland, and especially to' the West Goast,of being connected by direct railway with England and - Scotland 'would be enormous, and this advantage would be still greater were the latter countries, in their turn, directly connected whh the Continent, .

After the meeting a subscription list was opened in aid of the Land League 'funds, and a sum of £120 was the result.

An Extbaobdinaby Discovery.— A correspondent writes to a Madras paper.: — '!' A discovery of an extraordinary and very interesting description was recently made in connection with the cut ting of the Twantay Canal, British Burmah, in the labourers having hit upon a subterranean wreck of a vessel. Twantay is a station about 12 miles distant from Rangoon, and the Canal is a' navigation out undertaken; for, the purpose of facilitating communication between Rangoon and Bassein and other stations. The cutting was commenced in January, 1882, and finished in March, 1883, all work being suspended during the monsoon months. The. stem was the first part of the' vessel struck ; when this happened the superin-: tending engineer suspended the original work in hand for a while and directed himself to having the whole wreck dug upJ The vessel was found to be across the canal cutting, was eight feet below the surface of the ground, and appeared to have sustained some damage previous to.. its;haying become a subterranean wreck.. It measures ii 5ft.' n length,' and is sup posed to have been ; of about 250 tons burthen.] The stem has been deposited in the Phayre Museum, Rangoon. The vessel is ipresumed to be a Portuguese, one .of thb 16th century. '..'-, ?',''';.

He had no suspicion whatever of the , captain, having gone overboard, until breakfast time tho next, day, Jwhen, ..as '. .Captain Souter did not .appear,, he was sent for. Asj ho could, : not be found his cabin was opened and found unocou'pied, and his bed had apparently not been slept in that night. The man at the . wheel last saw the captain descend the companion, ladder at a quarter past 10, but after that time he heard no splash, nor saw anything fall overboard. De ceased was a native ' of Aberdeen, and a very sober man.
