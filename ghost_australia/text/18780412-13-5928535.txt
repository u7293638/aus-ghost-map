SANDHURST, (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) THURSDAY EVENING. Mr 1 at are we to do with persons suffering from temporary insanity and confirmed lunatics ' is the next question the residents of this city will have to discuss and decide upon For some time past the hospital committee have been endeavouring to get the Government to repair the lunatic wards at the hospital, and also to allow fair remuneration for their maintenance whilst in that institution 'The powers that be, however, can't see it, and at the meeting of the hospital committee last night, Mr Howard, the hon. treasurer, informed his colleagues that the Chief Secretary declined to pay more than 3s per day for the keep of lunatics in the Bendigo Hospital, notwithstanding it had been pointed out to him that they cost 5s per day, independently of medicine, and occasionally a special warder had to be cnf,a0cd to watch refractory patients It appears that the majority of lunatic patients sent to the hospital are merely suffering from (claim Dement, and that after a few days treatment they are restored to their national senses By sending them to the Bendigo Hospital, the Government save the cost of then being forwarded to the Kew Asylum, with an attendants expenses and all the little etceteras which, in 12 months, would far exceed the extra 2s per day wanted by the authorities for their maintenance However as the committee can t afford to keep them at a loss, it has been decided that no more lunatic patients shall be received in the hospital until a proper rate of înaintcpançe has been fixed, and the wards repaired.
