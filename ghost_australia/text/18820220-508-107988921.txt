It Was the Cat! A woman named Mary Henry was this morning' charged at the Redfern Police Court with cruelty to an animal— to wit, a cat — by breaking its back with a prop. It. appears there had been some quarrel] between the defendant and one of her neighbours, and in a fit of spite of passion, the former took up a prop and "went" for the unlucky cat whose back was broken and which lingered for 39 hours ere it gave up the ghost. The matter came to the ears of Mr. Inspector Webber; of, the Preven- tion of Cruelty to Animals Society and ha appeared to prosecute. The case was considered a very bad one. Defendaut was ordered to pay 60s and costs, or go to prson for three months with hard labour.
