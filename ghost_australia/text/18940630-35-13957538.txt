LIFE IN LONDON AND THEREABOUT (CHRONICLED JIT HENRY W. LUCY.) EDMUND YATES HIS DEATH HIS LIFE HIS WORK. WESTMINSTER. MAY 25. There was something; dramatically appropriate in the tragic ending of Edmund 1 rates If he had had the ordering of the final scene he probably would not have had it otherwise . Almost born in the theatre, he practically died in it. When the curtain fell over the stage it dropped upon the close of Ina vigorous and varied life There was nothing left for his faithful sorrowing friends hut to carry home the senseless figure rates had just come back from a long sojourn on the Riviera, whither he had been driven to spend the winter But he heard of the buds bursting in the London parks, of life throbbing in all the arteries of the great metropolis he know so wall and loved so dearly, and he felt impelled to return to his old haunts He was encouraged in this determination by a turn for the better he seemed to have taken with the early spring at Clunes He felt convinced that he has a renewal of life, and after his joyous fashion he resolved to make the most of it. He has not had a house in London for many years, making his home at Brighton Now he would set up housekeeping again and renew his old morning ride in the Row in the meanwhile, arriving opportunely for the revival of " Money," he would take his old place in the ranks of first-nighters He came to the theatre alone, in many ways a ghost of his former" self A few years ago he was as burly as he was tall Good temper and good living, the sun of prosperity Binning steadily upon the after long battling with fortune, one of his besetting sorrows was his tendency to stoutness After a serious illness he, two years ago, permanently lost flesh, and many familiar with him in old time did not on Saturday night recognise in the almost slim figure making its way to a front seat in the stalls at the Tivoli the burly Edmund Yates of five years back It happened, that, coming to the theatre alone, he found himself seated apart from his many personal and some intimate friends sprinkled about the stalls Contrary to the usual habit on a first night, there was very little movement between the acts, the people in the stalls for the most part remaining seated till the curtain rose again Thus Yates through his Just hour of consciousness sat silent, solitary, in the midst of the gay throng, all unconscious of the impending tragedy If he felt any premonition of what was coming he made no sign , sat staring at the show behind the footlights, with a curious light in his eyes noticed at least by one of his friends whom he passed on his way to his stall He made no main event of preparation whilst around him the throng was rapidly dissolving Then he fell from his chair as if struck by lighting, and never again lapsed into consciousness. It is just 22 years since I first made the acquaintance of Edmund Yates Some articles of mine appearing in one of the magazines under the nom de plume, The Member for the Chiltern Hundreds," attracted his notice He had just started the Ford, and was looking out for recruits to enable him to keep it going He was then living in a house in Cavendish-square, a curious little place, poked in among the surrounding stately mansions I remember the statuette of Voltaire on his writing desk, and Yates' restless tread up and down the small room as he told me all he was going to do with his new venture He was in his very prime then, and had a habit, modified only in later years, of walking about the room like a caged lion when he talked of anything that greatly interested him. He had tried many things before lecturing, novel- writing, journalism, and magazine editing He did well in all, but he was a man of expensive and expansive tastes, and his average revenue had Darch Burned to place him at ease For a turn, it seemed as if the world would go the way of earlier ventures When I was on its staff there was a tradition that on a particular week very early in its career the printer had notified that unless cash were forthcoming this would be his long service to the proprietor He was induced to carry on over one week, at which precise moment the turn in the tide Lama and the World and its proprietor rolled on to fortune Perhaps it is not true but it is a pretty story that used to be whispered around the sumptuous board at which, once a year, sometimes at the Albion oftener at Greenwich, the portly, prosperous editor and sole proprietor of the world entertained his literary staff, not forgetting the printer who was the hero of the story, and whom we all respected accordingly The result of my interview with 'States in Cavendish-square was the commencement of a series of articles which had some vogue with the title "Under the Clock" Accustomed at the time to the modest remuneration of a 'prentice hand, I was overcome by the munificence of the proposal made to me as remuneration for practically untried work But Yates was always generous, in money matters as in others At the end of the first year, the Clock" articles having taken the public fancy, and the World Leaving leaped into a position of financial prosperity, Yates voluntarily nearly doubled the original fee paying what was understood ltthutinifltobotbo highest remuneration for any SLnol article in a newspaper Watching Y itcf, at his weekly work, n ming his hearty laugh, and listening to his jocund comers mon it seemed the easiest thing in the world to edit and conduct a prosperous weekly journal I tried it, with the result of two years' hard labour not only unrequited, but involving large money loss My severance from the journal and setting up what might have been regarded as a rival shop made no difference in Yates's personal relations with his old contributor The very year I relinquished my connection with Tftittfatr he invited roo back to the fold including me in the staff invitation to the annual dinner just then coming off At the beginning of last session he made a proposal to reintroduce in the world the old feature of the Clock" articles My engagements prevent! my falling in with a proposal that would have given me the greatest pleasure Early in the spring I had an opportunity of writing in the World an article of the kind Yates' soul You ed "I am very pleased," he wrote from Cannes, where he was then staying, to find you have not forgotten your old friend and your old work- shop ' Yates made many friends, but there was one whose memory he cherished like that of his old master, Charles Dickens Dickens was an on thusiastic admirer of Tatos's mother, a popular actress of her day This naturally drew him to young Edmund when he showed an aptitude for literature I have not Torater's " Life of Dickens at hand, but I remember a foot- note in it where Forster, who did not passionately admire the festive Edmund records a memorandum in which Dickens, paying a high tribute to Yatcs'a capacity, gav o instructions that modest drafts on him on the treasury of All the ear House! were to be honoured Yates resembled the great master in other respects than the habitual use of violet ink He was an admirable after-dinner speaker, a rare combination of gift with the power of literary expression Also, like Dickens, he was a born actor and a delightful raconteur His sense of humour was superlatively keen, and its chaff tion almost boisterous No dinner table was dull at which Edmund Yates sat His jovial presence, his ready wit, and his contagious good temper of ore sufficient to ensure the success of the dullest gathering of average dinner guests He once told me, it striking him as an irresistible flash of humour, that he had originally been designed for the Church His father had set his heart upon his taking Holy Orders, used to talk about enter- ing him at Charterhouse, his going on to Oxford, and thence entering the gates of the Church Tatea's picture of himself, first as a blushing curate, then possibly blossoming into a portly dean, was irresistibly comical On the whole it will be agreed that fate dealt most kindly and judiciously in shaping his course as it was run Few men have lived a brighter or more varied life up to the establishment of the World Yates occasionally felt that eternal want of pence that vexes public, and some private, mon For 20 years he lived in affluence, wiolding considerable public influence and, in spite of some poisonous criticisms, working for the public good To him, more than any other man, is due the present improved style of the English press I know something about it, since my professional career has been exactly con- temporaneous with the change Even in the oldest and formerly the soberest of the London newspapers it is now permissible for a contributor to say what he has to say and then, like the Northern farmer, at the close of the sermon in church, to room away When I first joined the London press, a year before the estab- lishment of the Wvtii, a man of the general staff charged with delivery of the message, say, " twice two are four " must needs wrap it up in verbiage just turning the column in length and bro' on up into paragraphs, of which the middle was longer by about a third than the first and lost in the World as was set. forth in the original prospectus, of a high I had, a a copy, was projected " an am using chronicler of current history divested of the nonsense which has hitherto stuck Uko treadle to public business " This, ideal Yates realised The public were grate- fully appreciative The old-established papers it first seized, then grow angry, and finally imitated In later years it v, as the keenest satisfaction to Edmund later to see, one by one, the experiments introduced into his journal and there successfully carried out crop up in the columns of staid daily newspaper which 10 or Iii years earlier had gathered close their pharisaical garments when the uprightly florid spun past them
