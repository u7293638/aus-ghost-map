"Well," lie replied, "I saw 'Romeo and Juliet. 1 thought It was simply fine. Miss Terry was simply splendid as Ju liet, especially In the balcony scene— you remember the balcony scene, don't you ?— where she—" "Oh, yes." replied Irving; "1 remember It very well. You know I played lto- "Yes, yes; I remember. Then tho nurse — wasn't the nurse very good? Who is It played that part— oh; yes; Mrs Sterling, wasn't it? And the apo thecary— I thought ho was very good, didn't you?" "Well, what other plays did you see?" asked Irving. "Well. I saw 'Macbeth' for one." "Did you like-It?'" "Oh, yes, especially that scene where Lady Macbeth comes Ip with the taper, you know, and tooks nt her hand. How is this thnt goes? 'Out, damned spot! Out. I say!' And then something about 'the perfumes of Arabia. And then there's a fine scene between her and Macbeth, where she tells him— I forget, but it was very good. And Banquo was awfully good, don't you think so?" "Well, did you seo 'Hamlet?' " asked Irving. " 'Hamlet?' " Oh, yes. Polonlus struck me as particularly good In that. Do you remember where he Is giving his advice to Laertes?— Give thy thoughts no tongue, nor any unproportioned thought his act; Be thou familiar, but by no means vul gar. Those friends thou hast, and something something tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hooks ot i steel. . " "I forget how It goes on. Horatio was very good, too." "Well, ! played Hamlet In that, you know," ventured Irving. "Oh, Indeed? Yes, to ho sure: I re member. But who was It that played the ghost?" Irving gave It up when It reached this point.
