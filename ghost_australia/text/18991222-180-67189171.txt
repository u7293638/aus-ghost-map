HELENA VALE CLUB. SECONT) DECEMBER MEETING. SUCCESSFUL GATHERING. It is a long lane that has no turning, and the dictum' was oypmplifip^l at Helena Vale on Saturday. The club has had more than its share of difficulties — meeting after meet ing resulted in hiss until matters looked serious indeed. The management, however, stood plackily to its guns, and failure bids fair to be turned into success in the long run. The first December meeting resulted in a nice profit, and Saturday's meeting was quite a signal success from both a financial and a racing point of view. The heat wave which prostrated everybody during the week had gone, and Saturday morning was ushered in in rerreshinglv cool wcaiher. The special trains were well filled, and there was a strong contingent of local residents among the visitors. It was one of the most repre sentative and at the same time most pleasant gatherings the club has heid. Tiie invest ments on the totalisator were about £2,500, and the filing races yielded £69. The course was in first-rate order, and the time in several of the events was consequently i fast The Selling Hurdle Rice opened the afternoon's proceedings, and only — ree can didates faced the barrier. Eestless and Idalium IL were most fancied- The former, who was the favorite, led throughout, and won easily. Satanella, who is not hersdf yet, was out of the hunt all the way. The i winner was submitted to auction by Sir. Al I ljprt Cierk, and bought in by tbe owner for '. £31. The Plying Handicap 'attracted a field I of ten. Gipsy BiH, Wantagong, and Gos i saire were most in request. The Oarby colt i cams out in the straight, and iroa pretty | comfortably from Wise Step. 'and Gossaire^ I the three Derby colts thus filling the plices. | The All-Aged Stakes created a gocd deal of ; interest. Mural, Ormuz, Yale Lock, Gipsy iBUl, Interlude, aad Gunbaaier were witii ! drawn. Tarquin, who looked bright and .well, and Lucky Dog divided favoritism, j the former at the close being at 2 to 1 on. ! A little mosey went on Limber and The I Black Rock. The race calls for little de | scriptiom. Tarquin took charge before the (home turn, was reached, and coming on full \- of running won as he liked. Lucky Dog and The Black Rock fought out quite a desper ate finish for the second place, Mr. Saun ders's horse beating Lucky_ Dog by a bare nose. The son of Martini-Henry had no chance at all with Tarquin, who is, over that distance at any rate, almost invincible. The former did not run too kindly. Brayleigh finished fourth. Criterion won the Handi cap Selling Race, and was returned to his owner at £48. Triumph fled from his field in the Jumpers' Flat Race. Nothing had a ghost of a chance with tbe Fremantle geld ing, who evidently races better in front. A field of eight went to the post for the Christ mas Handicap. Spectator was served up warm, and the Nor'-West representative Be proach was well backed. while oil Wantagong also had friends. Asteroid, Madge Gordon, Goesaire, and Black Boolka comprised the leading lot t-- the torn. In the straight Qosssh-e took charge, acd the' handsome little chestnut, racing generously, beat Black Boolka by a neck, wi*h Madge Gordon a similar distance ; p5 third. The win was a popular one, and I Carey, who has not had much luck, though ifae is one. of our best and most painstaking i ttinners, received many congratulations.
