THE SEMAPHORE BOARDING STATION. To the Editor. Sir—Your paragraph re the Customs hoarding-office at the Semaphore and the letter of "Jagoe's Ghost" have hit the right nail on the head. I have seen the linoleum ra"sed inches off tlie floor by the pu-ts of wind that penetrated the cracks and crevices ot this ancient relic when a sUff sou'-woster was hlouing. The furni ture and appointments are in keeping with the shed, in which decent fitting*, &c;, would lie out of place. They arc wretched and insufficient. Anyone having business to transact there must stand or nit on a locker, one ricketty chair for the officer on duty being the limit of depart mental generosity. Bearing in mind the j Uct that the boarding officers are on duty ! 56 hours a week if they are lucky, and { longer if their luck is out, surely they are entitled to decent housing. Officer!) who arc not exposed to the dements have at times luxurious rarroundiogs. Cannot a little plain comfort be extended to those who work long hours by day and night In all weathers? —I am, ix.. GREEK LIGHT.
