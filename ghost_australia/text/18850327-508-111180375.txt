Political Chitchat. The close of the session was distinguished by that sapient legislator, Mr. Buchanan, feeling it necessary, to censure the Speaker. His action, was quite.in keeping with the lack of fine feeling that charac terises the hon. and learned member,, and hiB»deniin ciatibns of Mr. Barton's conduct were quite in the perfervid Buchanan style. The feeling' of the House was eminently roused in opposition to the hon. gentle man's criticisms, and it speaks well f orthe intelligence and common sense of the Assembly that only one of the representatives! and that one Mr. M'Elnono. could be found to support him in,hiB tirades. Mi. Dibbs proposed to erase the motion from off the records of the House, but this, would have defeated Ms object. It is quite sufficient : to protect the Speaker's honor by referring: to thecdivision and its result. As is usual on the concluding night -of e session, the House was counted out, hon. gentlemen .refusing to listen to Mr. Melville's elucidation .pi the dump car trouble. However, Mr. Smithigot Ma say- on* the question, Who is this horror that dogsthessteps of- SirJIenry Parkes with his pestiferous bill (for .£4? Is it not possible to exorcise this ghost wiho bobs T'Tngn1f up, at the most inauspicious periods? His advent at the Goulburn meeting was very unwelcome, and formed a fitting sequel to the storm of. cursing and hail of. epithets that the candidate indulged in. Any extreme should be taken with this misguided credi tor. It'would be quite fair to have him arrested as a provoker of the disturbance of the peace, or he might be flung out neck and crop from these meet ings thatie persistently attends, like tbe pestilence that walketh by night, or he might be dynamited, or, as a last resource, it may be held expedient to pay his bill. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
