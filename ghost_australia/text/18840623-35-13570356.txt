j - SPORTING "1NTBLMGJDNGE. ~ ^ VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB RACES. |BY TELEGRAPH.] (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. MELBOURNE, SUNDAY. The weather on Saturday was everything that could be desired. The V. A. T. C. committee had put forward an exceedingly good programme for the afternoon's racing, and the owners of racehorses had responded so liberally that a large attendance at the Caulfield course was the natural result. 'The course was in. admirable order and the racing good. The Victoria Gold Cup brought out the very small field of three horses, and Fickle, who started at even money, had a very easy victory, ne Black Jacket stopped in front of the grand stand, and Gilderoy baulked persistently on the hill past the stand, and though eventually he got round he was never within half a mile of the winner. For the Ladies' 'Trophy the large field of 31 horses started, and The Ghost Biutrlcd out when they had travelled about one third of the distance, and led home a winner by a length. Primus came With a fast rush at the last moment, but it was too late to be effective. had he got through the horses a little earlier he would have troubled The Ghost. It is a somewhat odd coincidence that this race was won last year by a horse named The Ghost. The following are the particulars of the racing : HANDICAP HURDLE RACE. Mr. T. Jones' Meiti, lust.

Merri was backed strongly by the stable, and the public followed suit, the result being that he started at the short odds of 5 to 2. The favourite went to the front at the start, and leading all the way, won very easily, nothing being able to pace with him at any part of the journey.
