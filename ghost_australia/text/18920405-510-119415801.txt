The Ghost Train The new ' ghost' train running be tween New York and Boston every afternoon, except, Sunday, is attract ing some attention even in America, where railway travelling is brought to a' fine art. The carriages are of a creamy white outside, with decora tions in gold ; all the cars, which are of the Pullman order, have paper wheels, and are brightly illuminated with gas jets after dark. The gas is carried in cylinders under each car. The cars are heated with Baker's heaters. Each train cousists of a com bination car, with luggage van and smoking-room. The latter is carpeted, furnished with willow chairs, and up bolstered like an hotel room. The drawing-room cars have revolving and reclining chairs, and many other con veniences. There is no distinction of class, the humblest traveller being free to enjoy all the comforte of the train.
