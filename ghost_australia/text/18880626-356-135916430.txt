TRUE CHRISTIANITY. LAs T Friday (sa3ys thle Metahodist Times) "a well-known lady of title, who probably would not wish her. name to be published, came to Mr. Eughes and volunteered to receive at her castle in the country companies of poor persons from the slums and back streets all through the summer months. The beauty of this Christian. act is enhanced by the fact that her lady ship also undertook to bear the whole cost, including their railway fares. Mr. Hughes will be delighted to have similar offers from any number of lords and ladies. There is great need for such Christianity." A good dinner is better than a floe coit.
