He made out llmfc Ferguson’s whole demeanour was corpse-like and supernatural, and added a sug gestion of a bullet-wound in his forehead, im plying suicide. However, other peopleware in clined to be less impressed, and hinted that tho Secretary had beeu sampling the drinks before supper. Young Haliburton,-when he w.ia next fa London, made nujuirie1* at F’ecfcUson’s club whither Charlie had posted the. card fopthe Bachelors’Ball. The Club porter, said he had heard nothing of Fergusson for several months, and that he had left no address to which his letters might be forwarded. He showed' Hali hurlon about thirty letters for Ferguson, and Haliblirton eagerly searched through them to find Charlie’s-invitation. But—this was a very strange feature in it—the invitation to the. ball was not among the letters. Wasn’t that curous ? ” “ It was, indeed. That had evidently found him out somewhere beyond his Club.” “Shortly after this remarkable: upparition, .-Miss WaterOeld went awuy from hitlleborough, I think‘she went abroad to learn some speciea of musical instrument in Germany.

Charlie - Davidson, and Wickham both maintain that the man who has just been married is another person of the same name. .
