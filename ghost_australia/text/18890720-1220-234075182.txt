Old Devices of Photographers. There are various ways for providing sur prising zesultB in photography, things that in one age wonld have been called magio, but in ours recognised as scientific tricks. The ghost picture, for instance, in which a shadowy ghoBt— through which material objects are visible — is seen between natural attitudes and occupations. That is produaed by an almost instantaneous exposure of the figure that is to do duty as the ghost, fol lowed by a full exposure of the figures and properties that are to appear natural. Another novel triok was shown recently in a photograph reproduced by a prominent trade jonrnal; which presented theproprietor seated at a table, playing chess with himself, sitting on the opposite Bide of the table, while he, himself, stood up in the background looking at his two selves playing. The figureB were all on the negative, which was produced by the successive exposures of the plate, parts thereof being masked each time by a black velvet shatter. Still another sort of triok is that by which . a peiBon who likeB that sort of thing may ap pear to be photographed riding upon a fly ing goose, or a fish, or any other desired style of ridiculous locomotion. This is done by the subject holding upon his lap a huge piece of white or sky-tinted card with the fanoiful figure drawn npon it. HiB face appears above the upper edge of the card, und seems, in the picture, joined to the funny little body mounted on the goose or fish. The statue picture is made by about the same devise.
