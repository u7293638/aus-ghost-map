THE DAY OF REST. THE HOLY SPIRIT. ASERMON by the Rev. KSXRY G. NICHOLLS, of Clayton Church, Sensing ton, Adelaide. , "When the oomfoner, advocate, or helper is come/whom I will send unto you from the Father, be sh$ll bear witness of me; and ye al»o bear witness, because ye hav^ been with me from the beginning."—John xv. 26-27. i " " * ' (Cfmcluded.J 2\.

J Without His fire we are cold; without His power, powerless; without His Spirit, carnal; without His life, dead! What we require is not new truth, but now trust. "Ask and ye shall receive." But the dove-like Spirit is gentle and easily repelled. You can welcome Him or refuse. If false, the Spirit of truth cannot come into you. If unwilling, His fire cannot kindle the good and consume the evil within. We must be " willing" if we are to know "the day of His power." "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord." But " blessed aie the pore in heart for they shall see God." _ _Let ns then implore the "Father of our spirits" to charge us anew. &3 lamps with refined oil, with the Holy Ghost, to the end that the flams of devotion and loyalty to our Master may burn steadier and brighter than ever. As on the altar so in the heart. "The lire shall ever be burning." Would it not appear as if some "had not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost or not?" Or that they are his "Temple?" And others, again, forget that "the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink, but righteousness," &c.; The blight of some Churches is unspiritual officers and worldly members. They yield far more readily to the spirit of the age, the zeit grist, than to the "Spirit of God." Increase of wealth induces an ardent love of money; they become "lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;" they "delils their garments," have a name to live, but are dead! Meanwhile, alas! they are all unconscious of the change'. Perhaps some were never soundly converted to God; others were naver fully consecrated; others again used reconsecrating; in a word, they want more of God. 2\. Our Privilege.—We may "ask and have." "God will be enquired of for this by the house of. Israel." It is a heathen who says, "God comes to men.; say, He comes into men.^ 'No good, mind is wholly without God." (Seneca.) "No mind can be rightly disposed ivithoutdivine influence." (Seneca.) "The end of man is to be made like God. 55 (Pythagoreanphilosojjhy). If the sacred tireof the Romans happened at any time to be extinguished it could only be rekindled at the rays of the. sun. And men are more than men only when made "paraakars of the Divine Nature." Christians enjoy a more exuberant life as they "grow in. grace." The Holy Ghost m^ist become our .ELoly Guest. *' Then the kingdom of heaven 'energizes' itself within us, clothee itself with new force, and if we are men of force, we rise to the occasion; we redouble our endeavjoors to subdue the evil chat is in us and to fosOar the good; we give ourselves with new zeal to the service of Christ, and of that world which he has redeemed. 1 Tour privilege is this—you. have a missi/on to the world. "What the soul in the bodv is that Christians are in the world." See how prominent and important is this as set icirth iu the. Acts of the Apostles.-—"Of the men, therefore, which have eompanied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went but among us. . . . of these must one become a witness with us of his resui.Tection (i.,22). "This.Jesns did God raise up, 'whereof we all are witnesses" (xi. 32). "We are all witnesses of these.things, and so is thie Holy Ghost whom God hath given to thorn that obey Him" (v. 32). " We are witnesses of all things which, he did, both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem" (x. 3i)>. " He was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people" (adii. 31). "Whan the blood of Stephen, thy witness, was shed I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments, of them that Blew, him" (xxii. 30). " And the Lord said, I am. Jesus, whom thou peraecutest. But arise, and stand upon.thy feet, for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister aud^a witness both of the tilings wherein tbou.hast seen Me and of the things wherein X will appear unto thee. . . . thai •the people may turn from to light, and from the power of. Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are aancciQed by faith in Me" (xxvi. 16.18). ^thousand.knights in armour clad Hath Abe Holy Ghost ordained. All His wurkand-wili to do, Jly Hisliving force sustained. Bright their awardB, their banners bright; Who wouldnot beianked a knigUt Foremost in xhat sacred Host? Oh! whate'er.onr race or creed' May . we be such Knights indeed, tioldiera of lie- Holy Ghost. ' In the first portion of the above sermon, which appeaned.in lastjaaturday'sJowrjiaZ. the following is a correct reading of a sentence in jthp third paragraph:—" New Testament is related -to the Old Testament as ripe fruit to fair fioner. And here we axe taught both the divinity and personality of the Holy Spirit." The quotation from Stuart commences from thistppint.-
