CHRISTMAS —> HILLS. (FROM OUB CORRESPONDENT.) This place has been very quiet since my. last, nothing of any local, not to say, general, interest having transpired beyond the concert in aid of the Institute Funds. The weather for this time of the year has been all that could be desired. A few hot days, and then some heavy showers followed by cool breezes, made up the calendar for the month. The gardens, however, at least so far as fruit trees are concerned, have not been by any means a success. Cherries and apples as well as the small fruits have seriously suffered from some, at present, unascertained cause. The fruits will consegflently be very scarce ainongst us'this steajoiu i Foxes are rapidly increasing.
