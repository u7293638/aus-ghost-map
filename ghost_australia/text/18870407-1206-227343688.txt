And when ho nearcd the Carrie yards. He found the corner jiost. And placed the bottle on the top. 'J'o try and draw ihe ghost. The ruxe it acted like a ehnnu. His Ghostship quick did come. The î'ott hadn't time to wink. JJ^fore it quaffed the rum. And then it tried to stamper off To make another raid : Alas ! the rum had done its work— The Traralgon ghost was laid.
