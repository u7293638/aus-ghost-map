| AT THE PLAY. A \Vef.k of Good Businkas— Programmes 0 v the Nioirr. After tho harassing work of Boxing night and the days immediately succeeding it aro over, and tho professional folk who work so hard at Christmas time havo had a Sun- day's rest, thoy turn out with new vigor and spirit on Monday, and you hardly know them. The wily playgoer is quite aware of this fact. You don't catch him at first nights, especially in Pantomime season, lie knows well enough that the fairies arc dead tired, tho leading people ho confused with the necessary cuts and condensations that they hardly know where they are, and every human lieing, from tlie manager to the call Iwy, in a state of nervous irritation from overwork end nnxicty. By the Monday after Christinas this is all over. Showfolk are tho most clastic people in the world. A week's salary turns them into swells, though tho ghost may have not ivalked for months before, excepting in un certain staggers ; a night's clear rest puts new life into' them, and a hearty round of spontaneous upplausu with real meaning aud admiration in it spirit lliem up os if electricity had been put into their movements. Consequently, thu New Year week is tho best week for the Christmas shows, and to all those first-night folk who went before, the best iidvicc that can be givcu is—go again aud see how much butter the piece Is.
