THE FASHIONS. "STILL Fashin olds himperious sway, The ladeys his gone mad" (Sais JONES to me the t'other day), "It reely his tu bad." Gals rears sich hod and fulish things, And fanceys as theire graseful; You might put dis before the wurd— By gum it is dis-graseful. Says JONES, "I've been a payin' bills, Which they har ard to bare too." Says hi, "That's wan hoff many ills Umanity hss hair tu." The ladeys hof the present day Ar pretty things to view, While opping hall along the vay Just like a kangaruu. Theer his the shinong—now, my vord, Hain't that a pressious go! Nothink war iver so habsurd. Which it hisn't rite, you no, Tu take a lot of peepel's air Has as giv hup the ghost, And ty it hon ther eds tu ware. Hit fritens wan amost, Tu think ow scilly wimin his, Young, hold, both wan and hall— Shinongs to sich dimenshins riz, And bonnets got so small. Von singil hounse ov common sence Tu them is kivite onnone; They never thinks of no hexpence, No matter ow ve grone, And so hit his as ow the men Spends retched singel lives, They can't hearn aff enuff of tin Tu titivate their vives. The henemy hoif mankind, he Hin Pariss town doth dwell, And makes the fashin books you see To serve his purpus well. The ladeys vatches hevery male, Hexpostulation's vain, Twelve times a yere they but entale New folleys ore again.
