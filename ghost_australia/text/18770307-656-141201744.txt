[?] UNDER THE STABS. O totjth, rose-crownod, yet; full of strife* Craving uncompreliunded joys, Hearing the desperate fight of life But bb a far-off pleasant noise Come, ere on thy bold way thou start, While not a oloud thy future mora, And etUl that wildly-beating heart Under the stars. A stormy prime, so beautiful . With fierce delight, ecstatic pain, .. ^Spending and being spent; no lull, No' rest, no want of loss or gain — . Ere with tired feet thou come to tread The blood-stained field of ended wars, Pause : bow the glories of thy head Under the stars. 'A heavy time of brows discrowned, ' lOf hanging hands and feeble knees, With piteous pale ghosts haunted round, And longings for impossible ease — Ah, beat no more like wounded bird ? ? Against Fate's. iron prison bars ! When all sounds cease, God's voice is . ??.heard, Under the stars. Soon, soon will come the supreme hour ?When like a painted show life seems, ' Or perfume of remembered flower, ' t Or .dear dead faces seen in dreams. Clasp hands beneath the silent night That hushes all these mortal jars ! God, Thou alone art Love and Light— r - Beyond the stars.
