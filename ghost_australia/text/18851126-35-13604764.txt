residence An old store was hired and fitted up as his cathedral, and here he commenced his self-denying labours as Bishop of Adelaide. The ignorance of the doctrines of the Church was so great that when he come. monead a course of catechetical instructions the press of the colony looked upon him " as a reformer whose clear mind was disabused of the errors of Romanism, that his doctrine was so founded on the Bible that they were certain a union would soon be effected between Romanists and the English branch of the Church Catholic " He published several parts of Gothor's " Papists Mis represented and Represented," for this he was looked upon as a reformer, and such ignorance of our holy) religion existed that our most holy and

long residence there caused him to almost forget his mother tongue Broken in health, he was compelled to seek another china On his return he stopped at the Cape of Good Hope, and, hearing of the deplorable state of the Catholics there, he resolved to defer his departure, and though in poor health remained over six with ministering to the wants of the poor people, resuscitating the Church His

extension and consolidation of the faith We come then to the next S mod in the history of our church and see the labours of r Battalion, first Bishop of Ocemuea He founded the church indeed in tears We find, too, the name of Bishop Douant, who sank a victim to his zeal labouring hand a flock decimated with smallpox The name of Roeboux, too, will never be forgotten Coming out with high hopes, he offered his life for the success of his mission and that offer God accepted He and his companions found a grave in the w water, of the Pacific Ocean We must also record the labours of Philip A.ward in AA Wellington, where he founded the see There is also Charles Henry Dev is, first Bishop of Maitland and Coadjutor Bishop of Sydney The University of Sydney will always be a record of his love of literature, for to him is due the establishment of the library in that institution Of A\ ultra Storie I need say but little You are familiar with his history , worn out with work, he was obliged to return to Europe What shall I say of the first Bishop of Brisbane God's ways of dealing with His servants are mysterious During his lifetime the cup of affliction scarely ever passed from his lips,

ways are not the ways of man A holy priest in the diocese of Wexford Father James Dison gave offence by his piety and zeal in the dish irr'0 of his duties at that troublesome period in Irish history He was at once looked upon as being disaffected, when above all other men of his day he was the least had tointirftro in politics Muk and retiring, he betook himself with his suzerain love to Bristol, where he was followed by an area and on the testimony of a drunken profligate soldier he was condemned to be transported to Botany Bay William Harrold, parish priest of Willie han, was another A native Although of a meek disposition, his zeal aroused the antagonisms of the Protestant party, then in the ascendant, and he was inclined to the popular cry He likewise was transported without any

"I dare not in tific He was put on board a ship, and sent to Botany Bay So glaring was the injustice of this case that Euri Harwick, Viceroy of Ireland, issued a writ for his recall after he had spent six months in exile I must not omit Father JeiomiuhFinnois O'l Lynn, who expressed his w congress to consecrate his life to the serv ice of his expatriated country men in New Holli and I feel there are some of the old ones amongst you who have received confirmation of the other sacraments of the church at his hands He had not obtained legal authority to come out here, although he was a British subject consequently he was commanded to return. He heeded not the war mug but took to the bush, and there, by stealth, met his flock Difllcultios pressed upon him, and he promised to give himsilfupif he was allowed to meet his flock once more That meeting took place in the upper chamber of the house of William Davis, situated on the site whos e St Patrick's Church now stands You are well acquainted with what he did at that last meeting It would be too much for me to relate the scene where the first guard of honour was established for the Blessed Sacrament in the tabernacle William Dempsey was the life and soul of that guard, which he mainly instituted I must also mention Bishop Gabriel Brunt, who offered to come here when Father Flynn was expelled Afterwards the work began with the first authorised priests, Fathers Perry and Connolly the instructions they received from the then Governor of this colony, stating what they should do and how their doctrines should be preached Let it pass From other sources you can learn all about 'the written document giving those instructions exists in the archives of the Jesuit fathers in this at) We have however, a cause of thankfulness when we remember that though we lament our deceased prelates, the seed sown in sorrow is now being reaped in joy The Church, it is well BUd, is founded in blood and tears I must also refer to those long-suffering men who bore witness to the truth, who week after week were flogged because they would not consent to an alien creed On my first visit here Archbishop Polding, tho A venerable Bede of Vus train, introduced me to an old man whose back was burdened, indeed, with the lash He said, " then flogged me every Monday morning, but they could not fear the faith out of me " He is now enjoy ing the rear yard of his long suffering God knows I do not speak in bitterness of the past, but in a spirit of thankfulness for the pace and liberty we now enjoy The Australasian Church will form out of the brightest pages in future history Scarcely bus she reached the age of 60 years, and already we see a Plenary Council, with a Cardinal presiding over our delibe- rations" Surely this is reaping in joy After the sermon a solemn procession was formed from the altar to a catafalque, or memorial bier, elected between the and one, of the altar and the Vaughan memorial window His Eminence the Cardinal, the Right Revs Drs Moran, bah ado, Murphy, and Alurra)., attired in black vestments and white unties, sprinkled the catafalque with holy water, inconsistent, and pronounced the solemn absolution (super tumulus) At the close of the ceremony the decrees were read and the meeting closed
