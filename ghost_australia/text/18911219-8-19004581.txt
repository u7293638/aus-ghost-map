Sonic Ghost Stories. A SINGULA.E VISITOR. We were talking a week or two ago of ghosts and appear- ances. Here is another experience, not personal, but nearly personal. A long time ago, being then In a far-off island. I was living in a little country house, about clgbt miles lrom the town Oue evening, about six o'olook, there arrived a oertaln friend who was chief accountant oi a bank in town, and lived in the bank alone, except for tlio Indian servants. AB they slept out of the house, he had tho bank all to himself at night. He came, it appeared, to dinner. During that meal he was silent and distrait. Presently, however, he oonflded to me the real reason for his call. It was not to dine with me, but to get me to return with him, and sleep at the bank. The night before, he said, at about nine o'clock, as he was sitting alone, the door flew opÂ¿n, and there appeared a man whom he knew to bo in London. This figure sat down, orossed its legs, and looked at bim. He got up and changed his ouair. The figure turned round, and continued to look at him. Thereupon he went to bed, but woke up at Intervals all night long, and got up to see if the figure was still in the room He saw it, in the darkness. It was titree nil night long. It only vanished with the daybreak. *' Wow?- said my friend, " if that ghoBt oomes to-night, and I am alone, I shall go mad. It you will come back with me, I don't mind if there are a dozen ghosts." I went back with him, and took a bed at the bank. There was no ghost at all. Ho ought to have heard that the man had died on that very night. But he heard no such thing. The man may be alive now.
