By lienvenl' cried Amyas, 'Frank speaks ike a book ; and for :me, I do think that hristian gentlemen may leave love quarrels io bulls and rams.' 'Ami that the heir of Clovelly,' said Frank, smiling,' may find more noble examples to copy than the stags in his own deer-park.' ' Well,' said Will penitently, ' you are a great scholar, Mr. Frank, and you speak like one ; but gentlemen must fightsometimes, or where would be.their honour.' ' I speak,' said Frank, a little proudly, ' not merely as a scholar, but as a gentleman, fend one who has fought erp now, and to whom it has happened, Mr. Cary, to kill his man (on whose soul may God have mercy); but it is my pride to remember that I have never yet fought in my own quarrel, and my trust in God that I never shall. For as there is nothing more noble anil blessed.than to fight in behalf of those whom we love, so tb fight in our own private behalf is a thingnot to be allowed to a ChVistian man, unless refusal imports, utter loss of life or honotir;, and evin then, it may Jje (though I would not lay a burden on arty man's conscience), it is _better not to resist evil, but to overcome it with good.' ' . . s 'And I can'tell you, Will,' 6aid Amyas, ' I am not tioubled with fear Of ghosts; bpt when I cut off the Frenchman's head I said to myself, " If.'that braggart had been slandering me instead of her gracious Majesty, I should expect to see that head lying on my pillow every time I went to bed »t night.'" • ftodforbid !' said Will, with a shudder.

' I go to what Baleigh calls the Land of the NymphB. Another month, 1 hope,will see me abroad in Ireland.' ' Abroad ?
