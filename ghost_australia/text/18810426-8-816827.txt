ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. LUMINOUS FUNGI. (To the Editor of the Maitland Mercury.) SIR—Having noticed two letters in the Mercury upon the above subject, and the writer of one letter asked to be informed if other persons had seen the fungi alluded to by him. I beg to state that for years luminous fungi has been seen in this town, in the " autumn part of the year." Last year there was so much about that the children one evening covered the top rail of the bridge with it, which had a very singular appearance. —I am, sir, yours obediently, W. H. GORDON. A fast goods train ran into another goods train which was shunting at Working Junction, on Tuesday morning. A dense fog prevailed. The engine telescoped one wagon, and several trucks were thrown over the embankment. The traffic is entirely de- ranged. Once at rehearsal Braham said to Tom Cooke, the leader of the orchestra, " Subdue the band here, Tom, for I shall drop my voice in this passage." "If you are going to drop your voice, said the leader, " not to pick it up. It is just such a voice as I should like." A series of snowstorms of unexampled severity have prevailed throughout European Russia during the last few days.
