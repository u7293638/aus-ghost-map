3ïhe Srbsbnne (Hon« PUBLISHED DAILY. ülouday, July 25, 1881. The Auditor-General's report for 1879 80 not only embraces the transactions of that period, but also, through the late assembling of Parliament, enables specially valuable because recent information to be given with respect to tho year just closed. To politicians it may be a matter of some historical interest to obtain a verified priuted record of revenue and expenditure twelve months after date ; but the general public are much more concerned in current affaire. We will, however, follow the Auditor-General through his report, and extract from it the more interesting points. Of the total provision of nearly a million and three-quaiters, in round num- bers, made for the year 1879-S0, the sum of ¿£58,000 lapsed by order-in- couucil and £31,000 was carried forward to the succeeding year. The remainder was spent in tho manner intended by Parlia- ment. Tho Supplementary Estimates, which generally means unforeseen dis- bursements in anticipation of Parliamen- tary authority, were in 1879-80 under ¿£68,000, or as the Auditor-General points out «£100,000 'less than those of 1877-8. The same feature is noticeable for the period just closed. But wo can- not do better than give Mr. Drew's own words. He says in paragraph 12 of his report : The unauthorised expenditure for the year 18S0-81 again promiaea to be leas than ia former years. The Supplementary Estimates to cover thia expenditure for 1877-78 and 1878 79 were about the same ia amount, and averaged £150,000 each year. Ia 1879-80 they amounted to £67,809 19a. lOd. The aggregate of the ser- vices authorised by tho Governor-iu-Council to the present time for the year 1880-81 is £73,915, "of which £59,208 8a. 8d. waa expended on the 30th June ultimo, including a sum of £22,910 13s. 4d. paid on account of the new mail subsidy for the ûve montha ended 30th June, 1881. A better indication of business capacity and thrift could hardly bo found than is thus furnished. The Treasurer who frankly meets Parliament with a request for a certain amount of money, and either deliberately or otherwise underestimates the requirements of the year, cannot be deemed a satisfactory public servant. There must of necessity be some un- authorised expenditure, but whon so much as ¿£150,000 out of three-quarters of a million is disbursed without Parliamen- tary authority, there must either be bad management or extravagance. Whatever the faults of the present Government, therefore, they must be credited with rea- sonable circumspection in this regard. The year 1S80-81 began with a revenue deficit of ¿1239,000, and closed with a sur- plus of ¿£27,000, the ordinary expendi tuio having been but slightly less than the revenue. The deficit was really wiped off by the amount of ¿£252,000 transferred from the Ballway Besorves Account. But seeing that, for two yeais previously, ex- penditure had exceeded receipts, it is satisfactory that the scale was turned on the other side in 1SS0-S1, especially when it is seon that the expenditure in that year was ¿281,000 in excess of the dis- bursements for the previous twelve mouths. The loan balance is a matter of much interest, because we are spending a million of British money a-year, and the process, pleasant though it be, cauuot go on for ever. It seems that the actual loan cash balance on 30th June last was £1,231,211. Since that time another million's woith of debentures has been placed, which makes tho amount of loan money now actually avail- able nearly two and a-quarter mil- lions sterling. At the present rate of expenditure, our public works and immi- gration can be carried on for over two years, or until July, 18S3. Until that time has expired, therefore, there will bo no cause for anxiety should provision meanwhile be made for some other method of maintaining the flow of British capital into tho colony. But if no such provision is so made, the people of Queensland must make up their minds to a very dull time indeed when the loan fund has boon ex- hausted. The sudden cutting off of a stream of capital almost equal to the value of the wool or gold pro- duced in tho colony would probably be attended by disastrous results. If, then, the Legislature should refuse to authoriso the land grant railway projects, or some other equally efficacious method of introducing foreign capital, the Go- vernment will be bound to gradually reduce their loan outlay, so as to make the money at their disposal last three years instead of two. But it may be hoped that no such necessity will arise, and that the authorised public works may be completed within the time originally iuteuded. The total payments made by our Government during the year just ended exceeded three and a-quarter millions sterling, or at tho rate or over ¿£15 per head of the whole population. What this moans is indicated by the fact that in the United Kingdom the Govern- ment expenditure is less than ¿63 per head. ' In connection with the late Parliamen- tary debates, the information that no less than ¿£46,000 was disbursed last year in England by tho Agent-General, and ¿£74G,000 by the Queensland National Bank, the Auditor-General points out the desirableness of extending the opera- tions of his department to the Agent General's office, a suggestion obviously meriting consideration from the Govern- ment. Of the cash balance at the Treasury on the morning of the 1st instant, ¿£239,000 was held by the Government bankers as current account, ¿£300,000 as fixed deposit in Brisbane, and .£793,000 in Lou- don. These figiues indicate that the bank has not sown the seeds of future trouble by making unduly large advances to its customers out of the loan moneys placed in its custody. The other colonial banks have declined Government depositsiu conse- quence of the plethora of moue}'. The rate of interest received by the Govern- ment on its cash balances duriug the year has been-for fixed deposits, from 5 to 3A- per cent ; on current balances in Bris- bane, from 2h to \h per cent; and in London, from 2 to 1¿ per cent. The colony, therefore, loses about 2 per cent on all loan balances not placed at fixed deposit. Our unused loan money is therefore costing us at the rate of ¿£40,000 a-year at the present time, but seeing that the price realised by our last debentures shows an advance of over 9 per cent upon the rate obtained for those placed last year, we have not much reason to complain, for whatever the state of the money market during the next two years our loan fund will not be exhausted, and if money became dear it would benefit rather than trench upon the resources of our Treasury. The gros3 debt of the colony now amounts to thirteen and a quartor millions, eleven millions of which has been actually spent. Mr. Drew gives some interesting in- formation respecting his efforts to keep the various Divisional Boards up to their duty in regard to books and accounts. When these are satisfactorily kept, one, if not the chief condition of successful local government is se- cured. It is, therefore, gratifying to read that the books and accounts of no les3 than fifty-eight boards have been in- spected during the year, and that not- withstanding some shortcomings the Auditor-General finds himself justified in saying that, " In almost every instance a desire has been shown to carry out the improvements suggested by tho inspectors, and there is reason to hope that-speak- ing generally-the divisional accounts are at the present time being kept fairly well." Considering the novelty of local government in the country districts, and the scattered population of many of the divisions, this report must be deemed highly satisfactory. The further state- ment that, " Judging from the reports of the audit inspectors, the divisional rates have been well paid up," is a conclusive answer to those politicians who in op- posing the Divisional Boards Act traded upon the "ignorant impatience of taxa- tion" which is said to characterise British communities. The deplorable feature of Mr. Drew's report is that relating to defalcations. During the year the total amount dis- covered to be in default was nearly £1300. Tho defaulters numbered three, ona since dead, for a small amount ; another, H. S. Martin, for £740 ; and the third, T. H. B. Barron, for £491. Only in the last case, however, does the Treasury appear to have incurred loss, the other defalca- tions having been made good either under a guarantee policy or by payments from relatives ; and even in the last case it is not stated that the amount in default will not be similarly recovered. ____________________________________ Mr. Hemmant had a meeting as large as the only public hall available on Saturday night last would allow, and an audience which beyond doubt was thoroughly sympathetic. He would have had a still more numerous audience it he had obtained the use of a larger building, and that without losing the unanimity of support ac- corded to him. The meetiug was representativo, and showed that thero ia no reason to suppose that Mr. Hemmant, in spite of the hard things Baid of him under the shelter of Parliamentary privilege, bas lost the confidence or reBpect of a large majority of the citizens of Brisbane. They think that, although much has been said in disparagement of his character, it has not yet been mado clear in what manner his public action has been discreditable as a man or un- patriotic aa a colonist. He explained on Satur- day night the manner in which the suspicious circumstances which first aroused his attention were brought under his notice, and he claimed that iu placing before Parliament the facts aa they appeared to him he had oaly per- formed a public duty. The citizens of Bris- bane, or a very largo proportion of them, are evidently not prepared to find in this action any evidence of tho "moral depravity" which has been so freely attributed to him ; nor can he be denied the credit of having accepted the fullest responsibility for his statements, and of having shrunk from no trouble necessary to drive home the chnrgea iuferrod from them. For the rest Mr. Hemmant, in his speech on Saturday, added little of importance to the con- troversy. He recapitulated the allegations and arguments which were fully sot forth iu the recent debates, giving perhaps a little more prominence to a few of the subsidiary points. His speech will not do much towards determining the verdict at which the neutral body in the community-that body by whose decision the final issue of a controversy of this nature is determined-is preparing to arrive. But it was only fair to him that he should have an opportunity of publicly vindicating himself. We were pleased to notice in how few, though severe, terms he dismissed the grosser and purely personal attacks on his former career in this city. The conclusion of the Transvaal difficulty, as it ia to be submitted to the Volksrand, must be regarded as satisfactory on the general ground that if a bad business baa to be finished it ia better to get it out of hand as completely and as quickly as possible. That it baa been a bad buaiuess is iudiapu table. The military aspect of the quarrel ha3 so completely overshadowed every other viow that it has hardly been realised that Great Britain has spent from first to last in this affair, which would be contemptible if it bad not been eo disastrous, as much money as it would suffice a small European State, compelled to fight for its existence, to make a very respectable defeuce, and it appears will now have to pay half-a-million more in compensation. It seems that in making peace the leading desire of tho British negotiators has been to get rid of the trouble. The Transvaal is to bo surrendered absolutely and entirely, and it is devoutly hoped that the Boers will for the future bo lot alone to manage or mismanage their affairs as they choose. Tho amouut of compensation must bo quito largo enough to cover every re.iEonablo claim, for if divided among the British or oven th1» Boer sympathising population of that territory it would equal £100 for every man, woman, and child. Itis to be hoped that tho " loyal " Boera will get none of the money. Their loyalty was for the mo3t part of tho same texture as tho devotion of the English magnates at the court of William of Orango, who encouraged their sons to bo polite to the Chevalier when visiting France, so as to secure the family estates whichever side won. It was a loyalty which did not embarrass the active insurgents in the least degree, but which would no doubt have welcomed a victorious advance of the British troona with effusive demonstrations of joy ________________________________________ Mr. Arthur Macalister, Agent-General for this colony in London, has been very ill for some months past, and lately quite unable to devote the time and attention necessary to the proper performance of the work of his office. Ho has forwarded to the Government the certificates of two medical men as to the infirm state of, his health, and, in compliance with his own request, has been granted sis months' leave of absence. Mr. Thomas Archer has been appoiuted acting Agent-General, aud will immediately take chaigo of the office. ________________________________ On inquiry list evening it was ascertained that no further steps have been taken with regard to the family of Mr. Smith, Hill End, South Brisbane, suspected of being afflicted with smallpox. After tho decided opinion of the three medical gentlemen, Drs. Thomson, Pren- tice, and Wray, that the children are not Buffer- ing from smallpox, it has pot been as yet con- sidered necessary to remove them. The hulk, which was to receive them, was towed up the river on Saturday evening, and lies anchored in the river nearly opposite the Toowong ferry, but it is to be hoped that it will not be necessary to use it for the purpose for which it is intended. _____________________________________ Shortly after 10 o'clock last night a fire broke out on the premises of Mr. B. F. Fabian, general storekeeper, near the corner of Ann and Con- stance streets, Fortitude Valley, resulting in the building being completely gutted. It waa a two-story brick structure, the lower floor being used as a store and the upper as a residence. It appears that when the fire broke out Mrs. Fabian with her child and servant had retired to rest. The servant, before getting into bed, bad been, with a candle in her hand, into an adjoin- ing room upstairs in which she had previously been in the habit of sleeping, but as she was lying down she heard a crackling, and found the room mentioned to be in flames. Mrs. Fabian was alao arouaed by the noise, and she, with her child and the servant, made their escape without difficulty. Senior-constable Huuter, who was on duty in the vicinity, aa soon as he noticed the flames, took charge of the place, while a messenger ran to the fire station and gave the alarm. As the fire waa then entirely confined to the upper portion of the building, the constable, after waiting a short time, allowed the front door to bo opened, and a considerable quantity of goods were got out. The brigade arrived at twenty-five minutes past 10 with reel and hoBe, and no time was lost getting two Btreams of water turned to the -fire. There being no danger of the firo spreading, the brigade confined their attention to the building in which it originated. By 11 o'clock the fire was pretty well subdued, and the crowd that had assembled, seeiug there was no chance of further excitement, began to disperse, The building is insured in the South British Company for £500, and the stock in the same company for a similar amount. There appeared to be a good stock in the store, and a large pro- portion of it must have been either damaged or destroyed. Mr. Fabian is now in Melbourne, on his way from England, whither he has been on a visit. _____________________________________ The lecture of Dr. Simms, on Saturday night, was largely attended, the building formerly used as the United Methodist Chapel, Ann-street, being well filled. The lecturer confined his attention on thia occasion to the significance to be attached to the hair, feet, and hands, na indi- cations of character ; and though the feet and hands can scarcely be said to belong to the science of physiognomy, the doctor made his remarks both interesting and amusing. A good deal of fun wan pot out of the reading of charac- ter from handwriting, a number of young men going up and writing their ucmea on a black board, after which the lecturer give bia opinion of thom very briefly, and ia s uno cases by no means favourably. One young fellow was bluntly told that he waa stingy, aud several learned probably for the first time in their live3-that vanity was one of their leading characteristics. The more detailed examination of subjects of both sexes also proved entertaining. Professor Pepper delivered his first lecture at the theatre on Saturday night. There was not a large audience, but those present were evidently delighted viith the entertainment. The lecturer has a happy colloquial style, which makes his hearers at home with him in a very few minutes. The first part of the lecture was devoted to the subject of light and optics ; the relation of light, heat, and electricity to the mechanism of vibration ; and it was explained how Sir Isaac Newton first discovered the true composition of light. The lecturer gave some extremely beautiful experiments respecting the colour of light, and the gas having been turned very low, and a powerful chemical light pro duced, the pale ghostly shade was thrown on the face and figure of the lecturer. The experi- ments the professor introduced in order to show tho vibrations of sound were very interesting and curious. The most singular portions of the experiments in this part of the lecture were the illustrations on the black screen, showing that "musical notes audible to the ear can be rendered visible to the eye." In one experiment he showed how the sound of music could be, by operating according to certain principles, turned off or on in a similar way to gas. The experiments in connection with the illustration of the concentric rings of colour were very curious. The second part of the lecture was principally devoted to the illustration of the modern system of torpedo warfare, and the dio ramic and dissolving views that are exhibited by ____________________________________ Professor Pepper are really beautiful. It was shown how a torpedo went to work, and the effect of the explosion on the vessel attacked. There were a number of these experiments, all of them being quickly and effectively carried out. The last exhibit was not a ghost, but a suffi- ciently ghastly spectacle - a dancing skeleton, which is produced on the screen as a luminous transparency. The skeleton dances ia a very grotesque style. It is made to take off its skull and toss it up and down with great rapidity, and to perform many antics which must be witnessed to be properly appreciated. The second lecture will take place to-night, and as a novel and curious entertainment, affording both amusement and instruction, we can recommend it to our readers. _____________________________________ The Town Hall was well filled on Saturday night on tho occasion of Professor Anderson's third performance. The professor's feats of jugglery were highly applauded, especially his bird cage and gold fish tricks ; and his fair assistant thoroughly bewildered the audience. The final part of the performance-the distribu- tion of gifts-was not the least appreciated. In a community where the gambling spirit ¡a so strong as iu Brisbane this form of lo.tcry ia always attractive, and the professor iucludea some valuable prizes in bia list.
