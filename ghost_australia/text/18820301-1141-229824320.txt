The Betting Market. Victorian Booms' Report. Notwithstanding tbe liberal price# offered by the riug, both straight out and in doubles, there is up to the present comparatively little buiues< iioue. Probably the reason of tiiis is the glut of put«f» mpptinos in tlip nnioritv of which backer# have come off' second best, and as a natural cou- scquence require time to recoup themselves, or rather, their pockets. Of course, there has been a fair business done in doubles on tho A ustralian Cup and Newmarket Handicap, the prices for wbh'h remain the same, viz., 10U to 3, if not laid. For the Australian Cup. Suwarrow is nominally first favourite at 1U0 to 10, ami the same price i« the best offer about First Water, but pleuty of money could be got at this price. Hesperian i- reported to be nu uulik-ly starter for this race, aod has been inquired for at hundreds to lour for the Newmarktt, A good tew horses hare been backed at prices varying from 100 to 8 to 100 to 4, but in nn case auv way ucar up to tbe extent of the market. Iu lact tJ<c stanles have not made a move as yet, aud all the betting, #0 far, has been done by the public, or those who fancv thev know something. Narrabri'# recent wins have caused some iuquirv for him at outside prices, and Blue Ribbou's performance# on the training grouud have brought hia name forward, while, if a move were mode in favour of either Bosworth or Royal Maid, they would speedily be at the top of quotations. Surrey, Larpent, Tyropean, Ghost, Verdure, Tumult, Cremoruc and Aureola appear most ou the field can. be obtained, aud at present notbiug has been backed sufficiently to make a decided favourite. The other events of the Autnmn Meeting haTe scarcely been noticed. A few books have been started ou the Hurdle aud Steeple at 100 to 5 and 4, Haudy Andy and Red Hover beiug most fancied for the Hurdle, with Great Western, Hieroglyph, Twilight and Lucy for the Steeple. Darebin is best favonrite for the Leger, o to 2 beiug freely taken, 2 to 1 the best offer. Commotiou coining next in demand at 4 to 1 wanted, 3 to I offered. Bowes' TattersslTs Report.
