Short Skirts. A writer in the London " Daily News" I says " there really seems to be no reason why ladies who have confidence in their ankles should not wear short skirts. These are not indecorous, they do not drag in duet and mud, and most women wear them in the Highlands ~ and on the Alps. "Dear Lucy Stone," we hear, was at the Conference ; she had been a Bloomer, arid was not ashamed of it. Why should^she have been aBhamed ? Ridicule killed " blooming," but people should not mind ridicule. All great innovators have been laughed at. " It is," says a lady, " the Psychic moment for Bhort skirts." This lady, not unnaturally, had become confused at Chicago. The Psychic people did hold a conference, but their talk was of ghosts, not of short skirts, which they regard as indifferent. The ' psychological moment ' was what Mrs Malaprop, of Psvchago, I mean Chicago, had in her mind." These are the sentiments of a man of taste and observition.
