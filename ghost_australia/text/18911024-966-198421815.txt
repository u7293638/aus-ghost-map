THE SEA MIST. It creepeth slowly o'er sea and land, A curtain dropped by an unseen hand O'er marsh and river, o'er sea and sky. Some weird euchantur is surely by! 'Tlie trees are motionless, winds are still. And hushed the voice of the rippling rill; Tbe dew-drops gleam on the whitened ground. And ev'ry where is the mist around. Now sweeping by like a veiled form All toss'd and torn by a winter storm; Or dim procession of silent ghosts Tliat Iniiry by lo their midnight posti. Do mermaids rise from the liiddeu sea To dance in merriest revelry'! Do fairies march through the darkened dale Secure from sight 'neatb the friendly veil? Would some sweet spirit of love and light Fain pass unwatclieu through the moonlit night To whisper low to a weary heartâ€” A heaven-sent message of pe,ce and rest? Perchance God's messenger bears to earth The spark that kindles a soul to birth; Perchance the Angel of Death flies near With one who linger? no longer here. As silent it came so it passes away; Tbe moon brenks out o er the swelling bay; From moor and mountain, from wood andstream, 'file mist has rolled like a fairy dream. K. L P.
