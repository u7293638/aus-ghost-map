GEMS OF THOUGHT. "Thinlc.truly, and thy thought '.shall be a fruitful seed." Of time murdered thero is a' ghost, which wo term Ennui. . t . . Every modal has its rovorso and every mou- dlor is suro'to meet with ono. ' A good word is an easy obligation ; but not to speak ill requires only our silence, which costs us nothing. A man that studlnth revenge keopeth his own wounds green which otherwiso would heal and uo well.

Perfect wisdom hath four parts, viz., wis dom, the principle of doing .things aright ; justice, the principlo of doing things equally iu public and private; fortitude, tho principle of not flying danger, by ; mooting it; and: tem perance, tho princi(flo of subduing desires, and living moderately.— Plato.: Alternation is law of .our nature. All' our faculties must bo employed in 'turn— labor must interchange with leisure, gravity, with : gaioty, thought with diversion/' There is. no lesson more needed than this one of chnnge. The bow must first bu bout' before it can bo relaxed, and mly by a life of useful industry in some direc tion can anyone be capablo of real enjoyment. Make tlio best of what you have rather than make your life miserable by wishing for what you have not.
