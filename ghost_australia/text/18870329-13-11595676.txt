BISHOP GOES FAREWELL TO HIS PARISHIONERS. " Parting Words is the title of a pamphlet containing the two farewell sermons delivered by Bishop Goe, in the parish church of St George, Bloomsbury where he has ministered for the last ten years They are full of affectionate remembrance of the relationship in which he has stood toward his people, with a deep feeling of the responsi- bility of the man who professes to enlighten others on the objects of faith and the conduct of life and with an earnest exhortation to his hearers to cling firmly to the principles of Christianity which they have received The sermons, however, are interesting to '\ is serious, not only because they represent the summing up of no inconsiderable portion of the Bishops teaching and life, but also be cause they afford no indication of the tone which he will bring to the colonial church, noel of the beliefs which he will feel himself bound to support Dr Goe, it need hardly be said, is of the Evangelical school Its special phraseology), its metaphors, its hopes, its form of appeal to the feelings of an audience, are all visible in every) line His preaching abounds in the old pictures of the future, which have an mrs a power and dreaming even to the minds of those who have departed furthest from the beaten path way of the faith of centuries But he fully recognises at the same time the value of the other forms which the Bank of religion assumes "Divine truth, he says, is a vast circle so ample in its sweep that a finite mind can grasp a segment of it here and there, but not the whole Our knowledge of truth is fragmentary, now we know in part ' It is not given to any one man, nor even to me one section of the Church, to discern truth in its entirety, nor to assign to each particular truth its just proportion in relation to other truths His view of religious differences is that best suited to the episcopal mind, it episcopal), with its concentration of government, is to preserve the independence "Every man who has been moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon him this office and ministry has his own message to deliver a message which he only can cue ' Bishop Goe appears to be endowed with the inestimable gift of a large common sense, and w is a faculty of putting the highest truths in the most practical way His eloquence is not the eloquence of the schools, but rather of the man who is deeply convinced of the importance of the message which he is called upon to deliver, and speaks earnestly from the heart His style and doctrine may be gauged by the following extract, which forms the conclusion of one of the sermons -"If we, then, would len rise the manifestation of the power of God in keeping our feet without slipping as we pursue our pilgrimage here below, and in presenting us faultless before the presence of His glory, with exceeding you on the day of his appeal a rag, and with unbelief, for it is our greatest enemy , it is the most fatal hindrance to our salvation Cultivate a simple, earnest child-like confidence in your Heavenly father's power, cast yourselves wholly on His previous promises which are firm and un changeable is the everlasting hills, and you shall know here in fact, more fully here alter, that He is faithful that calleth you "
