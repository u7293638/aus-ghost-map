THE CONSECRATION. Lest Monday morning, in tho presence of a very great concourse of persons, the Anglican Cathedral of St. Andrew, in this city, was consecrated according to the rites, and ceremonies of the Church of England by the Metro-. politan Bishop (the Right Rev. Dr. Frederick Barker), ; who was assisted by the Suffragan Prelates the Bishops, of Adelaide, Melbourne, Newcastle, Brisbane, Goulburn, and Tasmania together with the Dean of Sydney, Canon Vidal, Stack, King, and O'Reilly, " and a large body of clergymen. This fine building has, therefore, after the lapse of of many tedious years, at length been opened for the performance of Divine service, in conformity with the use of the Church of England. Having already laid before our renders some few particulars in respect of the history of this remarkable structure, and a general description of the entire edifice, we shall now, without further preface, give a brief find 6om prehensive account of all the proceedings having reference" to the consecration of this church, which took place on the 30th ultimo, being St. Andrew's Day. j At half-past 10 o'clock the Metropolitan and his six Suffragan. Bishops began to assemble in the temporary building on the north side of the Cathedral, where they were joined by upwards of seventy clergymen. Tkenco too Prelates (in their episcopal habits) with their clergy (vested in hoods, stoles, and 'surplices;) walked in procession across the enclosure on the north of the church to the Great Western entrance, where they were met, at about five minutes to 11 o'clock, by the Very Rev. Dean Cowper, with other members of the ' Chapter of the Cathedral. 1 here the Dean, on behalf of the Chapter, presented to the Metropolitan the formal petition for the consecration of the Cathedral Church of St., Andrew, and the document was read aloud by Mr. Barker, the regis trar of the diocese. The Metropolitan Bishop intimated that it was his intention to comply with the prayer of the petition, whereupon the Dean and Chapter having joined in the procession, the Metropolitan (followed by the other Bishops and clergy in attendance), proceeded up the middle (history the Silver, repeating alternately the- 24th Psalm (Domini est terra). The Bishops having taken their places within the Communion Rails, the sentence of consecration was read by the Chancellor and signed by the Metropolitan. The document was handed to the Registrar to be registered, which being done it was returned by that officer to the Bishop, and by him laid upon the Communion Table. Then the Metropolitan standing on the north side of the Lord's Table turned to the congregation and, said :-" Dearly beloved in the Lord, forasmuch OF devout and holy war, as well under the Law as under the Gospel, moved either by the secret inspiration of the Holy Ghost, or by the express command of God; or by their own reason and sense of order and decency, have erected noises for the public worship of God, and separated them from all, profane and common uses; which godly practice hath a manifest tendency to fill men's minds with a becoming reverence, to the Divine Majesty, and to affect their hearts with devotion and humility in the service of God let us humbly hope that our Heavenly Father will favourably approve of our present purpose of setting apart this place in solemn manner for the performance of the several offices of religious worship and let us faithfully and devoutly ht g His blessing on this our undertaking Then followed the Lord's Prayer, in which the whole congregation (consisting of more than two thousand persons) joined and next, was said the prayer "O, Eternal God ; " after which, the Metropolitan repeated the six collects having special reference to the future ministrations of the Church in that building, imploring Divine blessing upon the same. The morning service then commenced, the Propor- Psalms being the 84th, the Â£22nd, and the 132nd. The First ties son was taken from the eighth chapter of the First Book of Kings, from the 22nd to the 62nd verse. This lesson was read by the Very Rev. the Dean of Sydney.

The first hymn was, " Christ is made the sure Foundation "-(St. Worburgh) and the second, that before the sermon, was the well known hymn beginning with these words-" Jesus calls us o'er the tumult," s:c. (Batt). In consequence of the length of the service there was no voluntary. The prees and responses were Tnlhb's, and the Venue, that by Philip Hayes. The chant of the Proper Psalms were by Hine, W.

The appearance of the interior during the services was very striking, the multitude of worshippers, and occasional bursts of music having; a most impressive effect. Mr. Montague Younger presided at the organ, and, it is almost needless to say, did full justice to the remarkable powers of that instrument. The chanting was excellent; indeed the entire service appeared to give very great satisfaction to all present, many of whom had never before seen the interior of St. Andrew's.
