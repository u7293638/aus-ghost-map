One evening, finding hlmseit unusually late for dinner, my friend pro ceeded to run down the central Stair case the walls of wlilch were hung with large portrailts. Suddenly two strong arms were laid on his shoulders and held Mm back. He turned round in dignant. to find no one anywhere near. At that moment a life-sized Portralt two steps from where lie stood fell with a crash to the ground, breaking the balustrade and the stair to atoms. Had he not been detained he 'would have been killed."
