AN EXTRAORDINARY DEATH. How queerly we may be killed in one of the mOEt interesting points for observation in the study of mortality. The 'Age 'gives a case in point that is worth reprinting A large circle of acquaintances in the legal profession and the defence force, will learn with regret of the death of Major S. Cri ep, which took place late on Sunday evening at bis residence, llalnnna, Auburn- road, Haw thnrn. In civil life liaior Crisn waia well known solicitor, of the tirm of Messrs. Crisp and Cameron. His connection with the military force dates back to 1876, wken he joined the Kast Melbourne field artillery in the old volunteer force, and he had reached the rank of captain on tlie disbaadmeat. fie continued his connection with the service is a battery of teld artillery and went en the reserve of officers in 1886. As a lawyer he subsequently joined tke head quarters staff in 18141 as deputy judge advocate, the legal adviser of courts martial. His death at the comparatively early age of 48, is the close of a p&ia;'sl and singular iilaesi, which Jbe attributed to aa apparently trivial accident. He wsnt to the artillery camp at 8unbu.ry the Raster before last, and at dianer one evening his throat was pierced by a hst bone. 6ince that time be was unable to cat any solid food. The healing of the wound cauBed a stricture of the gullet, and it was with difficulty that a course should be kept clear for even liquid aonrishmeat. Though acute gastritis is mentioned as the immediate cause of death, the original sonrce of tlie trouble was the wasting d*e to the difficulty of receiving nourishment, and for about a year past Major Crisp looked but a ghost of bis former self. He took an active interest in military matters up to a late date, and was present at. the ceremony of theopenimg cf Parliament, and also was at tbe last caasp at Langwarrin. He leaves several children and a widow, who is sister to the widow Â«f the late Major Blannia.
