TRIAL OF A BAND OF BRIGANDS. (FIIOM TUB Euaor-EAN MAIL-.) A li ml has been going on at Szegedm, ni Hungary, the extraordinary complicated and diamatic history of which is destined to occupy a conspicuous place amongst tho criminal íecords of all countnes and epochs The individuals involved may be counted by bundi eds-their crimes and offences by thousands, and the first arrests took place as far back ns 1860 The Lloyd of Pesth gives an outline of the case undei the title of the " Prods Sandor"- Sandorbomgthe name of the chief of a band of malefactors whose depredations and atrocities íendered them the terror of Szcgedm and tho surrounding district It appears that, evei since 18G0, the inhabitants of S/cgcdm had become so terrified in consequence of the daring exploits of Sandor s band of bl igands that they locked and barred themselves m their houses at dusk, and daied not to venture into the streets even dining the day without being aimed with íevoheis and swoidsticks Robberies, incendiary files, and assassi- nations weie tho oidei of the day M de Radaywas sent asa Royal commiBBionei to Szegedm to put an end to tins deplorable state of things M de Radny soon became convinced that not only Szcgedm but the whole comttat and the surrounding districts weie infested by foimidablo " companies" of brigands, whose organisation was complete nnd then cnclo of action clearly denned After careful and minute inquines the Royal commissionci found, to his amazement, that a number of odmmistiatire and judicial functionaries weie acting as accomplices of tho vanouB banda of brigands-that even the titled notabilities of the district acted as le cen eis of the stolen piopertj Crimes have been hi ought to light which weie perpotrated 30 j ears ago , and an old man of 70 was con- demned some short time ago for a anne committed when ho was 40 years of age The novel and pecuhaily "psychological" system pursued by tho Royal commissionei in oidei to find out tho guilty parties amongst the hundreds of individuáis airested is woith recording The pnsonois were complotely isolated Iiom tho lest of tho world during then confinement, and their eyes wei o bound in order to prevent any conversation by signs usually resorted to by accomplished thieves " Companions m captivity," totally unknown to them, were placed in the same cells, who soon insinuated themselves into the con lidcncc of thepijsoncre, studied their elia racters, made themselves acquainted with their secrets, and used all their efforts to bring about a full confession With regard to Sandor, the royal commissioner himself succeeded m getting t full and complete avowal of Ins crimes by adopting tactics of a most ingenious kind Knowing the great bngand chief to be exceedingly \ain of his reputation, and to be in the habit of looking down upon his less danng accomplices as mere "purlomers of chickens," M de Raday ordered Sandoi to fall upon his knees before his fellow pnsoners-the small fry of the band-whose instructions were to reproach their chief with being a chicken stealerhke themselves The rase was perfectly suc- cessful the in oud Sandor s ' honour'was mortally wounded, and the " brigand king ' (as he loved to style himself) immediately entered into a full confession of his long series of crimes, as well as those of his accomplices The expedientresortcd to hythe royal commis sioner m the case of another famous brigand, named Jean Bajdor, was this -Bajdor is known to be exceedingly superstitious , he is charged with having committed two mur tiers, and insists upon asserting his mno cence One evening, the examining magis trate had Bajdor brought into his cabinet, and immediately addressed him as follows - "John Bajdor, I cannot sleep on yom ac- count, the ghost of Peter Bodn, whom you assassinated, appears before me every night, and threatens to haunt and tonnent me until such time as I shall have put the rope with which you strangled jour victim lound your own neck 1" On saying this, the ex- amining magistrate threw a lope lound Baj doi s neck, and oidered him to be taken back to pnson At midnight John Bajdor, w ho had slept soundly, notwithstanding Ins C9 dimes, jumped up affrighted, and lushed towards the door of his pnson, crying for help This was the moment the examining magistrate had anxiously awaited , he made his way into the cell, when Bajdor confessed not only to having murdeied Bodn and Ins son, but also to having committed a numbei of other heinous crimes In consequence of these disclosuies the two bodies of his victims, with the lopes still round their necks, weie discovered Acting on Bajdoi s advice a numbei of othei pnsoneis have made free confession of the enmes they had com mitted all the malefactois arrested, it must not be forgotten, aie kept m the utmost ignorance as to the chaigcs which weigh against them On then hist examination they weie not questioned as to the perpetra- tion of such or such a crime, they were simply asked to give an account of any offence of winch they might acknowledge themselves guilty By this means a number of enmes have been brought to light luthei to totally un- suspected An idea of how desirable a place Szcgedm must have been to live in may be formed fiom the following enumeration of the cases which aie now being tned before a specially appointed couit When the Royal commissioner hist ai lived at Szcgedm there weie 1,500 cnminal chaiges tobo heard, a littlelatei 500 more chaiges were made , and when the Royal commission had terminated its duties 950 fresh cases were brought to light, making m all nearly 3 000 enmes of the gravest chaiactei Of this total 1000 judgments have already been given, and neaily all these judgments have been con linned on appeal The eûmes and oflences discovered by the Royal commission amount to 8,000 The pnncipal chaiges are those of muidei, lobbery, pillage, mcendiansm, Kc, the cases of robbery alone exceeding 4,000 WHOLESALE FORGERY BY A CLERGYMAN (rltOJl THF EUROPE VN

(It will be remembered the murder was committed during Tuesday night.) He then went up stairs again, and not feeling well, wished to have a second bed to himself, so as not to disturb his wife He had the next room, which opened witli folding doors into the one he was occupying At 12 o'clock he rang for some camomile tea which was taken up to him, and his wife re- mained sitting up with him till i o'clock in the morning." The "Boots " states that the hotel-door is always kept fastened, and no one can go out or enter without the door being unfastened for him. Dr. Hcssel nevei went out that night, ne got up on Christ- mas Day about 12. He alwajs left his boots outside tho door; they were outside at 12 on Christmas Eve, and at the door at 0 on Christmas morning, when he brought them clown to clean. Other inmates in the house are also able to give corroborative evidence.
