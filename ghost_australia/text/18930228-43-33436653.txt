There he either took his vat under th* ahsdy trees, or stood loaning against th* rsiling* of the Mow; aad frotn thi* comfortable point of vantage h* looked upon the fashionable world, -rarve-ring it calmly, critically bat with supreme disdain.

Hi* companion was another old soldier. Jack Carrnihers, also a w*ll- pr**orvt-d, and moro dandified man, with very black hair and moustachios, that owed somerthing to art. and a nair of still keen, dark eye*. Ho hsd left the Army aarly and without gaining hik-h rank, prefarring a lite of s-rc?trr independence, and freedom to fo'low his own bent. A raeculiar and strongly marked trait in his character was inqoisitivenes. ; he suffered from a curiosity which, as he grew older, came to a perfect cra/e. He wm for ever prying into other people's affairs ; he knew, or tried to know, everybody's baitine*., tbeir priv.t-i mean*. ivaja of "life, put htstoriu, pesdigrre*** and everything about them. So weld w.s he knoxvn as a walking vade-mecum that " ask .lark Carnithcr." wa. the invariable recom mendation when any ob*cure or mysterious point arose. It he could not supply the ■ ncoevsary information then and there, he fraukly said, •' I don't know ; I'll find out in a day or tw..." and he always did r?. They called him " I'ollacky's man " at the club, | from liis persistent quickness in following up a clue. Now these two well dressed snd outwardly rarela-s. veterans were basking in the sun shine, and passing their remarai upon the mixed crowd that were parading before them.

" But what baa he done ? Why do you call him a blackguard:" •' About women. Come* of being a chip, I tappet*," -aid Jack, complacently, as hs curled the waxed ends of hii moustachio*. He had been somewhat of a " dog" him sell" iv his day. " Couldn't help himself. You've, gut sometime* to beat them off with your umbrella. They're all alike—these women." " I don't like such talk," said the simple, chivalrous, old troo-*sr reprovingly. He had snrlrrcd severely, acutely, at the hands of one, but could not believe th*t all were bad. "Are yen going to reform the world. I lad 1 that's good—Tom Brandling turned virtuous 1 Shall there b* so more cake and ale r' " I don't understaad you.

His di-comtiture, the wholo scene had been obtcrved by two interested spectators. Ono, of course, was " Trooper Tom," who ahrewdly guessed what it all meant: tbe other wa* a rather faded, languid-looking lady in a far oorner, who, through her long tortoi—bell-h—died eye-glaatci. had kept close watch on tho yonng girl's prooeeding*. It was to bar that Lord Ripley now inailo hi. way, with a shrug of his shoulders and tin air of much annoyanoe. Ho took a seat by her aide, and sat there talking earnestly, with some vehemence indeed, until at but Captain Cleygate brought back tbe truant, and, regardless of the elder lady*, frowni— face, *uxTa-odet*e*l her to her mother. What "she whispered to her daughter must have been reproof, for the latter, without diadainieur to answer, pale-faced and deSant, accepted Lord Ripley's arm and wu led away. "Shall I interfere! .Shall Igo up aad speak, now and at once—or am I premature ? Carruthen promised to let me know more, positively, within a week. t'ntit then, p-ir h*pt, I had better wait." But eve-nte were hurrying forward inde pendent of " Trooper Tom." Half an hour atar he wu wandering" to and fro, having lost sight of the only f?c* he cared to see. When passing s rather retired boudoir, he heard voice*, raised high—a man's, passionate, dictatorial; a woman's, weaker, but loudly indignant. " You shall not go, Marion—not till yen have antwered differently. I will not be denied. I love you—adore you— I cannot do without you 1" " Again, Lord Ripley, I tell you that I eaa never, saver, care for you." "Yonr mother fully approve*. She hu •ncouraared me to apeak to you. She hu u •ured m. that yoa would not refuse me," I do refuse you now, finally, and without th* smallest nsaitation. Take me back to h*r at otioe, if you rJctate.'' " No,so, wait, darling; I implore yoa, give sse a little hope." " Lord Ripley, why do you persecute mo like thii r It is unmanly, unworthy of you I Let me past! I will go ! You shall not detain mt. Oh ! how dare you .'" Ha had uiaed bar two glored hinda in hia, and held her t_re. resitiag and h.lpleaxt, whil* he kiiud htr furiously on her hair, her mow- whit* shoulders, and at lut ber lip*. But next minute he wss reeling acros* the room from a well-directed hlow. The old soldier who had constituted hinxself her pro tector had interr-cased with the only argument that i* effective ia such a situation. Lord Ripley, recovering quickly, was the first to speak. " You accursed old scoundrel . VTiio snd what do you call yourself I By what right do y..u interfere 1" '• The very belt that of a gentleman who finds a lady in distress, and insulted and out rairt-d by a cad. Stand aside now. If you don't, by I'll make you !" The throat was sufficient to keep Lord llipley at bay, and, without paying him farther iittention, Colcael Branding turned to the agitated but ttill undaunted girl, and •aid: [ " Madam, let me oiler you my arm. i will e-cort yc-u to the bald,room, and reatois you \- to your mother's care." " Oh, thank you, thank you, s thousand , tine* ! " she whispered, aa she clung to hia [ arm ami nestled closely under his protectinir wist. " Why aro yoi- so kind .'

He evaded the question, and was almost I glad when he found Lord Ripley barriiijr the doorway, and saying fiercely: ; " Y'.u shall not leave this room until you et*aUtu your interference.
