CORDUROY. (BY THE SHADE OF THOMAS CAMPBELL.) At last the dreaded hour is come, That brings me on to thee; I see the planks transversely laid, I mark each riven tree. It jars my nerves—it shakes my heart, My joints are out of gear, Yet must we pass o'er Corduroy Or camp for ever here. I tremble at my awful doom, While others hoarsely swear; To hope to pass across alive, Is more than I can dare. Oh, Corduroy! Oh, Corduroy! With such a heavy load; What leathern springs can stand the strain, Upon thy rugged road? Your furrows deep and ridges high, Like corrugated zinc, Must be some vengeful fiend's device To torture man, I think. Oh! little did I once suppose That I should feel the rack, And writhe, while all my ligaments And sinews snap and crack. Another shock! oh, when shall I A moment's respite feel? My torments, like St, Catherine's, Are all upon the wheel. The driver mocks my moans and groans; The passengers all curse; My mouth is filled with liquid mud, And theirs with something worse. Another jolt, just like the last, My life will quite destroy: It comes!—My ghost shall haunt the man Who laid this Corduroy.
