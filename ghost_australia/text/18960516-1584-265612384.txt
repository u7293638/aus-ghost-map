It seems to tlirive in low, marshy spots, and springs up from delayed logs or from crevices in the rocks The largerand older bulbs frequently send up tbe leaf stalks siK or seven feet in height, and from these, which are joined, broad lanceolflted leaves are thrown out in pairs/'The plant is an annnal, and'in June, July, and August the flower stalks start up from the base of the bulb, ilevotius all their energies ;to the formation of the buds. ' ' The buds are arranged oil the stalks much like those of the hyacinth, the usual niimber' for a well-grown stalk to bear beinq Jrom twelve to fifteen.
