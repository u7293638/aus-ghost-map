. Victoria Racing Club. THE GRAND NATIONAL MEETING. (FHOU '* CA8PXIK.") r ' -; MELEOUKKE, Saturday. Notwithstanding the unpropitious Btate of the weather " . during Saturday morning, it aid not deter a large con " couree of people aesembhng, perhaps the largest gathering: eincethe inauguration of the Grand National meeting at Flemington. Altnough steady rains fell, the course "was in : good going- ordor, but in places slightly heavy. Soveral ; accidents occurred during the afternoon, the most serious, ' perhaps, hoing that of Croker, thc rider of Tantaliser, who, ou being conveyed to tho hospital, it was ascertained had sustained concussion of the brain. The Steeplechase horse Loo was badly injured throiurh a fall at the back of tho course, and he had to be destroyed. The green and while spots of Corrigan, the ever popular rider across country, again were a success in sieering Hippogriff ' in the Grand Maiden Hurdles, and Wymlett m the Grand ' Steeplechase. Sheet Anchor was greatly interfered with twice in the hurdle mee, especially when Omadhann came -' down. The reins got tnngleu in the fetlocks of thc favorite, nearly bringing him down, for ho never tried afterwards. Bub it is questionable whether anything could have beuten The Agent, Some rteople inncy Guardfish would have won " " had he been ridden a waiting race in front, but it is ques- tionable, so fast caine tho winner. The New South Wales ' horse, Student, is perhaps a trifle butler than ho wns given , credit for; After starting in the Grand Hurdles, he . caddied up and comfortably won the Selling Hurdles from another old identity, Flauiborough, the winner eurieh l ing tho club by £140. In the Steeplechase it appeared strange to witness such accomplished fencers as Gran-1 ville stumble at the third obstacle, then Moonlight, Meander, MOITCH, then the pony Minerva, followed hy Leek and Progress, later on Native. M'lvor, wno rode Progress, received a nasty shaking, and was injured in- ternally. The following amount of stakes will be paid over at tho meeting to-day :-£2-410. The Ballarat divi sion weie good winners over the meeting. Maiden Hurdle Bace, a sweepstakes of 5 sov3 each, 1 ft, v with 203 added.
