GUNNING. A concert in aid of the Catholic Church, Gunning, was given by the Yass minstrels aided by several ladies of the district on Friday evening, the 11th instant, at the Prince of Wales Theatre. The per formance commenced with an overture by the min strels, followed by the chorus Strike Boys, Strike ; Put Mc in My Little Bed, by Mr. James Smith; Robert Turner then gave The Lincoln Gun-Boat; John Fonville, The Lily of the Lake; J. Mitclhell, The Hen Convention, which was encored, and the last verse was repeated ; Mr. Flaherty gave Silver Threads amongst the Gold, after whicel there was an interval of ten minutes. The second part of the performancevwas opened by Miss Kellaher in Such is Life; Miss James ren dered a song in her esual finished style; Miss. E. Me Leod gave Sour Crout. The remainder of the programme consisted of pieces 1by the minstrels, and wound up with tlie laughable farce of tihe Ghost in the Pawn-Shfop. I must say that Mrs. Mc Leod rendered most important service as accompanist. I understand that the sum of Â£20 was realized on the occasion. On Wednesday evening last at about eight p.m. an alarm of fire was heard in Yass- street. This came from Mr. F. Lawliss's hotel. It appears that Mr. Lawliss was in bed at the time. A candle which was left burning near the bed set fire to the light curtains, and in a moment all was in flames. Mr. Lawliss being fast asleep, had to be dragged out of the burning bed. This was beyond doubt a very narrow escape and ought to serve as a caution to others. Our sheep and cattle yards are just on the eve of completion, and will be just the thing when finished. Strong winds and rain have been the order for the last five or six days. To-day (Monday) it is blowing a perfect gale with indications of more rain. W. R. Reynolds, auctioneer, sold a mixed lot of sheep, 198, at 9/2 per bead.
