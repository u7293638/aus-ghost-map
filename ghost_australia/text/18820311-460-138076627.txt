FOURTH DAY.-TUESDAY, MABCH 7. To-day at noon, Shrewsbury and Peate resumed (heir places, and when the score stood at 134, the former was caught at mid on close in by Boyle. 10-47-134. Shrews bury, who played a capital game, well deserted his cans, and not the ghost of a chance can be urged against him. The wicket was rather in favour of the bowler, and the bowling averages con sequently read tolerably well, Garrett securing six for 75, and Palmer four for 44, The fielding was very good throughout, Blackham'especially deserving praise for his good wicket- keeping. After the usual inter-, val, the Australians having chosen a new wicket, started their second innings by sending in Maasie and A.'Banrierman to the bowling of Peate and Bates. Maasie, who at once commenced to score, speedily but 9 together, and then was caught at point by Midwinter off Peate. 1 for 14. Murdoch was next, and after cutting Bates for 4, was well caught by Midwinter out in the long-field. 2-4-2L. Horan had only joined Alick when luncheon was atijQbtned for. and on resuming, the score waa increased to 39, when Alick waa fiven oat eaaght at the wickets by Pilling off 'eate. 3-14-89. The little stonewaller Elayed steadily and well for his contribution. ['Donnell was next, and at 49 he let out at Peate, and was well held by Emmett at xnid-off. 4-9-49. Jones joined Horan, and these two by good steady play won the match, Horan having 16 (not out) to his credit, and Jonetf 6 not out. The wicket was all in favour of the bowlers, especially the end to which Peate bowled, and therefore the good stand of the Australians is very credit able nnder the circumstances. There can be no doubt that the best team won, and this would be tifte opinion bf-anyone who gave the relative merits of the two teams his impar tial consideration. The game was over at * few minutes past 3, and as it waa regarded aa a certainty for Australia after the thud day's play, it is hardly necessary to say that the attendance was very limited. The best feeling prevailed throughout the match, and the general wish was expressed that the matches to be played in the old country by the Australians might be conducted in as agree* able and harmonious a manner as that now under report. Peate and Bates bowled their best, and they were well supported in the field, bnt still the runs came, and the newly-formed Australian team have the pleasure of being able to mt that they hare defeated a team re presentative of the strength of the players of England. Peate'a figures are worth noticing, namely, 100 balls, 14. runs, 18 maidens, $ wickets. Bates, who bad to bowl against a strong wind, sent down 99 balls for 43 runs, 13 suddens, and 1 wicket The fielding itas capital, and the Englishmen made every effort to stem the tide of victory, bat the star of Australia was in the ascendant, and so your reporter has to chronicle a gloriops victory by 4 runs and 6 wickets.
