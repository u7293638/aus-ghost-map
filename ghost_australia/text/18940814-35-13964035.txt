DR. TALMAGE FINAL LECTURE. In the Town Hall last night the Rev Dr Talmage, in the presence of a very large audience, rope tied, with some slight variations, his lecture, as formerly delivered, on Evolution, the full title of the lecture being, " Where do we come from' Are two children of God or children of gorillas " The audience was is a whole as appreciative and enthusiastic as Dr Talmage' audiences tiistooianly are For the first time in Sydney there was at one point and apparently only from one person, audible expressions of dissent, but these were not sufficiently vehement to cause dis- order and were only of short duration It is probable that this utterance of Evolution has provoked more special discussion and in- cidentally more emphatic notice, both approv- ing and condemnatory, than, perhaps, any other in the lecturer's so now hut extensive repertoire His attitude as concerns the case for Evolution is distinctly antagonistic while his own contentions are for the great r p trt rather to keeping this definitely critical Commencing' with the statement that ' there is no call c* between genuine series and ray elation," and adding that the majority of the great discoverers in the "central c held b ivo held the Bible to be installed and the Bible version of the creation coiiFcquontly accurate he said that between science, falsely so-called and religion there is open war, and one or the other must put down Li solution," he said, in the fact phi o is up-and-down, out-and-out infidelity In the second place, it is contrary to all the facts of science and in the third place it is brutalising in its tendency "-in which indictment it may be said that the main contentions of the lecturer s utterance were stated in brief " I say nothing now against infidels " he continued " I'm not preaching now I'm lecturing 1 Thomas Fame, and Hume and VolUiro no more disbelieved the Bible than do those scientists who proclaim 1 volution " If he said the leading evolutionists were placed on the witness stand, it would be found that they disbelieved the Holy Scriptures as a whole the Bible story of the Croatian, the truth of the Gospel narratives concerning Christ's miracles, the vicarious atonement of Christ, the regenerating power of the Holy Ghost, and the efficacy of human supplication directed heavenward That was itiitd"»htv Herbert Spencer proposed to test one of these points by taking two hospital words, and having the home es of one prayed for and the patients in the other let alone He Dr Talmage) at once pointed out the impossibility of such a test, " for," said he, "just as you get the experiment going some loving old woman some night, will forget clean all about the experiment and pray for all sufferers " (Laughter ) in the Bible account of the creation God said, " Let us make man in our own image, and He created him in His own image . male and female created He them " and He breathed into them the breath of life, the whole story," said Dr Talmage, " setting forth the idea, not of a perfect kangaroo or orang-outang but of a perfect man (Hear hear and applause ) off put against that the Evolutionist accounts Away back in the ages there were four or five primal forms or
