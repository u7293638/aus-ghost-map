THEATRE ROYAL. lnere was quite a large house at the Theatre last evening. Professor Perring's enter! ainment has evidently taken a hold on_ the people of Castlemaine, and we are quite sure that if he were to repeat the exniDition nignt alter night he would still secure full attendances. The experiments illus trative of popular fancies with reference to cun- jurors and " fire-eaters" were as usual quite suc cessful. The dissolving views were received with the most cordial appreciation, as well they deserve. But the " ghosteses"— for there is more than one spiritual resurrection — were as much admired by the adult spectators as they were feared by the more timid. They were in fact too genuine realities. But of all the attempts to amuse an audience which we have witnessed of late, commend ns to the " Optical Pantomime," which was introduced at the close of the evening. W e shall not attempt to describe this rollicking piece of Jack- o -lantern. -It is beyond descrip tion. We will, howeyer, " go bail" that there is not to be found within a radius of 100 miles a single person so: constitutionally splenetic that he can refuse to laugh at the drolleries which Messrs. .Perry , and Francis, and their clowns, exhibit " behind the scenes " in this " optical pantomime." We understand that the per formance will only be given for one or two nights longer, and those who wish to pass an evening of intellectual enjoyment, combined- with positive fun, should not allow tlie occasion to slip. We think that if Mr Perring would arrange for an afternoon performance of the dis solving -views and the Pantomime, there would I be a good muster of children.
