[?] The incident is from the " Love Stories of Parthenius," who preserved fragments of a lost epic on the expedition of Aohilles against Lesbos, an island allied with Trov. The daughter of the Lesbian king Within her bower she watched the war, . Far off she heard the arrows ring, The smittan harness ring afar ; And. fighting from the foremost car, Saw one that smote where all must flee ; ' More fair than the Immortals are He seemed to fair Pisidich She saw, she loved him, and her heart Before Achilles, Peleus' son, Threw all its guarded gates apart, A maiden fortress lightly won I And, ere that day of fight was done, No mora of land or faith recked shq, But joyed in her new life begun — Her life of love, Pisidioft 1 She took a gift into her hand, As one that had a boon to crava ; She stole across the ruined land Where lay the dead without a grave, And to Achilles' hand she gave Her gift, the secret postern's key. " To morrow let me be thy slave 1 Moaned to her love PisidicS. Ere dawn the Argives' clarion call Rang down Methymna's burning street ; The/ slew the sleeping warriors ail,- They drove the women to tha fleet, Save one, that to Aohilles' feet Clung, bnt, in sudden wrath, cried he J " For her no doom but death is meet." And there men stoned Pisidicfi. In havens of that haunted coast, Amid the myrtles of the shore, The moon sees many a maiden ghost—. Love's outcast new arid evermore. The silence heais the shades deplore Their hour of dear-bought love ; but thee , The waves lull, 'neath thine olives hoar, To dreamless rest. PisidicS.
