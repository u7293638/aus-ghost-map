ENGLISH LITERARY NOTES. fKroin nnr Sneeial Corresnondent.l London, June 17, 1898. The book of the week has been the nnonymoii'j 'Collections and Recollec tions',' by one who has kept a diary (Smith, Elder, & Co.), which is the most entertaining book of reminiscences issued this year. The papers originally appeared in the Manchester 'Guardian, and are generally attributed to Mr. G. \V. E. Rus sell. His collection of anecdotes is inex haustible; his pen and ink portraits of cele brities characteristic: and his extensive literary mc;'u tastefully arranged. Con versation, Repartee, Parliamentary Ora tory, Clergymen, Titles, Princedoms, Vir tues, Powtis, these are the subjects of some of the most attractive chapters. I. have only space for .1 plum or two as a sample of lue literarv banquet. Here are two of 'Dizzy': — 'He called his simple drawing-room the saloon, he styled his pond the lake, he expatiated on the beau tics of the UTraee walks, the 'Golden Gate' and the 'German Forest.' His style of entertaining was more showy than com fortable. '.Nothing could excel the gran deur of his state coach and powdered foot men, but ?-( !:en the ice at dessert came up melting, o-i-; of his friends exclaimed 'At last, my ikar Dizzy, we have got some thing hot,' ?nd m the days when he w.is Chancellor of the Exchequer, some critical jjuest remarked of the sou]) that it was ap parently made with deferred stock. Whr:n Lady Beaonsfield died, he sent for his agent, and said, 'I desire that her lady ship's remains should be borne to the grave by the tenants of the estate.' Presently the agent rame back with a troubled coun tenance, ami said, 'I regret to say there arc not te.iants enough to carry a coffin.' Lord Odo Ji'ussell, our ambassador at Ber lin, was entreated by one of Lord Bea consficld's private secretaries to prevent the chief .i.i.kinu; a long speech in French I at the oivning of the Berlin Congress. [Dizzy had written the speech, and got it by heart, but an he pronounced 'epicier' a.s if it rhi mod with 'overseer' he was m imminent 'Linger oi making himself ridicu lous. Lord (Jdo Russell interviewed Di/-:y in his bedroom, pointed out that to make a French -peeeh was commonplace, and ihnt half-i eiozen men at the Congress I could do it almost, if not quite, as well aa the Prime* ^Minister of Kngiand. But, 0:1 the of her h.'.ml. who but you can make an English spi.ich? All these plcnipoten ti.iri-.'s. have conic from the various courta of Europe- expecting the greatest intellec tual treat of their lives in hearing K112; lisli spoke-i by its greatest living master. The -|ii-':;ii-!i for yon. my dear lord, is, 'Will you cisappoiut them?' Lord Bea cnnslii-hl mil his ;;lass in his eye, fixed his jraze on Lo:d Odo, and then said, 'There is much f'lice in what you say. I will consider i'ic point.' And next day he opened th-- 1 rocccdingh in English.' Vim may not have heard this one of 1 it tie Prim 0 A!i'xaii(k-r of liattonburg before — 'Like many oilier lit'.ie boys, be ran short of pocket-i'ioncy, and wrote an ingenious letter to his august irrandiuother, ask-rig for some slight poeuni.iry assistance. lie received 'n return a just rebuke, tell'njj him th;;v little boys should keep within their limit.-, and th.it he must wait uiii.il his next allowance lxuamp due. Shortly i'flerw.inK i'no undefeated little Prince re sumed 1 h v correspondence in something Jila the f'i Uov.-ing form — 'My dear grand inaiii'iia. I am sure you will be glad to know tliat I need not tr- uble. you for r.'.iy money just now. for I sold your last letter to another boy here for ;'.(K' ' tVow^tl, tiie late master of TiaPiol, in snired tbo two fullowiuj!.--' At dinner :it IJalliol Ihv master's ^iv-'^ were discussing the cate.'i':; of two Baliio! men. the one1 of whom li.nl ;u-t been made, a judge, and the other a bishop. '-ih,' said Henry Smith, '1 think the bishop is the greater man. A judge, at the most, can only say 'Vou lie hanged,' but a li;V':-.-j- ca'i say 'You be d ? d.' 'Yes.' characlerii ti.-ally twitted the ma.-ier. 'but if t!i-- j'ldg* nays 'You be hansu-d, vui are hanged.' For my own part, I in.ist lively admit that 1 do not write as ;,n admirer of Mr. .loMeti. but one saying of his, which I had the advantage of hearing, does much to atone, in my judgment, for the snappish impel tiuences on which his reputation for ^ it has been generally based. The scene was the master'?, own dm ins-room, and 111? moment that the ladies had left the 100m one of tho guests iiegan a most out rageous erir, ersr.lion Every one .'at flabbergasted. The master winced with r.nnoyanee, and then, bending down tha table- towards tlie offender, said in his shrillest if ne, 'Shall we continue this con versation in the drawing-room!' and rose from hift chair. It waf, really a stroke of ccnius thus both to terminate and to re buke the impropriety without violating this decorum due from host to guest.1' Cardinal Wanning, who did not love Car dinal Xt'viMiii, is responsible for this one — 'W lion Newman died there appeared in a monthly magazine a series of very un fliittevin;? sketches by one who had known him well. 1 ventured to ask Cardinal .Manning if he had seen tTiese sketches. He replied that he had, and thought them vary shocking, the writer must have a very unenviable mind, &i;\, tv.d then, having thus sacrificed to propriety, after a mo ment's pause, he added, J-ut if you ask me if they are like poor Newman I am bound to say — a photograph.' ' This story oi the dangers of the road illustrates '.he advance made in our civilisa tion since the times to which we diarisos can look back— 'Another story of highway robbery which excited me when I was a 1-oy was that of the fifth Earl of Berkeley, who died in lblO. He had always declared that any one might, .without disgrace, be overcome by superior numbers, but that he would never surrender to a single high wayman. As he. was crossing Hounsiow Heath one night, on his way from Berkeley Castle to London, his travelling carnage was stopped by a imm on horseback, who put his, head in at the window, and said, I believe you are Lurd Berkeley?' 'I am.' 'I believe you have alunys boasted that you would never surrender to a single highwayman?' 'i have.' 'Well,' present ing a pistol, 'I am a single highwayman, and I say ''Your money or your life.' ' 'Y'ou cowardly dog,' said Lord Berkeley, 'do you think I can't see your confederate skulking behind you?' Tho highwayman, -\ho was. really alone, looked hurriedly round, and Lord Berkeley phot him through the head. 1 asked Ladv Caroline !Maxs;- (1503-1S86) who was borii a Berk eley, it this story was true. I c;aii never forget my thrill when she replied 'Yes, and I am proud to say that I am th:it man's daughter.'' In' the jargon of the Rta;re, the book is all ''fat.' .Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson, and Hodge liiivp been holding a six days' sale of tha ln.iniisoripls and autograph letters of the late .Sir Thomas Phillipps, F.R.S. The most interesting lots were an extensive col lection ??' oiisinal letters and papers of the Fairfax family, in the time of James I. and Charles I., in 0110 volume folio, £28; a collection (at one time in the possession of .lames Boswell, the younger), of 16 long holograph letters of John Dryden to Airs. Rtuart, Elmes Steward, and William Walsh, the poet, 1G98-1700, all full of tha most important information relating to tho stage, his poems, and political matters,' and most of them believed to be entirely un published, Co30; and a large folio volume, comprising the original correspondence ol Oliver Cromwell, Major-General Lambert, Colonel Fairfax, fsir Thomas Fairfax-, John A! orris, Governor --f Pontefract, Francia Hacker the regicide, aud others, during the siogo of ronltfract, 1048-49, upwards of 100 letton; and papers, among which arc no fewer than eight original letters of Cromwell, purchased by Mr. Downing for Sir Richard Tar.gye for £415.

She was brought up on Elizabethan niusTc — and played the virginal. She didn't play it long, lor a wicked, .sensual Bart, came on the scene with a golden moustache, slight hips, and a fur coat. When 01 a very slight acquaintance he proposed to take her to 1'aris as his mistress siie shud dered through her entire flesh, but 'jnly for a moment, for. after a brief vo'up tuous meditation, she struck a beautiful amorovs altitude, and the liaison cir.i meuvid.

Wagner was child's play to her. She learned her parts, when she was sippiiig her chocolate: in her warm bed of a morn ing, a habit to which, we are told, she was much addicted. In London she picked up smother lover, one I lick Dean, a. com jio.-vi1 and musical critic, with long hair, nnd a conversation like a umsiral ilie iionary. She divided her attentions be tween ilie wicked ]!avt. who, by this time wished to many her and become a re fjpectablo member of i-.oeiel y, and the com poser wilh the golden ^Ioav in his eyes. ?She deceived them both, as wyll as her father, w !io, by the way, seemed on her return more' di-(res.-ed because, she could no loKp.01' (li- tiiij.uir-h between A sharp smd ii £et, than because she had 'locked hei^etf into tiic sensual present.''

Mr. I'.crmird Shaw, whose initials '(J.U.S.' no longer appear in the 'Satur- day Review/' has been seriously ill from overwork. He has given up dramatic criticism, and taken unto himself a wife (at the registrar's office), a wealthy Irish lady, J\l iss 1'ayne Townshend, who is a benefactor and trustee of the London School of Economics. Despite the advice of his doctors, 'Ci.H.S.' sticks rigidly to his vegetarianism. Possibly his wife may break him of this habit, and also convince him that chivalry and romance are not the baneful things lie would have us believe. The one and only Marie might with ad vantage take a leaf out of the hook of Ouida, who thus replied to a correspon dent, writing Iipi1 for material out of which to construct a biography of herself:— 'I have not replied to you because I regret to refuse your request, and I cannot comply with it. ' What impertinence and what folly are these so- called biographies of persons who have done nothing to deserve such a punishment. The life of such a man as Hurton or Wellington contains material for history, but that of a man or woman of the world has nothing in it which is not essentially private and per sonal, and wilh which the public and the press' have nothing to do. My works are there for all to read. With my individu ality they have nothing to do. Print this if you like.' Marie's stop- brother, by the way, Eric Mnekay, has just died at the age of 47 from inflammation of the lungs. His 'Letters of a Violinist, '' written out of doors, walking about in the country, was his most important work, but his talent as a versifier was displayed in 'A Lover's Liianic.' 'The Lover's Missal,' ??(iladys, the Singer,' 'A Song of the Sea/' ' '.My Lady of Dreams,'' 'Arrows of Seng,' and 'Nero and Actia.' His f;ii her, 1)\\\ M.-.'-kay, wrote in a very dif ferent style the stiiTin™ n-ings of the ''48 era, 'Cheer, Hi-vs, Cheer,' which Henry ]{i;-.--clI made so popular. Eric Mackay of i.ite had caused much amusement by his advcrl i-eiiL-'iit of the loss at the: Pea side ol' the .-ISS.
