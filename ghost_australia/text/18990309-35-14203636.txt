THE TWO CARDINALS AND PAGAN ENGLAND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD Sir,-In your issue of Monday last a speed of Cardinal Moran's is recorded, which has a splendid leading "Cardinal Moran and b Critics" "the Decay of Anglicanism ' Rapid Expansion of Romanism "-'A Paju England." With such a summary it u oil; natural to expect some reply, endeavouring to pull into numerous inaccuracies, mistakes, and ask lous statements something, at any more, about li) now famous essay on " Windmills," paragraphs cam accuracy in quoting Scripture, something to accord for the over-hunting ghost of Henry VIII At one word do I find on any of these subjects lately some more ' feats in arithmetic " which the Bishop of Goulburn as (if he thinks it worth while more than competent to dispel and expose, us some marvellous assertions The speech is Rookwood commences with a ' Crosio proverb" which your reporter has done well to omit. Then, after a commonplace story, the Cardinal press into his arithmetical performances, and forthwith goes on to quote from an American paper about a reverend gentleman who had quitted one of the various sects in the United States, and had been 0 rcgLstoretl member of the Protestant Episcopal Church " The Cardinal's own quotation corner him, for something more than to become a registered member " is necessary on entrance into ill Protestant Episcopalian Church The Cadman his hurry to obtain a set-off against father bill Hecker, founder of the American Order of Paulus has most unwisely inserted this Thou we have a long quotation from a sermon! a IN New York rector, the gist of which the Cordial entirely loses siLbtm in order to serve his special purpose, viz, to belittle the ProtestantFpuwpil Church in America, which is entirely independent of but in communion with the Church of England so here is a truly catholic hotly, yet Protestant in 11 attitude The Cardinal gives this sermon all the authority of a papal bull, although the American Episcopal Church is no more responsible for it than the Italian mission in England is respon ki for the following letter of Father O'Donnell which is a curious specimen of the perfect 1 eite, unity), and concord that exist in Carinia!

But we, the genuine Roman Catholic dow! believe in any such superstitious nonsense «> believe Cardinals and Popes tobe exactly hit off rulers, who will get a jolly good hearing theatres if they do not govern justly and in accord lantana God's law " " I venture to think that the ultoranccscflhein testant Episcopal rector of St. John the honeyed in New York against iinpriiiutivo teachicfisiiit» United States are hardly as trenchant as those of a Roman Catholic rector of St Joseph and let, Luling, against Roman by rains in England has he (the Cardinal) comes to the question of 'Isis England " , ., On this point I shall content my self with putting the utterances of two Cardinals side by aids So first we take that of the Irish Cirilmal ["of emphasise what he considerate to the horrid condition of England, he says He Thoughtful were more Pagans in London in the present time than were to be found in Tel in 1 J G formed that some among the extreme lions have the insolence to call all who are JP of the Roman commission ' Pngiius AMOK this is correct or not I cannot absolutely own but, if it is so, and Ule Cardinal uses it in this for. his assertion is founded upon a far us the "> of the lilian mission are still in proponenT population of London But we now turn to l 2 utterances of a great English Carnal (same, get at notw ithstauthug tim records of Parcell sun,, In a sermon quoted in the English We Cardinal Manning Bald -" that matter We He did not ask what made it a Christian haITI what made England great It wheat market, nor concert at nor politics nor lcS!«Iatioi l|T honour faith and that our love of a. tiara a neighbour which made a united England .
