TIfie Wiekliam Criiost. Newcastle. â€” A ghost is haunting Wickham township, and is supposed to be the disem bodied spirit of a departed ped., for it puts on a tremendous sprint when pursued, and would be sure to get a leg in for the final if it would enter for the next Botany Handicap. The ghost was flitting about the rear of Butler's Hotel on Saturday night, and a live ped was requested to pursue and collar it. The live ped ran effina fright one way, and the ' dead Jun ' vanished quickly another way. The local police man is now on the warpath la boots warranted to so seven leaeaes at a stride.
