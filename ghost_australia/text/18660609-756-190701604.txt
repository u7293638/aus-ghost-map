lo the Editor of the Avoca Hail. bia,— It was with great satisfaction that Mr Cooke s emphatic denial of having used certain words referring to this place was perused here, and in case it may be attributed to us that among our other offences we can do a wrong we dare not right, I hasten to express to that learned gentleman our thorough conviction that he has been misre ported, the sense of his words misconstrued, and that I and others have been imposed upon. With such a weight of authority ('which it would be a heresy to doubt), as the Bench and the officials in his favor, the evidence that induced us to make a humble remonstrance against being designated the ' scum of the district,' is divested of every claim to belief ; and it is a pleasure to us to find we have not been so stigmatised. I concluded it was one of those not uncommon instances of the most eminent and practical speak ers, in their zeal for the cause, carried away by the fervour of their harangue and impetuosity of speech, using expressions which they afterwards had no recollection of, and when informed been both sur prised and pained: But it turns out to have ' no foundation in fact,' a mere squib from this manufactory of 'legal fireworks' — an illusion of some persons who pro fess to have been in Court all the time, but who, I am more willing to believe had been sacrificing to Bachus, and overtaken by Somnus, had in a delud ing dream been visited by a malicious gnome from the' Hertz Mountains,' or Rome vagabond ghost from the ' Wilds of Bohemia' {vide Avoca Mail 12th May), who murmured in their ears the ob noxious phrases as part of the eloquent advocate's speech. Lamplough has received many a stab before, and when she was led to believe that this new wound was indicted by one who had befriended her in her difficulties, she may be pardoned having exclaimed less with anger than sorrow, ' And thou Brutus?' I am, Sir, Yours obediently, EDMUND MILLMAN. Lamplough, June 4, 18G6.
