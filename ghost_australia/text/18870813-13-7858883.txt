THE MURRAY IN FLOOD. \- as BY TELEVAOHOS. If a patriotic Australian dying should be disposed to pray, he would not, like Goethe, ask for more light, but more water We all want water Seekers after the picturesque, or growers of wheat and mutton, and beef, and wool, have all the one cry, " Vi river, water or, water ' If we had only a great backbone range with snow peaks ยก.'0,000ft ah ft we should have constant rains and noble rivers but that crumbled down old coastal chain of our gives birth to none but puny streams So frequently do we hear people express themselves But they have never seen the Murray in flood What in he lil 0 in seed-time, tin all receiver rather than all father of Australian waters To answer this question I set out for Echuca three days ago and dreamed fitfully of floods and waters from the time the train drew out of the rain and fog of Melbourne and rumbled along on the seven hours journey until the animals were made right for us into 1 cause, there is not much water on the way , far more 13 seen on the North Eastern line. Y waterholes are all full, and the Coliban and Malmsbury) wind away through the hills a smooth and shilling lake SomecrpekBoreupn bit. others have left traces of high waters but Echuca is sound as of old, Scattered over a most in consciously area of country high and drying parently, uni dull enough to welcome even a flood as a pleasant little item of change The flood may make a change by and by The flood is still coming The present edge of the flood waters is reached suddenly in a somewhat muddy) stream, creeping along by a grassy bank Gum trees are seen beyond, standing well out of the water, feathery tops of scrub foliage next, then a broad BWUt stream, a body of water tearing along with majestic force You feel its vastness and strength as you look at it, you know that it is deep there is something in its motion which specks of irresistible power It is the great Murray even here Far away through the trees the noble bridge is seen, with water flowing beneath all its spans From the parapet of the bridge there is a good view of the flood waters immediately about the town, and it is rather a dismal view, however silvered over by the plea Bant light of a genial afternoon Up the river are the sawmills and the cottages occupied by the labourers, all swamped, or half submerged, or float now, a steady current flowing over the garden fences, or rippling around angles, porches, or chimney ends, A good deal of machinery suffering waste and damage ; the homes of a hundred people ruined There must be a little pathos about such a scene as that, but it lacks all the excitement of the roaring floods of other colonies. It is not the way the Murrumbidgee came down, when 62 dead bodies were swept out of the old town of Gundagai in one wild night. Nor is it as the Hawkesbury, when she rises in haste, when people wake up in the night, and had the Hood tearing through their doors, and get out on the ridge cap of the roof for safety, and wait for the boats Nor does it resemble in the least The well or bore like rise of New Zealand rivers It seems, a deed, impossible to get any excitement out of it at all There is no hurry, no danger Everybody shifts leisurely, and has lots of time for cursing at bad luck How high will it rise! On that point there is such a conflict of opinion as to leave a blank of absolute uncertainty. 'There are a thousand surmises about, any one of which seems just as likely as another It depends on the Campaspe or the Goal him, or whether the Albury water is down or the snow water w iii come It depends, in fact, on possible combinations of at least a half dozen different sets of circumstances, about which there are innumerable guesses but no know ledge there ought to be knowledge, there should be judgment, and accurate foreshadowing and warning of effects that might clearly before seen Going to be a blow, is there' Well, let it blow What are ships made for it not to stand a blow' but it is a different matter altogether with the rivers Houses are not built or crops sown to stand goods, and stock cannot exist on water and dead wood when once the Hood covers their pastures Knowledge of a coming flood is indeed giving knowledge, and might and should be supplied 'There would be no difficulty about it if available facts were placed in competent hands Given the daily condition of all the rivers running into the Murray and the rainfall on their watershed, with a fair notion of the country adjacent to the river banks and experience of one big woodland the hydrographer general of the colony should be able to issue his daily bulletins stating exactly, not what the river might, but what it would do It would be difficult to over estimate the value of such knowledge as this The squatter would know exactly how to deal with his stock on the. frontage. The drover 100 or 400 miles back could make to a telegraph station and learn what route and what crossing place he must choose The farmer could not remove his growing crops, but In could have all his stock securely placed, and if necessary shift his Blacks and chattels and secure his house His house and stacks have no business what ever within reach of floods. W a know that of course, and will have something to say about it by and by Accurate and well published information of another sort might enable the farmer to keep out of danger altogether, but information in this way but tetly lacking The country is profoundly ignorant of the cause, nature, and effect of floods, and suffers accordingly The notions ruling in 1 church now are that it may be a big flood It has six feet yet to race before reaching the level of 1873, and the possibility of that rise seems to depend on continuance of tolerably wet weather all along the lower feeders of the river until the snow melts on the mountains If the present Hood gets away before the snow water comes all will be well, if not, there will be carpets of water in many Echuca dwellings, and some boating on the streets "But do you want to see the water?' was. "Come out with us to Barmah then, and we will show more than would like your (qualified) old bay down below We shall state early too, and did you ever swim a horse 2 5 The court had been sitting at Echuca, and a score of fellows wire us from various Hooded countries and were proposing to get out again when the flood of liquor within then should have abated somewhat. And na morning secured the most likely time to keep them in a suitable condition, early morning was the time named It was fairly early morning when I awoke in an upper chamber of the old Bridge Inn Poor old inn, how its glories have departed 1 Twelve years ago one muslin get breakfast at Scotts Hotel and dinner at the Bridge, and be scarcely conscious of any change of service Now business Ima gone elsewhere the town has grown away from the Bridge, and the old house is like Martin Luther's account of the world before the creation-a I ii. the end feet sort of plea It had fallen into hands of a Swedish baron, who lives and reigns there alone, condescending at times to diRt nor a drink or a meal, and treating a guest whom he favours with more than ordinary courtesy It is a quaint experience to sit a solitary Buist in a diningroom 16ft long, and hear the noble boat decision, in a courtly sort of broken English, against the democratic tendencies of the age, and the show bunkers who has no respects nor peoples of property" And it was exceedingly Pleasant to be awakened at early morning by a small, sweet, familiar sound. It was the tinkle of a bell bird in a great gum but a stones throw from the window "Git up," said the bell bird, " got up I get up! get up! ' The little fellow know that everybody ought to be up by that time for he had seldom sounded his matins to such a lovely day birth But it was not very early morning, for all the gold and fire had steal out of the sunrise, and there seemed nothing abroad but silver flicker, spimHes, and mist. Spangles on every leaf of every tree, silver tucker or shimmer over all the waters, which seemed a mile broad, and white or pale grey mist far away up the timbered vista of the war It was a beautiful morning; the faintest touch of frost had escaped the air, but the sun was already warm, and there was a delightful odour abroad of the mingled odours of burning Australian pine and inner merable cherry and pencil and almond blossoms the gardens and the volume of fresh mountain waters rolling down the river and over the flats Through it, too, soon came the smell of sausages and steak and onions and other constituents of the morning meal, which do so much to spoil the glory and increase the comfort of the day the men who were in a hurry to go out through the water were already up lhi y appeared to have been up some time, and the liquor had got into them and the fire) out. They were all for telling, tales about floods, and not one of them for going out nine ngst them at least, not yet "What's the hurry' Well have another drink and some breakfast Don't you be afraid, well put "on through You can swim ? Never let a horse a cars get wet when you put him in the water If his cars get wet it euchre with him That the and Jim Brown went down Did you know Jim Brown? Where the-so and so have you been not to know Jim' Jim was 10 miles down the river and wanted to go across to a dance, and a black fi How had got a horse, and would t lend him to swim over, but Jim went to a paling fence and broke off a waddy, and when the black fellow saw the waddy he came down, and then tied the concertina on the top of his head, and got on and put him at the river, and down he went ears and all, shook his head when he came up and rolled right over Jim gets (qualified) held on the side of the head, and we had to make the blackfellow dive for him The concertina was fast on top of his head when we got him out It is a peculiar thing that far out in the Australian bush there is seldom any expression of sorrow about a bushman s death Men will risk their lives freely enough for each other, but when one is killed there is an end of the matter and no lamentation If they are sympathetic about anything, they do not permit their speech to betray them A man here has brought a little child down sick almost unto death The doctor has been in, and they come out together "How's the kid? esks a friend, "Very bad' "What is it-euchre with him There is evidently time enough for breakfast and another stroll by the river The saddest man now seems one who has a cottage on a gently sloping bank The garden lies down to the river, and the river is coming up to the garden and spreading over row after row of cabbages, and the poor man looks out from the back window, and watches the destruction of his small property with a rueful countenance The heartiest looking men are the groups about the wharves and on board the steamers. A score of steamers with their barges are lying by the wharves and along the banks, nil preparing to start for the upper waters of the Murray, Murrumbidgee, or Darling and bring down the great clip More bales have gone out of Echuca than many previous year, and in a couple of months they will be coming back here Dated, piled high on the lines and the steamers picked up by the stout and serviceable hydraulic cranes which project over the wharves swung right across to the trucks on the railway siding at the shed, and sent down by long train after train to fill the stores of Melbourne and the ships of the world One recognises the good services of the flood when glancing over these preparations The great river with its influenza have become highways for the staple industry of Australia T There is no hurry amongst these good men who want to get back, even when 12 o'clock arrives but a vast deal more talk about BWimrmng and drowning and, if there is really any danger, some considerable pro- babilities 61 the latter event. Happily, however, there in a good gentleman with a stout buggy and an honest god fearing like brute yoked thereto who proposes to go quietly round by the water and reach the Barmah punt by evening, and wtttvoutany special risk or trouble It is Mr Moloney, shire councillor storekeeper, and successful farmer, who is growing slowly, surely and laboriously into competence and substance, who will by and by become a power in his district and if men learn that quiet needs no better than loud words, may by and by aspire to a place in Parliament We drive out of town together, cross the bridge and take another look at the still rising flood, pass through the town of Moama, which stands on the higher bank, and has a much fairer and better situation than Echuca , looked curiously at the deserted hotel of the old town, built like an old manor house, with columned portico and lofty ceilings and broad corridors, all empty now, given over to the wild cats and peas sums and ghosts. We will not stop to talk about the ghosts of the old house now-If they were once raised we should never reach the floods There are for a couple of miles no sign of floods but then suddenly a turn is made in the track, and the dry cleared road is lost in what appears to be a still river at least four miles in length We have to drive through it. It is not a serious matter, not more than knee deep, with a bit of a hole occasionally , but when about a mile of this has been plodded through the surroundings are remarkable The water is running slowly through the trees, a steady current bearing all floating things inland There is no sign of grass or herbage anywhere visible, only dead logs and stumps and grey) box timber, and sombre foliage The magpies By about or whistle emily, the crow coasts with his usual inferred mr of contentment -nil misfortune feeds him, and ducks by scores and hundreds swoop down through the trees, and alight and swim ahead of us on our river road Now, if we look a little and think a little we can realise that there was a little truth in our bush friends assertion that there was water enough about to fill Hobsons Day There is probably a vaster sheet of surface water here than the whole of Port Phillip About the Murray and (Goulburn it is at least a hundred miles in length by four and twenty in breadth, and it is still going back, every inch of rise making miles of extension And what is it doing' Over the great bulk of the area it is perform at, the muLuiliceut work of irrigation Mil lions of acres of grass land will receive such a thorough soaking us to make good feed sure for years to come It is repairing in its own way all the havoc wrought by years of drought. Looking ahead on the track or water wa)s we see shortly Some peculiar processes of absorption going on There is a splashing or bubbling on the winter ahead It looks likcabird drownuigorn platypus rolling over. When closely approached it is found to be air bubbles sent up by the water making its way into some old Bun crack or other matter ranean reservoir There are half a dozen of them about, bubbling away vigorously It is impossible to say how long they have been Luhrig but 24 hours later they are still busy), and must in that time his e passed down many a thousand gallons. the weary, dreary waste of water is broken by a sand hill, one of those provisions which nature seems to have provided for all the vicissitudes of the Australian climate. Plenty of line dry camping ground, there, for all the blacks and emus and kangaroos of the old days The surface for a couple of miles is a broad plateau.hghtly and beautifully timbered The oaks and box trees grow together-and always in graceful curves sweeping in and out about little plains of green There is shelter in and about them, no matter how the wind blows, and always that beauty of form which is a characteristic of the broad and open but not burn Australian landscape They are a portion of the great Moira estate, those plains, they wore the coveted and fiercely contested possession out of which grew the great Joachim 0 Shanaasy case Most of them have been secured for the estate now, and both the pi impala have passed away It is some years since mass was sung for the soul's repose of Sir John, and almost a forgotten alor) how Joachim a dead body was picked up a hundred yards across there by the red stock track, trodden to a hard corrugated Budnee by the hoofs of thousands of cattle who went by after the rain of last week. Past this Moira plateau we turn, and make right down for the river, descending again to the Hut and starting a billabong, on whose banks scores of great red gums have been killed and dragged or rattled away to the mills on the river But above the stumps of these old game, and right at the foot of the sand hill, which has been narrowed to a ridge, is a skirt or coppice of saplings, true redgums each one, averaging from one to four inches in thickness, and from 10 to 20 feet in height ' These were planted here by the flood of "> " says my companion There seems a something in that sentiment (which may be taken as perfectly ne curate, coming from a reliable man who was speaking of the things he had him self seen) which should set philosophers n thinking The flood of '7J carried up the seeds dropped down below, and planted them where redgums had never grown before How is this to be accounted for War the Hood of 75 the highest of two or three centuries, and will it be repented this year There are many strange possibilities and con ingenuous involved here which may be studied out at leisure Vic- leave the sapling belt, and turn right up the sand ridge over a smooth and velvety turf, where a few bright buttercups and pale orchid, like blooms tell of the brightening sunshine The summit of the sand hill is 10ft at least above all the immediately surrounding country It overlooks the timbered flats, and miles and miles away the dull green crown of the forest is seen, with water up paling through every break We cross the ridge and descend once more We are near the river, we are near " he " here is a cleared land ahead, another river road, the sight at which breeds a gruesome sort of look on the driver s face I don't like it he says, ' there are a lot of crabholes in that lane, running from But, to lOIt deep If we were to get into one it would be awkward " It would be uncommonly awkward What shall we do ' We look at the water and at the holes at either end They are spread over the whole width of the lane They continue right through beneath the water. We may miss them, we must risk it, but we will pull off our coats and boots as a measure of caution, and then proceed Lots of people may talk of their experiences when, for the first time, under fire I don't believe it is worse than sitting in a buggy with your heels on the splashboard and the water running through the bed, and due probability of the horse going down, cars and nil at every stop A man who can whistle as he goes through that would be just as likely to chase bullets for butterflies as not We did not whistle, either of us, but we had luck to get through And then he hold another sea just a half mile ahead, with many crabholes and no perceptible track What hope of a safe course through this' The only hope and only chance was in a newly blitzed gum tree less there was another a chain ahead, and another, and another, round a semicircle of a half mile The blackfellow had been sent out to blaze the track, and he had done it successfully Ask a white man to turn out on a frosty morning, and wade up to his middle in water, and do that sort of work, and what would he said' This poor black had done it faithfully and well, Ina only reward being a drop of rum and the broken meats of the little hostel stable Poor told blackfellow ! In your low and poor and degraded condition you are a better man, ten to one, than the ordinary mean white who leads around the country with his swag If they would only keep you out of the was of men, and of Matthews, Gribble, and Co, you would be one of the most useful creatures in the bush still I can hear you gabbling and babbling, and inclined to be quarrelsome, round your three stick fire out at the house end, and old Kitty is keeping and crossing womanlike and peace wise, and old Teddy ia coughing Ins dunes away, for "big fellow cold " has sat down there this time If you had only had a little fair play, a little kindness and consideration, you would have been a good servant still They have sadly abused ) you, and your lot is very hard now. It is cold out there The stars seem almost freezing in a cloudless sky, and you can hardly find sticks enough to keep you warm, the water has SO covered over) thing But there is lots of hard life in the bush - things that tolga never dream about in town There is another bit of more a hundred yards a way. It is chance if the water does not creep on to it before morning. A man and a woman are sitting on "tucker boxes beside it, and the woman has a baby in her arms. They have a covered cart and a horse. They have only made five miles in the day's travelling, been stuck twice in creeks, and had to get out in water 3ft deep The man is going out to look for a job of work, Shearing or wool pressing, his wife and child accompanying the spring cart being their only place of habitation Is their condition much more to be desired than that of the blacks ? Well, yes, for they seem content and not quarrelsome (Kitty's keeping very shrill now, and Charcoal's swearing somebody will he knocked over with a waddy before many minutes). Happily, there comes a cool so now from the other side of the river Charcoal will have to go down to the punt And, by and by the great Hut rate swings over on the current and back again, and the adventurous gentlemen we parted with in the morning arrive They have found the holes They have been into them horses and all, ears and all Perhaps it is unnecessary, perhaps impossible with any degree of accuracy or perspicuity, to report further A river lad, thoroughly wet in sale and out, mixes his speech so free) with various tabooed expressions that an attempt to render all expurgated edition would 1 only result in the priming of senseless jargon They subside in sleep at length, the blacks also, the shearers fire goes out, and his tent covered cart gleams ghostly by the intensely black scrub The might) whisper of the waters is heard in the trees close by. They are not more than 18in be neath mc, less than a hundred yards away through the darkness overhead wild ducks, wings cut up d and frequent, and shrill toe mopoke calls, the 'possums chatter, and there are sounds of cattle moving restlessly, as if conscious of and vaguely dreading the rising waters It is hardly a night for Sleep, jet sleep is absolutely necessary), tor on the morrow I am pledged to a somewhat adven tedious journey down the river to an election meeting. A shire councillor is to be chosen, and all the men of the district who can come will come swimming over the creeks, paddling up in canoes, making round by any accessible track They will have all the story of the floods over a broad area of country of the loss, and the spoil, and thomas) strangoadventuresof The floods I must interview a score and listen to a hundred of them, and contrive to weave all the threads they spin into a narrative of the floods as they are to the men who live amongst them
