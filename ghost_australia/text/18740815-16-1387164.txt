Prudence Palfrey. BY THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH. CHAPTER I. IN WHICH PARSON WIBIRD HAWKINS RETIRES FROM BUSINESS. PARSON WIBIRD HAWKINS was in trouble. The trouble was not of a pecuniary nature, for the good man had not only laid up treasures in heaven, but had kept a temporal eye on the fluctuations of real estate in Rivermouth, and was the owner of three or four of the nicest houses in Hollyhock Row. Nor was his trouble of a domestic nature, whatever it once might have been, for Mrs. Wibird Hawkins was dead this quarter of a century. Nor was it of the kind that sometimes befalls too susceptible shepherds, for the parson had reached an age when the prettiest of his flock might have frisked about him without stirring a pulse. His troublo wits the trouble of all men who, having played their parts nearly if not quito to the end, persist in remaining on the stage to tho exclusion of moro fiery young actors who have their pieces to speak and their graces to show oil'. These haples3 old men do not perceive that tho scene has changed meanwhile, that twenty or thirty or forty years are supposed to have elapsed ; it never occurs to them that they are not the most presentable poets, lunatics and lovers, until the audience rises up cn music, and hoots them, gray hairs, and id!, from the foot- lights. Parson YVibird Hawkins had been prattling iunocentlj' to half-averted eura for many a summer and winter. Tho parish, as ti parish, had become tired of old man Hawkins. After fifty years he had begun to pall on them. For fifty years he had christened them and married them and buried them, and held out to them the slightest possible hopes of salvation, in accordance with their own grim theology ; and now tiley wanted to get rid of bim, and he never once suspected it,-never suspected it, until that day when the churchwardens waited upon him in his ' study in the cobvvebbed old parsonage, and suggested the expediency of his retirement from active parochial duties. Even then he did not take in the full import of the deacons' communi- cation. Hetire from the Lord's vineyard just when his experience was ripeît and his heart fullest of his Master's work,-surely they did not mean that I Here he was in his prime, as it were ; only 79 last Thanksgiving. He had come nmong them a young man fresh from the University on the Chnrles, ho had given them the enthusiasm of his youth and the wisdom of his maturo manhood, and he would, God willing, continue to labor with them to the end. He would die in harness. It was his prayer that when the Spirit of the Lord came to take lum away, it might find bim preaching His word from the pulpit of the Old Brick Church, « He-publWieJ from Tkt Atlantic iloatlity.

But Salome Finder understood it. " The parson, you see," said Salome, " is gittin' a leetle near in his old ago. He 'pears to get nearer an' nearer ev'ry year. AVhon Miss Hawkins was alive, why bless you I there wasn't nothin' too handsum nor expciia/ie for her, an' I won't say silo was over an' above grateful, for she wasn't ; but she's dead, tho poor creetur, an' the best of us lack moi-o'n wings to bo angus. The day after the funeral the parson bays, ' S'loino,' says he, ' we'll move into the cottage, it's quite good enough for mo.' ' Nothin's too good for you, Parson AVibird,' says I. ' But he didn't feel content in the great house, 'an it was sort o' lonely ; so move wo did, to tho dis app'intineiit of some,-I don't mention no names,-who thought that mobbe tho parson would invite'em up to Pleasaut-btreetpermauent. P'rhaps the AVidder Mugridge was the most dis npp'iuted. But, Lord love you, the parson ain't one of them that is always ruiniin' after wirainin folks. He's ben married oncet." That was very true, and that Parson Hawkins' matrimonal venturo was not altogether of an encouraging complexion bcems likely ; for he de- clined to repeat the experiment. For several years after the translation of Mr». Hawkins, the parish supposed ho would take another help- meet, and, in fact, moro than one seductivo cap had been sedately sot for him ¡ but the parson had shown himself strangely obtuse. He was not an old man at that time, but he loved quiet, and perhaps his life had not been too tranquil under Mrs. Hawkins' régime. Besides, as Salome b.aid, the parson was becoming a little near, not in a general way, but in his personal expenses. The poor knew- how broad and practical his charity vvos. His closeness manifested itself only in mattera pertaining to his own comfort. He seemed to regard liitnself as an unworthy and designing person, who was obtaining food and clothes under falsa pretences from _ Parson Hawkins. These economical tendencies had flowered out occasionally in his wife's time, but had been promptly taken up by the roots.

Salome rosa hastily from the chair, and reached tho street-door just as some one Btepped upon tho porch. It was a ghi of nineteen or twenty, but look- ing younger with her hair blown about her brows by the fresh May wind. She held in one hand a chip-straw hat which had slipped from its place, aud with the other was pushing back an enviable moss of brown hair, fallowing a serious, pale face, a little flushed at the cheeks with walking. It was a fuco which, passing it heedlessly in the street, you would be likely to retain in your memory unconsciously. The wide gray eyes, capable of great tenderness and great haughtiness, would come back to you vividly, maybe, years afterwards. The girl was not a beauty in the ordinary sonso, but Bhe had what some one has described as a haunt- ing face.
