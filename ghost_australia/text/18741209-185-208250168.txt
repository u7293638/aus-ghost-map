FREE-TRADE AND PROTECTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE STAR. -Yours, &c.;, THE GHOST OF MY FORMER SELF, FREE-TRADE SIR,—A friend of mine tells me that ten years ago he went to Sydney; on leaving Sandridge the pier was so crowded that ships had to anchor down channel and wait their turn for a berth. On arriving at Syd- ney, he ifoiind jthe„’ Wharves ‘comparatively empty, a few coal barges and steamers comprised »the shipping in port at that time. He again took the same. trip, a few weeks ago. On leaving Slindridge lie saw several vacant berths .at the pier, biit'.Toh- arriving at Sydney, he was surprised to find that the wharves had hot only been extended, hut that every berth was full. Now, as’New South‘Wales ; enjoyed the blessings of protection at the period .<ifir6b';'me'ntioned, whilst Victoria was given up to that .curse of the working man—free-trade,, I anr ktfa'.loss to account for the change indicated by .my ‘ friend.''' ,I ; shpuld be. glad, therefore, if you would enlighten- me.
