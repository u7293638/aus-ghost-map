In a little while more he £tU* over on hu back, violently working his legs and an ten rue. A few more struggles and trembling* and the fight is over, when the red marches off, victoriously, pushing his gigantic fallen foe before bira till he enter« in triumph the gates of bis own habitation. Often., hoverer, it happens that the dead Goliath is too heavy for the pony David to carry off. Not to be disappointed of his booty, be calls to his assistance a brother red. They proceed, in the most business-like manner, to bite off tho head, and anatomise the body of the white, till it is divided into portions easy of conveyance, when each walks off with a piece. We should have mentioned that the first red who discovers the prize h asl ens back to the rest, publishes his tidía¡*a, and presently comes forth again the leader of a myriad, and it is the ex- ploits of any individual of the myriad that we have been dcacribin«r. ~ Hie reds «vre, however,, sometí ines de- feated, for, if by accident, when they come near a white, they happen to be athwart bis nose, the white brings down bia pair of shears and nipa the red. across the loins. In such a case there is no hope for the red. After a decent amount of struggling (he red allows him- self to be cut in two, and give up_thc ghost, permitting the victor to make a show of the disjecia membra. It is, how- ever, quite touching to see the evident fear of the whites during the attack. If out of their hole, they run from fide to. side in the utmost trepidation. Foes are on every hand, and they know it. Usually, however, at the first al tr in they rash to their holes. The Hector and Achilles of their number station themselves at the entrance, with stretchedout necks bearing at their ex- tremities bayonet- looking pincera and bristling antennae. With nothing but bayonets and bristles "" outside of the opening, they wait for the foe. Pre- sently wheo a red appears, the neck is suddenly outstretched still more, and the rattling of the bayonets among the legs of the red bid him decamp. If, un- fortunately, the head sh vuld bo outside, not all the bravery of the white Achilles can save him. But we have never seen a narrow well-defended hole captured by a red forlorn hope. We hare omitted many interesting detail* for want of apace, or we could hare told of the self evident elation of the reds, of their different modes of warfare, of the en- gineering skill of the whites and their untiring perseverance. One thing ts certain, viz., that to the red ants we are more or lesa indebted for our compara- tive freedom from their white brethren. If we could send a few red Queens to St. Helena we should provide no slight assistance for the destruction of the ant plague. -
