NEWCASTLE. ? THE REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF COAL Our Newcastle correspondent writes under date 2nd instant " Considerable excitement was caused by a report that one of (ho conlpropnetois or companies had broken their agreement, and, consequently, the price of coal would likely be reduced to 7s 6d I refrained from giving any particulars at the time, as it was difficult to arrive at the correctness of the rumours, and many trusted with myself that the report pits only premature I regret to say, however, that it has turned out to be a fact On Monday, the Lambton colliery reduced the price of coal to 9s , all the other mines, with the exception of Waratah, which maintained On reduced to 8s 9d Yesterday, Tuesday, the price was again reduced ; the Lambton to 8s 9d and the other mines to i 8s 6d metal still at 9s Should the Lambton Co a further reduce the other companies threaten to reduce 3d under them I need hardly say many and various are thermionic as to the cause of this unexpected production, and at present it is very difficult to arrive at the correct cause the managers of the various coal companies proceeded to Sydney on Friday night last, and a meeting was held in Sydney on Saturday, but no satisfactory result was arrived it Several charges were said to be made by one or e (her of the representatives of the coal companies I believe the principal grievance is the Lambton Company not long since monopolised the greater portion of the coal to me, after a while this gradually fell off so much so that instead of working six days in the week They only worked three, and frequently less, at the same time it must be borne in mind they did not charter vessels on their own account, which some, if not all the other companies did the fact of some of the coal companies chartering vessels and sending their own coal into the market had a very injin mils effect on the Lambton Company, and on those parties who purchased coals here on their own account, inasmuch as it is said the coals were placed in the Melbourne market, and sold as low as 7s 6d it n over stated His v were sold sometimes at a lower rate, on this becoming more general]) known, several keen Melbourne merchants were not slow to take advantage of this state of things hence the present result On the other hand it is said the Waratah Company were not bound by the agreement, hence they could sell at what price they pleased, this also injured the trade of the Lambton Company who, in self defence, have, it appears, taken an independent stand At present it would be difficult to throw the blame on any one of muscular company , the Lambton have as yet come in for their full share, but it is a question if they are so much in fault Time will tell the miners employed by the Lambton Company is showing signs of discontent Yesterday about 150 men came out of the pits and waited on Mr Croudace, the manager The grievance was said to be the wanted the standard of eight taken off After some clever sation Mr Croudace promised to refer the matter to Sydney, and the men returned to work A CASE OF MIGTVHEN IDENTItY. An extraordinary case of mistaken identity has come to our knowledge (says the Argus) About two months ago, a lunii-vurfound dead or dying in the verandah of a house in Hotham At the inquest subsequently held upon the body, a number of persons testified to its being that of a man named Collard, some of the witnesses stating that they had known the deceased for a considerable period A word ct of death from sanguineous apoplexy was returned, and the friends of the deceased in England were written to, informing them of the event 'is the day before by yesterday, the man Collard appeared in Hotham alive, and in his usual health, after some months sojourn in the country. The terror of the female members of the household where he presented himself was extreme, until he had satisfied them he was real flesh and blood, and not a ghost This seems to have been one of those curious instances of personal resemblance that care sometimes read about in novels or seen upon the stage, but which are generally regarded as existing only in the imaginations of a fertile story writers, or ingenious dramatists The case w as reported to the police yesterday, as it is of some importance for the genuine Colhud to establish, his identity, inasmuch as he has been in the receipt of an annuity, which of course I will have been discontinued on the news of his supposed death Burning AND WoMBATs In the neighbourhood of Ce late and the Warrion Hills (writes the Geelong Adve> them the engrossing topic of conversation and considers them in exterminating the wild rabbits. Dr Stodart, who has just returned from his Station, has furnished us with the following particulars of his experience -A paddock of 300 acres contains 730 wombat holes, these he has had stopped with stone, one-fifth of the rabbits have broken out again, and at the mouth of each escape Me they have made a rabbit farm is placed, seven dozen being required, and a man iscmrjoyod in attending to them, visiting the first night and morning, bringing home the heads The number of animals thus destroyed has been, domestic 20th August, 759 rabbits, 15 kargnioo-rats, 20 bandicoots, Id native cats, and 13 opos urns , making a total of 947 head out of this one paddock alone On 2500 acres of the Corunnun estate, it is estimated that there are 9000 wombat holes, so that our leaders can form some idea of the amount of labour that has to be performed, and the expense incurred in destroying them. One small paddock of 150 acres, Dr Stodart has let by contract to three men. at IF 6d per hole It contains 1780 wombat holes, and as Mono for filling them up was difficult to procure, ho. sug pcEted the use of wood and binder as a substitute, and this has answered better than any (thing jot, OF out of 500 bore., Blom ed, our firm had been reopened, and the rabbits that had worked his way through and did from exhaustion,"
