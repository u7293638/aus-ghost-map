" We have had several contests hPre againsi sectarian assumption against the! cbnferPnce ' of the six bistiops in 1850. The, resolutions of the Clergy's Conference in 1852, in' which was adopted the proposed constitution of a divided Church, the Laity to sit in cbnyhntion humourously balled the littlegd, and thb clergy, to sit in Synod. Tins was too much for the laity to endure; there was; therefore, " an in fluential lay meeting held at the School, Of Arts, in which a petition to the Queen, Lords; and Commons was unanimously adopted; "tliat in any Church, Constitution, or Assembly com/ !posed of the Bishop, Clergy, and. Lay repre- sentatives, - - be -with equal- ' and ! co-ordinate ! - powers, and so - this i petition was numerously- signed, and- then Bishop Broughtonte projeot of a divided house was defeated.. - j Under our present Bishop much discussion: ensued as to the forms of Constitution to be adopted, draft bills were drawn up and aban doned, Committees of both Houses of the Legislative examined witnesses at length.
