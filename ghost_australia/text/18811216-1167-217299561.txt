SELECTED POETRY. ALONE WITH CONSCIENCE. I sat alone with my conscience, la a place where time had ceased; And we talked of my former living In the land where the years increased. And I felt I should have to answer The question put to me, And to face the answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghost of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Were alive with a terrible might; And the vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to race, Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far-away warning Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future, But now was the present time; And I thought of my former thinking Of a judgment day to be ; But sitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a future To this land beyond the grave ; But no one gave me an answer, And no one came to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by; For it was but the thought of my past life Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming And the vision passed away, And I knew the far-away warning Was a warning of yesterday ; And I pray that I may not forget it In this land before the grave, That I may not cry in the future, And no one come to save. And so I have learned a lesson Which I ought to have learned before, And which, though I learned in dreaming, I hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with my conscience, In the place where the years increase, And I try to remember the future, In the land where time will cease ; And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful soe'er it be, That to sit alone with my conscience Will be judgment enough for me.
