SELECT POETRY. POLITICAL PARODY OF THE WOODPECKER. I knew by the smoke of the flambeaux so curled, By the belles and the blue-devils clustering near, That if there were fools to be found in this world, The man that loved folly might feast on it here. For if for the bluest of nonsense you'd ask, At Vassall's it's sure to be found—in a mask. No more on back-benches a dumbie to pine, Here the Whig may his passion for pension disclose; Burdett speak his lungs out; nay, Jack Russell shine; Here Tierney and Jekyll may pun nose to nose; Here the fondest confession that party can ask May breathe from the lips—if it breathes in a mask. Here the radical patriot, the asinine peer. Finds the courage of crowds, for they're all of a trade— The same breadth of conscience, the same length of ear, The same solemn blunder! no more must be said. If the wine of reform turns to lees in the cask. Here you'll have—But my speech must be under a mask. Here Brougham might look civil,—here Denman might pray; Here Lloyd (or his ghost) might look honest awhile; Here Hume might look human—a tiger at play; Here men feel no shudder, though Arbuthnot smile. All's candour and honour—But how! you may ask; 'Tis by pasteboard and whitewash-the spell's in the mask.
