Somewhat ? to her eurprise, it was locked; but she then remembered that Adam would be certain to lock it -when escaping) and that the police would not require it to Teach the drawing-foam in the usual way. However, a pupil of Adam Furness was not to be much put out for want of A key. indeed, ?locks had always been a favorite study of kefs, as is so often the -case witli curious and ingenious minflgj espe cially when they have no Bcifuples about combining practice with, theory. In short, Cynthia was never without a whole apparatus of keys.' The lock turned easily enough ; but the door stuck a little — =Oyjithia did not care to speculate on the nature of the cement^and so, bufisting open, rather suddenly, it blew out her candle. And, at the same tame, ehe seemed to near a nollow cry — or rather moan. . ? ; If anybody was free from ghostly terrors it was Cynthia. She had much too often been a ghost herself to shud der at any seemingly uaaccountable sight ; and I am sure she Would never have allowed a, disembodied spirit to leave her without the knowledge of the stufE of which, its clothes were made, and what it had paid for them. But seeing ib one thing; hearing another. It wants Something more than an ordinary lack of imagination to stand upon a etain of nsorder ki the dark in a haunted House, aM to hear a mpan, and not discover that one has nerves. : Her first instinct was to close the door again quickly, so as to place that at any rate between herself aad what ever there might be beyond* The room was now absolutely with out liny ISght Whatever, not -evefc. so much as might find Its way from 1i.e lights of London into a room at I midnight, for 1he boardis that blocked out the windows had not been re moved.
