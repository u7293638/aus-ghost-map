The spread of the doctrine was seriously checked by the incursions of the Saxons, who drove back the Christian Britons to the south west of England, Wales, and Scotland, and planted their customs and introduced their gods and beliefs into the land Britain tlton became England, and so great was the impression made upon the people by the Saxon power that the names of their gods were even given to the days of the week, and have remained ever since Christianity waned until the heart of Gregory the Great was touched at the sight of some English children carried captive to Borne "Who are they' he asked and when told that they were Ancle", said not Angles, but angels ' Touched at their appearance, he urged upon his for ovv teachers the necessity of missions being sent to England, and ultimately St Augustine landed and re opened the spread of Christian doctrine through the country Starting in Kent he won over the inhabitants, and founded the Archbishop of Canterbury, which had much remained the head centre of the Anglican Church From Iona good work was still being done, and St Aignan, one of the greatest missionaries from the school penetrated far into England, and awakened the people to the religion of Christ the doctrine taught them was what was taught to day, and he had no doubt but that if the men of to (1 vy could hear those preachers of old and understand the lan'-iuM'e that they spot of they would find that the teachings were the teachings of their own church There were perhaps some superstitions for which the teachers were not responsible and some differences in the community, but both had now been eradicated, and the Church to day stood forth bound together in one community Before St Aignan had gone forth amongst the heathen of the land, another In other had left home, but he returned and spoke dejectedly of the prospect St Aignon re backed him for not gently influencing the ,)««oplo and gradually loading them up to Christ, and then went forth himself By his love, his sy industry, and his gentleness, he awakened the knowledge of God in their hearts and so triumphed where the othorhad failed It was in that aspect of gentle love and humility that they would do best to remember St Aignan at the present j unction, and remember his mode of or rations during the ensuing week when they would be met together in Congress lot sympathy be amongst them in all their deliberations and a forgetful s of imperfection in others, and they would be able to accomplish much great and good work Let all that was said be marked by a spirit of consideration and love as well as by the bro of fervour, and let it be said with the determination of loyalty to the Church and nothing would be done in vain At the evening service the Bishop of New castle (Dr Stanton) preached from Acts xv , 28, " For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us,' and spoke of the union of the spiritual with the eternal the earthly with the heavenly, and how the Holy Spirit used human agencies for carrying forward his divine world
