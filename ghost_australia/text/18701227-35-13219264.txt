HEALTH OF SYDNEY. THE following is the Register-General's Report on the Vital Statistics of Sydney and Suburbs, for the Month of November, 1870. The births recorded in Sydney during November numbered 220, viz., 108 males and 112 females, being 28 above the quin- quennial average, and 59 in excess of the deaths of the month. The deaths numbered161, viz , 92 males and 69 females, being 31 above the average of the preceding five years. The highest rate was attributed to diseases of the local class, viz., 36. 65 per cent., the various orders of the class giving the following results :— Nervous system, 19 ; organs of circulation (heart disease) 10 ; respiratory system, 15 ; digestive organs, 12 ; urinary organs, 3. The proportion of zymotic diseases was 28.57 per cent to total deaths, the majority being of a miasmatic character, the prevalent causes of which were diarrhœa and typhus fever. Two deaths resulted from accidental violence, viz, 1 from fractures and contusions, and 1 from poison The infantile mortality was at the rate of 540 65 per cent and 2.06 percent, above the average of the month of November in the previous five years Comparison from 1865 to 1870 is afforded by the following table - Under 5 years.

An An s is 1'AIUS-The Pall Mall tja elie pub- lishes i letter horn its Paris correspontlcnt, lcceivcel bv balloon mail, nnd dated Tueseluy last, lie says "The people are much dissatisfied with the conduct of the butchers, who, objecting to the price fixed by the Government, have in many instances closed their shops. It will soon become dangerous to trifle with the public in matters of food. A story is told of a grocer having demanded 50 cents for a red herring , the purchaser cried out against this extortion, and down came the National Guards on the grocer (who also belonged to the force), his shop was closed, and the herring or crops du déli, was nailed to the shutters amid public applause. It was next to impossible to procure meat this morning, but, as the saying was during the first revolution, it is dangerous to play with a hungry national tiger. Another sample of Imperial correspondence has been published, from which it is made clear beyond doubt that most of the announcements made by the Count of Palikao were wittingly false ; that Baron Jerome David, the Arcadian lender, was in the pay of the Em- peror ; and that M. Rouher wrote Marshal M'Mahon's proclamations. Great exasperation is felt against King William and his henchman, and a paper called the Combât, edited by Felix Pyat, has opened a subscription for a fusil d' honneur (?), to be given to the man who shall shoot the pious monarch. A letter in Figaro talks about an American company which is to be raised, if Government will find sufficient capital, for the purpose of bringing in Count Otto Bismark either dead or alive ; if captured alive, the company to have the privilege of exhibiting the Count in a cage. The capital continues to enjoy the most profound tranquillity, and a deputation of British correspondents waited on M. Jules Favre to ask for some special facilities for making known the creditable attitude of the capital, the order which reigns, and the determination of parties to hush their animosities until after the departure of the Prussians. The Minister was courteous, and promised to consider the matter. At present we can only write the shortest of notes on the thinnest of paper, with no certainty of our letters being taken up at all in the balloons which carry despatches. Barricades are being carefully constructed for an inner line of de- fence ; and you may form some idea of the intensity of the martial fever from the fact that tthe chiffonniers, or rag and bone finders, and the bum-bailiffs, are creating special corps. A juvenile corps, 2000 strong, of lads between the ages of 12 and 15, has also been raised ; and, to all appearances, the defence of the capital will be as vigorous as that of the other fortified towns of France." LIGHT WINES.-Although the consumption of light wines has trebled in England since the reduction of the rate of duty, they have not at present taken the position as beverages of daily and general consump- tion that we may confidently anticipate for them in the course of the next few years. That there has not been a more rapid increase is due in some measure to the high prices of that particular description of light wines—viz., those front the district of the Medoc, which, more than any other, is suited to the taste and requirements of this country. Looking at the many millions of gallons of claret produced annually in the distiicts around Bordeaux, it must be admitted that past prices have been somewhat fictitious. Thus, although the vintage of 1868 was as abundant and similar in quality to that of 1864 and 1865, the prices of that year were higher than were ever before known in the Medoc. Fortunately, however, the year 1869 has also produced an abundant and equally fine vintage, and this has caused a great change ; the prices for most growths having been less than half that of 1868, and the remaining wines of the 1868 vintage in Bordeaux have been sold at prices little in excess of 1869. Thus, while the ordinary growths of the Medoc have been secured at prices admitting of their being sold as cheaply as the ordinary wines of less favoured districts, the choicest growths of the various chateaux need no longer be regarded as lux- uries beyond our reach. The reports from Bordeaux mention considerable purchases having been made by the films of Gilbey, Cruse, Clossman, Schroder, Southard, Wustemburg, &c.;, and we may presume that a large portion of these are intended for the English market. The fact that good wholesome claret, which when diluted with water forms a beverage equally as cheap as beer, and far more refreshing, can be obtained, through the medium as such agencies as Gilbey's and other houses, of the grocers in almost every town and village, is a great boon, and will no doubt bring about what medical men and other authorities so much desire—viz., a large consumption in this country of light or natural wines. As far as price is concerned, there is no reason why claret should not be consumed here as freely as in Paris, the charges for duty and conveyance being about the same to London as to the French capital. Morning Post. DREADFUL OCCURRENCE AT THE BRISTOL COTTON WORKS. —A frightful affair happened at the Bristol Cotton Works, by which an engine driver, named Samuel Britton, came to a horrible death. The poor fellow, who was only 23 years of age, had been em- ployed at the works only three weeks. It is supposed that about 11 in the morning he must have either be- come drowsy or been overcome by the heat and noise of the ponderous machinery, and falling towards the engine was instantly caught by the flywheel and whirled round with terrific speed, and then crushed between the wheel and the wall, a space of only about six inches, being afterwards heaved upwards with irresistible force; and his mangled remains flung into the spot from whence he had fallen. No cry was heard, and it was only when some persons in the engine room perceived a portion of a garment hanging on the flywheel that they had any idea that an acci- dent had happened. Of course the engine was at once stopped, and, search being made, the form of the unfortunate man was discovered lying across the bearing he had been attending to, frightfully man- gled, and presenting a sickening spectacle. The skull was ground to atoms, and the body was com- pletely disembowelled, the entrails protruding hor- ribly. Literally the poor fellow was crushed to pieces. Death was, of course, instantaneous. The corpse was removed to a room adjoining the factory to await on inquest. The deceased leaves a wife and child ; but the manager of the works, Mr. Long, stated to the coroner that he had received instruc- tions from the managing director of the company to make a suitable provision for the family of the de- ceased. At the inquest, a verdict in accordance with the above facts was returned. ALIVE IN A DEAD-HOUSE.-The San Francisco Alta California gives an account of the experience of a German who was supposed to have died in that city, and whose body was immediately removed and placed in the dead-house attached to the hospital in which he had been under treatment : —" The body was deposited in a case where two other bodies had already been placed, and between them. The cover was put on, and the keeper of the dead-house retired for the night. About midnight a loud screaming and yelling of the most unearthly character was heard in the dead-house. The keeper of the dead-house was sought after, but being aware of what he was required to do, he sought concealment, preferring to let the ghosts fight it out among themselves rather than attempt to become a peacemaker. When at last he was prevailed upon to proceed to the dead-house and open the door, the ghostly form of the German, whose life had been a few hours previously pronounced extinct, and who had been dressed in the robes of the dead, stood before him. The keeper fainted outright, while the terrified German rushed headlong through the long halls and corridors of the building, spreading dismay and terror as he went. Some more courageous than the rest caught and arrested him in his frantic career, but the next instant the poor German fell on the floor in a fit. The physician was sent for and restoratives used, by which he was restored to consciousness. How he felt when he returned to consciousness we give as he told it him- self :-' Vell, ven I got sick and vas in bed that day the doctor came to me and said I vas very sick. He vent away, and after he vent I fell asleep. I knew nothing more till I voke in de night, and there was no light. I put out my hand, and I could get no bed clothes, for I vas cold. I den put my hand to vone side to try for the bed-clothes, and, och, vat you tink I got-vy a dead man ! Dere he vos, cold enough sure. I roared mid all the power I had, and vas going avay by the other side, ven, sure, I put my hand on another. Then I roared, and called, and cried out all I could, and ven I was getting up my head struck a board that was covering me. ' Oh,' said I, ' vot do this mean-vere um I ? Am I dead ? and I roared and bawled, and threw off the cover, and jumped about as if I vas mad. And I knocked at the door vid my hands and feet, but nobody would open it for me, and I thought I vas dead myself. I vos not shure. I had the dead man's dress on me. At last the door opened, and von I looked at the man vat opened it he fell down mid fear, and I ran till I vos caught. Then I fainted, and von I come to my- self I thought it was a dream. But it is as true as I I am here.' " DEMETRIUS.—When Demetrius took Athens by assault, he found the inhabitants in extreme distress for want of coin. He called the principal citizens before him, and announced to them, in a speech full of humanity and conciliation, that he had ordered a large supply of grain to be placed at their free disposal. In the course of speaking, he chanced to commit an error in grammar, on which one of the Athenians immediately corrected him, by pronounc- ing aloud the phrase as it ought to have been given. "For the correction of this one solecism," said he, "I give, besides my former gift, five thousand measures of corn more." THE DAGGER. —In a debate on the Alien Bill in 1792, Mr. Burke inveighed with considerable warmth against the principles of the French revolution, which not only went to overturn all government, but, as Atheism was the first fruits of French liberty, its natural effects would be to de- prive man of all happiness in life, and of all consolation in death. He considered the Alien Bill as calculated to save the country ; for although the number of suspicious aliens in the kingdom at this time might be small, yet is should be remembered that the horrible massacres of Paris in the preceding autumn, had been perpetrated by a body of men not exceeding two hundred. He averred that, at that very moment, three thousand daggers of a peculiar construc- tion, were manufacturing at Birmingham, under the orders of a certain individual. How many of those were intended for exportation, and how many were designed for home consumption, had not yet been ascertained. He then pro- duced one of these daggers, and threw it on the floor, ex- claiming, " These are the presents which France designs for you ! By these she would propagate her freedom and fraternity ! But may heaven avert her principles from our minds, and her daggers from our hearts !"
