As he spoke Vivian moved out or the half-ruined porch into the open, where the ssoou shone dear ; and there—was he dreaming ?—two shadows fell distinctly upou the sward—bis own and i other's ! *'What do you mean by dogging me in this way PV 'cried the artist, fiercely turning on his. imaginary assailant ; but there was -no ooe visible. . He hastily dashed back into the cot tage and searched its rooms—only two ; the upper, floors, if spy each had existed, had been removed, or had fallen away, but he found no one. And yet, to account for the shadow fail ing where it did, the substance which pro jected it must have certainly stood just behind bim. lam growing aa nervous as seat, that's what. it. is," thought the young man passing out of the door, again, end persuading himself that all whioh Lie had seen and heard.waa msro fancy. Yet he coald not .forbear glancing again on the grass, and there—^>h, horrible!— N lay the double jhadows, one hie own, recognis able by the outline of his straw hat, the other vague, shapeless, hut distinctly visible. ... .

" 1% walk o'u and thick no mure of these fooleries," and he stepped out stardDy,f«r away from all possible shadow of the cottage, 'And the two shadows, sidfe by side, sped swiftly over the moor; while that footstep (very soft now, sa if it was deadened ,by the heather) kept behind him. Vivian desperately shot his eyes for a few moments end walked on, bat his straining ears still caught that light footfall at his back. He opened his eyes and halted.' He was standing in an utterly solitary place; ino tree nor tor near to throw a shadow ; "and yet two distinct outlines lay at his feet.

The rescuing parLy had been too occupied with tbe traveller to pause to examine his sur rounding! • but the children, climbing and peering about the tor at onue discovered that this stone had maiked tbe entranoe to a fair aired cavity amid the rocks. Anything like a " cave ■" is irresistibly attractive to every well constituted boy, and Tommy and Billy woiked diligently to enlarge the opening until they eould peep within—and beheld a man's skeleton, yet held together by a few mouldering yrinains of what hsd once been clothes or wrappings, some silver shoe-buckles, and % few coins of a century and a-half ago lying amid the du»t of what had probably been a purse ! Tommy sod Billy, horribly scared, and yet. greatly elated at becoming the.bearect of such an astonishing piece of ,news, fled back to the farm on tee wings of tbe wind ; then for. weeks, nay, month*, the whole locality was in a delicious state of excitement, marvel, and questioning.

In the earlier ball of the last century At was remem bered that an elderly man bad redded iu the ruinous oottege where Vimo had experienced so'disagreeable a shock. This man was not a native of the place ; he . lived a hermit .life ; none knew whioce he camp , or what .Was his occupation ; b«it it was whispered that.be wis a miser, and that gold sndeilver were. concealed in bis poor abode After reading for some yean in solitude, making no acquaintances and ad-, mitliog no visitors, be was suddenly, joined by an elderly turd-featured woman who deroribed herself as his daughter, and announced tbpt she; bad come to live with him and keep his bouse. It was said in the neighbourhood that the old man was greatly disturbed by her appearance, and received bar with the utmost reluctance. Passers-by thecottsge had often beard the psir engaged in angry discussiov^dd it was hinted; lliat some guilty secret was shared between them, andtk&tthe; old man's very obvious fear of his daughter znjghtbetha result of- a dread of bar revealing it. However, the woman made good her footing, and remained, and grew to be a power inthe vicinity. Bhe professed to be able to tell fortunes,revert-e spells, at&generally; as a 44 Vvhite witcb^; 'certainly die possessed a skill In Abe use of what she termed " yttbsV (i.e^ herbs), 4 which brought ber many customers. Bnt it was ah illicit, ainholy' kind - of trade which she drove; and the lonely .lane, bar usual oonsulting-room, bad witnessed some strange scenes. Pious and striofc- liyicg villagers sbook-their beads when Proa's nefcbe was' mentioned; but " prodigal youths end foolish maidens, And many a iocs! black1 sheep, found aoomplaiBaQt^end,.sns^fal ally; and, though m»ny a fanner cureed her under bis breath for a witch,', everyone was outwardly' civil to a woman' whom ill feared. Mean time the old man; "broke*\vi*ibly, anrl it was said that the woman tyrannised cruelly over him. One day he disappeared, ^ Prudence, when her father's absence , was .remarked upon, answered briefly .that ho had gone aw,ay to re side at Plymouth, she believed, being tired pf a' country, .life,. and had roads _ oyer _ the cottage to her.
