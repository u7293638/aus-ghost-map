SERMONS BY THE BISHOP OF MELBOURNE. The Right Rev Dr Gee, Bishop of Melbourne, preached at St James a Cathedral yesterday morning to a very large congrega- 'tion, the building being crowded The usual morning services of the day were read by the Rev. A. C. Kellaway and the Very Rev Dr Macartney Dean of Melbourne '! he Bishop took for his text a portion of the 7th verse of the 10th chapter of I Kings -"Behold, the half hath not been told.' He said The student of Bible history In gera with delight on the glories of the earlier years of the reign of King Solomon. It was in that reign that God s kingdom in the world for such was Israel reached its highest pitch of splendour and greatness and majesty The monarchy established in the person of David now culminated, and from this point we look down on the eventful career of the shepherd king Vic- remember how, having been hunted down by King Saul like a partridge upon the mountains, he at length succeeded him upon the throne. We recollect how, in the subsequent struggle, the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker, and the house of David stronger and stronger We remember how David was a man of war, having to fight for his kingdom first with enemies without their with rebellion within so that God regarded him as unfit to build the temple But when his life's fitful fever was ended, his son Solomon, a man of rest, the peaceful one ascends the throne The theocracy now shines forth in all its splendour The territorial dominion of Solomon stretches to the utmost bounds of the promises made to Abraham, and Moses, and Joshua. Then there is a period of profound peace the sound of arms is hushed We read that Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and his figures ' from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon The kings wealth was enormous, silver being nothing accounted of His marvellous vis door, which God gave him in answer to his prayer, spread his fame far and near Above all, it was his ground privilege to build the House of the Lord, solemnly to dedicate it to the worship of the Most High, to witness the heavenly fire consuming the sacrifice, and to see the divine glory till the House, while his subjects, prostrate on the pavement worshipped the Lord and shouted, for He is God for His mercy endureth for ever It was the golden prime of Jewry Far off nations gazed on it with awe and envy and the sacred narration has presented to us the record of the visit of the Queen of Sheba from the uttermost parts of the earth to see and hear and learn and wonder and adore, the words of the text are, as you know, the words of the Queen of Sheba. It is the tendency of rumours to grow in the telling , each successive reporter adds something on his own account to the original tale. But for once rumour did not exaggerate. Her many tongues altogether failed to convey to the Arabian Princess an adequate conception of the greatness of the Lord's anointed. She gazed on it till ' there was no more spirit in her and then she said to the king, ' It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. Howbeit I believed not the words until I came and mine eyes had seen it, and behold the half was not told to me My brethren, a greater than Solomon is here The wealth and prosperity and wisdom of Solomon were but the ordained foreshadowing of the glory of Him who is both David's son and Davids Lord and the happiness of Israel at this time is but a faint administration of the blessings of the Gospel, enjoyed here in part and to been enjoyed fully hereafter by the faithful subjects of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords The more the subjects of the great King come to know of the sweetness of His presence with them, of the tokens of His favour, of the communications of wisdom and grace that flow from Him the more are they constrained to exclaim- Behold the half was not told me. They find that the love of Christ passeth knowledge that he peace of God passeth all understanding, and that " eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things that God hath prepared for them that love him. It is quite the reverse with worldly things Whatever they have in them to meet the aspirations and longings of the human heart is soon told, and is scarce worth the telling you all remember the record of Solomons melancholy ex perience after his heathen wives had turned his heart away from God-in that singular book Ecclesiastes. In that book he gives an elaborate account of his quest of happiness from the things of this world, he tells you of his houses, of his gardens, of his vine yards, and of his cattle, his money, his musical entertainments his fame and re nown-in fact the various things which un- changed men live for now And what was the result of the experiment ' Does Solomon invite you to take a long journey such as the Queen of Sheba took * Does he intimate that he has not told you the half of the happiness and satisfaction which he derived from this chase after happiness, this royal effort to quench the thirst of the soul out of the cisterns of this world' Nay, rather he would have you believe that if you take such a journey you will find nothing to reward your pains He says, after accumulating all this store of earthly g lad, I looked on all the works that mine hand had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun It was no better nor more substantial than a soap bubble to begin with, and in due time the bubble burst Perhaps you will ask what was the difference between Solomon and all his glory as the Queen of Sheba saw him and Solomon in all his glory as he describes him self in Ecclesiastes I answer that in the former case Solomon had the blessing of the Lord which maketh rich that in the latter case he had departed from God, and his heart had ceased to be perfect with him As in the e esq of a number of thoughts which owe all their value to the figure which stands on the left of them, and subside into their natural nothingness the moment that figure is removed, so it is with the things of this world, let a man walk with God and then worldly goods have their value , let him de part from God and then the things of this world are less than nothing, and vanity in a being constituted as man is the blessings of true religion are invested with a peculiar attractiveness by the thought that the half has not been told-yen, cannot be told us We love the mystery of expectation and to have something still better, higher nobler in the future to look forward to It is said of an ancient potentate that when he had conquered the world he wept, there were no other worlds to conquer the story, whether it be true in fact or no is true to human nature and while it deserves the attention of all unconverted persons it demands the consideration of those who may have reached middle age or old age when all that the world can do for men has been found out and who, also ! as yet know nothing of their new life of the blessedness of which the bull cannot be told What a sad confession is that of Lord Chesterfield 1 I have seen he says the silly rounds of business and pleasure, and have done with them all I have enjoyed all the pleasures of the limbs and consequently know their futility, and do not regret their loss 1 up praise them at their real value which is in truth very small Those who have not experienced them always overrate them. in hell I reflect on what I have seen, and hear Fund done I can hardly persuade myself that all my pie mures had any reality , but I look back on all that is past as one of those romantic dreams which opium occasions and I do not desire to repeat the nauseous down for the sale of the fugitive dream Shall I tell you that I bear this melancholy situation with that meritorious resignation which most people boast of Nobler really I cannot help it I bear it. I must bear it, whether I will or no, I think of nothing but killing time the best way I can now that he has become my enemy It is my resolution to keep in the carriage during the remainder of the journey The writer of these melancholy words died little more than a century ago, and he seems not to have known much more of the Gospel than a Paguu So true is it that the H )ly Ghost alone is the giver of life to dead souls. On the other hand, true re Luton carries with it not only no disappointment but art unknown amplitude of satisfaction which lures the soul onward and still onward by the discovery of richer fields of experience, more exalted heights of knowledge, beyond and above the halt is never told the love of Jesus is so sweet, His riches so unsearchable His fulness so in exhaustible, that He who has tasted it is refreshed for the present and the taste creating a pleased expectation of more blessing in the future so that he could sine, - Jesus thou Joy of livin: hearts Thou fount of life and light oil in II II in the best bliss that earth Ilinnirls Me turn unfilled to Then again i We quite thee O thou hill x I lead An I long to feast that It mine si 111 We drink of Thos the four men hut I And thirst our souls for 11 en to till Death, which puts a period to earthly de Behn has its power to arrest the progress or interrupt the joys of them that seek their hut pim HU in Christ 1 hose Joy s arc spiritual not carnal and the souls of the saints when delivered from the burden of the Mesh become capable of more intimate communion with the Suv tour than they were while in the body and hence it is that to the believer to die is gain to die and to be with Christ is far better More can be told him, though still not the half, of what Christ has done, is doing, and will do for the soul that waited for Him And when the Lord shall come again in His majesty to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all them that believe-when He shall main fear Himself, to them, and allow them to see Him face to face, and to walk with Him in white still it will take eternity to unfold the length and breadth and depth of-that love of which, while here below, the half had not been told them Mydearbretnren, you can all say concerning this, " We have heard the fame thereof with ourers. It is fit that I should tell you, if any of you came here this morning thinking that the new bishop was about to preach a new Gospel, that you have come with a very mistaken expectation. The old story of Christ Jesus and Him crucified is that which it has ever been my privilege to tell, and may God grant me grace to tell it in all its clearness and fulness and simplicity as long as I can raise my voice amongst you. but now I am about to ask you this question Have you all acted with respect to the blessings of the Gospel as the Queen of Sheba did » Mark again what she said to Solomon concerning the report she had heard of him I believed not the words until I came, and mine eyes had seen it" Have you followed her example' bbe took a long and arduous journey in order that she might gaze upon the shadow , what have you done that you may become acquainted with the substance' What are you saying or doing for Christ's At this time of the year we celebrate Easter festivities, and we meet together to praise God for the resurrection of his Son Our Lord, which guarantees His divinity, and the everlasting efficacy of his atonement, and the unutterable pre ciousness of the blood of sprinkling, As surely as Christ rose again on the third day, so surely will He come again We shall have to stand before, His tribunal to give an account of the deeds done in the body What account are we about to give? That we shall give it is certain Remember what St Paul said at Athens. He said that God called on men everywhere to repent, because He had appointed a day in which He would judge the world in righteous ness by that Man whom He had ordained, whereof He had given assurance to all men in that he had raised him from the dead. The resurrection from the dead is an assurance that the judgment of God is to follow. We have spoken of the Queen of Sheba this day. something is said about the testimony she will bear by and-by. "The queen of the south shall rise up in judgment against this generation and shall condemn it, for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon is here " My brethren, let us turn our hearts to God this day. Let us give Him deep and true repentance. Let us put our whole trust in His most precious sacrifice, and gladly yield up ourselves to Him, lest at the last, when he comes again in glorious majesty to judge both the quick and the dead, we should be condemned by the example of the Queen of Sheba which we neglected to follow. A sermon was also preached in the evening at Christ Church, St Kilda, by the bishop The services for the evening were read by the Rev J. Stanley Low.tbeinctimbent, and by the Rev. R. Stephen, curate The bishop preached from part of the 17th verse of the chapter of Romans "for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith ' He referred specially to the absolute necessity of faith, and said that it be were privileged to be long in this colony they would often hear him speak of faith The longer he lived the more was he convinced of the supreme importance of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ It persons had only a little of it they should thank God for that every day of their lives, and should encourage it and value it, and try in every way to foster and increase it
