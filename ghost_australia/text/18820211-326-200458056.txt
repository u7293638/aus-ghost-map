ORIGINAL POETRY. CONTEMPLATION. I stood upon a lonely strand, Where human foot had seldom trod , Where nature seemed to breathe alpad The name of God. The rocks in sullen grandeur frowned As guardians of a sleepy land, Robed in such majesty as when Leaving their Maker's hand. S'-ated upon a shelving rock I heard the wild winds murmuring cry, And saw the ships from out the mists Lik.- stately ghosts go sailing by. t ti/inw/1 iua ip/>Ar/1o n t. C A TOfl in Of sea birds, as they ploughed their way, Skimming with eagle eye the depths To dirt aud stize their prey. At! when the hasty banquet o'er, Pluming their snowy breasts, They fold their weary wings awhile Hocked on the wives to rest. While oa the extreme horizon's verge Where sea and sky seemed one, A noble ship at anchor lay Bathed in the setting sun. W .os:- rays concentred oo the spot A golden padt had rivin, That seemed to rise from ocean's depths Straight up to tue gates of heaven. Now i.ight's enshrouding mantle falls, Objuring sea and sky, And the rippleB of the murmuring wave Seemed nature's iullaby. VVheu lo 'he orb of night appears, As by an enchanter's rod, And whi-pers uiy heart, " From uature hear ; Look up to nature's God." Brig It A. K.
