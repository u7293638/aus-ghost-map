BUTLER'S CATECHISM.; .' / / HO. XVII.,!-- : vd; : THEHEr is no mistake about the -doctrine of " baptismal regeneration '"//as 'taught/' the little children:' in Popish' schools ; das' to the proof of ;it, ho wever, or the truth/of it, if. the childi'.en >yere for 'a;moment per mitted to think, -they would feel that the mistake is very terrible) : . -Kqe question is asked what -is >!" bap tism?" and theanswer given ispA sacra-' ment which ' cleanses from : originfo,' svti, makes us Christians and chililrenf /God) and -heirs of-, the .kingdom of -nheaven.'?; Not , a word. of .proof. -r.The assertion is- made and the children are required' to believe it without proof. Butler took care to avoid pretending that any passage in Scripture teaches such monstrous false hood. When he thinks that some passage has the show of proof for his teaching hie carefully quotes ; as, for example, when lie aBks about the necessity of baptism for salvation, he quotes very : greedily and doubtless triumphantly the passage about ."Except . . . ye cannot enter the king- , dom of heaven ;" there is therefore a very good reason why he did not attempt to quote a passage about " baptism cleansing .us from original sin, making us Chris tians and children of God, and heirs of the kingdom of heaven." 'The reason is that he could not find one— no, not one that had evemtke show of proof: of such falsehood; : If; the children- could dare say: hny thing about sucli a matter' they would- unquestionably be > struck by such' a-cir- cumstance., - Surely, -if, ; it- were 'true that: " baptism " is able to do what Butler says it infallibly does, ought' not the proof ; to be very clear 1 Butler tells the children to believe that i baptism " cleanses from original sin:!'" When a child is baptized, then,' it - be- comes, as if it had neveiv been/ connected with Adam, or as - if Adam; had 1 ifeyer- ; fallen ! Could anything- be -falser i"> For/ the moment after the cliild' is' baptized; yea, in. the very act of being baptized the child may scream > with disease and pain, or actually- die j but if- baptized; babies1 are cleansed : from original sin; why should ! they, be liablei to i disease and pain and' death, ; . which ; are ; only consequences of original sin? ; . ; .i; . : ; ;i ; - Butler, says that' baptism " makes/ us : Christians !" ; Is it -riot remarkable that the Scriptures say riot a word of this ! If baptism . could- -make v. " Christians," and' was intended.to make Christians, -surely Christ, ought to'- have said 'so Clearly; .1 But he. has not said so;/ O f' course ; we shall be told of the text— ' Go ;ye arid disciple all; nations,, baptizing !them;"'dic; ) -butit -is' | yet; to be proved :tliat ; it; is;: baptism which ' makes - any man a disciple,1 or/ that1 thit' dis- cipleshij) so effectual " is equivalent to the ; .making of a man a Ghristian-" a:child of Godwand an h'eiri of dieaveri." ; We ' have' only to look at ,the thousands of' larrikins that are pests in the'streets of -Sydney— .all . baptized— all cleansed. from; 'original sin— and all made Christians children/ of God and heirs':» of'/heaven— to- seel the' base imposture, and; to be amazed/ at the 1 effrontery of/ men !who; will sell' tiieir! nostrums at so. much a piece !

The children who are known as "juvenile offenders " — the children who go to the " Yernon " and the Island of Biloela — and the men who usually reach the "gaols arid the gallows are usually those who have, been made " Christians," " children of God,, and heirs of heaven." True, heretics sometimes get them 'also ; "but 'there is", no wonder that " heretics" .get ' them for' they never are " cleansed from original ' sin, never are. made true Christians, irieyer are made the children, of God, and heirs of heaven j" tlie ' wonder /is,' that , those who are so changed and privileged, should be worse in crime and wickedness . that those who never pretend to have undergone so great a regeneration ! ir ' But Butler goes on to prove that" bap- ,tisin /'is necessary to salvation."
