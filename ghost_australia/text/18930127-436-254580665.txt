A FEW REMARKS ON CREDIT. Always beat in mind that in trusting a man you are doing him a favor, and at the same time when a bill is due yon have just as good a right to request him to settle as he has to request, yon to get the jab done on time in the first place. Always set a time when a bill shall be paid. Indefinite credit is the worst of all evils. The more prompt a man can be made to pay, the better customer he becomes. If a man proves to be a poor pay and unreliable, do not continue to accept his orders. Never credit on the strength of personal acquaintance alone. A man may have the hearty grip, winning smile, and tender conscience of a Young Men's Christian Association secretary, and yet never dream that your pay roll comes around on Saturday. He may have an eye of tender blue and wear the finest clothes, you may see the corner of a half-used checkbook sticking ont of his inside pocket, yet he may never pay his bills. When aeked for credit, always investigate the man's previous standing and get your information from the people who trusted him before. Always bear in mind, ««The best criterion as to how a man will pay his bills is the way he has paid them." Study this subject and you will realize before you are too old to profit by it the value of cash on hand—tbe ghost-like, unreal, visionary value of book accounts.— Texas Commercial Traveller.
