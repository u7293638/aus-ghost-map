There is li vin- fallen at Cttniegiugand Jindalee Thereisn't inichinthe in o. news to comiiiuuiPufp The most prominent matter of the past week or so has been till st firing of a an eminent for the planting of trees At a n parts"- of the hospital committee, held on Monday last., this subject came on for discussion on a motion proposed by Mr. Hawkins He asked the committee to plant the ho pital round with trees, at a cost of not more than £2 per tie", or a supposed expenditure of about £40 or so The resolution was carried, and as the owner of the property in Johns Ann-street and tarcutta-street in the neighbourhood, with whom this movement has originated, are about planting the fronts other premises, we may look for a pleasing improvement in the locality after a time At the same meeting the; deplorable state or the drainage of the hospital was forced on the attention of the committee by a complaint from Dr O'Connor, who stated that the surface water from the premises flowed into his property adjoining, and also into the hospital well I did- I eases m arose in which Dr A ren condemned in the s r Dost manner the inefficient drainage of the building, but as the erection of a hospital on another site is a favourite idea with many, the proposal to go in for a thorough and permanent scheme of drainage work was not held in great I favour Mr Baker, manager of the Union Bank, pointed out the inconsistency of voting money for the purpose of planting trees, whilst they are reluctant to incur the exp nditure races try to perfect the sanitary condition of this temporary home for the sick The managers of the tree-planting movement having i e "did so well with the hospital committee, carried thing in" face next into the Mechanics' Institute and at the sitting of Thursday last were enabled to carry a resolution voting the sum of £20 for the purpose of planting trees around the institute which stands at one of the corners of the street, in which ino o mainly interested in the new lean have their properties The vote of this committee has taken a good many by surprise" as the institution is in debt his some heavy liabilities for improv Presents to meet' next month, and, moreover, has for us library n collect on which is really a reproach to the town Airare than half of the books on the catalogue are thoroughly worn out, and there is a crying need for the spending of a good round sum in books Taking these facts into consideration, and the fact that this comer vi of the funds of the institute is held by reliable authorities to be illegal, we are likely to hear a little more about this matter. The Murrumbidgee Pastoral As such it can have just issued their programme for the annual exhibition, which is fixed to take place on the 12th September The programme of last year was remarkable for the large number of special prizes that were given this year I find the number is much reduced The new feature in, the prize list of this year is a magnificent gift from Messrs R Goldsbrough and Co T brough the local agents, Messrs Wilkinson, Hann, Minchin and Co ; this firm presents four cups for competition of the total value of to-the is a cup value 12 10s for each of the following exhibits -Pen of two best merino rams, 2-tooth, shorn as lambs, pen of merino ewes, ditto, pen of merino rams, 2-tooth, and pen of merino ewes, s uno case The prizes, exclusive of Messrs Goldsbrough's gilt, are over £200 in all AA e have a young lady in this neighbourhood just now who is about as s range a specimen of female larrikinism as one can well imagine" Some of her freaks at night involve the necessity of donning male attire Her latest amuse- ment is likely to lead to trouble if persevered in it, with a hideous mask and a white sheet or robe, this adventurous female has been playing the ghost, concealing herself in the dark under the lagoon bridge and other lonely places at night, and, stalking out upon the unwary passengers, has succeeded in more than one instance in establishing that state pop dearly described as home" frightened into fits " The members of the Wagga Cricket Club had a pleasant evening on Monday last on the occasion of the presentation of a hat to Mr S Tompson, as the highest scorer in the match with the Tumut team The present was the gift of Air Black, th»ma_»gei of the Bank of New South Wales and the recipient is the strong right hand of the M aggn Club, at the club's success in most of its winning matches is to be attributed to this young gentleman's splendid bowling The Narrandera land office has been again opened for business, and arrangements have now been made for the regular transaction of land business in this rapidly rising little township The resolutions with reference to the Wagga Bridge, to be proposed on Friday night by Mr Leary in the assembly, though touching a matter which affects the prosperity of a good many in the district, do not excite much comment here The net result of all negotiations with the Bridge Company have hitherto been and The extraordinary sum demanded by the directors has invariably stopped the way of all settlement of the matter, and as there is no likelihood that they have abated one jot of their pretensions, very little is hoped for as a result of Mr Lean's energetic attention to the subject The business report of the first week is something better than for the week or so previous and hopes are enter- tained that considerable improvements will follow the rainfall of the last two or three days There is a decided increase of confidence within the past fortnight, and in stock matters a marked advance in the price of sheep is to be noted for this week The following sales have been made during the past week -Messrs Wilkinson Hann, Al melun, and Co have sold 6500 6-tooth wethers for the Messrs, Peppin, of Boonoke, oOOO wethers for M'Culloch, Sellar, and Co., of I Udarra, 50 head of fat cattle for Mr John Wilkinson, of Tumut Messrs Fosbery, Mackinnon, and Co have sold oOOO owes for Messrs Peppin, and 4000 mixed weaners for Wilson and M'Callum, of Pomingalarna The conditional purchases made at the Land-office on Thursday amounted to 292 acres, in six selections The Murrumbidgee Turf Club is a meeting to-night for the purpose of cutting out the programme for the years I rae e , but I am obliged to close without the result to catch the man I believe it is probable that very little difference will be found in the year's list of prices from last year's or, if any, the tendency will be towards reduction.
