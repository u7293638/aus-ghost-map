PARLIAMENT. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. " TUESDAY, OCT. 3. The SpEAR it took the chair at half post 4 o'clock PROGRESSIVE PUBLIC WORKS POLK On the motion that the Speak or leave the chair and the House go into committee of supply, Sir BRYAN O LOGICI RAN" said that it was very important that Thursday should be taken ad vantage of by those members as he wished to address the Government or the House upon any particular point He desired to call the attention of the Government to the way in which limp was running on and the opportunity was hems missed of bringing terms all the matter of a loan One of the principal wits of the country at the present time was a loan and the continuous progression of public works If a substantial loan was not floated this air, or port or was not taken to float in this year or the beginning of next year, the Government would be for 12 months Without the means of proceeding with the construction of railways or other public works It would be objected that the present time was not favourable for going to the London market for a loan but plenty of money it is to be got in the London market by simply offering to take it at 4 per cent There was no reason whatever why the country should be bound down to 3½ percent People might say) " How about those who have lent money to the colony at 35 per cent.' but these tenders could very well look after themselves Their 3s per cent loan would stand at a very good figure The Government could get as much money as was wanted for the completion of the railway) system if the) liked to give 4 per cent, for it Mr Speight was quite right in saying that the present System of railway would pass within a few years, and the God ernment ought certainly) to continue to "boom the railways The time of the session was going b), and it was most urgent that power should be taken to raise a loan for if power was not taken now the matter would have to be over until after the general election The Government should take into consideration the advisability of getting a loan of £4 000 000 or so 000 000 and should lay) themselves out to get £20,000 000 or £25,000,000 more during the next seven years The Treasurer was to be given credit for having pulled the finances straight (Laughter) The finances an away s were intrinsically straight, but he had s pulled them straight in the eyes of the public (Laughter ) A loan of £4 000 000 or £5,000,000 should be raised every ear or every second year so as to complete about 8 000 more miles of railway and in fact keep the country on the road to prosperity There was no doubt that the railway) system here with all its drawbacks and all the money that had to be spent on it was a great success, and he would rather extend the system to e» er) farmer who is wanted a line than gig of the farmers a second vote (Laughter) The Government ought to keep the question in view, because if it was not brought before the House within the next two or three weeks the session would be practically ended and the opportunity lost for 12 months. The Government would have to be tried by its energy and pluck in initiating the new and bold policy) for which the country was waiting Hu people wanted to know when the present quiescence was going,; to cease and when the public works and rail to aya which the country demanded were going to be proceeded with There was no reason at all why the colony should not pay 4 per cent instead of 8 per cent. It only meant 4s 6d or 5s per cent more, and surely it was worth while to pay this and get all the money that was wanted without v waiting for a few ourable moment in the London market The London money) market might be affected by causes of which we knew nothing here A shot might be fired in Europe which would be followed by a Continental war, and then for years the colony would not be able to get money) even at 4 per cent. The Standing Railways Com- mittees presumably intended to recommend Borne railways to the Government, and hair was provision to be made for the construc- tion If the loan wasobtumedthepresentquiea dence would disappear and trade would he once more alive all through the colony The moment that people believed that the Government intended to take this matter into serious consideration and to take action upon it confidence would be restored and business would go ahead again Mr MUNRO said that of course everyone knew that before the session was over the Gore ernment must bring in a loan bill, but at the present time he was not prepared to lay to what extent the I bill would go The Government, has ever, t doubtedly intended to bring in a loan bill before the session closed There could be no intention to borrow money be fore the 31st December, but the hon. member might rest assured that power would be taken Mr. !" YRPrR felt that it was very unfortunate that the hon member for Port Fairy should have brought the matter of a loan up at the present juncture 'The reply of the Premier would Iil telegraphed to England and would appear in the London papers on the following day These early announce ments of a loan to come forward had a most damaging effect on the stock Mr MASON. would like to point out that -when the Standing Railways Committee was appointed the late Premier informed the House that the committee would deal with a few hundred miles of railway within a few months, but as yet no recommendations had been received from the committee Had the country foregone its right to the lines proposed by the late Government's His own constituents expected some consideration shown) of railway) conStruction, and he would like to know whether the Government intended dealing; this session with the proposals to be submitted by the Standing Railway. Committee A large amount of mine.) plant was in hand, and a number of contractors were in the colony, but the plant would be disposed of, and the contractors would leave for some other colony where construction was going on, unless the Government endeavoured to get at them. There was no need to think that the disclosure of the intention of the Government to float a local would cause alarm, and it was to be hoped that the Go ernment would make poor sion in the bill for carry ing out the present system of railway construction Mr PAIUrilSON thought it was very little use asking for a loan for the purpose of carry ing out existing en regiments only Mr MUNRO -I did not say it would be confined to that Mr PAterSON thought the Premier might just as well say at once or whether it was intended to go on with public works We should announce to the world that we had confidence in our own colony and its resources, and that we were not going to stand absolutely still to e should legislate so as to give confidence to the people instead of that our legislation was of a character to frighten capital out of the colony ( ' Oh, of ) the value of the remarks of the hon. member for Belfast were destroyed by their extravagance when he talked about 20 millions of money We should proceed reasonably mild steadily The pohevofthe Government had been one of liquidation and is Hiding ep (" Oh, oh,' and laughter ) There was a continual cry) that there was no money for this and for that Mr MUNRO-1 on pained it for two years in advance Air PAT 11 RSOV -'J he statement of the hon. member for Belfast that the present 'Treasurer had pulled things straight was a most extraordinary out Where had he got the money to pull things straight What had he done to make up the tremendous de la tones that he much was said about' VMuro had been received of sited a single Binding' Mr MUNRO -Half a million this year Mr PAT J TUSÓN - It was a mere matter of bookkeeping between one Treasurer and another He rose, however, for the purpose of asking for a statement home the Premio that the public works of the colony) were not to be stopped and railways especially were to be carried on at a reasonable price Money should not be borrow ed for the purpose of creating an unlighted condition of the money market, but to carry out lines on the basis of the recommendations of the hallway Com under , Mr MUNRO-Aie you going to carry out their recommendations before the) re port' Mt PA I I PRSOV it was necessary to look ahead and finance I beforehand 'The hon. member f i Iltlfast was perfectly) just and in calling iitUnti n to this matter for capital was needed to carry out public vi 111 s Min lil N P tlinuclit it is strange that a small annuity should have called forth such a he had debate As the lining) fe committee had I ten n felled it he would learning that the first it port of that committee is as already before I parliament and the whole of the pi ht t of the infirmities must be determined by what firmament deal with the liquor "When fruit n ii It was dealt with the committee won be prepared with several recent nicnuiutoiiH M lil HILL thought the R iilwn» Com mitten lins appoints 1 for the purpose of 5,111111, railway) contained in a test whilst inquiry is now being made and for the purpose of avoiding the borrowing of more money for the present the colony had been warned that it must not no on the money market too soon again As soon as the results of the work of the Kiulwn) Committee were before the House and the present haphazard bill was out of the soul the House would be prepared to deal with the question of railing a) construction Mr G D CARTER said he had received a letter from the respected member for Rodney (Mr Shackell) who was in 1 behind, and as a good deal of it appeared to bear upon the question that the House was considering now-, and also the one w high as as being dealt with last night he went I take the opportunity of quoting a few of his words (2 No, no ) Mr W A C ARTER Do the people in England care about the dual -vote Mr G D CARTER -The remarks of Mr Shackell deserved the attention of the House I Mr T SMITH Take it as read The SPEAKER Order, order It has become customary) when an hon. member expresses a are at variance with that of some hon. members that a dozen members interrupt him with a view of trying to prevent him speaking I hope the practice won the persisted in or I shall time to put it down more severely I hope hon. members will assist me in this (Hear, hear.)

He was awaking to the result of what their action would be if they were allowed to dominate this country But his action was not the outcome of his individual zeal so much as that of his constituents behind him They said We will have no more of it If you don't take some steps to prevent this sort of thing we will get someone else who will do it That was what had led him to take up the splendid position which he had done on this question It was to be hoped that when he (pointing to the hon. member for Col lingwooUgot up again to suggest the tutu wg out of such a man as Mr Deakin Mr HANCOCK -' He is Mr Speaker, 13 that in order ' I represent a constituency and I claim the respect due to a member of this House The SPEAKE R - The hon. member must be referred to as the hon. member for Col Unger and Mr BEN T But this gentleman referred to me the other night as the hon. member for Cabbage (Laughter ) Mr. STAUGHTON gave the hon member for Collingwood credit for not meaning what he said a very often He believed there were occasions when the hon. member did not know what he said He do not know the effect of what he said He was only a ' new chum, who had been ill the colony for two or three years, but he seemed to have a vast number of people at his heels with rings in their noses Mr HANCOCK His nose has been wrung too long Mr STAUGH10N-The hon. member was responsible for the trouble that had arisen over the last strike He was respon- sible for the great misery) that had been created He had gone round continually using false and vicious and bitter words against those by whom he was opposed Mr BENT Hear, hear Mr SrAUGAION-It was more attributable to him than any other man in the community that there had been so much misery and wretchedness Mr BENT -Rum and degradation Mr RICHARDSON-Mr Speaker, I rise to a point of order I ask if it is in order to discuss the hon member for of others' good and the Trades hall Council The SPEAKER When the motion is that I leave the chair in order that the House may go into Committee of Supply) it is the time for the redress of grievances andan lion number is at liberty to speak on almost any subject except an order of the du) Mr SIAUGI110N-Hie hon. member for Collingwood was an I Englishman, but he certainly was not an Australian and he was only a ' new' chum He was a foreigner (Laughter ) no knew pretty well that he was served better in Australia than he was at home, and it was to be hoped that he would stick to us But it was to be regretted that he was in the habit of in duping 111 speeches which were not designed to fur til at his cause, and which did 1111 incalculable amount of damage: to the country by causing the interest on our loans to be raised With regard to the question of loans it would be interesting to know when the Government proposed to do something I lie) had come into office with a great flourish of trumpets, and said that they were going to conduct the affairs of the country on proper lines-not that the) body had said that the late Government had conducted their administration on bad lines Mr MALONEY -lim did though """*? Mr STAUGHTON would say, with reference to the hon member for Vi est Melbourne, that there could be no Government complete without that little gentleman, but when he took office it would be a scary time for the complaints (Laughter ) At the same time it must be recognized that he was a mee and kind hearted little fellow IheSPl BAKER -The hon. gentleman has not finished his imbecile, and strictly) speaking I have no right to interfere, but I am desirous that the debate shall not do if it into pusontthties It 1 allow- the hon gentleman latitude I must allow other members the same latitude I would therefore ask the hon member not to say any thing that is cult related to draw aphis from other hon members Mr ST AUGHEY win sure that the hen member for As yet M lboume was about taking notice of an) little learned that he might mule He trusts 1 tiny tea lion me and her in the nia_,iiitudi to Inn mind would forget anything he had will (It lighter With reference to the late Go a moment, he would say Hutt it they had instead the imp remains) of numbers to get railways constructs 1 more rapidly) till 11 tiny animals to be etiistiuetid that would have no Httitic, on the licensed) 11 aches with an ovation in,, treating of tin present time He is skiing the tent with the linen Esq leswell I) Mr Speight that it was all Pte quite -safe to 1,0 on with the constitution of men under me giving an open life of from j. 1 NO 000 to be 001) 600 a year but the propos- lies the hon. member for Port 1 air was one that st austere 1 him the Government should "iv 1 an india HITCH of what the) 111 tended to do at an uni) date, because hon. members did not know how long they were going to occupy the Treasury benches Mr QRAVrS-I have never heard you speak so long or so well (Laughter and cheers.) Mr ST AL CUT ON was glad to hear the interjection of the hon. member for Delatite If there was anything of importance and as eight to be said it might be expected from the hon. member (Laughter ) Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN rose to a point of order A letter written by an absent member to another member had been laid on the table of the House It assailed a third hon member, and he would like to know whether it was in order that the letter should be laid on the table The SPEAKER -The rule is that no statement can be read to the House which cannot be said in the House if the hon member referred to in the letter objects to anything that is said in it, I shall rule that it be not laid on the table Mr HANCOCK said he did not object to the letter being received into the archives of the House as an historical document It would indicate to posterity how low a pair) could sink when it was beaten He was too well used to abuse to pay the slightest attention to anything that was said by) an) hon member He was perfectly certain that nothing too bad could be said of him (Laughter ) He looked upon the whole of the discussion as an attempt to delay reform that was demanded 1 by the people are made no secret of the fact that if the reforms those he represented were anxious to secure were carried they would very seriously affect members of the stump of the hon member for rest Bourke Did hon members not think that it was time that references to the recent strike were dropped ' Mr G D CARTER,-No Mr HANCOCK-If hon. members wanted a rev lv al of painful scenes in the House he had no objection to tell a story of the strike which would startle a large number of hon members. The statement that he had delayed the settlement of the strike-as a large section of the House knew-was incorrect It was unfair and undignified to attack him in the manner that he had been attacked It there was an) grievance against those who sat in front of him why were they not attacked instead of him, a humble follower of the Government He did not object to the notice that he was recent mg, for it was the best advertisement that he could have, and he knew he had the support of the working men of Australia. The action of an absent hon member in penning in a London coffee house a letter traducing him was only part of a great scheme to make him the bogey man of Victoria He was ashamed of the party to which that hon. member belonged It was composed of folks he could not respect, and he could not look forward to the time when he with others could say " "35 e have beaten good men Mr G D CARTER -We have not cut off the gas at any rate (Laughter ) Mr. HANCOCK said that observation was on inducement for him to go into a very painful subject, but to reply to an intersection was disorderly, and so he would treat it with the contempt it deserved. He would simply say that the strike was brought about by the overbearing conduct of the propertied classes It was brought about through an endeavour to bring the condition of the working classes were down to the level of that of the working classes in the old country. The working classes here had tried to maintain the privileges which were the boast of everyone who went from the colonies to the old country The gentleman who wrote this letter and the gentleman who received it were both worthy of the recognition of Her Majesty on the next 24th of May, and he sincerely hoped they would get it When he entered this House he was reproached with being a new chum He Knew a new chum, but he came here to stay) When he found a great im- provement in the condition of the working men here as compared with the condition of the working men in the old country, he determined that nothing would be wanting in him to at least maintain that condition, and, if possible, to improve it Every plank of the much despised Progressive Political League was intended to prevent the working men here from sinking back into the condition of the working men in the old country There was a kindred in stitution called the National Association The one was trying to preserve e the rights of labour, and the other was trying to preserve the wrongs of labour At every) meeting he had attended, whether in metropolitan, suburban, or provincial constituencies, resolutions had been unanimously carried adopting the programme of the Progressive Political League He firmly believed that a large number of hon. members would embrace the planks of that platform, because there was nothing aggressive in it except in regard to the owners of large estates It was for the demolition, not for the confisca- tion, of that class so that opportunities might be given to the labourer to endeavour to procure the full fruits of his labour, that the association had been formed These extracts from London papers, which had been put round the colony) very scientifically, he had in his possession some months ago, and the majority of them were based on very imperfect information supplied to the metropolitan papers Reference had been made to what he said on the opening of the session as to the banks What that he said was that there was need for reform in our banking laws 80 that we could tell the difference between a banker and a pawnbroker, and he would ask hon. members of what had transpired since he said that did not prove the necessity for reform in our banking law. He did not attempt to blame our legitimate banking institutions he only referred to the sham mushroom banks that existed in this at) and which were crumbling one by one He sincerely hoped that this was the last time that he would be attacked in the manner in which he had been on this occasion Mr HIGHETT said the course of the debate had somewhat changed The hon member for Belfast opened with the question of loans, and from that hon. members had gradually got to the question of strikes six e had a large amount of 8) sympathy here with men in the old country, because we felt that those men had to work for a small pittance, and that their struggle for life was so hard that they were almost forced to exist on the bare necessaries of life Here the circumstances were quite different The struggle here had not been to get enough to live upon, but those who were organised endeavoured to prevent those who were not organised from competing for a fair day's work He quite admitted that it was not ad unable to fight on this question is whether a member of Parliament might call himself a labour candidate or not the effect of setting one portion of the community against another would be injurious to the whole In reference to the loan question, he certainly believed that the country considered we had been going too fast If there was any intention of going on with railway construction hon. members should have the report of the Railtt says Standing Committee before them, so that they might be in a better post tion to form an opinion as to the desirability of railway construction at the present time it is as well known that the country people desired fresh lines to be constructed Mr. ARMYTAGE said the farmers did not wish to curse the trades hall at all 'They looked to the mineshaft to maintain the present prosperity of the working classes The farmers could not see that there was any necessity to crush the working man What the country part) objected to even the power that the Trades hall attempted to exercise in the country Mr MURRAY said that the hon. member for West Bourke was suffering very deep) from malaria which to night had reached the acute and delirious stage-(laughter)-mid the hon. member was in the position that he really did not know what he was saying, and from what the House knew of the hon member that must be evident hon. members had not r known the hon. member before to make an ungentlemanly or unfair attack on the) other member, no matter how much the hon. member for East Bourke might differ it on that hon. member in politics The case of the trouble to night had I seen the letter read by the lion in instr for Melbourne They were all glad to hear of the hon. member for Rodney (Mr Shackell), and trusted he was well and that he had been successful in his mission He was sure that no minister of the liberal pint) begrudge 1 the hon. member for Rodney) tin vicarious snatch ninth he had an ad to his constituents by the li ttt r written to the hon member in Melbourne an 1 which that hon. member displayed the bad taste in lead me Mr M MOM *t san' in the lion merit ei for East Bourke lies going to attack him continually he would cert unit back his earnestness against the hon. members pom posits (Laughter) He resentful very much that the hon member for Mel bourne saw fit to lead a private letter in the house He (Mr Maloney) said that letter through and could see nothing giving permission to the line member to make it public Mr C D LAR11K-Hitit is my business Mr MUO\r\ would be ashamed of a friend to whom he had written in a letter in that friend inn It it public without his (Mr Maloney a) permission He (stories in the fact that he was one of the of it itors dunn), the late still e In that letter then was a long statement that the popular lea here had inherited the c disunion of the land Mr 0 I" CARL I If that is one of the planks of your platform (Hear, hear.) Mr. MALONEY- I hat was a flagrant untruth The hon member must have read the programme 1 covers his spectacles M. Thomas there was a labour light he (Mr Malone)) would be on the side of the workers If they were in the wrong he would be only too soon r), but right or so long he would lie on their side Mr W T. CARTER said the letter from which the hon. member for Melbourne had quoted was worthy of being read right through in order to show how this doughty opponent of the Trades hall was seeking to st r e the farmers Mr G D C YlUEP that a past age I have read ' Mr W T CYR! ER-It was a passage from a letter that had become the property of the House. Mr. G D CARTER said he understood if to have been the Speakers lulim.-(Ones of Ah) that only such passages of a letter laid upon the table should be read as had been marked by the owner of it Passages which related to the writer s private affairs ought not to be read Mr YYr 1 CARTER- although all things might be lawful all things might not be expedient Mr G D CYR TER-I leave it to your own good taste Mr W T C ARTER hoped he had better taste than to drag in any private matter. The postages from the letter to which he intended to refer had reference to a matter of public interest, and in which the farmers should feel deeply) interested The writer quoted the following telegram from A le tons - Melbourne, October 2 The Australian edna tion Bill has been passed by the "\ tetanus I effte In the Assembly) - to Bryan O'Loghlen s Binerdinent excluding New Zealand from the federation, was adopted And the writer went on - Win is this thus? Olcoursolhave not seen the debaters to date I am therefore totally ignorant of the arguments adduced which induced the House to come to such a determination but in the absence of them it appears to me to suggest mistake fireman her rightly New Zealand has never asked or shown an) anxiety) to be included in the federation then why should our Parliament go out of its was to adopt a course which I fear, can only result in the creation of bitter feelings of antagonism between New Zealand and Victoria. Mr BAILES - Hunt is the farmers friend (Laughter) Mr W T CARTER - it would have been quite time enough to exclude Ivess Zealand when it has sought to be Included in the federation and that occasion urn) never arise I am afraid the I cut) action of our Parliament - (Cries of "Oh ) "may very seriously interfere with the consummation of the important question of federation I hope not But there is one thing perfectly) certain we shall get the well deserved From orbeing exceeding,!) selfish, and run the risk of becoming the laughing stock of the other colonies I cannot understand how a majority could be found in the Victorian Pat ha ment to sanction street an amendment 1 out in this as in all other matters the majority must rule Mr G D CARI EH- That is a very good letter (Laughter ) Mr YYr 1 CARTER took the opportunity of further remarking that he deeply regretted the coward fear and the panic that was being expressed because certain free citizens chose to advocate certain political reforms in a constitutional manner (Hear, hear.) It was more than ever necessary to urge upon some of the members in that House, and upon a certain class in the country, that they should show more confidence in the judgment and good sense of the people Mr TRENWITH said he felt like the ghost of Hamlets father, very much more in sorrow than in anger at the conduct of the hon member for Melbourne in revealing a private correspondence (Laughter) He was never so sorry) in his life for any one Mr G D CARI LU- Go on I like it Hallelujah (Laughter ) Mr. TRENOWETH -The hon. member for Mandurang had said he was glad that the struggle for existence was not so keen here its in some other parts of the world The hon. member could have had very little personal experience of struggling (Laughter ) The hon. member for Collingwood (Mr Hancock and himself had a much greater experience of struggling Mr HIGHETT - Your difficulty has been to live without working (Loud laughter) Mr TRENWIUl-The difficulty of the hon. member for Mandurang was to show that he was capable of doing any real ve York (Laughter ) Mr M'COLL -You are mistaken He has worked very hard Mr TRENWITH The hon. member for Collingwood and himself had seen those with whom they were associated continually on the verge of star ation Mr G D CARIER-You have gotten fat on it (Laughter ) Mr. TRENWITH - And they had felt it necessary to do something to stem this evil tide (Laughter) The trades unions had endeavoured b) combination to distribute the world's labours better over wits world s shoulders 'The hon member for Melbourne himself admitted that the trades unions had improved the position of the workers of this country Mr G D CARTER That is the old unionism Mr 'IREVYYITir-The working classes were advised that the) reaped these benefits theyoughttobe ready tocontnbutetothetuxes Let them contribute something to the maintenance of the advantages won for them There was sure!) no very heinous crime in calling upon them to do that, This he would remind hon members, was the first occasion since he had been in the House that he had referred to the Tradeshall or trade societies Time after time he had sat and listened in silence to the mane, puerile, and cowardly) attacks made upon trades unions and unionists Mr DERHAM rose to a point of order Was the hon member justified in making such a general charge against members ' The SPEAKER -the hon member is not in order Mr 1 HENrY THE would withdraw the word cow yard) He desired at all times to be paris mentary, but felt that some of the remarks made about himself by name and b) innuendo had not been very gracious In conclusion he would only say that there must be a poor case for the dual a etc if it had to be main- sullied by such arguments as they had heard that evening The motion was negatived CONSTITUTION ACT AMENDMENT HILL The consideration of the Constitution Act Amendment Bill in committee vi us resumed upon clause 4, as follows - Notwithstanding anything in any not contained it shall

was carried, to mocha) to some extent at the proposals contained in the amendment YY'hnt he in tended to affirm was the principle that property should be recognised in voting for members of that

au ( orderly manner Mr L L SMITH said that the amendment which he had laid on the table was one of the most advanced liberal measures that had ( t cr been Every lead into the House It had been of late that it was a conservative measure but he was a one of the oldest liberals in the House an 1 it was not likely that he would bring forward a long rative measure The I ill brought in by the Government provided for one man one vote and his amendment said that every man in the colony should have one vote It went further however and provided that every man who by his thrift in Insure perseverance, and skill had been enabled to pinch w even the smallest allotment of land should hiiveasecondvote The amendment went on to piovilethnttlie factor among bears rate pay er should entitle him to a vote equally with the man of great possessions J very person w our line two votes except those men who by their idleness drunkenness and want of thrift had not been able to place themselves in the position of renting ratable tanneries It had been said by hon members who had spoken on the measure that all men were equal Were the set and the drunkard equal to the hon. member for Portland who spoke so ably against the amendment of to the hon. member for Williamstown who also spoke c against if there was not another country in these or] 1 Trance except., where the people had so many possessions as they had in this colony Mr MAY ONe That is not true They are as well off in Prussia, Austria, and Germany Mr L L SMITH -How could Russia be compared with this colony ' Mr HARPER When doctors differ who shall decide ' (Laughter ) Mr L L SMITH said that the waiting men in this colony are in a better position than they were in any country in the world if a man was so improvident that he could not even be on the ratepayers roll if he was a set of drunkard or an idle, he had no right to a vote and yet he was not deprived of it but was offered an inducement to be thrifty and so obtain the second vote Hon members who spoke against the amendment tried to delude the outside public into be hey mg that it was proposed to give two votes to property and only one to the working classes He clear explanation which he had given should do away with that impression Manhood suffrage was undoubtedly abused Ratepayers of Ballarat who were working the mines at Creswick took out electors rights for Creswick and voted at both places It was said that the clause in the bill was required to counteract the votes of the Melbourne Club All that it as necessary was to put a short clause in the bill stating that the cb line in only should be allowed to vote for such institutions and that difficulty would be at once got over Any president in in in the community could easily acquire two votes and those who had only one after a time would for the most part be the improvident and unthrifty The thrifty in industrious working men would be in favour of the amendment The hon. member for Essendon had spoken the other night about America but would any hon. member like to see the political institutions of America introduced here The rings Mr HANCOCK-Wc have them now Mr L L SMITH-Where' Mr HANCOCK The coal rings Mr L L SMirn-lhose were not political institutions or rings in America a working men dared not vote as he pleased six Then he (Mr L L Smith) was in America a bare keeper was pointed out to him and he was informed that that man could return whatever candidate he pleased Mr n IN COCK-They were stuffing you (Laughter ) Mr. L L SMI I II-A candidate in America who desired to be elected had to go to the ' boss us he was called, and it he was willing to pay high enough the "boss would go to him, and he would be elected In America they did not allow foreigners anarchists and communists

this that a man should refer to quack doctors I am a legally qualified medical man, and he tries by a side wind to injure me The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -The expression was not used in debate, and the hon. member must not listen to interruptions of that kind I did not hear it Mr L L SMI1H-Sir, I bow to your ruling, but when a member deliberately in suits me intentionally, may I not call attention to it' The DEPOT Y CHAIRMAN did not hear the interruption but if it was made it was grossly disorderly Do I understand that the hon. member complains of the observation If so I call upon the hon. member who made it to withdraw it as mediate!) Mr HVNCOCK-The interjection was simply made for this reason, that I consider The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -I must ask the hon member to withdraw it Mr HANCOCK -I did not allude to the doctor as a quack doctor I can sufficiently well aware that he is a thoroughly and legally qualified medical man I sincerely hope he will not consider the allusion disrespect ful to himself Mr MALONEY said he was sure the words were not thrown out in the sense in which they were taken up The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -I must ask the hon. member not to rise to a question when he knows he is out of order (Laughter ) Mr. L L SMITH thanked the hon. member for Collingwood forth frank manner in which he had withdrawn the remark It would be cowardly on the part of the Chamber to send a measure of this kind a second time to another place with the idea of getting rid of all arms in connection with it ("Hear, hear, and laughter ) The gentlemen who would sit down when the division took place would show to the country their manhood and their courage and they would go before the electors with the thorough knowledge that they were not afraid of an) bogey, and that they had done what they knew in their hearts was their duty (Cheers ) So far as he is unconcerned he never cared so long as he was doing what was relic what the consequences might be 'That was not the last time that he had sion capital and property throats ne in the colony and he even! 1 be no win's prepared to take the same stand in the matter Capital was a very timid thing Jin position of matters find biPii such in the past that at one time it was impossible to sell a piece of land (Hear hear ).

most liberal that had I ever been brought before the House as it was to encourage thrift MR AND] ARSON stated that if the bill had appeared in the present form when it was introduced into the chamber

representatives had allied themselves with the amendment (Hear hear) Ilevvas sure that their desire was to promote the welfare of their constituents but he thought he could show that if they succeeded in carrying the amendment it could only result in bringing not only discredit but very probably disaster to the interests the) desired to conserve Before proceeding to that point however he would like to refer to one or two rental Its that were made the other evening He regretted that the hon. member for Melbourne was not present but he would not say any thing to which exception could be stolen The hon member accused him of incon- sisters) in supporting the abolition of plural voting because us the hon. member said he (Mr McLean) had shaw s been a consistent supporter of the rights of property) He trusted he always had been a consistent supporter of the rights of property and of the legitimate rights of ever) clos3ofthe community The whole of the moderate savings of his life were in este I in property in to town and if he were to abandon the rights of property he would prove false to his own in terests and those of his family He considered that property was entitled to repre sentation in another chamber Property had that representation in that chamber and also in the municipal councils and there surely ought to be some chamber which ever) per son in the community who had not disqualified himself by misbehaviour could stand on equality) with the rest of the members of the community The hon. member who moved this amendment told them that his object in doing so was to encourage thrift intelligence and energy) The hon member said that these were qualities that should be represented in Parliament No one would deny that these were admirable qualities and that they should have justice done to them but how did the hon. member seek to secure representation for the owners of property because it was the owners of property the hon. member was referring to' P) giving two votes not to the owners of property but to the tenants (Ministerial cheers ) Under the hon. member's amendment it would be possible for a man to own the whole of Collins street and have only one vote viz the manhood suffrage vote whilst every person who rented a fruit shop or an oyster shop from him would be entitled to two votes (Hear hear) He would read some figures that would dispel the hon. members illusions the total number of rates ers on the present rolls of this colony wives 21'.) 107 and of non ratepayers or those on the man hood suffrage roll there were only 14 747 The total number of freeholders, as nearly as he could ascertain-the figures were not absolutely correct-was 117 000 there was no possible means of ascertaining the exact number of those who were living, on their own holdings but hon members would admit that it was a very liberal allowance to put the number down as at 80,000 out of the 117 000 That was 80,000 owners who would be entitled to two votes, while of the tenants there would be 141107 That was a majority of tenants of 6107 over occupjnigouners If two votes each were given to the occupy in,, our ears it would make a total of lbO 000 votes

of 218 214, votes to the plants, and, deducting from this the other two classes of voters lift a majority for the tenants over all others of 103 407 votes (Ministerial ever in He would give every man one vote one freeholder should have one vote, and one Chinaman should have one vote He would not refuse to any person the same privileges that he claimed for himself (Hear, hear.) He wished now to draw attention to the effect this amendment would have on the farmers He had already) pointed out that in the whole colony. there were 221107 ratepayers on the electoral roll of that number there were in Melbourne and suburbs (III 71st ratepayers on the roll and including Ballarat Sandhurst and Geelong und these constituencies always went with Melbourne when questions affecting the farmers were under considers tion the number of ratepayers was 111 154 and in the whole of the rest of the colony there were only 114 Jbt íatepioeruoiilheioll Giving two votes each to the ratepayers in Melbourne, Biitluint Sandhurst and Geelong would make a total of 432 398 votes and giving two votes each to the 112 impute payers in the rest of the colony made SS 90ft votes thus placing the rest of the colony as against Melbourne and the other cities named, in a minority) of 6 102 votes Then if the) computed the electors on the manhood suffrage roll in the metropolitan districts with those on the roll in the rest of the colony the metropolitan district had a majority of b Gio Adding these two majorities together gave a total majority to the metropolitan districts of 15,017 Then he would remind hon. members that under the system of plural voting these compact centres of population exercised an influence on the whole of the electorates within a radius of 15 or 20 miles In every) electorate in the colon) local opinion was divided and it would therefore be seen that the unfortunate farmer under this proposal would be in a hopeless minority) who were leading hon. members in this direction Was it not those who had ever been the latter and uncompromising enemies of the farmers who while conceding protectionist duties to their own constituents refused them to the farmers who compelled the farmers in the past to be) in a high protective market and to sell all their products in a free trade market? He hoped his friends would not lend themselves to any such unfair and discreditable tactics (Hear, hear.) Mr. 1ÎU1T1 RLY. thought this subject had been debated long enough He heard the hon. member for Mornington mention the name of Sir William Clarke He w asked that all present would take example from that gentleman, and if they did they would be more like friends of the farmers than they were present Sir William Clarke was a man we ought to be proud to have amongst us and if all owners of land treated their tenants as will as that gentleman did it would be a good thing, for the community Welland a line country here, and those who were huge owners of property should try and develop tliercsouices of the country so as to most the pool as well as the nell In stead of doing that they were too offenders posed to get the pot r men are this power so that the unfit leap the results of the labour of these men So far us the Trades hall was concerned, he did not know anything about it hear hear-but he thought that the representatives of the 1 india hull in that House ought to be treated with proper respect He gave those members credit for sticking up for their opinions and no credit was due to the other side for attacking two hon members in the way that had been done ItwnsBaulthat the country would be in great danger if the proposal to adopt the one man one vote principle were carried but he saw no cause for fear in that direction too much respect was in I lo wealth (Hear, hear.) It would be a girl idea if a new order of distinction were established in Y Victoria and of every man of property were to be labelled with a leather medal stating how much he was worth (Laughter ) People could then pay the respect that was said to be due to property It was said that the man who had property was better fitted to exercise a vote than the man who had no pro] city He was himself to sw against in the early days and he was as good a man then its he was now (Ebor near ) Before coming to Australia he spent some time in the United States of America there were many wealthy men in the United States and it Vanderbilt only exercised the same -voting power as the poorest citizen Working men should be treated with greater respect than they were in this country When he was in America the treatment he received was that of man to man Ilevvas quite satisfied have only one vote and to trust to his fell in electors He had not want his opens its t urge loutit they were not right for at tin in his life time he had thought he was right and a term in Is found ( it that he was in it..
