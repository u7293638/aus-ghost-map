UNLEY STREET LIGHTING. In The Advertiser of April 6 it is reported that at a meeting of the Unley Town Council on Monday evening one of the councillors stated that "there was not the ghost of a chance of getting any satisfactory system of lighting from the Gas Company." The only reason for dissatisfaction that the Gas Company know of is that they have been unable to comply with certain re- quests of the Unley council to lay long lengths of unproductive pipes. In a letter sent to the town clerk, Unley, Mr. Evans re- minded that officer that the Gas Company have laid many long lengths of pipe to supply gas to lamps at Unley, and only in extreme cases have the Gas Company been unwilling to extend the mains. The Gas Company have no contract with the Unley Council for supply of gas, and it would be unwise for the Gas Company to go to consider- abler expense in laying pipes unless the council will agree to use gas for a stated term. One of the requisitions of the council was for gas to be supplied to three lamps in Castle-street which would have in- volved an outlay of about £200. For two lamps in Thomas- street £140 would have to be spent in pipes and labor, and for one lamp in Park-street, £80.
