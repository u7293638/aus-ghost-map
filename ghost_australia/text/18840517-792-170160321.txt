THE SHIP IN WHICH CAREY WAS SHOT. The unlucky Kilfauns Castle (says the Irishman). being uuable to wash the bad blood of James Carey out of the oabin floor, bad to give up the South African trade, and sell herself to a foreign power. No one would touoh her; not a soul would risk its worldly existenoe in her unhallowed charge. The ghost of Carey, and. Heaven only knows how many other ghosts in his company, would not give them a moment's rest in their bunks, if they did not sink the Castle in the depths of the sea. Stainsd with Carey's blood, the Kilfauns was s haunted ship, which the hardiest and' daringest would not inhabit for one weird hour of the night. The denouement of the tragic story is as strange as anything in truth or fiction. The Kilfauns has been bought by the Russian Government; her name is changed, and her new title is concealed until she is away among the Russians, who know her not. Sailors are more superstitious than landlubbers, and if the Russian marines oome to know the lass they are sailing in, they would rather scuttle her than run her for a voyage.'
