The Fakir of Qoh. St. George's Hall last night was reason ably full, but not inconveniently crowded, except in the bacft seats and gallery, and it was a pity that thft fantenils W6M not re- uuceu m space, ana tne oneaper portions of tho auditorium enlarged thereby. Dr Sil vester was as successful ns ever with his various illusions ; but it is a pity that he does not tnke the stage himself n little more. Tho ghoBt is a wonderful hallucination, but we might suggest to Air Lewis, upon whom the weight of introducing it rests, the utter absurdity of repeating portions of a not very well written dialogue about twenty times, _ Apart from that drawback, the ghost_ illusion iB a wonderful and startling exhibition, andBhould be seen by everybody. No attempt to describe the fountain, as improved by the Fakir, could be successful. By means of revolving jets the Bprnyg are thrown in such lovely forms that lit with the lime-light tho effect is positively be wildering. The aerial suspension of tho pleasant little lady, Miss Daisy Silvester, was as surprising and pleasing as ever, and the whole entertainment is nminsntl nÂ»n worth patronage.
