' I was young and very enthusiastic in those days. Rather vain, too, and disposed to look down upon what I called the "oldfogies of the profession." I meant to make great discoveries in medicine for the benefit of suffering humanity, and for my own benefit too, I'm afraid. Consequently—I confess it I -was a dangerous kind of doctor, and always itching to try experiments. ' At.the time of which I am speak-, ing, I was mad upon a new remedy which I believed I had discovered fat the nervous state consequent upon the failure of the digestive powers in people of middle age; and it was upon this remedy that I now sat down to think in my little consulting-room and dispensary combined. 1 had .been pondering ovei' the subject then for months, and the more I thought the more convinced I was that my remedy would work wonders, but for want of test cases I was completely in the dark. I had got so far, though, that I had given myself full confidence in the correctness of my. deductions ; ail I wanted was trial— experiment on the vile.body of man, so as to make sure. " How to proceed ? " I said to myself, as I sat amongst my bottles and drugs, tapping the table with my finger nails—" how to proceed ? I must try it upon a patient, but it is not fair or just to try experiments upon one who confides in you. Suppose my ideas are wrong—suppose it is a fallacy ?" These thoughts troubled me so that , I grew feverish, and myliead burned. Jumping up from my chair, I took a clean tumbler from a shelf, half •filled it from a seltzogene wliicli stood on the table, tossed off tbesparldmg water, put back the tumbler'and resumed my seat, feeling decidedly better aiid clearer. " How to proceed ? " I said again, "I cannot, I must not try it upon a patient., Tit would not be just Upon whom, then ? Mary ! " ''• : -'"-'Perish : ' ; Hi1iB ,,y 'thought!" I cried dramatically. " To deceiye her would be ten times worse." "But I might tell her first. She would take it—bless her !— i if I told her." " " No—no—no—no ! " I cried; and then, half aloud, " If the . experiment must be tried, and you liavo so much faith in it, try it upon yourself; like a man!" I sprang up once niore with all kinds of unpleasant, notions beginning to haunt me. . Supposethedosefailed— suppose- ,it proved fatal—suppose I were suddenly called away without having time to explain to a brother medical man what I had taken. .''.Why, they would .bring it m suicide, and my wife would be a widow," I exclaimed with a chill of horror seemilig to make my blood ran sluggishly through my veins. But this was-momentary.- I recovered my strength of mmd directly, and, unlocking "my desk, I took out a bottle containing a white powder, which I shook and held' up to the light. " I'll try one drachm first," I said: " Too much; No : it would be absurd to- -trifle with it. How can I get » satisfactory result-if I do not proceed boldly with my test? Am I going: to play the coward after, all ? " : I went to the -.shelf ,, were the •hottles stood, and took down the one labelled Sp.

Did I say haunted ?" he cried uneasily. " Oh, no : a mere fancy," and he laughed unpleasantly. " Of course," I said.

He started violently, and grasped the elbows of-the chair, as he leaned forward, gazing wildly :in.my, face. " Drink ! " he gasped ; you think I drink—am I a drunkard ? " " I know you drink, sir," I replied quietly. " It is plainly written in your face, ana m your trembling bands. I do not say you are a drunkard. Possibly you are never drunk, but yon are constantly flying to stimulants, and they are wrecking you hopelessly." "Don't say hopelessly, doctor," he panted.

I started up, rang the bell, and hurlied-to-the door, ;ready to open it as soon as I heard steps, and then, with ; it held ajar, I said hastily: .. " I am out to everybody,: and am not to be interrupted on, any pretence until I ring." Then, closing and bolting the door) I hurried back'tb my seat. " AYhat—what's the matter, doctor ?
