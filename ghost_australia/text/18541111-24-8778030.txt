CLARI. Nigh the solemn, night the starry, < Along the old trees old and Harry ; By the sea shore and the ships, "Neath the stars I sat with Clara ; ' Her silken bodice was unlaced. My area was trembling round her waist, I plucked the joys upon her lips I Joys that plucked skill grow again I Canst thou say the same, old Sight? Hall thy life is vain. Night the solemn, night the starry, Oh, that death would let me carry Like a dew drop on a flower, Ever on those lips of Clara 1 Our beings mellow then they fall, Like o'er ripe peaches- from the wall ; We ripen, drop, and all is o'er; On the cold grave weeps the rain ; I never should be so, old Night, Ah 1 my tears are vain. Night the solemn, 'night the starry, Say alas 1 that years should harry Cross from life, and joy from ups, Love lustre from the eyes of Clare I Moon I that walkest the blue deep, Like naked maiden in her sleep Staff whose pallid splendour dip In the ghost waves of the main. Oh, ye hear me not 1 Old Night, My tears and cries are vain. (The Life-drama ; Alex. Smith.)
