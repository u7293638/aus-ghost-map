M31ElSS1S. MOODY AND SANKEY. (FRoSt TIIE SATUIIDAY REVIEW.) It appears that for someo mouths past excitement lhas been produced in Edinburgh and other towns in Scotland by tbo singular exercises of a couple of itinerant Amuericans-Mr* Moody nod 31r Sankey. For a veory long time no entertai:neit has been so popular in Edinbargh as that which goes by the name of these gentlemen. It is attended by overflowing audiences. Urowds of enthusiusts follow the per funners from one place to another, for it is part of their :tfstetn to have a miuch variety as possible, and to hqld tlheir meetings in all sorts of different ,buildings-in town-Blalli, .lectures rooms. and clhurches of all denoini tnations. The meetings are held at all hours of thIe lday, and somo are for young uweu, sote for mothers, some for fathers, others for yoiung wotmen, clerks, ctudents, or little children. Curioaity is stimulated by hugeo placards on tthe walls, and several j periodical, commuiand a large sale by dlescribing the perfortmances. The tnt tore of the exhibiti'm is stated in the following ainUoutcement :-" At half-past six p.m., Mr M0oody will preach the (iGuspel, attd Mr Sankey will sing the Gospel." Mir Mloudy and Mt Saukey are Amiericans frott Chlicago; aitd. we learn from. one of their groans that their visit to Scotland was prompted by a feeling tlhat the churches there stood " specially in need of the application of those brisker, livelier, more direct modes of apieal which are characteristic of Amterica." Mr Moody, we are further told, is " not a main of much education or culture; his mannaer is abrupt and -blunt;.. his speech bristles with Americanisms; his voice' is sharp, i rapid, and colloquial." He is remark able for his 'want of sarnctimoniousness; and " a play of humor sports out I sometimes it his'most serious addresses." I He interlards his lectures with droll or wonderful stories, or, as as the writer puts it, " Ite has itt his possession a large number of iinci deuts and experiences well fitted to throw light on the points he employs them to elucidate, and, to clinch the appetals which hIe uses them to enforce." In the intervals of Mr Moody's lectures, Mr Santkey sings hymnns. " Abborring the notion of providing a utusical eutertainment merely to please those who are not in the Kingdom of God;" Ite seeks to move " by truth expressed in the moust winning tunes." It is also itt subservience to his spiritual ends that Mr Sankey uses the harmotniumn, Sattkey's "Sacred Solos" ttre sold by the thousaund, and his example and ex- 1 hortations are also said to have given a great impulse to the trade in bar moniuns. Tlhe sort of entertaitnent which is thus preseinted may. be gathered from the descriptions given by persons who profess to have enijoyed it. " We are having a very good time just now," writes- otne; "old Formality got his neck broken." " On Friday tight," says another," after Mr Moody's solemn words, there seemted to be a great smashing up of souls." The audience is alternately utoved to laughter and tears. The Gospel is preached, not only with the pronunciation, but in tihe dialect of Clhicago; and the result is, no doubt, something very different front that to which Scotch ctngreiations are accus tomed. Jokes, slang, stories, arid sensational exclamations are freely interspersed. AIr Moodie's strange accents artd "sports of humior" worlk up the people into a state of excitement in which it is'as easy to cry as to laugh. A parable trantslated intto the language of Artemus Ward, and enlivened by touches of' Yankee wit, is a novel seet sation, and the effect is enthaceed by a sudden change of startling threats of damnation, and appeals to come and be saved. Then comes Sankey's lively solos, sung in a very good style to a melody that miglht pass for secular in a wordly concert room, but for the wourds. People who go only to be aniused, as most of the audience go, are iprovided wvith a curious and racy entertainment, quite as good in its way as the Christy Minstrels. Others of an imepies ible temperament are thrown itto tu ore or less vilettt pitroxysms of hysterical emotiont.

"' ou can't have too muich blood," is Moody's mot:io. It it said to be too sioon to estimaate th i results of the agitation which tots been carried on by these expetirents but it is inot very diflicult to anticipate what, judging from tormer experience, th-y are ikeiy to bet It is Imnpousibte to imagine anything tmore uuwholto:ue anotil detili tating than the surt of tmorbid excitetenit and hyterical rapture which is thus cu tiva.ed, and in other casas the cone quence has invariably beau a reactioun of a deplorable kiid. In the country die tricts of Scotland revivals have osually left their mark iu an itcrcase of drunk enness and a scandalous addition to the registra- geneoa al's statistics of Ilegitimtacy. In Edinburgh the heat and freinzy have probably dolneo much harm by brinrging sacred things iuto ri.licule, Ty affl cling some feeble minds with idle ason)y, or by ovrbarlaa cing uthers with the inflatiot of self.rigbteous arrogance :arid conceit. There is not the fiiuteet trace of etducated intelligence or spiritual elevition iin Mr Moody's harangues. They are a mere gabble of texta, interspersed with gro tesque or saina tional anecdotes, and spiced with vulgar America:n slang 'the most r ratordinary feature if the agita tion it that it should be counnived ait and patrol isod by the clergy of la:iuburgi. and other townls. It is obvious that if Mloody anid Sankey are rught in their mode of preaching the Uurpel, and if the etrffect of tlhese perfonulaces is really a 'great awakening ' and the ' p >wer of the Holy Ghost in Scotland,' toe ordinary services of religion must be a melancholy farce. Everybody who has oeei in Scot land must have been struck with the severe endurance and fortitude with whiil a betch cuitgregation si out, inot only a long and dreary serimoun. hut ai series of prayers whict are the iworst sort of sermons in diogui~e; and it is not surprising that the Scotch laity etould be thunkful for a lit e relaxation. But that the mini-ters themselves shiould collie forward in this mannler to proclaim pub licly that their whole system is a failure aind waste of time is really strauge. It tiust he still more wotnleflul t, iin sup porting and rccommending Messrs Mluooy and Sankey, they do not see that they are condemning thetieelves, lither a great awakening is good for their flucks, or it is not. If it is, why do they lot take measures to bring it about in their own account I The only juttticationi which is uffere i for thle eccelrictices tInd Ibufloi neri' a of the YaLkee propagautda is simply that toe end justtries the neanis, and- that the great thing is to produce na iuprts aiun on thle public mind, nto mntter bow. It would 'ppear, thcrefore, that sermonas bad better be abandoned for siging anrid story-telling, and there is ito logical c soin liy 111the reforit should stop Ihere. The banjo and the iottes might le sulbstituted for the hiarnionmiuru, and Mr Satikey's solo' mii;ht be occasionally varied by a little danciing. The Fantee Flipflag Faldaligo would Ihe an appro priate .accompanaiment to Mr Mloody's " spurts of hlimar' Ulnd select tniecdotes. It in to be uttderstood that it is the busiuess of Christian Churches to cott pete, as the Briiskl Â£vanwelsf holds, with ** the theatre, the opera, utid pltntomitice,"' why is the competition tlit to t11ese American gentletnen? It is stated that ylemsrs 10oudy atod Saukey timoy shortly ie expected in Loudot; but they iill terhapi dizcover that their line of busi ness ltias already been pretry tell worked at ttie Tabernacle and elarwitere.
