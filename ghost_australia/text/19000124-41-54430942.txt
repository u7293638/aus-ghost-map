A BUSHMAN ON BUSHMEN. To the Editor. Sir— I'm a bushman— a real bu.*!iman— one who has had more experience than any man that ever lived or ever will live; and w'nat 1 want is to be nut at the hend of tins Bushmen s - 'oit-.s. I prc a bit mad on Saturday when 1 saw iu the paper that I had a rival, who claimed to be the great evt bushman. How he dec* pis! IXes he want to pick a team of hi? own and run the show hissclf with the help of a man in gaol, who proved ae was a good bushman by wiping his face on his horse's toil. Fancy a busiinian bring that particular! Why, when 1 and Tommy Walker and Weary Willy were in the back blocks, we never wiped our fates for nine years. Wipe his face, indeed! We want no such blessed dandies for the Transvaal! My great ambition is not only to pick my band of men, but to lead them, and, by Great Caesar's Ghost, 1 reckon I'd bust up all the Boers in about three weeks. But no taking orders from Bullers, or Kitcheners, or Uo berUcc, or such small fry as that. I should just do things my way. If after raiding this letter the Government should— as, uo doubt, they will— send for me to form a company of buhmeu, I shall not need to visit Central Australia, or even tho gaols; in fact, I shall not have to go further than the list of those who have already' volun teered. Among them are some of the grandest, hardest, ar.d most experienced bushmen in this or any ut'acr country, anil no nr.liler company ha.- over steppe J into the held than will' be picked from them. 1 am, Sir, An:.
