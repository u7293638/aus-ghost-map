* ECHOES'OP MELBOURNE' - Y'Vr.S '?PBYTH]i!.GHOSTin .--???.??- -/?-, Thef| interest 'in ^,th'e.. /Parliamentary : pro-: ceeHinsts' of the ''Week,' lids centered in tKe Council, when the Irrigation Bill came up for its second reading. While one set of politicians feared another hoped that the measure 'would bo rejected 'by the Upper' House, and the Government robbed;of:. their best trump card. Hopes and fears mav now. however, be sot at rest for n. time, for although the measure was sub ? niitted' to' a'f air sh are'of -keen- and' e ven-hos;' 'tile oriticism,Jt.is obvious that the .second, ?reading will' bV carried,, an'd .'although' ,it ?-yill assuredly be much a'tered, in', its pasr 'sage | through' committee, and' 'shorn of' 'inucn of its greatness, (ho alterations will ?tlirnjout to be improvements, and will1 riot commit the colony to the ' enormous expenditure which ? 'Mr.'- ' Deakiri's jdoasj of an irregular Bcheme^-would 'fain I have saddled the country with. -The (motion for shelving the measure re ceived but scant support, Mr. Dowling,; jyhojin deference tn the rosolutionjpassedi Tat a Jargo meeting in rBallarat; [moved; that .'the bill be read that aaysix'imonths, fail jng |to find.-a .-seconder 'to his motion. IVVhdther with the' imp'^irtant amendments 3vhidh will undoubtedly bo made in the ..mea.dure.-it. ..w.ilLprove acceptable . to_the. Assembly on its return to that Chamber remains, however, to be seen. Honourable members who favour a large expenditure, as well as those whose constituents do not share in the advantages of. the' scheme as being outside the irrigation areas;' inay be strong enougli'with their united forces to cause the loss of the bill. In this c-iee the fate of Mr. Gilliea as a Minister and per haps as a politician would 'be sealed. 'It is '? well known that .the election of the Pre mier for Rodney was solely due to the fact of his being able tp'.prom'ise' water to'tb'e settlers in' the''n'6rtn'erh' areas';Aand sh'ouid' the constituency be disappointed, there is but ? small ?? chance of the head of the Government being again returned by any constituency, his supercilious manner, and heglect'of local wants, rendoring himjj personally unpopular.
