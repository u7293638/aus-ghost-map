RACING IN VICTORIA. VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. fBv TeleeraDh. I [From our own Reporter.] Melbourne. February 14, The meeting at Caulfield on Saturday was successful in every way. The weather was fine, and the attendance nearly equal to the Guineas day, while the racing was quite worthy of Flemington. No less than sixteen numbers were hoisted for the Hurdle Race, but the strength of the field did not prevent backers taking very short price about Vanderbilt, who was supposed to be a good thing. Royal Maid was most in demand of the others, and she looked all over a winner entering the straight, but in the run home she tired under the weight, and after a desperate finish Vanderbilt pulleid his backers through by a bare head. Aglaos was the first backed for the Criterion Stakes, but before they went ont there was such a rush on Master ■ John that he left off a hot favourite at 6 to 4. The Nun waB quickest on her legs, and getting a little the best .of the luck all the way, she won cleverly from Mistrail, Master John was very unlucky, the boy who rode him trying to get up on the inBide and getting jammed on the rails. Twenty-three weighed out for the Oakleigh Handicap, and The Israelite was at once enstalled favourite, while Breeze, Silver Mine, and Xantippe were all well backed. They were some time at the post, but eventually the word was f'ven to a very fair start. Delamia and reeze were the moBt prominent to the turn, The Israelite and Silver Mine following them, and as they swept into the straight the last-named pair looked like fighting it out, but directly they were fairly in a run for • home William Tell cut the leaders down in the most hollow style, and striding away he won easily by nearly two lengths. The Israelite finished very strongly, and got ■ second place, but William Tell won so easily that he was at once installed first favourite for the Newmarket Handicap. The winner is a country horse, hut he is leased to Messrs. Miller, ana ran in their colours. The time was very fast, and the result proved that the Lockleys party had every reason to think they had a good thing in The Israelite. The Steeplechase was a chapter of accidents, six of the horses falling, and in the end Studley had no difficulty in bearing the ancient Euchre. Some smart platers were in the Selling Race, but Goldtop scored very easily at the finish. Although Duration went very short in his preliminary, he was backed down to 5 to 2 for the HawkeBburn Handicap. The lightweights made the pace a cracker all the way, and Duration could never get neat the front, but Lesbia, Gipsy's Warning, and Ringmaster made a desperate race of it, and sheer gamenesB enabled Mr. Wilson'B colt to win by a short neck. In the evening William Tell was heavily backed for the Newmarket Handicap, and Duration was driven to 100 -to 6 for the Australian Cup.

Delamia held command from Breeze round the turn, with The Israelite third, and then William Tell and Silvermine; but directly they landed in the straight William Tell shot to the front and took a clear lead. The Israelite under the whip left the others, but he could never catch the leader, who won cleverly by nearly two lengths.
