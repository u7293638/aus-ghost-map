TALE OF A TAIL. (Vide. Cartoon .) Sir Henry, how modest thou'rt suddenly grown ; i Thy speech on the Flag-ship we really must own ! Was a model of all that is modest and chaste, | Though perhaps not exactly in perfect good taste. j Our power of guessing most utterly fails To solve whv our bonnv and fair New Ront.b Wales Should be called a poor, struggling colony, fie ! There's a blush on our cheek and a tear in our eye. Sir Henry, we knew that thou never wert shy ; But we never imagined thoud'st dare to imply, Without e'en the ghost of a blush on thy face, That dear Wales could be ever the last in a race. Is this, then, thy boasted belief in Free Trade, Or hast thou gone back to a former decade ; To a time when the moloch Protection itself, Was worshipped by thee— thou most changeable elf ? We thought thine adieus to Protection were made, And thy vows all poured forth at the shrine of Free Trade ; We never once dreaded this worst of mishaps — That thou would'st, Sir Henry, sustain a relapse. Punch never opined, when a picture he made Of thee as a jockey astride of Free Trade, That thy sudden conversion such brief while would last, Or that thou would'st look back, like Lot's wife, on the pas'. Yet, stay, ca'n Sir Henry have been but in jest, Can the spirit of satire have entered his breast, Was he merely, in fanciful spirit so free, Taking what's called a " rise " out of friend Graham B. ? As to this, Mr. Punch can't with certainty speak, But he hopes that his friends will admire this week The portrait " our special " has struggled to shape Of Sir Henry himself, as an anthropoid ape, Laying hold of the tail of his friend Graham B. (An ape still more utterly hideous than he) ; Let us hope that our friends will admire the pair, And Sir H. of the moral be fully aware. If this double result should be happily achieved, Mr. Punch will be glad, though excessively grieved, That ever he should thus reluctantly be Compelled to unite Henry Parkes and G. B.
