SELECTED POETRY. FAITH AND DBSPATR, There is a forest dark and drear Where thenight wind, disconsolate," Does sigh among the oak leaves sere In eeiie prophesy of fate. The dead boughs groan and creak with painj When their dry boneB aside are swayed. Their sere leaves sing the old refraia Of life awaste and youth decayed. There range the ghosts of wasted days, 'Mid oroak-of-ravens," wailof winds; - Still on they, wend their, tortured ways, \- Nor-eaae-the torment of-their minds..- - , . . * * There is aigarden, calm and bright, ' Where all the winds of beavsn meet In zephyra soft as morning light,. : And brooks in merry laughter greet.. Clear are the .waters of.the-streams, < And cool the shades of leafy 'bowara, The blrdei eirig out their waking1 dreams, The air ia sweet with.Bcent of flowers. There re?t the SOUIB of rich and poor, " The king, the peasant, and the pope; Wide open always stands the dooe; ' The only passport-Faith and Hope.
