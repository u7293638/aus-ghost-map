Since i I had cursed them in the strongest \ kind of language, they were rather reserved in their actions toward us ; but I supposed they would break out again, and they did. They set fire to the window-curtain in the pantry and .stuck pins into all parts of Esther's person. They moved the trap-door which opened into the loft under^the roof, and we, Teaing AaTHernj'"' would start a fis%|kept waftr weMintsi all day.

Once I wanted a match to light roy pipi, and it occuned to me to ask the ghosts, who always seemed to have abun dance of them, to give me some. " Bob, I would like a few matches, if ybu please," I said. Instantly matches fell from the air, near the ceiling, After that I was literally showered with matches; the ghost Maggie, gave me forty-five, during one [day, and on another occasion, forty-nine. |" I wish to state most emphatically, that I could tell the difference in the knocks [ fluide by each ghost just as well as if "they had spoken. The knocks made by Maggie were delicate and soft in sound, as if made by a woman's hand, while those made by Bob Nickle were loud and strong, denoting great strength and evidently large hands. When he knocked with those terrible-sledge hammer blows he certainly roust have used a large rock or some other heavy object, for such S)f^^^a9^äniy^^JÜ>^te true?
