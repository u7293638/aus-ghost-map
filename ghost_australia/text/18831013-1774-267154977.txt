'Flie sound was, at tiist, a low inoan jnp, and Hrvan whisjleretl softly to himself— “ 'That’s some pom- wanderin' spirit anyhow ! There’s heavy trouble on it, I’ll po bail.” All at once a soft, plaintive voiee was heard sin pi up in Irish a dit t y well known in Munster, and these were the words iri bnplish : “ I eoald wander through the streets hand’in liaud wit h my true love. J would sail the salt sea with no fortune 1ml you.

Hut did you hear that he was dead ?” She peered into Hryan’s face through the darkness, then pushing him away with a force that made him stagger, she cried with a disdainful laugh : " (Jet away with you now ! you're old, an’ lie's young—will you not be botherin’ me with vour palaver? O wisha ! I never hear hi,s voice now, at all! where is lie?—ay! that’s it —lie's at Holy Cross- —all alone by himself they tell me, an’ that's why ! want to go ! An’ 1 must go, too, and he there afore the clock strikes twelve the night —let me go now—you sec I can’t stay, at all, at all-’ ‘■(.fell ! among the green bushes he’s waiting for me !’’ Hryan had purposely kept silence, fearing lest tlm sound of an unfamiliar voice might, frighten her so that his feeble arm could not longer hold her. Hut still he kept on his way, whilst the lain fell faster and heavier each passing moment. They had now reached the cottage, at the door of u hich stood Canth, wait ing anxiously, as oil the previous night, for Hryan's appearance.

Meanwhile. Iowan had seated the miserable creature in the chimney corner, and although the lire wbia/.ing brightly, lie tlllew on some additional turf, which latter act, not being agreeable to ( 'auth, served to arouse her from lmr moment ai y st upor. “ Now. tli' ii, what did mui do that for?" she said sharply enough, considering that tile turf was u i io u os I ion ably Hryan’s own, wasn’t the I'm- good enough? one ’id think \ mi had a t m I stark hack n the house. “ Never mind.

She began to feel the comfort, and a smile overspread her wan features, as. looking down at the red drugget petticoat which Cautli had put on, she said to Pryan, who had just resumed his place at the fire : — “ There now, you see, I’m 'Petticoat Lnosel' 1 tould you so, but you wouldn’t believe me! —don’t he af'eared, ould man ! I’li not hurt ,juu ! but don’t stop me—don’t, an’ find bless von, for I’m on my way to Holy '.'mss to see him, i/oa Luoic, an I must lie back at the hill before cock- crow! 1 here, look at her!'' pointing with a giggling laugh at Cautli. who hail dropped almost tainting on a seat--" she’s af'eard of tin* ghost you see, she thinks Petticoat boose ’ll hang her— ha ! ha ha ! may bo she will —she hung me oust —that I mayn’t, sin, but she did !— an’ I’m walkin’, walkin’ ever sence, an will till the day o’ judgment.” •‘The fail'd save us” muttered Cauth, ‘■she’ll be the death o’ me this night, il I stav in the one house, with her!* Anv way, I must get the supper for them.” The supper was got accordiugly--1ea and oaten bread for Alalml. porritch and milk for lhyan, in which Cautli made a show of join ing him. but it was plain that the appetite was wanting to her. Mabel, on the contrary, swallowed her supper greedily, and w ith evi dent relish of the tea, then a luxury little common amongst country people in any part of Ireland.

We must either get her to sleep, or I must leave the house—she’d have me as mad as horse It’ before an hour.” “ Well ! I declare,” said Brvan in a whisper. “ 1 feel mighty quaro myself, listenin’ to her —do, an’ (fod bless yon ! try an’get her to bed —you can put her in mine, an’ I’ll sit up all night, for it wouldn’t be safe for us both to go to sleep ; she might burn the house on us, so she might, for I’m afeard it’s not much she’ll sleep.” With much persuasion Mabel was induced to go to bed and, once down, she slept soundly, eontrarv to the expectations of her host. After a good-natured dispute about which of them should occupy the second bed, Bryan’s firmness prevailed, and poor Cauth stretched her length on the straw pallid, not to sleep, but to rest her weary limbs.
