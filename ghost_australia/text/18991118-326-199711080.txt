An, Artful Beggar. A beggar who was sentenced to 14 days at Marylebone, by his methods would seem to have been a fisherman in his better days A constable who watched the whole proceedings saw him throw a crust cf bread into the road. He stood and waited till the fish he hoped to hook camo up. Presently a lady approached, and the beggar rushed into the road, snatched up the bread, and began to gnaw at it ravenously. The lady stopped, gazed sympathetically at the apparently hungry man, and gave him -twopence. When she had passed by the man threw tho bait into the road, with the same happy result. Then he was arrested, and his bag examined. He had on him thir teen pennies and a threepenny piece. That was a good return for a crust of bread. Every day some new method of getting money out of the charitable is hit upon. Lately a man has been going round with a placard stating that he lost his voice in trying fo save a drowning child ; while another — and. perhaps this is the most audacious statement a beggar ever made — has " been a teetotaller for 50 years, and was then run over by a brewers dray." Do naught totday thou mayst regret to morrow ; For though to-day may die, its ghost will linger And hannt thee with a ceaseless .sigh of sorrow, And point remorse with an accusing finger. Say no unkindly word, or, like. an ember In a dead fire, a breath will blow it living ; Tho .worst of punishmonta is to re member, 'When tears aro vain and wrongs are past forgiving.
