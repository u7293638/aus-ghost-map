A Reply. A week or two ago the scrub poet of the Country offiec let himself go on the subject of " Poynton and his Lambs"—necessary to state this because so few people read the Country. A "lamb" replies as follows:— Although I'm not much of a poet, I don't feel inclined to let pass Such ill-natured rant, if I know it. So I'll answer the National Ass. I'll hope that next time he's snake-headed, As Poynton won't give up the ghost, To remember he's not so be "Ned"ed As to foolishly run from his post. The Country Ass. few, Sir, believe it, No matter how loud it may bray ; And few persons now ever read it, Though sent to them gratis, they say. It may be the Editor's mad, Sir, And thinks we're demented as well } Or maybe his logic is bad, Sir, For somehow his paper don't sell» Not one of us " lambs" ever buy it, You see, Sir, we think it's too thin. The farmers all seem to decry it, So shortly the Ass. must give in. No doubt there's some few who feel white, Sir, At losing their donkey so brave. The "lambs" will but say—"Serve him right, Shy' And give three ringing cheers o'er the grave.
