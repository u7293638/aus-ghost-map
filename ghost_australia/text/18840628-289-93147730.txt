VICTORIA A.T.0. BACES. fBy4?etesnn-h.l MaI bonme. June 2 L The Victoria Amateur Turf Club held a mosti successful meeting at* CaulfiekTon Saturday. The weather was - magnificent,' the attendance- good, and the sport -first* elms. Large fields, with' one exception, were' the order of the day,- no less than 31 horses facing the starter in the Ladies' Trophy, which -was won by The bmost; vrtth Primus and Duenna -as -immediate followers. A strange coincidence is that the -Ladies' Trophy last year was won *y ?another horae also called The- Ghost; The splendid -field of 15 started for the Steeplechase, which after a most magnificent race, in whioh the jumping could not foe excelled; resulted in an exciting win by -a neck. Stampede being the victor. Fickle, who Tan Beoond in this^raoe, had just previously appropriated the Victoria Gold Cup, his -other two competitors; Black Jacket and Gelderoy,*' having' refused- to negotiate the jumps. The Hurdle Race fell to Merri, the favorite, whilst Black ©iamond easily appropriated' the Richmond Handicap from a fine field of sixteen, Primus being second, and Lyons Lady- third; After the Steeplechase, Batty j the weH-known cross country jockey, purchased Deceiver, who Tan fourth in the race, for 150 guineas.- The only unfortunate incident to a pleasurable day was an accident to Burton; the rider of Lesbia in the last^fTent on-the card, who .was seriously iBjurrf Owing to- his horse falling over Duenna- and' throwing his jockey heavily. nURDLE RACE.
