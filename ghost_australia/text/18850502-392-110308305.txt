The Girl and the Gloater. There was a masher Of great renown. Not any " flasher" Upon the town To cut a dash or To " do it bl own." His forte was smoking Of cigarettes, His whiskers stroking, And making bete; And also joking About his debts.

That spot adorning, A figure grand, On ev'rv morning He took his stand, Policemen scorning, And kissed his hand.
