Sho heard hor mother's voice in the next room, thon the veins in her throat swelled and throbbed, and great tears filled her eyes, but she forced them back, and went out among them. Fred looked anxions about her and communicated his fears that Kuth was not strong or else was overworked to Mr. Milman who said she must rido and walk out more, indeed she must accompany them on the morrow. The morning proved hot and sultry so Kuth easily excused herself and promised to rido as far as the Big Hill in the afternoon to meet them on their return home. Poor white-faced Ruth rode out in the warm afternoon, away through tho bush, not knowing, not oaring, where she went. Sho hold the rein loosely before her and gave Robin his head. Away to the right stretched adenaebelt of sorub, in front the Big Hill stood out blue in the haze of distance while all around grow green shrubs and slender saplings. Mile after milo Robin picked Mb way over fallen logs and loose timber, sometimes stopping to munoh a mouthful of grass in the scanty shade of the Bparely- foliaged saplings. She was glad to be alone. Every faoulty waB numbed with tho intense strain she had put upon horself now Bho tried to think about it. A false step of Robin caused her to jerk and almost lose her seat ; this brought hor baok to hor surroundings, and, looking about anxiously for the rendezvous, sho was startled to find that, no matter in what direction Bho looked, no hill of any kind waB to bo seen. She knew sho must be far from home, for she could seo groups of stray oattlo in tho distance who bellowed angrily jat tho sight of her. Seeing a great plain ahead sho rodo toward it. ' I will stand in the centre of it,' she said, ' then I shall bo more easily seen when they oome to look for me.' She felt no fear. Her spirit was sore, ! and her heart and conscience wero waging : fierce war. The struggle was with her,, as it ; had been with him, but she was only a girl, and she loved. What though she had heard hor mothor burse tho unknown slayer ;of hor darling— wild and wayward, there fore lovod the more— and had in her ohildish ;heart hated tho destroyer of their home, and |of her mother's health. ' Through him Archie had been out off in ilils youth, and in his sin; yet sho loved him. Sho said all this to herself standing in the oentro of the dreary flat far , away from her !homo. She did not think of her position, she 'thought only of this unnatural and ill-fated ;love of hors, and scalding tears dropped on Robin's mano. . . . : It was almost sundown when sho hoard i bmiii oooee, ana jj'rea oamo. galloping toward her. . , . . .'.. ...

And I lovo you.' , , I 'Thon if you do, you can understand. I Mako it easy for hor, Frod, she will havo I lost us both, Arohio and mo, for I will be as I loat to hor, aa though I woro doad, I know.' I ' ' Oh, Ruth !' was all ho could say, as sho . 1 roilo away swiftly out of sight in tho dusk. ' 1 Wlion sho reached tho boundary-ridor'a J houso, sho aakod to soo hor stop- father at 1 onco. Mr. Milman oame from tho siok- ? j room, shooked at hoaring Ruth was thoro. j ' Papa, you have not so much to forgivo, ' I JArphio was not your son. Liston, I lovo I Humphrey Gray; and though he novor spoke j !a word of lovo to mo, I know ho loves mo a j liltlo. Oh, papa, ho has suffered so muoh-» : and so long, let mo lighten his Buff orings ,j ;a little. If ho must die, let mo bo near him.' j ; Before ho oould reply Bho had passed him, , j and ontbred tho bedroom. A lamp burned ? ] ion tho tablo showing Humphrey Gray's white . J faoo on the pillow, with a linen bandage s round his head, and where it covered tho j jwound a red atain appeared. His arm j ? whioh lay aoross his oheBt waa bound up in j splints, as well as the .kind-hearted people j .about him know how. to do it. Mrs. Anson: 1 |sat at the foot of the bed, and roBO up j 'looking surprised, at her entranoe, but Ruth ; 1 'did not speak to her or look at her, sh# saw I only that whito face — white oven to the lips' I — andahe knelt down and looked into tho I half-open blue eyes, and spoko his name. ? '1 i Hours and hours sho knelt there, all . J her young life ebbing from hor, as sho ' 1 listened to his moans of mortal anguish, j arid, at intervals, his incoherent wanderings, j 'They woro of achool sometimes. Sometimes j !of that awful timo — that day in London and ; 'its terrible consoquenoes. ' I will givo tho ? j 'service of my lifo to tho church and my j follow-creatures, Otter. I will give my lifo for tho lifo I havo taken; but will my sacrifice be accepted ?' He repeated this so! j many timea, and his voice was so pitiful in it3 j 'intonso anguish that thoy who stood around' j — atrong men though thoy were — wept. 1 Ruth did not weop. Sho liatoned to ovory | word with pulsoloss anxiety, for she know j that soon sho would never hear hia voice j again. Sometimes ho apoko of hor.

Thon, agoing it was of tho .1 time when ho lay maimed and bruised in tho - bush after his fall. ! 'The same death. It is meet and just. jGod exacts the rigid satisfaction — death for ; death.' , ! For a few monionta before he died, coni Iseiousness came baok to him. He recogniaod Ruth and looked at her with a look of auch J 'grateful, tender lovo from thoso bluo eyes, | ark with tho shadow of pain, and dim with j ithe nearness of death, that in all her after ; lifo sho thankod God for it — for that ono i look. ? ?'? __. . .
