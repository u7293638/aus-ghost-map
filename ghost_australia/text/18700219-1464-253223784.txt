j — — - . BUCHANAN SATISFIED ! (See Cartoon.) Ghost loquitur : At last ; the written troubles of my brain Are razed ; and, freed from earthly pain, My wearied body rests beneath this sod — j But what about my spirit ? Ain't it odd I That, though " quite satisfied," all's right and fair, My soul should haunt the quiet grave yard, where i My body's life lies rounded with a sleep ? j Some vague suspicions o'er my senses creep — j (I dont know whether ghosts indeed are sensible, | But think the theory is quite defensible. ) ; Why should my soul remain unwilling here — | Smoke mortal pipes and swig terrestrial beer ? I I will not stay — but upward wing my course. I Now then ! Alas I can't — I feel a carnal force | That drags me earth-ward, and condemns me quite j To hover here and fret my soul with spite ! j This is my doom — though nicely dead and buried | My spirit cannot yet o'er Styx be ferried ; For till this spiteful world forgets my shame, j Old Charon will not recognise my claim !
