Minmi Jockey Club Races. The following weights were declared last evening by the handicapper, Mr. W. C. Quinton, for the principal events to be competed for at this meeting, which takes place on Monday next, the 2nd of January. Sportsmen would do well to remember that this little meeting will come off on the Wallsend racecourse and as very fair fields are nominated, a nice day's enjoyment may be looked for by visitors to the Maryland racecourse at the opening of the new year. We are informed that Woodlands' nomina- tion was received by the secretary, but was too late, and could not be received. Why will horse owners persist in keeping back their entrances till the last moment ? It is now quite a common occurrence for officials connected with race clubs to receive entrances the day after they have closed. Of course horse owners will grumble at the hardship of being shut out. They, however, have no one but themselves to blame for it, as a little more attention on their part to the hour for receiving entries would obviate all the difficulty attending this matter.
