SPORTING. V.A.T.C. SPRING MEETING. FIRST DAY. [By Telegraph.] Melbourne, October 11. The first day of the Spring meeting of the V.A.T.C. took place on Saturday at Caulfield, in the presence of a large number of people. The weather was very unfavorable. A steady rain commenced to fall from a few minutes before the first race, and continued almost the whole of the afternoon, rendering the coarse very heavy. There were good fields in every in- Etance,butclosefiniflheawerenottherule. Great interest was centred in the Guineas, for which Monte Christo was a strong favorite, Dunlop also being much fancied. Sir. Whitens colt, however, although looking dangerous in the straight, was never in the race, the winner turn ing up in Ringmaster, who bowled through his horses at the finish, and won by two and a half lengths from Dunlop, who had Eagle Grange close behind him. The next important raoe was the Foal Stakes, which fell to the fayo lite, Acme, who had no difficulty in disposing of a field of sixteen, including The Nun sad Munwyitina, who ran a dead heat for second place. Acme s victoryleadsone to theoondasioa that his appropriation of the Maribymong Plate is almost a muraL There was great difficulty in starting the horses in the Foal Stakes owiug to the conduct of the jockeys, every one of "whom was fined; and Williamson, rider of Edith, was suspended for the remainder of the meeting. Duration repeated his Hunt Club performance of the previous Saturday by winning the Hurdles after a good race, Problem and Chataworth filling places. The Hunters' Cup fell to Naming, a South Aus tralian bred horse nominated Mr. by G. S. Harris, and the Maiden Plate resulted in Re call, who started at 6to 1, winning easily. The last race on the card, the Toorak Handicap, saw nineteen horses go to the post, with Sirocco a well established favorite. Mentmore, however, appropriated the stake, after a good finish with Too Too, Mrs. Jarley finishing third. There are rumors that Nordenfeldt will be scratched for the Derby, and Commotion for the Mel bourne Cup. A Herald reporter interviewed the Hon. J. White, the owner of the first named horse, in reference to the rumor. Mr. White raid if be considered Monte Christo or TJialla in good enough form to win the Derby he would have no hesitation in scratching Nordenfeldt, as the first two animals were bred by him, whereas Nordenfeldt was bred in New Zealand. He also stated that he never concealed the fact that when Nordenfeldt won the A.-T.C. Derby he never intended to back him for the Melbourne Derby, and it the public had backed him they bad done so at their own rick. WATDEB TLITE.
