After Winter. Not yet the infant Spring Hath changed her russet gown for robes of green. But iieth Numbering, Hid in the coTert of a wood, unseen : Folded in shadows deep, -Emereal yisohs nit across her face m sleep. Tifo» metories of the dead, Winter revives and fades, mid days of bine, And thrusts his snowy nead u pon the landscape, whitening all the view ; With shrilly voice and thin, High singing o'er the downs the chilly breezes spin. Here, by fee sharp blest switched, Arte ready Units sooai the "road are swayed, Bandog like sprites bewitched In whirting somersaults of light and shade ; The hollow forests ring. Shuddering with lealfess -music as the lank . boughs swing. - . . Upon fiia cottage wall The Josnine lingers in a tistiess dream ; O'erhead the sparrows call, And twilter out the day in dolorous theme : Whistling a sober tone, . . . The ploughman drives his team the long darifc- aftemoon. Far o'er the marshy fen The vaprous ghosts worn travellers waylay : Xrid&Le; and dike and gten The brittle Leaves of autumn waste away ; The snowdrop, bowed with grief, Broodfrlifce an angel o'er its chastened Not sorrow, nor yet scorn, Nature wears on heir face, but calm distress ; \- lake to a driLd new-bom The yearns dim senses grope for consciousness : Tfaioogh all the stilly wood Stirreth the soul of being, buxEtfag blade spd bud. Soon shall the violet bloom Beneath the hedge, and scent each sheltered _ nook: ; Hie primrose gild the gloom Where pale anemones peep o'er the brook, And laughing waves shall swell Of golden, daffodils in every mossy dell. Hasten, sweet birds of song, Wing o'ertoe wares, and fill the woods with TOtCfiSj Spring taxrieto, fihunbering long, She waketh not, but in her dream rejoices " Quicken thou magic sod, 1 Burst to a sea of Sowers, and greet the priests of God! — Cornhill Magazine.
