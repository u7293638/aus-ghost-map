Wild, Weird, and Wonderful. A WIM), weird, and wonderful story was circulated last night. The burden of it was that within the dim recesses of " the big vugh" of the Proprietary mine a ghost had commerced its peregrinations. Since the rumor was circulated on 411 Fool's Day that a miner had disappeared in the recesses of the lower levels, never again to appear to mortal ken, reporta of strange noises and a fleeting mass of whiteness haunting the drives passed from lip to lip till the fears of the superstitious were aroused. Yesterday, it is said, the spectre manifested itself in a more decided manner by actually extinguishing the candle of an individual who sought to penetrate the vugh, sacred to the spirit of the unknown departed, and inflicted so severe a scare on the timorous mortal that medical assistance had to be called in I He saw, or felt something, there is no doubt, and speculation is rife as to whether the pother has been caused by the Gnome of the Silver Mountain (capital name for a pantomime), the ghost of a venturesome visitor, or-a frolicsome billygoat._
