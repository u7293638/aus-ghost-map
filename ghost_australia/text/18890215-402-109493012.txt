A Night Thought. Planets perpetuate the gods of Greece, And in the dark serene of midnight glide, Like ghosts of the dead powers, o'er path- ways wide; Such spell is there in names! which shall not cease, But rather, as the ages roll, increase. What mysteries to posies allied. Still in the old mythology abide— And stars secure their memory's lasting lease! While that each planet bears its pagan name The gods are unforgot. And glowing bright The constellations' clust'ring jewels claim To write, in letters of unchanging light, The history of heroes, Other fame Is dulled beside the blazonry of night! —The Cornhill Magazine.
