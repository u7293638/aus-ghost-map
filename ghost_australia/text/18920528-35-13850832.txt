MUSICAL and DRAMATIC NOTES. Mr George Musgrove arrived in Melbourne on Tuesday, by the P. and O. Liner Orontes, after a voyage of only 34 days Mr Musgrove, who has been interviewed at very great length by the daily press, has returned with the object of my esdgat rag the theatrical outlook on this side of the globe before completing certain important engagements he has under consideration, and for the purpose of negotiating with Mr J C Williamson with a view to partnership It is understood that during Mr Musgrove's few weeks' stay in Australia this partnership will become an accomplished fact, in which case the new film would presumably control the Princess's Theatre and Melbourne Opera-house, and the Theatre Rev to, Sydney, together with the new Lyceum Theatre now in course of erection in Pitt street On this latter point, however, nothing is definitely state 1 The most important now is to hand is that Mr Henry Irving and Miss Ellen T carry hay of before them certain terms for an Australian tour which they have agreed to consider further Hitherto Mr Irving has refused to move without his entire company, scenery, and properties, but the present negotiations have passed beyond this stage, so that something may yet be done in this much debated matter No doubt the great success of Mme Bernhardt has smoothed the way for Mr living, as it has been press ed that our playgoers will pay London prices for the very highest artistic talent that Europe can furnish short of that, they wisely refuse to go above the dutY familiarly known as "five, thru au J two" Amongst lessor late, Mr Musgrove has had more definite successes, and he reports that with those who will tour under his management here will be All Edward Terry, the popular comedian, and his company, Mr Wilson Barrett, of the Princess's and Now Olympic Theatres, Mr Wm Ferris and Miss Millward, who have to often played load at Drury, Lane and the Adelphi Theatres, and Mr Chas Warner, who will probably revisit Australia Mr Musgrove chronicles the continued success of Miss Nellie Stewart at the Prince of Wales The fire , whence it may be added the present writer has received a marked copy of the Court Jom unit, in which the Australian singer is referred to in the most flatter- ing terms The Avenue Theatre has been leased by Mr Charles Cherrington until next Christmas, and on 20th April Miss Janet Achurch made her Gentile in London in " A Doll's' House " The chief drawback to this artistic ture is that the London critics w as so hot in their disputes as to the merits of the play that poor " Nora " runs the risk of being torn to pieces in the contest At present some of the most important reviews of the Ibsen's drama are not to bind, but amongst those that are there seems a tendency to write upon the supposition that Miss Aohurchhaspltyod hardly anything but "Nora" since she left England, and that her impersonation has thus lost some of its original freshness In Sydney we know the very reverse to be the case, and it is the fact that in Australia MISS Achurch has not played Nora above 30 times It is even more to the point to notice that when Ibsen's drama was staged for the benefit of the Women's College just before she sailed her me ting of the part was as spontaneous, unstrained, and artistic m over The London Daily Telegraph, to whom Ibsen is as a red rag to a bull, on the revival of his drama exchanges abuse of the play itself for abuse of Miss Achurch Her acting, is now tells its real lora, " which was at the outset so universally admired, has now absolutely mined ' A Doll's House which a tour round the world him brought back disfigured with meretricious punt " "The Australian audiences," says the writer, with the true provincialism of the untravelled Londoner, would not understand the delicacy of their art, so greater ills they have raised their voices, exaggerated their effects, and destroyed their excellent method " The whole of the article is in this way devoted to a BC strong attack upon Miss Achurch and Sir harrington, and the entirely new cast is passed over in silence Fortunately for the Carrington company some other critics of equal, or greater influence, hold exactly the opposite opinion The Times considers that "the young actress" manner has nponcdfiinco she last played in London ," and the St. James's Gazette states that " she has returned a more finished artist than before Her method has ripened, her resources are more ample, her voice has gained in power , her performance seemed to be charged with even greater subtlety, abandon, and force than in the days when it attracted crowds to the unfashionable theatre in Long Acre " It is interesting to note that the various journals at present to hand devote an unusual amount of space to a production which, as a revival of a perfectly familiar work, might be dismissed in a few lines More than that, though the dividing line between those who dislike Ibsen's method is still well marked, the hostile criticism is more are sensible and moderate in its tone than it was three years ago Mr Herbert Standing, the well-known London actor, who now plays with dramatic power the heavy leading part in Mrs Bernard-Be ore's production of "As in a Looking Glass," has been long identified with characters of a very different class Mr Standing hold one continuous engagement of 11 years at the Criterion Theatre, and after touring with Mrs Beero as Jim Ralston in " Jim the Bonnum," returned again to the home of farcical comedy, and remained with Mr Chas Wyivdlinin for three years more By a somewhat strange coincidence, the actor made his stage debut at the Queen's The fire in 1858, m "Still Waters Run Deep," in a cast which included Mr Wyndham as Captain Hawkesley, with the late Alfred AVigun as Mildmuj, whilst at the Criterion Theatre just three years ago Mr Standing found himself cost as How Besley (one of his best parts with his old friend in Wigan's original character At this house he created the character of Sir Percy AVagstafto in " Pink Dominoes " (March, 1877), and played it for 500 nights, he was the original Captain MuoAIuniis in "Betsy " (800 nights), and created amongst others, the character a of John Penrhyn the (Quaker in "Truth," the Governor of the Girl in "Fourteen Days," and Col AVjbrow Walker in "Buttoiflj Tower This long career in farcical comedy, after some interruption due to engagements of a heavier kind was resumed last May, when Mr. Standing was the original Major Joseph Marshall in " The Late Lamented " at the Court Theatre, and when the since was transferred to the Strand Theatre three months later the actor continue _ ymg the rule until _'^_ long run of 250 nights came to an end. This was the last engagement Mr Standing filled before sailing for Australia. Mention of his early connection with Mr Irving, to which no reference is made in the foregoing, proved so full of interesting reminiscences that the story may be given in Mr Standley's own words He says -' Thirty years ago, before I served under Mr Irving's banner, I supported the late Mark Lemon, so long editor of Punch, in Falstaff,' and I thus enjoyed the unique experience of appearing as the Prince of Wales before the Prince of Wales It H having commanded a private performance of ' Falstaff ' at the London Gallery of Illus tuition for the delectation of the Court When Mr. Horny In rag first produced 'The Bells,' nott just 20 years ago, I was throughout Christian of the east, and with his usual kindness to his juniors, he used frequently to invite me to his rooms in Old Quebec-street I shall never forgot one of the experiences of my salad days with which he was connected One morning Irving strolled across Hyde Park with me to the house of Mr Pottie, B.A., to show me a portrait of himself as Matthias in The Bells ' After shaking hands with the artist, who admired the painting, and lit mar, turning to me, said Well, my boy, and how do you like it t" I, being v ory green in those days, replied, ' Oh, capital , it will really be splendid M ben it is finished There was an aw kit and silence, and the other two looked out of window reflectively) It was finished, and that was show Suutlay'-ouly I don t know it One story leads to another, and I should like to tell one that will illustrate living's gentle, kindly way with those around him Towards his latter end Pom Mead, the tragedian with the deep voice, who so often played the Ghost in Hamlet,' became senior hat erratic and for getful The result was that during the scene between Hamlet and his Queen-mother, who one evening entered on the right of the stage instead of on the left, where Irving, in and it distress, was looking for him As Irving at wheeled about, the audience heard Mead's hollow morning all over the house 'Turn round, Governor Turn round " I'm here I'm here and Irving died turn, whilst the audience smiled After the scene, It sung in her mild way addressed 'Mond, my boy, on the subject Old Meade replied, in his free and easy way, unconscious of offence, Yes, Governor, don't you think it's a good deal Of course, Hamlet couldn't know where the Ghost was coming from, and if I changed the entrance every night in realistic fashion you would look more surprised ' Irving, with his humorous, gentle smile, merely said Thank you, my boy, but I prefer noting a surprise to your giving me one, so pray stick to the old business ' This little anecdote", which has not been published before, will show you the secret of Long's popularity with all his old comrades As for myself, I should like to add that Standing is my real name, and that I belong to a good old Quaker family) which, strangely enough, has furnished the stage with others than of) self One of my brothers, Mr Frank Colls, is the well known operatic baritone, my brother William Carlton, also a baritone, has made a fortune, with Carlton's English Opera Co' known throughout America, and my sister, Mrs Norman, was a

the end of last week, in anticipation of the season which he inaugurates at the Garrick Theatre with " Hamlet " next Saturday It w di probably be remembered that this part of the world is not
