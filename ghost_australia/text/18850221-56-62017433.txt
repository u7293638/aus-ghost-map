' He saw a general mustering: of the younger guestsy even down to the boys and girls, for the Lancers, and ' fol lowed one and another that caught ' his eyes through the mazy intricacies, making little gestures of disgust at those !who seemed oiitra and peculiar in manner and appearance,1 and - regarding with the closest observation such as exhibited a happy mean between a certain rusticity end awkwardness wtth which he was We! acquainted/and a conventional artificiality which was to him all the more unnatural and absurd because his perception was notdulled'by familiarity with society's passing whims. ?- ??? ! ; ' ? , ; ? : '??'?The* young stranger' :whotn Mr.'J iToce lyn bad repulsed; and who was the real -pbject of his quest,5 did ripi appearambng the^pleasure-seekersy' nor 'could he. dis-! cover him on the piazza, 'in the billiard roomy nor in other place of resort. At, last in much disappointment he returned to his seatr from which he commanded ? view of the parlour ';' and scarcely hat he done so before the one he sought mounted the steps near him as if return ing from a stroll* in '_ the' hotel1 grounds, I threw away a cigar, and entered an open window^ .with , the sam9 graceful, listless saanter witnessed in: the afternoon. He crpsBed ' ' th'e wide apartment ! with as 'much ease; and nonchalance ; as if it bad been empty, and sat down; on a: sofa by a somewhat stout and - very elegantly ap parelled gentlewoman. ? ' ? ??' '?'???'? '/ ? ; Roger never thought of accounting for the intensity of his interest in this stranger— the young rarely analyze iheir feelings— but, obedient to. an impulse to learn. this man's; power to win the favour of one so unapproachable by himself, he scanned with keenest scrutiny everything in. his appearance and manner, and sought eagerly to gauge bis charater. ,- : He felt instinctively that the ' cold-! ?blooded snob,' as Mr. Jocelyn had char acterized him, was of the very ! opposite type from bimseif. His graceful saunter, which, nevertheless, possessed a certain 'quiet dignity, suggested a burdensome1 'leisure and an utter lack of purpose to go anywhere or do anything.! He/ dropped on the sob rather than sat down. The lady at his side spoke rather decidedly to! him, and he answered briefly without .even' looking at her. By and : by, she spoke again, more energetically ; he then slowly! arose, approached a young woman sitting jnear,' who in . response, to something . te! said sprang up with alacrity, and they; glided away in the waltz with an ease and ?! grace scarcely equalled by; the others upon the floor. After a few moments they circled around near Roger's post of observation, and he was able to scan both! the features and expression of the man whom he felt inclined to bate. , But he was disarmed and perplexed,': for rthe stranger showed no more1 pleasure' or, animation-thanwould afallen- leaf ? that was.£sweptiJierS and ^therelbyLVarying sddies of wind. -He kept time and step; 'with perfect accuracy, ; but evidently from' such complete familiarity, withthe ' fornpi , that he gave it not a thought;' ? He danced as - easily as a bird:' flies,; avoiding the| i others without appearing i to notice them: iNo:icolonr/came from' i the 'exercise,' no; light' kindled inhis face. 'His expres .sioh:was not Jfa«e or cynical,^ but weary -and dejected ; the melancholy .^in':» his! large- brown i eyes*, was .'alli'the 'more; striking from: contrast with; thei masic,: the lighted room/ 'and an amusemeiitj suggesting gaiety. .Pale, utterly nn-: responsive to the brilliant' and mirthful scenes, he glided ghost-like here and ?there,! and before very: long seated 'bis; companion by ' the elderly woman 'whose; -urgency; had: led to his automaton-like performance. ; Then with a slight bow! ? he passed .throngh ? ai window- near and disappeared.

' He cuold.seeas well as I that ?there'was no one there who, conld com 'pare with her.. If he can, dance, why!

' ' Roger's, dreams proved that his sym'-j pathies- with the; melancholy strange)- , !were not very deep, and; that' his idea of; the survival of the fittest was.tbeanryivalj of the strongest. His humaninature at that time was of the old Saxon type,! that went' directly for whnt: Unwanted,- without much thought or sentiment for those weak enough to lose. ... : ?
