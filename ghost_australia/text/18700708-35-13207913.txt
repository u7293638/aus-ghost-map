TRUNKEY CREEK. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. SIR-As many of your readers are interested in the above locality, a few remarks made on the ground last week may not be unacceptable to them As I left Bathurst in the four-horse coach, so well driven by Dick, it commenced raining A very gently, and when we descended the mountain known as Oakey Ridge every rut in the road formed a channel for the water, and every creek was running with great rapidity the ground was so charged with water that it could not absorb any more, and every drop that fell had to find an escape somewhere HUB made travelling anything, but pleasant, and induced fearful fe recordings for the safety of dams and such-like property We passed through ' One Lye, just about dark, and for the remaining two miles Dick bud to take his coach and four through the bush because the nail was impassable Ml honour to that accomplished drive for the an inner in which he performed his task on a dark night, without the ghost of a light flic danger appeared so (great that I insisted on walking, notwithstanding Dick s assurance that he would not hurt a hair of my head, and would get there before me, which he certainly did safely, while I was floundering about, up to my knees, in mud When I presented myself at the Royal Hotel I looked nine like an underground miner than a citizen of Sydney A good wash, a good dinner, and a good night > rest brought on the Sabbath morning, and it was gratifying to find that a Wesleyan minister was there from Carcoar to conduct Divine service, morning and afternoon, and that the sound of the church-going, bell brought a tolerably good congregation through the mud on both occasions On Monday morning I set out a survey this once famous gold held which was to have made all our fortunes, but which if present has only yielded dividends for the publican and storekeepers on the gr mind, who seem still to be doing a good trade On the day I arrived effort if M'Phie's party had finished crushing 59 tons, which reduced lad of 17 dwts, each man had received about £60, and some of them were determined not to leave the Royal while any portion re- mining 1 secured a horse and started in my tour, with wet in every direction, indeed the earth is so saturated with water that if is impossible to work any claims, and if you could work them, it would take all the King's horses and all the King's men to got the stone taken to the machine, the consequence is that nearly all work is sus j c nded, and men are employed about odd jobs and waited,, patiently for fine weather I rode ACT most of the le css and visited the various machines, and conversed with nearly all the managers of companies, and the result of the whole is, that Trunkey is still in its infancy, and can only be developed by 1 room and capital, which must be patiently expended Hie A stormy Company has an extensive plant in fine working order, with a reservoir of water which will last ten years 'They were crushing stone from the Alexandra reef in one battery, and from then own reefs m mother live j biiAc already i rushed of their own 31 .> tons which yielded 357 oz , they have 150 tons more in the surface, and with the 900 tons at Wile ox s, they In e ' plenty of stone at grass to keep the in employed for several weeks if they could get it carted to the mill I he Enterprise Company has dom partly finished and its machinery on the ground, but not erected They have sunk five shafts varying from 30 to 130 feet deep, and they were then commencing to sink on a reef which has yielded 7 oz (to the ton crushed at Miss bell s Creek They were also sinking on another reef where they had gone down 20 feet with good gold in the stone all the way down, and the reef from i to 6 inches wide The by dney Company s machine is ii A cry complete plant, and does great credit to Mr George "Wills who erected it, and Mr Bennett who is now working it One end of the d un has given way with the last flood, and a contract, has been entered into to replace it for 670 'His machine was crushing stone for the 1 excelsior Company, which was washed up while I was there, and gave 15 dwts totbeton Two of the leases belonging to this company have been let on tribute to responsible men on fav humble teams who will commence working the moment the weather permits The great Western Company has acted the most prudently of all the ce ñipamos-they have not spent any money in the machinery like their neighbours, believe reserved their strength to test their reef, which is being, done under the able superintendence of Mr Blackham, a benchman for in Victoria He has a shaft down on the line of W llsou s reef 185 feet and has driven 30 feet, and ex Sccts to cut the reef in 30 feet more He has also a shaft own on Barrett's reef 100 feet and has driven 50 feet going through in that drive b o y leaders from 8 to 18 inches wide He is paying only 12s per foot, and hopes to come upon a permanent reef shortly Mr Blackett, who is a very intelligent miner, of great experience, says that the Sydney people are too imp intent, they want dividends before the capital has had time to produce them, and that we shall never set feed on such a principle He says that when they have such indications on Victoria as there are at Trunkey they never leave the le ears until they have found the reef, and in one case that resistances, they searched for seven years, and finally succeeded in realising a handsome return The Excelsior Company have registered their claim until the ground becomes work able, and lune paid all their men off for the present the most celebrated claim on Trunkey, known as Claim must , Ivo 5, appears to be worked out, as the best two crushings were very poor-it may, however, make again if they could only get close to the water Wilson and Burns's Reef have been the greatest success -the prospectors have raised 900 tons, out of which they have crushed 100 tons, yielding between I and 3 ounces to the ton, and they expect the remainder will turn out as good The adjoining claim, kn are as Wilson's Ivo 2, has 500 tons of Mono on the same face, which they estimate at 1 oz to the Iron, and large bets have been made that it produces even more On the former claim they have nine shafts down, varying from 87 to 150 feet, and with reefs from 8 to 18 inches wide they have eighteen men at work now, but generally employ about thirty They have come to the water level on those claims, at a depth of 135 feet, but they have plenty of stuff between that and the surface The principal objection at Trunkey is, flint the country is so unsettled the miners describe it as all jumbled up, and they say that you must not expect permanent reefs until you get into settled country, which can only be done by sinkings they all remain in the opinion that those who sink will eventually MR feed, but not without Illa manage of the Bank c of New South Wales gave me the results of nil flu erushinijS which had come into the Bank Sixty-five parcels, cc naming in all 180-1 tons of stone, had by yielded 190 oz 3 dwt lines of gold. The best was Crummies INO r, where 75 tons produced 110 o/ t> dwts and the west was a ease in which 31 tons produced only 7 dwts 17 grs It is a great pity for the interests of (his gold field that fliceonipmies were formed upon so extravagant a basis Pic pic were led away in the first instance by the apparent richness of the stone and the results shown by Mint assays, and (the holders of claims fixed a value on their property who he was supposed to be correct, and was paid to them in shares, by which the nominal capital of a company was raised to £30,000 These golden visions have now proved delusive, and in many capcsnonnnhavcbeen more deceived them the original claim holders many of whom held then shares, under the impression that they would pay hand- some dividends, and now find that they are utterly unsaleable It does not, however, follow that Trunkey Creek is a failure because these companies have been formed upon a wrong principle- the nominal capital of four of thcseiempnnicb IN £100,000, while the actual capital expended on the ground by them all, does not exceed SHEGOG We may assume that 15400 more will cover all that has been expended in en artz winning by other parties outside the companies making a total expenditure in quartz mining, machinery, and dams, of £20,000, and for that, there has passed through the bank as much gold as would produce ¿7102-a tolerably) handsome return in less than twelve months on the expenditure if so small an amount of capital, to say nothing of the old vi has found its way to Sydney before the bank was (established The present contract prize for raising a ore is 16s porten, < rushing, 12s 6d carting, as but take them all at 36 and the cost of producing the gold out of the lbO i tons which passed through the bank would not i M deduct that from the £71b2, and you have a profit of I 820, which would not pay over 3 per cent on the nominal capital of £12b,00U, but would pay nearly 40 per cent. on the) rail capital employed, and thus make all the di licence between failure and mares It is therefore qtuloeltni that if theptesentcompaniesarc to work Trunkey in rcFpfully they must be reconstructed on a more correct foundation The Sydney ( ompnnyhas already commenced this (operation by asking the original proprietors to cancel three-fourths of their shares, and the subscribing share holders one-half of theirs , so that the capital of the company may be reduced from 10,000 to 12,000 shares, upon which all the shareholders are to be liable to pay ( alls as they may be required The only parties who will suffer by this arrangement are those who have purchased fully paid up shares, but, fortunately for this company, the original proprietors all hold their shares, with the exception of about 1000, and I have been informed, on the authority of the see rotary, that almost every shareholder has consented to the arrangement. We must, therefore, not condemn all mining operations because mistakes have been made, but endeavour to avoid such mistakes in future, and see that we get a fair prospect of value for our money before we part vi if hat Your obedient servant, GOLDSEEKER. PS. Since writing the above, have been informed that, a fair sample of the tailings taken five or six times a day, from the Victorian Company's machine while they were crushing their own stone, has just been assayed at the Mint and shows gold remaining to the extent, of 1 oz. 2 dwts. 16 grs. of gold per ton, being a larger quantity than the stone yielded. The Mint gave a similar result from the Sydney Company's first crushing. It may, therefore, yet be found that some defect exists in the mode of extracting the gold, which a very simple chemical operation might cure. a
