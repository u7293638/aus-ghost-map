It was then that, suddenly recalled to him self, he ut terrsi the exclamation with which we P.v«h Kingston svas a well- made, handsome ymlth nf twenty-two.

Mining speculations had absnrbed the rich merchant*. ss- ealth, and in lieu nf an immense landed estate and a heavy hanking account, at hi. death he left his win a nttmlier of com paratively w-airthlejs scrip and his blessing only. li.ish, however, was not one to murmur and complain. He had his health, a pond education, and the hirit-age nf an unstains-d name, and ho fs't capable of fighting the lialtle of life suc cessfully. Although comparatively pr.sr, he ivas none the 1,-s jsapular witli his former companion", and the number-of invitations tn yachting rx cuHoos and other sorting anitisitni-nts that he receivnl really vrinusly intcrf'ivd srith his l-iid.ih'.e desire to establish himself iv his cho sen profession. There w-ere few men liko Dash Kingston, hnTcver. He wa. a natural-Isnrn hem. llatvtauiie in person, generous and brave, tnd an adept at all manly'exercises. A thorough sailor and yachtsman, a power ful oarsman, a skilfs.l boxer and wrestler, a d.-od sh.,t with either pistol nr rifle, and svith all. a svh.sle smiled, manly, d.ire-di-vil ynuth— a p.ssl friend, and a brave and lu.-sgnatsiiiioui enemy.

Skilfully Dash guided the boat as he was directed. A moment they were lifted upon the crest of a swell Uien swiftly they »h,.'. down, and the boat thumped heavily against a floating ob ject. " By thunder 1" exclaimed Hcmway, in a hu-kv voice, " here it is ; it is a woman's,afler an." Da.h drew in hi. oars, and his friend guided Ihu H„»ting bs.ly lss-id,- the boat. It svas not quitu dark yet. and leaning over, he glanced at Uio dark object, when he cx '•'...uned: " It is a female, certain, but it hai a black drTs-sa on; the blue-eyed corpse was. cloUicd in white." " Then this is not the body you saw!" " No." " Tnis is a go, Imys," remarked Tom nardy, the tliinl ynuth in the Imat. " What am we going lo do about it!" asked tlio practical Heinway; "wo cannot cast it ndrift." ' 111 he shot if we can tako it into thoboit," sai.iTnm ILinly. " We mu^t find Iho other one," said Dash Kingston. " l'crhapi the two women were in the boat together, and were upset somesvhero up the riTer.'' "Gontlneis, see that!" suddenly exelaimei Tom H.inly, ai he leaned forw-ard and took a :In-er survey of the black-robcil corpso, add ing: "Tliis lets been a munler!" and he pointed '.owird the de.i.l woman's temple, where a gap ing Wound sv.is visible, tho whole sido of the hm- hcid being sliattcrcd as though by a blow from a bludgeon. Tlie three young men lookod aghast at the fearful sight in silence for a moment, whcs. Heniway said: " ify npinitn is that we had better cast this •shject ailrift, and ptdl back to the yacht." " We can tow it ashore and fasten it to one of the piles, where it will be found in the morning; we can do no more,"said llasn Kingston. : Twilight had deepened into night, but the red sunlight liad been succeeded by a round, full moon, whicli shone o'er the city beyond liko a gmit bait nf silver, and hashed a silver stsccn over the dark waters. Turriblo and ghastly did thn faco of the dead woman appear under tho shulnsvy gleam of the mionlig'it; aad, as thn three young men looked upon tlio white Iml hlo.ito.l fair turns, each felt a cold chill curdling around bis hoart. " Fasten the ropo around ymr prize," said Hardy, " and well get through with tho first ghastly job." Hortiway did a? directed, and tho lilagk mboil figure was toured round io thu stom of tho boat. Tlio boat was now h«sde*l tosvanl Woolno mooloo Bay, and Dash Kingston niwed with a 1-o'emn regularity, as though at a Boating funs. nil. In an hour thoy arrived at tha wharf, when Da.--h said, in a husky whisper: " l-'.-v ten it to ono ot tho piles: quick, Horn way, wo are liable to bo discovered at any mo mont." Assistcsl by Tom nardy, Ilcmsray soon succeeded in fastening the body, attichod by the ropo, tn nno of tho pilas, when ho said: " Now, thon, Hash, pull out oasily; all is right." Da-.h fell to hi. oars, and hid just succeeded in pulling nut fmm nnd jr tho pier, when sud denly, fmm tho dock ovor their heads, camo the inquiry, in a gniff voice: "Hold! whngoo.thcr'!" " It's a ' cop,' D.isli," said Hcmway " Pull for vssur life, nosy, 1*110." CHAPTER 11. Tlie thres young men in the boat cared loss for actual adventure than tr.eydid for tha ghastly work in which they hwl ltcon engaged, and when Hcmway exclaimed, "Let her go— it's a 'cop,'" D.n.i laid tn.m his oar.s,nnl tho lsn.it shot < tit fnsm under the pier liko a race boat "Lay to!" said the same gruff voicof rom the dock. "On hang ynttr-rlf!" rolled Kick Turn Hardy, who was .1 lecklcss, dare-slevil sort of a chap. The .answer tn tliis t»i!ito invitation was a pistnl-shnt. " Ity thunder! tho wretch take us fnr river thieves," rsrlaimed llioway, .11 he dodged a kill that whirred suit his head. Hang ! king 1 rime several other shnts in quick succession, but I )a>!i Kingston's strung rowing had carried them beyond pistol-shot range. " Am I lieadin* for the yacht. boys!" asked D.i»h. " Yos, all right, my hearty. Don't I see her light dipping t.,ir.ird t*ii> ris-cr .11 though it wcul.l bury itself in a mist of silver spray!" ■aid Hcmway. " Arc yon going to give np yonr search for the blue-: ycd dead angrl!" askesl Tom. " 1 shall nut continue my search just at pre sent." And without another word Dadt Kingston pulled straight toward the j-acht Susie. Onco alongside, his tsvo companion! lrapcd abnanl, while he remained in the bait. " Are you not coining aboard, Dash Tasked Hcmway. " Not at present. Send Yanko to me." " All right," wai the answer, and in a few mnments a black face protruded oi'er the sido of the j-acht, and its colstureil owner ask -I: "You want me, Missa Kingston!" "Yes, Yanko; I am going ashore, and I rant i*ou to come along wiUi me to bring tho boat back." "All right, sah," replied tho black, and he leaped over Use quarter-rail of the ya„t into the bait. At this moment Tom Hardy came to the rail and ca'ded out: " Where are you nil to, Dash !" " Ashore," was the reply.and the boat glided away from the side of the j-acht. " 11! be hanged if I don't think that Dash Kingston has lust hi* senses; he is going on* nn a night excursion all alone tn fish for that blue eyed beauty that he imagine, ho sasv floating by here a spell ago," muttered Turn, as he turned away and joined ono or two of the'erew seated by the cabin dnor. In tlie meantime Dash Kingston had rowed silently towards the Manly shore, aad running up under one of the piers, lie said to the black Yanko: " I am going to gv-t out httre, and you can take the boat back." " When me pull away take you back, Missa Kingston!" " You need not come at all; go ahead now; I am a!l right," answered Dash, as ha jutnpjd up ujion the wharf. Twenty minutes from thi departure of the boat. Dash Kingston glidsd out into the stream in a cat-rigged sailing- boat, and drifted ass-.iy with the tide. There wai a stiff breeze blowing directly towards tho other shop., and Dash, thinking .lie object nf whirli he was in search had drifted there, healed bis kiat in that dire tion. All the tray across the liarbinr he kept his eyes ennstantly on the alert, scanning every floating object that he passed with the closest scnitinj*, hut no sign nf the white-robed figure rewarded him. Just outside tin .s'wre-ssvell he steered his boat so as to sail as near the ls?ach as possible, and so com—teticssd to make a complete circuit of the shore. He had not prnccedesl very far ere he be held a dark object moving slowly along the beach. Wondering what the man he had seen was up tn.Dash turnisl bis Isnt imt from the shore, sn-.ls not to attract this attention nf th* wan derer on the beach, while he himself could see the man's movements. Presently Dash sasv tho man on tho beach cotno to a halt, and strain his eyes out ujton lite water. Dash had brought his boat to, and was lean ing over the gunwale, svhen ho saw the strangady-acting man wade into the water.ano the next moment seize an object floating ou Uie crcat of a wave. Rising tn his feet suddenly. Dash leaned forsvard, and soon beheld a sight that caused him to exclaim: "By Jove, ho has found it!" and ho imme diate!)* headed toward Uie promontory juttinf out from the shore. CHAPTER lIL The youth felt greatly excited. Hia eye» beamed with a queer light, ami a jnllor over spread his handsome features as lie ran for the shore. "That fellow i« a bird of prey," muttered Da-h, a» lio mnvod stealthily along, dodging fn>m n<ck to ruck. Hy the time th« yonth arrived in right ol the :nan and liit prey the latter had succeeded in hauling thub tdy.vthore t an>] his movements at once betrayed that Kingrtim'ii stHpiciom were correct, as tho latter u-:w ablo to aec, hy the aid of thn moonlight, that at that very moment the fellow wai trying tu pull a ring from the fingiT i>f the orp-c. Keeping out of view, h>; olnen-ed the man'* movement* fur a m.imunt, whilaioakinsuphU mind how to proceed. It wai a inarveliHuty clrnr night; tlie I!— lit nf (lie moon madu übjecU almust a* plainly viiihlc as at nmnday. Kingston iva< Hill undecided as to what ex cuse ho ilionld olTcr for diaturhin^ tlio man, wlicn ho saw the latter draw a datp-knife from his i»ickct and make a movement ai though about to »ver one of tho drad girl'* finjrers. The youth cnnld not stand this, and leaping forth, ho ithouted: " Hold on, you wretch ; wliat aro you doing there!" " And who may yon be !" anted the man, in » frrnff voice, turning round and standing revealed in tho moonlight, with the dead girl'* hand clasped in one hand and the glittering knife in the other. "I am one who will n»t stand by and permit yon to mutilate the dead." "You bo, ch! Well, «ee here, my young counter flipper, if yon don't about march and go about your business, 111 smother you in the water there.". \- "ITioyotingmanglanccdaboiitineverydireo.' tion.aml his cyo foil itpon a pioce of a broken oar lying upon tho beach. A moment later Dash had secured it. It proved to Iso tho round, heavy end, and tho youth w-.i tlolightcd tliat he had secured such nn excellent cudgel. Soiling tho cudgel firmly, ho moved toward the ruffian with the remark, in a threatening tone: " Jfy friend, you will have to move asvay." The man dropped the dead hand, and grosvl-. ing innrc liko a dog than a human being, as he drew from his pocket a pistol, and aiming it at Dash, exclaimed in a ficrco voice, and with many oaths: "Look here. Mister! I've Just got a litUo toy hen: that's wm 111 a million af sticks like that; and if y,sn don't irant a holo in your skin yn-.tll mousey, and not make any bone* about it, cither." Dash slid ssot halt as commanded, bnt boldly •ds-anccil toward the villain, determined to bring matters to a decided issue at onco. Tho man levelled his pistol, and shouted : " Stand back, or by 111 shn.it I" Still, without flinching. Dash advanc*. Thcro came a elicit, but no report. At Uio moment that the man pulled 'he trigger of It'll pistol Dash swung tho bludgeon in the air. As tho Irishman says, "a shillclah never misses tire," and tho piece of oar eped through tho air and descended upon the wrist and hand of tho murderous body rubber, knocked tlie pistol from his grasp, and compelled him to yell with pain. Still tho man was not overcome. Springing back, ho drew a murderous-look ing knife, and then attempted to close in upon his gallant young antagonist. Tbo latter, however, was too much for him, ! and quite a lively skirmish followed. Both men dodged and parried npnn tho beach ie the presenco of the dead body of the young girl. Kingston's kindness prevented him from nsitsg his formidable weapon, as he could havo done. His object was to knock tho knife from the man** hand as he had done the pistol, and then drive him off. Hn failed to succeed.and the stubbommtxs of the man mvitsnl his own dnnm. ■ "Will you make off Tasked Dash. " And leave the diamonds.and jewels to yon, parsl * No, no, replied the man, from between hi. clenched teeth. "Then yonr fato be on your own head," ex claimed Dash. "Go kecrful, young man; this is murder, yer know." " "Will you mako off!" "No I" yelled tho man. and with a fearful oath he mada a spring at Dash. "Tbo hitter was pre|iarcd. Ilia patience was also exhausted, and down came hi« cudgel, when tho foiled t?bbcr sunk upon tho wet sand. CnATTKU IV. A wienrand ghost-like *cen* was presented npon that lonely beach under tho bright moon- j light as Da«h dropped upon hi* knew on tlie j wet wr.4, and loaned over the pale, stark face ; of the d«sul girl. I Even while ho knelt beside her it seemed a* I though thow exquisitely-formed lip' would i part, ami from the pearly teeth would enmo a i si* ret voice, asking, " Where am I ?" ( Instinctively ho brushed the damp hair a-niJe, and laid his hand upon the fair fore head.

Kneeling, he placed hu hand over the man's heart. lie lived; and, with tho mntlered remark s "It is hard to kill roch scoundrel*," Dash re turned and contemplated Iho white £"ureoft)ie murdered Rui. While he gazed hi* cyo Wl npon an objeil that glittered like a i-pari <>f fire. A clowr injection proved that it was a I brilliant jewel that glistened upon the girl'* finger. He stooped, as though alwut to remove it, when a nervom repulsion caused him to start back and ciclaim: " No; I cannot rob the dead !" Tlien his cyei Wl upra two other jewels that sparkled is the girl's cart. " What shall I do! If I leave those jewels glittering upon that girl's |*rson and go for assistance. Mime other vandal like yon scamp may come along and possess himself of them," ho muttered. After reflecting a moment, he addod: " I will remove them and hold them for the friends of the dead girl." Dish wh mom uiccwfiit than tho robber had been, and had but littlo difficulty in re moving thft jewels. He had but jint ponowod himself of them when ho heard voices.and upon raising his eyos I.".<aw tho glimmer of a light approaching to wanl him along the bwicii. " flrcat hoavon<! If lam found with theso jewel* on mo I will l« looVeil upon xt a robber of the drctd ;" he suddenly exclaimed. Instinctively ho turaod, as though to ran away. " I mean no harm, but I must protect my self," ho muttered, and with a catlike step he imved away. After procrcding a fhort distance ho ascended tho bank that lined the bench, and moving stealthily along, retraced his bteps to a point opposite to where the body lav. lie had but just time to conceal himself when a ]iarty of four men, carrying a lantern with them, reached the spot where the whito figure lav. The men h.vl lint jmt discovered the body, And a scene of excitement folliiwcd. From his hiding place D.mli could hear every word that was spoken, and, whilo liatrning, ho liad a premonition of the terrible mUtako he had made. "There has been fonl murder here,"said one of tho men, a* he held his lantern down over the face of tho dead girl. " It has been a dmiblo mnrdrr," cried an other of the men, as his eyo fell npon the form of the man. "Xo, by thunder! This fellow lives," h« added, after a moment, as he felt the woutvUhl man's puUe. " Yes; I live," came tho response in feeble tonc«. " What lim happened ?" nsked the men in chom«, ai Ihey gathrrcl ronnd. " (live me a drink tint; lam dying of thirst." One of tho newcomers had a flask with him, and put it to the man's 1!|«. The latter dranfc, and «omed preatlT re vivod, when he said : " A terrible crime has just been committed liefore my ryes." " Toll us about it, quick! There may yet be a cbance to capture the assassin." The fellow pretended to bo very tnnch otw torn* by me tomble «ci"no he had witnessed, »nd al«o to feel K-ul fnim tlm effecU of the blow he had rrcrivo.l; but taking anutlier good pull from the flask, ho said : " I wai walking along the beach, when I «aw a straggle going on in a bnat a tittle off the •horo lietween a man nnd a woman. Thft man finally seized an car anil struck the girl a blow on the back of the he.-ul,and she fell overboard, when the man sailnl away." " And th'u is the girl that was murdered!" " YtJ; I recovered th« Uidy after an hour's Labour, and had just succeeded in hauling it ashore, when the assassin returned. He as saulted me, nnd a ttrusgle followed, but with the same oar with which hs eruslied in the •kull of tho girl he laid me out, then robbed the body of too girl of several valuable jewel*, and escaped." , Dash heard the whole story, and would have rushed down and denied it; but, alas! circum stances were against him. The girl', head hail been crushed by a blud geon, and he really had the jewels on his per son, although for no unlawful purpose. One of the men was left with tho body, whil* the others started to notify tho authorities, so that an immediate search night be instituted lor the supposed assassin. 1 Tho man had furnished an neenrato desenp. tion of Dash Kingston, nnd, as tho latter stole away.ho fully realised his peril; circumstances —fatal circumstances, were against him.nml he had unconsciously assisted in gathering them j about him. ■ ' Ho succeeded in reaching tho city- without being discovered, and upon the following morn ing road in tho paiHsrs tho usual sensational and exaggerated account of a diabolical murder, in cluding an accurate description of tho clothing worn by tho assassin, nnd a garbled description of his person. The matter had gen* so fnr that Dash dared not now disclose himself nnd relate the, truo facts; and in hopes that tho matter would blow over in a fesv days, ho shaved off his whiskers, and moustache, and in other ways altered his anpearanec, and making excuses to his friends, went to Melbourne. Upon tho very evening ef his arrival ho was passing the door nf the laidci' parlour in the hotel, when ho beheld a sight that caused his heart to stand still, and tho blood to frcezo in his veins. There, standing in tho centre nf tho parlour, was a lady; and beyond any question of doubt marvellous as it seemed, that lady tlsat his eyci rested upon was tho living, breathing girl the dead Imdy of whom ho believed ho hid left npnn tbo Roso Bay shore under tho moonlight somo hours before. - At first ho thought it might bo only a fancied resemblance. Recovering his self- posaossion, ho stepped into the room. Thc-ro waa not tho least possibility of a mis take ; there wens tho samo features, the same lovely bltio eyes, tho same golden trcsio-, tli* oxqutsito month—nil,all tho «ii», " Oh, hnavans | am I mad, or have I hewn dreaming somo horrible dream I* mnrmttrc- Dash, as he staggered from the room.
