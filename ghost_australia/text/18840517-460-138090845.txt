Extract from letter referred to above. " I have read completely through the book of our friend Irish Mr. Max O'Reil since this afternoon. " Oh ! the sublime author that the Max O'BclI!

It is truly magnificent; but it is also the history— nay ! more—it is the True! " I myself was in time past during an epoch thrice similar at London—me who you speaks—Yes 1 and I you assure that Mr. Mas O'Reil has Reason—more also, it is that be has of the ability—the Talent! "Receptive, discerning also, as are all of these clever Irishes, he comes to make one grand mistake (' bevue'), where he wishes well himself to pose, 'En veritable Francois.' "Otherwise 'La Colonic Franeaise' of Leicester square is not too accurately painted, and our clever Irish this has done'expris,'so that Mister John Bull might to himself imagine the work of ' un veritable Francois qui vouiait bien cacher son identity.' " Me also, I have myself my little quarrel with the author Irish, that he flatter too much the Bull. " But the book is thricc-clevcr, evidently the work of an Irish that jokes. " It is much possible that he may deceive the Bull, but us, my chcrishc-d friend, never ! " Heceive, pray, the assurances if my b'ghost and most distinguished consideration, ana believe me, ever vour friend devoted— " Heuaclt be Seychelles.
