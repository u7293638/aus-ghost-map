A BALLARAT GHOST. BALLARAT, Monday. A "ghost scare," which has occasioned consi- derable amusement in Ballarat, occurred the other night among a number of the cabmen ply- ing for hire between the city and the new ceme- tery. It was approaching midnight, and the Jehus had drawn their vehicles up in line at the cemetery gates preparatory to setting out on their last return trip to Ballarat. The night was dark and squally, and one of the drivers, gazing listlessly into the cemetery, was startled to see, as he believed, a moving figure carrying a lighted lantern, which flashed "like a beacon on the sea coast." Addressing his mates in the rank, he cried out — "As I live boys, see the ghost over yonder. Let us all scoot home as fast as we can." Several jumped into their vehicles on seeing the apparition and drove off post haste towards the city. Two "brave fellows," however, re- maind to "lay out" the ghost. Entering the cemetery grounds they wended their way along one of the winding paths in the graveyard, when the glare of the light "widened out," and they came to a standstill to hold a consultation, and it was decided to "report the ghost" to the sexton, Mr. Rattray, who resides within the cemetery enclosure. Roused from his slumbers he ridiculed the fears of the cabmen, one of whom — a nervous Hiber- nian — assured Mr. Rattray, that a ghost was "walking around," and described its get up and dimensions vividly. The sexton invited the cabby to "come and see." "No fear," was the reply, "we'll not go up towards that thing with the lantern." On reaching the gates the sexton, sure enough, saw a kind of illumination away back some 500 yards in the cemetery, and striking a direct line towards it he walked up to find that the supposed "ghost" was merely a newly erected headstone of polished marble, on which were reflected the rays of a street lamp, fully a quarter of a mile from the cemetery fence.
