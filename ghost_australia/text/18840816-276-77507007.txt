Australian Belief. ALL the tribes, believe, that the earth" is flat, and that the fsky is propped up on pioles. Beyond the sky is the gum-tree country, the home of spirits and ghosts.- Everyman has within him a Yambo, or spirit, which can leave his body and wander even to the gum tree country and talk with the spirits there, or converse with the wandering ghosts of other sleepers. The state of departed souls and their doings after leaving the human body fill a great part of Australian mythology. The dead are buried doubled up, the body lying on ? the side, and the usual deposit is made of the personal effects of the deceased. Mr. Howitt, in the Journal of tlw, Anthropo logical Institute. -
