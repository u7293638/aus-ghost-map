OVERLORD. BY BLISS CARMAN. Lord of the grass and hill, Lord of the rain, White overlord of will, Master of pain. I, who am dust and air, Blown through the halls of death Like a pale ghost of prayer, I am thy breath. Lord of the blade and leaf, Lord of the bloom, Sheer overlord of grief, Master of doom. Lonely as wind or snow, Through the vague world and dim, Vagrant and glad I go; I am thy whim. Lord of the storm and lull, Lord of the sea, I am thy broken gull Blown out alee. Lord of the harvest dew, Lord of the dawn, Star of the paling blue Darkling and gone, Lost on the mountain height Where the first winds are stirred, Out of the wells of night I am thy word. Lord of the haunted hush Where raptures throng, I am thy hermit thrush Ending no song. Lord of the frost and cold, Lord of the north, When the red sun grows old And day goes forth, I shall put off this girthâ€” Go glad and free, Earth to my mother earth, Spirit to thee.
