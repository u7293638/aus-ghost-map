APPRAISING BA11XXON THE GREAT, When Blucher came to London he remarked on noting its vastness, " God, what a city to sack 1" This of course was because of its manifest wealth, which a writer in England has now endeavoured to estimate' by taking the durèrent Btreets and working up their supposed selling value. Under a separato heading "the great institutions" ho discovers that if put to auction to-morrow Mansion House would bring a million pounds and the Royal Exchange, with its land, two millions more. Eight of the bridges across the Thames this man of prosaic mind estimates as worth six millions, with another faur millions for the tunnels under the water. Then he unflinchingly deals with St. Paul's, *u in(-'n'erenfc to the ghosts of Wren and all the Deans of the past two centuries, reckons that if the people would sell lt he could obtain a syndicate to pay for its ownership the sum of fifteen million sovereigns. Aa to ! the Abbey he thinks it would go best as a kind of international raffle, in which case three hundred millions would be about a fair thing ; and if the Museum was thrown in this might be raised by another ten. Other important places he figures . out thus : National Gallery, £8,000,000 ; Crystal Palace, £2,000,000 ; Tower. £10,000.000 ; Hyde Park entrances, £3,000.000; Windsor Castle, £10,000,000; markets, £10,000,000; public gardens, sewers, viaducts, walks, pavements, etc., roundly at £100,000,000 ; grand total, say £500,000,000.
