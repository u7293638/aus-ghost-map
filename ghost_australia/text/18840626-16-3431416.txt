In their "palisade human sacrifice was" practised long after it had elsewhere disappeared. It was usual, in many lands, to build up a living human being in the walls of a new house, or to slay a child, and bury him beneath the threshold. The idea was that the ghost of the dead would guard the building, as it is still supposed to do in Roumania. Skeletons found within the walls of very ancient structures bear uncanny witness to the wide diffusion of this practice. Clearly a trade which had such arts needed a good deal of mystery. Mystery the early Masons doubtless possessed, though we are as far as possible from hinting that any such dark knowledge is in- herited by modern Freemasons. " In my opinion," says Socrates, " they who established the mysteries, whoever they were, knew much of human nature." Socrates, like Angelica in the "House and the king" was always right." The people who established the mysteries knew a great deal of human nature. Freemasonry gratifies the natural human love of having and keeping a secret. You cannot watch children at play for an hour but you will see three or four of them conspiring in a corner. They come out looking " arcane" (Thomas Taylor, the Plalonist, is responsible for the word), and satisfied, as if they had some deep esoteric knowledge to themselves. The other children observe this, and are maddened by curiosity and envy. Then the little ones who first clubbed together say, " We have a secret," and bear themselves proudly. This childish delight in a secret is at the bottom of all mysteries and Masonries. How many men, from Arnorius and Clemens to Creaser and Lubeck, have dashed their intellects against the mysteries of ancient Greece, trying to penetrate their arcana I How numerous are they who have tried to unriddle the spell of Konxompax, and asked what was in the sacred ark, or what the meaning of the mystic cakes ! Lobeck came pretty near hitting on the great secret that there was not any secret at all. He revealed the probability that there was next to nothing to conceal. No more than anticipated, what Maury has perhaps seen more clearly the discovery that the Greek mysteries were the relics of savage mummeries, meaningless, cruel, obscene. When the initiate of Dionysius waved serpents about their heads, they did what Red Indians are, only they used some, tangles reptiles, not rattlesnakes. When the Spartans scourged boys before the face of Artemis Oithia they did what Apaches do, and Kaffirs, and Australian blacks. When the Greeks whirled little slats of wood in their mysteries to make a roaring noise, and warn away the profane, they acted as Maoris act, and Zunis, Kamilaroi, and Kurnai. The molherof-Â¿Enchines, like any old negro woman or American squaw, daubed the initiate over with white clay. All these things are part of the famed mysteries of Greece, and part of the mysteries of the rudest barbarians. No noble secret was conceded or revealed in the original form of these rules, but the age of full manhood or womanhood was consecrated, or the adventures of some foolish deity wore acted in a mystery play. Doubt- less, labor Greece, about the time of Pindar, lent something of her own nobility to the ceremonies of the EleuBiuin. But, in the beginning, the mysteries concealed nothing worth knowing, any more than the area of our own Masonry are believed to hide important truths, good or evil.
