Dinner over it wa^ proposed that thev shoidd have a stroll along the sands, and then take coffee at the Casino. It was a brilliantlv moonlight night, and, every one agreed, except, the Countess Oaanne, who pleaded a migiaiiie and elected to have forty winks in a comfortable armchair till • the others came back. i When thoy went -out it, of course, fell to Hit, Kxcellency .to escort the Princes^; tile Prince excussd-hitu=elf on the plea of ; letter? whit^i he expect ed - by tl-ie evening train from Paris.

"Don't von think these nice snuglooking little harbours and the quaint old | fishing boats look a great deal nicer under j the moonlight than the 'plage' and tihat j glaring promenade with the electric lights, whete one sees the same costumes ovct and over a^iiin? For my own part 1 really cannot un'dej- stand why people should congregate in places like tdiat just to see each other dress up and show off—perhaps because tfliev can pav ior it and perhaps thev have credit for it. llea-lly, it all seems f vers' frivolous, doesn't it'"' j "My dear Miss Sarmento," replied Sir j Charles, stopping and looking at. the perfect youuc face as he saw it turaed up toto moonlight, "you must forgive me tor satiug that that is absolutely fc most seosible remark th«t I have ever 'heard from a young My who, like yourself, if I .nwyb? forgiven the phrase, has tive ball ot earta at her feet, blessed botli by nature and fortune, one who has simply to look upon the earth and all tha t therein is as an inheritance of delight." As he said this there urose in tine heart-; of the elderly beau a vague sort of hope that it might be ucst=ible to set liis long experience of men and things, his brilliant record at the Bar and on the Bench, his : assured fortune and even better assured j r social position, against this young loveliness for wlmdh wrthin the put few hours he bad • learnt to craw; so eagerly. He had bent down towards her a; he spoke: her Mflaughing lips seemed to invite the kise wihich -his were trembling to give, then 5ier eves moved quicWv from his, and she said— ""Reallv, Pr Charles, that is most delightfully put.
