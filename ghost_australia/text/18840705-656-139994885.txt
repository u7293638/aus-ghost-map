Just about then; you may remem ber, tho Araluen diggings, away up to the north'ard, were giving out, and tho number ot swagmen wo had making their w&y; over -to Gippsland was a oaution to snakes.

Almoat. But that same night, a, curious thing hap- 1 ' - h pened. Standing on tho verandah, I thought I saw a figure suddenly dart across thfe road from bolow the hut, into 1 the thiok pcrub. I don't know what possessed me, bht Hollowed leisurely in the direction ot the last night's oamp- I could see nothing, hear nothing, and on reaching the camp I was about to go back, fancying 1 my eyes had deceived me. Nothing, aid I say ? - But, by George, there was something. Somebody had been there before me. The ashes ot tho fire had been raked up, and still bore the marks of the scratching 'of human fingers. I stood still and listened. Not a sound, not even the falling of a leaf. I cooeyed. No answer. I searched the bushes, but could find no, trace, even of a trodden tussock or 3 broken branch. All waa still, silent as death. ' Now oomes the strange part of my story, andthoBe who don't' believe it can— do the other thing. For my part, I say and swear that it is true, unmistakably, literally, true, every word of it. ''About a week after I had found the knife, and.by .this time -If had, nearly . forgotten all ^bout the , whole affair, I was sent ont to find *)Ut,the, oamp'Of a mob of stray, cattle that .bad not been seeo for some days., I mounted my, brown mare .Jess; took with me ;a sharp, little collie slut that I had trained to track cattle, and iaway .I:itarted.-. First I went south, -:but ..could find' no trace ;.tben:I struok off for . .tho .. westward, and . after houfs . ol scrambling: upland down the -rugged spurs and. gullies : of : that rough country,: was lain to give it . up in, that ' direction. Keeping northward along the toofj of the range, I soon found myself in Bj part of . the oountry of which I knew next to nothing.' It was a wild, scrubby place, the last in whioh to find a oattle oamp, and yet I persevered; X knew theae:were a: valuable lot, and as Ihad often said that with.my dog I oould. hunt the beg gars out: anywhere, I :felt my reputation at stake, and determined to find the beasts, even ill had.to camp. out for. it. Hardly heeding -where. I went, I- travelled on' nntil nightfall, but,- as Iiknew the moon; whioh waa now in her third quarter, .would rise soon, I kept on my route. ; ? ? .. :? After a time. I got myself. I know not howf into a. thiok -tangle of low .scrub and open forest, which, seemed , to stretch on for miles. I was as one in a dream, and rode alowly forward,- almost unconsoious of where Iwas gomg. Tho moon had risen,- and her pole light showed me at a httle . distance a clump of thick timber, ..and into thia l rode boldly.:- Then, and hot till then, I realised that -I did not know where I was, .that, in fact, I wias bushed, and to make , matters worse,' whilst I waB ;in the. very -thiok of, it, a oloud suddenly covered the moon. StiU I rode a'.little further, -until .right in the very heart of the forest I oame to a swamp. Go-, ?ing back' was/suseless ; going forward 'impos-; sible; so I leisurely took off the saddle apd prepared to camp.' To my astohishment my mare was bathed in a foam ' of perapiration, .and was trembling in eyery limb like an' aspen leaf. JnBt then, too,, my dog, , whioh I noticed had crouched close ', to my .feet when I dis mounted, let- out a' long, dismal; une&rthly; howl, the like of which 1 had never heard be-, :fore, and which seemed to echo, and re-echo 'through the bush. .1 felt a queer sensation of -awe. and terror, creep , over me, my hair stif fened'on my head, and I oould feel my heart knocking, against my ribs at a feartui rate. . 'What was 'it ??: What was it t I appeared to.be in a.dismal blaok .pit, surrounded by a ring- of grinning,: gibing skeletons^ ; I knew these were but the white stems of the swamp gums', and yet . I was afraid even to look round, for fear l- should see something that should .blast my :very, eyeballa. -,:My horae waa trembling. more .violently than ever, and my dog: still,crouohed at' my feet, howled long ahd ilouu, and- more dismally : than before. I \- seemed to . be - gifted . with a second sense of sight; for although the moon was still clouded, I could see . everything : before, me, the' black reedy swamp, the white gums,;the waving tree tops beyond. ; Everything. - ; ;. '-A third time tne dog howled. and .this time so wildly, so weirdly, that I felt as if I should sink into the ground with horror. But ;Wbat was that;. Was it foot or:was it fanoy? 'I'dared not look, and yet-I could neither- turn my head nor close my eyes. - . : i . . , : ,- There, right before ,me, not - twenty yards away; I saw, as .it were, a ; mist -slowly riae from the stagnant swamp ; : slowly it grew, on my sight, slowly it formed, itself into a pal pable shape, the figure of a human being, of a man, pale . of ' face, but - with a' long brown beard sweeping over ita breast, thebreaat on which was a.. dark lurid' mark, from which, welled a red -stream. ! Slowly; oh, so slowly, its foatures became dearer - and dearer^ until they were' burned: into :my very brain.! Slowly it jlifted'.its hand, and then with.-a! qurious waving.cironlar motion, pointed.downward to. the spot on which it seemed to stand, ahd ' then as slowly , as it had grown. into'aight and ?form, melted away, first into mist, theii into impalpable air.. .'4 ? '???' ; ' Nof until it had vanished could jI; ihove. Not a . step.; .Not a movement of a limb. ': Bnt when .it; had gone, the;'BpeU;,waB , broken.' I uttered a scream, and flea the cCccarsed spot, I knew.nor reqked not whither. . Alljl'knqw is that I. fled, fled,, until .1 'fell down' from pheer exhaustion, and became insensible. . . ' When I oame to myself %I found myself in' my own bunk. They toldme they had missed me from'thb station;'had sent' out'all:hands to search for me, and had found me about .a. couple ot miles'nortH'ot the house, .lying near an old forgotten track into the baok country', a quarter of a mile from'itha road. ?' That I had had a. seyere atttok 'ot brain Ifever, in which I had raved wildly about 'the 'spirit in' tbb-swamp„but that theypouldmake neither head hor tail of what I meant'.
