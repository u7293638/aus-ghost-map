THE V.R.C. SPRING MEETING. THE MELBOURNE CUP DAY. Tho second day's racing of tlio Victoria Rac ing Club's spring- meeting takes place at Fiem- ington to-day, and as tho great Australian handicap of the rear, the Melbourne Cun. is in the programme, tlio interest felt in the day's proceedings is participated in by residents from Cape Otv..iy to Cape York, while in Tasmania and Now Zealand the result of tho race will be waited for with the greatest impatience. In addition to being unquestionably tho greatest raeo per of the year, tlio Melbourne Cup day is now universally admitted to be tho fashion able day iu the twelve months, and while those who are on the remotest outskirts of what is called society deem it a necessity that they should bo present, the votary of racing is impelled by tho importance of tho rnco to attend. Thus two classes with nothing in unison meet on a common ground, ami the bushman from the wilds of Queensland, the pearl fisher from Western Australia, and tho backwoodsman of our own colony, rub shoul ders with the Collins-street dandy and tho mel lifluous book maker whoso face evinces the predatory nature of his calling. When the late Mr. R. C. Eagot assumed the secretaryship of tho V.E.C. tho (dub was in a bad way, but tbat gentleman set to work with an energy peculiarly his own to mend matters. Cariug littlo for racing as a sport, ho saw that the first thing to be done was to frame programmes that would draw the crowd, and to this end ho labored. The conditions of tho Melbourne Cup wero made more liberal, so as to induce larger fields, and the ' indefatigable," ns ho was well named, then set about carrying out his own idea of liow to secure a big gate. Ry skilfully securing tho co-operation of somo of the lead ing ladies of tho community at that time, he made a name for the day in fashionablo circles, and in a very short time it was recognised with out dispute as tho show day of tho year. AVhilo this result was being brought about be was not unmindful of the interests of horso owners or tho general public. For tho former, training tracks were laid down in accordance with tho most approved principles, sheds were erected and ho kept a watchful eye to see where im provements could bo made, a beneficial altera tion having only to be pointed out to be carried out. P'or the public lio built a stand which, though it has been called Bagot's cow shed, is ouc of the most commodious and ac cessible . pointn oC vantage in tho world from which to view a race meeting. Tlie lawn was beautified beyond recognition, tho railway arrangements for the rapid con veyance of passcngors to and from the course were perfected, and the comfort of tho visitors to the hill was provided for to an extent which made this portion of tho reserves most popular with tho mass who were quite willing to pay 2s. or 3s. for tho privilege of seeing a day's rac ing in comfort from a position that gave them a splendid view of everything that was going on. Theresultof this wise and far seeing policy was soon made manifest. "Within a few years the Cup was socially and from a racing point of view universally admitted to be tho great day of the year. The profits on the meeting went up from hundreds to thousands and then to tens of thousauds, until to-day a larger attendance than over may be antici pated, with a corresponding increase of revenue. Tho affair has grown to its present di mensions entirely through Mr. Bagot's early action, as it is an open secret that he was tho Y.R.C.during his tenure of office. Matters wero of course referred to the committee,' who, satisfied with the secretary's ability and energy, gave him nearly varte bhmche, and tho result was as above slated. "Whether the day will ever outgrow itself and decline as the great re union of tho Australian public is a question that has often been asked ? but it may bo gene rally accepted that it only wants wise and judicious management, coupled with the ready recognition of tlie necessity for marching with tho times, to causo it to retain its popularity. True, tho Initiatory day of tho present meeting was marked by several mistakes that would not have beeu possible in Mr. Bagot's time, such for instance as the imperfect train service, and tho slough of (lespoud in which visitors had to stand while waiting for tlie return traius, tho presence of smokers in tho grand stand, aud ' allowing tho bookmakers to call tho odds in front of that structure — these aro matters that require remedying with out delay, and tho management might well take a lesson, from the Caulfield secretary in dealing with those minor matters which go so far to make up the success of a meeting. It is now twenty-four years since the first Mclbourno Cup was run, and on the first and second occasions it fell to a great New South Wales horse in Archer, who probably would iave won it a third time, but his acceptance arrived too late and he was not permitted to start. Banker was successful in 18G3, and then Mr. Fisher secured it tho following year with the fiying Lautern. The outsider Toryboy was next victorious, and stories of how virtuous cab men, dustmen, and others of that ilk, won their hundreds by his victory are rife to the present day. Mr. Jno. Tait then won his first Mel bourne Cup with tho mighty Barb, and another racehorse was to the front the following year when Tim Whifiler won. To this succeeded the respective victories of Glencoe, Warrior, Nimblefoot, The Pearl and The Quack, tho latter two, as well as Glencoe, being owned by Mr. .Tno. Tait, who was in great form just at thi9 period, and effected somo cOups that occasionally staggered the ring. Bon Juan appropriated tho prize in 1873, then came two indifferent animals in Haricot and Wol- lomni \ but Briesis, Chester and Calamia, Bar nwell and Grand Flaneur, who carried tho victories down to a later date, wero race horses in every sense of the term, and most of them seem now to ho transmitting their own brilliant qualities to their progeny. A cripplo.in Zulu won in 1831, and singular to relate thu second horse, the Czar, was also under suspicion, but throe great . horses in Assyrian, Martini Henry and Malua brings the record down to last year. Of tho twenty-four times the race has been run, it has only been won four times by liorsos who did not subse quently prove their excellence, and it may safely bo said that it wants a racehorse to win tho Melbourne Cup, tho exceptions we lmrc mentioned only going to prove tho rule. The winners of tho Derby who liavo subsequently won the Melbourne Cup wero Lantern in 1854, Briesis in 1878, Chester in 1877, Grand Flaneur in 1830, andMartini Henry iu 1883 ; and it now remains to bo seen whether Nordenfeldt can follow the brilliant example set him by thoso aboro named. Ho is undoubtedly a great borse, ho has won everything he started for, with tho exception of one race, where he was loft at the post, and though his tVtnes have not been fast, it was probably be cause he was not set a better pace, as he is notoriously a lazy horse, though one of the gam&sfc; and most determiued that ever trod a racecourse. Still he has to ineet a Jot of clinkers in Trenton, Kit Nubbles, Liverpool, Stornaway, Despot, Acolyte and Brown and Rose, in thoso above his own ago are favorably handicapped compared to him, and ho has to give two sterling colts like First Chester and Anc'ucster 7 and 12 lbs. respectively. Still a pound or two on a racehorse who is fit, makes little or no difference as was inntanced when Grand Flaneur gave a great horse like Progress a stone and beat him easily, and tbo.e who aro backing Nordenfeldt appear to us to have somewhat the best of it as com pared with any single horse in the race. Iu any easo a magnificent race should result, and there will bo tho usual excitement whilst the event is being run, and tho accompanying choruses of u I told you so' afterwards. To-day r programme will commence with the Railway Stakes, which starts at one o'clock. This is a weight for ago race of a ntilennda qinirter, and it will be succeeded by the Kens ington Stakes, for 2-year-olds, the winner to be sold for £300, but no selling allowances will be granted. Then comes the Hurdle Race, over three miles, and this will be followed by the Cup. After the great event the Nursery Handicap will be decided, aud the day's sport concluded with tho Yan Yean Stakes. Trains will run to the course at 9.20 a.m., 10.30 a.m., and thereafter, at short intervals till 2 p.m., and at 2.15, 2.30, 2.45 and 3 p.m. These latter trains will enable persons who cannot get away earlier to see the Cup, and trains will leave the racecourse immediately after that event is de- cided. The public are requested when return ing from the course to take the trains further from the entrance gate, ns it is now stated that on Saturday tho trains nearest the gate were rushed, while those lower down the platform which started first stood for a long time with out any one entering them, and eventually wore dispatched not more than half full, j A line of 'buses wift also bo laid on to the course, and cabs will also ply from Bouvke- street. Visitors will havo ample choice as to tho means thoy will adopt for reaching the course. The Railway department have had in view the delay which took place on Saturday, and we aro assured that ample provision has been made for all tlio tratfic which is likely to occupy the line to-day. On the course the Imperial Professional Brass Band will play a number of selections during the afternoon, aud arrangements havo been made by the secretary to ensure the comfort of ladies as tar as practicable. Tlie footpaths which wero complained about so much ou Saturday had 150 men employed on them yes terday consolidating and rolling so that thoy will he in excellent conditiou to-day. All the ingre dients for afternoon lea maybe obtained on the grouud, and the caterer, Mr. C. D. Strakcr, notifies that he is prepared to supply luncheon hampers. Tlie following is to-day's programme, and as there are good fields still left in for each oycut it only requires fine weather to make the Cup day of 1885 as successful as r.uy that preceded it : — RajlWsVY Stakhs (to start nt one o'clock), a sweep- stakes of 3 sows, each, 1 ft., with lOOiuUlcil. l or 3 yrs. old anil upwards.
