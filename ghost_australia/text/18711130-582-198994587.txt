MR BARLOW. Mr Barlow gave a second drawing-room enter- tainment last evening in the Theatre Royal, and although there were several other attractions, the house was well attended. Mr Barlow's efforts were the sensation comic song " The ghost," and the celebrated Scottish burlesque, with the inimitable " Blue- tailed fly," In all Mr Barlow was loudly applauded. Miss Chalker sang with much sensa- tiveness "The blind girl to her harp," and the pleasing ballad "Ah, never dream my love can change," as well as "Who's that tapping at the garden gate." Mr Verner, as Captain Jinks, and in "Dancing mad," as well as in the negro extra- vaganza, "Blooming morning glories," was, as on the first night, exceedingly good. Mr Rogers during the evening had ample opportunity for dis playing his dancing, which again well pleased the audience. It will be observed that the company perform at Fryers this evening, and at Guildford on Friday night, returning to Castlemaine on Saturday.
