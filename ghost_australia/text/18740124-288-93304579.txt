VICTORIA. [From our own Correspondent.] Melbourne, Tuesday, January 13. Sir George Bowen has dropped out of fashion- able society in Melbourne into more fashionable society in Hobart Town. His Excellency left for Tasmania early last week, and was met on board on his arrival by His Excellency Mr. DuCane, with his Private Secretary (Mr. C. M. Chichester), whence the party drove to Go- vernment House, whence Sir George is now stay- ing with the Hon. Seymour Egerton, second son of the Earl of Wilton, Lord Donoughman, and a large party of visitors. Attractive as Hobart generally is at this season of the year, this aristocratic gathering wll make it still : more so. Scions of nobility from England, however, are not always most estimable or desirable kind of visitors. — — — There has been an ad misericordiam appeal to the people of New South Wales here within the last few days on the part of the leading organ of the Protectionists against the adop- tion of the free trade tariff. This takes the peculiar up so much revenue sinuated, they can ill afford, and against their allowing the colony may thereby New South Wales business best, and will probably treat this as an attempt, and a vain one, to disuade them from the adoption of a sounder fiscal policy, lest it should operate as a check in the other colonies. Of this there are already very strong symptoms may be fairly taken as a proof of the alarm of the Protectionists, which, ''T'TOj.

We have long in these colo- nies been following the example of the wise men of Gotham, who built a wall round their country to keep the cuckoo in, and whoever takes the lead in demonstrating the folly of persistence in such a course is entitled to our thanks. Free trade in New South Wales must kill protection in the other colonies, and that the Protectionists of Victoria are beginning to find out. When Mr. Parkes has added to this a vigorous scheme of immigration they will find out that too. Everywhere the want of immigration is felt in these colonies, but we shall never get any worth speaking of so long as protection is in the ascendant ? Anti-immi- gration and protection are twin sisters all the world over. — — — The publication of the returns for the quarter and year ending December the 31st, 1873, form an agreeable supplement to the general resumé of the state of the colony at the end of the year.

Cteadi-, dates for future seats do sot ueem Inclined, » ibe instigation of the Protectionists, to commit themselves to any determinate course of action too soon. Dr. Thudicum, the author of a work on winemaklng, which the Press has years ago spoken of as the best that had ever appeared on the subject, has put his head into a nest of hornets. Attracted by this gentleman's great reputation, Mr. G. C. Levy, who was sent home with the contributions to the London Ex- hibition last year, and who, no doubt, thought of doing the colony a good turn by it, put the wine exhibits into Dr. Thudicum's hands, with instructions for tasting, for analysis, and for a report upon them. Nothing loth, the doughty doctor proceeded to discharge of this very delicate duty, and after pronouncing one of the samples to be musty and fusty, another sour and mouldy, and irreverently declaring that a third absolutely stank, he rushed away, without consulting with Mr. Levy, and got his report inserted in one of the London journals, little thinking what a genus irritabile the Victorian winegrowers are ; or, it may be knowing it, and yet caring very little about it. We are not bound to believe all hear about Dr. Thudicum's report on those samples of wine being the result of sheer spite because he was not appointed "wine-taster in ordinary" to Victoria, and paid £300 for an analytical and scientific report on our Victorian wines, which it is said he sought for unsuccessfully ; but this publication of his report is in wretched taste, and it t must be detrimental to his reputa- tion as a scientific man. The most severe con- demhaao&is;^ieaped upon a; wine 'supposeda to be Ja burg^^ffiatrby-ouT^Hef Seoretaiy, bfet ttfe dSftpppinteaicTiecinade a ttistake for there' ww ^o^ burgundy of -' Mr.r feancis's ^ongst^he'Bamples.' Th^ fRot is that there was reaUyttofslrsampleBof our wines.— After havingb^feocked about for months & the Bxhiblfion building, 'and Mr. G.

Butthey will not- ultimately be without ^theirrevenge.' Any further^ or tuture attempt atxdepreciaiion of their wines will be najB^renlpnlouHy stigmatised as a speoles .of "Thuddicumism." — — — The wanton destruction of our State forests is engaging the attention of the Commissioner of Crown Lands. The quantity of timber those "destroying angels," those "demons of destruc- tion" (as the papers have been calling them), the sawyers and splitters "waste" in getting at what they "want" is prodigious. Their licence have allowed them to roam over the forests without let or hindrance, and wherever they go they leave behind obstructions to the pro- gress of others, and do not fail to furnish fuel for the first bush fire that may be kindled. Attempts have been made now and then at the formation of temporary reserves, within which no timber should be out, but these have hitherto proved fruitless, and ever must do under the present free licensing system. Yet, to substitute for it the licensing of limited areas to particular individuals, with conditions as to the preservation of portions of the timber, : would not be without in difficulties, as Mr. ; Casey's experience in. tiie admtnlstratitfn of the i Icmfnftff BVIlt^Tn TDl€lfi7 jjIlQ ? sftltiT l ^kOs 2Ili!lSv IlftTO i &ughiSUm.; ^faas7nowevtt,'3utt^beehonayislt Up the neighborhood of some of the State forests,' pamedby the Seoretary of Agriculture1; andi the result tyu hoped will be the iBsue of more satisfactory ? anil;' ette^ve ' regulations which shall hot only put an md to present waste, but ensure the replanting of the denuded lands. — — — The Economist is anxious to have the statis- tics for this year taken as quickly as possible, especially the agricultural portion of them, lest the farmers and millers should be misled in their calculations, as they were last year. It is not likely, however, that we shall get them for two months at least. "The harvest," says that journal, speaking of last season, ' was a good one ; the average high for Victoria ; and five out of six interested in the matter con- cluded that the grain market would be over- crowded all the season, and the comparatively high price, so quickly after harvest, would be speedily reduced ; but month after month passed away, and all sorts of excuses were made why the wheats did not come forwards. The fact was, they were not in the country. The average per acre was good, but the acreage itself was most astonishingly reduced ; in some of the wheat-growing dis- tricts the area under grain was only half, and in others two-thirds of the usual extent, and we believe it will be the same this." Whether so p* not it is difficolt to say, but I inoHne -to beljeve that it will not, notwith standing the. authority on which the above opinion or belief is hazarded. . ^ ^t the same time it* must be admitted that agriculture is neitiier » mating, the. progress, it should , Saake herds, jsorr that ,we ^should all Jik© 'tbu see it making. — — — There have been very conflicting statements here as to the result of ceratin trails of Mr. Leoni's meat preserving process. We have heard^ for instance, that meat cured by this process was sent to England and pronounced there perfectly unsaleable and worthless. But this can be scarcely true, as Mr. Negus, Mr. Leoni's agent, stated at a meeting, held at Scott's Hotel, on Tuesday last, that no ac- counts had been received from England as to the meat sent there. However that may be, the trial of the meat preserved by this process «(p Scottf* So^bV on afgesaay '^a-^ oannitftlbe pflSfiOAQoaE ajsttccess, in ; w.hiteyer' lighfc we -«- , Kard'ik '^either, the suHsfcaBce nor the tex turfc ,-ofjit; wasrsuch &s; Jto nia-e ^a^ubBtitutie. fot fresh,. meat, if freah meat ;WeBR w-;be;had- «asUy,?,;aTlHjt,was; ^^^blMA^-'^ J»e. natUvbeforeAIr.

Mr. Philip King Tucker, of Ballarat, whom Weston was predecessor in that place, states "that while he was out, in front of the Post-Office watching for the night coach, the third night after Weston's death, he distinctly saw Weston's apparition, walking up and down several times, along the flags adjacent to the Post-Offica window.' Mr. Tdcker then wept- in And .lay...dowp, leaving the lamp burning. Iri the, ijourse ;pf a few mthates, 'the apparition,' he farther stages, a^ain appealed, aefeatareB quite diatinet, and thovery expresgionof countenancepalpftble ;and, -laying «ne i hand on the knob of the banj^ster, and' placing afoot on the first step«f the stairs, looked wistfully -at -him, and exclaimed, ~* Oh, Philip, I'm wretcheay wretched, wretched!'' To this; ikfr. Tucker adds,- 'that when he!ex tingulfihed the light, and lay down in bed,* a violent rush of ;wind, las in a storm, ckme through the room, and actually wider his bed.*' If this had occurred on the night of WeBtpn'« deatiu aad before1 Mr. Tucker knew anything ahout itthe story would havebeen more re liable, but one is disposed ta marvel at the coolness of the narrator all through these super natural visitations, and to ask, what he had taken for supper,
