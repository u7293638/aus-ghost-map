MORE BUYING POWER .'ON THE MARKET BEST WOOLS AGAINST BlJYERS--r-MANU FACTURERS' OPPORTUNITY TO PICK UP CHEAP WOOLS;-LONDON PRICES HIGHER THAN IN CONSUMES^ CENTRES-GETTING READY'FOR MORE TRADED--A .LOST OPPOR TUNITY -AND WHAT. IT MEANS-GREAT CONTRAST IN VALUES WHEN COMPARED WITH JANUARY--SELLING PRICES AND PRACTICAL NOTES ON CLIPS. (From Our Special Correspondent.) s . London, October 26. . Another week has passed, and still landon sale's are not at the end of their tether. If any one factor more than another has been pronounced this weekj it is that there ls more buying power In the market than what even the roost sanguine anticipated, and the spirit and tone is keeping well up to the best part of the series for all wools of a good desirable class. On one or two nights things dragged a little until some thought the market 'would ease off to a 5 per cent., but there has been a wonderful recovery vith ihe ap pearance of several fresh faces, and a firmer tone has this past few days characterised the sittings, which continue to be well attended by._both home and foreign contingents. Posslbily the cataloguing of some very good wools has had a good deal to do with calling forth all the buying power or the trade, caus ing the best wools to sell with increased firmness, while even faulty and the lower classes of merinos have met with more inquiry on Continental account. America has been a keen buyer for the best kinds of grease, and secured several lots, while the home trade has been indispensable throughout. Good scour ed parcels have sold fully up to the best rates of the series, being taken liberally both by France, and Ger-, many, the home trade cloth manufacturers likewise taking their>*full. share. _ This class of staple has, along with good shafty grease, often ruled against, buyers. Especially have New South "Wáles '* anet Queensland wools, been favored by all sections of the trade, the only exception being in scoured skin wools of faulty and heavy condition. 'Crossbreds all along have been in abundant supply, and sold fully equal to any time this-series.. Germany and America have taken increased quantities, Bradford buyers especially being hard pressed: - The best-grown coarse wools are favored mOBt by American buyers, Who have paid tcp prices, but medium and fine-haired parcels show no change. South African wools are relatively the slowest of sale, 'good grease and snow-whites selling the best, but withdrawals are frequent for short, heavy grease wools.. "When I wrote last week I stated that there was every prbspect of the sales easing a little towards the finish, but I am glad to say that, although Bhabby, earthy, tender wools are still drag ging, there ls yet a first-class demand for anything showing character and sound growth, bad-conditioned wools often being withdrawn or else sold at a buyer's own price. New England wools In Jacomb's sale . sold remarkably well, some fair quantities also being offered. Wool to-day Is pre-eminently the principal commo dity which stands ghost-like amid the numerous raw commodities which are called upon to fill the bill of the woollen and worsted manufacturers of Europe and America, and while many particulars relating , to the article stand to attract and draw, yet there are other features which are depressing - and galling. . From a manufacturer's standpoint, the principal features, which are pleasing are the 'cheapness of the article and the ability to almost pick and choose where one likes, but there Is a corresponding depressing feature in the lack of sufficient trade doing' to warrant h'.m In buying heavily, although prices are so very reason able. It must be said that markets on this side of the globe are still struggling in the slough of de-p-nd, and, although a casual visit to the Wool Exchange would, indicate (judging by. the shouts and gesticula tions bf buyers), that nothing but a robust state was the chief characteristic of the trade, yet, I say can didly, that all this noise and din, bustle and confu sion, offers no criterion to the slow, quiet; depressed conditions which prevail In manufacturing centres. Il London's voice, however, can be believed, there either ls, or there ls expected to be, more trade doing, than any man can see by a viBit to the Wool Exchanges of either Bradford, Roubaix, Antwerp, or the wool warehouses of BoBton. I rather incline to look for the silver lining in this state of gloom and darkness, which has filled all markets for the past nine months, and, judging by the attiude of London, there ls "a decent trade In store now that prices aTe nearing a working level, and brokers are willing to let wool go at a market price. I, firmly believe that if tops of a íO's quality had. never reached over 2s per lb, instead of 2s Od, that all through this year wool would have continued steady ' at the former figure, and also all through the year a good trade would have been done. Instead of that, markets are still figuring at a very low level indeed, - and likely so to do yet .a while.. Since my previous letter the continuance of the Lon don wool sales have marked another epoch in the wool trade, and what the verdict, bas been is well-known to ail your readers. If I may say so, there is about this present series of sales less uncertainty, and less teme rity in men's minds concerning tho touching of bot tom prices than at any. previous sales held this year, uhe fact that we are now back at prices which were ruling in August, ' 1897, inspires men with confidence . tha t merl noes are as cheap as they are going to be, seeing that the stocks held by manufacturers are only reasonable, and the certainty of another material shrinkage in supplies from Australia. The way Lon don sales are going "caps" everybody in consuming centres, the verdict here being that those who are buying merino wools,-are acting .rashly, and that they will be called upon later to pay the piper. There is a consensus of opinion among all topmakers who have been down to London that it is impossible to buy wool to produce a top that will cost anything less than 19d per lb. but such a price ls absolutely, unobtainable among any English spinners. Personally, I rejoice to see things going in London as they are, for it gives the snub direct to the^poor poverty Ideas which some topmakers have concerning what should be the price of 60's tops. When men see that , they cannot produce this article at present" off erings, they will not be so squeezable as they recently hove been, and the ten dency «or à little firmer-rates In London for the best wools, is bound to have a good effect-upon prices. The great want in consuming centres is. an increased de mand from merchants and clothiers for the manufac tured article, the glut caused last year through every mill and factory running over-time, and producing ex cessive quantities of goods; having not yet been worked off. Among Yorkshire manufacturers, speaking gene rally, there ls a fair trade doing; mills are being fairly well run; but there is not that consumption of pure merino wool that could be desired, mungo ancL. cotton particularly being consumed In very large quantities. If the public the wide world over could be Induced to wear nothing else but pure-wool goods, and refuse to buy the cheap adulterations which are so tastefully prepared to please the eye, every ounce of wool pro duced In the world would be consumed In twelve months' time. Growers would receive . an enhanced price, and there would be a permanency about values, in which a slump like we have seen would be an un known thing, I have spent considerable time In comparing the sell ing prices in the series last January with what, has been made this last \feek for the Identical wools, and in the tables below a fearful state of things' ls re vealed. The first mark ls a weH-known clip from South Australia, Messrs. H. Schwartze and Company offering these very wools on January 17 last, when 538 bales were withdrawn. I calculate that if Schwartze's had sold this clip at the prices then bid. the grower would have received something like £5000 more than he will now receive as the returns from his wool this week.
