POETRY. GOOD NIGHT. God keep you sale, my love, All through the nicht; Rest close in II 1b enclroled arma Until the Hellt. BIy heart ยก8 with you as I kneel to pray Good night 1 God keep you in Hie care alway. Thick shadows creep like silent ghosts About my head ; I lose myself in tender dreams, While overhead The moon comes stealing through the window bars, A silver sickle gleaming 'mid the stars. For I, though I am lar away, Feel eofe and strong To truBt you thus, dear love-and yet Tile nicht is long. I say with sobbing breath the fond, old prayer: Good night, sweet dreams, God keep you everywhere.
