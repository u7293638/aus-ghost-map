EbentZer Ward, who has never been able to escape the habit of taking broad national views, remains like a ghost to remind of days long ago, an anachronism, a type of legislator who is dead and buried, and'whose grave is forgotten and neglected. Yet in the company of garrulous roads and bridges delegates stand forth a uniqne quartette in Australia, leaden of men, trusted of the people, gifted with capacities larger than the sphere of their opportunities, intellects not unworthy to compare with the best in the British Parliament. I refer to the Premiera who have;? broken local records in the length of their rule from Sydnev to Perth. In no, previous passage of Australian -history jrlll you find a parallel to the combination of intellect, jsagadty, and pblltaoalforce' amongst contemgDranedua Premiers of the four colonies. Whatever may be their indlvidnal faults, they have this claim in common to the qratitnde of the people that 4hey bave given their people state government.

J. Holder another clever brother. The Holder family, springing from a school teacher, is one of pronounced ability, most of them endowed with a musical talent. Of wordly goods they had little, but In power to command position and respect they were rloh Indeed. Mr. F. W. Holder Is marvel loisly well informed and ready. No other Minister oan vie with him In the despatch of business, The Hon. J. H. Gordon told me that when he was Chief Seoretary and required to be posted on Inirldate matters relating to varlons depsrtments he fpnod Mr. Holder an lntelligepoe bureau upto date. And no one Is more amiable than Mr. Holder, more unatsumiog. He. Is a trifle too clever In argument, for Intense 1 Ingenuity evaporates the softening Influence of aluoerlty, and a too topple hand cannot bold a tnrbnlent House with unrelsnUng grasp ; as his Chief can. . n- ?: '-. c %'sH no ^ *.
