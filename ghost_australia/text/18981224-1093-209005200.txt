HAUNTED HOUSES. What is most interesting about haunted houses is the persistence of the types, of "haunting"â€”the steps, knocks, and rat- tling chains. From ancient Egypt and Assyria to the Dyaks, the Australian blacks, the Burmese, the Incas, the "Vik- ings of the Sagas,, through Ted worth,. Ep- worth (the Wesleys' Rectory), Willington Mill (the Proctor's), through "Brownies,'' in Major and Kirk, to yesterday's news- paper, haunting is always "the same old game." In dozens of cases, the tricks by servants, children, or smugglers, have been actually discovered. In other examples, rats, cats, wind, water, have been detected in the act, as when Mr. Pepys apprehended "a spright;" and only found our young gib- cat." Yet, while verae causae have been established, it is not quite honest to shirk the fact that often all search has failed in the most famous examples. The Wesley . bogey is well known. The evidence is documentary, respectable, at first hand,, and no system of explanation yet advanced is worth a brass -button. Something may, indeed, be done, if we start from noises caused by tricks, and then suppose that fear and fancy may set up a train of hallucinations. Any reader of old Mr. Wesley's letters and diary may read one of the best ghost stories ever written. He was, of course, Samuel, the father of the celebrated John and Charles Wesley, and the whole family, including his famous sons, were witnesses of the doings of the "ghost," and their testimony is of the most undoubted order.
