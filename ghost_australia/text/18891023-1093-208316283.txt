PQETRY A "WAYSIDE FLOWER. ^Vith a happy sigh I wonder why One little sprig of a wayside flower, With color and acent sweet as content, Should Eoothe my Boul likeifBptill of pojrsr. A slim white vase of antique grace My shred of autumn brightness hold*, Just where a'glance of eun may chance To kindle its misty greens and golda, Dark was the day.the skies were grey Withthreatening cloudB and feints of rain, And over hill the wind, withjhrill Lament, came to my lattice pane. V Alas," I said,"the flowers are dead, The guBty woods are Bhaken bare; Wan BadneasB chills the distant hills There is no brightness anywhere." Then in my. handihis fragile strand Of bloom some one dropped carelessly; I could not hide the rushing tide Of tears that roBe and blinded me. A glance-a word-may touch Bome ohord Of life long hidden, and dumb-, and cold, And quicken and-wake some dead heartache To the grief and longing we kne w of old, ; So Bweet to me as the memory Of one who gladdened the bygone years, - The strange perfume of this bit of .bloom Thrills me with a passion of. joy.and tears. And .the long lost ways of the vanished daya With sudden glory grow plain and bright, And I wander through the Bun and dew ?' With the beautiful ghosts of my youth to night, The darkness falls on the cottage walla, y . The wild rains beat and the rough' winds blow; With a happy sigh J wonder.why The soul withm na is fashioned so That in the gloom my narrow room Shines with a glory of dreams long fled, Because this spray, from some dim way . Afield, hath power to wake the dead. .. ROOK, Adavale, Quee'nalani.
