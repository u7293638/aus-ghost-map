A Mistaken Case of "Bearing Testimony/ — So soon as liberty of worship was proclaimed in Spain, the Bible Society sent out four magni ficently bound Bibles in English, to Prim, Topeto, .. Serrano, and Zorilla. It was quite immaterial to - the Society that, bemg Roman Catholics, these gentlemen could not use the Protestant version any more than our Queen and Princes could use the Douai version, if sent to them by Antonelli or the Pope himself ; still more immaterial that,. being Spaniards, they probably could not under- _ stand a word of the English text. The use of the gift counted for nothing : " bearing testi mony," at the cost, say, of £5 a. Bible, was all they cared for. We are sorry to grieve these zealous proselytisers by informing them that nob one of their Bibles reached its ultimate destina tion — the private house of the Minister. They were taken to the respective offices over whicb. these gentlemen presided, and left there as 8 monument of English sagacity.

The Totter Ghost.— The Fall Mall Gazette stated a few days ago that the shadow of an axe was visible nightly on one of the buildings of the Tower of London. On examination it has Rinpq turned out that the imaginary axe is simply a reflexion out of a long slit of window. Neverthe less a correspondent of the Fall Mall Gazette writes " I am glad to perceive bv vnnr Friday that the Tower of London, respectable old edifice as it is, still keeps its ghost, as all venerable buildings should do. You are perhaps not aware t hat one of the best authenticated ghost stories of this century belongs to that foitress and T make no excuse for fallinnr if — . . - ' juu season, as a Christmas ghost story is traditionally I allowable. Mr. Edward Lenthal Swifte, who is still living, was in 1817 keeper of the crown! jewels iu the Tower of London. He lived in the jewel-house, and on a certain Saturday nigkfc in October, 1817, was in his sitting-room. The J door was closed, the windows shut, and heavy curiain8 excluded the air. It was about night. Two candles were on the table. The rest I give in his own published words "I gate afc I the foot of the m hi# bif unr 1 — — i "J -vu Aiijt XlglUl hand, his mother fronting the chimney-piece, and her sister on the opposite side.. I had offered a glass of wine and water to my wife, when on putting it to her lips, she paused and exclaimed, " Good God, what is that ?" I looked up, and saw a cylindrical figure like a glass tube, seem ingly about the thickness of my arm, and hover ing between the ceiling and the table. Its con- tents appeared to be » dense fluid, whe and pale tore, like to the gathering of a summer cloud, and incessantly roliing and mingling within the cylinder. This lasted about two minutes, when it began slowly to mare before my sister- in-law, then following the oblong shape of the table be fore my son and myself ; passing behind my wife, it paused for a moment orer her right shoulder (observe, there was no mirror opposite to her in which she could then behold it) Instantly she crouched down, and with both hands covering her shoalder, she shrieked out, "O Christ! it has seized me." Even now, while writing, I feel the fresh horror of that moment. I caught up my chair, struck at the wainscot behind her, rushed up stairs to the other children's room, and told the terrified nurse what I had seen. . . . Neither jnv sister-in-law nor my soa beheld this appear ance. ... I am bound to add that shortly before strange event some young lady resident in the Tower had been, I know not wherefore, sus pected of making phantasmagorical experiments at their windows, which, be it observed, had no com mand whatever on my windows in my dwelling. a 'ti additional sentry was "accordingly posted so as to overlook any such attempt; Happening, however, as it might, following hard at heel the visitation of my household, one of the night sen tries at Hie jewel office was, as he said, alarmed by w figure like a huge bear issuing from under neath the door. He "thrust at it with his bayonet, which stuck in the door, even as my chair dinted the wainscot. He dropped in a fit, and was carried senseless to the guard-room. His fellow-: sentry declared that the mas was neither asleep nor drunk, he himself having Eeeri hiin the moment , before awake and sober. Of all this I avouch nothing more than that I saw the poor man in the guard -house prostrated with terror, and that in two or three days the fatal result, be it of factor of . fancy, the man died." To this it is only neces sary to add that the boy was seven years old. He did not see the ghost. The sister-in-law likewise did not see it, and attributed it to the joint hal lucination of her sister and brother-in-law. The Eoldier died, as stated, whether after trial by court-martial, as recorded by Dr. Gregory in his "-Letters on Animal Magnetism," or not, I do not know. Dr. Gregory received his aecountr from Sir David Brewster, and it is incorrect in many particulars, or rather it differs from Mr. Swiftens, which was the result of personal experience."
