The Princess of Wales ami the Cihost. Mr. Jo quin Miller, the American poet, whon on a recent visit to New stead Abbey was curioiis about the famous ghost in the tower — tho appari ation ' in cowls and sand sandals ' whom Byron gravely claimed to havo seen a short time bofnv his ill-st.nmwl marriage. So, it appears, are most pilgrims to this ' home and haunt ' of an English poet — the Princess of Wales not exceptetl. Mrs. Webb, wife of Colonel Webb, the present proprietor of the Abbey, is Mr. Miller's authority for the 'comic little incident ' which befell tho Princess on the occasion of her recent visit. Tho three rooms in the tower — in which, by the way, Mr. Miller contrived to pass a night, with out, however, seeing anything super natural — are reached by ascending a narrow spiral staircase, and have no other ingress or egress. It happened that two servant maids were in the rooms when the Princess, at the head of her party, ascended, and laughing at the idea of meeting a ghost, entered iinheralded. Passing through the dressing room, and then the spacious bedroom, furnished as far as possible with the appointments used by the poet, she passed on to the page's room and here she poked her parasol into a deep, dark, curtained alcove, saying to tho party pressing after her, 'But. I want to seo the ghost.' Horrors ! the point of her parasol struck a solid body. There was a screech and a scream, and the Princess sank into tho arms of the Prince of Wales, while a pretty rosy maid fall forward before the Princess, piteously begging her pardon.
