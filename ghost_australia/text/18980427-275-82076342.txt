CHAPTER VIII. Rachel, in the aftertime, never remem- bered how she turned at last from the silent dell through which that phantom voice had seemed to come to her. The lamps in the old Abbey were already lighted, its many windows glowing cheerily through the autumnal gloom, when at last she crossed the open lawn, and so reached the stone bridge over the moat. A man was standing at the other corner, as though he had just come from the glass doors opening into the study, and had paused in uncertainty on seeing her. The next moment she had recognised Eric, and in her doubt and uncertainty went towards him eagerly. She had once distrusted him, but that distrust had long since been forgotten. Everyone spoke so well of him, and was he not soon to be Ella- line's husband and her brother? She felt the need of a man's help, a man's strong common- sense, to aid her in this crisis, and to whom could she turn if not to him? "Is that you, Rachel?'" he asked, as she came from the archway to his side. "What a ghostly little figure you look in this dim light, with your pale face and grey dress. I quite thought, for the moment, that I saw the family ghostâ€” is there not a legend of a lady who died of a broken heart in those old ruins in the dingle, and of her lover who dis- appeared? I am sure I have heard that the Friar's Dingle is the walk of a ghost of some sort.' (To be continued.)
