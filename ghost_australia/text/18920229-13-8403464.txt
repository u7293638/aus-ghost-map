ARCHBISHOP CARR'S LENTEN PASTORAL. The following is the text of Archbishop Carr's I unten Pastoral which was read in all the Catholic churches of the archdiocese of Melbourne at each of the services yesterday - Pastoral Letter to the Clergy and Laity of the Archdiocese of Melbourne for I ent, 1892 Beloved Brethren, The object of the Church in commanding the observance of Lent is the ofold-first to keep before the mind of her children the spirit of the Gospel of Christ and secondly to provide them with suitable and salutary means for correspond- ing with that spirit The spirit of the Gospel of Christ is a spirit of sell denial of self restraint, and of self sacrifice It is the same spirit which shone with radiant beauty round the stable at Bethlehem and which was crowned with immortal glory on the hill of Calvary It is the spirit which was illustrated in every stage in the life and enforced in every phase of the teaching of the 1 founder of Christianity Of 1 him it was true during his life on earth that while the birds have their nests and the foxes their holes the Son of Man had not whereon to lay His head And of His followers the test He required was if any man we will come after Me let hinidpnyhiniselfandtnkeup his cross and follow Me -Matt xvi 2-1 It is the spirit which was preached by the Apostles and rigorously practised by the first professors of the Christian religion It is the spirit -hath made the great Apostle of the Gentiles chastise his body and bring it into subjection list whilst he preached to others he himself should become a custom as I Cor ix 27. It is the same spirit which at a very early, if not in the apostolic age led to the obst rv ance of Lent as a special season of fast and abstinence of pray to and almsdecds This spirit and this observance have been observed without interruption in the Catholic Church down to the present day, and thus forms one of the connecting 1 mis- between the church of the first and the church of the nineteenth century This spirit of self denial and self sacrifice is a necessary consequence of the fallen condition of human nature, which makes man s life a warfare upon earth, and which has occasioned a constant conflict between the lower appetites and the higher desires of man's nature As long as HUB conflict continues and it will continue as long as man lives on earth so long will it be necessary for those who desire to live according to the spirit to mortify the deeds of the flesh Mortification is the object of the fast and abstinence prescribed during the time of Tent the same degree of mortification is not prescribed for all indiscriminately The church has regard to the necessities and to the requirements of the different classes of her children Thus the young, or those who have not completed their twenty first year the old or those who are over 60 years of age those who are suffering from sickness an 1 those who are engaged in laborious work are not required to fast As lusting regards the quantity of food allowed there is no limit set to the quantity which may be used by such persons. The law of abstinence on the other hand regards the quality of food which may be taken and binds all who are not either exempt by reason of illness or freed from the law by the dispensation of the Church By virtue of the Papal Induit we are authorised to grant large dispensations in the law of abstinence for the approaching Lent But it should be remembered that it the law of abstinence be so considerably relaxed in modern times it is only because the human constitution is no longer able to bear the severer austerities practised in earlier times and because it is expected that compensation will be made in regard to other good works - particularly prayer and nlmsdeedB -for what is remitted in the matter of abstinence Amongst the good works to which I would particularly direct your attention the completion of St Patrick s Cathedral holds at present the first place you remember the enthusiasm with which the project was undertaken two years ago _ you bear in mind the (i ii rai desire then expressed, that in completing the life work of a venerable and self sacrificing priest the most suitable and enduring monument should be at the same time raised to his memory he young looked towar 1 with confidence and the old with hope to the day when thousands would throng transept and nine and aisles of the completed cathedral, when the solemn rite of consecration would transfer the building from the dominion of man to the perpetual service of God and when in presence of a vast array of prelates priests and people, the Lord of Glory would for the first time take possession of His completed temple Since this wonderful progress has been made Although little more than a year has passed since the contract for the completion of the cathedral was signed already nearly half the entire work has been finished Hitherto the Building Committee has been able to pay the contractor the instalments as they fell due up to the last But now the current expenses of the work are exceeding considerably our resources We therefore have earnestly to appeal for continued and prompt assistance We appeal to those who have already promised a yearly subscription to send in their donations for this year on or before St Patrick s Day And we appeal to those who have not as yet contributed or promised to contribute to aid the good work and to bear a mans part in completing a majestic cathedral which as a work of art and a work of reason will be the joy of the present and the admiration of the future generations, of Australian Catholics Hitherto the burden of expense has been boniL chiefly by the city and suburban Catholic residents in the near future a special appeal will be made to the country districts so that city and country also Qmaj share in the accomplishment of so meritorious a work My desire is that every Catholic family in the archdiocese should contribute to the setting of at least one stone in that sacred edifice I desire to take this opportunity of expressing, my grateful thanks to the members of the cathedral building committee and especially to the gentlemen who have so zealously acted as collectors for the harmony ml and perseverance with which they have worked during the past year And as to the contributors of the large amount received during the year I can only pray, as I shall always pray that the Almighty may Renew upon them a very special blessing and reward Another good work to which attention may be appro privately directed during the I enter time is the support and encouragement of our Catholic schools this support and co couragement may be given either by assisting in the building of new schools or by contributing to the endowment of scholarships exhibitions, or prizes intended to stand late the industry of children attending Catholic schools and to redress to some extent the injustice that is being done by excluding them from competition for prizes with the chil- dren attending state schools. The number and i efficiency of our schools are steadily me leasing the multiplication of schools taught by religious bodies is one of the compensations given by Uodsgoodpio valence for the sacrifices which Catholic parents are called on to make rather than activity the first duty they owe to their children Quite recently there has been purchased at a cost of Â£2 500 a site for a Christian Brother s school so situated as to make it available for Crown boys living in Collingwood Abbotsford and pint of last Melbourne The Clnisium Brothers have an Ii uni can to collect funds for the erection of a school, and we earnestly solicit cooperation both in the payment for the site and in the erection of the s wool 1 richly to Catholic principles, person verence in self sacrifice and the assertion of our claims on every suitable occasion will ultimately lead to the locog nation of these claims by the legislature, and to the concession of that assistance to our schools of which they have been so long unjustly deprived it is a mere pretence transparent as it is disingenuous-to urge that the concession of the Catholic claims would subvert the whole system of state education and deprive Catholics of the advantages they now enjoy under the net On the contrary we are persuaded that the recognition of the Catholic schools would be the means of improving the sy st nr of state education It would enable the non Catholic lehgiousdcnommivtions first to agree among themselves about the amount and manner of religious instruction to be given in the state schools and then to appeal to Parliament with a united voice for the recognition of Christian teaching in our primary schools A non Catholic can lid the for Parliamentary honours was very recently asked at the close of his speech whether he would advocate such a chance in the 1 Education Act as would allow the introduction of Scripture lessons within the school hours His reply was straightforward and worthy of the attention of non Catholic uni Catholic can li lutes alike -as he said in substance provided that justice in the matter of education is done to our Catholic fellow citizens otherwise I shall oppose the introduction of any Scripture lessons in the State schools Although total abstinence from intoxicating drinks is not commanded by the law of the church still the time of Lent li specialty suited for the spread in 1 advancement of the I engine of the Cross The Holy league has done incalculable good since its intro- duction into the field oces Thomas Is have been sanctified by the generous sacrifice they have made in abstaining from drink in honour of the sacred thirst at Christ on the Cross By their example and by their prayers they have been the means of making Land many a home to which sobriety ' arl long, been a stranger the usual procession of the members of this league will take place on the Sunday preceding St Patrick s Day We have observed with pleasure that it ninga.me-the Australian Magazine of the League of the Cross devoted expressly to the advocacy of the cause of the League of the Cross, was recently appeared, and has already given promise of becoming a strong auxiliary in fichociitino; the aims and advancing the cause which the members of the league life at heart 1 mall), let uSj dearly beloved brethren, during the time of Lent, be earnest in pray ei If possible let each family unite in the evening prayer AMiere even two or three are assembled in Christ's name, there He is in the midst of them Where father and mother and children and servants are united in evening prayer, there will Gods year be attentive to their sup- plications " The grace of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all Amen ' -(II Cor tin , IS) We remind, dearly beloved brethren, your faithful servant in Christ, -rlllOMlS JOSEPH, Archbishop of Melbourne February, 1892
