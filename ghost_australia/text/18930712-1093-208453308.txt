UNIONISM. TO THE KDITOK. Sir—" Huxley's Ghost No. 2" is a long long way behind the times as to his information, or else, as I rather suspect, is drawing on his imagination for his facts. It seems almost childish to contradict such absurd statements as he makes, and yet I suppose that there are somo who otherwise would think they were correct. I defy him to name a single case in modern times—say in the last 50 years—in which a strike has been decided and ordered by the leaders. In all cases it i3 the men them selves who decide the matter, and too often alas ! in a way directly contrary to the advice and wishes of the leaders. The beautiful simplicity with which ho acknowledges to having accepted as gospel what a Melbourne hotel waiter told him shows how easily any one who got hold of him might stuff their goose, while the repulsive cowardice of the man is proved by the way in which he flings dastardly libels anonymously at a class of self- denying hard-working men whose shoes he is not worthy to blacken, and against no one of whom he dares to bring any such ac cusation over his own name. -1 am, &o.;, JOHN N. BIRRS. Porb, July 11,1893.
