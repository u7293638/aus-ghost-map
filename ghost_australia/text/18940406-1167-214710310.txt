THE BRAKEMAN ON FREETHINKERS. " MAT be you joined the Freethinkers ? " I said. " Scrub road," said the brakeman, " dirt road-bed and no ballast; no time-card and no train despatcher. All trains run wild, and every engineer makes his own time, just as he pleases. S.uoke if you want to ; kind of go-as-you-please road. Too many side tracks,' and every switch wide open all the time, with the switchman sound asleep, and the target-lamp dead out. Get ou as you please, and get olF when you want to. Don't have to show your tickets, and the conductor isn't expected to do anything but amuse the passengers. No, sir, I was offered a pass, but I don't like the line—I don't like to travel on a road that has no terminus. Do you know, sir, I asked a division superintendent where the road run to and he said he hoped to die if he knew. I asked him if the general superintendent could tell me, and he said he didn't believe they had a general superintendent, and if they had he didn't know any more about the road than the passengers. I asked him who he reported to, and he said 4 Nobody.' I asked a conductor who he got his orders from, and he said he didn't take orders from any living man or dead ghost. And when I asked the engineer who he got his orders, from, he said he'd like to see anybody give him orders ; he'd run the train to suit himself, or he'd run it into the ditch. Now, you see, Sir, I'm a railroad man, and I don't care to run on a road that has no time, makes no corrections, runs nowhere, and has no superintendent. It may be right, but I've railroaded to long to understand it."— BnrUntj- ton Hxwleeye.
