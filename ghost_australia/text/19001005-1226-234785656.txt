A Ballad, of the Breelong Blacks Through England's fields they hunt the fox, In Scotland the deer clmso they ; In Ireland they whip the salmon loclis From the dawn to the dusk of day. And India's sportsmen stick the pig And follow the tiger's trackB ; But where on earth is a sport ns big As hunting the Breelong'Blaeks ? For the earnest fox must e'er long be cooked, And the deer lasts a day' at most, And the heaviest salmon that ever was hooked Must soon give up the ghost ; And the galloping Arab soon beats the boar, And the man-eater soon cries " Pax !" But men must go, as they go to war, To hunt for the Breelong Blacks. You need a quarter million of men When a country of Boers you hunt ; But how many coppers are wanted when You've a couple of men io front? Tlie boys in blue, tlioy're out by mobs, And no uhiid but the bnsil lie whacks, 0 I it's one of the merriest, muddlingest jobs, This chasing a couple of blacks. They track them down, and tliey see them plain, Tliey run them from tree to tree ; But the Breelong Blacks still proudly main tain That their land is (lie land of the free. Tho Parliament payeth tho Force full-well, And the Public payoth.tho tax, And the traps get a lot of it, so men tell," But they don't get the Breelong Blacks I Tliey teli us that focmen threaten onr shore. That they'll march to our mountains blue ; So let's hope bine mountains are useful more Thau men of a similar line. For -at present we're feeling somewhat alarmed, As, though scrub and ridges and tracks Are alive with police and civilians armed, They ouu'C deal with two Droeloug Blacks,
