He was a son of a clever water-colour artist at Sandhurst, and feeling a strong propensity for the stage, ho took to it in early lite, and commenced his career in Victoria, where his talent for mimicry enabled him to become a great favourite, more particularly in Melbourne. * His imitations of Dr. Alex. Hunter, Mr. Charles Jardine Don, M.L.A., and Dr. Macadam, M.L.A., were the delight of large audiences at the old Princess Theatre, where he also created the part of Micawber, in a version of David Copper- field' which he compiled himself. After playing for some years in the colonies, where he . also had some, experience in theatrical management, he proceeded to England. There he fulfilled a professional engagement, and proved successful in the character of Micawber, which he had by this time elaborated and refined. Thence he crossed over to the United States, where he made his mark, both as an actor and a dramatic author. He married in America, and not long after his union his wife underwent mental derangement.
