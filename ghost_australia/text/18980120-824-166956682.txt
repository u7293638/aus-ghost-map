SHORT STORIES. A Real Hero. A neat story is going the rounds about a certain gallant officer of volunteers who was persuaded by a couple of old hands to watch the shell practice from the observation place near the targets. After a few shells had been fired, one of the officers, a bit aof a wag, at a moment when a shell struck the target and exploded, shied some loose dirt at the dashing militaire. The effect was instan taneous. Down he went on all fours, and, carefully creeping along in a trench running from the observation place to the rear, he managed to save his carcase, as he thought, from being messed up generally. He looked as white as a ghost, and nothing would induce him to visit that observation place again during shell practice. When those in the " know" con gratulated him on his marvellous iescape, he is wont to say, " Tes, bai Jove, it's the narrowest shave a man ever had, but you bet I ain't going to risk my life in that way again "â€” -N.Z.
