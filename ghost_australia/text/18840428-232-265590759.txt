A MANCHESTER FOG. (BT MR L- STAN5FIELB ) In consequence ul the great number of factories, workshops, a ad building-, ot all sorts in the district of Manchester, it is at best an obnoxious place. It seems to be always enveloped in smoke, but during tbe month of November, while i was there, it was something abominable The atmosphere 13 so thick of fog, and otherwise of a depressing nature, that it fairly boats down tbe smoke into tbe streets, and no matter which way we look ths ends of the streets are, as It were, blocked up with it. At twelve o'clock noon on tbe 16th of November, it was blacker Jthsn I had ever aeen it. The streets were full of smoke, aod it looked as If nigut was coming quickly on. Host ot tbe shops and places of business were lighted up, and there was a doom about tho place mat was dismal to look upon: the sky was dark and thick, and breathing was difficult and snffociting. The worst bnsb-Sre that ev6r surrounded: Ballarat never produced anything to equal Jt The people in tbe streets moved about like ghosts, and appeared more like the inhabitants of the lower regions tban those of earth. Looking up at the darkened sky and thÂ»n below at tbe objects wound, It seemed a<if the Day of Judgment had arrived, and one could not belp picturing to, one's self those awe-striking pictures when "the a sbatl be darkened, the moon tuned to blood, and the earth shall melt with fervent jwat" After abont fibres. quartefS of ah hour some of tbe dark cloud- lift, a little light is given, bat stai thure set remains a" miserable dirty, murky sky.
