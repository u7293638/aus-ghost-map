TOMMY ATKINS'S GHOST. Tbe passage leading to the mortuary attached to a military hospital in India was formed of timbers similar to railway sleepers placed end up, and securely fastened to cross rails. A defunct warrior occupying; tbe duadhouse, a sentry, in accordance with regulations, was posted at tbo end of the passage. After about a quarter of an hour's ' sentry go '' this man appeared at the guard-room door, and, pitch ing his riflu into the arm-rBck, said : ' Make a prisoner of me. I'll do no moro guard there. Why, Bill has got up from hiB coffin and gone down to the nativo bazaar.' He was promptly placed under arrest, and sergeant proceeded to put another man on the guard. At the same time he made an inspec tion of the mortuary, where he found the dead soldier just as he had been placed there. The ' non-com.' returned to the guard room, and was soon startled by tbe appearance of sentry number two, who, pale and agitated, said in effect the same thing as the first man. Having put him under arrest, the sergeant said to one of tbe guard : ' Here, you come along and see if you can stop Bill's pranks.' ' Faith, I was always as good a man as he, when he was alive, and sure I ought to be bettor now he's dead !' observed the Belccted one, as he marched off. The sergeant watched the clock until the hour for relief name somewhat anxiously, aud then proceeded to the deadhouse, where be found tbe sentry standing upright, stone dead, with his bayonet driven firmly into the paling.
