CHAPTER II. For nearly a year Gilbert "Warren performed tbe very hard task of killing- time. He visited, fished, sailed, golfed, shot, hunted, but the savour had . gone out of life, and the length of the days and nights was horrible to him. Many a tims he almost made up his mind to break with everything, .and go down to Landewarne to see her, and hear her voice again. But over and over agaln.he told him- self that it .would be presumptuous, ungentle- manly, childish, cowardly, when she had shown him that the very mention of his love distressed her so deeply, and he conquered the madness conquered It for nearly twelve months. À very little incident broke down his .resolution at last Just a girl's face in the Park-a shabby. little governess he thought she was, at the end of a file of girls taking exercise in the biting air; and he only caught a; gUmpse cf her .face: as ,he. happened to turn-his eyes, absently; in her .direc- tion But thHt glinipserreminded,him;of,Eleanor; it set his blood coursing .and^his^heart aöhihg desperately, can't go pleasuring-with a lot.of people at Christ- mas, when I am racked and misérable; ~~ I will go | to her-at Landewarne." . - v As Gilbert neared his own door the" first snow- flakes of the winter were slowly falling, but he did not heed them, his eyes" were unseeing, hungry for a sight of the woman he loved. ? ? .. Three days before Christmas Gilbert was at Landewarne, settled in the; big dining-room and best bedroom of Trethick - Farm, with Mrs. Mitchell, the farmer's wife, his sworn friend, every comfort that good hearts could pró- vido at his. service, . a white world outside, and the appaling tidings, in answer to his inquiries, that Landewarne House was shut up-had been-empty , these twelve months past, Miss Hardwick, the young mistress, being on visits, it was thought. . ' Gilbert almost sank under.,this news, imparted to bim by Charlötte;:'the':söfvihg-m his first supper; he realised:with^a .rush qf.-deEO lation how much .hn. badi.counted upon, a sight ? of Eleanor, how, the. fought vq^ waking moment, how. blank;;th'e;wórl.d had,súd'¿én" ly become again; and - he shivered as;;hé'sat before the fire which blazed., tip..the. chimney.-. -, ; . .'v ', "It will be 'a white Christmas/ slr,':'; said Mrs. Mitchell, cheerily. ';. She>,hadïcdmé in to;.remo.n-| strate with Gilbert , on his -.want";::of;' apatite, .and f remained to try tô.jhèarténi hird"ujpi. "Is it still snowing?" asked Gilbert. "No, sir; the snow has stopped!'and the slcy is clearing nicely; but the moon's.on her back,, sp there'll he no thaw yet áwhilel1? We like a white Christmas here in Landowarne, .' but wa don't often get it." 'Then this is really Landewarne?" "Landewarne parish. - , Yes, sir. 'Tis only a | scattered bit of a village) but Landewarne House j is close here;, you can..sè>'4tpn. winter 'time cf rom i your bedroom window.' . 'Tia a lonely-looking place now, sure enough." ». .-: , "Miss Hardwick is away ?" . -' "Yes, sir; been away these twelve months.. 'Tis lonely here, I make,? no doubt, for a young lady alone; but we.: of ten wish her back again. She was a great favorite here, was Miss Hardwick; and before the old gentleman's death there seemed to ba no place like Landewarne to. her, she, was .sp j set on it, and now rweíheár that she's been trying, to let it. But, law".me, the old' place has gone | to rack and-min these*'.-last,.-.thirty- years. .-. Ord Mr. Hardwick 'spent freely when ho was. a young ! man, and money grew scarce, I've hoard.. There was never a Hardwick .who, wasn't free-handed; and ifs brought 'em to poverty at last, I sup- pose." '.-J""-' ?-.. < -v. ':- A Gilbert smiled at the. thought of poverty as he recalled Miss .

"That is her horne," thought Gilbert, passion- ately. "That, at any rate, I may look upon, and touch. Ah, she. seems nearer to me here! It was worth coming for.' He leaned on tho ' window-seat and gazed, long and eagerly, upon Eleanor" Hafdwick's home. ,. At length, as he leaned there, with his eyes rivetted on the scene before him/a movement on the snowy stretch of lawn caught his attention. Rousing himself from his reverie, he leaned for- ward and looked more closely at the spot where the movement had seemed to- be. There was cer-. tainly something moving, something slowly near- ing the gaunt, desolate house. ". \ * . The night was so;clear,' the ground so intensely white, that Gilbert's ? eye :could" follow the; move-, ing form easily as it went forarwdi .'..It seerncd to he weary,-of in no "hurry; the'color óf^ it; did not seem to be very dark- greyish rather than: black; but though lt.:stood father high5 from'the; ground, he could not tell"whether lt ' was"' a Hunian being or an animal. .. ???

'" "* "" . . ':? ; There was np swerving, or. hesitation about the moving shape, however, arid at last Gilbert saw j it reach what seemed to be a small side door , of ' the silent mansion;^ but there, the' moving' shape seemed to melt into the darkness of the door it- self, and for a few moment's he could not follow it, It Eeemed gone. r "Suddenly Eleanor's light words of a year ago came back to his mind, send- ing the blood coursing swiftly through his veins. "A grey, snarling wolf, which prowls about out- side, and at length comes" in at. the door; and I am afraid of lt." ' Arid even as he remembered, ha fancied he saw-he felt almost certain he saw \--unless his straining: eyes ' were deceiving him the door of this empty, barfed mansion slowly ope.n, and the grey figure vanish into the Inner darkness. . :.;.;Kj; v-;; j? .:;%>;'.V ... .'?

Mrs. Mitchell was amazed, when Gilbert led Eleanor into Trethick Hall, but her pride and de- light knew no bounds. . . - "I have known Miss Hardwick for some time," said Gilbert by way of explanation, "and - I-told her that you all wanted her back at L»a'ndewarnei" This was quite 'true, but he did not .say that the. wordB had.been spoken within the last five minute)». "She has come unexpectedly, and has had a- ter-, ribly cold time in getting here, but she hopes ehe will not be unwelcome." : "Unwelcome! Miss Hardwick .unwelcome, in- deed!" cried Mrs. Mitchell, looking, into the lovely grey eyes, which .were smiling, and _. weeping by turns. "Come in, my dear, come-in. - You're cold and tired, I'm sure/ Here, father! Charlotte! Here's Miss Hardwick, bless -her heart." ? . - The excitement at.

Therefore when in the?''early springI/andewarn« did resound with wedding- chimes there were two persons at least who were hot surprised, and who enjoyed the extreme pleasure of remarking -many times, "There now, I told *ee so."
