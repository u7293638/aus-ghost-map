The President then read the following address i My Rev Brethren and Brethren of the Laity, -In my opening address to the Conference of clergy and lay delegates who, by my invitation, assembled at Brisbane in September of last year, I said that the first question which I do sired to submit for their consideration was whether, in the judgment of the Conference, the time had arrived when it would be desirable for us to enter upon some form of synodical action, with a view to the ordering and government of the Church in this diocese, and, if so, what form of synodical action it would be desirable to adopt, whether it should be by legislative enactment or consensual compact, and the Conference having expressed a unanimous opinion that the time had arrived for the adoption of some form of synodical action, it was, after careful consideration resolved that the Synod to be convened should be founded on the basis of voluntary compact and not on legislative enactment, and a committee of the Conference was appointed to enquire into and report upon a Constitution for the Church in this diocese which might be laid before the Synod, which I was requested to continue in the month of April or May of the present year. It was also resolved that the basis of representation should be that which I had adopted in conveying the Conference-namely, Church membership that an electoral roll should be prepared in each parish or district, to be signed by every adult male member of the Church, of 21 years of age and upwards, to which roll the following declaration should be attached " I A. B. , do hereby declare that I am a bona-fide member of the United Church of England and Ireland, and of no other communion That one delegate should be given to each parish two delegates where the numbers of Church members enrolled should amount to tim ty, and three delegates where the number of Church members enrolled should amount to one hundred or more; but in no case should any one district return more than three delegates And it was also determined that every person elected as a repre- sentative to the Synod should be required, on taking his sent to make the following declaration -" I, AB, do (hereby solemnly declare that I am bona-fide a communicant member of the United Church of England and Ireland, resident in the diocese of Brisbane, and of no other communion " These resolutions of the Conference have, I believe, been duly observed in the convening of this Synod, which I have declared to be duly constituted, and at the conclusion of my address, as it will be necessary for us to have some rules for our guidance in debate, it will be my duty to request you mv l writes i >- ' quest you, my reverend brethren, and my brethren of the laity, to appoint a select committee to draw up a code of standing orders, which may be presented to the Synod, and considered in a committee of the whole, and also a committee of qualifications, to whom may be referred the election of any delegate, the formality of whose election may be called in question These preliminaries having been adjusted, the report of the Standing Committee of the Conference, appointed on the 6th of September last, to consider of a Constitution for the Church in this diocese, will be laid before you Those of you, my brethren, who were present at the late Conference, may remember that in speaking of the present position of the Colonial Church, and its connection with the mother country, with reference to at once securing the general unity of our now widely spreading branch of the Catholic Church of Christ with the necessary independent government of its several branches in all matters of local detail and internal discipline, I advisedly said that I should purposely refrain from enter- ing at any length upon the consideration of that question, because I thought that it was our wisdom to await the result of the deliberations, and trust to profit by the wisdom and experience of those Bishops of the several branches of the Catholic Church of Christ in visable union and communion with the United Church of England and Ireland, who, by the invitation of the Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of all England, were at that time about to assemble under his Grace's presidency, in solemn conference, at Lambeth, and it will, I am sure, be satisfactory to you to learn that the resolutions adopted by our Conference, in September last, were almost entirely in accordance with those which were adopted by the Conference of Bishops of the Anglican communion assembled at Lambeth Labour the same time These resolutions, so far as they relate to the establishment and organisation of Diocesan Synods, I will now lead to you On the question of the relation of the Diocesan to the Provincial Synod, and of the Provincial Synod to a higher Synod or Council, of the Anglican communion, it is not at present necessary that I should enter Extract from the report of the committee appointed under resolution 3, by the Conference of Bishops of the Anglican communion, held at Lambeth Palace, September 2127th, 1867 " in the organisation of Synodal order, for the government of the Church, the Diocesan Synod simple art is a ~ -.-, .-- Account owner appears to be the primary and simplest form of such organization." . . . . " By the Diocesan Synod the co-operation of all members of the body is obtained in Clinch action, and that acceptance of Church rules is secured which, in the absence of other law, usage, or enactment, gives to these rules the force of laws binding on those who expressly, or by implication, have consented to them." "For this reason, wherever the Church is not established by law, it is, in the judgment of your committee, essential to order and good government that the diocese should be organized by a Synod. Your committee consider that it is not at variance with the ancient principles of the Church that both clergy and laity should attend the Diocesan Synod, and that it is expedient that the Synod should consist of the Bishop and clergy of the diocese, with representatives of the laity. The constitution of the Diocesan Synod may be determined either by rules for that branch of the Church established by the Synod of the province, or by general consent in the diocese itself, its rules being sanctioned afterwards by the Provincial Synod. Your committee, however, recommend that the following general rules should be adopted, namely : That the Bishop, clergy, and laity should sit together, the Bishop presiding. That votes should be taken by orders whenever demanded, and that the concurrent assent of Bishop, clergy, and laity, should be necessary to the validity of all acts of the Synod. They consider that the clerical members of the Synod should be those clergy who are recognised by the Bishop, according to the rules of the Church in that diocese as being under his jurisdiction. Whether in large dioceses where the clergy are very numerous, they might appear by representation, is a difficult question, and one on which your committee are not prepared to express an opinion The lay representatives in the Synod ought, in the judgment of your committee, to be more communicants of at least one year's standing in the diocese, and of the full age of 21 It should be required that electors should be members of the Church in that diocese, and belonging to the parish in which they claim to vote It appears desirable that the regular meetings of the Synod I should be fixed and periodical and that the light of convening special meetings wherever they may be required should be reserved to the Bishop The committee adds - The office of the Diocesan Synod is generally to make regulations not repugnant to those of higher Synods for the order and good government of the Church within the diocese and to promulgate the decisions of the Provincial Synod" Amongst the many subjects which will claim the attention of the Synod, I my brethren, may mention the sustentation of the clergy, and their appointment to their respective cures, the organisation and subdivision of parishes, the consecration of churches and cemeteries the compilation 01 selection of a hymnal for general use in the diocese, the education of the young, the supply of the occasional offices of the church such as marriages and burials , church dues and fees, the adoption of some model flu t deed, or the appointment of a Board who subject to the control of the General Synod, and to the terms of any specific trust, may stand possessed of lands 01 moneys either granted by the Crown or given by individual members, for the use and benefit of the church , the education of the children of the clergy, and some provision for those who thioiighmfirmityorage,aio no longer able to fulfil the active duties of the ministry It is probable, my brethren, with regard to some of the so many questions, that you will find it desirable to appoint select committees to in quire into and report upon them to a i rim of sos sion of the Synod, but I would desire more particularly to urge upon your immediate attention, as questions of the deepest and most pressing importance to the progress of religion in this diocese, those which refer to the con time increase in the number of the clergy, and the most desirable course to be adopted with a view to their sustentation, because, whilst I am perfectly aware that the work before the Synod is more than it can at all hope to grapple with satisfactorily in the course of a single session, yet we must remember that a very large number of souls each year are passing into eternity, and that although within the last eight years the number of the clergy in the diocese has been increased nearly sixfold, yet there are large districts of the interior which rarely, if ever, are visited by the ministers of any religious denomination whnlBoeier I trust, therefore that the obtaining the sea vices of additional clergymen for the ministry of the Church in this diocese, the support of the clergy, and the mode of their appointment to fill existing cures which from time to time may find circumstances become vacant, and open up now centres of missionary exertion in the interior districts of the colony, may be amongst the subjects which will occupy the earliest attention of the Synod It will be for you mv brethren, carefully to consider whether in your judgment, it is most desirable that the contributions of the members of the Church for the support of the clergy should be cast into one common fund, or that each clergyman should, as at present, he maintained by the contributions of the members of the Church resident in the district in which he ministers I believe, my brethren that in any colonial diocese where it is practicable, a system of partial endowments for the support of the clergy in the different districts, to be supplemented by the voluntary contributions of the members of the congregation to whom they minister will eventually be found to be the most desirable and satisfactory expedient to be entirely supported by voluntary contributions, in my judgment places the clergyman in a position of unhealthy depend much upon the will of the congregation, whilst, on the other hand, it appeals to me that the system of entire endowment is exposed to the danger of rendering the clergy too independent of the affectionate respect and good will of those who are committed to their pastoral supervision and it will be my desire to bring under the control of the Synod certain portions of land some of which are the gift of individual members of the Church, and others have been purchased by me with funds kindly placed at my disposal by English friends These lands we can scarcely expect hill for some little time be productive of any return, and occasionally they are sources of expense when you are called upon by the owner of on adjoining property for your share of the dividing force , but with the increase of population and prosperity in the colony, they may, I trust, be found here after a valuable assistance in providing a glebe and partial endowment for the clergy in some districts of the diocese And hen), whilst I am speaking of the support of the clergy, it will be a reasonable opportunity for me to mention to the Synod the assistance which has been afforded to my diocese by the Ineoi por rated Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the Colonies, Plantations and Factories of the British 3 in pure In the year 1865, the clergy man other ating at Maryborough, with the Wide Bay district, and Taroom, with the Upper Dawson, each received £100 from the venerable society, in part payment of their stipends, and that year being in England, I obtained from the society, partly in consequence of of the depressed condition of the colony, an increased additional grant of £500 per annum (in all £700) for three years That augmentation of the society's grant has enabled me to assist in providing the stipends of clergy men for the now districts of Roma and Port Mackay, and has been a valuable aid in preventing, by a temporary assistance, the sad necessity for the withdrawal of the ministering clergy from some of the districts where the commercial depression of the colony rendered it almost impossible for the scattered congregations to supply the necessary stipend that grant will expire at tho close of the resent year, but I have asked the venerable society for a renewal of the grant, or of a portion of it, and in doing so I have suggested that in future the giant assigned by the society to my diocese should be administered by the Bishop, in conjunction with the Standing Committee of the Synod to gether with the maintenance of the clergy, I trust that you, my brethren, will give your care ful attention to a scarcely less important ques- tion that of their appointment to their respective cures As I said in my opening address to the Conference, it is, in my judgment, very desirable that the different congregations should have a voice in the appointment of their clergy, but it is a subject which will require very careful consideration, and it should be well understood that a clergyman, when once presented to the Bishop, and appointed by him to a cure has a moral, if not a legal, right to the regular quarterly payment of the stipend which was as sured to him when he was presented to the Bishop for appointment, and that he cannot, when once appointed, be removed from his cure, except upon just cause shown either to the Bishop and to some tribunal appointed by the synod and approved by the Bishop It will be for the Synod to consider whether, with a view to from time to time obtaining the services of Clergymen from England, it is desirable that the Bishop should altogether divest himself of the responsibility of the appoinment of the clergy, or whether, by some defined system such, for instance as alternate presentation to the different cures of the diocese, he should share the responsibility with the congregation In his Catheornij when the circumstances of the colony will allow one to be built, it will, I believe, be almost necessary that the appointment of the officiating clergy should be vested in the Bishop I have already, my brethren, felt it necessary to occupy at some length the attention of the Synod, but there are yet Borne subjects which I should be unwilling to pass over" in bringing my address to a close ii i", I think, desirable that upon the occasion of this first meeting of our Synod I should Briefly review what has, by God's blessing, during the last eight years been accomplished in the diocese in the way of church extension i have already said that the number of clergy officiating in the diocese has been increased nearly iS fold. In the municipality of Brisbane, and its immediate vicinity, now congrega- tions have been gathered, and churches built at Wickham Terrace, Lutwyche, and Toowong the churches of Fortitude Valley, South Brisbane, and Kangaroo Point have been enlarged, and St John's is in course of enlargement, of Grovely and Doughboy Creek in the same neighborhood, churches are being built, at Ipswich, of the debt of 2300 which existed upon the church C1800 has by the exertions of the congregation, been paid off and the parsonage, which had fallen into considerable decay thoroughly repaired at Toowoomba and Drayton the churches have been enlarged, and steps are being taken at Toowoomba for the election of a new church, at Dalby a convenient church and parsonage have been built, at Taroom a parsonage, at Wainickasub stantial parsonage has been built upon a beautiful site which was kindly given by a former member of the congregation, and a church is in course of erection which when completed, promises to be the finest building of stone dedicated to the service of Almighty God which has been hitherto erected in the colony At Allora a church has been built and I have been enabled to place these a boy wonder, who conducts Divine Service twice every Sunday in the little church, and visits in the week the family settlements in the neighborhood, and the labourers employed on the line of railway At Maryborough and Rockhampton churches have been built, and at Bowen, which is beyond the limits of the diocese, a small church and parsonage have been erected I must not forgot to mention the churches, which, by the liberality of the proprietors of stations, have been built at Yandilla and Gumburra I should wish to avail myself of this opportunity of publicly acknowledging the kind gratuitous services of the Rev. Mr Creyke, who is at present assisting Mr Mosely in the ence of the Ipswich district, and who, if he happily finds that his present desire to return to ministerial duty is not inconsistent with his health, will, I hope, before long be able to show me to enrol but amongst the regular clergy of my diocese, said he summon him to take his place in our Synod, and although His Honor is present as a member of our Synod, I cannot from any motives of false delicacy shrink from acknowledging the very valuable services of Mr Justice Lutwyche who, as a layman, has, in the absence of the Rev. Mr Matthews regularly conducted the services in the Church at Kedron Brook Neither would I forget the kind services of Captain Macarthy and Mr Drew, at Toowong and of Mr. Nicholson at Grovely I shall hope on some future occasion to bring before the Synod for their approval a few simple lines with a view to the regular employment of 1 lay agency in my diocese and here, my reverend brethren and my brethren of the laity, I cannot refrain from saying that not only in conducting Divine Service in the absence of the clergyman but in past aching visitation and in works of charity and mercy, the kind co-operation of lay common cant members, and of ladies who are willing to devote some portion of their time to so Christian a work, might, I think, often with great advantage be sought by the clergy A careful house to house visitation is one of the most important parts of a clergyman's duty It is a tutor but true saying that a house going pastor makes a Church going people To my mind a well organised parish almost implies some regular system of lay visitation under the direction of the clergy man, by which the attention of the pastor may without delay at all times be directed to cases requiring his spiritual ministrations The school, my brethren, has been regarded as the handmaid of the Church, and in a well ordered parish, next in importance to the ministrations of the ordained pastor, we may regard the efficiency. of the teachers of the city and Sunday schools Some of our daily schools as at for titude Valley, South Brisbane and Toowoomba are I am glad to say, assisted by the Board of General Education, hut in these it is found necessary, by a practical experience, that there should be no adjustment of the relative position occupied by the inspector appointed by the board and the clergy) man of the parish, subject to the supervision of the Bishop To others of our schools as at St John's, Spring Hill, and Ipswich, aid has been refused , but it is only fair that I should say that since my attention England our applications for assistance to those schools have not been reach ed I have been rather awaiting the meeting of the Synod said I hope to look to its standing committee, or to a committee specially appointed by the Synod for the purpose, for valuable co-operation I need scarcely do more than repeat what I have already often said, that it is my earnest hope that the secular instruction afforded in our schools should be thoroughly efficient, but that, together with efficient secular teaching, we should be allowed to impart a sound religious education to the children of our communion When the Synod shall have been enabled to make some better provision for the regular payment of the stipends of the clergy, and for affording assistance to the raoionowly settled and widely scattered populations occupying the interior, who are themselves able to do but little towards providing the ministrations of religion, the endow- ment of the See will claim a share of its attention At present it consists of the capital sum of £6000 provided by the Colonial Bishopric s CouncdjWiththoassiBtanccofsocioticsm England to which has been recently added £1000 from the contributions of English friends This capital sum of 7000 is, with the sanction of the Colonial Bishoprics Council invested in first mortgages in the name of the Bishop and his successors, and lest any loss might accrue to the Sec, my personal estate is liable for the capital amount There is also in the hands of trustees a sum of £2200, arising from the subscriptions of friends in the colony, and from the interest on original subscriptions, which, for a period of six years, has been permitted to accumulate This sum is also invested in mortgages, but from circumstances into which I will not now stop to enter some loss will, I fear, accrue to the See When the Synod is in a position to make an arrangement for the permanent support of the Bishop, I shall be glad, with the concurrence of the Colonial Bishoprics Council, to arrange that as opportunity offers the moneys at present in vested in mortgages should be laid out in the purchase of Government securities, or born vested in such way as may be thought most expedient for the benefit of the See, and be brought under the control of the Synod I I hope shortly to be able to say that by the kindness of English friends a convenient Seo house has been provided for the permanent residence of the Bishop There is at present in my hands a capital sum of £3000, placed at my disposal by English friends, together with £600, which is at present lent to two congregations of the do come, as assistance towards the building of parsonage houses The interest of the £3000 is devoted to the support of those Church of Eng land schools to which aid has hitherto been refused by the Board of General Education But I trust that the time is not far distant when, without any sacrifice of principle our schools may be assisted by the board This capital sum of £3000 will then be set free, and of it I pur power to apply £1000 towards an endowment of a bishopric for the northern portion of the colony, £1000 for the benefit of orphan children of members of the Church of England, £500 towards the purposes of education, and £500 towards the endowment of the archdeaconry The other £600 as it is repaid will be added as an augmentation to the endowment of the See of Brisbane in the appropriation of the moneys entrusted to my care, I trust that I have endeavored to meet the wishes of my English friends, and to consult the best interests of my diocese To enable our branch of the Catholic Church of Christ to lengthen her cords and strengthen her Stakes, that she may, in dependence on the Divine blessing, fulfil the purposes of her mission, the Synod will, I trust, devise some means for the establishment of a church extension fund, by means of which provision may be made for the outfit and passage of clergymen, and candidates for holy orders coming from England, and for the temporary support of clergymen in the poorer and more widely seat tered portions of the interior There are, I am sure, many members of our Church who are at present residing where, unhappily, they are not called upon to provide for the ministrations of religion, who would gladly contribute to such a fund And those who are permitted to enjoy the regular supply of the ministrations of our holy religion will surely regard it as a duty, and a privilege, to remember, in the enjoyment of their own spiritual blessings, the wants of those to whom at present the opportunities which are afforded to them are, in the inscrutable order ings of Divine wisdom, denied Had time permitted there are yet other subjects upon which I should have been glad to have addressed you , but I must not trespass too long upon your forbearance It is my (earnest prayed that the same mutual forbearance and brotherly good- will which pervaded the deliberations of our Conference may be with us my brethren, now, by God's money for the first time assembled in our Synod Guided by the spirit of love, and faith, and peace, may our deliberations tend to render our beloved Church more and more money spent in carrying out the great war work for which she was appointed by our Lord namely, the poor footing of the saints, the work of the ministry, the edifying of the body of Clitist CO>3TIT17TIOX OF THE STX03) After some formal business, the Venerable Archdeacon Gli vmf moved, and Mr H SrABBoyy seconded a motion to the effect that the report of the standing committee appointed by the Conference on the 6th of September last, to consider of a Constitution for the branch of the Church of England in this diocese, he

agreed to at a Synod of the Bishop, the clergyman laity of the said diocese, assembled in the city of Brisbane, this day of 186 " In the name of the Fairies, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost Amen " 2 Whereas it is desirable that the member a of the United Church of England and Ireland, in the diocese of Brisbane, should be associated to gather as a branch of the said United Church, and that a representative body should be con- structed for the government of the same, and whereas, until due provision shall be made in that behalf by competent authority, it is desirable that the members of the said Church should so far as they lawfully may associate themselves together by voluntary compact as a branch of the said United Church, for the ordering of the all urs, the management of the property, the promotion of the discipline of the members thereof, and for the inculcation and maintenance of sound doctrine and true religion throughout the said diocese to the glory of Almighty God, and the edification and increase of the Church of Christ And whereas the Bishop, the clergy, and the laity, by then representatives have met together to determine the fundamental pro- visions on which the members of such branch of the said Church shall be thus associated to gether and for the purpose of deciding on the constitution and defining the powers and jurisdiction of the governing body of such branch of the said Church, and of prescribing the terms and conditions on which the property of such branch of the said Church shall be held and administered ' Now, therefore, the said Bishop, clergy, and Italy, in Synod assembled, do solemnly declare and establish as follow " I -Fund mental Provision "3 ThisBianch of the mod Church of Eng land and Ireland in the Diocese of Brisbane doth

the draft of a canon, to be submitted to the Synod at its next annual session and the assent of the Bishop and three-fourths of the clergy, and three fourths of the lay representatives, shall be given to the said draft canon in all its stages before it shall be deemed agreed to and passed thereby, when upon the said draft canon so agreed to and passed shall be further submitted to the annual session of the Synod then next following for confirmation, and when the said draft canon, without alteration or amend mont, shall have been confirmed by the Bishop and three-fourths of the clergy, and three-fourths of the lay representatives, then, and not before, shall the fundamental provisions of these presents be altered, revoked added to, or taken from, in the terms of the canon so agreed to and confirmed "8 The foregoing provisions shall be deemed fundamental provisions and the same, or any of them, shall not be altered, revoked, added to, or taken from, save and except in the form and

idea of what the constitution really was He would suggest that they should read the report once have a debate on its provisions, and then, if they found any difficulty in the way of passing it, they might adjourn it.
