A GHOST PARTY. A 'ghost' party does not sound particu larly festive, but it is the newest thing in. the way of social entertainments at Home. From the account of one furnished in a lady's letter, it is certainly unique. Lacu guest is dressed as a 'spirit,' ana as . it enters the ballroom under the full glaie of a calcium light is received witn a ia.m-ue from the orchestra, and is then announced ere it is led across the Styx. Then there is a witches' dance, executed by the young ladies, and at one of these .the costumes were mostartistically arranged. For instance , the Spirit of the Blizzard wore a lovely dress of white gauze covered with crystals, and the Ruling Spirit of Gold appeared ra- j diant ia a gown representing that metal xa i various forms. The dress itself was of white crape, to suggest the snows of Alaska and the Klondyke. It had a broad band of bul lion and round the hem of the skirt was a broad hem of golden coins. The belt band, as well as the front and back of the bodice, were covered with gold coins again, and the ; hair plentifully powdered with gold dust, bad nuggets of gold fastened in it. Another girl represented the Spirit of the Wasted Hours and still another was the Spirit of the Sunshine. But it is thoroughly reassur ing to hear that when supper time came, 'spiri-ts' became sufficiently material ised to prove that they possessed very un spiritual appetites. ? ? ? i
