HAUNTED BY GHOSTS. It is not generally known, in connection with Rudyard Kipling's early life, that to be haunted by a terrible apparition, which took the form of a grandmother's ghost, was almost the constant plague of his existence as a boy. One day the ' guardian of his youthful years' discovered him in the garden dancing wildly round a small tree and soundly be- labouring it with a stick. In reply to her anxious inquiry as to the reason for this strange conduct, young Kip- ling assured her that he was trying to thrash his grandmother, who was for ever appearing before him in an awful shape. Then the good woman took Rudyard's place, and Rudyard assumed the role of the bush. He saw no more grandmothers that day at least. Still, as time went on this habit of seeing apparitions developed to the boy, who com- plained again and again of strange figures being seated in chairs or standing before him. Eventually an oculist was consulted, who recommended a particular kind of spectacles, with the result that the apparitions were effectually and permanently banished from his presence.
