Kevelations from Victoria, MOEE OPFKJIAL STATEMENTS OP 1-E^ J CLINE IN TfiADE. 'a The particulars published by the Victorian , Government of the trade of their colony area perfect revelation of disappointment, and it ip perhaps notto be wondered at that even the pro tectionist working men of Melbourne are now be- ' ginning to wake up to the delusion as to an artificial tariff effecting permanent good to a J community. The bitterest experience which the Melbourne ar tisans have is the titter failure of th».proteejaohist tariff, high as Us is, keeping out foreign' .'made' goods. Loans, whether Governmental, municipaL ? - or private, are paid not in gold, but in goods, and in this way the :heavy loans have swamped the Melbourne market with goods of all descriptions from abroad — the swamping being worse than in' N.S.W. by far. '- .' * Here are the facts as acknowledged by the Vic torian officials themselves : The total export of the colony for the past year was £12,734,734, of which about .£7,500,000 was wool and gold, while the imports of foreign .goods was £24,402,760. The inflow of foreign goods was higher than in any previous year of tbe -colony, while the outflow of home productions was lower than in any of the previous 34 years, with, the exception of five occasions. * . This statement, coming as it dons from the Vic torian Government themselves, should cause even Mr. Luscombe to re-consider whether he realty has not been chasing a' ghost for a very long time. .;-,/ , ; .-- . Brushware and brooms, though protected with . a duty from 25 to 30 per cent., showBd £15,000 excess of imports over exports. In all the articles of ironware, brassware, bolts, nuts, castings, on which a 'duty of from 20 to 85 per cent, is placed, the imports are vastly in ex cess of the exports. For instance, iron bolts and nuts £18,462 of an excess, castings £20,000, cast iron pipes £34,600, manufactures of metal (25 per cent.) £308,944, nails (5s to 12s per cwt- £42,700, &c.; . In earthenware, glassware, &c.;, on which there is a duty of from 10 to 20 per cent., and nearly 30 per cent., the imports of foreign goods are vastly heavier than ever, and the export of home-made lower than before. Earthenware, bottles, porce- : lain, chinaware, on all which -there are heavy - duties, the foreign goods exceed the home by £166,000. Leatherware, protected by 25 per cent., is £43,237 behind the foreign-made goods. Candles, protected up to 2d per lb, are behind the impor tations £25,888. Jams and preserves, protected . up to 3d per lb, are £9815 behind, the imported* Confectionery is £21,000 behind. ? . Grain and pulse are £94,528 behind the impor tations, though protected from 2s to 3s per cental. Maize is £38,000 behind; oats £296,207, &c.; In apparel, where the duty is up to 3Oper cent, and 48s to 60s per dozen on -dresses, the home productions are £112,433 behind. In gloves and handkerchiefs, which carry a duty of 20 and 10 , per cent., the foreign goods amount to £123,000 more than the local. In apparel and slops, 25 to ~ 35 per cent., the imports of foreign goods exceed the home productions by £319,000. Boots and shoes, carrying a protectionist duty of 4s to 45s per dozen pairs, the imports of foreign made exceed home-made by £109,833. BJankets, 20 to 25 per cent, protection, £57,267 behind ; carpets and druggetting, 20 per cent., £119,742 behind; flannel, 30 per cent., £35,181 behind : woollen cloth and tweeds. 25 ner cent. protection, £454,166 behind; dress goods, 7£ per cent., £388,000 behind, &c.; Furniture and upholstery, 35 per cent., £12^018 behind ; carriages, carts, and vehicles, on which the duty ranges from 20 per cent, to £50 each, are £17,000 behind ; steam engines, 35 per cent, protection, £42,000 behind; pianofortes, duty £5 to £15, £102,524 behind. And so on through the entire list the imported article finds its way in increasing amounts, and the Victorian masses find to their cost that not only have they got these goods flooding their market, despite protection, but the prices are higher; the consumer, of course, being the suf ferer. ? The following sentence from the Government statement should be cut out and pasted on the forehead of every protectionist advocate in New South Wales : 'It will be observed that in 1889 the value of imports of foreign goods per head, although Bugnuy lower inaa in xooo, was wiui tnat excep tion the highest in the last 23 years, but except 1865 was lower than in any year prior to that period since 1851 ; also that the value of exports per head in 1889 was higher than in 1887, but in no other year since the separation of Victoria from. New South Wales.' ' ) . There is no need after such a woeful official statement as that to deal with the' threadbare question of freetrade and protection. The facts above given should win to the side of the Labor party in the New South Wales Parliament uni versal support for their determination to look to something else besides the fiscal issue to relieve the masses from the wrongs they suffer under. Country newspapers in this colony, who are: : supporting the present wise action of the parlia mentary Labor party, should take care to extract and republish these official statements about the state of affairs in Victoria.
