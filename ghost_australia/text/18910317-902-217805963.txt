Yonr Heart and Mine. We sometimes sigh and we can't tell why, And we sometimes laugh at our care. We are sometimes sad when tho world is SladÂ» And we weep when the ssies are fair. There s an underflow to the joy and woe That comes with a touch divine, \- In the pleasure and pain, the Bunshine and " rain, That steals into your heart and mine. ! There are phantom hosts of dead hope's ghosts, And the echo of funeral hells ; - There's the lasting bliss of a fadeles kiss And the pleasure our dream foretells. There the hopes entombed and the joys un- bloomed Their lilieo and ivy entwine, Aud.no. one knows of the thorn and the rose That are hidden in your heart and mine.
