' You are not looking well, Mrs. Devereux,' Lord Heriot said, as he felt her lean rather, heavily upon his arm, as they pronvwaöed the hall after a dance, and he r««glit the ex- pression of her rapidly-i^ttûl) cheek. ' I am afraid T--*Û scarcely as strong as I fancy I am Sometimes, my lord,' she replied,') yfjih a faint smile. ' You know,' she con- ! tinued, wearily, ' how much trouble I have had with my husband in his sad illness ; and I think I have hardly recovered from the anxiety and wretchedness of it yet.' Then Lord Heriot took her into the con- servatory, and sitting beside her, talked to < her gently of the past/and condoled with her : in murmuring accents of sympathy. ' You, perhaps, have not noticed, dear Mrs. . Devereux,' he said, ' how much Charles is changed since his illness : of course,, you would hardly be expected to mark it so readily as some of us who see him less. To ? one who is with him daily, almost hourly, I had nearly said, a change-no matter how ' striking, no m speer how great-is but faintly apparent ; but to those who see him only oc- casionally-' '. Then he shook his head slowly, and Blanche gazed at him with attentive wonder. ' I hardly follow your lordship,' she re- turned, at last, very frigidly, and with a j haughty flash of questioning coldness. She was shivering, notwithstanding, and her heart was beating violently, thoügh the beautiful features might have been chiselled in marble, for any emotion that they showed. ' I am sure you will , pardon me,' rejoined Lord Heriot ; 1 and, if I offend, I know you will accord me your forgiveness. I, perhaps, should not take the liberty of saying what I am about to say,' he continued, in a sof- tened tone,1 only that I was one of your hus- band's guardians, though I regret to say I had little or nothing to do WÜL hhuy and because-KBd~atrcD.rs"you will not be offended, j I am assured-I am old enough to be the father of you both, and wish you well with all mv heart !' 4 Of that, at least, I feel quite certain, my lord,' said Blanche, gratefully offering her hand ; 1 and if-if there is anything you wish to know, I shall be only too happy to answer your questions, if I can.' 41 do not know.' he answered, 4 if I have a right to ask you any. As I said before, I do not base my interest in you and Charles upon anything but well- wishing ; but I have thought lately that-' 4 Go on, my lord,' interrupted Blanche, steadily, and looking him so strait in the face that his eyes drop suddenly ; 41 have pro- mised you an answer to your question. What is it ?' 4 And now, at the last moment, I hardly like to avail myself of your kindness, Mrs. Devereux. But as this beating about the bush will only tend to mystify you, and not advance my object, I may as well dash into the subject boldly ; more particularly as it may be rather an unpleasant one. The sur- geon's knife, they say, is never felt so lightly as when plunged into the wounded limb at once, and sbarplv.' . 4 Am I the subject of your metaphor, my lord ?' asked Blanche, growing more and more H^^rted, as she noted the look on the pa ^^^^Bp tures. ^^^^^mS > though I hope, with all my heart, ^^^Hpre will be neither .wound nor hurt. ^^^Eere is a little pain, beliere me it shall ^^Hic for. want of gentle touch.

'"! ' Tho way of --Ms father ?' echoed Blanche, j WonderJ»giy. »-*-*-Ay, the saddest, most, terrible' way of all sorrowful walking. I fear he is losing the healthy state of his mind-that his brain is diseased-that he is- is going mad.' She grew so deathly pale now, that his lordship hastily 4half rose, as if to call for assistance. She recovered a little in a moment, then lord Heriot gently proceeded. 'I will not pursue the subject farther to- night, for I see you dre very far* from being well. But if-if what I suspect be ever con- firmed, I do, hope you will confide in me, and allow me the honour and pleasure of being a friend and counsellor to you.' 'Thanks, my lord,' whispered Blanche, with a curions, quick movement, as if shield- ing him fro*m view. *I may, indeed, need such an one in the future ; and if I do, I will come to you.' Then, with a sudden gesture of gratitude, she raised his lordship's hand to her quiver- ing lips, and before he could speak his pleased remonstrance, she pushed him a little away with a pretty imperiousness that was delights fully charming to the old lord, pale and sad though she looked. ' Go now, my lord,' she murmured, slowly, ' and let me remain alone for a little.' ' But, Mrs. Devereux,' remonstrated his lordship, gallantly, ' as I have brought away the choice flower of the bouquet, ought I not to take it back again, in justice to the rest as well as myself?' Slie looked up with a little sad smile in the dark eyes. J You will humour me in this silly laney, I am sure, my lord,' she answered, wearily. His lordship bowed deeply, murmured^ something about her wish hping Q «<m-Lxuaii<r, anil sha waícUod Ms tall figure till he was out of sight. She is tired no longer, now, but starts up swiftly, and steps round a huge, yellow-fruited tree a great resolve lighting up her features. For all that time of the conversation with Lord Heriot, she had seen the shadow of ber husband, Charles Devereux^ lurking round, with uncouth gestures and strange clasping and unclasping of his hands, mouthing and muttering, his lips half open, his great eyes distended with mad fear and hate ; that awful red band over his white forehead she knew so well, and ear cunningly thrust forward to catch every sound ; and once, when that sick feeling came over her, she feared for his lord- ship's safety. But a, new feeling had come over her now, a strange and unaccountable one, but so .powerful in its dread fascination, that she could no more resist it than she could cure the diseased mind of her afflicted lord. And this was an impulse that led her to face her husband, to seek him out, and defy him, if she could not calm the unreasoning man ; and, strange to say, this idea lent a new life to ber soul, sent ber heart leaping and bounding with violent emotion, till she could sit still no longer, but must needs make quest for him, and meet him quickly. So she passed rapidly around the laden bushes, searching in vain for a long half hour, while the music, in faint crashes, stole 1 upon her ear ; and through the long, dim vista, she could catch, now and again, the forms of the revellers and dancers in the old Hall. Thie cunning madman Lad some such thought in his own weak mind, and took a malicious pleasure in leading this white-robed woman around abd about like an ill-omened * will-o?-the-wisp.' But she grew worn out at last : then a terrible reaction set in, and she began to fail and feel hysterical, presently sank into a scat under the shadow of against plant, and wept soft tears of exceeding bitter- ness. She remembered her Christmas Eve at Mulberry Tree House, and the little present of dear papa and Aunt Susan, her dream under the mulberry tree on that soft, ambient aired night, and felt very vividly the shadow of the great darkness that had been its clos- ing picture ere yet she awoke. And so she sat dreaming once more, only with such a swelling heart of wretchedness and misery, while two forms watched '\er closely and anxiously. She grows more and moro miserable as tue minutes pass thc quick span on, and presently sobs quietly, with heaving breast, speaking to herself between her paroxysms of grief. A ' My wasted life-my wasted life !f she Vuiewy hM4^^pgoüg|<t ttf forgive, me fog ¿ry' |Si La' been, sictí^^Ja ,4cuiL^pjy been back ,a|^ÍH¿ |è an I've beenfairly Esting1' night, Miss Blatobe^rafore , mas morrow dawns, to gi' ness, as I thought ; but 1/ been punished ?for't.

Blanche, in her brave finery d^^^^^^^H grace and beauty, looked .down ^^^^^^^^H man as a queen might upon a ^^^^^^^^M ject, only that there was a gre^^^^H^^Bi almost a love-bond, between th^M^^H^ similar and different though theinpsition in , life. ^He glanced up_ wistfulljK'at her, but for *a moment not a word was said, only that the young wife's lips quivered painfully, and she put her little hand tremblingly upon his. ' John/ she said, solemnly, * I have been thinking, as I sat here, of the past, and repent big of myself, for I am very wretched. This is only the beginning of my life $ when and where is it all to end ? This is a festive time,' jj she adds, with a half sob of agony ; ' Christ-J| mas Eve, John, the eve of the good news an-^B niversary, and I have stolen away from thoH mirth and revelry, hoping that I shall not LcH missed-that I may enjoy the luxury--an^ actual luxury, John,' she continued, passion- È ately-' of being alone for a little while with J my own heart!' ' Oh, Miss Blanche !' interrupts- the Sj^^^k gardener, tremblingly. jj^^^H ' My poor friend, do not reproach y4^^^^^| a greater power than yours or mine has ^H^^^H my life to this wretched consummatioij^^^^^^H it is very bitter, and I am so wearj^^^^^^H watching and waiting.' _~^^^^^^^Ê Then tw. :u*^--ttrucrpe7r sadly onc^^^^^^^H and the old man kissed her hand r^^^^^^H caressingly. WHtH^^ At that moment thc young wife felt a bot breath upon her cheek, and she turned round slowly, transfixed with horror. What that man would have said-what the, words trembling round the white lips would have meant had they been uttered, will never be known on this side of the grave. For a few moments Blanche gazed into her husband's face, fascinated with an awful wonder, while the light gradually faded ont of her eyes, till they were stony and expres- sionless. Then from Charles Devereux came an aw- ful shriek, and John Wrackall rose with a bound from his knees, and ran between them. Not quite in time-not quite too late-but with one fierce, frightened look at the old man's set countenance of wrathful fury, Charles Devereux tums and flies, followed through the snow by fancied execrations. With a rushing, shrieking leap, looking half over his shoulder íeárfuly, he reached the river side. He caught the glint and shimmer of the whitened figures following him ; then, with a shuddering cry of horror ringing in his ears, with a mad shout of joy, he leaped into the flooded stream. There was an ominous dash in the water, and for one brief moment au agonized face was seen on its surface. Then John Wrack all turned and half-carried, half-dragged Blanche back to the house, bidding her sternly to keep up, and nil would be well. At the threshold they met Mrs. Benson,JH and the old man pointed his finger to the li ali, while an awful light gleamed from his gray^H eyes. This fair-haired woman had seen calamitv^H written in the set faces, tidings in the snow^^H covered forms, and she swiftly ' carried witn^M nimble feet the unknown Christmas news- that John Wrackall was to reveal. So he alone of them all knew what had been the last' scene in Charles Devercux's unquiet life-he alone held thc key of the secret of that silent meet- ing in the orangery. (To bc continued.
