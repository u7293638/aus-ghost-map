STANZAS. BY A. J. EVELYN. As the miller's whirling wheel Throws the water-drops away, So this spinning globe alway Flings the souls of men in spray On the night, and on the day. Bursts no [?] thunder peal; Nature's [?] not aghast, When a human soul is cast Out into the trackless vast, All its warm sweet earth-life past. Nature cares not when we die. Suns are bright, and flowers are gay, When our spirits fade away: Clouds of ghosts, from battle-fray, Cast no gloom athwart the day. Can we shape our destiny, Even while on earth we wait? No! our fortunes, small and great, Tone like bells, with love or hate, In the hands of juggling Fate. God! we still can grasp the right: All the worlds thro' space that roll Cannot sway a single soul. That is balanc'd sound and whole, From its godlike self-control. Fate! thou art not mistress quite: Thou canst make us low or high, But thou canst not, if thou try, Force us to a shameful lie, Or a coward calumny. Quickly comes to all the night, Some have found it underneath The wild battle's bloody heath-- Happy! for their laurel-wreath Brightens all the graves beneath. Happy! for they fell in fight. Guarding all that men hold dear. Who would wrong them with a tear? Better to be dying there Than be making money here! Come into the Heaven's light! Send this prayer to God with faith-- Drawing in life a blameless breath, May I die a duteous death! More than this no wise man saith.
