Knowing of no reason why my purpose in shippmg to Bombay should be conâSeroB a BBcret, I unhesitatingly replied : " " • Not at alL 1 am going to Bombay to superintend the raising of the City of Delhi, whSih ship, you may bo aware, Collided in the harbor, and went dmra at M i of ".'No-one os bo&rd; her Jbeing BaTôd, 1 tiie " fit was a very strangw^aSaîr; but,«ofar sa I "know, everyone "went downwîth bar,' I assented. -V.

V * May I ask yon why my question appears strange ?' the Hindoo queried. Simply because you -are a Hindoo and I am an Englishman,' I retorted ; ' naturally you take more interest in the affairs of Bombay than I do, and, consequently, I thought you would know that the Becond colliding ship was not discovered.' '" That is a remarkable 'fact, <don't you thinV ?' he asked significantly. • • ; • " Perhaps in ray own country it would apuear so, but we never taie enough interest in what occurs abroad to hunt up niinute derails.

" « It will cost a great deal to raise the City of Delhi' sum byfar to build her • I answered, having no. JE tendon to put my Questioner in possession of the details. You will taie no active part in the Work itself, 1 the Hindoo went on ; 'being at ihe head of afiiire, yon will watch their pro- -j while the actual labor will be carried CD tjf.your eubordinatcE.' " T. am not above lending a hand when neeeasaiy ; although, of cçuree, as you sav câiess do the main part of the manual labor.

' M It is a grand night,' he said shortly. Quite a relief after the heat of the day,' I replied, moving away to go below. The Hindoo followed me as I went down the i stairway of the ship, which was spacious, far the Eastern Star was one of the best passenger ships afloat.

" « It is no more matter of inference,' he answered. ' I was -out- in the Bay in a Email boat at the time, and I saw ^what happened.-* It may assist you coniiderably in y6ur task to know what took place ; have I your word that you will treat what I with to say as confidential until ihe City of Delhi is cawed; then-any wdrds will be ' abundantly proved.' 7 "I.(Signified my_assent. to this, and the Hindoo continued. • • ' It aras a close, hot sight ; en land er sea there was Bcarcely a breath of idr ; I was poling my' boat «1/mg 'in, {hé shallow, just where the white houses run down almost to the harbor wall • white and misty, with a .pall .of heat obscuring its outline, rose Malabar hill on the right. HoundHUB as I stirred the waters, feU the shadows of the maze of shipping in the harbor. Suddenly I heard the plashing of oajq, mofflèà and pobdned." - Î drew in cloee where the shadow of a dark hulk hid me, and I watched and waited, wondering who else had chosen the night for a pull in the harbor. A minute more and I aaw a boat crowded with a crew of Hindoos ana Malays pulling away from a ship. Almost opposite to me they rested on their oars, then turned with anxious faces towards the ship they had left. No word came from the lips of any there, and I seemed almort awed by the strange eilenoe, when, just as the moon -broke through the ragged, threatening sky, the steersman rose and out into mid-harbor, shivered like a sentient thing, then down her prow dipped into the waves and she was gone ; I heard the suokof the waters she dragged after her, and felt the boat beneath me rock, then the harbor became placid, and without one word, the seamen, with strange glances at each other, drew their boat away till they reached another Teasel. Over the side of the latter a rope ladder was flung, and after lashing the boats so as to be able to raise it, the seamen climbed up; the boat was hauled up, and I was alone on the waters once more. I .ask,you then, did that shipf the City of Delhi, have fair play? WaEnt it plain that no ship conld have marks of colliding with her when that happened; not a passenger aboard was saved out of those who were" on their way to Calcutta from there, end who had only been on the ship a few hours. Do you -understand me now?' " 1 You mean that, for some reason, there was foul play on the part of the captain and his crew ?" " * Yes, I say that the City of Delhi never had fair play ; I tell you she was scuttled ; I ; ewearit I* : *_' The Hindoo yoee from the couch on which he had seated himself and stood before me, his dark eyes glittering with ; anger, his right hand clenched and threaten- : ing. " ' I suppose the hatches were bittened down, which accounts for not even a solitary cry being raised by anyone on board ths vessel. There is one question I èhould like tcv ask you, and it is this—What could be: the motive for such a crime?' I questioned. '"That is exacltv what I wish, to speak to you about, Mr Thompson. Liet us go back to a question I asked you on deck—does cost much to raise a ship like the City of Delhi!' 1 "'It is an expensive process, certainly, but when a vessel lies in the harbor, as you are aware this one does, it constitutes a danger to shipping.' " ' Not when she lies so many feet below the surface,' replied the Hindoo promptly ; ' besides, if that were the case, why has the vessel not been destroyed by dynamite—that is the usual method employed by the divers under such circumstances. Can you explain? You made a public tender for the raising of the ^vessel, did you not ?' "'The firm did,'I answered ; 'which iathe custom usu illy. ' " 'Do you happen to know why your tender was accepted ?' " I suppose it was the lowest,' I answered, not understanding the drift of the question. '"So far from being the lowest, youf tender was actually the highest' " ' Then I suppose there axe special reasons for the work being done thoroughly—no doubt the City of Delhi is a well-built vesaej and of proportional valne. * " ' I " Wouldn't : give a ' hundred pounds for her ; she looked ' well enough^ T>ut the vessel was only fit to break up. Can yoji understand now why her owners are so anxious to raise the ship ? " ' You'puzzle me completely—perhaps you are acquainted with the reason.' " * The reason Is probably more extraordinary than the-appacantiy jnotivaless crime .of Bcutfling the City of Delhi-' "'You have aroûsod my curiaeity," I said. ' Asyou fciow the caase of the ship founderingv' .perhaps you will let me hear what lies hidden behind that disaster. No one shall hear from me the secret, if secret it is, unless, as yon say, the vessel is raised ; then, I understand, no furthei concealment Will be neoeasary.* "The Hindoo moved to the door and examined the bolt. ' As if not satisfied with that TmBcauticrn, be cautiously withdrew it and t£r»w the door open. No one was there. He placed bis forefinger on his lip to enjoin BilenOe, and stood there listening. Nothing disturbed the silence of the hour except the Rwanh of the wayee as they struck the side of the chip. After Standing there for a few minutes, gave a sigh of relief and thrust the door to, saying, as he shot the bolt carefully: " * You complain that I have watched yon, which is not true, bSt I— am watched every hoar of tbe day !

When the real diamond safely reached me I watched the plot to its end, but dared to say nothing about -the scuttling of the8hip. - This fact they will try to hide, and it is one to whioh I specially wanted your attention called. Afterwards I went to Europe to see if I really had the diamond, for its counterfeit is said to be a 'remarkable stone. Satisfied on that point, I am returning to Bombay with my treasure; knowing thediffioulty, in s Dite of thé utmost; precautions being taken, of keeping the real gem as my own. I have not «ufTered it to leave my possession einoe. You will understand, then, that I wish to prevent them frpm getting hold of the crystal even. It would be disposed of as a genuine stone, so perfectly has it been faced, and that- is why I sent someone on the Queen of the Ganges to'try to explain matters -to you. Ytm missed^: your ship and fortunately T discovered you on mme. The fact that you willdesoend with the divers simplifies matters.' "He drew from lus pocket a scrap of paper and quickly sketched a plan of the sleepingberths on board the sunken ship. "'Thecros8l have made there on the paper iadicates where the box is ; a few strokes of a diver's axe and it will go to pieces. Fling out the cryEtal, and there the mutter "ends. " ' I can rely upon the truth of all you have Bftid?' I remarked, as the Rajhh finished his singular story. " You may, most implioitly ; the oaptain will give you Any substantiation of my position yon. may wish to ask for. Promise me that the crystal «hall never come above surface of the water.' " I held out.niy hand. « You may depend : cpon it,' I answered. Was it fancy, of did' I at that moment' hear some slight sound outside my cabin door ? I glanced that way, and the "Rajah, whose story proved most conclusively true,, pa I eventually found out, whispered nervously : • "'f% am watched ; they think they, have the -diamond and now they want my life ! ' fie' drew off the turban, in whioh he had again wrapped up tho great diamond. ' Hide it take care of it till morning for me.' " I thought for a moment what to do with the gem. It occurred to me that perhaps the Hindoos, after all, eùspected that the Bajah bad the diamond even then ; if so, failing to get it from him, they might naturally conclude it was in my possession, seeing him leave my cabin at such a late hour. I unscrewed the wide top of the swinging lamp, which had an opaque vessel for containing the oil, and into t.biw 1 dropped , the diamond, screwing the top on again. " 'It will not hurt it,' I eaid ; ' to-morrow you can easily get it out. I will burn the lamp all through the night, so that no oil will be left.* lie Rajah pressed my band again, and then I opened the cabin door. Ko one could be seen. I stood there watchin g him as he went elong, looking like a ghost in the dimly-lit way. Then I went into my cabin and closed the door. A second after I heard a sharp cry, which seemed to^be forcibly stopped. Without arming mysëlf in ahy ;ïrty. I ' rfi&-down the passage.

The Hindoo 'was too wary however : he stepped hastily back, then, as I missod my intended grip tof the knife, he raised it above his head, •<vith. a flash of the bladt. that I watched and waited to ward off. Out of the darkness, behind the spot where the Hindoo stood menacing me, I saw a bare arm oome, whioh twined itself round the fellow's neck, and dragged my assailant to the ground. it . was a sailor who happened, as he afterwards told nuo, to be lying half asleep in his bank, when, " hearing^/the-^o^i^^if ..A- «mfSe, :iieJ crept cautiously tip, ' -with -the - result - that the Hindoo's • Amiable intentions concerning myself -were foiled. ."The "rcnfasninç Hindoo preoipitately fled after the one I had struck, and who bad wifeely withdrawn himself from the fray.
