While thC people at large may endorse any measure looking to' a speedy termina tion of the war, it is safe to say that they Will oppose any- attempt on the part of the Government to take advantage of the occasion to saddle them with unnecessary burdens in the shape of bonds and the annexation ' of black territory.— Coast Seamen's Journal . ; L A story of; true mat'eship comes from down Wagga way, where a farmer hav ing, become ! totally blind 18 neighboring farmers decided to' cultivate his land for him, notwithstanding that they were par-' ticularlj. busy putting in their, own crops. Accordingly houses anli plCughs were set to work, and three paddocks, comprising 60ac. in all, were sown for him. ; '? ? ♦ * ' ?' * 'v,,'. ? Occasionally the public,; are, reminded of'the lingering existence of ancient and; forgotten institutions by the cropping up of a case under which somebody has to be sentenced/ ito stand in tlxe stocks, or something of the sort.

After its long rest it! should prove an interestiug novelty. Among the topics of ; the day is that of steamship fares/ between Melbourne and Sydney. It appears that while it costs, say, a pound; to go ,frpm Sydney fe Mel bourne in the Peerage, you can get from Melbourne to Sydney in the saloon for half that sum, and people are sitting up witn wet ciotns tied, round tneir neads to try And, puzzle, out a solution of the : mystery. ,It is, supposed that the V cut' : is a device . on the part of one company to force competitor to unite with it in! fixing a uniform tariff ; but that scarcely accounts for the people who want to get- out of Melbourne being specially favored.! We hereby suggest that since the Shops? and Factories Act, including' minimum wage provisions, has been in ? full swing : over therej the Pnly people who want to leave Melbourne' are those ' who haven't ; got billetsj' and the sweaters who find their occupation gone, tHe first of whom can't pay full fare for thpir passage, and; the second won't;1 : J : . .

R. H. Roberts.' It seems that a few hard-up old women and enterpris- . ing small boys have been raiding the exr ceedin^iy honorable gentleman's pad docksim search of sheep that have given up the ghost, and have, with- a: profane disregard of the sanctity of property, divested the corpses of the wool which j .would otherwise have been left to perish ; oh the bones, and secured a few pence i for. themselves at odd: times by selling these gleanings. The station; manager was horrified to observe dead sheep : rotting here and there with, the wool gone j off them, and invoked the majesty of law ; and order against the accused as a warn- i ing to aU and sundry. 1
