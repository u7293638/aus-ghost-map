Her «hair was raven black, and her teeth uncommonly white-and well set: while her eyes were of a bright brown-busy and intelligent.. FindingjHat what aha had to say was ' of great i^WjHmge, I took out some paper, and requestettSrÄr to repeat it slowly, while I wrote it-down. . ' She stated _ that on...' the previous afternoon, Hçnof 'Mitchell sent her ito Michaol Eronnan'o public-house at the cross-roads, about a -milo from Ballyfree, for one or two little matters. There was no person at home but,Mrs. Bren- nan. When'she had got-what she wanted she was coming away, but as : she came to the door she saw (Dan and John Costelloo walking up the road; and, sho turned back. She said to Mis. Brennàn'thàt shé'h'óped they'd pass by as she would not like them to see her, for John Gostelloe thought tb make free with her once' before, 'and threatened the next time he met her he would not. let her off. so easy. She went behind the door, hoping they would pass, but they: came into the shop, and she heard Dan toll Mrs. Brennan to bring them up half a pint of whisky. ', This frightened her very, much for she had no way of escape; but seek- ing the shutter of a press-bed lying open against the wall in the far corner of the room, she had just time to dart in behind it. There she stood breathless with terror ; ; Bhe could not Bee them; but could hear every word they . said. Dan Costellos began : "I: wonder what keeps ¡ Tom ; he's behind time. - Look there,'tis near three o'clock; and half-past two was the hour." "jPshaw ! man, /thai oíd turnip of his is'nt worth a pin ij; I've of ten told you to part it and get a decent one. Iwould'nt keep it.

I returned home with my prisoners. We' came' overibe. moutain by the pathway-' It was a beautiful morning1; the1 .'purple' tops' of ? the" mountains were beginning to acknowledge the golden tinge of a glorious sunrise; while por- tions of-the valleys wore still clothed with the white shroud of a dense fog.'through which the' corn fields'showed dimly, with stocks magnified into twice their real size, and, in some instances,; the broad yellow'surface'of the" flat uncut corn hiing heavy with excess'of-dew, through which the "red 7 poppies peered, with-corn- flowers .heavenly blue." Across the hill came, first, af solitary crow, ; with- slow and steady wing-then came another, and another-then . four or five-then too many to count before they : got mixed in their flight and had passed by then the whole army ----they had fixed upon the district of Ballyfree for that morning's ^occupa- tion. The cobwebs were all visible in various shapes and forms, composed of fairy strings of 'almost invisible pearls-'-Hke Lilliputian lace' patterns hiing in a monster ßhop---some wore like the crowns for baby's caps, starred out from a tiny circle in the centre and edged round with silver fringe, others were like long pieces of narrow lace that might be sold ¡by the yard, hanging in festoons .from the point of, one heather-bell to another. . When I read, not very long ago, of the crotchet work done by Dickens* spider, I thought pf ; the'cobwebs'I saw on that morning.; '.Talk of French;flowers, indeed 1 I tell you the most beautiful and ex- pensive variety thoy ever possessed 'could not bear comparison'with that sprig of . broken heath upon yon bank, or even with that com- mon lover's daisy: lying across the path; About two o'clock that day the prisoners were brought before the magistrates and ex- amined separately ; they both had the same, story ; that they had given Luke Farrell a seat on their car to S---, where he parted from-them,: saying he wanted to go to the bank to lodge a trifle of, money.., "No," said Dan, to' him, '« but to draw it all out and'tako it with you." .".No," he replied, ? " I'm not such a fool, 'twill :be| safer where it. is, I'll take but a trifle'with rae, and have thereat to the good when'I come (back again and bring Hugh with me, with the blessing of God." John said he met him again later in the day, and that he said he was going to start by the coach for- Dublin, on his way,,to Liverpool, and from that to America. ,'" ' ' Matt Finley, tho schoolmaster, was examined and prod uced tho letter. It bore the Liverpool and*. Dublin* postmarks,' besides -that of the country post town of the district, and .»was-as follows:-- , .

Constable Harvey'started pearly the ,'next morning' for Liverpool 'in' hopos that he might arrive, in time to prevent the:Costelloes 'getting)off to America,. but wrote the following /day to .say that he had ascertained that Daniel and John: Costelloe had'sailed for New York in a Bhip ' called the Brothers two day's before he arrived .in Liverpool, they had entero d their; names'as.Daniel andJohn Costigan. [All this time poor Hugh Fárroll was slowly creeping, from behind ? tho cloud bf death. Ho was now conscious; and began-to recollect all that had- taken placé. He was still very woak, but) the doctors' pronounced him out of danger. ' ; Thomas M'Dermott at first feared that' Hugh Farrëll ; would have died, and. ;that ' he might have been hanged for the murder if he did not save himself by turnin g ; but now that his recovery was rapidly progressing,and that the Costelloes had made their, escape, he felt inclined-to .re- gret hts confession. He could not now- be re- ceived as King's evidence,', as there, was no;per- son to be tried,but himself, and he felt that the disclosure he had'made would change tho caso against him from a gross assault upon tho son, involving' at most transportation for life, to that of murder upon . the ; father, affecting his "very life itself. . Tho weather about-this time underwent1 a very sudden change, and. for several days be- came wet and. stormy ; on one night it blow a perfect hurricane. . " A man who is born bo hanged will nover be drowned," said I, on reading the following paragraph in a Dublin newspaper, the third morning after Harvey had returned from Liver- pool :-"Total loss of tho ship Brothers, upon the coast of Wexford-dreadful loss of life." Then followed ' a detailed account of the ship- wreck of.?'.The Brothers," bound from Liver- pool to Now York, with a valuable cargo and a number of emigrants on board. Amongst tho lost was; tho name "John Costigan," and amongst, those saved /was "Daniel Costigan," with (brother to : John, lost), in a parenthesis after the name. The account statod, " that everything was lost -tho vessel was a total wreck, and the sur- vivors were in a misorablo state, somo almost naked-others totally so ; and . ronny much bruised and hurt, by being cast by the waves against tho. rocks. They Lad boon, howovor, hospitably treatod by tho inhabitants, who had supplied them' with clothes and food, and lodged them in an old mil], until thoy could hoar from their friends, or bo sufficiently reco- vered to return home." 'Harvey and another policeman wore des- patched to tho lUtlo town on tho coastof Wexford, to arrost Daniel Costelloe. On tho sixth day ho returned with tho prisonor, and Dan Oostelloo was forthwith committod to gaol, to stand his trial for the murder of Luke Fan-ell.

The assizes came round, and. there stood Dan Costelloe in the dock-his cheek not pale''but' i flushed, his eyes rolling fiery and frightened glances around ; ' and now and then a sudden contraction of the forehead and brow betokened bodily pain.
