SUNDAY TRAINS. To the Editor of the Gcdowj A dvertietr. ^ OIK,-As your columns are open to questions of public discussion, permit me througli that me dium to reply to a letter in last Friday's irnpres Bion, about" Sabbath Observance." It appears to me. that "Keep holy the Sab-' bath day," by Sabbath observers, i3 more talked of than observed, and strange to say. Sabbath observers must admit that tho Sabbath day is not a day of rest, but is perhaps the hardest day of work throughout the week-Saturday being the Sabbath day. The Sabbath day as you, sir, are aware, was changed by tho Apostles from the last to the first day of the week, in honor of Christ's resurrection, and the descent of the Holy Ghost upon that day. I am at a loss to know whether tho obligations which wcro imposed upou us by the Sabbath observances, were also transferred by that change t If FO, what was commauded under ti . old Law to do ?-to rest from servile works not under any circumstanccs to touch fire. Do " Sabbath observers" touch firo upon the Sab bath? Do they permit their domestic servants to work upon that day f I think, sir, these gentlemen arc enthusiasts, and their misdirected zeal is more to be pitied than censured. I consider that the best part of tho Lord's day should bo devoted to the Lord's service, but I submit it not inconsistent with true Christian propriety also to devote a portion of that day to rational enjoyment and healthful recreation. Those that toil and livo by the - sweat of their brow should have a little pleasure and amuse ment, and I think that the stoppage of Railway Trains upon the Sabbath day have in a great measure deprived them of those enjoyments by a misguided aud misdirected zeal. Your obedient Bervant, J. P. Wallace. Bellerine street.
