Lovely, smiling, splendid lady W. had never looked more stately and beautiful than she did that night. Hei? charms seemed diffused somehow, and she and Angelica s.at .ftpjposite ;like two mirrors reflecting on&another..; A summer, a spring bloom ingin brightnessj- their fans waved. The flowers seemed to fill the box. Even Lady Diana looked her best.. ' j M^. Bpsweil then discovered Dr. Burney and his daughter in another part, of the theatre. ** Mrs. = Thrale should not have been absent on such a night as this,' he remarked. Pr. Johnson again rebuked him; and, as ousual, Mr. Boswell listened 'with the greatest attention and -deference,. some- times adding a start as if to add emphasis to his respect. ' : The play began, and evenjDr. Johnson was silent. - . .i . : ; .-.', [ In great .acting there is some isubtle measure impossible fcfdeseribe, sbmetimes passing' in certain harmony, .and that night, when Hamlet .stood upon the stage, a mysterious; intelligence not to be ex plained seemed certainly and at once to flash between him and his audience. The plain, commonplace-looking man be came instantly, and without any effort, the master of all these splendid people who were watchiag him. It mas as if he were the pulse that flowed through their veins. This iour was his own, as^this mood was his, to which he gave the note, the tinwrth¥life almost. :- ' Hp^ nobly he stands listening, while the poor Ghost moans its -awful plaint. Hamlet's beautiful voice seemed' to strike home to every lieart when he answered in clear- tranquil . tones. Then ^se passion and remorse, and woes thicken as the play goes on, and the notes come full and dull with passion, and the words seem to break bounds, and jar and clang.

He has played his part with memory. He is a good repeater of other men's words.' ; But when Mr. Reynolds came into . the' box presently, and made some slight ob jection to some detail of Hamlet's perfor mance, the old man rose up in wrath. 'Let me tell you, ? sir, that David, is a jjenius, his fanae is j-rod^ious : his«xcel lenceas an actor is universally acknow ledged. He is more likely to ? be correct than you are.

Reynolds went on quietly talk ing, so quietly that Angelica asked herself in amazement whether she had dreamed that he had proposed. He showed her one or two pictures, explained what pig ments tie had used for them, and when Lady W. came in from the supper-room, with expressive looks and eyes directed curiously uppn the two, he waited [till she joined- them, asked her opinion of his picture, quietly included her in the con versation, and then walked away with herv.;^ .';?? ??-?'. ^- r ' ; , .
