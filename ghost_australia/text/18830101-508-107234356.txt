Father Passa^lia became a Jesuit at 16, has been Professor of Dogmatic Theology in tbe Eoman College, and . pubHshed-BB v a Ef£k voliuu&8 oxftfaBQihogy* -whicll bfi^uf evtSiiice^flfia ma^^^indJAraabishop^janghan, in a sermon ,on ' Hell' a Sunday or two ago, quoted fromPatiSer Psssaglia to prove the ever lasting nature^of futujSe ^punlsnnient, paying, at the saae%Hn»,jiiu|'h-- tribute 'fcVPiissaglia's learning and erudition. And yet this man ?was dispensed from ;'lris 'Trows and summarily driven from Borne by Mus^IX-.Jbecause he dared to advise th&lfefiiakaaliOT; of^he t^Sporal power and advocate a United Italy. The late Pope bad nothing but anathemas ior a ^aople straggling to . shake of -their chains ? 'bnt when the spoliator en tered bis own dominions, the faithful were called to resist bjj^ '^th 'flre 'and Bwbrdl ' ^Fjftth^r Pas tiaglia saw that the temporal 'power could .pot be maintained^' and therefore advised its peaceful relinqiushment. He had all the indiscretion of a candid friend, and suffered accordingly. -. After Being expelled from Borne he entered tho Pied montese Senate, became editor of a ipaper, and finally Professor in-the ^nivejcsitydE^nrin. Tjxe ' Tablet ' thinks 'that Father Passaglia -waa. 'led away by over-confidence in M' own, judg ment.' THs-may be true ; but it does not prove that his judgineat'was in'any way incorrect. .-On the contrary, time iifee verified bis statements and vindicated his wisdoni. ? We alluded the other day to the results of the junior public examinations held under the auspices of tbe Sydney University, -and we then pointed out tow unsatisfactory were the results achieved by tb.e pupils of tile. public schools of the colony, as shown by the large numbers vrho failed, to pass in English. The respite of the senior'' examinations have now-~beea published, and they are not calculated in the smallest degree | to change our opinion as to the value of the work of our educational institutions, at any rate, of those dirfectly under the control of the depart ment. Of course w« cannot give the numbers of candidates who presented themselves for | examination, but of those from the Brie ' bane Grammar School nine passed, three being in * the first class ; from the Sydney Grammar School ..six passed, two of them in the firs^-clase. ' Pajin tae Eortjstreet public school four passed, none of them in the first class. Of the candidates from Fort-street not one passed in English or Latin, -fiiough the latter form part of the regular currjiculujn.pf the school, and is to be taught to the fourth and fifth classes as a j matter of coarse; and is -not, as in many, if not f most private schools, treated as an optional j subject. It' will, not, : suffice to say that ' the I candidates from'F6rt- Btreet school were below thed; Average in intelligence. They were not, And a. conclusive proof of that is that they all passed in arithmetic and geometry. ^n like manner the results ol tbe * junior examinations -would Bliow that - the fault does not lie id anv defect in the teaching' staff; of the school, as compared with the other public schools of the colony . It ib and can be nothing but the result of a vicious system which; regards names as more important than things, and nas allowed itself to become ossified by the dead fonnulum which lies like an incubus on 'all wht- are snbjeet.tc ite iron role. ''We c^iii never hope to have sound primary instruction in this colony until our educational machinery is welded into one -harmonious whole, and the University and the grammar schools, high schools — or whatever they may be called-^ are brought to co-operate in perfecting a system of management for the more thorough instruction of the people. UniyeseitieB are -not intended merely to prepare men for the professions, but to diffuse intellectual light throagk the 'whole popu lation. ' The great -Scottish festival of the year is being celebrated to-day throughout . the length and breadth of sunny Australia with quite as much eclat and enthusiasm as in '-auld Scotland ' But under what different conditions End 'auspices. In colS Caledonia all nature is, as it were.TaiLeeD; everything out of doors fis bitterly cruel and un invitaag. The snow ''and tbie' ice, the''t)leak 'blustet^ng wind and Ahe dark^.. lowering clouds wear a stern, and forbidding aspect. There are no*«rieket matches- in the. land-of the mountain and the flo«sd; n-$ ' al fresco picnics; 310.- marine excursions ; ..no sporting1 carnivals, on the first day o£- the year.' But'-witnin doors warmth and merriment prevail, and . there is plenty of love and leal- heartedness in almost every iousehold-to make amende for the absence of genial Eing Sol and the gentle, balmy zephyrs. Yet it must not be forgotten.! that 'there., is much bitter mixed -with the sweet in the old land, for many of the. poop will even to-day be wandering about home less and hungry, ejnvering; with . cold and in dire distress and despair.

Jbo the care of *tbe ! State. The other religious bodies, if we except the Jews, are already heart and soul with the public school anwigemente. On all sides, there-, 'fore, there is a complete submission to the new order of things, and the lamentable ?failure of jshe Ministerial cry at the late election — that the 'Education Act waa in danger — has been fitly consigned, with the contempt ' it merited, to the limbo, of the Eama ghost. It is, notwithstanding, exceedingly likely that Among the Protestant denominations an effort will be made to secure the.rieading -of the Bible* in the State schools. A strong league for that object,.; -with Bishop Moorhouse at its head, has been established in Victoria, and the subject has already been mooted in this colony. The league does not profess to interfere with the principles of the Aot ; and it 'remains to be' seen how it proposes to carry its object into effect. At present we do not hear that any active measures are being taken..' The task will be no easy one in ^faoeof-rthe ceeent changes made by our Educa tion Act. « . The six blackguards with whom Mr.' Dillon xlealt. on Friday have no reason to complain of the punishment inflicted on^them. ^.Two months* imprisonment is by no means excessive j for men who first abuse and insult a man at his j own house, and then savagely assault and] threaten to murder, him' and those who come to j his' assistance. One of the witnesses deposed! that the. language used was-fearful. and that ! 'the cursing could be heard half a mile off,' j while dt was shown? that the defendants] threatened to shoot the plaintiff's horses, and] to 'pull the place down.' Under suchi circumstances it ib not ' surprising that the j plaintiff .and his servant should- have used] fire arms in their own defence, and that one of i their assailants should have gone off with aj charge of shot in .his legs. The -wonder is that '? persons who are assailed with brutal and un- ' provoked violence do not more generally protect i themselves iu the same way, and that in some j parts of the suburbs . where the police force is j insufficient, vigilance committees are not estabr i lifihed to keep order, and enforce some sort of j respect forthe rights of individuals. Such a thing i would not' be by any means desirable, and it is a i good -thing1 that -magistrates are prepared to inflict ?] exemplary punishments incases of the kind which j .come before them. There is, however, another j featureinthe case which demands serious attention j Macoordarioe with £be provisions of an Act passed ' during the last session of Parliament, the de fendants in the case in question were sworn and examined as witnesses, and, of course, flatly de nied most of the statements made, especially those as to the unprovoked character of -the as sault. They were not believed, but it is evident that there, must have been a great deal of perjury committed iu the case, preBumablyvby the de fendants, and it would be well to consider whether there is not sufficient evidence to sustain a charge of that kind against them. - The crime Is becoming distressingly common, and it is ne cessary to impress on defendants the fact that if they are allowed to become witnesses in their own cause, the obligation to speak the truth- is just as binding on them as on other witnesses. 'We recommend the patter to the consideration of the Attorney-GrM^ral.
