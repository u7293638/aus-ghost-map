'We take,, no' note pf time but'fronv its loss,' saya'Young] To Florence rBar ?Ting ton these seven days in Paris are eaoh one a century in itself, , whose death is longed for oven as its birth 'is known. Now, back again in her native country, she feels the hours no whit less.weari^' eome, and chafes and ?writhes beneath the voke that! has, been laid upon her. ..,??; Her husband's: coldness and evident; avoidance .are, of course, matters 'for : ?which Bhe should feel, .gratitude^, but they, too, gall and harass her in many ways. * . '? - : f -I'- 'J ?' ? She lets her 'thoughts Irun with ?wilful, directness upon the mani-she Iovob; or at: least believeB.sho couldlhave loved had. things gone Braoothly with her_,j and one day is startled; by -finding herself face to face with him. : ! o ?'?'.'? ;: ?? According to some.people, Mr. Mervyri is a very nice young man. -He certainly is nice in the .matter of olothea, andfeefy ?and figure.; and whatever hair his barber ; leaves him curlWeally beautifully'; ;.l Hia «yes, too, are blue as those Italian skies - travellers tell such horrid stories about ; ; and altogether lie,is.deoidedry handsome. ! But' whether; his mind is up to hisLbody - is another thing: ' ' ' ? '?' ; When Florence finds him standing in her path with liis hat off, he is looking specially handsome, and. .full of melan-' ?choly. He iras not, perhaps, quite; so melancholy the iraomenti before, but.he muatlove her indeed' to grow so despbn^ dent the very, imtant he sees her — or sees that she sees 'him;— it is almost the same. . i He reallydoes feel some dejection. as he; gazes at her charming face, and notes how it pales beneath his gaze. She might have been his, he tells himself,'had the Fates been propitious. By' J which _ he means, if the -Fates had endowed_;j'her with a liberal income. And how it is all' over, ''and the man he hates most :bn earth has stolen her from him. --???? : ? Butisit all over? he asks himself, as he watches her changing face, and' notes the deep ?? discontent bosomed;i:hi[.;her lovely eyes. To work the undoing .of'his enemy seems : to Mr. Mervyn' a' very' pleasingrpaatime wherewith to while' away these 'dreary ^inter days. ? , ,i ?:. Hour by: nour this thought grows with him, 'and strengthens into a positive de termination,' to lower the mau-wh'o had ?once lowered him in the esteem, .of '.his. fellows.'1 It is hia sweetest dream by night and day, and after a while he tells him self, with a fierce glow of delight, that he has sucoeeded :even beyond hia utmost expectations. Yet he iB hardly aware how far the wilful workings of a wayward heart have combined to help his cause. - 1 To Florence his love is but a secondary ?consideration when compared with her wild longing to escape from athraldom into which Bhe has been forced. A martyr dom the more terribly degrading in that she believesBafrington to be asindifferent to herj.'as she.to him. Mervyn's honeyed * words- falling -on her ear Bound to her as so many- instruments with whloh to work out her revenge on the - father and husband who, have betrayed her ; per haps, I indeed, .'bhe feels., even . . more strongly the desire to punish the husband ? thetman who .has deliberately wedded and then neglected her. She grasps' with a reckless haste at any means held out to her by. which she may fly from the cold ness ajnd loveless formalities of the life she- is now leading. ' And' bo the perishable days come and go, anjl the dreary silent Ohristmaa creeps past them, and the New Year is at'hand. Opening the door of the library, she enters ;the. room quie'v; and goes up;to ?wheretBarrington ir aitfejt;. . It is q\v;,te' ten o'olock, yet there iB^'Bombthmg ajtiit her of. wind, and fresh ohill tli%-,r. an^ats; .? the possibility of her having be..n, alidad, even on such a night as this. '? ' ?;' ' It is rainless, ' truly, but -the\ frost is ' bitingjYand the snow is falling Softly be-, tween 'earth and heaven; : ? ?' - '. Barr'ington, however, expresses neither surprise nor diBploaBure. Rising courte ously, he moves to one aide, thuB dumbly inviting her to cdme to the fire. _: ' I am not cold,' she says, with a little , deprecating gesture. v ' Ex'eroise provides the best warmth,1 w certainly,' returns he quietly. ' ? ?/ ''? ',Yes, I have been out,' says' Florence^ ' ' Ailittle imprudent, don'tyou think?' inquiries ?he, knocking the' -ash off his cigar, and finally throwing the cigar itself (with wh afappears to her almost a regret- ; ' f ul glance) into the fire. '?? ' ' ' WlMt I' she says sharply; ' Y(jur meeting him in this sort of way, and unattended.' ;- ..-? : :''^!\ She starts as if shot, but rallies directly, *' and walks straight up to the fire. -? I didn't know you werd your own de tective?* she says oooly ; ' but as it is 1 so, I am- glad: of it. It. simplifies mat ters ; and makes it easier : for me to tell you why I came here to-night.' ' . , ' She is' dressed in the gown she wore at dinner; a filmy whitestufl\ andvher'arms are barej:i!'iThey: are perfectly' moulded arms, andshine now cre'am-'white' beneath the glare of the lamps. It occurs to Bar rlngton at this moment that there would ba pleasuro,in pressing .one's lipsj.to such, fair sweet' fle'sh;- but he laughs .grimly, to himself as the idea presents '? itself to his mind.
