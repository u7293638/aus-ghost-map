ORIGINAL POETRY. "LIKE GRIEFS AT MORNING." —Geo. Eliot. A little flutter from heart to throat, A sob that breaks like a minor note, Then shadowy phantoms round me float, And the griefs come with the morning. O, sad to wake from the land of sleep, And see the ghost from the darkness leap! Night! could you not in your silence keep The griefs that come with the morning? 'Tis hard to feel in the rousing brain The sense of yesterday's deepened pain. O, hard to take to the heart again The griefs that come with the morning! Life's darkest problem before us lies, When daylight opes our reluctant eyes: How swift the shadowy spectres rise— The griefs that come with the morning! O, some time, surely, the pain will end, And sweeter visitants God will send Dear angel faces will o'er me bend, And joy will come with the morning! The day will break in a glory-gleam, With all the brightness of which we dream, O happy hour, when the windows beam, And the griefs go with the morning! JENNINGS CARMICHAEL.
