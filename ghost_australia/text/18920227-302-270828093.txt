THE EIGHT-HOUR DAY. (From the Glasgow Weekly Mail.) I may be dubbed a pessimist, A stnmpin Rad, am a’ the rest; But 1 ve a atammock can digest Sic compliments wi’ oDy man. 1 m like the cynic wi’ his lamp, When through the market place I tramp— x aye detest a polished scamp, An prize an honest oronie, man. - Ilgrivea me whiles to hear folk say !, AVe can t afford an eifeht-hour ihey taut; an* taye—fal^l 1 wecW-rvt !iin“ 4- comm'u! > 1 'ihe c_ra£ty rogues may oiyly nine; But, lam, were smairter than they think ; Their quackery in oor noses stink, We eanna thele their bummin, man. m'“ , y.e> ram, gm you an’ X io solve the Labor question try : .Uor wrt and wisdom baith apply, ; , An put oor heids togither man ? 'vi common sonse ye aye aeree. Sae kindly cock yer lug a wee, INor deom a rustic bard like me A Socialistic bletherer, man, ’Twad nearly gar a body bock, To hear prophetic puddocks croak— “ We maun compete wi’ ither folk.” The noodles aye keep ravin’, man. Tis theirs to guide the nation’s weal— Expose oor sins, their ain conceal, Bribe orators to soap us weel, While landlords dae the shavin’, man, Economy’s the latest shift, Ne’er dreamin’ that we see their drift. The poor are tell't to practice thrift By legislatin’ donkeys,' man. Gi e ilka prood presumptions brat, His wine, his sport, his baccarat, Oor bains may star, but what o’ that? We maunna starve oor monkeys, man. We’re daily dubbed by tyrants base, Wba hound the poor frae place to place, \et front the warl* wi* brazen face, An* justice still deny us, man. Tis they wba fill the sweatin’ dens, Lea’ destitute oor rural glens, They count their thousands by the tens, An’ pose as saints fu’ pious, man This foreign competition cry May suit the drone, but we reply— Why circulate the cunnin He,’ An’ rob yer luckless neighbor, man ? Why tax the nation to excess ? Why check an’ mar her guid progeas? Breed sin, corruption, and distress, An’ clog the wheels o’ labor, man. ’Tis sad in. an enlightened age Tae see oppression a’ the rage— Poor lassies for a triflin’ wage In field and factory workin, man, We even ace oor bits o’ weans Compelled to rack their tender banes, An’ through oor alleys, streets, an’ lanes The ghost o’ Famine lurking, man, -j h' Ere men o’ competition rave .., < ■ Let them release the British slave O’ minin’ royalties and save The nation frae sic plunder, man. The foreigner’s chance is unco sma’— For speed an’ skill wc bang them a’— But hoo we can compete ava Is faBt creatin’ wonder, man A fig of Germany or France ; i Gi’e British workmen hauf a chance, ; An’, lod, they ’ll mak* their rivals dance' Until their legs are weary, man. The workin’ class, why over tax— Why heap sic burden’s on their backs ? Though lawyers, lazy drones, and quacks May blubber till they’re bleerie,-raani-i.j^ Oor /‘ornaments ” wad ne’er be missed ; Let's wipe them aff the pension-list, An’ sic absurdities resist As nursing foreign paupers, man. Sin’ charity beging at hame, Auld soldiers ha’e an honest claim; Mong those wha focht for Briton's fame Let’s distribute oor coppers, man. Despite the noble charge they, made, The heroes o’ the Light Brigade Were for their courage poorly paid— That’s hoo the nation served them, man. They bravely focht, they bravely foil; E’en rode into the " jawB o’ hell ” ; We stump an’ o’ their valor tell— But, a’ the same, we starved them, man. We sing, 11 Brittannia Rules the wave We’re freemen—lod, we’ll ne’er be slaves— Oor stirrin’ patriotic staves ;•' We lilt wi’ fcunefu’ measure, man. An’ yet, when I reflect awhile, There’s no’ a single foot o’ soil Whereon a freeman’s free to toil, Save at the landlord’s pleasure, man. “ We can’t afford an eicht-hour day,” ’Tia crafty rogues wha tell us sae; They grind the poor relentlessly, . . Spread misery an’ starvation, man They fain wonld gull the workin’ class, The life an’ soul oot folk harass When usefu’ measures they could pass To benefit the nation, man.
