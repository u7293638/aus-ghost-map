The Appeal to Harold.* Haro! Haro! Judge now betwixt this woman and me, Haro ! She leaves me bound, who found me free. Of love and hope she hath drained me dry— Yea, barren as a drought-struck sky; She hath not left me tears for weeping, Nor will my eyelids close in sleeping. I have gathered all my life's-blood up— Haro 1 She hath drunk and thrown aside the cap. Shall she not give me back my days ? Haro I I made them perfect for her praise. There was no flower in all the brake I found not fairer for her sake; There was no sweet thought I did not fashion For aid and servant to my passion. Labor and learning worthless were, Haro! Save that I made them gifts for her. Shall she not give me back my nights ? | Haro! ! Give me sweet sleep for brief delights ? Lo I in the night's wan mid I lie, I And ghosts of hours that are dead go by: Hours of a love that died onshriven ; Of a love in change for my honor given: She caressed and slew my soul's white truth, Haro! Shall she not give me back my youth? Haro 1 Haro 1 Tell thou me not of a greater judge, Haro 1 It is he who hath my sin in grudge. Yea, from God I appeal to thee; God hath not part or place for me. Thou who hast sinned, judge thou my sin . ning; I have staked my life for a woman's winning. She hath stripped me of all save remember ing— Haro I Eight thou me, right thou me, Harold the King! —H. C. Bunner the Manhattan. * The right of appeal to Harold ;of Normandy •was like the Boman citizen's right of appeal to Caesar. The cry of " Haro !" was the invocation that called him to protect or to avenge the wronged.
