Kiama Ghost Again. At the Orangemen's meeting held in Kiama on Wednesday of last week the Rev. B. Stephens, of Jamberoo, an alleged minister of the Gospel, expressed the hope that the Slatierys would visit Kiama. A pious wish, , indeed ! The Kiama Ghost has been slum bering for some time, and this reverend gentleman thinks the present a good oppor viii.li vj v\j loviru ujiu ajjiuu ui uxtiuui v twill cause all the bad feeling he can between Catholics and Protestants, His congrega tion is but little to be envied if ho has no other lessons to teach them bub hatred of their neighbour ; or if he can provide no other entertainment for them than lis'tenins to a pair of impostors telling barefaced lieg and relating obscene calumnies about the Catholic Church. Should tho Slatterys go to Kiama the respectable Protestants will undoubtedly ignore their presence ; and we feel sure they will leave the Rev. Stephens nnd the riff-raff of tho town to revel in the filthy' yarns of the 'ex-priest' and the ' bogus' nun. ?
