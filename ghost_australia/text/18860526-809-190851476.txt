SOUTH SUBURBAN GAS COOT ANY. to tub rihtok ol' tub agk. Sin, — I perused with amusement Sir Archi bald Michie's letter in your to- day's issue, it is fortunate for tho directors of tho South Suburban Gas Company that thev possess such ability so close at hand to dim tho outlook of innocent shareholders. I know well where the shoe pinches. I have no doubt, before tbe "ghost is laid," the whole truth will come out. —Yours, &c.;, DAVID WHITLEY, 25th May.
