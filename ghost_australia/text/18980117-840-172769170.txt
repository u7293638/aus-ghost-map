-'-I POETRY. The Shi of Omission, It-'.sn't the thing you do, '.dear, -\ It's the; thing yoii leave undone, .» ' Which give3 you a bit of a heartacho ' , : At the setting (if the siin. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, ' The flower you might have sonti dear, ' Are your haunting ghosts to-night.' ' The stone yon might have. lifted . Out of a brother's way, The bit of heartsomo counsel " Yon were hurried too much to say . The loving touch of the band, dear, The gentle nnd'winsomc toco That yon hnd no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily out of miad, These chances to be angels Whicli even mortals find — They come in night and silence, Each chill reproachful wraith, When hope is inint nnd flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. - For life is ail too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion t That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's tbo thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache At the setting of the sun. — Margahet E. Sangster.
