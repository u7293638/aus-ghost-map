NAPOLEON III. 9TH JANUARY, 1873. His silent spirit from the place Slid forth, unseen ; amid th« throng Of those whose love outlived disgrace,-- . Whose fealty to the last was strong, 'Midst homage 'neath Fate's adverse reign, Paid to the star shorn of its rays, How passed the EXILE ?-Lingering fain» As never once in prouder days P The MOTHER and the CHILD were there, Discrowned and disinherited, No hand henceforth to right the HEIR ; New griefs to bow the golden head. How passed NAPOLEON P-prizing more Old fame in camp and council won, Or fearless ENGLAND'S ogis o'er The future of her ally's son P Gate of that world we know not yet ! What thou beheld'st who may proclaim P Were spirit-ranks, in order set, Haunting thy portals, as he came, With voices murmuring " Our life-torch. Unspent, was quenched at his behest." Did by-gone princes fill the porch, BOURBON and VALOIS and the rest P How passed the SOLDIER ?-cold and stern, 'Mid weaponless, reproachful ghosts, As when he led them forth to learn How fight the hardy German hosts P How passed the EMPEROR where THEY gazed, Once wearers of the Ancient Crown P As one who knew its lustre blazed The brighter ere he laid it down ! How passed he P-Brighter grows the dream!-» Tlrroughyon accusing Bpi rib-band, Beyond the scornful Old Regime, Another group of watchers stand ! Those hands are stretched to greet him now, That once CHARLEMAGNE'S proud sceptre won; , While hastes HORTENSE, with beaming brow,-. [ No longer banished from her son ! ! W, N. B.
