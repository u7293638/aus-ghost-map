A NIGHT AND A MORNING IN A sariss PASS. >Ye liad nn-irly reached the end of our all too brief holiday among the peaks aud pas«cs of SwiUorlaud when, one evening, nt llie close of a somewhat toilsome cxcurriou, wc arrived at ; ilic hotel at winch «c hoped to find hospitality for the night. In our party wore two ladies, ft Loudon suburhiui vicar, a Yorkshire woollen j manufacturer from HaJifar, and two or three i otbets who need not be distinguished. Already j we had more than cue mirth -provoking adven ture, and when wc reached the hotel we ucrc in a mood to cateb and to enjoy the humorous side of everything, and lo make the best of what ever circumstances might be in store for us. The proprietor of the bold received us witb much politeness, but was plunged in grief that he had to inform us that the hotel was full. Dinner, of course, wc could have, but as to beds, that was simply impossible, llowctcr. at the end of a long parley he undertook to provide for us sonic kind of sleeping accommodation, if wc did not mind » little iaconvcnicnc?. Wc did not mind anything, except the incon- i reuknee of being compelled to go on, and ! ».Iid!y, therefore, accepted his offer. The . dinner was real mid met with keen appreciation, ; but tbe sleeping nccouimo iatiou was phantnunnJ. i We soon saw what had been in the proprietor's ; mind when he told us that the hotel was "full,'' ! Before ten o'clock tables were removed and ' portable Lcdstend of various sires mid conditions , were dragged into tbe r.utlc ii vuingcr. liut we : lonke l at oncb other out of the corner of one eye, bitterly conseious thai not one of these shake- i douns vas for us. It woe too true. We foil ta laughing, tbe only way of raising our spirits, which, despite the cheerful uioo l iu which we ctiUrcd tbe Lo'cl. began rapidly to sink, as we began to roulLc what the cxj'ciklcis of the nigiit would be. ; Tbe two ladies Ind already retire 1, not to bed, but to a corridor upitairs, where tbey | were to sit or lie all night on a stunted little B>fn, which might liaie hthl two pe'tons fairly vi!! if tluir l.nlirs bid leituiiia'icd at llxr ribs; and this with a freezing temperature roiuid the betel, about which the icc lay thick. The floor of our lostcliv was iudee-1 ically liiriu-r than much snow in the pas.5 that uoicr uiJts at all. Jbit to return to tbe gvntlemcii. Forlun- attly it Lcriiie I (bat iue,«-l of ub wcic dieijiles of lhe immortal Mhik T.iplfy. Yi'c not only Ijour wr.vcV half' 'so mirthful as wo v.crc to be.

Yea, lucre was no doubt something to look at. Ptobatdy mitbiu j the four walls of mo.t metrgcrics a more ex.- i Inordinary object would nut Ire found than the 1 tourist who occasioned this touching reference, j But tbe next raocu-nt 1 was patting on my j boots and bartering out. I found a crowd ' gaziog at a tecte lb© same io its nature as 1 had i seen from tbo Oonnitsry wiodow of tbcGrimsel i Hospice, bdt on a scale of magnificence not ! possible there. The rays of dawn had here a hundred nrilea of country ou which to throw j their frcsoocs. Tbey teemed to shoot westward from »ome pool of light bidden about the Sl < Golhard, toucbiog witb tbe imffable roM-bloth of an Alpine ruo:ntog every while mountain on j their way. The glow was ou the Leckihorn, the Gletocherhorn, the Salensteek, lie Mut- tbora ; and far away orer the Kb6ne valley the higlicst rampart of Europe nfl cted tbe aplen- doar from Monto Rosa to the giants about Ghooouaix. \- It was only four i.it. yet, and our beds were sot to be ready until eight. Wby return from such a eight to that so lie d monger where no woeful a night Lad been spent with the chatter ing ghost of the chamois I Why not rtav out and go higher f 1 So we went higher, over the spurs of tbo Furkaborn, until a face of broken rocks were reat-hed from which we guard onr heart's desire. The sight was almost more than the unrcstrd nerves could hear, and a strange half- fear of falling into depths thirty, fifty, a&1j even scrcnty miles away — hot seeming to he quite near— made one hold to the rocks and plant the iron-point of one's staff more firmly. There was no danger, only a sense of Icing drawn down into the gorges that opened sub- limcly to Eontb, south-west, and west. On the ajghl the Sbreckhorn (13,886) and the Finster- auliorn (14,026) stretched their riinpes above rthc glaciers like headless eagles with outspread wings. In front, below mc, gaped the gorge of the Moltliom. But what uiadc the head swim with a delirious awe was the opening up of the ice-deptbs between the masses of tbe WeiEsborn and the Mattel-horn. Though fifty miles awnv the height ond lustre of these Alpa exposed Ibcm to clearest new from the platform— 8,fiQ0 feet high— on whieh I stood. One gorge seemed to open beyond another ; one abyss turned and j shclrcd into abyfscs more ineaEUielcss, until the I foul of the spectator felt half constrained to | yield itself to tbe immensity around and be loxt I in tbe nothiocness that seemed its due. From the "beatitudes, however, hunger ond j weariucps bronght us down. Breakfast was i followed by the iong looked-for iicd, where one slept with a busiuess- likc dcteniiination to make up arrears. No pisly death's bead Ecared the angels from the pillow, no leaden door-mat weighed upon tbe vein?. Rising atonl two o'clock mid-day, the hotel sc-cincd frozen, though n hot eud was fliimn? and it was the nineteenth of August. Ail hope of organized devotions for that day was gone. The vicar and his friends, and even this blithe child were still lapped in slumber. One most cither go hack to l>od or walk ; it was loo cold to sit about in tourist costume. | Most unwillingly I left tbo hotel behind, i My friend was to catch me up by diligence at Uos|fcntLall ihe next morning, when wc \w,ulj | cross the St. Golhard uus together, and tj>end , Mondnr night at Airolo. , Joyfully 1 strapjred on the knapsack and struck | out for Ileal p. The blood began to flow more warmly, and the raptures of solitude in the ' mruntaiiis found their way iuto heart and speech. It was the only Sabbath service I C"uld , have, and as, hounding dowu the fctecp road, I i offered at the allars of the heights such scrili-c ; as 1 could. Walking is ioinclinics not mere walking, but the whole nature, body, roul, arid spirit, in . religious exercise, Tiy that Lit uf road from the Furka to Itoalp. It'is only eight and n hdf ! miles, but it has a g'orious full of nearly DjOfiO fet t in that distance, and from beginning to end : it is a dalforni from which the eve look tut 1 upon uhat inspires. All the empty ililig.nccs wanted lo pick one up, but it was worth a fee to he put into a dusly eoieh.

The road here i.s tiro counterpart of the I'liika Zi,;.rgs. It Eives a beautiful view of the Ci.-men Tim1, a valley straight as au arrow, mid watered by lhe Ib-alpcr Ib- iiss from Realp lo Audi-rmatt.
