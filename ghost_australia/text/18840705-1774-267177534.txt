Diocese of Clonfert. Yesterday, 20 April, the parish priests of this diocese assembled at Loughrea, where the Bishop resides, to select in the usual form three persons to recommend to the Holy See, as qualified for the position of coadjutor to the Venerable Bishop. At Dr. Duggan’s request, the Most Rev. Dr. McISvilly, Archbishop of Tuam, the Metropolitan, came to assist at the functions. There were only fifteen parish priests present, three being absent from illness, and four parishes being vacant. The Solemn Mass of the Holy Ghost was sung ; and then the voting took place, and the suffrages were very scattered. Five votes were given for the Rev. John Healy, D.D., the Prefect of the Duqboyne section of Maynooth College ; four votes for the Rev. P. Costello, Administrator for the Bishop of the parish of Ballinasloe ; four votes for Rev. Dr. Maloney, President of the Diocesan College ; one vote for Very Rev. Jerome Fahy, P.P. and V.G., in the diocese of Kilmacduagh ; and one vote for Rev. Canon John Monahan, parish priest in the diocese of Ardagh. The minute of the proceedings was forwarded at once to Rome ; and it is understood that the Bishops of the province will meet about the middle of next week to take into consideration what advice in the matter they will submit to the Holy See.— Tab Let.
