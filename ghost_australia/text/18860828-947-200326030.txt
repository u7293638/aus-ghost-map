i v,r ECHOES OP MELBOURNE::;, i '? '?'' ' TBt Thh Ghost, i , ..', , No sooner has .tho Ministry been relieved ;of :,its troubles over ; the woollen industry ? than ? it is plunged into fresh ones in the j shape' of water; The second- reading of the Irrigation Bill, the Magnus opus ot' the ises'sipni-has beenit is true.agreed to with Put a division; but i from all amiearances' ; the passage of the measure throughCommit jtee will not be all iplain sailing. . Mr. Bent ;a3 leader.of the Opposition bffered.to allow I the Bill to go through at one sitting.justaai ;he offered to accept the Government Tariff proposals, but ;the Government for some inscrutable , reasons, declined, the friendly i offer, and:the debate will now in all proba-/ ibility-.be extended .over j several weary i weeks, to the exclusion of all other useful; legislation.- ....... , ; ..,.?,., : i .Perhaps Mr. ;Deakin is brimming over, ! with.pent-up eloquence, for the threatened, four hours' speech -has, not yet been.de-' liyered, -or' perhapsi Mr. Gillies deems, it , safer to ;keep .honourable members' - mindaf I exclusively ; on water.lest a,certairi.histori-i . cal'personage-r-wliose'existence by the.way is - deniod bythe-Eev. ^ Charles, Strong,— should find the -proverbial work 'for idle hands to' do,' and' topics of a more exciting character should be brought on the politi-: cal tapis. Any' way, the Ministry neglected. ;to a,yail;theinselves of Mr. Bent's sensible: offer, and preferred to allow 'the' flood of talk to ' take its course. Had the Irriga tion Bill been passed without a lengthened debate, there would have been nothing for honourable' members to do, for the bill' of 'fare set before them at the commencement i of the session i was so meagre1 that it iwould' have' ;beeri! exhausted, 'and : then there would : have been a possibility, of ; ? awkward questions i being raised which ? the Premier would willingly see : relegated to the.
