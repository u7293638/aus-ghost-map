ANTICIPATORY. Dull verses, depart on your way ! I'm sad and unable to joke, Expecting the printer to say These rhymes go in columns of smoke. I weep and am pale as a ghost, Not a ghost of a hope dees remain. As sadly I post to the post, I ever shall see them again. In vain will I seek for repose When I think of their sorrowful doomâ€” Lost! lost in a desert of prose, Where poetry never can bloom. Port Lincoln. T. B.
