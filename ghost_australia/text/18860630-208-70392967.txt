Hard to Please. SoL'I--A rude bar-room in the Western part of America. Enter Arkansas, with re. volvers in his belt and bowie knives in his boots. This is the great mining bully, dreaded, admired, and always " suffering for a fight." He is bent on one now. The meek landlord is his victim to-day. He means to goad him into a quarrel. Arkansas had been at the inn three days, and got no one to 6ght. On the fourth day Arkansas got drunk. Pre sently Johnson, the landlord, came in, just comfortably social with whisky. "I reckon the Pennsylvania 'lection \---" began the inoffensive host. Arkansas raised his finger impreesively, steadily, and confronted himn, Snidli:--- "Wha-what do you know a-about Pennsylvania? Answer me that. Wha what do you know 'bout Pennsylvania I" "I was only goin' to say-" "You was only goin' to say. You was I You was only goin' to say-what was you goin' to say? That's it! That's what I want to know. I want to know wha--what you (hie)-what you know about Pennsyl vania, since you're makin' yourself so d---d free.

Said Johnson, backing into a corner, Mr. Arkansas foilowing menacingly : " Why, I never said nothing, Mr. Arkan sas. You don't give a man no chance. :I was only goin' to say that Pennsylvania.was goin' to have an election nextweek--that was all- that was everything I was goin', to say. I wish I may never stir if itr wasu't " . Well, then why d'n't you say it What did you come swellin"around that way for, and tryin' to raise trouble?"' "W~y, I didn't come swelin' around, Mr., Arkansas. I juist---" " I'm a liar, -nam I Ger--reat Cosar's ghost- " With that Arkansas began to shoot, and the landlord to clamber over benches imnd men-and every sort of obstacle in a frantic desire to escape.
