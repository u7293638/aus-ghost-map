LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, Sept. 27. Huilnnyaccidents, of course, are "nowhere in comparison with the late tremendous may chance upon the river, at the report of the Board of Trade issued last week upon the subject is worth attention That 1265 pa; Benger should have been killed, and 1,28 injured, out of a total of ri52 millions (exch sive of season ticket holders) is really no alarming, less than one in four million killed, and rather more than one in half a mt lion injured, is but a small percentage Bn when one reads that no less than 042 five of officers or servants of the railway con- homes have been screened out of a compart try ely few thousands, the matter become grave enough Of the lines that have attained a bad eminence for disasters the London and North-Western (which, however, In also the greatest length of line stands first There is, or was, I remember, a line in Scotland, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh which had so high a reputation for in munity from accidents that it was termed "the innocent railway No collision had ever occurred on it, not even guard or porter had succumbed to what in the well termed their iron fate, no suicide had ever thrown himself on the metals before an advancing train But the reason of tin (I regret to add was that although there were metals there were no engines, nor ever has been, the company never having got sufficiently far out of its Financial difficulties a starting as to purchase what I believe is called " rolling stock. The sleeper and rails were rather a wasteful piece of expenditure, but they did at least point a moral against beginning a railway before counting the cost But the extravagance of some of our newspapers in purchasing telegraphic information is almost equally laugh and has not even a moral to show for it Think of a newspaper correspondent telegraphing to his journal that a wasp hovered round the Queen during the Highland games last week, and very nearly bit her, but was providentially driven off by the intrepidity: and presence of mind of Viscount Macduff and this was a Scotch paper too Even B iron Reuter was so good as to inform us the other day, by electric wire, that at a public dinner (I have forgotten w here) the Prince of Prussic sent round to General Somebody (I have for gotten whom) to say he would take wine with him, and that the general was deeply moved by the condescension This is surely the very prostitution of Science, thus to make her the handmaid of Sjcophancy and Snobbtsm It is, I hope, not quite true that "the misfortunes of our fellow creatures are not altogether unpleasing to us, but it is certain although we are far from wishing catastrophes to happen-that we " snatch a fearful joy " from the recital of them I leave out of the question the relief afforded to the newspaper editor during the "slack" time of the year by the plethora of " copy " which is begotten by such circumstances, he is no more to be blamed than the dweller on the coast, who picks up the broken wreckage of some ill-fated ship, and calls it a godsend, nor am I inclined to be hard upon those who sit down with obvious satisfaction to air their views as to how this or that his chance would have been averted, chiefly by the use of vv md bags The cacoethes sa bench is a malady quite dissimilar in origin to delirium tremens, and though its consequences are most deplorable (for I have observed that when there is much amateur correspondence newspaper proprietors are not so eager to pay for literary worth) one must acquit the poor folks who suffer from it, it is their unhappy instinct during " the silly) season to take pen in hand, and if a subject is afforded them they seize upon it with an avidity indeed only equal to that of the v ulture, but meaning no harm But I am not quite sure that the general public is so innocent Their intense interest in any catastrophe by land or sea reminds me of a most harmless but eccentric old bachelor of my acquaintance, called by his friends " the petrel, who always starts for a rock) coast in stormy weather, "Not that I wish people to be wrecked, he says, "Heaven forbid , only, there is a wreck, I should like to see it " Now, although ever) one is doubtless give ed at the appalling misfortune that has befallen the passengers on board the Princess Alice, it would be better, I think, if the appetite for its details was not quite so Keen Satisfaction, of course, is not the right word to use, but undoubtedly a very great excitement is afforded by the perusal of the personal narratives and evidence of Buiuioia" Supposing everyone was to put by a penny which is very cheap for an ix citement every time he looked at the paper with this in view, and then should forward the whole amount to the families of the drowned It would not only be a charitable act, but, upon my word, I believe a just one In great criminal cases as very one knows, the collateral circumstances are often the most striking, what comes out indirectly, and sometimes with but little bearing on the case in point, shows sometimes stranger than the crime itself or its cause And this is also the case with great catastrophes In the terrible disaster that has just happened there was nothing improbable, however unexpected, sooner or later, in a crowded highway like the river, where every ship captain seems to have done what he would as to steering, without rule or guidance, some such incident was inevitable, though the consequences of this one chanced to be exceptionally tremendous But the circumstances that have been brought to light by the subsequent inquiry are most remarkable and unlooked for It is exceedingly shocking, no doubt, that so many bodies should remain unidentified, for this proves how lightly linked to the affections of their fellow creatures these ill-fated persons were That they had all some one to love them is likely enough, and their friends were perhaps country people, with whom they did not often correspond, and who to this moment are ignorant of what has befallen him. But they must have bad acquaintances in London, if it was but the landlady with whom they lodged, and none of these seem to have taken the trouble so much as to give information to the police. The poor souls have " gone under very literally, and it is nobody 's business to look to the matter Yet even this is not so sad as the fact that more than 120 persons are known to be missing not found dead, or known to have been on board the stink ship at all-but absent from their homes I remember the same thing to have occurred during what was called the Regent a park catastrophe, when so many) were drowned through the breaking of the ice one winter All the bodies, from the nature of the case, were recovered, but there remained a long list of names for whose owners their weeping relatives inquired in vain They must all, it will be observed, as in the present case, have disappeared at or about the time of the accident, and since there is no particular season for such disappear- ances, these myster tous losses must be always happening If these 120 missing are really drowned, the total deaths by this mischance on the river must approach 800, but it is probable that many of them at least have been put out of life, or left it voluntarily some other way, or which is also common enough have taken the opportunity of the catastrophe to withdraw themselves from their present surroundings In the Regent's park case I remember Several instances of this, where the would be dead were recognised, some time afterwards in distant places and restored very unwillingly to their friends' In cases of this kind the morbid impulse figures very largely, and induces men, and less frequently women, to act in a manner for which no ordinary reason can be given I see for example that one person has thrown himself off a bridge through inconsolable sorrow for the loss of his wife and children in the collision, when, as a matter of fact, he had no children, and his wife was not on board the steamer at all. Among the smaller incidents of the catastrophe v a very dramatic scene, as I have be informed, between two brothers, co of whom believed the other had be drowned- for both had been on board t ship-and who met one another while end vouring to identify the dead Upon the whole the accounts in the papi have been very creditably) written, with any attempt to pander to the Lute for t horrible It may be said, indeed, that to he done so would have been to paint the lil but the temptation to the penny) a Funeral been extreme What he suffers is to gathered from the description of a table carriage accident this week, which began thus : " At Hurstmonceux castle last So dan) thercwasnffcW chance of a serious cat' trophe, but the gentleman in question v are told, escaped with some "hanUoi bruises I am sorry) loses that the Earl directs' the poor shipwrecked souls who roach 1 barnes bank last week, to die from eating' and exposure has been brought to land aft so much pains and trouble only to be broken up She will surely never put) in this with e expenses of her recovery, which, never theresa, is a matter to be proud of have been informed, by the bye, that I private finn made any genuine offer to rather that is, no firm that had the decease Â£20,000 or so to spend in the operations ) On one did hope that those lines on the Roy George which were so well drilled into us infancy could have applied to her.

only in the streets by boys who ask) you if you don't want to marry, so that the very getting hold of a copy by a lad: must be an embarrassing matter There has been a great deal of talk about the social status of a British soldier, and how infamous it is that when in his uniform people of good condition object to sit down with him at the common table of an hotel but I would like to see one of his own officers setting the example The fact is, such a grievance might occur once in a dozen years as in the particular case about which so much noise has been made, the soldier: being a young man who had runaway from his friends, and was being entertained by his uncle, but pay rates, as a general rule, have not the means to dine at aware there A for the principle of the thing, the class who talk loudest about the false pride of the community is the aristocracy, who well know that they will never be placed in such at my odious position as those who have off ended in this matter Perhaps, if others them I aches were less ashamed of wearing their uniforms in public, something might be done towards raising the social position of the private soldier in the eyes of his fellow countrymen

after all, are not essential, Mr Spurgeon seems to me to be an excellent fellow He has not only much humour, but its usual accompaniment, strong common sense He has been preaching 111 his happiest vein against asceticism, taking for his text the mind of "St Anne, whose unpleasant habit it is to sleep upright in their coffins "Do you think, he asks, "God wishes to make us miserable' Go into your gardens, these summer evenings, and see the millions of bright creatures flitting about them , walk by the sea shore and see its edge fringed by the shrimps and sand hoppers at their play and then

The mass in question was performed at the first communion of a school of nuns after which 60 of them were taken ill, but it appears that the confectioner held " independent opinions,â and wished to ban the ceremony into discredit.

justice of this sort it seems to me that the country, which is in fact the prosecutor should make every amends for it in its power There have been of late some very proper dissertations against bad language As one who never uses it, unless my shirt collar button comes off, or I tread like the Yankee with stockinged feet on the business end of a tin tack I have a right to speak with charity upon this subject That the lower classes swear considerably 13 but too true I see the penn) fines raised in one public house for aw hearing they were given to the Princess Alice fund-reached lia in one week, but perhaps folks swore on purpose in order to be liberal I think the religious public are liable to take too serious a view of this offence, from a misunderstand ing of its cause When a man swears good temper it is in many cases from mere paucity of words man of us have a very limited vocabulary, and we mistake force of words for strength of expression The short for sanguinary is a coarse word but it has now no bad meaning [As a matter of fact it is as a substantive, the short for "blood and wounds which is the corruption of ' Gods wounds, the religious oath of our virgin queen, Elizabeth, but its original meanings I disappeared ] Ev er) body has heard how The Times turned O'Connell into ridicule by reporting his " base, bloody, and brutal it lugs as " base, bay, and brutal

readers remember how the English divine abroad used to hurry his positions by shrieking out, Cumberland Northumberland, M eÃ¤traoreland and Durham, at the son of his voice from the car nage window It had all the effect of an oath, and therefore 03 I humbly think was almost as bad Now the use of the short for sanguinary when not uttered in anger is really less objectionable, though not be pretty I am not defending any such vulgar utterance of course, but merely putting in a word of common sense A respectable lawyer told me the other day that he once overtook a birdcatcher in the country, who was walking with a friend from a railway station He heard the friend say, "Have you got any birds ; and this was the answer, 'Birds' The blank (short for sanguinary) trains make such a blank noise

night A less conscientious or more hasty tempered muster might easily have declined to believe so improbable an explanation, but Mr Forbes took the man's watch himself for a week, and on the seventh

Of course, I was sorry about it too, though if it had been fated that any one of my acquaintances must needs have put an end to his existence, I should have preferred it to have been Frawley He was said to be a very rich man, and certainly give himself all the airs of one, while his conversation was of that character that I could only hope, for the sake of his companions, that in whatever state of existence he should now find himself he would be dumb He was the bore of the smoking room, and had shortened the lives of several of its frequenters to my knowledge He would tell us how he made his money, and his difficulties about disposing of it, and how he had recently lost his partner it was supposed from gold on the brain A evil, I came back to town two weeks ago and found nobody in it. The club was a Sahara, a mausoleum, with no one but the hall porter, five - and - twenty waiters, and myself in it I was sitting in the vast smoking room after my lonely dinner, and woke up from an unrefreshing nap to find that I had got a companion in the very next arra chair, and as sure as I write this it was old Drawlej. I looked at him as Scrooge in the " Christmas Carol" tried to look at the ghost of Marley, and quite as unsuccessfully I said to myself, "You are a humbug, you are an undigested piece of cheese, and I do not believe in spirits but still Drowley was there. He said quite, in his old style, " How do you do ' We are quite alone here I have got more money than you ever saw in your life made it myself, sir, every penny of it and I want your advice how to dispose of it It was dreadful, but still I had the common sense and presence of mind to say, "Give it to me" "Pooh, pooh, he said, "You are joking, and it is not everybody who can afford to joke, sir I can't for one, and yet I am pretty warm ' This I thought, considering where he was probably not in the daytime, was likely enough " I hate jokes,' he went on " That fool Smiler has made a joke of me lately.
