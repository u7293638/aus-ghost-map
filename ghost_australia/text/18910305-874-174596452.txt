Si-hli-nter decs win the Cup.' Wager, boss,' says Wilhuu. So that little trouble was oil' my mind, and 1 went out and laid right and left against Schlenter." * * * * " Lord love your fancy for a big race, but it was a sight fur the Sandy blight to see my blooming enifrse the next day. The wliole blooming population was there, and all San 'Frisky was what Alt' Josephs calls ong feety. 1 felt quite proud as 1 walked around to think that I nwned the blooming show, and 1hat. before 1he day was over the Kriskies were going to furnish all the gilt for the expenses, aud a little hit over for Artful Joe." " 1 strolled almig the course, and blest if I didn't think that 1 was back in Melbourne when I saw the spielers at work. There was one mug trying on the matchbox-trick, and just for the sake of old times 1 thought that I'd st rike him fur a quid. Every little helps yon know when you are running a big concern. 1 codded him till 1. got a wager on. We put up the coin—five dollars—aud 1 took the box with an innocent smile, copied from Mossy, on my face. 1 knew the trick well enough, but hang nil! if I could get the blooming thing open. After a. quarter of an-hour, I gave it up, and let the spieler have the greed, telling him that 1 had often done if before in Australia. " ' Yes,' says he. with a grin, ' the old matchbox is played out'cept in infant schools. This is a new patent. You go and shave your head, boss, so's to give Venn- brains a chance of growing,' "Well, it was only a quid after all, still I'd sooner have raked it in." " The racing commenced. I only did a lit tle on the first races, 'cos my big ,-owp was to be the Great Handicap, which everybody said Schlenter must, win They were just Schlontor- iiiad. but then they knew the horse. 1 felt easy in mv mind —hut then I knew the jockey. Ha,'ha ! How 1 did chuckle as J kept on booking the wagers. I was only sorry A If wasn't with me. ju-t 1o walkaround to cackle to t he swells and tell them I was a Australian millionaire who only made a book so's to get rid of my money to the deserving poor who wanted to back their fancy. "There was ten starters for tlu; Cup, and when you looked at the horses yon could see that there wasn't a moke had a. ghost of a show with Schleulei-if lie was on the job. Thev got away to a good start , and as they passed the first time round I could see that Schlenter was a-pulling double, but I knew what a biceps that boy naii, ami ] felt pretty safe. Things went all right, ami when it came to the hist furlongand Schlenter was well back in the ruck 1 could hardly keep my blooming hair on, when, whoop! 1hat jockey gave Schlenter two warm cuts with his whip, shook him up, and he passed the others like a Hash of greased lightning, winning easily by a blooming length and a-half. It. was the cussedist swindle as ever ] was iu in my blooming life. I felt sick. The crowd el red and roared and howled with delight, and made such a pandemolium of ihe place that it was simply disgusting, and didn't give me time to think o; any way of fixing up settling day. As for that son' of Satau. thai jockey that would sell his own mother when he sold me. I thought that I would have a little bit of a explanation with him. I corners him, and I says, severe like, fixing a Bill Branch look on him with my eagle eye—1 says — " ' William. Schlenter managed to get his head loose, after my laying a thousand dollars on the strength o) your biceps.' " ' That's SO. boss.' says that scoundrel, Willuui, ' but the stable laid me bigger odds on my weakness and my whip. They laid me two thousand dollars to nothing that Schienter conhtn'l win. Business is biz., boss; perhaps some oiler time we may uo a more mutually satisfactory deal. There's your two cents.' " On looking over my book, 1 find I shall lose about fifteen imndred quid over that meeting. 1 really must get Alt', over here, then if we can't get at the friskies proper, it'll lie some coiiso. 1 ; lien to know that the living skellington i.s standing in the loses.
