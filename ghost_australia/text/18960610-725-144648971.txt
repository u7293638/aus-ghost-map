Oliver took up the letter again. 1 1 can't have no regrets that Mister de Besbaud is dead. He was a dreadful profit* . less man to everybody, and made 3Bzmy on happy , enough. I nope he had change of heart afore he died, m that asylum ; but Dootor John wrote he didn't know anytlung. It was good of. Dootor John to.go there and stay by him : there ain't, to my mind, many men angels walking about on earth, but ihe doctor's one of 'em. Before, I forget it, bring him with you when you come down next summer, as I hope you will oome, Mr. Oliver, for I set a store by you on account of your kindness to tbe poor child.' | You see she pats you on the back .now*' ' chiiped Mrs. Minny. -'Before I close my letter I, must tell, you about my visit to Paris,' France; and, though it seemed heartless to take ' Fninky a war, ? Minny is honest about it and she wQl tell you I done right. I was mortal 'afraid .Henry ' would steal him off, and, as he- is a oroupy ohild, he would get his death : so I just took hlmaoross ocean to Henry's folks, i ws'n't muoh siok on the voyage, nor the baby, but was bothered most in France on aooount of folks not understanding me. Howeomever, I there was some Philadelphia people along I that I got acquainted'Witn, and they set me fright, for ihey could=talk'with the French. ! Finally, wben I got to the general's house, ooming in a oab that charged' a mortal bill for waiting, on aooount of being interested in talking, ' I found the general in',— a fioe old man, too, and he oonld talk English reason* able well. I up and told him everything, keeping Ftanky on my, lap. * Now,' says I, 1 if you don't want this poor little ohild ana treat him as your own, 1 take bW to my : home, for I m well-to-do, and the little oreeiux's growed into my affeotions.' Good ness me, he knowed most of it, that man JUewis havingj kept him informed. He set right-down and talked friendly as possible^ said Minny ought to have oome to him, he would treat her as a daughter ; then his eyes filled with tears, and be took little Jranky in his arms, and told me their , Alphonse was dead, and his eldest son's wife was a helpless invalid who wept night and day . I took my things and went np - stairs with him to her room,— such a grand house ! —and there she was, a pale little creetur, that oonld only jabber in Frenoh ; bat baby smiled on her, — babies knows any language, —and she shook hands kind with me, ana the 'upshot of the matter was I stayed two weeks in their house, till Frankie got .ac quainted with the new -nurse. I forgot, to tell you r never thought of that oab dill was eating dinner three hours, afterwards ; anal jumped right up, and was running oat, bolt Henry's brother, a respeotable solemn* looking man, sent one of the help out, and a bill there must have been, but he wouldn't let me BetUe. 'Fore I left neWB of Henry's death come, and upset them all, and then Lewis and Annette was expeoted, and as I didn't want to see them iwo,— ^eroeoially liim,— I went away. Theysent a ooraial inj viteforMinnv to oome, ? but 1 told them I guessed -she'd like America best, as I do, where you oan tell what folks say when they are talking. ' 4 The1 general give me to understand they would legally adopt Franky, and I told 'em you would sign any doonments: — as I know vou would— for the boy's sake. He will naye a 'fine property eome day.

Oliver, and oome down early and stay all summer, v . * Yours to command, ; 4 Hurras Patten.' Sometimes, as the years glide by, Mrs. M£nny*s arms are empty too, and. her heart yearns for the little baby over the s^a. Ko othef ohild haB oome to her, and her . husband frowns at the mention of a journey to France: he ia jealous of even the little hold the lost ]baby has on her affections : bo there is a tiiorn in1 her bed of roseS; Siye,' too, is old and ideepy; or is it herseflf , who has no desire for play f Is she be^mlng ^own-up ahd different P Will he' lovelier jost the same, perhaps more P He must tire of her childish ness.
