INTRODUCTORY. The period that has elapsed since the date of our last summary for England has been more a season of amusements than a period of busy industry. Christmas time was of a temperature more fitted to the season in the old country than m the sunny south, and consequently out door amusements were few and poorly atteuded. The New Year, howevor, was UBhered m with weather befitting an Australian summer, and all Tasmania was out of doors, enjoying the pleasures of the season. Pohtics, however, rofused to bo shelved. Wo had just had a change of Ministers, and tho new men were, on the 3rd day of January, all re elected unopposed by their former constituencies. In this respect they had nothing to complain of, and they took advantage of the forbearance extended them to prolong that uncertainty as to their intentions which distinguished their conduct on their accep- tance of office. The Colonial Secretary, in return- ing thanks for hiB re-election treated Ins constitu- ents to a severely adverse criticism on past Governments. Himself and hiB colleagues were represented as tho only pure, patriotic and unselfish Ministers Tasmania has had through its period of responsible government. "Corruption and jobbery, and a frightful system of extrava- gance, " were declared to have been the distinguishing characteristics of all preceding Mtuistiios, in- cluding gentlemen who for high social, moral, and upright character, stand pre- eminently beyond the standard which Mr. Reiboy has attained. The Colonial Seoretary accompanied his review of the past political history of Tasmania by misrepresenta- tions and misstatements so gross and unjustifiable, as to be a disgrâce to his poBition, whether he spoke in ignorance, or with the dehberato intention to mislead. On the same day the Colonial Treasurer and the Attorney-General addressed Hobart Town con- stituencies. The latter gentleman, quite new to Parliamentary life, spoke as if Ministers were being harshly treated m being asked to meet Parliament Within a month of their eleotion to ofiice, and indi- cated a further appeal for delay. The Colonial Treasurer foreshadowed a now way of paying the public debts. He and IUB party pre- vented the late Ministry carrying through Parliament proposals of new taxation m the shape of a property tax, which met the ap- proval of the Couutry, oven property holders admitting that as taxation was only required for railway purposes, it was but fair that property which had derived the chief advantage, should bcai the bulk of the burden Tho now Colonial Trea- surer has enunciated the bright ulta of, instead of meeting interest that has been accumulating whde he and his colleagues havo been fighting for omeo, capitalising all excesses of expenditure o\ cr revenue, and adding the amount to the publie debt, leaving our children's children to bear the burden of S resent improvidence Such a proposition would e so damning to our public credit tint w o hope even the Ministen il supportcis will reject so dis- creditable a means of smoothing over a dilhculty that the Colony ought to meet at onco. They who would leud monoy tliat the Colony may pay interest upon interest, would be as lccklcss as the Ministry who would piopose hung on our capital. Wlnlo Ministers alfeet liudiug it impossible to within a mouth submit any measures to Parliament, and ignore the Colonial Secretary's statement of bomg prepared to tako the consequences «hen moving the vote of want of cenhdence that gavo him olhce, they ha\ e not hesitated at devoting a con- siderable portion of the present adjoin nmoiit to stumping the country as a body auder pretext of making themselves aequaiuted with its requirements. We can understand the advantage of familiarity with local wanta, but theio is a time foi every thing, and certainly tune that should have bee» dovotod to prep mug to moot Parliament should not have been given to other purposes. Besides it is furcie.il in some of tho Ministers Betting out on a voyage for discos ering w rongs to redress. There was a want of fitness between Ministers and tho occupation they were employed in. Mmistcrs must li.i\ o spent a good round sum in their tour, yet because tho Legislative Council did not grant supplies to a Ministry who had de- clined to submit any policy, Ministers lofuso to pay over the pauper allowances, evidently intending to make pohtieal capital out of tho distress of the poor. The news oE tho death of tho Puuccss Aheo Mas received hero with gi eat rogret, and much sympathy was expressed in public and pinato with the be- reaved mother, Her Majesty the Queen, and with the Princess's husband, tho Gi.md Duke of Hesso Darmstadt.

The defence works for adding to and render ing more offective existing batteries and fortifications, as recommended by the Imperial Commissioners, Sir William Jervois and Colonel Scratchley, also continued to occupy a great deal of attention In May the colony generally were gratified by learning that the 1300,000 foul per cent loan, which Parliament had sanctioned during its last session had been floated at the fixel minimum of £92 10s, and upwards Considering the disturbed state of the money maiket at the time, conséquent on the anticipa tiona of war, we had much reason to be pleasod that the loan was taken up, and at once, on such favourable terms. The attempt of the directors of the Main Line Railwaj Company, to which they in vain sought to ii ike tho ¡secretary of State for the colonies a party, to dannge the credit of the colony and provent the floating of any loan while the colony resisted the Com pany's unjust demands, proved as futile as the motives of the dircctois were c mtemptible Parliament was opened on the 16th Juty by His Lxcellcncy the Governor in person In his inaugural speech be spoke very hopefully of the prospects of the colony, and aftei îeferrin-, to the various matters of importance that had oceuired during the vacation, ad verted to the defence nigimsation, to the Main Line Railway dispute, and the development of our mineral ro souices He promised the introduction of several mi portant bills, providing for tho maintenance of public roads au amendment of tho Mineral Lenses Law, of the Electoral Act, of the Merchant Shipping Exami nations Act, mid the Regulation of tho Civil Service, l)88ides other subjects hkclj to lead to much discussion lhe address in leply was carried in both Houses with out division, though after lengthy debates, in winch tho Opposition indicated o conviction that their dutv consisted in hnding fault Some changes had taken placo in tho Assembly since tho proroga . tion Besides the new position taken by Mr Giblin as Premier, and the absence of Mr Fysh, who I bad not returned to the Colony as expected in time to resume his place, two other gentlemen took their seats who were not there when the House rose on December lltb, 1877. Mr James Scott, who for many years sat for George Town, succeeded Captain Tulloch, resigned, for South Launceston, and Mr A I Clark, a recently admitted barnstei, succeeded Mr Bromby (late Attorney General) also absent on a visit to England, ni tho lepresentation of Norfolk Plains On July 31st, tbo Colonial Treasurer, m submitting the Supplementary estimates for the current year, and also for tbo two preceding years, in so far as they bad not been finallj balanced off, made a sup plenientary financial speech, as required by the terms of tbo Audit Act passed in 1877, Btating that tho Estimate of Eevenuo for 1878, which ho had formerly latd beforo Parliament, pro mised not only to be fully borno out, but to be in excess ovon of what bad been anticipated On 23th September, the Treasurer submitted his estimates for the year 1870 lhe estimated ways and means from existing sources ho stated at £373,520, a very considoiablo increase on the estimates of the year 1878 In his speech bo stated that the revenue for 1877, estimated by the late Treasurer at £301,000, had yielded £349,400, that the revenue for 1878 estimated by him at £317,500, might bo expected to yield £370,000, and that notwitliBtand ing tno extra expenditure of the year, the public account would show a surplus of £14,000 Tho oxpondituro for the yeir was however also abnoimally hi"h, though, of tho total sum of £72,232, duo foi interest to the Main Line Railway Company, only £12,800 was included, the Govorment proposal being to extend the payment of the larger sum over five years tbo £12,800 being tbo first of the five payments It was not proposed to add the sum to the National Debt, but by taking Treasury Bills to liquidate it out of tbo ordinary rovonues of the five years The esti mated expenditure foi 1879, Mhieb was 420,000, in eluded foi the first time the Main Line Railway Com pany's uitcust for the year, £32,500, and £12,800 tbo proportion of the past interest which it was proposed should fall duo in lb79 , items for maintenance of raids , niteicst on last loan , defences, roads to the 1 in Mines, otc , amounting m the aggregate to nearly £100,000 in excess of the past yeal s expenditure Yet, all this sum would have boen absoibed m the natural inclement of revenue from existing sources but for tho îailway interest, the dehcit-£45,000, amounting, by a curious coincidence, to tbo sum payablo on account of tbo Mam Lino Railway, after deducting past payments '1 his difficulty in the shape of a deficit, winch now again, and not for the fust time, had faced

ThoBO »oats were thoso of Air. l'ysh, tire lato Premier and member for Kant Hobart, who was Btlll in England, and Mr. Gayer, the member for Queenborough, who had bein for some uontbs In Melbourne, Though ministers might have pushed on their business and remedied the result of the chance Opposition victory by renewing the motion for going into Committee on the bill which contained their taxation scheme, they preferred the other alternative and asked for an ad- journment till the 2nd December that the friends of the absent members might be consulted with the view of obtaining their resignations. Even this, though they had clamoured for it, the Opposition resisted, but the adjournment was agreed to and the resignations of both Beats were at once obtained. Writs were forthwith issued, and the elections were held on November 26th. For East Hobart, Mr. J. S. Dodds, barrister, whose efforts to obtain a seat in the House of Assembly hod been twice before defeated, and Mr. Bussell Young, the city solicitor, a former representative for Franklin (Huon), were nominated. For Queenborough the Hon. T. D. Chapman, member for Buckingham in the Legislative Counoil, and Dr. E. L. Crowther, who has twice before unsuccessfully contested the same seat, were the candidates. Though an attempt was made to identify the Government scheme of taxation with these elections, it ia not questioned that both were contested on purely personal grounds, entirely irres- pective of that scheme. Both Dr. Crowther and Mr. Dodds were returned by large majorities, and both joined the ranks of the Opposition when the House resumed its sittings on the appeinted day. The fate of the Giblin Ministry was sealed, as this gave the Opposition a majority of one ; and, after some further delay, through indecision on the part of the Opposition, a call of the House was mode tor December 17th, to consider a motion of want of confidence in the Government proposals, notice of which waa given by Mr. Reibey, the Opposition leader. On that day the Government proposals were rejected by 16 votes to 14, one of their supportera bein» absent, not prepared for a further ruse of the Oppoaition, who slunk in silence to the division, declining debate. The fate of the Ministry met with little sympathy, from the lock of energy they had ahown in pushing through their taxation proposals-a dilatorinesB which has, in foot, led many to question how fur they were really sincere in their desire to carry a land_ tax. Though the public voice was with them, Ministers dallied with their proposals, and all but invited that oppoaition in the House which their opponents found could not be aroused in the country generally. On the day following the want of confidence motion, Ministers tendered their resignations, and after some manoeuvring, the mover of the vote gave up the at- tempt to form a Ministry ; but, accepting office under bim whom he recommended to be sent for, we have the following as our new Ministry : Premier (without a portfolio) Mr. W. L. CROWTHEB Colonial Secretary. Mr. REIBET Colonial Treasurer. Mr. DAVID LEWIS Attorney-General. Mr. J. S. DODDS Minister of Landa. Mr. C. O'REILLY The new men were sworn in on December 20, on which day both Houses adjourned till the 28th Janu- ary. The Assembly pasaed supplies amounting to £50,000, and purposed adjourning till April, as the new Ministry wished; but the Council, not quite 80 facile, postponed the consideration of the supply reso- lution till the 20th January, not being disposed _ to favour this Ministry moro than any Administration had ever been favoured. The constitution of the now Ministry is perplexing. Mesara. Crowther, Reibey, and O'Reilly formed a part of the Reibey Ministry that preceded that of Mr, Giblin just resigned. Mr. O'Reilly, in so far as be has decided opinions, has always supported an income-tax. Mesara. Reiboy and Crowther have boxed tho compass of political opinion. Consequently at tbismoraent the Colony is in a state of complete ignorance and has not even an idea as to what the new proposals for raising revenue to meet the railway liability may be. Ministers have declared by their votes their disapproval of the land tax. But they promised no substitute. In fact they purposely abstained^ on the want of confidence motion from debating the question ao that they might not bo trammelled by pledges. Mr. Lewis, the Treasurer, a gentleman new to office, baa been remarkable, if for anything, for the elasticity or unsettled character of his opinions, while the Attornoy- General is new to Patliamentary oa well as official life, his only public act having been his vote on the want of confidence motion. As a very young rann his views will be those of his colleagues. Perplexing as the financial position is, the aspect of affairs in another direction, seriously affecting the honour and interest of tho Colony, ii still less re assuring. Two of tho new Ministers have been the undisguised advocates of the Main Lino Railway Com- pany against the Colony, the Premier having been even suspected of being ita recognised Parliamentary agent ; a third gentleman has shown strong proclivities in the same direction, and, singularly enough, the very day the late Ministora left office, that same day notice of an action by the company waa served against tho Colony for a sum of £28,000 odd, being interest for tho time the Evandale junction was the Northern point of train sorvice, and for consequential damage. The claim is laughed at outside the railway circle, and it is felt tho company will not dare to go into to Court, but that tho present proceedings aro in the hope of ex- tracting some concession from pliant friends. For- tunately, Parliament will have a voice in any arrange- ment embracing a payment of money. Writs were iasued on December 23rd, for the re- election ef the now Ministers, oa required by law. The period of nomi- nation in each case being from the 27th December, until the 2nd January, and tho day of polling in tho event of a contest, the 7th January. No opposition ia however bein;; offered to tho return of cither of the candidates. On December 24 the seat for tho Georgo Town electorate was also declared vacant, through the , resignation of Captain Gilmore, who baa accepted an office of emolument under the Crowtt-the Warden ship of the Launceston Marine Board. _ The Main Line Railway and its company has con- tinued «lurint; this year to occupy moro than its fair share of public attention. Tho details of tho question aro intimately mixed with tho doings of the political world, but wo speak of them by thomselvea to preservo con- tinuity. When we entered upon the year, an arrange- ment bad been entered into, the Government, recog- nising the useful work done by the railway, having made cortain payments to it on loan, but without ? prejudice to the matters in dispute. To satisfy ¡ Ministers how far the legal ndvico they bud , acted on was sound, a case had also been i privately submitted by the Government for the ioint opinion of tho Attorney-General for England, , ilr. Benjamin, Q. C, nnd Mr. Cyril Dodd. To this j the company were not parties. Matters remained in this position, the Railway Servico being performed | with regularity and freedom from accident, until I the end of January, whon we were startled by a tempest raised onco moro by tho indiscretion of the Local Manager, Mr. Grant, who without any previous intimation of his intention to the other partica coneorned, gave to the public, through the press, an unfinished correspondence in which he hud been engnged with the Government. In the first place Mr. Grant lind written to Ministers intimating that the newly-appointed directory of the company proposed sending out a deputation to the Colony commissioned to settle all disputes between tho colony and the company, and as a formal mutter of courtesy asked if it would bo ngrcoublo for Ministers to receive tho deputation. Ministers replied that they were not only willing, but most anxious to reçoive any proposals for an adjustment of disputes, but, inju- diciously travelling beyond the immediato issue, and ¡ referring to tho very obnoxious and neodlessly offensive i manner in which he had conducted previous correspon- dence with themselves and thoir predecessors, suggeatod j that any futuro négociations would bo moro likely I to offect nn amicable adjustment of tho disputo if they could bo conducted by the contending parties without his intervention. This brought the intercourse to ft prematuro conclusion. Mr. Grant, in addition to regarding the hint us a personal II liront, unwarrantably jumped to a further conclusion, that in slighting him individually, Ministers meant also to declino meeting the deputation, and the result was a "tompest in a teapot" amongst the nownpaper Press of the Colony, This was apparently Mr. Grant'a object in making the unfinished correspondence pre I maturely public. Ho wished to make it the ground of i accusation against Minister«, and so the correspondence dropped until the middle of Fobrunry whon Mr, Grant again communicated with tho Government, forwarding copies of certain resolutions passed by the Loudon Directorate reiterating the incorrect statement that the line waa open for traffic on March, 15, 18711, und charging tho Government with default. Mr. Grant agnin. in course of his letters, threw out hints about tim desirability of tho attendance of tho depu- tation, adding, however, now a request that ho might bo able, when ho informed his directors of tho willing- ness of the Government to reçoive the deputation, to add that all disputes that could not bo arranged bv negotiation might he settled by nrbitrati m in a fair and friendly spirit The Colonial Secretary on behalf of the Government, replied to Mi Giant that the Government were as roady aa over to iccei-e the députa tion,tbougb they had no pow ci to do BO on the now basis ho had suggested As a furthei stop the Govern nient tired of Mr Grants tortuous ways, forwarded» lottor through the Crown Agenta in London, to the Directors, intimating thoir wish that the matter should be sottlod, and expressing their willingness to receivo a deputation with this object Mr Grant s next cona hatory (') step waa tho circulation in tho colony of a report of the directors of the company prepaied to be submitted to a meeting of shareholdeia to bo held on the 18th rdiiuaij, and which liteially bristlod with mis statements of fact» and untruths This was backfd un by an equally coiioiliatoiy (') stop on the pat tot tho DnootoiB in London who, by Mindai mi< «tatemonts and untruths ni a letter they nldiotwod to tho Soerotaiy of btato for the Colonies, at tho tuno whuu oin £300,000 loan was boin.- placod in tho niaikot, Hinicht to damn the ciodit of tho oloiiy, and to pro\ont tho lloatuig of tho proposed loin Both those coursos proved futilo Mi Giants movement in tho colony left tho readeia of the repoit at a losa whethor to bo most nmu/edat the unsciiipulousiicsa of tho statements made, oi his audacity in cuculí-tin,; such ilobberato mid groBs porvcrmons of facts bei o among tboso who Were as familiar as himself with tho actud uicumstaiicea of the eaao Hie result of tbo Director stop was a ctut intimation fiom the beeietaiy of State that ho had no juridiction m t\\\u matter at all, and tbo cieatlou of a wide spioad feei-,,1^ of ¡mh0ii-tion at such acowaidlj attempt at cououm Many who wore previously inclined to sympathise with tho company, denounced as nofar 10UB this attempt of the Directora which could only have lioon intended either to so nipple the Colony ns t° make Government agree to any terms with the company, or to veut their spite on tho Colony beeauso Go-eminent insisted on tho company fulfilling its con tract obligations 1 oiled in then attempt to draw tho Societal} of Stitc into a local dispute, the director« with more succctw sought the uni of the Coiumitteo of the Stuck fcixohatiL,o, one at bust of whose members was intimately associated with tho Company, und by a species of conspiracy it was hoped to defeat the Hooting of our loan as if the Government were in de fault to ita recognised creditor« In May, further correspondence showed that the Deputation was still purely hypothetical, and all Mr, Grant's argu ments in connection with it simply BO much bounce The opinion of s Mr Lloyd upon a case submitted by the Company was also bl ought to light, but proved to be a Bonea of legal platitudes, begging the whole queation and based upon a mistaken assumption that the objectronB to tho line were based upon mattera non easential and of minor importance only The Company however having now raised on additional £100,000 for the express purpose of putting the Railway and plant in good working order, seemed to be acting as it the possession of funds gave them immunity from the fulfilment of their obligations and justified them in being more unreasonable than over in dealing with the Government Their defiance waa, however, miaploced, and, as probably founded upon a hope that the colony would, by the ard of the Stock Exchange, be placed hors de combat by the failure to float its loan, proved to be decidedly premature, when, within a few days of a very aggressive apeech by the chairman of the company at a meeting of ahaioholders, combated in a letter to The Times by Mr 1 ysh, the whole of the loan waa taken up at a pnce at and above the fixed minimum, though the company weie not without their consolition The comnittteo of the Stock Exchange persisted in refusing to quote the loan, the only effect being to weaken confidence m the integrity of the Stock Exchange Hore again the company feigned conciliation, and a further correspondence between the Government and the company resulted m the long looked for and long talked of deputatron leaving L indon by the Sin Francisco Mail. Mr Grant in another lengthy letter, enclosing one to himself from the Secretary of the Company Bought to re open the question with the Government himself but m anticipation of the visit of the deputation, the Colon! ii Secretary on then behalf declined furthei correspondence. Mr Grant also applied for a copy of the opinion of the English lawyers to whom the Government hnd submrtted a ciae, and which was at this time understood to have been received, but waa informed that it could not be placed at the disposal of the company without the authority of Pal hument Mr Grant was thereupon asked by tho Goveinment to allow Mr Higinbotham, late Ln"ineer in Chief of the Victorian Railways who hid been npjiointed by thom to act m the matter of the nibitiution of tolls and com pensation, to report upon the then state of the line tin conjunction with the .Ln0ineer m Chief of this colony BO that, being in possession of the necessaiy detailed lnformatron upon the point, they nii0ht be able when the deputation arrived to deal piomutly with all ques tiouB at issue This Mr Grant refused, qualifying hu refusal with certain propositions which ho knew the Government would not accept When Paibanient met steps were at once taken by prominent members of the Oppoaition, who have ilwaya favoured the pretensions of the company, to obtain a public ition of the English lawyers' opinion Ihe evident effect of such a atop would have been to give the expected deputatron the advantage of anticipating the action of the Govern ment, and this waa so obvious, that the good sense of both Houses refused to sanction the ptopositinn On the 12th August the deputation, consisting of one of the dnectora, Colonel Grey, and tho Secietnry of the Company, Mr 1) wison, arrived in the colonv But these gentlemen, from whom so much had been expected by way of settlement, of disputed points, made no advancea of any kind, but in their intercourse with the Government, foi tided no doubt by the opinions of the English Counsel, of which they were privately informed before being luid before Pnrha ment, simply confined themselves to recen mer and rejecting piopoails In the opinion of Counsel, the faulty condition of the lino and the colony a n0ht to object wore recognised, bnt Counsel held that in employm" the Company to eunvey the mails, and in, from tune to time, advancing the Company money to cn ible it to meet its engagements to servants and others Government bud recognised the opening of the line md the train aci vice, thouji these loarra were granted, nnd payment receipted, on the express stipulation that the conti act njits of ertlier party wore not thereby to bo impaired Such, though the oprmon has nevei c nmnended itself to the profession hero, was the law as statt d y the highest legal authorities obtainable, brm0ing tlio colony int > a poaition not very creditable to our own law advisers Accepting the position, though a0amst all loe ii legal advice, the Government obtained the sanction of Paibanient to the payment of the "iiaiantecd interest upon the sum of £bjO 000 from the 1st d ty of November, 1870 (the dito tho train service »as ex tended to and from Launceston) to June ¿0,1878, the svim being £ol,100 (less Jt2J,000 already advanced to the company, and with accrued interest, otc , added) The oller was also nude to the company, as reprc sentcd by the deputation, to forego on the part of the colony all rights to ci osa actions ngamt the company undor the contract, if tho company also forewent the claim to the six months interest, during which the trama vv ero only ruu to und from El ándale 1 he pay meut was made, and strenuous attempts viere tiled on behalf of tho company to get half the sum in dmpute, but these vv ero defeated, and the comp my was told to seek its remedy in tho Súmeme Court, where the colony would also have to seek redress for the insufficient and dau0erous construction of the line, and its inadequate lolling atoek The deputation then left tho colon}, Colonel Gi ey leavm0

Cricketers of the colony were in difficulties in the past season through a dispute between the Laun- ceston Club and the Southern Tasmanian Cricket Association, with reference to the South Aus- tralian trip. In consequence, the return match'North ¡v. South was not played ; a Melbourne team which came over at Easter playea against a Launceston team who were utterly unable to hold their own, and were severely beaten. The dispute has been remedied this year, and in North v. South, played on De- cember 20, at Launceston, South gained an easy victory. The game ia still general throughout the colony, and the present season will receive an im Êitus from the glory gained at Home by the Australian teven, in which Tasmania was so ably represented by Mr. George Bailey. We are also eagerly looking for- ward to the visit this month to Hobart Town of Lord Harris's English team. The football season was fairly active and successful, but the game needa that its sup- porters all over the island should unite to place it on a proper footing. The heralded visit of an English Team to the colonies may have this effect. The Tennis Club ia now a permanency. Mr. Travers won the club trophy, a silver salver. The very suc- cessful dramatic season of the Scott-Siddona' Company, which lasted for over throe months with unabated popularity, came to an end in March. During the time the company occupied the theatre crowded houses were the rule, and Hobart Town play- goers had the privilege of witnessing this great and gifted actress in all her principal characters. During the winter the Wheatleigh Company played for a short season. The theatre waa opened for the summer season a fortnight ago, by the Holloway Dramatic Company, with whom is Mr. Creswick, who, supported by Miss Helen Ashton, will appear in a round of characters. The musical world weie offered a treat in May, by the arrival of an Italian Opera Company from Melbourne. During their atay at the theatre they produced a large number of well-known operas, besides introducing Tasmanians for the first time to Aida and Lohengrin, The season will always be memorable to Tasmanians as having witnessed the debut in opera of Miss Amy Sherwin, whose first effort was "Norina," in Don Patqmtlc. Mías Sherwiu's success waa so great that she has since travelled through the other colonies with ever-increasing triumph, earning the name of " The Tasmanian Nightingale." An English Opera Com- pany followed with a short season ; after which came The Infant Mozart," a musical prodigy, and Madame Tosca, one of the most brilliant of modern pianistes. Another effort has been made by a portion of the musical amateurs to sustain a society, and the Orches- tral Union has been re-formed, but on too narrow a basis to ensure its life. Their first performance of Athalic was a great success, but their second appear unco, when tbey undertook the Messiah on Christmas night, was simply a fiasco. The other amateur efforts of the year have been Costa's Eli, performed at Laun- ceston in June ; the cantata St. Cecilia's Day, at the Tasmanian Hall in August ; an operetta ¿Ulah, at the Huon; Birch's operetta Merrie Men of Sherwood Forest ; and Apaa's cantata The Gipsies, at the Town Hall, Hobart. Amongst the host of other companies who have visited us during the year may be mentioned the Stewart Family in " Rainbow Revels," Victoria Gaiety Troupe, Captain Hayward's Variety Troupe, Bachelder'a Pan I oscope (destroyed by fire at Deniliquin a week ago), Hayes and Benhamo's Great International Circus, D'ArcyReid's "Ghost," and a host of smaller fry. Amateur performances and concerts have also been very numerous. The Derwent Yacht Club held their annual meeting in July. The Commodore's Cup was won with ease by the Haidee, and matches have been sailed almost every week with varying success. At the annual meeting of the Derwent Rowing Club, held on February 27, Mr. G. R. Lloyd was presented with the champion's badge. Their regatta took pluce on April 6. The annual regatta was held as usual at the Huon last New Year's Day. The annual Laun- ceston regatta was held in February, when in the prin- cipal event, the Ladies' Purse, the local club held their own easily against a Hobart Town crew who went up to compete with them. Other regattas have been held at Stanley, Fort Esperance, New Norfolk and Perth. The great annual event In connection with our State system of Eduoation took place as usual during the winter and the A.A. Degree was gained by 17 candi dates out of 10 who presented themselves, 8 having passed in the first class. The gold medal was gained by W. P. Goddard, an exhibitioner of the Board, and in addition to tho medal he was awarded the "Dry" Scholarship having decided to study for the Tasmanian Scholarship. The Tasmanian Scholarships of £200, each tenable for four years at any British Uni- versity, were won by J. G. Lindsay and G. Q. Roberts, who have since left for England. The whole were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Council of Education, by the President (Hon. Dr. Agnew, M.L.C.)
