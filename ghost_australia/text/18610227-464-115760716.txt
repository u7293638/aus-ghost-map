Of PATRICK 'BON AVENTUUE, : by .Divine Grace and Favour of ?he Apostolic, ;See, Bishop of ADELAip^'rTO .the , Clergy: and LAIT-X OF THE DlOjOESEi.' ,'' ..,?,;' ,.;;xi. ' ' ' God now declareth unto men that all should everywhere do penance:'— Acts 17. 30. Dearly Beloved, : ;V;j;^ ': . There is come another Lent, to 'Summon, with the voice of the Apostles,, the ..'whole-- Catholic World to the annual work of forty days of penance, in lowly imitation, as it were, of our Saviour's fasting in the desert. ''For Christ also suffered for us, leaving an example that We should follow his steps.'— i. Pet., 2, 21. And we, dearly beloved, to' whose heart is confided, your pastoral care, even as Ve hope for our own salvation, now hum!}ly;:and' earnestly re-echo the Apostolic summons, and exhort you : to. hearken . with us to it1, 'so that we all— Bishops, Priests.' men, women, anu i.au ,01 ;us; w.uo; are .capaoie throughout the Diocese — may be of one mind and of one- heart in devoting ourselves with ex-' emplary piety to. the sentiments and acts- becom ing such a penitential season. , , , , But how is' it't'hat th'e'hecessity1 of thiiypenance is imposed liponus?. Alas ! jiti. account ;of purr sins. The sins of the world1 brought; ou.r-Blessed.'; Lord to his suffermgs---and'' death. The- eternal : justice of God would. not spare;,;' his -bwn son,' bearing, though ,on .such; .innocent- arid 'holy shoulders, the weight of our sins. ^ Wherever'1 there is sin , ? 0 r : the: danger - of sin ;? there needs must be^penancevand' therefore.frorn the ?practice of penance not-one of us is; exempted/5 Eyen .'the., happy ?Christian's L;wlja- 'enjoy ''itis V'wpij'derfuj',' blessin^-of -preserving 'their^ are still dependent on' the. virtue'rif.pehance. ? .:;Xt. is nut because any kind o.f sin,. Tbr, any i.punisb- : , ment due to the guilt of. sin,, was leffc.,.uniorgiveh in their baptism, but because they. remain liable to the inclinations, ofj human nature, unhappily in all during this life, so prone towariisf/evil ; 'find ; hence is ^he grace of'doing penance given to.them as a, necessary and efficacious means' of watching,, combating, and suppressing their concupiscences' ? — that they may by ; this spiritual ;comb;at' pre- serve their innocence and' :'Ja.t!g'men't'1th;.e'ir.''.'.viiitue.s.' and merits. The Holy Council of. 'Trent,' in ac-! cordance with the doctrine. of, the Scriptures, teaches us that such hVppy souls, ''haying been made the friends, of God,. advancing from virtue' . to virtue, they are renewed day after day, that is, by mortifying the members of their own. flesh, and by presenting them as instruments of justice, and sanctification, they, through the observance of the commandments 'of God and of the Church, faith co-operating through- the grace of. Christ, and are still further justified, as it is written — He that is justified let him be justified more.' — (Apoc. 22, a I.) Sess. 6,. ch. 10.' There is another reason which lays them under the obligation of doing, penance. For, without ceasing to be just, the most holy Christians, during life, fail, and often too, into slight faults which must always be a most imperious neces sity, with such close /riends of God, to mourn over the -slightest forgetfulness or lukewarmness in the Divine Service and love ; and hence, im pelled by the words of the Apostle—' Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth.' —?Col. 3, 5 —they must labour to make peniten tial amends for the past, and so fortify themselves to the utmost against lapses for 'the future. These truths pronounce a fearful warning against the delusion so prevalent amongst the spiritual errors of these times, which puff up so many calling themselves Christians, with the self complacency and prideful presumption, that they know with certainty that their sins are forgiven them— that they are already sanctified— and that they have no further need to trouble themselves lest they should fall away and relapse into sin. This delusion is most pestiferous to the soul, and repugnant to true faith in Christ 'Let him vrho thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.'— 1\. Cor. 10, 12. Is the daily prayer prescribed by our Lord to all who believe in him— Foraive us our trespasses— a vain supplication?— or is it not as true and necessary as it is humble and holy? ^ Thus we plainly understand why the most just of the servants of God must still be bound to penance ; and so ?? Work out their salvation in fear and trembling.'— Phil. 2, 12. But bow far removed are most of all of us from the happv condition of those just beings, who have never denied the- pure shining robe, with which their souls were invested in sacred baptism ? And if they, during their mortal lives, must not cease to be children of penance, in order to continue ngnteous, and increase their acceptableness before the just and merciful judge, who will j render unto all according to their works ; can there be for us a more alarming consideration than that of examining profoundly what is really i our own condition in relation to penance? Can we ? review our baptismal innocence otherwise than as each of us is forced to look back upon our fleeted guileless childhood— never, never more to be a child? Poor sinners then that we are, after having wilfully stripped off and cast away the spotless robe of our regeneration, what kind of penance is there left for us ? Alas ! our penance cannot be the penance, of grace urjost. We must do, the laborious penance of sin and shame. But blessed for ever, be the Father. of Heaven ! even this is made foe us unhappy fallen ones, the means of supernatural reparation, and the mercy which triumphed on the Cross stretches it out to us as a second plank to bear us over the gulp of our countless and enormous iniquities. ' For on behalf; of those who fall .into sin after baptism, Christ Jesus instituted the Sacrament of Penance, when He. said-^rReceiVe ,y.e. the Holy Ghost, whose sins ye;sballf forgive, ..they are forgiven them, and whose' sins: ye shall 'retain they are .retained..- — John 20-;22^ 231— Whence it is to.. be' taught that theipenitenceof ' a Christian a'ftef'hfs' fall is very -different 'fromf that 'at baptism^, arid that therein'1 ;are {included; n.ot orily' a.

Cor. 7, 10. -And agai.n^ Do , pen- ance and bring forth fruits worthy of penance—' Mat. 2, 2,' Such has. ever been the solemn teaohing of the Church of Christ. Coun. Trent, 6 Sess., H- c. 'Such the sacred source from which alone we can hope to obtain reconciliation with an offended Go il for. the guilt of mortal sin incurred after the forgiveness of baptism. Such is the penance, confession, contrition, and satis faction which must be eminently the occupation of a, well spent Lent. ; ' ;' It is not intended to detail in the briefness of this Pastoral the particulars belonging to the Sacrament of Penance. We place our reliance on you our beloved coadjutors in the ministration of this salutary Sacrament to instruct thoroughly the people under your care, in its nature, necessity, practices, and effects. This, doubtless, is regarded by you at all times as an indispen sible duty, in your zeal to make known the faith of the Church and its power over the forgiveness of sins — to bring sinners themselves to penitence, and to preserve and help those who are endea vouring to lead a virtuous life. But we would also espress our great wish that you would in the mostspecial manner employ your public exhorta tions and other priestly instructions to engage the faithful as earnestly as possible during the time of Lent, in' those acts with which the Divine Grace may best dispose them for the Sacrament of Penance ; such as acts of fear arising from the justice and judgment of God ; acts of humble but ever relying confidence in His Divine Mercy; sincere contrition for sin, with firm purpose of amendment ; a careful examination of conscience made in order to an humble and true disclosure of sins committed to a minister of confession, together with the acts of satisfaction, fasting, prayer, restitution for injuries or scandals, and such other penitential works as evince the dis position of the penitent to make atonement in some proportion to the offence offered to God. By these means we will take security for the validity of the absolution which we are implored to impart nt the tribunal of the Holy Ghost, and for the worthiness of those whom we admit to the Paschal Communion of the Body of Our Lord, of which most Adorable Sacrament we are the guardians as well as the administrators. Beloved Children then, turn now at least to your respective pastors for these instructions for guidance in these acts of penance, and for your child's share in the Divine treasure of the Altar ; and do not we conjure you suffer that this most sacred and acceptable time of Lent, as the Church designates it, be offered to you in vain ! Oh ! let us all do penance for our sins. ? Out Gf the thousand spiritual reflections which dispose and urge the soul to penance, there is not perhaps one more appropriate to us sinners than the consideration of mortal sin itself; itis most terrible, most urgent, but most consoling.- We all know that mortal sin is a grievous trans gression against our gond God, whose perfections, especially His Almighty power and wisdom, are exercised to increase and extend the increase of His goodness towards us. It is impossible to exaggerate the goodness of God, for, it is infinite, nor is it more possible for us to estimate the enormity of injustice, or the foulness of the in gratitude by which we sin and become traitors to such a magnrScent and tender Benefactor. This, however, is certain, that to know and reflect on the goodness of God, and at the, same time to sin' Wilfully and mortally against Him, is to add to the sin itself an intensity, of injustice and ingra-; titude, on account of ,ihe malice .of- our. .deliberation. ?For instance— the. occasion, to tempt us to' mortal ;s'in is come, the temptation assails our weak in :clinatiqns; and tries to gain; them 'over ;; but grace ? ?jViv '.conscience within-- us raise ' the alarm,' and ^s.ternly; warn -us to fly at once- the danger;:' Ve' 'jf'esitate, and the e'nerny'takirig' advantage, of , bur ' ,lijesitatiori,' piitsfofth ;all 'the Enticements of'' .the ;fsin, , its ??sehs'ual'f'gra'tifiuatiqn,'' '.of priftev qr^yain-r, 'rglorvi 'or revenge^ or ?' covetousnesSi ? or,. ?Human.;, Respect, of. some, other; forbidden, but '.flattering itjiing-r-f-but .faidi ; all the while..ceases:;n,otito,; cry-; ?''into our , very, souls ; the,- menaces of. everlasting: '-puh-ishment. denounced; i against ! the deliberate ?iinher ; still we,; stand and iwa'ver between God 'find the crime,' we argue ; and' deliberate1 which ??'side we shall' take;'- whether ' we ; shall' fly ; to''. the' 'firms ofj'our ''God,' of deliver ourselVes1 «yar t'o'sin ' .and the Devil. 'But,: in ; this' conflict,., doe's' cuf ?.memory of the goodness'' of \ God fiifsake us? By' jjiO: means— on : the' rccntrary, it is exa fitly, because, £.we:-;do' remember .this, his divine goodness, that Swtfrf'make an i ..., excuse, ,-for...-;de,se.rtingH.imr-it , is '^because ' He is ever good and. patient,,, and. has. 'spared us in many other mortal sins : before, that \y'e : flattW ourselves ? He . will : not -destroy ?? us- for 'this 'one' now. Irt spite of the'- warning : of the Holy \ Ghost, we- say—' I have sinned and what1 harm hath' befallen ti?e'— Eccl; 5;' 4-/' And thus every, thought, every ? moment ;'!6f tiiis monstrous deliberation, blinds us more and more, and hurries . ,:us on .to' the work' of treas-Vn,;, until turning our rback upon God, in 'th'e.- delirious hope that it is only for -a time. we. at length, for the .seductions of a( sinful gratification, surrender up .grace and the divine favor, arid' succumb to, the power of the Devil. ' Oh ! my vGodj' exclaimed . St. Teresa, ?'How ; intolerable .is our jngratitude ;to pay homage to the Devil with the very, gifts of thy bounty J-j-^to requite tliy tender love by bestowing pur affections on him that hates thee, and shall hate thee for eternity ! and this after all the blood thou, bast, shed, all the stripes thou hast borne, and all the other torments thou hast endured for the love of us !'! What- a ' hmehtable imposition to practice on our Holy Faith— our conscience, our reason, and our 'common sense! to imagine ?'that 'we have in God's goodness a motive for in dulgjng with, impunity in those things which his 'Divine law forbids, under the penalty of eternal ruin ! We can indeed sin whenever we please ; but we cannot at the same time ward tiff God's wrath, or make sure of returning to his Divine favour at our pleasure. Let us banish so wicked a notion — such a per version of all that is right and true, whenever it assails us, by reflecting on the truth, that God is good because He hates evil — that mortal sin is the greatest, nay the only evil — that therefore God must hate in his goodness, and pursue and punish it in bis justice. For this reason Hell itself is not an evil, but the instrument by which God manifests bis infinite hatred of the turpitude of sin, and punishes it everlastingly as it deserves. But when we consider Hell in relation to ourselves, as the inexorable administrator of Divine justice taking vengeance on the impenitent sinner, the n indeed, we must regard Hell as the accumulation of all possible evils, for it contains the whole malice of mortal sin — the excruciating and eternal torments due to the guilt of sin — and the last of all evils, the loss of God for ever. This one thought alone, if we have any faith, ought to ter rify us into repentence without delay. ' Go down into Hell in spirit whilst you live, if you wish not to descend thither after your death. Reflect on the infinite number of souls who are there burning, and will for ever burn on account of sins less than yours ; many of them are burning for no more than oue mortal sin. L-iarn from this severity of God's justice, to live in fear of him, - and in horror of sin.1' These are the words of the great Doctor of Grace, the illustrious model of penitents, Saint Augustine. Let them instruct ' 'x:; us how to interpret and apply to ourselves the warning of the, Holy Ghost, again presuming on the goodness and patience of -God — 'Say not I have sinned and what harm hath befallen .me' nil for the Most High is a patient rewarder. Be not without fear for sin forgiven, and add not ...sin.-; ?/?? upon sin ; and say not the mercy of the Lord -is .-'?^;\\- great.'and He will have mercy on the multitude.', -' ??/? of my sins; for mercy and wrath ; quickly', come : ;r;-; from Him, and his wrath looketh. upon sinners.; .- Delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer ,:;??; it not from day to day for his wrath shall come/- ??? on a sudden, and in the time.of. vengeance He will ,: .; , destroy thee.'— EccL 5, 3to'9.' ' :;,;!;; These appalling but holy considerations, cannot , ,-; too deeply penetrate us. : They ^re most effica-: . ,' , :;,; cious ; in tempering our reliance. on, the goodness ; -;?: of; God with' a salutary sense of what- is' due : to.- ... :j ?his Divine' justice. ?'
