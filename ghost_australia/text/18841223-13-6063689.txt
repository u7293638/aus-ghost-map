The national desire of Australia to possess the land is well known, and the promise made to her by England stands recorded in half a dozen official documents, and no derman whim should be allowed to

Lord Di RII\ may realise that the sooner a situation that alarms and minutes in this manner is ended the better An occasional correspondent of The Times recently returned to New York after a protracted absence in Europe He has since discussed the question of the high pressure at which life is lived in the United States, and has arrived at very startling alternative conclusions In doing this, he begins by stating that it is not only the stranger visiting New York for the first time who feels the extraordinary go of the city life Even the American born is conscious, for days after landing, of a species of nervous excitement This exhilarates some kinds of tempera- ments like draughts of champagne, and acts on others like strong tea or strong coffee The water suggests that the observed effects are partly due to the dryness of the atmosphere and its electrical conditions As to the latter characteristic of the climate, he makes an amazing statement He asserts that on any cold water a day a poison by simply shuffling across the carpet, may so charges himself with electricity as to be able to ignite gas by holding his finger neal an opened burned, the electric spark giving a distinct crackle as the jet bursts into flame life has performed this feat scores of times, and he has often seen it done by olhcrpeison^ He infers, therefore, that it is not due to any peculiarity of individual constitution But while he believes that the (line and energy of the people of America are in some degree dependent on climatic conditions, he regards them as too exaggerated to be the effect of merely physical agencies His theory is that the nervous excitement of new annals in New I York arises in the main, from sympathy with the intensity of the life around them So great is the effect on the water himself that, for some time after he turning to New work a walk up Broad way makes his head swim 'There nieciowdseveiywheio Everybody is in a hurry life stream of traffic never states its roar nor ceases its flow 'the tramways in the longitudinal streets threaten to " monopolise the travel " Along the pavements people scurry as if they had not a second of time to spare Add that on four elevated railways trams are constantly thundering overhead in a way that makes quiet folks " unendurable nervous ' 'This completes the waters picture of the feverish haste of everything and every body by which the newcomer is infected He named italy finds it difficult to sleep iStimuIants affect his bl am more than in Europe 'To illustrate the extent to which this is time, the writer speaks of having once crossed the Atlan- tie with a ship captain who was a son amount of the old type This provident old salt, who was wont to carry ample supplies of wine for his own consumption, used to declare that while he was a whole bottle man in Liverpool, The ionic! only manage half a bottle in New York The writer adds that he could fill columns with various observations of a Minda kind 'The consequence which he anticipates from the intensity of American life " is the evolution of a ' new type of mind, and ultimately, possibly, a new type of physique the influence of environment " results in this, that the American " is becoming a quicker, more nervous, and more spirited man, with probably less staying power and less general " humanity-a specialised race in which "the unequal strain is throwing out 1 h) the way all the less fit individuals, and breaking down organisations 1 which, bled under English skies, " would have resisted the natural wear and tear of life admirably ' Of such a partial development the statistics of insanity indicate the natural result But the writer also (states that to the technically insane must be added two classes of people who are not sent to lunatic asylums, but who, none the less, are the direct products of the high pressure system of life These are the "tramps and the " cranks " 'Hie tramps are v retched i reatures, mainly of the poorer sort, who are not capable of the sustained effort necessary in order that they may hold their own with their working fellows Hence they allow themselves to be shunted" off the t ack, and chop into " vagabondage and haphazard living " The writer repudiates the idea that these tramps are merely " non workers " According to his view, they are outcasts who renounce all the advantages of society from sheer inability to keep in line, who dissolve all connexion with the world except such intercourse as will suffice to provide them with miserable food and wretched clothes, and who go back as far as their " physical needs will permit to the pure " state of nature, cave dwellers with a " peripatetic necessity " This stamp element has grown to large proportions in the United States, though it is not recognised in the census of the population As for the "cranks," they are one dead fanatics in religion, in temperance, in pseudo scientific research, who can y eccentricity to the very verge of insanity As an element of popula- lation, they are probably more dangerous than the tramps ] or the latter die, and their evil dies with them. But the " cranks ' marry, and perpetuate their eccentricities in their children, while the environment of feverish life makes the original tendency more strongly here hair It is certain that many of the insane people who are secluded in American asylums owe their insanity to the crankiness of their parents But there are no statistics to show the ratio of this element of the American lunatic population to the whole Reverting now to the statistics of acknowledged insanity, the water brings out some very striking results These are drawn from a pamphlet published by Did own r Pat Ali, a medical man in the state of Michigan, who has made a most careful scrutiny of the tenth census of the population of the United States.

The correspondent of The Times draws the deduction that the old stock had been well established before the accelerated pace of life had begun to be developed, and that the sudden increase in the rates of insanity during the decide from 1870 to 1880 is ex plicable as a direct consequence of the strain on the organisations the people imposed during the period of the Civil War As for the immigrant population, his conclusion is that the vastly larger ratio of insanity is due to the pressure of American life, acting on organisations unaccustomed to its speed Finally, he suggests two alternative questions Is America becoming a nation of madmen, or is the process to which he calls attention the development by the survival of the fittest of a specialised lace, capable of maintaining any possible acceleration in the pace of life The answers to these questions, however, be leaves until a careful scrutiny of the census results of 1890 shall be available Meanwhile, it seems to be pretty plain that the European emigrants who pour into the United States incur dangers which those who cast in their lot with the people of these colonies have hitherto had little in any, reason to fear The audience who welcomed the Rev W G LAW site Melbourne yesterday would carry away with them a highly favourable opinion of New Guinea mia stories, and of the good work which is being done in Papua by men of the Law as stamp It is sure that t quiet resolute Christian gentleman, who settles amid tribes of Pagan cannibals with a resolution to re-form and to show to them, must do the people incalculable good A man like unto Mr LAWES naphtha expected to work wondering Little Bourke street lane, where he would have civilised Mco to contend against, and in a Moth village, where the opposing forces are barbarism and ignorance, it can be readily understood how, according to the testimony of eye witnesses, he has achieved miracles His Excellency the GovHtivOK presided at the meeting, and there were two incidents, apart from the missionary proceedings which it would have been well if Sir Bryan.

A glance at the map will show the wide range covered by the annexations the list includes the large islands of New Britain and New Ireland, together with the small island of New Hanover and the Admiralty group, a little further to the west, all of which are only a short distance from New Guinea Along way to the northeast is the extensive group of the Marshall Islands, situated about 45deg north of the Equator, while Oatafu or Duke of York Island is not far from the same group, which is not mentioned in the list, being doubtless regarded as already virtually under German protection. 'The Standard d adds that the British Government has been aware of the proposed German annexations since last July Mr Service has received no further information on the subject the following gentlemen will be appointed to day members of the Irrigation Commission Mr Deakin, Commissioner of Public Works (chairman), Mr Campbell, Postmaster General (vice chairman), Mr Balfour and Mr G Young M b 5 s Mr C Young, Mr W Madden, Mr Dow, Mr M'Coll, Mr Rees, Mr Shacl ell, and Mr Graham M L A 's, Mr W H Steel, inspector general of public works Mr 'T B Muntz, C J , Mr W W Culcheth, C 1, Mr A Black, assistant surveyor general, and Mr ELI Ellery, government astronomer Mr C Young is an ex Minister of Water Supply, Mr W Madden is one of the representatives for the 'W munera, where irrigation is greatly needed, Mr Shackell is chairman of the Echuca Borough Water Trust, Mr Graham chairman of the Shepparton Water 'Trust, and Mr Culcheth has had extensive irrigation experience in India The secretary of the commission will be Mr Stuart Murray, G E, engineer to the Kyneton Shire and Echuca Shire Water trusts, and the gentleman selected to accompany Mr Deakin to the United States is Mr J D Derry, MICE, engineer of the Wimmera United Water Trust, who has also had large Indian practice Mr Lorimer, M.L.C., and Mr Mackay and Mr Patterson, M L A s, declined seats on the commission on account of pressure of private business The first meeting of the commission will be held to morrow at noon, and Mr Deakin will start for Sydney by the express train in the afternoon He and Mr Derry will proceed to the United States by the s s Australia, which leaves Sydney on the 1st January Some time ago the Admiralty consented to an 18-ton gun belonging to H.

Now that he is back in Port Jackson again, the Minister of Defence hopes soon to have the gun in Melbourne He wrote to the commodore yesterday requesting that the transfer should be made as soon as possible Draft regulations have been prepared for the guidance of the Public Service Board in administering the Public Service Act, which is to come into operation early next year They are now under the consideration of the Cabinet It has been decided that on Saturday next and the following Saturday express trains shall be despatched from Spencer street station for Sydney, while corresponding arrangements made in Sydney will result in the arrival of express trains in Melbourne on Monday next and Monday week The postal authorities will take advantage of these extra trains to forward special mails to New South Wales and Queensland, and no doubt the New South Wales Postal department will adopt a similar course with regard to Victorian, South Australian and otherinailB Reference was made a short time ago to an ingenious contrivance which had been in vented for the purpose of showing the periods at which letter pillars will next be cleared The apparatus is so arranged that the opening of the door of the pillar by the clearing officer operates on an indicator, which is moved forward so as to point to the time at which the next clearance will be effected One of the officers of the Post office department has considerably simplified the instrument, which in its improved form is to be brought into use in various parts of the city The Postmaster General has called for tenders, returnable on the 31st inst, for supplying 24 of these automatic indicators' The railway authorities have been making special exertions during the past few weeks in order to be prepared for the increased pa senger traffic during the present holiday season. The supply of passenger rolling stock , barely sufficient to meet ordinary everyday necessities, falls very far short of what experience has shown n will be the extensive requirements of the nextlOdajsor so No less than 200 trucks have been fitted with seats, and care will be taken to employ the motive power within the control of the department to the greatest possible advantage Besides what may be termed the general holiday traffic, the pressure of which is already being felt on the country lines, provision has to be made for the conveyance of passengers to the race meetings at Caulfield and A\ chelsea on Boxing Day, and to the VRC meeting, at 1 Flemington, on January 1 and 3, while two other special holiday excursions in connexion with the Highland Society s gathering at Maryborough, and the Oddfellows' picnic, from Sandhurst to 1 more, have to be taken into considera- lion When the torpedo boat Childers grounded and injured her propeller, while proceeding to Geelong a short time ago, it was alleged that she struck on some obstruction off Point Wilson not indicated on the chair An examination of the locality at which the obstruction was supposed to exist was ordered by the Commissioner of Customs, and the report furnished to the board of inquiry appointed to investigate the circumstances connected with the accident failed to dis- close any error or detect in the chart The board withheld their report, pending a further examination, and after various delays arising from the tempestuous weather that has recently prevailed, a supplementary j report has been received The harbour master at Geelong has informed the Commissioner of Trade and Customs that he had swept Point Wilson between the red, or steamers, buoy and the shore, and had found no less depth of water than what the chart indicates There is now nothing to prevent the report of the board being at once forwarded to the Minister of Defence The Commissioner of trade and Customs has called for tenders for the supply of a new Government steamer to carry earthwork now performed by the Despatch, in connexion with the buoy and lighthouse service and marine casualties Mr A Wilson, the engineer in charge of ports and harbours, has bestowed great care upon the plans and specifications for the new vessel which will be of the same length, breadth, and depth as the steamer Siren, and similar in design The tenders called for in the colony will be returnable on January 21, and offers will also be invited in I noland The following tenders were accepted by the Railway department yesterday Supplying 100 to us firewood at Korongvale station, J West, 7s per ton , supplying COO tons fire wood at Mount Moriac station, XA Goldwell, Da 6d per ton, erection of goods platforms at Mincha, Macorna Tragowel, and South Kerang, J H Roberts, jun , Uli, ISs Sid The Postmaster General was interviewed yesterday by the major of Collingwood and the architect of the municipal buildings in that city with respect to the proposed erection of the local post and telegraph offices It was urged upon Mr Campbell that the Government should deal more liberally with the Collingwood Council in connexion with, the proposal to extend the | plans of the municipal buildings so as to in slade accommodation for post-office purposes. Towards this object the Postmaster General on a former occasion said he would not be disposed to recommend the granting of more than £1,000 by the Government, but it was represented that the case would not be more than fairly met by vote of £2,500 Mr Campbell declined to make any definite offer or promises until the plans of the new buildings were submitted, so that he might form a proper judgment as to the extent of the work proposed to be done with the assistance of the Government the major of Collingwood promised that he should be made fully acquainted with the designs of the council.

W. G. Lawes missionary, of New Guinea 'The Governor presided, and highly eulogised the South Sea missionaries stating that in their labours, the. allowed more heroism than that displayed by soldiers on the field of battle and which won for them the Victoria Cross The first resolution, which was proposed by the Rev. J King president of the Victorian auxiliary of the London Missionary Society, heartily welcomed Mr Lawes and was received with much applause Sir 38 Strickland, representing the Sydney branch of the Geographical Society of Australasia, seconded the resolution, and also spoke in terms of great praise of the services rendered by missionaries to their country and religion 'The resolution was carried with enthusiastic applause Mr J H Mann read a brief and interesting account of the recent voyage of Commodore 1 taking to New Guinea and the hoisting of the British flag there. He was followed by the Rev. Mr Lawes, to whom a most enthusiastic reception was accorded, and whose address was listened to with deep attention In the course of it hestatedthattheconfidenceof the natives of New Guinea had been won by the establishment of the protectorate the natives showed great intelligence, and in illustration of the work of the missionaries he mentioned that many of the natives could read their own language fluently, and that some could write it as well, and that, whereas Port Moresby was once a terror to the neighbourhood, its people being pirated and marauders, they were now living at peace with all men One critic had argued that a gospel of maize would have been better than the Gospel of Matthew, but when he (Mr Lawes) first landed there he found maize growing in front of the native teachers houses, and since then many fruits and vegetables had been introduced into the island by the missionaries He confessed that he would have been glad had the union jack [been floating on both sides of the island, but the Imperial Government evidently meant, in assuming responsibility, to discharge faithfully the duties it involved, and might well shrink from assuming a protectorate over unknown tribes in unknown territory. After ", the German flag was a guarantee of law, order, and justice The case of the Hopeful labour vessel showed the necessity for protection of the natives and if the plea of mercy on he half of the condemned men in Brisbane were listened to, he hoped that the public sense of the greatness of their crime would not be lessened On the motion of the Rev. D J Hamer, seconded by Baron von Mueller, a vote of thanks was passed to the Governor for presiding At the meeting of the City Council yesterday the town clerk announced that a deputation from the metropolitan local boards of health would wait on the Chief Secretary at noon on Wednesday to represent the unfair ness of claims on account of the stamping out of small pox being charged against these boards Alderman lia. les as chairman of the Finance Committee, stated that arrangements had been made with the city rate collectors for the re valuation of city property at a cost of 977 Several councillors expressed the opinion that the present valuation was much too low Alderman Bayles quoted from the business circular of a city firm of house and land agents, to show that there was only a slight difference between the valuation placed on property at the present time and the city valuation made three years ago. The committee had, however, brought the increased value of property under the notice of the valuers At yesterday's adjourned meeting of the University council, the Bishop of Melbourne (chancelloi)mentioned that certain irregularities at recent examinations had come to his knowledge, and suggested the appointment of a committee, to whom the registrar could make a report on the subject the nature of the irregularities did not transpire, beyond the statement that it was undesirable thaton members of the council engaged in teaching should be placed on the committee The chancellor, Dr Bromby, and Mr Tilley were appointed as the committee in question The debate on the report of the committee on the extension of University teaching was resumed, and the remaining clauses were adopted with verbal amendments Professor Irving was unanimously elected treasurer of the council, the chancellor expressing an opinion that something like an illegality had been committed in leaving the institution for so many years without such a necessary officer The council at its using adjourned until the first Monday of February Both the Sydney and Victorian cricketing teams had good practice yesterday. The Sydney men practised together on the Melbourne ground, and nearly all the players are showing good form The Victorians had more desultory practice, some of them playing on the Melbourne ground, while others were preparing at East Melbourne As surmised from the outset, Midwinter is unable to play Illness has prevented him from practising and Midwinter, rather than imperil the chance of his side winning by taking a position to which he cannot do justice, has asked Mr Major to withdraw his name M Shane, as the first emergency, will fill the vacant place Messrs John Sanderson and Co received a telegram j yesterday, informing them that the steamship Port Jackson, bound for London, with wool for the January sales, arrived at Suez. on the 20th Inst The next annual united fire brigades demonstration will be held in Russell square, Ballarat, in March next 'The prize for the principal event is a silver cup and eight gold medals, of the guaranteed value of £100 presented by the American Hop Bitters Company, per Mr M H Van Bergh It will become the property of the brigade that wins the hose practice for eight men There are several other < cups for competition, amongst which the Master Butchers' Cup, value 30 guineas, and the Licensed Victuallers' Cup, of the same value, occupy leading places The official programme of events and prizes will shortly be issued A Wellington telegram this morning states that Miss Sheehan, the Castletownroche murderer, has been arrested Respecting this all air the Home h area of October 5 contains the following -"The prisoner John Duane, who has been in custody for some time in connexion with the murder at Castle town echo, six years ago, of the Sheehan family, has been brought before the magistrates at the police office, Cork, and further remanded on an information sworn by a police sergeant to the effect that private information had recently come to his knowledge which induced him to think he would have evidence against the prisoner It is stated that a constable will be despatched to New Zealand to bring back William Sheehan, who is supposed to be the principal actor in the tragedy 'Two witnesses have been found in the locality who member to have been up one night, and to have been frightened by a country cart being driven along by two men towards the well where the bodies were recently found The police are of opinion that more than one person was engaged in the murder, and they believe that the man Duane, who was the only male servant in Mrs Sheehan's house at the time of their disappearance, could throw a good deal of light on the affair He has not given any clue, however, to the mystery."

He said his firm's dealings with insolvent amounted to £33 000 The firm guaranteed the transactions which were on credit, the terms varying from one up to six months VA witness and his partners took insolvent's promissory notes, which, endorsed by the firm, were handed over to the persons for whom they were acting In October they sold the insolvent 4,000 merino wethers After receiving delivery he refused to give his promissory note, stating that he was in difficulties He refused to cancel the sale, but the firm got 3,774 sheep, out of 1910 3,818 delivered, back again They took forcible possession, sold the wool, for which they had received cash, and for the sheep, bills at six months without security 'I hey had not delivered over to the trustee the proceeds of the sale of the wool of sheep George A young, member of the firm of Young, Lascelles, Austin, and Co , Ballarat, also gave evidence as to the transactions with the insolvent, which in the course of two years and a half amounted to £50,000 At sequestration, in solvent owed the firm r2,)2, and on the occasion of the first creditors' meeting £1,700 mole To reduce the insolvents in debtedness, witness had sold insolvent's sheep, but this was prior to insolvency Commenting on the result of the recent German elections for the Reichstag, the Berlin correspondent of The 'Times wrote on October 21 - "iromull the great cities and industrial centres comes the same startling tale of Socialists to the front, and the, more over in spite of the stringent application of the repressive e law of October, and of the fact that their means of electoral agitation was thereby reduced to nil Their publications were seized, their addresses were suppressed, their meetings were despotically forbidden, and the enormous increase in their votes, by comparison with the highest number of previous years, is the emphatic answer to all this repression In Berlin, for example, the total number of Social Democratic votes tendered in 1807 was only 07 in 1871, 2,058 in 1874, 11,270 in 1877 31,522, in 1878, 50,147, in 1891, after the first rigorous application of the Socialist law, 19,17, and now, in 1884, 68, 110 In Berlin, as I reported to you last night, the Social Democrats have wrested a seat from the Progressists, or LiberaliBts, while, in another constituency of the capital, they have too to the poll again with a Liberalism, and then chances of success are good In Konigsberg, Mayence, Hanover, Brunswick, Niircnbcrg, Erfurt, Dresden, Gotha, Darmstadt Frank first, Magdeburg, Elberfeld, Carlsruhe, Breslau, and other large cities, they have similarly asserted themselves, and here then, is the result of seven years application of the Socialist law in all its rigour, This is the serious theme which pre occupies the German press, but its pessimistic views will doubtless have to be considerably modified when the complete returns of the elections are before the nation ( It remains to be seen, for example, whether the Social Democrats have voted in the spirit of antagonism to the Chancellor's economic policy, or whether they may, to some extent, be classed as his supporters For I repeat that the police have hitherto allowed them no public opportunity of speaking out their mind on the subject in any case, their demonstration in force is decidedly the dominant phenomenon of the day, but it will be time enough to examine this phenomenon more closely when complete details are to hand ' An international electric exhibition was held in Philadelphia in October and November, at winch) on sa. a -"The past decade has been not an epoch in electric discovery, but in electric invention An exhibition 10 years ago of what electricity could do as a motor or in the field of applied science would have made a sorry show compared with the display in Benjamin Franklins city 'The wise men may have been able to speaking wisely, and they may have been as eloquent in scientific formulas and principles, but the practical task of not only harnessing the lightning but driving it on the road of commerce was little more than a scientific expression the arc lighting and the incandescent lighting, the alternate making and breaking of an electric circuit, and other phases of the electric laws, were known, but little adjusted to the demands of practical life the electric lighting machines are naturally the main feature of the exhibition, some £50 arc lights and 1,000 incandescent lamps, and an enormous electric flashes on the roof make the cluster of buildings at Philadelphia appear at night like a repository of diamonds The improvements of the past few years, as illustrated in the exhibition, make a catalogue in themselvess Of microphones telephones, phonographs, annunciators, burglar alarms, call bells, washing machines, and a hundred other products of electrical powers, there is a bewildering show upon exhibition the Electrical World has set up a motor that runs its entire edition off in the building Amongst the Bell telephone exhibits at the exhibition is a most interesting apparatus Professor Bell a radiophone Its function is to transmit speech by means of a ray of light, and without wire It consists of a Hat mirror, properly suspended, by means of which a ray of light is reflected through a cell containing alum water, which absorbs the heat rays to a vibrating diaphragm about 6ft distant the diaphragm is itself a mirror, and reflects the way back through a suitable lens to a parabolic reflector, in the focus of which is a selenium cell, the terminals of which are connected with a magneto receiver Now, connected with the back of the mirror diaphragm referred to is a flexible tube, fitted with a mouth piece On talking into this tube, the mirror diaphragm vibrates, the rays which it reflects through the lens into the parabolic reflector are thereby disturbed, and undergo modifications of intensity, these ra> s are forced upon the selenium cell, and their changes affect the current in the cell in the same way that a vibrating armature affects the induced current around the poles of a permanent magnet This current from the selenium cell is carried through the back of the reflector to a hand receiver, and, hold in this to the ear, the speech is heard It is said that Professor Bell has conveyed speech 500ft in this way by means of a strong ray of light A remarkable contest for last telegraph transmission took place recently at New York, at the offices of the Western Union Telegraph Company, says? on "the prizes offered for competition were three in number, the first being a gold medal, the second a silver medal, and the third a decorated telegraph key. they were given by Messrs J H Burnell and Co., of New York, and
