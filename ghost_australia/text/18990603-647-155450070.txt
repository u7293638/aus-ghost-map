The Bndeavourer. Young. On the 22nd May, the Wesleyan Christian En deavour Society ' held its usual Monday night meet ing. Sister E. Starr led the proceedings and the power of the Holy Spirit was felt through the meeting. Nearly all the members present took part in the discussion of the topic for the night— ' The gift of power ' — and we realized more fully how necessary it is that we as Christian Endeavourers should have the power of the Holy Ghost within us. Special and earnest petitions were sent up to the the throne of grace on behalf of our minister, who has been called upon to suffer acute physical pain, and is laid aside for a time. Also for one of our members who refrains from at tending our C.E. meetings and is needing spiritual light and guidance. Some of the members held a meeting at Woodonga, a country preaching place, with the intention of forming a society there if possible. The building was filled, young men making a good pro portion of those present. The rules -and working of a society were explained bjr the visiting members, and {fourteen names were obtained wherewith to form a society. The outlook is very promising and we believe that shortly Christian Endeavour will form an important feature in this part of the circuit. We feel like singing 'Praise God from whom all blessings flow.'
