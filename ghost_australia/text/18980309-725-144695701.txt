Besides he was willing, wanting, to love her, and what woman ' is altogether indifferent to a man's : love, even if she cannot giro him her lore ? . * She did . not* mean to call him Charley, bnt he was walking much faster than when | they , were ^ coming out, end wouldn't even lookat her. , Would iehe say a word to melt him ? j 4 Charley,' (so gently, and almost repent* i ingly)j 'I told them that you bad oome with j me. So people will love you too, if you go aboat on kindly miseions/ This speech wbb said with suoh childlike ! simplioily and good-faith, that Ward stood | for a moment and looked at florrie, then burst into suoh a hearty laugh as woke the i echoes of tbe hills ; and the peaoh . blossom j ? of florrie's face reddened into rose; ; j 1 You are very rude to laugh at me.' * Dear little Fioirie, if these trees had any : humor in them, the; wouid bump each other, and laugh their tops off, out of sheer merri- i ment.at your droll Bpeeoh.* * I fail to see anything partionlarly droll about it.' 4 Then your bump of hnmor has not de veloped like every other oharming feature about you/ / I shall begin to think you a flatterer.' * Think and say what * you Like of me, Ilorrle. if you will only promise to love me a little P' 'Did love ever oome by promise f Oh, Mr. Ward, I am sorry for you— but it is im possible, and X am not of marriage yet. . .

Surely hehad plenty of time and oould write often.' Thus the girl thought and pozsled, always with a growing uneasiness and apprenmon. 1 Dear Don,' were tbe words which rose to her lips twenty times a day. She believed in him, believed that he loved her as she loved him, though no direot expression of love had ever crossed bis lips. ' Then where had she learnt itf Had she not read it in his brown eyes, and in tho touoh of his hand P Poor Don, he had 'been too modest to disclose his love, because he thought it premature to speak, buc he fancied that she understood ; and «o it was thet an undeclared love, grew day by day, aud enabled Florrie Oampbell -to put aside another eligible love, because her young virgin heart was, given to this lad, the lonely fellow who said so little and looked so much. . An air of distraotion began to be noticed about Florrie. 1 WlWa the matter with you, Florrie?' asked her sister Mary one day. 1 You look as though you were troubled/-: 'I am, but I do not want you to be troubled too,Mary/ 1 Am I not your second self, . Flo ? Ton most tell me what troubles you/ f Don will not write/ ? Only tLat. You never told me that you were really in love with Don/ 'Ido notthinklconld ever love any one else, even if he forgot ae.' ? Oh 1 yes, you would- 1 era sure Hi. Ward admires you. Fehaps he will propose. He is a man, Don is only a boy yet/ 4 1 don't /want to marry Mr. Ward, and have told him «o 5 at least I have told him I had no idea of marriage. Now why does not he fall in love with you f ' .j * Poor me, I shall never have a. ohanoe with you in a love contest, Fio, hatl do -jio^ mind that or.envy.you,.you.dearJove.: .Why don't you write again to Don? Sametbing may have )-app6ned him/ ' Yes, I will write again to-night. I have : been foolish to delay so long/ ? ' What is that .exciting newB Geordie has brought from the post P' 1 Let ns go and hear,* said Hary. * What is the matter, father !' ' The Auokland papers are full of an ao» oount of the shooting of Major Von TeQipaky and a number of his men. Hhey were sud denly taken by surprise, and fired on withont the least warning ; the rebels having posted themselves in branches of the trees over hanging the path along whioh the Major and yhis men were expeoted; The slaughter vu very one-sided. Hie successful strategy on the part of the Maoris had, emboldened them, tuid it was feared that other serious attacks on the out lying settlers of the Waikato dlstriots would be made, as a call to arms had been issued to every important tribe, so that the whole J of the rahenas might be driven into the sea. v. -^Thts is very had news,' remarked Mrs. OamgbeU/hot we are a long way from tbe ^jetHng word t^^OM^ on ^the . Wftt xis/ Zansw^ed the ever-crosking Geordie,! who had lately been endeavouring to incite ' Hr.10ampb«U; to make ready a petition Itb', the Prormdai Government to get a redoubt built there similar to the one at Howick,and -toiiave a ^volunteer corps formed, as well as soxE^ mcunted-boopers appointed to that: district.-.' To these words of warning Mr* Campbell either turned a deaf eat, or laughed them ofl with an observation that he did not think that the natives around there were badly inclined, especially sinoe he had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of lioug George. 1 Long George rales over a divided house,' was the man's reply. 4 He be all right, sad about 'alf Jus trtbe ; hut as 4er the others they would be glad to eat us without salt/ ' I think you are prejudiced^ Geordie/ said Brosy, who had just come in and was handed the paper containing the ^exciting news of the latest outbreak of hps tili ties.

' Now let try Again.' ' \- 1 Allow something for the side wind whioh is blowing,' remarked Charley. When this suggestion was adopted they all made good scoring* Ward earned off the honors, with 7 bulls' eyes out of a dozen shots! Bro'y oame next with,04 and Campbell made two at each range. * I would not oare to be the target where you are oonoemed, Charley/ remarked Mr. Campbell. * 1 bope we shall have no occasion to fire at living targets,' ^replied Ward. * What do you think of the shooting oi Von Tempsky and his men ?' * The Major was one of the best and most I courageous ,ofRcaranflvat^-sent^againHt .thej Haoris.'^ ' But he was ? outwitted in the ambush. What affects us .more particularly - is that a rumour is going round to the effect that some of the. Wairoa natives want^o ? join tbe rebels/ Geordie came up at this moment and con gratulated Ward on his 'straight shooting. ' You fairly riddled that niggers head/ 4 Go and out off every sign of it,' said Mr. Campbell, and do not allow any more sketch ing of the kind to appear/ 4 Let us have a weekly praotice,' said Mr. Campbell, as they left lor home. When they came' to a turn in the road where they would separate, Charley was wishing the Campbells good evening, when Mr. Campbell said, * Yon had better come and take tea with us this evening, Charley/ Ward hesitated. Ambrose added his word to that of his father's, and Charley fell in with the proposal. ? He had not seen Florrie sinoe the evening of his rejection. When they were approaching the farm house little Jaok met them in some excite ment, saying' that they were all crying in the house.beoause Don -Preston was drowned. What news is 1this Jaok is telling ns P' Mr. Campbell %sked of his wife. ; . * Here is the, Auokland Hsbazj-, with a dreadful aboount of what has. happened 'to poor Don «nd his oousin Marsden. New we know why he has not written/ . Then Campbell read out to the others an laooount of now. two young men, Balph | Marsden and Donald Preston had gone out : for a day's fishing in. the Kaipara Harbor, and had not been heard of sinoe (and that was a week previous). That a searoh of every pirt of the extensive harbor had been made, and notasign of the young men, or the boat, had been obtained, and it, was feared that they had been blown out of the heads, or been drifted out by the current, in whioh case, it seemed almost inevitable, that the. . unfortunate joung, fellows had met a disastrous fate. * Poor Don,' exclaimed Ambrose. 4 To meet his fate so soon/ - ?'* ' . 1 Where is Florrie P asked her father. 4 She has gone to her room.L, /She is crying her' eyes out,' said Mary, who was also in tears, for they had all been -fond of Don ^restont ^ r- ^ 1 ? ^There-was'one-bf-lho par tyr— an d ! only one —to whom the news was not bad newu. If llove is blind it is also sometimes selfish. Here was a clearing of his : path, I a . removal of a rival which Clmrieyv Ward eould not regard other than as most fortunate. Surely, now, Florriei Campbell taught love him, and net say 4 it is impossible/ * Not that evening, of course, would be adc to see the gixl he loved ; but he would cer tainly renew his suit, for so young a woman i would not long remain wodded to a mere I memory. J All tbe family were discussing the pros I and oons of the case; and seemed to agree I with the report that it was all ovec with | their old shipmate iand his oousin. 'Tbey didnot know the harbor, I sup pose, ' said Mrs. Campbell, - who had been really very fond of the lad/ ? Preston, of coarse, would know nothing about it/ said her husband, 4 but Marsden ought to have known better/ Then they mourned Don as dead ; and every good feature in his , character seemed magnified, ;n |iU he appeared as one without blemish and without spot ; this is a fashion wp all havfi-ixegardingjone who, is reepeoted, airs.
