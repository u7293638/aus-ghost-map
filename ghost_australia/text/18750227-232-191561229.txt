wesletanism and its management: - No 3. TO THE EDITOB OP THE COOBIEB. qiH —After the formation of " The Methodist New Connexion " iu 1797, Jibted in my previous letter, there came into eristence thirteen years later vision n0w fxtansively known as ' TW Primitive . Method ftsUT It was founded in Staffordshire, numbered,' .rconline to Tyerman, in 1871, 973 ministers, abbot 14 400 lav preachers, nearly 10,000 olass loaders, 8585 connerional cupels, 2813 rented chapels and rooms, 339 Sunday schools, 48,000 Sunday school teachers, Sunday school scholars, nd 10,343 church members. Then arose the Prinntive Methodists of Ireland, who seceded from1 the Wesleyon Church In 1817, tbe cause of; dis ruption being the adnnnisiration . of the sacra- jut- Dl hy the clergy. Those against tlie innovation naratM, ;md in 1861 naimbered eighty-five mimsters sod IA -47 members. After tlu- sprang into existence ftiuT divisions, viz The Protestant Metho- i.i 1S2S: the "VVesleyan Methodist Assodation in and then resulting from the memorable and dis-: .. flv sheets" business in 1848, the United vTt»..iVt liefnrmers.-which reused a loss to the origi nal U t'-Jevan connexion of 1- 0,000 members, some iv'ii"- other charches, and many none at alL Thetie t e divisions are now amalgamated into what is t-'i'w ' r< the i'nited Methodist Frre'Clrarcb; and it 0 so - d. i%'. lv71. 315 ministers, 8406 lay preachers,' 67.648 church members, ana 157,725 6uml<v f-ehool scholars.

I will instance the success ofthe Episcopal Church of America, whicb was establidied - by its venerable founder John Wesley, or, rather, by his local preachers. According to Dr Harris' speech at Camborne conference — " The first Methodist sermon that was ever preached on the continent of America — thefirtt Methodist class that was ever organised upon that distant shore, was by a local preacher from Aim land. Tlie work was carried forward under C«pt Webb, , an officer in the British anuy; and Bobl Stahbridge, who were both local preachers. To Wcsleyan local preachers, therefore, belongs the honor of planting Wes- ' leyanism in America1" — whichisuowoneoftiiegraxidest monuments ami triumphs of Christianity on record. It shwc since its formation in 1766 to 1866 astonish- - ing results— namely, 186,420 Methodist comxnuni- cantf. 13,650 travelling and 15,000 local preachers, nearly 200 colleges and academies, over 30 periodical publications, and nearly 8,000,000 members of its con gregation:-.— (Stevens.) These numbers must have been iurgely increased since, as during the four years previous to 1872 the church admitted 1782 into tlm jniu'ry, local, preachers, and 323,142 members, lu oiLcr words, it adds on the average 80,000 a year, --r iu seven years as many as English Was- leyauii-m can count in Great Britain and all her 4e- pecdvuuio>. In addition to wfai h, It numbers fonr- nitiihs ci the six leading church organisations in that cauutry. four- uiuths of their church -edifices, and 1,600. uudhy school scholars. A i w years ago the lay representation question agiuti d the public mind there, as it is now doing here: a<l in r.ugland a vote was taken on a given Sunday. re;ultiiig in an almost unanimous decMoo-ln iavur oi the principle. This principle is now in foil force there, and if tried here would -oeitainly produce idtnthal results. N '.- , in doing pioneer work in whatever part of the world "-! banner of Methodism is to be unfurled, the lay pivaeuor is found to be the most successful and useful instrument. This is asserted and indelibly eagravid on "Wesley's memorial 6tonein tbe City Road Ch.-p.-l. Loudon, viz. : — " That he (Wesley) was the nairon and friend of the lay preachers, by whose aid he estt-adrd the plan of itinerant preaching throughout Grdr.t BriLuin and Ireland, the West Indies and Amtn .-:t, with unexampled success." For a practical Cluj-u-.-iriuL of this we have only to take memory back: to the c.trly days of Ballarat, when Father Sanderson, on Smday morning, 30th November, 51, standing on a log aiQ'.ug the diggers' tents on the White Flat, preached the first sermon. The foundation of the future church was then laid here, and when,- 1 believe, there was more Christianity and defy, and less for malin- aud " respectability," than there are now. fc Tiieu it began its career in the inidst of the excitement o, marvriious gold finds. Wesleyan local preachere in bjue Houses were then seen mnnnting gfaimps on th? Touted golden ground on the "Sabbath morning, and iLc iitari-stimng sermons of the miner preachers, and tlie singing and prayers of the old Methodists who accoiujMn; -d them, made a deep impression on tbe inin. j multitude which enrrouuded them. A society was M'i'U formed, a lent chapel erected, and a eenti'i and placed in charge of the young church." .Are laborers wanted for sparse district, they are t- be una in the ranks of lay preachers, who are never eo Iwppy a when well employed — who certainly teve & much right to read and expound the Word of vod a- i.ad the scribes of old, and who are as neces— ttn-iuilie economy of Methodism in these days as jeiv ;L, laymen in the days of Christ Bang called j>ytdc Holy Ghost, equally with the ordained minis- ters, u, preach the Gospel, they are ever ready to do so, wiia \\\ illiam Garvosso, to ting— The mercy I feel to others I show, , i , .
