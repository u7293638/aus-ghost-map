A Phantom Ship. A cubious adventure happened to a Nor wegian ship not long ago. She was oaught in a storm in the neighborhood of some islands, and for some minutes was almost entirely submerged by a big wave. During this anxious period a violent shook was felt, and when the ship righted herself again, and tho sailors could look out, they perceived, hard by, an extraordinary barque of the most weird and ghost-liko appearance. The ap parition had no sails, the null and masts were worm-eaten and covered with innumerable sea-shells and seaweeds. In fact, she quite looked as if she had just been resurrected from a watery grave. The sailors, in spite of all sortB of superstitious fears, were per suaded to board the vessel. Down below thev found a number of skeletons and about a thousand guineas of the year 1809, besides gold watches and pearls, which had been blackened by the action of the sea. The phantom ship's papers were discovered in a waterproof bag, and from them it appears that she was a British brig, whioh had sunk some eighty years ago in water only just deep enough to cover her. The Norwegian ship had been dashed against her by the violence of the storm, and had thus set her afloat. Attempts were made to tug the English brig into harbor, but the violence of the bterm made the operation too difficult, and the Norwegians had to be content with taking home the contents of their find.
