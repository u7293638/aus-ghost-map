Gladstonolatry in Wales Again. A correspondent of the Guardian writes as follows :—The enormous influence of Mr. Gladstone’s name in “poor little Wales,” which can hardly be overrated, is by no means confined to Nonconformists, though among them it is naturally greatest. A few weeks since, when in Pembrokeshire, I. was conversing on Mr. Gladstone’s Irish scheme with the chief shopkeeper and postmaster of the village where I was staying, and church warden of his parish, a by no means unin telligmt man, and very much attached to the Church. He rather startled me Iry saying, “ Do you not think, sir, that it is the Holy Spirit who puts these ideas into Mr. Glad stone’s mind ?” My reply, which, I think, contained reference to Micah’s vision (i Kings xxii. 22), and St. Paul’s words to the Thessalonians (2 Thes. ii. n), was, I need hardlj7 say, utterly unconvincing. It appears that the old Scotch lady of the Leith Burghs is not solitary in her conviction that to vote against Mr. Gladstone is equivalent to “the sin against the Holy Ghost.”
