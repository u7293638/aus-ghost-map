HE WOULD BE A VOLUNTEER. -:0:- He did not want to lose his pay, He did not care to go away, But still he thought, there's no delay, For he would be a volunteer. —o— And so he joined with all the ruck, And nearly in the crowd got stuck, He had to ride in cattle truck, But he would be a volunteer. When safe at journey's end arrived, To find the camp he vainly strived, To bush him, they had near contrived, But he would be a volunteer. ——o— And having found the camp so neat, With parch'd throat and weary feet, He could not find a bite to eat, But he would be a volunteer. At last, and when the hour was late, He got some meat in awful state, For what's this crawling o'er the plate ? But he would be a volunteer. He could not eat, so let him sleep, He thinks to get in sleep so deep, When sergeant ants all o'er him creep, But he would be a volunteer. His weary body then he throws, On other spot to seek repose ; But drum and fife disturb his doze, Still he would be a volunteer. —o- A tired feeling o'er him steals, He still the pangs of hunger feels, As weary on to Parade he reels, But he would be a volunteer. And then, he tries with head erect, To really seem most circumspect, That they in him no fault detect, For he would be a volunteer. —o— His weary head falls on his breast. He keenly feels the want of rest, He's failed, although he did his best, As he would be a volunteer. He looks on empty plate and cup,. There's nought to eat, nor yet to sup, So he'll go home aud give it up, For he WON'T be a volunteer. " They talk about Leap Year being full of proposals," grumbled the insurance agent, who travells for the Equitable, and here have I been working up the business as hard as I can, and so far not a single proposal, or even a ghost of one." But he has yet to learn differences between the proposals which relate to the insurance of life and those which result in durance for life.
