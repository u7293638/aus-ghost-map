OUR LONDON NEWS-LETTER [From our own, Correspondent.] London. June 27. 1884. The Prime Minister has shown himself a master in the art of strategy. On. Monday in. laying, on the table of the House, of con-<*> mons the recent correspondence with the- French Government, he made, a sJatementM to the terms of agreement relative to Egypt, France agree? to abandon, the theory of tb? dual control, long, siuce pragtically dead,, and-, to refrain from any armed intervention in* Egypt when that country fa, cyMutated, except . with the consent of England, On the other hand our troop* are to be withdrawn, in three years apd a halt, and,are to remain a farther indefinite period at the wttt, of England, unless the Powers are unanimous in wish ing them, to continue. The. scheme also provides for an enlargement ot the powers ot the commission of the public debt. It is apt to control finance generally, but to hare the right to veto any proposed expenditure whitth would produce an excess on the Budget, The commissioners consist of a French scan, an Austrian, an Italian^, and. an Englishman. The latter is now to be president, and to have a casting vote. This arrangement is based on the theory from which our Government have Be*er aweryed—that we must evacuate E/yjpt as soon as she has a stable Government and. ? can act independently, and further on the principle laid down by M. Ferry that" Egypt is neither, English, nor French.; it U essen tiaily i__*_atkmaL aid European"—the eon tentton being that in conquering that country we did not abrogate Kwropean rights-theNio. It ? ale? pnospeotively agreed that Egypt shall be neutralised —that is. be made into a bind of African Belgium, and that the Suez Canal shall be put under international con trol. But these are matters for negotiation after 1888. Mr. Gladstone also anaouooea. to the vexation of tin Opposition, that the question of relieving the finances of Egypt ?m to be-aubmttted to a cooferMtoe- wUoh is to meet to-moti!ow? and hedeeUned to explaio, what that plan was, but when Hie Powers had come to a-decieion it would be laid before Parliament, and Ministers would abide by the retnlt Attempts have been made to in duce Mr. Gladstone to reveal the fisaqoiaL plan, be* witttout avail, and. the, Conser vatives loudly comnlwn. that they'ham been tricked, the. attempt having been made to prepjude PtacUvnen* from pass ? ing, judgment am the whole sohajw. tilt it wan r*?£*i by BarQee. |4i fiesA. it appeared to, UM OppssifiVm leaders, after rrnnnltingth? inrtarwdsn*- T- itHrr*J? 1 tftnt they must petfptoe .*/&, theugh it had been de cided beforehand, tint under any. circum -. stances a. ve<? of- csasore should be moved. i But Lord BandolpkObarchill—who on Mon day indulged, in * very foolish attaoli: upon Branca, declaring that her .engagement* were vslnnlrM i iwottldjant wait, but woald aot of ?

Yesterday was almost an historic day in our parliamentuy history. The repoet stage of tiie Fraachise BUI was completed, on Tuesday, and yesterday it was down- for third reading., There was at first a eeowdad. tMxnAnji**, but whon questions had been ansvoed—inslndingjan engagement to take the, vote of censure on Monday, and the in formation that aH the Powers, Turkey in dnded^had accepted the invitation, to tJw Conference—the House tegan to empty. On the motion for **"> third reading of tie JFran* cbias Bill, the Premier can and began-sseajc icg in a quiet voice that did not attract mncb. attention. H& had not proceeded far, how ever, when the impectaace of bis speech, waa recognised. Alluding to rumours that the Tfrpi? of Ixrds *"*T?Tf"i to tbrow oat the Franchise BUI, he said, the principle whiom had actuated, andrtUlaetuated, the Govern ment waa expressed in the f*tin<ii^y i^p?? of Shakespeare— Be?are Of entnocetoaqsarrel; but, btiogin, Bear it that ttt?ea]w*er may beware of thee. TbSs significant quotation was received with prolonged cheering from the Liberal benches, tiie sound ?+wWcbreacbingttje lobby brought member* htaixiedry in. and from tttia Wtne till the Premier sat down the Houte resumed its crowded sppears?ce. Mr. Gladetooe hai, lie 1 aid, wished to have kept silence to the end. bat expressions osed in that House showed dearly what was the general view of the in cntion of the Lords. One member had said no practical man believed this Bin had the ghost of a chance. It was understood that the ground upon which tiie Ijords, if they took the action imputed to them, would tbrow it out was that it was an incomplete measure. A complete Reform Bill had never been presented to Parliament. Here on tiie LGtbof June they were considering the third reading of the simplest Franchise Bill ever introduced. Where would they have been if redistribution bad been included in the measure! To unite the Bills would have been a fraud" upon Parliament and the country, for it was an absolute impossibility to pass a double measnre in a single session. Tbe Government hadfcequently ex pressed thslr intention of dealing with re distribution next year, and in adopting Mr. H. Fowler's resolution they had em bodied their pledge in the present BUI. If the anticipations of which he had spoken wese realised there was before them the most serious conflict that had been in the view of Pacaament since the period of the Cam Lavs. -As to what the iaiue will be," the Premier aaUL.with emphasis, "I have not the slightest doubt," a remark received with prolonged ehffring from the XAberals, aad aanreved?y fiw"rt i?*?*Ji"'afT mmwHmt ?M fl Laid JBaMkil?h OancchUl and Slr-fttafiocd Sortboote rose together,, the Boble lord for seme momenta.declining to.ziro prece dence te " his raayeotea leader."

It was evidently the. dcaire o£ the ? ctiimtry to ?cc the franchise extended*, and not a word had been said in opposition to the principle by any Conservative speaker.

TRENCH ItISSIABCK ON GERMAN COLONIAL KHJCY. The German Chancellor, on the 23rd, made an important speech before the Budget Com mittee in connection with the Bill for sub siduteg a line of steamer* between Germany, the Bast, and Australia. Tbataneat?re had little chance of being paaaed during the present tesiion, and his sole object in present ing himself before the committee was to enlighten foreign Governments as to the dhrec tion and objeet?efGemancolooial policy. He Mid that the intelligence which had reaehad him enabled bim to say with certainty that the British Cabinet no longer put forward any claims to Angra Pequena. Adverting to the Oo?go question, the Imperial Chancellor said that negotiations had been co?Mneneed with Portugal, aad them was reason to hope 1 hat an auangemest would be effected ost&fa.; liihing free commercial traffic in that region. Prince Bismarck added that he had obtained the Emperor's aanotion to pursue a colonial policy in thcs-ngl—? whteh ahoold notfgfe low the French system, but be dmeoted to the protection of German commerce. Prince Bismarck rose repeatedly daring tbe debate, and dwelt upon the colonial policy of the European Powers, eapeoalfeafJatawd^feMoe, The las* pemal-Ohaacettor pointed; out thsttae did not piopeso that Germs?y aboaid adopt'a real eeloaaal poUny, but^H>-oo?rtder?d Iv^e^taty ot tii?rnms?tQmSatd. protaetiow, as.£w.*a? poaalbJa, to private colonial entarnrise.^and, in cases where Germans took possession of ownerless territory to further the attainment of thetrobjeot.
