THE DIVINING-ROD. " Be who limits things by his own narrow sense is a fool."—Habguave Jennikgb. TO THE EDITOB. Sir—The increasing attention of science is being given to the all-important problem of a kind of rapport between hidden springs and certain "sensitives." I may feel proud in having aided Mr. Gerber's gift of this nature to be noticed, but what can an ever so sincere enthusiast do without the co- operation of the daily Press in matters where ignorance and prtjudice defy all attempts of honest investi gation? I fought (foolishly, maybe) for the phenomena of spiritualism as revealing hidden springs of useful knowledge, and feel satisfied to let the ghosts depart from the scene, and rejoice in the discovery of springs of quickening water after all fuss. The monthly Sphynx, a German journal, seems now the best of all psychological periodicals, and I sent a recent number to Mr. Gerber wherein this divining rod question is thoroughly sifted and the vast importance of this strange faculty of detect ing water clearly demonstrated. "I hope Mr. Gerber will utilize this opportune chance of drawing the attention of your readers in all colonies to thiB momentous fact, which cannot be touched any longer by occasional failures or complicated results of mixed causes. If the precious certainty is established .(and it looks likely to be) that springs will be so discovered, then our persevering Mr. K. Evans will, as a good Christian, join in the thanksgiving for extended knowledge and cheerfully forget bis tomfooleries about difficult but benevolent questions, and laugh with me at the London P.R.S., where a woman could for a little while upset " evi dences" by thoughtless gossip, and thereby turn the attitude of the august body into ridicule. I love a glass of crystalline waterafter a round of diverse liquors, and feci now very happy at the fresh springs after so many chases of tricky and vexing spirits, I am. Sir, &c.;, C. REIMERS.
