BRAIN SPECTRES The brain makes ghosts both sleeping and waking. A man was lying in troubled sleep when a phantom, with the cold hand of a corpse, seized his right arm. Awaking in horror, he found upon his arm still the im- pression of the cold hand of the corpse, and it was only after reflecting that he found the terrible apparition to be due to the deaden- ing of his own left hand in a frosty night, which had subseqluently grasped his right arm. This was a real ghost of the brain, which, the awkening of the senses and the understanding explained. M. Gratiolet narrates a dream of his own which is sin- gularly illustrative of how the brain makes ghosts in sleep. Many years ago, when oc- cupied in studying the organisation of the brain, he prepared a great number both of human and animal brains. He carefully stripped off the membranes, and placed the brain in alcohol. Such were his daily oc- cupations, when one night he thought that he had taken out his own brains from his own skull. He stripped it of its membranes. He put it into alcohol, and then he fancied he took his brain out of the alcohol and re- placed it in his skull. But, contracted by the action of the spirit, it was much reduced in size, and did not at all fill up the skull. He felt it shuffling about in his head. This feeling threw him into such a great perplexity that he awoke with a start, as if from night- mare. M. Gratiolet, every time he prepared the brain of a man, must have felt that his own brain resembled it. This impression awaken- ing in a brain imperfectly asleep, whilst neither the senses nor the judgment were active, the physiologist carried on an apera- tion in his sleep which probably had often occurred to his fancy when at his work, and which had then been summarily dismissed very frequently. A pursuit which had at last become one of routine, and the associa- ition of himself with his study, explain the bizarre and ghastly dream of M. Gratiolet. A sensation from the gripe of a cold hand, misinterpreted by the imagination acting without the aid of the discerning faculties, accounts for the ghasitly vision of the other sleeper. Every one is conscious of a perpetual series of pictures, sometimes stationary, sometimes fleeting, generally shifting; yet occasionally fixed in his mind. Sleep is the period in which the nerves derive their nourishment from the blood. The picturing nerves, like those of the senses, are generally inactive in their functions at feeding times; and thoroughly healthy nervous systems dream very little or not at all. Dreams be- token troubled brains. The brain of a woman who had lost a portion of her cranium used to swell up and protrude when she was dreaming, and then contract and become tranquil again when she was sleeping soundly. The wakeful senses, the active judgment, and the will even of the strongest and soundest minds, are not always able to control the false and perverse impressions of the nerves. I knew once a commander in the navy whose left eye was shot clean out by a bullet in a naval action in the beginning of this century, and whom, forty years after- wards, it was impossible to convince that he did not see all sorts of strange objects with his lost eye. "It is not impossible," he would say; "I know it too well." Every body has known men who suffered rheu- matism in legs long lost and replaced by wooden ones. A nervous, dreamy, imaginative lad was walking one day with some comrades among rank grass. The place was noted for ad- ders, and the youth talked about them. Instantly this lad felt something enter the leg of his pantaloons and twist himself with the swiftness of lightning round his thigh. He stopped terrified, and a careful examin- tion proved that the adder was a creature of his imagination. The vividness of the fancy of this youth made his waking senses and his discerning faculties of no more use to him for the moment than if they had been asleep. This condition of the brain is called by the savans hallucination. Mueller, the phy- siologist, and Goethe, the poet, have both described hallucinations to which they were subject, and which they compared in con- versation together. The rarest case, says Mueller, is that of an individual who, whilst perfectly healthy in body and mind, has the faculty, on closing his eyes, of see- ing really the object he wishes to see. His- tory cites only a very few instances of this phenomenon. Carden and Goethe were ex- amples of it. Goothe says:-- "When I close my eyes and stoop my head, I figure to myself and see a flower in the middle of my visual or- gan. This flower preserves only for an in- stant its first form. It soon decomposes itself, and out of it issues other flowers, with coloured and sometimes green petals. They were not natural but fantastic flowers, yet regular as the roses of the sculptor. I could not look fixedly at that creation, but it re- mained as long as I liked without increasing or diminishing. In the same way when I imagined a disc full of various colours, I saw continually issue from the centre to the circumference new forms like those of the kaleidoscope." Mueller tallked this subject over with Goethe in 1828. It was interesting to them both. " Knowing," says Mueller, "that when I was calmly lying on my bed with my eyes shut, although not asleep, I often saw figures which I could observe very well, he was very curious to learn what I then felt. I told him that my will had no in- fluence either upon the production, or upon the changes of these figures, and that I had never seen anything symmetrical or of the character of vegetation." Goethe could at will, on the contrary, choose his theme, which transformed itself forthwith in a manner apparently involuntary, but always obeying the laws of symmetry and harmony. Mueller used to get rid of the figures which haunted him by turning his face to the wall. Although he did not see them change place, they were still before him, but they soon began to fade. Jean Paul recommended the observation of these phantoms as a good plan for falling asleep. These are hallucinations of sane minds. The delusive sensations of flying and falling are known to many persons. Young girls lying in bed between sleeping and waking at the epoch of life when their girlhood is passing into womanhood, are especially apt, like the religious ecstatics, to fancy they are flying. And nearly everybody is familiar with the hallucination of falling from per- sonal experience. When lying in bed, try- ing in vain to fall asleep, or to warm the cold sheets, the patient feels as if sinking through the floor, and stretches out his arms sud- denly to save himself; yet nothing has hap- pened except the coincidence of a cold shiver with a complete expiration. Physiologists andl philosolphers of autho- rity say we are all mad in our dreams; and if the absence of the control of reason is a true definition of insanity, there is no gain- saying the proposition. But madness means something more. In dreams the faculties which control the picturing or imagining powers, are simply inactive; they are nei- ther absent nor incapable. Far from iden- tifying sleeping dreams with madness, I feel disposed to contend that voluntary and mo- mentary hallucinations-seeing by the blind, hearing by the deaf, sensations of smelling, touching, tasting, things which do not exist -are only signs of insanity when the facul- ties needful for correcting the errors of sen- sation are diseased. Persons unaccustomed to railway travelling are not insane, al- though for many minutes they often believe the train is going backwards, because they retain the power of correcting the hallucina- tion by watching the objects they are pass- ing. The senses are seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, and tasting instruments. There are between these and the seat of intelli- gence, nerves performing the functions of carriers. Even after the instruments have ceased to exist, the carriers often continue to carry messages-false messages. When a man has lost an eye, during the inflamma- tory period of recovery the carriers convey horrible images of fiery figures. It is the carriers who convey the pain of rheumatism from the lost limb. A man who was recovering from typhus fever believed he had two bodies, one of which was tossing in pain on an uneasy bed, and the other lying sweetly on a delicious couch. I am not disposed to ascribe this hallucina- tion to the duality of the brain, but to a conflict between the recollections of his suf- ferings, and the experience of his recovery. If the patient should have been permanently unable to overpower memory by reality he would have been insane, like the maniacs who believe their legs to be stalks of straw, or their bodies fragile as glass. Pictures have produced hallucinations. Leaving aside the eyes of Madonnas, cases in which the power of religious ideas come into play, I may mention other instances of their effects on minds keenly sensitive of the beauties of the fine arts. A French physi- ologist, whilst studying intensely an English engraving of Landseer's Horse-shoeing, smelt horn burning, and fixed the idea in his mind for the moment that the smell came from the foot of the horse in the en- graving. Another Frenchman records a similar experience. He had been taking a preparation of Indian hemp, and was seated at table with a picture behind him repre- senting a battle of cavelry, when he sud- denly turned round, crying, "Well, then I dislike kicking horses, even in paintings."
