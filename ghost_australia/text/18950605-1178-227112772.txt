SPOOKS AT SINGLETON. The Town Badly Seared. Singleton, Wednesday. There is a great sensation here over the reported appearance of the ghost of a man named Vickery, who waB mysteriously missed soma years ago. One well-known resident seriously asserts that tho other night, while walking home, ho saw what he supposed to be a friend of his a little ahead on tho road. Overtaking the man, he tapped him on the shoulder, and to his intense annoyance his hand passed right through the form beside hiin. The spook then vanished, and has not since returned. Also it is asserted with equal solemnity that watchers by night have seen a weird ghostly light moving about in a paddock near the cemotory. Tho other ovening a party of fully 100 cold, sobor townspeople wont out and waited hours for the coming of the oharnol-house caudle, but it arrived not with exasperating persistency, and up to data it does not seem likely to. The extension of a month's time asked for by the Deau Commission has been granted. Mr. Sydney Buxton says the first intima tion of the appointment of the Governor of New South Waics will be sent to the Government of tho colony.
