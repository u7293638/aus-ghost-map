/THE .STORY-TELLER. BÜTTONHEAD'S BROTHER. By Cissie Loftus, Author of "Jim's Ida," &c.;, &c.; (Conclusion.) "You wouldn't think it was only a jveek since we first met," Jack said softly And his eyes wandered round the room. "No, indeed," spid Margaret. Her face looked red in the firelight, and she Bcreened her eyes with her hand. .' The scene is just the same," Jack went on. "Same room, same hideous ornaments, same fire, same teapot, same absence of Buttonhead." "Don't call him Buttonhead," said Margaret. " But that's his name in the play," Jack persisted; " this play-our play »-where the scene is just the same, but where to-night the players are different." "How are they differentP" said the girl, with something like a start. " Tes," said Jack. " We have, or we shall have, two new players» to-night." He got up, and then sat down opposite the girl, where he could see her face. X'" Now for the birth of two beings, who I live for an hour and then die together in the dame there," and he held his hand out to the fire. " Explain," said Margaret. "' They will come out of our eyes, so Watch. Can you see my eyes ?" "Perfectly, thanks." " No-you are not near enough ; come üloser." Margaret laughed, and brought her chair right up to Jack's and the sat with their knees almost touching. " Come, now ; that's better !" said he. '' Now look atme, and tell me, first of ftll, are you in love with Andrew?" Margaret hesitated a little. " Te-es-I suppose so," she said. " Lie the first," counted Jack on his -Çnger. J Margaret reddened a little. j " I think I am indignant !" she said. I The man stared steadily at her. " Oh ,-jio, you're not," he said. " And secondly, ?vere you ever in love with Andrew ?" " Of course ! Don't be stupid, Jack !" " Lie the second !" said Jack calmly. " Oh !" protested Margaret. I " Quite so. Oh !" continued Jack, his eyes still fixed on her face. "Did you, or did you not, pal in with Andrew because you couldn't find any- body better in Middlegate ?" " You're a horrid brute ! And what a vulgar phrase-'pal in'!" said Mar- garet, evading the question. " You are not asked to make any com- ments on my phrases or on me, but to answer my question, And don't fidget -about on your chair." "I'm not fidgeting; and I shall not answer that question !" said Margaret, defiantly. " I am answered," he Baid. " And now, ¿on't answer in a hurry, just think it over. But if-if, mina you-you had ¿had the good fortune to meet me first idon't interrupt, please ; it's an awfully ffead habit-would you not have fallen in ¡love with me ?" Margaret lowered her eyes, and gave the ghost of a laugh. "You are an idiot !" she said. 1 " Quite so ; who denied it ?" said Jack "That íb not the question. "What we want to get at-and we beg yon to ob- serve that it is all being done in the most ¡orderly way-is. Wouldn't yon have floved me if you had met me first ?" { " No," madman !" said Margaret fldget "Çng with the lace at her wrists. " Why should I?" ' " You are equivocating, my Midget," «aid Jack, leaning forward. "Would you not ?" . "No!" " Do try and speak the truth !" " No !" Jack laid his hand gently on her knee. C, " Would you not have loved me ?" he ïàîd quietly. No, no, no!" said Margaret, nearly .trying. "Do leave me alone !" ' " You are getting hysterical ! A bad jsign," said Jack. " Look at me, Midget," ¡Margaret sïîWied the pattern of the carpet with unusual interest. " Look at me. Midget," he repeated in ¿he gentlest of voices. And Margaret's jfclue eyes met his grey ones. " Wouldn't (you have loved me ?" he whispei-ed. ' Margaret's brain seemed to be swim- ming round. " It isn't fair ; you're mes jmerising me." "Wouldn't you have* loved me?" he Jtvhispered again. ' The girl's face was pale, and they .-were both silent for a second. Jack still äeant forward with his hand on her knee aid his eyes fixed on hers. It seemed to ¡both of them that their hearts were ran- kling a furious race with the little clock en the mantelpiece. The glow from the .561« heightened the glow in their eyes, iand flickered alternate red and white on jfcheir faces. £ " Wouldn't you have loved me?" she ,eaw .the question on his lips, though it /was syoken too softly for her to hear. ">" What's the good of struggling against Sum?" she thought; "he's too strong for jne." I f "WellT" he asked. 1 V'HaveiÉyour own .wayT said Mar fearet. leaning back in her chair. I "Hurrah!" laughed Jsck softly. "Hurrah! hurrahT hurrah! 2fy little Midget!" And, jumping up, he seized ter by the waist on her chair, and swung round the room with her in a mad sort of dance. "Good heavens!" panted Margaret, *vhen he had stopped, ,r"Fow strong you are! Why, you lifted me £*E.t«at chair as if I were a baby !" " That's exactly what you are, my little Midget-a baby, pure and simple !" " I admit the former qualification, and ase my own reservations as regards the latter," laughed Margaret, seating her Belf in Jack's chair. f. .Jack laughed, and stood by the fire, testing his elbow on the mantelpiece. .They looked at each other and smiled. "You seem to be in good spirits !" said ;Margaret. "Who wouldn't-with you? But let ta be serious again for five minutes." "No. We're so jolly as weare. Don't Ibe serious again." "Oh Midget, my little fairy!" said Jack earnestly, " don't you wish that I Could take you away to soma enchanted island, where we could live as king and Jjueen, and hold a fairy court?" ( " It sounds delightful !" " You would be the sweetest lady in the world, and I would be your humblest Jslave." "Itcertainly would have its charms, unfortunately, you see, there are no en- chanted islands, and you will not take me away!" "No," said Jack solemnly, "Imust Jiofc take you away. You belong to andrew.-** "I never did care a button for andrew !" burst out Margaret. "A buttonhead!" suggested Jack. * No, my dear ; but yon are his promised Wife, and I do not take away with me the promised wife of my brother--do I, my /ady?" " I wouldn't come !" said Margaret. ^ " You will not be asked. But it will jbe pleasant to know that-oh, well never aminci. Yon are going to marry 'Andrew." " And see you here eveiy day?" "I," said Jack lightly, '"leave here to pjght." Margaret jumped np from har chair .Trith red cheeks. "You are going awayf" " Yes." "Wly?" -** Because my sister-in-law would Be a little too charming for "my peace of mind." "You are going away because you love me?" asked Margaret, with her hand on Jack's arm. " You have said it." " Oh, but," said Margaret, her cheeks a little paler and her eyes a little brighter, "Don't go away, Jack !" " Why should I stay ?" " Because-because-Jack, I love you, too !" "Another reason why I must leave here at once. Besides you don't really love_ me yet, my Midget; you're only fascinated and interested. You would certainly love me if I stayed mnch longer." " You have a charming idea of your- self!" said Margaret, with a little laugh. "Not mora charming than the idea you have of me." " Well, I never !" "A very dull remark," said Jack, calmly. " Could you ever," said Margaret, "be serious about anything ?" " I was never more serious in my life ! Surely you must see that ! I have been away for three years. I came home on Monday, and I run away again on Satur- day ! I came, as I thought, to stay. It seems that I came only to go. How- ever, it was worth the coming, and it's worth the going." "What is?" " To have seen you, my Midget," said Jack, tenderly. " You think that I am going to stay here and marry Andrew ?" " Yes, dear ; you must." Margaret shook her head in dissent. " He'll be here soon," she said, glancing at the clock. " Jack-" And she heisitated a little. "Well?" Margaret sidled up to him. "Give me one kiss before you go !" Jack put his arm round her, and drew her close to his side. Margaret looked at him, her eyes shining.. "You'll be married when I see you again," said Jack in a whisper. Margaret'shook her head vigorously. " Yes, yes, yes !" said Jack. "And no, no, no!" persisted Mar- garet, looking up at him invitingly. " Do kiss me ! I love you !" " You're not shy," commented Jack. The girl drew herself away from him indignantly, her cheeks flaming a fine red. " You brute !" she cried, and then sat down on the sofa sobbing. " Why did you ever come here !" she said, presently. Jack was leaning his head on his hand. "I am going away to-night," he re- plied. " Don't be unkind to me, sweet lady. You do not know how unkind I am being to myself!" "You insulted me!" said Margaret, her eyes full of tears. "No, dear child. I could not insult you. But I am trying not to kiss you not to kiss you!" he burst out again. "Good God! I'm praying all the gods in heaven to keep me from taking yon in my arms and crushing all the very life out of you with kisses !" And he raised Mb hot face from, his hands and walked violently up and down the room. Margaret looked a little scared athis vehemence, and in her heart loved him a good deal more for it. " Poor Jack !" she said sofcly. Jack stopped in the middle of the room. .' "And poor Margaret!" she added lightly. " It's a little bit of a struggle for her, too, you know, Jack!" Jack gave a movement forward, as if he would have flung himself at ner feet, then turned suddenly and walked over to the mantelpiece. There he stood leaning his head on his elbows, and Margaret could hear him whispering to himself: " Midget ! Midget ! My little Midget !" "What shall I do?" she thought. '. Andrew may come in at any moment; he mustn't see us like this ! Jack, she said softly. ~ " Well girlie ?" said Jack, raising his head with an effort. "Think of Andrew! He'll be here presently what are you going to say ?" " I must get cool," said Jack, walking over to the window. " I shall say it is unfortunate that I am of such a roving disposition that I never can stay for any length of time in any particular place and another day at Middlegate will drive me raving mad. " Will they accept that as the only ex- planation of your sudden departure," said Margaret. " They will accept what they get," said Jack. They all think I'm mad, and I never was given to explanations. I must go and get my things together." " Where will you go to ?" asked the girl. Jack went over to her and took both her hands in his. "I shall fly away to the land east of the sun, west of the moon," he said gently. "Be serious!" said Margaret im- patiently. " Oh, what does it matter, dear lass ?" said Jack. " One place ia the same as another. And wherever I go I shall carry you with me, although I am leav- ing you behind." He took her in his arms, and let the girl rest against him. "I mustn't kiss you," he saidwhisper jpgly; but ha let his lips rest for a moment on her hair. '. Good-bye, little Midget! Good-bye!" A footstep outside caused them to separate hurriedly, and Margaret went quickly over to the looking-glass to see if ehe looked as if she had been crying, as Andrew came in, Jack went up to his brother, and took hold of his arm. I want to see you and mother upstairs," he said. " What about ?" asked Andrew. " You'll hear in a minute, Andrew, old boy" said Jack, pushing him gently '.brough the door. Go and find mother. You 'tay her«, Midget," he said. <-I shall *only * ft**»««** " *** he followed Andrew u^"**1^', , , Margaret, wandering io °r^ Tnd the room, could hear their co voices' in the room above. " He's going away !" she thought dully. " I've only known hint a week, and yet I feel as if he had filled up the whole of my life. I can't remember a time when he wasn't there. Oh me. He's going away!" and Margaret pressed her hand to her side, as if the* thought gave her physical pain. Slie/sêeniéd to have a throbbing lump in her throat, and her eves felt hot and tired. " Iii is sor temblé," she' thought, " that I liaVe to conceal what I feel ! I mustn't cry before them; and I shan't be able to say'good-bye or anything ! O', Jack, Jack, Jack !" As if in- answer, the door opened, and Jack came in with his brother. His mother was upstairs packing his few belongings. "Well, Midget," said Jack gaily, "off again, you see! Not a .minute to spare!" "leant understand' it at all," said Andrew, solemnly. "Nobody asked you to," laughed Jack impudently. "But if you swear on your Oath you'll never tell a soul ana least of all Midget there, I'll tell yon the real reason that's driving me from Middlegate." Margaret looked at him apprehensively and Jack gave her a little reassuring smile. "I never take an oath about any- thing," said Andrew ; " but, of course I'll not mention it to anyone if you wish it." Jack laughed at his brother's solemnity and then leant forward and said to him in'a loud whisper: "I can't stand Midget's shoes !" "Why, you're joking again!" said Andrew reproachfully. "It has just dawned upon you,my Andrew, ha»it?" '" " " "I thought you were serious." " You ought to know by now that I am never serious about anything-except my meals," he said as an after-thought. "The cab's there," said Äfargaret, mournfully. " Oh, you can't be really going, Jack ! Tell him," she said, turning entreatingly to Andrew, " that he musn't go." " It's no use my arguing !" said Andrew. "When Jack makes up his mind about anything, wild horses won't make him alter it !" " Come and see me off," said Jack, going out to the front door. His mother joined him on tlie step, and ventured another timid protest against this desertion of them. " And we thought you wei'e going to be here for the wedding and all !" she said, tearfully. "Very sorry, mother; you'll have to get married without me !" he said, laugh- ing at her long face. Margaret and Andrew came out on to the steps. . " "Well," said the latter, grasping his brother's hand, " if nothing will keep you here, good-bye, Jack, old fellow. Come back to us again when you get tired of rushing about." " That will I !" said Jack, heartily ; and then he turned to Midget. "Be good and happy, little Midget," he said, holding her hand tenderly. " Think of youl' brother sometimes. Be brave, too. The girl in the story must play her part well, you know. Good-bye !" .' She shan't marry Buttonhead, all the same !" cried Midget after him, as he got into the cab. Jack smiled a little wistfully at her, and kissed his hand as the man drove off with him. " Buttonhead ! Who's Buttonhead ?" asked Andrew, as they went up the steps together. [The end.]
