An Unfortunate Editor. , Reuben Pullaway was the editor of the Echo City Jîtazer. For nearly twp score years the latchstring of his office'had always been out and he had. moulded opinion ' until he grew .mouldy, says the Tribune, of Fre mount, Neb.., He had referred to every' man in town as-a perfect gen-; tleman, and to every lady as a queen of society, and as ne .grew old he longed for a chance to roast some- body."'.-. . : " Uh," he would exclaim, and in the silent ' eventide, - while .? the tears coursed down his furrowed cheeks, " oh, for an opportunity to turn loose and crucify somebody ! I am filled with adjectives which wouldlook mag- nificent in print; but'I daré not ! If I were to attack ¡ any one'he would stop his paper and perhaps take out his advertisement;" j So Reuben PüUáway wrote flatter- ing paragraphs about people, and . grew sullen and taciturn. _.'And his cross seemed greater than he could bear.?>f.
