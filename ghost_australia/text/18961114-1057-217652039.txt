But ah, the meeting holds regret ! Tho sad, sad story, often told, Of hands that ours.havo often met, Closo folded under churchyard mould ; 0! eyes that folded into our own, Closed in tho dreamless sleep of God : A sweeter rest was never known Than theirs, beneath jha grave's white sod. A tender thought for them to-night, A tribute tear from memory ; Beneath their covering of whito Sweet may their dreamless slumber bo. — Anon.
