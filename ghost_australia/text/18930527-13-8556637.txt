I BISMARCK IN RETIREMENT. - I (From the: World.) Fredeiichsruhe, Bismarck, favourite residence, was originally a shooting-box built by Count Lippcslimbcrg in 1763. The old building had completely disappeared, but on the spot where it stood a retired valet had built a tavern, which for a long period bore the name of Frascati. After the Franco Prussian war, in 1871, the Emperor William allotted to his Chancellor, out of the in- demnity paid by France, the sum of Â£100,000. With it portion of this sum Bismarck purchased the properly, restoring its ancient name to the domain. Here he has established extensive sawmills, where the wood of the neighbouring forest of Sachen Wait! is cut up and forwarded to Hamburg for ship- building purposes. The profit from this industry alone is put at 30,000 dol. In addition from his distillery at Varzin, his stock-farm nt SchoenhauBCn, his yeast factory at State Hanover, and from various commercial enterprises in which he is interested he realises not less than toO.GOOd. a year. Being frugal almost to parsimony, he saves a large part of this income. He does not believe in miscellaneous charity, and at one time, when he was besieged by needy applicants, he published in the Berlin newspapers a singular announcement to the effect that it was useless to apply to him for help. The notice was characteristically unceremonious and outspoken. Nevertheless, to his own tenantry Bismarck is kindness itself. In return they adore him, and every Christmas they testify to that adoration by deluging him with all sorts of presents in kind from barrels of home- brewed ale to yards of sausage and mountains of Hamburger, and when his physicians allow him- often, indeed, when they forbid him-he does full justice to these humble j offerings. The Prince's home life is as methodical as clock-work. He rises at 10 o'clock, when he takes a cup of black coffee, rolls, and' possibly a boiled egg or so. During this repast he reads the papers, and after it he looks over his mail. A second breakfast, consisting of a small steak or chop, with a bottle of Rhine wine, is served at half-past li. An hour later he sets out for a walk through his estates, sometimes dropping in at a restaurant and refreshing himself with a glass or two of beer. His companions are two magnificent Danish hounds, who, indeed, never leave him, sleeping in his rooms at night, sitting beside him in his study, and' following him whenever he stirs abroad. At 2 o'clock Prince Bismarck returns to his study, and takes up his work for the day. His main employment is said to be on a book of memoirs, which will undoubtedly be the event of the hour when it appears. But little about this book has been allowed to leak out. During his working hours he usually smokes a cherrywood pipe filled with light tobacco. At 1 o'clock he goes out for a drive, and returns about half-past 6 to dress for his 7 o'clock dinner. This is always a full dress affair, and there are usually a number of guests present. He is not exactly an epicurean. His tastes are hardly delicate enough for that. But his once enormous appetite is even now only regulated and controlled by medical advice, and he is obliged to content himself with none but the lightest and most digestible dishes. Still, the principal meal of the day is a matter of much serious thought. He himself draws up every morning with his chief the menu of the day, and, no matter what distinguished guest be waiting in the antechamber, the cook is always admitted without delay. In a dilettante way Bismarck has always been fond of music, and he still enjoys listen- ing to the classical composers, of whom Beethoven in his favourite, and he often sings softly to the music, but very much out of June. For painting and sculpture he cares less. There are few statues in his park, few pictures in his palace. Yet he has a weakness for light literature, being fond of Gaboriau, Finubcit, and Concourt, und a genuine admiration for Shakspeare and for Goethe. He has even gone so far us to say that he would willingly remain several years on a desert island with nothing to read but Goethe. "Of the whole of profane literature, he once said, "Faust is my bibles' Historical study has always been a passion with him.
