Tho. moioutsa of lanst mooting woro read and oonfrmod, aftor whihob Miesra. Hugh Hanlohti nd John Jorrott, wore unnni. mbusly dlooted:moemborn of theo inatitto. The programmo for noxt mooting wans thlon nnnounobd, the 'doehbato' to bo on the quesotion--" ITn iidfifmtantin l ovidonoe a!ooo eufllioint to wurrnnt, conviotion in oepital oascan?" M r, Gorgo r Thompson to lead in the afllrmantive, and Mr. John Cook in the negative. The essay, post poned from theo present meeting, will be prepared by IMr. Alexander Robinsou. The select readings and recitations were tlen proceeded with-the memnbers beoing complimented on the taste displayed in the selection-and the president trusted that equal judgment would always be exoercised, in order to preserve the high moral tone of tihe proceedings. The proe sident notified that the next meeting will he theo annual eneral meeting for tihe election of president and oflicors. IHeo made a humourous appeal to the members as free arl independent olectors, to put tho right man in the right plaeo. lie reminded them of the annual subscription, and requested tho managing, .committee to meet on teo MInuday night previous to the annual meeting.-The question for doeiate was--" Is the theatre conducive to nationial morality ?" --3Ir.John M'Keacio opened in support of thre affirmative. IHe laid down the principle that no moral in. jury is attached to merely witnessing the reprosoenttions of historical charactors or evonts. It is one method of relaxation, affording rational amusement. Like 'any other mode of unbending the mind, it could be abused, and may be carried too far. But we lshould distinguish between legitimate rational amusement and son suous indulgence. Bearing this distino tion in mind, tho theatre was eapablo of representations conduoivo to high intellectual culture, and to national morality. Low subjects he dismissed as injurious. Ma'n is so constituted that evil will often attend his notiouse, but he can yet so bond his coursoe that an occasional relaxation of ithe mind will invigorate its power for good.. Writers for trhe stage have ad vaneced our literature, and in that class we shall meet with the finest writers,- thoe clearest'and mostrefined minds.: He concluded by.quoting a remark of tihe Roev. Dr. Watts on this question, coin oidingwihI hiis vinws.-- Mr. John Wilson argued ia favour of tire negativeo; arnd alluded to the attractions of theitheqtre, musio,. costume, scenery, tragedy, and comnedy. All that invites thire imagination is presented, though rmany good thiings are preserved in our modern stiag manngomouent. Mr. I'Kenzie had, ihe adiritted, made many just and pertinent remarlks; but he denied that thie general result was favourable to a natironalr in provermennt in mrorals. Referring to Slhakespearo as the leading authority of the modern theatre, he beautifully re. oitod some of his ehoico pieces, and gave the ghost seoone in "Haml't ;" but he argued. that even Shakosliore's .plays could not with propriety be road indrs oriminsaoely, espoecially by yonag ladies Iruubc less, thelon, should they be brought to witness their performance on trhe stage. Without pronouncirng tie theatre to be imlroral, ire held that it was hot conrducive to national morality IIo thon aIllutdd to MIr. Muacready, and rthe to. plinenute he had received for his advano. irg thioe theatro to a high morarl elevation -Lord Lytton paying Mr. Macroady tire ligihest enooiriumiia yet Lprd Lytton himself afterwards, in tihe judgment of a very acute critic, deioralisod the dramar in his "Ladly of l sjr" and another work. He (MIr. Wi'on) ranked mrcdern plays and novels in to same class :they were too Iighly sosatioal, and tire tendoeney was itijur us rather than bonefloiial to na.sfnal morality. Mr. William Boyd ?'nd MIr. John Clontlo inclined to favou tihe negativo.-Mr. \William Cook had pysonal oexporionce of tire theatre. He adtpred the soooery tire beauty.of thie la ies-and the arsnso mont of the play; nd hlid always got value for his money laughter); but irhe would reserve his opi oin on tie question for thie voto,--Mr. tdwin 0antlo lookedi tri the theatre sirmpl# as a mode of amuso mont-innooent in itself, and in this res poet oonducivo to publio morality. Tlihe writiings of Shakespearo had, ire oonsi dterod, a roiting tendency, and:cons0. quontly a bonefioialr moral effect.
