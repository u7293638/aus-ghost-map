Poetry. A PATHETIC BALLAD. From Mr. Hood's new series of Whims and Oddities. 'Twas in the middle of the night, To sleep young William tried, When Mary's ghost came stealing in, And stood at his bed-side. O William dear! O William dear! My rest eternal ceases; Alas! my everlasting peace Is broken into pieces! I thought the last of all my cares Would end with my last minute; But though I went to my long home, I didn't stay long in it. The body snatchers they have come, And made a snatch at me; It's very hard them kind of men Won't let a body be. You thought that I was buried deep, Quite decent like and chary, But from her grave in Mary-Bone They've come and boned your Mary. The arm that used to take your arm Is took to Dr. Vyse; And both my legs are gone to walk The hospital at Guy's. I vow'd that you should have my hand, But fate gives us denial; You'll find it there, at Dr. Bell's, In spirits and a phial. As for my feet, the little feet, You used to call so pretty, There's one, I know, in Bedford Row, The t'other's in the city. I can't tell where my head is gone, But Doctor Carpus can; As for my trunk, it's all pack'd up To go by Pickford's van. I wish you'd go to Mr. P. And save me such a ride; I don't half like the outside place, They've took for my inside. The cock it crows--I must be gone! My William we must part! But I'll be your's in death, although Sir Astley has my heart. Don't go to weep upon my grave, And think that there I be; They haven't left an atom there, Of my anatomie.
