Original Poetry. [FOR THE BATHURST FREE PRESS.] SCENES IN THE ANCIENT TERRA INCOGNITA, SINCE CONVERTED INTO THE PROVINCE OF NEW BRUNSWICK, BRITISH AMERICA: OR SKETCHES OF INDIAN LIFE. BY WILLIAM M. LEGGETT, M. A. CANTO 9TH. Battle at the Place of Graves. New voices, as of busy Braves, Approach'd the precincts of the graves, And words were tauntingly express'd That woke the warrior in his breast-- "Within this memorable wood The Milicete encampment stood, And see! obsequious hands have been Providing rest* for Gooben's men! Could we, amid these heaps of stones, But find a clue of Oola's bones, His grinning skull, transfix'd, should be Rare sport for Nooel's company!" "Kerwhoop!" hot bursting from his heart Responsive, made the Micmacs start, And breaking limb and bending bush Announc'd a living warrior's rush! Anon that warrior halted near T' arrange his belt and battle gear, And now, his sleeping Braves among, He danc'd his dance and sang his song! " 'Tis Oola's ghost!" the menials cried And wildly dash'd from Nooel's side; While gaz'd that Chief with glassy eye And drew his blade half dubiously! " 'Tis Oola's self!" he proudly said,-- "Still living to avenge the dead, And tear the scalp from Nooel's head!" Two tomahawks in contact fell— Two knives were grasp'd with savage yell-- And front to front, each eager Chief Grappled, to make the struggle brief! Nooel was thrown and Oola's knee Bent on his broad breast heavily; For ere the victor scalp'd, he chose To banter thus his prince of foes— "Call for thy whelps, dog! for their ear Is heavy! or perchance they fear To venture where old Gooben's shade Bends to behold, while Oola's blade Inquires if Gooben's debt is paid! * * * * * * * * The Micmac's scalp was grimly slung O'er Gooben's grave, and Oola sung His Sire's innumerable scars Receiv'd in old victorious wars! "Kerwhoop!" he shouted--"Micmacs, here Hangs Nooel on the battle spear Of Oola! Come, and howl him here! Old Gooben's ghost disparts the cloud Of death, and almost laughs aloud!" (To be continued.)
