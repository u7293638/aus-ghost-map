ENTERTAINMNT AT TALLANGATTA The Tallangatta Amateur Musical and Dramatic Society held their first concert in the Court-house on Friday evening last. The hall was crammed, and money had to be refused at the doors. The concert was for the benefit of the Athenaeum, and the funds wore consider ably benefited. Much credit is due to Mr Perkins, the musical direc- tor, for the very creditable manner in which he had inaugurated the affair. Where all were good, it would be invidious to particularise; but praise is due to Messrs Bruton, Southern, and Hostin for the manner in which they performed their parts. Mr Hennessy, as interlocutor to the minstrels and in the principal part in " The Manager in a Fix," was inimitable. He and Bruton were the stars, not forgetting Mr W. Carkeek in the sailor's hornpipe. We have seen this gentleman dance a quarter of a cen tury ago, and must say that he mellows with time. M Charles Southern re ceived a well merited encore for "Jack's come home to- day," this number being especially good in enunciation and pathos. Amongst the centre-men in the minstrels honourable mention should be credited to Messrs Shinnig, Hostin, Banks and McGrath. In the sentimental portion Mr Henty, in get-up and rendition, was fairly good. ln "Old Jeff" Mr Bruton was perfection, the last verse having to be repeated. It is sufi cliont to say that the accompanists were Messrs Perkins (piano)and l Fortes:ue (violin). As fonello mclurotors, Wallie Dyring, Tom Ballard, and eWm. Spil,::no iwori'uo'ed. ,rThe part of thes ghost was well rendered by George Ballard, both in theo' " tragicsomii '': sketch a of :" The .ilcho and thie Ghost." in conjunctibn with Messrs .Ballard ancd HEosth, and in. -"ThTe Minnage:in a Fix."
