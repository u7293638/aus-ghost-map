REPLY TO "A LUTEISRAN." (TO THE EDITOR OF TIM HOR9SI9 TIYXE.) Sr,-I was much pleased to find in your issue of this morning, a letter from " A Lutheran" re Â£20 reward for the discovery of Scriptural authority for "baby baptism." Lutheran' has scarcely done justice to my letter.' A pesitive command is not insisted on; an approved example or necessary inference is, according to the letter, sufficient to claim the reward. Lutheran acknowledgesihte command is not there, but he says "the meaning is," and then adds, "If it was not God's will that baoies should be b:iptized why'does he say, Matt. xxviii-19," '.Go ye into the world and baptize all nations:' "A Lutheran" advises me to study my Bible. I have several translations of that Book; I have also the original, but in none of these is such passage to be found. Perhaps some of the gentle men who sprinkle babies might help him. It is a serious matter to do, that "in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," for whikch there is not the slightest author ity.' So serious that' should not like to face the responai'ility in that,day in which He will judge the world in Righteousness, Acts xvii-31' In my study of the Bible I have .met with such passages, as Deut. iv-2 Prov. xxx 6; Rev. xxii-15, ,18, 19. Read and learn.-Iam, etc., HENRY HILLIAR, Evangelist, Church of Ohrist Horsham. November 3.
