THE CRITIC. Who can undaunted brave the Critic's rage ? Or note unmoved his mention in the Critic's page? Parade his errors in the public eye ? And Mother Grundys rage defy ? A popular 'Murcan fish—Dowey. Y.M.C.A. Oatts is pretty good at doling out sly chaff. * * * Little shopkeepers have to go. Hordern See says so. * * * Profits of poultry farming are pro- digious—to the poultry-pinchers. * * * Were the Kiama waterworks con- structed to drown the local ghost ? * * * The devil probably told Eve that apples were good for the complexion. * * * Wingham was an appropriate place to have brought down Jimmy Governor. * * * Why should a captured outlaw put the country to the expense of a " fair " trial ? * * * Last Sunday we had three Gover-. nors—Jimmy, Joe and Billy. Now we haven't one ! * * * Of all the Sees we ever saw, we never saw a See more far-seeing than John See sees. * * * Merry-go-rounds is the engrossing topic at all the Manly Council meetings. Phough ! * * * The plans of our forts were drawn by foreigners, yet we are denied any information of them. * * * Some of those rascals in the " divine-healing " fraud sadly want mortal " toe-ing." * * * If your neighbor's dog is noctur- nally noisy, pelt him with Chinese bungers. Sure cure. * * * The police are asking the Govern- ment to assist in arresting their own Superannu-' ation Fund. * * * Jack Want has stuck to the strug- gling shopkeepers in the Early Closing tyranny like a brick. * * * Arcades straw-hat pushers are a pes- tilence on Saturday nights. Where's the " move on " bobby ? * * * Everybody said when Breelong Jimmy was captured—" Dashed good job the police didn't catch him." * * * Butcher boy " boots " German Charlie the second does his " consulting " in a backyard Elizabeth-street. * * * Rather lugubrious to feel that Jimmy Governor is being doctored and fattened1 up for Xmas slaughter, isn't it ? * * * Ask the crack rifle shots if you want to know anything about the cronk cart- ridges that come to this colony. * * * Thieves have a free field now that the police are picketed in proximity to every little suburban store in the evenings. * * * The friendly southerly buster seems to have forsaken us. Russell's prophecies have killed it. Where's our Inclement Wragge ? * * * 'Murican medico Weir Mitchell's " Autobiography of a Quack " is only fiction. TRUTH publishes facts far more extraordinary. . * * * The " War Cry " says the devil is sick because we send money out of the Colony that we badly need ourselves. Good old Nick ! * * * Two new Wesleyan Churches for Ryde district. Lord ! what's the matter with the Wesleyans there ? They must be a bad lot. * * * Real Society : The body politic. Sham Society : Obese old dames, and the kid-, gloved, frock-coated creatures who mess about them. * * * People may go crazy over the dis- tinguished " Bobs," but what about the crowd who have " broken their necks " for " Nosey Bobs ?" * * * Had there been any " information re- solved " business about Governor Jimmy the police would have made the customary " clever " capture. * * * The " S'merald," devotes nearly a column to some slobbery stuff about the Queen's singing lessons, and her relations with Signor Lablache. * * * Why are so many peelers engaged by night watching couples in the Domain, when there's so much practical police work awaiting attention ? * * * What right has Premier Lyne to make a distinction in favor of Manly and Coogee in the matter of Sunday trading in fruit and gingerbeer ? * * * Wonder did Jimmy Governor, with the gun shot in his back, feel as sore last Sunday as did Willie Governor, after he got his blister from TRUTH. The curious were striking matches on Joe Governor's dead feet at Singleton. That's : nothing. We've seen 'em struck alight on topers' noses. * * * In Western Kansas there is a boy preacher named De Merritt, 13 years of age, and it has become quite the fashion for young people to be married by him. * * * Another child has died under the treatment of old " German " Charlie Brugg- mann, and the coroner's jury has censured the parents for going to him. * * * The Public Services Board has un- earthed a fine old " tipping " game among the sea-pilots and ship-surveyors. They give it the misnomer of " gratuities." * * * The control a policeman has over a pint of beer when the Inspector is coming round the corner is simpIy marvellous. It's the trick of all disappearing tricks. * * * It was the trouble over the division of the Kelly Gang reward that brought about the Victorian Police Royal Commission, which turned the force inside out. * * * " Singleton was all agog when the body of Joe Governor was brought into the town on Thursday." The refrain of their song was : We don't kill a pig every day. * * * Tennants of the Strand shops would increase their turnover tenfold if they insisted on the Saturday night removal of the flash larri- kins who blockup both ends. * * * Magpie mugginses of maudlin senti- ment are everywhere mouthing their mulishness over Jimmy Governors " blood-money " going to Jack Wallace of Wingham. * * * Jimmy Governor's opinion of our police force : " They couldn't catch a podgy calf." Ye gods. Damned by a blackfellow ! Hide your heads, ye myrmidons. * * * The Boxers are not half as savage as our " push " larrikins. The former never touch their own color ; the latter are always " dealing it out " to white men. * * * Wax matches are responsible for more suicides, attempted suicides, and fatal and other poisoning cases in New Zealand and Sydney than all the drug poisons. * * * One afternoon tea of the committee of the Metropolitan Charities Association cost £8 6s 8d, yet people wanting bread were scattered all over Sydney. Shame ! * * * Is it a fact that when General French offered his services for South Africa, Premier Lyne received a cable from Chamberlain refus- ing to have French on any account ? * * * The amending of, or rather the addi- tions to, the Medical Practitioners Bill will fairly squash the quicks. Fancy putting their correct name to the advertisements ! * * * Electric tram drivers, or any other tram people, don't require the nursing that E. M. Clark would give them. They must be pre- pared to face a bit of weather at times. * * * A drive around the harbor at the water's edge would be the most delightful drive in the world, and a nominal toll would soon pay the cost of resumption and road-making. * * * This colony has always been a dumping ground for rotten ammunition. Ten years ago at the Paddington Rifle Range, loads of cartridges were destroyed as worthless. * * * Some parsons regard with repug- nance the charging of a marriage fee—they leave it to the bridegroom. There are parsonical points about that lovely bit of self-denial. * * * Because the Government refuses to grease the pockets of haughty Holmes, the " Sewage " Board won't pay the clerk who did the soldjah's work while he was in Safrica. * * * Advt. " S'merald."—" Wanted, two waiters accustomed to picnics. Apply, etc." Why not give some of out " crack " coppers who were hunting the Governors a chance ? * * * Italian organ-grinders lament : Seller de fruit—maker de five pond—buyer de horgon—getter de monkey—monkey die—loser de horgan—loser de fruit—loser de haberyting ! * * * Why don't the police prosecute German Charlie for giving a diphtheric child belladonna pilules. The poisons Act prohibits the old fraud from using belladonna in any form. * * * Austria has presented a claim to the British Government for an indemnity for the Austrians who have been expelled from the Transvaal by the high-handed military autho- rities. The heaven for animals must surely be somewhere near Cooma, as 28 scholars at the Superior Public School there have won prizes for essays the prevention of cruelty to animals. * * * The Chows have been having high jinks in the Masonic Hall lately. " The Critic " tried to find out the meaning of it all, but failed. Can it be rehearsals for Commonwealth Cele- brations ? * * * TRUTH regrets, for one reason, that the police didn't capture the starved aboriginal. There'd have been such a rumpus over the re- ward that a Royal Commission would have been inevitable. The cigarette-smoking straw-hatted cubs who infest the Pitt-street end of the Strand on Saturday nights lose no opportunity to ogle . and gibe the girls, irrespective of loose and respectable. * * * " The Quack does as he stateth in Sydney within the wide acquiesence of public credulity." Thus the Delirious Tremensograph. Yes, but be has always had the help of the D.T. or he couldn't. * * * Bootmakers owe a debt of gratitude to the Waverley Council.mPedestrians, to avoid the discomfort of walking on footpaths with a sensation of peas in their boots, take to the roads in preference. * * * " Who is that frightfully fat woman, with the wig and pimply face ?" "Oh, that's Madame Faker, the inventor of Faker's Anti- Fat, Faker's Hair Restorer, and Faker's Perfect; Complexion Producer." * * * Wearing out the cars on the steam tram lines is certain to lead to accident—per- haps serious too. The rims of the little wheels on the cars are worn as thin as paper. A wheel broke recently at Bondi. * * * Detectives and constables who were sworn friends before the final scene in the Kelly Gang hunt, never spoke with one another after-, wards. There was such awful jealousy over the division of the " blood money." * * * Mr, Corruthers has received word from Chamberlain that Queen Victoria is not disposed at present to take on the title " Queen of Australia." Her Majesty is satisfied with England and Empress of India. * * * Of what value is a ship surveyor who would take a tip of £8 in connection with his work ? It's been going on for 18 years without the knowledge of the Authorities. Shocking state of shipping business ? * * * The people of Blayney are about to place a brass tablet in their Town Hall in honor of the Showman Soldier and his desperate defence of Mafeking. Brass is a fitting material: to use, being emblematic of his cheek. * * * Parents who patronise an old humbug like Parramatta German Charlie deserve to lose, their children, and ought to be punished by the law as well. Neglect in going to a proper medical man is another form of murder. * * * It's the duty of the Government to resume all the harbor frontages at the price of the original sum paid by the owner. Nothing should be given for " improvements " consider- ing the use they have had of the water, etc. * * * A great deal of anxiety is being felt for Jimmy Governor's health. Some ghouls are worrying lest he should die of his wounds and starvation, and thus escape being violently jerked into eternity. Kind Christian souls. * * * It wasn't champagne and the moun- tain air which stalled off " Lost Manhood " from Sir Henry Parkes, as most politicians be- lieve. It was diced tomatoes piled up with sugar. The old man revelled in this form of food. * * * The first " hard case, yer wash'up," for the newly-established Farmfield Inebriates' Home, opened by the London County Council, was a woman named Lizzie Dutch, who had been convicted for drunkenness no less than 52 times. * * * It is stated that the sore-eared " Germaniac " Bill, having a presentiment of being predestined to share the fate of Dago- land's late Humbert, perpetually carries a revolver. The Kaiser also carries a huge " rat." * * * The " Herald," in a recent issue gravely reported in its shipping news that a black funnel had passed Green Cape. Some time ago in the same column the same journal announced that a " bugger " had passed Tweed Heads. * * * Carruthers is evidently making a bold bid for a title with his ridiculous " Queen of Australia " proposal. A simple knighthood is not likely to satisfy him. He will want to be created Marquis of Salisbury Court or Earl of Armidale ! * * * Sir Henry Parkes did for "Tiger- Slayer " Jimmy against Copeland 11 years ago in the Armidale contest, that which Inglas has just done for Marsh against McMahon at Uralla —made a mess of it. Jimmy didn't get there ; neither did Marsh. * * * Tai Sawon's infant son died at Rewa (Fiji) on October 8 last. The body was interred among the bones of Ua Gam Ua Gio, the old Rewa chief whom the boy was named after. The mother is a neice of the late well- known King Kakabou. * * * Lyne deserves the thanks of the Licensed Victuallers' Association for putting the fossilised and moth-eaten Sunday closing law of Charles II. into operation. When the soft drink shops are closed the thirsty teetotaller will be forced into the pubs. * * * At a London Police Court an elec- tric tram conductor got two months' gaol for stealing 1d. At another court in the monster city a man was fined 20s for nearly belting the soul out of his wife. Oh ! propputy ! propputy! the fatman's penny propputy ! * * * Peace ! The Netherlands Women's League have issued an appeal to the women of America, begging them to petition the United States Government to intervene with a view to putting an end to the deplorable conflict in Safrica. God speed their petition ! * * * A disappointed manager of a tour- ing dramatic company made this announcement to his very small audience of three : " Ladies and gentlemen, as there is no one present, to- night's performance will not be performed, but it will be repeated to-morrow night." * * * When Sir Henry Parkes went to Armidale 11 years ago to fight for Jimmy Inglis and down Copeland, Sid Smith put two cases of tomatoes aboard the Premier's carriage, and the people on the platform wondered. But Sid knew the octogenarian's weakness. * * * Ex-Priest Slattery is pursuing his nefarious career in Brisbane now. The Golden ; West was too hot to hold him, and now Banana- land promises to become the same. At his meet- ing, bricks were thrown about, but no harm was done, only a couple of reporters being laid out. * * * " Le Petit Journal," Paris, says that the British in Africa painted Kaffirs white, and faced them to fight with the Tommies. Some French journalist has evidently dropped across an allusion to Chirgwin the " White-eyed Kaffir," and drawn his own ridiculous con- clusion. * * * Only three Australian swashbuck- lers in Rhodesia, have made application to the chartered brethren-in-boodle for grants of disease-stricken-soil on the feudal racket Rhodes' now disillusionised dupes at " the front " are cursing their folly in being in Safrica at all. * * * Discharged drunk (to copper) : Where's the bloomin' bottle of rum yer took off or me larst night ? Copper (indignantly) : Why, . ye blaggard, I emptid the areful muck on the the road to the stashin. Drunk (with a knowing look) : Yes, on the road to the station, down yer blanky throat ! * * * Railway Commiseioner David Kirk- caldie came from Glasgow in '76, and joined the . service as a porter. He was essentially a smart man and made rapid progress until attaining his present position. Like his colleague, Mr. Fehon, Davie is generally popular amongst railway employees. * * * It's a libel on our police force to say they are not keen observers. Who ever knew one to miss a drunk ? Our bobbies are a dashing Iot, and never known to funk— They'll 'scape all sorts of " pushes," but they never miss a drunk. * * * How is it that junior clerks in receipt of Iess than £125 per annum at Railway head- quarters are allowed first-class free passes on annual leave, while lads holding salaried posts " up the line " are only allowed second-class ? This flesh-and-fish business is often the cause of caustic comment. * * * Domain phrenologist Besemo has been giving his weekly decisions as to whether a man loves the ladies " too much or otherwise for about as long as George Perry has been bedamning the booze. The professor's pet precedent was the diagrammed bump of the late prolific procreator Parkes. * * * Dr. L. L. Smith (Melbourne) and Jimmy Inglis are champion yarn spinners, but L.L. is the racier of the two fakers. One of " Tiger's " best is that of the buffalo with a dead man firmly fastened on its horns. The weight of the rotting-carcase eventually maddened and killed the beast. Not too bad ! * * * According to the " Imparcial," of Madrid, the Municipality of Seville has put in force an ordinance for shaving the beard and scalp of boozers appearing in a state of inebriety in the public streets. Things would look pretty " cronk " in this city on Monday mornings if such a law were in force here. * * * A returned swaddie and member of the Braidwood police was " formally " welcomed back by the local Mayor with " a " glass of wine. Rather parsimonious, considering that most returned swaddies —let alone a thirsty copper !— are usually prepared to celebrate such an occa sion by " sinking " at least a cask of tangle. * * * At last there is a sensible sugges- tion re the Commonwealth Celebrations. Henry Harris proposes that all the unemployed and families who need boots and clothing should be so supplied, and work found for the males by setting them on improving our parks, gardens, telegraph poles, pillar boxes, and cleaning the streets. * * * The fears of the police that the Governors would be caught by the civi- lians have been realised. The police told many bushmen that if they continued the pur- suit independently of them, they would be sum. moned for what offence they did not say, but many were thus intimidated and gave up the pursuit. * * * The Yanks gave strict orders against looting in China. Yet 154 cases of ivory, pearl, jade and gold ornaments, costly silks, and idols taken from temples were sent by U.S. officers to friends at home by the ship Solace. Suppose there had been no prohibition against looting, how many cases would have been sent then. * * * During the Transvaal affair 265 British officers and 6931 men surrendered to the Boers. According to Kinglake, the his- torian, only 15 soldiers surrendered to the Russians during the Crimean War. In previous wars the surrender of unwounded fighting men was almost unknown. Napoleon has said there is only one honorable way of being taken prisoner, and that is when disabled. The excuse has been made that the deadliness of modern weapons has been responsible for this wholesale surrendering ; but then the Boors did not lay down their arms in the fashion of the 1000 officers and men at Nicholson's Nek. A Potts Point " lidy " astonished some of her guests at an " at home " by talking of the subscriptions she had sent to the " Society for the Promotion of Cruelty to Children." On another occasion, when in Melbourne, she said she would have to say good-bye to her friend, as she had come over on an " exertion " ticket, and it " perspired " next day. * * * A man named Birks succumbed to syncope at Gainsborough (Eng.), caused, by ex cessive consumption of delicacies. This sad case should act as a wholesome premonition to " Australia's noblest " and certain other nomadic trenchermen at present " doing a perish " in order to batten and fatten at the forthcoming Commonwealth celebrations. * * * At Albury, a constable disguised himself as a shearer and coaxed and persuaded a tobacconist named William Bray into laying a wager. Bray was fined £15. If police would turn their attention to the welshers on the various racecourses instead of men who havo fixed and permanent addresses, their work would be much more profitable. * * * Charles W. D. Goodchap proposes to have a bas-relief in gold of the Federal delegates, with the Duke of York in the centre, placed in the crown of the Speaker's chair of the Federal Parliament. As far as the delegates go, this proposal may be all right, but what has the Duke done for Australian Federation that he should be placed in the centre. * * * For courage S'renry knocked spots off the Tiger- slayer. When their coach was crossing the flooded creek between Armidale and Hillgrove during the Inglis-Copeland cam- paign, Inglis turned pale in the middle of the swollen stream, while the old man laughed and chaffed, fearless of the danger. The body of the coach was filled with boulders. * * * The Labor " Chronicle and Trades Union Reporter," the official organ of the Liverpool United Trades and Labor Council, has taken a plebiscite of its readers on the jus- tice or otherwise of the war in Safrica, with the result that 407 voted that the war is unjust, and. that it is waged in the interests of capitalism. Only seven voted in favor of the war. * * * Anarchists in Italy who have given vent to their approval of the fate of King Hum- bert are being arrested wholesale. It is calcu- lated that up to last month there were no fewer than 1200 persons in prison in consequence of the regicide. Acciarito, who made the second attack on Humbert's life, has gone mad. * * * Old B—— D ——, who used to de- light in jibing the coppers at Darlinghurst, at the most awe-inspiring moment, is still alive, notwithstanding. His favorite joke was to watch them " Fall in," and to yell out from his bal- cony : " Fall in," there, rorty peelers. Stand at ease ! Let down your breeches and look for fleas !" * * * Reports from Greece affirm that almost the entire crop of currants have been destroyed through the peronosperos blight, which has rotted the young grape. Many thousands of tons of currants are ruined. Consequently, prices in the country will advance as high as they did in '53, when the retail price was 1s 6d per lb. This is a bad outlook far plum-duffs. * * * Tasmanian Legislature is pushing through a Bill for the suppression of indecent advertisements, which not only deal with their publication in newspapers, handbills, posters, pictures, and inscriptions, but also their trans- mission through post- offices. If the coming Act is only drastically applied, there will assuredly be a big exodus of swindling charlatans from Vandemonia. * * * Apropos anarchist weapons : Presi- dent Cornot was stabbed whilst his carriage was moving at a slow pace through the streets of Lyons ; the Empress of Austria by a 6½in file ; while the murderers of Senor Canova and King Humbert both fired three shots at their victims in rapid succession. It is also remark- able that anarchists who attempt assassination are all young men. * * * Chivalry ! The Boer women in Jagerafontein who assisted the Boer commando in its recent attack on the town, have been re- moved to Cape Colony for punishment. Cannot the ladies who send presents to the " busted " Barnum-Ghoul in order to get a letter from the adored baldy benedict, show some form of practical sympathy with their Spartan-like sister's in affliction. * * * Ireland within the last fifty years has been denuded by landlordism of more than half her virile and gifted sons ; while the high lands of Scotland have been reduced, chiefly by English nimrods, to a condition of almost primeval savagery. And worst of all is the fate of the hapless English peasant out of whom the soul, if not the life, has seemingly been squeezed altogether. * * * Those of our deluded Jingo workers who roared " Remember Majuba !" were ostensibly oblivious of their own troubles in our own capitalistic war of '91. There were some queer things said and done when they them- selves were threatened with the mailed fist of local capitalism, now itching to clasp the obscene clutches of Chamberlain to receive the tinsel reward of Pecksnifflan " loyalty." * * * The Mayor of Grafton has suggested the institution of penny subscription lists amongst school children to defray the cost of a suitable monument over the grave of the late statesman Parkes. A more befitting way of perpetuating the G.O.M.'s memory would be far some of the political toadies who grovelled to him during his lifetime to inaugurate a " quid " subscription for the purpose amongst them- selves. The incidents in connection with the shooting of Joe Governor are slightly thrill- ing as compared with Jimmy's capture. Joe might easily have been taken alive had Mr. Wilkinson jumped on him, but there was the fear that the blackfellow was enjoying a slumber with " one eye open." You want to be very fly with the blacks at any time. * * * What with one advantage and another, the late Professor Thorold Rogers, tho noted authority on work and wages, held that the agricultural laborer of the 15th century had, in the currency of to- day, the equivalent of £145 per annum ; whereas, according to the report just issued by the Board of Trade, his modern representative is reduced to about £40 in Eng- land and £26 in Ireland ! How we do progress. * * * Long Lyne is mightily pleased at the 1000 Imperial troops coming out to grace our Commonwealth celebrations. Hr is not sure but what the citizens wi!I have to pay the - expenses ; but that doesn't matter as long as Sir William, who dearly loves anything Hing- lish, is saiisfied. Would it not be better to give the scrub-cutters decent wages than to provide a pack of Imperial troops with a nice little holiday. * * * Arising out of party disturbances in Portadown (Ireland), there is a novel strike in several linen-weaving factories there. A depu- tation of Protestant workers waited upon the two chief employers, and demanded the dismissal, of a number of Catholic workers who supplied . the police with the names of stone-throwers amongst them. The bosses refusing to comply between 400 and 600 men and girls immediately' ' struck work. * * * A religions maniac in London, named Frederick Ellen, after keeping his little daughter out of bed until 1 a.m. to learn a long Bible lesson, nearly belted the soul out of her body because she failed to accomplish the task. He was duly brought before the " beak " and after his conduct had been scathingly criticised, - was bound over in recognizances of £20 to be of good behavior for 12 months. A dose of his own medicine would have been a more appropriate punishment. * * * Judge Heydon's decision in the case of Dr. Ludwik Bernstein's pro-Boer advocacy will doubtless afford intense gratification to silly Jingoes. Avowed Republicans in the public service have expressed worse " disloyal " senti ments than those attributed to this medico, whose Dutch cognomen probably proved. moro detrimental to his interests than his utterances. It's only grovelling Jingoes " having axes to grind "'who will blast a man's reputation and prospects in life over such paltry peccadilloes. - * * * The humors of pro-gore Jingoism ! A burgoo-eating crowd, who had been collected by the greedy, grasping landlords and Tories of --. Scotland to waft and wither Dr. Clark out of his seat in the House of Commons, sang " at him " " RuIe Brrtannia," and afterwards the well-known song praising England's most deter-. / mined foe, William Wallace. This was about as stupidly incongruous as a lot of evicted Hibernian " tinnints " warbling " Gord Sive Hour - - Grashous " alternately versed with "Pathrick'asJ Day." * * * Billie Bigchump could do much for democracy if he were sincere, resolute, and denuded himself of his damnable supercilious# ' nose. Under present conditions his cant upon the subject is accepted like a big-bug Bible- puncher's sermon to a purse- proud push of par - venus on Christ's teachings. " Nobody in so—ciety could evah think far one momink of his or her neighbor practically carrying them out." This caste of humanity only organise their " charitable " fakes either to advertise their businesses or their immodest bosoms and backs. * * * TO A " REV." BIGOT (Who thinks newsboys and " sich " should refrain :-- from amusement on Sundays). 'Mongst all foul beings of fair, smiling earth, A bigot like to thee, sir, seems the foulest ; Why look'st with hate-lit eyes on harmless mirth , And upon innocent amusement scowlest. Thou stirrest up such malice, strife, and evil, That surely thine inspirer is the Devil. Christ, Our Dear Lord, in ages long-ago, Hurled, with high scorn, against thy tribe accursed Most awful words of warning and of woe. And yet, despite God's awesome words, thou durst Not less, even within His holy place, Kneel, roll thine eyes, and pray with blushless face ! O, Reverend Stiggins, think'st thou these poor boys, Newspaper selling till long after dark, Dwelling in squalid Slumlaud, which destroys In their soured souls childhood's divine spark, Take harm because for once in their sad life Joy's golden sunbeam shines across the strife ? The Sabbath Day—it was not meant to be A day of solemn faces and of sadness, But as a time when all, from toll set free, Might pass the house in sinless mirth and gladness ; And by their happiness give God more praise Than all the prayers (?) each bigot black out- brays. " The boys should be at kirk," you groan aloud ; Well, as the saying hath it," We should smile," To imagine them in rags amongst the crowd Of worshippers within your sacred pile. Why, bless my soul ! your well-clad congregation Would think to sit near them a degradation. Now, why the deuce, hard-hearted Pharisee, Don't you, and brother bigots, 'stead of skiting, Go forth to fight against the misery Which in these poor lads' lives is real and biting ? Go then, as did'st thy Master, 'mongst the lowl y ; Not keep thy ministry for rich folks wholly. —J. G. D.
