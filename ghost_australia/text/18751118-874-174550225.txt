HARRY VANE'S REVENGE. sOE A DOG'S TALE. BY Fitzroy Gardens' chaste domain, Dwelt Lucy, lovely maid, Who oft with handsome Harry Vane Glode through each slyvan glade. And Cupid's flowery pathway through They blissfully had jogged, But Lucy had a poodle who Poor Harry's footsteps dogged. Whene'er Jip saw the love-sick swain, To yelp he would begin; And Harry soon found out with pain That barking barked his shin. For love, he bore it in good part, And gaily tried to laugh; Would speak about his bleeding heart. While Jip was at his calf. So tilings went on, time sped away, And'these young folks were wed; When Lucy missed her Jip one day, And bitter tears she shed. That day and all the next she sought); She went distraught almost, When midnight to her damp eyes brought A curly poodle's ghost. Her blood ran cold; her cheek grew pale, She started up in bed; While Jip, he wagged his ghostly tail, And mournfully he said : " Let grief your brow no longer shade, I've been with you since tea— You liked that meal—then learn, dear maid, Them sausages was me!
