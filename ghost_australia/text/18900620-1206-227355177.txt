THE CARRAJUNG LINE. Oh, Pioneers of Carrajung, Farmers of Gor- mandale, Join your uplifted voices in a universal wail. For honor trampled under foot, for promises forgot, For members' oily gammon, and soft election rot. We thought that we might trust the man when our voices sweet were wooed. Who told us, if he sold us, he hoped he'd be pursued By nightmares black as Hades, and that ghosts of broken faith Might haunt him like black Banshees to a promise-breaker's death. So we believed the bunkum, and we put the mimber in, And we thought our railway surely would be made through thick and thin. And we passed by another, who'd religion teach in schools, And we generally proved ourselves a darned lot of fools. And now we're left lamenting, for our rail- way is non est, And our markets still are distant as the regions of the blest, And the mimber's oily gammon has beat the record far,â€” By the Holy Roman Pontiff, 'tis ashamed of him we are.
