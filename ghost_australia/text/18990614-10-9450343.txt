IN THE OLD BURYING GROUND AT CALCUTTA. this darK, weed-grown wilderness, Where are the dead of yesterday, There sleeps a warrior Englishman A servant of John Company" Who, are the reckless countrymen Snatched from the reeking tiger jaws The fateful prize of empire, Laid down his life, and saw no more of Ills home in leafy Somerset. ' Though one of that stern fellowship That unremembered chivalry Whose onset shook the sovereignties And world-old Powers of Hindostan, Yet oft in marching to and fro His heart, grown sad unwittingly, Had whispered of the Severn boat; And in the moon-blanched minarets Had shown, by wistful alchemy, The tower four-square upon the hill, Bi'at grey by all the winds of Heaven, . Whose five sweet bells on Sabbath morns Make music when the village folk Come up In hushed societies, Through lanes of ancient silences, And primrose ll obscurities, To worship God in Somerset. Now Iles he here, dead utterly, His name by some unchronicled, And passed from love and memory ; For dead his warrior comrades arc, And dead his friends in Somerset. Yet still, methinks, half-vvonderingly, Amidst the multitudinous Grey ghosts that throng the Ganges bank, Attaining through the centuries The promised palm of nothingness, He stands a pure, stern sentinel ; To God, to England loyal still, And to himself, as well becomes A gentleman of Somerset. . W. G. HOLE, Spectator.
