OB I GIN A t P O'E'T B. Y;'"" (From the Age.) " TRISTEAJC D'AGUNHA." ' Twas bul a ragged wave beat rock, "M TTphesved frcm ocean's bed by shock Of fierce volcanic fire and throe, "With clond clapped peaks of virgin now. From its ricky bvrrea hills, Towards ocean flowed s thousand rills, Yet sign of life none could discern By lofty cliff or trickling burn, Save some few restless sea birds, drove Byftsmpest fierce, or power of love, Around each jutting craig to soar, Amid the av^ry surfs loud roar ; With plumage glancing ghastly white In cave3 a3 dark as blackened night. Calm wis the sea, at rest each gale. And idly flappi"g hang each sail, As gazing o'er that deWafe strand We joyed again to view firm la -d. Bright sh ne the sun and tinged the snow, With evening's rcsy maiden glo v, While w»ves in ripplets kissed the t *ch, And murmured eottly o'er each r- v. Night fell, in silence like the tomb, And wrapped the icene in mirky gloom While ghosts of shipwrecked men uprose An l plaintive poured forth all their ?woes. Along that and sad elf-lit shore Dead women lifeless children bore, While fearful beings, not of earth. Their hellish revels held with mirth, And called the wrads to teat again, The terrors of the racing mcin. We rocked, we ro'l i. we a«iftly Bped From that ead is'and of the desd, And marked the; lightning's lurid glare, The sea-bird dazzle iu hiB lair ; "When on the shrouds of our ^out barque Things shone like meteo, _ in the dirk. We hastened on before the gale With creaking mute and straining sail, Till far beyond that hateful shore The winds oar ship in pity bore. W. O. H.
