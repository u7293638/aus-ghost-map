" AIRLEY'S GHOST." Is continuation of the anniversary celebra tion of the North Ipswich Congregational Church (special services in connection with which were held on Sunday) a recital from the Christmas Carol--" Marley's Ghost," one of the most popular works of that famous English author, Charles Dickens, was given last even ing by the Rev. J. hairn. The building was crowded to the doors, a fact which must have been gratifying alike to the rev,. gentleman and to the authorities of the church. At 8 o'clock punctually, without any preliminaries, the rev. gentleman commenced his recital. His representation of the several characters depicted in that eplendid Christmas tale, with its excellent moral, met with the full approval of the audience, who frequently lustily applauded, and at times broke out into hearty laughter, called forth by the reciter's impersonation of the quotesque subjects of the story. For nearly two hours the attention of the audience was riveted upon the lecturer, who certainly displayed a remark able power of memory. At the conclusion of the recital the iev. T. Jones expressed a hope that the result of the entertainment would be to arouse a more sympathetic and charitable feeling in the hearts of those who had had the pleasure of being present. He then proposed a vote of thanks to the Rev. J. Kairn, which was seconded by the Rev. L. Hudson, and was carried with hearty acclamation. The Hev. J. Nairn having acknowledged the compliment, the proceedings then terminated.
