?-: « A CREATURE OF THE NIGHT ' : BY FERGUS HUME. THIS is yet another of this author's' sensational tales. They strike one as something like an anachronism, but there is a section of the reading or shall we say, travelling ? ?- public whose taste they suit, or we should not see them displayed on all the railway stalls. This < Italian enigma ' has a very full bill of horrors-ghosts, a haunted palace, a beautiful Countess who isa ' nyctalopyst ' (which being interpreted means one who can see in the dark like a cat !), and whose little amusement it is to poison people ; and a cynical Márchese who is not afraid to marry this ' phantom of Luorezia Borgia/ There is plenty of intermittent love- making, the antidote to the poison always turns up in the nick of time, the lover plays the role of a new Lazarus with great éclat j and pur beautiful Countess has to face Nemesis ; so, on the whole, we think lovers of sensationalism may consider they have had a very good shilling'sworth.
