THE CYCLORAMA. The morning, afternoon, and evening ses- <*> sions at the Cyclorama were all largely attended on Monday, and the public interest in the wonderfully realistic picture of the Battle of Waterloo shows no sign of abating. Mr. Lookley'e illustrative lecture is listened to daily with the greatest attention, while the musical effects under the direction of "?«•. Dennis Keenan leave nothing to be desired. A novel and striking innovation In tia entertainment was introduced on Mon day evening, when the ghost of Napo leon appeared apoo the scene of tbe famous battlefield. At the conclusion of Mr. Lookiey's lecture the lights were turned down, and presently from the surrounding gloom tbe figure of the defeated Emperor stood out before the onlookers, clad in the costume familiarised by his piotures, and gazing with melancholy visage upon the scene of the great struggle. The effect was extremely good, and its repetition to- night will doubtless attract another crowded attendance.
