MESSRS. MOODY AND SANKEY. (FROM HIS Serum REVIEW) It appears that for some months past much excitement has been produced in Edinburgh and other towns in Scotland by the singular exercises of a couple of itinerant Americans Mr. Moody and Mr. Sankey Tor a very long time no entertainment has been so popular in Edinburgh as that which goes by the name of these gentlemen It is attended by overflowing audiences Crowds of enthusiasts follow the performers from one place to another, for it is part of their system to have as much variety as possible and to hold their meetings in all sorts of different buildings-in town halls, lecture rooms, and churches of all denominations The meetings are held at all hours of the day, and some are for young men, some for mothers, some for fathers others for young women, clerks, students, or little children Curiosity is stimulated by huge placards on the walls, and several periodicals command a large sale by describing the performances The nature of the exhibition is stated in the following announcement -' At half-past It p in Mr Moody will preach the Gospel, and air Sankey will sing the Gospel Mr. Moody and Mr. Sankey are Among ms from Chicago and we learn from one of their groans that their visit to Scotland was prompted by a feeling that the churches there stood "ape dally in need of the application of those brisker, livelier, more direct modes of appeal which are characteristic of America ' Mr Moody, we are further told, is " not a man of much education or culture his manner is abrupt and blunt , his speech bristled with Americanisms , his voice is sharp, rapid, and colloquial " He is remarkable for his want of Banctnnoniouaneas and "play of humour spurts out sometimes in his most serious ad dresses ' He interlards his lectures with droll or wonderful stones, or, as the writer puts it he has in his possession a large number of incidents and experiences well fitted to throw light on the points he employs them to elucidate and to clinch the appeals which he uses them to enforce " In the inter alia of Mr Moody's lectures Mr Sankey sings hymns ' Abhorring the notion of providing a musical entertainment merely to please those who are not in the kingdom of God, he seeks to move " by truth expressed in the most winning tones ' It is also ' in subservience to spiritual ends that Mr Sankey uses the harmonium ' Sankey a ' Sacred Solo are sold by the thousand and his example and exhortations are also said to have given a great impulse to the trade in harmoniums The sort of entertainment which is thus presented may be gathered from the descriptions given by persons who profess to have enjoyed it " We are having a very good time just now," writes one old Formality has got his neck broken On Friday night,' says another, after Mr Moody's solemn word there seemed to be a great smashing up of souls The audience is alternately moved to laughter and tears the Gospel is preached not only with the pronunciation, but in the dialect of Chicago and the result is no doubt something very different from that to which Scotch congrega- tions are accustomed voices Blnng stories and sensational exclaim mons are freely interspersed Mr Moody s strange accents and spurts of humour work up the people into a state of excitement in which it is as easy to cry and laugh A parable translated into the language of Artemus Ward and enlivened by touches of Yankee Reef is a novel sensation and the effect is enhanced byaauddenchatif-O to startling threats of damnation and appeals to come and be saved Then comes Sankey s lived solo,

enter tainment quite as good in its way as the Christy Minstrels Others of an irrepressible temperament are thrown into more or less violent paroxysm of hysterical emotion Those who are acquainted with the history of Revivals will recognise in the agitation which has been carried on in 1 Edinburgh and elsewhere a repetition, in a slightly modified form, of the ordinary type of these disorders there are difierentmothodsof getting ton cased, and tina 18 one of them Nothing is easier than for a skilled and daring export of revivalism to work upon the nerves and fool ings of weak, susceptible persons, so as to throw the blood to the head, and bring on all the symptoms of violent excitement One of Mr Moody's disciples boa designated him the ' Lightning Minister of the Lightning City, "and there can be no doubt that his performance is of a very rousing kind In common revivals there shouting and shrieking answer the purposes of the operators, but Mr. Moody a exercises are of a more artistic quality. 1 nonda of the movement, mingled with the audience, also lend their aid They pounce upon anyone who seems to be moved, and pour In their exhortations and there are also private rooms to which cases of distress are conveyed "About 40," says one account, confessed that they were now converts, and about 40 stood up as anxious to be saved, and were called to go to the other side of the hall, where they were concerned, with A servant girl is described as weeping like an inundation The " workers in attendance on her had to keep her constantly supplied with a change of fresh handkerchiefs and dry hymn books Another time Mr Moody called upon seven gentlemen on the platform how they were Saved "Most of them were well known men, a minister, a colonel in the army, a merchant a sheriff, a doctor a nobleman, and a captain in the navy. The effect was marvellous " Prayers were offered up for an "uncle who is an infidel " for a family, the father avowed model, and the mother and children unconverted," for a clergyman of the Church of Ireland who is imbued with rationalistic errors." At one of the meetings the experiences of a young lady were given as part of the entertainment. For an hour she sat in the greatest agony , her hands were clasped her eye balls looked as if they would start from their sockets. ' Even children are worked upon little children of eight or nine-with all the terrifying formula of the revivalist school A little boy illustrated his faith by remarking that if his sister received an offer of marriage from a very rich man who had promised she should live in a line mansion would she not be very foolish to refuse such an offer ' At one meeting we are told of a dear little boy about nine years of age at most 10 who was crying as if his little heart would break while a kindly father like man was torturing the 1 poor child with things too deep for him to understand Me lead of a book which was sent to another child containing three leaves -one white the next blood red and the third white indicating salvation You can't have too much blood is Moody s motto It is said to be too soon to estimate, the results of the agitation which has been carried on by these expedients but it is not very difficult to anticipate what judging from former experience they are likely to be It is impossible to imagine anything more unwholesome and debilitating than the sort of morbid excitement and hysterical rapture which is the s cultivated, and in other cases the consequence has invariably been a reaction of a deplorable kind in the country districts of Scotland revivals have usually left their mark man increase of drunkenness and a scandalous addition to the registrar general s statistics of illegitimacy In Edinburgh the boat and frenzy have probably done much harm by bringing sacred things into ridicule by afflicting some feeble minds with idle agony or by ov erb dancing others) with the inflation of self righteous arrogance and conceit There is not the faintest trace of educated intelligence or spiritual elevation in Mr Moody 8 harangues They are a mere gabble of texts interspersed with grotesque or sensational anecdotes and spiced with v ulgar American slang the most extraordinary feature of the agitation is that it should be coming on at and i patronised by the clergy of Edinburgh and other towns It is obvious that if Moody and Sankey are right in their mode of A reaching the Gospel and if the success of these performances is really a great awakening and the power of the Holy Ghost in Scotland the ordinary services of religion must be a melancholy fat ce Everybody who has been in Scot- land must have been struck with the severe endurance and fortitude with which a Scotch congregation Bits out not only a long and dreary sermon but a series of prayers which are the worst sort of sermons in distress and it is not surprising that the Scotch laity should be thankful for a little relaxation But that the ministers themselves should come for was in this manner to proclaim publicly that their whole system is a failure and waste of time is really strange It must be still more we wonderful if m suppor int and recommending Messrs Moody and Sankey, they do not see that they are condemning themselves 1 Utter a great awakening is good for their flocks or it is not If it is, why do they not take measures to bring it about on their own account The only justification which is offered for the eccentricities and buffoonery of the Yankee propaganda is Bimi ly that the end justifies the, means and that the great thing is to produce an impression on the public mind no matter how it would appear therefore that Her mons had better be abandoned for Binguie and story telling and there is no logical reason why the reform should stop here The banjo and the bones might be substituted for the harmonium and Mr S inkey s solos might be occasionally varied by a little dancing IheFantccI lip flags change would be an a. separate accompaniment to Mr Moody, a spurts of humour and select anecdotes If it is to be understood that it is the business of Christian churches to compete as the lintuJi _i.aH9cfi.f- holds with the theatre the opera and panto mime who is the tom] station left to these American gentlemen ' It is stated that Messrs. Moody and Sankey may shortly be expected in London but they will perhaps discover that their line of business has already been pretty well worked at the Tabernacle and elsewhere
