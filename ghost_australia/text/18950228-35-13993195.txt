MR. MOLESWORTH THINKS SIR GEORGE DIBBS'S CHANCE IS HOPELESS. Mr. Molesworth, when asked what he thought of the situation, said the notice of motion had taken the supporters of the Government by surprise. The motion was not anticipated generally by the Government following. Sir George Dibbs, he said, could not have chosen a better time for the Government than the present. He thought the motion was premature, as it was most ridiculous for the leader of the Opposition to fire his shot before the target was up. '' It is pretty well known," said Mr. Molesworth, " that the ranks of the Opposition are very weak and disorganised, and a large number of the followers of the Opposition party are inclined to vote with the Government on some of their proposals, notably the Local Government Bill and land taxation. Until the Government had clearly laid down its programme before the House and the country the Opposition is acting unwisely in attempting to force a motion of censure at this early period of the session, I don't think Sir George Dibbs has the ghost of a chance of winning."
