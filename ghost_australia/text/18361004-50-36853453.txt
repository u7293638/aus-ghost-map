To the Editor of the Australian, I SIR.t— If you think the insertion of the t-llowing in your sporting Journal acceptable b your sporting readers; ' it 'will oblige the lmtcry|fr- , ? . ?? A novel wager came off yesterday on the Race Course, which for its eccentricity I wish iad been made more public beforehand, as it - must undoubtedly have drawn a suitable con course of spectators.' A gentleman of the Emerald Isle lately arrived from our land of potatoes, the Sister Colony, made a wager with ?' mine host' of the Cricketers, the father of that mnnly sport in the Colony, that he would beat him in a majority' of 'games, Cricketing being one allowed, and the dispu tants each to chose ono other game The i'atlander having been accustomed to crossing bogs, choBe jumping in a sack, while 'mine host,' being a man of more speculative turn of mind, chose a cool game of ' all fours.' The batting as well hs fielding of' mine host,' bsing aupcrcxcellent, left tiic unit of the Irish System not a ' ghost of a chance' with his ? antagonist. For the very same reason ' mine host' was nt once floored in the sack. The decisive game being now about to be plnyed, and stools and an empty packing case being provided for the occasion, ' mine host' pro ceeded to Bhufllo the cards himself; as many of the few byeBtunders were betting largely on the result — when. Oh ! direful catastrophe, a Hidden gust of wind dispersed the pack, and carried the ' Knavo of C1u.ub,' which ' mino host' BweniB wns tho turn-up card, to- the ipire of St James' Church, where it still re s mnined when I last saw it. What makes tho n\ iccident still more to bo regretted is, that it t wns an express stipulation tho cards should h hot be exchanged, so that the wager still remains undecided, alnough many hund'eds are still awaiting- the result.
