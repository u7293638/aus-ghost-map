"No, I shall not leave you," was her quiet answler.

In all his life, he nhad never, ihe thought, looked upon a handIsoneur face.

She clung to him and trembled, biut her black eyes watched the moving stone, and sahe uttered no word or cry. " Iloavens hbove I" ojaculated Sir Harry, holding his compalnion still closer.
