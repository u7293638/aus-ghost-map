To the Editor of the Tasmanian and Review. ____MR. EDITOR,—In the present struggle for power by the " Bishop" and his followers, it is worthy of remark that one great ground of objection made by " My-Lord" (the exquisite folly of which designation you have so thoroughly exhibited,) to Lord Glenelg's excellent plan of " open to all" education is, that the children of Roman Catholics and Protestants would thereby be brought into close communion with each other. It becomes a subject of something more than curiosity what is the difference between the two Churches. There high Tory Episcopalians frequently speak of the Church of Rome as if they considered the Church of England perfectly free from the corruption of Popery. We have often been surprised at their want of information or honesty. Our present object is to shew that these hierarchies are very much alike. ____By the Romish Church, we shall not here understand those Catholic societies which are supported by voluntary contributions as in Ireland ; but Popery, maintained by a coercive taxation as in several continental nations, and by the Church of England, that denomination which is established by law in this country. We cheerfully admit, that there are several points of difference between these churches, to the advantage of the English hierarchy— while it must be conceded that there are in-s consistencie in the latter communion, which are not discovered in the Church of Rome. __It should be universally known, that in the year 1689 a committee composed of ten Bishops and twenty other pious and learned dignitaries of the Church of England, made 600 correc- tions in the prayer book, articles, and canons of the establishment ; but which were not adopted through the influence of certain bigotted parties in the British Parliament. __In drawing up the following parallels, our object is not to irritate the ministers or members of the establishment, whose condition we sincerely pity—but to expose those errors of their system which require amend- ment, and which most pious and intelligent churchmen deplore in common with ourselves. __The subsequent remarks will shew that the Puritans had better grounds for their exer- tions to purify the church than most Episco- palians are willing to admit—and that, if we would be rid of the corruptions of Popery, there must be a second Reformation of the Church of England, greater than the first. __As no intelligent person will question the truth of our assertions, it will not be requisite to refer to proofs for their confirmation. A few prefatory observations may not be un- suitable.— __1.—That the Prayer-book contains little beside the Mass-book translated into Englsh. __2.—That the Pope offered to confirm it, if the Church of England would join that of Rome. __3.—That Episcopal Clergymen of eminence have declared such a union of the two Churches practicable. __4.—That the efficacy of Episcopal ordination is derived entirely through the Popish Pre- lates __5.—That at the accession of Elizabeth, 9211 Catholic Priests, out of 9400, joined the Church of England. __6.—That the Papists and Protestants long worshipped together in the English Church. __7.—That at the Reformation, Parliament transferred the entire powers exercised by the Pope in this country, to Henry VIII. and his royal successors. ____________PARALLELS. __I.—Both Churches were constructed by human wisdom and established by national laws, which law6 became the rule of conduct and the object of ultimate appeal, both to priests and people. The New Testament is not by the rule or law of Episcopalians, or Catholics, as such. __II.—Both have visible and human heads, who decree all rites and ceremonies, and exercise absolute authority in controversies of faith, demanding implicit obedience to their commands, whether agreeable to Jesus Christ or not. __III.—Both are supported by a coercive taxation—Tithes, Rates, Dues, and Parlia-y mentar Grants. Nothing is left to the zeal, charity, or piety of the people. They can withhold nothing from the most unworthy Clergyman. __V.—Both systems impose Ministers on their congregations, and very frequently the most unsuitable and incompetent—depriving the people of their reasonable and Christian privileges. __V.—Both traffic in the souls of men. Bene-, fices involving the cure of souls, are bought and sold in the market by auction, equally with chariots, horses, or any other pro- perty. __VI —Both have settled forms of prayer, unalterable liturgies, articles of faith of human composition, to which all parties must sub- scribe. Nothing is left to the skill, piety, or devotion of the Clergy. An ability to read is all that is essential. __VII.—Both have long grades of offices, with titles and powers unknown to the New Testament—Archbishops, Bishops, Chancel- lors, Prebendaries, Canons, Deans, &c.; almost without end. __VIII.—Both make high pretences to super- natural powers. The Bishops pretend to confer the Holy Ghost on the persons they ordain ; and all the Clergy pretend to absolve men from all their sins upon a dying bed. __IX.—Both consider baptism a real genera- tion; by their ceremony the subjects are made members of Christ, the children of God, and heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven. They alike employ sponsors, and use the sign of the cross. __X.—Both perform a ceremony of confirma- tion ; in which the Bishop tells the young people (whatever be their moral character) that they were regenerated by the Holy Ghost at their baptism, and assures them of the favour of God. __XI.—Both awfully pervert the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Priests administer it at an altar to kneeling, and often ungodly, com-s. municants. One Church calls it " transub- stantiation ;" the other, in the Homilies, " a marvellous incorporation." __XII.—Both have displayed a cruel and per- secuting spirit—anathematizing or excommu- nicating (to the loss of character, property, and liberty) those who do not rigidly conform. (See first twelve Canons.) They have alike put thousands of dissentients to death. __XIII.—Both are peculiarly sectarian, treat- ing non-conformists with contempt ; confining their central, infant, and other schools, col- leges, and charities, to their own parties ; and inculcating sectarianism with the utmost as- siduity. __XIV.—Both systems tend to make Ministers haughty, avaricious, and petulant—fre- quently produce strife between pastor and people—introduce idle and ungodly men—and protect their vices. __XV.—Both churches, with untenable creeds, and minutely defined rubrics, with vows and solemn asservations, tolerate every wild notion and heresy in existence, and produce a body of hypocrites. __XVI.—Both are upheld by the secular arm, fear, ignorance, avarice, and corruption, by denouncing the loss of business, reputation, and even salvation, on seceders while pro- figates are seldom marked men. __XVII.—Both treat all, their conforming pa- rishioners alike, whether good, bad, or indif- ferent. The same words are addressed to all ; the same ceremonies performed by all, there is " no difference between the unclean and the clean." __XVIII.—Both have a great deal of form and ceremony in their worship—standing, sitting, kneeling, bowing, turning towards the altar, dresses, &c.; ; all calculated to afford ignorant persons a ground of hope and confidence in their own performances. __XIX.—Both attach extravagant and un- christian notions of sanctity to their places of worship—their clerical habits, titles, and mi-l nisteria performances ; their character is in- delibly sacred, their churches holy ; their doings alone efficacious. __XX.—-Both enjoin the religious observance of numerous holy days every year, in com- memoration of some of the most profligate and tyrannical beings that ever existed. The English hierarchy has appointed (independent of Sundays) ninety-five fast days ana thirty- one days of feasting. __XXI.—Both churches, either by unction or words, or by both, professedly send all their people to heaven ; bless God for taking the most impenitent wretch to himself ; and com- mit his body to the dust, in sure and certain hope of a resurrection to eternal life. __In a word, both systems are unscriptural, and have sadly failed to answer the end for which millions of money are annually expend- ed, and for tvhich the Son of God introduced his Gospel into the world. __It is a question of some difficulty, whether the Church of England be really and truly entitled to the appellation of Protestant. That it it is the least reformed of all Protestant churches, must be admitted. __Consequently, the sooner these hierarchies are reformed and assimilated to the model of the earliest churches, the better. Let every member of them put his shoulder to the wheel, without hesitation or fear.—Yours, &c.; ________________________A DISSENTER.
