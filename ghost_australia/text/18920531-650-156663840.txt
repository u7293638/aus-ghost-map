A Haunted House. On Saturday, at the Central Court, Syduoy, a gentle and enquiring plumber of the name of Samuel Pile was fined ?10s. for being on the premises of Mr. P. Young, in Pynnout, and maliciously smashing window panes. The prosecutor, whom, it is suspected, has been reading Stead's ghost book, stated that tho house was supposed to be haunted, and passers by were in the habit of yelling wildly 'Bring out Deeming.' The groom at tho establishment swore that Pile mean dered aimlessly into the yard, and wished to reconnoitre for ghosts. The groom objected, on the grounds that the ghosts were in a delicate slate of health, and became rowdy when disturbed. Pike the inquisitive was not to bo put olf, how ever, and became abusive, aud finally, after using language of the most tropical nature, proceeded to slam liis walking stick through the ground-floor windows, knock down flower-pots, and make tliiugs b'lui generally, until rotnoved by force.
