The address touched upon the education question, and in the course of his reply the archbishop said that as their address alluded to the difficulty of maintaining schools in sparsely) populated districts, he would tell them that it had been in his mind for some time to ask those who were in a position to do to help materially in forming a diocesan fund to assist the poor and scattered districts in maintaining their schools, and they might rely on him to lend all the support he could to the project He concluded by thanking those who had with much self denial contributed to the welcome he had received A number of Chinese arrived yesterday in the steamship Pathan. Some of them were transhipped from the ss 'Tasman at Sydney. Of the 52 who came here yesterday, 35 had legitimate naturalisation papers.

The Bankers Institute of Australasia will hold their next meeting on W Wednesday evening Mr Edmund Jowett will deliver a lecture, entitled " Low prices and the appreciation of gold how are they caused, and are they likely to last'" The subject is one on which there is a diversity of opinion among those regarded as authorities, and the discussion by members is likely to be and mated. Between 70 and 30 new members will be balloted for at the conclusion of the meeting During the last three months over 200 new members have joined the institute, Efforts have been made lately to gain the co-operation of bankers in Sydney with satisfactory results The banks there have subscribed to the library fund, and many of their officers have enrolled as members One of the rooms of the institute, above the City of Melbourne Bank, is now elegantly furnished as a drawing-room. This attention to their comfort is appreciated by the members, and the daily attendance of readers is much improved.

The first of a series of portraits of Australasian bunkers is promised with the next number "Our earliest Ancestors and their Beliefs" was the subject of an interesting and well studied lecture which was delivered by Professor Tucker on Friday evening last at the Elsternwick Presbyterian Church The Rev J. Hay) occupied the chair, and there was a good attendance Beginning with a sketch of the life and thought of the Indo Europeans, our earliest ancestors us revealed by the study of language, the lecturer dealt with the constitution of religions, and pointed out how all over the world there was found a regular development in beliefs, commencing with the worship of the souls of ancestors, with Staschen and magic, and passing on to the worship of the powers and phenomena of nature. It was from the explanations which were seriously gil co of these powers of nature that myths arose among the Indo European races, and Professor Tucker showed, by several curious illustrations, that many remnants of those early myths and superstitions still survived among us A cordial vote of thanks was passed to the lecturer. The Brunswick tramway was opened for traffic on Saturday, and was well patronised At an early hour a mishap occurred which caused two short delays in shunting a car at the Flinders street terminus one of the engineers failed to release the gripper of his car and the result was that a strand of the cable became separated and fouled a pulley The cable was stopped whilst the strand was temporarily spliced an 1 again when the fractured part came into the engine house in order that it might be permanently repaired The excessive vehicle traffic in Elizabeth street consequent on the Hunt Club races at I lemington tested the watchfulness and coolness of the officials engaged at the crossings more particularly 11 Bourke street They were assisted by four constables and acquitted themselves so creditably that no n mishap occurred there.
