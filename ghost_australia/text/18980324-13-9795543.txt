By that time, moreover, about 4,000 miles of raihvay will be open for traffic; and to say that the raihvay means development Is almost needless. Altogether, Avlien at the beginning of the year 1!)00 the whole of the fair mainland and the isles of .Tupan become accessible to tim world, It AVIU be quite reasonable to look for a considerable exptuislou of commercial Intercourse. But in what direction will this Inter- course grotvV AVill .Tapan oust Euro- pean nations from the markets of the East bj- .successful competition iu manufactures? Or will she increase the export of AVhat Ave may call lier indigenous products? Will she, in short, strive to roach the lfigh goal placed before lier in the sentence Avilit Avhich Ave commenced this article-the magnifying ol' Japan's name iu the world by commercial development-by allowing the industry of the people to follow its OAvii bent, or by wasteful efforts to acclimatise exotics? That .Tapan is fast becoming ti manufactur- ing country is undoubted. It is also true that manufacturing Industries aro necessary lor its teeming population. But, in the opinion of competent ob- servers, tile puce lias not only been unduly forced, but has boen In some mensuro directed into channels of doubtful permanent value. This was largely to be expected AVIICU an enter- prising, Intelligent, and artistic people -full to the brim, moreover, Avith self confldenee- suddenly determined Hint they could accomplish anything pos- sible to Europeans. lu ndopting various kinds of manufacturing industries, they at llrst produced excellent articles. But the Japanese manufac- turer reckons that business is business, nnd that If a high standard of excel- lence is Incompatible willi profit the standard'must go. The result is that tliero is a universal tletorlorntiou of quality, and this, combined with the inveterate dishonesty of the mer- chants, is arresting the growtli of the export trade iii manufactures. The fondness of Japan for producing .unirions Imitations of labels, trade marks, &c;, is also telling ndversely. Uutil, as Mr. Brenan puts it in his report, it can be brought home to the Japanese manufacturers themselves that honesty pays in the long run, their wares ?will always be received wit li distrust. The rate of manufactur- ing development is also being retarded by oue of the consequences, and pos- sibly the best, of the great outburst of industrial activity. It Is the rapid rise In wages, wlilcli are already 50 per cent, higher than they used to be. The cost of living is also rising, but the not result is a great Improvement in the standard of comfort and luxury enjoyed by the mass of Hie people. .. ?While Japan Is not likely to become a formidable rival of European coun- tries in the export of manufactures for whick she possesses no special nd A-nntagcs, yet in other directions her commerce is bound to grow. Japan has unreservedly joined the comity of nations, and her large, Industrious, and clover population, fervently imbued AVitli the desire to accomplish great things in the domain of peace, is destined to take an actiA'e part In inter- national Intercourse. Australia will Anti it necessary to consider.carefully her position Avith .1 power which is emulous of becomlug the Britain of the Fuclil. Ocean.
