THE BENDIGO GHOST SCARE. AMATEUR DETECTIVE ARRESTED. BENDIGO, Tuesday. The ghost scare, which has been the local sensation of the past week, has led to a youth named Eugene George Johnson being placed in an awkward predicament to- night. Johnson's mother had been fright- ened, and, imbued with a desire to prevent a repetition, he sallied forth after dark at- tired in an old dress and armed with an iron bar, prepared to lure the masquerader into showing himself. Johnson's appear- ance attracted attention, and someone, ap- parently with little sympathy for his mis- sion, handed him over to the police, and he was locked up on a charge of behaving in an insulting manner. He was shortly after- wards bailed out. There was an extraordinary scene out- side the city watchhouse during Johnson's detention, large crowds of people having rushed from all quarters, under the belief that the "ghost" had been caught. Though the proceedings of the last night or two should have effectually stopped the offender, the scare still continues, and the police are keeping a close watch.
