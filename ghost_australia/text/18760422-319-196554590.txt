SRiCT PG£TBY« THE miH OF QABES. (Faoii ' Tnn Datih Christmas op 1874'— A POEM, BY IiiJUY PrEIPFEH.) Hold by thc hands ci tho children, hard woriicr and sage, \- let them lead iho round, For a moment tha soul of their joy may your torment assuage, J J Caoght at tho bound ; Ana when wears of leaping, and laughter, and shrin delight, iu uie pmo-woou DIazo Draw closer, ana whisper ol piant, d cnomo, or of ? Jmigut, OJt ghosts or of fays ; Fill tbe children with magic and moonshine, with wonderment, Or with high eraprize : Fool them with fancy and fear to the top ot their bent, Through their ears, through their eyes ; For the child fcj simple, and thinko thero muat luib behind The World nnd itfl crtintrn. & mystery, haply a meaning, tho trace ol some mind, Or ol many ; who knows? So tho creaturo that knows bo little, and feels so much, IastirrMbyatbrill, When it Bees that thc things which sccn» dead to the sight, and tho touch, Are moved aa by will. To tho child, unlearn'd as simple, tho leap into life Of the infant year, Is a man-el as great as the fables of any ? old wiic,' Prophet, or eeer; So it wolcomea the shiftiest talo if it only profeaa To account for a part Of the wonder which 'weighs down tho world, and begiua now to press On ita innocent heart. Let him think ha may catch behind Naturo a ehadowy Cause, Tellhim not alltcfi know ! Lest, closed in a fortress of fact and mechanical laws, He should leave off to grow. For the spirit is nourish'd by wonder, by faith, and by love,— Things aa dreamy as high ; And I think nono have over been forward their life to disprove Till beginning to die.'
