Hill drew attention to a paper read by Min Mia at a recent social science congreea on ths subject of “Moral teaching in schools."' It' was shown tbal special-moral teaching was not only of great import ■ance, but that it could bo made thoroughlyintereaticj to the young. It was urged that the imigimtioa nj the proper' medium through which ethical trail should be conveyed to children’s misda. Within help reading lessons might be rendered ittnciiTid impreisive. Ths need that existed of practical, me ful, interesting, and amusing books, and (hilts greatsr heed of earnest and efficient (whin, was''warmly insisted upon. It:ms miintiiud '•that a teacher’s main endeavor should he to nub young people acquainted with the lam and order it \- the moral world, so that they might have a vivid pir ception of ths position which they occupied hit Hi I (Mr Hill) thoroughly endorsed those vim Tin nil results of instructing the intellect and leavio; lb imagination uncultured were everywhere leen. Tbi; were seen in the low slang, the want of inject hr age, and in ths vulgar larrikimam that wore *o unirir sally prevalent, and in the decay of public tub in (ha shape of many of our' moat popular till trical and music-hall entertainment,.

That education left the heart untouched, the moral seme undmlopt and the character unformed, was little “ a mocker^,"a delusion, and a snare.” How ud tj what special means the objects sought tobaiclw’ could be beet helped forward would form, 0“ Hill, the subject of next Monday’s lecture.
