The New Woman in Court. The Judge — " Which is the plaintiff in this case?" The Plaintiff — " I am the plaintiff, your Honor." The Judge — " I thought the wife was the plaintiff ?" The Plaintiff — " I am the wife, your Honor." The Judge — "The dickens you are the plaintiff" I trust your Lordship entertains no prejudice against the habiliments of the New Woman." The Judge—" Me ! .Certainly not. At the same time I feel it my duty to inform you that you don't stand a ghost of a chance with this jury." The Plaintiff — "Why not, my Lord?" The Judge — "Because they are all married men." Shrill voice from the jury-box — " No, we aren't ! Four of us are married women !"
