Qu ^tting uear to the island onr stipppr made np his tuiud to lay off. aud see if he could get some cocoa nnts, yams, aud fruit of the natives. We did so, and had not waited long before there were about forty canoes find pirogues around us, filled with Malays. ?????. \\\re had strict orders not to allow a yiati ve. on bpar-J, so that when they |ried to iasten a line to the ship it was Jpcarnedmtely past off. Ti3e crew was armed with the ship's ^Duskets, and sratioued ready for a* ^rUrih bhould the natives pr^ve trouble fpmh. But after a great palaver with the pliiefs, through one of our crew, a native ol the island of 'Guam, it was o'eeidfd to, tend, t^o of our men ashore \n a pirogue and retain two chiefs as ^OStilueb. So Guam Frauk, as we called him, was told to make known to the chiefs ?^he captain's wishes. At first the natives refused to leave ^fheir chiefs on board, bui offered to allow tvfo of the' ordinary natives to regain, in their stead' ; but upon our ^hieateaiug to sail away they, gave in, saying, '??? Bargo no'«o I Bargo co.'go !' The two chiefs then came ou board, and Jthe ciptain called for : volunteers \a go. ashore. Guam Frank and 1 . signified our desire io do so, and we ?yt-re at Quce ordered fo get on to the outrigger of pne of the. largest ^lr^jg'pes. .The little boat soon started, and 1Way w« went, with nu immense I '|ateeu Bail lha:, in the stiff breeze |h^eii blowing, seemed to fairly lift the pirogue tiom the water. ;; ^ell, I havp ridden in wbale boats jasiened to a swiftly -svvimuiiug whale, V'ut th^,t was. cbihTs.-play to this. ?\5fhj, one. monient v(e. soared aloft jl^4i|& th/vtj i%e could, see .the deok of piijc sh.iu,. vxb,ti,e tli,e. next vie Vf»«ld \ ^woojVJO.w.nw.ard, u.util it seemed as if We siiouki be plunged bodily under the sea; but w.iih a graceful sweep, we ' 'W'juid be again carried skyward. These Milay pirogue are queerlj constructed boats. Bmlc of teat wood, they are very strong, and, although heavy, sail like $he,wind They have a platform about eight $eet 'square, rigged on the outer ends of two' tough-wood spars from ten to ^fteeii feet K-ng. This is the outrigger which counter balances, the power of the immense fail aud answers the purpose of : 1-aliast. It is . shifted from side to side accorliug to the tack the pirogue is ou, ^he outrigger always being to wind-, ward. We had a glorious ride; Iu about au hour we rmched the i;eef, and the pirogue seemed to fly over the smooth water inside. Boon the great lateen sail was lowered and furl d, the yard hoisted op clear of everybody's head, to ^educv- our speed, and then paddles \ took the; place or 6ails until we wer« ! ..anchored in front of a Malay village.

My hair- was long, white 1 had gold hoops to my ears, and this tudian beauty would ^rnh my h««-* in one hand and try to. steal the rings out of rny ears ?with the other. I saw that my only chance of escape was to : take ou*. the rings and present th-jm to iier j but when I had done so I was in a scrape indeed, for in a monient about » d--zen or more, jealous b^anties wanted earrings. When Frauk explained la them that I had na more they became fuviou6, while the nutive men laughed at and jeered them, aud in another minute I hadn't a shin an my back. f his was the climax^ Frauk warned, me, but my blood was up. I drew my sheath knife and jj»Tk.en' myself clear of rha crowd. But Frank just then caught my h«nds behind me, and said, ' For Heaven's sake mind what you are doi-jfj 5' He spolfp rapidly fo the natives, and the crowd «-f lun'shiuer men suddenly looked serious and motiouod the girl-1 away. With pnllfiii looks ihpy disappear- d among the foliage, whereiu were the native huts. . With my skin blistering in the sun we were led to a hnt, where, to the relief of our tired limbs, we found a heap of m»t6 made of grasses, ou which we were not long in seating ourselves. ? Frank then told me how ho had saved m« from gettiug iuto trouble. ' When 1 saw you draw your knife,' h« said, ' I expected the men to pounce upon you, 6O I yelled to them that if you were harmed their chiefs would be killed on board the ship. This calmed them at once.' We were left in peace for a tina* in our hut, and found upon examination ibat the door was fastened aud a guard placed outside. It was now nearly sundown, and night would drop like a curtain in a. short time, for eu, oi nearly on the Equator, darkness folio vya as the &un; sinks below the horizon. We were just thinking of taking a nau, as we concluded it would he impossible to iench the ship that night, when th» hut door opened and in walked a dozen young girls, half nude, bearing bananas, young cocoa nuts, a calabash of water, some small raw fish like smelts, and a whole roasted yam. They laughingly placed the food on the ground, thore being no Boor in the hut, aud calmly seated themselves close to it. We got up and pointed to tbe mats, whereupon they were greatly amused, on/l iiVarilr aaiA tltoir jtmilf) nnt appreciate our gallantry. ' Among these girls I espied the one to whom I had given the earrings. Frank, began talking with her, and I again ; became the target for the girl's fun. This time I did not show so ungjtllant a front. Frank began to tease me by saying the girl wanted to marry me, aud would not let. me leave the island. Pretty 6oon . the little beauty came and eat herself beside me, began cutting, bananas into squares and feeding me with them, aud insisted that I fehould eat the raw fish. Out of curiosity I trie-i onoof the fishes, but quickly ejected it. where upon the hut iairly rang with their jubilant -laughter. . This. brought to the door a coup'e of men, who spoke, as I thought, very sternly to the gills, and they at once went away, leaving with us a lot ol resinous torches such as the hut was already lit with. Just as the girls were leaving, the one that had my errings suddenly put her arms about my neck, aud ere I could prevent it I had received the kiss of a chiefs daughter. We were at' last alone, and, tired and sleepy, we lay down. I had a dream in which J was wandering about iu the forests of the island, when a fairy of beautiful form and face came and took rue by the hand and led me over rocks, through thick woods, and across mossy fields, until we steod beaide a pool of glass clear water. Pointing to the water she said — ' As that water so is my life. If you remain with me a life of blips will be yours. $Jo chief will rule you— * you shall be my king. Despise the love i offer and accursed shall your life be hereafter. For you may plan, bat your plans shall fail ; you may seek happiness, bpt' none shall you have ; you shall wish to die, but in vain ; you will cry out to me for peace, aud find it not , you will curse me, j but your curse will end iu a word of endearment ; my beauty will haunt you, but too late tor yon to find me. Stay aud he happy ; go aud my shadow will follow you.' A sharp slap from Frank, and, j Heaven above me ! there, standing in ? the doorway, was Etelie, Ahe M.Uay j maiden — ft tall, bands one Malay heside her— with a sad look ou her ♦a«V», at- if «Ue had . t-£eU appeali-n^ to j Frank observed that he thought 1 was going to, slfep, all d»iy.

Etflta was her father, a ohief, au^ the girl wanted him to buy me for her. I Jn«»i think of it 1 -wanted her papa j to buy me ! Well, I was not sold, but f it was hard to part with the lutlel beauty. | As no ship'*? boat had come in y t, I and the vessel lay off shore abon: fire i i miles, I took the opportunity aud ; s-lipped HWj»y with SteU*V aud we j wandered. a« I had dreamed, away! iuto |Ue wo xls, ?

By mean*; of signs Et-olle made me k»iow «h' wanted me to stay, Aud when we returned sh« pleaded with I Frauk to make me do. so.. | How I tuiv.i?d him that he eonld j fall; to hf r wlnle I must remain bnmb, Frank, to p;»cify her. tol(J Jier and her fath'-r ihat 1 could u-»t f.ay with, nut tlit* consent of my father, who. was also n ciiief. Heaven forgive him for his dpc- ption } He misled tl-« clnef and Etelle, and toi-i them tli^t I should leturo to her iu less thau a year to remain for ever. Poor girl, she believed him, tor I acquiesced iu all he said. And is it because of my deception that to this day her face is haunting on- ? In my dreams I see h«»r. Is it her curse that makes my plans all failures ? I am now a grey headed in»n, and fctill that sweet face is before me. I havu wished for death, hut death came not. L iugh if you lik«, it wiil not change tlese f»cts oue iota. My life has been a striigsle ever siDce that visit to Yap. I have faced Death twenty times, but he passes me by. Is there a fatality in that far-off dr^am ? Why is it that it seems only jester- : day that I left her, yet it is forty years ago. Why dc I feel a gentle hand on my head when I lay it ou my pillow at night ? j Why do I wake and see her sweet faee above me, aud try to reach it, but in vain ? . I am no spiritualist, nor do I believe in ghosts, but that there is an indefinable something that keeps uear me is not to be denied, for it is too real. If it happened but onoe or twice I could attribute it to optical illusion, but it has been with me for iorty : years. Who knows bow it will end ? About four bells in the afternoon our ship backed her rnaintopeail, and the canoes could be seeu surrounding j b*r again. j We wandered ab'ut th« shore a little way, when presently one of the canoes was beached close bv where we : stood. * ' ? j Frank interpreted what che natives j «aid. The canoe had come from the ship, and the . orders from the chiefs on board were that three loads of fruit were to be brought t» the vessel, while Frank aud myself were to accompany it. It did, not take long to load the fruit, aud when this was done came & \ lug oi war for me to did good-bye to Etelle. She chine about my neck, shirtless as I was, pressing her lips to niiue in an eestacy of grief, and I had fairly ta run for the canoe at the finish. We finally reached the ship, and the cliieis were set at liberty. I neut poor Etelle a present of thirty yards of calico, half a pound of b»a-is, aud a carved whale's to -th. and to her papa. 1 sent a pound »i tobacco and a i jack-knife. j Twice since that time I have been t in the neighbourhood oi Yap, but j never again landed thereon. I cannot close this true story with out one word in behalf of the natives of these lovely islands, the paradise of the Pacific. In 1848 the Caroline Islands, tbe Philippines, the Alulgr-wes, the !Sea- \ shells, tlie Pomqatus, the King's Mill { group* aud tuauy others, especially the 1 Society Island, were iu their glory, aud beauti'ul beyond dt- scriptioo. And why * Beeause the natives then ha-i hut little intercourse with white men lint their days are numbered. They, lik* the American Iudians, .will be driven from pillar to post until they become a thiug of the past, and the beauty of the I'acific isles will piles away as the white man advar* es.
