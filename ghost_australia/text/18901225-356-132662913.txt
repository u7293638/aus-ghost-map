Select Poetry. OLD MANUSCRIPTS. How faint and dim the written lines I penned in days ago! How little of the life remains Of their first overflow ! Unfinished poems, half-written tales, Stray leaves all incomplete, Fall round me from the long'clowed drawer, And rustle to my feet. And shall I take them to the flames, These fragment thoughts of mine ? They have been writ in earnest days, Their spirit haunts each line; Outworn enthusiasms speak From every faded leaf I read, and something clouds my eyes, A very wraith of grief. The ghost of a forgotten day Lurks in between each word, A hundred dreams too wild for speech, A thousand thoughts unheard. Conceptions all astlr for birth, soung buds in burst for flower, Now all too cold for memory To make them warm with power. Musing I think of scenes that lay About me as I wrote, So many tender hopes and fears And faiths around me float. I smell the perfume of a flower, See sunlight on the hills, Roam eucalyptus wattle wilds By bush-born summer rills. Something of each and all is here Pressed in between 'the leaves; A soft association sweet To the dim paper cleaves; And there is something o!eer still A subtle pain to lend The memory of an outlived trust And a forgiven friend. For thou wert with me in those days Of early vision keen, When life was all so rich and full, And hope so early seen.; Ere Fate had weakened nerve and brain, And uncongenial years Blurred all the bright:horizon lines Thro' disappointment's tears. Old manuscripts, I pay you by once more into the past, For sense and soul have grown so weak That tears are falling fast. What if my crippled pen no more May speak what I would say ? A bygone eloquence of song Must solace me to-day. JENNINGS CARMICHAEL
