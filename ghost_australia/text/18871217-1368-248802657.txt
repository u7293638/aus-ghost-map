The Haunted House at Hammersmith. Historical Novn, akd Also i Ghastly Caaisnug Ghost Sn>ar. BY LUKE SHARP. [Nora —The writer of this thrilling story desires to state that at the time it was written he had not read "The Upper Berth," or " Called Back," and so any similarity that may appear between this absorbing story and thoee II«1iiuihimJ «MttaW*<»« He also -wishes to say that h» had sot then heard of '* The Strange Cose of Dr. Jeykell and Mr, Hyde," and in fact, hits not yet heard of It; and, therefore, if Sue. Stevenson feela hurt because this story is so much better than the Jeykell yam, it is not the fault of the oversigned, but rather an inability on hispart to oonstmet a poor ifauy. It is hoped mat the several xeferenoes to thseea wiUnot be taken as an infringement of tie domain of Mr. W Clark Russell who so ably assists Britannia and Sir Joseph Foxier in ruling the dsim. In <vmr1nnion, the writer deaues to express his thanks to the late Dr. Johnson for valuable aid rendered by that little-known, and somewhat disconnected work, entitled, " A Dictionary of the Enfclinh Language."]
