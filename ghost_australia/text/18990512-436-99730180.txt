THE OUIO!^ IEL In Osaka is the famous temple Tennoji, the most remarkable part of which, to the weatern eye, is its bell tower, a two-storey Chinese-looking atructure, where there is a bell called the Indo-no-Kano, or Guiding Boll, because its sound is suppossd to guide the ghosts of children through the dark. Ruvh Tiftfnnrlio Hflnrn : — The lower chamber of the bell tower is fitted up as a chapel, and an I stopped before the entrance to observe the imaee in the .ahrine, I suddenly became aware of the unfamiliar, the astonishing. On shelves and aUnda at either side of the shrine, and above it and below it and beyond it, were ranged hundreds of children's mor tuary tablets, and with them thousands of toys — little horses and dogs and cows, and warriors and drums and trumpets and paste board armour and wooden swords, and dolls and kites, and masks, and monkeys, and models of boats, and baby tea-sets and baby ? furniture — toys modern and toys of a for gotten fashion, toys accumulated through centuries, toys of whole generations of dead children. From the ceiling and close to the entrance hung a heavy bell-rope , nearly four inches in diameter, and ot many colors — the rope of the Indo-no-Kano. And that rope was made of the bibs of dead children — yellow, blue, scarlet, purble bibs, and bibs of all Inter mediate shades. The ceiling itself was in visible, hidden by hundreds of tiny dresses suspended thera — the dresses of dead chil dren. Little boys and girls, kneeling or playing on the matting beaide tho priest, had brought toys with thorn to bo deposited in (ho chapel before the tablet of some lost brother or sister.1 Every moment some bereaved father or mother would come to the door, pull the bell-rope, throw somo copper money on the matting and make a prayor. Ench time the bell sounds some little ghost is believed to hear, perhaps evon to find its way back for one more look at loved toys and faces. Tho clanging of tho bell, the deep humming bf the priest's voice reciting tho service, the tinldo of falling coin, tho sweet, heavy smell of incenso, tho passionless, golden beauty of tho Buddha in his shrine, tho colored radiance of the toys, tho shadowing of the baby dresses, the variegated wonder of that boll-rope of bibs, the happy laughter of tho little fo'kn at play on tho floor — all made for in« an experi ence of weird pathos never to be forgottcni
