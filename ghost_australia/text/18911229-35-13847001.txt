I SQUATTERS PROSPECTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. SIR-The revaluation of pastoral leases will have the immediate attention of Mr Copeland and his assistants From a statement going the rounds of the press a large increase of revenue is expected from the addition intended on the annual rentals I have in a former letter pointed out the eagerness of inspectors and land boards to add to the supposed improved value of land. A few years ago, with wool at a remunerative price and Block easily disposed of the annual rental of a mile square block was 20s, or 14 per acre line on a run of 10,000 acres (one of the smallest) hold under lease would pay the Crown 162 10s per year, not a very bad rental But what is the result of the popular outcry against the squatter ? Why, that rents are trebled, quadrupled, and on the smaller conditional leasehold actually been expressed as high as Is j or acre, and flour Iel to lid is becoming a common charge Now, while all these ridiculous impositions are continued and encouraged, what income over those who are the piHsusaora of house and landed property 1 Is it not a fact that they have to reduce their rents in proportion as the Crown has risen the rental on its tender- t And has not the same tremendous fall in value of land 1 property happened in England also take tim list of houses to lot, of farms for sale, throughout the colony, and the terrible, distressed state of the squatting community What is there to justify the blood-sucking by increasing rents f Is there a man in our Parliament who will scarcely dare lift his voice on behalf of the persistently persecuted pastoralists It is almost as much as his seat would be worth to take part with this section of our colonists How is it if freehold property is gradually depreciating under the train; one is through which we are passing that this Land Department squeezing is going on until there will bouoithoi juice nor pulp left directly nothing but the bitter wind? Like the poor wretch under the instilled being beaten to make him " fork out "-" never mind his tears, they will clear his eyes to enable him to see the knout better So many members Bay by their actions Never mind the squatters' complaints, be careful now we have at last got him by the throat In fact, he is in a threefold grip Parliament, unionism, and the banks have him under powerful constriction, and if he does not succumb what vitality there must be in grass I If he does give up the ghost it will not be the first time in history that noisy rejoicing has pealed forth over the corpse of a great friend 1 It Mr Cope- land believes it is light and just with the great fight for existence going on among the pastoral tenants to add to their difficulties by increased rentals, then he is not the man I take him to be I ot him not be deluded by officers reports let him exercise his own discrimination, and judge for himself if it is a desirable thing to crush out those who find it difficult even now to pull throughly from year to year I am, &c.;, BELL WETHBB. American papers announce that at the recent funeral of the late King of the Sandwich Islands, among other music, a "Domino refugium," composed by the Queen Liliuokalani, well executed.
