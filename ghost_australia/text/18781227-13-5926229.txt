THE DISAGREEMENTS OF THE TWO HOUSES. In a recent debate in the Legislative As- sembly the Minister of Education stated that 87 bills had been rejected in 22 years by the Council and that they were " the cream of the measures" passed by the Lower House. An examination of the records of the several sessions from 1856- 7 to the present time shows that in reality the subjects of import- ance on which legislation was delayed by the action of the Council were few in number No accurate or intelligible return of the Assembly bills rejected by the Council seems to have ever been prepared for Parliament for the reason, doubtless that the orders made for the preparation of the returns have usually been loosely worded For instance there was the return obtained by Mr Macgregor in 1869 of bills passed by the Assembly but not assented to by the Council. It contains measures first introduced in the Council, eg, the Supreme Court Sittings Bills of 1857-8 and 1859 Also included in the list are a number of bills abandoned by the Government of the day in the Upper House, or simply negatived on account of the late date at which they came on for consideration say, just before the close of the session. Then, again, in the list may be found at least one bill the Waterworks Act Amendment Bill of 1864- 5 which was laid aside by the Assembly on account of the form of certain amend- ments of the Council but immediately re- introduced with the amendments, and passed through both Houses. This bill should not have been mentioned at all in the return In the subjoined account notice only will be taken of bills rejected by the Council or of bills lost in consequence of amendments by the Council and from it will be left out all private bills lost through an informality, like the Emerald-hill Bye-law Repeal Bill of 1859 60 SESSION OF 1856-7 This was the first session of Parliament under the new constitution No less than 44 bills became law The principal measures were the Audit Act, the Goldfields Manage- ment Act, the Railway Loan Act, the Main Trunk Line of Railway Act, One bill was reserved for the Royal assent The bills sent up from the As- sembly........................................................ 48 Passed by Council..........................43 Lost.................................................. 5 \- 48 The five bills negatived, or lost on account of amendments in the Council, were-1, Emi- ration; 2, Auctioneers; 3, Immigrants Law Amendment; 4, Crown Lands; State Aid to Religion 1\. The Emigration Bill not only provided for immigration, which was then carried on by commissioners, but established a colonial agency in London for general purposes The Colonial agency clauses were struck out by the Council, and the bill was lost. 2\. Auctioneers -This bill was left on the paper after a change of Government The new Government merely moved it pro forma, and allowed it to be negatived witbout discussion 3\. Immigrants Law Amendment -This was a bill to modify and alter the law under which Chinese were admitted It was referred by the Council to a select committee, and the final result was an entirely new measure- the Chinese Residents Bill - which both Houses accepted 4 Crown Lands Bill -This was the Haines bill. Though it passed the Assembly it was highly unpopular out of doors, and nume- rous petitions were presented to the Council from town populations to reject it 5\. State Aid to Religion - This was one of the few important subjects on which the Assembly was held in check for an extended period by the Council. Great doubt was en- tertained as to the real state of public opinion on the subject of state aid to religion for some years In 1859-60 the Abolition Bill was read a second time m the Council, but the Constitution Act required an absolute ma- jority and as the contents did not amount to that the bill was shelved. ln 1870 state aid was permanently abolished SESSION OF 1857-8 The principal bill of the session was one to provide for assessment on stock. The number assented to was 15, reserved 1 Bills from the Assembly...................................... 20 Passed ....................................16 Withdrawn in Council.................1 Lost............................................3 ........................................................................... 20 Three bills failed to pass the Council-1, Electoral Districts Alteration; 2 Road Dis- tricts Assessment; 3. Imprisonment for Debt Abolition 1\. Electoral Districts Alteration - A bill in- troduced to increase the number of members in the Assembly to 86 The House enlarged the number to 93 (for a population of 390,000 personal) Exception was taken in the Council both to the large increase and the mode of distribution Next session, and in the same year, both Houses assented to a bill to re- distribute the seats and increase the number of the Assembly from 60 to 78. The number of the Council remained 30-the present number 2\. This bill dealt only partially with local government and provided for a uniform assesment of road districts To force the Government to deal with the whole question of municipal government the bin was re- jected An amendment of the municipal law was made next session, and a general Local Government Act passed in 1862 3\. Abolition of Imprisonment for Debt - This subject was dealt with m 1865 SESSION OF 1858-9 The principal act of the session increased the number of members of the Assembly to 76 The Audit Act was amended, and a Chinese Bill passed The total number of bills assented to was 28; reserved three. Bills sent up from Assembly.................................. 33 Passed......................................... 29 Lost................................................ 4 \- 33 Four Assembly bills failed to pass, of which only one was of importance: -1, Gold- mining on Private Property; 2, Stock and Shares Execution; 3 Dog Act Extension; 4\. Spirit Dealers Registration 1\. This was the first bill to deal with mining on private property passed by the Assembly It was introduced by Mr Ireland (Solicitor General in the O'Shanassy Government), and, as stated by Mr Milles in the Upper House it was only intended to be temporary, because the Go- vernment promised to go into the whole matter at a future period- Hansard vol 4, p 914. The bill made legal all contracts entered into between freeholders and miners up to Nov ember, 1858. This was in Febru- ary 1859. The Council extended the time to November, 1859, and on account of this amendment the bill was abandoned by the Government It was not until 1872, or 13 years later, when the Francis Government were in office, that a second bill on this sub- ject was passed by the Assembly. One was introduced in 1861-2 by Mr Pope, but it never got beyond the preliminary stages. A bill was promised bv Mr Higinbotham, in 1864 but the deadlock arose shortly after- wards, and no more was heard of it SESSION OF 1859 60 No less than 28 bills were assented to this session 'The principal measure was the Nicholson Land Act which introduced the occupation licences and the system of de- ferred payments. The Divorce Bill and Pen- sions Bill were reserved for the Royal assent, and from the former the assent was with- held Bills sent up.................................................. 32 Passed...................................26 Lapsed.................................... 1 The number of bills lost was 6 but none were of any consequence 1, Lien (Contractors and Workmen's) 2, Insolvent Laws 3. Frauds on Creditors; 4, State aid to Religion, 5, Imprisonment for Debt 1\. Lien Bill -This was a bill to enable workmen to attach moneys due to con- tractors on non payment of wages. It w as in- troduced by a prvate member in 1860, and again in 1861, and finally passed in amended shape m 1870 2\. Insolvent Laws-Only an interim bill to provide for proof of debts in country places Next session a general revision of the Insolvent Laws took place. 3 A Bill for the Registration of Bills of Sale -Lost on account of an amendment. Passed in 1861-2 4 State aid Abolition -The second reading was carried by 13 votes to 9, 3 less than an absolute majority SESSION OF 1860-61 The number of measures passed w as 11. The Officials in Parliament Act:-still in operation-provided for the exclusion of contractors and place- hunters from the Legis lature The Divorce Act was assented to. Bills sent up from Assembly.................................. 20 Passed.................................................. 11 Lapsed 2, lost 7 .......................................9 \- 20 Bills lost - 1, Contractors and Workmen's Lien ; 2 Reduction of Governors Salary ; 3, State Aid Abolition ; 4 Payment of Members; 5 Abattoirs ; District Insolvents; 7, Gold Duty Repeal. 2 This bill cut the Governor's salary down from £15,000 to £7,500 A bill to reduce the amount to £10,000 passed next session. 4 A bill to provide for the payment of members was carried in the Assembly (76 members) by 22 votes to 10 It was rejected by the Council, and no bill on the subject was passed until 1870 7 This bill abolished the export duty of 2s 6d an ounce on gold Next session, by the consent of both Houses, the duty was reduced to 1s 6d , and abolished totally in 1866 SESSION OF 1861-2 The failure of the Land Act of 1859 -60, led to the resignation of the Nicholson Government The principal measure of the session was the Duffy Land Act It proved an utter failure, for an immense deal of land fell into the hands of squatters and speculators. On account of the outcry which ensued, selec- tion in the agricultural areas had to be stopped The O'Shannassy - Duffy Govern- ment went out of office in June, 1863, and were succeeded by the M'Culloch Govern- ment Bills sent up from Assembly......................... 35 Passed........................................ 31 Lapsed.......................................... 1 Lost............................................... 3 \- 35 Only three bills were lost in the Council. 1\. Barristers' Admission; 2, Divorce ; 3, Tax on Bank notes. 1\. The bill of a private member to alter the rules of the Supreme Court, which re- quired that students for the bar should not engage in trade, &c; 2\. Simply rejected, because the last bill had failed to receive the Royal assent 5\. A bill (about which the Government did not seem much in earnest) to impose a tax of 11/4 per cent (for two years) on bank notes, and thereby raise £20,000 The measure was said to be intended to make up the revenue lost by the reduction of the gold escort fees. A bank note tax was passed in 1875, as part of the financial scheme of the M'Culloch Go- vernment SESSION OF 1862 3 The M'Culloch Government came forward in the middle of 1863 with a bill to amend the Duffy Land Act It was proposed that 2,000,000 acres should be thrown open for selection in 640-acre blocks, that the first payment should be 5s , and that the balance (15s ) should be paid in instalments in six years {Hansard, vol 9,1,271) The Council condemned the bill as likely to perpetuate the evils created by the Dufty Act The breakdown of the last two experiments in land legislation made the Council reluc- tant to rush into new proposals Next session, a modification of the above bill was submitted The Council rejected the measure, and passed a resolution m favour of the auction system The M'Culloch Go- vernment announced that they would submit a policy to the country, and at the. end of the session Parliament was dissolved in ordi- nary course Bills sent up............................................. 35 Passed......................................26 Lapsed or withdrawn................. 6 Lost............................................. 3 \- 35 Bills lost - 1 Conveyancers. 2 Land Act Amendment. 3 M and H Railway Act Amendment. 1\. A bill to enable conveyances to become attorneys on certain special conditions 2 The effect of this measure is described above SESSION 1864 The time of Parliament w as largely taken up with the measures for the consolidation of statutes and a large number of consolidation bills was passed In all 44 bills were ac- sented to Bills sent up from Assembly..........................49 Passed......................................... 44 Lapsed or withdrawn...................... 2 Lost................................................. 3 \- 49 Bills lost - 1\. Land Act Amendment; 2. Electoral Act of 1863 Amendment; 3. Justices Laws Consolidation 1\. This measure has been referred to. 2\. A bill introduced in the Assembly by a private member (and opposed by the Go- vernment) to entitle holders of miners rights to be registered as electors for the Legislative Assembly in the same way as ratepayers. The bill was sent up too late to be considered. Next session it was submitted afresh under a new title, but in the Council no one would take charge of it miners were therefore left to take out electors rights in the same way as other non ratepayers. In the session of 1864-5, the electoral acts were consoli- dated 3\. The Council introduced some new clauses into the Justices Laws Consolidation Bill, which the Assembly would not accept, because it had been laid down as a principle that no amendments should be made in con- solidation bills likely to create a difference of opinion Mr Fellows, in the Council, held that the bill waa not a consolidation measure. (Vol X,481 ) The day before the session closed a conference was agreed to but it brought up no report Next session a bill to consolidate the Justices Laws was passed SESSION OF 1864-5 Bills sent up................................................ 67 Passed...................................... 54 Withdrawn and re introduced...... 4 Laid aside.................................... 1 Lost.............................................. 8 -67 A large proportion of the bills passed were consolidation bills The first measure on the list, however, was the Land Act of 1862 Amendment Act. The country had been ap- pealed to, and the Government came down with an amendment bill which provided for selection to the extent of 640 acres, payment, as purchase money, of rent at the rate of 2s an acre for 10 years,&c.; The selector had to effect certain improvements (as evidence of bona fides) in the first two years and before he obtained a lease. In 1869 an entirely new Crown Lands Act was passed. lt permitted selection all over the colony, in blocks of not more than 320 acres, a proba- tionary licence (which required residence and improvements) for three years, followed by a lease for seven years, or a Crown grant. This measure, with some comparatively slight modifications, is still in force. In 1872 the Government brought in a bill to increase the maximum area of selection to 640 acres. The bill was rejected by the Council, and the Assemby itself has since refused to increase the area beyond 320 acres. In 1878, the period of probation and the term of the lease were extended and provision also made for selection, under extra conditions by non- residents The Justices Consolidation Act (lost in the previous session) was passed in this session In this session the first deadlock arose. The Assembly embodied a bill for the imposi- tion of a protective tariff as well as for the repeal of the gold duty m tho annual Ap- propriation Bill because it was assumed that the Council would reject the tariff if sent up in the ordinary way. The Council laid aside the Appropriation-cum.Tariff Bill on the ground that it amounted to an attack upon its independence. The Government sent up the protective tariff and the Gold Duty Re- peal Bill in one measure which was also re- jected, and the Government would not send up an Appropriation Bill but paid on the votes of the Assembly by means of an ar- rangement with the London Chartered Bank. A dissolution then took place on the issue of free trade or protection resulting in the re- turn of a majority of members in favour of the latter principle Next year both the pro- tective tarriff and the Appropriation Bills were passed in seperate measures Bills lost: - 1\. Registration Act; 2. Audit Law Consoli- dation; 3. Hospital Law Consolidation; 4, Supreme Court Law Consolidation; 5. Con- stitution Acts Consolidation; 6. Interpreta- tion of Acts Amendment; 7, Mercantile In- struments and Securities; 8, Payment of Members .(The Appropriation-cum. Tariff Bill was laid aside as described above). 1\. This was the private bill of the previous session to provide for the registration of the holders of miners rights as electors. 2\. Audit Act -The 28th clause of the Land Act of 1862 appropriated a sum of money annually for immigration A provision in this bill stated that appropriations not ex- pended in the course of the year for which they were granted should lapse The Council passed an amendment to exempt the immi- tration fund from this provision. There were doubts as to whether the Audit Bill would affect the fund The amendment was opposed in the Assembly principally on tech- nical grounds and the Consolidation Bill was therefore lost 3\. This bill took away some privileges enjoyed by subscribers to hospitals and life- governors The Council opposed the altera- tion and the law was left unaltered and un- consolidated 4\. Supreme Court Consolidation -The 9th clause a new proposal enabled the Governor in Council to suspend any of the judges of the Supreme Court for inability or misbe- bavior It was struck out by the Council, because it affected the independence of the judges, only amenable under certain circum- stances to the Legislature The clause was insisted on by the Assembly, and the Supreme Court Acts were left unconsoli- dated 5\. Constitution Acts Consolidation - The Houses were not agreed as to whether this bill enacted all the provisions of the several acts proposed to be consolidated The Coun- cil held that it would be better to let the Constitution Acts stand unaltered and un- consolidated 6\. This bill repealed two clauses of the onginal act for the recovery of penalties. The clauses had been transferred to the Audit Consolidation Bill, but as that bill was lost, the Council at the direction of Mr Fellows, proposed to re-enact them in this measure The Assembly (under the direction of Mr Higinbotham) considered them out of place 7 A bill brought in in consequence of some decision of the courts on the question whether the transfer of a bill of lading amounted to a transfer of the goods It was held by the lawyers in the Council to be un- neccessary The Waterworks Bill has been inserted in some lists as a rejected bill The Council amended a clause which the Assembly held was covered by the 56th section of the Con- stitution Act The bill was withdrawn, and a new measure (which included the amend- ment of the Council) passed by both Houses SESSIONS Nos 1 And 2 1866 In the first session the Customs Duties Bill (containing the protective tariff, &c; ) was rejected on account of the novel form of preamble in which all financial power was claimed for the Assembly. A pre- amble was agreed to, and a second session was held Nine measures were passed, inclusive of the Customs Duties Act and Appropriation Act Bills sent up ...............................................12 Passed..................................... 9 Lapsed ......................................1 Lost........................................... 2 \- 12 Bills Lost-1, Supply Bill (temporarily; 2 Insolvency Act of 1865 Amendment. 1 This bill was objected to in the first in- stance, because the Council claimed the right to deal with the Repeal of the Gold Duty, for which it provided in a separate measure under the Constitution Act. An under- standing was subsequently arrived at and the Supply Bill assented to SESSION OF 1867 (No 1) In this session 23 bills (of which a consider- able proportion were initiated in the Council) became law Bills sent up............................................... 24 Passed.......................................... 16 Lapsed ............................................1 Withdrawn and re introduced.......... 2 Lost ..................................................5 \- 24 Bills Lost -1. Insolvency 2. Board of Agriculture Abolition, 3, Officiate in Parlia- ment, 4, Payment of Members, 5, Appro priation (Darling grant) 1\. The main objection to this bill (the copy of an English bill, not then passed) was that it centralised insolvency business in Mel- bourne It was referred to a select com- mittee, which brought up an amended mea- sure, but no further action was taken this session. A new insolvency law was passed in 1870 2.This was originally a bill to reorganise the Board of Agriculture. The Assembly passed the clause which abolished the board, and cut out all the others The Council objected to the summary abolition of the board until some fresh arrangement had been determined on The board was subsequently abolished, and a department of agriculture created, under the Minister of Lands 3\. This was a bill introduced by a private member, and opposed by Mr Higinbotham on behalf of the Government, to repeal the act which disqualified members of Parlia- ment from accepting positions in the public service until they had been six months out of Parliament The bill met with no support in the Council-was only moved pro- forma (Several subsequent attempts were made to repeal the act , the last bill on the subject did not pass the Assembly ) 5\. The Appropriation Bill was rejected because it contained the Darling grant. Hence arose the second deadlock. The Council contended that the grant to the ex-Governor was in the first place improper, and in the second ought not to have been included under any circumstances in the Appropriation Bill SESSION 0F 1867 (No 2) This session only lasted two months.

SESSION OF 1868 No bills were rejected by the Council Sent up from the Assembly 6, passed 5 with- drawn 1. The deadlock was terminated by the refusal of Sir Charles Darling to accept the £20,000 grant SESSION OF 1869 The principal measure of the session was the Land Act; 25 bills became law Bills sent up................................................30 Passed................................. 25 Lapsed................................... 2 Lost ........................................3 ...................................................................- 30 Lost Measures -1. Scab Bill; 2. Payment of Members; 3. State Aid Abolition. 1 The Scab in Sheep Pill of the Assembly was entirely remodelled by the Council who adopted a number of the provisions, of the New South Wales Act, mid created district boards to administer them The principal amendments of the Council were approved by the Government of the day (Macpherson), but rejected by the Assembly Next session, the Scab Bill was initiated in the Council by the Government (M'Culloch), boards of ad- vice created,&c; It was accepted by the Assembly SESSION OF 1870 This was the last session in which the Darling grant was heard of. On the an- nouncement of the death of Sir Charles Darling, the Assembly, on the motion of Sir James M'CuIloch seconded by Mr Fellows (Opposition) voted an annuity to Lady Dar- ling, and both Houses passed the bill. For the first time a Payment of Members Act was passed. As an experiment it was provided that members of the Legislature in the next Parliament should be paid £300 a year, to re- imburse them for their expenses. In 1874, as the mind of the country had not clearly been made up the act was renewed for three years at the instance of Major Smith. In 1876, Mr Casey brought in a bill to re- peal payment of members, as public opinion seemed to have gone against the principle. The bill was lost by 29 votes to 24. In 1877, the issue put to the country was the general policy of the M'Culloch Govern- ment, which was defeated on account of its great unpopularity About half of the mem- bers of the new Assembly had declared, amongst other things, for payment of mem- bers.It was believed in the Assembly by the supporters of the Berry Government, that the Upper House would refuse to renew the ex- periment and a vote for payment of mem- bers was put in the first instance on the Estimates, which was the origin of the dead- lock of 1877-8 Ultimately a separate bill to provide for the payment of the existent Parliament, was passed in 1877-8.

In consequence of amendments inserted by the Council, and clauses taken out, the Government gave up the bill. In 1874, the local Government Acts were con- solidated and amended, and the road districts system abolished................................................................12/4/2019 SECOND SESSION OF 1870 Bills sent up................................................ 14 Passed....................................12 Lost ..........................................1 Withdrawn................................ 1 .....................................................................- 14 The bill lost was the Marriage with De- ceased Wife's Sister The original Wines Beer, Spirits Sale Statute Amendment Bill was withdrawn, re introduced, and passed in an amended form SESSION Or 1871 In this session, the third M'CuIloch Govern- ment was defeated in the Assembly on the proposal to impose a property tax of 6d in the £, and the first and only Duffy Govern- ment was formed A protective tariff, with some duties as high as 20 per cent, was in- troduced by Mr Berry, the new Treasurer, and passed by both Houses Bills sent up..................................................34 Passed............................... 26 Lost...................................... 8 ...................................................................- 34 Bills Lost-Labour, Permissive, Impound- ing, Fencing, Post office Statute Amendment, Electoral Act Amendment, Scab Bill, Wines, Beer, and Spirits Sale Statute 1\. This was the bill of a private member-to affirm that a labourer who had worked eight hours had done a day's work, and to prohibit the employment of children under 12 for more than four hours a day The bill was rejected as unnecessary, the eight hours' system having been established by the trades, and being recognised by the law courts. It was re introduced in 1872, and again rejected A new provision bad been added to terminate work in mines at 6pm on Saturdays 2\. Permissive Bill -Read a second time two days before the close of the session. In committee clause 1 was postponed, and no further progress made. In 1872, the same bill was sent up again This bill, which was intended to provide for a public vote on the question whether any or what number of public houses should be licensed in a dis- trict, passed the Assembly, but many mem- bers voted for it merely to retain the support of the teetotal party at elections, and in the real hope that the Council would throw the measure out The agitation for the permis- sive system has not been heard of since 1872. By the acts of 1870 and 1876, special restric- tions were put on the issue of licences under certain circumstances. Fencing and Impounding-These were bills on which the two Houses could not agree for some time The first bill turned on the question what should be held to be a substantial fence between adjacent proper- ties. The Assembly required the erection of a fence which would keep out great cattle; the Council a fence that would also shut out calves, sheep, pigs, goats,&c; In 1872 bills were initiated in the Council as well as the Assembly, but no agreement was arrived at. In 1873, a fencing bill satisfactory to all parties was passed. An impounding bill was agreed to in the same session. Post office Statute Amendment -A bill to reduce the postage on inland newspapers to 1/2 d , and legalise postal cards. This has since been agreed to, as well as some other post- oflice concessions. Electoral Act Amendment Bill -A bill to provide that ratepayers left off the municipal roll for non payment of rates should neverthe- less be retained on the electoral roll The Council held that electors who did not pay up their rates were not entitled to the privileges of ratepayers, and should take out electors' rights if they wanted to make their votes secure. The proposal has not been revived since. Scab Bill - A measure brought in by the Duffy Government to assimilate the act of last session to the New South Wales act, and also throw all the cost of administration on the flockowners. Wines, Beers, and Spirits - A bill to amend some of the provisions of the act of 1870. An amendment of the law on this subject was made in 1876, and accepted by the publicans and the teetotallers' party as a compromise. SESSION OF 1872 Of the 36 measures passed the one of supreme importance was the Education Act. It provided for a system of public instruc- tion, free, secular, and compulsory, and the entire abolition of assisted denominational schools The bill to legalise marriage with a deceased wife's sister was agreed to, and reserved for Her Majesty's approval. Bills sent up................................................ 43 Passed............................ 36 Lost................................... 7 ..................................................................- 43 1\. Permissive Bill; 2. Labour Bill; 3. Land Act Amendment; 4. Labour in Mines Pre- vention; 5. Market Laws; 6. Fencing 7., Mining on Private Property. 4\. Labour in Mines Prevention - A bill to terminate work in mines, except in cases of absolute necessity after 6 p m on Saturdays. The bill was rejected as unnecessary and unpractical 5\. Market Laws Amendment - A bill by a private member, in the interests of the mar- ket gardeners, as against the City Corporation of Melbourne 7\. Mining on Private Property - This was the first bill passed by the Assembly since 1858-9. 80 It was brought in by Mr Mackay, Mini ster of Mines in the Francis Government. It empowered the Governor in Council to grant a lease to persons to enter and mine on pri- vate property on payment, beforehand to the owner of the consequential damage to be done to the land (Debates vol 15, 1,4520 Clause 5 legalised all contracts entered into up to July 1872. A number of petitions were presented to the Council against the bill. In the Council, on the motion of Dr Dobson, the 5th clause was extended to cover all con- tracts entered into before or after the act came into operation; in short, to leave all matters to be settled between the owner on the one hand and the miner on the other. The Houses disagreed. The Assembly aflirmed (p 1934) that the bill as altered attempted to appro- priate the gold on private lands (which gold was the property of the Crown) to | private persons and did not protect miners who de- sired to mine for gold in pnvate lands from unreasonable demands. The House also affirmed (resolution 6) that the bill as it stood was inoperative for the gold would still remain the property of the Crown. The Council in reply, said (p 2,109,) that as the bill legalised past contracts they had only extended the principle to all owners of land throughout the colony. Also "That while the bill proposed to confer extraordinary powers upon a political Minister over all property in land under colour of extracting gold therefrom, it pro- vided no safeguards to the owners thereof, but left them open to a system harassing in its nature, creating lnsecurity and oflering no substantial guarantee of adequate or any compensation for injury that might be done to such lands by persons other than the owners mining thereon; a system, moreover, susceptible of being largely resorted to by speculators rather than by the industrial miner" No agreement was arrived at, and the bill was lost for the session. The same bill w as sent up with a few modi- fications in 1873. The regulations for the administration of the measure were embodied in it, also the clauses of the Lands Compen- sation Statute, under which the compensation to be paid to the owner was to be determined. The owner was to receive full compensation for damage done and consequential damages. The bill was read a second time in the Council, but abandoned in committee of the whole, on account of the insertion of an Amendment, which stated that in the case of land ahead alienated the Crown must ob- tain the consent of the owner before it granted a lease to a miner to enter and mine. In 1874 the second reading of the bill was only moved one week before the close of the session It was moved in the Council by Mr Anderson, of the M'Culloch Government. Clause 3 empowered the Governor in Council to lease the right to mine on private lands (vol 20 p 2.509) and clause 4 entitled the owner to obtain a lease to mine himself if he desired to mine. Existing con- tracts were legalised. Provision was made for the payment of compensa- tion to landowners where they did not mine themselves and other persons wished to do it. It was urged in support of the bill -(1.) That it would stimulate the production of gold now somewhat declined, and (2) enable the Government to alienate a great deal of land withheld from sale because it was pre- sumed to be auriferous The bill was mainly opposed on the ground that it was sub- mitted too late for consideration (just before the close of the session) Attention w as drawn in the course of the debate to a clause in the Lands Act of 1869, which enabled the Go- vernor in Council to resume possession of land alienated under that act, on payment of full compensation to the purchaser We mention this here merely to note the clause. Members declared (page 2,520) that if the Crown wanted to enter on private lands it ought to resume them in the ordinary way. The second reading was negatived by the Council by 8 votes to 7. In 1875-6, the bill was read a second time, and partly considered in committee It was then decided that legislation should be post- poned until the Privy Council in an appeal case, had decided whether the Crown had any claim to the gold on private lands [The next bill was sent up in 1877, which see ] SESSION OF 1873. In all 20 bills were passed One of them dealt with the vexed question of fences. It was the measure of the Assembly, and was adopted with few amendments Bills sent up................................................ 34 Passed..................... 26 Bills lost...................... 8 1, Mining on Private Property; 2.

This was the scheme of the Francis Government The bill divided the colony into 90 electorates each of which was to return one member to the Assembly. The new prin- ciple of single and equal electorates met with much criticism. It had never been in any way placed before the country; nor was it ever subsequently approved by the con- stituences In short, the proposal was allowed to be quietly forgotten. In the Council the bill was rejected by 16 votes to 10 The bill of the M'Culloch Government on the same subject m 1876 was passed. It altered the boundaries of some of the electoral districts, and re- moved anomalies-it also increased the num- ber of members of the Assembly from 78 to 86 4\. A bill to establish one form of procedure in the Supreme Court and unite law and equity. The second reading was proposed in the Council on November 4, or three weeks be- fore the prorogation. The House, by resolution, declared that it was strongly in favour of a consolidation of the several jurisdictions of the Supreme Court, but regretted that the bill had not been sent up at an earlier date. The measure was then allowed to stand over until next session. Next session, 1874, the bill was initiated by the Government in the Council and passed, but not taken up for want of time in the Assembly The same measure was regularly passed by the Council, session after session, up to 1877-8 but never advanced in the Assembly. In 1878, a bill was initiated in the Assembly, by the Berry Government but not proceeded with there beyond the first stage Savings Bank-This was a bill to enable the Government to absorb the banks con- ducted by commissioners (independently of the state) into the Post office system.As the commissioners banks had been well man- aged, the rejection of the bill was regarded with satisfaction rather than otherwise. Statute of Evidence Amendment - A bill to enable the Minister of Lands to summon witnesses before a sort of court he had opened at the Lands department, under the Act of 1869. SESSION OF 1874 The number of measures passed was 26 One of them consolidated and amended the Local Government Acts. The Payment of Members Act was renewed for another Par- liament In the Assembly, the second read- ing w as carried by 41 to 31, inclusive of pairs,; in the Council the votes were 12 to 11 Bills sent up............................................... 25 Passed............................. 22 Lost.................................... 3 \- 25 Bills lost:- 1 Mining on Property (see above); 2 Officials in Parliament (see above); 3 Life Insurance Companies Amendment. 3 An act on this subject was passed in 1873, and this bill was an addition to it The Council wished for the protection of sub- scribers to bring friendly societies under the Life Insurance Act, which the Assembly objected to. A comprehensive Friendly Societies Act was passed m 1877-8 SESSION OF 1875-6 In all 28 bills, of which some were initiated in the Council, were passed One was the Crown Lands Act of 1869 Amendment Act (Pastoral tenant's rent) Bills sent up................................................ 27 Passed............................. 23 Lost.................................... 4 \- 27 Bills lost: - 1 Thistles Prevention; 2, University De- grees, 3, Legal Professions Amalgamation; 4, Mining on Private Property 1\.

A bill to convert part of the old Mel- bourne Cemetery into a, market Agreed to next session SESSION Or 1877- 8 The Berry Government came into power. In all 35 measures became law. The Land Tax Act was assented to by both Houses also measures for the construction of several lines of Railway, the drainage of mines &c.; An amendment in the tariff, chiefly in the interests of protection was proposed by Mr Berry, and agreed to by both Houses. The live stock tax and the export duties on wattle bark and red gum turned out, in accordance with the predictions of the Opposition, to be most injudicious and had to be partly repealed, partly reduced, next session. The Payment of Members Bill, which the Council refused to read a second time in the first instance, because a vote had been placed on the Estimates, was ultimately agreed to, The Appropriation Bill rejected on account of the tack (payment of members), was laid aside, and the two subjects dealt with separatey Bills sent up................................................ 46 Passed......................................... 35 Withdrawn and reintroduced......... 3 Lost................................................ 8 \- 46 Bills lost - 1 Gipps Land Railway , 2, Goulburn Valley ; Forts and Armaments; 4, Exhib- tion ; 5, Dower Abolition ; 6, Railway Loan Transfer; 7, Tolls; 8, Mining on Private Property. 1 and 2 The two Houses could not agree on the routes proposed for these lines Next session, by the purchase of the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway,the diferences between the two Houses were settled on the first bill, and on the second a compromise was arrived at 3 Forts and Armaments. Rejected on account of the preamble The works were provided for on the Estimates for 1877-8 and 1878-9, and went on without interruption 4 Exhibition Bill Objected to partly on account of the site chosen (Carlton gardens), of which the City Corporation were joint trustees with the Board of Land and Works and partly because the proposal was thought out of place in the then condition of the country, for the deadlock had practically commenced, and the future looked dark. Next session, the Government came to reasonable terms with the corporation, as to the occupation of Carlton gardens, and the bill was passed In the meantime, the ini- tiation of the scheme was provided for on the Estimates 1 Dower Abolition -The votes were equal, and the bill was lost This case enables us to illustrate the unreasonableness of some complaints against the Council Next session the bill was initiated in the Council, and ob- jection to it was withdrawn, as it had been ascertained by inquiry that no existent rights would be seriously affected The bill was sent to the Assembly, but never proceeded with there In the session of 1877-8 Mr Pearson complained of the rejection of this bill by the Council, but in 1878, nobody pro- posed that the Assembly should go on with it though it could have been passed in a few minutes 6 Loan Transfer Bill -A bill to enable the Government to use part of the loan of 1876 to execute works which had been pro- vided for out of the loan of 1872, but for which funds were not available, on account of the depreciated value of 1872 stock. Re- jected, as equivalent to a breach of faith with the public by whom the loan of 1876 was advanced 7 Tolls Bill-Tolls carne to an end on the 31st December, 1877 The Government of the day had several times promised to find some substitute for them. The object of this bill was to prolong tolls for 12 mouths The Council altered 12 months to six, then restored the bill to its original form but in the meantime the Assembly had adjourned from December to February The Council sent down the bill in February with a technical alteration, but the Government allowed the bill to drop 8 Mining on Private Property --This may be regarded as the third scheme of the As- sembly on this subject The bill empowered the Governor in Council (clause 2) to enter private land to mine for gold, and to make terms with the owner as to the compensation to be paid for the portion of the surface taken, the damage done to adjacent land, &c; If an agreement was not arrived at, the amount was to be fixed by a warden or court of mines The compensation was to be paid before any lease was issued to persons to mine. It was not obligatory on the Governor in Council to grant a lease to any particular applicant Past and current con tracts were not legalised, but if both the parties to a contract between owner and miner chose to apply for a lease, they would obtain the preference over all other ap- plicants If an owner carried on operations alone, he would obtain a lease before any- body else The objections to the measure were that it left nearly every thing to the dis- cretion of the Minister of Mines All arrange- ments between miner and owner had to be made through him The contracts also, which in the past the Assembly had been ready to legalise, were now practically set aside, or an inducement held out to one of the parties to break them The Council substituted the bill of Mr Wallace representative of the Eastern Pro- vince and a miner of great experience. This bill was framed by a select committee of which Mr Wallace was chairman and pre- ceded by an examination of witnesses from the gold fields The Council proposed that all contracts between owner and miner then in existence should be legalised-a principle affirmed by the Assemby in the bills of 1872-6 2. It left miners and owners at liberty to make terms for themselves, because it was seen that in some cases the miner might prefer to pay the owner a percentage on the gold he obtained rather than pay down a lump sum at the commence- ment for an uncertain result. 3. The Governor in Council was empowered (where no private arrangement was arrived at) to enter on private property to mine,on condition that the owner was compensated for direct and consequenial damages.The compensation was to be determined under the Lands Com- pensation Statute.This was proposed in the Assembly bill of 1873 above.).The regu- lations under which applications were to be granted or refused were set out in the bill, and the discretionary powers of the Minis- ter minimised. The Council had seen how sevral of the land acts had been extended or varied in a way not contemplated by Par- liament simply by the exercise of discretion on the part of the Minister at the head of the department, and desired to put some check on him in this instance the amend- ments of the Council were never considered in the Assembly Next session the Council took the initiative and passed Mr. Wallace's bill with some unimportant modifications. The Government neither asked the Assembly to consider Mr Wallace's bill nor brought in one of their own. From the debates of the Houses since the first bill was introduced up to a recent date, two or three deductions can be made.The Assembly has never seriously pretended to regard the contracts entered in to between prívate land owners and miners.with disap- probation-that is as a rule. In individual cases, the terms exacted by the freeholder from the company or association he has dealt with, have been regarded as exorbitant, but for the most part these contracts, though in the eye of the law illegal, have been winked at by the Crown Law officers; and, up to 1876, the Assembly always seemed dis- posed to legalise the arrangements entered into by private parties. In the next place, the gold on private lands has never been sought after as Crown property, and where a rent has been proposed in connexion with leases to mine on alienated lands it has only been nominal, and,moreover, only named in a legal sense, as consideration for the privileges intended to be granted. There has been no proposal to raise any revenue from the gold found on private lands. The Govern- ment have desired simply to.place an unde- veloped product within the reach of the miner, to stimulate industry, and to obtain the right of entry for the miner on as reason- able terms as possible On the other hand, the object of the Council has been to protect property owners from unfair attack,and to obtain respect for their rights. Until gold began to fail on Crown lands, the desire to see the wealth believed to be hidden on pri- vate property unearthed, was never very strong SESSION OF 1878 purchase the Hobson's Bay Railway, &c.;, were included in the 33 measures passed. Up to 1877- 8, the total number of acts assented to under the present constitution was 601 The acts of the late session in- creased the number to 634 for 22 years. Bills sent up............................................. 36 Passed.......................... 33 Lost..................................3 36 Bills lost :- 1 Legal Professions Amalgamation. 2 Constitutional Reform. 3 Rabbit Nuisance Suppression. 1 The bill of the previous session, 2 This was the Berry scheme of reform, the plebiscite,&c; A conference took place between the two Houses, and several at- tempts were made to arrive at a settlement. 3 Both Houses were agreed as to the necessity of a bill for the suppression of the rabbit nuisance. The Assembly empowered local bodies to compel the occupiers of in- fested property to destroy rabbits and levy a special rate The Council made the cost of the destruction of the rabbits a charge upon the property, and required the Go- verment to bear the cost of the suppression of the nuisance on Crown lands leased to pastoral tenants in accordance with the principle that the expense ought to be borne by the landowner in all cases. The Council's amendments were not considered in the Assembly. THE "LOYAL" UTTERANCES OF MINISTERS Attention has been aroused and alarm has been occasioned by the threatening, and even seditious, tone of the addresses delivered from time to time by the various Ministers of the Crown The threats were vague though disquieting in the first instance, but as time has worn on they have become more precise and pointed. We give some illus- trative selections below, and it will be seen that the same argument runs through all the addresses. First the embassy, and if that fails -and Ministers are beginning to regard failure as more than possible-then intimi- dation and violence The Governor is to be superseded, and the mob is to rise MR.BERRY, CHIEF SECRETARY, AND PREMIER. Precedence must be given to the Chief Secretary, as the leader of the Cabinet and of the party On November 13 in a debate in the Assembly, Mr Berry intimated,in the fol- lowing words, that he should warn the Colo- nial Office that it must do as the embassy directs it, or there will be anarchy in Melbourne - " They (the embassy) would say to the Eng- lish Government. We know that you gave us this constitution with a good intention, that it should benefit the colony , but it has been the very reverse of an advantage You have placed a power in our colony that is more mimical to our welfare than Downing street itself, and we expect that you will gener- ously accede to our request that it be re- moved. Consider this thing, and bear in mind that the disgrace to the Imperial Government will be as great as to us if anarchy in the 19th century should occur in the city of Melbourne". He had previously at Daylesford, on Septem- ber 13, spoken to the same effect though in milder words -"If the Imperial Govern- ment would not accede to our request (for an amendment of the Constitution Act), then we could say, at all events that we had not the responsibility of not asking; and they would have the responsibility of refusing, because if there was one thing more cer- tain than another, it was that Victoria would not be content to remain under a constitu- tion that placed it in hourly danger and weekly jeopardy Speaking at Sale (November 13), Mr Berry made the announcement that the party de- sired to get rid of the Governor, or at least to forbid the Imperial Government vetoing through him any revolutionary proceed- ings here. He endorsed the proposition that, so long as the important functions of the Governor were directed by the Secretary of State in secret despatches this colony had the name but not the reality of self- govern- ment. The second request of the commis- sioners to the Imperial authorities would therefore be that if they did not see their way to do the small act that the people of Victoria required, and enable them without danger to the public peace to carry on then own affairs, thatt at least a clear understand- ing should be arrived at as to the relations between the Colonial Office, the Governor of the colony, and the Ministry of the day. It must never be forgotten that had we here our own independent soveieign living within our own borders as was the case in Great Britain there would be no deadlock. If we had here not a governor directed from Downing street, but an independent sove- reign, there would be no difficulty in our con- stitution no obstruction to the popular will. Even supposing the commissioners to fail in both these objects-not that he anticipated refusal-still it was necessary to have tried in order that afterwards it might not be said that application was not made If we learned that there was no hope from that quarter, and that a great evil existed, which inter- ferred with self government in this colony, and which could not or would not be re- moved, then we should at least look the situation in the face. The people of this colony would be called upon to determine whether they would submit and be content to accept the theory of self government without its practical effect He believed that the people were resolved to have reform, and would have it Mr Berry's latest and perhaps most signi- ficant utterance was in the Town hall, Mel- bourne, December 20 on the occasion of a farewell banquet to the two delegates who are proceeding to England He commented on the despatch from the Secretary of State, and said that it contained a promise that Greatt Britain would interfere and concede a new con- stitution to Victoria as a last resort And he said -"When is the last resort?" It will be part of the work of the embassy in London to obtain an answer to that question We will ask the Secretary of State what further must the people of Victoria suffer before the ' last resort' comes. Does he want broken heads and houses in flames?"' Mr Berry proceeded to argue that all means short of "broken beads and houses m flames" had been ex- hausted already, and that if the embassy returned unsuccessful the recourse must be to that He said: -" I have always held that our Constitution Act does contain within itself all the power essential to settle this question but the Government shrink, as all honest, thoughtful men should shrink from a contest which, however successful, must be marked by the complete and permanent humiliation of our opponents, from a course which would be surrounded by circumstances which all must deplore, and which could not be read in the history of the future with satisfaction. "I go", he said, " to a Government which rules over a free people with a constitution based on liberty, and I shall ask for us here what the people enjoy there. And we will tell them that if they refuse this to us they will leave this fine colony in jeopardy, because, what- ever comes, the people of this country can- not go back We will ask them as statesmen to look ahead and to prove their statesman- ship by realising the danger to ourselves- aye, and the danger to England also. At all events, we will never forget that we are the representatives of a free people; that what we ask in one way we ourselves can do another " MR. PEARSON, MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION Mr Pearson is not a Minister, but as he is chosen to go to England as a delegate with Mr Berry, his declarations have also a special value In the Assembly, August 1, Mr Pearson argued that the idea of a revolt would frighten the Imperial Government into conceding to the Ministry all it asked for He said, " England learned a lesson a hun- dred years ago in a contest she had with one of her colonies There were then in America persons calling themselves "Loyalists", who had great influence with the British Govern- rnent and who shouted ' treason ' when Patrick Henry talked in the Virginia. Legisla- tion of the dangerous course the Govern- ment pursued: but in a few years the British Government came to the conclusion that it was not with the men who shouted ' treason' that the people of America sympathized. The lesson of that experience has not been lost. The British House of Commons is one of the most common sensible assemblies in the world It will not sacrifice solid in- terests it will not sacrifice the connexion with England of a great dependency, to any desire to preserve the gilded ornament of a Legislative Council." Speak- ing on the same subject in the Assem- bly, November 7, Mr Pearson was parti- cularly frank in his language -" There are times we know when a general is obliged to proclaim what ia called a martial law, which is really the absence of all law. There are times when the commander of a fortress destroys the houses under his citadel, and undoubtedly there are times when a nation must resort to extraordinary means which no dispassionate statesman would ever dare to contemplate, simply because the safety of all men may depend upon them I will not suppose that such an emergency will arise here, but if it did the statesman who would have to deal with that state of affairs would have to bear in mind that it w as not a change constitution-not a reform that was being clamoured for, but a revolution which might shake the very foundations of society. " SIR BRYAN O'LOGHLAN ATTORNEY GENERAL. To the Attorney-General belongs the honour of being the first to indicate that the choice was between the Ministerial Bill and violence; that if the Government could not carry their measure by parliamentary they contemplated the use of mob agencies As far back as July 31 he pointed out in the Assembly that the object of this bill was to enforce peacefully by act of Parliament powers which might be enforced in a more violent manner. "Had hon members ever realised," he went on to say, "what must happen if a Government having the management of the helm of state in the time of a deadlock a Govern- ment with a people firm and united behind them, if this Goverment were determined to take steps to carry out the will of the people- had hon members realised what those steps would be? (Hear, hear) Perhaps the de- portation of the members of the Council over the Murray, or, it might be, to invite the Governor to go on board a steamer in the bay." Sir Bryan O'Loghlen went on to remind the House of the American rebellion, and was greeted with expressions of dissent from the Opposition benches "I do not suggest this course," he continued, "I should be very sorry to see this country placed in that position but I cannot forget that in America an occurrence took place something more than a hundred years ago. That is an example which we do not wish to follow, but we should do well to be guided by that example, and to avoid the shoals and rocks which otherwise we might be driven on to". MAJOR SMITH, MINISTER OF EDUCATION This hon gentleman has not concealed the Ministerial views and intentions. Parti- cular attention has been excited by his speech in the Legislative Assembly, November 28. in which, besides indulging m the usual threats of what would follow the failure of the embassy, he sketched the Ministerial plan of operations,--namely to tack some extreme measure of reform to the annual Appropriation Bill, and to date the Council to reject the combined mea- sure Major Smith said it might be neccessary to have one more tack before the constitutional difficulty was settled --one final tack. The country would be asked what the reform should consist of. One or two questions would be put to them before we went through the ordeal of the severest deadlock the country had seen yet--- a deadlock brought about by the tack of a new constitution to the Appropriation Bill. Some hon members desired that further efforts should be made to arrive at a settle- ment with the Upper House Did anyone believe that the other Chamber would con- cede any thing which was not wrung from it ? The reason why the Government intended to go home was that they felt that they had no right to plunge political parties into civil strife until they had made one last appeal; and where should that appeal be made but to the mother country. from which we got our constitution It might be necessery to find out who in this country were for the Government, and who against them But if they resorted to extreme measures first, the Imperial Government might say, "Why did not you come to us? You had no right to plunge the country into civil strife and create suffering and distress, until you came to us" At Clunes, Octobei 25 and at Ballarat, November 11, Major Smith spoke to the same effect--- "Reform they must have, peaceably if pos- sible but come it must". MR. J.B.PATTERSON, MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS We need make but short extracts to show how thoroughly this gentleman is in accord with his colleagues. Addressing a meeting at Hotham on November 29, Mr Patterson remarked,-"The law and order party said we should settle the matter among ourselves He said that would mean shillelaghs"(Cheers) In the Assembly, November 13 Mr Patter- son said -"Even it the delegates came back from England with a positive understanding that under no circumstances would the British Government interfere, even then we would not have failed, because we would know for certain that we could legislate for ourselves, and whatever consequences might arise by reason of the want of aid which we had applied for would be no fault of the people of this colony." MR.LONGMORE, MINISTER OF LANDS The Minister of Lands was at the Hotham demonstration on November29 He said - "The embassy would go home (Loud ap- plause ) it would in all probability be suc- cesful ; if not, what would the country have lost? The people would have their battle to fight. Did they know how Alexander cut the Gordian knot? He cut it with the sword (Tumultuous applause) The people must, if needs be, fight for their liberties" And again at a Stawell meeting. Mr Longmore declared, amid loud applause, that " no people ever got or retained free institutions unless they were prepared to fight for them." MR. LALOR, MINISTER OF CUSTOMS This Minister has only had one opportunity of addressing himself to the reform issue. This was in tho Assembly August 27, and he took advantage of it. He said - "There are very few people who in times of war would go to greater extremes than I would. When the flag is up I will fight, but if there is to be peace I am as gentle as a lamb. I might re- mind the hon member for Boroondara that on referring to history he will find that there are very marked records of the steps taken by the people of England to alter the consti- tution from the time when the king was abso- lute to the present time, when the Commons are absolute The hon member will find that there were people during those long years who were not very particular about the means by which they carried out the great objects they had in view --that is to say, they had to use strong measures to effect their purpose I might remind the hon member that one king lost his head-he was abso- lutey beheaded; another lost his throne. Were not those curious things?" THE ATROCIOUS MURDERS OF POLICE OUTRAGE AT EUROA It is now over two months since the police camp in the Wombat Ranges was attacked by the Kelly gang of bushrangers, and the three policemen murdered. Not only have the four murderers successfully evaded a large number of police who were sent im- mediately in pursuit, but they have in the interim committed a daring outrage at Euroa. The township of Euroa is on the North-Eastern line of railway, about 100 miles north by east of Melbourne, and is within the district infested by the outlawed gang and their friends. It possesses a branch of the National Bank, but although it was well-known that the gang had deter- mined on sticking up and robbing some bank, this township was left without any protection beyond the presence of a solitary constable. On Monday, the 9th of Decem- ber, whilst the police were all looking for the murderers in the ranges many miles away, the latter quietly descended on a pastoral station called Faithfull's Creek, owned by Mr. Younghusband, and situated about three miles further up the railway line than Euroa. The ruffians were fully armed with guns and revolvers, and rode four splendid horses. They bailed up all the male employes on the station, as also a number of railway labourers, farmers, and others, who called at or were seen passing the home- stead, and locked them up in the store- room. Amongst the callers was a hawker, from whose cart the outlaws provided them- selves with a new outfit. The gang held possession of the station for nearly two days, and kept 22 able-bodied men prisoners for 24 hours. During Monday night two of them kept watch whilst the other two went to sleep. Early next morning they destroyed the telegraph lines, smashing eight of the iron poles on which they were fixed, and twisting the wires into an extricable mass, so that they might not be easily repaired. In the afternoon a line repairer was sent down from Benalla to see what was wrong with the wires, and he also was made a prisoner of. Preparations were then made for sticking up the bank at Euroa. This was the principal ob- ject of the gang, and they had merely seized on Younghusband's station as a vantage ground from which they could conveniently and suddenly descend upon the bank. Before starting Ned Kelly, the leader, took a cheque from the desk of Mr. Macauley, the overseer, and said he wanted it as a means of gaining an entry into the bank. One of the gang named Byrne was left as a sentry over the prisoners, and one of the latter was taken out of the store and kept covered with Byrne's rifle. Kelly intimated that if any of the party made a disturbance, or attempted to escape, this hostage would be shot. The other three ruffians then left, Ned Kelly driving a springcart he had taken from one of the prisoners, Dan Kelly in the hawker's cart, which was driven by the hawker's boy ; and the third man, whose name proves to be Stephen Hart, accompany- ing them on horseback. The bank was closed at the usual business hour, 3 o clock, and at a quarter to 4 o'clock the two clerks were engaged in balancing their books, while Mr. Scott, the manager, was in his room close by. A knock was heard at the door, and on its being opened a bushman pre- sented a cheque of Mr. Macauley's, saying he wanted it cashed. The clerks declined to cash a cheque after hours, upon which the man pushed his way in, saying, "I am Ned Kelly." He was immediately followed by another of the gang and both drew their re- volvers and forced the clerks to go into the manager's room, which was just behind the banking chamber. As soon as they got in Ned Kelly ordered Mr. Scott to go and tell the females in the house what visitors they had. In addition to Mr. Scott and the two clerks, there were also in the house Mrs. Scott, her family of five children, Mrs. Scott's mother and two female servants. Dan Kelly kept watch at the back door. As soon as they were all assembled in the passage, Ned Kelly demanded the money in the bank. As Mr. Scott kept one key of the strong chest and Mr Bradley one of the clerks, the other, Mr. Scott replied that it was not altogether in his charge. Kelly at once turned to Mr Bradley, and putting his revolver to his head said he would hold him responsible for the money, and he had better get it at once. After some hesitation Mr. Bradley handed him over the keys. Kelly then proceeded to search the strong chest, and appropriated about £1,500 in notes and nearly £500 in gold and silver. All the inmates were then driven away to Faithfull's Creek station, and the whole affair was managed so cleverly and quietly that no one in the township knew that anything unusual was going on. On arrival at the station, the men were placed amongst the other prisoners but the ladies were allowed to find accommodation for themselves in the house, whilst the other captives were allowed a breath of fresh air. Ned Kelly took the money out of his cart, and securely strapped it on the front of his saddle. About a quarter to 9 the ruffians prepared for a start, but before doing so Ned Kelly locked the captives all up again with the exception of Macauley, whom he ordered to detain the rest of the prisoners for three hours longer, at the same time impressing upon him the fact that the gang would be in the vicinity, and if he let any of the prisoners go before the hour fixed he would be held re- sponsible for it. Kelly and his mates then rode away in the direction of Violet Town. About half an hour afterwards Macauley allowed the prisoners to come out of the store to get some fresh air, but did not allow them to depart until the time fixed previous to their departure. Soon afterwards informa- tion was conveyed to the headquarters of the police, and by 4 o clock in the morning a party of troopers with a black tracker had arrived. The tracker followed the trail of the gang for some distance, and found that the ruffians had doubled back towards the Strathbogie ranges. A few days afterwards 50 additional armed policemen were sent up to the district, and 50 of the Garrison Corps were sent in detachments to guard various townships where branch banks have been established. The gang have since kept themselves in strict concealment amongst the ranges and the police have been unable as yet to discover their whereabouts. It is now well known that they have many sym- pathisers who furnish them with food and information as to the police arrangements, and it is considered by some that before they can be suppressed the Habeas Corpus Act will have to be suspended, so that their friends may be arrested and detained for a time. The leader of the gang has written a voluminous letter to a member of the Legislative Assembly, in which he relates his history, and alleges that his mother and other friends, who are at pre- sent in gaol for assaulting a constable have been wronged by the police. He asks for no mercy for himself, but demands that justice shall be done to his friends, and threatens to do diabolical acts if his request is not com- plied with. The letter is evidently written for the purpose of exciting public sympathy. THE AUSTRALIAN ELEVEN OF CRICKETERS The Eleven, on their return from England, via the United States, landed first at Sydney, and received an excellent welcome They were entertained at a public dinner, and an able speech was delivered on the occasion by His Excellency Sir Hercules Robinson. Their first match was against Fifteen of New South Wales. Not only had they to meet a strong team, but they were somewhat out of form after the Pacific Ocean trip. The Fifteen went in first, and got the uncommonly good score of 338 of which Evans made 54 Sheridan 41, Allen 37, Davis 32, E. Gregory 39 and Tindall 32 Spofforth was not in good health, and therefore did not come off with his usual success as a bowler; and Bailey, in the field, had the misfortune to break his arm The eleven batted only 10 men in the first innings, and obtained but 71 runs. They had there- fore to follow on, and started with 267 runs to the bad Moreover, they could now only bat nine men, for Spofforth was unwell, in addition to Bailey, who had been removed from the ground on the first day. Though so many runs behind, they played the up hill game pluckily A score of 251 runs was obtained on a rather poor wicket:- a performance that would have been satis- factory under ordinary circumstances, but proved insufficient by 10 runs to save the one innings defeat Horan (56), Murdock (40), Boyle (38), Gregory (28), A Bannerman (24), Blackburn (22), C Bannerman (17), and Garrett (13) were the run getters The Eleven, minus Bailey,who had to be left in Sydney under the care of a surgeon, came overland to Melbourne, where they arrived on the 10th instant They had a public welcome at the railway station were next received by the mayor at the Town- hall, then entertained at a public dinner, and finally a moonlight concert, preceded by a torchlight procession, was given in their honour at the East Melbourne Cricket- ground At the dinner His Excellency the Governor was present and the health of the team was proposed in a manly, outspoken speech by the Bishop of Melbourne (Dr Moor- house), who praised them for the ability they had shown on the Enghsh cricket field and the gentlemanlike manner in which they had conducted themselves as public representa tives of the colony The Eleven played a four days match against Fifteen of Victoria, on the The East Melbourne ground, where a super excellent wicket had been prepared. The perfect condition of the turf was wholly in favour of the batsmen, but it was not until the second innings that large aggregate scores were obtained The Fifteen got 172, of which 76 were made by J Slight; the Eleven followed with 198 of which 53 were scored by Garett, 39 by Murdock, and 39 by Gregory In their second innings the Fif- teen put on no less than 288 runs Groube 29, Gaggin 25, Alexander 40, Major 28, Elliott 23, and Tennent 70, were the prominent scorers The Eleven had to get 263 to win, but the turf was so perfect that little doubt was entertained of their ability to make the required number. The first wicket fell for 39 the second for 83 (Horan 25) The third (Murdock 153) was not taken until the Eleven had reached witlin 13 of game Garrett only made 4, but Spofforth 9, and A Banner- man 52, between them scored the last few runs required. For the Fifteen, the most efficient bowlers were Palmer, a young player only just come to the front, and one likely to prove effective in several departments of the game; and Kendall, a cricketer who accompanied the Eleven in the preliminary tour they had through the colonies before they went to England Kendall had a very good average Spofforth, though still in in- different health, and Allan were the suc- cessful bowlers for the Eleven The Eleven afterwards played at Ballarat for two days and at Geelong and then went to Adelaide, South Australia THE ENGLISH GENTLEMEN The team of English gentleman, under the command of Lord Harris who have come to Australia as the guests of the Melbourne Cricket Club, appeared first at Adelaide. They played twelve (with Ulyett and Emmett) against 18 of South Australia, and won by 5 wickets The runs were made chiefly by A N Hornby, 78 and 22; A J Webbe, 35 and 6; V Royle, 2 and 20; A V Lucas, 12 and 0; Emmett, 10 and 6, not out The Englishmen found the ground rather hard and the weather warm, and they certainly had not shaken ofl the effects of the voyage They came on without delay to Melbourne, and commenced practice on the M C C ground. The performances of the team in then first match against the cricketers of Victoria, com- menced yesterday, will be found described elsewhere in this issue On the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th January a match will be played between the English gentlemen and the Australian Eleven, now in Adelaide. The former show great strength as batsmen, but they are weak in bowlers and no doubt will have to include both the professionals in the team GOLD AND THE GOLDFIELDS There is not much matter of special im- portance to record in connexion with the gold mining industry, which is apparently in the same position as it has been in for several months past, the auriferous claims in work yielding in the aggregate at about the same rate, and prospecting being carried on in most of the unproved claims in the dif- ferent districts with the same perseverance as had heretofore distinguished the owners of them The alluvial ground in Ballarat East does not seem to be all worked out, yet, as a nugget of about 61oz. was found last week in the hard conglomerate known as cemented washdirt in the Rising Sun Company, and which has been traced into the claim of the Major Company, and is also ex- pected to continue into and through the Graham Berry claim These com- panies, with the others in the immediate vicinity, are all busy putting down their shafts or erecting machinery, with a view to commence washing operations on an early day The Kingston alluvial mines continue to yield very well, the Dyke's Freehold espe- cially having shown considerable improve- ment last week. From Clunes the news is considered more favourable, and the pros- pects of all the quartz mines there are good. From Blackwood, too, we have more favour- able news. The Haddon alluvial mines con- tinue to yield remarkably well, and more ground has lately been taken up there for mining purposes. Several of the small co- operative and tribute parties along the White Horse Ranges Ballarat, are reported to be making excellent wages out of the quartz lodes there. Mining affairs on the Sandhurst quartz gold field are in a rather dull state, and the same remark applies to the Stawell quartz gold field , but the dulness is in some measure attributable to the fact that the Christmas holidays are at hand, and they generally draw attention away from mining and centre it on coming pleasures An opportunity will be afforded before the next mail leaves here to determine with tolerable accurateness the state of mining during the year 1878, as The Argus will then, according to its usual custom, ascertain, through comparisons of the amounts of gold in the hands of the banks at the commence- ment and the end of the year, the amount ex- ported and the amount minted what was the actual yield of gold in the year The reports of the Government mining registrars and surveyors for the quarter ending 30th September last have just been issued by the Mining department the registrars and surveyors estimate the quantity of gold obtained during the quarter at 194,960oz. 6dwt of which 64,028oz. 18dwt was from alluvial workings, and 130,931oz.8dwt. from quartz workings. The quantity of gold exported through the customs during the quarter was 99,676oz. 15dwt. , and the amount re- ceived at the Royal Mint Melbourne, during the same period, was 144,847oz. of which 107, 874.41oz. was stated to be Victorian gold There were 33,341 miners at work in the quarter, of whom 17,179 Europeans and 9783 Chinese were engaged in alluvial and 11,316 Europeans and 113 Chinese in quartz mining The miners were distributed amougst the seven districts into which the colony is divided in the following proportions:- Bal- larat, 8,359; Beechworth, 4982 Sandhurst, 6384; Maryborough, 7,734; Castlemaine, 4909; Ararat, 2 896; Gipps Land, 1987. The approximate value of all the mining plant in the colony was £1,921,315 and it was located as follows amongst the different districts -Ballarat, £381,281; Beechworth, £207,273; Sandhurst, £502,112; Maryborough, £286,273; Castlemaine, £249,067; Ararat, £178,639; Gipps Land, £116,667. The num- ber of square miles of auriferous ground actually worked upon was 1, 216 1/2 of which 158 1/2 were in the Ballarat district, 336 1/2' in Beechworth district, 141 in Sandhurst dis- rict, 122 1/2 in Maryborough district, 106 in Castlemaine district 80 3/4 in Ararat district, and 209 in Gipps Land. There were 3,393 quartz reefs in the colony actually proved to be auriferous, and they were situated in the different districts as follows -Ballarat 213; Beechworth, 817; Sandhurst 779; Mary- borough, 601; Castlemaine, 401; Ararat, 78 ; Gipps Land, 501. The Magdala Quartz Com- pany at Stawell has sunk their shaft to a depth of over 2,000ft The Newington Com- pany at the same place had theirs down to nearly 2 000ft, and there were 19 other mining shafts in the colony carried down to depths varying from 1,000ft to nearly 2 000ft TIhe three diamond boring drills which were imported here by the Government from America have been at work in different dis- tricts during the past month testing ground. A comparison has been made between the ex- pense of putting down a bore with the dia- mond drill in the Loughlin Company's allu- vial claim at Kingston, and putting down another by the ordinary method in the neigh- bouring alluvial claim of the Lone Hand Com- pany which, so far as cost goes is about 30 per cent in favour of the ordinary bore. The country to be passed through in these two claims is precisely similar in character, and the relative cost of boring at the two was--- Loughlin with diamond drill, £1 8s per foot; Lone Hand with ordinary boring tools, 18s per foot. The diamond drill is much more expeditious in its work, and therefore where a series of bores ia required, it might be cheaper after all than the other But the great expense is the removal of the diamond- rilling appliances from one place to another. If, instead of the massive and intricate framework imported with the drills. with its hundreds of screw bolts and braces &.c , an ordinary shears could be used, and if the present permanent boiler could be replaced with a portable one, a very great saving would be effected in the cost of working. The bore in each of the claims mentioned was over 200ft deep, so that the cost of that made by the diamond drill was more than £100 above that effected with the ordinary apparatus AGRICULTURE The harvest season in Victoria is proving upon the whole an unfavourable one The weather is fine for the work of in gathering, but it has been of that character with slight exceptions for several months past, and the consequences have been most disastrous in many of our best wheat producing districts. The spring and summer have been charac- terised by cold, biting winds from the south- ward simultaneously with bright, scorching sunshine, and occasionally slight showers, insufficient to lay the dust but enough to affect injuriously the wheat,and in conjunction with the foregoing conditions, to cause a great and rapid development of rust where the crops were heaviest and most promising.Rust, at all events, has led to many thousand acres being left unreaped. In other districts the sample is good, and some excellent wheat have come forward, but the yield can hardly be up to the general average, the good crops being too few to balance the total failures. Oats have been more successful, but neither those nor barley have been grown in suflicient quantity for our requirements We shall depend, as hitherto, largely on importa- tions. There are not, as yet, many complaints of the want of feed, although the grass is now very dry, and it must soon become scarce, for rain at this hot season would hardly cause it to spring Water is not scarce, but must soon be so in the drier districts. We are glad to report a favourable clip throughout the greater part of Aus- trali.a In Riverina the years wool supply will be large and good, in spite of the grave losses of sheep last season occasioned by the drought. THE LABOUR MARKET There is very little change in the labour market since last month, but there are indi- cations of a not very promising time for the New Year In several large establishments it is contemplated to effect a considerable re- duction in the working staff early in the New Year, unless business revives In the cloth- ing factories work is at a standstill, this being the dullest time of the year. The artisans engaged in the building trades are fairly employed.The boot trade is still de- pressed Shearing is nearly over, and there is a good demand for harvest men, but in many districts the crops are so poor, owing to the rust, that they are not worth cutting.

The following week was fine and pleasant, with cool southerly breezes blowing. The total rainfall since the begin- ning of the year has been 25. 24in, as com- pared with 22. 86in during the same period in 1877 The average rainfall since 1858 for the same period has been 25.95in THE SEAMEN'S STRIKE AT SYDNEY The strike of the seamen and wharf labourers in the employ of the Australian Steam Navigation Company at Sydney, owing to the employment of Chinese on board the company's vessels, still continues. Several attempts at a compromise have been made, but without effect, neither the company nor the Seamen's Union being apparently inclined to yield to any considerable extent Mean- time the trade of the port of Sydney is almost paralysed, and much inconvenience is occa- sioned to the mercantile community and the public generally. Advantage has been taken of the occasion to organise anti-Chinese demonstrations, mid meetings have been held in the various colonies, at which resolu- tions sympathising with the men on strike were passed, and subscriptions collected for their support. Captain Trouton, manager of the A S N Company, has published a letter, explaining that the Chinese already employed by them, and 300 on the way out, are not to remain in the colony, but to return home as soon as their term of service expires, and that as far as the company is concerned, there is no justification for the present anti- Chinese agitation. An unpleasant feature of the strike has been a number of assaults by the strikers upon men engaged at the A S N Company's wharf, and the latter had to petition the Government for protection The friends of the seamen pointed out, however, that they would injure their cause by resort- ing to any violence, and this representation has had a good effect. Still, many un- offending Chinese in Sydney and other places have been maltreated by lar- rikins and other ruffians, altogether unconnected with the strike The Queens- land Government have to some extent taken up the seamen a cause, as they have notified to the local agent of the A S N Company that in the event of the company not com- plying strictly with the terms of the mail con- tract with Government, and with the spirit of the anti Chinese legislation of 1877, they would feel compelled to give the required notice of withdrawal from the existing contract, on which they pay an annual subsidy of £7,000 The manner in which the seamen principally rely on being able to coerce the company is by obtaining the aid of their fellow work- men at Newcastle to prevent the company procuring coal for their steamers.and the com- pany have on several occasions experienced great difficulty in coaling. In connexion with this point, the Chinese labour question cropped up in Melbourne a few days ago, on the arrival of the A S N Company's steamer Lyce moon. Curiously enough this steamer has no Chinamen employed on board,but the crew do not belong to the Seamen's Union and this was held to be a sufficient cause for the wharf labourers to refuse to discharge the cargo The men employed on two vessels in the bay which were to have supplied the steamer with coal also declined to work. The latest information from Syd- ney states that influential persons are inter- vening between the ASN Company and their employees to bring about a termination of the strike RAILWAY RETURNS The returns of traffic on the Victorian Railways for the week ending December 19 show an increase of £376 2s in the receipts as compared with the amount received for the corresponding week of last year. The aggregate receipts up to date from July 1 amount to £582,275, whilst for the same period of 1877 the amount was £575,035 0s 7d. The weekly average for the 25 weeks was £23,291 0s 5d as compared with £23, 001 8s, the weekly for the same period of last year. The traffic returns on the Hobson's Bay" lines for the week ending December 12 show a decrease of £310 11s in the receipts when compared with the returns for the week end- ing December 13 1877 the respective amounts being-1878 £2,914 10s 7d; 1877 £3, 258 1s 7d. The aggregate receipts to date from July 1 amounted to £73 765 10s 1d., while the receipts from the same date up to De- cember 13 1877 were £77 460 8s 2d THEATRES At the Theatre Royal the "Lancashire Lass" was produced on the 6th inst with Miss Navaro in the character of Ruth Kirby", in which she achieved a decided success Miss Ada Ward returned to this theatre on the 9th inst when she took part in "Olivia's Love," dramatised version of the "Vicar of Wakefield". She took a benefit on the 14th inst when she appeared as Pauline in the "Lady of Lyons". At the Opera house "The two Orphans" was performed on the 9th inst., and on the 16th inst it was replaced by "The Reapers,"for the benefit of Mr G B W Lewis A piece called " Expiation" was reproduced at this theatre on the 20th inst. The pantomime season at this house commenced on the 23rd December, when the London pantomime "Pluto" was produced for the first time in Melbourne. The piece is well put on the stage and is likely to have a successful run. The principal features in- troduced into the piece are the baby harle- quinade and Silvester's " fairy fountain". The Christmas piece at the Academy of Music is a fairy spectacle entitled "Alfred the Great," by Messrs. Marcus Clarlke and Henry Keiley. The cast is a very strong one, the music well selected and the dresses tastefully designed but the piece did not go well the first night. Professor Baldwin has left St Georges Hall after a very successful season.A troupe of female minstrels called " The Blon- denettes" gave their opening performance at this hall on the 21st and were fairly re- ceived Mr. Darcy Read's Ghost has become very popular and this clever entertainment has attracted very fair audiences at the Athenaeum-hall MUSIC At the time of the departure of the last mail Mademoiselle Olga Duboin the Russian pianiste gave a concert at the Townhall, at which she was assisted by Mons. Caron and Mr Hart instrumentalists and Miss Rosina. Carandini Mr Moroney and the Melbourne German Liedertafel, vocalists The most noticeable feature of the concert was Hum- mel's trio for piano violin and vloloncello played by the three artists abovenamed. The part singing by the Liedertafel was very good Madame Pett was accompanyist. At the meeting of the Musical Association of Victoria, Schubert s Octett in F,op.156 was performed fof the first time in Melbourne. It was not sufficiently well rehearsed at the time for represntation. On the same night Mr R.L.J.Ellery, the president, gave a short and interesting lecture on the subject of musi- cal themes The Musical Artists Society of Vic- toria held their ordinary meeting at which an original paper on the subject of "Taste in Music" was read by the author Mr J. 0. Broadley. Amongst a vanety of capital vocal and instrumental selections the D minor trio, o. p. 28, of Fesca, is most wortby of mention as having been admirably played by Messrs. Zelman, H Curtis, and Montague, on the pianoforte, violin, and violoncello respec- tively. At Mademoiselle Duboin's concert at the Town hall on the 9th inst she was assisted by Signor Orton (violin), and Miss Wooldridge, and Mr Whitworth, vocalists. Signor Ortori's violin playing,was full of good effect. On the 11th a good open-air concert was given in the East Melbourne cricket reserve in honour of the arrival of the Aus- ralian Eleven. Mr David Lee was the con- ductor and the players were amongst the best wind instrumentalists available in Mel- bourne. The Rev Charles Clark lectured on "Christmas in Old England; its Customs and its Carols at the Town hall on the 14th December for the benefit of his agent, Mr R. S Smythe. The The house was crammed full. The carol singing was beautifully illustrated by a double quartet of picked voices; and after the lecture an excellent selection of vocal and instrumental music was given by Madame Carlotta Tasca, the most accomplished of pianistes, and Mrs Howitz, Miss Rosaly Merz, and Miss Christian R. A. M., and the quartett abovenamed. Messrs David Lee and Alfred Plumpton were the conductors On the 23rd inst. Madame Tasca appeared for the first time at the Monday Popular Concerts, and played Mendelssohn's "andante and rondo capriccioso" and Thalberg's "Home sweet home", for the left hand only. Her exalted talents were recognised by the audience with the utmost warmth of expression. The short season of English opera came to an end at the Academy of Music on the 21st inst. The works produced have been Plan- quettes "Lea Cloches deCornoville" "La Sonnambula" with Miss Stone a debutante, for the heroine; "La Ponchole", "Girofla- Girofla" and "The Bohemian Girl". In the work last named Miss Rosina Carandini, a lady who has long been deservedly a favourite here as a concert singer, made her debut in opera as Arline.She was quite successful. Miss Clara Thompson, Mr H. Bracy, Miss E. A Lambert, and Mr Templeton were the leading quartet in the other operas. At this theatre a dramatic and musical Christmas piece written and arranged by Messrs Marcus Clarke and Henry Keiley and entitled "Alfred the Great". was produced with success on the 24th inst The leading lady Mdlle Annetta Scasi from the Alhambra, made a hit in the principal part. Mr Alfred Plumpton is the musical director The annual performance of the "Messiah" at the Town-hall, on Christmas night was very largely attended as were also the sacred concerts held at the Academy of Music and the nowIy enlarged Temperance-hall The Melbourne German Liedertafel have their 123rd concert on the 16th inst Mr J. Siede was conductor and Mr W. Hunter accompanyist. On the 18th the Metropolitan Liedertafel had a great gathering of sub- scribers and friends in the Town.
