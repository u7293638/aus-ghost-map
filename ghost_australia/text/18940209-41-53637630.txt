THE CYCLORAMA. The artistic production ot tne Battle ot Waterloo is '* a thing cf beauty and a joy for ever.' Looking at it as a work of art it ia almost perfect, and. on the other hand, the spectator cannot be sure tnat ne is con fronted with art' and not nature. With the scene described by Mr. Lockley in graphic language and the effects eo cleverly worked one can quite imagine oneself from a pinnccle of safety watching the mighty struegle for supremacy. Although there is so much in tha great scene itself the management is still most liberal to its patrons. The extra attractions in the Ghoss of Napoleon and the Enchanted Fountain are fine produc tions. The ghost is a very beautiful illusion. The fountain in the warm weather is posi tively refreshing to look upon. The colours of the waters are exquisite, and the spiral column forms a mass of liquid gems.
