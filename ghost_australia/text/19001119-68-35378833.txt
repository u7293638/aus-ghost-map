SMILED AT HIS OBITUARY. On September 28 all the newspapers of the Canton. of Glarus published de tails of the death of a rich Swiss gentle man named Gehrig, stating that while bathing in the Lake of Como he had lost, his life and that no trace of his body hid' been found. The whole Geh rig family went into mourning. While the will was being read before the relations of the "deceased," M. Geh rig walked. into the room. The assem bly, taking him for a ghost, fled in all directions, and' it was with the greatest difficulty that he was' enabled to explain that he had been called away on im portant business which had kept him some, time. The death notices 'and various accounts of his" life afforded M. Gehrig great amusement. Professor Dewar, who some timile back astonished the scientific world by liqul fying, hydrogen,' has now succeeded in producing 'hydrogen as a solid. The professor explained at the Royal Insti tution how this gas could be solidified by surroundinig a tube containing it with liquid air, to prevent the ingress of heat, and then,: by. applying a powerful air pump to the liquid hydrogen, transform it into a white opaque solid.
