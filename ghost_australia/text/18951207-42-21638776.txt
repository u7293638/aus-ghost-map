Flotsam and Jetsam. The Story-books of Yore. Take back the book thou gavest, for it hath no charms for me; It has no murders in it, and no tales of ghosts at sea; It has no deep analysis of how the human mind WUI work when it ia goffering from paint of any kind. •TU bat t staple tale of lore, of love so de«p and true That not « villain in th« world oonld tarn its roaea bias i And not a shudder did I nave from title to the ond. That* not the book I like to read, Fd hare yon know, my friend. Gire me the book of wild alarms, of dark dim mysteries; Books fall of sorrows, trials, and the sorest miseries, A crime for every page, or, if the author has no bead To think 'em up, disasters of a dreadful sort instead. I want my heart all narrowed up, my soul-strings yanked till tense; OiTe me a thought to split my brains, so terribly immense. Giro mo the book that takes a boy and puts him ia the frame Of mind to soalp his dad4y in pursuit of wealth and fame. In short I pine for those old tomes with yellow-oovered backs, In wblota the hero feeds on fire and munohes carpet taoks, Tho dear old tales we used to read in that sweet bygone time When hucksters sold as horrors at a dosen for a dime. —•• HarPer's Basar."
