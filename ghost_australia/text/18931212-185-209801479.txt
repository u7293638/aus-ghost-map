“WATER, WATER. IN THE DAMS, YEINOT A DROP TO DRINK." TO THE EDITOR. —Yours, &c.;, Ligar street north. EWARD G. WOLLASTON. SIR,— I hope the ghost of “The Ancient Mariner’ will excuse the above parody, which is used to illus trate the fact that, although our dams are excep tionally full, and anew reservoir has been added. this neighborhood is daily deprived ol water lor hours at a time. During the last ten days or so our tap ha 9 been bone-dry from 6 to 9 p.m.; while to-day (Satur day) all domestic arrangements were up«et from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. bv the complete cessation of the supply. That we should be e died upon to pay a stiff water rate for the privilege of going without water in the sumiver months does not seem exactly a fair thing; but if it is reaiiy an impossible matter for men of practical common venae and business capacity— such as the water commissioners are supposed to be— to provide water for those who. pay for it, I would suggest that the rates for all such be reduced one half. This will enable householders to buy tanks and store their own water for summer use.
