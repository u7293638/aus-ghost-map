SPORTFOLIO. There is and will ever remain the three fold aspect of the Almighty God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The belief in God the Father might have de generated into Pantheism and the abstrac tion of philosophy but for Christ the Son, who came not only to tell us that God was our Father(a man might hare told us that), but to proclaim the perfect brotherhood of man, the perfect self-sacrificing love of God, and to inspire us with the love and devotion of children. This He did when He came on earth. But even this might have passed into history, and have been lost in the mists that gather round the distant pasut, but for the promise of the Spirit, the ever present, ever-guiding Spirit Who can understand the Spirit of God, or search out His ways ? Assuredly not he who looks on them with downward eye and regards them as a law, as a tendency, as non-exist ing except in phrase. To understand these we must cultivate the humble the reverent spirit, the eye that is directed to the realities of things, not to their passing forms. Does anyone think that the truths of this day do not concern him, are not practical 1 There is nothing that so con cerns him, nothing that is sooner translat able into immediate action. To believe in God the Father is an unfailing source of patience, content, and dignity. Who is he that shall harm us ? To believe in God the Son is to be a soldier in the one great army of Christ, pledged to a life of charity and toil for others-it is to have an ideal before our eyes that draws our eyes from all lower aims; and to believe in God the Holy Ghost is to know that God's power is with us and in us, and that we need never despair. May we then all our life long join in the hymn of praise, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which wast, and art, and art to come."--Rer. J. M. Wilsoi, 3L.A.
