NOTES AND COMMENTS. Do auctioneers really conduct their business in the best way? A visit to many auction rooms of the city prompts the question. It is desired to sell certain acres of rural land, it was so desired on a certain day of last week What is the process adopted ? Plans are prepared, alterations made, pub city given by liberal advertisements, and a day and on hour appointed for the assem- bling of all intending purchasers Ah here is the place 2 A hat sort of a place would a fair consideration of all the circumstances suggest A large assembly room a comma dious hall, space for the display, a platform for the auctioneer to walk up and don a comfortable accommodation for every body, and if enthusiasm were a necessary or desirable adjunct, a band of music a barrel of beer, a case of champagne? All these things seem natural, but all are lacking Look into the Collins street room on the occasion of the selling of the rural land, penetrate the crowd if you desire to purchase land or experience take a glimpse Of all the surroundings The place is full, people crowd the floor, exhalations from the people crowd all the space from floor to cod ing If it is not without, it 13 very hot within. If it is cold without, it is simply foul within An idea grows that buyers or intending buyers or people who like to watch the pro casE of buying, are not the class of people who suffer most by the temporary stoppage of the Yan Yean, or, otherwise, that the Yan Yean is powerless to neutralise the op pressiveness of some aggregations of human it The business is usually conducte 1 just after lunch, too, and the presence of lunch seems at least as palpable as the spirit of speculation Liquor in many cases also has followed lunch, and tobacco has accompanied liquor Is It had tobacco, or is the ghost of tobacco as well) s malodorous as a churchyard ghosts Is the auctioneer speaking truth when he declares this to be absolutely the last chance ? And do the people linger in the place because they are absolutely sure of that fact' Nor is the disposal of city land at £800 a foot surrounded with much more or magna licence. The crowd are overawed by the vastness of the transactions, and look at the open door as in the banking halls the people with small cheques to cash, or timid in quiries to make at the door above which is written, Manager Those who propose to buy stroll in and look indifferent, those who wish' other people to mistake them for buyers, stalk in and endeavour to look substantial Over them all clatter and bang the noisy auctioneer, and who feeds his babble, or believes in his fulsome descriptions his extravagant predictions' Worse than all, perhaps, is the sale of pictures or of objects of art or verse Two such sales in the city yesterday, hundreds of lots to be Bold of varying degrees of merit, and who that saw them will say that there was an opportunity of making your inspection or appraisement, or that they gained any information from the tens of thousands of words and repetitions of words poured forth by the auctioneer, or that they admired the old jokes, or escaped uneasiness and offence if they sat the sale out, or even waited half an hour for the chance of bidding for some desired article and then left in disgust It would be as easy to choose a dress from the packed bales of a wholesale wore house, or to form a clear idea of the contents of an old curiosity shop at a glance, as to select and obtain the things desired in either place Muddle and noise the characteristic, heat, bad air, and unpleasant contacts the accessories and loss purely to the vendors, at least, by those chances of profit which perfect arrangements would create It it be asked what should be done, the man who would reform all things says, "I would just build me a hall to contain a thousand people, or if I could not build a hall I would hire one, and in the hall I would erect a stage for proper scenic display, with an ning) draped windows to cast the best lights on all my pictures, with lime lights for effects, and electric lights for cloudy days, and I would get up every subject in which I had to deal or if my natural capacity failed me I would curb my vanity and engage a professor, and I would seat my constituents in comfortable couches and easy chairs and instead of bidding them buy, buy, buy, I would supply them with absolutely convincing reasons why they could not do otherwise than buy, and instead of making declaration, going, going, gone, I would set up some process landing in evident and an unsuitable fashion to a signal of gone which should be irrevocable I would, in fact, change discomfort and offensive areas for luxury and case, medicine man a babble and rant for cultured mystery and artistic per season , I would make my house of sale a house of pleasure , and, as I would retain all the spirit of speculation, of desire, of bargains, of love of business gambling, I would lose none of the existing inducements I would purge away all undesirable accessories, would add every possible refinement, loungers should wait on me women lacking resource should attend me I would " never grow rich, says the business man People who reform ever) thing never do grow rich, and seldom make other people rich I they are outsiders they appeal to sentiments and desires which exist only in their own imaginations Look at the mansion of Brown, the villa of Jones, note the affability of the bank manager to Robinson They are content to do business and let reform alone But seriously and earnestly, is there not room for rational reform in the business of auctioneering' There is an association of auctioneers, why should there not be a worthy auctioneers exchange ' V hy should the total abstainer who desires to purchase be compelled to sell his boot soles with the unholy carpet of an hotel, the man of sensitive olfactory nerves be required to endure the horrid apotheosis of a steak and onions lunch? May should pictures amiss tuary and cabinets and all manner of quaint and curious things be sold as "pigs in pokes.' Banking is no longer done in stuffy parlours and narrow bins , insurance business being, in all its career developments a growth of modern turns, is surrounded by all modern conveniences and refinements, dentists do not propose to j link out teeth 111 back rooiHB of barbers shops, or in the corners about blacksmiths forbes Brokers have been drawn out of their dark and uncanny dons, large dealers 111 the usual way mall commodities meet together and invite their clients to meet them 111 comfort and cleanliness only the auctioneer seeks to sell £20 OOO worth of land, or a thousand quinella worth of oil colour and canvas just as the Dutchman sold his fish and tin Scotchman his 'coo a hundred years ago there will be much present profit to the first man who burns the work of practical reform, and a statue may be 111 some dim future to linn who suggested it
