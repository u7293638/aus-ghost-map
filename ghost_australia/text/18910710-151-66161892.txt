3?ARtY'S GHOST. A Pathetic Balladlo :. 'Twas in the middle of the night, To sleep young William.tried; When Mary's ghost came stealing i4 And stod at his bedside. 0 William dear ! 0 William dear I My rest eternal ceases; Alas ! my everlasting peace Is broken into pieces._ I thought the last of all my cares : Would end with my last minute; But though I went to my long home, I didn't stay long init. The body-snatchers they have conic And made a snatch at me; It's very hard them kind of men Won't let a body be! You thought that I was buried deep, Quite decent like and chary, But from her grave in Mary-bone. They've come and boned your Mary. The arm that used to take your arm Is took to Dr. Vyse; And both my legs are gone to walk The hospital at Guy's. I vowed that you should have my hand But fate gives us denial; You'll find it there, at Dr. Dell's, In spirits and a phial. As for my feet, the little feet You used to call so pretty, There's one I know, in Bedford Row, The t'other's in the City. I can't tell where my head has gone, But Doctor Carpue can ; As for my trunk, it's all packed up To go by Pickford's van. I wish you'd go to Mr.'P. And save me such a ride;. I don't half like the outside place They've took for my inside. The cock it crows-I must be gone.. My William, we must part ! But I'll be yours in death. altho' Sir Astley has my heart. Don't go to weep upon my grave, And think that there I be; They haven't left an atom there Of my anatomic. -Tuosus HooD,
