THE ? PSEUDO COUNT VON ATTEMS AGAIN. The Straits Times, of October 15, gives the following account of this gentleman, in whom a number of persons in Aus tralia still feel a lively interest : — By . the last French mail from Java we have reoeived a copy, forwarded to. U8 from oouraoaya, ot a iegai uuuu taent containing the Judge's summing up of the case on passing sentence on the pseudo Count voq Attems. It is of very great length, hence we have . thought it better to . give only an ab stract of it.' The indictment was on two counts, first for knowingly making use of forged commercial wralings. Second, for 'es caping prison by breaking out. The acc^d, Piose real name is Curt OswaldSchmalg, was born at PMia, in Saxony pn May 24, 1848, andP^after having successfully attended the com mercial school at Plauen, began his . career at (Trieste, where he obtained employment in a counting-house for a while, and continued at the same time his studies at the commercial academy there ; but having incurred many debts lie eecffl&ly; left the city in the 20th year 'pf jM^p, kiud^ent to North America V $k$$: ^ftbr his arrival .in ^ AiiSricft he , enlisted yjjjr.

Ationgat other to&8, he prepared then a forgid letter of recom mendation from the Archduke Albert to the Austrian consulates in Australia and Asia, a foraed permission to travel from the said Archduke and the Austrian Minister of War, a letter of introduction from Anton Count Von Auersperg to H. E. Sir John Young, Governor of New South Wales, a circular letter of credit from the Anglo-Australian Bank to its correspondents in Australia and Asia, and lastly, biUe, in the bill-book brought with him from London, to amounts of £100 and upwards, to the order of Ignaz Coant Von Attems, with the forged acceptances for the An^lo-Ahstrian Bank of the j abovenamed MessrafBeau mon t and Breuer payable by the bankers Glynn and Co., at London, and drawn by the Austrian j Minister of Finances, ,Von Beeke,-Jbn j which IthfjilustriaQ arms were printed on ; thp margM iriftblaclc ink, with a stamp produced at tbe trial and stcg|Kl by tbe accused to have been boui^bt apHarseilles. Across the bills the words ' No ,' ' Ac- ' cepted,' ' Payable at,' ' Director,' were | printed behind the signiture of Mr. Beaumont, ' General Manager,' behind that of Mr, Breuer, and at the foot ' K; K. Fmanz Ministerium' above the sig SKture of the Minister Karl Von Beeke. Whenever he had need of mongjr he cut out more of these bills from book, and furnished with his endorsement as Count Ignaz Von Attems, he sold them to several bankers, and djd so to the amount altogether of Ifpout £6500; qHltr which he, when he saw'thp. ^o& gmes must be discovered, boughKmm| fitted out at Brisbane a yacht named' the Hamlet's Ghost, with which he steered for Java,' with a crew enlisted by himsfilf. ^Having come off Timor, and feeling fli . want - of provisions and money to. pay, his menj.he ran into Ku pang and there endorsed to J.' H. de Siso, a trader, . two of tLe bills prepared in' Australia, One for £100 and the other for £200, for which he asserts that he received mostly cash. When he at last arrived. at Sourabaya; he went to the British Consul, pretending to be Count Ignaz von Attems. By means of the Consul he came into communication with the Agent of the Rotterdam Bank there, and sold to him for the opening of a credit, two of the bills previously prepared in Australia and cut off his bill bo«aK-r the amounts respectively (^^£200 araT£500t oM^hic^ amounts he bnly reoeived 2700^'^^ cheques drawn by him on the agencyjpi the aforesaid bank at Sourabaya ami! signed with the name of.Ignaz Count von* Attems. Being thereupon detained and afterwards convicted of his mis deeds, he made a full confession of his guilt, which was followed by a lengthy account of his adventures written by himself for the service of justice. This confession, so far as it bore upon the bill for £200, No. 10,327, sold to Mr. de Siso, and the two bills No 10,328 and 10,329, sold to the Rotter dam Bank, was confirmed — 1st; by the witnesses Sech Sahan bin Said Bahmid and P. H. Soeters, agent of the said bank, the first of whom declared under oath that he, by the endorsement of Mr. de Siso, beoame owner of bill No. 10,327, and sold it to the Rotterdam Bank never doubting of itB genuine ness ; and the latter testified that Mr. Van Laer, British Vice Consul at Sou rabaya, made him acquainted with the accused, and tbat he without any sus picion bought from the latter the bills Nos. 10,828 and 10,329, after the said 'Consul had come to his office bringing the bill book of the accused, |||id asking him if he would buv bills from the latter; that he had already paid the accused £2700 for these bills when he was informed from the head agency of the bank at Batavia, to whom the bills had been sent, that there was reason to believe that the accused was the same as the Count Von Schdnborn who com mitted frauds at Amsterdam some months before; that this, when the sus picions were further strengthened, led to the arrest of the accused; that 'Mr. de Siso had reimbursed him for the j amount of the bill he had bought from Bahmid, but that he had never received hack any of the money paid to the ac cused. Secondly, by the declarations made by H. E. Franz Carl Freiherr' von Beeke, Austrian Minister of Fi nances, that his signature appearing on the, aforesaid bills, one of which and photographs of the two others had been shown him, were forged, and that the words ' K. K. Finanz Ministerium' were not usually in use to designate the Austrian Financial Department. Srdly by the declarations made by Messrs. Beaumont and Breuer that their signa tures onjbills No. 10,328 and 10,329, shown tlPfchem photographically, were forged, and neither written by them nor put there by their authorization, co operation or approval ; fourthly, by a declaration made by F.Engelhardt, one one of the directors of the Anglo- Aus- trian Bank and the said F. Breuer, fur nished with an impression of the seal of the said bank and attached to bill No. 10,327, that the signatures of Messrs. Beaumont and Breuer, appearing on the said bill are forgeries.. And lastly, by comparing the aforesaid bills with the blank ones in the bill book, which clearly showed that they are not only identically the same, but had heen also cut out of the said bill book. Then follows the summing up of the facts as to the attempted escape of the accused from prison, and the evidence for the prosecution on that count. Ac cording to what is stated,' when the ac cused was in hospital for medical treat ment in August, 1869, he formed the idea of escaping by flight from further prosecution. For this purpose he made use of a knife which he - had obtained from some one during a former stay at the hospital; and kept it carefully; with this knife he cut out, during eight .successive nights, the wood of the win dow sill to which the iron window bars were fastened, and kept the chips care fully. At last,in the night of the 17th and 18th August in the said year,. when everything was ready, he placed a bench that was in his room upright against the wall 'under the window, climbed on it, drew a bar out of the window, aud. then made his escape through the open ing thus made, leaviug behind the knife and letting himself down by a rope fastened to the nearest bar, which rope had been given him at his own request for hanging his clothes to dry. Before getting down he hid the pulled- out bar under his bed, snd so arranged his pillows that at first sight it might be thought there was someone in tbe bed..^ ; Having eudeavored to swim over the^ river behind the hospital, he diy^| under water on hearing human voices, and, after floating down the stream, he landed and went towards tl^;. (yiy. Finding a Javanese sleeping mis boat in the great river, he awoke him and bade him row towards the sea, and, having arrived in the roads ordered him to row the boat to the coast of Madura. When he heard the boatman say, on arriving at a certain campong, that he was^et able to bring him to Sampang, he (the accused) stepped ashore, paid the boatman six guilders,, and after wards went to Sampang, on a horse lent to him by the head man of the campong ; from Sampang he reached PamakasMjia at length, on a waggon furnished 'ffiffl' by the Assistant-Resident, having nothing else with him than a small bundle containing his clothes and some papers, and wholly without money. At the last named place he repaired to the Resident, and asked him for some post-horses for Sumanap, asserting that he was named Stone, and was captain of marines on board the U. S. ship Hartford, Commodore Howard, which ship had been taking soundings between Bali and Kangean Islands ; he further more asserted that he had been charged to carry over despatches to Sourabaya, and, now that his mission had been ful filled, wished to return on board by way of Sumanap. The said Resident, on hearing this, became suspicious, and caused a controleur to guidegliim to Sourabaya, saying, at the same time, that the ship could not be reached from Sumanap by prahus, after which he was again arrested at Sourabaya and brought back to prison. The accused^nf bis defence admitted the forging anaWttering of the aforesaid three bills, but alleged that the latter, owing to the misdescription of tbe Aus trian Minister of Finances, the spelling of the name of Glynn^nd Co. with two n's instead of one, arid the improper way of sealing, lacked the legal criteria ofbills of Exchange. 'The court held that this de pfience was groundless, tbat the bills con tained the criteria required by the law, that the defects pointed out by the accused were not amongst those set forth in the Commercial Code, and even if it were otherwise it would not prevent the prose cution and condemnation of any one who, af'er forging such bills, should knowingly utter them. The court also denied the truth ot' an assertion made by the accused that of the two crimes laid to his charged he should legally be punished for ;:the graver one only. The Court thereupon proceeded to^pass sentence on him, by taking into con sideration the full confession he had made, his comparative youth at the time of the commission of the crimes, and the seduc tions he 'had been exposed to' during bis very eventful life, thought fit not to punish him with the utmost severity the law allowed. His sentence therefore was, — l&t;, imprisonment for six years in the House of Correction and the payment of a fine of lOOOf., and confinement for five months in case tbe fine be 1 not paid. 2ndly, six months' imprisonment, to begin after the expiration of the foregoing terms. The stamps made use of by him for forging were ordered to be destr oyed. The High Court of Justice, to which thf sentence was referred for revision, in creased the House of^Correction term from six to ten years, but confirmed the remainder.
