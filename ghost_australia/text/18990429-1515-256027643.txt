Vale I Pooh-Bah. The papers say the Perth Pooh-Bah, Our wonderful corooial Czar, AppHed for leave the other day And got a twelve months' holiday. With him we'll drain no parting cup Before he sails for far Yurrup, Yet it grieves us sore to think upon Whate'er we'll do when he is gone. This painful question strikes us muteâ€” How shall we find a substitute To adequately represent The " Principal' and " Resident ?" And perpetrate those little jests, Those most uncommon crowner's quests, And of his pranks iu papers read, Yet nearer take the slightest heed.. Who'll comfort when he's on the foam, Those ancient*) at the Old Men's Home ? Or, will he, in the torrid zone Cure all their ills by telephone ? When horses perish in a fire, Hi6 "ghost" must rouse the public ire, Allowing nothing to be done, But leave them rotting in the sun. While he's away the police will " nary " Find a crowner kind enough to vary Their weary malefactor-catching, By sending them out body-snatching. When corpses lie in cold and wet, The " copper " never feels regret, But guards such horrors unperturbed, To "see that nothing is disturbed." So Farewell, Good-bye, Au Kevoir, You need not hurry hack, Pooh-Bah, 'Tie certain we will shed no tears If you stay away for twelve long years.
