Jack is a little struck by the apitear :ate of this gentleman, who has swung the door baoo rather hastily, aiad is ob serving him with what appears to be a burning gaze, so that for the moment he forgets to speak.

I it co.e. he expected to marry some ti n anld settle down. Tnhy' not now, :.h, n tile Fates semred so propitious? It ended in Jack making h p his mind tlaot he would secretly seek the presence of Jessie Cameron, and if he found her all that her photograph seemed to pro mi.e. he would attempt to win her love lunder another nname. Quite a romantic idea for Jack to con eive.a but he was shrewd enough not to ay a word to his lawyers about it at all. Ills first step was to discover wherel out difficulty he learned she was in Edin burgh. It was just when he was starting for that northern capital that the young American received a mysterious letter, with the postmark of Edinburgh upon the envelope.. Thie Writer, who was undoubtedly a woman, appealed to his love of fair play Sdeclared that-there was a plot on foot to out-general him, and that- those;en gaged in it were unscrupulous in their designs: and finally begged himn. if the I-tter should chance to reach him through his solicitors, to meet . the writer before midnight on the night of May 28, or, if not then; the following night. at the Old Tolbooth, in the Canon gate of Edinburgh, when strange things would be revealed. - Jack puzzled over this missive many tblitles. - He was stron'gly tempted to ask the ad'vice of his lawyers, but compromised by seeking a friend and laying the case iefomre him, with the result tht he left Lindon for the North on the morning of the appointed day, with only the faitlhful Ah Sin for company, and, as a cotirsei.tunece, wr4, see, the twain seeking thi: historic shades of the Canongate w nli the fat Cul hour draws near.. . i much for Buckingham. llis motives are beyond reproach. What share has Howard Spencer in the :atf-air? That is the puzzle with . lhich Jack has been wrestling, and of ',-hikh he now believes he sees the solu t'.n clearly. -:':bnaitediy Spencer knew In some wa:: the full particulars of the matter, and has conceived a gigantic plan, whereby lie may painm himself off at Jack Travers. marry the girl, come into the property, and strike a big thing. And he has corresponded with this guardian of Jessie Cameron. this Spaniard or Cuban, who poses as the girl's stepfather", so that the game has all been cleverly arranged. Jack can look back to an adventure lie had recently, when lie was waylaid by unknown men, robbed of money and papzrs; ind. thrown into a deep canyon to die; but in some almost miraculous manner he caught In a tree-top -and managed to save himself. , Without a doubt Spencer 'us the cause of this attempt on his life, made before the London lawyer found him. Spencer mlust have fled from the region at once. since to this day he looks uDon IJack as having gone over the Styx. and declares himself haunted by his gh-st. Why he did not present himself to the ilawyers before seeking to marry Miss Cameron. Jack never can under stand. but without a doubt he had reasons for It. , With this brief but necessary expla nation, the reader can appreciate Jack's feelings, as he enters the room where be is to meet for the first time the girl who is destined to play such an imiport tanr part in his life. iHe has the happy feeling of a nian who has become the favorite of the gods. for, unless the beneficent winds of a. fair fortune blew his way, how else can he account for the fact of Spencer e-in:: stricken down at his feet, the chance that led Ab Sin to pick.up the all- important packet of letters, and linaily the happy outcome of hic philan thropical resolution to seek the house of seven gables, in order to ,explain the non-appearance of his one-time friend, Iloward Spencer. The picture which still nestles next to) his heart certainly does not flatter Jess.ie Canmeron. Jack swears under hls br''ath that, charming as he had be it'.r.d it prior to this moment, the phtr"'"-,x i' but a wretched1 substtute-' fr,- the o(i"inal. ]" feels her gaze instantly fastened ,utu htim, and is conscious of a burn ing nsation over his face; perhaps it is . hh,-I , if at sunburned young man can ,, gui.ty of such a thing. :is?

It is on Jack's tongue to refute the .laMandh. and tell her he is already well :IllplJfIl t with this world's treasure, no matter how the case of the inheritance goes, but he checks himself just in the iu!k of time. That would be an egregious blunder, for. since her motives are Influenced, only by the desire to help him into his inheritance, she - would undoubtedly withdraw from the agreement if con vinced that her sacrifice is not nece. eary to the state of his exchequer. And. strange as it may appear, such a withdrawal is about the last thing our Iachelor friend desires -at this stage of his infatuation. To call this fair kinswoman his own, even though she vanish from his sight w-ht-n the last words of the ceremony have been said, is just now a consum mnation devoutly to be wished. "Tell." says Jack, smiling, "we cer tainly seem in a position to respect one another for honorable and cousinly mozive?.. I only hope you will not bear ate any other than feelings of compas viol hicauCse Fate .gives me a. pinch of Paradise and then snatches the picture away." tiis , ords can bear but one interpre tation; but she seems to have a burden' on her mind that must be relieved, and at least pretends not lo have heard, thou1lgh possibly what lie said may arise to confront her Inter on and even !,rinr? a sense of comfort. " t;ut what can you think of me in corseanting to such a thing?" she asks, eagerly". - "That, under the circumstances, you are more than kind at rescuing from poverty at such a sacriflee a kinsman you have never seen, and I shall always hold you in the most grateful remem brance. Is it possible to alter the con ditions o'f the agreemenlt?" She looks alarmed at once. "No, no!" shie exclaims. "They must be kept inviolate. Under any other arrangement I would possibly refuse to act." "And, as I understand it, after.. the ceremony that makes us man and wife is completed you pass from my sight for ever?" "For ever." she cghoes. "Unless at some time in the future, should you relent---" "I shall never do that. You under stand. this is merely a business arrange ment, and sentiment does not enter into it at all," she interposes. Jack only smiles quietly. That was what he himself thought, only to find out his mistake; and he has sh5oflg hopes that she will also in time. (To be continued.)
