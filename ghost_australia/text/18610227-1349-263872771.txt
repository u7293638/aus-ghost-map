THE YASS ANNUAL RACES. To the Editor of the ) 'use Courier. So, Sin, the pr gramme of your annual races is out at last — and a precious pro gramme it is! This distiict used to he famed P.r its liheralitv in ge-ting up good raees, by means of offering good piizes and liberal terms tinder which the h rses ran ; but in the hill of fare which the sapient there are are neither go -d. prizes n rlihe-al tirms. One of the stakes — that which I pointed out as deserving f at leas! half n century to lie run for— I alluded" tlmr for two- yeiir-olds, is actually only a twen-y- fire pounder , and not content with fixing it at this beggarly sum, I. tit the stewmds have made the condition that the animal had never w. n hef-ov ! AAMpv, sir, y. u ami everyone who has the slightest knowledge of trial stakes must km w that it is, in sporting plnaseol gy, "ip race at all." Two-year-old winner; are open to run ami win all over the country (tinrring Yass), until they cease to lie such, ami no one except -the sporting sages who framed the programme would say anything else. If you turti to the "meet" at S nth Gunda- gai yon will find that the trial stakes there inn lor 20 s vs., with a sweep of £1 10s. added, without the previous winning con dition. I am afraid your races will he a sorry affair. .2. Yoiu-s, in the spirit of the turf,- THE GHOST OF JORROCKS, . , Yass P.iains, Monday.
