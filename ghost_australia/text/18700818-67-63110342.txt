J A FRENCH GHOST STOltY. Galignani tells a curious story respecting" tho trial of a small farmor named Dflster, of tho Department of Has llhin, for a breach of tho Game Laws. A peasant returning homo late ono night, saw, as ho thought, the horned head of a frightful monster in a pool, which ho had tu poss. Uo rushed breathless to the village with an alarming account of tho demon, and ii band of villagers immediately sall i od forth with weapons. When they came to the pond thoy saw the creature, arri Plister fired at it. It turned out to bo only a stag which had gone into the pond for cool- ness. As tho harm was done, the body was cut up and divided, and tho village feasted. However, the authorities heard of tho story, and Piistcr was prosecuted for a breaoh of the game laws, tho shoot- ing season having closed. An advocato who defended him callod attention to tho fact that on tho same day as that on which tho offenco had been committed the Prince Imperial hud shot a stag in the foroat of Fontainebleau, that all tho journals j had recounted the exploit, and that no judicial pro- ceedings had been instituted against his Imperial Highness. The advocate did not desire the applica- tion of the law against tho Prince, but only asked for indulgence in conaequonco of tho coincidence. Howovor, tho tribunal was properly impressed with tho difftrenco between a prince and a farmer, and condemned Pfistor to 601V. fine, and tho payment of costs, ordoriug also the gua to bo confiscated. Under tho circumstances a ghost would havo been the more satisfactory antagonist.
