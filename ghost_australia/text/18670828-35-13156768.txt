j SYNOD OF THE DIOCESE OF SYDNEY. THE Synod, pursuant to adjournment, re-assembled yesterday afternoon, in the Church Society's Room, Phillip street Minutes of preceding meeting read and confirmed. QUESTIONS SYNOD A63PÍ>SHE\T -The Rev H A. PALMER, asked " What measures can or will be taken by this Synod to procure the payment of assessment from those parishes or districts which are at present defaulters 3 '-The BISHOP said he thought it was the intention of Mr Metcalfe to bring forward a resolution on this subject CiiUttOii SOCIETY -late Rev G E IDAI asked " Whether, in the proposed ordinance for the constitution of the Church Society clause 4 applies only to auxiliary associations of the Church Society or to all parochial associations which have been established for local objects ?' -The BISHOP said (presuming the rev. gentleman meant No 4 in the regulations for parochial associations) that it applied only to auxiliaries in connexion with the Church Society HOLY COMMUNION -Mr GEORGE HIRST asked, 1 Is it true that in some of the churches in Sydney the Holy Communion is administered to a large number of com- municants collectively, and, if such is the case, has the practice the sanction of the Bishop of the Diocese-" The Bishop said it was a fact that the Holy Communion was administered in the manner spoken of in the question, and it was also a fact that the sanction of the Bishop of the Diocese had not been asked, MARRIAGE QUESTION Pursuant to order of the day, the Synod resolved itself into Committee for the further consideration of the report of the Committee on the Marriage Question The section under discussion was No 2, "That persons be allowed to have their marriage solemnized in any church or parish which they may prefer, without respect to and Eco in that parish " Mr A STUART hoped some means would be suggested of getting out of the difficulty raised in respect of the canon > quoted last evening, a difficulty which stood in the way of a change all would consider a desirable one The objection appeared chiefly to be founded on some old canon, which might to some extent be binding upon the clergy. But many of these canons were now obsolete, and in the whole body there were some which, if strictly carried out, would leadtoverj great means offence He believed that in England there did exist some means of getting over the difficulty so as to admit of marriages being solemnised in churches other than parish churches If by the Bishops' Meengo banns could be dispensed with, he could not see why such license could not be extended to the solemnisation of marriages in any churches not parish churches from those learned in ecclesiastical law, he heard that such a dispensing Dower remained with the Bishop If so, it was quite competent for the Synod to pass this resolution As to the desirability of the change, that matter having been clearly demonstrated last evening, it would be superfluous to say anything more on the subject. He begged to move, as an amendment, that after the first word the following words be inserted,-' by license from the Bishop " The Rev H Kiva suggested that it be by "special" license, the ordinary license not seeming to cover the powers sought to be obtained. Mr A fcriAUT adopted this suggestion The Rev J VAUOHVN offered some general observations in support of the resolution Mr CONSETT Si El HPN pointed out that ifthooanons were binding at all the Synod could, under its 27th con stitution, pass an ordinance abrogating any that stood in its vi day Mr RICH in) JOHNSON thought it desirable to pass this resolution if no could do so But he should be sorry to pass a resolution abrogating any canon unless it was absolutely necessary There must be some power in the Church to grant licenses for the solemnisation of marriages in other than parish churches That power was deputed to the Metropolitan, and he thought there could be no difficulty in passing the amendment The Rev G VIDAL signified his assent to much that fell firm Mr Consett Stephen, and took much the BBIUOVIOW. Accordingly it was his intention in to vote for the motion as it now stood It appeared to be precisely one of those cases con t acted with the local management in respect of which we should be free to act as suited the peculiar circumstances of the Church in this colony. The 27th constitution was a sufficient safeguard against deviating from es central features in the government the Church of England, whilst it did not so fetter us as to leave us without hope that we might succeed in adopt in the spirit of the Church of England to the altered circumstances of the colony in which we found ourselves He believed all would soon realise the fact that it would be utterly impossible to impose or enforce, for any length of time, laws suitable only to a Church in alliance with the State, upon a Church which was, in point of fact, and (f dared to be, in the position of a voluntary association There were no laws more stringent than those which related to public worship in England, but all could understand that in this country, with its immense and thinly pi opled interior, they could not be strictly complied with As the Synod should most steadfastly adhere to everything material and vital in her connection with the Church, it ought not to be so fettered by rules in minor matters as finouBij to cripple the action of the Church Mr 1/ RoiiEiiTsoN recommended this resolution as the only means of getting rid of a very great evil, and said they (ought not to be turned by those ghosts of canons They had the law in their own hands, and he hoped they would exercise it Mr Kicui»i> Jews o»ailn»i«>B.,j"iii..mmiita. would be breaking any canon by passing the rea lution V o had nothing to do with the canons and the resolution ii light be placed The Rev. G N WOODII said his rev friend Mr Vi lad had stated that the Church in this colony was merely a v luntary association He held in his hand a copy of the Governor's commission and instructions The sixteenth it struction read thus -" And, whereas, we have by divers L Itcrs Patent, under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, erected within our said colony two bishoprics, entitled respectively, the Bishopric of Sydney, and the Bishopric of Newcastle It is, therefore, ( i r will and pleasure, that in the administration of the Government of our said colony of New South Wales, you do give the most particular attention to all such matters as the erection of the said bishoprics hath rendered necessary And it is our pleasure that you do appoint provisionally, and until our pleasure be known, to such spiritual cures as it ay from time to time become vacant, and you are to consult with the said Bishops upon all questions that may arise touching the celebration of divine worship, or the performance of any peculiar ecclesiastical rites and ceremonies, or touching the stipends or allowances of the inferior clergy " VA as it possible, he asked, that such instructions were intended to apply to any voluntary associations Mr W rosTKii said that when the Chancellor was asked the other evening whether there were or were not, in this colony parishes within the meaning of the canons of the Church of England, the Chancellor stated that we had on ecclesiastical district which was binding for certain pur roses The answer was altogether wide of the question. The question the committee had to decide, before coming to a determination with regard to the motion or amendment, was whether or not there was such a thing as a parish church in the colony If there was no such thing as a parish as it existed in England, then the laws relating to parishes had no force in the colony It would be observed that in the Church Temporalities Act not only were parish's not named, but the parochial system was wholly ignored in the Act By law in the colony, a clergyman was only the parish clergyman of such persons as by their own free will chose to place themselves within his cure In England clergyman was the parish clergyman of every one who lived within his parish It was impossible therefore to say that parishes in the colony were the same as pinches at home The law relating to parishes only applied so far as it was practicable He objected to the difficulty being done away with in some indirect manner If they found the law operate mischievously, they ought to refer the matter to the authorities at home, and wait until something could be done there which would have the effect of legalising what was wished to be done in this colony He, however, was of opinion that such a step was unnecessary. There was no Act in existence in the colony which viewed parishes in the same light in which they were viewed in England In this colony, hands had occasionally, by permission of the Bishop, only been published once I hut was contrary to the canons, and if it was competent for the Bishop to override one canon, it was also competent for him to override another. He intended to support the original motion The Rev H. S, KING drew attention to the eighth clause of the Constitutions, which certainty, he thought, recognised parishes and cures of souls The Church Tem- poralities Act was intended for an especial purpose, and the repeal of many of its provisions was no doubt desirable Mr M H STEPHEN hoped that the Synod would affirm that the canons were not obligatory and not binding in this colony. There was not a clergyman in the colony who did not every Sunday break one or other of the canons, The Rev. THOMAS SMITH said he supposed the Bishop acted in conformity with law and by the advice of the highest legal authority in the diocese, when he altered the canon having reference to the hours in which marriages should take place. By an Act passed in the reign of Henry % III. the power was reserved to Bishops to alter the hours It was clear that if the canons were not binding upon the Bishop they were not binding upon the clergy. He would like to know in what canon it was provided that seven days' residence were necessary for the making of parishioners The canon in regard to the hours had, to all intents and purposes, been broken, and if it was right to break one part of it, he did not see what should preclude the breaking of another part He should vote for the question as it stood Mr A. GOOTJON said it was impossible for him to take up and answer the many different views which had been put forward. The question to be determined was, whether or not the canons of GOd were binding in this colony. The Church Discipline Act of the colony was passed for a particular purpose, and had very little to do with what might be called the general parochial arrangement of the Church. But because that Church Act did not recognise the parochial system, was the parochial system to be set aside entirely a It had been rightly stated by one learned gentleman, that parishes did not exist in this colony in the same legal sense in which they existed _ England The word parish had two signifies lions. It had a legal signification, and it had also a distinct ecclesiastical signification In the colony it was used in its ecclesiastical signification, and in that respect was the same as in the ecclesiastical law of England. "" The canons of 1603 had no more force in England over the laity than they had in this colony He affirmed most solemnly, that the clergy of this colony, taking their license as they did, from the Bishop-who had taken the oath of canonical obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury could not throw off their obedience to the canons of the Church of England. The committee and the Synod might do what they liked, but it would not alter the position of the clergy There was this difference between common law and ecclesiastical law no canon of the law of the Church which had fallen in desuetude can be revived except by authority And when the clergy were twitted by a previous speaker with having broken the canons, that gentleman forgot that canons were not broken when they had fallen into desuetude It was urged by others that the canon respecting the limitation as to marriage within certain hours had been broken There was no de ubi to his mind that the Bishop possessed the power of altering those appointed hours But the question whether the Bishop had power to alter the canon with reference to place-na contemplated by the motion before the Synod was to him a question of more doubt. His opinion was strongly in favour of the power of the Bishop to grant such license If they did not intend to throw aside those obliga- tions which he believed the clergy of this colony as ministers of the Church of England were under, they a did not properly pass the motion as it originally stood. He thought they would be correct in passing it in its modified form, as proposed by Mr Stuart, Mr R JONES said the objections seemed to resolve themselves into two classes - constitutional and technical There was, he believed, no mention in the constitutions of the canons of the Church of England, and he thought it would hardly be contended that the cane could be considered as formularies He did not think they were precluded by the constitutions from dealing with the question as proposed by the Dean He should like to know with regard to the canons of 1603, whether they were binding on the Church, and, if not, by what authority they had been practically repealed P None of them, in his opinion, had been repealed by competent authority) They were found to be no longer adapted to the requirements and condition and the Church And on that ground, he thought in this colony they ought to fall into disuse He did not see why we any more than our brethren at home, should be required to upheld canons which were found to interfere with the rights of the Church The matter did not touch their faith or ritual The particular canon seemed to have had in view the pre- vi tion of clandestine marriages And no harm could arise from allowing the canon to fall into disuse in the colony. He should vote for the original motion He preferred the resolution very much in its original form is that the proposal was to give every consideration to what was directly brought before them as a Synod, and to transmit the resolution they might finally arrive at as to what they might deem expedient to the Bishop, leaving U to the Bishop to act as he might think right in regard to the same He hoped that the fa) and would make every effort so to modify existing arrangements that the people of their communion might be permitted to get married wherever they should think beat the DEAN OF SYDNEY had listened attentively to all the arguments which had been brought forward by his rev. brethren and other members of the Synod that day and on the previous evening, and deemed it right to say that he proposed to vote for the amendment, although he had (as being in charge of the resolutions submitted in the report of the Standing Committee) moved the resolution as printed He had himself always carefully observed the provisions of the canon in regard of the celebration of marriages in his parish, and had always been careful to respect the ecclesiastical boundaries of the parishes under the care of his rev brethren At the same time, he was very strongly impressed with the grave necessity that there was for affording such facilities for the solemnisation of matrimony between members of their Church as might tend to prevent them from resorting to the clergy of other Churches to be married He hoped that there would be a unanimous vote, believing that what was BO decided upon would have a much greater weight The Rev A. H bTFi HFN desired to know what the Dean meant by a special license -1 If it was meant by that the house was to be one that the clergymen render avail i be at once, he should vote for the amendment, but if it was meant that a special case was a license, to get which the current would have to refer to the Bishop, then he should vote for the original motion The Dean of SYDNEY explained that a special license at front a license for certain parties to be married by a clergy - n us at any time and place A "A voice By whom is the been so to be issued The Dean of EVDNEI It must be obtained from the Bishop Mr Mr C war i E said it appeared to him that the effect of the amendment would be to forge anew the old chains under the grievance of which they all complained He had recently noticed, with much pain, that the restrictions under which people laboured from tho state of the marriage law in England were producing in that country a very lamentable effect. It WMB therefore most particularly undesirable that any such restrictions should be imposed, or deliberately continued here where such restrictions were still more inapplicable to Yorkshire-as he had recently seen it stated with deep regret the marriages of members of the Church of England, through those obnoxious difficulties there, had been sensibly decreased, whilst there had, for the same reason, been a corresponding increase of purely secular marriages before the registrar, to make the marriages subject to any special license Would be practically to perpetuate nearly all of the existing difficulties What would the Bishop know about the case in which his special license should be asked The Leicht he away in Wellington and know no more about the matter than the Man in The Moon. (A laugh ) Mom bra of the Church of Frowd had, he contended, n just send it to l a married in whatever church they liked, and when they liked, provided that (he marriage so celebration was not solemnised IB a clandestine manner Mr ALEXANDER STC AI T asked leave to withdraw the weld "sieciMl, which he had rather hastily agreed to nil pt, at the suggestion of some of the members of the bay near the Rev George VIDAL objected to the withdraw ii of the word special from the amendment before the Synod IheBiMtoi hoped that the Rev Mr Vidal would not lLtiet on his election to the withdrawal of that word He had understood that the word " special only referred to a certain specially, and that it was not contemplated to make a direct reference to him in every case It would be practically of no particular importance which was car- and, the original motion of the amendment The Rev Mr. VIDAL regretted to say that he could not agree to withdraw his objection to the withdrawal of the word special be question was then Mit-to insert the words " By s] equal license in the amendment, and that question was tpeotived Mr ALLWM'IU STCAKT then moved that the words inserted by " By license from the Bishop of the Diocese Mr SI, H SrFiiiFN could not see what was the use of the amendment, if it was indifferent whether that of the original motion was carried The amendment was put and negatived, and the original motion was thereupon put and carried The Di AN next moved, that it is expedient that the hours within which marriage may be celebrated be extended to 3 o'clock in the evening' This question had virtually!) been decided in the race utions already armed at He considered the resolution necessary as a further removal of the restrictions with regard to marriage the resolution agreed to the text resolution was -"that it is expedient that by license from the Bishop of the diocese, marriages may be solemnised in private houses in cases where one or both of the parties to be manned resides at least five miles from the nearest church the DEAN explained that this was intended to meet the case of persons in the country who might be placed in the circumstances stated the Rev H A FVLMI K moved that the words by license from the Bishop of the Diocese" be omitted, for the purpose of putting the resolution on the same footing as those that had preceded it, and to place those in the country who could not conveniently or within a reasonable time get sties license in the same position as parties in town The Rev Mr PRIDDLE seconded the amendment Mr M MLTCVLIE inquired what the practice was at present Mr B viikEH understood that it did not require special li sense to marry in private houses The words were struck out, and the resolution, as amended, agreed to the Di VN moved,-" that the Bishop of the diocese be requested to give effect to the foregoing (four) resolutions as early as practicable " Mr. METCALFE seconded the motion, which was put and agreed to The DEAN then moved That it is desirable that application be made to the Legislature for the amendment of the Marriage Act in two particulars-urBtly, that twenty four hours' notice should be required to be given by the parties who may be desirous to be married, before the ceremony is performed and further that a declaration should be required to be made to include the fact that the parties are both of the full age of twenty-one years, or in the event of either of them being under that age, that the consent produced is the consent of and signed by the parent or guardian duly qualified to grant such consent. The Dean explained that as the law now stood marriages might be celebrated without previous notice, either by ministers of religion or by registrars This practice had been found to be pregnant with very serious evils and liable to great abuses to hasty, inconsiderate, and even illegal marriages, as was shown in evidence It was thought that such, an amendment of the Act as was here proposed would operate as a security against these improprieties, and he hoped the Legislature would accede to the alteration, so as to prevent improper and unlawful marriages, which commonly led to much social mischief and unhappiness. He thought it would also be desirable to prevent hasty marriages before registrars The requirement of a declaration as to ago would prevent the calamity of young people being beguiled into marriages before they were able to form a sound judgment on the important responsibilities they were about to undertake Mr W RtssELL moved, as an amendment, that the notice be forty-eight hours The omission of the words " twenty-four hours having been assented to, The Rev P. SMITH moved that the notice be " three days." The committee agreed to the insertion of " forty eight hours," and the resolution as so amended was agreed to, The Rev. A H. STEPHEN, moved "That inasmuch as the Secretary and Registrar is charged with duties which, in a greater or less degree, relate to every parish in the diocese, and whereas by resolution of this committee the fees heretofore received by that officer are to be abolished, it is the opinion of this committee that a contribution from each parish should be made towards the support of the office in question." Mr A biUAi T s carried the motion. Mr. S SMITH thought it desirable that the committee should be Stormed at to what the duties of the secretary and registrar of the diocese were, what the income had been during the last two years and how far the abolition of the marriage fees would interfere with the emoluments of the office Mr It. JOM<\- did not think they should embarrass the proceedings of this stage with the matter, which did not form part of the recommendations of the committee The prefers his c( urEe would be to give notice of the motion for some other day | The motion was withdrawn with a view to bringing it forward in another shape The five resolutions passed were reported to, and adopted by the Synod ORDER 01 I UOCPFDtNOS Mr. RenTON moved - "That the reports of sub con mittees appointed by the Synod and all reports and drift ordinances prevented by the standing committee in pursuance of resolutions of the Synod, shall take precedence of all other matters " The Rev R S "WinIS supported the resolution on the gun and that it would effect a saving of time. The Rev G VIDAL thought all practical business ought to take precedence of abstract questions Mr, R JONES saw considerable objections to the course proposed That all really important business should be disposed of before business of less importance, was no doubt very desirable, but members of the Synod would not properly in exercising jealousy of their individual rights, and in not surrendering to any committee to prescribe what should be dealt with by the Synod and what cast aside There was a danger of their drifting too the power of the Standing Committee On these grounds he felt unable to give his support to the motion The resolution was negatived CATHEDRAL CONSTITUTION Mr A GORDON, as chairman of the committee appointed last session to take into consideration the subject of the present condition and prospects of St Andrew s Cathedral, including the best mode of constituting the Cathedral body, and generally of rendering the Cathedral available to the completeness of the ecclesiastical arrangement of the Diocese, and to report thereon to the Synod at its next session, moved the adoption of the report agreed to by the committee That report stated last, with regard to the present condition of the Cathedral, ' 1 So far as the fabric is concerned the cathedral will, speaking generally, be in a condition to be opened for public worship so soon as the flooring now on its way from England, shall arrive and be laid down, and the eastern window, also on its way from England, shall arrive and be put in The cattle at when thus opened will however, be far from complete, and a large sum of money in addition to what has been already expended will be necessary to finish the work 2 The site of the cathedral is vested in the Bishop of Sidney and his successors as sole trustee by grant from the Crown, dated the 15th day of January, 1856 Second, j in reference to the prospects of the cathedral, ' 1 A piece of land in George street, Sydney, together with certain buildings thereon, was by deed dated the 2nd January 1839, vested in the late Bishop of Sydney and his successors as trustees upon trust to apply and expend the facts In and towards the building and erecting of the cathedral then erecting until the same should be finished and completed for the due celebration of public worship therein, and when and so soon as the cathedral should be so finished and completed for the celebration of public worship, then upon further trust as the Bishop might think fit, proper, or necessary to dispose of, apply, and expend the rents in and trw rds the support, maintenance, upholding, and repairs of the building, decorations, ornaments, and furniture of the Cathedral for the purpose of public worship Your com- mit i co have been informed by the Bishop that this property has been leased at an annual rent of WOO (the net rental bring about £280) that the rents have been hitherto partially expended in the erection of the Cathedral, in re p v ments to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel on account of a loan of £3000 made by them to the Cathedral building fund, in supplying a sum of £1000 te vi Erda the expense of the flooring of the Cathedral, and a sum of 25 towards the cost of the east window of of a Cathedral, being the memorial window to the late BY shop and that the balance amounts at present to the sum of £900 or thereabouts This balance, is according to the trusts of the deed, applicable to the crumple the of the building, and so soon as the Cathedral shall be opened for the celebration of public worship the PI tual rents will be available towards the support and repairs of the fabric and the decoration ornaments and furniture of the Ca hedral 2 the rents just mentioned, together with the offertory, which will be a natural conse- quiLcoof the Cathedral being opened for public worship, f mi the only funds which can at present be reckoned upon for the future support of the Cathedral Third, with regard to the best mode of constituting the Cathedral body the c i miller, having devoted to the subject much care and attention, submitted for the consideration of the Synod a mr stitution, which would be found attached to the report of our h The committee had also considered in what manner the constitution drawn up by them might be practically carried into effect, and on this subject the following sugges- tims were submitted for the consideration of the synod - ' 1 That an annual sum be raised towards defraying the expenses of the celebration of public worship in the Cathedral by a contribution from the several parishes of the diocese 2 That a special effort be immediately made to create an endowment of not less than 600 a year with a residence for the Dean and an endowment of not less than face a TOOK- far the Precentor, and, pending the erection of this endowments, to make an annual provision to the like extent 3 That on endowment of not less than £100 per oz sum be created for each of the clerical Canons " Fif h With regard to the manner in which the Ca hedral might be made to promote the completeness of the ecclesiastical arrangement of the diocese the committee were not in a position to offer any practical recommend a in and considered it premature to enter upon the subject until the Cathedral should have taken its place as an a usually existing institution in the diocese Should the Synod deem further consideration of this report necessary, it night be deferred till another session, or referred to the Sti using Committee The consequences of such delay, however in determining the constitution of the cathedral would of course be a delay in opening it Until they had the constitution formed the Cathedral was not in a state to to be opened for the purposes of such an institution He now moved the adoption of the report, and then he should move that the Synod go into committee to consider the con str ution Motion put and agreed to. Mr. A O on DON moved that the President leave the cbk E, and the by and resolve itself into committee, for the federation and adoption of the report on the Cathedral constitution Mr M H. STEPHEN moved, as an amendment, that the consideration of the matter stand over until the next session of the Synod The amendment was seconded by the Rev THOMAS Dunn, and, on its being put to the Synod, was carried. Brun ncvL RETURNS Mr ALIA v\Dtn Sir uir laid before the Synod the ht tactical returns of the Church of England in the diocese", and moved that they be published with the proceedings of the Synod for distribution throughout the diocese It had, he had, been stated in the report which was laid before the Synod last week that the returns were somewhat in con plete But he was happy to state that during the time the food had been sitting, many of the returns had been an ended but still the returns remained incomplete The statistics contained a return of the number of licensed clergymen, number of catechists or lay readers, number of consecrated or licensed buildings, amount of pew rents amount of offertory and other collections in the cb and amounts raised from other sources In p nth or districts, ordinary attendances at Divine services number of communicants, attendance at six and Sunday schools, number of baptisms, m:,mt>gee, burials, and confirmations Seventeen parishes had not sent in returns The total amount of pew rents received was £7104 19s 3d The offertory and other collections amounted to £11 323 His ; the total amount raised from other source s was 2lb 684 7s 7d The total amount nu ed was £30 122 17s 10d The sum of £8418 18s 4d was not included in the above returns, owing to the inform the respecting the money not being complete There was also) a sum of 31st 2s 7d raised as a cathedral fund not included So far as they had been able to ascertain, the amount of money from all sources raised in the dress was about £39 200 In this amount the Glebe funds were not included, nor (lose the money raised for house rent in lieu of parsonage, appear, so that the approximate sum raised was about £10 000 A special collection of £2000 for the Cathedral organ £370 for the Cathedral font, and other valuable gifts to the Cathedral, would swell the total amount raised in the diocese to about to 000 The amount the Church received from the State was but a small portion of its revenue, and every year that amount was diminishing Year by year, however, the Church was better enabled to support itself The number of attendants at churches was not very correct as it appeared in the returns This was owing to a mia apprehension which had existed on the port of the clergy- men with reference to what was required of them. The committee hoped that in future, more correct returns would be obtained To that end the con n ittee had prepared a certain blank form, which the Bishop would circus site to every clergyman in the parish to be filled up The Rev A H STI THEN said that when asking for the returns last session, he had merely wished to get the information in the street but as it had been prepared in detail, much valuable and interesting information had been laid before the Synod. Specking approximately, the Church in this colony would, in his opinion, bear favourable comparison with the Church in England and else- where The Rev H S KING suggested the desirability of having a column in the forms for recording the debts and liabilities of parishes, as well as their income The Rev. T SMITH thought it was very necessary there should be a column for recording the amounts collected for repairs and alterations of churches and schools The Rev G H MORETON considered that as the returns were somewhat imperfect, it would be advisable not to print them for circulation The printing of them would probably cause dissatisfaction to those churches who had not sent in the full information The motion of Mr STUART was then put and passed ADHERENCE TO CONSTITUTION Mr M. CONSETT STEPHEN., pursuant to notice, moved, -" 1 That it is expedient that members of the Synod and the clergy and officers of the Church should sign a form of declaration of their adherence to the fundamental constitu- tions, and of submission to the ordinances and rules of the Synod 2 That " be referred to the Standing Committee I to settle snob, form. of declaration, and submit the same to the api royal of that Synod He had asked a question of the Bishop bearing on his subject some time since, and although he did not quite remember the exact words in which he had been answered by his lordship, he had tethered from that reply that the subject was one which was not unworthy of the police of the Synod It was at least highly) expedient that the written signature of every person who should become a member of the Synod, or A clergyman, one Deer of the Church in this colony, choir A be given HIS a means by which the adhesion of such person or persons should be made distinctly manifest It would be rrmcrnbeied.at the auguration of the proceedings which had resulted in synodical action there had been some difference of opinion, and that Iba expediency of the use of denatured as the due expression of the adhesion of all parties to a cor . um course and of their willingness to be bound by the local regulations of the Church in the diocese had been strongly insisted upon It was very desirable that such a written signature should be exacted from all such parties as he had referred to It was not only necessary to have the power of enforcing obedience to the rules and regulations of the Synod by the law (as it stood but it was also very noces finy to have inn e explicit assent given to the regulations made by the Church Mr MACDOUGAL seconded the motion Mr A GORDON opposed the motion, and in support of his opinion quoted (be last proviso of the fifth constitution for the management and good government of the Church in this colony. Mr M E MVIMN hoped the Right Rev President would put the question, if he should further delay to do so they would only have more speeches made (A laugh ) Mr M CONSETT STEPHEN did not know why the matter should not be discussed Mr MERLIN Because the Chancellor says that the thing is sufficiently secure as the case now stands that the law is sufficient without such additional signatures Mr M CONSETT STEPHEN Who says so ? Mr MLKMN The Chancellor. Mr M CONSETT STEPHEN had every respect for that gentleman's opinion, but differed altogether from him on this point The question was put and negatived without a division WIDOWS AND 64tH NS Mr, ROLLESTON rose to move the adoption of the report of the Standing Committee of the Synod of the diocese of Sydney on the establishment of a Clergy Widows and Orr bans' Fund" He regretted that it should have devolved upon him, instead of the Rev. Canon Allwood, to move the adoption of the report, because he felt sure that that rev gentleman would have better expressed what had been the conclusions arrived at by the Committee upon this important subject The Committee had come to the unanimous conclusion that the matter was one in which all the sisper dioceses of the colony should be associated in the proposed plan They felt that it would be impossible that any such scheme could be effectually carried out which did not in the first place emanate from Sydney. The committee were of opinion (1st) that as this was a subject in which all the clergy of the colony were interested it were desirable that one general society embracing all the dioceses in the colony should be established, and (2nd) that the constitution of such society should be considered and determined by the representatives of the several dioceses assembled in Provincial Synod He had called upon the Mutual Provident Society to see if any plan could be devised in connection with that society by which provision might be made for assuring the lives of the clergy, but the had found that the rules of that society would not admit of their entertaining the proposition for the assurance of the see of the clergy on any different footing to that of other persons He had been also there informed that there were several of the clergy whose lives were altogether un- insurable About £3000 at least, would be required to assure the lives of the clergy in the sum of ¿bOO in each case Mr Rolleston further explained what was the course which the committee suggested for adoption by the Synod, It was proposed that each parish should contribute 25, and that the amount should be funded to make up a reserve fund, with which to make due provision for the clergy widows and orphans Mr Rolleston entered into a variety of particulars as to the difficulties which stood in the way of the establishment of the clergy widows and orphans' fund, and then proceeded to detail the eight le llowing suggestions -(1 ) That the fund shall be under the management of a Board of Trustees, to be appointed by the Provincial Synod (2) That an annual subscription of five pounds be required from each clergyman licensed to a cure of souls in the colony, such subscription to commence within six months after the fund shall have been established, or in case of clergymen newly entering any of the dioceses within six months from date of their license, and the widows and orphans of subscribing clergymen only shall, under any circumstances, be entitled to participate in the benefits of the fund, (3.) That every parish or ecclesiastical district shall be required to raise, in aid of the fund, was not), in such manner as the parishioners may elect, a man not less than five pounds for each clergyman employed in the parish or district, and that, in addition thereto, subscriptions and donations be invited fromtholtit) (4) That two-thirds of the entire income of the fund to be thus found shall be funded at interest for a period not less than ten years, and that under no circumstances whatever shall the trustees permit any demands to be made upon such ' reserve fund until the expiration of that period (of That the remaining one-third shall be set apart to satisfy claims of widows and orphans that may arise after the establishment of the fund, and all expenses which may be incurred in its management, of 1 coming in Vu> ,T,xroolnH at rewrote her both principal and interest to be available for payment of claims to ). That after ten years the interest from the reserve fund, together with the whole of the annual contributions shall be available as required to meet current claims (7 ) that, with the consent of the present trustees, any sums now set apart, or devised, or dedicated, for the maintenance of the widows or orphans of the clergy, shall, as soon as the present claims full in be added to the reserve fund, provided, however, that the interest accrue n g therefrom shall be at all times available for current claims (83 bat an annual report and statement of the receipts and expenditure of the fund shall be had before the Provincial and Diocesan Synods Mr ROLLESTON was proceeding to speak to the bed of these " suggestions," when Mr R JONES suggested that the better course of proceeding would be to entertain the two first expressions of opinion which were set forth in the report, Mr C ROLLESTON acceded to the suggestion of Mr. R. Jones, and moved,-" (1st) That as it was a subject in which all the clergy of the colony were interested, it was desirable that one general society, embracing all the dioceses in the colony, should be established, and (2nd) That the constitution of such society should be considered and determined by the representatives of the several dioceses assembled in Provincial Synod " The motion having been seconded, The Rev PERCY SMITH rose to move an amendment, but was received with cries of " adjourn, adjourned " He was quite willing to agree to an adjournment, if such should be the pleasure of the Synod "With a a view to test that, he begged to move an adjournment of the debate Mr Sun HEM) SMITH seconded the motion, which, being put to the vote, was carried. Several notices of motion were given, and then the Synod Blood adjourned at a quarter past 12 o'clock) until to-morrow (Wednesday) at half-past 3 pm.
