The Advertiser. THURSDAY, JULY 24, 1879. MR. FRASER'S motion to open the Insti-<*> tutes and Museums on Sundays between 1 p.m. and sunset, was partially debated on the 23rd instant, in the House of Assembly. Mr. Fraser introduced his reso lution in a moderate and by no means pre tentious speech, but he brought forward many of^he arguments which the nature of iheyease has required, and illustrated ■them by ha own experiences as practically a working man. The case, however, is one wbiea if rightly considered requires little argument. It doss not demand elaborate ireasoningtofihow that on any given day of the 'weekrational and intellectual amusement lire both of them necessary to keep the {human mind in healthy tone; and that {whether it is the first or the seventh (day of the week does not affect slie case. Mr. Eraser wisely did not enter into any theological view of %he subject His temperate and judicious Remarks dealt with the certain .good which iwould accrue to those, who now spend Sunday afternoons -or badly, find who would not do so if {hey had the opportunity of using' their Sunday spare {time in a more satisfactory way than they (•sn now* Hr. Eraser's view of tneques- nion was not objected to. Hot a single pnember who spoke contested any one of Jiis positions. Xhe TrnfKYroMonrmn and tbe general advisability of bis resolution were absolutely admitted, yet it was opposed. The opposition, however, was not genuine, j but the half-hearted and paltering sort of j reastance-fvhich results in a plea for time. Mr. Darling was gftte at one wj£h the •motion on principle^ but wished it to be j withdrawn because there had- been no j public agitation on the subject. He-wanted j /outside pressure to be irtrught to bear upon I lim, because he did not think the House ought to take the initiative in the matter. Air. Bray's views were much of the same j ivind, but flavored with legal technicalities ! on the powers of the Governors of j the Institute, which were quite beside tbe true question to be decided. He told the House that the Labor League had a library, and that it was not open on Sundays, and therefore argued that the opening of the Institute on Sundays was not required at all by the working classes. Mr. Bray seemed to lose sight of the fact that all working men are not members of the Labor League, and that if they were it would not assist ha argument, because there are others who are ; HOt Of the -Btricfly Miming rrlmiffpjft jfhn require tome kind of reasonable way of en • joying themselves on Sundays, and. who would Tesort to' the Institute on those &&y;? to obtain access to. books and oth?* prints which they can obtain feov* ere else. Mr. Cavenagh was on ti% «one aide, and Mr White koLJly said he would -vote fast as the m&jbrfy; -oitside mh*t decide. Now tills is altogether a most improper : way of dealing with a question of the kind. Honorable members ought to, know by this time that they are not mere echoes of an outside voice; they are not mere slavish* delegates who have neither power nor discretion of their own. They are [free members of a free Parliament, and ;it is their duty to- legislate for the good of their country first, for their constituente next; to lead public opinion where they can, but in all cases to <be just. In every ; one of these points the members we have named failed in their duty and inthei j appreciation of their position. If "Mr- Darling and his followers believe that Mr Fraser's motion was ligkt in principle, why . did they not accept the responsibility of ' their convictions? Is it in accordance with the canons of political probity to let %1 dare not; wait upon I would, like the poor cati' the adage f Why shelve the ques tion for a time until the outside public have put .the screw on, and turn the vote to the right or to the left,jastasthe popidar voice may condemn or sanction the principle involved P In far more important matters men«peak and vote without going back to the old .election cries, br. without much considWation for possible mew ones. They assume to use their own discretion in cases where the most serious issues are at -stake, but their seats-are not in danger. But a collisicuvor pethapaan Unpc«ctuitcpnlict of opinion between the Houses in the present session-might b^ng the deluge, and in view of such a contingency some of our Jtgisktors have a nervous regard for what they think may possibly be the opinions of the majority or aXompact minority of their constituente. ' - Mr. Peacock is to be congratulated for his honest, fearless, and" straightforward speech. He said what was truly in the best interests of the working-classes.' Hie was earnest, forcible, and eloquent, and took the course he did, not because he had pronused his constituents to support such~a motion as Hr.Fiwer'fi, but because it was prudent, politic, and- just; because its ten dency was to strip the Kngiiah fi^^h of what many ifrig'wihninn and all foieTgness consider to-be its gloominess, and to taake it as it was intended to be—a day of reasonable enjoyment, as well as of cessa tion from sheer labor. An amendment suggested to Mr. Frasar to leave the open ing of country Institutes a matter of option, and agreed to by him, demolished the faint ahow of opposition Chat then waas only some memben could not vote with the "Ayes" without an external sgneeze. MnSimms, who is an ardent friend and supporter of the motion and of the principle it catxbs with it, unfortunately helped the waiters on Providence by moving an adjournment of the debate for three weeks in order tha. petitions might be sent in on the subject These petitions, whatever they may be, will pot influence M? v&ie;,*tetit" they 5; will .assuredly affords to some a ground for trimmingwhichtbey "will avail themselves of. ;We have no- doubt but that Mr. ;Fraeer's motion will be agreed to as far as {the Adelaide £pstitnte is omened,-. The {matter is tre&ted-as; an ?pen question ty ■ the GovemmemVbnt it is not probable that ,807:0110 of the Cabinet will oppose it. The question, however, is one of social .policy, and the- proposal is certain to commend itself to a large number of men of Ilie most pronounced religious views- Mr. Sing, the Minister of Education, hinted that if some minister* ware afraid that their congregations would fall o3~on .Sunday , afternoons in consequence of the opening of (the Museum, sad Library, it would be politicior them', tomate"their sermons and Services a little more attractive. However, 1 (there need be no competition between the (two. The opening of the Institute will do jgocd to many, who never go to any place of worship, and a' great many who would I lounge about public-houses on Sundays from sheer want of something else to do, or ! .somewhere else to goto, will amuse them selves without injury to religion or public , morale, and make Sunday a real blessing to ,tbem instead ef somsthing else. Many regular attendants at Church also would Ibe glad to viett Inarifaifo^, -M'^"^, wwfl Picture Galleries in the afternoon,-and no | one is required to do so against his will. "V^hkn &at; -genial humorist, the late Artemus Ward, became a public, lecturer the originated an ides which when it became [ .developed created a great deal of amuse ment. B? announced a lecture on "The | Babes in the Wood," and crowds flocked to. jheu him. He commenced with what he termed "a few prefatory remarks," and (these remarks extended to a series, of enecdotes and funny sayings, interspersed {with original flashes of wit, which con talked his audience with laughter and made them altogether unmindful of the of time, and also oblivious of tho fact that sot one word had been uttered by the lecturer which, had the remotest reference to the subject which , lie had Announced as tha- one on j {which, he intended to address them. I When at last the lecturer took out his ' watch, looked at if, and wilt a grare face j announced that he had occupied the whole iof the time with his introductory remarks, and that the subject of bis lecture would bave to be deferred for a time, the astonish kuent of the audience can readily be imagined, but they were quite as much , fliverted by the funny piece of deception jwhich bad been practised, upon .them as jthey had been with the whole of the enter tainment to which they bad been treated. : Among die numerous audience which attended the first of these lectures it can be pretty safely asserted that not one was pre ■pared for the peculiar termination of the lecture, and in lika-manner it would be a -matter for surprise to know that jout of the twelve hundred people whe attended,* lecture recently deEvered at the Mechanics' Institute, Geelong, by the Bight Rev. Dr. Mborhonse, Bishop'of Melbourne, |any one had the slightest idea of what jwould be the character of the address they •had met to hear. Dr. Moorhouse announced laa the subject of his lecture "A. Remedy Ifor Distress in" Victoria." The Tictoriau* (bare been so accustomed to hear "jliticai jremediee advocated a* acu? for th/depiM jsuffl existing amonjs>t d?m thatthey .would JB&taially; eip^t to'hea. His Lordship ad i^***** panacea of this nature, and great must have bean theix astonishment when i he^naounced-tbat he was no politician. It i mustfacveljeen quite Tefreshing to have a j man come befcre thenianf give afew sound : and^ractfcal suggestions for the alleviation lof their distress &s; Dr. Moorhonse did. The lecturer takes the position that, the j population of the colony as a . whole 'is dependant' An what is raised from :th« land in the form of wool, hides, 1 and food, «ad arguing from this he advo cates a freer application of manure to the land to increase its bearing power; and as ja means of'enabling {aimers to keep the requisite number of cattle to produce-sn ; abundant supply of manure, he Recommends the irrigation of large tracts ot country by i means of canals. As showing _what has [been effected by wapnrJHg, -fiMfsgeinpi: [irrigation, the lecturer pointed to Flanders, jLom4aTdy-,-.and Valencia. JKafeering; to .; Lombardy, he said there is in that district la triangular jtzact of hind measuring but twenty, miles on each aide, which is the \ ■richest plot in the whole of Italy.' On that 'small piece of hind there are 103,000 {pigs .'«nd, 25/ XX) horses,* and , the jmanure'" they produce 'is the back ;bone of the cultivation. And Dr. Moor house says:—"How, then, fan we stock Victoria in this way? Not without food, .and _ food. cannot ,-be produced without iwater. It comes to.this, that unless we can provide a sufficient supply of water in 'this colony for irrigation purposes, there win never be any. great abatement of the (distress."- -The lecturer also gave some ipaxticnlsxs with reference to what has bees done on the plains of Valencia, in the south ■of Spain, as affording a more apt illustra tion of what he was advocating, many of its physical conditions corresponding to [those of Victoria. "A Btnnger naturally expect,", he. said, "to find it a mere desert, brown «ad:<dry as the lands* of Victoria in summer time, but it is in a state of rich cultivation. ' I&_ population is 1,774 to the space. nife, afc -compared with- the two families at, say five each, to- the -square mile in Victoria. This is the result of making a proper use of its rivers." In this province of Valencia, as is pretty well known, exists the-most perfect system of irrigation in the world, asd by its means a once arid district 'has been converted into a vast garden, from which; three and sometimes four crops are taken in a year. Whether such a re sult as this would follow the adoption jof '■ill. Moorhouse'a suggestion in Victoria is perhaps doubtful; but if soil which is now comparatively unproductive could be con certed into good pastoral .and agricultural land it would be a great point gained, and •the existence of canals by which the land could he irrigated would make the owners to a great extent secure from the ill effects of a protracted drought. Mr. Moorhouse proposes to commence irrigation from the Loddon, Campaspe, and Goulburn Rivers. These rivers, which flow into the Murray, traverse a vast plain of Which two million acres are included be tween the Loddon and the Goulburn, with the Campappo passing nearly through the miufflle ofiE. Thia bocurtry the BUhop contendj-coold be irriy?ted to the extent of two^nikciui.either aide -of the rivers bj putjbingca?Ale&om; tbeaiy sod he atioagly] advocates 4Mb being dcaev and the scheme hu much to recom&end;' it.

The recom-. mendatisa of the BWbop for a communed- . ment ia-of a suffeciently modest character-' He advises that the -work of irrigation be : initiated by ■ catting- canals for 49 milea along the Gdulburn orer a tract of country having a width of fire miles, which he asserts could be done, and which ' would giro 200 square- miles .of well- ' watered land. But his idea as to the resnltsare aangaina. He says:—v A selec- ■ tion ai 320 acres- in that district-' would then be a fortune-; for IQ, or at most' 15 acres of that land, wonldbe sofGcifint for the support of a family. At the rate of/. one family to 10 acres, and five as the number of each family, there would be on,: t&eseSDOsquatemilefta; population of QifiOO people living in comfort." It is pleasing to ; see that the- rev. lecturer .enters a strong ', protest against the destruction of forests, ■ ■without -which, he says, no dependence • could lie placed on the continuance of the ' water supply. The forests here, he asserts, play exactly the same part in irrigation as the Alps do for Lombardy, and he adds, "It is little less than a crime for anybody to cut them down, unless the land be sa fertile ns to make it desirable-" This sub ject ha>> been repeatedly referred to in these columns, and Dr. Moorhoose's news on the question are endorsed by most people who bare given the subject careful and intelli- ' gent consideration. The next paint to which, the .Bishop. | referred was, who was to be^n tbeWork; and he onheeitetingly aaserted that st mas the duty of the Oovernment t? 4 so, '■■ on the same principie that they comm^iced i the construction (rfxailways,lmti!ie 4^ not | advocate, dniir doing JBore than the begin- '■■ mag. On this point ha-Bu^ v Why doero Government exist? Tbat it may devise schemes for the good of the country. All the people depend on the laud for bread and clothes, and therefore the GoVerritnent ; above all things ought to make its cultiva- I tion a permanently profitable occupation." : In spite of olher subjects which are absorb ing the attention of tKe Victorian Govern- ; ment at the present lime/ they will most' probably be called upon to conaiifr Hub : question before long, and if it" Tie once re solved to make a beginning,.there can be littte doubt that the results, if not so . as Dr. Moorhonse aadcipatea, will yet be sufficiently eMouraging tolead to a farther ertenskm of the -work of- irrigation.. Ifot niaziy persons who.know much of Australia Felix will agree that a system of irrigation is absolutely necessary to pra-; vent distress there, for the amount of food i production might be enormously increased' -without the aid of a angle canal or dam.; \ bnt -still irrigation' would add to the fer tility of the drier parts of .the country. Whether the Bishop has properly fortified himself -with facts and .statistics as toihe rivers he has named and the rainfall of Vie- '■ toriave are not able to -«ajfr but there Ckn: be no doubt tibal.the question neluis'iaiAd; is of very great importance to the intareab of that prdvi?ce. ■ ' Sis' Sxceileflcf.' the Governor hold 'a i ConneilcaWeanesday. at which all the Miots- ' ters were preoEiit. v The weather on Wednesday was un- usually cold.

When Mr. Furner's motion for enbtrgin^ tha scope of enquiry by the Committee ap pointed in reference to tfae Mount OamHer and Bivoli Bay Bailway came on on Wedaeaday the hon. member proposed to amend it by inserting words which would betaotemoont to referring thd whole qnestion of railway construction and management in this colony to a Commission. The amendment was ruled out of order, and Mr. Furner was recommended to move what be bad aaggested as * separate motion, which course he said be would adopt.. .

The majority of members treated the whole thing as rather a good joke. The Treasurer, in stating that the Oovernment would resist the motion, observed that such attempts at obtaining an adjournment of the sitting of the House were becoming too common. He pointed out tbat if those who were interested in these footbal encountO? desired the patronage of members of Parliament they should fix upon a non- parlia mentary day for such matches as they desired them to attend, and said that it was for a similar reason that the Government would object to any thej- will, jhta^ce Jjpf 'jtfajaikM?L bett?JttJji'lii^ flo^Sd <m§j|alfek . xifo toedignify ofTwrlinmrnr fn ■nijuiil Hi buiaeat op account >oha. bayMttqimya?.fcaj? no ff*&tfifr;~ *?"nw fFJn m*"-Sy I?fiH*T wmftM^ Bnttdtainmeritt tottuchrfjafcs^ia^.^ ?JP The Babbit Supnaea?ion Bill vf^PSuJMtn onW^Deri^,;'Wb«J4^^JS«i?er«^ intxodneed.

Mr. J. Tyerman gave the last of his series of lectures is the Liedertefel Hall on 'Wednesday evening, July 23. There was a large attendance, rho lecture mi entitled •*«• tbe Bible the Word of God?" la com -i?encing bis remarks Sir. Tyermin expressed hit; Approval of the- advice given by Paul— " Prove all tLinga and bold fast to that which is good." He proceeded to apply the test thus recommended to tie Bible, and considered its claims to be regarded as a complete, infallible, satisfactory, and final revelation of God's will to man. A number of propositioni were advanced as to the conditions which require to be fulfilled by any book relied oaaioE £i«u>e authority, and the lecturer, while admittiDgt that in many respects the Bible oontained^poinU of great beauty and usefulness, denied that it complied with the conditions he specified as necessary to entitle it to acosptanoe as an infallibly-inspired revelation. The lecturer was listened to with great interest, mod Mr. Tyarman was fortmnate in securing free neat plaudits from his audienoe, although occasionally subjected to interruptions bom psrwws who disagreed with him. At the dese- v the lecture a number of questions bear ing on the subject discussed ware asked and answered. During thd'oura* of the evening Mr. Tyeiman acknowledged the fair spirit which had been shown by the Press in its treatment of his lectures. He intend* to proceed from this colony to New Zealand. "In connection with the forthcoming Exhibitions at Sydney and Melbourne a, ques tion of considerable importance to English ex hibitors has arisen," say the London Daily Mas of May 14. • The ordinary rates tor the trans mission of messages to and from Australia are very high, the charge being no less than 10s. Bd. per word, although this sum may be somewhat reduced by the useof a cipher. The Eoyal Com mission has snrcewded in securing a substantial reduction in tha tariff, so far as its own messages are concerned. If the Ooaitni—iooers had not obtained this concession they would have been compelled either to employ the telegraph very little art* run up an exorbitant bill for tele grams. They, however, appear to have had no difficulty in making an equitable arrangement. The exhibitors think that they have an equal claim to consideration. They point out that it will be necessary for their agents at the Exhibitions to eo?ununieate frequently with them, and- Oat, in fact, as tetter* ooeupy about six weeks in reaching this country, the exi gencies of business will necessarily render it desirable that tae telegraph should be freely need. They therefore ask that, in order to meet these argent requirement*, a considerable cedue tion in tbe taiiff shall be made for their con venience. They ask that nst more than a maTirnnm of SO*, shall be charged to them for a message of six or seven words, aad they sug gest that erenalesssummight not only be reason able, but would have the effect of greatly increasing the number of messages. We think that the exhibitors will carry with them in this matter the sympathy of tbe commercial public, and we trust that their request may be decided on its merits."

The Adelaide rnMxPKitile communi^r will be interested to hear that a achame is on fo>t for .the erection of a Hall of Oomnterce in Oanie-Mreet. We believe we ere correct in stating tbat Mr. 8. Barnard v : tbe .genHeman who is.endeavoring to give practical effect to this plan for the supply of an increasing, if not long- experienced want, and that it is Mr. B*r natdVintention to float a Company to provide for the necessary expenditure. There are in course of preparation in Mr. Garlick** office plans for a building which, it i* estimated, will oust about £17,000, aad which, so far as an opinion can be formed from an inspection of in complete plans, will give the whole of the re quired accommodation. Tbe site selected is iv the vicinity of the White Hone Hotel, and it giresa frontage to Ourrie-street of 90 feet, and a totaldepthtoTopbam- etreetof 210 feet Accord ing to the plans tbe main portion of tbe build ing will occupy about 82 feet of this depth, its height, inclusive of three floors, being 80 feet. There is to be a main entrance IS feet in width in Currie-street. On the right-hand side will be found the much-needed convenience of a telegraph office, adjoining which there is to be a commodious chamber with strong room attached. Offices with similar accommodation are to be situated on the opposite aide of the entrance, the avenge size being 20 feet by 18 feet. In the inner or staircase hall there are to be suites of offices of smaller dimensions, supplemented by lavatories. On the right of the lobby beyond, leading directly to the mam tall of tbe building, there is to be an arbitration room 31 feet by 32 feet, and on the left an auction room of the same size. The large hall in its main features will bear a strong resemblance to the Melbourne Hall of Commerce; and when it is stated that the plan gives its dimensions at 80 feet by 40 feet with a height of 40 feet it will be seen that there will be ample provision to meet com- mercial requirements for many years to come. Those who frequent tbe mam room of the existing Exchange building will appre ciate the institution of a reading room, partitioned from the main hall. At tbe back of the hall, and ???nii«?g parallel with Topham street, tbere is to be a two-story store, se parated from the main buOdi?Sj by a right-of way, in which some minor accessories will be advantageously placed. Upon the second and third floors respectively there will be twenty offices of various ahtes, independently of strong 1 rooms; and the second floor wiH also com municate with a gallery overlooking the main hall, and giving aceesa to twelve additional offices. At tbe mr end of thai gallery, and ex tending over the right-of-way already men tioned, there will be apartments intended for tbe use of afae officer in charge of tbe hall. The atyleof architecture adopted is that known as street Italian. The elevations will be in free stone, with cement drasriugs; and the general effect of theatroeturewiUbe further improved by an ornamented turret. We understand that Mr. Bernard has expressed his satisfaction with Mr. eariick's design, and that it is approved by other gentlemen interested in the furtherance of the work. It is proposed to erect an Exchange in Pirie-street adjoining the new South Australian Club House. A welcome breakfast to Mr. G.
