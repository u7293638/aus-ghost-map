j THE CONFESSION OF FATE' We subjoin for the information of Ihv. our readers who take on interest to (be (26B troversy which is now proceeding relative for the teaching of the standards of the Presbyterian Church, a portion of the West minster Confession of Faith As the document is a lengthy one, we give to day the first eleven chapters only, reserving the remainder for a subsequent IBBUO - The Confession of faith, agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster Examined and approved, Anno 1917, by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and ratified by acts of Parliament 1649 and 1690 CHAP. I -OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURE Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and Providence, do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable , yet they are not sufficient to give that knowledge of God, and of His will, which is necessary unto salvation therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal Himself and to declare that His will unto the church and afterwards, for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing , which maketh the Holy Scripture to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people being now ceased. II Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are these - OF THE OLD TESTAMENT. Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Joshua Judges HUlh I Samuel II Samuel I Kings II Kings I CfaroulclcB II Chronicles Ezra Nehemiah.

All which are given by inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life. III. The bookecommonly called Apochrypha, not being of Divine inspiration, are no part of the canon of the Scripture, and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings. IV. The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, depended not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof, and therefore it is to be received, because it is the word of God V. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to an high and reverend esteem of the Holy Scripture, and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the word of God , yet notwithstanding our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and Divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the word in our hearts. VI The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for His own glory, man's salvation, faith, and life is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit or traditions of men Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the word and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God and government of the Church common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the word, which are always to be observed VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all, yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the earned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them VIII The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations being îmniiuiately inspired by God, and by His singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic!, so as in all controversies of religion, the Church is finally to appeal unto them But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that the word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner, and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope IX. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched and known by other places that speak more clearly. X. The Supreme Judge, by which all con- troversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture. CHAP. II OF GOD, AND OF THE HOLY TRINITY. I. There is but one only living and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions, immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most vvlBe, most holy, most free, most absolute, working all things according to the counsel of His own immutable and most righteous will, for His own glory , most loving, gracious, merciful, long suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and 8 in the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and withal most just and terrible in 1911 judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty II. God hath all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself, and is alone in and unto Himself all sufficient, not standing in need of any creatures which He hath made, not deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting His own glory, in, by, unto, and upon them he is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom, are all things , and hath most sovereign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever Himself pleases In His sight all things are open and manifest, nia knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain He is most holy in all his counsels, in all His works, and in all His commands To Him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience, He is pleased to require of them III. In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity God the rather, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding ; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. CHAP III -Or GOD'S ETERNAL DECREE. I God from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel of His own will freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass yet BO, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures, none the liberty or con- tingency of second causes taken away, but rather established II. Although God knows whatsoever may or can come to pass upon all supposed con ditions ; yet hath He not decreed anything because He foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to PORE upon such conditions III. By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death. IV. These arjRels and men, thus predicts- nated and foreordained, are particularly and unchangeably designed and their number is so certain and definite that it cannot be either increased or diminished. V Those of mankind that are present- nated unto life, God, before the foundation of the world was laid, according to His main and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of His will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, t of His mere free grace and love, without I "L foresight of faith or good works, or per ' nee in either of them, or any other season the creature, as conditions, or causes ming In thereunto, and all to the praise moving -ra. grace of" K'0"^ hath appointed the elect unto VI Ah Goo.

It pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for the manifestation of the glory of His eternal power, wisdom, and goodness, in the beginning, to create, or make of nothing, the world, and all things therein, whether visible or In visible, in the space of sundays, and all very good II After God had made all other creatures, He created man, male and female, with reasonable and immortal souls, endued with knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness, after His own image, having the law of God written in their hearts, and power to fulfil it, and yet, under a possibility of transgressing, being left to the liberty of their own will, which was subject unto change, Beside this law written in their hearts, they received a command not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which while they kept they were happy in their communion with God, and had dominion over the creatures CHAP, CO-OP PBOVIUENCE. God, the great Creator of all things, both uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things, from the greatest even to the least, by His most wise and holy providence, according to His in fallible foreknowledge, and the free and immutable counsel of His own will, to the praise of the glory of His wisdom, power, justice, goodness, and mercy II. Although, in relation to the foreknowledge and decree of God, the first cause, all things come to pass immutably and infallibly , yet, by the same providence, he ordereth them to fall out according to the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely, or contingently III God in His ordinary providence maketh use of means, yet is free to work without, above, and against them, at His pleasure IV-The Almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of God, so far manifest themselves in his providence, that it extendeth itself even to the first fall, and all other signs of angels and men, and that not by a bare permission, but such as hath joined with it a most wise and powerful bounding, and otherwise ordering and governing of them, in a manifold dispensation, to His own holy ends, jet so as the Sinful ness thereof proceeded only from the cree tute, and not from God , who, being most hoes and righteous, neither is nor can be the author or approved of Bin V Themost wise, righteous, and gracious God doth oftentimes leave for a season His own children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their own hearts, to chastise them for their former Sins, or to discover unto them the hidden strength of corruption and deceitfulness of their hearts, that they may be humbled, and to raise them to a more close and constant depend- ence for their support upon Himself and to make them more watchful against all future occasions of sin, and for sundry other just and holy ends VI AB for those wicked and ungodly men, whom body as a righteous judge, for former Bins, doth blind and harden, from them He not only withholding His grace, whereby they might have been enlightened in their understandings, and wrought upon in their hearts, but sometimes also withdrawn the gifts which they had and exposeth them to such objects as their corruption makes aged sion of sin and withal, gives them over to their own lasts the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan whereby it comes to pass that they harden themselves, even under those means which God useth for the softening of others VII -As the providence of God doth, in general, reach to all creatures , so, after a most special manner, it taketh care of His Church, and diepoBeth all things to the good thereof CHEAP VI OF THE FALL OF MAN, OF [SIN, AID OF THE PUNISHMENT THERE OF Our first parents being seduced by the subtilty and temptation of Satan,' sinned in eating the forbidden fruit. This their sin God was pleased, according to His wise and holy counsel, to permit, having purposed to order it to His own glory II By this am they fell from their original righteousness and communion with God, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of soul and body III they being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed, and the some death in sin and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity, descending from them by ordinary generation IV From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed disabled and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil, do proceed all actual transgressions V This corruption of nature, during this life, doth remain in those that are regent rated and although it be through Christ pardoned and mortified, jet both itself and all the motions thereof are truly and properly Bin VI Every Bin, both original and actual being a transgression of the righteous law of God, and contrary thereunto, doth, in its own nature bring guilt upon the sinner, whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God, and curse of the law, and so made subject to death, with all miseries spiritual, temporal, and eternal. CHEAP VII OF GOD S COVENANT WITH MAN The distance between God and the creature is so great that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto Him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of Him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God's part, which He hath been pleased to express by way of covenant II The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works wherein life was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity upon condition of perfect and personal obe dance III Man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the Covenant of Grace whereby he freely offered unto sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in Him that they may be saved, and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto life his Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe IV This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in the Scripture by the name of a Testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the testator, and to the everlasting in- heritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed V This covenant was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the Gospel, under the law it was administered by promises, prophecies, Bacri. faces, circumciBion the Paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews, all foreBigmfymg Christ to come which were for that time sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the spirit, to instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah, by whom they had full remission of ama, and eternal salva ton, and is called the Old Testament VI Under the Gospel, when Christ the substance was exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, which, though fewer in number, and administered with more simplicity and less outward glory, yet in them it is held forth in more fulness, evidence, and spiritual efficacy, to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles, and is called the New Testa ment there are not, therefore, two covenants of grace differing in substance, but one and the same under various dispensations. CHAP VIII OF CHRIST THE MEDIATOR. It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to cheat and ordain the Lord Jesus, His only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and mah ; the Prophet, Priest, and King , the Head and Saviour of His Church, the Heir of all things, and Judge or the world, unto whom He did from all eternity give a people to be His seed, and to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, same sided, and glorified in The Son of God the second person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one substance. and equal with the other, did, when the fulness of time was come, take upon him man's nature, with all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin , being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin Mary, of her substance So that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion composition, or confusion Which I erson is very God and very man yet one Christ, the only Mediator between God and man III The Lord Jesus, in His human nature thus united to the Divine, was sanctified and anointed with the Holy Spirit above measure, having in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in whom it pleased the rather that all fulness should dwell to the end that, being holy, harmless, undefiled, as as", of grace BILL truth, He might be born. "field 'crushed to execute the office of a media '3 4 and unity which office He took not unto her "self, but was thereunto called by HIS FaST, WBC Put all power and judgment into the wind, and gave Him come mandment to execute the same IV 1 his office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake , vTuicb that He might discharge he was made under the law, and did perfectly fulfil it, endured most grievous torments immediately in His Son, and most painful sufferings in his body , was crucified, and died , was buried, and remained under the power of death jet saw no corruption On the third day He arose from the dead, with the same body in which He suffered , with which also He ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth at the right hand of His Father making intercession and shall return to judge men and angels at the end of the world V The Lord Jesus, by His perfect obedience and sacrifice of Himself, which He through the eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, hath fully satisfied the justice of His Father, and purchased not only recon citation, but an everlasting inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven for all those whom the Father hath given unto him VI Although the work of redemption was not actually wrought by Christ till after His incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefits thereof were communicated unto the elect in all ages successively from the beginning of the world, in and by these promises, types, and sacrifices, wherein he was revealed and signified to be the seed of the woman, which should bruise the serpent B head, and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world, being yesterday and to day the same, and forever VII Christ in the work of mediation, acteth according to both natures by each nature doing that which is proper to itself , yet, by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by the other nature VIII To all those for whom Christ hath purchased redemption, He doth certainly and effectually apply and communicate the same, making intercession for them and revealing unto them, in and by the word, the mysteries of salvation , effectually persuading them by His Spirit to believe and obey and govern- ing their hearts by His word and Spirit, over coming all their enemies by His almighty power and wisdom, in such manner and ways OF are most consonant to His wonderful and unsearchable dispensation CHAP IX OF TREE WILL I God hath endued the will of man with that natural liberty, that it is neither forced, nor by any absolute necessity of nature determined, to good or evil. II Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power to will and to do that which is good and well pleasing to God , but yet notably, so that he might fall from it III Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation , so as a natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in Bin, is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto IV When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of grace, He freed him from his natural bondage under em, and by His grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which is spiritually good , yet so as that, by reason of his remain mg corruption, he doth not perfectly nor only will that which is good, but doth also will that which is evil. V The will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to do good alone in the state of glory only CHAP X -OF EFFECTUAL CALLING I All those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only. He is pleased, in His appointed and accepted time, effectually to call by His word and Spirit out of that state of sin and death in which they are by nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ, enlightening their minds spiritually and savingly to understand the things of God taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of flesh , renewing their wills, and by His almighty power deter- mining them to that which is good, and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ, yet so as they come most freely, being made willing by His grace II This effectual call is of God's free and special grace alone, not from anything at all foreseen in man who is altogether passive therein until being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, no is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed in it III Elect infants, dying in infancy, are regenerated and saved by Christ through the Spirit, who worketh when and where and how he pleased So also are also all other elect persons who are incapable of being outwardly called by the ministry of the word IN Others not elected, although they may be called by the ministry of the word and may have some common operations of the Spirit, yet they never truly come unto Christ, and therefore cannot be saved much less can men not professing the Christian religion be saved in any other way whatsoever, be they ever so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature and the law of that religion they do profess and to assert and maintain that they may is very pernicious, and to be detested CHAP II -On JOSTIFIOATIOV I Those whom God effectually calleth he also freely justifieth , not by infusing right eouanesB into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous not for anything wrought in them or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone not by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them as their righteous ness, but by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them, they receiving and resting on him and His righteousness by faith which faith they have not of them selves it is the gift of God II 1 with thus receiving and resting on Christ and His righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification yet is it not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love III Christ, by His obedience and death did fully discharge the debt of all those that are thus justified and did make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to His Fathers justice in their behalf Yet inasmuch as He was given by the father for them. and His obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead and both freely not for anything in them, their justification is only of free grace that both the exact justice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the justification of Sinners IN God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the Fulness of time, die for their sins and rise again for their justification nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth in due time actually apply Christ unto them V God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified and although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may by their sins fall under God B fatherly displeasure and not have the light of His countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance VI The justification of believers under the Old Testament was, in all these respects one and the same with the justification of believers under the New Testament AIABMINO pitfalls have lately taken place in the neighbourhood of Tighe's Hill, near Newcastle NSW, close to the workings of the Ferndale Colliery, threatening the safety of a number of houses, and leaving great cavities in the earth In one place two great sinkings of the earth occurred adjoining each other, and extending over a considerable area, right in the centre of a number of inhabited houses The earth has sunk in places fully 20 feet, whilst further away. and in every direction almost, there are smaller falls, and strong indications of others Naturally, the inhabitants are very much alarmed at the dangers that threaten them The most dangerous of the pitfalls have carried away portions of two of the streets.
