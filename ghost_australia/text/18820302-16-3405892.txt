©he IMífenc éfmtm** THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1SS2. THE question of school age is being raised just now in Victoria. What is school age ? and what ought to be the restrictions, if any, in the ages of children taught at primary schools 1 The inquiry arose in this wise : It wits represented that some 40,000 children were being educated in the primary schools who were either under or over what was called the statutory school ¡ige, and that this not only led to much additional expen- diture, but that it was not originally con- templated that the State should undertake the care either of mere infants, or that it should be burdened with Hie expense of teaching pupils who had passed the statutory ago. The Minister wasratherinelincdtoadmit that the Act had in this respect been rather laxly administered, and that it might be desirable to be more strict in the limitation. It was soon found, however, thal any change in this respect would lead to something more than inconvenience, and might prove to be unnecessarily restrictivo. The Minister, at any rate, lind to hold his hand, ¡uid he determined to ask the advice of the school inspectors, who might be considered perfectly impartial judges. The inspectors accordingly met the other day in Mel- bourne, seventeen in ¡ill, and after confer- ring together for three days tiley presented ¡i report to the Minister. Ti may be inferred from the brief précis of the proceedings supplied that there was a good deal of differ- ence of opinion among them, but certain resolutions were adopted, and these must be accepted as the result of their deliberations. When the statutory school age is spoken of, it may bo well to suite that the ¡ige specified in the different Education Acts of tlie colonies refers not to the age at which, or during which, children may attend primary schools, but to the ages during which they must receive instruction of some kind for a certain number of days in cadi year. The ages specified stand thus In Victoria, from 0 to 15 years In Now South Wales, from 6 to 11 years In Tasmania, from 7 to 14 years In South Australia, from 7 to 13 years In New Zealand, from 7 to K1 years In Queensland, from 0 lo 12 years. It is evident that the ages here stated cannot bo considered as limiting the ages between which children may attend school, so that iii Ulis sense tharc is really no statutory age, except as regards the com- pulsory clauses. It would be simply ridicu- lous to suppose that no children were to go to school before they were seven years old, or that they should not stay at school, as in our own case, after they were twelve years old. School age must therefore be a matter for de- partmental regulation. In England the prac- tice has been to enrol all children over tlu-ee, so also in Victoria. In England the pay- ment is for results, and to some extent also in Victoria. Any further limitation of this . would therefore affect the teachers' salaries. In New Zealand it is proposed to limit the payment of teachers to ages between five and fifteen, but this regulation has not yet come into force, and it seeriis doubtful if it will be allowed to do so. The question is partly one of money and partly one of educational ethics. If there are more children to be provided for, more money will of course be required, and the annually increasing expenditure in Victoria has stirred up the inquiry. But the question dealt with by the inspectors was rather more one of edu- cational than financial interest : Was it or was it not desirable that children of tender years should be sent to school at all ? One inspector-a Mr. Holland-had some little time ago expressed a strong opinion against the practice of sending such " mites " to school. They could not learn anything, and they ought to be in the open air, breathing "God's glorious oxygen." On the other hand, it had been contended that good in- fant training made children much more orderly and tractable, and that the sanitary condition of the State schools was excel- lent. There was a good deal to be said on both sides. Tlie inspectors met, however, and had a good talk over it all, the result being that they came to certain definite conclusions, which, as coming from men specially quali- fied to judge in such matters, cannot be regarded as other than valuable and sugges- tive. The first resolution, adopted by a unanimous vote, was to the following effect : -" It is the opinion of this conference that the educational benefits derived by children under five years of age do not wan-ant expen- diture at the same rate as that incurred for older children." Another resolution adopted was to this effect :-" In the opinion of this conference it is desirable that no child under the age of four and a half should be en- rolled in State schools." This was carried on division by ten voles to seven. A motion fixing the minimum age at five years was lost on division by a vote of seven to nine. A unanimous vote was given on a resolution to the effect that it was not desirable to exclude from State schools children between the ages of five and six ; and by another unanimous vote they agreed that it was not desirable to exclude any children already enrolled in any State schools. These resolutions must be re- garded as of considerable importance, arrived at as they have been by men who are of all others perhaps the best fitted to express an opinion upon a subject with which they must be very con- versant, and upon wliich they must have large experience. Simultaneously with tins report from the inspectors, a deputation from the council of School Boards of Advice waited upon Mr. Grant to inform him that the council had arrived at the opinion that four years should be the minimum ago for enrolment. Tims the matter stands at present, but it is not anticipated that any final decision will be arrived at until the Education Commissioil which is now sitting has also reported. It can scarcely be supposed that thestatutory age from six to fifteen will be accepted as the standard of school age. If so, it would exclude one-fifth of those now attend- ing school, and would very much retard the whole work of public instruction. An .appreciable proportion of children between five and six can read monosyllables, can write both small and capital lettow, and can repeat by heart a number of small poems. Tin's is ;i good deal to have learned at that age, and helps them on very much towards completing the small stock- in-trade which is all that most of them can attain during their term of schooling. Of course it must at once be admitted that it would be most imprudent in any parent lo allow a child of feeble physique to be bothered with lessons'at all at that ago. Much better, as Mr. Holland says, would it he for it to be inhaling pure air if it has the chance. But the average run of children must be taken to be healthy. The three or four hours they are in school are, in all good schools, rendered as little irksome as may be by constant variety. The mental applica- tion required is as little monotonous as it well can be. Three-year-old " mites" are undoubtedly 'out of place, and they would certainly be better making dirt pies than being drilled into regulation form. The " mites," however, are only in ¡i very small minority. They might with ¡id vantage be dispensed with altogether, at any rate until they are four years old. So that it is perhaps just as well that ¡i little pressure has been brought to bear on those mothers who are sometimes only too willing to transfer their own responsibilities to the school teachers. But there ought to be a limit to tins, and four years and a-half as ¡t minimum seems fair enough. IT is not more than a generation since railways were first commenced in India. The experiment was looked upon as a wild speculation. The natives would never travel and railways would never pay. Such were the anticipations of the knowing ones. Last year the India railways carried 40,000,000 passengei-s, and the East India .Railway Company sold out to the Government for .£37,000,000 sterling. The apologists of Indian railways say that they provide the cheapest travelling in the world, and that in India the passenger are better attended lo than in any other country. From Bombay to Calcutta, a distance of 1408 miles, the charge for second-class passengers with ac- commodation equal to that in most first-class carriages in Australia is £6, ¡uid the journey is accomplished in sixty-one hours if the traveller chooses. The native, if he travels fourth class, can do so over the same dis- tance for less than ¿3 ; and he will have filtered water brought to him at every sta- tion if he chooses to ask for it, or if, unfor- tunately, he should happen to die of fever or of cholera by the way, he will lind ¡t collin ready for linn at the next station. Can anything be more considerate than this? Moreover, the thoughtful and fore- seeing traveller can order his dinner or his breakfast or his tea by telegram ¡it any station lie may select, and no extra charge is made for the missive. The employe's are almost all natives, many of the guards are Eurasians, and very grand gentlemen they are. There is one excep- tion. The engine drivers are mostly Euro- peans ; but even in this respect there have been innovations, and the East Indian Com pajiy chira to have saved some ¿£80,000 a j e ti bj the employ ment of n iti\ e engine dm eis vnd stokers Ah cady thete tie moie thin 10,000 miles» of main ti tink lines The Eist Inch i Railvv ij has 1511 miles , the Gteat Indu Ptiniisul i 1208, the Rajputana ?Railw, y> 1100, nul so on Yet ill this has been accomplished in a single geneiation, and the joung men M ho commenced the woik aie, some of thom, still vigoiotts nnd heaitj Sonic ¿121,000,000 steihng li ne been spent on these hues, and the gioss îeceipts me ¿11,000,000 Last jcai, in addition to the pafesengeis earned, theie vveie 8,000,000 tons inuchandise tian&poited; fiom place to place, and all this, woik vins done by 1880enginesand 40,000 hucks and carnages AAIiitevei may be said of otu Indian ad ministi ation it cannot be accused of hav nig been idle I> oui Xcw South AA'nlos tclcgiams, pub hshed on 2Sth Jnnuaiy, appeared a paingiaph luivingiefcicnce to the fatal accident on the Dubbo ncccouise, which it was stated was caused by a j oung man named Fanning, " sup posed to have been di mik,"galloping acioss the course Pool Mi Fanning was lulled by the collision, and, as appealed fiom the evidence given it the inquest held upon his body, the mischief was caused by ii man named Devine, who ins, on the conclusion of the inquuy, committed by the coionei to stand his tu ii foi manslaughtei AVc havcieceivcd fiom a gen tlcman at Dubbo, whoso signatiuc is so mdis tinct that vic cannot deciphci it, a lettci in w Inch he states that he vi as running's guai (han, and ho vîntes -" The unfortunate lad Fanning was novel thewoise of liquoi in his life, and was gieatly respected bj all who knew him He had some connections m Queensland who w ill most likely only seo j oin i cpoi t " AVc can only expi ess evti cine ie"'iet that so eironeous an account of the sad occiuienco should have appealed in oin columns AT the Cabinet meeting yesterday it was re solved to iccommend the acceptance of Mr John Muli cn I'S tender foi the constmction of the branch nulli ly fiom Capella to Clermont, for the sum of £32,100 10s , tile w oik to be com pletcdby 30th June, 1SS3 This will be the least costly of the lines vet made, the distance being 30J miles and the contract price per mile undci £10-10 The country is vciyeasy, being almost entirely over downs country, but it seems liai dly possible that the contractor has left a mai f,m foi pi oht Yet there vv ore no less than five tendéis sent m, all foi very low sums, winch indicates that special facilities aie oifeicd ni some way for thcconstiuctionof this line of nilwaj Moreover, all the tenderers belong to the class known as subcontiactors, who ou0ht to h n c ascei tamed the actual cost of cai thw oi k nnd the v allic of sleepers TliEcaitoou in this month's Punch is well conceived and vi eil drawn The likeness of Maciossan is excellent, and Grifhth's, though not so i,ood, can be easily identified A sheet of sketches showing the working of the Mineial Lands Act is amusing But the most noticeable rcfoim is the substitution for the long papéis which used to overweight the pub hcation of a {,1 e it iiumbei of shoi t paragi aphs collected undi i the heads of 'Pissing Show' and "Gi"uctte Papéis ' These paragiaphs aie for the most pal t cusp, md convey a joke or an ide i m the most t iking foi m But there isoncpipci which deseives ill the space and prominence allotted to it, the ' Prize Es-- ly ' on the rain It is as clevci a thing as has ap pcarcd in Punch foi sometime On the whole the numbei is ibovo the avei ige, and when it is> lcmcmbeicd that it is pioduccd in the v ci y depth of the " silly season ' the feat the cditoi has accomplished is a noticeable one.

Cowley, can be obtained fiom the fact that they expect to receive shortly 400 tons of steel rails. They are for the pm pose of mai ing a steam tramway fiom the company's estate to water carriage on the Herbert River, a distance of about fifteen miles. The rails are coming out by a B.I.S.N. boat and will probably be here next month. Steam ploughs have also been ordered by the company from Messrs. Fowler and Co., and would have been at work now were it not for a delay caused by a serious fire which lately occured at the works of that firm. They will soon be here, however, and at work, and will no doubt prove as successful as they have done at Airdmillan on the Burdekin River. Another item is ten miles of wire fencing and all these goods come out to Townsville direct by the mail boat* Hie comianv arc evidently bent on spcndnie the £o00 000 which they have engaged to do and in a veiy short time they will nave 3o0 kanakas and loO white men at woik on the plantation -Jonn i Ile J ulltttn Tut îeceiit boat accident it Pott Mackay, which it seems, has lesultcd in the loss of tin ce hi es is desci ibeil is follow s -It appeal s tint a boat containing cicjit men one of whom w is Air Baynes the en"incei of woiks at Flat top Island was towed out of the Pioneci Rivei by the Dugout, The weither w is very lough, md when the stcamei got neai to the island she chopped the boat and steeiel her usual com se to meet the Alexandiaonhci downward tup The boat steeicd foi the island but in consequence of the bad vv eathci c( uki not reach it and tinned back, heading foi Mount Basset.
