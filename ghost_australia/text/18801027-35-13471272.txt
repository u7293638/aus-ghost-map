PRESBYTERIAN ASSEMBLY. The sixteenth session of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church was opened yesterday evening, in St Stephen's Church. The Rev. George Grimm, M.A., the retiring Moderator, preached the opening sermon, after which the assembly was formally constituted. The name of the Rev J. Miller Ross, secretary of the Sustentation Fund, was added to the roll of the assembly, the Rev. Henry Macready, of Pitt-street South, " was elected Moderator for the ensuing year, and, having assumed the presidency of the assembly, delivered the following address " Fathers and Brethren When informed that I had been elected by the Press) fencE to be Moderator of this General Assembly I felt constrained to publish any declination of the office for reasons given. A paper was 1 lately presented to me, numerously signed by ministers and elders, request ing me to withdraw that detain the c I n deference to the by loss s and wishes of respected brethren 1 expressed in ve willingness to do so on a certain condition, and, when for their pressed, I agreed to take the course that would seem to ex per fenced and v enrile by then to be the best for pen e and harmony at the general account of our proceedings, and now permit me to thank you for the high honour you have done me in calling me to preside over this General Assembly. It is the highest honour you have to confer, and he would be unworthy of a position as fellow-labourer in the Church who would not highly appreciate such an expression of respect and confidence on the part this brethren Relying on the me and I shall endeavour to discharge the duties of the other According to the custom of the ( church and the example of my) predecessors I have to address to you a few remarks Lefoi a entering on the business of our meeting Let us consider first of all the i circumstances in which y e assemble We meet here as the representatives of the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales. A Church comparatively small, but extending over a territory larger than the largest country in Europe, and occupying an important position in a population of nearly) 800 000 It is true we do not stand so pious went) out as formerly as a Church with representative government, as other denominations are rapidly approaching us in that respect, and adopting the distinctive principles of our policy, but we do pride ourselves on our faithful adherence to the whole system of doctrine revealed in the Word of God. We "meet here with this peculiar feature that the most of our ministers have come from the different branches of the great Presbyterian family in the British Isles, and yet all are united under the same old confession of faith and the same old scriptural form of government, without any compro- mise or difficulty. Hitherto we have had some connection with the State The time was when the ministers of one section received State pa) as religious teachers , but their Church was never under State control All the Press) - terian Churches of this kind were ever ties Churches. Neither of them was ever in bondage to any man from the abolishing of State aid to ministers there was one source of aid that remained undisturbed, namely, the Church and School Estates revenue that has recently by Act of Parliament been cut off, and the portion annually received by this Church for churches and school-houses will centre in lhS'J We have not raised our voice in the way of remonstrance or complaint. Whilst thankful for the aid received in past years for the support of those who in difficult and trying circumstances planted and nourished Presby Fenianism in this land, and for the election of churches when the population was sparse and poor, we recognise the change of circumstances and submit to the arrangements that have been made as made for the best with a view to the harmonious working of the general community This much, I will only say, now that the state has left us as a Church emu eh to do for ourselves, I trust they will give us a new issue Utilities Act that will cover and protect our Church property, und afford us proper facility in manuring our own virtues On the last occasion on which we assembled here, we expressed our approval of the Education Bill then before Parliament, and which has since become law According to it, State aid is to be withdraw v n from Denominational schools, so we may now say emphatically that we meet here as a free Church in a free land-free us a Church from all connection with the State, and flee from the burden of school management and I cannot but observe the revolution that has taken place not only in this land but else- where About the latter end of the last century, education throughout Christendom was in the hands of the family or the Church Then Governments began to grant land or money in certain places for school purposes Such was the beginning of ' State support for common schools Now, "what a change has come' Formerly the State built the churches and paid the religious teachers, and left the Church or the people to provide education for their children Now the Church is set aside, and the estate builds the school-houses, trains and pays the teachers, and appoints over all a Minister of Education who appoints under him and over the teachers a certain number of superintendents This is a revolution indeed Instead of State and Church with ecclesiastical episcopacy, it is State and school with literary episcopal v And what now is the work that the Lord has for us to do P Truly, such a great work that the more weHre freed from entanglements the better The Lord seems to be shutting up not only our Church, but the Churches generally to aims and duties that are exclusively religious and spiritual We meet here, not as politicians-not as scientific men, not as literary men, nor as mere social reformers, but as office bearers in the Church, as teaching and ruling elders who have taken the words of the Apostle Paul us addressed to themselves 'Take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God, which hath purchased with his blood We meet to a result for our Church's w welfare, and to ar- range for the carrying on of that work which the Lord hath given our Church to do Dr Guthrie said that the Chevalier Bunsen took a lively interest in the Free Church after the description viewing them us raised up in Providence for the solution of the problem whether a church without aid or countenance from the State could, be the resources of its own members and nothing else, fulfil the two grand objects of every living bein, sustain itself and extend itself That problem has been solved in Scotland and America, and elsewhere But Bunsen might have known that that problem was solved more than 900 years before, and that for 300 years before the conversion of the Emperor Constantine the Christians Church without State aid or countenance, had sustained and extended herself Our Church is now placed on her trial as to this matter Young and comparatively small and weak though we be in this land, yet we form a particular and independent Church, and we have realized in some measure the life and happiness of Christian unity We do not appear as so many isolated independent congregations, but as an organized Christian body We being many are one body-ont visible Church, and as a visible Church our centre of unity is our General Assembly We have, asa Church, been doing something in the way of self-sustaining and solf-extonding But we are free to confess that our Church life has been weak and our Church extension has been far from what we would desire the matter will, no doubt, come prominently forward in the order of our business the brethren will be called upon freely and fully to consider the question what is the best method of sustaining the ministers of religion It is not for me, for a single moment, to attempt to discuss that question now but I may be permitted to remind allot that which beats most directly on that and all other matters to come under our consideration, namely our professed Christian unity As Christians, we are all one in Christ with all other Christians of every race and colour and chime As Piesbjtenun Christians we are specially one with all the members of that great Presbyterian ] community scattered throughout Christendom, and whose particular unity is now being made prominent and visible through the " Pan Presbyterian Council, representing ' 05,000,000 adherents. But as members of the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales we form a particular house- I hold, a particular Church, and in and by that Church will be manifested our life and influence, whatever it be Let us l be realising our Church unity, and be saying, we are brethren.' Let the bonds of Christian love bind us, and let warm Christian sympathy rush through our members ; then brother will not look on brother in cold isola- tion, and congregations will not say, " We have supported our own pastors, and done our duty, and let others do for themselves." That would be contrary to Christian justice and Christian love. The rich Christian must not thus look on the poor brother, and the rich congregation must not thus contemplate the little struggling flock. That little party is a portion of the particular Presbyterian body, and they and their pastor must not be left to feel as if in cold isolation. warm Church heart to feel for them, and no current of Church liberality to extend to them. They are engaged in the work which the Lord has for that church to do, and doing their part they have claim on the Church's recognition, and, if need be, on the Church's protection and support. Let this Church unity be realized and let this Presbyterian body be filled with vigorous spiritual life and health and let this principle of unity have full play and then the weakest congregation in the land will be filled with vigour and courage, and will have feelings of satisfaction and elevation in contemplation of the face that they are a Presbyterian congregation. And the minister who undertakes to do the Church's work in a new sphere where there may be a few who love the Gospel and are willing to support it, but many who care little or nothing about it, will not feel himself like an outcast left to sink or swim to live or starve as the case may be-but will be inspired with alacrity and confidence by the fact; that he belongs to a Church which recognises its unity, and whose river of life extends to its farthest extremities. Again, this spirit animating the Church will direct her in her work among the young. Now that the State has engaged to provide the : means of primary secular education for the children of the country, is the Church to have nothing to do with educa- I don't ' She has still to do with it, as ever she has had to do with it. The lambs of the flock were ever to be fed as well as the sheep, and the obligation on the Church of old is the obligation of the Church still-to train up the children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Just as parents may avail themselves of various agencies and appliances. in the education of their children, so may congi legations and churches ' avail themselves. It matters little by what agencies they ! be taught to lead and write and count ; "but it is of great im- j portance that they be directed as to what they do read, and I as to how they shall think, and feel, and act, in such a 1 guidance and superintendence of the education of the young ! there is ample work for parents, and congregations, and I , presbyteries, and the General Assembly. But what I wish I fathers and brethren to consider is what should be done by the Church, as a Church, for her own children, We have Sabbath schools, and this supreme court | has from time to time expressed its interest in their management and efficiency. But, surely, with the evolution of events and the progress of society there is a call for the Church to take them into still closer connection to recognize them as under her surveillance and to regulate their management, to that through section and Presbytery. and General Assembly, the religious education of flu Church's children will receive loving attention and further consideration One matter stands prominently out eCrn me the attention of the Assembly, namely, the pnnxoTà suitable religious literature for our congregations and 8th bath schools now that the means of communicate with the large Presbyterian Churches throughout the world are so easy, it is quite practicable for Uns Church through its own committee, to establish a depot, and nrS all that may be required, and thus greatly increase in power for good in the land Again, this same opinion unity will help the Church to the solution of her great diB culty regarding an increase in the number of candidates for the holy ministry This Presbyterian Church is an organi- ed society and it is the belief of this society that the Church should have a studious and learned ministry And how have they bon obtained J In newly-formed com. committee is in He of of the colonies, is (being ' tied (hurdles have sent religious teachers to further and establish congregations Thus, as all are aware, our Church are, (mu it was natural for the tim. grants to look to the parent Chimes for a supply of mines! this But here, as elsewhere , is soon to the Church was formed there arose a desire for a native ministry and for that what have we don 9 The Church has, by a creditable effort, succeeded in raising a large sum of money, and in electing, with State assistance, unable edifice known as St Andrews College where it was provided that those who might desire to study for the ministry might aforenamed lation, receive board and lodging and tutorial assistant during the University curriculum for all which they would have to pay and on becoming graduates they might receive elsewhere theological teaching from three tutors, appointed by the General Assembly This course demanded much time and expense, and few were found to take that course In the alarming circumstances last Assembly was pleased to suspend the existing law, not with a view of lowering the standard of knowledge required but of widening the door by which those who might otherwise have obtained the required knowledge might enter in Something has been done but still the difficulty continues and that difficulty must be overcome bathers and brethren, should we not learn something to help us in this matter from the history of the Church In all ages, both under the old dispensation and the new, the Church has been taught to help herself And how had she done so ? Just by establishing schools and colleges specially for training ministers of religion Time would fail me to enter into the history I would simply remind you of what was done by John Knox and his compeers and successors in Scotland, and of the provision made by success give General Assemblies for aid to candidates for chemistry from the funds of the Churches rangements for education which, carried out for centuries, have, as an American writer has said, made Scotland the head of the nations of Europe and the world I would remind you of the princely theologian, John Calvin, whom Bancroft calls the father of popular education,' and whose first can was to raise up a thoroughly instructed and trained! ministry I his distinguished divine, in his system of Church government, made provision for the education of young men for the ministry, thus -In order that the <_ hurdles may be always furnished with a sufficient number of pastors and other persons fat to govern them and preach the Word of God unto them, they shall be advised to choose those so holms who are already well advanced in good learn hair, and are of the most promising, hopeful parts, and to maintain such in the universities that they may he fatted and prepared for the work of the ministry ' I will detain you with just another reference to the Church in Lnijuud in Westminster Assembly times Some of the principal members of that memorable Assembly united with others like minded and formed a society for the maintaining of students of choice ability at the University, and pure Bill in order to the ministry And to show that our highest regulation t equalling a course of five years'Collegt training in this age of boasted enlightenment was a very modest and humble one, I may state that the society refer red to made provision for the maintenance of those promising scholars for eight years five years to be spent it preparatory and classical studies, and three years of unity in one of the universities Now, what can we dom this important matter some nine E IA our Church is sound and weakened cannot accomplish much but if we realise and manifest on church unity, we may do great things I will tell you of what a Presby station Church that 140 years ago was weaker that) ours, did in 1939 In that year the SA and of the Presbyterian Church in North America, consisting of about 50 ministers, took measures for establishing an academy and these were two of the regulations that there be a school kept open where all persons who please will send their children, and have them instructed gratis in the languages, philosophies, and divinity A In order to carry out this design it is agreed that every congregation under our care be applied to for yearly contributions' that Church has now over 8000 ministers and 10,000 olden What has been done in the past can be done in the present, and shall be done in the future A Church s power depends not on its numerical extent A church with 60 ministers and 60 representative elders in her supreme court, if their hearts be right with God, and their souls on fire with love to Christ, may by personal labour and by wise planning, and by various agencies, happily influence the nation from circumference to centre Such a Church will teach her children and will take of her most gifted and promising children, and teach and train them for his own holy ministry, and as the earth produces flowers and plants and trees that form but ornament and glory, and called to her in turn refreshing and renovated power, so will such a Church receive all times of refreshing and renovated strength, and will abound in the work of the Lord And such a Church will look beyond her own immediate field of labour, and heartening to the voice of her Lord, her enlarged heart will take in the world, and wherever she finds means and opportunity she will set up the standard of truth, and endeavour to enlist soldiers for the army of the Heavenly King And now Fathers and Brethren we meet on e more in General Assembly, and I observe with thankfulness that as invasion aware not a single individual on the roll of last Assembly has been removed by death The Lord has been graciously pleased to state all the ministers and all the elders We will miss from our meetings our honoured brethren the Rev Dr Steel and the Rev Principal Kinross, but we may be sure of their remembrance and sympathy with us though on the opposite side of the globe let us apply ourselves to the work the Lord sets before us, and strive in all our meetings to realise our oneness in Christ, and our Church unity, and to manifest the spirit of brotherly love and Christian forbearance thus we will do something to commend our holy religion und deprive all waiting and ver sales of ground for speaking reproachfully Let us endeavour so to manage this General assembly that no brother will return with a wounded spirit, but that all will feel refreshed and strengthened, and elated with the thought of beingoflieo-bealers in a living scriptural Presbyterian Church With such a spirit let us address ourselves to the work to which the Master has called us in this General Assembly ' the Rev J Miller Ross was then introduced to the Assembly by Mr J PAXTON, and. his credentials having been read, he was warmly welcomed by the Moderator. Mr David Bruce, a depot) from the Presbyterian Church in New Zealand, was also introduced and welcomed. Some formal business having been transacted, the Assembly adjourned until 10 o'clock this morning.
