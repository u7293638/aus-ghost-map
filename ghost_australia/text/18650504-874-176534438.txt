Improved Ghosts. To show how far we are in advance of the mother-country in our institutions, we have improved upon the old conventional ghosts, and, instead of having them to appear after people are dead, we find them appearing in advance of the period of dissolution. The Riverine Herald tells of a Mrs. BEST, who lately " distinctly saw the figure of her husband at her bedside, the evening before his death took place by drowning." If this method be only properly carried out, a great deal of expense will be saved to the country ; because, if people are always able to anticipate the mode of their decease, they will be able, in cases of murder hitherto mysterious, to give full information " leading," in the language of the Police Gazette, " to the discovery and detection of the person or persons concerned in the offence;" and perhaps, in some cases where the telegraph is available, it may be possible to prevent a tragedy. This improved ghost business cannot be too much encouraged.
