THE BEACONSFIELD G 110. ST. Sir, — Will you kindly allow spaoe for a few remarks on the above subject, viz., the ghost. This individual, who is either a fool or villain, or, perhaps, a mixture of both, is causing quite a sensation in t!ic place. Children are afraid to venture out after dark. Women, whose husbands are out or gone to work at night, are aroused and alarmed bv this nocturnal visitor knocking at the door, arrayed in white from head to foot. It is time that this game was stopped, or the results may be very serious to females thus frightened. I trust the police will do their best to capture the scoundrel. Perhaps a little more energy on the part of the police in this particular might be beneficial ; and by way of adri.-e to the ghost I may say that public sentiment is against him. More than the police are on the look out for him, and he may fall into trouble one night that he will be very sorry for, so if he has an ounce of common sense left he will take advice and stop his capers while he is safe. — Yours, etc., A Resident. August 14.
