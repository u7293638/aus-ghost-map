A Ghost in the Dublin University. Considerable anxiety, says a Dublin journal, February 20, has been excited in Trinity College by the alleged ap- pearauce of a ghost in the College Park A few days ago, between 5 and 6 p.m., a member of the University Harriers, well known for his athletic prowess, was returning from the pavilion, when ho was surprised to see the figure of a man run ning swiftly round the park. He immediately gave chase, but to his astonishment the figure easily outdis tanced him, and disappeared, apparently through the closed door leading to the dissecting room. He at ouce examined the building but could find no trace of tho mysterious athlete. He told the circumstances to a friend aud they determined to watch at the same hour on the following evening. Stationing them selves- behind a clump of trees they waited for some little time, when sud denly they became aware of a shadowy figure gliding swiftly by. They both, pursued at full speed, but were quite unable to get elose enough to make out anything of the strange visitant but a mere outline of the form which made for the Anatomy portion of the Medical School Buildings, und there disappeared! us before, leaving no trace behind him Much perplexed both returned to the College, and the subject has been much discussed since, both gentlemen being positive as to the eideuce of their senses. It has, at ail events, suggested a subject for an essay to be read at the Philosophical Society at their next meeting, when some interesting experi ences tendig to elucidate the subject will probably be related.
