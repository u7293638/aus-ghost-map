Legendary Lore. Legendary lore is so acceptable to tbe people of Germany that tbe old and young alike ara familiar with tbe rich Btores of wisdom or romance tbat bare come to them from a picturesque past. It never occurs to tbe sincere G-erman mind tbat anyone can make light of such stories as those tbat are told at the fireside on winter nights when the storm-king is abroad - in his might. They have legends of love, and legends of hate, legends to make laughter, and legends that are dark, stern, and tragio, like those of the'Black Forest. No trace of conscious Christianity can be found in them, but there is often a lesson of heathen philosophy com bined with weird, wild tales of tragic origin. One of tbe legends still popular among the credulous is that of 'The Wild Hunt,' and old folks tell it to the children when a sudden noise is heard in the night, ns tbe wind rushes by. ' It is tbe wild huntsmen, take thou care,' and the children are glad to be safe between their feather beds. Tbe legend runs thus: The Lowenberg, one of the seven mountains, was the hunting ground of a wicked squire, who.hnnted every day,' not excepting Sunday, when man and beast were supposed to rest. But this was not the worst. He had no respect for tbe Church, and on one occasion hunted a wild boar and drove it into a Cburoh, where he slew it at tbe foot of the altar. For this act of sacrilege be was torn to pieces by a paok of hounds sent from the infernal regions for that purpose. Ever since then tbe Sabbath-breaker'^ ghost is doomed to ride in a spectral train with a band of hunts men, who. like himself, are expiating their sins, and with a pack of demon hounds at their heels, he being doomed to lead the wild hunt forever.
