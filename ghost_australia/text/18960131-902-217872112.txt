. haunted by ghosts. It. is pot generally known, in connection with Rudyard Kipling's early life, that to be haunted by a terrible apparition, which took tho form of a grandmother's ghost, was almost tho constant platruo of hiB existence as a boy.. .One day tbe . ' guardian of bis youthful years ' discovered him in the garden danoing wildly round a small tree and soundly be labouring it with a stick. In j-reply to her .anxious inquiry as to the reason for this strange conduct, young Kip ling assured hoc that ho was trying to thi-ash his grandmother, who was for ever appearing before him in an awful shape. -Then the good woman took Rudyard's place, and Rudyard assumed the role of the bush, He saw no more grandmothers that day at- least. Still, as time went on this habit of seeing apparitions developed to the boy, who com plained again and again of strange figures being seated in chairs or standing before him. Eventually an oculist was consulted, who recommended a particular land of spectacles, with the result that the apparitions were effeotually and permanently banished from his presence.
