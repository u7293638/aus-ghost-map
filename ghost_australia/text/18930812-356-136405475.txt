IMPRISONED BY DEPUTY. -4-~-- TilE French are a practical people (says the Mlelbourne Standard). For many years it has been the custom for the more explosive Parisian editors to to keep a ' ghost' round the corner. Generally the 'ghost 'is sipping ab siathe at the nearest caf6. But he is the titular editor. And when the paper falls foul of the authorities, and the editor has to go to gaol, it is the ghost round the corner that goes. The scheme is convenient. · Justice is satisfied, and the paper comes out as usual. There is an established bureau in the Rue Druot, with a register and a tariff, for the supply of 'doubles' for wealthy citizens who are averse to hard labour. It does a very thiiving business, and does not limit its resources to catering solely for the requirements of newspaper men. Any gay young man whorfalls foul of the police can, by a little judicious squar ing, send round to the bureau for a substitute, who, for a pound a day, payable in advance, will take his place in prison and do the allotted time meted out for venal offences. For higher grades of punishment the tariff is a little more, and usually comprises an extra sum of £5 for a new suit of clo hes upon release from gaol. Consumrnors of Wax /estase must be careful to see that they get Bryant and MIay's only, which are the very best in quality, and 20 per cent. more in quantity than the foreign madewax vcstas. Bryant and May's Plaid Wax Ve6stas are made only in London, and have been awarded 19 Prize Medals for excel lence of quality. Every box of Bryant and Mlay's Wax Vcsths bears their name, on a white ribbon, inside the well-knoMwn red, black, and blue star trade mark. Ask for Bryant and MIay's Wax Vestas, and do not be deceived by the inferior article. 4309
