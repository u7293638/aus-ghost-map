One of the events of the year in pastoral circles is the annual sale of stud sheep. breeders from all parts of the Continent as well as Now Ze land and remain, attend, and the character of of the sections and the prices the antm ils realise are regarded as a good indication of the state of the squatters throughout Australia. The result of yesterday's sales, which began in the large store of the New- Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, would seem to nil case beyond all doubt that the flockmasters, despite fairly good seasons or late, li ivo felt the general depression as it has all other class of the community It is generally admitted that the sheep ponies are a distinct advance in all-round quality on anything that has yet been offered at auction in Sydney but in spite of this the bidding was throughout the day dull and spiritless, and very low prices ruled the salesmen who had secured the right to firstsubunttheir Jients'sloekweieMessrs Grtfftthsstid YY'i at er, and about half-past I o c )ck Mr YY'eivor offered four racing stud rams and 71 selected rams belonging to Air. 11 0 White, the proprietor of the well-known Havilah docks Before doing so Mr Of iver sid that the display of s crop was a great improvement on any that had been offered in the past, and this was gratifying, as it showed that the flockmasters of the colony were beginning to pay more attention to the quality of their sheep, and this meant better wool and higher prices his first animal submitted vi is a two-year-old speech When it was put up, there was a very large attends nee, which was well maintained throughout the day. the beast was a fino-frnmedaud heavily woolled, with a mee Initions fleece, but the first bid for it was only 20 guineas , two guinea bids carried the price up to 30 guineas , then the bidding proceeded at the rate of 1 guinea at a time, and the animal was parted at 40 guineas to Mr. Mate The next special stud ram was quitted for 13 guineas, but all through prices were low but as the auctioneer had announced that the vendor had no reserve on any of his sheep, although he claimed the right of a bid for his two last lots, most of them were disposed of. The second of Mr White's r ma was the two-year-old Agitator, sired by Henry George, which Mr White valued at 500 guineas. This figure was too high for the times, and the ram was passed in. Another two year-old, valued by the owner at 200 guineas, also failed to bring that place, and was reserved from sale The highest price obtained at the sale of merino sheep, which were all from New South Wales, was 150 guineas, paid by Mr JT. Dent for a magnificent animal bred by Mr J. T) Cox, of Cullenbone The ram, which is three years old, won the National Prize at Mudgee this year, and exports state that if the condition of affairs in the colony had been in anything like their normal state almost three times that amount would willingly have been paid for the beast Mr Dent also paid the second highest price that was realised, was, 100 guineas, for a nice animal Unit was submitted by Mr E House, jun In all Messrs Griffiths and Weaver sold 237 sheep for £1922, as against 132 last year for 26oz.
