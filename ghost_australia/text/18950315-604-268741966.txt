Spiritualistic Frauds, I Mi- Maskelyne, in an interview which appears in the '■ English Illustrated Magazine,” gives the following account oi now helfirst began to suspect the bona fides of spiritualism :—“ The first awakjep..,, ing of my interest in the exposure >\jef spirituajpsjiic frauds warpse4ttv--thi*-»Bijr^ "a man apd woman who professed to effect cures by mesmerism.- About that time table - turning became a fashionable amusement, and the Fox family had startled America by a second edition of the * Cock-lane Ghost.’ Well, these mesmerists commenced to hold spiritual istic seances, and one day the woman brought to our shop what she called a surgical appliance to be repaired. It con sisted of two levers, a long one and a short one, each mounted upon a pivot attached to a strap, and connected by a piece of catgut. As you may suppose, I en tirely failedto see what kind of surgicalap pliance this thing could be, and wascurious to discover its real use. Having re paired it, I devoted a few minutes to experimenting with it, and found that by buckling the strap of the short lever round the left ankle, and that of the long lever round the leg just below the knee, by pressing the right heel upon a projec tion at the side of the short lever the long one could be jerked up and mads to strike the under-side of the table. Accord ingly, I booked it as a table-rapping apparatus, and the bill was sent in : 1 Rel pairs to table-rapping apparatus, is. fid.1 This I considered very sharp on mv part at the time ; but it was about the worst thing I could have done, as it pre vented a complete exposure of these im postors being male. Although several persons, at- my suggestion, attended;the seances afterwards, with the object of catching, the lady red- handed, no table rapping was ever attempted. This was a lesson by which I pronten, gready in rny subsequent investigations.” ’
