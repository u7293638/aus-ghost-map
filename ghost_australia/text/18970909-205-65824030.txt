Burial in |hi| Air. Under the inluew-e o., the mission aries the Indians of .Montana are fast sbandoning their old custom of placing their dead on platformn. or hanging them, wrapped in blankets. to the limbs of the big cottonwood trees which grow along the streams; but now and then the hunter or cowlor still finds one of their old pintaoru: cemet,'rtc i, or, it may be, only a tomb standing in the s,.litude of the vast, grass plains. The or.ginal object of this told way of dli. ,oing ,of corpses was n::doubtedly to pr?:,'et them from the wolves, which would speedily dig upn any gr v- sntch a. the Indians could make wilth or i ieks and shovels. In course tf time the rude platform would be up turned by ds ecay and the winds, but the Crow or Black foot kinsmen of the deceased had done their duty in the way ot sepultnre as well as they could and were n,,t re muonsible for such accidents. After all, the main thing was to satisfy the ghost ptf the departed so that he would go at ace to the happy hunting grounds, content with the honors paid to his re mains, and not hang about to haunt his ralatives.- .
