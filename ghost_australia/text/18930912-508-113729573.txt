A WORTHT/ESB! rKTSTTTTTTrOK'. The great bulk of members of the Legislative Assembly hold the opinion that the Trades Dis putes and Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration Act has proved a great failure ; and that to keep such a measure on the statute book is both an illusion and an -unnecessary cost. This remarkable Government measure, which was to cast oil for ever on the troubled waters of industrial strife, occupies the unique position of having been in existence with its machinery in full operation while the bitterest and greatest strikes of the time were going on. The Broken Hill strike was fought to starvation points and prison issue3, the colliery strikes, the seamen's strike, and numerous other disputes were carried out to the bitter end, while the ghost of conciliation and arbitration rattled through the court offices, with nothing to do, like some troubled spirit that not even high pay from the Treasury could appease. The whole business is pronounced a thorough failure, and the expense and trouble would be recognised as nought but for the fact that once more is proved the failure of artificial effort, as with protection, to rectify the deepest wrongs afflicting and dis turbing the toiling hosts of modern communi ties.
