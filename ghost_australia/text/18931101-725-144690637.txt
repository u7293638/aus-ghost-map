THE WILL- O' -THE- WISP. Nobody nowadays entertains any super stitions ideas about the will-o'-the-wisp fcxotpt, maybe, a few people iu isolated localities where ignorance ot the common natural laws still prevails. The advance of soienoe has dissipated many of the old superstitions, and the mythical Jack with hie lantern ig one of the sabiaots of its riarid investigations in the material world. The will-o'»the-wi»p is a very simple affair when one knows about it. It is a combination of phosphoretted hydrogen, a combustible gas generated from deoaying vegetable matter containing a considerable amount of phosphorus. A deposit of seeds may throw off enough of ^ this gas to make a feeble light, though this latter ooours but seldom, and it not unfrequently hovers over old wells, ? lending a weird, ghostly interest to the old ruins to whioh it most likely owes its origin. It is not unfrequently mixed with nitrogen and marsh gas. Both gases are oombustible, but the will-o'-the-wisp is bo heavily oharged with phosphorus that it burns spontaneously. Oarboretted hydrogen, always present in Borne degree, plays the part of lanternbearer to the phosphoretted hydrogen, be*ng lighter.than air. TUb is1 the rush-light of the lowlands, whioh seems always to elude class pursuit, but this is easily accoanted for. Tho par Buer, in his chase after the phosphoric curio sity, displaces the air more or less, driving it before, thus constantly poshing this luminous gas away. Should one run away from it, it would most likely turn paraoer. A brisk breese takes this natural light - bearer out of sight at onoe, but a slight movement of the air will give it the weird, uncanny motion and ghost-like suggestion of some uneasy soul, prowling uboat in ssarch of ill-gotten gain6, or doing earthl; penance for its crime.
