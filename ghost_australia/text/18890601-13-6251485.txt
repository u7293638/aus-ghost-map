RANDOM PAPERS. in Quivis. AN UNLAID GHOST. In the course of these desultory papers of mine I have frequently had to make the most abject confessions of ignorance concerning subjects of vital and even overwhelming importance 'There are men of mv acquaintance, enviable and blessed men, who know everything, from billiards and breechloaders to "Euripides" and the differential calculus 'They go through life from the cradle to the grave without ever being forced to say " Don't know " about one thing, while I am ever being constrained to exclaim with Pascal, "Je suis duns wie ignorance sirable de tonta shown They know all about free trade and protection, for instance, whilst I have ever avoided these topics as though they were twin lemons sent to harrow my soul It is not my fault that I have ever been at the mercy of the last speaker whenever the old, old controversy has been reopened I remember the time when I honestly endeavoured to grapple with the question, and reduced myself to the verge of insanity by m> fruit less efforts to get at the meaning of Mill, and Ricardo, and lowers It is all very well for you, my brother, who love figures," to sneer at the unfortunate man with whom they will establish no common relation But do you understand Wagner or Beethoven do you lop g for the music of the future as for hidden treasure You do not, because you have no musical ear 'Turner for you is a mail rhapsodies on canvas, because you are colour-blind When the poet tells you I watch unwearied the miraculous eyes Of dan n or sunset the soft houses which face Hound stone city Dried, in a lonely place, Thrilled with low whip rings and strange silvan sleep - he speaks in an unknown tongue of which you can never know the alphabet So, my arithmetical brother, do not be too hard on an unfortunate who is destined through life to continue-arithmetically-a babe and suckling, seeing that you also have what the French term " the faults of your quali- ties," Such being my) relation with " figures," it may easily be understood with what satisfaction 1 havoobservid that free trade and protection as debatable topics have drifted away from the speech of Victorians and become as good as dead and buried People in England may say of protectionists with a sneer that they are capable of empowering a Royal commission "to inquire into the work mc of the multiplication table " A veteran liberal like the late John Bright may writes free trade gives us freedom to buy and increase our buying, and the more we buy the more we soil, and the greater our trade even in spite of the hindrance of foreign tariffs " An American writer may, speaking of the lords of labour in his highly promoted land, was such hard words IIB these -" these men cannot stop the brook that runs the mill, but they can chain the wheel , they cannot hide the coal mine, but this) can close the shalt for three days every week To keep up the gold digging rates of dividends they declare war against plants The majority) have never yet been able to buy enough of anything 'The minority have too much of everything to sell ' All this may be very true, but no one has rejoiced more than I have that further debate has for years past been silenced by the comfortable issue rance that" protection is the settled policy of the country " But in literary and debating societies, as I have more than once observed there are daring lining souls who persist in rushing in where older and weaker men have ceased to trench, and then sometimes evolve ghosts of long dead controversies which were fondly imagined to have been effectually laid. When I went the other night to a meeting of the Australian Church Literary Society, I found that one of these unlaid ghosts had been summoned, and when I learned that it was the tell "I Free Trade is sun Protection question, I inly ejaculated " Hast thou found me, O mine enemy '' the lecture hall of the church, where the meeting took place, was filled with a large audience of intelligent sending men and women It was a very representative audience too, including as it did the beardless stripling not half way through his apprenticeship, and the hoary old gentleman who thumped his stick and cried "orders in strong Scottish accents-the labourer and mechanic at the one end of the industrial scale, and the manufacturer and merchant at the other On a platform were the champions of free trade and protection, and a denial gentleman who acted as chairman 'The freetrader is my friend J-, who in private life is the most retiring and modest man I know, said he surprises me by addressing the assembly with the ease and fluency of a veteran debater 'He mc, as to many others present, his opening words are little short of blasphemy), for they are these "I intend to prove this evening's) that protection cannot by its very nature, help to make any country prosperous, but must be a hindrance , (2) 'The prosperity of Victoria is due to very different causes from those of protection, (as) Victoria is by no means as prosperous as it would have been under a system of free trade " For the reasons I have given at the beginning of the paper, it is impossible for me to describe how he did it, but before he sat down every one of his three these seemed to me to have been established on the dinner time basis, and I began to look upon pro leccionista as so many) robbers and on posters by means of a " bottle maker" engaged in an unnatural industry, he showed us how capital was directed Into unprofitable channels and by means of one Samuel Kinder," a farmer, who had paid i'JIOOdenrer for his machinery under protection than under free trade, he demonstrated how agriculture, a natural industry)," was dis- couraged He was followed by the exponent of protection, in the person of Mr Trenwith, M L A" than whom no more authoritative speaker on the subject could surely be found. My modest Friends spoke well, but he could not give to his tones the fervour of, burning conviction which made his opponent BO formidable and effective The broad cheat under the ample pea green waistcoat dilated, and the eyeballs behind the apes faces shone with honest enthusiasm, as the Trades-hall orator showed how protection had come in the nick of time, like a beneficent deed of marines, to save Victoria from misery and famine. Who could resist the burning conviction of such a passage as tins The fact is that protection in this country has not only enabled us to manufacture a great deal of what we use, but to give the consumer a better article at a lower price. ('Nonsense,' and cheers.) I say a better article at a lower price ('Shoddy,' and 'Prove it') That's just what I am going to do "I don't know whether he proved it-in fact, I have an impression that he did not-out nevertheless I felt that when he sat down he was thoroughly justified in saving "Protection has enabled us to move forward in every direction We have more improvements, more wealth, and less debt than our free-trade neighbour, which has every natural advantage over us ' 'line conviction that he has proved his case is deepened when a Jewish gentleman whom I had met in freethought circles on previous occasions avers that since protection was started the people here have found industries to support them, and the unemployed difficulty has ceased. (Hear, hear ) I think there is very little doubt that all free-trade countries are nothing but the receptacles for the penitentiaries and workhouses of the old countries " (Laughter ) He is followed in the same strain by a prosperous looking gentleman, who describes feelingly how the auction rooms were glutted in the bad old times with imported goods, which the colonial workman could have made, only nobody would let him Under the spell of the doughty Trenwith and his followers, I am about to go over for life to the protectionists, when the canny voice of tin Englishman from the northern counties is heard sa) log - "Mr Chairman and Gentlemen Protection is a very wonderful thing the elect of pro It cotton, we are told, is to make everything cheap. Now, why can't it produce as cheap without a out) as with it (Laughter ) What would it take to grow pine apples here * ( ' They won't grow ') Oh yes, they will-in hothouse." I've seen them growing there in the old country But the) couldn't be grown as cheaply here as in Queenaland-'cheers)-because the climate and surroundings are not adapted for them. . . All unnatural machines must be worked at a loss I am compelled to think that it will take more labour to produce a good article in a country unsuitable than in a country that is better adapted for it. There was less of the burning conviction of the orator in the north countryman than in the protectionist speakers, but there was about him an air like the Q IC IX of J'uclid \- which was very imposing A atom, elderly man, puzzles everybody's asking, "how is it that England is so very anxious to shunt her paupers into Western Australia, and wants a large slice of it for herself-'' (Getting no answer, probably because everybody) thinks that 1 England still possesses all Western Australia, he causes the old Scotchman to call " Orders, order" more vehemently than ever be speaking of "Free trade Scotland-starving and miserable as she is " 1 usually, before resuming his seat, he makes a man who later on avows himself a tanner-to glare with indignation at this attack on the agricultural interest. " Oh, )c The farmers cry out about taxa tion The farmers cry out about anything. 'They are to get a large population to give them a good market, but they are not entitled to pay any taxes to the country ' ("No, no," from the irate agriculturist) The next speaker ian man of colour, who is not only a freetrader, but a philosopher, who clothes his thoughts in such rigidly logical phrases as these -"Suppose we admit, for the sake of argument, that proper turn is good and beneficial to Victoria, what is our position it comes to this-if protect fruit is beneficial, and likely to increase our prosperity), are we to consider ourselves just lied to be always isolated us a community ' Are we to look upon ourselves as all invested evil), and to keep out for ever the commerce of other communities ' For it comes to this If we stick to protection it must come to this in the process of time-we will produce more than we consume, therefore our surplus must either be exported or our manufactories must be shut up" ("Hear, hear," and cheers.) Passing over the gentleman who defended free trade and immigra- tion on the plea that "one new immigrant is the competitor one man in the labour market and the employer of live, and the stout young man who falls between two opinions, and avows that he is on the position of Pontius Pilate, w he asked, " What is truth " I came to the job) middle aged gentleman, who avowed that all women are Freetraders and smugglers From his speech tina charm tensile extract uni) be taken -"There are perhaps several ladies here who, when coming back from Sidney, have smuggled over articles of clothing in their boxes Oh, oh and laughter) or about them Merchants in Melbourne have been (made for trying to circumvent our protective policy by defrauding the revenue But I believe that of the two sexes the ladies will endeavour to circumvent this policy the most The Indies are out and just freetraders Let but Mark I'D) advertise that he 13 Bullum lit) article a penny a yard cheaper than anybody else, and they will rush up from Williamstown and flock to Collingwood They will go to the ends of the earth to save a halfpenny (Laughter ) But they are consistent, and the protectionists are not, for I have seen a man advocating protection, and that man was clothed in shortly from head to loot imported from England " (Renewed laughter ) 'I here were several who spoke after the humourist, but I kept no record, save of one, who may be termed a freetrader of the advanced radical school Hun also I had aforetime met in freethought circles, and I found him still unchanged in such passages as the following "People do not work for the sake of work. If we could pick up our clothes off the fence we would not work for them (Laughter ) Now, the blessings which we enjoy, such as light and air are natural wealth that is, really not added to at all by human labour, and ) at the necessary) to us as those which we call the ordinary succession a of life, into which the fact of the cost of production enters. Now, surely), the time of all human administrations should he to make the products into which both natural and human labour enters the cheap and as cost li as as possible, that a man, as possible may avail themselves of them Now, how are we to advance towards this goal if we were to adopt a system which keeps issues are finally high v . the principle which underlies the wings a question is, that the labourer, no matter what his wages are, should by his wages buy back his product 1 hut is the determining factor The ability of the producer by means of the system under which he is living to buy bit' by the wages of his labour that which he has assisted to produce, and not the mere rate of house, is the factor The less Interference, the leas restrictions, the leas burdens, the less officers, the less needless cost in connection with production the better for humanity (Applause) Protection is not the proper name for the opposite policy aggres sion in tile term-the aggression of one portion of the community) upon other portions of the community in order that it should get an unfair start in his " (Loud cheers ) The effect of the debate upon the others present is to mc unknown, but I suspect that us many freetraders and protectionists left the room us entered it On me, however, the result has been disastrous for till the ghost in hand again I can never feel the calm of helpless acquiescence in the " settled policy of the country " which was mine but a Oriel week ago. 'The debate has made me suspect that the protectionist may be akin to that selfish and blind animal of whom Carlos speaks in danyo, "Wer nichts tur andere that, that merits tur sich" (who does naught for another does naught for himself that it is such as he that vexed the soul of the venerable author of Locksley Hall on ely Years After, when he cried out - " " What are men that He should know him,' cried the half of sacred south Fiaschi plan hour, that hourly work their brother insect wrong ' ' Meanwhile I remain, though arithmetically a babe and suckling, willing to be convinced by him who can beat pierce the mist of ignorance which enshrouds me, bringing an my share of the business, t trust, that which Carlyle recommended in like cirumstances "A will unwearied seeking for truth, a sense open for it whenever and howsoever it may arise" 'till my deliverer comes I shall re- main a helpless prey to the harrowing doubt whether protection is the settled policy of the country " in the same way as the multiplication table is settled I know that 2 and it will always be 4, hut ! have at present no guarantee that another turn of the wheel of time may not give a majority to the baleful freetrader, who will make the settled policy of the country " after his own fashion. This state of the lungs is to me here in settling.
