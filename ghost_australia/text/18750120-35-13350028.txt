the apprentice boy, we saw the power of religion and the blessing it was when it became established in the heart and soul of an individual, this was what the Ilotbil institution was intended to accomplish to promote the return of well-being of the sea-going population of Port Jackson and he, therefore, rejoiced terms of what had been done, and trusted But the good which had been done would

this port, and hopes for continued liberal support till the committee are at liberty to attend only to the annual working expenses of the institution " He expressed the great pleasure he felt at being present at this annual meeting He was glad to find so large an attendance He hoped the committee would be encouraged by what had been done, and that during another year the debt on the manse would be
