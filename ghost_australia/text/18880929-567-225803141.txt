A GLOOMY PICTURE OF i LONDON. Gardinal Mnsing has just delivered a remarkable discourse, reported in the Tablet, in which, among other things, he gives a very gloomy picture of London and the disintegration o£ human society in these latter days : — London is ft desolation beyond tuat of any city in the Christian world. Four milliousof human beings, of whom two millions have never set their foot in any place of Christian warship ; and amoDg these two millions God only knows how few have been baptised, how few have been born again of water and the Holy Ghost. London is a wilderness. It is like Borne of old — a pool into which aU the nations of the world were continually flowing. Such is Londou at this day. The prospect for the future is no better, if, indeed, it is not even worse, for the distinguishing note of our society is the disobedience of children to; -their parents. 'The rich canuot control their sons and daughters ; the middle class cannot ' guide them, the poor cannot govern tbem.' But are things really so bad after all 1 Loudon ie worse no doubt in one sense than other cities, because it is bigger ; but is it fair to say it is worse than Paris, than Vienna, than St. Petersburg 1 And as to the young and rising gene ration, are they really more insubor dinate than their predecessors 1 Prob ably every age imagines that it is in 'the last days' of St Paul, for much the same reason and with just the eame justification.
