Quackeries. Among the minor quckeries trading on the desires of mankind, we must not omit to mention those pretending to inspire and secure love. Love philters were always much in demand, especially among the Greeks and1 Eomans. There is little doubt that veiy powerful and even poisonous drugs and herbs entered into their composition, and they often caused the madness or death of the person to whom they were administered. A similar cheat was the "Power of At traction," which was supposed to draw all men after the possessor. Of the quackeries in connection with health, perhaps the most extraordinary is that of sympathetic cures; The idea of this "Doctrine of Sympathy" was that, in consequence of some mysterious : sympathy subsisting be tween men and things, a curative influence could, be transmitted to a person at a distance from the supposed healer. Anything that had the blood of the wounded on it, if anointed with the sympathetic powder, would suffice to "work the cure. Nay, even the weapon that had given the wound; might be anointed with the like cura tive result. Sir Gilbert Talbot, in the time of Charles the Second, related to the Boyai Society his sympathetica! cure of an English mariner, at Venice, who had been stabbed in four places, and hied for three days without intermission. _ Sir . Gilbert sent. for [some of his blood, dressed it with the sympathetic powder, and sent a man to swathe the mariner's wound in linen. -Before he reached the house, a mile distant, all the wounds had closed, and he was much comforted. In three days the mariner came to thank his preserver, but lie appeared like a ghostâ€”"noe bloud left in his body." -All the Year Round.
