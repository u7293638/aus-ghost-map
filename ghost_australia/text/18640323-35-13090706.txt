INTERNATIONAL CRICKET MATCH. To the Editor of the Herald. SIR, - It has now become a matter for speculation as to what will be the nature of the game to be played by the All-England Eleven on their return from Maitland. By some it is stated that the Eleven will divide with eleven of our best men, as was done in Melbourne, and by others that the Eleven will play our first Eleven, giving them two innings. In common with others, I think that in neither case would the wish of the public generally be met. True lovers of the game, and enthusiasts on the part of Old England, would no doubt like to see the Eleven play amongst themselves, and would revel in such an exhibition, which would be something grand, but the interest would not be sufficient for all parties ; and with regard to our Eleven playing the All-England Eleven, it would be simply ridiculous - they wouldn't have the ghost of a chance if they had three innings to one. The only way in which we can cope with our antagonists with any chance of success is by playing twenty-two in the field ; and, as by some it has been considered that a better selection than the last might have been made (an opinion in which I cannot concur), I think it would be better to make a new selec- tion, as far as the tail of the twenty-two is concerned, and play a return match with that number. This would give the additional interest which many require who do not thoroughly appreciate the game. Yours, &c.;, O
