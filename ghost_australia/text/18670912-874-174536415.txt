The Ghost Story. THE Ballarat papers have an account of a haunted house in Melbourne, and narrate the queer doings of a ghost that rings the bell and tumbles down stairs. We know of a more extraordinary case. In a house at East Melbourne reside a quiet family, consisting of a father, mother, fion, and daughter, The son is about twenty years of age. Frequently of a night a ghost is heard descending the stairs after the family have retired to rest. After an absence of several hours it returns, and lets itself in again with a latchkey. ThiB occurrence was noticed on several occasions lately when a bal masque was hGld in Melbourne, and in the morning the son looked jaded and fatigued, doubtless owing to -want of sleep, having been kept awake by the noise made by the ghostly visitant, which evidently wore boots. The last time it was heard nearly half a bottle of brandy vanished mysteriously, proving that when the ghost left, it took other spirits with it. The young man before referred to has enjoined the rest of the household not to move in the matter, as he wishes to investigate the mystery himself.
