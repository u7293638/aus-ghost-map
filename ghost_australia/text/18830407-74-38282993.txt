The Man with Two Bundles.-When a woman gets on a train with eloven bundles and a hatbox or two, it is in spiring to see her examine each one and carefully stow itaway ontheseatbesideher with no trouble or excitement. The more bundles she has the happier she seems to be. But if a man happens to have more than two bundles he gets excited at once. He goes through all his pockets for a piece of extra string. Then he gets out his knifo and places it between his teeth and commences to tie his bundles all up in one package. First one bundle falls to the floor, and as he picks that up another bursts open, and as he is gathering up the pieces the conductor comes along for his ticket. In the excitement he for gets where he put it, and hunts over his entire person to find it, when the conduc tor picks it up off the seat where he had laid it down. By this time he is ready to tackl6 the bundles again. He puts one on top of the other, plants his knee on them, places the package on the floor beside him, and never takes his eye off it until the brakeman opens the door and yells the name of his station. Among anecdotes of first nights of new pieces, the following deserves a place : It was the first night-and morning- of " Monte Cristo," a drama which, for its length, might have been of Chinese origin. At a quarter before one in the morning the curtain rose upon the last act. Charles Fechter, in the character of the hero, is discovered seated in a contem plative attitude. Like the ghost in "Alonzo the Brave," "he moved not, he spoke not," but there came from the gallery, in a clear, somewhat sad but gentle voice, these words: "I hope we are not keeping you up, sir." The effect may be imagined. A New Definition.-As they passed a gentleman, one of whose optics was terribly on the bias, little Dot murmured, "Ma, lhe's got one eye that don't go."
