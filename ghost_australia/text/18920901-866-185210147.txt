Williams, J.P., on the 2Ath inst., Sub-inspector Hayes proceeded against domes Dohie, W. Dobv^; Tlioniiin Jones, and Henry Hnuip. for disturbing tbc pence by kicking' at doors nud shouting in W eld street. They pleaded guilty, and were fined 5s each, with costs. James G. Hepburn, for allowing a pig to stray, wok lined 5s, and costs. I am very ghid to see tliftt tho police have at last seen tlio necessity of taking action against the rowdy youths, who hnvn almost taken possession of tlio footpaths of n night to the «n,r,nyanre of pedestrians. Like tho spnrrowR, the larrikins arc becoming Gn Monday last ns Mr W illiam Lockwood and a man named Murray worn driving in n pony oart up Weld street tho pony took fright and bolted. M r'ljoekwood fell out behind the cart; after going about 2U)yda the other orcupanl' yviis deposited in tho road ; (be cart shafts became dcluched from the body, and the animal turned nnd galloped down the street towards home, wbera it was caught bodily. Tlie eart was ilm^ greutost sufferer. v. ftsome foolhardy (icrsnn has bcei. playing the ghost at the risk of his life for some time past. On Monday night about 11.20 a man named A n­ drew Poodc fn«d two shots nt tho ghost, but no( being an A uxiliary Foroo man, or for the want of practice, failed to bring the spirit down, although o n ly twelve yards away from it. W hilst I have 110 sympathy with the ghost if he got riddled, yet I would advise Ihoso peraons wln> Jwvfl guns not to discharge them m populated places at night, iu raso they m ight cause a vacancy iu eomo family cii'clc. To-day a youth about l o years of age was unrated neav Lidmouth for a rious offence, During tho wcok a great number of miners, have been tin-own out of employment through tlio Tasmania mnehinory going wrong. I t is expected tlicy will get the mine in full iug next week.
