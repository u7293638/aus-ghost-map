Victoria Amateur Turf Club Kaces. FIRST DAT, SATDKIUTV OCTOBER ll. ?. .(B'rTlHVEClRArir. FROM " CASMAN.")F. . CADXEIELD, Saturday. Wh£aáiá¿. &i;'àaj-. rendered, the', opening of. the; Spring "Meeting ofthe Y.A.T. Club anything, but. plea sant: td those -who ' attended ; ' at the gathering. Stain, fell! in torrents before and after each race, .which,brought:about disastrous results in variouB events. -The racing of some of tho horses cannot ba accepted as proper form, 'fhn cuurso looked afc ono period more like a large lagoon than a racecourse. Much sympathy was oxnressed with the committee and tho secretary whose Arduous labours,were frustrated to a great extent. Vory Urge fields contested each event, and fairly good racing was; witnessed. It was abad day for backers. Shortly iftor 1.Ö0 p.m.. the time allotted for the. commencement of tho raoihg, Mfr; George Watson marnhallcd 16 starters for* the Maiden Plate. The.Bey bad a decided call in thc betting a« 7 to 1. Ho looked verjr well. So did Capri at 5 to 1. Tba ground waa not suitable for Conjecture; while tho groat upstanding son ol Hughenden, Duration, appeared juat snited for hearj groin*. Norfolk was supported by tho Caulfield division on the strength of htu'ing beaten Capri in a trial. The re.uit proved the correctness of their action. Peut-être, sister to Guesswork, made most of tho running, bnt was jainmod botweon Duration and Norfolk. At the distance shadrew i out, and came on tho outside, bat this effort caused her to lose any chance she possessed, and Norfolk won by a neck I from Duration. Vnsco came very last from the distance, and ran third. After tho luncheon hour, the first Hurdle ' Race occupied attention. A rory heavy shower fell just before tho animals went to tho post. Yately, who oer j tninly looked well, wa» bandaged in ona foro log sus. I piciously. I fancy he hus done a trifle too much work. Ho was installed at a (o 1 the favourite. Tantalisor was next, and tho Adelaide horso ¡"cobelon? found good hupporfc, but unfortunately fell at the first hurdle, and took off badly. Yately made all tho running at a merry pace, attended by Sinking Fund and Tantaliser. Thc J utter headed him wheu tho straight was reached, but gave way. Sinking Fand then nearly ran him down, and , just managed to defeat tho favourite. A protest was talked of. Harden, who rodo tho wiuuor, came in for an ¡ ovation, as ho now belongs to tho reformed order of ¡ riders. A subscription of over was col I lectod for him Wost Coast broke down badly. Ringmaster never left his party in doubt about the result of tho Foal Stakes. He is a very nice taking colt by First King, from tho imparted Yardley. Ocista led to the half distance. The Sydney filly Umbra displayed rare dash of pace, and was beaton by only a neck for second honours. Lady Adelaido foll inside the distanco; but her rider, although trodden upon, was not injured. Norton, who rodo Phaon, waa disqualified for three months for having disobeyed the starter; but it is 1 hoped, as tho lad hails from an adjoining colony, that the I executive will sae fit to altor such an extreme measure. The Caulfield Guineas, which was surrounded with so much mystery, and provided suoli a haudsomo income for the metallicianB, was next set down for decision. Each owner was confident that he would win ; but the hoavy going j militated against the chances of some, while it increased those of otkors. A better conditioned lot of colts it would bo hard to find. Tremando and Helene looked pioturos, and were full of muBcle. ii nf us was handsomo, but rather j small. Gratitudo had evidently undergone good sound I preparation, while Sandal was completely neglected by hor carty, .-o little was thoueht of her chance that ono gontlomau wau ted to advise her owner to scratch her. Sho, h o vre vcr, got well away iu a bad start, with Gratitude in front. There tho pair remained with Helene nest, and in that order they finished. Sirocco was fourth, and the favourite was never dangerous. Tremando was nearly last. One of tho best sights of tho day was tho race for the Findon Harriers' Vaso. Unfortunately tho weights iu the race j books wore iucorrect. In fact, Press men do not obtain anymore facilities for gleaning information than can be j avoided. A fluid of 26 faced tho Btnrter, just after a very heavy downpour. The usual number of falls occurred early in therace, and an attempt at a description is almost impossible. Notwithstanding the large field, tho public accepted 4 to 1 about tho Ballarat horse, Chieftain ; 5 to 1 Abdallah, and 8 to 1 The Clown; and the trio finished iu theorder of tho hotting. Had tho Adelaide horse, YankeB Grab, or the Sydney representative, Barcoo, stood, instead of coming down at the last fence from home, a gocd race would have ensued. Fortunately no ridera wen» hart in the moe. Precious Stone, about one of tho fittest horses hero, upset a great "moral." Tho Tasmanian homo. Meteor, waa backed "pounds, shillings and ponce." Prodigal, from tho same place, ran third. ; but Country man, who is remerabeied at Randwick, looked well and ran respectably.

Sinking Fund and Yatoly led over the first hurdle, whilo Seoheloff took off badly and fell. In passing the stand Sinking Fund had a length advance of Yately, whow as a length in front of Dawdler, Star, Tantaliser, Tattler, and Concord, and Western was last. In ascending thc hill Yately took tho command, and mada tho yaco morry; while Sinking Fund, Star, Tantaliser, and Belle Brandon woro close up. AB the half milo post Tantaliser displaced the favourite, and Star ran up to Sinking Fund. At tho hurdles, just before tho home turn TOI renched, Ditto foll, and' Yately jumped badly.
