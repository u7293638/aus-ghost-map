The bazaar and sale of gifts, in aid oi ?$, Church of England, was opened on Thrr.a h night in the Mechanics' Institute and o, a very successful affair.

Going down the other side, the Art Cni?n stand was decidedly attractive with itschaste tea and coffee set, dinner service, marble clock and other prizes. Ticket holders, ecy self among the number, wishing we' miCit have our chance now and then go homse. Looking down the length of the hall I was able to notice the handsome goods on the stalls as well as watch the fac s of both buy. ers and sellers.
