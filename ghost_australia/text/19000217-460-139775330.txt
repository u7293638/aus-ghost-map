"St. Leonard's" writes:-"This afternoon' : 1 saw squads of our bushraas: soldiers jdrininz in their camp at Randwiek. Some1 [hours later I saw squads of them at a con cert, and passsages from Sartor Resartus were doing quick-step through my brain all the t:tne that the terrible amateur was f-ersonating the 'Man from the Snowy K-ver.' or with both her feet on the loud >edal wa* crashing out warlike music on . he piano.

Stones are thrown on the roof and through the window* of a house, and no one knows whence they coine. Captain freer, the master of the pilot steamer Captain Cook, cannot understand why hts house ghouJd be attacked in this way, but u goes on all the same every night from 7 o'clock till 6 in the morning. Sometime* 20 u>en hare watched al! night, and discover nothing, though the stones continue to fall.
