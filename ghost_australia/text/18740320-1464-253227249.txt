TEMPORA. MUTANTUR, &c.; Ghost of Young Lady of 1874 to " Belle of the Period " of 1974: Have you, dear, as much bother with hair-dressing as there used to be in my days ? Belle Of the Period of 1974 : Oh, dear, no ; natural hair is completely done away with now. I just send for the hairdresserâ€” who keeps for me several sets of made-up hair, and he comes and puts on the one most becoming for the occasion.
