'ITA LEX SCRIPT A EST.' (To the Editor of the Chronicle.) Sib, — YOur leading article of yesterday is calculated, like a timid man, rather to raise a ghost than allay it. Surely the term town boundary is definite and precise. A municipal boundary may con tain within.it a town, a village, or a hamlet. . The Act is clear enough. Let those who want to buy land payable by instalments apply to the proper officer and demand a lease in accordance with the form prescribed by such Act,- when the land is situate two miles beyond the town boundary. Will you, however, Mr. Editor, or any of your friends learned in the law, solve for tne the only real difficulty there is in the business. is the nearest point -from the town boundary to be taken, ' as the crow flies,' tbe public road, or the river? I reserve my own fears upon this hea& until further enlightened,' arid remain, Sir, ' . Yours faithfully. 0U An Outboundaby, (But keeping strictly within bounds.) P. S.— I thinks Mr. Editor, that you are too laard upon our sapient legislators as to suppose that they would so stultify themsalves as to ! pass (according to your view) a useless instead of a. very useful and valuable Act for poor fellows like myself.
