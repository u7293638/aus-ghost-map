A large numbor of the Sunday school children took part in the tehlesaux, the crowning of the bMay Queen and "Swinging" being the nmost pleasing out of the number; "School in an uproar," and "The Ghost Story" were rielly well illustra ted, and causedn much merriment. The tablenux illustrating sculpture, such as the fine arts, "Angels," etc., were received with well merited applause. " Where ignorance is "liss 'tie folly to lie wise," in three parts, caused much laughter, the actore doingtheir parts splendidly. During the evening songs were rendered by Mra Hewton, Mre Herkes, Miss Pauline Davis, Miss Rosa Williams, and Mr W. P. Little. "The Death of Nelson" and "The White Squall," were rendcrcd by this gentleman in such a inishod manner that comment is needless, suffice it to say that each numnbor was received in a most enthusiastic manner by the audience, The proceedings closed by the reading of the Superintendent's annual report and the distribution of prizes to senior and junior classes. Mrs Hawkins deserves the greatest credit for 'the manner in which she placed the tableaux before the, audi ence, which must, in the preparation, have taken up much of her time, :and given her considerable trouble, sonie of the teachers giving her ready and will ing aid, specially amongst these, Miss Abshton. Miss May Jones (secretary), worked well in getting singers for the concert, and it must have been very pleasing to her to seeo it such a success. We learn that the takings wore be tween L8 and LS, which is most satisfaotory, The National Anthem brought a most pleasing evening's entertainment to a close.
