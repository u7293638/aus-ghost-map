AVE IMPERATRIX! 'McttifntcB I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation." MILTON. Willie yet the trumpet's voice Is music, Before the bells triumphant peal, In solemn silence we salute Our virgin ventured Commonweal 1 with hopes and fears, for speech too deep. In humble, not in boastful, mood, We watch her as she takes the steep And perilous path of Nationhood. For down the Valley of the ShacTo" i Earth's mannered anrles pass, And o'er the empires man has made Was cs to-day the desert grass. Where are now the Persian hosts? Where have Caesar's eagles flown? Time is haunted by the ghosts Of kingdoms he hath overthrown. But not, like these, in marked might, Not in panoply of steel, Stops she forth in all men's sighted Our young and radiant Commonweal. And not by lure of conquest drawn We follow where she leads the way, We, the squadrons of the dawn, We, the vanguard of the day. Yet greatly armed art thou, our Queen! From God's own armoury it came, The blade that by thy side is seen; And Justice is its sacred name. To guard thy honour is its task From ancient shapes of civic wrong, And anarchy, that wears the mask Of freedom. Be thou bold and strong. If Freedom drowse, of Wisdom nod, That blade shall secure each cankerous ill; Swift Angel of the Wrath of God, How, clear and clean, thy Master's with So, here we raise the festal song, Here with bow'd heads we supplicate That He to whom the worlds belong May make, and keep Australia great. So, while the trumpet's voice is mute, Before the bells' triumphant peal, In solemn silence we salute Our virgin ventured Commonweal. WALTER MURDOCH.
