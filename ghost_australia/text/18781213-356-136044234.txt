WEST MAITLAND. The Four-Mile Creek Ghost.--I am in formed that this supernatural visitant has been seen in the vicinity of Four-mile Creek again, on different occasions of late. Rumour says that some of the surveyor's party down there, are perfectly ill from fright. Shots have been fired at this apparition, or what- ever it may be; but without effect. If it is some one playing up their pranks, for the purpose of frightening the surveyors, they are certainly acting their part well and are running a long time without being caught; still, if it should be any person so doing, it will be well for them to give it up altogether, for firearms are dangerous things in the hands of a number of men whose feelings are worked up to the highest pitch of excitement by the appearance of so strange a vision as that lately seen by them. 44.'i',? -t4he District 'ournt, on Tues a',' wholatlhe case' of Bramble v.
