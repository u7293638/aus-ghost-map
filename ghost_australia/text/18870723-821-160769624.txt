TME CRADOCK GHOST. TO THE EDITOR, Sir-Will yon allow me spaoe to oorreot - Mr. Jones's statement in reference to the smelling-salts or hartshorn that he used pretty freely instead of his thumb and knife? ' Wben he used the thermometer it was dipped in the hartshorn. I am prepared to prove that the raps did come when the phosphorus was on the ohild's hands. At the same time Mr. JoneB asked a question in Frenoh and - was answered correctly, the child knowing . nothing about the language. On that terrible occasion the fingernails were used pretty freely at pinching, but it failed to wake her, although the next day bUck marks were to be seen. Let Mr. JoneB rap his knuokles on Uropblack and see if it produces the same effeot as it did on the little girl's. There is a great difference between rapping on it and rubbing it on. Mr. Jones did not state what be bad in his hand when he slid it under the clothes. As it was a very late hour when the servant girl went to bed the raps were all over. As for the rapping when Sissy's - brother was in bed with her, Mr. Jones had not the nerve to lie down with her. His letter is composed of untruths, although be found himself completely mastered and iB ashamed to own the truth. 1 am, Sir. &c..; A. 8CHULTZE, Father of the Dhild. Uroonda, July 5.
