A WORD TO SMOKERS. TO THE EDITOR. Sir—I read with pleasure the article in last week's issue of the Colonist re Boys smoking," but there were two points in connpction therewith that wore not touched upon, and which I would like to mention now. First, why is it that boys smoke 1 Is it to be stamped as boys 1 No ! of course not. It is to be looked upon as grown-up, to be thought men. It is like a father calling his children to him and not expecting them to come, as for men to smoke and not expect the boys to follow. They have given them the call (example,), and are surprised and annoyed that they have answered (followed). Of course, once having acquired the habit, the youth smokes for the sake of the pleasure it affords him, but it was not for pleasure he began! Men say it is ridiculous for boys of 16 and 17 to expect to have the same priviltges as a man of 30 or 40 ; and eo they think themselves quite justified in their course. Well, perhaps so. Any way their excuse holds good here, but I ask them do they think it will hold good hereafter ? 2nd. But, above all, there are higher considerations, which I have placed below, I am, Sir, kc., A BELIEVEU In the following :—" Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost.... Ye are not your own . Mortify, therefore, your members upon the earth . . . and the God of peace sanctify you wholly, and I pray God jour whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blame ess" ....
