Hey, Diddle, Diddle. Hey, diddle, diddle! The cat and the fiddle, Are getting old-faehioned, I trow, More novel ’would be for a great wallaby The organ to play with one toe. For the moon to give chase to the man on her And the comet to join in the fun. For the evergreen rabbit to weep at the habit Of squatters infesting its run. For the novelist pale to yield up hia tale To the sheep of Bo peep’s woeful verse. For the ghost of the corner to sit on Jack Horner Whits Coroner Cats seek a hearse. For small d igs to giggle when cows give a wriggle, That lauds thorn away past the moon, Is really quite stale, as is aho the tale Of the dish making off with that spoon. Now, not to make off with a spoon when there’s I« a far more astonishing thing. And to see the moon wriggle—oh, hey diddle, diddle, In that case you really might sing. —B.T.
