A SUPPOSED GHOST DISCOVERED. Some mysterious window breaking having oc- curred in the house of Mr. Penhalluriack, in Ballarat East, the Courier reports that the perpetrator has been discovered. The servant girl, Percifone Jouva, attended the Eastern Court on Monday morning, either out of curiosity or as a witness in the case of Margaret Clarke, who was fined for breaking a window in the house next door to Pen halluriack's. Before the girl took her departure from the court, she was interrogated by Sergeant Larner as to the window-breaking in her master's house. She gave very shifty answers, and appeared uneasy in her manner, and seemed glad to escape the cross-examination to which she was subjected, but stoutly asseverated that she was ignorant of who was to blame. Suspicion, however, had fallen upon her, and Detective Hyland paid a visit to the house. In her absence the dress she wore on the Saturday was searched, and some water worn pieces of quartz or small pebbles, similar to those which had caused so much mischief, were found in the pockets of the dress. On her return she was interviewed by Hyland, and after considerable hesi tation and much prevarication, she admitted that she "just broke two of the panes out of a lark!" Shortly afterwards Sergeant Larner arrived and on 'Penhalluriack's promise that he would not appear against her to prosecute, she made a clean breast of it to the sergeant, and said that she smashed the whole of the windows, without the aid of an accomplice. She only did it for fun, she said; but a remark, which she had previously passed to one of the children, leads to the belief that she had a far more serious motive. It appears that she was very uncomfortable whilst "Larner was in the house on Sunday night, and told Mrs. Thomas that she " wished he would take his eyes off her." Directly the house-door closed on him when he left the premises, there was another demonstration. A stone came flying across the room in which penhal luriack was seated with two neighbors. The girl was passing into the adjoining room at the moment, but she stopped to say, "There's another of' em;" and sure enough there was another, but nobody could tell from what direction the pebble came. However, from that moment she was closely watched; and shortly afterwards she told Penhal luriack that he could go to bed, as she was sure no more stones would be thrown that night! After her confession, the girl was taken to her own home by her mother. Her father is a Greek, following the occupation of a miner, and is not at present in Ballarat. During Sunday and Monday hundreds of people visited the house where the alleged ghost was carrying on such mad pranks, and there was considerable excitement in the neighborhood.
