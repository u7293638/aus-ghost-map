PQ ETRY, To Lav the Ghost. You Eay youâ€™ve a ghost that haunts you. The ghost of a vain regret, The thought of the years you have wasted, And would, if you could, forget. Your heart overflows with sorrow Ab you think of tbe misspent Fast, Opportunities lost for ever Crowd memory thick and faBt. But all your vain regrettiogs Will never lay the ghoBt Which makes us. each one, at some time, His most unwilling host. For the only way to do it Is to rise to a better life, To build up the old waste places, To start on a holy stiife. To conquer your lower nature, To crucify Self, and to live, Henceforth, to a nobler purpose, Your time and your strength to give. Oh, live as a man and a Christian, And you shall have peace at the last, And your deathbed shall not be haunted By the ghost of a misspent Fast.
