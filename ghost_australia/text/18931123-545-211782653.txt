Sweet Peas and Flies. The " Scientific American," quoting from the ' Louisville Journal," gives the following. The accuracy of the statement can be tested by those of our readers who (?row sweet -ness and are troubled with flies : ' Come inside a minute,' said a Fourth Avenue dealer in pianos, yester day afternoon. 1 have discoverÂ©! tho greatest fly trap on earth and I want to showitto you.' He led the way to an instrument at tbe rear of the store on which was a newspaper. On the paper had been placed a bunch of sweet peas. At least a thousand dead flies were, lying on the paper in the immediate vicinity of tho bunch of flowers. . 4 1 threw these here by chance,' he con tinued, and in about ten minutes I noticed that every fly that alighted on the flowers died in a very short time.' Even as he spoke a number of the insects which hod stopped to suck the deadly sweet had toppled over dead. They alighted with their usual buzz, stopped momentarily, quivered in their tegs, flapped their wings weakly several times, and then gave up the ghost."
