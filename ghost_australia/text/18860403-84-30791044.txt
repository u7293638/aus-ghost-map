' Dr. Torrens bids me to apologise to you for his unavaidable absence. He bogs you to assure Miss Northcoto-" "She has gone knowing as much as her father knows. She has perused the letter. Must you return at once? Wait for him 'in case he comes over. I skall dress and follow her to make assurance doubly sure." " You are right.

You'll, find wine and brandy in the dining-room I- will be down in a moment." Dr.' Urwick opened the do_,r upposite that of the parlour,, entered, poured out a glass' of raw brandy, and drank it off. `.Then he reL turned to the little lobby on tipto', listeiied peered into the sitting-room, saw a roll of crumpled paper under the" empty fire-grate, picked that up and read it, then puttinmgit into his pocket, lightly returned to the small sideboard in the room over another 'glass.: He chuokled'to himself. " Clever dog, Urwick. When the time? comes now you canput the pressure on her."" "
