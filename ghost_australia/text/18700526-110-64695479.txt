\- .(From'the London &ots; ) S oman I: The following purports to be anaccountlit narrated by himself, of.the ahare taken' by a Jobn.Pysye,_alias IButcher_Jack" of the ]7th Lancers, in'the doingas of-that glorious yet mournful day:' - "Well,, you see, it was in the autumn: of 1854 that: theoEuglish and, French armies were lying lovingly, enioughtogether in front of Sebistopol,, that nut which took them such a time to crack.: Our cavalry had :a camp of their vown upon the hill side nearC Cadtkoi, ajid the qd., Death's head, and Crose.boues,' to which I belonged, were there among the rest, forming part of the Light Brigade. We had a separate commissary of our own, and handy men were told off from the various corps to act as'butchers. "I never was backward when there was any work t-d;i, an"d hffet Dinoe fellow's were moping helplessly in the tents, or going sick to hospital, every morning I?was knocking about as jolly as a saudboy, doing a job here and one there, and always contriving to get more or loss tipsybefore.nightfall. :If-you ever.drop across any.of the old Crimean Light Brigade, just you ask. them if they re member, .Butcher Jack,' of the Lancers, and see what the answer will- be. 'I was'as well known in the brigade as old Cardigan him. self, and in my rough and tumble way got to be quite a popular character. Indeed; ifit had not been for my inordinate fondness for the drink, I might-have got promotion'over and over again. But I used to find my way .shoulder-high into the guard-tent pretty re gularly once a week, and more than once saved the skin of my back by being known as a.willing useful fellow when sober. "One 'slaughtering day' at the commis. sary we had killed, flayed, and cut up our number of beasts, and there was a lot of]rum knocking about, for the Commissary Guard knew how to get at the grog, and were free enough with it among the butchers, for' the sake of a nice tender steak. Paddy Heffer nan, of the Royals, and I managed to get as drunk as lords before we found time for a wash, and one of the Commissary officers came across us while in this state, and clap ped, us in the guard-tent before you.could say.'knife.' .One place was as good as ano ther to-usi so we lay there contented enough all night, taking an occasional tot of a bottle which Paddy managed to smuggle into the tent where we were confined. It was getting on for moriing before we dropped off into a heavy' drunkei sleeli, out of which the Com manlder-in.Chief himself would have had a tough job to have aroused us. We must have had a long snooze, for it was broad day light before' we-were awakened by the thun dering of a tremendous cannonade close by, making the very tent poles quiver again. I still,felt deucedly muzzy, for Commissary rum, as you would know if you ever get tight on it, is hard stuff to get sober off, yet I managed to pull myself together enough to .know where I was, and could give a shrewd ,guess what all the row was, I sat up with the intention of hearing .more about it from some of the guard, but to my surprise there was'not a soul in the tent but Paddy and m?yself, and there was not even aseatry upon the door. So we both got upon end and had a stretch, and then walked coolly onut of the guard.tent,.only to find the camp utterly de .serted, not a man being apparently left in it. Turning into our tent, .we sat down,-and over a refreqher. out of 'the inexhaustible rum bottle, we tried,. in a boozy sort of way to argue out the position. Frori where the camp was we 'could not see what was going on down.in.,the tvalley.by reason of a low ridge whiclintercepted_tho..view,_'butwe could tell it must,be pretty warnm work from the hot aud'continuous firing 'which was being kept up. At lait says I to Paddy. ' Why'the devil should we be out of the funl Letas go up tthe'ick lprse liues.anad.see if there be anything loft there fit' to put ohe leg in front df o iithir."- 'Agreed, cries h^, heartily enough, so I got hold of a butclheor's axe for a weapon, and he a sword, and, half drutrk ad'we' were, and jnrstir tih condition we bad lbft off killinfg the night before, we started 'off fdr the 'sick hors.l e, hAt it was no go for a moment here, for there were but two brutes left, and one of them had a leg like a pillar letter box, while the other: was dosn on the side, and di not look'much like rising. again. Determined not to be beate'u, we started off on foot, and -maiing ouri wary rounid bli the'rear of the staff, who were on the, edge of. the littleo'ridee, iwe' dodged down into the valley just in the rear of the position of the heavy cavalry. "Fill the pot again, governor, and I may es well tell you it .was ifBaliclavi inoroing, and the heavies had already charged the Cossacks, and emptied a good many saddles. Russian horses were' galloping about riderless aid Paddy and myself parted, company to give.chase to.a couple of these .With some trouble I'captured my.orne, a 'tidy 'little !iotn' grey nag, which Ijjudged from the saddleo ind accoutrements musat have .been'.ar, officer's changer. It was easy to see fron',tlie state of the saddle that the former riderlhad been desperately wounded,'and the reins too were bloodier than a: dainty man would have liked â€¢but:I was nowaysAsqueamish, and1'mounted the;little hbrsd'inrt tinkling.' 'The moenioit I had got my seat, Igalloped up tothelHeavy Brigade, and formed' up coolly'6ii' the'left' flank of the oldRoyals.

'Thdre's no mistake, I was not much credit to them. I'.was bareheaded, and my hair was like a birchbroom in :a fit. I.was ininus'a coat,.with:;my.'shirt sloe ves tured tip to my shoulder, and my shirt, face,' and bare hairy arris were all splashed and bark. ened with blood,;which, I had picked npi'at the butchering the day before and had never wiped off, A pair of long greasy jack boots canto up to the thigh, aind instead ofa. sword I hid the axe over my shoulder.at, the slope 'as'regimental'as you' please.
