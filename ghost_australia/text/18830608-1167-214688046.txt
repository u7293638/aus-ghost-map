RELIGION AND SOCIAL PURITY. TO THE EDITOR. Sir,â€”The Social Purity movement has, among other objects, to bring about more obedience to the laws of our Heavenly Father, as regards the relations of the sexes. It seeks to abate the impurity, so common and yet so hateful to the Almighty; moreover, by preventing ruin the movement aims at abating the mass of suffering and shame to be found in the world. The New Testament abounds in denunciations of vice and exhortations to possess one's vessel in purity. From the extreme opposition which the Holy Ghost SIIOWB to sensual sin, in the epistles of St. Paul, it is plain that Christians should use their utmost energies against this most dreadful vice. When we learn that everywhere an increasing number of the very young are falling into this snare, it becomes Christians to be up and doing for Jesus' sake. The Social Purity movement began and finds its main support among prayerful people. Lately in London immense prayer meetings, attended by members of all churches, were held in the premises of the Society of Friends; also, public meetings in Exeter Hall, in favour of the Society. Let me ask the followers of Christ to ask at the throne of Grace a blessing upon the Social Purity movement of South Australia. Let us ask God to use it to His glory and man's benefit. Yours, SOCIAL PURITY MEMBER.
