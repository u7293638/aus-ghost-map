THE ANGLOMUBKAN NATIONAL ANTHEM. God save life, 0 my country, Tlie greatest upon nirtli— Victorious and glorious And Iiappv, and so forth ! God save, our noble Jonathan, God bless our gracious Bull! (Excuse these muddled epithets— My swelling hrenst is full). Chobos. Hurrah for Bullanjonathan ! Three cheers for Johnamam ! The Anglomtirkan nation Is bound to lick creation; Oeetohillikins ! Tarnation ! GoMarn 1 and likeioise Damn ! We fear no Dons and devils, Or treachery of Spain ; Our noble Maine they scuttled— We'll sweep the Spanish Main ! Beware th* Esglion's talons, The Lioneagle's paw 1 Shout "God Save Yankee Doodle " And " Dewey et ttwn Droit! " Who says we are but traders ? Why that is all my eye ! We don't sell wooden nutmegs, We make the Spanish fly ! For islands rent and riven The ghost of Philip pines ; We'll blow our mild Havana 'Mid smoke of forts and mines 1 They said we ran for shelter— Confound their knavish tricks ! We merely kept on program : " We start to shoot at six ; At nine we stop for breakfast (Qui nial pense honi soit), And then we give them gruel With Dewev et mon Droit J " Ye Royal Red Republicans, Twist not the Lion's tail! Fling out the Union-Jonathan, Whose stars shall never fail. St. George for merry Yankland 1 Break fetters from the slaves ! Free sons of Columhanglia— Brityankia rules the waves ! J. Liddell Kelly, in tlie Bulletin.
