FUGITIVE NOTES. The trays of the microbe seem past finding out But the must striking thing yet said about him is that in given circumstances pure air is a stimulant to his pestilent propensities in making man sick It capsizes all our popular ideas of sanitation to be told, as we were by an expert at the Medical Congress, that the bacillus of influenza is stirred to unusual vigour and ferocity by pure air and the presence of ozone, and that it was a wave of ozone sweeping over the world that accounted for the prevalence of this distressing epidemic "The bacillus revelled in cool pure air, he said " hence its activity in the colder months of the year when ozone was abundant" Now as this seemingly concentrated form of oxygen is the very enemy of every form of putre- faction, a new ghost has arisen in our path, and unfortunate humanity, driven to distraction by the thought of being beset by millions of micro-germs bent on its destruction, will now no longer Know what way to turn For influenza being, as stated, the precursor of cholera, we ought to combat its advance by surrounding ourselves with impurity so as to neutrality the ozone and poison the microbe, whereas if other scientists are right, this is just the way to provide the food for the "comma" bacillus of cholera morbus If "the action of ozone on the bacillus of influenza is quickening, vivifying," as taught in the Medical Congress, there can hardly be a family rela- tion between that little mischief-making entity and the bacillus of cholera, which is said to have such a capacity for the faith that is the very antithesis of ozone Altogether the position in which we are left is a bewildering one, for if we were to act on the teachings of Congress we should leave our sow ere uncrushed to resist the approach of the avant cour er, and then rapidly sweep them so as to have our house in order for the dread Asiatic invader itself The president of the Congress very aptly contrasted the medical darkness of 50 years ago with the light of science to-day, but if these contradictory views as to the food and poison of pestilent microbes represent the knowledge of our time it may be expected that after 50 years to come the people will be just as ready to smile at the guesses and the gropings of to-day. Â» It used to be the fashion to speak of Western Australia as being unripe for responsible government Never was a greater mistake 'There is that in the colonial atmosphere that has a stimulating effect on the political faculties, and the people have shown themselves just as apt to learn as the best of us There is the incident that has just occurred By the sad death of the President of the Council the chance was given for a shuffle of cards A member of the Government was put in the vacant chair, and his place was filled in the Ministry by taking over the leader of the Opposition Could anything have been finer or better shown the aptness of our friends in the West for the political finesse which is the essential element of responsible government ? By one bold stroke the tongue of the Opposition is paralysed for the time Deficits, corruption, abuse, and all the other things that are fitting to hurl on behalf of the outs against the ins are composed, and the government of the country will proceed without interruption We could hardly have done it better in New South Wales or Victoria, or any other of the experienced colonies, though we can do something occasionally Of course, there is a buzz in the camp of the outs, like a hive of bees that has lost its queen, and in the natural course of things they will manufacture a new leader of Opposition, and be able to thunder at corruption as before But in the meantime the stroke is an able one, and let no one over again charge Western Australia with having been given the benefits of responsible government before it had developed the qualities fitting it for appreciating its blessings . The strike of Israel in Egypt was not, then, on I all fours with that of the s-lver-nuners on the Barrier and the author of the comparison writes to the Herald objecting to a rigid comparison of I positions Still he maintains that the Israelites were better off than Mr Sleath's following, and sustains his opinion by reference to the flocks and herds which the departing Israelites took with them in the exodus It is true they had the sheep, but that seems to make their case the more wrongful They certainly did not acquire these when in bondage, but in that happy time before a king arose who knew not Joseph, and it was on this patrimony that they were obliged to sustain their families justas if the miners had to live on their former savings while working in the brick-kilns for wages of nothing a day and getting their own straw If Sleath and Ferguson had got as good a barns to work upon as Moses and Aaron had, nobody now would have a word to say against the strikers of Broken Hill, and everybody would have wished confusion to their Fhaiuohs As for the Israelites when free, longing for the fleshpots of Egypt, that does not go for much, as they do err was a hard road to travel and they were a fickle lot of people at the best and apart from that we dare say that there are some of the strikers at Broken Hill, too who v. Fish they had stuck to the fleshpots Still, as the strike in Egypt was adduced as a Scriptural basis for the pi people of striking it off, and as a warrant for the revolt against stoping by contract, it is perfectly legitimate to say that instead of eight hours' work and eight hours' play, eight hours' sleep and eight shillings a day, they appear to have had all their time for work, and none at all for play, with as much as they could snatch for sleep and nothing at all a day, and to gather their straw into the bargain I . . The barbarous jargon of advancing invention is becoming enriched by the term puoumagram " It is applied to the product of the pneumatic despatch, and though etymologically absurd it is likely to stick For the synt m of despatch by pneumatic tubes has wholly taken the place of the local telegraph system in both London and Paris and is fast superseding the post office It is regrettable therefore that while we are constantly ripping up our streets for alterations, and are on the eve of entering on a great enterprise of pathway reconstruction somebody does not take a note of what is doing elsewhere and seek to make provision for what is surely coming In London by an official fiction a person may fancy himself sending a telegram from one part of the city or suburbs to another What happens is that his written message is forwarded with a score of others in a little package, sucked to the centre in St Martin's Le Grand, and thence blown to the telegraph office nearest its destination, when, in order to hoodwink the people, it is re- written as a telegram and so delivered The fiction is not inherent to the system, and will doubtless in time be abandoned and in the nature of things there is no reason why 200 words, as easily was 12, may not be so forwarded at the same cost to the sender For this reason, and because of the saving of labour to the officials, the system of pneumatic tubes for transmission of messages is certain to become as general in every city as it is now in London and Paris We speak sometimes of the propriety of putting telegraph wires under- ground But the question will not be half so pressing as will be the location of the pneumatic tubes, which, being more bulky than wires, would fairly "hide the heavens" if provided to the extent of the requirements of a populous city The success which has attended beyond all question the system of pneumatic despatch in London and Paris assures us that for local traffic in letters and messages, it will in the course of not many years supersede existing methods among ourselves And while we complain of the constant untidiness of our streets under the conditions of a perpetual process of alteration and repair, the probability is that the time is not far away when the whole of the roadway will for this reason have to be torn up again and recast in its subterranean economy is . . . . Lord Jersey's advice to the Medical Congress, advocating the abolition of palaces for the hearing of the sick and the universal adoption of the cot tages stem is one of those things that ought to require no advocacy Yet so strong is the con- servatism on the subject that it has probably " gone into one ear and out of the other " so far as any practical use will be made of it. We like to do our charity on a grandiose scale, and to gaze on a magnificent hospital building as a testimony to our public benevolence On authority that is unimpeachable we know that hospital buildings got sodden with the germs of disease in the lapse of years, and cases are known in which the life of a man is not worth a week's purchase if an operation is performed on him in certain wards. The conventional idea of colossal hospitals had its rise at a time when microbes were not known, and is clung to with a personality like that which so long stood by the practice of intramural burial ground.. A crowded grave yard, with the graves being opened from time to time, was not a more potent agent for the dissemination of disease germs than is a great hospital building exchanging death germs with the patients resting from time to time within its tainted walla By general consent it is becoming accepted as a sound principle that the bodies of the dead, and especially of those who have died from infectious diseases, should be created as the surest way of ending the mischievious existence of the microbes, and in no other way than by fire can the accumulated death germs that cover the walls, and floors, and ceilings of a hospital be exterminated This necessity of bro as a purification agent against the transmission of death is on the iv o of being accepted as a cardinal dogma in the creed of sanitation, and it should be borne in mind in the founding of every hospital We may gratify our self-esteem in rearing hospital palaces to the praise of the glory of our goodness, but if we sincerely wish to benefit the sick, and tins only, our hospitals should be such as serve their purpose for a time, giving place to others losing phoenix- like from their ashes.
