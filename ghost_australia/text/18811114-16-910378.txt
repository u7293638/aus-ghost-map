By 3 30 p in a large number of people had assent bled at the spot, and the proceedings which followed were watched with great interest ] everything being in reading", the Rev D GnuKiTH, on behalf of the Protestant Hall Company, presented Bishop Hale with a band Borne silver trowel suitably inscribed and mallet, and asked him to lay the foundation stone of the new hall The Bishop then placed in a cavity of the stone a sealed bottle, and the secretary of the company (Mr J A McIntyre) read a hat of the contents of the bottle, the e including amongst other things copies of the local newspapers, current coins of the realm, and a document giving the names of the Governor, the Mayor, the directors of the company, n pre sentitives of the Protestant Churches in Brisbane, and officers of the Grand Lodge of the Loyal Orange Institution and of the Grand Council of the Queensland Branch of the Protestant Alliance 1 Friendly Society of Australia The stone having been laid in the orthodox fashion, his lordship pronounced it well and truly laid, in the mine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ' Bishop HALE then addressed a few words to those present He said he held it to be a great honour to be allowed to perform this ceremony, and expressed his thanks for the honour conferred upon him, and in the extremely hand some present of which he had just been made the recipient not only did he regard it as an honour to take part in these proceedings, but he was pleased to do so because he believed the building to be erected would contribute to the well being of the community who would use it. He was told it was to be used for meeting", lecture, and no doubt for a library and reading room, as well us for a variety of other purposes which would tend to improve the moral and social condition of the people, and raise them intellectually and religiously they sometimes found that their intentions, however good, worn not carried out, but he hoped and believed that in this instance those who had made such strenuous efforts to bring this enterprise to its present stage would persevere and not relax their endeavours, but, with the help of God, continue them, and see that the building after it was erected should be used for the good and valuable purposes for which it was intended He thought this would be a fitting opportunity to say a few words about the name of the building. There were some people who looked with disfavour upon the word " Pro- testant," as expressing something that they were not, instead of something that they were But if they looked into their dictionaries they would there find a great number of words which, although prescribed in their original meaning, had by long and official usage acquired a far more extended but no less definite signification. That was precisely the case with the word Protestant This word had now been used for over 500 years in great historical works and official and national documents, and by this long usage it had come to have a definite and decided meaning, and that meaning it had now If anyone questioned that it had such a definite meaning, he would call their attention to an extract from the coronation oath, which surely would be acknowledged as a document of authority The Archbishop or Bishop about to administer the oath asked, "Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant Reformed religion ? Who could say, after that, that the word "Protestant" simply meant that they were not something else 1 It meant that they were something else , they knew what it meant and they intended to stand by it (Applause) Then again, it was band that some people called themselves by one name, and others by Eoniotbiug else In trying to do good to their fellow men, they had to take people is they found them, and they found them naturally divided into parties It was quite as true in a good sense as in a bad sense that "birds of a feather flock together (laughter) -and they did not expect that all would have one prescribed mode of thought no such thing would happen in this world There would be different views and opinions, and people would go one way or the other as they found their minds assimilated But it did not follow because they were divided in thought that they should have hot and angry feelings towards those who differed from them They might be on perfectly good terms with those who were not of their own party, and that was what he hoped all those interested in this building would bear in mind that, though they were a party and should stand by their views, and lead others to the same way of thinking if they be lieved those views to be right, they should always entertain kind and charitable feelings towards those who differed from them He hoped from this building would never go forth any hot words of contention, but that those who used it would cherish kindly views towards all With the e words he pronounced the ceremony finished Mr D P Milne then called for three cheers for the Queen, which were heartily given Mr A Rutledge, M L A in response to calls from the assemblage, made a few remarks, in which he thoroughly endorsed all that had been said by the Bishop and expressed his conviction that his lordship s remarks would find an echo in the breasts not only of all Protestants present but of people throughout the length and breadth of the colony It had been said that there was no visible unity between Protestants, but he trusted that the erection of this building would show that there was such a unity. The crowd then dispersed, and the procession was again formed and marched back to the rooms of the Protestant Alliance Society in Queen-street On Tuesday night (says the Western Star) Mr. Hutchinson and a party of men arrived in Roma by train on the way to Cunnamulla. Mr. Hutchinson has purchased 4000 head of cattle from Mr. Tyson, and the party is going out to take delivery at Tintaburra, whence the cattle will be taken to stock country in the neighbourhood of Aramac. They purchased a lot of horses in Roma for the journey. It is reported that Mr. Tyson, who is said to possess 100,000 head of cattle on his extensive Lower Warrego stations, is selling off the present stock and will replace them with sheep, the country being well suited for the latter description of stock. Indeed, there are reports of very extensive changes in this direction on most of the stations on the border, extending from St. George right out to South Australia. The Aior mentions the arrival at Roma of 2000 Minnie Downs wethers, of which the first draft was auctioned at the Brisbane yards last week. They are spoken of as " mountains of fat, and " the finest fat wethers that have passed through Roma for the past two years."
