The death of Lord Justice Turner has created another Beries of promotions among the legal officials of Lord Derby's Government. The Attorney General, Sir John Holt, has been appointed Lord Justice; and there has been an election for West Gloucestershire, in the place of Sir J. Rolt. As Sir John Karslake, who was Solicitor-General, has now become Attorney-General, there was also an election on 22nd July for Andover, for which the learned gentleman was again returned, like a fortunate lawyer as he is. And Mr Selwyn, the member for the University of Cambridge, who has succeeded Sir J. Karslake as Solicitor- General, was tho same day re-elected without opposition. Thus the legal ap pointments in tho Government are again completed. Dr Luehington has from extreme age resigned his judicial appointments at the Court of Admirality, and no successor has yet been named.
