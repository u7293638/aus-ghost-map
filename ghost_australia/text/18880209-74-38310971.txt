SPORTING. T. T. C. SUMAIAlER MrFEETING* Launceston presented a most animated appearance yesterday from a very early hour. Nearly all the business places were closed at noon and everything wore a lh'i day aspect, while the numbers of sporting looking men with field-glasses slung and the many solicittations to purchase programmes reminded one that this was the first day of the T.T.O. Summer Moeting. Until noon the streets were thronged with people, the merits of the different race-horses being the theme of conversation. The hotels also were crowded, and the barmaids were not allowed the ghost of a show of a flirta tien. About 12 o'clock the flesh-pots-or rather ale-pots - were forsaken, and a general exodus took place towards the i Mlowbray race-course, a constant, stream of vehicles of all kinds filing along the road, much friendly chaff being exchanged between the occupants of those who passed or were passed on the way. At the entrance to the course the arrangements could be improved upon, vehicles and those who had alighted from them being jumbled up together, and the latter had to run the gauntlet at considerable personal risk to reach the narrow passage at which they were admitted. At this time the heat was very great, and a wretched punster re marked that it reminded him of smeltin' Mowbray, probably referring to Melton Mowbray. The great improvements re cently made on the ground were fully appreciated yesterday, and added much to its appearance. Not the least among them is the new telegraph-office, which afforded great facilities to bot' reporters and the general public, and the obliging operator Ihad all his work cut out for him in consequence. The shifting of the booths from the right hand side of the saddling paddock to the opposite side of the grand stand was also an improvement, and the T.T.C. are to be complimented on the judgment displa7ed in these arrangements and in the vast improvements effected in the saddling paddock, jockey and stewards' rooms and press box, which last is in every respect all that can be desired. Mr. J. B. Curran, the popular secretary, is entitled to great praise for the style in which he has carried out the alterations, which make the course one of the best ap pointed in the colonies. The course, though rather hard, was otherwise in good trim, and the races, if not of an exciting character, were good and interesting. The much anathematised "Derby dog" was abroad, but commenced his capers too early, and was ignominiously driven off by the clerk of the course beforethe racing commenced. The grand stand was completely packed with lovers of horse-racing, a large proportion of whom were ladies, many very richly and taste fully dressed. Several thousands of other spectators were also present and the thou sand and one minor features of arace meet were all tobefosndl. Owing to the tgtali sator macbino of Mr, Harris, of Brisbane, who was engaged by the eluhb to work them, failing to arrive in Melbourne in time to catch the Pateena the local firm of Collins and Co. assisted the club by working the intermediate and outside machines; using Schinnerling's patent. Mr. Harris, on learning of the misfortune, 'hurried' to Hobart, where the Tasmanian'uRacing Club' generously granted him the use of their new totalisator machine, and which was worked by him yesterday. Tie suul of £.1400 was put through, thie service being rendered in an efficient manner. The largest sum during the day went through over the Cup-£500 being about the amount invested. There was nlso several smaller machines on the ground, but were in no wise official, and to- day it is in tenued to prohibit all save those worked for the club, and the betting during the day was pretty brisk. Next to betting t?he St. Joseph's liand wasi poihaps the chief attraction and there being no savage breasts to soothe the musiclaans devoted their attention (under the leader. ship of Mlr. Bates, of the Hobart Garrison Band) to charming the ears of lovers of good music. Their programme included march, " Preciosa;" valse, " Baden t Bladen;" selection, " Field of the Cloth of Gold;" overture, "Tancredi ;" valse, " Soldaten Leider;" selection," Maritana;" valse, " Silver Birds ;" overture, " Zampn;" overture, Les Doux Magots;" valse, Amoret tentanza." Mr. Miunro, of the Garrison Band included himself among the players. The attendance numbered about 4000, and the gate receipts lshowed an increase of about -£70, notwithstanding that, thanks to the energy of the secretary, there are one hundred members more than last year. The "flat" was occupied by a great crowd, chiefly of the male persuasion, for whose delectation a number of amuse* ments and games were provided by enter* 1 prising and, in some cases, not over- 1 serupulous gentry. Upon some of these 1 the strong arni of the law caime down I rather heavily, and resulted in the ilis- 1 persion of manipulators of the purse of I sovereigns, the roulette table, the ancient 1 and educated goose and the monkey, who 1 followed the same trade despite the protest 1 of the owner of the latter, who for a time I challenged the right of interference, and I indignantly enquired " Hain't he paid a bob to come in." The constable "didn't know and didn't care, but the monkey wnar't going to draw no more ballson that ground." At the far end a booth had been erected, in which the noble art of self defence was exemplified in the persons of a two pugilists calling themselves Hawkins and Monaghan. As an inducement to patronage, the proprietor gave out that the price was " only a bob to see this are fights and one or two others which have already taken place;" a rather miraculous per forimance. Electric machines, nine pins, and other conveniences for spending money A were also available, and found patrons. The booths were well patronised. The members' h luncheon booth was run by Mr. Hook separately from that presided over by Mr. Maltman, but the new arrangement hardly worked as satisfactorily as that of last year when one caterer had charge of ,bath booths ; that of Mrs. Evans (of the Coach and Horses Hotel) was surrounded all day p long by thirsty souls, making it as much as the obliging assistants could do to supply b their customers. The large stock of edible ware was also attacked by a' hungry army who could not complain of any deficiency in that respect. Thie same applies to the other booths and stalls, which were held by Messrs. J. Blackburn (Queen's Head o Hotel), J. Walsh (Jolly Butchers), J. u Bryan, who did a roaring trade in hop 1 beer and fruit, and others. Some well , known Victorian and Tasmanian racing in men were present at the races beside a groat many bookmakers who pluckily b fielded in the face of the totalisator. Taken all round the event was in all respects quite up to that of previous years and superior to its predecessors in many ways, and the Turf Club are to be con- 3 gratulated on their success. The racing was thoroughly enjoyable, and the Two-Year-Old Stakes opened the ball. The only absentee of the seven coloured on the card was Isis. Taken altogether the seven youngaters were a good-looking lot, and Rowallan on the strength of Ihis Carrick win and private reputation was a good favourite, while Chaldean was next in demand. Abacus caused a lotof trouble, and when the word was eventually given Red Rover destroyed I his chance by whipping inside the course. Chaldean led into the straight, and thoughi 10 Rowallan, who lost ground at the turn, came gamely again, Mr. Agnew's colt won easily, while Wildlire, who finished well, was a good third. Chsaldean was bred by the hon. Alfred Page, and is by The Assyrian, out of Little Footstep, by Ring leader, out of Merrytoes, by Lord of Liune, out of Quickstep. It is no wonder that the colt can race with D such blood, and another point in his favour is that he is related to three Melbourne Cup winners. Chaldean is a neat youngster, t. and is engaged in both the Hobart and I Oatlands Produce Stakes. The Selling Race was the next event on the card, and n the eight coloured put in appearance. In such company St. Albert was greatly fancied, and he gave his admirers little ti uneasiness, as after De Borren delayed the a start for somno time by a couple of break e aways, Mr. Krushka's horse jumped off in a front, and maintained his posetition to the t finislh, winning easily. The winner was a bought in by his owner at the upset price. b The Cup next engaged attention, and the b withdrawal of Olive, Merlin, Laura, and t Branchiopods left a field of seven, 1 the same number when Sheet Anchor and t Stockwell won. ItRby, who was well sup ported by her party, was a pronounced n favourite, while Mistletoe and Ballarat h were quoted at 3 to I. Scobie turned out the favourite in excellent trim, and she impressed good judges greatly. Mistletoe is not a bad stamp, and though her trainer i was certain she would run well he was not v quite sure of her getting the distance. The useful Ballarat looked well, though t sume thought that lie had gone a gone off since Brighton. Vision pleased a those who overhauled him greatly,but the 1 doubt was about the journey being too far ih for him. Wellington is a wear land tear t sort of gentleman, and his owner was con- c fident that he would give a good account of himself. Hawthorn looked well to the t eye, but Leander seemeda trifle on the big side, though shlo is a nice type of tile a thoroughbred. Unlike the two former 1 races there was not much delay, and soon after the word was given Leander and WVellington rushed to tile front. The latter, however, lasted thie longer, and in foct the Bishopsbouros pet flattered tihe hopes of his admirers for some time. Rounding the turn from the back Ruby, Mistletoe, Ballarat, and Vision put in a claim,and once in the straight it wasplainly I seen that IRuby would have a big say at the finish, and though lMistletoo and Ballarat made a game struggle the Victorian horse won easily at the last. The winner is bred by James Scobie, 'of Ballarat,. and the victory was well received as it should have been, for the owner of Ruby is grandson of one of the 1 fathers of Tasmanian racing, the1 late Mr. William Bryant, of lingston, 1 and the owner of MIozart, Gulnare, and other well-known cracks in the "brave 1 days of old." Ruby is an all-round per former, and has won steeplechases and hurdle races in addition to club races, and altogether has not a bad record. She iso a 1 daughter of Lapidist, and travels back to 1 the good old Tasmanian blood, as her dam 1 is Mincepic, by Panic out of Rosabelle, 1 by Oohanna out of Ilosabelle by Peter Fin out of the imported SIrino. ,The Newnham Stakes was the next race, aiadd it brought out a field of ten, and Merlin appeared to have most friends, but the comparative outsider Lizzio won in gallant- style, and scored the second 'victory for Lapidist during the day. T'rhe last event was the Hurdle Race, and King Louis occupied the position of favourite at the last, thoughl there were several changes in the betting. He disappointed his ad mirers, and while the others shaped creditably, Sir Wilfred was too much for them at the finish. The winner ran a good horse, and was judiciously ridden by our crack cross-country horseman, Peter Keating. Sir Wilfred is by King Arthur (a son of Horatio and Merrytoes), while his dam is by Phantom outof Denmnark's dam.

After several false starts, the horses were got away, St. Albert leading, Jeweler second, most of the others in a bunch, with Martyr bringing up the rear. St. Albert maintained his e lead with ease right through. De Borren came up second at the stables, but never . had a show of catching tile leader, who won easily. Bay Middleton, Jeweler, and Navy Blue then made ia spurt coming up the straight and passed De Borreu.
