FOOTBALL. To the Editor of the Hamilton Spectator ). Sib, — Noticing a report of the football match between Devon Park and Dnnkrid in your Tuesday's issue, allow ae to etato that it was not only Devon Park we played, but com bined team, there bring a number. of masons from town at work (here, andoftfaese ihe teem chiefly consisted, they 'bring mostly Geelong (for the first season) played a really good game against such an array, especially when the fact is taken into consideration that they are only colts, and, when ratted against a lot of cracks, one would have thought they would never have had the ghost of a show. Hoping that the next time we play Devon Park tbe team will consist of Devon Park men, and not crack players from the leading dubs in the colony.— ONE WHO KNOWS. Dunk eld, October 3rd.
