He looked already a broken man. llurlon Smith followed him in nnd stood a moment looking down at him un comfortably enough. It ia bad to havo had such a scono as has been described at your house, but it is worse, if a man be a mon, to face a fellow creature in his timo of Bhame. " Look hero. Wibborloy," said Burton Smith at b-iigth, aa much embarrassed as if ho had been tbo thief, "it will bo bettor to hush this up. Givo mo this confounded brac.ilet to hand to Lady Linacro, and tho thing shall go no further." Hia tono was curiously Biiggcstive both of old friendship and presont contempt and pity.
