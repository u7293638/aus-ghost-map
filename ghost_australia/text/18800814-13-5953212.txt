REMINISCENCES OF ROCHESTER. At the age of six I was sent as a day scholar to an academy of no great pretensions in the city of Rochester I mention the fact because it helps to illustrate the familiar adage that the world is, after all a very small place for in after life I met at different times and in different parts of the globe, four men of mark each of whom had sat upon the same form as myself They were Charles Dickens Rogers the actor his brother the 1 Edinburgh reviewer, and the Chief Justice of South Australia I left Rochester to reside at boat Durham, in Norfolk, when I was only eight, and passed through the city but once afterwards, and then upon a coach, so that I had no opportunity of re exploring a place for which I had conceived a strong affection during the two years I had spent in it. Since then it has been rendered famous by the author of the Pickwick Papers, of the Mystery of Edwin Drood, and of the Sim y of the Seven Poor Travellers, and I can well understand the fascination which the city and its surround- ings Frindsbury and Strood, Brompton and Ellingham must have exercised upon his mind, for Rochester and Chatham, which are as closely related as East and West Melbourne, combine to form a place which is altogether six generis It is a marriage of December and May It 13 antiquity walking! hand in hand with the nineteenth century It is a fantastic intermingling of medy oval ecclesiasticism with armoured vessels and Armstrong ordnance The transition from the missive ruins of the old castle, from the venerable cathedral from the antique build- ings which surround it, and from the narrow streets and time worn buildings of the city, to the bustle of the town, and to the spectacle presented from Chatham High street of the stately dockyards and the grand men of war lying at anchor in the Medway is like a sudden leap in time of at least five centuries Yt by antiquity should possess such a fasci- nation for childhood, or at any rate for some children, in a problem not easily solved I have a theory of my own to account for it, but if I were to propound it I should do so at the risk of being suspected of insanity, and so I keep it to myself, j " With a most voteless thought Sheathing It as a sword Certain it is, however, that to the small boy of seven, whom I can look back upon and study as though he were a little creature altogether apart from myself, and quite an object of curiosity, Rochester Castle and Rochester Cathedral were never failing sources of wonder and delight The outworks of the former skirted the bank of the river, near the bridge, for a considerable distance, and between this circumvallation, with its broken bastions, and the Medway there was a broad stretch of sand at low water, from which you could look up to the grand keep, rising out of a tangled mass of foliage, and feel the magnitude of its bulk and the majesty of its altitude falling upon you like the awful presence of a superior being It stood foursquare to all the winds that blow " It was an image of massive grandeur and serene repose, which dominated all the neighbouring landscape Built in the Norman times, it identified itself in the mind of a diminutive dreamer " solo sitting by the shores of old romance, with the epoch of chivalry, with the history of England, perhaps even with the exploits of one or more of the Seven Champions of England, the narrative of whose doughty deeds was one of his earliest and dearest possessions, picked up at an old book shop near the Close gate How easy it was then to people the castle with men at arms to hang out any quantity of " banners from the outer walls, to see sentinels in coats of shining mail pacing the ramparts to fill the courtyard with coasters and the galleries with the flower of Kentish beauty, and to reconstruct-howBoever erroneously an impressive past, preserving all its picture eBqueneaa and rejecting its coarseness and brutality, its rapine and oppression Then to steal round to the river side with a companion when the moon was at her full, as this small boy did, to watch the effect of her silvery light upon those heavy walls, to hasten to the ghostly whispers of the night wind among the trees in the castle grounds, and the lapping of the river on its banks, and the muffled roar of vehicles crossing the long stone bridge over the Medway and to be startled by the hooting of an owl or by the deep toned bell of the cathedral striking the hour of nine were fearful jOys, not to be remembered without a smile at the superstitious fears which would arise as the freshening breeze, sweeping down the valley, seemed to sigh and ebb in the ears of the two wayfarers, who were glad to hurry from the solemn beauty and oppressive solitude of the lovely river side, and to regain the brightness of the narrow streets let these were also full of ghostly memories, for Rochester has been a city ever since the Roman planted his eagles in Britain and Durobrivo. was a place of too much importance, both as a military post and as a naval station, not to render its acquisition desirable by Saxon and Jute, Eagle and Dane, before the fair land of Kent fell under the away of the Norman filibuster in common with the rest of England The Canterbury Pilgrims had ridden through the place and Stothard a picture of the cavalcade, which had just been engraved, left one in no doubt of the reality of the incident The carriers, too, who were eased of their money at Gad s hill by the madcap Prince and his companions had slept in Rochester the night before, and it was interesting to speculate upon the inn at which they had put up, and to wonder whether it still maintained its reputation for the by eli ness and number of its entomological in mates There was the house in the High street known as Watty Charity, with the inscrip- tion over the door, signifying the gratuitous entertainment which it was designed to provide for six poor travellers, who would be sheltered for a single night only, afterwards described by Dickens in his " Uncommercial papers and there were shops so old fashioned in appearance, containing such old fashioned stocks, and kept by such old fashioned people, that you could not help feeling that the atmosphere of antiquity which enveloped the cathedral and the little church of St. Nicholas CIOBO by, and the pile of buildings known as Minor Canon Row, spread outward to the city, and influenced the demeanour and transactions of the staid and serious shopkeepers They all seemed to have a grave manner with them and to speak with solemn deliberation, in a subdued tone of voice, and to exhibit a certain absence of mind, as though they had been aroused out of a fit of meditation when you crossed the threshold Owing to the narrowness of the High street, and to the sombre colour of the houses, a mysterious twilight prevailed, in the recesses of these shops, and when the inmate emerged from a Bhadovvy corner be j hind the counter it was like a ghost walking out of a mist, so much so that at times the effect was positively gruesome By comparison the Cathedral CIOBB was quitobnghtand sunny' but not at all gay or cheerful Just at one place where there was a small strip of green sward and some venerable elms in which a colony of rooks had established themselves from time immemorial, there was a lawyer's office It seemed to be strangely out of place there-as much so as a spider s w es in a room from which the light is carefully excluded I see pose the flies came there sometimes, but I never saw any What used to strike the small boy most was the overpowering gravity of everybody connected with the office The white headed principals always dressed in black, and wore voluminous white cravats You might have mistaken them for archdeacons, or prebends or rural deans The conveyancing clerk was bald headed, and his tonsure gave him the look of a monk; who had laid aside his gown and cowl The common law clerk was a model of sobriety and taciturnity, the juniors looked like theological students and the office boys never whistled "Pretty Polly Hopkins, or threw stones at the sparrows or " chilled smaller urchins as of our boys did, but were subjugated by the spirit of the place, and went of errands and delivered messages with an air of dignity and decorum befitting the immediate neighbours of a bishop and a deep and numerous other ecclesiastical dignitaries Some of these ecclesiastical dignitaries were the happy fathers of very pretty daughters, who were to be met with in "the Vines, a meadow stretching between the Close and Troy, town, in the afternoons of warm summer days, and they had the effect of brighten- ing the precincts of the cathedral to an extent which it would not be easy for anyone who has long passed the heyday of his youth to describe with any degree of accuracy. On Sundays, too, when they took their places in the carved oak stalls of the choir of the cathedral, behind desks that were black with age, and under canopies that were intricate with delicate tracery, they seemed to make, no Spenser says, "a sun shine in a shady place " There were a good many other persons at matins and at vespers-", besides the small boy, who used to associate the face and figure of one of these ecclesiastical rosebuds with the picture of St. Cecilia, and wish the sermon longer in order that he might reap in greater fulness the harvest of a quiet eye The edifice itself was a fine specimen of Norman Gothic architecture, with massive circular pillars and Bemi circular arches, with rig rag mould inga and string courses, and a roof that looked as solid as if it had been hewn out of the living rock It belonged to a period of very remote antiquity, and twelve centuries had passed away since its foundation stone was laid on the site of the old Roman station, and way between London and Dover To enter it at twilight, when the mitted and mailed figures on the altar tombs seemed to move uneasily upon their stone and marble beds, when the distant shadows shaped themselves into gliding forms, when the lozenge shaped panes of glass were rattling in the windows, and when strange noises, inarticulate but awe-inspiring arose in the distance, floated past you, and died away into ghostly silence, was an experience in which there was a fearful pleasure So also was a visit to the Crypt, one of the grimmest and gloomiest structures of the kind I ever set foot in. As to the ascent of the tower of the cathedral, and the view from its summit, both have been described with such liberal fidelity to truth by Dickens, in his last in finished work, that I cannot do better than borrow the words of the great novelist " Durdles opens the door at the top of the steps with the key he has already used and so emerges on the cathedral level, in a passage at the side of the chancel Here, the moonlight is so very bright again that the colours of the nearest stained glass window are thrown upon their faces The appearance of the unconscious Durdles, holding the door open for his companion to follow, as if from the grave, is ghastly enough, with a purple band across his face, and a yellow splash upon his brow, but he bears the close scrutiny of his companion in an insensible way, although it 13 - prolonged while the latter fumbles among his pockets for alley confided to him that will open an iron gate BO to enable them to pass to the staircase of the great tower Then they go up the winding staircase of the great tower, handsomely, turning and turning and lowering their heads to avoid the stairs above, or the rough stone pivot around which they twist Durdles has lighted his lantern, by drawing from the cold hard wall a spark of that mysterious fire which lurks in every thing, and, guided by this speck, they clamber up among the cobwebs and the dust, Their way lies through strange places twice or thrice they emerge into level low arched galleries, whence they can look down into the moonlit nave and where Durdles, waving his lantern shows the dim angels heads upon the corbels of the roof, Seeming to watch their progress Anon, they turn into narrower and steeper staircases, and the night air begins to blow upon them, and the chirp of some startled jackdaw or frightened rook precedes the heavy beating of wings in a confined space and the beating down of dust and straws upon their heads At last, leaving their light behind a stair-for it blows fresh up here they look down on Cloisterham, fair to see in the moonlight, its ruined habitations and sanctuaries of the dead, at the tower s base its most softened red tiled roofs and red brick houses of the living, clustered beyond, its river winding down from the mist on the horizon, as though that were its source and already heaving with a restless knowledge of its approach towards the sea Above the city, the Medway flows through as fair and fruitful a tract of country as is to be found within the length and breadth of 1 England's country of apple orchards and cherry gardens, of yellow cornfields and green pastures, of hop gardens diffusing their aromatic odours in the autumn, and of pleasant gardens that are white with blossom in the spring, of farm houses and parks and mansions, of swelling upland and fertile western country through which the river winds its devious course fed by many a tributary spring that, issuing from the chalk, has contributed to build up the flames of successive generations of men of Kent, who trace their lineage from the heroic defenders of the soil against a succession of foreign invaders Below the city the Medway widens into an estuary, and the scene presented from the raised causeway in Chatham, or from the strongly fortified "Lines which dominate the town itself is full of animation for vessels of war of every description Stud the water or fill the docks from gunboats to monitors-vessels in every stage of progress and decay from the skeleton to the condemned hulk If Rochester is calm, sleepy and respectable, antique, and ecclesiastical Chatham is now, active, vulgar mercantile, and nautical It has all the characteristics of a lapping and 12 chile Highway It abounds with shop sellers marine store dealers outfitters maine matical instrument makers boatbuilders sailmakers publicaiiB, pawnbrokers shops in, agents, as well as with those human birds of prey that congregate in every seaport town The hideous old Jew who robbed poor little David Copperfield of his waistcoat was a reality His den was not far from Hesta brewery, and his uncouth gestures and grotesque exclamations rendered him an object of terror and aversion to all the children who had to pass his shop Never were two places SO unsullied as Rochester and Chatham, and it needed all the sanctity and decorum of the venerable city to counterbalance the railway mess and drunkenness of the more modern town, more particularly as the latter was the station of a garrison, and the rows between the red coats and the blue jackets were only as violent as if they were members of alien and hostile races Sometimes they resulted 111 pugilistic encounters only, but not centre quently they terminated more seriously The surroundings of RochestcrandCuatiiam , were full of beauty A mile away from either you were in a lovely country On one side was Cobham park, and the road to God B hill, and in another direction a series trian excursion would land you on the top pi Bluebell hill overlooking the Cromlec known as Kit s Coty House, and a spacious valley in which the names of tUB' "nr preserved a memory of Hengist and horse and where the descendants of old baton settlers still cultivated the farms which can belonged to their remote ancestors, tree whom they inherited also their light DM eyes and ruddy complexions, as well as many a curious form of the speech of early my- land
