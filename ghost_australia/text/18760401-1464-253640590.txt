THE DEATH OF THE " ATHENiEUM." After Tennyson's " Death of the Old Year " — considerably. Ah ! deep, deep lies the summer dust, And the sultry blast is sighing ; Compos, and printers go you must, Tread softly— go not " on the bust," For the Athenian's dying. Dear friend, you must not die 1 You came to us so readily, You lived, ah ! so unsteadily ; Dear friend, you must not die. 0, type of youth, all ! whv not stay ? You lie so still but do not move ; Your type will moulder to decay ; You had our friendship and our love, And some new " iag " will take 'em away. To live, ah ! why not try ? So recently you came to us, So patiently bore blame from us ; Sweet friend, you shall not die. You never, never more will jest, But still your every quip and joke Is treasured, locked within our breast, Though 'tis, alas ! with grief oppressed, And our heart is well nigh broke. Heart-rending are our moans — Two-thirds, or very near, my friend, Of a column of " brevier," my friend, We give to sobs and groans. How hard he breathes whilst rivals crow To see his muscles growing slack ; The Echo chuckles soft and low, The Evening News doth inly glow, To see him prostrate on his back. Shake hands before you die ; Soon 'twill be vain to seek for you, We'll do our best to speak for you, That is, if you must die. What was your crime, or what your sin ? What, Atheneeum, have you done That thus should end vour brief, brief race? Who standeth there with vacant face, The ghost, the shade of Cameron ? Who waiteth at the door ? We've seen his face before, my friend, The essayist, hooroar ! my friend ; He sulketh at the door.
