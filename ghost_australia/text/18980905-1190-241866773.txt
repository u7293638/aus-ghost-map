THEATRE ROYAL. "A Trip Round the World in Eighty Days" entered upon Its second- week at the Royal on Saturday night, and It con tinues to draw satisfactory houses. The sensational story of Jules Verne abounds In stirring experiences and startling Pit- nations, and there is material ,in it for the playwright to construct many n first-clans drama. In the dramatic adaptation at the Royal, however, eneli net is almost a play in Itself, containing as it does three or four pcenes, one of which Is generally of an exciting na ture. In the first act a climax Is reach ed, with Pussepartout's Impersonation of the dead Pasha's ghost, and the res cue of the Rajah's widow. Then a mystic grotto, with pnakes and other "creepy" things. Is shown, the second act .terminating with an exceedingly pretty floral l>allct. Rod Indians play an Important part In the next act; but for a good piece of stage craft the blow ing up of the Neptune and the raft of human beings, cast away on the high sens, Is, jKirhaps, tho most effective. Mr King Medley's cool pourtrayul of the character of the Eccentric Club member, PhlHes Fogg, was vory acceptable to the audience, and Mr Chits. Maurice, as the Ught-heartcd and sprightly Passepart out, kept the house amused the whole evening, whilst the story Itself was fol lowed with great Interest.
