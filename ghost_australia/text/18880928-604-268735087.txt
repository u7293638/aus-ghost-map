A FIGHT WITH TRHEE ELEPHANTS. Bv H, Rider Haggard. (niolf UAIWA'S HKVEXSE ) Abo at four o’cloak Gobo woke tuo np, and told me that the head m*n of ooa of Wambs’s kcaala bad arrived to aoo me- I ordered him to bo brought np, and presently be came, a little wizened, talkativo .old man, withe •<'nigt-clotb round hid middle, and a greasy, frayed karoes made of the Bkias of rook rabbit a over hia Bhonldera* I told bira to ait down, and then abused him roundly 11 What did he mean,” I asked " by disturbing me in this rude way. How dirt be dare to cause a person- of my quality and evident importance to be awakened in order to iuterview bia entirely contemptible a≪ ?” I spoke thus because X knew toaWt would produce an impression on him. Nobody except a really groat mai*, be would argue, would tiaro to speak to him io that fashion. Moat Ravages are asperate bullies at neon, and look on iosjlanne a* i sign ot power. The old man instantly collapsed. He was utterly overcome, he Raid ; hie heart was -plit in two, and well realised the extent ot hia misbehaviour. bat tne occhbiou wan very urgent, He heard toot a mighty hunter was iu the neighbourhood, nbeautiful white man, how beautiful he could not have imagine:; had he not seen {this to me !) and he caina to b.-ghia asaiataoce. Tbstruth was that three ball olephauts such aa no min ever saw bad tor years been the terror of their kraal which was but a small place—a cattle kraal of the gr-at cnief Wambe’s where they lived io keep the cattle. And now of late these elephants bnd done them much damage; but last night th*y had do*troyed a whole patch of n.KUiin land, *nd ha feared that if they oarao back they would all starve next season tor want «{ food. Would the mighty woite roan then bo ploved to come aud kil’ the elephants? It would be ea«y for him to do —oh, moss easy ! It was only necesaaty th*t ho should hide himself in a tree, for thora w»r a tall mooD, and then when he elephantHjip pearod ho would speak to them with the gun, and they would f-«t| down dead, t»nd there would bo in end ot their troubling, Oifl courts I hummed and hawed, and madn a grpftt favour »t ftonsantiog to this proposal, though really I was doligh»ed to havs-ucQ a cornice. One ot the conditions that I made wns that a messenger should at once bo dcRpatchod to Wnmhe, whose kraal was two days’ jourofy from where I was, telling him that C proposed to come and pay my reopects to him to a few days, and to ask hia formal paraiiftwn to shoot lu hia c umtry, Alao I intimated thut l was prepared to pre sent him with " hongti,” that is, bWcktuail, ■nd that I hoped to do a little trade with him in ivory, of which 1 heard he had a great quantify. This message the old gentleman promised to despatch at once, though them was *ome tbingabout hin manner which showed me that he whs doub fui a* to how it would he re ceived. After thut wo struck our camp and moved on to the hr**!, whioh we reached about an hour before sunset This kraal wrv. a collection of batn fturroundsd by a a'iuht thorn-fenc?, perhaps them were ten of them in all. U was ►ituated iu a kloof of the mountain with a rivu’ent flowing down it. The kloof «a^ densely wooded, hut for pome distance above the kraal it was free from hush, and hero on tha rich deep ground brought dowuky the rivulet wero tho onltU vaud lands, in extent somewhere about twenty or twenty-five acres. On the krail aide of these lands stood a *ingla hut, that nerved for mealie ato*ea whioh an the moment was used as a dweiling*plHoa by an old woman, the liras wile of uur friend tho head I < appears that this old lady, having had some difference of opinion with h°r husband about the extent of authority allowo ltnn younger imd more amiable wife, ha I refused to dwell in the ktaal any more, and by way of marking her displeasure, had taken up her abode umopg tho me-tl"**. As the issue will show, she was, it h*ppsncd, cutting off her nose to • pito her fan'*. C-.qsq by . this hut gr^w a large baobab tree. A glance it the meaHegrounds showed roe that tho old head man had not exaggerated the mischief done by the $V»phviH to hi* crops, whioh wsre not? gutting ripe. Neatly bait of the entire patch was destroyed/ Tb** great biotas had eaten all they coaid, ana the rest they bad trampled dowh. I weo^Uip to their spoor and started back In amfreiaenb —never had I seen euoh epuor before.' It^ra» simply enormouB, more ♦‘Specially thatof‘orfi« old bnl), that bod. m> aaiu the natives, but a single Luek. One might have used aoy of tha foot-prints for a hip*bath. Having taken atomic of tho position, toy next step was to make mrHugemants lor.tbe1 fray. The three bai<a. according to the natives, had been spoored into ttio dhise pitch of buib above the kloof. Nonr jc seemed to me very probable that they would return to-night to* feed on the remainder of the ripening mealiaa* If so, there was a bright moon, and ifetrack me that) by tho exercietdol a little ingenuity 1 might bag one or more of them without, expor ing myself i to any risk, whioh, having tbe highest respect for tho aggressive powers ofonll elephants, was a great consideration tome. • This then wse my plan. To the right ot the hate as you look np Ibo kloof, and ootn~ manding the mealie land* elands the baobab: troe that I have mentioned. Into that baobab, tree I made np my mind to go, Then ’tnft elephant* appeared I should get a shot aa them. I ounoanced my iateotiona to tho head man of the kraal, woo was delighted. •' Now,” he said, “hie people might sleep in peace, for while the mighty white huutet.sa} aloft like a apicit watching over the welfare ox hi" kraal what was there to fast ? , • . I told {him that he was an ungrateful brut* to think of sleeping in peace while I, perched like a wounded vulture on a tree, watched for his welfare in wakeful sorrow; and out*, mot^bacaVUv**dv.a.ad owngdmy worda i '* nliam hat iuit.n ' • ' were ’* sharp but just,’ However, as I nave said, confidence wate completely restored ; and that eveniog every-: body in the krsal, including the superannuated victim of jealoaey in tho little hut where tbe mealie cobs were stored, went to bed with ** eense of sweet security from elephants.and aJ* other animals that prowl by night. For my part, I pitched my camp below the kraal; and then, having procured a beans of wood from the head man—rather a rotter* one, by the way—I Bot it across twp .boughs' that ran out laterally from the baobab trpe. afc a height ni about t,v«nry*five feet from^tn** ground, in uuch faabion that I and another man coaid Bit upon it with onr legs hang ing down, and rest uur backs against the bot* of the tree. This done I went back to fcb* camp nnd had my Boppor. Aboumineo clock* haif-an-honr before the tnoon-riae, I sum moned Gobo, who, thinking that he had ns<» about enongo of the delights of big game hunting for that day, did not altogether relish the job; and.despite bis remonstrance gave him my eight-bore to catry, I having tbe nTO-exproBS. Then we BOt oat for the tree. Ik wan very dark, bat we found it without diffisuley, though climbing i! w»a a more com. plic.ted matter. However, at last we got np and eat down, litre two line boye on o form that is too high for them, and waited, 1 ditr. not dure to atnoRo, because I remembered the^ rhinoceros, and feared thst tho elephant# might wind the tobacco if they should come ray way, and this made the business more*' wearisome, eo I fell to thinking and wondering, at the vastnesa of the silence. ' At last the moon cams np, and with it *, moaning wind, at the breath of which the Bilence began to whsiper mysteriously. Lonely enough in the newborn light looked the wid* expanse of mountain* plain, and forest, more like sorce twilight vision of a dream, Booofr faint reflection from a fair world of 'peace, beyond oar ken, than the mere face of garish earth made ailvery soft with sleep. Indeed, had it not been for the fact) that I w*s beginning to find the log on which I eat V**# , hard, 1 should have grown quite b anti mental over the beautiful sight; but I will defy any* , body to become sentimental when seated in.lba damp, on a very rough beam of wood, half way np a tree. So I merely made a mints* . * note that it was a particularly lovely night, and turned my attention to the prospect ..of ,.... elephants. Bat no elephants came, MM ,, after waiting for another hour or , so, think that wbat betweon weariness ana . dirgaBt, l mast have dropped into a gentle v doze. Preaently I awoke with a rtart. v Gobo. who was perched cloae to me. bnt as fat off aa the beam would allow—for neither white mao nor black like the aroma which each vows is the peculiar and disagreeable property of the other—waa faintly, very faintly, clicking his forefinger against bia ' thnmb I knew by thiB signal, a very favourite one among native buuters .and Kun-beaters, that he roust have seen or. heard iomethlDg. I looked at his face, ana i saw that he wag staring excitedly towards the standing corn? Then came a pause, and then* oat into the open majestically stalked the largest elephant I ever b»w or ever shall see. Heaveup, what a monster be was 1 ant mow themoolfght gleamed upon his one splendid, tosk—for the orher was missing—as be Btood among the mealios gently moving his enor mona aura to and fro, and teullng the wieef with hia trunk. While I was still mar veiling at hia girth, and speculation upon tho weight of that hnge tmk, whioh I sworo should be my task before very long,, out stepped a second baU and stood beeido him. He was not quite so tall, bnt he seemed to rue to be almoat thioker-ae' than the first, und oven in that light I could see .thus both bis tusks were perfect. Another pause and the' third ornerged. He waa . -horter than either of tho others, bnt higher in the Bhoalder than No, 2 ; ana when 1 tell you that, ns I aHcrwarda learnt from actual measurement, tbe araalleRt of these fcbreo mighty bulls measured 12ft. Hia. at the^ ‘houlctor, it will (»ivo yoa some idea of their eiz*. The three formed into line undetoad eutl for a minute, the one-tusked bull gently careRnog tbe elephant on tbe left with his Then they began to feod, walking forward and sliebtfv to' tho right as they gathered great hunches of tbs sweet mealies and thruefc' them into their mouths. All this time they were more than a hundred nnd twenty * varosaway from me (this I knew because I hadp‘ic«dth« distances from tbe tree to ibw* ] various points) much too far to allow .of my * attempting a shoe at them in that uncertain 1 light. They frd in u semicircle .gradually 1 drawing r nnd towards the hut near my tree, ' in which the corn was stored and the old woman slept, This went on for between an hour aodt an hour and a half, tUi what be* tween excitement and hope, that mtkeib the heart sick, I got so weary that I was actually contemplating a depcenk from the fcr»e, and a moonlight stalk, Sacb an sot in ground «n open would have been that of a Htark, staring lunaiio, and that I should even have been contemplating it will show yntt the condition of my mind. Bat • everything comes *o him who knows howto wait, and sometimes, too, 'o him who dnem'fc, ao at la*t those elepbante, or rather one of them, came to roe. After *hey had fed their fill, which war* very Urge one, tbe nobln three stood once more in line Borne seventy yards io tbe left of the hut, and on the edge of the cul tivated lands, or in all about eiphty-fiv» yards from where 1 was perched. Then aS lti*fctho one with »ho single tnpk made a peculiar rattling noise in his trunk just aV though he wore Mowing bis none, and ? without more ado begin to w«Uc deliberately towards the bnt where tho old woman s*epr. I got my tiiia ready and glatjc°d up at tb» moon, only to di*covrr that a new aorap’iw-* tion was looming in the imrapdiata future. I hava said that a wind ro e with tho moon. » Well, the wind brought raio-c’ouds along it» track. Seve*al light ones had already for a. little while leespnedthe light, though withonft obscuring It, and now two more were coming * rapidly «p, both of them very blank and dense. The first cloud was small and long, and the . o"e tmhmn big and broad. I remember noticing that the psir of them bore a most cimicnl resemblanoe to a dray drawn : by a very love raw-boned horse. As look would have it, just as the elephant got wbbin twehty-Hv> yards or so of me, the head of ib*. home-cloud flouted over tbe face ot the moon, rendering it irapmndble fur tneto fi e. In tbV faint t*vilght which remained, however,.I < could just make mit the grey mass of th* crpat brute Btill advancing towards the hat, 1 Th*n tho light went altcgniher »nd I had i« truatto ray ears. I heard him fumbling with hia trunk, aopareniy »t tho roof of the hut * n-xs came a sound as of straw being drawn out. and then tor a little wb.le there was. ooraple^o iflenoe. 1 The cloud began fo p*s»; t oonl i s^e tin* . catline of the elophanr-; he wa* standing with bia head titht over tho top of the hat.

Tho Rimin' path which wo had boon following all da? ran straight on in the diction from which the elephant bad tramped. It was narrow, bat well Irodden, aod th* light struck down upon it in o straight white lino. I crept along it oaatiouily for Home two hundred yards, wbon it sudden ly opened \iito a moat beautiful glad* soma two hundred yarda or more in width, wherein tall grins grew, and flat-topped treori Btood singly.

The firs* course, by far the wineat and coarse. To en gage one elephant by rao might and siugie* baodod ia a suffioieutly rash proceeding ; to tackle three little short of Innaoy. But, oo the other hand, I knew that they woald be on the tniirah again before daylight, and fcbe e might come another day of weaiy trudging before 1 conld c-*oh them up, or they might eac-ipe mo Altogether. 9 “No/ I thouwbt ro myolf, “f aint hear never won fair tuak.

So I did the only thing that I could do—raieed th rills and fired at the black i»«r> of hie cheat.
