■THE MITTAGQSTG DRAMATIC- PER MMUffGE. TO THE EDITOR OF TH33 BOWRATi FKKE PPJ3SS. 'Sir,—The account given in your last issue of the above performance, from-tile pen of " Italia," is de serving of: your particular attention, as containing an unusual amount of nonsense and misrepresenta tion. " Italia" commences his account in a ridicu lous, bombastic, poetic manner, and tells us lie con siders it I113 " duty to do so." Next, he looks upon our society as a " coruscation of sporting element." A few rambling sentences now inform the public lib at he went to a barber's and got shaved, find then put.his leading harness, on—items of intense inter terest. After a few sentences on nothing, he describes the interior of the concert hall as having the appear ance of "human heads packed in the fashion of pumpkins on a barn floor"—quite a refined simile., Further on, ho criticises a pair of statuettes repre senting mythological personages, which were pasted on the walls, and freely exposes his ignorance of mythology. " Italia " now describes the vocal enter tainment, and as a specimen of his accuracy, take the following—A duet, " Bold Gendarmes," by Messrs.Cobbett and Viles, is spoken of as a " gem," • ••whereas it was a.miserable failure. In speaking of the farce, he says the " rendering of Cabman No,. 93 was the best personification of Mr. Samuel Weller he had ever seen." How on earth could the render ing of the " cabman " be a personification of Pick ■ wick's "valet?" In speaking of Mr. Souther's speech, "Italia" says that it was " rich, with spark ling epigrams and happy similes "—whilst, in, fact, • not the ghost of an^epigram, rior a single simile,;-oc ' curred in the speech. I hope "'Italia" will bear me 110 illwill for forcibly reminding him that the general . public know the difference between sense and nou sense and if this letter has the effect of making him more careful with his pen, I shall be satisfied. , 1 Yours, &g.;, MORAL.
