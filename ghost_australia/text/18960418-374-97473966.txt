However, they passed on without molesting the unhappy Hassan, whom they left feeling himself sdl oypr for broken bones, and cursing^^Tcbvayne ior finding him out and himself'forfeiting found out. Yussuf, -who had witnessed the incident with twitehing fingera and a curious half closing of the *eyfes,' turned to Trevayne and said, solemnly . It is the will of God. The liio^iDulce^has dealt mercifully with his "OhP' replied Trevayne. when he hiad i^co^^ hiff iireath. " You think so, do you 1 I'm not quite bo pure about it myself. However——" But Yussuf was persistent. Ia his colorless, .monotonous voice he continued interau^tiugTrevayne:— " It Vas" well for 'him that the Lord Sake chastised him, and did-not hand him oy^r.to his tribe for the fitting reward of his pin." " I suppose so,31" drily remarked Tre vayne. "No doubt they would have substantially .rewarded him for being sipajGt' enough to steal from -his own countryman. Though, on the other hand, they might have punished him for the disgrace.of being detected—and by an iu fidel^ioo." t But the sarcasm was lost on Yussuf, who replied, reflectively :— • Yesj-when Allah wills it, they open tlie tbieEe .hands and slash a knife across^ them, so—" and Yussuf ran the fore finger. of his right hand diagonally across the .palm of his left hand ; 1 and- then rub saltpetre into .the wounds, and. shut up the thief's hands and bind |hem , ,&nd; he can never open- them to steal again. And sometimes they hold a red hot iron to the eyes of the thief until they are gone, and the thief never again sees anything to steal. God is great,' concluded Yussuf, piously shaking his head., . V ' Fiends !' ejaculated Trevayne, with a gesticulation of horror. : * And those poor blind wretch esl have-seen wandering through ^he streets aye thieres then, eh 9 Have been, I should say,' he added. At last the camels' loads, after almost innumerable futile attempts, -were satis factorily arratiged, and everything was ready^ As usual - a short preliminary march was undertaken to test the mettle of .the camels, and then tiie caravan fairly ' started on its tremendous journey. " Soon the Holy City faded away in the distance; first the rambling,,ghost- like houses, thenthe minarets, tall and stern7 as if standing guard over their .more lowly brethren; and then the drooping palm trees with their graceful outlines projected in jet black against the blue brightness ofvthe sky, lingering on ttie horizon as if bidding a laBt reluctant good-. bye to the venturous travellers. Then on over the unending, wave-like. I dunes the vast procession ranged, until, the sand becoming interspersed with -sharp,' flinty stones, the caravan was halted in order that the camels' feet might be bound round and round with rags, making them look like huge boxing gloves. Then the night fell, outposts were stationed half a mile or so distant, and the caravan was formed into a sort of laager, but with the camels taking the place of the waggons and various im pedimenta"usually placed on the outside of the -square. Inside, big fires were kept blazing all the night through, for in the desert the nights are icy cold, harder to be borne by reason of the burning heat of the day. Trevayne, wrapped up in his burnouse—for he had assumed the Arab costume—lay at a short distance from one of the fires, while not far from liim lay Yussuf, asleep and snoring. .: The novelty and excitement of it all had kept Trevayne partially awake, and for a long time there danced grotesquely through his brain confused visions of fierce-faced Arabs, shambling camels, stretches of sand dazzling with the glare of a pitiless sun, rocks of fantastic shapes .that stood menacingly by the way. At last, just as he was dozing off, he thought he heard a slight crackling—a sound as of someone creeping towards him through the sand. Baising himself on his arm, he peered around him. For a moment he could see nothing, -and theHT by *th% light of the fire, he saw a man crawling away on his hands and knees. When the intruder reached a spot .where he thought he could not be seen, he turned his head. But Trevayne's sight was very keen, and he saw with a feeling of astonishment, and something like dismay, that a knife gleamed between the teeth, and that the face was the face of Hassan, the dis missed guide! The object of the noc turnal visit was only too plain. Murder was writ large on the features of the treacherous villain. Revenge was doubt less the motive. But how did the cur ocme there 1 Trevayne puzzled over the problem for hour after hour, until the velvety dark ness grew into an austere grey.. Then, long before the sun was up, he was again startled, this time by a shout. Rising to his feet, he saw two or three Arabs run ning round and awaking the sleepers by the simple but effective method of striking the ma stinging blow with a long cane. jVussuf soon became to rouse Trevayne in'a more civilised manner, but finding him , already awake, shot a rapid glance around to insure that ho listeners were oear, and then began in a low, agi tated soice:— \- 1 It was not well that the Lord Duke, not being of the true faith, himself %>un ished the thieving Hassan. I, Yussuf, hate seen Hassan in the caravan, and haye- heard from'the lips of one who' speaks the truth that the chief of the caravan is of the same tribe. God Is ^reat/blat a fear has spriing :iip in .the heartftfihy slave, even as a palm tree throwing a great shadow, for the dog Hassan is .cunning, and seeks the life of the Lord Duke.' - ' ^Trevayne reflected a moment, and then told .Yussuf of the attempt that had al ready-.been made. Yussuf heard the tale in; silence, bat the working of his face showed how deeply he was stirred. For the next three days both Trevayne anil Yussuf kept a sharp watch on Hassan, ■ but that worthy always managed to be id: the rear of the caravan, whereas they wdre generally in the van, and conse quently saw next to' nothing of him. On the fourth day, when the sun was at. its: fiercests and the heat was so oppressive 'th^t,Trevayne had to gasp for the breath ihat'see'med to scorch his very lungs, the half-dozen Arabs forming the advance guard were Been to suddenly converge to a point, and, i after a brief consulation, turn their ^camels' heads and ride towards the caravan. Evidently something had bep sighted, and that something might i be -the expected caravan, or It might. jib , the dreaded Toharegs—those merciless , pirates of the desert. J In an instant all was animation. The heat was forgotten. The camels were halted and the square formed as at night, while the motley collection of Weapons with which the party were armed, com prising almost all kinds of firearms,' from old flint-leek muskets to the latest Win chesters, wens eagerly examined and node ready for use! v When these preparations. were com- ' plete,'and the outposts hadbeen received* into the square* a. swirl, of dust copld J&j; plainly seen advancing rjght, 4QWn. $n to the caravan. * "Then the *■ cloud of-: dust stopped and settled, and - there' rodeout'; from it half-a-dozen Arabs, who soon made it known that they were friends, and that their party, in fact, formed the looked-for caravan. In a very short time the members of thetwo caravahs 'were ejaculating praiseB to theTtophet, and fraternizing inamost effusive manner. Trevayne was much struck by the gaunt, worn look of the new- comers. They had been away from home for two whoje years;, and. their ap pearance showed that they had experi enced the severest privations. The feast ing, for which the most trifling occurrence is deemed by the Arab to be sufficient excuse, took plaue with much ceremony, though the viands were neither very numerous nor veiy rich. Ear into the night the festivities ex tended, for the returniug caravan would, pass on its way on the morrow, the Arabs composing it being naturally anxious, now they were so near home, to lose as little time as possible. Everyone was stirring veiy early the next morning, and preparations for the, departure of , the. two caravans" ion their, opposite courses were pushed forward with all -speed. Tussuf had gone some some little^ distance off to, look after the bbSgB-gP, wireji Trevayne b&w; Hassan walk up, and after casting a malicious glance at him," go a. few steps further on and say something in a hurried manner to the chief of the caravan, who was standing close by, and who at once turned and gazed at Trevayne with a deep frown on his dark, scarred face. Then, before Trvayne could realize what was happening, Hassan ^ stepped up, and thrusting his band into the folds of .Trevayne's haik, pretended to draw forth a small dagger. It was the veriest trick, most clumsily performed. What the performance meant was a puzzle to Trevayne, who, however,; was filled with wrath at the inBult, and was about to avenge it in true English fashion, when ; he heard the chief shout a short, sharp command to his followers. The next -moment, to Trevayne's utter amazement, i he found himself surrounded by scowling Arabs, who, before he could defend him ■self in any way, pounced .upon- him, tied his hands behind him, and pushed him to wheretheehief was standing. Now, how- j ever, the meaning of Hassan's insulting trick was apparent to Trevayne. No doubt the lyipg hound had professed to! have discovered a plot to murder the chief, for whos^ benefit the dag ger farce had. evidently been enacted. . . But he was wrong. Hassan's design was a far deeper oqu than he had con ceived. Nor. had he long to wait before making the discovery, for Tussuf, hearing the hubbab, rushed to the spot. In a minute he had grasped the situation. Wringing his haucjs he grovelled at the feet of the chief and addressed him intones of piteous entreaty. Trevayne glanced at the impassive Arab chief; at the implor ing Tussuf; at his caporst, armed to the teeth ; at the motley crowd, attracted by the commotion; and the knowledge he, the central figure, knew least about it all caused his impatience to break all bounds.. In a loud voice he called Yussuf who rose from the sand, and slowly cBme towards his master. Their was a look of despair in Yussuf's eyes as he cried :— • ' ■' God is great, but the Evil One is in our midst to work mischief. The dog of a thief has told the chief that thou—even thou, Lord Duke—hast stolen his dagger, and he asks that thou mayst be punished as one of the true faith.' Then the full horror of his situation flashed upon Trevayne. ' Surely,' he cried as his face paled— 4 surely they won't cut my hands or bum out my eyes !' Then, in a frenzy of fear, he shouted: 4 Tell the chief that it was only a trick—tell him why that fiend-did it—that he tried to murder - me the other night.'; Yussuf trembled. •Jtiar# JQwke,' he said, sorrowfully,' I have done even as thou hast said, and more also,' but the chief will not listen. He says that his eyes cannot lie.' 'Tell him,1 cried Trevayne, in despera tion, ' that if I am harmed, my people will come and kill him and his tribe.' Yussuf translated the threat to the chief, who calmly replied :— \- ' Kismet. It may come to pass even as the infidel sayeth. But it will go hard with those that Beek me and my tribe in the desert. It is written that justice must be done to the oppressed, and who am I that I should* disobey ? Let the infidel suffer the' penalty of his crime." The chief made a sign with his hand, and then went into his tent. Justice is summarily dispensed in the desert. The sentence had been pro nounced, and would be carried into effect on the spot. Trevayne was dragged for ward. Three or four Arabs held him fast, while a couple more unbound his arms sufficiently to enable them to pull his hands over a bale of merchandise. One had brought a bowl of saltpetre, and another drew his kinfe ready to inflict the wounds which would Allah he praised, effectually prevent the dog of an infidel j from ever again robbing a true believer. 1 Trevayne had not tamely submitted to j all this. Death he would have faced without turning a hair—but to be horribly i maimed for life was far .worse than death. :j And now a brazier of charcoal was i brought, and Trevayne noticed with a ; thrill of terror that a small iron was ' sticking through the bars .and .was already nearly red-hot. Despite.allTiis efforts to 1 .control .himself, the agony of. his- .fear i overcame him, and he struggled a i madman. It was useless. His hands were forced open and the knife was actually uplifted, when, suddenly, the j chief- reappeared, shouted a brief com mand, and strode back to his tent; To Trevane's inexpressible joy and bewilder- j ment, the knife was slipped into its' sheath and he'was " released from his 1 bonds ! Without another word, he was harried along to the homeward-bound caravan, whichtwas already on the move, : and almost before he could realize his good fortune, he was on the way to Fez. i s Not until the caravan reached the Holy j •City did Trevayne become aware that j Yussuf had not returned with him." After some deliberation on the subject, he came to the conclusion that the guide had been induced to throw in his lot with the out ward bound caravan. As to his own adventure, Trevayne decided that .the" Arabs had never intended to do anything ~ "more than frighten him. ' Notwithstanding his previous lengthy ,stop in Fez, Trevayne found sufficient to interest him in the region to the south of the town to keep him in the neighborhood for nearly three, weeks after his return. - At length, however, he made up his mind : to start for England. On the morning of his intended de parture, as he was finishing his breakfast at the hotel, he heard someone stumble into the parage leading to his room. He hjeard the intruder grope about outside, fluid ^ then' the' door was pushed open. A native advanced into the room with a Jeeble, 'unsteady step. His head drooped forward, his chin npon his chest. Trevayne gazed curiously at his visitor, but in a moment his curiosity was replaced by pity, for. he saw that there were black cavities where the man's eyes had been. He had. evidently suffered the Arabs' diabolical punishment for theft. Trevayne's heart was touched. " Concluding that the man. was a beggar,, he put his .hand m his-1 jiooket for some money to give him, Bay | ing, impulsively, "Mypoor fellow-—" ■ | i But as the native approached, he! I stretched forth his hands imploringly, ana j j Trevayne saw with a sickemng feeling of > horror that they were red and inflamed, j and tightly closed. Blind and maimed ; for life 1 The remembrance of how nar rowly and how inexplicably he had escaped the same terrible fate' unmanned him. He was aroused by: hearing a weak, quavering voice murmur, in heart-break ing accents of despair:— *' They have burnt but mine eyea,and never again shall I see thy . face ; and they have closed my hands, and never again shall I open them—-and tiw\L, Lord Duke, thou, knowest that l stole not the dagger !" " Good God !" cried Trevayne. " Yus suf! ■ofo arxt ^Magazine.
