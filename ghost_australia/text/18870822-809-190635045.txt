MINING NOTES. VBOM OUE OWN cobbespondenis.1 BALLARAT. Of- tbe alluviata all the Berry lino is strong, a Madame Ko. 2 is now in tho wash, which pro- miseg fairly, and the Btock has sold from £12 15s. to £13 15s. — a price, as roadera of these letters know, is, in my opinion, rather tall, as it represents more than four years' purchase at the present dividend rate. Consols, with the water hardly changed, have risen from sales at 147s. to 154s., 151s. ; Extended sold at 20s. Gd. , 20s. OA j Ko. 1 at 48s. GA . 49s. 6A ; and Central Leads next door in advance from 9s. 3d. to 10s. 3d., 10s. , all reasonably sound rates, no doubt; rates that might have been likely, even apart from tbe present scrip-rush agony. Beacons- field and Harry liavo felt the general glow, for thero is not much mine changa to note, though the water is easier. The former sold from 73s. 6d. to 81s., 80s. ; and the latter from 70s. 6d. to 75s., 73s. Tbo Hepburn scries has also been strong. Rocky, with one middling wash again and expectations of a better one next time, had business from 15s. 3A to 20s.; Estate from 80s. to 90s. to 85s.; Junction, 7s. 63. to 9s., 8s. 9d.; Lady, 16a 3A to 18s. 3A; Lord, Is. 4d., la 5A, Is. 4d.; Ko. 1, 2s. 7A; Ullina, 2b., 2s. 4A to Is. 8d. Estato, whose output is kept pretty steady, has the following report " South-east intermediate extended 56 feots Have started a drive off this one to go south, west towards Ko. 7 bore. This drive ia in 51 feet. South intermediate extended 43 feet ; total from Ko. 3 rise, 138 feet 6 inches. All the washdirt faces going on without change. Tho diamond drill went through the rock as 289 feet, then through 60 feot of olay, the lass 4 feet being black clay ; present depth of bore, 361 feet in coarse gravel, which has cut tha lot away very much, bo much so that tha foreman has to send to Melbourne for a new bit. Yield of gold for tha week, 121' oz. 12 dwt Have purchased the land leased from tho Smeatou trustees, 648 acres." Tbe Australasian line has not been much aifooted, and is in shadow again. The parent stock was only quoted at the opening of the week, and the only salos up to Friday night wore Eaglohawk, 8s. lOd. to 9s. 2A ; Davies's, 7s. 7A; Charleson's, 3s. 11 A, 4s,; West Lough lin, 23s. 6d. to 25s., 24s. There has been a ' little xnoro attention to some of tbe stocks fur ther north and west on Moorookyle, which sold almost daily, realising 2b. 9A to 3b. 2d., 3s.; Bmeaton Reserve, daily business from lis. 3d. to 15s. to 14s. 3d. Tho Midas and D. F. groups cannot get ahead, tbo latter is out of the markot, and of the former the only business recorded was in Extended, 2s. 8A; King, 2s. to 2s. 6A, 2a 5d.; Ka 1 at la 2A to la lid. The gold ia not yet found which is to make that field a name in history, and even the new crack niluvials are, for the most part, only about to begin to tell us what is iu them ; whilst the aggregate output is but tbo ghost of the better i'mes, and the quartz beats it regularly, chough without much to boast of yet. There is much matter in what ono of the Corner brokers said to me a day or two ago as he pointed to tho blackboard where Pobjoy posts the yields on Saturdays ; — " I want to sea the numbers up there as thoy used to be when wo had three or four times ss much gold without alt this excitement, and these new things flooding tbs market." Itie tho quartz discoveries in Bal larat East and tbe fairly good prospects in that way on the Sebostopol plateau belt ot lodes that give somo basis of solid fact for fresh en terprise, and, though tho rush of prospectuses on tho eastern lodes is overdone, there is reason able prospect of lasting success along the whole lino of lcmea Tbe finds in .the Bnlieman, Britannia United. Llanberris, Korth Woah Hawp and Prince Regent are among tbe mors encouraging things that go to justify confi dence in the future, and in some sort therefor to' warrant new energy now. There has been good businessdoing in stooks.in the Eaat Sulie man sold daily, with rates from 50s. to 60a by tbe elose on Friday, and an easing on Satur day to 56s., wbicb is quite high enough at pre sent Britannia Uaited sold from 8s. 4A to 9 6A, 9a; Last Chance, 5a 4 A to 8s! 6A; Llan berris, £10 to £13 5a for the full stock, aud'a, £7 15a, and Llanberris West quitted at 8a. OA; fnnco Regent sold 9a 3A to 10a 3d., 10s.| South P.K., 4a 6d., 4a 9A; Kormanby,3a lid. to 4a lOd. Back on tho line Sulieman Consols sold almost daily, 3s. 1 fl 5a 3d. to 4a lid., being the rang up to the close on Friday, in the other new things nothing of moment was done. On the Sebastopol Plateau mine developments hav nothing new of importance. Tbe progressive stocks have had only moderate attention, and the wholo outlook thero is awaiting on Pro vidence and State aid, for the yields from both Band and Star are low just now, and the drainage question is still in the air. Loch bad been in good odor, na tbe lode will be soon opening up, and the stock had business from 7a to 10a 6A tbs week befoto last, and rising last week with soles at 13a 6A, but dropping to 8a 6A, and back to 7a by the cloee on Fri day with no mine change to warrant th oscillationa Barton sold from 5a 3A to 4a 10A, 4a 11A; Rising Star at Gld. to 8A; Princ and Bonshaw, 5a 3A; Plateau, 9a 6A; Cen tral, 3a 64; South Star, lla to 10a, 10a 3A Star of the East had no business np to the close oi Friday, and eased to buyers 55a The yield is very low, and will bo till better stone is opened, to tbe north probably ; but there is faith in tbe stock, and on good ground, I think. Band Albion returns are also low, but a week or.ten days should see the pioks in good stone to th south in Ka 14 level, and alter the look of things. Sales were made at 67a to' 65a 6A on Thursday and Fridf The manager reports : — " Yield for the week from 338 tonB stone, 166 ; oz. 18 dwt 12 gr. bar golA Ko.7 shaft : Shaft j sunk 11 feet ; total >elow Ka 15 level, 14 feet ; , will have well cmpleted, and start to cat' chamber by Hot 4sy.

Bor- \- ring a salo of Estate at 4s. 6d. no It on in - yong stocks had tiusiness, and there are no reports of discoveries to draw attention in that direction, Egerton and Black Horso do not move much, thu former not at all, in fact, for tho look of things below docs not invito investment just now, and somo of tho judges say tho shaft must go deeper yet beioro a good break of stone is likely to ho reached, that is. below tho cross course. Black Horse had business almost daily, 20s. to 21s. 6d. being the range. Both companies aro nearly out of debt, and if tho Black Horso stono keeps osit is thero will bo a show for dividends again and bettor prices, the moro so as a lower level is to be opened before long, when, according to the mi, in inonacer's ronort. thero will 1)8 8 to 10 Tearsof work opened up. Parker's United is still enjoying the luck of tho haymakingst-ason, and Had daily business, 4a 3d. to 5s. to 4a 10d. being tho courso of exchanges. A fair amo.nnt of business was done at tho Corner to-day. Sulioman Pasha had opening sales at 58a 6 but eased to 52a 6d. Several other stocks were a little weaker.

A very extensive business h&s; been trans- ftctod here during the week, and to all appear- anco there is every probability of a permanent revival in tho share market for6oma time to come. The two Lazarus stocks have com manded most attention, both showing a steady rise; Lazarus Company sold from 6s. 8d. to 8s. 9d. , and Lazarus No. 1 from 8s. to 10a. 4Jd., but in Bpite of the magnificent yield from the latter shares closed slightly weak; Great Extended Hustler's Company also has a splen did yiold from the deep IotcIb, and shares advanced from 49s. to 58s. 6d.

Tho Sbakspearo Com pany, at Mount Franklin, after 11 months' hard struggling appear to havo como upon payablo wash, i dwt. of gold having been obtained from a dish of dirt. At the Forest Creek, Wattle Gully, mine they havo got tho water below' tbo 712 feet level. Tbo manager went in and examined it on Friday last, when ho found the timber cruiihed together at 110 feet from tno ena, ana wnero mey noa passea through Boft flucan ground ; a little dirt has fallen down boro and there, but nothing of con sequence. Three shifts of men have boon put on to clear out and eecuro tbo levol. The tributers at North and Buttman's shaft aro sinking a winzo on a reef 15 inches wido, and will tako out a small trial crushing during the fortnight. Tbo company aro putting on men at the Welcome shaft to resumo work there. The Moonlight Flat Stoam Fuddling Company had 9 oa 7 dwt. 2 gr. of gold tbiB week, and paid their monthly dividend of £1.

The North Cornish Company had a magnifi cent fortnightly yield to-day, being no less than 411 oz of gold from 800 tons of stone ; thirty- nine tons of pyrites were also treated for a return of 203 oz of gold, making a total of 614 oz for the fortnight At the No. 5 feet level the drive is in 266 feet : reef 8 feet wide, show ing payable gold throughout. The rise at the same level is up 60 feet through a large body of payable stone. At tho No. 3 level the crosscut is in 325 feet in slate country. The Rising Star Company cleaned upon Satur day. a crushing of 390 tons from 10 various points, yielding 57 oz 4 dwt. of smelted gold, and from tributers, 200 tons, yielding 25 oz 43 dwt of gold, or a total of 82 oz, 17 dwt from 590 tons. During the past fortnight, the north drive, western level, has been extended 32 feet ; total, 332 feet ; the lode is about 3 feet wide, well formed and carrying a little fine gold. The crosscut east. south drive, is in 33 feet, country tough slate. The drive on footwall lode south is in 20 feet from junction of the two walls ; lode about 4 feet thick, showing a little gold. The Cornish Company to-day had a yield of 107 oz of gold from 300 tons, which with 40 oz from 11 tons of pyrites, makes a total of 147 oz for the fortnight. At the main shaft, the crosscut at the 862 feet level has been extended 35 feet ; total from plat, 44 feet ; ground hard slate, with quartz leaders, heavily charged with minerals and making a little water. The shaft has been sunk 2 feet ; total from plat, 11 feet ; ground, sandstone and quartz, in which some nice gold has been seen and making more water. At the old shaft, the stopes have been continued in the usual manner and show considerable improvement; The boiler at the battery has been connected to-day. The No. 1 North Cornish Company's shaft is now down to a depth of 520 feet, in softer country, promising looking leaders, showing good prospects, being occasionally come across in sinking. The Leech's Creek Company's shaft is now down 97 feet in rock boulders, and may expect to break through in another 11 feet. The water is increasing. MALMSBURY. The improved yield last week at our prin cipal mines, the Qaeen's Birthday and O'Con nor's, has given a wonderful stimulus to this district, the fact being moro apparent that the more the same is prospected the more its , auriferous nature is developed. The Queen's Birthday heads the list this week with 157 oa 10 dwt. of amalgam, the O'Connor's following with 100 oa amalgam. At the former mine the most gratifying feature Is that the auri ferous character of the stoue is improving at tho 500 feet level, while at a still greater depth in tho main shaft a very rich run of stone has been gone through. Ae tho latter mine the work has beeu delayed, owing to repairs to machinery. The various drives and stopes in the mine are, however, reported as showing well. At tho No. 1 Bouth it would now appear that a cnange ior 100 oew nas ac isngm sot in. AC the 400 feet and 455 foet levol rune of most ex- tftallsnt gtnnn hftVA tuwin cnmA unnn. mnoh of which, it is estimated, must yield from 2 oa to 3 oa to the ton. Crushing will be commenced on Monday, and it is hoped tho shareholders will bo rewarded with a fine cake of gold at the end of tbe fortnight At the North O'Connors tho water is being baled out, so as to get down to tho 150 feet level, it having been proved beyond a doubt that the upper level is too shallow to get tho Freehold reef. Work has been greatly retarded here for want of timber, & supply of which has only arrived within tho past few days, At tho Extendod Queen's Birthday a trial crushing of from 15 to 20 tons of stone will be at grass in a few days when tho samo will bo crushed by tho battery. It U now thought that an excellent and rich run of stone is in this olaim, tbe proof of which will now be speedily ascertained by this company. Tho Fnnce of Wales and New Golden Gate — alluvial mines — still meet with varying success ; yield from the former for week, 13 oa 10 dwt. ; from tbo latter, 13 oa 16 dwt., while tho Homo Rule Co-operative party have obtained 8 oa 13 dwt 12 gr. for the fortnight, an Improvement on recent returns, and from appearanoes tbe olaim will improve and reach iu former average yields of from 12 to 15 oa In our local exchange a large business has been done in the above stocks during the week, and largo parcels haTe been dealt in by wire from all the principal mining centres. MARYBOROUGH. Tho share market on Saturday was quiet in the forenoon, but revived iu the afiernoon, especially with regard to tbe Hayelock reefing stocks. In' M'Farlane's Reef, M'Farlano's and No. I North, Shaw's Na 1, there were very large transactions at prices quoted. Shaw's Na 1 also had better request than usual and a good many lines changed bands. For Working Minora' there vers ,cood inquiries at advanced rates. But holdoTS were very firm. GoorJay's Keof and Now North Home- bush furnished several transactions. Kong No. 1 and Kong No. 2 were easier, as also wore Chalk's Freehold', though tho other stock of tbo Chalk's group maintained their position in tho market.
