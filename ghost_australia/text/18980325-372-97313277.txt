Sing! for ths pride of the English ia broken : Their batsmen, their bowiars, all dasky oud brave — How vain was iheir boasting!— Ciem Hill, by token, Hath put sdi iheir records in shade! Sound the i)ti! timbrel o'er Australia's bright sea; Aastrrtlin h*s tsiutnphed ; eho has won victory ! Praise to the conquerors ! praise to them all! Their batting was splendid, their bowling 'ircns no u?e to stonewall ! How will her men return to tell England the story, Of those ibe sent forth in the hour of her pride ? For ' our boys' have played well, and re flected glory Hath d.ished the Englishmen down in the tide. Sound tbo loud timbrel o'er Australia's bright sea ! Australia has triumphed ; she has won victorj.
