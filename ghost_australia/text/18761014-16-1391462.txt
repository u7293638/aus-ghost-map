The fame of our latest discovered northern goldfield has -aroused the attention of our southern neighbor pretty fully The state of the goldmining industry in Victoria at the present time is be no means is pro- pious as of old and shows no indications of a 113 permanent recovery, and consequently capitalists in the colony have been restricting their ventures, and find then money commence to secure late v without any serious aging outlet for investment appearing This had been going on for some time when the Palmer rush broke out, and it is prob ible that southern speculators would have given more attention than actually was the case to that field had it not been that the ni significance of its alluvial workings threw for a time the resources of its reefs so completely into the shade that it is doubtful whether any general know- ledge was spread abroad that it was a great reefing district at all Probably the mayors) of people at a distance, not actually taking Queens had your this as a means of keeping posted in our affairs, novel heads the Palmer men tional, except is the annual field to the capitalist shallow alluvial has no at tractions As 1 regards the Hodgkinson, the cast was entirely]) different Its utter failure as an alluvial field was sensation in enough to form an item of news in all colonial journals, and it so happened that the announcement of that if there was now held) accomp lined by assertions equally strong; of the extaordinary) resources of the field as leg 11 dod the extent and richness of its reefs It was therefore is a probable field for reefing enterprise that the Hodgkinson first assumed stable form on emerging from the emin ) otic condition of a mere nish Successive accumulations of information have, as it fortunately) happened, never v aged From one authority) after another the same story) has reached the public, and the story has been that, con- fident and exciting as were the first duel 11 sons of Mr Mulligan and his associates that the Hodgkinson, although nothing as regarded Alluvial, would prove the lai_,cstandi idlest goldfields the north, they were not one lot beyond the actual facts There is every reason to believe that the result, soon to be appy lent, will be such an influx, of the accumulated capital of southern millers and speculators as Qucuishnd Ins never before experienced One event alone would not suffice to create what we in) tend a moneyed nish 'Lho discover) of the Hodgkinson as 11 soils vi) goldfield in Northern Queensland, with equal assist ances of its richness and extent, would probably have failed to move a single capitalist, but it must be borne in mind that a gradual proportion of the minds of the people want his for 11 long time been in progress The older goldfields in the north support the) men who have connection with the mining population of the southern colony. On these northern fields coní dence has been steadily growing, until, from mere mayor's, they have assumed the importance of established certainties which may be placed on the same level as regards permanence with Ballarat or Sandhurst, and at the same time as fresh, unexhausted, and not in any degree equally overdone. Before the contagion of confidence can be communicated to persons at a distance, it is a necessity that it shall have deeply established itself at the place of its origin. This is an affair which takes time. On Charters Towers and other of our northern fields the miners themselves had to learn the peculiarities of the mode in which the gold occurred before they themselves can, be in a position to feel any assurance respecting the permanency of the field. When this was accomplished they had still only verbal guarantees to offer to enquirers for a time. But by degrees they have been exhibiting practical and conclusive proofs of the genuineness of their convictions. Local men have been in- vesting moneys locally gained in expensive plant and appliances. Their purchase of these has been the most conclusive possible testimony of the bona fides of their declarations respecting their faith in the fields. Such evidence has been steadily accumulating until the idea of investment in Queensland reefs could no longer be regarded even in the venerable fields of the south as a wild and rash conception, suitable only for very venturesome or very shifty men. It has come to be recognised that while the confidence of local men must be the best evidence as to the value of these localities, the evidence of that confidence existing had become incontrovertible, and investment in the far north of the continent commences to be regarded as a sound speculative undertaking, holding forth, all things considered, at least equal promise of advantage to those offered by old established fields of which the eyes had long ago been picked out. The discovery of the Hodgkinson and the diffusion of the fame of its promise as a field for reefing enterprise, happened just about the time when these facts were become fairly recognised among the wealthy centres of mining investment in Victoria, and also, as it happened, just when profitable and safe investments there became daily more difficult to secure. The Hodgkinson, in fact, is likely to reap a good deal that earlier goldfields in the north have sown, and there is justification for believing that its progress will be accelerated by the application of capital from the south in a degree not hitherto experienced by any of its predecessors. UPON one occasion, after Sir Robert Walpole's retirement from office, Horace, thinking to beguile his father's tedium, offered to read some historical work to him. " Anything but that," was the states- man's reply, " for history must be false." One has only to read some of the newspapers published on the Continent of Europe in order to feel assured that the Prime Minister of George the First and Second was speaking by the card. The daily journal should be the daily diary of the time ; the record of everything worth recording that happened during the previous four-and-twenty hours; but if the future Schlosser, who should attempt to write thohistoryof the nineteenth century, should happen to get hold of a file of the Roman II Dirltto, and should imagine that he had discovered in it a secret and authentic history of the events which occurred in Constantinople a few weeks ago, he will be apt to mislead posterity very considerably. The paper referred to is the acknowledged organ of the Depress Ministry. The head of the Government in Italy is understood to be part proprietor of it and this gives it an importance which it would not otherwise possess. Its conductors are suffering from Anglophobia in its most acute form. Just as, in the time of the first Napoleon, the French newspapers declared that Pitt and " Coburg" were at the bottom of all the calamities of Europe, and that British gold was omnipresent and omnipotent, so the Diritto declares that England is the factor of evils innumerable all over the Continent, and must be held responsible for the suicide or assassination of poor Abdul Aziz, who, as Vanity Fair says, is now Abdul As-was. The Ministerial journal in Home honors with its largest type a letter from Berlin, written by a correspondent who evidently knows all about it. Not only were the scissors which were employed by the late Sultan in opening his veins manufactured in Sheffield, but the hands which punctured the veins of that worn-out debauchee were manipulated from Downing-street ! Perfidious Albion was the author of the mischief. The Berlin letter writer, without ex- plicitly saying so, leads his Italian readers to infer that he is the bosom friend of the Crown Princess of Prussia, and that as soon as that distinguished lady has received a batch of letters from Balmoral or from Buckingham Palace, he is sent for to Pots- dam, or elsewhere, and is made the recipient of the contents of the whole of the correspondence. He says :-" I have heard, and 1 relate the thing faithfully to you, that Queen Victoria was at first opposed to the policy which her Ministers intended to pursue at Constantinople, and which they had long before prepared without her knowledge, but at last consented that the mine so long prepared should be sprung. Her repugnance, dictated by the upright sentiments of the woman, had yielded before the necessities of State. The revolution was decided on, and the necessary orders were given. But at the first announcement of the Turks di revolution in England the bloody memories of the seraglio were evoked and in the uncertainty that reigned respecting the fate of the de- throned sovereign, it was supposed that the traditions of Ottoman history would be preserved, and the ex-Sultan slain. The Queen, whose disposition is mild, religious, and somewhat mystical, saw the spectre of Abdul Aziz rise before her !" What a sensational incident for the future historian to dilate upon !
