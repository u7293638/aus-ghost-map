assumed by the Legisla tue Council in Tasmania lhat body appears to us to Ime airogated to itself lunctions altogcthei outside the proper proMiice of a second Chambei, and to lwvo adopted oiiensrve means foi the purpose of enfoicmg submission to its will We now turn fiom an Uppei House sinning to one gue\ously sinned igamst As oin leaders may îememboi, stamp duties form patt of the scheme wheieby the Paikes Government pi o pose to place the finances of New South V\ iles upon a sound foot uig A bill imposing these taxes ?was hid before the Assembly, and wlnle it was under discussion some lion membeis pointed out that the measure as worded made the taxes applicable to piomi^soiy notes already drawn, but -whick would not mature until after the date fixed for the act to come into opeiation " At "first," says our Sjdney correspondent, " the Treasuier said he should tike " advantage of this interpretation, but " on being piessed he avowed his will " mgness to give up the claim," having obtained " a legal opinion to the effect " that the act does not necessarily bear " tins ex jml facto construction " In the ordinary process of law making the bill made its appearance ni the Council, where certain gentlemeti thought it would be well to lemovo all ambiguity There is nothing m the Constitution Act of New South Wales to prevent that body from amending money bills, and as it is desirable that all the obli gâtions of tho people should bo clearly expressed by law, and not left depend cnt on the vi ill of any Minister, there cannot be a doubt that the Upper House, m insisting on this technical amendment-it must be îemembered that it did not meddle with any question of pohcj-was completely justified both m a constitutional and practical sense Mr SAMUEL, on behalf of tho Go \ eminent, assured the Council that it was not intended to pres3 for the duties objected to, and ad nutted that his fellow members had a legal and constitutional right to insist on this intention being clearly ex piessed He entreated them, how ever, not to amend a money bill, as the Assembly might resent such an exercise of legal constitutional power as a breach of pnv liege The position was as foi lows -The Assembly having failed in its dutj to make a tax bill clearly ex press the intention of the House, the Council was to abstain ftom using its admitted power to rectify the erior, for feai the negligent body should take offence at li iving its ladies remedied Practically the Council answered Mr SAMUIL m this wise -" The Assembly " can have no pmilege resting " on a broader basis than the Constitu " tion Act, from which both Houses " derive their rights, and it " would be absurd foi the Council not " to make an amendment which the " Government itself approves of, lest " the Assembly, from a false pride, " should lay the measure aside " The amendment was accoidmgly ? made, but when the bill was returned to the Lower Chamber, it was laid asido on the motion of the Government This course was adopted on a foimei occasion m connexion with a bul hkew ise dealing with stamps, but then another measure was at once introduced, em bodying the Council's alteration In other words, the Council's will was earned out while the Assembly went through a performance by which it satisfied itself that it vindicated some imaginary rights This time, how ev er, something more serious is ap patently intended The Upper House has crossed the path of the present Ministry more than once, notably when it rejected a questionable Land Act Amend mentBill,and refused to confer objection able pow ers on Parliament in the guise of puvileges Tor peifornmig the duties foi which it exists, it was voted con tumacious by the Government, and a resolution was framed to bring it to its knees Accoidmgly another bill was mtroauced into the Assomblj and passed in a hurry, leaving the ambiguity ob jected to by the Council untouched On coming before the Upper House, it w as throw n out on the technical objec tion that it is unconstitutional to sub mit a bill twice m the same session This rebuff appears to have pro voked Sir HENRY PVRKLI, to wrath, and to have furnished lum with what he considers a fitting opportunity of proclaiming war a out) ance against the Second Chambei We learn by telegraph that on Thursday night the hon gentleman moved the adjournment of the House for the pur pose of commenting m very stiongterms on the course taken in answei to his deliberate challenge When we le membei that the Council did nothing more than exercise its admittedly legal and constitutional pow eis to rectify an enor caused bj the Assembly's idleness or mdifierence, and to define the obligations of the people with that accuracy which is essential to public liberty, we read the following îemarLs with wonder and amazement - Sir HENEY PARKES declared that " the " step was entiiely unprecedented, and " he questioned whethersuch an instance " of unprovoked insult had occurred m " any legislative bod), 01 such an unne " cessaiy step taken merelj for the pur " pose of showing a contemptuous feel " mg for the other branch of the Legis " latuie " It appears to us that the accusation bl ought b) the wolf against the lamb was not more unjust than Sir HENRY PARKES'S charges against the Houso which he evidently wishes to devour The conduct of Sir HENRI PVRKES in the matter is not more strange than are the arguments by which he attempts to justify it Ile admits that both Houses exist under a written constitu tion, fiom which they derive all the powers they possess, and also allows that under that statute the Upper House has the power of amendment which it exercised But he main tams that it is necessaiy for the Assembly to claim equal rights with the House of Commons in deal ing with the appropriation of money Ho leminds the Assembly that there was a time when the House of Lords was the more powerful Chamber, and that the House of Commons has won its rights and pnv lieges by insisting upon them And, finally, he holds that the Upper House, as in every formel instance, has been the onginator of the cau=e of difference, not the Assembly 'W e shall not argue these points at length until we aie m possession of a full report of the lion gentleman's last dehveiance on the subject While awaiting this, wo den) the necessity mentioned The extieme financial privileges of the House of Commons are sun ii als fiom the time when the people of Lnfjhnd were wanging their libeities f i oin the Ciown and anttocracj The assertion of the pow ei of the purae was the pimcipal weapon with which the battle of English fieedom was fou.htand won, bul now that the conlhct is ovei, and the lights of the Bntish i ice are founded on a basis as immovable as a rock, it is folly to go about brandishing an antiquated implement m the face of all coméis Hie danger nowadays is, not that any body in the state will encroach upon the privileges of i opulai Assemblies, bat that popular Assemblies, having acquired almost despotic control over ever)body and ever)thing, will degeneiate into public nuisances, and be sv\ ept aw ay ev entually as burdens too grievous to be boine Let those who doubt the possibility of such a catastrophe noto tho tendency of public opiuica m America respecting popular institutions With regard to the attempt to cast the blaine of tho quarrel upon tho Council, we shall only si} we are soiry that anything so unfair should ha\e onginateu with a gentleman for whose abilities as a statesman wo lmethe gicatest respect In matteis meteorological Au'traha LI somewhat behind the age Hero as in other countries there aro observers and obsenatones, by means of whick much .valuable infoiniatioii is collected, but as jet no general system has been estab hslied foi turning that knowledge to immediate and practical account In the other hemisphere, on the contrary, meteoiology has been so systematisod that w eather reports have ceased to bo mere records-they are now accepted as guides and warnings both by the careful manner and the watchful agriculturist A comparison of the weather telegrams íeccn ed daily at Greenwich from the Continent and America enables the obsen er to make a tolerably accurate forecast of the weather, and the bursting of a storm on the British coast is often foretold a day or two m advance by tele graph from New York or Washington Weather forecasts are accurate in pro portion to the distances from which the repoits come Observations taken from points close at hand, no matter how numerous, convey littlo information be } ond the local state of the weather, but let the sources of information be far apart, and intelligence is obtained regarding the direction of air currents and the centi es of barometric elevation and de pression, which enables the obseiver to anticipate almost with certainty any great atmospheric disturbance The want of a sjstem such as that in operation at the other end of the woild has been long recognised by Austialian meteorologists, and steps from time to time hav e been taken towards its establishment An exchange of w eather telegrams now takes place between the colonies of Victoria, New South Wales, South Aus tralia, and Queensland, but the number of stations is too limited and too much confined to the coast, while the colonies of New Zealand and Tasmania, which fiom their geographical position are indispensable to tho institution of a perfect system of weather telegiaphy for Australia, have kitkerto keld aloof from the ai rangement Witk the view of inducing these colonies to take an acti\ e interest m the question and of extending the existing system, a con ference of meteoiologists was recently held in Sjdney, the repoit of whick ia before us ïhe conference consisted of the Government astronomers of Vic tona, New South Wales, and South Austiaha, and the inspector of meteoro logical stations, New Zealand Queens land and Tasmania were invited to send représentatif es, but they did not do so In the case of Tas mania, there appears to be no de partaient of meteorology, so that thero could have been no official representa tion, but there are pmato obseivatories at Hobart Town and elsewhere, and the duty might hav e been undertaken by some one The co operation of Tas mima can scarcely be done without, and it is to be hoped that the assistance which will be needed ni the future will not be asked for m vain The import ance of Tasmania m a sj stem of Aus traban weather telegraphy was pointed out by Mr ELLLRY, who stated that gi eat advantage would be deuved from the establishment of a station at Hobart Town, because if Hobart Town obsen ations were considered m connexion with atmospheric move ments on the western coast of Aus ? tralia and the subsequent weather on the east coast, it would be found that those obsen ations would often deter mine w bethel the easteily movement had been deflected by any other current "The observations at Hobait Town," Mr ELLLRY said, " would indicate a " considerable time beforehand whether " the disturbance would become a " serious one on the eastern coast of " Austiaha Tor instance, it was a fact " that the gale m which the Dandenong " was wrecked was indicated at Hobart " Town thirty hours before it reached "Sjdney" The necessity of combined action on the part of the various colonies was demonstrated m other waj s during the deliberations of the conference lor instance, the Government astronomer of New South Wales, Mr BUSSELL, said that from tho experience in reference to gales whick he had obtained duiing a number of years, it was quite evident that observations taken m New Zealand and tke soutkern colonies would furnisk valuable warnings to the colonies situated further north Ho îeferred, like Mr ELLERY, to tke Dan dcnong gale, and remarked tkat from wkat had been subsequently ascertamed, it appeared tkat information nugkt kave been given at tke different ports along the coast sufficiently m advance to pro vent the great loss of propel ty which took place during that atoini-that is to say, if there had been m force a complete system of weather telegraphy suck as tko conference desires to esta blisk To make tke sjstem com plete, every colony must take pait, for, as -we kave already said, the more distant tke points of observation, tke gi eater tko value of the îeports The advantage, moieover, will be mutual This was well lllustiated by Dr HtcTOE, the Now Zealand dele gate, who showed how desirable it was that Queensland should join in the pi o posed scheme, by stating that it wis from that quartei tint early notico would be íeceived of the oiigm and pio0iess of thedangeious and suddenly occunmg cj clones which crossed tho northern put of New Zealand On the othci hand, whilo the southeily gdfó could not of couise bo dnectly pre dieted in Australia for New Zeilmd, Australia could dome fiom New /ea land eaily miormation of tho occui leuce of such gales, and piobably Queensland would recene the gieateit benefit norn such predictions The main conclusions of the confei enco are, that all the colonies should bo united to join m a comprehensivo vvcathci system, and that additional stations at great altitudes should bo estnblisked, MZ , at Mount Lofty, South Australia, at Kiandia, New South "U ales , at Taupo and Mount Ilerbeit, New Zealand , at Mount Wellington, Tasmania , and at Mount Macedon, \ ic tona There are otker matters of detail which need not be referred to Tho great advantages whick will o° obtained from carrymg out thoso .suggestions may bo secured at a very moderate cost. Instrumenta for the new stations can bo obtained from the observatories alieady established, and tha employment of highly-paid officers "will not be necessary, the duties being simplo and easy of performance. The most serious item of evnendituio will bo tho New Zealand and Tasmanian cable charges, but the Tolegiaph Company, it is undcistood, will transmit tho messages at half rates, and the total cost is not expected to exceed £350 per annum, which the conference recom- mends should bo defrayed hythe par- ticipating colonies in equal proportions ( Tho conferenco has done its part-it ^ vnow rests with the Governments of tho various colonies to give effect to its recommendations. It has been shown that inestimable advantages may bo secured at a nominal cost, and wo trust that our own Government and those of tho other colonies will give the scheme every assistance in their power. It is understood to be tho intention of the Cabinet fó appoint to morrow a no»v ludgo of tho County Court Wo do not "now how many candidates thero may bo for tho position, but tho claims of ono gentleman aro urgod so pertinaciously that it becomes our duty, on tho ovo of tho appointment, to repeat our objections to tho choice which tho Government is urged to mako Tho only ground, as fai as wo can soo, upon which Mr F L SVIYTH IS rocom mended to tho fav our of tho Govornmont is that ho was promised tho appointment by tho lato Ministry, and that, in accoid ance with tho understanding arrived at, 'io lofiained fiom presenting himself foi ro election foi North Gipps Land That ho ia not qualified for the position is well known, and m point of fact Mr SEKV lot and lus colleagues aro

of day rho doings of County Court judgos aio, m fact, much less open to scrutiny than those of tho occupants of tho Supremo Couit Bondi It must bo remembered also that tho County Court is in tho majonty of coses a final tribunal, from winch practically theio is no appeal Tho County Court Bench is not at present too stiong, and it xs desuablo that tho Govornmont should show its mtontion of taking a now do partuio by making an appointment that will command tho confidence of tho com munit) and strengthen the lower blanch of tho judiciary, which is idally of as much importance to tho

chuca on Saturdaj last was waited upon at the Rochester railwaj station by a number of residents of Rochester, who represented to him that a public meeting had been held, at which it had been decided that tho Govern- ment should be asked to forego tho selectors' rents due to the 1st March until tho expira, tion of their leases, and that such indulgence should be extended in all cases Mr Duffy, in reply, said the Government would not use any harsh measures against selectors, but he w as not prepared at that moment to say how far their leniency could be extended There was now an apparent deficiency of £145 900 m tho receipts from land revenue, and the requirements of the Treasury must be con sideied He could, however, promise that the subject should receive moat careful cou Bideration On Saturday the Minister of Public torlea, accompanied by the inspector general, made an examination of tho works m progress for the Militarj road, between St Kilda and Sandridge, and also inspected the filling in works at Terrara street, Eme- rald hill, where silt from the Harbour Trust dredgeB is received by the department, and used for making the low ground available ultimately for sale The Chief Justice, as judge of the Vice admiralty Court, gav e judgment on Saturday in a suit by the owners of the Claud Hamilton steamer against the owner of the barque Eden, to recover damages for a collision between the two vessels The collision took place some months a^o, and the owners of the Claud Hamilton had been put to consider able expense in effecting repairs &c; His Honour considered that the Eden was to blame for the collision, and condemned her (o pay the expenses which he assessed a' £1 008, but offered to send the accounts for mquirj before the registrar and merchants if it was desired He expressed a hope that m future cases of the kind the parties would appoint assessors to act with him AB tho Old Court houso will be required to day for tho holding of the Central Criminal Court before the Chief Justice, the civil causes for trial before Mr Justice Stephen and juries of six will be tried m the Insolvent Court house Swanston street 1 he Rev Thomas Jones, of Collins streot Independent Church, bade farewell jester day to his large congregation The attend- ance at both services, and especially m tho evening, waa enormoua Every portion of the church was crowded, the passages were pacltcd.andhundreds had to be accommodated m tho corndora and balconies and many hundreds more had to leav e for want of room At the forenoon service the rev gentleman preached from the text, ' And he (Sampson) wist not that the Lord was departed from lum, and in tho evening from Romana xv , 13-' Now the God of hopo fill jou with all joy and peace m believing, that yo may abound in hope through tho power of the Holy Ghost In bringing his evening remarks to a conclusion, he said that Ins real farewell waa not uttered at the Thursday's meeting, but it was contained in these eitht lines - " Tare«eil tor tho prcBont -It is not lor over, I A placo 1B prepared for tlio faithful abovo Tlio house of our fathors tho homo of tho blessed, Tlio liol} of Holies, of worship and lovo Tho pilgrims of earth, the children of sorrow, Shall meet and rojoico and part nov craioro Looking back on the ocean of trouble passed ov or -All encuites conquorcd-from heaven s bright shore Mr Jones sails for England by the mail Bteamer on Triday uext Wo learn that by this mail Mesara Ecrojd and Danby, accountants of this city, hav o received the necessarj powers of attorney constituting them agents vvitlmi this colony for the Standard 1 ire Insurance Company of London (Limited) The company is an influ- ential one, and with it ia incorporated the Belfast Insurance Company (Limited) In the County Court on Tnday, Mary Doll man, a servant girl about 17 j ears old, sued Mr. William Graham, of Ljgon street, furniture dealer, for £19, damages for mab clous prosecution and falso imprisonment Plaintiff s case was that, on the 23rd January last, she entered into the aervico of the defen dant, and that on the following morning she desired to leave because Bho did not like the place, but the defendant would not lot her leave, and charged her with stealing three or four dresses and somo other things Sho denied stealing anj thing, but the defendant gave her into custody of tho police, and Bhe was locked up in tho Mel bourne watchhouse for over an hour On tho following morning the magistrates dis charged her The defence was that there was reasonable and probablo cause for the action Graham had tal en but His Honour Judge Cope after hearing the evidence, stated that he did not think there wag such cause and gave a verdict for the plaintif!
