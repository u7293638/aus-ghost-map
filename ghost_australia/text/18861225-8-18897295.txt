An unfortunate débutant who made his first appearance as the Ghost in Hamlet waa 60 rudely treated by the audience, that in the midst of the scene took off his visor, and put the audience in perfect good humour by saying, " Ladies and Gentleman, it was my hope to please you j if I have failed, JTiiiusi give up the Ghost." , If we would read the secret history of our enemies, we would find in each man's life, sorrow and suffer- ing enough to disarm all hostility.-Longfellow.

Counsel : " The thief who was acquitted this morning with- out a stain on his character, owing to my brilliant defence, is coming this afternoon to thank me." There is a young lady in Belgravia so refined in her language that she never used the word " black- guard," but substitutes " Afiican sentinel." There is a curious erior in Dr. Johnson's Dic- tionary. It occurs in definition 13 of the verb " to sit," "Asses are yo that ait in judgment" (Judges v. 10.) The verse is, " Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way." " Well, may I hope then, dearest, that at some time I may have thediappiness of malting you my wife?" "Yes, I hope so, I am sure," she replied. "I am tired of suiug fellows for breach of promise." "Well, my boy, do you know what 'syntax' means ?" said a schoolmaster to a child of a tee- totaller. " Yes, sir-the duty upon spirits." The following remarkable poemrecently appeared as a prize contribution in an American paper :- *? A ilimflam flopped from a flllamaloo. Win re tilt polly wogg pinked so pale.

" I saw a good thing in one of your pamphlets te day," said a gentleman to a friend who "dabbles" in literature. " Indeed," said the gratified author, smugly; "what was it ?" "Oh! a man came out. of a shop with a mince pie in it !" This is one of the achievements of a writer in "a high-class military weekly : " At twelve o'clock the guns commenced firing a royal salute, and after- wards gave^ three hearty cheers." Specimens of pigeon English are as plentiful as ever. An editor recording the career ot a mad dog, says, "We aro grieved to say that the rabid animal, before it could be killed, severely bit Dr. Hart, and several oiJicr dogs."

A newspaper chronicling the wrecking of a, vessel, says, " The only passengers were T. B. Nathau( whe owned three-fourths of the cargo and the Captain's wife."

Out of this, the re- cipients, in consultation assembled, made : "1 have wondpred all along whethpr uiy bquirt had denied the scandal about the President meeting Jane ia the woods on Saturday.
