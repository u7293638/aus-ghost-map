A Yamba 'Spook.' One evening last week, after darkness had- chased away the twilight, it was noised abroad at Yamba that there was a ghost' in the vicinity of the Post- office, dressed in' dazzling whiteness, and it was said that occasionally it would dart out at timid passers-by from a thicket, utter ing a shout, and' then quietly retire. Not a few people, including some young ladies, .received a shook from the eccen tric behavior of the apparition, and in due course, Constable Redmond bore down that way to investigate. The ghost menacingly appeared as usual, but the man in blue cloth became a little sceptic as to its genuineness, and pounc ed upon it. The 'spook' did not de materialise, so the constable tore away the ghastly covering, which it was found consisted of a couple of white sheets, , and thus revealed the human frame of one named Edward Welsh, who appear ed little agitated at thus being dis covered playing his joke. ? To prevent a recurrence of this behavior the officer administered a dose of ' blue paper,' in answer to which the offender appeared at the Maclean police court, when tho Bench fined him 10s and 4s lOd costs, just as a reminder that they were of opinion such foolish pranks should bo suppressed. _ Strange to say, however, the. charge was one of riotous behavior, although, the conduct complained of was in the line of a practical joke. â€” Advocate.
