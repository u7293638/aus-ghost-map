R. L. Stevenspn in : Samoa. . His Earthly Paradise. His Health Improved. Aecdrdtng to An Aucltldnd journal Mr. Jlobevt Louis Stevenson, the well- known author, says ho will livo and dio in his Siimoun parndiso. It is a vonl- nblo droainhiud whero the novolist lives. His homo' istwo miles from Apia, 011 the island of Upolu, and tho sight of the house was, .when, lio- bought it, a virgin forest,'- through which the foot had novor trod. "TI10 house taeos 011 tho sea ; about it are' the great loaves ,o£ the cocoanut palm. and breadfruit trees within. it is all. that civilisation can' furr.iBh to mini ster to. creature comfort. Olio who hnd visited Stevenson thoro two months ago .says : — "Ho is still vory thin and fragile ; Ins -shoulders nro bent, and his chest bog his hollow. But his voico is strong and hoarty, and his grasp firm. Hie i complexion has lost its deathly whiteness, and is now a healthy bronze. He still wears his hair long, nnd his dolicate effeminate mouth is shaded by a droop ing moustache. His eyes, too, Boomed to be hnlf cloBcd and dreamy, and I10 talks, witlra slow, languid drawl." Ho boliovos he has found a safe haven from consumption at tho island of Upolu, nnd hopes to livo to a ripo old ago. Ho has no thought orenre for affairs on tho otlior side of tho globo. If thore should jbe a massacre of Europeans at Samoa . because of tho hoary taxes imposed on 'tlio natives, he lias no fear of .personal 'injury, fqr.ho.beliovos tlmt tho natives respect and trust liim. Ho may use his i spate time, in' writing anothor book. In fact, lib has alroa ly a deal of manu script ready fpr tho; printer. But lio has. no desire over, to change lits locus, and withhis wifo aiid mother lio will dream away, " existence ; atnid tho ghosts with which 'liis faiiby.lins peopled his house and-Hp surroundings.
