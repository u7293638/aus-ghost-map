PROFESSOR PEPPER. Everyone has either seen or heard of "Pepper's Ghost," but here we have the opportunity of seeing the original inventor of the startling illusion in our midst, and being present at the series of scientific festivals which he will give during the next week at St. James's Hall. Professor Pepper comes to us with a world-wide reputation as one of the best quali- fied and most accurate lecturers on matters of science in the whole world. His lectures are instructive and deeply interesting, and at the same time amusing, and he contrives to impart information in such a remarkably simple manner that it must be comprehended by the dullest intelligence. His lectures are not of the weary- ing class, and never prove a tax upon the patience of the audience. He makes them amusing not only by the force of eloquence and humor, but by the most interesting experiments, which never fail to delight both young and old. For some time past he has been delighting and instructing large audiences in Melbourne and Ballarat, and we have no doubt that the oppor- tunity of witnessing his experiments will be seized by thousands in this city. The first lecture will be given on Monday night, and is entitled "Light and Optics," to be followed by the remarkable series of illustrations of torpedo warfare. The lectures will be illus- trated on a magnificent scale by new and costly optical apparatus, photographs, diagrams, the oxy-hydrogen and the electric light, and each evening the entertainment will be varied. The prices of admission are exceedingly reasonable and within the reach of all. Season tickets price 12s., transferable, admitting holder to each entertainment. Front seats may be obtained at Mr. Evans' music warehouse; also tickets for all parts of the hall.
