CHURCH BOOK SOCtKTY. A Third Lecture delivered before the Church I ol' England Book Socicly, on Wednesday j evening last, by the Rev. R. ALLWOOD, B.A., Minister of St. James's Church, Sydney. { IN my Ia3t lecture I considered the at gomen t upon which the claim advanced by the Bishop of Rome to universal jurisdiction is based, viz., as successor to the rights and preroga Uves of St Peter I showed that, though St Peter may be saul to have Inda ceitain pn ority amongst the \postlcs,-the fust amongst Ins equals,-this puorily was stiielly perso- na!-that it earned with it no oflieul su premncy or right of authority-that no such authority was ever asseited by lum, 01 oxer eised by lum, over the other Apostles, 01 ni any way acknowledged bt¡ flu m Ibis I demonstrated from many | as"iges of Sei 11 tin o, as well ns from the willie sol miutv ol the emly lathcis, who beni evidence to the fact tint the Yposlles weie endued with equal iiilhouly mid potvci I then directed your attention lo the willinga of the Tuiliers who lived m the day 3 of the Vposlles, and to the ejtly canons jin! constitutions of the Church, called npostoli cal, and I showed fi oin these ancient docu ment«, that not only was theie no leeognilion by them ol Ihe pieteiiMons advanced tor the Bishop and Chin cb ol Rome,-but, on lbs J continry, that thev contained pnssuL.cs which | could not possibly be reconciled willi the ex- istence of such pietciisions,-mid were theie fore convincing evidence that such pieten sious weie unknown 111 tho c days We have this evening to consider the evi dence 111 point ottered by Ireiueiis, leittillian, Origen, ni d Cyprian, which connects the chain of testimony with the apostolic I alhcrs, and from them to the Apostles, mil caines it down to the middle ot the third ecntuiy-to the year 258 Bcfoic I cnloi upon the considciation of their testimony, I think it necessary to oflei n few ob crv allons In

any c thcr Tailler bearing testimony winch may, at fust sijit, seem favourable to the c1 uni of Rome, unless his testimony be conlnmed by the consenting voice of the whole Chin cb, wo at once

doctiines of revel 1 tion, with which the bellefin this claim is im- piously associated as being necc snry to sal- vation, it would ncvoi have been denied or rejected by any one of tlie holy I others of the Church 1 lins oui appeal is not lo the opinions of any one 1 utbei, but t > the agreement of the whole We look upon them ns witnesses to facts and doetimos- whole then witness is unanimous, theie we beat the voice of the Chinch,- where their sentiments me not 111 union thev cany onlj the weight which we attach to the individual opinions of, as it may be, good, und holy, and devout, but

to consider the testimony of the early Fathers, is they have been mar shalled before us, in a pamphlet lately put forth by the Church of Rome. in assertion of the supremacy and universal jurisdiction of the Roman Pontiff The first of the Fathers to whom our atten ion is directed is Irenæus, and as this Father has been cited as a witness to the supremacy of Rome and appeals nie conptanllv made to his writings as establishing her claim, I beg your patience while I direct your attention very particularly to him, the more so as from the early age in which he lived, and his having been said by Eusebius to have been the pupil of Polycarp, the Disciple of St John, and to have particularly noted every thing that fell from that holy man, we may expect from him a true account of apostolical faith and order The Church of Lyons, of which he was the bishop, elected about the year 177, as suc cessor to the venerable Pothinus, who was martyred in the persecution under the Em peror Marcus Aurelius, was not only exposed to the open barbarities of the enemies of Christianity, but was undermined and be- trayed by heretical teachers, whom he con stantly withstood, and to refute whose per- nicious doctrines he composed an elaborate treatise against heresies Ii is lo lins work md to the following pas sage in it that the Church of Rome refers, as a witness to her claims, which passage, I would have you to notice, comes to us through the medium of a clumsy Latin translation, as the original Greek has been lost, and we are therefore at the mercy of a translator for its accuracy Arguing against the Gnostic here tics, Irenæus says, (lib in c 3), " The tradition of the Apostles being manifested through all the world, it remains to be seen throughout the whole Church, by those who wish to behold the truth We are able to enumerate those who were appointed bishops by the Apostles in the Churches, and their successors to our own time, who taught and knew nothing like what these men rave about But since it would be tedious to reckon, in such a volume, the successions of all the Churches, we confound all those whom any manner, whether through self gratification, or vainglory, or through blindness and evil opinion, infer what is un- seemly, by the successions of the bishops of that greatest most ancient, and universally known Church, founded and constituted at Rome by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul—showing the tradition which it has from the Apostles and the faith an nuonced to them and descending even to us For to this Church on account of the more powerful principality, it must needs be that the whole Church should resort, that is, those who are faithful on every side ; in which tho tradition, which is from the Apostles, has al ways been perceived by those who are round about it The blessed Apostles, therefore, founding and regulating this Church, deli vered to Linus, the work of the episcopate to whom succeed Anacletus,' and so on. He goes on to -a), " And also Polycaip, who was not only taught by the Apostles, and had convened with many of those who had seen Christ but was even constituted bishop n the Chinch of Smyrna bj the Apostles who were m Asm Ile likewise tnight aliviys those things which he had lern ned from the Apostles, which he delivered to the Chinch, and vv li cb alone are trt e lo these tilings all the Chinches which me in Asia hear tes timony, and those who, even to the present day,'have succeeded Polycarp " " Ile wns the mau who, when he enme to Rame, in the time uf Aniectus, convened many heielics lo llie Chinch of God, deelanng that, he had leceived from the Apostles, that one and only system of truth which he deliveied to the Church" Heie then is the passage with iii coiittit-nnd let lis patiently consider it 1 be words which mc selected out of this pat 8ige are those in which Iictanis declares, that to the Chinch of Romr, li) lenson of the moie po« oí ful puiicipjllt), it must needs be that the whole Church resort, that is, those who arc faithful on eveiy side, m winch tho li «dillon which is from the apostles has bee i preserv ed Ihcsc words are btought forward fo piove that, in the opinion of Iren eus, tin Bishop of Rome then p sscsscd supreme authority over the Chuslian .vorId and that the Church of Rome was acknowledged tobo by divine right the molhci and mistress of nil the Churches Bul llie words of Irei mis authorise no inch conel ision, and the manner m which he intro- duces the mention of Rime sufficiently provea that he did not hold her supreme m tlic seine in wh eli she is now tmvht tobo foi lie c\piessly states, that he mentions, Hunte otili/ became it ti auld be tedious to mention other Chinches with the neccssaiy succession of bishops lie speaks of all the Apostles lndifieiently, and of then tradition through- out tlic world He makes the establishment of the Church of Rome the joint net of Pelei and Paul, staling in i osilive terms (lui they set Linus over that Church as its bishop, mid not intimating in the slightest decree that Peter ever established himself ns bishop theie, or tniufcncd his chnir fiom Anuocli to Rome And with respect to the more powerful puncipulity- Iieuaus uses not a wold winch connects this piincipnlily with the Chinch, m willi the bishop-but lefeis simply to the location of the Church in tint city, vv Inch was then mid foi many yeaiBbolore and afterwards the acktiowled"ed mistiess of the world When we consider how nnny clements of gicntness mid influence must have centered m llie Roman bishop and his Church, we rather wonder that the usuipatlon ofuiiivcrsul powei was not soonei assumed Rome was the place of -oncourse-(lie cen le of vv ealth-the school of lite ralm e- the empo imm of the whole Western Woild nnd llie Church of Rome would consequently enj ly proportionate liiilucnee among the minor Churche" Ilei cleigy would almost neces- sarily become the centre of communication to the whole Church , their favour and recogni- tion would be a passport lo the confidence of ollie i Churches, and hence Ihty would acquit c veiy treat importance through the whole Western Woild All this we willingly concede Piectsely such a state of things do we see in thepiesent d ly in the influence e\eici»ed by the Church ' of Lnglnnd ovei the Colonial Chinches in communion with her Hie distinction here granted, and the nccessai) results of it, of the Christian Chinche« mund about resorting lo Rome, would he equally suited to the aignment of liol iciis, vvhcthei bt Pelei had evci been at Rome oi not li would billi have boen the Chinch of the more powcilnl principality It would still have c\eiciscd influence oior the olhcrjé-hinclies in MI lue of its scat m the mefiopolis of the world Die distinctir ii w na purely set ulm, m mug 11 oin the advantages of its position-mid lieiitons does not use one vv oi d winch ittrthtites to it an i other chai vctci Ile does not mal c use uf one sut gie c\picssion vvhleh could lead tis to suppose ihat he attributed any judicitil authinty to the Roman Church His nigument is in favour of its ciediblo testimony, winch was considerable, inasmuch as Chiistians had commonly lecouise to it But thcie is another, nnd a much more conclusive, justification of the sense in which this passage of lienitus is lo be uiideistood, and his opinion on the supremacy ind jims diction of Rome over other Churches gntheied from a fact related hy linn, and recorded by I u«ebms, the OCCICMBSIICI!

But before we conclude with the testimony of tin» lather, I would obseivc that if mywiieie the supicmacy ol Rpnie is \ pi ic'.ical point, it is in the reputation of heretics ; and we have just quoted Irenæus and Tertullian, both ex- pressly writing on the principles of the Chris- ti in Church against heretics, and both cx pressing themselves m a manner most opposed to tlie pnneiples oi Rome, Ihey both appeal expressly to the judgment and authority of' Rome Ilicj icfer o her as an apostolic Sec ¡ lliey usseit that other apostolic Sees luve M equal authority with her in tener»! I hey allow to each of them the some weight and authority in determining this controversy with the Gnostics, but yet for particular reasons they refer to Rome more especially , and what are those reasons? Because, says Irenæus, " It were too long to enumerate the succession of all the Churches." What says Tertullian ?" Is Achaia near thee?- Thou hast Corinth. Macedonia?-Thou hast Phi lipi Asia ?-Thou hast Ephesus. But if thou art near to Italy, thou hast Rome, whence we also have an authority at hand." So, then, the region in which he dwells shall determine the choice of a Church to whose authority especially to refer, according to Tertullian ; his convenience shall be pleaded as an excuse for demonstrating the authority of the Church only seeing that one is suffi cient according to Irenæus , and yet we are to believe that that one is the only one whose authority ever was sufficient— the only one to which all notions and Churches should defer, and to refuse obedience to which is to be out of the pale of salvation!

Inn thnt the Gallic Bishops should J MUW whether (hey were hktly to be sun \ polled in faking no strong a step ns the depo- sition of one of their own colleagues. If tho Churches of Rome and Carthago had con- tinued to recognize the deposed Bishop, n schism must unavoidably have ensued ; but if the two most important cities in the West ngrccd to hold no intercourse vv ¡th Murdanna, there was little chance of his being able to establish a party. " About the same period, in the year 253, an application was.made to Cyprian from tho bishops of Spuin :-Bnsilius and Mortialis, two of their bishops, hat! been deposed from their Sees, but upon going to Rome and making out a false statement to Stephen, the Bishop of Rome-, they were favourably ie ceivcel by bim ¡ mid by his influence and tes- timony he endeavoured to have them restored. Upon which the two bishops who had been elected in their room, went in person to Cor thugc, mid laid their case before Cyprinn. Ho immediately summoned a council of thiity seven bishops, and, having examinée! the cn se, vvroto a letter lo the Spanish bishops-, ad- vising them to udhere to what they had done ; apologising for the imprudence of Stephen, by observing that he was a long way off, «nil lind been deceived by a false nccoiin', and was therefore not so much to be blamed ns they who hod deceived lum ¡ but at the same time declaring, that if any person held com- munion with Basilides and Martialis he be- came a partner in their guilt." His own words are : "Bnsilides, dejected in crime, has gone to Rome, and deceived our colleague Stephen, who lives at a distance, and is ignorant of the true state of affairs. He who was taken una- wares and deceived, is not to be condemned ns much na he who practised tho fraud suc- cessfully. Wherefore, dearest brethren, al- though there be some of our colleagues who venture to neglect the divine discipline, and rashly communicate with Bnsilides and Mar- tialis, our confidence should not be disturbed. But, we equally praise omi approvo the reli- gious earnestness of your integrity and faith : and to ihe utmost of our power we exhort you not to stain yourselves with the sncii legious communion of profane and tainted bishops, but to maintain jealously and with a religious fear the unshaken integrity of your faith." ' Ad Clerum et plebes Ilisp. Ep. C8. Thus, then, the deposition of Basilides was declared to be valid and canonical, notwith- standing the opposition of Stephen. Basilides appealed to Rome-his colleagues appealed to Cartlinge. By Rome he vvns_ acknowledged, his deposition declared invalid, mid himself received into communion; by Carlliii"o he was interdicted, and his deposition confirmed. And what was the result? The bishops of the several Churches in Spain refused to bold communion with him, and confirmed his suc- cessor, Stibinus, in his Seo ¡ that is, they fol- lowed the directions of the Bishop of Carthago, and rejected the judgment of bim who we aro told is thoSuprome Ruler of the Church on earth, There is but one other incident in Cyprian's life to which I will allude, and. on which occa- sion his conduct showed most clearly that he had no knowledge of the pretensions of a ' bishop of Rome to universal jurisdiction, ol- io be the judge in matters of faith and Church j principles. It was the judgment of Cyprian, I thnt all who should be converted from heresy, and who had received their baptism at the I hands of heretics, should be admitted into the Church, by her own baptism. To this ¡ opinion, Stephen, Bishop ot Rome, wau op- posed. Cyprian, however, and his colleagues in Africa, held a provincial council, and would yield not one jot to theil" brother the . Bishop of Rome- and their conduct on this I occasion is utterly irrccohcilcuble with the supposition of their acknowledgment of the I supremacy or jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Some of his letters lo those who np-' plied to him for advice arc still extant. He gives his judgment without any reference to the doctrine and practice of the Church of. Rome, and concludes a letter to Magnus, with the right which every bishop had, to de- termine such matters, without reference to the authority of any other person or prelate whatever. "I have answered your question according to the best of my ability, and, as far as I could I have given you my opinion j without dictating to any, so as to prevent any ' bishop from determining according lo his own judgment, as one who shall render nn account of his acts milo the Lord."-Jip. 70'. In his epistle to Pompeii», he accuses Ihe bishop, Stephen, of "sacrificing the cause of the Church of God to heretics"-and brands his reasoning as " nrrogant and impertinent, as careless, unskilful, and contradictory ;" ho objects to his arguments us aiui-christiun and such only as blindness of henrt and corrup- tion of manners could suggest." Ho does not hesitate to express a doubt how far the course which Stephen was pursuing was consistent with n «tate of salv.ilion-und ho couclucles thus indignantly, " Does lie give glory to God who communicates with the baptism of Mar- don?" Does he give honour to God who vindicates the cause of heresy against the Church, forsaking the unity and truth which carne from tlie law of God .' Docs ho give glory to Goel.vvho, the friend of heietics, the enemy of Christ, judges those priests of God worthy of excommunication who defend (he truth of Christ and the unity of the Church? But if, dearest brother, we hove any love of God, any faith und regard fur the truth, as faithful soldiers of God, let us fight for a tiue fnith and a pure religion ; willi the courage of tried fidelity, let us guurd the camp divinely committed to our keeping."-Ep. 7'I. Let us now consider the letter written by Cyprinn lo Stephen on Ibis point : after a second Synod, held to determine this ques- tion, where were seventy- one African bishops, besides Cyprian, assembled. Stephan, we must bear in mind, had expressed hw opinions publicly, and had actually carried his threats of interdict into execution against the Afi ¡can bishops, i. c., lie had refused lo hold com- munion with them ; and Cyprian, in address- ing bim, docs so in the spirit of nu equal, without any mark of submission, or even deference lo bim ns a superior ; 'but with tho courtesy of brotheily communion-arguing with firmness and decision, exhorting bim to i avoid a breach ol'communion on the question before thom ; and asserting Hie equal rights of all bishops to rer/ttlale the effnirs of their own Church, and their responsibility to God alone, " These things we have made known to you, dearest brother, from regard to our mutual respect, and as befits my sincere regard for you ; trusting that your own piety and soundness in the faith, will sufficiently com- mend to yon what is itself religions mid orthodox. We know, however^ that some men are unwilling to lay down opinions which they hove once taken up, and aro not easily persuaded to confessa change in their senti- ments : yet they may retain the opinions which they have once adopted as their own, without sacrificing the pence and unity of their colleagues. And we, in the maller be- fore d3, neither impose) restraint, nor dictate a rule of proceeding to any man, since every bishop lias full right to administer the nffuhs of his own Church aecoiding to his own judg moiit, having to render unto the Lord an account ol'his acts."-Ad Sleph. Ep. 72. Stephen, however, neither adopted.the ad- vice ol Cyprian nor the judgment of the Afri- can bishops, but still refused communion with those who dissented from his opinion. Hud the present system been the system of the early Chuich, one of two things must have followed,-either tliqt the African bishops must have submitted, or have been cut off from the Church ns schismatics. But what did occur? . A third synod met, whore were eighty-seven bishops present, all of whom gnvo their voices in favour of the judgment of Cyprian, and against the re- corded interdict of communion of the then Pope of Runic. Surely all these men must have known wlmt were the true principles of Church polity : Ihey could not surely hove been ignorant if the Bishop of Rome had possessed the authority and jurisdiction now claimed for liim. And the only conclusion to which we can come is, that thev knew them- selves to be severally bishops of free and in- dependent Churches, bound together by one ehjiin, tlie chain of unity-of wltioh uiieh bishop and Church formed a link, and that they knew nothing of a Bishop of Rome, as the centre of unity or supreme head of the Church. The true Catholic principle upon which Cyprian and his colleagues acted on this oc- casion, is one which lies at the root of Church polity-viz., "the equal rights and indepen- dence of all bishops. In the case before us, this piinciple wns directly applied in the denial of any kind of supremacy to the Unman bishop, anil was clearly put forth by Cyprian jn the opening of the Council of Carthage. " // now remains for each of us lo pronounce his judgment on the present question ; judging nt> one, and denying lo nu one the righi of com ? m ii ni cn I i a i; his opinion; for none of us hat elevitl-d himself hilo ei Bishop of bishops, nor does any of as endeavour by the ti/iamitj of his censuréis lo reduce others In the nere.ssili/ of agreeing willi him; since it is the right of enery bishop lo judge for himself, and lo exer che his own authority, ami since nono can judge another any inore than he can bt.jndged by another. But Iel its all expect the judgment if our Lord Jesus Chi ist, who, and who alone, his the sole power, both lo sel ni in the place of Governors of his Church, and lo pronounce judgment onour proceedings."-Co«. Carl hag. de Itelnp. I will now rend a few passages from on Epistle of Tirinilliun, Bishop of Ctoare.i, one of the most eminent prelates of that age. It is addicssed to Cyptim, and he thus writes on Hie conduct of the Bishop of Rome. Speaking of Stephen, he says, .' How great is his error and blindness, who say s that re- mission of sins can be given in the conven- ticle ol'heretics, and who adheres not lo the unity of the one Church, which was built by Christ upon a rock. The power of remitting sins was given to tho Apostles, and to Churches which they founded in pursuances of their mission, by Christ, and to those bishops who have succeeded them by a vicarious ordina- tion. He compares Stephen with Judas ; declares him to have been guilty of the sin of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram ; charges bim with setting up other Rocks, whilst boasting of his succession from St. Peter ; denies that the custom of Rome is sufficient to regulate the Church; accuses Rome of perverting traditions ; and says of her bishop : "Nor docs he who tims betrays and for- sakes unity, .perceive Hie confusion that he occasions, and how far he advances towards the abolition of the true rook of the Christian Church." Thus he declares, that not only is the Bishop of Rome not the centre of unity, but that he lins actually bolrnycd mid forsaken the Chris linn Unity, and is therefore cut off from the Church. And be goes on to soy, apostrophizing Stephen, " You fear not the judgment of God, while you hold out the witness of your ap- proval to heretics against the Church, though the Scripture sail li ' a falsa witness .shall no1 yo unpunished.' Verily you arc worse than all tho heretic? : for when many perceiving their oiror, come over to you, thnt they may receive tito ti tie'light of tho Church, you rather support their errors, and obscuring the light of ecclesiastical truth, involve thom in a darker night of heretical darkness. Of what disscnlion and division throughout nil the Churches have you sown the seeds? What n load ol' guilt have you accumulated on your sliouldois by culling youi self off from so many flocks! Ji'or you have ntl off yourself. Ile not deceived; he is in truth the schismatic who has become by his own act an apostate from Church unify ; for while you imagine thal all can be cul off from you, you have ail off yourself alone from all."-Ad Cypr. Ep. 75. I cite these instances not for the purpose of showing the angry and indignant spirit which it brent lies, but to illustrate the Church prin- ciples which it recognizes ; that the Bishop of Rome, so for from having any chum to supie macy, is clearly declared not to bo even the contra of unity1 ; that the Churches which lie excommunicated were held by Cyprian and his colleagues to be Catholic, and not the Church of Rome ¡ and that Stephen himself, and not Ihey, was cut off fiom the visible bolly of Christ's^ Church, by his deciee. So far from thinking bim to bo the centre of unity, they hold him to have broken the unity, and piefertho communion of the Churches con- demned, to thnt of condemning Rome. Cy- prinn to the day of his martj vdom, in 258, was not in communion with Rome, so thal according to her doctrine he was an heretic, mid therefore excluded from heaven ; and jet he is placed high in the list of her Saints as the blessed Cyprian, and claimed as one of the witnesses to her pretensions. What then may we gather from Cyprian's testimony ? That St. Peter was selected by our Lord ns a typo of the unity of the Church,-but that this character, though it gave him a certain personal priority amongst the Apostles, jet gave bim no nuthoiity over them, for, neither did lie claim, nor Ihey concede, any power to him whatever;-that this unity ia established, not, in the Bishop and the Church of Rome, but III the episcopate, of which each bishop holds n part- that (lie Chinch is built on'the Apostles, lindon the bishops, their successors-not on their agree- ment with the Roman See, but with each ¡ other; thnt nil bishops aro equally indepen- dent, mid responsible only to God ; that the Church of Rome is a principal Sec, nuil ought to toko precedence of Citrthnge, on nccomit of her greater magnitude, and from her having been imbued with the doctrines of the Apostles; but that when she erred, it was . the duty of all other Churches tapratcsl against ' and to expose her et rors, even though it should termínala in d, parlare from her communion, I The present claim of the Bishop of Rome to univeisul jurisdiction over the Church, has not the support of Cyprian mid the African bishops; and though the arrogance and pride of Stephen were in a degree a type of the Papnl tyranny and assumption of supremacy in niter days, such pretensions had evidently not yet been put forth, and were unknown to the early Church in his day. i In my lecture on Tuesilny next, I propose to consider the testimony of the Fathers, Euscbius, Basil, Damasus, Optatus, mid Jerome, in so far ns they bear evidence in favour of, or hostile to, the pretensions, of Rome. i lui; QUKKN'H BIKTUIMY. - The annual Birthday Ball will be held iii the state rooms of the new Government House, which aro being fitted up for that purpose.
