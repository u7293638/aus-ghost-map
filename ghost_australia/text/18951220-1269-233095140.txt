CURLEW 1 CURLEW I The moonlight flutters from the sky, And meets her at the door, A little ghost, whose eteps have passed Across the parlor floor. And ruBtling vines, that lightly tap AgainBt the window pane, Throw shadows on the whitewashed wall% And blot them out &gain.; The moonlight leads her as she goes Across the narrow plain, By all the old familiar ways, That know her steps again. And through the scrub it leadB her on, And brings her to the creek; Bnt by the broken dam she Btope, And Beems as she would speak. She moves her lips, but not a sonnd liippleB the eilent air ; Shearings her little hands—Ah, me I While, overhead, tie black dnck's wine Cuts, like a flash upon The startled air, that scarcely shrinks Ere he afar has gone. Curlew I Curlew! Curlew] Till all the bush -with nameless dread Is pulsing through and through. The moonlight leads her back again, And leaves her at the door, This little ghost,-whose steps have poMed Across the parlor .floor. —MJ.C., in Orange XML&TT.;
