KENSINGTON CAB-STAND. TO THE EDITOR. Sirâ€”Complaints have, been lodged before the Kensington and Norw.ood Council in reference to the dirty state of the vehicles on the road, with a view, seemingly, to throw, all the onus on the drivers; which is most unjust. Had tho Kensington Stand heen allowed to remain in Bridge-street where it had been for the last 16 years or more, such complaints would have been needless, but owing to the unreasoning majority of tho Council, and in spite of the represen tations of the Councillors of Kensington Ward, and in defiance of the wishes of one hundred inhabitants of tho Ward who memorialised the Council to allow the stand to remain as it was, that majority compelled the drivers to ply from a stand oh the furthest verge of the municipal boundary, on a piece of land called by courtesy a road, which the late rains have reduced to a frightful morass, a per fect "slough of despond" for poor cabby, from, which he and his horses struggle on to dry land in the " dirty" state now complained of. Let the ratepayers on next election day sweep away the obstructive majority, and return only those candidates who. will pay some attention to their wishes, by restoring the stand to the drivers from which they have been driven without the ghost of a reason for their expulsion. I am, Sir, &c.;, GUERNSEY.
