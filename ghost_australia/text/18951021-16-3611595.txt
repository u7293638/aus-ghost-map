CONGREGATIONAL UNION OF QUEENSLAND ' THE ANNUAL. SESSION The thirty-fourth annual session of the Queensland Congregational Union was opened in the Vulture-street Congregational Church on Saturday afternoon, 19th instant. The service, which commenced at 3 o'clock, took the form of a united Sunday school gathering and flower service. There was not a huge gathering, but the service was very bright. A very pretty collection of flowers was brought by the children, and at the conclusion of the service. The flowers were sent to the hospital. The chairman for the afternoon was Mr. J. W. Hill, and an excellent address was delivered by the Rev. T. E. Pierce, who took for his text II. Timothy, ii., 2 and 3 "And the things that thou hast heard of Me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. Thou, therefore, endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ." He said that young people should endeavour to become cadets for the King's service. They belonged to the Congregational part of the great army, and their regi- ment in the King's service had rendered good service in the past. It had a splendid history behind it. In concluding an earnest address, he urged them all to be loyal followers of those who had endured hardness for Jesus Christ. The Rev. J. M. Bayley and the Scriptural lesson, and the Rev. it D. Wilson, of Rockhampton, offered prayer. The other ministers present were the Revs. L. C. Jamieson, J. W. Roberts, and J. G. Harris. The sing- ing was very hearty, and the choir was led by Mr. R. J. Holmes, while Mr. IO. J. Schlencker presided at the organ. A public meeting is to be held this evening at 7.30, when a union sermon will be preached by the Rev. Hugh Jones, M.A. The business session opens on Tuesday. Sermon on Congregationalism. ยก In the Brighton-road Congregational Church yesterday two sermons were preached by the Rev. J. M. Bayley on Congregationalism. At the morning; service (the subject was " Congregationalism in the Church," and the text -Mali how, xxiii, S-" One is your Master, even Christ and all ye are brethren." The preacher 'said, " The annual meetings of the union of our churches in Queensland being held this week, it is fitting that we should to-day consider our distinguishing principles as churches, and the reasons for our existence as a denomination. We have principles of faith and polity which do serve to be understood. The liberty to hold and practice these principles was dearly bought by those who have long since passed away. To-day the air is full of wild talk about the union of all the churches. I should rejoice if that were possible. But before that can be possible very much of priestly assump- tion and ecclesiastical intolerance, must be given up, and the truth of myVlfxt, ' One is your Master, even Christ, 'shall all ye are brethren,' must be far more widely received and practised than at present. We Congregationalism believe that each congregation of Christian men and women forms a Christian Church in itself, and has Christ's authority to carry on His work without any external interference or domination whatever. We are not as a denomina- tion one church, but many churches, and our union of churches is only for brotherly counsel, and help, and not for the purpose of interfering with the internal management of Individual churches. The State has no right to, seek to control a man's religious opinions, or to support, with public funds any particular section of the Christian Church. We deny that the civil magistrate has any jurisdiction in the kingdom of Christ to control in any way the faith and worship of the people. We claim that each separate society of Christians has a right to elect its own pastor and officers, and to manage all its own affairs. These principles are steadily being received among men. The days of bigotry and priestly intolerance, which brought forth the Acts of ' Uniformity' and of ' Supremacy' during the reign of Elizabeth, and the ' Conventicle Act of 10-12 are gone, never to return. We Congregationalists are equally opposed to internal despotism. The supreme human authority in every church is vested by Christ, the only Head of the Church in the membership of that Church. All the members of our fellow- ship rule in all matters, and the pastor and deacons are simply the executive officers of the church, subject to and governed by the will of the members. We think these principles are illustrated in the apostolic account of the first Christian fellowships. We believe these principles will become acknowledged and practised by the Christian Church of the future. Holding these principles, you will see how all-important It is that every member of our Church should be true to Christ. A Congregational Church is nothing without true spiritual life. The ecclesiastical and connexional polity of other denominations may hold them together, but not so with us. In order to exist we must have intelligent, earnest, spiritual members. Without this spiritual activity we must dwindle and die. We are often spoken of as being creedless churches, as having no acknowledged doctrinal standard. The New Testament is our authority. We claim for ourselves and give to others the right to read and judge for themselves what the Bible teaches them to believe and to do. History clearly demonstrates that man written creeds are not necessary in order to the main tenance of purity of life and work for Christ. We read God's word dally for ourselves, and keep our minds open for any fresh light or fuller revelation God may be pleased to give us. We do expect every member of our Church to have faith, living faith in the divine authority and inspiration of the Scriptures, in the saving power of ' Jesus Christ, and in the power of the Holy Ghost, given to quicken and renew our souls, leading to true repentance, producing saving faith, regenerating the soul, and perfecting our salvation. Let us all seek to be worthy of this great liberty." In the evening the rev. gentleman took again the same text, and preached to a very full church on " Congregationalism in the World," sketching the history of the struggle for religious freedom from the times of Queen Elizabeth, in which the Independents have ever taken such a prominent place. He stated that there are at present about 4500 Congregational churches in Great Britain, with sitting accommodation for nearly two millions of persons. In America, 4000 churches and 400,000 members, and in Australasia about 350 churches. He rejoiced to believe that Congregationalism was obtaining a firm hold among all the Christian denounce tions to-day, and quoted Bishop Barry, late Primate of Australia. -who'toMy spoke of the growing spirit of Congre-, 'nationalism in the Church of England. He believed that the Churches were coming closer together, and that Christians were receiving the grand truth of the text"-" One ร .yftffifl^Ia^Wr, even Christ, and all ye are brethren!."
