The VJLC Autumu Meeting. The tbird day of the V.R.C. Autuma Meet ing was brought to a successful conclusion on Saturday last. The weather was intensely warm, and the sun, although obscured for most part of the day, occasionally broke through the clouds, when the fioroeneas of its-, rays wa® keenly felt by those present. Both r were fairly patronised, and before the brat race was rup, there was a good at tendant which was further increased 1;hh day advanced, the stand, particu- 'wfy being well attended. The Governor an I Marchioness of Norinanby. arrived on the course in time to see the run. The Australian Band were again pre sent, and went through a lengthy programme of well-selected airs with their customary skill, and during the interval between each race the lawn was largely patronised. . The committee of management carried out the pro - gramme with; their usual punctuality, and each event was started at the appointed time. The race for the Newmarket Handicap created much interest, and .was won by Hyacinth, a comparative outsider, theproperty of Mr. Pearson. The race for the Town Plate caused some surprise and disappointment. Mr. Phillips, the owner of Pell Mell and Com motion, declared to win with the former, who was made a. great favourite at even money. Commotion, however, went to. the front at the start, and was never headed, winning easily. After the race an unpleasantness occurred between Mr. Phillips and Bang, his trainer. Bang feeling aggrieved at the charge, asked the stewards to investigate the matter. That body declined to act, saying that the case was outside their jurisdiction, but intimated that Bang had his remedy at law to refute the charge. The day was a bad one for the backers of horses, for, with the exception of Duchess, vftio won the last race, the favourites were always beaten ; her victory, however, was a popular one, as the public invariably back Wilson's horses. The following are the particulars Second Nursery Handicap, a sweepstakes of 5 so vs. each, h. ft. with 150 added. For two- year- olds. Seven -furlongs. Mr. a. K.
