Sailing Notes. The annual handicap race for the Dunbar Challenge Cup, presented to the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron by Captain Abbott, of the 8th Hussars, was sailed on Saturday last, under the following conditions : — That the cup shall be won three years iu succession, the R.S.Y.S on each occasion adding £10 for the first yacht, and the entrance fees to the second craft 6aviug her time; and further, that the race shall be open to yachts of less than 15 tous only, under ordinary cruising canvas, no squaresaiis, spinnakers, or balloon-sails of any kind allowed; amateur helmsman and crew, the only paid hand allowed to sail on board being the man in charge of gear, &c.; three yachts at least to start or no race. The previous winners were 1S87, Sirocco ; 1888, no race ; 1889, Iolanthe ; 1890, Sao ; 1891, Iolanthe ; 1892, Thelma; 1893, Archina. The yachts entered for Saturday last, with their respective handicaps, were : — Thelma, yawl (Dr. M'Cormack), scratch; Archina, yawl (Mr. A. A. Griffiths), 12 minutes ; Iolanthe, cutter (Mr. W. A&. Maclardy), 16 minutes : Isea, cutter (Dr. Milford), 20 minutes ; and Assegai, cutter (Mr. P. H. Sullivan), 27 minutes. The course, which covered a distance of . about 29 miles (in a straight line), was from a flying start at 1 p.m. from a line between the starter's boat and H.M.S. Orlando's buoy down to and round a mark to the eastward of Cape Banks (the North Head of Botany), thence back to the finish between a flagboat and the southern end of Fort Denison. In anticipation of a V hard blow' the yachts as entered put in au appearance under snug canvas ; both Thelma and Archina had their topmasts housed, but other wise were under their yawl rig. The Isea, Iolanthe, and Assegai each had a couple of reefs down in their mainsails and carried small jibs. Their topmasts also were either housed or left behind. The wind was strong from about S.S.E., with an ebbiug tide, and the times as the yachts croBBed the line were as follows : — Iolanthe at 1 p.m., Thelma at lh. 0m. 12s., Isea at Ih. 0m. 15s., Archina at lh. 0m. 43s., and Assegai 10 seconds later. Thelma passed Iolanthe off Garden Island, and Archina drew ahead of Isea, and, after a luff with Iolanthe, went by her in a heavy squall. Off Camp Cove the Thelma stowed her mizzen and substituted a smaller jib for the one previously set. The Iolanthe also put a reel in her foresad and set the ' spitfire ' jib. Things were then made snug on each craft before reaching the Heads, where the seas were rolling and topping in a more than playful manner. The breeze, too, appeared to have hardened some what, aud the outlook, more especially for the small yachts, was not at all promising with a thrash of a good 10 miles to windward in such weather. In fact the mark boat did not turn up, and the club steamer Leveret had to act as tho rounding mark. South Reef, was passed as follows : — Thelma at lh. 23m., Archina at lh. 25m., Iolan the at lh. 27m„ Isea at lh. 27m. 30s., and Assegai at lh. 32m. Before the Gap was abeam some of lolanthe's gear came to grief. Her ekipper laid her to for few minutes, and then ran back to port. The Assegai shortly after wards followed suit, this leaving Thelma, Archina, and Isea to fight it out. On they stood for the best . part of an hour, the Thelma being first to -stay, which she did at 2.15 p.m. It was then dearly seen that she had left the Archina, and bad then a substantial lead. The Isea scarcely held her own in the rough water, and when she came on the .port tack must have bean a good two miles behind the Thelma, which appeared to be revelling in the broken water/and almost looking her course. As the yachts got further eputh the wind came more ahead, and they in consequence broke off somewhat. The Thelma soon after came 'about on the starboard stretch, standing off for a couple of miles before throwing roundagain, being at this time to the eastward of Maroubra. Tbe Awtina came in stays just the other side of Coogee, and stood to the east. The Isea getting the wind more to the southward threw round, being then about four miles to the eastward of Bronte, but some distance astern of her opponents. Shortly after the weather runner ported, and for a time it looked as if the mast would go over the side ; but with careful handling she waa brought up iu the wind and kept head-reaching until temporary repairs had been effected. Her mainsail was then partly stowed, and her skipper squared away for the Heads. In the meantime the Thelma was laying her course for Cape Banks. The Archina, to make doubly sure, hung on to the starboard tack somewhat longer than appeared necessary, and in consequence made the mark on a broad reach, and the respective times rouuding the steamer were : — Thelma at 4h. 8m., and Archina at 4h. 25m., the latter being then five minutes out of time for first jplace. Before the wind, the Thelma's mizzen was reset, but ' on the run to South Reef there was scarcely any perceptible difference in their positions. The Thelma, however, in creased her lead before reaching the flagboat, which she passed at 5h. 43m. 20s., the Archina following at 6h. 2m. 45s. Thus the Thelma wins the first prize of £10 and the honour of holding the Dunbar Cup for the season from the Archina by 7 minutes 25 seconds outside her allowance of 12 minutes, the latter securing the second prize of £5 5s. Mr. W. H. Bal lard had charge of the Archina. 'The club steamer Leveret was placed at the disposal of members and friends, of whom a large number were ou board. Mr. O. Bauer, assisted by Mr. S. T. Wilson, carried out the official duties of the day. The maxi mum velocity of wind recorded at the Sydney Obser vatory on Saturday afternoon was 20 miles an hour. The race sailed under the auspices of the Sydney Aniateur Sailing Club ou Saturday last was an important one, it being one of the first under the new style of class measurement by which a time allowance is arranged and number of crew fixed after a calculation affecting length of boat, sail area, and length of course. The course for Saturday was from off Kirribilli round Lightship, Sow and Pigs, Shark Island, boat off Fort Mac quarie, Fort Denison, and back to boat off Fort Macquarie. The following scale shows the measurement and time allowance under the new . rule affecting the boats competing on Saturday : — Bulbul, 25ft. 6in., scratch, 6 hands (F. Woolcott . Waley) ; Varuna, 23ft. 6in., 1 -minute 58 secouds, 6 hands ( W. M. Paul) ; Buttercup, 2lft. 2in. 4 minutes 42 seconds, 5 hands (H. Carpenter) : Naiad, ?19ft. 8in., 6 minutes 30 seconds, 4 hands (Dr. New march) ; Netta, 17ft. 9in., 9 minutes 18 seconds, 4 ha.nds (E. W. Hey wood) ; Ada May, 17ft. 6in., 9 minutes 47 seconds, 4 hands (T. E. Macdonald) ; Sophia, 16ft. 8in., 11 minutes 7 second*, 4 hands (F. Doran) ; Brownie, 16ft. 2in., 12 minutes 12 seconds, 3 hands (J. O. Fairfax) ; Taipo, 15ft. 8in., 12 minutes 57 seconds, 3 hands (W. L. Hunt) ;? Nettle, 15ft. 2in., 14 minutes 8 seconds, 3 hands (C. Paterson). On the signal to start being given, Sophia was first away, followed by Netta, Buttercup, Nettle, Brownie, Varuna, Bulbul, Ada May, Taipo, Naiad. The three lastnamed were late, Ada May being 1 minute 25 seconds, Taipo 3J miuutes, and Naiad 6 minutes late. All lay their course for Bradley's, Buttercup takiug up the lead. Squaring away at the beacon at Bradley's, Buttercup led, with Varuna and Bulbul in close attendance, followed by Netta, Brownie, Sophia, Nettle, Taipo, Ada May, Naiad. Ou the run for the Lightship, Varuna passed Buttercup, and both left Bulbul, which was passed by Netta. Hauling a wind at the ship, Varuna was first, with Buttercup in close quarters, followed by Netta, Bulbul, Sophia, Brownie, Taipo, Ada May, Naiad, and Nettle. Some heavy puffs were felt working up to Shark Island, and Bulbul, beiug the heavier craft, began to over haul those in front of her, whilst some of the smaller craft begau to drop to the rear. Bulbul had taken the lead at the Shark Island buoy, her time rounding being 4h. 11m. 17a. ; Varuna, 4h. 11m. 38s. ; Butter cup, 4h. 11m, 53s. , Netta, 4h. 12m. 41s. ; Taipo, 4h. 15m. 25s. ; Naiad, 4h. 18m. 30s. Brownie, 4h. 18m. 55s. ; Sophia, 4h. 20m. 7s. : Nettle, 4h 24m. 2s. ; Ada May retired. Leading for the flagboat at Fort Mac \- quarie, Varuna again passed Bulbul, and Buttercup also gained on the latter. Taipo also passed Netta, and as they rounded the flagboat the times were : — Varuna, 4h. 32m. 47s. ; Bulbul, 4h. 33m. 3ls. ; -Buttercup, 4h. 33m. 41s. ; Taipo, 4h. 33m. 49s. ; Netta, 4h. 34m. 49s.; Naiad, 4h. 40m. 28s. ; Brownie, 4h. 43m, 9a. ; and Sophia, 4h. 44m. 1 7s. Nettle had retired. In the journey round Fort Denison and back Buttercup passed Bulbul, and Netta passed Taipo ; otherwise the positions remained the same. The times finish ing were : — Varuna, 4h. 42m. 37s. ; Buttercup, 4h. 44m. 3s ; Bulbul, 4h. 44m. 31s. ; Netta, 4h. 45m. 43s. ; Taipo, 4h. 51m. 23s. ; Naiad, 4h. 51m. 49s.; Brownie, 4h. 55m. 8s. ; Sophia, 4h. 56ro. 27s. By time allowance Netta .secures first prize (£4 4s) ; Taipo, second (£2 2s) ; and Buttercup, third (£1 Is) — each being, sailed by its respective owner. .Mr. Harrison again performed the duties of starter and timekeeper. Notwithstanding tho threatening look of the weather, a fair number mustered at Clark Island to ' watch the sport provided by the Syduev Flying Squadron club on Saturday last.' The steamer Lady Manning conveyed the greater number, wliilst the remainder reached there by sailing aud rowiug boats. Taken on the whole, the racing was fairly good. Several of the boats found the wind too severe and came to grief. The boats started from the north-west corner of the island, from whence they proceeded to a flagmark in Taylor Bay, then round Shark Island, and finished at Ciark Island. The prize of £20 was cut up into three of £12, £5, and £3. A special prize was presented on this occasion by Mr. M. Foy to the nearest and best turnout, which was intended to include rig of boat and dress of crew; this prize was awarded to Mr. Dempster's 18-footer Aztec. Sixteen boats had entered, and these were arranged in two heats of eight each,.the first and second boats in each had to meet again in the fiuaL The only absentee was the Cynthia from the first division. The officers of the day were : — Starter, Mr. Morgan ; timekeeper, Mr. Donovan ; and umpire, Mr.Garden. The following is the result of the racing : — First heat : Secret, 22ft. (G. Fletcher), 1J minute, 1 : Nereid 18ft. (W. Golding), 3| minutes, 2. . The other starters being Lady Duff, - 24ft. (W. Fitz henry), scratch ; Young Harry, 24ft. (G. HolmeB, jun.), scratch ; Volunteer, 24ft. (Chris. Webb), scratch ; Ghost, 24ft. (Mark Foy), 2 minutes ; Cynthia, 20ft. (J. Milham), 2$ minutes ; Ethel, 18ft. (S. Hellings), 3} minutes. On the close haul for Shark Island some of the boats found they had too much saiL Lady Duff capsized, Ghost also came to grief, and Ethel retired. This left Nereid, Secret, Young Harry, and Volunteer to battle it out. Secret managed to pass Nereid before finish ing, and Young Harry passing Volunteer was close on Nereid's tuck at the finish, the times being Secret, 4h. 18m. 40s. ; Nereid, 4hi 18m. 59s. ;Young ?Harry, 4h. 19m. 3s. ; Volunteer, 4h. 19m. 29s. Second heat: 1, Esmeralda, 22ft., W. Read, 1$ minute; 2, Ariel, 18ft., G. Ellis, 3J minutes; 3, Aztec, 18ft., S. Dempster, 3£ minutes. The other starters were: Connie, 20ft., J. D. Robinson, 2£ minutes ; ' Bettina, 20ft., W. Atkinson, 3 minutes ; Stella, 18ft., S. Sommerville, 3| minutes ; Cygnet, 18ft., T. Colebrook, sen., 3$ minutes ; Olinda, 18ft., F. Snowdon, 3f minutes. The finishing times being — Esmeralda. 4h. 45m. 25s. ; Arid, 4h. 4dm. 41s. ; Aztec, 4h. 46h. ,25s. ; Stella, 4h. 47m. 52s. ; Bettina, tii 48m. os. ; Connie, 4h. 49m. 22s. Final Heat — 1, Secret (G. Fletcher) ; 2, Nereid (W. Golding); 3, Arid (G. Ellis) ; 4, Aztec (A. Cameron); 5, Esmeralda (W. Read). Owing to a possibility of Esmeralda's being disqualified for only carrying colours on one side of hear sail Aztec was also allowed to start in the .final heat. A very good start was effected. Aztec and Secret set topsails for the run. Arid carrying a squaresail. | Aztec was first to r^S- the fia a mark, dosely fol lowed by Nereid, and Ariel, Secret being a minute behind, and then Esmeralda. In the work to Shark Island Aztec dropped into fourth position, Secret passed Ariel and closed on Nereid. Squaring away at the island buoy Nereid had a lead of 35 seconds from Secret, Ariel being 12 seconds behind Secret, then came Aztec and Esmeralda. Secret added top sail aud jibboom jib, and soon passed INereid. All set jibbcom jibs, Nereid tearing crossing Double Bay. A good race finished as follows : — Secret, 5h. 36m. 2s. ; Nereid, 5h. 36m. 12s. ; Ariel, 5h. 36m. 59s ; Aztec, 5h. 37m. 12s. ; Esmeralda, 5h. 38m. 49s.. The prizes therefore go to Secret (£12), Nereid (£5), and Ariel (£3). The Sydney Dingy Sailing Club had a race for boats 8ft. to lOft. on Saturday afternoon over the usual Shark Island course for prizes of £3 3s and £1 Is, but only the lGft. boats entered, -viz. : — Raceland, Venora, Noel, Viking, Young Clive, and Tam o' Shanter scratch, and Carina 2 minutes. The last-named got her time allowance at the start aud held the lead for a good part of the distance down to the island. ? Raceland 'took first position crossing from Bradley's to the island beacon. Before reaching the beacon Venora having just passed Carina challenged Raceland, and the two passed the beacon side by side, followed by Carina, Young Clive, Noel, and Viking. The Tam o' Shanter capsized before reaching the island. Some smart puffs were felt beating up to the southern buoy, Raceland and Venora with big Bails feeling it most, and the former gave her crew a bath. Young Clive and Noel, snugly rigged, then worked into premier places, Young Cfive squaring away at the buoy, having about three-quarters of a minute lead of Noel, whicn had Venora about a minute and a-half behind her ; then came Carina and Viking. On the run back Venora caught aud passed 'Noel, and rounding the flagboat the -times were: Young Clive, 4h. 19s.-; Venora, 4h. 19iq. 30s. ; Noel, 4h. 19m. 45s. ; Viking, '4h. 23s. ; Carina, 4h. 23m. 5s. The labtnamed capsized at the boat. No alteration in positions took place rounding fort Denison and bade, excepting that the two first boats increased their lead. The finishing times were— Young Clive, 4h. 30m.; Venora, 4h. 30m. 43s. ; Noel, 4h. 32m. 15s. ; aud Viking, 4h. 35m. Young Clive and Venora therefore take the prizes. Mr. S. Curtis was the officer of the day. A general committee meeting of the East Sydney Sailing Club was held at the Temperance Hall on Monday night. The Governor wrote accepting the position of patron of the club. Several donations were received. Prizes won m the last race were paid to Lottie, £6 ; Lady Duff, £2 ; Bohemian, £1.
