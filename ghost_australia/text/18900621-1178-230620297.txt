THE UNEMPLOYED. Utilising Unoccupied Houses. Boarding -houses on tlio wharves and else where, with only tlie sky for a roof, prove too severe for even tlio hardy Sydney unem ployed during tho present severe weather, so tlio houseless and homeless pooplo scok shelter wherever it is available. Un occupied houses have been seen to bo lighted up at intervals at night. The residents put it down to. ghosts, but tlio police, with more nerve and in tho execution of their duty, effected an investi gation, and last night they brought to light four individuals who had utilised 24G Forbes-street, and n house in Tyronc- terrace, Upper Williain- stroet, to their own use and benefits and made thoinsolves quite at home. As they had not obtained tho key. of the front door from the respective owners of the property — Mr. Euenczcr Vickcry and Mr. John M'Elhone — the four men, who followed tho occupation re spectively of a groom, a painter, a laborer, and a cook, were given cold quarters in tho cells, and this morning they were clinrgcd in the Water Police Court with having been found in dwelling-houses for ail unlawful purpose, to wit to Bteal. It was clearly shown that the men had no felonious inten tion, and that thoy were simply sacking a shelter from tlio cold. Mr. Loc, 8.M., looked at the matter in this light, and dis charged the men, with the recommendation to keep away from unoccupied houses in the future.
