She said a young man could choose a horse, but he had not a bit of sense in choosing a wife, and she proposed a committee of four, two women and two men, to put the candidates for matrimony through their catechism to find whether they were fitted for one another. It is surprising what a tendency there is in human nature to regulate affairs of love. li is probable Eve and Adam were spared the interference of other people ; but certain it is that not one of their sons or daughters has ever been in love but other people thought they could regulate the business better than The parties more immediately concerned. Now just let us suppose Mr. Potts's molhodpul in practice. The two lady commissioners wait' on the girl to ask her what she thinks of her young man. Of course, she thinks him all that a young man ought to be, and it is their business to correct her wrong impressions. They enumerate his defects, which in the exercise of their favour ions it was thoirdutyto discus er; and would not there be a scene.- Does the eminent lecturess or any body Scheme think these accusations against the man of her choice would have a bit of chert on the girl, or that if she was a girl of spirit she would not give them a bit of her . mind ? And then for the two men that were to catechise the lover. .' A natural waist or no wife, Mrs. Potts says, should be the motto for every young mind. They should ask him then what does he think of her waist, and he would be sure to say it was a very nice little waist, just the sort he liked. And if they said, " Young man, beware that what is the work of steel and whalebone," does any one think that ninety-nine in the hundred of young men so selected would not influence of them with more or less of warmth, and perhaps exple also, whether they had any business of their own to which they could more profitably apply their attention Nature has her own pleasant, care less, old-fashioned way of lerrnluliiig human hearts, and any attempt to make them go by square and compass will be about as effective as mopping back the tide. # a The groaning and "boo-hooing" to which our New Zealand visitors were treated by thousands of the spectators on the Association Ground on Saturday last show the seamy side of Sydney life. That the incident does not represent the characteristic sentiment of Sydney goes without saying. But that does not remove the stigma of inhospitality and boorishness attaching to such an exhibition over a friendly game between the citizens of different colonies. To me ordinarily constituted mind it does seem incomprehen Bible how such a feeling could be generated in the mind of anyone , as showed itself thus in derision and hatred against a lot of young fellows who were doing their best to maintain " the credit of their native land. One can attribute something to the feelings of people who way have had been on the event, to whom a well- directed kick, or a smart piece of passing, meant so many shillings lost. But the number so influenced roald have formed but a fraction of the yelling thousands, many of whom were at the pains to go down to the wharf at night to see the footballers off, and gave a volley of blues and groans to our departing guests. Can it be that this is a form of patriotism fettered in ungenial and P and that I these yelling ruffians, who seem incapable of form- ing a generous sentiment, are really possessed of a love of country, which makes them dislike and repel the stranger J One can hardly attribute such, an incident to anything else, and yet it seems the reduction of patriotism to a low level We may not fed either honoured or gratified in being associated with such as these in our common love of the city of the " beautiful harbour " But everything in train to nature is IS its own way of showing its name tions JliohoihC whereas, the dog barks and the pig runs, and in each case it is to OG\prL«sion of affection in Ho the creature that bawl out ''to be a stranger 'le five of bride it 'im," or our hoodlums who hiss I out opprobrium on our visitors, mc to be taken as ardent lover of our common country We should be proud of them The item of " Old World Gossip in a recent Shire of the Jin and, refer me to the in first > musical treats provided by the "London County Council is as suggestive as it is interesting This" municipal body has introduced, an era of ht getting innovations!, but in doing so it has only given oppression to thoughts and inspirations that had been long struggling for utterance In establishing liu-tnimeiitul hands to perform in the public p marks in the evenings li is voicing the desire that is everywhere growing to infuse some happiness into the lives of the poor A\ 01 king men and women tired from the days toil crowd the seats and standing room mound no doubt with a genuine enjoyment of the music as seven felt by the habitues of the opera-house or concert-hall Cin nuyoiiG say that this is not as much a municipal duty is sweeping and watering the streets It may be a new departure to re game such a duty, and it may not be consonant, perhaps, with the ancient outlines of the dismal science of municipal policy CGI economy But it is sound policy all the time, in the interests of the health and morals at SA ell as the enjoyment of the people, that would bear imitation in a duel The subject of music in the parks has been urged so often that it is stated, but it is in use of what is every body's business being nobody's business Why, it may be asked, should the City Council of Sydney not take up the matter as a public duty is it has been taken up by the London County Council, and, raising itself to the conception of something higher than woodblocking, endeavour to provide what would bring a world of happiness into the circle of humble life in Sydney A-B-c
