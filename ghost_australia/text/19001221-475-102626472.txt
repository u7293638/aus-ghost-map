WAYS OF LIVINGS NEA.RING THE NORE LIGHT. This article will be limited to the last stretch of the Thames, between the lower reaches and the sea. Some of the most characteristic f futures of this region will be passed in review : the quaint habits and old-world beliefs of its residents, and the tales of comedy and adventure told in its inn parlours or over the cabin stoves of its little craft. The nrst question that naturally occurs is : Where does the Thames end, and the sea begin P This is what the newspapers call a controverted question. The official boundary, it is true, stretches across from Foulness on the northern shore to Shell ness on the Isle of Sheppey. But the dividing line is generally considered among river folk themselves to be marked by the sandbank above which floats the moBt ancient and most famous of- British lightships, the 'Nore Light' Sailors passing that Dutch-built barge on an inward journey have a curious, but impolite, method of their own of saluting the freBh water, which they reckon to have entered at that moment, although as a matter of faot the buoyant river water overlays the dense medium of the bba for miles further out than the Nore. And, seeing that the Thames at thiB point is nearly six miles wide and broaden ing rapidly with every outward mile, one may leave the experts to wrangle over saline proportions and estuarine mollusca and the rest, accepting the verdict of the tailor. Certain it is that the typical ThameB features — the local shipping, river cus toms, river talk and modes *f life— do not extend beyond the Nore. Long before it is reached, indeed, they have begun to ' suffer a sea change.' The men of the 'broken water,' which stretches from a little below Gravesend to the sea, are in many ways unlike their brethren of the higher reaches.' , For one thing, they are far more silent than the Cockneyfield boatmen and lightermen upstream. ' Even the sociable atmosphere of their waterside tavern — the ' Smack Inn,' or the 'Net and Golden Anchor,' or the ' Jolly Billy Boy* — does not tempt them into garrulity. It is told of one of their number that having been upset one chill November night and floating for two hours before he was picked up, his sole comment on being restored to consciousness was the remark, ' Water gets cold o' nights now !' A more curious characteristic of these dwellers by the lower river is their super stition. This is, of counts, true to a greater or less extent of Bailors all the world over; but the men in question, whilst sharing in such widespread beliefs as the efficacy of whistling and scratching the inaBt fora breeze, and the bad weather foretold by a howling dog, have their own looal and peculiar tanoie*. Onn such superstition is that the appearance of a porpoise in the Thu,ui.;s, proceeding up. stream, is a sure sign of a coming storm from seaward. ' It must be a mighty stiff blow if he can't face it I' is their crushing retort to the sceptic. ' Many of the inhabitants of Canvey firmly believe that spirit horses gallop madly about the Island from dusk to midnight, and stoutly affirm that they themselves have often heard the wild hoof-beats of these ghoBtly steeds. Along the marshy Bhores 'on either bank you will find veteran sailors to-day who will confidently assure you that they know, by a peculiar sound the water makes, when a death by drowning ia iniminent. * 'The water keep moanin', moanin'.' ? aid one of these prophets last spring, ' and that show it want someone. I don't reckon if 11 run off shore agen wi'outhim.' But he was wrong : no one was drowned along that coast until next tide, when there were two victims. Another quaint belief, whioh was once common along our coasts, but is now dying fast elsewhere, still survives — at least among the older generation— an the Kentish river flats. This is that the sick felt, if true native born, cannot die until the ebb-tide has begun to run. The ' belief is at least as old as Shakespeare's day; for did not Falstaff die 'just] between twelve and even even at the j turning o' the tide'? And these river folk still say confidently of a sufferer, ' He must wait for the tide.' When their prediction is fulfilled the puzzled doctors talk of 'efforts of will power ' ; when it is falsified the prophets explain that the dead' man, or his father before him, was reared inland. And supeaatitions flourish among the crews of the ketches, oyster-boats, and other small craft of thiB district. As an instance may be mentioned -their dread of a 'dogging 6tar'— one shining near and apparently following thfi ruGOn. This is regarded as ominous of terrible temposts ; and natives of the region in question have been known to refuse to sail from London in a sea-going vessel because of such an apparition in the night heaven*. Ghosts appear to trouble them but little, although a certain small schooner making coasting runs between Gravesend and the Kent and Essex seaboard is always affirmed to be haunted by a former skipper who sprang overboard years ago in a drunken freniy, and was drowned. This shade, according -to the statement of an avowed eye-witness, is by no means terrifying, butmerelj frequents, in harm less and seemingly aimless fashion, the aft companion that was his favourite resort in the fleth. Once he was actually gotf-natured enough to arouse the man at the wheel, who had fallen asleep at his post and in a few seconds would have put the schooner ashore above Thames Haven. The mate of the vessel, however, who being London Drea is sceptical of Uus usetul ghost's existence, suggests that it was the flash ing light from the screw-pile lighthouse at Mucking Flat which awoke the slumberer so opportunely. A strange article of faith prevalent in fihese craft, as perhaps elsewhere, is that it is unlucky to express yourself as ' glad to be alive,', or in any such phrase. As the Essex farmer thought concerning balloons, they regard these expressions as ' farin' bumptiouB ' to the good and evil powers alike, who may take summary vengeance on such presumption. The town-reared skipper of a local sail ing craft recently had a curious lesson in the superstition of the district. On the occasion of his first run from Sheerness in his new command he took on board with him a favourite black cat which had travelled often enough with its master from Blackwall. The wind, which was fresh at the start, died away suddenly and the tide having scarcely turned was too young to servs them appreciably. For an hour they drifted at a snail's pace ; then the breeze f reskened as suddenly as it had died down, and the trip to Greenhithe was completed in comfort. But on reaching there the new skipper found that his sable Thomas had disappeared. Questioning his men, one of them spoke of having 'heard a splash-like' while they lay becalmed; and the cafe master could only conclude that in some inexplicable fashion his pet had fallen overboard or committed snide. Mentioning his loss to a neighbour on his return, the disconsolate skipper was greeted with roars of unsympathetic laughter. ' Why, don't you know that a black cat kills the wind P' he was asked. ' It is largely believed in hereabouts, anyway. No doubt yours was blamed for the calm, and to break the spell poor old puss was weighted round the neck and dropped overside aB an offering of appease ment to the wind- gods.' But there is much besides local super stition to be related of the lower Thames. A familiar sight along the Essex shore of the river is the ' Geordie,' or coal-brig, plying between one or other of the Tyne side collieries and the ThameB. Of these craft the river-siders are said to ' curse the skipper and bless the crew.' For while the latter are stalwart, hardy Northumbrians, such plucky sailors as to extort the praise of our critical Thaine sitea, the shipmasters are the subject of much chaff and .many-' yarns,' tuu point of both modes of criticism being that they are not exactly renowned for either navigation or total abstinence. One Geordie's skipper, homeward bound in ballast, is said to have passed the Mouse lightship on bis port boatn, and proceeded spirituously on his way nortu. Four hours later, when his hazy reckon ing showed the vessel to be off Harwich, an unknown lightship hove in sight to starboard. * Light, aboy I Who on earth 'r you f he gretted the stranger. ' Mouse 1' came an answering shout. ? 'Nother of 'em' eh P' the shipper was heard to mutter. 'Too bad, too bad! Speak to the Trinity House about it time they had a mouse-trap in these parts 1' 11; It was a brother skipper who, when asked by his mate to set a course outward from Gravesend, cheerfully and with hiccoughs told his questioner to 'keep the shore on his port (left) beam until he made Sunderland !' In the intricacies of the Thames channels such advice is about as one countryman's direction of another to a certain hotel : '? Yeon.mun juBt waalk threough Lunnon an' bear a bit to th' roightl' These stories of intoxicated masters recall an incident for which the writer can personally vouch. The skipper of a handsome ' mixed ' (cargo and passenger) boat, running between an East London wharf and the West of England, was terribly addicted to drink. Coming down Thames one afternoon under orders to call at Sheer ness he insisted on taking charge, although in a hopelessly muddled state. The mate, nearly frantic with anxiety, managed now and then t- issue secret orders to the crew, by which more than one imminent disaster was avoided. Thns they made their way down stream till the river widened and the mate began to breathe freely again. Then the captain on the bridge insisted on standing over to the north shore, and when his subordinate remonstrated actually threatened to put him im irons. So, amid the grumblings of the mate and the skipper's fluent oaths, the boat jog ged along to a certain town on that side of the Thames estuary, where more by luck than judgment she brought up with out disaster at the landing stage. Foreseeing serious trouble, the faithful mate wonld have hurried his chief below out of sight; but that officer would not quit his post, and gree.ted the piermaster as follows (omitting only the curses and drunken slurs that punctuated it) : ' Here, mister, what's the meaning of this, eh? Don't try to deny it, sir* (crescendo). 'You've stolen it, sir — you're a common low thief, and I'll have yen pros-prosecuted ' (fortissimo). 'Wot'sthe row?' laconically inquired the much-abused official. ' You villain — yon thieving villain !' screamed the skipper. ' Answer me this instant, sir — what have you done with my Medway P' And in his grief at this robbery of a whole river he burst into tears. That piece of folly cost him his master's certificate ; and nowadays, if you want to enrage the red-faced steward of a certain ' day trip' boat on the Thames, you have only to ask him innocently which side of the river is the Medway.
