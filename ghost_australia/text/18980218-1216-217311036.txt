CORRESPONDENCE- MR 3RAKESPEARE ON THE ALIENS. TO THE EDITOR. Sir,â€”I noticed in - our valuable journal (the MINER), dated February 7, Mr Brakespeare, while sneaking at a pub'ic mettinghell o^er ' The Banner's visionary l,000oz of gold,' he classified the Italians as aliens, or in other wor ;s leveUe 1 them to Asiatics. It was very unkind of Mr 'Brak. speare to make such a ridiculous assertion, indeed he fired a deliberated insult to the sons of an illustrous nitiou, and also he resuscitated the Broad Arrow ghost. As long as the Italians are welcomed to these shores, and as long ss they obey the law and b'enrf with customs of the country, they are entitled to respect and not to be insulted a la Bra fees-erian. Probably when the gentleman made the assertion he was either laboring under a racial antipathy or patriotic eithusiasm. Hoping, Mr Editor, as fairplay you will give this publicity. Redhill, February 11,1898. JAMES BALZ$.NO.
