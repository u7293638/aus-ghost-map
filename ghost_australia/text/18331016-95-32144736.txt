THE WEATHER ! The wheat fields are giving up the ghost every day. Every twenty four hours the present dronght destroys an indefinite num- ber of acres of wheat. Even the barley begins to be in danger. We recommend the Settlers to plant a double quantity of maize this year. Our merchants ought to have sent a month ago for two or three cargoes of wheat and rice. The wheats at Bong Bong in Argyle still holds out ; but that beyond seems irrecover- able. The vast downs (very high hills some rocky but without a tree) of aManeara, beyond Limestone Plains, in Argyle, are a desert,-- not a blade of grass on them. The cattle and sheep are in the scubs and look well; generally fat. Where they get their fat from appears to the traveller surprising, as the country through which the high road passes, seem destitute both of grass and water. We advise all corn on the banks of rivers and ponds, to be regu- larly watered with the watering pot, 'till rain come. We are happy to hear, that the preach- ing of the Rev. Mr. Jarrat has attracted so large a congregation at the Independent Chapel, as to render a gallery necessary. The people. of this Colony are like the people of other countries ; they have a taste for good preaching, as well as for other intellectual enjoyments ; and when they can obtain it, are willing to pay for it. It has not been the people who have been to blame, but the preachers of the Colony ; scarcely any of whom have due talents for the profession they have taken up. Good preaching requires not only piety, but a sound judgtnent, and a per- suasive eloquence ; such as our Saviour and the Apostles used. Any man may preach, but who can preach with effect ?
