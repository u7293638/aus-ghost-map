HOW NEW YORKERS AMUSE THEMSELVES. Telegraphing on March 27 the New York correspondent of a London paper says: â€” Miss Anna Constable entertained last night the One Hundred Club, and many people desired to obtain invitation's to the affair, which was styled a 'ghost party,' and in all its arrangements was decidedly unique. Each spirit was announced as it etntered from a dark room into a larger enclosure under the full glare of a calcium light. Each, in turn, was led across the Styx. There was a ianlare trom the orchestra at every -entrance. A '''witches' ' dance was executed by the Misses Shippen, Miss Georgie Wilmerding, Miss Margaret Stimson, Miss Georgie Kinsley, Mrs.- Arthur Cumnock, and Miss Ethel Hitchcock. Some Cos tumes worn by Uhe 'spirits' were arranged in most artistic fashion. For instance, Miss Ruth Lawrence, who represented the Ruling Spirit of Gold, wore a gown repre eniting the precious metal in its various forms. It was made of white crepe, to suggest the snows of Alaska, with a wide band of bullion, and around the hem of the skirt was a mass of golden coins. The belt band was of bullion, and t'he front and back of the waist were covered with gold coins. The coiffure was powdered with gold dust, while nuggets of gold were pinned in it. Miss Breese; as the Spirit of iflie Blizzard, was in white and crystal, and Miss Constable represented the Spirit of Wasted Hours. When it came to the matter of slipper the ghosts and spirits evinced keen appetites.
