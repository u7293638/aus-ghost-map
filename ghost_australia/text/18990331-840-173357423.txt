ONE ON "THE JUDGE." Roy Bean, tlio high judge of the courts of Langtrv, where justice is dished out to the living and dead alike in Judge Bean's own novel and distinctive way, was in San An- tonio last week, on the occasion of which visit ho was made the victim of a cruel practical joke, says the San Antonio "'Ex press. " He met a drummer at Lhe hotel, who said lie had just come from Lantrtry. " Did you sec my bear ? How is liogetting along V" was the justice's first question. Judge Bean's" bear throughout West Texas stands second in fume to the judge himself. The animal was chained to a trco in the rear- of the judge's beer saloon, and in its day drank mauy a bottle of berr at a coat of 25c per bottle, to the edification of the wayfarer who' was compelled to spend a few hours in Judge llcuo's judicial district. " Didn't you hear of it 7" asked tho drum mer. " Tho bear died last night." The dummcr hud an old score to wipe out at Uuy Bean's expense, and lie succeeded in convincing Iho judge that his bear was dead. Roy Bran lost no timo in making for the telegraph office, where ho penned these in structions: " Skin tho bear, and express the skin to me at once." To this ho attached his signature, which is the law in Langtry. Bean a man nttbo saloon promptly killed tlio bear and expressed tho skin, and in the loiter that accompanied tho fur was this note: ''We linted to kill the bear, and he hated to die. Ittook three shots before he gave up tho ghost. Wears now smoking tho baoons." Whon Roy Bean received tho message he broke throe chairs and then set out in quest of tho (hummer. Tho offender is raid to bo conducting earnest diplomatic segotiattens by mail with Tho Law of West Texas. "
