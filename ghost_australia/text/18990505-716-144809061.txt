cawwell at Springfield. \- ;fljnffi's tbe *pot. Look around you. Above on the height ' Lay the Hessians encamped. By the church \- . on tbe right , .. Stood the gaunt Jersey farmers. And here ran s wall — Ton may dig anywnere ana you wm iuru up a ball. Sothing more. Grasses spring, waters run, flowers blow ? Pretty much as they did ninety-three years ago. Nothing more did I say ? Stay one moment ; vou've heard Of Caldwell, the parson who once preached the word Down at Springfield? What! No? Come, that's bed. Why he had All the. Jerseys aflame. And they gave him the name Of the ' rebel high priest.' He stnok in their gorge, For be loved the Lord God— and he hated King George 1 He had cause, you might say, when the Hes sians that day Marched up with Enyphausen, they stopped oq their way At the ' Farms,' where his wife, with a child in her arms, Sat alone in the house. How it happened none knew But God— and one of the hireling crew : Who fired the shot. Enough 1 There she lay, . : And Caldwell, the chaplain, her husband, away ! Did he preach— did he pray ? Think of him, as you stand By the eld church to-day ; think of him and that band 0! military cowboys 1 See the smoke and the heat O! that reckless advance — of that straggling retreat 1 Keep the ghost of that wife foully slain in your view — And what could you — what should yon, what would you do ? Wby , just what he did 1 They were left in the lurch, . For want of more wadding. He ran to the church, Broke the door, stripped the pews, and dashed out in the road With his arms full of bymn-books and threw down his load At their feet ! Then above all the shouting and shots Bang his voice : ' Put Watts into 'em, boys; give 'em Watts.' And they did. That is all. Grasses spring, flowers blow, Pretty much ss they did ninety-three years ago; You may dig anywhere and you'll turn up B ball. But not always & hero like this — and th&t; 8 all. Beet Habte.
