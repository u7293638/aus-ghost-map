ECHOES OF MELBOURNE. [By TIE GHOST.] lThe poet tlls us that "Spring would be blut sorry weather if we had nothing' else but spring." Unalloyed bliss is apt to breed satiety, and the dull monotony of a dead calm is- known to all who have ex perienced its long drawn out weariness. And just atlpresent the sometimes troubled sea of politics is unruffled by even the faintest zephyr.. The Houses will not. meet for,it.leiistAix months, and even then will be somewhat in the plight of the "poor man from Manchesster, vho has nb'work to do." The. business of the country is now left entirely'to the l'anagement. of: teli per manent heads of the various departments, Ministers.dropping into their offices for"an hou r r to duringtlie week to sign docu ments rci?iring their autograph, and hold iing an Executive and Cabinet Council occas ionally, just to let tilh publie know that "Hel{r Majesty's Government" is not a myth, and perhaps to reconcile it to their conscience--if indeed politicians' have any. -that they are not' obtaining their salaries under false pretences. There are, as a matter of couise, a lot of people! whlo think and say thadt it would perhaps be as well if Ministers would dbvote a por 'tlion of the time, which' for lack-of employ-' ment must hang heavily on their hands, to thoroughly preparing the measures it is intended' to submit to'Parliament"during the next siession, instead of flinging them! in a state of unpreparedness at the heads of honourable members, as?'is the present' custom with governments. And there are: discontented gruimblers who. aver .thlt =lie present is a favourable opportunity .for! letting, the country know the "saubstitute ": for abolished tolls,whlich one of the present Ministers, boasted le could provide in' twenty-four, hours; but which, strangely enough, in the. face of this assertion has, after an interval of nearly twice twenty-. four months, n6t yet been provided. But these growlers are on a.par with those who' cry.out for.a Mining..on Private Property Bill,',vheiewith to . enliven the staple in dustry of the colony, now in a some what drooping condition ; and being, in a- minority, composed of the " outs,."': and those who ,follow the flag of the Opposition, are, in the eyes of Mr. Serviceand his colleagues, of:compara tively small account. -. And then, did not the Premier on assuming office distinctly announee that lie intended carefully. to ,avoid., touching.' "burning" questions? Controversial discussions are. "not in his line,'"'and the Coalition Ministry have' evidently adopted the motto of "peace at' any price." This actuating motive is. plainly appar ent in- the selection of the gentlemen who are to .fill the positions of Commissioners under the Civil Service and Railways Man agement Bills. At lengtli the choice of the Government has been made.: And if there is not much to say. agaist the appoint-' ments, there is quite as little to say in` their favour. They all belong in a greater orless degreeo--withs the sole exception''of Mr. Ford-to' the old school of officials. They ,have become.. fossilized: in :the service, and are of . the genus and, family;, of the" Tito Barnacle... The feeling of the public on the names Qf the selected .becoming known- was' one of: disappointment. .The.e hope was. generally entertained thast i-o.e new blood "I: ibhild; have been infused into the effetd system of. piesedt officialdom; and that hope' las been dispelled. Figs do not grow on.thorns one' whit mcore .now than in 'the olden'days ; acnd that any inmprovemient on a system in perpetuating which the majority of the Commissioners have grown'grey will.follow' their :appointmenti is more than im probable . Mr. Kerfordis' well and:has resumed the duties of his office, thlus'disappointing a' number of aspirants for political fame, and a host of attorneys-general expectant. The lionouriablo gentleman has once nol.e shown' liow true'is the iav?ei urnt of both his friends and his enemies that one never can tell which side lie is about' to take iintil after, the event:' On the occasion of his recent' illness it' wai sulpposed Mi. KeI'ferd in-' tended crossing the Styx and joining "thec gireat majority." Faithful to his repu-; tation, lie, did' not do what was expected.! Death has, however, claiined: a victim in Jardine Smith, wlio'for years has "looked' down" upon Parliament, from his vantage' ground'in the reporters' gallery' of; the Council and Assembly. Among his private friends lie was known as 'ia right good. foellow," and by piressmien generally as a: prolific and versatile 'writer. Somie of the; most brilliant contribditions to Peach are' his, and lie can also lay claim to some of: the most ponderous "leaders" in the chief Melbourne morning journal. ' In the pride of his manhood lie has been taken from our midst: To his articles the present coalition Government owes its existence, and if, as alleged, " he killed Berryism " lie most assuredly has shown himself a true friend to'Mr. Berry, whose faults hl has palliated, and whose good points he has brought pro mi:inently out. Regret for his untimely decease will extend far beyond the limited circle of newspaper writers to wlhom hlie wds best known. Of Jardine Smitli it ?ay with truth be said, "He did the State good service ju lis day."' :"Victoria- has' been visited by one of thI plagues jof Egypt-neoitheri Baron de Lesseps nor El Maddi, lot me hasten to pay, but, a real invasion of locusts 'or grass-. hoppois.
