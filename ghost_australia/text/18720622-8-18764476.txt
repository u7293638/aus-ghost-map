CHAPTER III. THE HKIOHT. Richard Dover la) for du) s wavering between life and death , his faithful Bister watched unturingl) be- side him, and upon the tenth day after the cruel assault, there occurred a decided change for the better Withinjinother week the young man was so far recovered as to be able to leave his bed and walk about his room But Dick Dover, the merry, talkative, adven- turous ) outh of former times was gone, and m his place was a sullen morose man, whose brain seemed clouded and whose reason was no longer under his control 1 Poor Nell) I Here waa trouble indeed, and only the consciousness that she viust not give up to the despair which assailed her, enabled her to shake it off and take up this new burden. The emigrants, without exception, proved kind and helpful, and the society and sympathy of these un- polished, but good-hearted people, proved a comfort inexpressible to the lovely and grief-stricken gul Among these pioneers, was a family named Chap- man, whose share of the Dover Purchase included the cabin and a hundred acres of land surrounding it. The family consisted of husband and wife and three children. A nephew of Mr Chapman bad come West with them r but at present, was staying at the river m company with one or two other >oung men, acting as herdsmen to the cattle left there to pasture 3Irs Chapman seemed to be a warm-hearted, motherl) soul, strong of limb, and free of speech, who managed her husband and children with but feeble resistance upon their parta, although it was seldom they seemed to realize but that they were acting out their own sweet wills An ordinary woman, placed m Mr" Chapman's cir- cumstances, would have fretted and worried herself half to death, at rinding that the snug little homo she had expected to take instant possession of, must be left, for an indefinite period, to the occupaucj of its former owners True, she had been lmng in wagons and camps for weary weeks, and longed for the comforts and comemtucesof house aud home, "But," she said, ' she was not the woman to turn the»e poor unfortunate creatures out-o'-doors" Whv, law me'" she exclaimed, almost índig nantl), when some one quebttoned her about it, " i\ hat on earth can thev do 5 Ilini sick and out of his head, and his inone) all robbed awaj from him, and her, poor thing-near about heart broke, au looking like a ghost No, let 'em stay where the) be 'LUI they can do better Chapman has to build a .table any how, an' I just told him to git it up quick as he could, an' wed go into it awhile, till things take a turn, and till that's done we can kind o' camp out as we did when we was on the move- though Miss Dover insists on m) dom' m) cookm' and bakiu' in her kitchen-an' the children has a bed put up for emin the loft Law' well git along, but what s ever to become of them," and good Urs. Chapman bustled on to attend to some one of her numerous duties The weeks wore on The emigrants busied them- selves ia building cabins, m cutting the luxuriant praine-grass, and making their winter's stock of bay and ni breaking up the soil to lay fallow, m readiness for the next spring's crops Richard Dover's bodily health and strength in- creased until he seemed to have entirely recovered from the effects of his injuries, but his mind seemed to be at most times almost a blank, although occa sion all) he became excited, and restless, and very rartl) talkative Nell), after much thought, had concluded to sell at the settlement her own and her brother's horse, then: wagon, and a few other things of less value, and with the money thus obtained to endeavour to reach some relatnes in her natne State Her pride revolted at the thought of returning to them, poor and helpless, and with the additional charge of her unfortunate brother, but she knew not what other course to take, and she hoped that the skill and ex- perience of a celebrated pb)sician near her des- tination might be tbe means of restoring Dicks "lhere are many things which I can find to do when once there I do not intend to remain a dead weight upon any one's hands, I shall work, and if poor Dick recovers, we will get on together without trouble," she said to Urs. Chapman as they sat to- gether one pleasant ev ening, within the shelter of the little porch, conversing m low tones upon the expediency of an early departure " Amt you afraid you'll find your brother trouble- some to manage on the wa) p I declare, I bate to have you go alone," said Mrs Chapman Ob, no, 1 m not afraid. If we once get safely away, and on a homeward-bound boat, I shall feel secure enough " " But 1 don't like the idea of your undertaking to sell the horses and waggon yourself Hadn t you better let Mr Chapman take em over to the settle- ment and sell'em for jouP He s bein* a man, and a good hand at a bargain too, and con, most likel), get as much agin for em as you could " ho, nof I can't think of such a thing I-" "Whv, Miss Do^er, I hope )ou ain't afraid to trust Amos Chapman with jour money, be je'" in- terrupted Mrs Chapman, rather indignantly " Oh, no 1 Not that at all," cried Nell) " But I have a sort of terror-a dread that any one going from here for us might meet with misfortunes-you know how it has been with us of late, and I have grown morbid, I suppose " " Well, if ) ou think ) ou can manage it for yourself of courbe j ou've a right to try, bnt I think j ou bad better have him, or somebody else, go v\ ith you, and see that >ou get started right anyhow " " If Mr. Chapman can go with us to the river, I shall be very glad, indeed And now, I want to ask Sou a question, and I hope it will not offend you o you think there is any one among the men who came here when ¿ou did, who could have assailed and robbed Dick p * Why, how ) ou talk ' No, indeed ! Why they're all good honest, hard-working men Been friends and neighbours of ours for years and years What made you ever thmk of such a thing 9 " I will tell you Poor Dick often sits and talks to I lmself now, often in such low tones that I can not understand him, but several times I have heard him say, ' I don t see where he can be-'twas one of them-but perhaps he has gone to the mines -said he was going,' or something to that effect. I also notice that he keeps a sort of watch when any of the men come about here, as if he expected to see some one particular person, and, one night about two weeks ago, you remember, late m the evening, half-a-dozen men rode over here to consult Mr Chapman about some matter, and they were talking out there b) the waggon, when one of them laughed. Well, Dick was lying on the bed apparently asleep, but, on hearing that laugh he jumped up m a state of great excitement, and muttered to himself, * that xs he ' that ish«p and started toward the door Just then the whole party clattered off througri tho darkness, and Dick returned to his bed without sa) ing another word that I could understand " It was well that the shades of evening concealed the expression of Mrs Chapman's face as she lis- tened to this explanation of Nelly But, as it was, the young girl only noticed that her friend became unusually silent, and soon bade her a curt good- night and went her way " I have offended her," thought Nelly, aa with a wear) sigh, she entered the cabin and prepared to retire for the night. But, the next morning, Mrs. Chapman's greeting was as kindly as ever, and, after breakfast, she came to Nelly to ask, as she said, " a great favor " If there's an) thing I can do for j ou I shall be glad of the opportunity to make some return for the many kindnesses you haveshownme 1" exclaimed Nelly, earnestly " Law ! what have J ever done But, my arrend is this I've took a notion to go over to where they're a herding the cattle. I want Chapman to go with me, or like as dot I'll git lost on the prairie, so, if you'll look after the children to day, and give them their dainers, 111 be ever so much obliged to)e" Of course I will, and be glad to do it Don't let let any uneasiness concerning them detract from ) our pleasuroto-da). I almstenvy you jour nde over the prairie, the day is delightful !" " I'm not a-goin' for pleasure," said Mrs Chapman, with a deep-drawn sigh, and she hastily left the room, and was soon seen, habited in a black calido riding skirt and sun-bonnet, mounted upon a sleek coated young horse, going across the grassy plain at a brisk gallop Now that Nelly Dover had fully determined upon the course to pursue, she resolved to lose no time in putting her plans, in execution According!) she began at once to make preparations for the journey before her. She felt that she was no longer in her own home, and that she was seriously discommoding the land woman who relinquished the cabin to her use. And, as she bad once before got everything ready for the journey, there was but little prepara- tion necessary, and that little she would do immedi- ately The three children left to her care, were delighted to be allowed to assist her, and when she rewarded their services with various trinkets brought to light in the "packing up" process, their joy was unbounded. A Richard too, seemed more like his old self upon this day than usual, so much BO, that a delicious hope sprang into lifo in Nelly's heart, that his ter- rible affliction might soon wear away She deter- mined to throw off her cares, and make a special effort to amuse mm, and to entertain her little guests. Therefore she chatted, and laughed, and sang as she worked, and as noon approached, abe declared her intention to get up a dinner that should honor the occasion " lou must know that I don't entertain company very often/ she said, playfully, to Carne Chapman, a sprightly little girl of ten, or thereabouts, " and I must really rrj to get up something nice," The children were quite willing that " something nice" should be got up for their benefit, and entered into the spirit of the thing with great ardour. " I am going to trub the table- with flowers, and Carrie may go into the yard with tina- basket and out all the pretty ones she can ^iDd," said Ne|ly< 3 " Johnny an* me snU «pick up^chips-we always does for mother," said the other little girl, and the two children went out to their task. \nd Nellv, t j mg on the Tjig apron w'nch always did dutv when she had baking to do went out into the kitchen, and TV as soon detp into the mysteries of pastry and pudding-, custards and cream-biscuits. Tims, more than an hour passed awn) , the children carne in, und, willi their little ' lundenng blip," the table was set and dul\ decorated, the tall old china vase again did duty as a centre-piece, and soon all the good things from tho kitchen were placed upon tbt table, a high-Uiair improvised for little Johnny, and the children all propprlv seated at the table Then iSelly stepped to the door to summon Didk, whom she had lost seen reclining at full length under tho shade of tho overhanging vines about the porch But he was not there 1 She cnlltd him, but he did not appear. She searched for bim, but he could not be found. Running into the house after a rapid exploration of the premises, she told the children to help them- selves to what the/ wanted, as her brother was ab- sent and she must go immediately to find him, after making them promise faithfully not to leave the house during her absence, and arranging with the oldest to hang a signal out of the chamber window if her brother should make his appearance before I her own return, she hastened across the prairie to the 1 nearest cabin When she arrived there, breathless I and ready to burst into tears of alarm and excite- ment, she could scarcely restrain her emotion suffi- ciently to tell her story, but, as soon as it was under [ stood, tho men of the house offered to go immediately in search of the missing man, and to gather the full force of the neighbourhood to assist theni "Bbo, now! don't cn," said the father of the family, " ef it hain't-been no longer'n \ou say sense he started off, well find him m less than no time 1" | And, with this consoling assurance they went out to get their horses, and Nelly, with quick steps, turned toward home, thinking that, perhaps, her brother might be there , but, as she glanced ever and anon toward the little window in ilia cabin gable, no signal appeared, and when alie reached the place she found no one but the three children ehe had left The neighbours searched all through the long after- noon, and again the next da), but Richard Dover co aid not be found. The only trace of him discovered was that he had been where his horse was tethered on the prairie, and had ridden the animal away. (Tobe èoïitmued)
