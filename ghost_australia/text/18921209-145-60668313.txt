An Ode To The Modern Walts, 'Tis a kind of mild gyration, 'Tis the "rMilitary Valtz ;" A sort of Ilrdchflflbre, Iluixed With someo very suidden halts, As your partner, vainly striving To revolve, is forced to stop ; And your manly arm is aohing, And you're nearly fit to drop; Wliilo the moments are so melting, And you can't uceomlt at ail, For the pioderous perslstIideo Of the "Fairy" of the ball Her weight is but a trifle, If sheo steps lpoln the ?eilo; Sho looks so like ia Zephyr Tlhat you crowd on every sail' With It feeling of elation, With t consciousness of power, Yougo, for twenty yards at least, At forty knots au hour;. But a deadly drag is on you, And, alas! your dreamn is falso, For you find you have to wrestle "With tIh "Military Waltz !" This Waltz, which isn't Waltzing, But it dreary dull paride Of llltoaton-like figullrls, Looking soowllhat " ready-mnad " As they Zig-ang, slideo and lhutlle, Turn rounld twice, ntld then appear Asi if they "really? had to stop," ilhey felt "so vefy queer." sVhere Is the old-t io0 waltzingi?
