Ghosts ongChristznas Eve. 'Wbitten fob the Christmas Wed;.) Ghosts of a burled past 1 Why havo you como to-night 1 Go I visit fairer scenes, Hearts that aro free and light ; For mine, alas 1 is sad and sore, For tho love and joy that can como no more. Ghost of a buried lovo I Love of the long ago, Cold is my withered heart, Cold ns tho drif ting snow ; That with the willow branches wave, In other climes above its grave. Spirits ; who seem to mo Uko Friends I'vo loved nnd loat ; Who now to this dark, drenry earth From splritlandhuvc eross'd, I.oved memories ; my spirit holds you dear, The one groen spot within a desert drear. Ghosts of tho future, say To me whntahall it bring. Will ponce nnd joy bo borne, Or grief ; upon its wing ! Will shadows gather in the evening^ight, And denper grow with shades of coming night 1 Ghost of a wasted life 1 Como in the waning light. Haunts with a nameless dread Like voices in thp night. Life's hours like precious pearls I sec, Lost, one by one, in eternity 1 Angela of Christinas Eve : Hay ia there lusting bliss, For troubled weary souls, In such n world ns this .' Tell me, then lice away nt morn, Sing out the joyful strains A Prince of peace is borne. Irishwoman. Bowen Hills.
