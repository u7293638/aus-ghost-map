The Deserted Ho >se. llauk from the road, up the old path, Unmindful of harvest and aftermath, With empty casements, drear and gray, The house stands, facing down the boy And either side the slanting gate The faithful sentinel lilacs wait. Deep tangling vines with close embrace The porch's fluted columns trace, Ami busy swallows dart and rail From out the rain stained, sagging wall— And longing, watching, desolate, The faithful sentinel lilacs wait.

Is it for this, when the hour grows late, The faithful sentinel lilacs wait? —Buslcn Evening Transcript.
