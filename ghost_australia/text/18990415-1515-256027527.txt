A Recognition. Like one sans lawful visible, who has no fixed abode, Was the derelict I lately met along the Mount's Bay-road, Dusty and gaunt, and eager to fill an aching void Witli a seedy look that stamped him as one of the unemployed. He caught my eye, his lean cheek fl"shed, he turned his gaze upon The boats that lay at anchor on the bosom of the Swan, And would have passed, but God forbid that I should have it so, Who knew this man with his big, soft heart, when flush, three years ago. He'd the devil's luck when I saw him then, in H brand new goldfield's town With quite an army of parasites,tjust knocking his money down, I recall the 6mile he gave me, when I told him to get aw«y, For it pleased him better to " blue it" there, so he decided to stay. He managed to raise the ghost of a smile, as he took my outstretched hand, While he stood like a guilty schoolboy expecting a reprimand, And then came a twinkle in the eye beneath his shocking bad hat, That told me he had heaps of Hope, and he mostly lived on that. I'm just up from Fremantle, I hope you recognise The reason why I travel thus, I'm fond of exercise; Besides, I've a Gov'ment billet, and in order to carry out The multifarious duties I have to get about." Then [ cried, " I'm glad I've met you, my brave philosopher, But what is the (jov'ment billet to which you thus refer ?" He replied as he gazed at the Dep6t, under Mount Eliza'6 brow, " Sub-Inspector of Public Buildings, I'm inspecting that one now." —D.P., Perth.
