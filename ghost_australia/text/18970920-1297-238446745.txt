DRAMATIC AND MUSICAL RECITAL. On Saturday night at the Y.M.C.A., Pitt-street, Mr. Parker Lewis and Miss "Winifred Stratton, R.A.M., collaborated in a musical and dramatic entertainment, in aid of the Queen Victoria Con- sumptives' Home Fund. Mr. Parker Lewis chose Dickens' "Christmas Carol" for his portion, divid ing it up into five sections â€” "Marley's Ghost," "Fezziwig's Ball," "Eob Cratebitt's Christmas Dinner," "Poor Tiny Tim," and Scrooge Re claimed by Christmas." His enunciation was clear and telling, the voice well modulated, and the whole presentation highly dramatic. Not withstanding tho continued strain upon his vocal powers, he was as forceful in the concluding sketch as in the opening. Miss Winifred Stratton adds to an accomplished pianoforte style a strong contralto voice. She appeared in both roles. Iler first contribution was . Beethoven's Moon light Sonata, which she played with con siderable feeling; the "Black Knight" (Ar thur O'Leary) was her other instrumental piece. In addition to these she sang "The Gift of Rest" (Cowen), for which an encore was al lowed, and "Will he come" (Sullivan).
