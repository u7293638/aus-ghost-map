Left Undone. It Isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing yon've left undone, Which gives yuu a bit of a heartache At the setting of the snn. The tender word forgotten, The letter yon did not write, The flower yon might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The Btone yon might have lifted Out of a brother’s way. The bit of heartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say ; The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone, That you had no time nor thought foir, With troubles enough of your own. The little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind ; Thoae chances to be angels Which every mortal finds— They come in night and silence— Each chili, reproaohful wrath— When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it’s not the thing yon do, dear, It’s the thing you leaveTnndone, Whioh gives you the bit of heartache At the setting of the sun.
