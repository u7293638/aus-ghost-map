Tfflfm^iE^mgT^nte DERBY DAY: i [ByTelejnraDb,l - - IFrom our own RennrtAr I Melbourne. November!. That the popularity of the V.R.C. Spfinj Meeting has not yet reached ita height was convincingly proved on Saturday, when, not withstanding the inclemency of the weather. tne attendance was tne largest ever Known at Flemington on a Derby Day. The pro minence obtained to the Caaifield Cup during the last few yeirs may have curtailed the interest in the Melbourne Cup from a speculative point of view, buttwith the public the V.R.C. Spring Meeting is a greater attraction than ever, and upwards of 40,000 people braved the rain on Saturday to witness what promised to be the most interesting Derby yeb decided. After coming down steadily during the greater part of the night the rain ceased about 8 o'clock in the morning, and there seemed a chance of a fine afternoon, bnt before 11 o'clock it set in wet again, and although the fall was light there was no cassa tion until just before the MaribyrnonK Plate was tun. Under these circumstances a limited attendance was looked for, but early visitors to the course found the Stand and paddock fairly filled, and before the first race started the hill and flat were alive with people. The discomforts of weather did not deter a great number of ladies from honouring the occap ion, and when the rain ceased there was the usual promenading in front of the Stand and on the Lawn, but very few ladies patronised the saddling portion of the paddock, which constant traffic had reduced to a very sloppy state. The Government House party, which was a large one and included Sir William Robinson, arrived in time to witness the first race, and stayed until Nordenfeldt had triumphantly vindicated the public opinion as to his merits by winning the Darby, Favourites were wonderfullly successful, Albanus being the only outsider that won during the afternoon, and the bookmakers have never had a worse day, though when Navigator won the Derby and Narina the Maribyrnong Plate the balancing of accounts was much in favour of backers. From first to last the racing was worthy of Flemington, aud a grander struggb than that between Nordenfeldt and First Chester has never been witnessed. No one knew what had won until the Judge gave bis decision, and the suspense was prolonged through' Mr, Wakely making a mistake and putting up Uralla's number instead . of Nordenfeldf s. Many telegraphiste not well acquainted with the horses, seeing No. 10 hoisted, wired Uralla away as the winner before the Judge corrected his blunder by exhibiting No. 3. A feature in the pro ceedings was the reappearance of Mr. George Watson with the Starter's flag, and the veteran, who adorned the shelter of an over coat, was loudly cheered as he cauterel through the rain to start the horses in the Melbourne Stakes. There were eleven withdrawals from the Melbourne Stakes, leaving eight runners, and when Ringmaster was known to be a starter he was quickly made a favourite, Sheet Anchor, Honeydew, and Mozart all received support; but Trenton was in more demand than any of those, and at the finish he touched 5 to 2, getting off well. Robertson kept the New Zealander moving all the way, and when Sheet Anchor took up the running at the homo turn Trenton, .and Ringmaster were the only others left with a chance, and though Robertson seemed to be at work on Trenton below the distance the son of Musket woo very easily in the last 100 yards, There was a rush to Bee how Trenton pulled up, and opinions differed very much as to whether his condition is likely to stand him to the end of a severe race like the Melbourne Cap. A very moderate field contested the Hotham Handicap, and after Comet had been made favourite at 3tol he receded to the Bame price as Lesbia. Agitation cut out the work for some distance, but half a mile from home Signer went to the front and led into the Btraight. Here the black was passed by Mentmore and Lesbia, and the mare won a fine race by about half a length, with Signor, Comet, and Genoa very close up. -The friends of Duration were very confident about him winning the Hurdle Rase, and consequently The Agent's backers had only to lay 6 to 4 on the little chesnnt. Duration put his chance out by hitting a hurdle at the back of the course, aud when The Agent entered the straight firat the race seemed all over, but Gasalier stuck to him most per sistently, and many thought the chesnut had to put his. best leg foremost to get home by a length from Mr, Pearson's mare, Tluee : quarters of an hour elapsed between thiB race and the Maribyrnong Plate, and as the rain had stopped the saddling paddock was well attended. The corner where Hales and ElliB were standing with Mr. White's blue Mid- white colours on was thronged with people anxious to get a look at the beautiful little Acme, and the- filly was bo well liked that she shortened to 2 to 1 before the flacj fell. Blairgowrie and Chesham wers both very much admired, though the former did not look as fit as Acme. The lot were very well behaved at the post, and after one or two partial breakaways the flag went down, and as the sixteen came charging up the Btraight it was seen that Maddelina was dis tinctly the first to get away, and Bhe led over the tan crossing. Before half the distance, however, was gone Hales let Acme out, and shooting to the front sne came on to the course proper with such a lead that the race was clearly seen to be all over. Blairgowrie and Louise Berta followed Acme past the distance, but at the finish Maddelina, who had lost b-;r place through running unkindly, came again under the whip, and passing Blair gowrie and Louise Berta secured the £200 attached to second place. Acme won, as easily as did Palmyra in 1879, and with this filly and Phillip Augustus Mr. White should sweep off all the good two-year-old races thia season. Maddelina's forward running was a surprise to the stable, aa she cut up .very badly in a trial with Trojan on Tuesday, and apparently she will only race for Weasel The time f was very fast considering the state of the course. The Selling Race provided a very close finish, and then attention was turned to the Derby, which was set down for half an hour later than usuaL The with drawal of Ringmaster left eight to do battle, The different candidates were eagerly scanned when unclothed, and they were generally pronounced the best-looking lot ever saddled for the Derbv. Isonomv. who was tint ia rights in the centre paddock, was greatly liked, and so was Thunderbolt, though both would probably have been the better for a rousing gallop or two. Nordenfeldt was the fittest of them all, and his backers were not sorry to see Ellis substituted for Hales at the last moment, owing to the stable preference for Uralla. Mr. White and his friends super intended the saddling of the filly, while the colt walked about comparatively neg lected, and the attention paid to Uralla. caused people to go and back her. DunloD was very nervous, and broke out into a sweat directly he came into the paddock.. After being saddled outside and away from the crowd he arrived at the post looking -as though he had been hosed, and those who bad backed him on his early morning form would have been glad to get out of their money. First Chester, who so nearly woni thanks to the false pace at which the race was run, received very little notice, and no attention was paid to Remus, but Wxa cheBter waB much admired, The -race ia: fully described elsewhere. Unfor tunately for Nordenfeldt and Isonomy, nothing was anxious to make a pace, and they were travelling very slowly until Quinnyent to the front with Isonomy, From the mile-post to the entrance to the Btraight the Adelaide colt was going strong and well, but 'after passing the distance he died away and left Nordenfeldt and First Chester to fight 6uB the finish. For a few strides First Chester appeared .to be winning easily, but inch by inch tbe favourite crept up to him, and then to the horror of the Iatter's backers First Chester distinctly cannoned his opponent and knocked him back, Nordenfeldt again got up alongside his long- legged rival, only to be interfered with a second time, and very few horses would have continued to straggle after such a disappointment at the end of a racej bnt on Ellis straightening him: and ap plying the whip and spura. again, the gallant son of Musket answered like a bulldog, and! j;;j i;,;- O ?.?... . ;. : .?;v;:;:.' i...^ ,.:.... i :.::;; J inrfgbt his head in front aa he and the ont ader flashed past the Judge's box. There vraa a scene of excitement until Norden telflf s number was hoisted, and great indig .oation was expressed at Kelso's riding of i.JTmt Cheater. Had the latter won he would Ul all probability have been disqualified, but as far aa his rider waa concerned I think he was blameless in the matter, the boy being too exhausted to control his mount when he began to hang out from distress. There was some talk of bringing Kelso before the Stewards, but nothing came of it. Winchester passed Thunder bolt and Isonomy in the run home, and gained third place, and Uralla finished absolutely last. The time was very slow, but this was due to nothing making a pace, and those who pooh-pooh Nbrdenfeldt'a Cup chance will probably find that he will beat First Chester easily enough ia that race. Only five horses were backed for the Coburg Stakes, several slippery customers evidently not being wanted on this particular voyage. Lantern ran a great horse under his weight, but he had to knock under to the leniently treated Bohemian, while Merrimu would probably have been in front of Mr. Crozier's horse if he had not been shut in at the home turn. The following are the results :— MEIBOUBNE STAKES. A sweepstakes of 5 aovs. each, 2 ft, with 300 aoded; second horse to receive 50 sovs. out of the stake. For three-year- olds and upwards.

They all got away on even term3, with the excep tion of Bos worth, who was very slow on his Ieg3. The first to begin galloping were Bingmaster and Trenton, those two leading Sheet Anchor, Prome theus, and Honeydew to the milepost, when Bos worth rushed through bis field and was leading three lengths at the bridge. Irenton and Honey dew were closing on the veteran as they ran to the abattoirs, with Sheet Anchor and \ Cyclops just heading Eingmaster, the rear being brought up by Mozart, At the sheds Trenton caught Bosworth, the pair being followed by Honeydew, Cyclops, Bingmastsr, and Prometheus ; but coming to the turn Sheet Anchor ran no on the inside, and he and €ydops came into the straignt side by side with Trenton and Eingmaster in pursuit. The ontsider was soon done with, and Sheet Anchor held the lead to the distance, where Trenton challenged, and quickly getting the measure of the Ballarat horse, fie gradually drew away and won easily by half a length. Bingmaster was close up third, with Prometheus fourth, and Cyclops fifth, Mozart, Honeydew, and Bosworth cantering in together. Time, 2 mm. 16} sec HOXHAM HANDICAP.

Fiom a level start Doncaster, Chuctater, and Comet were the first to move, bat Agitation at once went to the front and led Doncaster, Signor, aud Comet past the Stand, Mentmore lying last. Bounding the turn Agitation was two lengths clear of Comet, Doncaster, and Signor, who. were abreast, with Genoa and Lesbia at the head of the others, and these positions were pretty well maintained past the bridge, but at the abattoirs Le3bia wa3 at Agitation's girths, and Comet, Doncaster, and Signor were close handy. Racing down the back stretch Signor going very strong cam9 to the front, and led Le3bia, Agitation, and Comet to the turn, but entering the straight Mentmore on the inside ran to the front, and he and Lesbia came on clear of Signor, with Comet and Genoeat the latter's heels. From the distance Mentmore and Lesbia ran a splendid race home, the mare staying the longer and winning by a neck. Signor, who came again, was three-parts of a length from the second, and only a neck in front of Comet and Genoe, the last being Anglesey and OS Colour. Time, 2 mm. 57 sec.

Duration, and Boyal Maid j ampin g the flrst hurdle in advance with The Agent; bringing up -the rear, and the order entering the straight was Gasalier, Duration, Boyal Maid, Molrow, and The Agent, the lot running in Indian file passed the Stand, a lenzth separating each. At the river The Agent headed Molrow, and at the nest hurdle Duration hit hard and dropped back to the 'faTOurite. Royal Maid joined Gasalier at the 'bridge, and at the abattoirs Royal Maid waa a length clear of Duration and Gasalier together, with the favourite three lengths away. There was no change tall the hurdle'coming to tb.8 turn, when Tha Agent suddenly ran to the head of affairs and led into the straight from Duration and Gaaalier. The latter made a good run at the distance, but The Agent jumped the last hurdle with a lead of a length, and held this advantage to the end, winning cleverly if not easily. Duration was a moderate third, with Royal Maid and Molrow cantering in at long intervals. Tims, 3 min. 55J sec. SELLING BACE. A sweepstake of 3 sovs. each, 1 ft, with 150 added.

From a fair start Egbert and Virago jumped off from Albanus. and the latter going up at the abat toirs he and Egbert led the field two lengths pasl the sheds. Racing along the stretch Albanus went to the front closely attended by Solo, Virago, and Phaon, and the leader kept his place into the straight Here Scaramouch made his appearance, and gradually creepinz up he passed Solo, and only failed by a short neck to reach Albanus. Only a neck oft Solo was third, and then came Virago, Egbert, and Phaon, with Stonebroke last all the way. Time, 1 min. 311 sec THE MABIBTSNONG PLATE.

There were two trifling breakaways before the word was given to a pretty even start. Maddelina was the first to get on her legs, and the others that showed prominently as they settled down were the The Nun, Chesham, and Acme on the rails, while Blairgowrie and Loui3e Berta were well up in the centre of the course. Maddelina was the first to cross the tan, Acme- Chesham, and Blairgowrie be ing at her heels, but as they came on to the course proper Acme shot out and took a clear lead, while flladdelina gave way to Blairgowria and Louise Berta, with The Nun and Chesham at the head of the others. As they came to the rails Acme was righ away frcm the field with Hale3 looking rouni at his pursuers, and although Blairgowrie and Ionise Berta struggled on they could never decrease the gap. Jit the distance Maddelina came again, and answering gamely to each cat ox the' whip she passed first Louise Berta and then Blairgowrie, but Acme won with ridiculous ease by three lengths. Hales never having moved on her from the tune she took up the running. Blairgowrie, who was not ridden out, finished three-quarters of a length behind Maddelina, with Louise Berta only a length off fourth. Then at dear intervals came Chesham fifth, Dividend sixth, with The Nun, Tele phone, and Devotion next, the last to pass the post being Dufferin.

Nordenfeldt and Remus were the first to jump into their bridles, and, the latter made play past the Stand, a length clear, of Nordenfeldt and Isonomy, with Dunlop and. thunderbolt at the keels of the favourite, Win chester and First Chester just heading Uralla, who. was bringing up the rear. Eemualedlsonomy alength round the first turn, with Nordenfeldt twice, that distance from the Adelaide colt, and closely fol lowed by Thunderbolt, Dunlop being on the latter's quarters, and Uralla still last. Passing the river booth Remus increased bis advantage, and at the mile-and-quaiter post he was nearly two lengths in front of Isonomy, who was about the same distances from Nordenfeldt and Thunderbolt, the latter pair abreast, being closely followed by Dunlop ; while Uralla on the outside had improved her position, and left First Chester acting as whipper-in. Isonomy had drawn a little nearer to Remus at the milepost the pace still being very moderate, and at the heels 0! Nordenfeldt and Thunderbolt the other four were almost together, though First Chester was slightly in the rear of the other three. Between here and the abattoirs Quinn determined that a pace must be made, and cutting down Remus he took Isonomy to the front, and led two lengths passing the abattoirs, Remus, Noruenfeldt, and Thunderbolt racing side by side next, and here Dunlop was seen to lose his position and drop to the rear. Isonomy striding along in Sne style led Nordenfeldt and Thunderbolt past the sheds, with Uralla just clear of First Chester and Winchester, the lot being well packed, with the exception of Remus and Dunlop, who were rapidly losing ground. Down the bend and past the half- mile cost Isonomy continued to bowl along in front, with Nordenfeldt, Thunder bolt, and Uralla abreast at his heels, and clo3ely attended by Firat Chester and Winchester. At the turn Isonomy was still to the fore, and here Uralla began to fade away, Nordenfeldt at the same time drawing dear of Thunderbolt, while First Chester took an opportunity of making a run through the centre of the field and settled down just behind Nordenfeldt and Thunderbolt. When they were fairly in a line for home Isonomy, on the rails, retained the lead, but in a few strides First Chester andtNordenfeldt were at him, and Quinn was soon busy with the whip. At the distance Isonomy and First Chester were level, with Nordenfeldt on the latter's quarters, aud of the three First Chester was going the best Isonomy dropped away at the beginninglof the Lawn, and then Nordenleldt went up to First Chester, Thunderbolt making a final run at this point and then dying off beaten. First Chester now began to roll about from distress, and boring out he cannoned against Nordenfeldt and knocked the favourite out of his stride. Nothing daunted the son of Musket again got on terms, but First Chester bumped him once more, the two horses by this time being right in the middle of the course. It now looked any odds that Nordenfeldt could not make up his ground in the short distance to be travelled : but Ellis called upon bun for a final effort, and answering like a tiger to the last cut oi the whip he just caught First Chester under the Judge's box, and won amidst tremendous excite ment by a head. While the two leaders were fight ing it out Power had brought Winchester with a great run from the distance, and 100 yards frou home it looked as though be might win, but he died away again at the finish, and was beaten a length and a half from First Chester. Thunderbolt was a length from his stable companion, with Isonomy at hi: girths, and then some distance off came Dunlop anc Remus, with Uralla the absolute last. Time, 2 min 482 sec.
