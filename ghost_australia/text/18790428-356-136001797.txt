The , rider was loudly cheered for his pluck.:' The Ticrf' Club Handicap wound up the pro gramme,- and the .finish was not good.

Bendooley hoiere nearly came to grief, but his jockey cleverly pulled him together again. .Fronting the stand Abdallah in front cleared the hurdles well, the others all striking the top. iAt Cutts' all were well together, and after clearing the hurdles at the bacs, Byron made for the favourite, and at the trainers' quarters got a slight lead, but only for a short time. Bendooley hero was a long:way to the rear. At the straight Byron anrid Abdallah cleared the last hurdles almost together, the latter having a slight advan. tage. A "disperato struggle ensued, and O'Moil used a plentiful supply of whipcord. Lloyd took it rather too, easily till past the distance.
