"TIE BIBLE AND INFIDELITY" OuR Wallsend Correspondent says:--Dr. Hughes, on Sunday evening last, according to arrangements, delivered another lecture, the subject being "The Bible and Infi delity." The doctor spoke at considerable length of a period before Adam was made a living soul, an'd gave a full description of the Ark, built by Noah, and the large family collected therein, and sympathised with Noah for the many difficulties lie had to contend with ere he succeeded in get ting the polar bear from the regions of the North Pole, into the ark. The doctor then referied to Lot and his wife, and how Abra ham pleaded with the Lord ti save the town from destruction. Then the Tower of Babel came next, and the confounding of languages. Hethen passed rapidly onto the New Testament referring to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and how the clergy dealth with this subject. The speaker was one hour explaining the above. The School of Arts was well filled, a few ladies were present. A New York young woman fainted while she was getting married because a person who was acting as usher was the man she really loved.
