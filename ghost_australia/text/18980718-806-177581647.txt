Prayer is “the wish ofthb/heart,” “tho child of* faith,”not at ' ofttiraes in sighs - and/ tears./- /-The .preacher said the most powerful prayers - were often those where language failed,-and when during ■Spme J ;sfefere /adversity,- some sore trial* or. ’liereayementr,^'the*silent tears reached the cor bfGod/ notwithstanding tho-singing of millions arpubd the ’tlrrone.. Ho urged all to enjPy more frequently tho .privilege of y.iayor, and-reminded tliem that, life’s bur dens would be lighter if/they did. -St. Paurs.r-TTno. Rev,. W. 0, Sadlier ! preached last evening: from James I, ; 17, is the - man ’that onduroth tempta tion:” * Ho explained • the < historical sot of this benediction. There/ was immediate danger- threatening the, church.'- Certain. HebrPw .Ghrifftiana- wero undergoing severe . -'without. Added to this cprtain rich men began- to pretend; that their abundance in riio 'Christian- assem blies vyas - with a. view t of patronising -them.; /-There arose out of .these dangers a tendency to preferthe rich to high places. St./James puts them right on the doctrine and church - order- by showing that such preference for the rich was subversive of the catholic* principles, of their Lord. He then passes from the particular form to the general nature of tomptation. It is the necessary condition of an active spiritual life.,/It occupies .'a well defined* position. An engineer tests his bridges to see how many tons they will * bear; men test men to see. how. far they, can/be trusted. . This too, is am instrument in God’s hands. Special. tests precede special service. St. Paul was the greatest preacher to the Gen tiles, but he first was tried by encounter ing coldness and suspicion in the church. .Yet this, treatment assures us of our son ship; it taps the life until the life gives forth a healthy sound; it sharpens - 'the spiritual wits.- Then and not till then is * man fitted - for- special service. The re sult is tliat tho .tried Christian becomes loubly armed. Ho knows himself and .vliat he has to .expect from the world. In ibis respect ho is'blessed, for he realises -how. helpless he is in himself. This reali sation is of the essence of faith. Han’s natural depravity may bo doubted by some vs a figment of theology, nevertheless it is the starting point for all who desire to hbey the monitions of -the Spirit of God, ’ Haying comb to ,this knowledge there is :mother and-in some measure a comple , uontary truth./ 7 By temptation b man ;omc8 to kjiow what a mighty deliverer is ; vis. The life of the Christian is not one of. vomnolonco, but of war.. Yet it is a -war \- a .which faith in the Deliverer is; a pre .requisite, a Deliverer who, gives the vic tj>*7 .oil along, the Ime. - The -anthem . was 7 Seek. ye the Lord,/?-, the solo part being 'iokbh by. Mr, It. Armstrong. There -was » very, largo congregation. • -fit. John's.—1‘nb Rev. J. H. Mackay con ducted both services yesterday. The text for the, evening was. “Choose ye this day whom ye will serve..’ — Joshua, 24tli chap-, ter, loth, verse. The preacher said that when Joshua mode use of the words of the text his time, on earth was drawing short Hit .days on earth were numbered. Ho evi dently hod'some prophetic fear lest the people should depart from the God who hal done so much for them, so he asked them to enter into a solemn covenant with Gcd He/ first -advised them showing wl-et God had done -for them mid their ore fathers, then he brought them to a solemn asuc—God on the one side -nd t v p gods of the heathen- nations on the other— : and asked them the question, “Whom will yo, chcqse this day, whom ; will y© servo?” Tne-preacher pointed out*that God puts the same issue to all of us to-day. Ho oaks us not to drift down the stream of life, with every current, hot to be .led ' away uy the' passing customs of the world; but to cheese between God and life eternal, and the world and death eternal. This world ! did. not give satisfaction even to those who had achieved the heights of their ambition, aomi had courted the highest Honors in art, literature and statesmanship ; some had a-night glory at the cannon's mouth, others HhU made wealth their ambition and found ; , But all, although their earthly ainbi ibh bad been what they desired, had" ; confessed/that they wore still unsatisfied, that there wbs something lacking. On the other hand; the experiences of those who 'md their choico—wlio hod chosen for llod-^prbvcd, that they, had found full sat isfaction, They had found that which could oot, bo taken away from them. There was So record of a-soul who had chosen for God being disappointed, or, oh the ofcho/ hand,- of a soul choosng the world/Icing satisfied, -There' is .much’ in Clirist,- but ittle in the world, cohsequeribly/ there ihould bo* no hesitatioh in choosing. ’ Deach s cortabr, but when it comes is uncord..*.). Therefore/now is the time to choose. Tho preacher closed, an impressive discourse ! yth an appeal to choose for Chrst •vow, and? to/embrace the opportunity af fojvled before itVis too late.
