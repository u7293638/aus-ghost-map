The Advertiser SATURDAY, JANUARY 8, 1881. It cannot be disputed that protectionism Las in recent yean made great headway in Germany, although there is a very strong party against it. There, as else- where, the system is the copartner of militarism. It is no doubt true that in some countries a restrictive fiscal system obtains independently of mili tary schemes, yet none the less is it easy of proof that protectionism on the European continent has been encouraged most ib States where the exactions of a bellicose policy entailed the construction of fiscal barriers. It is no mere figure of epeech to term protective tariffs "hostile." Closely examined they are in fact seen to be hostile in more than a com mercial een-e. When it is announced that two nations, say Germany and Austria, bave entered into a defensive ireatyf quickly on the heels of this intimation comes another to the effect that mutual concessions regarding their border duties are about to be considered. Thus in a manner are involved a peaceful alliance and a more liberal commercial treaty—hos tility in the one case being, it is reasonable to infer, incompatible with hostility in the other. Nothing in deed illustrates this more significantly than does the conduct of Prince Bismarck since the pursuance of his blood and iron policy compelled him to turn his back upon himself. His position enables him to make bis dominant will supreme. With lofty ecorn he can and does disregard the taunts occasionally levelled against him as the betrayer of a cause he once professedly espoused. At one of the meetings of the Free Trade Association held at Berlin in the course of last year Dr. Bamberger vigorously attacked Prince Bismarck on this ground. Dr. Bamberger is a dis tinguished economist and a epirited political leader. In the Senate as on the platform his incisive words cut to the quick, as they did when he assured the Berlin meeting that half a century's progress on the path of free trade would never have been ob structed and reversed by protection bad the Imperial Chancellor not deserted his colors. In other ways and places Prince Bismarck has also been forcibly reminded of bis tergiversation as well as denounced for bis high-hand interference with com merce. Hie refusal to allow Hamburg, the premier commercial emporium of the Conti- Dent, to pay a lump sum for the privilege of remaining a free port, was a characteristic iD?tance of the extremity to which ho was prepared to go. It moreover exemplified his resolutedesire toeee free trade gradually extinguished. His violent will resents all opposition, and it is not improbable that the checks he has met with have urged Inn to go further than he originally proposed* Be that as it may, he has reduced Germany to a condition akin to that of France in 1641, as described by Lord JVumeESha when he said that France had made ever/ article of produce ? subject of protetfaw " down to needles and fishhooks." It is against euch formidable odds tint the German freetraders have to contend; jet, judged by the proceedings of the Eco nomic Congress recently held at Berlin, they are neither undaunted nor dispirited. Although well aware of the difficulties to be encountered they have resolved to pro mulgate sound views on economical ques tions, hopefully- trusting to the eventual attainment of their object through the em ployment of euch rational means. As usual it is the harassed and misled con sumers who have to be convinced tint they are the victims of the cupidity of traders and manufacturers, and the took of designing politicians who raise the cry that it its unpatriotic to admit foreign competition, or in any way by traffic to strengthen the hands of • possible enemy. In the van of this body^of intelligent assailants of a barbarous system and exposers of mean and interested de ception stands Herr von Forckenbeckjtbs Ocer-burgermeister of Berlin. At tin Congress, attended also by Beveral Ajbb trians, this civic chief who refused dis tinction at the sacrifice of his pna ciple? when the Chancellor was eager to favor him, demonstrated that tin burdens of the town populations espe cially are increasing, and that xefitf from this crushing weight is impos sible unless a free-trade policy is readopted. In dealing with the eternal clamor Mat protection to native industries ether speakers showed that in order to keep tm an appearance of satisfying the require ments of the clamorers the Government had to pit one industry against another, or jto protect one after the other, and in any case to make consumers pay through the non for restraints on the freedom of - commerce. It is the old story. Some thirty yean ago Mr. Henry Dunckley, since better known as "Verax," pub lished a work in which he main tained that when duties are levied on foreign manufactures with the avowed object of protecting the native ones, "free trade asserts not only that the impost is m fraud on the public, but that the manufac tures so protected would do better without the protection afforded than with it; and that, even if they suffered for a time from the effects of foreign competition tin general trade of the country would be a gainer to a moch greater extent. On tin other hand, when duties are levied for tin purpose of meeting the pecuniary wants of the State, free trade insists on the inexpe diency of any rate of taxation which checks consumption; its maxim on thispoint is that within certain limits low taxes are mom profitable than high taxes, since the greater cheapness of the article in the former i**m ensures its being used by a much greater proportion of the population." These doc trines are upheld by the German econa mists, as indeed they must be wherever reason prevails over prejudice, and the wel fare of the whole commnnitvis esteemed above the selfishness and rapacity of mere class interests. One of the subjects discussed at the Con gress recalls the stirring times when tin Anti-Corn Law League made England resound with their protests. The Germans are apparently in a plight similar to that of the English when the first necessaries of life were enormously taxed. The com laws were the grossest instance of the sup port of native industry at the ruinous and perilous cost of the community. When this truth illumined England the hour of their extinction ww nigh, 4 kindred result may be predicted when the gnat mass of the German people are enlightened as to the oppressive nature of the burdens they are at present forced to bear. To tias end nothing can be of sorer advantage than the widespread publication of a resolution to the effect that because of the altered conditions of production in Western and Central Europe the importation of foreign grain into Germany is a necessity, "fit hindrance," the resolution avere, "presses upon all industries the products of which are exchanged in the open market, and the gain which some may derive under certain circumstances from corn duties is not to be compared to the injury resulting to the rest of the population.'' Those deluded by tin assurance that the foreigner would have to pay the duty on corn have had their eyes opened to the fallacy of the assertion. The startling rise in the prices of ceresls is due to the artificial scarcity occasioned by the operation of a most iniquitou? tax. The foreigner does not pay the impost, and the country is unable to meet the demand; yet in the face of these facts protectionists insist on taxing the poor man's loaf until it becomes a veritable luxury. And what is true of the limita tions open tiie import of grain is equally true of other Customs duties inflicted on the Germans. Ere long, we venture to believe, they will view the whole matter in a practical light and eagerly labor to rid themselves of the incubus of protectionism. Loyalty, unity, patriotism are not dependent on a pernicious focal eyetem any more than they are on a Bis marckan policy. When the Germans are brought back to their free trade allegiance their nation will be happily wiped out of the stock reference-book to which colonial and other protectionists are fond of appeal ing when driven in stress of argument to example however pernicious rather than precept A. Fog and Smoke Society has been formed in London. Hie name is peculiar, but the need of some each organization is pressing. At the end of the long con tinued fogs of last winter a joint Commit tee of tbe National Health and Eyrie So cieties was appointed to investigate the best means of lessening the amount of emoke poured into the atmosphere of the metropolis, and aUo to consider inventions for economising fuel and to get up an txbiltition of smoke- preventing appara tus. The result of their partial labor* has been the formation of this new society with «large and influential sanitary and scien tific membership. London fogs have en joyed an unenviable reputation from time immemorial, and the peaaoup aspect of a London "peculiar" has often been face tiously described; but there are very serious aspects of the matter as well. Modern Cockneys, like the Gimmerii of old, spend a good part of their, winter in an atmosphere of deep and continued obscurity. It is one of the commonest of Bow Bell jokes to talk of sending a slice at city fog in a letter to country cousins to show how much they miss by vegetating in the provinces during the dead months of the year. It used to be a favorite prejudice of the French people that the alleged excess of suicide in England ■was due to the murky atmosphere in which their neighbors across the channel live I «nd moved, and though the true Londoner got accustomed to the infection, and even «toutly maintained the healthiness of the foge, there have always been sanitarian and physicians to dilate on their evils, and to urge vigorous steps to lessen if not re~ move what is not only a (treat nuisance but a growing danger. Whatever concerns the gnat heart of the civilised world has a Certain amount of interest for us, and the evils which dty fogs entail are in smaller degree common to all growing centres of population. A short while ago a clever brochure after the manner of the "Battle of Dork ing," was published in London, purporting to 1m a letter written in the year 191% by an octogenarian New Zealand settler to his grandchildren, which gives aa ac count of a sad catastrophe to the metropolis of the world in 1683, of which he was a horrified eye-witness. The city waa en* gulfed in fog, and every living creature in it destroyed in the course of a single night. In addition to a graphic descrip tion of the horrors to be witnessed in this City of the dead, the pamphlet gives a theory of the causes of London fogs and of their hurtfulneas to life, and seeks to show that attar all such a dire calamity as the suffocation of a section, if not of the whole of the inhabitants of the metropolis, is within tho bounds of at least scientific possibility. But there are many -people who are neither alarmists nor caricaturists who see in these fogs a hindrance to commerce and a danger to health, and who, with the Fog and Smoke Society, are desirous of investigating the whole subject with a view to remove or at least alleviate their disadvantages. What a common fog is we all know. We are aware that if air saturated with invisible watery vapor comes in contact with a colder stratum it collects in minute watery globules, forming a misty cloud. From these causes there ate some regions of almost perpetual fogs and others where they are euro to arise in certain ascertained Circumstances. But city fogs are a class •part. They are more dense, more 'durable, more deleterims than the ordi nary vapors and exhalations. Professor Frankland says of them that the minute globules of water « get coated with a thin pellicle of coal-oil, coot, and tbe other pro ducts of the imperfect combustion of coal which leave our chimneys as smoke;" and hence they are thicker and more lasting, be cause the " moisture is by the coating pro tected from evaporation"—more dangerous also, because they are taken into the lungs xnthis •ami-ttlid state. Now this being so it is easy to sea the accumulated danger of London fogs. The natural position of the metropolis in the valley of the Thames of course favors their formation, but the arti ficial conditions of the great conglomerate of brick and lime intensify their severity. It is estimated that out of the 697,285 tenements which compose modern London 3,583,000 grates daily belch forth shea •moke during the long winter, each furnish ing iu own contribution of imperfectly consumed coal to pollute and poison the long- suffering tahabitante. Of course the evil is not always or equally apparent, but it prevails mon or less every winter, aad it is rapidly incnaaing. In 1870 the Lord Mayor's procession had to parade the streets at midday by torchlight; in 1673 there wen exceptionally serene toga; in 1879 they lasted for about six weeks in succession -, and daring the present season the fogs have begun early, aad promise to be continued and intense. The annual in crease of the area of inhabited London of course adds to the evil yearly, so that it is not surprising that the matter lias recently occupied a great deal of attention. It formed the burden of the President's address at the Sanitary •Congress at "Exeter, and it was discussed both in the Health and Art Departments of tbe Social Science Congress at Edin burgh, in the former of which Dr. Car penter epoke of the prevalence of foes and the proposed remedies; while in the latter Dr. Richmond dwelt on their destructive cess to buildings ind works of art. Of the ill effects of these fogs there is ample proof. The commercial losses they cause an considerable. While they last traffic is suspended; people stay indoors when not actually constrained to go abroad; and discontented shopkeepers cool their toes behind deserted counters. The cost of artificial light, too, is immwi?fi> and gas \- companies flourish on the calamity, while venturous linkbsys earn a hilarious living by levying blackmail on benighted wanderers. A season of fog is also the burglars' opportunity. "What a city to sack,"!1 Bbcher is reported to have .said when he first saw London; and there is a whole army of inglorious Bluchers fester ing in the alums of Drury-lane and White chapel to whom the annual recurrence of fog is as the very harvest time of crime. It is roughly estimated that the annual money loss from these sources amounts to several «iilH«««, and if some industrious Cocker would only strive to make a near approximation to the actual sum the calcu lation would be most valuable in inciting Parliament and the civic authorities to speedy action. But the loss of time and property is not the worst of it Acci dents to life and limb are multiplied, and the impenetrable sulidity of the London fog carries in its murky folds the poisonou? germs of disease and death. Experts tell us that in these fogs are held suspended, carbon in a finely divided state, sulphurous acid gas,carbonic acid gas, carbonicoxide, and other nodous elements, and these are fruit ful parents of sore throats, bronchitis, and headaches, as the gritty particles of the sonified vapors inflame and lacerate the membranes of the throat and lungs, and choke the air passages. The death-rate conclusively shows this, though there are thoroughpaced patriotic Cockneys who deny the dangers, and even assert the healthfulness of their winter visitors. Dur ing the greatfogof 1873780deathsabovethe average were registered in one week. The statistics of \the fog which lasted from November, 1879, to the first week of February, 1880, have been investigated by Dr. Mitchell, and the results are published in the Journal of the Scottish Metereolo gical Society, and without going into par ticulars it is enough to say that he found an increase tin the death-rate utterly out of proportion to the ratio in other large towns, and this increase was most marked among the very young and the very old, taking the form of whooping-cough in the one case, and of asthma in the other. In this scientific age can no means be devised of grappling with an evil which has culminated in London, but which everywhere grows with the growth, of Urge cities ? Smoke is simply a form of fuel which passes out of our chimneys not fully utilised. It is so much waste, and if it could be avoided there would be a saving to purse as well as health. This is the problem which inventors have now to solve under the material stimulus of necessity. There are rules extant against furnaces and the chimneys of public works where the smoke demon is in full bust, but any changes to be effectual for huge cities must go further than public works, and it will be hard to get the average Engtinhman who believes his house to be his castle to submit to the restrictions which it might be desirable to impose. Cooking by gas is one suggestion, but gas stoves are apt to have an un pleasant odor, and have not the cheer ful look of an open fireplace. The use of preparedfuel is suggested, but that speaks of expense for poor people. Dr. Carpenter proposes that new houses should perforce be built with smoke- consuming fireplaces, and a limit fixed within which all ordinary grates shall be replaced by those of the new description, and that a heavy tax be levied on all grates and fireplaces not con suming their own smoke. But the true smoke- consuming apparatus is yet a thing of the future, and Englishmen do not like fanciful taxes, as Mr. Lowe dis covered to his cost when he proposed a kindred tax on lucifer matches Another suggestion is that huge chimneys from 400 to 500 feet high be erected at different points all over London, into which the various chimneys may be led as soil pipes into a main sewer, and forth from which the accumulated smoke of a small district shall be hurled high into the pure ether. Probably the solution of the difficulty will not be found in the extension of the co-operative principle to chimney stacks, but without doubt there are both fame and fortune in store for the lucky inventor who can devise a cheap, speedy, and effectual remedy for a crying evil.

They had previously asked gence of the economic interests with those of tbefaoardtolet the council have a snpply, but sociology generally. This waa the inductive they were informed that there was a scarcity of method, or that which proceeded by ob pontoom.

An inquest was held on Friday after noon, January 7, at the Hospital, bv the city coroner (Mr. T. Ward, J.P.), on the body of John James, who met his death by au explosion of gunpowder on the Hairne?ailway, on Decem ber 88 last. Mr. A. Lowrie was chosen foreman of the jury. James Thomas, navvy, working oa tbe Nairne .Railway, and living at the Fifteen mile Camp, amid he was working for deceased on December 28. He was a ganger on the works in tbe Fifteen-miles cuttiug. Deceased was jump ing a hole out. The hole was 4 feet 0 inches deep. Something went wrong, but witness did not know what. There was a ohatge of blasting powder in the hole, and when deceased was toying to get it out it exploded. Deceased and a workman were thrown to tbe ground. They were cut about, covered in blood, and struck blind by the explosion. Led them to the foot «f the hill, and witness believed they were taken to tbe Hospital. By a juror—lt was usu«l to insert the fuse before tamping. Thomas Walker, contractor for the Nairne Railway, said decaasei was one of his gangers, and a good man. He was in charge of No. 6 tunnel, and the cutting in which the accident occurred. Witness had been np the line, and on his return was tald that an accident had happened to deceased and another man. Went and foaod them being pat into a cart to be taken to the Hospital, at which place they arrived within an hoar and a half after the accident. On Decem ber 88 witness went to the spot where tbe accident happened. The nature of the material which they had to blast was sandstone and quartz. It required blasting. A Urge shot had first been put in, but was after wards taken away. Deceased was taking out a comer in the bottom of the cutting, and to affect that a drill of one-inch steel was used. In this case they had only to go four or five feet deep, and the hole having been drilled dynamite was pot in. This was used for making a chamber to contain a greater quantity of powder. After this faadbeendonetheholewasohaigedwithsuffieient powder, by deceased, to displace the earth re quired. Iu this ease sand had run in on tho top of the powder, which prevented the fuse from reaching it Deceased took a cleaner to clean oat the sand. Think it came in contact with a stone. He could not remove the atone with the cleaner, and took what is called a jumper. The jumper struck fire against a flint and caused the powder to ignite and explode. Had the fuse been in all tbe men on the cutting would have been killed or injured. Deceased was a most experienced man in this particular work, and had need tone of powder in witness 1 employ. Dr. Ward, senior house surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital, said deceased was admitted on the evening ef December 88. He was sensible. Both his eyes were injured. There were lace rated wounds on each arm. Hk face and arms were covered with the marks of the powder. On January 4 erysipelas set in. He got rapidly worse, and died on the 6th inst. The cause of death wan erysipelas following the wounds on the arms, the result of the accident. The jury returned a verdict of " accidental death." The captain of the steamer Ocean leavas Port Adelaide with no very pleasant remini scences of his stay in the colony. To add to the annoyance which he felt at the enforced delay in discharging his cargo, he his been fined £10 for * breach of the Customs regula tion relating to the unloading of goods witno i entries for them having been passed. It appears thatthe Ocean was reported at the Ouston- Houee on Tuesday morning, January 4, aud the usual twenty-four hours having expired tie captain received notice that he oould laud all cargo tfaat had been entered. He thereupra commenced to iff*"*** the ship aa soon as pos sible. Seme of the .cargo, which was newly all tea, was ewisigned to Messrs. D. & J. Fowler, and had been entered at the Customs; but the remainder for Messrs. Giles & Smith had not been, the consignees intending to clear it thit morning. Before the Custom-House opsne 1, however, a large quantity of the tea, incluJiag about a thousand packages for Mewrs. Giles sad Smith, was placed upon the wh«rf, the stevedores not having sorted it, and the captain apparently not knowing but that |it had all been entered. The landing-waiter on the wharf, who did not appear to notice the fact until the Urge quantity of tea mentioned had been landed, then informed the captain that be bad broken the law, and that it was in his (the landi?g-waiter's) power to seise the goods landed and the ship aa well. The captain with more haste than prudence, perhaps, an swered, "You can seue me a* well if you like." The landing- waiter seised the thousand packages of tea, and removed them into bond, reporting the circumstances to the Collector. Somecom municatioiis afterwards took plaoe between the Customs officers and tbe master of the vessel, the latter complaining of the delay to whioh he had been subjected, and representing that the illegal landing of the goods waa entirely unin tentional. Eventually the Custom-House officials intimated to him that he had dearly broken the Uw, but be could have the option of having the case tried on its merits before a magistrate, or of leaving it in the hands of the Collector to settle. Tbe captain, who could brook no farther delay, wrote and decided on the Utter course, tas the result of which be re ceived the following letter from the Deputy Collector of Customs:—" Sir—Referring to your letter, re dispute with a Oostoma-Hoase officer, I have the honor to inform you that the Ool lector, after hearing the statements of the master of tbe Ocean and tbe landing waiter of the Onatom-HoDse, atrives at the conclusion that the conduct of the former in landing tea on which no duty bad been paid has rendered himself liable to heavy penalties, but as he states that he has been misled and asks to be leniently dealt with, the Collector has decided to let him off with a compensation fine of £10. Tbe tea, which has been illegally landed may be delivered on payment of all expenses incurred.*' Undoubtedly the Act empowering these fittes was meant for cases where fraudulent intent was manifested, and not for errors such as this. The fine not only reflects on the captain, but imputes a desire to evade payment of duty on the part of the consignees of the tea. Ariel, the flying bov, will make his last appearance at Wivell's Art Gallery to-day and this evening. The South Australian Rifle Club's range at Henley Beach is now open to members for practice. Riflemen, we understand, will find everything, to facilitate good shooting, the targets and other accessories being on tbe latest principles while the range is nicely situated. The pantomime at the Theatre Koyal will to-day afford amusement to many who have bat few opportunities of enjoyment, as the in mates of the various charitable institutions have been invited by Mr. Allison to attend the matinee, which wfll take place in file afternoon. Families sad country visitors will do well to avail themselves of this chanoa of witnessing the Christmas pantomime, which is to be with drawn from the stage in the course of a few nights, and this will be the only afternoon per formance. The excessive heat of Friday evening doubtless kept many away from Professor Pepper's scientific entertainment >t Gainer's Theatre. Notwithstanding tin poor attendance tiie professor went through his advertised pro gramme without curtailment, and thoroughly amosed and instructed those present. The telephone and electricity were the principal testates, and both were dealt with by she lecturer in an interesting manner. Inconse quence of the beat of the weather Professor Pepper has decided to postpone any further ■ entertainments till the end of April. We have been shown two oil color paint ings now on exhibition, and for sale at Mr. Williama's shop, next the Southern Cross Hotel, in King William-street, the production of Mr. O. Strother. They represent river scenes, the prfceipal feature in them being tbe natural manner in which the artist has developed the different shades of green in the foliage on the river's banks, and the care evidently bestowed upon the small details in each picture. Both are first-class productions, though on a very small scale, and lead us to expect a good work from this painter's brush in the future. On Friday evening, January 7, the distri bution of prises in connection with the military N.O. Officers* clubroomat the Sir John Barleycorn Hotel. There was a Urge attendance. Colonel Dowues, who presided, complimented the non commissioned officers on the success of their venture, which be had considered was rather too pretentious. He was, however, glad to find that he was mistaken, and he hoped that similar un dertaking)) in the future would be eqaaUy for tunate. He trusted that the picnic would not detract from the eacoe«s of the military epirts to be held in August, but that the men would persevere and make a still better display. Mrs. Dowries then distributed the prizes to the win sen of the several events, tbe results of which bave already been given in our columns. The usual votes of thanks followed.
