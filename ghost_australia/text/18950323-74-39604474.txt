CRICKET. ENCLAND V. VICTORIA. (nY CABLE.) MELBOURNE, FRIDAY. Another beautiful day favoured the con tinuation of the match between Stoddart's English Eleven and Victoria, but the last test match seems to have closed public interest in the game for this season, and the attendance was no Letter than on the opening day, the takings being only Â£68 8s Gd. For the greater part of the after noon, however, those present were cheered by the prospect of an easy victory fcr the Victorian eleven,though towardsthe close of the day this agreeable contingency became rather more remote. The Victorian's first innings ch'sed for 269, leavihtg them with a nice lead of 138 on the first innings. Briggs, with three wickets for 59 runs, came out best in the b)wling. The Englishmen commnced their second innings at five minutes past three. The first wicket fall for one, two for 52, three for 78, four for 79, five for 92, and six for 143. Then Ford and Briggs became associated, and the bowling had to be frequently changed, but all to no purpose, for when the stumps were drawn the partnership still held good, the total standing at 188, Ford 60, Briggs 22\. Ford's contribution was invaluable to his side, and this is about the best innings he has played in Australia. Nothing in the match, however, excited quite so much enthusiasm as Johns's wicket keeping. He never missed the ghost of a chan.e. The following are the scores: VIOTOBIA. First Innings. HI.
