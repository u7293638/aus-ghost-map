Mr. Symon, who appearodfor the jdefeooe, 8&id; he should all no evidence; and Mr. Pater prooeeded to address the Court. Diping-his speech the 8.M. pointed out that perhaps Mr. Symon was relyingonthe fatal want of the link in the ptoaiiff'e chain—the eoadh not having been connected with Hie defendants. The question of ownership having been pat beyond a doubt, Mr. Symon thai said he must call evidence^ and accordingly did so, and by the testimony he produced directly challenged the allegations as to the vicious character of the horses. Mr. Baler then concluded Ids speech. Mr. 8ymon contended that the defendants ware not in any way liable. The Court retired to consider its decision, and on itsjeturn said.thpt they "could not arrive at/a judgment without questioning Allan, the<driver of tne coach, who had been called- by neither party.
