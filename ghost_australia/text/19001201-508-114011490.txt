RECURRENT WINDSOR GHOST. Is Windsor Castle haunted? is a query pro pounded by the London 'Daily Mail.' A rumor has got about the Royal borough that at midnight the sentries have seen a figure in white stalking through the cloisters near the Albert Memorial chapel. In the vicinity, it may mentioned, is the grave of the Rev- T. Doughty, a member of the famous Tichborne family, who was a canon of Windsor for twenty-nine years, and died in De cember, 1701. Perhaps he has re-appcarea to deny the rights of the new claimant' from Aus tralia. It will be remembered that a few years ago Lieutenant^ Glynn, of the Grenadier Guards, alleged that while he was sitting in tlie Royal library at Windsor Castle the ghost of Queen Elizabeth passed by him. Watch was kept by the Royal librarian and others for several nights, yet the ghost did not reappear. Lieutenant Glynn nevertheless stuck to . his original statement. Others have also declared that Windsor Castle has a' ghost, but whether it is Queen Elizabeth or Herne the Hunter has not been determined. Strange to say, Lieutenant Glynn has just re turned from South Africa and is now captain and adjutant of the 1st Grenadiers at Windsor. This fact may have given rise to the present ghost story. Since Captain Glynn saw the ghost in the Royal library the rooms- have been refitted throughout and the electric light has been in stalled. On inquiring of the sentries on duty last night on the ramparts where Herne the Hunter is said to have wandered in Shakspere's day they reported that they had seen nothing of the ghost. At the same time, a creepy feeling comes over one at the spot where the new ghost is said to have reappeared when the lights of the castle have been extinguished for the night.
