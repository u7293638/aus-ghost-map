" You are. very; good to* me," said Clare softly, wheu they were alone. "I don't like to trouble you so."- He had been preparing a dose and gave it to her to swallow before he replied." Then ho stoopfd down and toiiohed her hand. He had the physician's touch, cool ; and healing—a touch which has always something of a magnetio effect upon the nerves.

' Be had seen" much, had. read much, and' had just that' touch of sentiment • and mysticism withont whidh no man can appeal absolutely to a; cultivated. woman."It was very, long since Clare had talked ol the things she now spoke about to him.' Her very, .weakness and the novelty of the situation contributed to unreserve. • She was alone; she was helplessly dependent npon him. Her husband was awayj had hot even written to tell her of his whereabouts, did not appear to concern-himself in the least whether she was well or ill cared for. -There was hot another man, except the two China men and the blacks in th e camp, daring these two days any where hear her. - ?; And here was Geneste, no-kin and* in no way called npon to cohsider her well being, who. had; come over because he feared all might* not be right, had ridden all through the night to secure for her the attendance' of a responsible woman—she discerned in this proceeding a delicate chivalry which appealed ;th her in a manner which would perhaps have been foreign to Geneste's own thoughts of the matter—and: who tended,her as her husband had never done—not from the mere medical point of view, which was-natural enough, - but: with all those nameless tender nesses, the ■ sweotness of-which lie'in the manner of their doing, and with.always that undercurrent of emotion of which, though she could not put it into words, she was acutely conscious.' - ... The • next day the fever had her in its grip again.-, It went through all its.stages— shivering and racking pain in every limb, and:..then burning heat and headache,, with strange fancies and grotesque pictures stand ing ont in the darkness .of closed.eyes, then laudanum stupor, with only the consciousness of pain and thirst, and of Geneste standing by putting wet cloths to her head. She was feebly delirious, though she was unaware of it, and in her. babblings revealed herself to Geneste,; who. purposely kept . Mrs. Bam'm from the room, with the frankness of a" child telling, its* mother of its. sufferings.-1 His heart ached with pity.as he listened. What horrible; misfit this was of fate, he thought, as the sensative.-scourged soul laid bare its secret pains—the agonising. jar of com panionship -by day and by night' with " a nature coarse to the core; the awakening to her doom in her early married months; the horror of the sexual bond; the morbid hatred ' at ' times of the children born of snch Union; the physical aversion to caresses.; the loath ing and disgust of spirit laden breaththe battle of. conscience with all her: womanly instincts, and the triumph of conscience and martyrdom ^ of self' repression.. -.What a lonely life: it; Had been! How starved, how cold, how walled in, how. beaten-down!' He longed' to snatch up the fine tender creature from the -defilement of her shriuundings; to bear her away to. a refined, luxurious, in?" tellectual; home; to. give her the moral and mental food her whole being craved; to worm her with the fire of passion; to nourish her. with affection,. till the poor, braised, stunted bud should, expand and open, forth Into . the glorious flower it was meant should gladden world. •" What might she not be,".he said to himself,to a. man who had her heart Iu. that hour; of delirium he got to know the woman hersdf, and ho got to know,' too, that be; loved her. He was glad, very glad that he.loved Clare .Tregaskiss,'. Fifteen years before .he had loved a woman of loose morals madly— so' madly that: but for -the accidental dis covery-of her faithlessness and utter venality, he would have married her. ■ Now he loved a good woman, not so recklessly, , but with an even surpassing fervor. He was glad to ex perience. the emotion.' which he had believed would never come into his life. •' For fifteen years.he had forsworn love in its finer acceptation.' 'Daring the first six or seven -of those' years adventure, danger, and the - excitement,'of exploration had been the valve for-his. restless energies. .. Women he had not needed." In fact he had turned from all that reminded him of his life of civilisa tion with an intense revulsion. 7 Then during two years, when he had lived at the northern extremity of Leichbardt's Land, he had taken to himself a-graceful South Sea Island girl,, for -whom, till she was killed tragically while bathing,.he had entertained an animal and. half contemptuous affection. Looking back upon thin episode since the dawning upon Him" of Clare Tregaskiss he felt a curious shame. ' . After the girl's'death he made his great expedition across the northern neck of the colony through barbarous country and hostile natives ^frora gulf to ocean, aud it was then he' received, the spear wound'\^hich lamed him for life.7 Thehort had caused a trouble some and dangerous inflammation, and had put a 'stop to the told exploration he Had delighted, in. - During his forced inaction. he had taken up in a measure his old scholarly and .scientific pursuits, and the former; man had begun gradually to replaco the new one. . He had even vague thoughts of going back , to England. -There was no question now of i lung delicacy. " Ho was not yet beyond the prime of life, and might still have a successful . career before. him. - The. Australian career had not been in the financial sense a success, but he had private means, mid this did not trouble him. Besides, Dana Darra, which was/not- heavily encumbered like Mount Wohibo, might'turn out.a"profitable invest ment when ' times got better and successive droughts werefollowed byyeiirsof plenty. It was in this wavering mood, when he had half resolved to-take, a trip, .to England and look round.him before malting-a final decision, as to bis future, that.He . met Hden Cusaok."
