LONDON WEEK BY WEEK (Emily Soldene.) September 25, 1896. Thunder, wind, rain, hail, sleet, tiny needle points of snow that sting one, cyclonic zephyrs that shake and rattle, and rush down the chimney in clouds of last spring’s soot; that fly round the room, then scuttle away again up the way they came. -Cyclonic zephyrs that try (nearly success- fully) to pull the windows out of their frames in the middle of the night. Phoebus don’t get up any more, but lies concealed in dark grey clouds that paralyse one’s “Oh, I can always tell the time” faculties. You open your eyes (regretfully) and think it is 5.30 a.m., but someone knocks on the door, “Letters Madam,” and you find it is 9.30 a.m. * * * * The first muffin bell of the season has rung, and the smell of the “bike tater” can is borne on the midnight air. * * * * Winter is upon us — dirty, dark, clammy, cold, cruel, wet, muddy, macintoshy winter — I shiver. * * * * Last Sunday the Queen celebrated the anniver- eary of the “Battle of the Alma.” Last Tuesday Her Majesty received the Tzar of All the Russia. Time works wonders, sometimes unpleasant ones. * * * * Their Imperial Majesties the Tsar and Tsaritaa of Russia landed in Scotland on Tuesday, and re- ceived a cordial welcome at Leith, the port of debarkation. The arrangements for the recep- tion of the Tsar and Tsaritsa and the safety of the public were as complete as human fore- thought could make them. * * * * Although the rain was pouring at the time, the carriage was open, the Tsar occupying the left hand seat, with the Tsaritsa at his side. The Prince of Wales sat opposite his niece, and the Duke of Connaught sat opposite the Tsar. On taking her seat the Tsaritsa put up her umbrella, and amid tremendous cheering the carriages pro ceeded slowly along the dock. * * * * His Imperial Majesty wore the tall bearskin busby of the Scots Greys. The Tsaritsa had over her white costume a handsome cream-colored mantle, with a silver-embroidered cape; the nurse carrying the Grand Duchess Olga, a pretty, chubby baby, also in white. * * * * At Crathie Church the Royal party were met by the Queen’s retainers, numbering fifty-five and wearing the Royal Stuart tartan, and by about a hundred members of the Ballater and Crathie Vo- lunteer Corps of the Gordon Highlanders, bearing torches of split pine. * * * * Her Majesty, attended by her suite, and accom- panied by her family, received their Imperial Ma- jesties at the entrance to the Castle. The High- landers, with their flaming torches,, were drawn up in a semi-circle in front of the Castle, and the grounds were illuminated by the glare of the blaz- ing bonfire on Craig-Gowan heights. * * * * The Queen’s dinner party comprised the Empe- ror and Empress of Russia, the Prince of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, Princess Henry of Battenberg, the Duke and Duchess of York, the Duke of Cambridge, Princess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, and Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg. * * * * “God Save the Queen” has been played, sung, danced, and whistled all over the kingdom for all it was worth. Wednesday was a day of days, and notwithstanding the Queen’s expressed desire that no public notice should be taken of this event until the sixtieth year of her reign has been com- pleted in June next, telegrams poured into the Castle from all parts of the Empire. Corporations, associations, and individuals eagerly sought to lay their congratulatioas at the feet of the Sove- reign. * * * * There were meetings at the Mansion House and St. Paul’s. The Stock Exchange and London Com- mercial Salerooms sang the National Anthem as the clock struck noon. At the Baltic they sang it at 4 p.m. The Corn Exchange at 2.30. At the East London Exhibition Concert 5000 people stood up and sang it in the evening. The boys of the Board School, Bermondsey, sang it in the after- noon. At the Royal Aquarium it was sung at 1 p.m. At St. George’s Chapel, Windsor, it was sung at 12.30 p.m. Of course, all the theatres, concerts, and music halls sang it in the evening, and prior to the performance of the “Meistersing- er” at the Princess’s Theatre, Manchester, the mem- bers of the Royal Carl Rosa Opera Company, to- gether with the managing director, secretary and other officials, grouped themselves upon the stage round a bust of the Quen; and the National An- them was sung, the whole of the immense audi- ence joining in the last verse. Upon its conclu- sion ringing cheers resounded through the house, culminating in a scene of great enthusiasm. * * * * The Royal Standard floated on the breeze (nice old breeze it was, too, about eighty miles an hour) from all the public buildings, churches, chap — no, not chapels — theatres, the Tower, the railway stations, the hotels, the Savoy and the Cecil be- ing particularly demonstrative. Altogether it was a high old time. * * * * “Cymbeline” at the Lyceum is a triumph — for everybody except Shakspere, who, of course, is a mere detail. The poet is edited, expurgated, ar- ranged, and made into an “acting editor” by the actor manager; and, somehow, when you retire to turn over and again study your dog’s-eared “Shak- spere” you share with Mr. Gus. Elem that foggy feeling — you “dunno where you are.” * * * * Cloten’s “scene with a lady” is cut— all the bet- ter for the lady. The ghost scene in the pri- son cell of Posthumus is cut. No “Sicilius Leona- tus, father to Posthmus, an old man attired like a warrior, leading in his hand an ancient ma- tron — his wife, and mother to Posthumus— with musick before them.” No “Leonati, brothers to Posthumus, with wounds as they died in the wars.” Jupiter does not descend in thunder and lightning “sitting upon an eagle.” He does not “throw a thunderbolt,” and the ghosts do not “gibber,” which is all very sad. * * * * To tell the truth, the play went rather flat till the fourth act. When Imogen entered “as a boy” people began to sit up a bit. Ellen Terry, as Imogen, was simply Ellen Terry, and that was enough for the audience. Ellen Terry piquant, charming, unconventional, independent of ancient and musty “readings,” trusting to her heart and her instincts to portray her love for her lord. * * * * Her lord, indeed ! Both he and Iachimo ought to be strung up together. I think Posthumus is an entirely futile person. I’m perfectly certain that if Iachimo had absolutely won his wager, and Posthumus had gone to the Divorce Court for his remedy, also damages, the Sir Francis Jeune of that period would have put him out of court— “no case.” * * * * Sir Henry Irving’s Iachimo was another study in unconventionality, and caused the students of the old school to fidget their feet, to send interrogative glances to the right of them, and to the left of them, to elevate bushy eyebrows, and to drop down disapproving mouths. It was effective, though, and one cannot be always satiating one’s appetite by licking the bones of the past. But why made up like the Guide “Christus?” Anything more devlish than the character of Iachimo can scarcely be imagined. An epitome of all the vices, more es- pecially a liar of high degree. I hate a liar. * * * * Imogen’s dresses are symphonies of color and ex- pression. In the first act she wears a robe of won- drous fabric in an exquisite shade of dead China blue, and falling in loose, clinging folds from a yoke of shining golden tissue, bordered with turquoises, while, caught round the figure by a golden girdle, comes a drapery which shades from the palest yellow to the deepest and most beautiful violet. She wears a wreath of half-opened pink roses in her hair. * * * * In the famous scene with Iachimo a loose bodice of silver tissue is worn, with a clinging skirt and long flowing sleeves in purest white, showered with discs of gold, a shining drapery of gold and silver gauze shot with mauve veiling the back, and falling over the shoulders in front. Amethysts and turquoises are the jewels, and a wreath of apple blossoms crowns the head. * * * * In the bedroom scene the bed is canopied with draperies of silver tissue, and Imogen lies beneath a coverlet of palest blue and yellow, wrought with gold. * * * * The journey to Milford Haven is taken in a loose robe of darkest and yet most vivid blue, concealed by a long cloak of sober brown. And the last pic- ture of all gives us the loveliest boy imaginable, in a suit of soft, dark- green, and a cloak relieved by gleams of paler coloring. * * * * Nice sort of bills Imogen must have run up at the local Hordern’s and Mark Foy’s of that period, to say nothing of the jeweller and florist. * * * * Among those present were Miss Braddon, Mr. Thaddeus, Sir Frederick Abel, Mr. Henry Arthur Jones, Mr. A. W. Pinero, Mr. Bernard Partridge, Mr. W. S. Willard, Mr. Seymour Lucas, Mr. Onslow Ford, Professor Dewar, Mr. G. A. Redford, the Poet Laureate, Mr. Burnand, Mr. Theodore Watts, Mr. Farjeon, Mdlle. Van Zandt, Mr. Stefano Gatti, Miss Marion Terry, Mr. Burne Jones, Mr. Calmour, Mr. J. M. Barrie, Mr. B. Barnato, Sir George Lewis, Mr. Alma Tadema, the Marchioness of Granby, &c.; * * * * Fancy, people being at the pit doors at 7.45 a.m., sitting on camp stools, bringing their knitting and their newspapers, their sandwiches and pocket flasks. In the afternoon Mr. Bram Stoker sent tea to the ladies. And after all, the pit, at 7.45 p.m., was not overcrowded. A friend of mine went and got stand- ing room at that hour. The “pit full” board had been out for ever so long. * * * * My friend says: Next to me were standing two countrymen dreadfully annoyed at not getting a seat. I said they could hardly expect it on a first night, and they ought to consider themselves lucky to be there at all. “First night! why this piece has been going a couple of months,” was the reply. “My brother saw it in July when he was up here.” * * * * They thought they were at the Gaiety seeing “My Girl.” They did not consider the piece up to the broker’s report. “No singing and not near enough dancing — dashed dull.” * * * * Wednesday was the autumnal equinox, and cele- brated accordingly. A letter from Bexhill-on-Sea, dated September 23, will give an idea of what a time loiterers by the sea are having: “Another awful night, blowing a hurricane, pouring with rain, we had the greatest difficulty in reaching the Kursaal. About fifty or sixty people present (there were only fifteen on Monday). The wind blew so, we thought the Kursaal would come down. All the carpets had been taken up, and the sea came through the floor. Coming home we left our hats in the cloak-room, borrowed two bath towels of the attendant, and rolled them round our heads. We had an umbrella, which we carried carefully ‘shut up’ ” * * * * It is whispered there is a little rift in a certain seaside lute. * * * * Being in a certain Palace of Varieties the other night I heard Mr. Charles Morton say to a lady, “Oh, nonsense! Why, she’s his cousin.” “What’s that?” asked I. “Oh, nothing! Gossip!” said he. “Well, I adore gossip,” said I. “So tell me immediately.” “Well, Mrs. —— tells me that the So and So of Blank has taken too much notice of Marguerite Corneille, and there’s the deuce to pay. Rubbish! Why, everybody knows she is the granddaughter of the Marchioness of Blankly, and his cousin. I’ve no patience with such cacklers,” says “The Governor,” sniffing violently and virtuously. * * * * Marguerite Corneille, reported 15, looks 18, is a pretty piquant little girl, with a pretty piquant French accent, a pretty little figure, and pretty little feet (bien chaussee). She appeared last Christmas in the Drury Lane panto. After that she went to the “Palace,” and made rather a hit, utilising her pretty piquant French accent in a song called “Pardon? I Do Not Onderstand,” the refrain of which is — “Pardon, M’sier; pardon, Madame; I do not onderstand. For mon Anglais, est si mauvais, I do not onderstand.” * * * * It is a pity, but la belle Marguerite does not have good health, and a fashionable West End medico is in constant attendance, and they do say that— but there, of course, one’s doctor don’t count. * * * * H.R.H. is to be magnificent this winter in flow- ered silk waistcoats, real old-fashioned flowered silk waistcoats. They are not to be too loud, just loud enough. One of his prettiest patterns is a black satin, with a waved and -watered figuring and small design in berries in dark heliotrope. For evening dress he has. selected a rich white gros grain, with a white rosebud device in satin. * * * * “Too much Congo and too little Middle Temple” was Mr. Plowden’s remark at Marlborough-street, in dismissing, with a caution, a gentleman charged with obstruction outside the Cafe Monico, who said he was a barrister, and had just returned from the Congo. * * * * Cardinal Vaughan’s brother, whose death has been recently recorded, was known ecclesiastically as Father Jerome, and was one of the three youn- ger sons of the late John Francis Vaughan, of Courtfield, Monmouthshire. He has been the Prior of St. Peter’s Mission at Chorlton, near Manchester, and was the founder of the Gregorian Order, and also of the Scottish College of St. Benedict * * * * Well, her Grace the Duchess of Coolgardie has made her bow to the public, but with, I am afraid, only a medium success. The piece is found uncon- vincing, artificial, and like anything in the world, except Australia. * * * * Miss Hilda Spang, I am pleased to say, has most decidedly caught on, and all sorts of successes are predicted for her. Her personal beauty, her sweet voice, her sensitiveness, her dramatic power, are all enlarged upon. And she is already spoken of as “The Australian Actress.” * * * * The first night’s receipts were to be devoted to the “Sir Augustus Harris Memorial Fund,” but up to now we have not heard what they were. Of course, every woman is curious— no, not curious — inquisitive. The greatest physiologists tell you that directly a female thing is born she developes in- quisitiveness, and keeps on at it till she dies. Well, I’m a female thing, and want to know “How much?” * * * * My friend the “Pelican” says: “There is a Duchess of Coolgardie at Drury Lane, and & Duchess of Cool- gardie Gold Mining Syndicate in the books of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies. This looks as if Mr. Coleman had gone to the City for his title, or the City had gone to Drury Lane. Now, which is it?” * * * * * I wonder if you know any anything of “Vanoni the Versatile” down your way. Well, she is “une chanteuse excentrique;” not too young — just young enough. She made a great furore at the Alhambra with the “Boulanger March,” in the Boulanger year. She is popularly supposed to be of French extraction. In reality she belongs to a family of celebrated American athletes. When she leaves London she is also popularly supposed to climb the Swiss mountains, and on the topmost peak to find her (supposititious) Swiss chalet, where, standing on a little wooden balcony, wearing a tall Swiss hat, she, “calls the cows” with a horn, and assisted by a locally manufactured “box of noises” she (still sup- posititiously) “In ral li a tees,” and “yodels” from early morn till dewy eve. * * * * Now, as a matter of fact, Beach-street, Boston, U.S.A., would be a sure find for her. * * * * Well, Vanoni, the vocal, has been to Holloway— for not paying her income tax. Taken from her “Ox- ford,” her “Tivoli,” and lots of other nice things that are hers, to the cold cell of the contumacious. * * * * Speaking of her trip to Holioway (where she went in her own brougham) she said: “I have been there eighteen hours. From 8 o’clock till 10 I sit in my nice little cell with my brown bread, and my tin thing— it is a can, that is it — full of water. Ah! I don’t want to go to prison again. The time seemed awful long, so I thought I would sing. I did sing. I sang boleros and all sorts of songs— French, Spanish, Italian, Eng- lish, and American, all my repertoire. Suddenly, I listen. I hear footsteps. Pom, pom, pom! It is so bad for my nerves; so sudden. I have a shock. It is the matron. And what do you think she say to me, after all my beautiful singing, my whole repertoire? She says, ‘Hush your noise! Remember you are a prisoner.’ It is infamous!” * * * * Mrs. Bernard Beere is seriously, if not danger- ously, ill. * * * * Fancy! Bessie Bellwood being dead. I re- member going to the Royal a long time ego to hear her sing a certain celebrated song of hers. But her turn came, and was over, but not the song I wanted. I sent round, and she came on in a wrong costume. and the band “vamped” and the audience roared, and so did I, at the wonderful and natural comi- calities of “Wot Cheer Kid.” * * * * Miss Olga Nethersole leaves for America on Oc- tober 3. On November 9 she opens under the management of Messrs. Charles and Daniel Froh- mann at Brooklyn (three weeks), then Boston (one week) with Mr. Joseph Hatton’s “When Greek Meets Greek,” and M. Portan-Riche’s play, “Le Passe,” in which Mme. Sarah Bernhardt will appear in Paris. Miss Nethersole will then tour the States till Christ- mas, when she will appear at the Empire Theatre, New York. She will be supported by an American company with these exceptions — Mr. Robert Pateman, Miss Alexes Leighton, and Miss Henrietta Watson, who accompany her. * * * * The “Haymarket” Theatre is being splendidly “got- ten” up, as our American cousins say. Messrs, Harrison and Maude have arranged October 15 as their opening day — I mean night. The piece is “Under the Red Robe,” an adaptation by Mr. Edward Rose, of Mr. Stanley Weyman’s popular novel. The following is the disposition of the principal charac- ters: Mile. de Cocheforat .................. Miss Winifred Emery Mme. de Cocheforet.................. Miss Eva Moore Gil de Berault............................ Mr. Herbert Waring Captain Larolle.......................... Mr. Cyril Maude Henri de Cocheforet ................. Mr. Frederick Harrison Cardinal Richelieu..................... Mr. Valentine SYNOPSIS OF SCENERY. Act I. — Paris: Zaton’s Gambling House (introduc- ing the duel and the heat and fever of the marked cards). Acts II. and III. — In and about the Chateau de Coche- foret, Auch, in the department of Gers. Act IV. — Paris again: In Richelieu’s Palace. * * * * Mr. Edward Rose is like the gentleman who black- ed himself all over for “Othello.” Not finding him- self sufficiently saturated by his author, he passed the spring at Gere, in the South of France, imbibed local color to an alarming extent, and came back to England looking like a beetroot when it is boiled. * * * * Miss Julia Neilson is to play Rosalind to the Or- lando of Mr. George Alexander. * * * * I send you a verse from an apropos ballad by Dagonet: See, the mud is gaily flying Right and left along the road Where the char-a-bancs are trying For a saturated load. Side by side we’ll ride together, Mud bespattered, cold and wet, Let me just say “—— the weather!” And we may be happy yet.
