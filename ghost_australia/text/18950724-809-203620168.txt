PL A YING THE GHOST. Some creature with a diabolical disposition and a stook of sulphur has beon appearing at unexpected corners of suburban streets lately I and scaring tiio wits out of solitary pedestrians with very mundane tricks in the guise of a ghost. It " has appeared at Collingwood, and after destroying tho hnlcyoiv bliss which the connubially inclined hnve hithsrto found in the shaded seclusion of Victorial'arkafter sundown, ! has ventured into the open streets. The local polico have received reports of three scares in Victoria Park on Sunday night, and ono in Hotham-stroet, at the corner of Blanche-street, on Mondny night. A lad named Robt. Win. Brown, aged 12 year, of 52 Mator-stieet, was on his way homo from night school at 9.30, and was suddenly confronted by a man whoso " breastplate " revealed, with a phosphorescent glow the appalling words, "Prepare to meet | thy doom," while a sepulchral voice announced a malign intont to cut off the poor shaking boy's head "in two shakef," This threat caused the boy to race home, screaming as he tan and fol lowed by what lie lias described as "the object." Several persons were attractod by his cries, and the "ghost's" materialised feot clattered with most utighostly noise acrors tho footway and over a vacant piece of hind out of sight. Tho Acting Governor, when' speaking at Fitzroy a week ago, told his audience that ho knew of no better remedy for peregrinating vagabonds than the horo pond, wiiuro available. It was old fashioned, but effectual. .A course of such treatment would doubtloss put this perturbed spirit to rest.
