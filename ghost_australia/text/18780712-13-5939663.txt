PARLIAMENT. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. Thursday, July 11. In the absence of the Speaker, Mr James, Chairman of Committees, took the chair at half past 4 o clock PETITIONS Mr Ditter presented a petition from residents at Port Campbell, asking for a survey of the port and tho constiuction of a jetty The Deputy Speaker ruled that the petition could not be received, ns containing a request for money contrary to the standing orders Mr Mason presented a petition from Narracan in favour of an amendment of the Land Act COMPENSATION TO RAILAVAY OrriCERS Mr SERVICE asked the Treasuier Avhen tile officers dismissed from tho R ulway de portaient mi0ht expect their compensation money' Mr BrRRY replied that the bon member was no doubt aware that the officers of the Railway department were not under the Civil bery ice Act, and consequently, no money was appropriated for them He how ever, waa prepoicd, if no objection were taken, to pay compensation to those officers out of the funda to be mode a\ ailablo by the Supply Bill on lucsday next, asking the House afterwaids to pass the votes ART UNION L0TTE1UL3 In reply to Mr Kwívot, ' feir BRYAN O LOGHLEN saul that aa soon as he could, aftei taking ofhco, lie had c i'lc I the attention of the police authorities to these so-called art unions, w inch wore in Ins opinion illegal, and simple evasions of the law The police warned the \aiious paities carrying on these lotteries that unless they ceased at once, and refunded the money they had received, a prosecution would be uisti tuted against them by the Crown He be lieved thc3e art unions had ceased to collect money The present act was fairly sufficient if put into operation to prevent these lot tenes, but he would be prepared, if neces gary, to toko any fuither legislation to secme that object DRAAVBACK REGULATIONS Mr SERVICE asked the Commissioner of Customs when the new drawback regulations under tho recent Customs Act would bo ready to be put m force ' 1 he Customs Act, winch provided for very considerable amelior atioiiAv ith respect to one great disadvantage under which the meicantile community laboured, a w , in respect to drawbacks on imported goods, had been passed six months since, but the drawback regulations had not yet been issued The mercantile community xvere anxiously waitm_ foi them Mr LALOR said that the principal leason for the delay was that a change of duties bad been made on sex eral articles from a lower to a higher rate, and under drawback legnlations merchants would be enabled to obtain on gooda upon which they had paid perhaps only 10 per cent, diawback at the rate of 20 per cent, which would not be faur to the cus toms Mr SrRVICE -Tho=c might have been excepted Mr LALOR -There was a large number of such items A change had also been made in some instances to fixed duties It had therefore been deemed desirable that those regulations should not come into force until time had elapsed sufficient to work off the goods in stock The regulations had now been printed, and would in a very ahoit time be issued Ile might remind the bon mern ber that until the present Government took office not a Bingle step had been taken to nasist the mercantile community (Laughter ) DIAMOND DRILLS In reply to Mr Cooper, Major SMITH said that the diamond drills were sent from America about June 1, and might be expected to arrive here at tho end of August or the beginning of September RAILAVAY SIGNALS Mr JOHNSTONE asked the Commis Bioner of Railwa)s whether ho would take immediate steps to cause signals to be placed m railway carriages by means of which the guaids in charge of the tram may be comrau wcated with in case of emergency' Mr AVOODS said that the reason this had not been dono was that the rolling stock waa bo changed about, and moved from one part of the hues to others, that unless all the rolling stock were fitted up, little good would result. Mixed trams were also ian, which Avould necessitate the apparatus being affixed to tho goods trucks as avcII The system might be tried on the Gipps Land line, where there avos a distinct rolling stock There was no difficulty m providing communication , either the electric bell oi the American sys tem of wirepulling might be adopt»d, or where the continuous bieak waa used the motive power for the break might be utUised for tbiB purpose There was some danger of the apparatus being injured wilfully by lai nkin passengers, of whom even now, and especiall) m the first-class carriages, great < omplamtB liad to be made T he depaitment, however, would not overlook tins matter SANDHURST POS1' On ICE In reply to Mr AI'Intyre, Mr BERRY saul that he was informed that the public buildings at Sandhurst used for the purpose of post, telegraph, money order, savings bank, and sub treasury offices, xvere practically sufficient for the accora inodation of buaineas Local matters of this kind ought to be dealt with at the depait- ment, and not brought befoie the House MINOR SCHOOLS Mi RICHARDSON moved that there be laid before tins llonse a leturn showing the number of schools with an average atten- dance of less than 30, airo Hie clossification of tcachciB emplo)ed ni them Agreed to GOULBURN VALLEY RAILAVAY Mr A\ OODS moved for leave to bring in a bill to authorise the construction by the state of a line of lailwaj, to be called the Goulburn A'alley Raihvaj Agicod to 'ine bill was read a fiist time, and the second reading fixed foi Tuesday next DAYLL&rORD; RAILAVAY Mr AVOODS moved for leaAe to bung m a bill to amend the Railway Construction Act, 1877, so far as it related to the constiuction of tho Daj leaford line ! Mr SERVICE said that in view of tlio \ ery interesting statements made concerning the Bttn e}s Ot this line by the Minister of Rail -ways the previous evening he hoped that on the second reading of this measure the House xvould he placed m possession of full inform ation on the subject It should be made clear u hy the original line had been surv C) ed, and whether the new line passed by any centres of settlement AU the engineering authority obtainable should be given as well as estimates of the traffic &.c It w aa a most unusual thing, after the House had assented to one line, thua to propose a change of route, and it would seem that some one must have been to blame in making the ongtiul suive) He hoped that reports tiom the lesponsible officers of the department would be ob tamed Mr GAUNSON thought the lemaiks of the lion member for Maldon were entitled to Borne attention The House was now aaked, after authoiismg one line of lailvva), it was to be presumed after due consideiation, to change it foi another No doubt tho Minister of Railways waa the obleat engineer fin and away tlio colony iiad ever aeon, but still it was dcauable when the House was asked to adopt tins coarse that full information should bo given Mr MASON hoped the Minister of Hail avays yvould tell the House when the Gipp3 Land line would be connected with tlio metropolis-a much moro important matto than any now on the notice paper Mr GAUNSON submitted that any refer- ence to the Gipps Land line was at present out of order. Mr MASON hoped that his question would be answered. Mr FINCHAM wished to offer some obser- vations on the proposed alteration of the Dalesford line. Mr. F. L. SMYTH said it was most unusual to debate a bill on the motion for leave to introduce it. The DEPUTY SPEAKER -It would be out of order to discuss the general system of railways as the hon. member for South Gipps Land proposed to do, but I have no power to stop a discussion on the Daylesford line. Mr FINCHAM objected to any alteration of a lineof railway which was authorised by Parliament last session after due considera- tion, and which ought to have been com menccd long ago Hie convenience ot a lut"e population would be altogether ljiioicdif the llaylesfoid line was iltetcd m tlio wa) that the Munster of 1 ailw a) s w mted 1 hey had been told by the Mimstei of I ailways m au otherplace that the supporteisof theGovcrn ment would have to aceej t their scheme na a Avholo or lcject it as a whole No member who had any respect foi himself ot the elis triet he lcprcscnted would icccpt this doctrine, but maintain his right to object to details that he disapproved of lie desuetl to be informed yvliethci any provision had been made m the altpjcd hue Sos the con vcmenco of the largo population of the dis- trict, Mr RICHARDSON had no doubt that all the information lion members required would be produced at the proper time He regretted the manifestation of temper that they had just witnessed Mr WOODS -It is nothing else Mr GAUNSON-You have no right to make such an assertion Mr FINCHAM rose to order no might have been irritated but tho lion member by whom he was challenged had been guilty of a gross exhibition of ill temper in another place, and that might bo soma oxcuse for what he (Mr Fincham) had said Mr RICHARDSON withdrew his remark He had no doubt it would be found at tho proper time that full provision had been made for the wants of the population of the distuct The original lino ran too near the top of tho dividing range The Mm'ster of Railways proposed to alter it at ono place, and afford the population greater accommodation than they would have obtained had the first project been carried out. Mr KERFERD said that tho remarks of the lion member for Creswick had remov 1 from his mimi an unpleasant impression cieated by the recent statement of the Minister of Railways, namely, that the on gmenrs had blundered I ho Chan_e np parently had been made not on account oE a blunder but as a matter of policy Ono word from the Munster of Railwaj s would set tlio doubt at rest Ho quito agreed with the Munster of Railwajs tbat it was inexpedient to constrnct lines with a steeper gtadient than 1 m 50 Mr SLRVICE hoped that a sketch plan would bo prepared to show the nature of the deviation (Hear, hear ) Mr DIXO^ thought the icmarks of the bon member foi the Ovens cleaily proved that discussion at the present stage w as tin dcsuablc Mi AVOODS saul if he had anticipated that lion members would havo wanted fall in formation to day he would havo co ne pre paicd to supply it, but he understood that the sitting was to beset apart for the bust nesB of pnv ate members, and he did not wish to deprive them of one minute of their time He should be piepnrcd to answer all ques tions and objections when the proper time carne Ihe motion was agreed to The bill was then brought m and read a first time MUNICIPAL LOANS Sir DAA'Yl Rmoiedforaroturnshowing the amounts borrowed by and total pieseutmdebt cdness of local bodies in the colony (including those of Melbourne and Goolong), and speci f j mg m îespect of each of such loans tho date, duration, purpose, amount, rate per cent, security, and amount of principal and interest (if any) paid off in reduction It wnB the expressed intention of the Govern- ment to propose to raise a loan this session He thought that the House should not only be made acquainted with the indebtedness of tho colony as a whole, but of the obligations in curiedby tho portions under local govern ment Mr MASON seconded the motion Mr LAURENS did not see how the local bodies could bo compelled to furnish the in formation asked for The clerks and score taries of the municipalities were asked to do a gieat deal too much work for the Govern- ment, fiom whom they received no remunera tion Mr COOPER said that the loans incurred by local bodies were borrowed only on the property that they could assess, and in no way on the security which the Government had to oiler when they w ent into the London market The motion was agreed to GRANTS TO RELIGIOUS BODIES Mr NIMMO moved for-1 A return of all lands granted for church and school purposes, specifying the denominations, in the colony of Victoria, previous to separation from New South AA'aies 2 A return of all lands granted for church and school purposes, specifjmg tho denominations, cities, towns, parishes, Le , from the inauguration of re sponsible government up to the time of tlio passing of the State Aid Abolition Act He said that a íeturn of this sort was ordered in 1830, and a,am m 185S T he difficult portion of the work had been already done, and the balance of tho information could be easily supplied Mr ZOX thought that the country ought not to be put to the expense of furnishing returns like this, unless good reason could bo shown Air LONGMORE saul he thoroughly agreed with the hon member for East Mel bourne that returns should not be asked for when their prenaiation would be expensive and they would probably be of little value This return, however, he could state, would cost very little, and therefore the Govern mont w ould not oppose the motion The motion was then agiced to R] DUCTION OT POSTAGE Mi L L SAI1TII moved the following le solutions - "1 I bat, in the opinion of this House, the postage upon all letters delivered witlim the colony of Victoria shall be at the uniform rate of one penny 2 That all newspapers printed and published in this colony should be post fiee, and that they should leav e the colony by rail or steamer free Ile said th m it was unnecessary for lum to quote many statistics m support of these lesolutions, as he had brought them forward at different times prev îouslj ,and thestatistic3 would be found in tho reports of Ins îemarks on those occasions Most likely he would bo met now, as he had been before, with the îeply that the pi03ent was not the proper time to bung forvvard this matter The present, however, was just the right time to do so, as the session was only just commenced, and the financial arrangements of the Treasurer had not been declared Besides, as the Gov ernor s speech had stated that the finances of the colony w ere in a healthy condition, there should not be tho slightest hesitation on the part of the Government-if the Ilouse de culed that m its opinion there should bo a reduction of the postage-to carry out its wishes It might be said that on financial mounds a reduction of the postage in the large towns would be preferable to a unifoim reduction throughout the colonj, but the fact waa, as had been shown bj Sir Rowland Hill, the main cost was not m the cnrrjmgof letters, but m their receipt and dehveimg, oi m other words the "handling The diffeience between theoo3tof transmit ting letters long and short distances could haidly be expressed by the smallest fraction of a penny He could not conceive how the members of the present Ministry could oppose tins motion, as when in opposition Mesara Deny, Longmore, Patterson, audAIajoi Smith had all expressed their approval of the exist mg postage rates The effect of the last re duclion on the postage of letteu from id to 2d was seen in the increase in the nnmber of lettei s distributed fiom 6,000,000 ni 1800 to 18,000 000 m 1S77, and there was no doubt that if the postage were uniformly reduced still further, as he proposed, there would be a piolit on the cainago of letters instead of a loss In Sjdney there was a peuny postage in the city, and he was informed that it was highly remunerative to the revenuo, and helped considerably to swell the po*al re venue Tho atguments used for reducing the postage on letters applied also to the abolition of the postage of newspapers The postage on newspapers was reduced in 1873, and the consequence was that the number of papers distributed by post in creased from 3 000,000 in 1873 to 7,000,000 m 1877 A strong argument in favour of the reduction of the postage was that m thi3 colony we had entailed enormous expense in -Stablishingasystem of stateeducation foi the joimg, and therefore everything partaking of the chaiacter of a tax upon knowledge should bo obohshed as far as possible A schoolboj, if there weie a penny postage, would havo a chance of frequently commuuicuting with his friends, which ho might not enjoj in all cases with a twopenny postage Mr RAMSAY -He w ould prefer to spend the penny m marbles Mr L L ¡.MIHI-No doubt tho bon membei ni his school daj s might have dono so, which accounted for his not exhibiting more intellectual culturo now (laughter), but all 8choolbojs should not be judged from one example He maintained that, with a state scliool system so extensive and ev pensive tis ours (although no one grudged the expense), it was mast in ougutott- to place a heavy tax upon knovv'ed^e such its existed in the present inte of post ye Atone time it was stud the ptoposed îeduc tion would onlj beucht the merchants, in fact, the vvoalthj clns3e3 But that aiBument could se neely be advanced now ns

question to a Meat ovtent was out of »«vernie It was true that tbo total postal and telegraphic revenue increased from £223,000 ni 187b to £240,000 m 1877 , but still, in 1877 the net cost of the department xvos £95,467 He was not prepared to sup port with much energy that portion of the lion member s rematka relative to the educational benefita to bo derived from carrying newapapera free of charge AYIulo the bon member waa delivering hia well considered speed), for matonee, the repre- sentatives of the newspapers were not re Sorting him , and, under the circumstances ehaduoubts aa to whether these organs did really educate the people (Laughter ) Since he last spoke on this subject, his viovva aa to the educational influence of newspapers had undergone a certain amount of chango m a conservative direction, and if newapapera continue in tho future to follow the s uno path tiiey had pursued in the pa3t, ho should abandon altogethci his former belief that thoy were educating the people He found they were occaaionally fined, and justly fined in the law courts for abusive libels, and how could he say conscientiously they were educators of the people' Considering what a loss the state waa going to be in a oh ed m through tho purchase of a milray that he need not moro particularly refer to, ho didn t see any reaaon why the much smaller los3 that the carrying of the motion might entail should be a har to its adoption Moreov or, the reduction of tho letter postage would be a tremendous benefit to husmeas people But newspapers disaeminatcl enough libels already without being carried through the post free Mr BERRY stated that he gave tlio lion member for Richmond credit for the persis tencj and ability with which lie advocated these changea No bon member would be disinclined to accept the proposed rc'orin if the state of the revenue would justify it but there w ero two obatacles to the passage of the motion now One of them was the eirly period in the aession at winch it was pro posed Ile avos informed by inoinorAnuum irom tile Post and Telegraph députaient that the proposed alterations would involve a loss of revenue m the first j ear of £03,000 A proposal involving such a Joss wis not one that ought tobo submitted by a private mein bei, but should, if it was deemed desirable to adopt it, be included in the Treasurers finan cial Bcheme He was sorry to have to ob serve further that he did not think, from tlio knowledge he liad of the present state of the finances, that ho would be able to idyls'1 tlie Houae to incur that loaa when he did make his fnancinl statement Mr L L SAIITH-The estimated loss is increasing Last time it was £J0 000 Mi BERRY-Probably the lion member ivas referring to a modified proposition con ceiinng newspapers only, previously male At all events, the memorandum waa signed by the deputy postmaster general, and it must be taken for granted that the los3 would be £08,000 in the firat )ear At the Bame time he believed that this official retain w as based upon the reduction some } eara ago of postage from 4d to 2d , and that was not a fair basis on wh "h to estimate w hat a re lue tion from 2d to Id Avould result in In other words, so far as postage ivas concerned, 2d didn t bear the same relation to Id that Id bore to 2d If postage was reduced to Id aa proposed, there would bo probably a vast increase m the number of letters sent throuf h the post office Many commutnea tiona would be sent through the poat then that were not now sent The increase, in fact, in the number of letters would bo very much larger m proportion than that caused by the îeduction from 4d to 2d At the Bame time the expenditure would bo much larger Mr L L SAfITn -No Mr BERRY-ne was expressing his own opinion If we were to have this univoiaal letter Airiting, increased accommodation m the shape of country post-ofiiccs would have to be provided In fact, a laiger fillip would be given to the expenditure than to the revenue Moreover, since the lion member first brought forward his proposition much better postal facilities than previonsl) exiated had been afforded to tho public The memo he had referred to, which was signed by the deputy postmaster general, was as follows - "In the event of the above (namely, the motion) being carried into effect, tho esti mated immediate loss to the îevenue would be for tile fiist year 1 On inland letters £10 000 2 On liciygpajicni 19,000 Or, In all, for tlio first j cir £03 000 It is alao eatimated that the revenue of the Post-office would not recover itself for nine j

member of this guevnnce, because he Avould raise another one instantly, but if the lion member wis Treasurer for a short time he would look at Buch matters in a different manner He would then find

number of post oflices, and also the districts in which deliveries took place and generally aug ment postal facilities, than to adopt a reform which, however desirable m tlieor), xvould certainly cripple for many yeais to come the progress of the colony (CheerB ) In older countries an increaaed postal business did not necessarily involve such a large proportional increase in expendí tuie as would have to be incurred hero Wo had to be constantly providing here altogether new accommodation In 1873, we erected 53 new post-ofiiccs , m 1874, 38 ni 1875, 53, in 1870, 31 . and in 1877, C2 On this point he might add that it would be surely bettor to cía e postal accommodation to tho3e country districts which had none, than to make a re auction in postal charges for the benefit of

" Hear, hear ) When asked w hy Mr Kelly, the ln=hest tenderer, should not be allowed the ora ortumty of including this condition also, the Munster replied that that would bo ?ivirg to lum the benefit of Mr Levi s idea le appiehended that this could not be ac cepteal)} the House as a suflicient explana tion of a course which really stniek at the principle of tendering altogether, and which, if persisted m, would result in a return to the old sjstem m vogue at one time m Great Brita n of .a Munster giving contiacts at Ins own will and pleasuie If other thm the low est orhighest tender, as the case might be, vv as to be accepted because pto visions were m eluded not inserted m the published condi Mons, then anj departure fiom a tender might be justified The Minister of Railwijs was establishing a most dangerous piecedent It might be said that this was not a matter for Parliament to mterfeie ni, but ho might mention that tho House of Commons had not considered it beneath its dignity to in quire into the causes of the suspension of a common letter carrier when a bona, fide case for inquiry was made out He hoped that the Munster of Railvvajs would not treat the House ni the cavalier and ungentlemanhke mannet that he treated peisons who visited his department on public business, as he had on one occasion ticated lum (Mr Dvvjer) Mr TYTHrRLEIGHseconded the motion Troin what ho knew of the Muustei of Kail ways he was smethathe (Mr Woods) was not capable of doing an} thing dishonest, and he merely seconded the motion to afford tho hon gentleman an oppoitumty to explain Mr A\OODS said that this was one of hose milk scores with which it was scarcely worth while to tiouble the Ilouse when it had grave matters under it3 attention ne had exercised his judgment and discretion m connexion with the tenders for the benefit of the depaitnient and the public Ile might be allowed to know a little more about tenders than the lion and learned membei who had just addressed the House During the last 12 montliB he had had to deal with contracts to the amount of ovei a million of monej, and the lion and learned member with his microscope had discoveied that there had been a loss-which was only an ap pat entone-throti-htlioacceptanee of a tendel 11 0 lowei than the one sent in by his (the lion members) friend Tho lion and learned member had frequently come to lum (Air Avoods) AVhenever there was anj little bit of business to bo done the bon and learned member had somebody to mtioduce AVIiat did it mean when i membei ot Pailiament brought a contractor befoio the tendéis weie opened, and asked the Minister who had to deal with thamtogivehtscbentfavourablecon Bidcrntion ' AA h it did it mean ' (Mr Dw v. i r \- 'I never did I asked foi justice ) I ho lion and learned member came before the tenders were opened and asked for parlicnliti considération for lim client the ton derç were for the rcfrcshment-iooms It vv is wcl' known that the railway refreshment rooms had been badly conducted m tho past. He (Mr A\ oods) expressed Ina determination that the British travelling public should be properly fed, and reserved to himself the right to decido who should get the rooms He got a number of new conditions drawn up, and they were of a very binding character Mr Hosie, Avho was considered a competent authority, furnished the deportment with a list of tho things xvlnch the contractor ought to Bupply and tho prico ho ought to charge Tenders were called for m three Avaja-for individual stations, for each of the principal groups of Btations, and for the Avholo of the stations One of the tenderers was Mr Kelly, the friend of the hon and learned member It was to him, apparently, that he (Air AVoods) had been uncivil He Avas not aware that ho had been, uncivil He supposed it was his manner no had a great deal to do, and he considered that his timo at the office ought to bo devoted to public business AVhen, therefore, tho hon and learned member sat down and produced lots of letters asking for billets for men, ho was very likely to be a little abrupt, but he deuied that ho had been iniciv ii to any man The tender of Mr Kelly for tlie refreshment-rooms waa not accepted, and that, he thought, waa where the shoo puiched Ho did not recollect who30 tender was accepted, but a number wero sent in The conditions were so strict that ho could fine any catcier who failed to give satisfac tion, and fine bim to such nn extent that ho would soon find the place too hot to stay there Should a caterer bo reported three times by tlie inspector Ins lease could be cancelled It Avould be Been from this that the public were thorou nly protected He hardly thought it would be worth willie to appoint a select committee to inquire into the matters, but the papera were in the House, and available for inspection Anj one who looked through thom would find i hat the responsible offieci, the assistanttrafiic manager, had recommended tlio acceptance of particular tenders \V bethel tile tender of the friend of the lion and learned member w ns on tlie list or not he could not say But tlie gross amount of the tenders recommended by the assistant traffic mnnac,ci was ¿1 300 less than the amount of the tenders actu lily accepted He did not act on the recommen dation, but went through tlie whole of tlie tendéis, and ho behoved that in every case lie selected the Inchest He knew lie could do so with sitety, because the conditions would enable lum to pro vent tlie contractors from playm_ any more tricks on tlie public Had he wished to accept any tendera but tlie highest, lion members would Bee he could have done so in this case, on the recomraendution of the re sponsible officer of the department, but he did not do so Four or five tenders wero re ceiAcd for tho bookstalls lhey ranged m amount from £G00 to £150 but only two could be considered, one of £000 and ono of £450 He Avas free to admit that the person whose tender amounted to £000 had some leason to complain, and he (Mr AA'oods) might have committed an errol of judg ment when he accepted the lower tender But tlio lower tender was accompanied with an offer to establish a circulating library along the whole of the railw ly lines lie knew that a circulating library would produce some good effects, apart from the circum Btance that the railway department would make bornetlung out of the carriage of parcels of books to and fro, for books taken to Bal- larat oi AVodonca would have to be sent back to Melbourne The tendeier wished to get tho books carried free m the a au, but he refused therequcst, and named rates which would fully makeup the apparent los3 of £150 per annum He stipulated that a list of the books should be furnished to the Railway department for approval, as a precaution that none of an im- proper character should be carried It struck lum that books would not only havo a good educational effect on travellers but provide them with emplojment, ond thus prevent them from destroying the interior of the cor- ría-es m the way they did at present He took these motters into consideration when he dealt with the tenders An Hon Member -AVhy did you not men- tion them m the specifications ' Mr A\ OODS -Because lie did not think of them in time He thought tlio advantages offered with tlie second tender wero xvorth more than the ¿loO a ) ear which would be

but the lion gentleman hod made a mistake and ought to admit it No preference should bo given to one man over another The sugges lion of which the lion gentleman thought so much was made to the

conditions Avhich had not been ad vertisccl, and exercise his choice m an arbi trary manner, honest tovernmnnt would at once be sapped at the root This was not a slight motlei, and the Minister of

than the original sub- ject demanded, he trusted the discussion would not bo without its uses at this early period of the session Concerning tlie ques- tion itself, he might say that ho held the opinion that a Minister of tlie Crown should purauo the uaual course in relation to tenders, exercising the discretion allowed to lum only in cases where the facts xvere clear, nndAv here his action would be supported by lailiament 'Hie ordinary rule was that the highest tendel, as in this instance, or the lowest in other cases, should be accepted, and that, he considered, was the proper course to follow (Hear, hear ) lie had heard of tins matter only in the one short com er8ation alluded to by the hon member (Mr Dvvjerj, in which he referred lum to the Minister of Railways, and if not satisfied, to Parliament T hat appeal was one he would claim himself, and which he vvasalvvajs piepored to allow to others The Minister of RailwnjB had explained his action had admitted that he might have made a mistake, and hod stated clearly that his object was to give the public certain conveniences which one lendeier had suggested, and which bad not before been thought of If his action on this occasion had been an isolated instance there might have been some ground for suspicion, but lion members should bear in mind that no ConiiniBBioner of Railways had acted on his own opinion and on his own knowledge as to what would benefit the public to the extent the present Minister had done, and they would then see that his action on this occa Bioii was onh consistent with his whole eon duct during his management of the railways He (Mr Beirj) considered that his colleague would have done better to have adhered to tlie rule of accepting the highest tender, but still it must be remembered that this was not au ordmory class of tenders In his opinion these tenders foi refreshments, book stalls, and other conveniences in connexion who lnilvvajs, were wrong in principle me public had to poy twice as much in increased prices as the Government oo ained by tho contracts The system simplj allov ed tlio most unscrupulous men to got a monopoly of the supply to the public The right couise

That bon member claimed to be a member of the part} Ho know that tho party had a great work to do, and that it could not bo done unless thcro was union Some consider- ation muBt bo shown to Ministers who under great difficulties wcro administering tho vanous departments of the state when that bon member could not bring a charge affecting tho honesty of the Administration, bow dia it ho in his mouth to do all he pos gibb could-fortunately very little-but all ho could to injure a Ministry that required «'l tho strength of the party to carry out the osïcj to windi tho lion member himself was as much pledged as the Government I ho night would not have been wasted if every lion member of the party would but remember that attacks such as this could end only m disaster, not only to the party, but to tho earnest and ardent hope of the country And concerning his colleague the Minister of Railwajs, he might tell him that no one dis lilted Ins manner more than ho (Air Berry) did While admitting that he managed the Hailwaj department energetically, honestlj, and more successfully in the interests of the public than any of his predecessors,} et he would say to his lion colleague, AVliy do you not niter tho way in which you receive members who, in the performance of their duty to their constituents, have to see j ou at your office, why cannot you tct towards them bko a gentleman and treat them courteously' His colleague must remember that the goodwill, the hearty co operation, and sometimes even the for- bearance of hon members wa3 necessary to the consolidation of tho party Let ins col- league give to others what he expected othors to give to him, and he would then gain the satisfaction of the whole party as well as that of the more prominent members of the Government Ho would then not only be doing himself justico and the state gool ser vice, but would be placmj ins position in tho House on a solid foundation, which nothing could shake No Government winch de pended on the cordial co operation of a large partj could expect such cordial co operation unless each individual member of tho Go- vernment treated all members of the party with courtesy and consideration on all occasions of public business He desired also to Baj a word or two on these accusations of corruption which were bandied about, not that they were believed, but for the purpose of irritation and annojance Mr GAUNSON. -lour Minister of Rail wnjs charged me in that wuj tonight, can that bo defended ' Sir BLUR- -No , I do not defend it Mr GAUNSON-I will walk into him whenever I get the chance Mr BLIU.Yhad been m office before, and liad now been head of the Government for 12 months He saw more menbers than all the rest of the Ministry, and he could honestly say til it no member of the party liad ever asked lum for anything that he might not have demanded m the face of tlie country or which he would have been ashamed to ask at anj public meeton" (Hear, hear ) I hat being so, why should they allow any men outside or any section of the press to charge them vv ith being corrupt, 01 with asking Ministers anything they were not openly prepared to av ow He hoped both the motion and the amendment would be withdrawn Mr A K SMITH desired to defend the Minister of Railwajs from the imputation ituond against lum that evemnj by the bon member for Arar it, and by members ot the Opposition on other occasions, in connexion with the tarred pipes at tho Malmslury resenoir He (Mr Smith) had been pro fesstonnlly engaged to report on that work, and lie believed that it was m consequence of his requiring tho outlet to be cleared that the discovery of these fractured pipes was made He was aware that Sir AVoods had immediately reported the matter to his supe tiorofhcer, who reported in his turn to the engineer in chief Ile therefore felt that it was most unjust that the Munster of Railwajs should constantly be taunted with doing that vv inch he had nev er intended to do, and he (Mr Smith) bad felt somev hat as if he were guilt} of cowardice in not having risen on prev lous occasions to defend him Ile be lievcd the lion member to be as straight forward a man as he knew There had been no attempt at concealment in the matter of the tarred pipes Iho tairing waa required to protect the pipes from oxidisation, and ho (Mr Smith) might as well be blamed for ordering the tarring of gaspipes for the same reason The cracltB m the pipes did no. aflcct their stabi lity anj more than a slight crack in the plaster of the ceiling of that chamber would endanger the stability of the building Mr MACBAIN regretted that tho session should have been commenced with personal altercations If asked vvhethei ho approved or disapprov ed of the action of the Minister of Railway s in the matter of the tenders, he should say ne condemned it Tue Minister of Railwajs bad admitted that lie might have done Mr Kelly an injustice At the Burne time he could not bj mpathi°e w ith the hon and learned member for Villiers and Hej tc3 burj, who swallowed the camel and now strained at the gnat Ile vv ent to the Mi ins ter of Railwajs before the tenders were O] ened, and should be the last man to now come forward with a complamt Mr DAV1FR- Ihe tenders had been received and, so fnr as 1 knew, had been opened I behev ed that they were opened, and that the Minister of Railwavs knew the con tents of them , of course, I don t know , that is roi belief Mr MACBAIN doubted if it was the duty of a member of Parliament to go with his client to a Alinister, even after tenders had been opened Mr GAUNSON-AMry say client' You know it is grossly unfnn Mr MACBAIN bad listened patiently to the serious charges made by tho lion mern bcr for Ararat and wished to be allow ed to proceed without interniption It was not tho duty of members of Parliament to use their inlluence m the w ay indicated by the lion and learned member for Villiers and Heytesbury If the client of the bon and learned member bad been successful Mr GAUNSON -Client Mr MACBAIN-If the constituent, or friend-the termB were synonymous-had been successful, nothing would have been heard of the case He trusted not only that the aduce of the Chief Secretary would bo taken by bon members, and that they would not interfere in matters like this, but that the usual sy stem of tendering would be adhered to This was the first time m Ins experience that ho had heard the head of a Government lee turo ono of bia own colleagues in the way that the Chief Secretary had lectured the Minister of Railways for his ungentleman uko hearing towards members of Parlm tuent Mr GAUNSON-Why interfere m the quarrelsof tho " happy family ' (Laughter ) Mr MACBAIN honed that the next timo the Chief Secretary found fault with ono of his colleagues, he would do it m private Had ho (Mr MacBain) been lectured as the Minister of Roilways was, ho would have flung his portfolio at the lectmer s head Mr ORR hoped the amendment would be withdrawn If the Ministry were not fit to ninnago small mutters, let thom be at-cl.ed on some large question Mr NIMMO contended that the offence committed by the Minister of Railways did not justify the prominence which had been gil en to it, or the strong language used One thing bad been oveilooked, that the hon gentleman during his term of office had given eeneral satisfaction to the public at large Jilear, hear ) He had been not only apainstak ing but an energetic officer, and sometimes tho amount of energy lie liad brought to bear on the execution of his duties had imparted to ns manner an abruptness which had been misinterpreted (Hear, hear) There could be no doubt that in this case ho had made a mistake, and should have called for fresh tenders AVliy did the ho.i and learned member for Villiers and Heytesbury visit tho Minister of Railway s on behalf of Mr Kelly' If the object was, as stated bj tho Minister of Railwajs, to influence a Minister of the Crown, and obtain a partict lui favour for Ins friend, it wits most mipio.icr It must havo been based on the belief that the Mmister of Hail« a} s was incapable of doing justice until w aited on by a member of Parliament If ho entertained a belief of that sort about me Minister of Railways he ought to havo divulged it long ago After a few words from Mr Bxim, Mr BAYLES said ¡that as some injustice liftd admittedlj been done

iskc why ho went to the Minister of Railways Ho went because Mr Kellj asked him to KO, and because Mr Kelly apprehended that a wrong would be dono to him, that he would not get justice, winch tlie event had proved. Mr. Kelly was under the impression that the officers of the department would poison the mind of the Munster against him, nnd that he would not get justice The Minister of Railwajs had mentioned that ho (Mr Dvvjer) had poid Aisits to the Railway department about billets He had been obliged to go to the department several times, ana went reluctantly On two occa- sions he saw the Munster about billets ap plied for by his constituents-who, by tlio bjc, did not get thom Ile for one av ould be heartily glad if Ministers would issue a regu lotion prohibiting members of Parliament from visiting the public departments at all Mr STORY believed that there was some- thing behind tlie attack winch had been made on tlie Minister of Railwajs, othorw ise tbcro would not hove been so much made about this compnrativ elj small matter Mr GAUNSON said that before be vv lth drew the amendment he wished to say a few words m personal explanation Had this affair happened m the stonewall times-liad it been committed by the M'Cullocli Govern- ment-what would have been said' Tlie Chief Secretary Bpoko of the necessity of having a united pnrtj The time when dis- union waa moat likelj to occur waa when otu one could point to w bat appeared to be mal- administration in a public department The DEPUTY SPEAKER -The bon member's remarks look more like a second speech than a personal explanation Mr GAUNSON intimated that he would take another opportunity to reply effcctiv ely to the twaddle that had been spoken about the visits of members of Parliament to the departments, Tlie amendment and the motion were then w ithdravvn REPORTING DEBATES. Mr RICHARDSON moved that a select committee be appointed to inquiro into and report upon tlio best method of securing cor- rect reports of the proceedings of Parliament, vv ith the view of publishing them daily, such committee to consist of Sir John O Shonas3), Mr Munro, Mi A T Ciarle, Mr Nimmo, and the mover, with powerto call for persona and papers, three to form a quorum, and that tho progreSB report and ev idence taken before the committee on the Bame subject, laid upon the table of tlio House last oeaaiou, be referred to tina committee The motion waa agreed to LEGAL PROFESSIONS INTEGRATION BILL Mr DAVYER moved for leave to bring m a bill to further integrate the le_al pro fehsions Tlio motion was agreed to, and the bill brought ni and read a lust time ADJOURNMENT.
