"RELIGIOUS AWAKENING IN GEEAT BRITAIN." On Wednesday evening, the first of a series of three public meetings was held m the Wesleyan Church, West Maitland, the object being to receive information on the present work of God in Scotland and other parts of Great Britain There was a good attendance, the assembly consisting of members of various congregations m Maitland. The weather was rather threatening during the evening The proceedings commenced by the Rev J G M DOUGALL calling upon the assembly to sing a hy tun The rev gentleman then offered prayer The Rev G LANE said that he desired to ex- press the pleasure he felt that they had been able to hold such a meeting as that He thought it was a proof at any rate that some of the different denominations of Chnstians in the town could unite in body and in spirit to hear what God was doing in other lands, and to do something as far as they could to seek at God s bands such blessings for themselv e? He gave the people and the ministers of other churches present a hearty welcome in the name of the ministers of the circuit and the members of the congregation worshipping in that church, and he said to all the grace of the Lord JesuB Chnst be I with you The object of the meeting was simply to alford some information upon the glonous work of God in Scotland and in England-a work of quick- ening and awakening and conversion which God was carrying on m those parts The Rev Mr Benvie would give them that information and the Rev Mr Hills would then address them on topics suitable to the information, and suitable to the meeting They sympathised heartily with the work of God which was going on Their heartiest prayers and their strongest desires were that God would grant them blessings of the same kind in this land also They needed such ble«sings, and he only hoped they would seek for them m the ngbt way He thought he ought to read a portion of Holy Scnpture to encourege and direct their thoughts He then read the 8oth Psalm Another hymn having been sung, The Rev JAMES BENV IE (Presbytenan Minister) said he desired to be as brief as possible in the statement of facts he was to make, as there would be at least two other meetings of similar character at which he should introduce matter in addition to what was then brought forward First, however, he wished to say that there was a misapprehension in the minds of many as to the meaning of the word revival A great many people labour under the mist ike that such a word is peculiar to the Wesleyan body That was a misunderstanding which he was glad of the opportunity to correct, and to maintain the great principle and the great doctrine that God at different times and m divers places manifests His grace and His power m the conversion of souls in an extraordinary man- ner Bv that he meant something not usual, something out of the track of ordinary expen ence The question might be asked, why should this work be of an extraordinary character, in the sense in which he had used the word ?-why should there not be constant additions to the Church of God, or, in other words why should not this w rk of quicken mg, reviving, and awakening the Church of God and the work of conversion be the normal state of the Church of Christ i However, Bpeaking according to experience, such movements of the Spint of God were as yet termed extraordinary The doctrine of revivals meant unusual earnestness m spiritual mat- ters The principle was a Scriptural principle At the very found ition of the Church of Christ, three thousand souls were spoken of as being added to the Church, and it was also said that "the Lord | added to the Church daily such as should be saved " With these preliminary remarks, he would proceed to give an account of a great work of God, which had begun in Scotland, but waa spreading in England throughout the length and breadth of the land The movement bad also extended itself partially to Ireland They had also intelligence from Amenca that a great work of re viv8l had also commenced there That night, how- ever, he would confine himself to the work in Scotland In the middle of last year, two strangers, Messrs Moody and Sankey, Amencans, appeared in England Mr Moody is a preacher, Mr Sankey ac- companies him with his music and his hymns. Mr Moody was never teamed for the Christian ministry He began with a Sunday School class. God blessed him He then addressed grown up people, and God blessed him also Dunng the late Crimean war he went hither and thither among the wounded, and led many to the knowledge of Chnst He found God was working with him, and he wrought for many years in the vineyard of the Lord m America The people among whom he laboured in Amenca being about to build bim a new church, at a cost of £20 000, he thought it would be advantageous to himself and to his people if he visited Great Britain The Church over which he presided was, it might be remarked, a compound of Independency and PresbytenaniBm There was a body of elders to manage the congregation as m the Fresby terian church, but the church was not con- nected with any denomination Messrs Moody and Sankey amved in England, and visited the midland counties-York and Durham They got very few people to listen to them In the meantime several individuals have been meet- ing in Edinburgh for prayer that God would manifest himself in the building up of the church and the conversion of souls One of the gentlemen who took part in theBo meetings, heanng of the arnval of these evangelists visited them in England and invited them to Edinburgh They went in the middle of last November, got access to several churches, and held meetings These meetings con« tinued to increase until they found themselves m the midst of a work which neither they nor others had an- ticipated By the last week of 1873 the whole city of Edinburgh had been moved He would remind them that Scotsmen were well drilled in theology-that tjeyhad plenty of light but lacked heat-and that therefore such a movement among tbem bad the greater significance The work begun went on like a train of gunpowder which had been lighted He would now read to them a remarkable document remarkable as giving an evidence of the character of the work, as giving an insight into the nature of the work, and at the same time as giving testimony on behalf of men of standing and position m refe- rence to the work. He would rtad the names first | The speaker read the m mes signed to a cir- cular adlressed to everj minis er in Scotland, stitmg that the manifestations of Go<* s present i» and poww m Edinburgh were so marked til it the tree Chinch \sseniblj Hall, the largest public building in Edin- burgh, was crowded ev erj daj at noon with a meeting for prajer, and that both tint building and the Established Church Assemblj Hall overflowed everj evening, when the Gospel was preached The cir- cular went on tosaj But the mimbus tint attend are not the most remarkable featuio It is the pre- sence and the power of the IIolj Ghost, the solemn awe, the prayerful, believing, expectant spirit, the anxious inquiry of unsaved soul«, and the longing of believers to grow more like Cbnst-their hungering and thirsting after ho mess " f lie circular, after affirming that these results were ' of the God of grace,' invited the whole land to join in united prayer in the first week in January, and enjoined the manner and spirit of such prajer The signatures included the names of professors of the Lniversitie3, of clergymen of the Church of England, of hereditary lords of Scotland, of merchants, and of Presbyterian and other ministers ] He went on These were the names of calm and collected men, who were perhaps as void of enthusiasm as of ex- citement There were men whose li ibits led them to look upon all things with calmness and circum- spection These men guaranteed the document, and joined in the invitation to prajer which it contained -united prayer throughout Scotland in a given week. Commentiug upon the large numbers stated in the circular (which he read) as assembling in the Free Church Assemblj Hall, he stated that the capa- city of that hall must be equal to holding two thousand people Thus two thousand people were occupied every day at noon, in attending the meet- ing for prajer in this great bull The Established Church Assemblj Hail was smaller, but the estimate might safety be made that m the evenings when tho Gospel was preached, the crowded congregations in tlie two halls must reach between three and four thousand people He wanted to impress upon them that this great work of God was a work of praj er, as all great revivals had been-there had alwajs been much prajer preceding and accompanjmg them Bj the 1st of Januaiy every minister m Scotland of any distinction had a copy of the docu- ment, and he believed that in every town and in every hamlet throughout thit week, there was a meeting for united prajer - prajer in which all denominations joined The movement begun in Edinburgh spread through all Scotland-thej heard of it in Dundee, in Perth, Glasgow, Stirling Aberdeen and other places, alter this week of united prajer The meeting in Edinburgh al noon was a meeting for prayer only, theie were meetings in the after- noons sometimes, and in other places there were meetings all day. from ten o'clock till four o'clock Thousands attended them But these were held onlj at certain times, and every hour was devoted to a special subject of prajer The hrst hour the prayers would ask for manifestations of God's goodness In the second hour the people would give thanks for His promises, the third hour would include special requests for salvation , the tourth hour would relate to Christ's work, and supplications for light to show Christians the way to advance the cause of Christ They were always piactical-these prayer meetings, one of their features was the individual requests of those who were anxious for the salvation of their relatives or friends, and the prujers were made up of requests that these might be conv erted, strengthened, confirmed and delivered from doubts, fears, or per- plexities In the larger towns three or tour hun- dred requests for such prayers were sometimes sent in There was also praj er foi certain places One thing to remaik in these requests from individuals was ibut thej came from the familj for members of the family Thej carne fiom peisons who knew of the grace of God, and who were quickened It was a revival of religion-an earnest request from the people of God, for more grace and more faith, more prajer, more love to God, more self denial, more of the spirit of self-sacrifice, moro of the spirit of holi- ness That it was a revival was fuither shown bj the testimony of Dr Andrew Thomson, who stated that three-fourths of the conversions were in Christian famille», aceustomed to the or- dinances of religion lhere was fiist the cloud of prajer, then came the answer, in the conversion of three-fourths who had been thus prayed for in a believing spuit, and then followed the thanksgiving for the answer vouchsafed [The speaker here read a letter from Dr Cairns, of Bor- wick, whom he described as the most metaphj steal preacher in Scotland, m which the writer bore testi- mony to the genuineness and extent of the move- ment, and spoke of the absence of all excitement in the manifestations, "except what is inseparable from the realisation of the awful and jojful truths of the Gos- pel of Christ " Dr. Cairns also used the expression "this remarkabletime," which thespeaker commented upon as showing the opinion of Dr Curns respecting the movement, and spoke of the influence of the re- vival upon j oung people and Sabbath school» ] He proceeded In the first week of this year there was the noon-day prayer meeting attended by three or foul thousand peuple, in the evening the gospel was preached in the Assembly Hall and other places In the Corn Exchange, a place without seats, six thousand men-admitted by ticket to prevent excessive crowding, were content to stand tor two hours to listen to the Bimple preaching of the gospel of Christ In one day there was an extra meeting at nine o'clock for young men only Two thousand attended In the ordinary services in the churches unusual earnestness was visible-the result of the quickening influence of the Spirit In the afternoon, there were other large meetings, and in the evening a meeting for young women, at which two thousand attended At one of these meetings where there was a congregation of two thousand, it WHS intimated that if anyone desired to converse upon religious matters, they might retire atter the meeting, and they would be conversed with Seven hundred answered the inv itation Ministers were constantlj occupied, they bad to receive inquirers in their ves tries, and to converse with them about their sah a tion Merchants, lawj ers, literary men, and minis- ters sometimes carne to the meetings and went away comforted and refreshed Infidels had been con- verted, and gaily dressed ladies, who had come for amusement, were found enquiring Among the scum of Edinburgh society tho same success was achieved But there was no excitement-no bodily manifestations-only an intense earnestness, and tears and sighs Such a work, he thought, belonged to the Church of Christ, God had been doing such things in Scotland They should pravheretobestirredup They should pray for similar blessings here. God, who had done a work m Scotland, would do a similar work in this country If He answered praj er there, He would answer it here They did not want excite- ment, but the conversion of souls and the building up of the Church of God It was as easj for God to convert ten thousand souls as to convert one soul It seemed tis if pious people were almost afraid to ask Godtoconveit souls, thinking that Ho would only convert one at a time Thej should not suppose so They should praj for the Church to be stirred up, and for the grace of God, first foi themselves and then for others A hymn was sung, and prayer was offered by the Rev G LANE The Rev R T HILLS (Congregational Minister) regarded the attendance, m the unfavourable state of the weather, as an indication of interest in God's manifest action Thej were there that night because they believed God had manifestly put forth his power on human souls elsewhere The statement they had heard must have convinced them mum peachably that the men who had recognised the work aa tbe work of God were men upon whose judgment and wisdom thej might place the most implicit reliance There was nothing strictly deno- minational in the movement. Everj denomination seemed to be affected and blessed There was no doubt that the ill-success of Messrs Moodj and Sankey at York was due to the want of cohesion and sjmpathj among the denominations there That should be a warning to Christians in the colonj Let them lift up their hearts to God, not caring which congregation waB favoured, so long as believers were edified and souls saved There was nothing sensa- tional about the movement As far as he could ascertain, the singing was the most sensational part of it. There was a presentation to the mind of the importance of the truths about which nil Christians are agreed, and there was an offering U-J of earnest prayer As they had heard, there was a deep solemnity, quiet, deep e irnestness, and under such circumstances all Christians met to lay aside any- thing that was peculiarly their own and not identified with Christ and the cause of God, so that there was nothing to impede the Holy Spirits action He therefore found hearts open to believe and apply the truth. Christians were led to see their defects, and to appreciate their privileges, sinners to recognise their danger and their duty Thej felt their helplessness and they looked to God, and sub- mitted themselves to His will They praj ed Thus was spiritual life rsahsed, the unction of the Spirit wis manifest, the fiuit of the Spirit was yielded in believers,and in those who had not yielded it before The question for that meeting was-was such Divine action desnable in then midst9 There was no doubt it was needed-there had been for a long time complaints of the «pint of coldness, of ummpressibleness in the Church, inter- fering with the worship of God This coldness was shown in manywajs It was shown m the contri- butions in money to the cause of Christ They were not given as the spontaneous offerings of love, but grudgingly. It was because of this coldness that the Divine action had been withheld All denomina- tions had observed this coldness, all had lamented it They had agencies enough, but they wanted the power from on high How could they secure that power ? God was no respecter of per- sona He was willing to do a similar work here to that which He was doing in Scotland He was equally able to save ten thousand a9 to save one Could they secure the power ? The answer might beconvejed in two words "Pray aright." These two words implied a great deal We are told that if we regard iniquity in our hearts the Lord will not bear us. They must therefore be prepared to give up everything that was sinful, and to undo all sin, if they bad wronged any one in character or by deed they must undo that wrong Thej must take up their duty as it came to them They must be prepared to ask. The words of Ezekiel should be remembered " Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean from all jour filtbmess and from all your evils, will I cleanse you A new heart also wül I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh And I will put my spirit witbm you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and je shall keep my judgments and do them." And then after his promises of renewal, the Lord said, " I will jet for this be enquired of the house of Israel to do it for them " He gave the promises, but the people must ask humbly and in faith For it was one thing for God to answer praj er, and another for us to know that God answered it we should therefore ask as if we were justified in expecting an answer " Whatsoever things ye desire when ye pray believe that je receive them, and je Bhall have them " They must ask in Christ's name, as that was tbe only name by which the Almighty may be approached And they should ask with earnestness, relying in God's promises The speaker concluded with a word of exhortation upon the efficacy of the atonement, addressed specially to those who might feel more thoughtful on that occasion than they had felt for some time It was announced that a similar meeting would be held m the Presbj-tenan Church on Monday evening next, when additional information would be given. The proceedings closed with flinging, prayer, and the benediction
