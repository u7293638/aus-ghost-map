OYSTER CULTURE IN TASMANIA The Hobart correspondent of the mine'" Ion h ram ntr thus describes the result of an attempt made at oyster culture The effort to breed and fatten oysters in Tasmania, about which several flattering paragraphs have been written in the English papers has been given up by the association which started for that purpose between two and three years ago I three thousand oysters were obtained and placed in prepared beds constructed at Oyster Cove where it was ex pected-na that locality had been the natural home of the oyster when the ancestors of Lilly Lanny gulped them down without pepper or vinegar, nor looked for porter afterwards that the much appreciated I bivalve would wax fat thrive and multiply their species But things have evidently changed, for notwithstanding the beautiful beds prepared, the oysters refused to multiply, and grew so thin that a few which were examined when last the officers of the association visited the locality, were nothing but heard, and very little of that A troublesome weed invaded the habitation, growing all over the facings, morbus, and wattles, and thrived wonderfully in the water, which yielded HO little nourishment to the oysters that they were melancholy spectacles when opened Gales destroyed some of the work, and the mud silted up over the beds, smothering the oysters in parts Under these circumstances the directors of the company felt it useless to spend more money, and recommended winding up the association and dividing the assets This proposal was adopted by the shareholders, though, as pointed out by one of the gentlemen present it is a pity to break up the beds even if there is only a ghost of a chance of things turning out better jet The sale of a few thousands of pauper oysters would not realise much, and the few remaining liabilities of the association could be paid off with Â£10 One bed, where the smaller species of oyster had been placed, was doing pretty well though the oysters had not spurted, and to break up this bed for the sake of a few pounds would seem a pity All the beds will probably be saved from destruction, at the gentlemen who opposed that course will make an offer to buy out the rest of the shareholders and allow them to remain the beds laid down by Mr J E Risby at Eaglehawk Neck are looking well, though it is not known whether they have passed or not THE Empress Eugenie has won her case at Marseilles and has been awarded all her costs The town was defeated Step by step on every point of law The decision is said to have caused unfeigned astonishment in court, but was received with evident satisfaction. The case will be carried by the municipality to the Court of Appeal at Aix , but it is extremely improbable that the judgment will be set aside there.
