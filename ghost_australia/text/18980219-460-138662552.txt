"GHOSTS." Mr Andrew Lang, whose interesting book of mysteries and anecdotes of the "super- natural" was reviewed in our columns some months ago, writes us as follows from St. Andrew's, Fife, under date January 10:-- Sir,-The kindly author of the review of my "Ghosts and Dreams" in "The Aus- tralasian" will excuse me for spoiling his good story. No dead Maori with a thumb- less hand was found after my cousin's view of a similar hand in the bedroom of Mr Bolter. There were, in fact, no Maoris in the country! The dead Maori, just murdered, was found with his leprous hand the morn- ing after the late Mr Manning, the "Pakeha Maori," had been worried by a leprous hand which seized him in his bed. The stories are similar, but not identical, and Mr Manning's anecdote I did not receive, like the yarn about Bolter, from the witness himself. It would be very useful if any of your readers familiar with more or less un- sophisticated blacks would investigate their alleged use of polished stones for seeing visions in, as in crystals. The stones are also employed for other purposes of magic by the aborigines. Any information directed to me at the Athenaeum Club, Pall Mall, London, would be gratefully welcomed. Faithfully yours, ANDREW LANG. [In the passage of the review referred to (published on October 23, 1897) an error seems to have been made in appending to one anecdote a sequel which belonged to another. Both were genuine "thrillers," and had, as Mr Lang admits, a family like- ness. Ed. A.]
