NOCTES SYDNIANÆ! A--What are politics? B--A doctrine that would have been pro- pounded if a certain individual who was sha- dowed forth as the "coming man", had got into harness. A--What would have been the duty of this paragon vision had he been successful? B--To have pocketed the £2000 himself, and the perquisites for the use of a great "Empire". A--Do you think this principal would have been rigidly carried out? B--Beyond the ghost of a doubt. A--By whom? B--In the person of Parkesennery. A--Who is Parkesennery? B--An importation from Brummagem. A--Was he well known there? B--Yes. A--In what way? B--From his conspicuous overtures to factory girls, &c.;, at certain hall meetings. A--Has he been long in the colony? B--Yes; ever since he was a "wee toy". A--Who made him a puppet? B--Lang and Co. A--How was it that he had the patronage of this great and influential firm? B--From his propensity for TURNING. A--With whom was he afterwards linked? B--With Wheelabout Charley and his clique. A--How did they succeed? B--They were capsized by a S. A. D. sea wave. A--What followed this sad event? B--The downfall of the mighty "Empire". A--How many were lost in this terrific downfall? B--Between 60 and 70,000. A--Of whom did they chiefly consist? B-The craft and Sunday pleasurers, who were kept in the dark as to the working of this world of wonders. A--Anybody else of public note? B--Yes; certain "Coolies", stokers, and retorts. A--What followed this awful calamity? B--A last appeal to a gullible and benevolent public, to down with the rhino and build up this fallen Babylon. A--Was this appeal responded to? B--Only partially so, on account of the deli- cacy of the conductor, who asked but £800 per annum for prosecuting the advocacy of the bunch of workmen to be employed in raising this great wreck. A--What has since become of Parkesennery? B--He mounted a rocking horse and rode to the d---l, to establish another "Empire" in a new world. X. B.
