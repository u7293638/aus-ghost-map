AT THE t!AMP FIRE, BY NEMO. CONTINUED. gcene;—A small open plain surrounded by Mulgar Scrub, near the Beda water- hole; in the back ground, a flock of sheep, hemmed in with a break or fence of scrub hastily piled up to form a temporary yard ; in the foreground, a large fire (near the waterhole), surrounded by figures in various styles of costume and almost every possible variety of attitude. One, a lad of about eighteen, with boots and breeches which had been "quite the correct thing," when lie left Port Augusta a fortnight before, but were now getting decidedly dingy, was standing up at the fire thoughtfully kicking a log, winch had fallen away from the others, back into the devouring element 7 another lad, also in boots but with moleskin trousers and blue shirt on, was sitting on his own heels, which uncomfortable position seemed to be a favorite one with him, and was solemnly engaged 111 sipping hot tea out of a very black pannicau ; the first of these youngsters was called Jim, the other Joe ; another considerably older than these was sedulously endeavoring to singe the hair off his face, by trying to light his pipe at an enormous blazing firestick ; this was a stranger, who, travelling in the same direction, had been invited to join us at the camp fire ; while one of our party, known to his mates as " Bill the Blower," was lying on his back with his legs choked up and lus heels resting 011 the spokes of the cart wheel; and another, an old man, whom we knew as Steve (or gentleman Steve as the boys named liim) was sitting on a five-gallon keg, calmly smoking the blackened ruins of what had once been a clay pipe ; the sixth, myself, was under a tarpaulin (one side of which had en fastened to the top of the buggy, while the other was pegged to the ground) endeavoring to write by the light of a refractory slush lamp ; the talk had not been interesting, and chiefly about horses and dogs ; when I gave up the attempt to write, Jim was relating some feats of horsemanship with which he had witched the world down south, and Joe was anxiously waiting for his chance, for it was not often he had the opportunity of yarning when Bill was present, but he was now resting from the favorite occupation by which he had earned his sobriquet. Just as Joe was about to begin, Bill looked up from his reverie—" Riding," he said ; do you call cantering about Town riding, or following with a lot of other fools after a lot of dogs who are trying to catch a red herring ; why, a fellow who couldn't canter across a few sections, and let his horse take him over a few fences a yard high, should never mount anything bigger than a billy-goat. If you fellows wanted to sec riding, you should have been 011 some of the cattle stations in the North ; I've done a little riding in my time. " Tell us about it," says Joe. ' Tell you, be blowed, replied Bill; you're such an unbelieving set of beggars, that if I only told you half what I've done, you'd say I was a (expletive) liar. Bill being assured that they were prepared to swallow almost anything, short of his haying swallowed a horse, saddle and bridle, was with very little difficulty, induced to proceed with his yarn, which he did as follows -.—About eighteen years ago, I was employed breaking colts in the North, and among other places, I was at Wilpena about six months ; Marchant had the station then, and I soon found his lot were rum uns ; I got some splendid colts to tackle, many of them four or five years old, but the worst of it was that a good many of them had been handled before and turned out as a bad job; one of them, a splendid grey horse about lGi hands high, was brought into the yard overnight, and I was told that he had been handled, was half broken-in in fact; by this time I knew what this meant and so I was very careful, but this brute beat all I had ever seen ; in the first place, he had 110 mouth—here Jim saw his chance. No mouth, he enquired ; how did he feed ? Shut up your said Bill, you've too much anyway 5 y ou a11 kuow what 1 mean ; you might as well pull at a post as try to turn the wretch, when he took it into his head to go ; well I was getting about tired of that fellow ; I had, had him in hand more than a week, sud it took me and several others an hour to get the saddle on him ; I began" to see jhat I shouldn't earn tobacco, much Ices wages by the brute ; I had got a bottle of brandy from a liawker one night—I shall not say who it was—rind next morning I took a good stiff nobbier, and • instead of lunging the colt for half an hour as I generally did, I got two of the stockmen to hold him and mounted liim at once ; before I was well in the saddle they had to let go, and away lie went full tilt, only stopping now and then to buck ; I managed to get mv seat all right and just as I was about done, and felt that I hadn't strength in my knees to hold on any longer, he left off bucking and started in a tearing gallop up the fiat towards the Pound ; to hold him in 'was but of .the question, so I thought I'd save my strength and let him knock himself up ; I could'nt guide the headstrong d——-1 one bit, because as I said before he had 110 mouth, so I let him rip, -and it was as much as I could do to save myself from getting my brains knocked out against the pinetrees ; by the time we got well into the Pound I had lost nearly all my blue shirt, and the outside of the legs of my breeches were left hanging in shreds to the scrub, and still the brute went on at a tearing galop to the rising ground at the head of the' Pound ; I had some comfort in this, for I thought the hill would fetch him up anyhow, but not a bit of it, he breasted the rise, and though he fagged a little going up the steep hill, I soon found he had no intention of stopping; away lie went ! and it was fortunate for me thai the tackle was strong, or else the saddle and myself would soon have been over his tail; by this time I got a little accustomed to the situation and I began to think that if I pulled him up, he would most likely turn round and bolt down the hill, and then I should be bound to get killed, so I let hi"' • and away lie went up the first range, over the saddle in tlio. lull, and up a long spur which took us to the top of the main range ; here I thought we had gona far enough, and I took a tremendous pull at the reins, and I pulled so hard in my fright (for I must own that I was in a deuce of a fuuk) that I broke the two rings off close at the bit ; then the wretch had it all his own way, and with a snort he started off at a-, still faster pace, and went flying over the rough ground on the top of the range like mad, in fact I believe that by this time he was raving mad, and by the way he charged through the bushes I belifeve lie was blind too ; as for me I was that knocked up with being tired and frightened too, that I could do nothing, although I knew the brute was going straight for a precipice near St. Marys's Peak, a place which went down for about 200 feet and much steeper than the roof of any house. Already I saw before us the fringe of peppermint scrub which grew almost close to the brink, and knew that in a few minutes more we should be over the precipice and I'« should be in another world, but I could not move, I was numbed all over and had 110 use of my limbs ; I shut my eyes and for the first time for some years tried to think of my prayers, but not a single word could I remember ; the next instant I was shot out of the saddle by a tremendous shock, and opening my eyes, I found that I was lying in a thick bush, while the horse had fell and was lying close to me, covered with foam and his flanks heaving, as if he was at the last gasp. " But what stopped you said Jim ? " Well (continued Bill) as far as I could make it out, it was this—There were some cattle feeding 011 the cotton bush which grows close to the edge of the cliff, and the horse came against one of them with such force that lie sent me flying into a bush, knocked himsalf down, and cannoned a fine two-vear-old heifer right down into the gorge, which we found there a few days after completely smashed lip 5 well, I lay there some time before I got up ; and when I did, I felt precious stiff and sore I can tell you, and the horse was no better ; he had ft broken knee, that is the skin was broken, a great gfisli on his off shoulder, and several cuts on his head ; one thing, I had no trouble iu catching him ; I fastened 011 the reins with two saddle straps, but I didn't ride home, I led the brute all the way, and it took me three hours to get to the heifer station at the entrance to the Pound ; I was very glad to stay there the night, so I put the horse 111* the stock-yard, but this day's work awl two night's fasting broke him iu j the next morning he was quiet enough aud let me mount him without any trouble ; I met the gaffer on my way home that morning, and he gave a queer sort of grin when he saw the scars 011 the animal and I told him he was perfectly quiet; however, I took a liking to that animal, and as he wouldn't let anybody mount him except myself, I bought him very cheap, and a better horse I never had in my life ; but I-; didn't take any more half-broken colts * if I knew it. I* soon left Wilpena and gave up colt breaking as my nerves were not up to the mark after that : in fact Fm not ashamed to own that I was horribly frightened^" and have ' gone through that ride many times since in my dreams ; I didn't say anything about my ride at the station, as it's not my way to blow about what I've done— here his audience were seized with a violent fit of coughing, aud Bill lit his pipe. Well (old Steve remarked) of course we are bound to believe you Bill, as we promised to do so, but really if I had seen what you've been telling us, I shouldn't have beiieved it. Well I don't wonder (said the stranger) you were frightened-, I only wonder you could stand it so long ; I got a fright that lasted only a few minutes once, but the effects of it lasted'a good many days. Tell us the yarn mate, said Joe. Yes, do said Jim. Bill handed him a quart pot of tea, and remarked—here, wet your whistle and go a-liead. Thus solicited, the stranger took a long pull at the quart pot, wiped his mputli 011 his sleeve,- aud. began :—He said, I'm a native of Gloucestershire, I am, and before I came out here I was employed as a ploughman cii a farm not far from , I've got a wife now, but she wasn't my wife then ; she was dairymaid at a form house about three miles from where I lived, and I used to go over there courting about twice a week ; I couldn't go in the day time, so after x had rubbed down and fed the horses at night, I used to start, offio see Maria ; that's her name you know ; old farmer Wells at the Croft where Maria lived, had a very savage bull ; the brute would tear up the ground, bellow, and try to break through the fence to get at any one passing along the footpath iu the next field ; '-'as I was usually in a hurry, I never kept to the path, but went' straight across- the meadows and I took all sorts of care not to go where that brute was ; when I came to the field where he was, I turned off. to the right and went through the next meadow, so as to have a hedge between us ; well, one night I was rather later than usual, but I wasn't game to cross the cow pasture where the bull generally-was, ; I turned off as usual, and found the low place in the hedge where 1 generally got over ; it was very dark, but as I knew the ground, J jumped into the field without hesitation and down I came flop 011 my enemy's back ; he had been turned into the other field since I had been there before, and was lying down under the shelter of the hedge ; the tremendous roar he let out as I came 011 to his back told me what it was, and I felt as if uiv blood had turned to ice ; as the bull got up in a hurry, he sent, me sprawling 011 the ground and I gave myself up for a lost man ; but there was 110 danger, the bull was as much frightened as I was, and went bellowing off as hard as he could go to the other end of the field ; 1 soon got over it aud couldn't help laughing at the funk, both the bull and myself were in, but I shouldn't like to go through that again, and 1 always think of it, when 1 hear the proverb—Look before you leap. It was fortunate for you (remarked old Steve) that your fright was shared by the bull or the danger may have been a very real one, but the worst fright 1 ever got was in a case when there was 110 danger whatever. Here arose the cry—Give us the story Steve, and after a little persuasion, Steve commenced. He said, I'm an old man, and the circumstance I'm going to tell you about, took place in tlie old country when I was only a small boy, In '33 I was living about half - a*- mile from a little village called Glaestre, on the Welsh side of the border, but almost close to the county of Herefordshire ; the population of our village could have been put into a gopd«sizcd crush pen ; vet there were two public houses aud two chapels, besides the parish church ; with regard to the latter, it was conveniently close to one of the inns, and the parson had a back door by which he could enter when his arduous duties were ovcr'and refresh the inner man : this house had a smithy attached, Boniface being a blacksmith as well as a retailer of spirits, and while the horses were getting shod of an evening, many a pot of cider was discussed in the tap, but the favorite place with us juniors was sitting oh the forge of a Winter's night, watching the glowing sparks flying out into the darkness around, and wliilc warming ourselves at the fire, we often listened to tales of horror, such as the youth of the present age never hear ; ghost stories and tales of diablerie were then rehearsed, which made the.hair of many of the listeners stand 011 end and sent theui panic stricken to their homes ; the old smith himself (a sort of combination of Vulcan and Bacchus) delighted in these weird stories, and he was looked upon by the simple and devout dissenters of the village as a man doomed to perdition ; he never went to chapel and seldom even to church, but would sit all day 011 Sunday 011 the horse block near his door with a pipe a yard long and a quart of cider by his side, ready to chaff any of his acquaintances who had been to hear the Wesleyan or Baptist minister ; in course of time however, the old man died ; then a tale of fearful interest went round ; the ghost of poor old Hanklyn could not rest; the clank of chains and the groans of a lost spirit were heard iu a lane between my father's farm and the smithy ; the place was deserted after nightfall by the lads who were wont to meet there to plan mischief for the following night or to execute what they had decided upou before ; old Hanklvn's ghost was as good as a patrol of constables ; one afternoon I was sent by my father to the smithy to get some ploughshares sharpened, but there were so many there before me, that it was late in the evening and quite dark before my turn came ; here was a predicament, I had to go through the haunted lane, which was as dark as an oven, and nothing would induce a companion to go with me; being better educated and better read than most of my companions, I had always treated' these ghost tales with contempt, but 1 must confess that I felt anything but comfortable, and when one of my companions, who had only about 300 yards to go, at the conclusion of a tale more startling than usual, exclaimed—" O Lord ! how shall I get home ? " 1 began to think that my walk of half-a-mile was rather a serious undertaking, but there was no help for it, so shouldering my ploughshares I started, trying all the way to convince myself that 1 was not afraid ; I had proceeded about three or four hundred yards up the lane when a sound fell on my ears which chilled my very blood ; it was the distinct clank of an iron chain ; 1 stood still while my flesh began to creep and my hair seemed almost lifting my hat off ; I believe I should have beat an ignominious retreat, but just then I heard the same sound behind me ; the lane was nearly covered with the bushes which overhung from the hedges 011 each side, and it was so dark that I could not see my hand, wliile the path was strewn with pebbles and boulders which made it rather difficult travelling, but in spite of these difficulties I set off as hard as I could run towards home ; I had not proceeded far however, before I again heard the clank of the chain and this time it was close to me, and in an instant after I was hurled to the ground, while there arose 011 every side of me the most horrible commotion, it was as if fifty trumpets were being blown all together, and each one was more discordant than the other ; how long I was 011 the ground I do not know, it seemed an age, it may have only been a few seconds, but just as I struggled to my feet the moon shone out from behind a cloud and I saw two donkeys belonging to some gipsies, quietly grazing 011 the ditch, while another in hobbles was looking me straight in the face, and trying to ascertain what kind of creature had disturbed his repose by tumbling over him ; I was not naturally cruel, but if that ploughshare had taken effect where I intended it, there would have been one live donkey the less in that lane.
