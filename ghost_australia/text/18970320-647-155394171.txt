We have from time to time suggested a Review of the whole School by the Superintendent. Maps and pictures would be a great aid. A scholar might recite the substance of one lesson, another the text. Slips of paper, on which the theme or the lesson involved the duty suggested, would also be within the region of practicability. Anything is justifiable that impresses the children with the idea that Holy Scripture is not simply to be learnt, but to b8 loved . You have seen an old man tottering with the gathering infirmities of a weary lifetime, and wandering in dark ness on which no summer sun could shed the light of morning ; blind 1 blind from his birth ! Never saw .God's outer robe of many colours ; never saw God's shadowed outline — his own mother's face ! You have seen such a man, led along the thronged highway by a little child, to whose young, bright eyes he committed himself in faith and hope. I am that poor, blind wanderer through the way of God's mysteries, and that little guide represents the benevolence, the mercy, the tenderness, with which God leads me from horizon to horizon, until I.stand amid the encircling glorieB of the perfect revelation. The com monest mercy of the daytime flames up into a fire-guide, that ligfits men through the gloom and trouble of the night. ? # * * It is right for you, young men, to enrich yourselves with the spoils of all pure literature : but he who would make a favourite of a bad book, simply because it contained a few beautiful passages, | might as well caress the hand of an assassin, because of the jewellery which sparkles on its fingers.
