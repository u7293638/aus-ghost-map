From old Eheinstein, The people flowed like their own good wine. From Eudesheim, , And Geisenheim, , . . And every spot that is , kno wn to rhyme ; From the famed Cat's Castle of St. Goars hausem, ? : To the pictured roofs of Assmannshausen ; , And down the trabk, . ' ', From quaint Schwalbaoh. To the clustering tiles of Baoharaoh ; From Bingen, hence ? ;, To old.Coblentz : .? . ? : x lom overy oasoouatoa crag, ; . . ; Where the robber chief tains . kept their 'swag,' The folk flowed in, and Ober-cassel Shone with'tho pomp of knight and vassal ? And pouring in from near and far, As the Rhino to its bosom draws the Ahr Or .takes tho arm of tho sober Mosel, So in Cologne, knight, squire, andlosel, ; ' Choked up the city's gates with men ' From old St. Stephen taZint MUrjen. What had they come to see ? Ah me ! I fear no glitter of pageantry, Nor sacred zeal For Church's weal, Nor faith, in the virgins' bones to heal ? Nor childlike trust in frank confession Draw theso, who, dyed in deep trans . gression, Still in each nest . . On every crest , ?' Kept stolen goods in their possession j But only their gortt For something new, More rare than the 'roast' of a wanderinff Jew ; B , Or — to be exact, . To see—in fact— A Christian soul, in tho very act ? Of being damned, secundwn artem, By tho dovil before a soul could part' em. ' For a rumour had flown Throughout Cologne, ? ' : ? That the Church, in faot, was tho devil's , own ; ? ? ? ' That its architect . (Being long 'suspect,') Hud confessed to the bishop that lie had wveekfc Not only his own soul, but had lost The very first Christian soul that crossed The sacred threshold ; and all, in fine, For that vory beautiful design Of the wonderful choir They wore pleased to admire. ? And roally, he must be allowed to say ? ,To speak in a purely business way ? That, taking tho ruling market prices Of souls. and churches, in suoh a crisis It would bo shown — And his Grace must own — It was really a bargain for Cologne ! Such was the tale That turned cheoks palo With the thought that the enemy mi-»ht prevail, ' And tho ohuroh doors snap With a thundor-olaj- On a Christian soul in that devil's trap. But a wiser fow, Who thought that they knew Cologno's Arohbishop, replied, 'Pooh, pooh ! Just watoh him and wait, Ami no Rllrn na -FnfA You'll finathat the Bishop will give '.ohock mate.' ' One here might note ? How the popular vote, Ab shown in all legends and anecdote, . Doolaros that a broach _ Of trust to o'erroaoh . . . . ' Tho dovil is something quite proper for eaoh ?' And roally, if you Givo the devil his due, In spite of tho proverb— it's something you'll rue. , . . But to lie and deceive him, To use and to leave him, ; From Job up to Faust is the way to receive him, ' Though no one has heard It over averred That the 'Father of Lies' ever yet broke his word, But has left this position, ; In evory tradition, To be taken alone by the «« Truth loving' Christian! Bom ! from the tower ! It is the hour ! The host pours in in its pomp and power Of banners and pyx, And high oruoifix, And orosiors and other prooossibnal stioks, And no end of Marys In qunint roliquaries, To gladdon the souls of all true antiquaries ; And an OsouJum Faois ?

Withont beginning or end, it has long been regarded as an emblem of eternity; and also of the strength and perpetuity of affection. 'The ? fourth finger of the loft hand has long been oori eidered aaored, and hence has been oonse orated to wear tho wedding ring. The Greeks and Romans wero so fully convinced of the intrinsic value attaohed to this fioger, that it was callod the medical or healing finger. Their Various modioinal preparations were stirred with it in place of a Bpoon, it being supposed that should any noxious ingredient bo included in tho cup, warning of the faot would immediately bo givon by a palpitation of the heart. In some remote oonntry plaaes in England this superstition is' still firmly believed in. The other fingers are thought, to possoBS a certain power of evil, but ja wonnd or sore stroked by the wedding finger is expeoted by them 'in a short time to dis appear; and the wedding ring itself is by. many supposed to have the same healing effeot. The rings used by the Jews at their marriage ooromonioa were sometimes very large in Bize, and elaborate in. design; the Jewish law demanded, too, that they should bo of a cortain valne, and to prove this to be the oase, ' they were before the ceremony submitted to an examination. It was a rnle, also, that the bridegroom should parohase tho ring out of his own private rosouroes, and not obtain it either on oredit or as a gift' from a friend; and aftor the ring had been placed on the bride's finger, the' marriage was ' considered thon, as ? it - in now, to be irrevocably binding. Among the fishermen on the west ooast fo Ireland the' wedding' ring ia kept as an heirloom in the family, and iB considered as the properry-o! the' eldest married daughter, aonaequontly many of the wedding rinRS still worn by' the fish wives -in 'that dintrlot are quite old and' of exceedingly anoiont design, being' manu faotured as far back as the Elizabethan era. In the Bixtoenth oentnry, both marriage and betrothal rlDgs were mado with a motto or posy inBoribod insido, and to these Shaks peare, in two or throe of his ployo, referg.— CasseU's'Domtttio Dictionary. ? ?; .'
