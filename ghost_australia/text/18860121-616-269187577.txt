The moment is from the “ Love Stories of Parthemus, ’ who preserved fragments of a lost epic on the expedition or Achilles against Lesbos, an island allied with Troy. Tho daughter of the Lesbian king Within her bower she watched tho war, Far off she hoard tho arrows ring, The smitten harness ring afar; And. fighting from the foremost oar. Saw one that smote whore ail mnst flee ; More fair than the. Immortals are He seemed to fair PisiclieS She saw, she loved him. and her heart Before AchilleB, Felons’ son, Threw all its guarded gates apart, A maiden fortress lightly won I And, ere that day of fight was done, No more of land or fnilb reokod sh<^ But joyed In her new life began— Her life of love, Pisidlofi I She took a gift into her hand, As one that had a boon to crave ; She stole across the rained land Where lay the dead without a grave, And to Achilles' hand sbo gave Her gift, tho secret postern’s key. “ To morrow let mo ho thy slave I” Moaned to her love PisidicO. Ere dawn the Argives’ clarion call Bang down Mothymna’s burning street; They slow the sleeping warriors all, They drove tho women to tho fleet, Save one, that to Achilles’ feat Clung, but, in suddon wrath, cried he t n For her no doom but death is meet.” And there men stoned Pisidioft. In havens of that haunted coast, Amid the myrtles of the shore, The moon sees many a maiden ghost— Love’s outcast nsw and evermoro. The silence hoars the shades deplore Their hoar of doar-bought lovo; but thee Tho waves lull, ’neath tbine olives hoar, Te dreamless rest. PisidicS.
