ECHOES OF MELBOURNE: ' ? (Bt The Ghost.) ??'?:...'? During the week thependulam of public opinion has oscillated between peace and' war with singular regularity. The Loridori special correspondents told us on one day that all hope of a pacific solution of the ' Afghan difficulty had been abandoned,only ? to tell us twenty-four hours afterwards1 that the prospects of peace were bright ening, 'again, to inform us that war ??was ' looked upon as inevitable and yet once again to contradict themselves, and next 'dav cable tho news that Russia was hanlrincr down and. thero would bo no fighting; after all. This latter ? announcement'' is doubtless correct, tor when neither party ?' to a quarrel is desirous of coming to blows, ; there is generally no recourse to hostili ties. Mr. Gladstone aparently is quite ready to 'cave .in' and concede all Russia re-' quires, and the Czar has no occasion' to re sort to arms when he can achieve his ends by. diplomacy. The unexpected, however, often happens, and our ally, the Aiueer,.' jmay take it into his head to defend the in tegrity of hia own frontier, ; in which case :: jEnglahd would.be bound to assist hiinYand ? .thus: draw the sword which she is evidently ? so anxious tokeep sheathod.: :; i:-, ? '; | -.Meanwhile it is satisfactory to know that. ith.b- 'mother country is now in a state- of - ipreparedness in regard to both herland ' jand sea forces.and ready within a few hours'' 'of the cry of havoc, and the loosing of. tho dogs of war to assume offensive bpperatipns. . xne lion ??. coucnant - ? can at a' moment s ' notice.be transformed into the lion '.' ram- ? |pant,' for in very sooth Britons may now; re-echo the' patriotic boast, . -.....';. ! Wo' ve got tho ships, we've got the moniwo'vd r ;? got tho monoy too I -.,.? , i ;..„- a.. refrain in .which, according toallac.-, counts, tho Kussian Bear would be unable , tq.join.i And it is,morcovor, satisfactory, to; kno,w;uhat Australia is also quite prepared, to V.mgke . it ,hot' ?? -'for any ; ; Muscpvite . cruiser, that may be rash enough to pay- us , a visit. The Defence Department has been unusually - active. The South Channel' Fort, the key to the works at the. Heads/ is making satisfactory progress, and in the course of afew weeks will bo, ready to re-: ceive its armament of heavy guns; and, the lighters to be sunk to block the en trance to the West Channel are all ready for sinking at any moment. Morepvor.the 'breach' between Lieut. Colonel Sargood and the ' imported' military officers is hardly of the 'imminent deadly' kind mentioned by Shakespearo, and has, it is said, been healed by 'mutual frienis.' When the firebells throughout the length and breadth of Victoria ring out the; pre concerted signal.calling tho colony to arms- we shall certainly be ready to give our foes a warm reception. \- The foolish way in which full informal tion and a detailed plan- of the harbour defence was made public by the leading metropolitan morning journal has been the subject of much adverse comment, and is indeed a matter for deep regret. Patriotism has on this occasion been made subservient to the love of pence. In any European country except England, the publishers of the information— so useful io an enemy— would have expiated their, treasonable stupidity in a gaol. Decidedly, 'they manage ' these things better abroad.' ? : ; : . ? The Civil Service Commissioners. are ap parently bent upon justifying all that 'the' opponents to their appointment' in1 the Assembly ever said against them. Secure' in: their ' position they ;are autocratic; and overbearing in their demeanour towards the Government employes in a way' which1 moat' 'certainly will hardly win' 'for thein the confidence or esteem of the large army of State servants. Their finding in regard to' 'Mr; Lutz, the engineer of the scheme for supplementing the Geelong water supplyi is both arbitrary and unjust.' The per86n[at'.Tvh6se door the1 failureibf the works rests is undoubtedly Mr. Couchman; ope of 'the Commissioners who was at one ,time theheadof the Water Supply Dep'art* ?jnenti' A judge in.hiSjqwniCaae is certain to^ .be -prejudicedjMand'.in'- the., instance;,- in; ppint; ftie, acq.uittal.of.
