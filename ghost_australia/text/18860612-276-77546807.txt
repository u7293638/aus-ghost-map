ALL AN DALE. (By WIDE-A-WAKE.) Judo 10. em)co my last our young friends Lave been buBily engaged in making preparations for 9 hall, which took, place in the old schoolroom here on Wednesday evening, and I am glad to bear tbat it was a success. About thirty couples put in an appearance, and dancing was kept up to a late hour. The proceeds, 1 am' inf^med, are to go towards purchasing the above place for such gatherings. . , While wending my way along one of our lonely streets, some few evenings ago, I perceived an object, which, if met by one who beliefeB in ghosts, would have been reported, to be such. But "your own," looking around caught eight of a few sticks, which were soon brought into motion, and before long the object, which con* sisted of a few poles and a white sheet, was laid low. I may state that the latter article is in my possession, and can be had by the owner together with an advico when called for, One of our rosebuds seeing r saddled horse hong up to a fence on Tuesday evening, and see* fug no one in poesession of tho same, mounted, and everything went straight until the "lose* bud," bofc being satisfied with the pace, began to use the whip, when suddenly horsey tripped, landing the fair one ou the green. I am glad to hear that she escaped with the exception of a shaking. The Weather has Uot settled yet, and during the last 'few days 'we experienced gome very heavy showers.
