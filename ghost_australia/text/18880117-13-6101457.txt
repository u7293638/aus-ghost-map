The Chinese question could be remitted to such a body with a certainty that it would be dealt with in accord with Australian sentiment, and at the same time it would be handled by men alive to the nature of Imperial obligations. Even if the council did not legislate it could -. prepare a bill for the various local Parliaments to consider, and these local Parliaments would have the advantage of knowing how far they could go in co-operation with each other and with the empire. So with the French criminals, while debtors, defences, and patents require not so much local as federal legislation. A Federal Railway Committee, to report on the present war of tariffs and to suggest means of avoiding further difficulties, might work wonders, and sooner or later, if irrigation is to be extended, our river system must be put on a federal basis. In each case the existence of a federal supervision would be a check on mere selfish provincial encroachments. The great thing, of course, is to bring New South Wales into the fold. With her adhesion secured, the union becomes a fact, and its rapid growth might be confidently prophesied. It would be " whole " as the marble, founded as the rocks" and the hope may be entertained that assurances will be offered to New South Wales to which she can honourably listen. A good deal of the jealousy of 1884 has, we fancy, been broken down by the disappearance of some prejudiced veterans from the scene of by the good will manifested in the Bulli incident, and by the constant intercourse between the capitals The Centennial rejoicings and the 1 exhibition should operate in the same direction There is a danger of a severe protectionist demonstration against the sister states when the Victorian tariff comes on for revision and discussion in the ensuing session, but otherwise all the omens are in favour of the early completion of the Federal Council Sir HENry PUBL probably would be quick to take advantage of any change of feeling in his colony, and to attend possibly as third president-at the council which he has irreverently described as " a phantom "popping up occasionally at Hobart He has testified himself, in his happier and more independent moments, that once get a Federal Council of almost any kind fairly started, and the future belongs to it When Mr QIADSIONL once announced to an astonished and sceptical world that "we had lived into a " gentler age," he forgot among many other signs of the times the hordes of disciplined battalions, whose leaders are able to set ] uropo m dismay by a word If there is less lighting than formerly, there are more rumours of war affecting a much larger portion of humanity, if there are) fewer battles, there is a greater disturbance of commerce and industry in what are generally regarded is more barbarous Jays war was waged by small mercenary armies, and, except on the actual scene of operations, there was little interference with the ordinary occupations of the People At the present time the whole population is placed under the military yoke and the armies are increased until their dead eight threatens to put a serious check upon national progress But the direct tax, heavy though it undoubtedly must be, is not the only burden imposed by the camp upon the country Ide dada lations of statesmen and soldiers and the threatening movements of troops produce a state of uncertainty, fear, and suspicion, which continuity affects all the exchanges and markets of the Continent There are some who think that the constant rumours of war are only intended to influence the exchanges, that they are nothing more than concerns of " rigging the market," which a few powerful financiers are able to employ There are others who imagine that they are invented to afford Punto BisMUiCK. an excuse for demand ing an increase in the number of the German troops, or to allow a French Ministry to pass supplementary military estimates Whether or not some such latent purpose may exist, whether or not the constant snarling of diploma lists is a strife of unscrupulous brokers, and the dogs of war are in reality the jackals of business, it is impossible to say with eel titude But the invariable effect of the present tension is to depress the markets, and to cause widespread loss and anxiety among the general public Day by day we hear of flue tuations which mo caused apparently in order that diplomatists and soldiers may have something to do We read that the Czar has held a reception 01 sneezed, and all the houses are reported to be depressed We are informed that the German LM PERSon has sufiotodfiom a cold, or that he has warned the Landtag to be ready for unforeseen events, and the same result follows M o learn that an army is being "raised" on the frontier, and, like a sensitive barometer before a tropical storm in, the market begins to fall All this is part of the price paid for the warlike attitude of the different nations, fluctuations passing over the investments and business of the general public like whirlwinds over a hold of sugarcane 'Taken altogether the direct and indirect consequences of the present eye of suspicion me almost as great as if there were actual war and the barber ism that interferes with legitimation business, that keeps up a chronic condition of suspense, that produces incessant turmoil and lead, is hardly less than the barbarism of local lighting It would be unwarrantable to imagine because of a few strung puts graphs in the official press that war is imminent, for Russia, which has the most to gain and the least to lose by hostilities is withhold by many reasons 'the weather, which is telling seriously) upon the for ci s in Poland, forbids the beginning of a campaign the inter view between the Czar and Prince Bismarck, at Berlin, must have led to some understanding which could only be of a peaceful tendency The fortiessesthiit IMA o been elected on the eastern frontier of Germany, offer a homer which cannot be easily forced 01 lightly assailed A single handed attack by Russia on the allied powers is so opposed to her usual cautious policy that it is not likely to be in contemplation Finally, it may be pointed out that the diplomatic movement has not yet been made by which France is to be dragged into the strife, and England rendered neutral At the same time, the disquietude reported from the Continent is not with out foundation The gathering of a Russian army has hitherto been a sure prelude to hostilities Owing to the want of roads it is a habit of the Russian Government to mobilise the troops long before a pretext for war is hit upon Everyone will remember that for a year before the opening of the campaign against Turkey), regiment after regiment was silently bent southward, in order to be ready for any emergency that might arise out of the Servian revolt It is always to be feared that a. similar policy may be in operation now 1 Then, again, the diplomatic victory may be easily won It is already understood that if the Russians could overcome their dislike and distrust of French institutions, a bargain with France might be opportunely struck It may be assumed also that a great number of English men are willing to turn their e) ps to receive the dust east by Russia some out of a stupid hope that wars can still be averted and others from party) motives But if Great Britain were neutral and France stood to her arms on the Rhine, the alliance would be placed in a difficult position, and Russia might hope to gain the object of her long ambition, the city of empire on the G ilden Horn To these reasons for disquietude must be added the outbreak of Nihilism It is possible that the CZAR may again be reduced to a condition of impotent terror by the plots against his own life and the knowledge that many of his officers are involved On the other hand, there will not be wanting advisers to urge that Nihilism can best be suppressed in the army by operations abroad Although, therefore the peace may not be formally disturbed, and although the Russian Government may ended your to prohibit the expression of anti-German sentiments in the newspapers, the rivalry of nation against nation and race against race goes on in annoying and hurtful says The destiny of the next century, like the fate of most of the past centuries, seems to hang upon physical force, and it is but a piece of good fortune for the moment that some of the forces make for peace The action of the German banks, the declarations of Prince FLRUIVYVD, and the trial of the Bulgarian conspirators, must have caused great excitement and deep resentment in Russia She is restrained from open hostilities by the weakness of France and the strength of the alliance , she will use her power by diplomacy, by intrigue, and by conspiracy, to regain her influence One can hardly help regretting the Aryan barbarism of the nineteenth century, in which liberty is only preserved by the bayonet and peace by the cannon But, after all, the question of supremacy can be settled in no other fashion than that by which the ancient Goths and Humans decided the superiority Nay, the civilisation and success of every people may be said to depend upon sheet strength, which preserves their individuality England is still dreaming of the fanciful world of Quakerism and has not yet realized the meaning of D G WIN'S discovery of the struggle for existence It does not seem to be understood by her governing class, though nevertheless it is shown plainly on the scroll of time to be the fact, that the lighting power, the ability to hold one's own, the endurance and self sacrifice required for defence, and even a certain readiness for aggression, underlies all the successes and triumphs of a nation in every department As the inanimate forces of nature support every living being so at

WALSH, for in Banco to be forced suddenly to discount Romance, an agitation which they have done so much to promote and the alternative of disobedience to the Papal mandate would have been at least equally intolerable. Possibly, too, the POPE, is shrewd enough to know how far his authority extends, and is too w use to run the risk of expressing views which might be neglected or even opposed by his flock. In these circumstances there need be no surprise at the announcement which appeared in the Daily Chronicle, and if the news be correct, it may, indeed, be considered satisfactory that His HOLINESS should have gone so far as to place on record his condemnation of the move literary tendencies of the Irish movement. By doing so, however, the POPE performs an act which may be gratifying to him in a twofold manner Anything revolutionary is naturally dis- tasteful to the Vatican, whose traditions and reactionary in the extreme, and an opportunity is further afforded him of again putting forward the claims of the Holy See to a shire of influence in the secular affairs of the world It is now known that the present POPE is not inclined to abate one iota of the picton sions of his predecessor, and any interference even of a trifling kind with the temporal interests of other nations may be not uncongenial to him in his present rather isolated position Whether any action of this sort will have much effect in determining the issue which the POPE has most at heart is a matter for HISHOIINESS to judge But so far as the British Government are concerned, even the modified form of moral assistance, which the Vatican has afforded them in their struggle against Irish disaffection, will probably be gratefully accepted as being better than nothing, and therefore valuable to a certain extent. the people of Birmingham though they should be accustomed to an atmosphere of mingled fog and smoke of the consistency of this road, have been groping for the end of the world through a five days darkness A tradition that dates in the face from the period of sun worship, and in the individual from his first ghost story, has made the darkness contain everything terrible and destructive But it would be certainly much more logical and ox curable if a Victorian, smitten by the fierce glare of a pitiless sun, were to forebode the story consummation of all things Sundays burning slates and scorching wind might have led even a not too superstitious man to an agree that all life was to be burnt up Or, perhaps, we owe to our changeable climate the all important knowledge that after the north wind comes the south and after the fog the light We have not however, in this pros the community a local prophecy waiting for fulfilment and since Mother Sinrrov has been rationed, we are not likely to have one unless a nullonarian preacher comes to our aid It is to col tun religionists small in numbers, but great in interpretation of signs and symbols, that we look for that sensational prophecy As a rule they do their work well it is reported that on the day appointed for the end of the world in a tranquil districts America a large number of the women dressed them selves in white and prepared to be carried beyond the clouds the outbre de of the Cuneo in war brought a host of pamphlets, which foretold the battle of Armageddon and the destruction of nearly all the human ncoexcoptthc Tows and the Anglo Saxons Dr CUMMING, of London I, made a wide reputation by fixing the o\ tct year in which the earth was to be consumed But repeated disappointment his made the prophets chary of dies and another disappointment will fairly dishearten the citizens of Birming ham If darkness is the sign of the end thou a large part at least of the globe is evidently far from destruction The in habitants of the great mid land city will clearly be forced, in spite of their anticipations, to go back to the drudgery of mundane existence Unfortunately it is difficult to tell whether to condole with them in their disappointment 01 not But we know that fully eighteen hundred years ago the end of the world was confidently expectcd It will probably continue to turn on its axis for some time longer, without providing a final sensation for the newspapers, and destroying the printing presses that ought to chronicle it Of all the signs given from the time of the Jewish Christians to that of LmcAit ALIAVPOI-, a Birmingham fog, which is caused in a small degree by nature, and in a large degree by the smoke of factories, is the most improbable Several of the cable messages published this morning appeared in a portion of yesterday a issue The second session of the Federal Council of Australasia was opened yesterday morning in the Legislative Council Chamber Hobart, the delegates present being Mr Gillies and Mr "A rixon, representing Vic Iona, Sir Samuel Griffith and Mr J R Dickson, Queensland, Mr L T C Braddon and Mr A I Clark, Tasmania Mr J G Lee Steere from Vt Western Australia subsequently took his seat Mr Gillies proposed and Mr Braddon seconds 1 the appointment of Sir Samuel Griffith as President of the Council, and the motion was carried with acclamation The delegates then proceeded to the Executive Council Chamber where the newly elected President was introduced to the Governor of Tasmania Sir Hobart Hamilton, who congratulated him on his appointment. the delegates afterwards returned to the Council chamber where His 1 Excellency delivered the opening address The Council then adjourned until the afternoon On resuming, Mr Gillies brought up the report of the proceedings the standing committee appointed at the last session of the Council. Mr. Lee Steere was elected chairman of committees. Mr. Clark brought in a bill to regulate the extradition of offenders, which was read a first time. Several notices of motion were given, including one by Mr. Wren for the appointment of a select committee to prepare an address to the Queen on the subject of the continued deportation of French con view to the Pacific. A committee was then appointed to prepare an address in reply to the Governor's speech. The address was brought in, and on the motion of Mr. Dickson, seconded by Mr Lee Steere, was adopted. The Council then adjourned until this morning.. With reference to the Sydney Centennial celebrations, the Premier has telegraphed from Hobart stating. that if any considerable number of members of Parliament arrange to go to Sydney, a special train will be provided for them Members of the Legislative Council who purpose going are requested to intimate their desire to the clerk of the Council, and members of the Assembly to the clerk of the Assembly, so that the necea Henry arrangement, can be made. The l'ostraaater.Goneral (Mr. Derham), the Minister of Education of South Australia (Mr. J. C V. Johnson), the Postmaster General of that colony (Mr. C Todd, C.M.G.), and the deputy postmaster general of Victoria (Mr. J. Smibert), will to tiny leave by the steamer Shannon for Sydney, to attend the Postal Conference to be opened there on the 19th mat. The Minister of Defence (Sir James Lorimer) will act as Postmaster General during Mr Denham's absence, and Mr. W. Galbraith (assistant secretary and chief clerk in the Post office), will perform Mr. Smibert duties. A communication has been received from the Colonial Office in reply to the representations made by the Government of this colony against the granting of permits to ticket-of leave men from the French convict settlement in New Caledonia, authorising them to land in Australia en route to San Francisco. Sir (Jralinin Derry has forwarded the letter, which was addressed to him as agent, general, to the Premier. It reads as follows: " Downing street, December 5, 1887 sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to acknowledge your letter of the 23rd ult. truuiinilttlni_.c9pi.oI u cortes apondence with your Government with reference to the prohibition of French liberty from New Caledonia to set foot in English possessions during the period for which they are allowed to absent themselves from the colony in consequence of good behaviour, and to the action of Consul Layard, when applied to by I Frenchmen of this class Sir Henry Holland desires me to state that the question is one which will receive the best attention of Her Majesty s Government but that as the subject has been referred to the Governments of all the Australian colonies and as Sir Henry Loch is the only governor whose answer has as yet been received, it will be necessary to await the replies from the other Governments concerned belore com municating with the Foreign Office to which department your letter shall he sent in due course I am ive., JOHN Bituisrov The secretary of the Pacific Cable Company has written to the Postmaster General from London, under date December 8 stating that Mr Owen Jones, a director of the company who is perfectly conversant with the views not only of the London board, but of the Canadian shareholders, in regard to the proposed cable communication with Aus- train from Vancouver s Island was to sail from England for Australia on December 16 Mr Jones while in Australia will seek to arrange a basis of concerted action between Canada and Australia in relation to this project So far Mr Derham has not been able to ascertain whether Mr Jones has yet reached Aus- tracts, but he hopes that he will arrive in time to participate in the forthcoming Postal Conference Mr Jones represents Canadian interests on the London board of directors of the company Mr George Smibert of the Post-office department will visit Geelong to day to arrange for the establishment of a telephone exchange in that town The business of the exchange will be conducted from the present Post Office, and the only additional expense to be incurred will be in erecting lines of wire, fixing switch boards, and providing the necessary appliances. The extension of settlement in the country districts, and the steady increase of population in the metropolitan area, have necessitated a considerable addition to the number of state schools in the colony during the past three or four years 'The staff of school inspectors has not been augmented pro- fits, and it has been apparent to the officers of the Education department for some time that the work of inspection cannot longer be carried on with efficiency without a re-arrangement of the districts and the appointment of additional inspectors. The Minister of Education has therefore under consideration the desirability of up portioning the metropolitan area into five inspectorial districts instead of four as hitherto, and the constitution of a new country district near Shepparton as the head centre One of the metropolitan districts, which has been worked as a double district by an inspector and an assistant inspector, will be divided into two Prospecting for coal in the Otway forest district has been carried on for some months past, with assistance from the prospecting vote. Mr. J li. Bignell waited upon the secretary of the Mme3department, yesterday, with samples of the prospects obtained No fewer than 20 coal seams were found, and it is probable that a syndicate will be formed to test the value of these discoveries Mr Bignell is of opinion that many of the seams are payable Samples of other products discovered by the same party were shown to Mr. Langtree, Deposits of fire clay, suitable for making delft and crockery, have been found in the Cape Otway district. With the addition of felspar, of which there is an abundant supply in the colony, is said that the clay in question would make the finest chinaware Cobalt, the mineral dye used for colouring crockery, has also been found in the Western district, these products are to be submitted to the manager of the pottery) works at Northcote. Mr Bignell exhibited samples of sulphur and iron p) rites, which were found in the district traversed by the Gellibrand River, where traces of gold have also been met with The pyrites will be analysed A bed of infusorial earth, ranging in our list to bit thick, was found near Port Fairy and it is to be used as an absorbent of nitro 1 jeering in the manufacture of dynamite. Three promotions from the fifth to the fourth class of officers in the Crown Law department have recently been made These transfers have been effected in consequence of the system initiated by the secretary (Mr J! C Hormann) of training the fifth class officers to qualify themselves to act as clerks of courts, many of whom are graded as fourth class officers As it is not improbable that vacancies may occur in the fourth class at no distant date, officers who are anxious to fit themselves to pass the examination provided for clerks of courts are requested to communicate at once with Mr llarrniiaii on the subject The Premier has issued a circular request mg that leave of absence may be granted to officers in the various departments of the public service who may wish to attend the rifle shooting competitions which will be begun in Sydney) on February li, in connection with the New South Wales Centennial celebrations The officers of the Post office Savings Bank will be required to work overtime during the present month to cn ible the annual balance to be struck The Public Service Board will be asked to authorise the payment of the overtime, and in view of the recent expression of opinion by Parliament that remuneration should be given to the officers for this extra work, it is believed that the board will not again object to pass the accounts A preliminary meeting of the delegates appointed to form the deputation to the Rail way Commissioners on the subject of the freights on agricultural produce will be held in the municipal chamber, The Exchange, at 10 o'clock this morning, for the purpose of arranging the details, and choosing spokesmen to represent the views of the farmers The deputation will wait upon the commissioners at 12 o'clock, and will be accompanied by a number of members of Parliament and some representatives of leading Melbourne) firms interested in agricultural products Mr. O Langtree, in a letter to his brother, the permanent head of the Mines department, has forwarded some notes of the result of a recent interview between himself and M Pasteur, the eminent French c chemist, on the subject of rabbit destruction in Australia. Mr. Langtree states that M. Pasteur un- doubted!) takes a very great interest in the question, which he has evidently studied well, his experiments extending over a period of years. He proposes to make further trials of his new method of rabbit destruction although he declares himself already satisfied that the remedy he has proposed for the extermination of the pest will prove to be the best that can be devised. M. Pasteur expressed his intention of send- ing supply of the microbes chicken cholera to each of the Australian Governments, with instructions how to cultivate them. Great care is necessary to ensure satisfactory results, and M Pasteur thinks it would be wise to send a man specially for the purpose of cultivating the microbes. Mr. Langtree suggests that on receipt of the microbes a careful trial should be made of M. Pasteur's proposed remedy). 'I he distinguished scientist assured him there was no need to fear that, under the Australian him, the disease might prove dangerous to sheep, but he is of opinion that it would destroy) hares, and might possibly prove fatal to opossums. A rabbit would only live from 18 to 20 hours after contracting the disease. It would not be necessary to distribute the microbes more than once on any rabbit feeding ground. M.
