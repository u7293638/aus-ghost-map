Jackson's Water hole. (PILLS BY TUB GALWAY BLAZ.RU.) IA CLAIM and fancy drc*s ball, in aid of tho Narandora Hospital, will bo hold at tho Sandigo or Sandy Creek 11*11, ou Friday next, 20th August. Tho 8»ndlgo Hull is .paoious sod capiblo of afTordiog dancing room to 80 or 00 couple* of modoratodi »ien lions-George Kcid, I proiumo, will not bo invitod, ai wo nro too unsympathetio for him, and, besides, Riverinailea brcatho their thoughts in tho op-n air, and, therefore, cannot comprehend or sympathise wilh tho dark tuunul workings of Ueid and Co. If (icorgo oomcs wilh big dubious and caligi nous politics to our ball, 14 mo " iwid Tommy Nipper shall tako to our bod-tlcks rather than mar tho pleasures of calisthcnics. The floor of tho hall is good and somewhat oUntio-a thing to bo desired by dclicato ladies who may havo tho pleasure of swing ing fat gcntlemon much givon to prop, Gents, who on othor occasions amuse them* selves by sitting ou a rail chewing tho cud rather than d&neo; out of timo, bear a refusal, or who found tho right partnor always en gaged, will bo provided this timo with a pavilion, lire, light, and with cards and othoramusemonls to numerous too numerate, (.enta of eccontrio habits or of smoky notions, und who cannot be amused in any way save by smoke, opposition and politics, will bo accommodated with plenty of out door room for (heir fumes, politics and antics. And if thcro should bo any gents longing to join us in our dancing and humane work, but cannot, unfortunatoly, leave their rheumatics, physics, or bud* ticks, they will bo cxcused for non- atten dance, and cannot insult us by purchasing Uckots ot cost price-7s. Gd. Upon my feot, ladies and gentlemen of Narandora, Bullenbong, Tho Rock, Cross Roads, and districts about tho " Galore," I do declare j that this ball at Sandigo will eclipse any thing that has ever UKen placo at this playful and dancing locality, and I will be_ woefully disappointed If it is not strongly, patronised by the worshipper® of Comus and Tcrpsichoro. It is unnecessary for me to remind tho threo "Graces" of Naran- j dera, tho .. Light " of Tho Rock, the " Venus" of Bulbmbong, the "Thorn" of Loukhart, the 11 St*r " of Juckson's Wa'er boles, and tho "Flame" of Galore, that their presence shall bo looked for, eloo tho ball will loio thereby, and be robbed of much of its brilliancy and maguetic attraction. Nell, Tommy Nipper-ilia1 chap in iho tall moustache- has purchased, at no littlo expend, a bouquet of artificial flowers as large ns a guin-treo, and, 1 believe, he has it soaking in a billyfull of Kau de Cologne or Roger and Gal'ct'i liutterfly Hlootn. lie says that if you do not come I to this bull ho will bo In tho "Blues" all night, troid on everybody's tors to keep nil temper at suicidal heat, implore Antoros to avenge him, dolivor hiinsclt up to Atropos in the morning, d ck you with his funoral oxpensea, and, worst ot all, " his ghost will come and haunt you, Nellio Riley, 0." After tho ball is over I will form (under pain of eternal coolness, rifck of being torn into libbjnr, pulvoiized like sand on the streets of Naraodera, smothered by kisses, or converted into a oryetaliscd codfish and suspended by tho tail from the homogeneous rafters of the ompyrean) into a Southern Cross, inoluding tho Polnt'is, tho six brightait ftUra (artificial disfigurement by cosmoliquo or painting by tho juico of priokly pears out of tho question) that shall I light up their natural, not rougod, beauty i tho ba>l at tho .Sandigo Hull on tho 20th of this month. Sympathetic hearts of Narandora, Jack son's Water holes, and surrounding districts, I think it in supoifluous for me to remind you, that no institution established by man for (In amelioration of humnn nature or for the alleviation of pain, appeals with more forco und sympathy to tho better put of our nature Limn that noblo institution-tho hospital-tho rcfugo of tho poor sick. Wo who have fat or lean purHos may snarl at and refuse to succour a poor fellow brolher on tho M pint," or expiring for tho want of a drink, we may growl ut our wives' extra vagance and rcluct*ntly pay fur tho latest fashion, wo muy nihsctibo with a secret sting a fowshillings, ilut publicly wo miyht look high, to furnish pocket money to n strugnling statesman with a Urge family of ono child, and who is making a horuulean effort to keop tho dingo or "Wont" from his door on his miserable wi'go oi £.'1000 plus refreshers, and golden eggs laid in tho dark, per year ; wo may, that we might appear as gonerous aud us foolish as our neighbors, donate moro lliuu wo can afford to erect for ourselves and deucend-iuts a monument of sand or of shamo; wo may go in debt and in well ventilated boots, and go without a "bike" or an indepen dent smoke over our liborality in purchas ing beyond our "beatia" diamond rings and othor tokens of idiopathy or hypro crisy for our untruo loves, and K"t snuffed out by another "covo" or left by tho "Old Man" in the tink for our pains, but sometimes ^aius ; wo may bewail our hard fate in being confined to a dry land whero no much soft cash must bo paid or "forked out" for tho quenching of our insatiable trilrst; but uovor shall wo roeret or feel tho loss of tho fow shillings joy* fully given or d'inccd out in innocent frolic at a well conducted ball, for the support of tho grandest, the noblest, tho wisest, and tho most humano edifice erected by man for the comfort of his suffering brother-the hospital, tho asylum of the poor, tho wounded,and the dying. Tho CAUSO of the hospital, then, is tho melody which oannot fail to touch tho tender chords of sympathotlo hearts, compels us to open our purses or hearts without a sigh or a growl, and to act tho good Kimaritan to our alHicted brethern no matter what may be his creed, country, color, politics, or condition. Tho cause of the Hospital-on tho lifo and proper management of which depend tho lives of many human beings-is tho tune to whose moviog strains some forty of fifty single and federated ladies and gentlomen are expccted to movo from town as the stars begin to twinkle on the night of tho 20th, and join in blissful harmony with all the inhabitants of Jackson's Waterholcs and surrounding district* who can lcavo thoir physics, rheumatics, or bod-ticks, or can look on without a frown at tho innocent rompings of playful baa baas going through tho graceful movements of cali'tnenics. This is tho music-the cause of the hos pital-which I trust shall ever soften and awaken tho tenderest emotion in tho breasts of the pcoploof Australia. Old Man Creek, 19th Aug., 1898
