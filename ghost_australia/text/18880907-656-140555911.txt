OLabfes' Column. | Outside the I'artfj. Tlijck throng the Bnow flakes, the evening is . dreary, ?- ' ; Glad rings thc^music in yonder gay ball'; i On her who listens here, friendless '.and I weary, '? I Heavier chili than the wintcr'ri doth fall. ? At yon dear window, light-opened before mc, . Glances the face 1 have worshipped so well ; There's tlie line gentleman, grand in his glory ; There tbe fair smile by whose sweetness 1 . fell. This is' akiu to him, shunned and forsaken, That.at my besom sobs low, without bread ; Had not such, pleading my marble heart shakeu, I had been c^uiet, long since, with the dead. Oh ! could I enter there, ghastly and squalid, Stand in men's eyes with my spirit o'er bornc, -i ? Show them where roses bloomed, crushed now and pallid, What he found innocent, leaving forlorn How the fair ladies would fail from their dances, Trembling, aghast at my horrible tale ! How would he shrink from my words and my . glances ! - How would they shrink from him, swooning and pule 1 This is the .bair tbat was soft to enchain him ; Snakclikc, it snarls on my bcautilcss brow-; These are tbe bauds, that were fond to de . tain him With a sense-magic then, powerless now I No ; could I- comc, like a ghost, to affright him, How should that heal my wound, silence my pain ! Had I the wrath of God's lightuiug to smite bim, That could not bring mc 'my lost peace again. Ne'er 1st him grieve while good fortune be tide him, Ne'er count again the poor game lost of old ; When he comes forth, with his youug bride i beside him, j Here shall they find us both, dead in the I cold.
