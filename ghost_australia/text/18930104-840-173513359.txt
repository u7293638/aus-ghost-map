Feeble Candidatures. In theso free countries it is the undoubted right of overy ratepayer to express his opinions concerning municipal affairs, and even to offor himself as a candidate for thoir management. It isqnitc as well also that no rate payer should deem himself entitled to walk into a council withont challenge. There are in tho sea as good fish ns tlio best over caught. But thero hangs the tale. If yon can cateh those fish by all means do so ; but for that end you must not fisli on tlio strand. And thiB brings us to tlio point. Though every ratepayer has a right to offer his services, is it not a waste of time and money for some ratepayers to contest an elootion ? When thore is not the slightest channe for a givon candidate to succeed, scoing what opponents are in the field, and what is the state of feeling towards himself, why does ho notrotire ? Without any desiro to dopreciate the defeated candidate at Sonth Brisbane yesterday, on his own admis sion it may be stated that lie hod not the ghost of n chanoc. He may have a chance on soma future occasion, and then he will bo justified in pushing the battle to tho trenches ; hut thin time he was out, apparently from the first, and might as well have left the field directly after ho had entered it. This instance is a small one, but it is a type of great ones, aud we write with thom in view.
