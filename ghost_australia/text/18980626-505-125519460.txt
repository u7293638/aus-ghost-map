MEN W1TM A PAST. An interesting correspondence has been goiug on for some time in this paper' on the question of how far a man's past disqualifies him for the position of a model husband, it being urged by some that this consideration ! should form an important factor when a woman is asked to take a man for better or worse. We do not intend just now to discuss the question in this con nection, but are reminded by the near approach of the general election that politicians with ''a past' can hardly hope to go unscathed during the amenities which are inseparable from such an event. Some recent incidents, both inside and outside Parliament, are somewhat ominous as to the ordeal which candi dates who have a political past may be expected to undergo, and it would seem that the ensuing struggle will be more than ordinarily distinguished by an exhumation of circumstances which it was perhaps fondly hoped had been long since forgotten, if not forgiven. It seeems to be the misfortune of a political career that apparently the most trivial events have an unusually happy knack of being revived from time to time, and of confronting those responsible for their occurrence in the most repulsive and 'objectionable shape. -The poet's advice to 'let the dead past bury its dead' is uniformly ignored', and perhaps there is nothing that an old campaigner pi-ays more vigorously to be delivered from than the ghosts of his own earlier actions. Even when he has done nothing that caa be construed as corrupt or dis honorable, he is invariably brought face tÂ© face with former utterances, and asked to .reconcile them .with his present attitude, and ^ when he has been strictly consistent he is sure to be. taunted with, and punished for, crust ed conservatism This is apparently one of the inevitable penalties which pub lic men have to pay for long continu ance in the political arena, and must frequently make them sincerely envy raw aspirants wrho have nothing what ever to answer for in the shape of long-repented blunders.
