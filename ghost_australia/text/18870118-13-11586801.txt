CURRENT LITERATURE. % Like many other people who have a good deal to say, Mr James I'j croft has put on the time to say it too long His Oxford Memories A Retrospect after Fifty Years (11 Bentley and Son would have been very interesting had the writer retained the faculty of setting down the best things he has remembered. As it is his memory is indistinct, and the retrospect is clouded and blurred for want of perspective. Things trivial and of ephemeral value are recorded at as great length, and with as much particularity as those which, if Mr Pjcroft could have remembered them and maintained some check over his garrulity, would have been of real interest As it is, we have to delve in the rubbish heap 01 very small talk fragments of old college jests, state moralities, stones how obscure persons went to the bad with modern instances, curiously mixed up with the chatter of the cricket field Tor Mr. Pycroft was not only an Oxford don but a great cricketer, and perhaps his reminiscences in his latter character are the most interesting portion of his book He is old enough to remember the celebrated Mr Ward, the father of modern cricket, and has played with Alfred Mynn, T Pilch, and Harvey 1 allows, those ' giants of the game ' He claims the honour of having inaugurated the Oxford and Cambridge match at Lord a in the year 1836 In those days round band bowling was not invented, but Mr Pjcroft controverts the common notion that the underhand balls were necessarily slow Mr bellows a balls used to frighten the best butter. Pilch would play them with his head half turned away Box, the famous Sussex wicketkeeper, used to say that no man could play Mr Fellows on south ground Clarke and Mynn were about equally dreaded. The horserace took all the Not ingham s wickets in the first innings Among the batsmen the most famous were the, whose name was Wanostrocht, a school master at Blackheath, Taylor, of Sussex, Lord Frederick Beauclerk, Newman, Sir V Bathurst (returned the finest man who ever came to Lords), Budd Adams, Redgate be Mr Pycroft is very discursive in what he has to say of cricket 50 years ago, but he writes with much enthusiasm, and is here better worth reading than when he Oils his pages with stones of how many of his early college fellows went to the bad, and homilies against running into debt As to School day empire it is curious to find Mr Pjcroft testifying that Dr Arnold at l<Uf,by was in the early days quite as much noted for seventy to his boats House, of Eton (who, by an absurd blunder, in dubbed SMargosus Otbtlw) Arnold was lucky enough to have his life written by Stanley), his favourite pupil, but to all his pupils he was not what he was to Stanley ltugbyiam, as developed out of Stanleys famous biography, is responsible for a good deal of that progress which, born at Rugby, came to maturity at bullet Of the stones of town and gown rows one of the best which Mr Pycroft tells is of one 6th of November, when the 'Varsity men, disgusted with one Bill Spinks of the town, who year after year used to lick their best men, subscribed to bring down Peter Crawley, the pugilist Peter had been the champion of England by his victory (a fluke) over Jem Ward, and seemed the right for the occasion So on the eventful evening Peter, clad in cap and gown, sallied out with the Varsity host and sent William Spinks flying In the midst of the fray the proctor, afterwards Bishop of Hereford, came up, and was buffeted and hustled about till Crawley, coming up to the rescue, floored his assailants right and left After running with his torn garments from the mCUe, the eminent proctor is reported to have exclaimed, " A wonderfully fine young man with his fists that, who is he pray I particularly wish to know Mr Pjcroft would have made his book more readable if he had compressed his two volumes into one, and given us less of moralising on the faults of the time Fifty years, according to him, have not made much improvement in society Men bowl round hand, and drink more chain pugne. 'I They are richer and more luxurious, but they are not happier Riches have become a snare to virtue We pay dearly for our commercial prosperity if, indeed, we are able to boast of that-by an increasing town population, becoming more and more lawless and difficult of control Railways and telegraphs are very well, but we are not happier because we travel faster and live faster The game of life in fact, has become like about what instead of long three events come off in the time for one There is more money lost and won, and finer play on the whole, but the pace is greater, and wears us out lins in Mr Pycroft a testimony after 50 years of life A House Divided Against Itself (W Blackwood and Sons is one more novel from Mrs Oliphant, who should by this time have written more novels than any woman or man living It is disagreeable in tone, but as clever as usual in the characterisation All the personages are unheroic and not one of them interesting The subject is an old one, and there is no plot to speak of the antagonism between the two sides into which the family is divided comes about we don't know how, and is made up we scarcely know why Neither husband nor wife is greatly to blame, and neither claims our sympathies. Except Frances, one of the twin daughters, there is not a single member of the family who act from a respectable motive, and some are utterly vile and worldly And yet, by sheer charm of writing and delicate analysis of character, Mrs Oliphant manages to make her story readable the worldly wife and mother, with her passionless jet amiable nature, is one of the most successful of Mrs. Oliphant a portraits in this line As for the men, they are, us usual in all women's novels, utterly insipid and characterless the hero, whom 1 ranccB marries in the end, is a dummy, who does and says nothing to deserve his good fortune And Lord Markham the brother, is an impossible carried ture A sad who, out of nothing, developed into a kind of hero in the sudden manner usual in novels. Mrs Oliphant a superiority in her craft becomes very striking when we compare her work with that of any of her young lady rivals In I esto re Demand, for instance, by the author of Miss Molly (Blackwood and Sons), we have the same kind of life, but here it is all one dull level of bread and butter loves, and boarding school talk Nothing happens till the people talk and make love throughout Nearly every one is good' but it is such a deadly sort of goodness 'there must be a demand, we suppose, for this kind of novel, or it would not be produced Is it better or worse than the new fashion of the shilling thriller? There is one for example, with the knave of hearts on the cover, called, for no earthly reason, Di iver Thorne, b) Evelyn Owen (Bristol J W Arrowsmith) This would be very dreadful, if it could, in the style of the late Hugh Conway, who has much to answer for in the world he has left but there is no cohesion among the parts, and no perceptible motive fearful crime are committed There are ghosts and mysterious appearances An idiot boy hovers over the scene, who has left a good deal of his spirit in the story People cheat at cards, and are detected, and also one at other, and are hanged Other people make experiments on orphan boys who also play at cards and have blood coming out over their honours , but what it all means, or why it should be thus and not some other way, it would be hard to au) This Shilling dreadful is but a poor kind of business, but Evelyn Owen is no good hand at it
