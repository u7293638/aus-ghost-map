""WHEEE ARE THE NINEP" A SEB_:OS BT THE REV. H, P.-LIDDON, D.D., CANON op ST. PAUL'S. " And Jesus answering said, Were there no» ten cleansed? But wbere are the nine P-Lu__ xvii. 17. In order to do justice to the act of mercy whioh is recorded of our Lord in to-day's gospel," and to the subsequent conduct of tho lepera, it is necessary, my brethren, to remind ouvselveïof the physical, of the religious, and of the social misery which leprosy i_i volved. The leprcsy of the Bible belonged to the class of skin diseases which aro eppooially provoked by tho dry, hot 'atmosphere of Epypt and th« east acting upon alarge, exposed surfaceof thohumsnbody. It i~ what is known aa iha Mosaic or white lsproay. Its symptoms aro euumeratuù in the 15th ef Levi- ticus. It was the leprosy of Miriam, of NsAmiw, of Gahazi, of King Uzziah. lb was little better than, a living death, lîeginning on the surface of the body, it poisoned all the springs of lifo. And to crown all, no cure waa pos-iblo, r>_cej>t by divine interposition. No skill of man in -that age oould «ope with-; thin foul diabase. *' Am I a prod ?" exclaiined'the King of Isratl on roceiving the {Syrian ambassadors on behalf of Noswna--" Am I a poy. that this man doth send nato me to recover a man oí bia leprosy." * And leprosy was not merely physical misery. It had in Jewish eyes, and on divino authority, o religious significance. It was viewed, not co -anon as a punishment of sin, but as a symbol of the ex- propien ot sin's prescita and ttinmph. It waa tha outwa ' 1 si n of an inw« rd enrso. It wa», sotq. put it, a Muu'amcnt of mo".i' "*tth; and, ar-ocrdingly, tho leper was bidden by th"1 ij.jioot law to boar about ¿n him tie emblems of the dead. Hjs garments wei-o . root, as if in mourning for_his dead Felf. His head wan hare, as was bho wont of those who held converso with 1ho dead. His lip was oovered. Ho could only bo Itally cleansed with tho cedar wood, the hysaop, and tho ? carlet, as those who had boon defiled by con- tact with a coróse. To this physical and religion« misery tbaro wtw added another--a social one. The lopor waa ba_i_ha«î frota tho «oinpauionship which trùçht hive saothod, if it eould not euro, his pain.

Hy bWt-ran, Ho who know what was In mjm, aa_ who. had already tasted BO inuoh of humana ki grati- tude, could not have been surprised at the a__iuak oí the nine lepers. Bub He calls attention to it as having, like Hiß own merciful act itself, a typiml value. The averages of gratitude and ingratitud* among men do not vary much from ago ta aga; and' what here took place on a small scale would reappear, 1 He knew full weil, again and affain in the history of Chnatendom and of tbo world. Of Christiana it ia probably true at this moment- literally true-that about ten per cent, ara grateful to God for His mercies in nature and in grace, and ninety per cent, are more or less conspicuously wanting in anything that can be properly termed gratitude. And if this, or any- thing Uko it, be the true state of the ease, it is a fact which certainly deserves attentive consideration; for ~ant of gratitude towards Jesus Christ on the part of a Christian seoni3, at first sight, quite inexplicable, for gratitude is a natural virtue. Man is capable of gratitude, even in some of ita highest forms, without the grace of Christ at all. And for us Christians how overwhelming are the motives to gratitude ! The number, tho magnifl. eenee, tho praotical value of the blessings which wa receivo from God through Jesu» Christ our Lord, conspire with our sense # of His love and Big generosity, to make gratitude, one would think, strictly inevitable. And yet, as if anticipating what would be the real state of the cap«, scripture insista with great copiousness and f arvour, upon what might havo been, we should have thought, taken for granted. "In everything give thanks," sayB St, Paul, "for this ia the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you." "Whatsoever ye Colossiaá« do in this vorld or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thank to God and the Father by Him." " Be careful yon Philippians, for nothing j but in everything, by prnyer and Bupplioation with thanksgiving, lot your requests be mado known unto God." Of the unthankfulnoas whioh BO seriously depresses and blights our whole modern Christian life, ono reason, in many cases, is that we do not seo our great henefaotor. In the miracle before us, you will remember, tho lepers were still nncleansod when thoy loft our Lord that, in obedience to His command, they might show thomeelves to the puesta. ' When the miracle was wrought upon thorn, the worker was out of sight. He would bave walked on towards the village ; and »hoy, avoiding tho village ra pbodievaco to tho | law, wtre pursuùi|. their way towards Jerusalom. Yes, at that moment of awe and blessing, they did not aeo Hira. No shadowy form hovered around them to remind them that He waa present in power to bless IHKI heal theia. No word like the "I will; bo thou clean," which had healed the leper at Carjernaum two year» before, now fellupon their ears. No hand waa >aia*d over them ia felt benediction ; and yet, minute by minuta, the foul disease upon thom waa disap« peanng ; when, or how, they could not exactly toll ^ and at lft?t, they saw- thoy could not ¿onbfc it-they saw that they weio healüd, but the hcalor Iliir.sefi they did not seo. As now in Ilia church, so thon li» waa out of sight, even when His aobion was most felt ' and energetic. His words still lingered iu their ears ¡ but it wa« not imponible, amid the distractions of a now scud, to forgot their import; and thus, out of the ten men, nine actually did forget it. Now what is this but. a pamplo of what pasies ia our óVíily life P Numbera who are hero know what it is to have reeovered frpm illness, perhaps very ww-UHaa illnesn. God, by His providence, has directed ua to" neo moana whioh might assist-whioh oosdd nat insure-recovery. Wa have reeovered, and now we proceed to aouount for our recovery.

Men do not see if they said out what they think-do not seo the good of than-fulness. The value of prayer, of course, in Christian eyoa is plain onongh. ChrUtians behevo that certain blea__ga are to be obtained from God by the ii_4r_- entality of prayer ; and not to px$r -l to forfeit the blessings yrhieii prayer obtains. w Bn* ÜianWn-less," men Bay'to themselves-" what does it win for us that is not already ours without it P juan already enjoy s that for which he gives thanks, and God surely does not want our thanks as if they were a sort of equivalent for His bounty. Ha blesses us out of the joy of doing KO ; and whether we thank Him or not must be of small concern to Buch a being as He is." Certainly, my brethren, God does pot expect to be repaid for His benevolence by any equivalent in the way of thanksgiving that you or I can poBsiblyoffer Hinu And yet He will have us thank Him, not for His own Bake, but for ours. He, enthroned in His uncreated perfections, He loses ripeari lose--nothing, though we, to our loss, should forget Him altogether. But we carmot be wanting to the great duty of thankfulness without being un- true to the very fundamental Jaw of our existence, Without the worst results upon ourselves. For what is thankfnlnees, suoh as God demands ? What is it but that which is at the bottom of all real human ex- cellence-the frank acknowledgment of truth? Just is prayer is the recognition of our dependence upon God amid the darkness and uncertainties of the future, so thankfulness is the reoognition of our in- debtedness, to God for the blessings of the past. And to acknowledge truth like this is always moral Btrength : to refuse to acknowledga truth like this is always moral weakness. And this law is not the less true of individual Christians and of Christendom. Nations, churohes, men, who forget their one great benefactor, are in a sure way to ruin, temporally and eternally. God can- not be forgotten with impunity. Thankfulness, like the rivers whioh flow into the ocean, and which are again replenished from it-thankfulness is the source of new blessings to the soul. Only in thankful hearts is the Christian lifo securely maintained, and to that life it contributes thrco important results. It first of all stimulates na most powerfully to active well-doing. A man will do out of gratitude more-much more-than he will do out of fear or out of hopo of reward. ^ Thankfulness for redemption was the motive power of a life like that of St. Paul, ¿a it has been the motive power of all the greatest end most fruitful lives that have lived in Christen- dom. "He died for all, and they whioh live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him that diod for them and rose again "-this is the motto of all such lives. Gratitude, like love, lives not in words, butin deed and in truth. Often those who feel most what has been done for them say least about it ¡ but thoy do most. Gratitude oan work ¡ gratitude can Buffer ; gratitude can porsovere ; but one thing gratitude, for tho inestimable love of God in the redemption of the world by oar Lord Jesus Christ-one thing gratitude cannot do j it cannot bring itself to feel that it has done enough. It can- not in this world lio down with a* souse that it has really paid off its debt to the Kodeomor. And, again, gratitude makes worship, especially publio worship, real, serious, reverent. Praise is tho Very soul of the ohurch's worship, and praise is the Voice of thankfulness. The first object, wo aro told twice every day, which makes Christians assemble and meet together, is that thoy may render thanks for the groat benefits which they have received at the hands of God. And these thanks are expressed in the greater number of the psalms, in the hymns, in the canticles, in the Te Deum beyond, porhaps, other hymns-(who but the thankful can popsibly understand Buch a psalm as that ï),-above all, in the holy sacrament, on that very account named by tho first Chiistians the ouoharist, wherein, to uso the words of our prayer-book, we entirely doaire God's fatherly goodness mercifully to accept this our service of praise and thanksgiving. It has been said that onr public worship would bo much loss unworthy of Him to whom it is addrosBod if, beforo beginning, each Christian would think exactly what ho most needs to obtain by prayer at the hands of God. It may be said, with at least equal truth, that this improvement, go much to bo desirod, would bo scoured if wo all of us had more of tho spirit of tho ono lopor in tho gospel, and less of the spirit of tho nina,-if each act of worship could be a conscious turning back on the road of life, to fall at tho iledoemor's feet and give Him thanks for the incalculable blossings of pardon and of grace which those who know anything about Him-anything about then_olvoa-know that He and Ho alone has won for them. And lastly, thankfulness hore on earth is the boBt possible preparation for the spirit and for the life of Heaven. Heavon is tho home of thankful souls. The occupations of Heaven would bo misery to those who feel not gratitude " Blepsing, and honour, and .thanksgiving, and power and glory, and might, bo unto our God for ever and over." " Worthy is tho Lamb that was slain to receive power, and wisdom, and riches, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing." How shaü wo sing those songs, or any of tho songs of the radeoniod, hereafter, if here and now vre do not learn their spirit ? If tho habits which are fceing formed by us in thin life will bo carried by each of tis into tho otornal world, how earnestly should wo pray God to e;ivo us that " duo sonso of all His mercies that ourhcart.3 may bo unfoignodly thankful, and that we show forth His praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving ourselves to HÍH «ervioe," to whom, tho Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, bo ascribed all honour, powor, might, majosty Ond dominion, henceforth and for ever 1
