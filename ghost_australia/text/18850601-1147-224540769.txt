POETRY ORIGINAL. BEYOND THE THRESHOLD. By Atha. Never again shall I sit in the gloaming, Hushing and stilling the beat of my heart, For the quick tread that announces thy coming, Never again the swift blushes will start. When 'mid the darkness that surges around me, Vainly I look for the promise of light, How shall I long for the love that once crowned me, Ere on my soul fell the blackness of night. Turn where I will, there are pleasures and gladness, Music's soft flow, and joys almost divine, Radiant eyes that seem mocking my sadness, Over the flow of their amber-hued wine. Beautiful forms are whirled by in the dances, Faces that flash on me out of a dream ! Shine, ye bright jewels ! and ye brighter glances, Melt my cold heart with your glittering beams. Coldly I roam 'mid the glow and the glitter, Careless of splendours that weary me so, Feeling, alas ! that my heart has grown bitter Under its burden of sorrow and woe. Still must I stifle my grief and my sighing, Deck my wan face in the ghost of a smile ; Chatter and sing while my hopes are all lying, Dead in the depths of my bosom the while. Little they think when my laugh rings the loudest, Of the torn heart that is beating below ; Or when the rose on my cheek burns the brightest, Little they dream 'tis despair feeds the glow. Never again shall I wander beside thee, Through the loved scenes where bright memories dwell Peace be with thee, and sweet rest eternal Be thine through the ages, my darling â€” Farewell.
