THE SHIFTING SCENE. CONVENTIONAL GHOSTS. (By WahjU.) I was reading some time back the report of the proceedings of a learned soon, in London- forget its precise title, but it had the! word 1 Psychical " in it And I know it must have been very very erudite, for the committee had endless combinations of awsomonic letters after its causes, and the mention of professors and doctors was as common as gooseberries not that goose borrtuM really are so common in some parts, but I suppose they are as common as ghosts, if you know where to look for them Evidently the lntmbLrH of the sect) do know, for they produce the most startling and direct testimony from Spiiithmd of the existence of ghosts none of your common, everyday) appari- tions but species with excellent references, so to spend! spooks whose bona find a was as unquestionable in the spirit as their lives had been without reproach in the flesh For myself I like to think that Chancer and Position do not end with the " little sleep " which leads our lives Lion if we are such stuff as dreams are made of see no reason why a life of good conduct and praiseworthy) endeavour should not be ice >g used when the time comes for the passess r to learn spirits lily once more the scenes of his mind ino Bim rags And, of course, the same is at hand thanks to the efforts of societies like the one I refer to, when the regular appearance of the thesis of dear departed will be a matter of course when it will be hardly) more surprising to meet Tones the st cessful sharebroker in ghostly shadow and other than to see him rushing for his trim However, a line to this train of speculation It is refreshing to obst see that so far the Ghosts that have been run down and fully identified (at the police to)) belong almost entirely to good families Still there brother ghost Yes , there are other Ghosts Ghosts, I f Lucy, winds some of these profound) erudite society s take no account of, though, they are sure!) less fascinating to contemplate than the most and beat attested visitor from another spine Ghosts of the land) Are they les wonderful when they troop unbidden and, peril for, unwelcome across the poet's idle page or the mind of the most matter of fuel of us ? lost in this phase of the unreal if it is the unreal-T have observed that the most prosaic me sometimes as susceptible as the hyper imaginative I walked in the broad sunlight the other day) into an empty and abandoned pleasuring, and found it peopled- with ghosts You could scarcely) move for fear of jostling and recommending the spectral company) - did you radios pace this way some dear memory started with life, a step that way are something as poignant as " remembered kisses after death," is fired through all your consciousness 'lifted was the great pavilion, with its sandy frippery all girls in the pier nig sunlight, the head) cut walk leading to the ter of ed summer houses, the swings and roundabouts, stupid) still red-painted fatalities, if ever there were any And as a) e being footsteps drew my accuser busy again tow in the great dam tug hall, the melancholy sense of this deserted pleasure haunt grew and ripened, till at last it overshadow of 1 all else beside And then a emu us to this inn action was wrought himself) era of the scornful force in ance of every Psychical society for a few moments The whole place was fined gc 1 as in the days of yore only with his disH once I remembered it roaring and shouting in the days of its present ceaseless stir in length and s exhibit noises of pulsating life Now the place was crowded but sound there was none the floor of the d racing hill is full of dangers, and it was in them to watch (he was seriousness of realisation r ghastly to observe the photographic icrsiinihtiilc of talk and yet its absolute weirdness A 1 larrikin and his id) love, in perfect step came as filling b) ;
