Amina waking cried, 'Where am I,' Elvino thrusting her from him while the villagers told her of her suppo_sed crime. The next day the betrothal ring waa returned, and Elvino pro posed to Liza. In the evening as the chief persons in the story were sitting before the inn the lord appeared, and told the true story, but was disbelieved. During his recital the phantom appeared crossing over the old ruined bridge, the passage of which was ex tremely dangerous. Elvino at once saw his error, and would have rushed to the rescue of his first love, but was stopped by the lord. With horror it was seen that the bridge cracked, but did not brake, and the lamp was shaken from her grasp, yet carefully she still walked on proving that she was in a state of somnambulism. She spoke in her sleep of Llvino, and felt for the ring which hehad taken from her. This he then placed on her finger, and she awoke to find that the unjust accusations of her lover and the villagers were retracted, and she is once more united to the one she loved.
