OLIPHANT, Author of 'The Son of his Father, w 'Sir Tom,' 'The Chronicles of Carlingford,' 'Neighbours on the Green,' 'Oliver's Bride,' &c;, &c;, [AIX EIGHTS RESERVED.} Chapter XL VJL In the moment of that movement, half dragged by the fast and firm hold upon her, half pushing her captor, and tofrwi ttiw tai 1 fl i n g the horror and panic of her arrest and discovery, T^titja bad tame to form in her nund the explanations she would give to Jotm, U it were John : or if it ahonld happen to be Letty (which was impossible— but all thing, are possible to guilt and mortal terror — ) die indignant mineriority with which she would send her away. Bat when she twisted herself round and confronted in the light of the ante room which seemed a brilliant illumination after the dark. chamber within, tie face of Mary * Mary ! Letitia's strength collapsed, her self -command nbandnm-d her, the gasping breath came in a hoarse rattle from her throats her jaw fell, her eyes seemed to turn npon their orbits. She hung by the hand that held her half insensible, helpless, overwhelmed, like a bundle of clothes, « if she faaSl no longer any sensation or impulse of her own. The only thing that kept her from falling was the grip upon her hand, and the support of the arm which Mary had put round her to reach tt. She was stunned and stupefied, scarcely alive enough to be afraid, though there began to grow upon tier mind by degrees a consciousness that this woman who held her had been mad — which even when she had full command of herself was what Letitia feared most in all the world. Mary was ialler than her prisoner. She seemed taller now than ever she bad done in her life, ber eyes were shining like stars, her nostnlB dilated with yyi^tpmmt and strong feeling, her colour coming and going. She did not speak, but with her other band held the milk to Letitla'a lips, siway« with her arm supporting her, as one might offer drink to a child. ** Drink it,' she said at last, 'drink it!' in a keen whisper that seemed to cut the silence like a knife. No mercy, no pity were in Mary's eyes. ' She held LetitU'B wrist in a grip of iron, and pressing upon her, forcing her head back, held the glass to her lips, ''drink it !_ drink it!' The straggle was but a momentary one, and noiseless. They were like two shadows moving, swaying, forming but one in their speechless conflict. Then came the sudden crash of the shattered glass, as Letitia, recovering her forces in her desperation, with a sodden twist of her arm dashed it from her antagonist's hand. The content* were spilled between them, and formed a white pool npon the floor, from which, instinctively, each woman drew back: and there they stood gazing at each other again. Letitia's every nerve was trembling with terror, physical fear surmounting the first panic of discovery, which was a terror of the mind. She expected every moment an aedt of ™*J'i—». in which she might be torn limb from limb — though at the same time calculating that the mad woman might loose her hold, and there might be a possibility of dfffpf»*t^ flight, and of all the household on her aide protecting her, and sudden relief from every terror. The nature of the emergency brought back to her after the first speechless horror, h** power of thought and calculation. She kept her eyes upon Mary's «yes, stall wild with fright, but awakened to a vigilant watch and keeu attention to every indication of the other's looks. But this *nu- not the Mary whom Letitia had ever seen before. Her face had cleared like a sky after rain. It was like that sky ethereally pale, y^fwl, -with & transparence that seemed to come from some light beyond. Mary was no longer a weak woman distracted by orer tenderness, by visionary compunctiona, humbleness, uncertainty — but clear and strong, with the quivering, expanding nostrils, the wide open eyes and trembling lips of inspiration. She held her captive still, though she stood a little apart from her, grasping Cu-t in her own Letitza'a shut band. 'What did you pat in it,' she said, 'to kill my boy?' ' Mary !' Letitia panted. ** Why do you try to frighten me? — your boy? — you have told me you had no boy ? ' ' That you tried to kill — before he was born — that you drove out of my knowledge — for I was mad. I know it all now — and yon did it: what did you put in that to kill my boy*' There came a shriek from Letitia s Labouring breast. The words maddened her again into frantic terrur. She made a vrHd effort to free her hand. Though it was a shriek, and intense as the loudest outcry, it wan subdued bv the other terror of being heard and discovered. Between the two she hung Biiapended, not able altogether to coerce nature, but still keeping it* expression under. 'Mary,' she cried, 'let me go— let me go!' ' What was it vou put in it to kill him V* ' Mary ! Let uie go— let me go V *' Not till you tell me : a&d; then you shall go— where you mill : away from here— away from my boy.' They were women not used to any such struggle, and feeling in the depths of their heartu that to at niggle so for any reason was a, shame to them : and every moment as it passed brought this consciousness more near to Mary, who in the first shock was capable of anything- Perhaps her hold loosened, perhaps Letitia felt the magnetic effect of that relaxation even before it was palpable. All at ouce she fiung out her arm which Mary held, and threw something which was in it into the dull arra.ll fire which smouldered in the grate, and which was kept there, notwith standing the warmth of the July nights, for the usea of the sick room. There was a faint clang of glass against the bars, and then the two figures separated altogether and stood apart, still gazing at each other with punting breath. Letitia had felt that if she ever got free from the grasr that held her— if ever she could throw off the hand that was like velvet yet closed ou her like iron, there was but one thing to do, to fly, to get help, to make every body understand that. Lady Froginorc, mad as the had once been before had burst in on her and tried to kill her. But now that she had freed herself she did not take to flight as she intended. She drew away a step nearer the door, that she might retain that alternative — and kept the most watchful eye upon her antagonist, ready in a moment to fly. But she did not do so. Her breath began to come more easily. Perhaps she was relieved that the attempt had failed— which at once relaxed the tragic tension of her nerves : at all events her heart gave a leap of satisfaction that there was no proof agM-jnt. her. The milk spilt on the floor had soaked into the carpet ? the vial was fused into liquid metal, which could betray no one, in the fire She W goue through a terrible moment but it was over. She fell back upon the wall and supported herself against it, propping up the shoulders which still Leaved with the storm that was post — and then uhc said in something like her uuual \'oice— ' What is this all about, Lady Frogtnore *' Mary had grown restless like Letitia. The first impulse of passion and excitement failed in her, it was bo unusual to her gentle Ijtosotu. She looked at this woman who stood defiant., staring at her, with a look of wonder and doubt. 'If I have done you any wrong — ' Bhe beganvith a quaver in her voice : and then paused. *' Vou know,' she began again, ' that I have not done you wrong. You stole into the room in the dark, you put some thing in hia drink. Oh,' cried Mary, clasping her Lauds, 'HI had uut come at that moment, if God had not sent me, my boy might have been niunlercd. How dare you stand and face me there ! Go, go :' She stamped ber foot upon the floor. *'Go! ' Your cliild,' Letitia said, with a suiile of scorn. *' Vou who never had one ! Vou have mid so a hundred times. ' Mary's lips opened as if to reply — then she pauseiL. ' Who am I to be angry V she said. ' I have given her cause to speak. Oh, go,' she cried, 'go, I will uot accuse 3-ou. You know what you have douc, and I know, and that will separate us for ever anil ever. No one, no 011c shall come near my child to harm him again, for his mother will be there. Go, yon wicked woman, go.* ' Vou are mad,*1 cried Letitia, ' who wool J believe a mad woman ? Say what you please, do you think anyone will Ijntp*1 to you » Von are mad, mad I IT1 have yon put in an asylum. Ill have you shut up. I'll— Oh, save me from her, she's . mad, she's mad I' cried Letitia, with a shriek. There was someone coming — and Mary had put forth her hands as If to seize her again. Letitia rau past her to the door, and there stood for a moment panting, vindictive ' Da you tuiuk they will ieuve him witii a waH woman. 71* she cried, theu gave another shriek and fled ; for it was not John as she thought, who was coming to protect her,' but another cloaked figure like a repetition of Mary's, who appeared on the other side. She did not stop for further parley, but ran wildly, with the precipitation of terror, iuto the long, eflcut, dun corridor. ' IVhaX has happened 1 What is it ?' said Agues, terrified going up to her «ister who stood with clasped bauds in the middle of the room, the light falling upon her face Mary pot her anus round her giving her a close momentary embrace, which was half joy to see some oue come who would stand by her, and half an instinctive uiotioa to tupport herself and derive strength from her sister's touch. ' I came in time,' she said. ' I saved him. He is safe. I will never leave my child a^ai/i. Oh never while she is here ? ** 'What is it: What is it, ilary :*' Man' told her ttory, leaning upon her sister, holding her fast, whispering in herear. Kven Letitia's cries and vituperations had been subdued, whispers of passion and desperation, no more. I-ut to Agues it scenietl an incredible talc, a vision of the still confused and wauilcrin-; brain. She soothed Mary, patting her ahouMcr with a trembling hauil, saying 'Xo, no. You must have dreamt it. No, no, my dear : oh, that ~wau not the dauber,' in si troubled voice. Mary ilvtvtcheil herself from her sister, putting Agnes away gently but with decision. She took off the b.-mutl which site had wore all this time, and titd the 'veil which had dropped from it over her head. Then she went iuto the inner room without a word. To pass iutn that silent and (iarkenetl room oat of tho agitation of the other was like going into another world. The breathing of the iiursc, hi her deep sleep tilled it with a faint regular sound. The patient did not stir, llary sat down at the foot uf tlte bed, like a. sliadow. Her figure in its dark dress seemed to be absorbed in tie dimness and piss out of sijrfit altogether. Agues stood at the door and looked into the , chamlKM1 fall of sleep and silcucc, weigh wl | down Uy the mystery about her. Ha*l tliat I fantastic, honible scene really happeucd, or , had it-bucn but a dream ? There iron: still traces on the carpet of soint- thiu^: white tlial ha.l ^.*akcd into 11, auJ her fool ba-l i-mshol a portion of the broken, ^lass upon the floor. Was it true! Was it jH.^iMe it could U rrue? Sheato*hl wondering on t lie verge of the stillness that closwl over iht tick room in ' which her sister had disappeared and beeu , sH'aDojved up. It is strange at any time toj look iuto a chamber thus occupied. The Eeeblc patient in the bed noiseless in the slumber of weakness, the watcher by his side invisible in the gloom, a point of wakeful, anxious life among those shadows. The nurse sleeping heavily in the background, invisible, added another tv^'''* circuin&taucc; to the mystery — nurses of tliat class do uot sleep 60. Was it true ? Could it be true ? She Was called back to Cue common pasBace of afiairs by a faint knock at the door of the ante-room, and froing to it found Ford, conducted by a sleepy maid who had been roused to prepare Lady Froginore's room. 'Where is my lady. Miss Hill*' said the anxious Ford. ** I can't find my lady. It's late and she's tired and I must get her to bed.' *' No, Ford ; she will not leave herjson to night.' ' Oh, Miss Hill, her son : she will die of it : or she will go wrong again, and what will everybody say to me for allowing this ? She must come to bed. She wast tome to bed !** ' No one can make her do so. Ford — the nurse has goue to sleep, someone ia wanted here. I will etav by her, and if I cau get her t0£0 to bed I will.' ** Vou will both kill yourselves,' cried Ford aggrieved, 'and what will be the advantage in tliat ? Vou may, if you please. Miss Hill, X have no authority ; but my lady, my lady I It is as much as her life is worth. Asnes bade the maid brin^ her some shawls, and lie down Iiersel£. .Slic weutsofdy into the sick room and put a. wrap round Mary's shoulders, who raised her pale £aca, visible through the dark in its whiteness to kiss her in token of thanks. Agues permitted her hungry heart au anxious look at the patient, and satisfied herself, to the relief of various awful doubts tliat had been growing ou her, tiiat he breathed softly and re^uLtrly, though almost inaudlbly. She endeavoured in vain to rouac the slccpin' wotuati behind, and then she herself retired into the Jtnte rooiu. Was it true? Could it he possible? As she sat there, realising the extraordinary way in which Mary and she had been allowed to come in and take possession, when she perceived that no one came near them, tliat Letitia, did not return, did not even send a servant, Uut gave up the patient and the charge of him without a wonl, without the slightest notice of their poaahle wants, or care for them, a sense of the strangeness uf it all grew npon her. Could Mary's tale be be roused — the house fallen into complete silence as if everyone had gone to bed. Mary and she, as it seemed the only two waking in all the place. Could it be true ? Could it be true? _An hour or two later the scene had changed, the sick room was faintly illuminated through the closed curtains with the li^lit of the morning. And Agues looking in, through the half open uoorway, tuet Mary's look, her face like the clear, pale morning, a sort of ecstasy in her wakeful eyes. She did cot seem to have moved siuce Agnes threw the shawl round her. nor lud ^b*1 *d.osed those widely - opened eyes. When the bad given her sister tliat look they returned to the bed where dimly visible. There wats almost a chill ia tiling clear and keen, above illusion, the light of reality, yet the light of a vision. As Agues looked everything returned to its immovable stillness again. The pale boy sleeping, the pshi mother vAtcliiuir the uurse iK^iiml come into sight with her head thrown back, a potent witness iu lier insensibility. Was it true ? Could it be true t CuAPrta XLTIIL John Parke woke next morning to see his wife iti her dressing-gown, moving vaguely about the room, a shadow against the full summer light that came in at all the windows. He could not make out at first what she was doing prowling about in a curious luouotouous round from window to window, iiausin' to look out, as it eeenied, at thi- edge: of ibc blind, first of one, then of another. He watched her for a little while in vague alarm. During all this time el vague but painful suspicion was in John's mind.

' Oh, the hoy ?' she cried, with an impatience that was balm to his heart. Then she went ou, not looking at him, ' Fancy, who arrived last night — Mary, crying for her child ? ** ' Lady Froguiore 1' ** Mary— ^and calling for ber cliOd — slie wlio always denied that she ever had one.

I trill never see that woman again.' ? John went softly along the corridor, half dressed, ashamed, miserable. Something had happened more than he could understand, pcxuB^n mure uu ne woaul ever understand. The faoosewasall silent, irra.pt as in a garment in the morning sunshine, which came in by the great staircase windows and flooded everything It m stai very early. His step made a sound which ran all through and through it He could not be noiseless as the women were who stale-about, and met, and had their encounters and nobody was ever the wiier. He thought it was in the middle of the night that this arrival most have occurred which seemed to bun lilce a ? dream, and winch as he passed through the sleeping house and felt the stillness of it he began to think most be but some wild fancy of his wife's, something which could not Im» tm» WliAn Tia nn.l.oJ nnaM *!... .!_.._ _r the ante-rootn a -dart tisare rose hurriedly out of a chair, and met him with the dazed look of a person disturbed and half asleep. ' Mia. Hill !' he cried. Then it was trne : She pat np her hand and -said 'Hush.' Then, after ainoment, ' He is alseep, like a baby ; he has never stirred.1' ' Are you eure — that he is asleep ?' ..l^tiS™^4 ti^nT**.' .he, =M. unuoavqiHim' ana, ne was so quiet, xes, yes, he is asleep ; breathing faintly, bat yoa can hear him. Oh, safe and sound asleep !' ' My wife (old me — his mother — ' 'She is there,' said Agnes, beckoning him to the door of the mner room. He stood and looked in for a moment, with his clonded and troubled flee, leaning against the lintel. Mary's ear had been caught by the sound. She looked np and met his eyes with that ethereal clearnessof countenance, the exaltation I otneranrased and awakened soul She looked him in the face with a mild serenity and peace and smiled in recognition then turned her eyes to the bed as if to show Mm the boy softly sleeping there, Behind the nnrse still slept in die easy chair. To John it seemed as if it were all a dream, of which there was no explanation. How did it come about that the sick room hid passed into the keeping of these two, arriving mysteriously during the night, whom bis wife most have risen from his side to receive, of whom he had heard nothing? The nurse asleep, all the usual faces gone, the mother who had disowned him mttfnir in ri»ut attitude of love by Mar's side— what did it all 'This is all very strange,' he said, drawing back from the door. 'I find you here m possession whom I thought faraway— and the mother who was so estranged. Did yoa come down from the skies? Is it safe to leave her there? Is she ? ' Agnes looked at the man who was comparatively little known to her, who was a man, frighteningand disturbing herinhisstrang undress in the midst of . the silent house. Shewasanelderly stnglewoman, unaccustomed to give any account of herself to strange men, and her weariness and all the unusual drcmustancistold upon her. Herlipsquivered and her eyes filled. ' Oh,' she said, ' Mr. Pu*ke. do not thin I- urn nuanf .ann ?»., reproach. Things have happened that have brought my sister to her full senses— and to remember everything. I could not keep her from her boy— you would not keep her from her boy——' ' Not if she is sane ; not if it is safe,' paid John.' He looked in again through the half closed door. Once more Mary's keen car caught the sound ,- aad again she turned towards him her face, which was like the morning sky. She had never been beautiful in her best and youngest days. N'ow, with her grey hair ruffled by the night's vigil, her mild eyes cleared from any lilm th.it bad been upon them, kunbejir a:iil in.s|rired with watchful love, her look overawed the anxious spectator. He stepped back again vith a sort ?« ^pwiugetic uiummy. 1 -ion t understand it,' be said, 'yon seem to have some meaning among you that I don't know : bat I cannot be the one to disturb her. I hope ? I hope that I am niakiug no mistake ? '* ' Vou are mat-JTijr no mistake, Mr. Parke ' said Agnes. ' Mar. was ray chad more than her's ; he was my baby. My heart was nearly broken, for I thought he was dying when I came here last night. Bat I trust him in his mother's hands. I give place to her because it ii her right. Do you think I would leave my boy to her if she were not in her full senses, ready to defend him, ready to protect him ' She slopped, choked with the sobs, which, in her great exhaustion and emotion. Amies oould no longer entirely keep down. 'To defend him — to protect him* From what! from what !' John sail. 'Oh, how can I tell? From the perils and dangers of the night ; from carelessness and any Dl wish.' John's voice was choked as that of Agnes' bad been. ' There is no ill wish,' he said He saw, as he spoke, the traces on the floor of something spilt like that nu Iiis wife's gown — and Gome fragments of the broken glass which had escaped Agnes' scrutiny. He did not know what they meant. He was not clever, nor had he any imagination to divine ; but something went through him like a cold blast, chilling him to the heart. He paused ' a moment, staring at the floor, and the won died away on his lips. When John returned to his wife's room Letitia was in bed, and to all 'appearance fast asleep. The poor man was glad, if such a word could be applied to anything he was capable of feeling. He withdrew softly into his dr^ssing-roonj'and sat there for a long time with his head in his hands and his face hidden What to think of the mysterious things that had passed that night he did not know. (To be continued.)
