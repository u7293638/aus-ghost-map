The dreaming gathers gloom, — Bat sleep has not a ghost for bun Whose world bas not a tomb : The shadows of life's outer ekjr Hake darkness for the dreamer's eye I Hie land of dreams I how sad it is, Upon that arilent there, To meet the eye whose glanco, in this, Shall meet me never more ! Ah 1 why most midnight's grief or fear ' Replaoe the oay's despair ; Or they who went, to grieve me here, Gome bade, to grieve me there ; Or' voices filled Mineeyes with tears Whose eiteaoe has been wept for yean? And so, I tonch the dreaming land Upon its wildest shore,' A dreary sen and dreary strand, — The spirit's Labrador : Oh ( never more ite flowery heights Stand out to meet mine eyes ; And, most of all, youth's guiding light* Have fallen from life's skies ; And Hope, that was my pilot then, Will never sail with me again J
