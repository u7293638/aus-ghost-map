Nautical Omens. Mormaicls work dire mischief, whether in the shape of the famous Lorelei of the Rhine, or as frequently seen by sailors, and are sometimes regarded aB the sign of coming disaster. Naturally many terrible aooidonts have followed the discovery of one of these beautiful creatures, and as people are always wailing to put cau6o and effect together, the result has been this belief. A sailor always regards the presence of a shark about a ship a most fatal omen to the sick on board. Ghosts of all sorts” and kinds prefer travelling by water to almost any other mode, and our own Colton Mather tells ub of a spectre that visited a colonial ship, carry ing off in a ghostly canoe seven of the crew at a time. He also says: “ Many persons who have died at sea have been seen within a day of thoir death by friends at home.” There is a superstition that a ship no longer seaworthy, just before breaking up between the strains of wind and wave, has been known to give forth wailing sounds like moaning. The sailor oannot account for this, but he knows too well its import, and loses heart at the melancholy Bound. This is also noticed by Coopor in his 1 ‘ Ned Rover,” where one of the characters is made to say, ‘1A ship which is about to sink makes her lamentations just like any other human being .—“Boston Tran script.” ___________
