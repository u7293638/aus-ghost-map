The,evening was bright and " . cloudless, and the gay party started] off __ ,-a^out nine.-oclock with laugh and jest, to walk to its haunted precincts. .•: | : -ti ., , " Here Guy," shouted Mr. Eaton,! as .., ^ . _......_ troubled with . ghostly: Visitants ; but, if. your adventure Iget: abroad, some meddling vagabond might' attempt; to impose upon theladies credujity and nothing could better assure you protection against such rogues/' i , They walked blithely along, and soon stood before the deserted dwelling. It loomed up gloomy and repellant upon their gaze. The'great ^ door, as it yielded to their touch,gcreaked- dismally upon its rusty hinges, and" the firm tread of Guy, who had volunteered to precede themand strike : a light, resounded hollow through the dis- . • 'mantled hall. The familiar sputter of the match, and ; the faint glimmer of a candle, however, restored their faltering courage. Soon a cheery fire of blazing logs crackled defiantly in the open chimney, and under ... -the influence of light and heat, their recreant gaiety soon returned. They drew forward two moth-eaten lounges: ,that stood: grimly against the t - mouldy wall, and covered them with the blankets which Mrs. Eaton's care had provided. A time stained, forbidding-looking tablej.too,* *was; drawn . out of its obscure ,;corfler,,-v.and made the receptacle for the contents of r two- plethoric - looking hampers. ;; , • •>• -'• : . j • \- " What a novel affair," laughed jolly Maggie. , "A-midnight-picnic m an enchanted house, with Sany quantity ; of •. ghosts expected.to assist'in the consumption of the good thiugs." .... u Oh, Maggie!" 'exclaimed Maud, " you're nol orthodox ; ghosts don't ;$at." . i : " Don't they, though ? Then it is be- , ,pause they, don't get the chance. If I only see one, I'll .ask him to eat, and you see if, he refuses." - He !" laughed Jlobert mischievously. You seem to imagine that all the spirits are of the masculine gender." " Oh, I'll leave all the females to you. f You are wondrous fond of them, you v ,: know.", "Only one, ma chere," he whispered, .. .stooping to cut a knot that defied her deft little fingers. • . While the ladies were busy arranging at their command m a most comfortable manner, two of the ^cullemen explored the rest of the house, but soon returned, saying that they had discovered nothing but dirt and cobwebs. They gathered around the table, ahd \--discussed the-tempting viands. 1 . Song, gay rapartee, and lively chitchat passed the^hastening hours. • ' Midnightl The very word brought with it a* shuddering fear. The ladies : ceased their flippant chat, and cast n'ervous glances over their shoulders. Even the bolder-masculine souls grew "more ^quiet-and less-boastful. ' ' ..." The moments-flew on, and no ghost was '•• seen or heard. Weary eyes, in spiteiof 1 their fear,; grew dull, and sleepily closfed, " Sudden visions, rattling of detached plaster, creaking of loose timbers, or the »r.i melancholy chirp of some bird disturbed ; '.-m Itsfslumber;would start the listless ' :sforms, ;and f.open the >sleepy eyes in lumi- / .-•iione-fear ; but gradually nature overcame \- •'•their sleep fWatchfulnessj -and all, exeppt Guy, :were closely locked an ' the arms; of Morpheus. • { Guy glanced round him with a smile. •-5?fee r curly-head of the intrepid Maggie rested on the Bhoulder of Robert Normian,, where he had placed it, apprehensive 1 of - speedy dislocation of her neck for lier violent nods,. as. she succumbed to her weariness.
