BAPTIST ASSOCIATION OF VICTORIA. The autumnal session was commenced yes terday. The ministers and delegates arrived by train from various parts of the colony, and scarcely a church was. unrepresented. The evening service was largely attended, and the masterly discourse of the Bev, S Chapman en* gaged the . dose attention of the audience dur ing the whole time of its delivery. The rey. gentleman’s sermon was founded in Acts vil, 65 and £6—“But he being full of. the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and, Jesus standing at the right hand of God, and said, behold I see the heavens opened, and Jesus standing on the right band of God.” The discourse, which will be long remembered by those who were privileged to hear it, was .divided into—first, what Stephen saw; and, second, the power that came upon him through the vision that met him. There was a large attendance at the sub sequent communion service, when the Rev, E. Harris, of Portland, delivered a most prac tical address. The ministers: and delegates were much gratified at the. auspicious com* mencement of the session. The programme for to-day may be learned from our advertising columns.
