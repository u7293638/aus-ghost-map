PUNCH AT THE THEATRE. Punch has not been very theatrically disposed this week, and for a variety of reasons is not able to spare that amount of space he is usually pleased to bestow on public amusements. At the Prince of Wales Mr. Barry Sullivan appeared as Hamlet on several nights ; the piece was excellently " mounted," and generally well played. Mr. Robert Heir made his first appearance as the Ghost, and by his sonorous voice and impressive declamation gave a very effective rendering of the part, and fully justified the warm welcome he received. At the Victoria Mr. W. O'Neil, in addition to Shaun the Post, has appeared, with his usual success, as Miles Na Coppaleen in the " Colleen Bawn." On Saturday night (" St. Patrick's Day in the evening") he will appear in another character in which he earned golden opinions from his Sydney admirers on his former visit hereâ€” and in a drama equally well known to them, called "The Irish Cousin." His popularity and attractiveness continue unimpaired, and as he is not yet " played out," as regards his repertoire, a continuation of success for some time to come probably awaits him. The Mammoth Circus continues to be thronged by the numerous admirers of its diversified attractions ; continually varied programmes, introducing the whole of the talented troupe of lady and gentleman riders, acrobats, gymnasts, trained quadrupeds, and fine stud, greatly tend to promote this desirable result to the managerial treasury, and the public are indebted largely to Mr. Cooke, (whose witticisms, as the Royal Jester, elicit unabated applause and laughter) Mile. Zoyara. and Mr. Wilson, for combining to proclaim such a very attractive and superior entertainment.
