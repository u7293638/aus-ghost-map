Nothing is omitted that can lend intensity to the solemnity of the ona Bion or deepen the effect which the sight of a young and refined woman voluntarily area rating herself from the world must create upon the iniiiKinntion To realise the full members; of the service it is necessary to tin demands the rules under which Indies are permitted to become religious members of the State as of Mete). After a period of probation the postulant proceeds to the ceremony of reception, at which for the first time her hair is cut off, and she (found the white veil of a novice. Then follows an interval of two years, and finally) the ceremony of profession, when the novice takes the black veil of it religious sister and solemnly makes the triple vow of poverty, chastity), and obedience, It is the i revocable step, the final renuncia- tion and its performance, when twelvenovnea repair their own together with all! the imposing ceremonial of the Church of Rome, must awaken the most devout and reverent emotions in those who witness it. At 9 o'clock yesterday the service commenced by a procession of the novices, the professed religious and the clergy), the Archbishop and his chaplains bringing up the rear. Each of the novices and the religious sisters here a lighted candle, and, headed by the cross-bearer, they filed slowly down the centre aisle, while the camera sang the hymn "Veni Creator." Arrived at the foot of the altar the notices remained on their knees, and the religious sisters filed slowly left and right to their places along the walls, the cong gallon occupy in the central pews In this position the contrast between the spotless white robes of the novices and the sombre veils of the nuns gave the scene and intense dramatic interest, which was heightened by the blaze of candles on the altar and the papers which the slaters continued to held throughout the service. Next came the solemn blessing of the black veils, which the now lies were soon to adopt for the rest of their lives, and the consecration of the ring which each man wears on her left Ininti as a symbol other spiritual union with our Saviour. The Rev. J. Quinn, of Carlton, preached the sermon, in which he made apathetic reference to the surface which was that do to be made complete. At the call of God these Indies had resigned themselves to run up father and mother and brothers and frauds, to blind) abandon their own will at the bidding of others, and to follow the service of Christ in a strange land. Doubtless the struggle was hard, for in j on to the pleasures of the world were painted in bright and attractive colours But there were two states by which a knowledge of what the we world really was was gained on the state of experience, the other The state ofgraoe-and both these alike proved the truth of the preacher's words, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity)." Nor must it be thought that in the seclusion of a convent the) ft.' find relief from the doubts and temptations which they had been obliged to struggle against, The struggle would he a long and protruded one, but, the fight ever fought, they would join that glorious bird whose privilege it was to go with the Saviour wherever he went. Tiny revue island and buried to the world, crucified us our Lord had been crucified, but their reward would be great. After the sermon the novices were con- ducted! by the mother assistant and the superioress to the altar when the Arch bishop, was using his mitre, and holding his crozier in his left him), interrogated them as follows Celebrant. - My child, what do you fit in and !
