THE COAL MINE AT MOE. SOME short time ago a policeman or t! joey " Discovered the ghost of a ghost up at Moe, And a keener detective than he we refer to Has struck on the ghost of a coal mine up there, too. When we heard of this strike then we said to our poet " Go up to the ground and test all that's below it, Or near it, or round it, or, well, anywhere, sir, And write an account of the ooal mine up there, sir." He wrote:—" My dear sir, through this district I've rambled, I've waded through swamps, and o'er ranges I've scrambled, I've battled with snakes, I've been chased by the dingo, But at length I have hit on the coal mine, by jingo! " In fact, sir, I've really been into the tunnel— It's somewhat the size of a steam vessel's funnel— And when I'd got in there I saw a low fellow, AB black as a crow, or as Mr. Othello. " Said he—' There's my head, and I'm willing to bet it, That we'll drop upon payable coal—when we get it; And that's the opinion of Reginald Murray— A long-headed chap that don't speak in a hurry.' "' But where is the seam ?' I exclaimed to ' Othello;' ' The Beam," he replied, in an echoing bellow; 'The seam, why my eye, and may nothing e'er blind it, Ha'int I just been a-saying we're trying to find it, "' But have you no coal, here V said I to my mate ; ' No coal ?' he replied, ' aye, the full of a grate ; And, there, as a proof that there's coal in this pit, I make you a present of that little bit. " 'I'd let you have more, but just now, I declare, It is really as much as we're able to spare ; But, mate, when the payable seam shall be found, You can have a full ton if you're knocking around.' " So I left my coal miner, and came from his lair; And, now, my dear PUNCH, I am free to declare- There are lots of black diamonds there, and I say They will make some one's fortune—whenever they pay." THE Gas Company is going to reduce the price of gas, This is the first time we ever heard it sold gas.
