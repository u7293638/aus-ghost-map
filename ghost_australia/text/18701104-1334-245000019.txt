ORIGINAL POETRY. MUSIC. " The silver key of the fcrentam of tears. Where the spirit drinks when the brain is wild, Softest grave of a thousand fears, Where their mother, Care, like » weaiy child. Is laid asleep on flowers."—Shelley* Spirit of music! how fair thon art I How strong thy hold on the human heart I Wherever a love for thy voice is found The rush of thy wings is a welcome sound. Thou floatest through memory's dins-lit halls', And the sound of thy melody wierdly falls On the heart that is grieving for some sweet As the ghosts of the vanished years awake. Thou meltest away from the o'erspent brain The phantom-shapes of despair and pain; Thou singest of joy, and the bounding heart In all thy rapture can share a part; The cheek will glow, and the eye will beam , It thought of some dear accomplished dream; u ind richly fair are thy ripling tones i is molten silver o'er costly stones. ^Thou breathest of war, and a sad, sad tale Is -told in the voice of thy funeral wail; T1 \y dirges echo with mourning wild Tb vb passionate sobs of sorrow's child ; Th e music sighs as 'twould bear a part In . the untold throes of the smitten heart. WHien thou thrillest the hearts that are rich in love, Thy voice is as soft as the cooing dove ; The subtle language of each sweet tone Has1 efaamt asd a meaning all its own ; And i aany a story unfolded lies To be gloated over by kindred eyes. In t lie friendly circle or hom®-girt throng" Let m. r spirit revel in floods of song, That ^ item hope> and love, and sweet memories c orae„ And zny - heart:,. In its triumphs, is almost dutafy, They m ay float my thoughts to my friend, and be -" Thought laden- waves from my friend to me! October, CLQTILDEL
