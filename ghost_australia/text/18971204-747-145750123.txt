The remnant of the Narrandera Carriers' Union held; a pre: limina'ry meeting last week with a view ; |of making, an' attempt: ! to ..»', re-organize their organization. Mr. Adams w,ajs'- in the chair.1 5, There, was, biit a small attend ance. ' Those present decided, to hold a general meeting in thred or four weeks, and in the meantime advertise therfact and get as many' to attend1 as possible^ I sincerely, hope such will be'thVcase. Men all round are beginning to suffer and. the need of ^Unionism once more stares into their face. '' ? ?* ' ' *'?' ' * ? * The harvest is in full, swing here. Crops are, mostly failures as far as wheat is ',, concerned,1' , and most' farmers are cutting th&r; , stuff .for , hay; '' E the present dry season contirities ohaf£ will rise to high, prices and pay 'cultivators as welly if not better than grain: A great number of men are in employment on the harvest fields between Narrandera and the Murray. Considering the scarcity of men wages are Very low. If men would only, realize' their ?: strength'! Farmers are continually .coming into/; the towns ' in search oi men— anil that is a good sign-^-yet harvesters make no ' at tempt to get a better arid 'fairer Vwage for their labor. Five shillings a day, viz., from 4.30 a.m. tillr 7.30 p.m. in a field under a scorching, sun can hardly be called enough. A while ago some one justly suggested to you that organizers should visit .harvest fields as well as woolsheds. ;I agree with him, and hope that the A. W.U. will be strong enough next year to be able to employ organizers after shearing. They could organize politically' as well, and would, I'm positivo, do splendid work. .','?;-? , It is riimored in Narrandera that Mr. J6hn Norton of Truth fame will prob.ably be a candidate for The .Murrumbidgee electorate ''next electi&ii..; |« Looks as if Lyne or Narrandera constituents or sbme .one' got tired of senile, silent Fitzp'atrick, the present Protectionist member, and this should be a hint for Arthur iRae to come forward. t . i ' ''?'''?',-.?.?* ? * .' .*' Grass is drying up fast and tanks; are getting empty.
