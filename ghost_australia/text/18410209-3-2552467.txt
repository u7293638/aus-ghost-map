POETRY. THE TROUBADOUR'S SERENADE. The stars are glittering forth to-night-- The Moon is shedding her silver light From cloudless skies above. The gentle breeze is murmuring by, Soft as the minstrel's half-breathed sigh, For her he dares to love. Bright dew drops sparkle on the grass, The fairy lake is smooth as glass, Sweet lady, list to me! With silken sail and ready oar A boat awaits thee near the shore, Moored 'neath yon willow tree. Let music's tones thy slumber break, Awake! From dreams angelic wake, Oh! Lady, bright and fair! Thy lover calls; at this sweet hour Linger no more in lonely bow'r But taste the balmy air. We will not climb the mountain's brow To gaze on the roaring torrent now That dashes down its side: We will not seek the forest's gloom, Nor pass the spot where from its tomb Some restless ghost might glide. We'll hasten to yon flowery dell Where first thy dark eyes cast their spell On the wandering troubadour. There if thy smile--thy glance repay The minstrel's all untutored lay, He is no longer poor.
