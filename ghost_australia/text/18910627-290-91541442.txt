NO ILLUSION. ' Let no one suppose that Christian men . know nothing of the philosophy of .illusions, \- nothing of the mysteries and enchantments which are worked by invisible powers in the ' secret laboratories of life; that they have not -discovered how easy . it is for the mind to -' impress its own forms on the objects of per ception and then to give them its own color ; .how easy- for the imagination and for strong emotion — apart from volition and against the strenuous effort of volition — to give '. such a body to subjective experiences that for sue tame they nave all the solidity ot objective realities. They, too, have had their dreams, \- and the dreams were so vivid that when they woke the world of dreams seemed the real ' world, an6L. the real world a, world of dreams. They ^have-seen ghosts — ghosts projected into \- the common air by some morbid and abnormal ' action of interior powers which have no name ; . ghosts gracious and kindly, ghosts cruel and terrible. They have learnt to scrutinise and to test with the coolest and most judical impartiality the higher experiences of the souL And their perception of the Divine glory in \- the historic Christ stands the closest scrutiny and the severest tests. They know that in the -: hours in which they are surest, that they are living in the Divine order the glory of . Christ is clearest and most unclouded and that : 'when they have the calmest and yet the ? strongest consciousness of the nearness of the : eternal the glory of Christ' is -most -Divine. They know that in some wonderful way the -. historic Christ . clears and strengthens that great faculty— whatever it may be named — by -which they are immediately conscious of God. They know that, instead of their, conception of God being contracted^dimmed, impoverished by finding . God in Him, it is indefinitely . expanded and ennobled and filled with a purer and intenser light. — Rev. Dr. W. Dale, in \- V The Living Christ and the Four Gospels.'
