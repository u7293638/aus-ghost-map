Slli^iSi^^iooo COMPDimDiNG Bt STEALTH: Mr. Haynes, M.L.A., writes: 'I propose to leave the.inqniry as to who paid the Premier's Â£1000 Inhere the; Government have stopped it; and the Ministers have themselves only to blame if the public put unpleasant constructions on the whole business'. The Colonial Treasurer is about the densest man in the Assembly, and is without a shred of idea as to the duties of a Minister as the servant of a people. Other*, wisp, anarfc altno-Afchfir from the exnodifinftv of being perfectly open in a transaction of this kind, he wouid have seen 'that the most)' minute detail of business in respect of receipt and outflow of money at the Treasury is public pro perty, and that the inquiry I made should have met with a prompt and frank answer. The Treasurer, however, does not appear to have col leagues much abler than 'himself. No greater blunder could have been committed by Ministers than to mask this business as they have done. The payment now looks like conscience money, or the'' acjs of comppunders. No more miserable backdown by a braggart, if we consider the whole business, was ever made than when Sir George Dibbs struck the item out, for his bluster in the early part of the session was immense. It was the ghost of the Hoyie and Miller jobs which startled the Premier and his colleagues to avert certain defeat over their own little business. The whole business shows the Ministry up in a thoroughly bad light.' In the first place they outrage the constitution; in the second, while blatantly claiming they did no wrong, they allow a compounding of the amount at the Treasury; and in the third, they settle the thing in secret. Taken, in a .politicalsense, by stealth, they allow a restoration of the sum by stealth. 1 have done my duty in forcing the Government before the public in their questionable work, and there I leave them.'
