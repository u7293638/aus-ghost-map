THE FORSAKEN F?iRMHIIOUSE. Against the wooded hills it stndls. Ghost of a dead home. staring through Its broken lights on wasted lands Where old time harvests grew. Unplowed, unsown, by scythe unshorn, The poor forsaken farmo- lfelds lie, Once rich and rife with oldecn corn, And pale green breadths of rye. Of healthful herb and flower bereft, The garden plot no housewife keeps ;. Through weeda and tangle only left, The snake,.itstcnant, creeps. A,lilaq spray, once blossom-clad, 'Sways bare before the empty rooma; Beside the roofless porch a sad,: Pathqtic red rosq blooms. His track, in mquld of dust and drouth, On floor and hearth the squirrel leave~q And in the lireless chimney's mouth His web the spider weaves. The leaning barn about.to fall Resounds no more on husking eves; No cattle low in yard or stall, No thresherbeats his sheaves. So sad, so drear I It seems almost Some haunting spirit makes its sign; That down yon shadowy lane some ghost Might drive his spectral kine. -J. G. W1Ttur1n
