JtHet'wouldinoti have personally cared to exchange the plain^'Mr.' for the titular prefix to his patronymic but i' the; power* behind the throne' was too potent, and 'her Ladyship' carried the day; ;On'Mr. 'Dalley, however, has-been conferred the highest honour ever accorded to ? any colonial statesman excepting ? Sir John M'Dohaldj! the Canadian Premier. The ex-Attorney-General ? of the sister colony, has been made a Privy Councillor. Mr. Bosisto/one of the Executive Commis sioners at the London-Colonial Exhibition^ has been offered' the ; barren '' distinction of a Companionship of the Order -of St.s. Michael and! George, and has deolined it. He opines i hei too, should ''''have' been knighted.' ;: If character alone had any thing to do with the conferring of the 'dis tinctions; th'e member for Richmond Bhould certainly ?? i ha ve achieved the honour, - it' honour indeed it be when it is shared by such as the late renegade Chief Secretary of Victoria. In the good old time -of chivalry, a hundred champions would have been ready, to leap into the arena, and hack off the -spun of the Agent-General. South' Australia; is offended, and' justly so, at the unceremonious way in which Vic: toria and -IJew South Wales have dealt with the waters' of the Murray, without reference to the' colony through which it runs'for nearly a thousand miles in 'its course 'to the sea. A somewhat angry cor respondence, in which the soreness felt by South Australia is apparent, has been car ried on, and unless Sir Patrick Jennings and Mr. Gillies manage to make the amende honorable, there '? may be trouble ahead of the irrigation scheme independent of the Parliamentary opposition. When the mat ter is calmly considered, it does appear rather cool to settle on a plan for diverting the water of a river without reference to the griparian rights of the people on, the lower part of the stream. Evidently 'the *' twopence extra for manners' was not ?expended by the parents of the New South Wales and Victorian Premiers. South Australia hasbeydnd doubt 'a grievance.' Victoria is apparently just discovering to her cost that 'protection all round'. is not tho policy that suits her requirements. New South ? Wales is practically demon: strating that she believes that the sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. The same, it is true, is not yet very highly spiced. A duty of five percent, ad valorem has been imposed on Victorian made 'slop , goods,' and loud is the outcry of the ?clothing manufacturers in consequence; j They will, they allege, not only be ruined 1 themselves, butthe bulk of their employes I -will be thrown but of work. ' Perhaps it is I just as well thatthe dwellers in Mr. Berry's I *' paradise' 'fbr: 'the working man' should ? realise tlie1 ' full blessings ' the; jprotection ? system, brings'in its wake,'atidbe more t ready in ' the good time' coining1,'' when ij we haveia'Gbyerniiient 'courag^oiis enough | io tackle ;a reciprocity' treaty?1 16 favour a ?{ policy which Mr. Murray Smith has truly I declared to be 'tho only one compatible si .with 'common, sense'.?'
