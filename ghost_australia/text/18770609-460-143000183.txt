POETRY. IPHITION. BY FBAHCIS H. DOTLB. {FROM TEE OOBNHILL MAGAZINE.) How, facing HI nnconqnewble foe, 8llent and Ann in the loct battle's roar, IpbltlOD toll, three thousand years ago. We learn-let him have praise lor evermore, What 1 though his Slayer, drunk with Eastern blood, Be borne aloft on wider wings of fame, Two words, by Homer dropped in careless mood, Give light enough to read a hero'a name. The shout that shattered armies into flight. The godlike form in heaven's .own armour clad, The golden plnmea divine that lived with light At every step, for him no terrors had. Bteht on he rnthed, though to a certain doom, Bephsntian mall and matchless strength defied; And, earning with him proudly to the tomb The whiteness of his honour, so he died. There Homer leaves him, like a tall ship wrecked Leaves him to wolves and vultures where he lay; But that whloh makes the man, no bard's neglect To beast, or biid, or Time can yield a prey. Thus ever, through eternity, we dream Tfiat he by looking back is oomforted. That the long sunless hours of Hades gleam, With radiance from the past around him shed. That inward Still he murmurs as the wind Herman through roofless halls: "At least I know None find a spot on my yonng life behind, Kor dread I here what all must undergo. Death cometb-ay ! but after death to say What I with truth can say is given to few. Achilles, thine the tame-yet well I may Believe myself the better of tbe two. Armed by no god, but as my fellow-men, I faltered not in fight, though others fled, Till my aafe conqueror struck me down, and then Against his lanoe the blood leapt warm and red. And even here, on this nnhoping coast, With spirit unexhausted I can bow To what fate sends: Achilles, as a ghost, Whines, weak without his god-given armour now. Though all life lent my soul no longer aid ; The memoiy that I never quailed, for me Keeps vital warmth within. I ecora the shade That, to touch earth again, a slave would be."
