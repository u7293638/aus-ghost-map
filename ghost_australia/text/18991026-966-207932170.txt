MAJUBA AND IMPATL Wl.rn liie v.. M Eoar faced the Lion On rod Impati's height, li" bliowrd liis lusks to terrorize The Lion in the light. His ^ were long, liis tusks were strong;— Tlir; Mauser (c.-Us—and 1 Ley WVro fciu to Uim to rend and limb The l.ion in the fray. R;"sht valiantly tlie wild Boar fought— Hchind his native trail— Tht^ rocks and ranges of the land; But when our bugle call Sent tlic Fusiliers and Leeeistcrehires With teeth that never fail— T):e biiy'nets keen—the Boar was seen To show not tusks, but tail. For when our soldiere stormed tlic ridge That marks Impati's crown, Tlie Hoar in traitor terror turned The fatal hillside down. But his horse had sped from the valley's bed. And lie turned him once again; In liis liradlong flight he turned to fight, Like- a wild beast in bis pain. Theu echoed from the sounding liill The battle-bugle's blast. Charge! Cavalry of England, chaigc! And furious and fast, Like a fla?li of flame to the valley came The British mounted men. And they painted rrd their swerds, and fed Majuba's mem'iy then. Tlie Boar who'd used a bully's boast— He'd make ilie Lion Sec Like an eland frighted in liis flight. And drive him to the sea— Formed a rabble ho^t, despite tlie boast Of the wish that tuned the will; Ho tvas driven then by the breed of men Trapped on Majuba hil!. The swords flashed in, and the swords flashed out, Nor guard nor parry rang; It was cut-and-thrust till they bit the dust, While the hot Wood sectbcd and sang. Our men were glad with a jmade mad By a long-remembered vow; They could see the bones whose grey tombstones Jut from Majuba's brow. The call of kindred filled their ears, And red ghosts lined the height, While l-Miey heard the dead men's chccrs N-j:vir.g them on to figlit Mid no living men—so thev tell our pen— Could call up such lust to kill As Majuba's dead clad in bloodstained red On dread Impati Hill.
