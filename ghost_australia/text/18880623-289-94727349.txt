LAKE SUNDAY (Y.P.), Juke 19. This place is situated three miles from Yorke town, in the centre of a wheat- growing com munity. — The weather just now is very cold. YeBterday the rain began to fall steadily, but before night it came down in torrents. — Some of the farmers are rather late with their tilling operations, but they are pushing on as rapidly as possible. The early sown wheat is all up, and is looking nice and fresh. — Work is being restarted at the Pink Lake Saltworks. Mr. Moseley, the proprietor, has just effected some necessary repairs and has improved the works* This will be a good thing for oome of Yorke town's surplus labor, a good many men being required in and about the works. — The inhabi tants of Yorketown have been much excited these few days past about a ghost. It ap pears, from what I can learn, that a certain house in the township is haunted at a- certain time every year by a visitant from the other world in the shape of a lady in black, who carries a book in her hand. Several people assert that they have eeen this apparition seated in a chair, apparently very much ab sorbed in the contents of the ghostly volume. This is not the only ghost that we have, as several more have been unecrthed.
