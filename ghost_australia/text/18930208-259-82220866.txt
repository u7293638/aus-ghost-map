POLITICAL ITEMS. Mi'. James Campbell and Mr. N. Dempiey will be candidates for the Aubigny electorate. . . . . Peter White, one time representative of the Stanley, will contest tbat electorate at the next election. Â« . . . The various new electoral rolls show a general decrease in the ncmber ot electors as compared with the totals of the previous rolli. . * . . At a political meeting held in Roma on Tues day evening last it was decided that Mr. T. Driffield should stand in the Labor interest for the Maranoa, and cot Mr, H. King. . . . . In his account of the late Melbourne Cup, Max O'Rell forgot to describe the Australian Cabinet Minister who was seen sitting io a gutter with his arms around the neck of a b'aclcfellow for whom be had been "shout ing." The Sydney Bulletin says this. An exchange says:- . . . The old Liberal party is doubtless dead and cannot be resurrected. Politics are ever crystallizing themselves into new shapes. The main struggle of the fature will doubtless be between those statesmen who aim to maintain order, the right to possess property, and freedom of contract in labor, ana those who desire to see the State taking possession of the production and distribution of wealth. The battlefield of the future will be on this ground in Queens land. It will be a question between individual ism and socialism. Minor matters will be sunk in the bitter contest for victory now imminent. The coalition Government, and the present confused condition ot political parties oertiinly suggest a new arrangement, and the wisest men will be thoso who do not seek to raise the ghosts of the dead and conjure np old party names, but act in the " living present," and devote themselves to that side whioh they believe will most farther natural prosperity based on righteousness, and tend most surely to establish God's kingdom on earth.
