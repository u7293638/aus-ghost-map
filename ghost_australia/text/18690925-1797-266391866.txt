THE HAUNTED HUSBAND. I am with second sight endued, And oft at phantoms shiver ; I quake and shake, my rest they break. And do so chill my liver ! E’en as in life, my fierce old wife On me now glaring gazes ; A ghost confest ! and in my breast Most dire alarm oft raises. See ! there she stands with outstretched hands (Am I asleep or waking ?) She makes a grasp—poor me to clasp ! I’m like an aspen shaking ! Ah ! must I go ? No, not for Joe, I’ll yet escape her clutches— I’m but a cripple, still here goes, Now do your duty, crutches !
