To the Editor of the Chronicle. Sir.— Though we are thoroughly satisfied we have forever Silenced, by our letter of last week, that horrid ghost, we yet deem it due to ourselves and this place to write you once again, to inform you of our unfeigned dislike to yourself and family. The harm you have done to this kingdom, we call it, is in- calculable. After dark, nothing else now is thought or talked of but those horrid ghosts. We can't persuade one another to ????? without candles and we have to listen to the most awful stories, even in our beds. The night before last, one was heard outside, and last night, there is no doubt, an enormous ghost was twice seen. He was standing just at the back-door- nobody durst say a word, though we are all sure it was just like 'Old Envy.' We looked on with amazement , lhe said nothing, did nothing— nor did we, and this morning, we all woke with headaches. There were no ghosts here, sir, till you brought them, and having annihilated, we are sure, that scribbling one, we now give public notice that we have the greatest contempt for them, and think it would be more manly it they had come at daylight instead of dark In conclusion we may safely say you shall never have ay of the valuable friendship of THE INHABITANTS OF BAN BAN.
