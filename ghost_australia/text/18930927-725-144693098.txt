Estenega's power was felt alueby innocent girls and chaste matrons. Tbere w- re few tcaiidbl* in those days ; tbe women of the aristocracy were virtuous by inttiuot and rigid1 s »cial laws ; bur, bow it would be bard to tell, Estenega bad acquired the reputation of being a dangerous m^n. j Perhnps t had followed him oa«k from the | city of M.xico, /t»h*re# at one time, he had j spent three years a* diKputttdo, and whence j lie returned with a brilliant and etanliuy record of gallantry.

Then old Dju Jor.t Brjonee' beauUfatyoung wife was found dead in hy bed one morning, and tbe old woman who dressed tbe boaj swore ttat thrre were marks of bard skinny fingers on he** throat. Eittnega had made no secret of Lit* admiration of her.

What a pity that your honkba ato a* war !* ; He had been looking away from me. As I I tinishtd Speaking he turned his face slowly 1 toward me, first the profile, -hloh looked as .if out rapidly with a sharp knife out of :i?Qry,' then tbe full laoe, with its eyes set so :deeply nbder the soragay brows, its mouth : grimly : houiornup. He looked somewhat 'ardonio and d^oid^dly selfish. Well I knew i wbat that rxpt^iston meant. He had th» kindObt heart I bad ever knowa, but it . never inierfored with ainist eelf*indolffent .nature. I had; often begged him to have ooDtideratlori for some girl who I koew I obarmed bim for+he moment only ; but one j ecotet of 'hisirocoeM with women was his un feigned if brief enthusiasm. ' 4 Lst her alone I' Iexolaimed. 4 Ton can not marry her. She would go into a con vent before ehe would saorifiee the traditions of her hones. And if yon were not at war, and eheiDarriel you, yen would only make ber miserably, bappy.' He zierely smiled and continued to look me Btraigbt in the eyes. CHAPTER Y. I went op-stairs and found Chr-nita read | an*' Lnndcr's * imaginary Conversations.' I (When Oaonita was nltrl teen. — »-he was no* I iwenty-t^o,— Don Alfredo B tbinson, one i of the Atnericin residents, had at her ' t«ther's request tent to Boston for a library of several hundred books, a birthday gift - for the ambitious daughter of the Itnrbi y Hon cadas. The selection waa an admirable one, and a rauoho wool4 nnt have pieaned her as well. . She read Eiglish and Frenoh with ca»e, altloufh »ho spoke both languages brckeoly.) As 1 entered she laid down tbe book and clr.sp *d ber hands behind her bead. Sbe looked trai qail, but less amiable than .was her wont. .' Thou hast been far away from ihe cabal leroB and tbe donas of Monterey,' I said. 4 Not tven among Spanish ghosts.* I I think tboacareet at heart for nothing bnt thy books.' 4 A- d a few people, and my religion.' 4 But they con-e , second, although thon wilt not acknowledge it even to thyself. Suppose thou hadst to saorifise thy religion or thy booke, never to read another P .Whioh wouldfct thou ohoose f . ( Q- jd of my s ml ! what a question ! No 8pameh woman was ever a truer Oathollo ; but to read ia my happiness, the only hap pineAs I want on earth.' 4 Art thou sure th&t; training the intellect means happiness P' * Sure. Does it not £ive us the power to abetrftct ourt- eiveu from life when we are tired of it t ' 4 True, bu: th- re is ancther result thou hast not thought of. The more the intelleot is developed, tbe more acuta and aggressive ia the netypue &y;^tem j the more tenacious is the memory, tbe more has one to live with,. and the higher the ideals Wnen the time comes for thfe'to love thou wilt suffer cviih doublH the intenoity and depth of tbe wemau whose nerves Are dull or stunted.' 4 To suffer you must love, and I never shall - love- Who is there to love ? Booke always suffice me, and I suppose tbere are enough in the world to make the time pass as long as I live.' I did not oontinue the argudeut, knowing the j)lacid superiority of iuexpr rience. . * But Ihpn hast not yet told me whioh thou wouldst .giye op.' 4 The books, of course I hope I know my duty. I would sacrifice all things to my religion. Bit tbe people do not interfere , now as they did in thelatt generation.' I was vary religious ia those days, and my heart bi at with approval. 4 1 have always s«id that the Churoh may let women read what 'they ohoose. The good principles they arc born wi h they will adhtre to.1 4 Wh are by nature conservatives, that is all. And we have the- need of religion. We must have something to laan on, and teen are poor prope, as far as I have ob served. Sometimes after having read a long while in an absorbing book, particularly one tbat teemed to put something with a living band into my brain and make it feel larger, I find that 1 am miles away from friendship ; I have forgotten its existence. I always run back.' 1 J)iot ! I should think *o. Tee, it is well we. do need our religion, lien do not ; for that reasca they drop it as thi*y would the thick blanket of -.n Indian the moment the wings on fheir minds grow fast. I do not Aaie ask pit-go Eitenetfa what he believes, lt-st Le.tell me be believes nothing and! atjould have to hear it. How dost thoa like thy frit-nd, Ohonita ?' * Art ihou at-kiog me bow I like the enemy of uiy house f 1 hate bim.' 4 If he goes to Sinra Barbara with Aivarado thin summer wilt thou ek Mm to be tby juesb P' 4 Of oourse The enmity has always been veiled with much courtesy; and I would i have him fice that we know how to enter lain.! . i . I watchei hor covertly ; I cnuld detect no ' ii^n ot interest. Presently she took up the: volome.of Lindor and read aloud to mo, the - (?lat-iy .English . (sounding oddly with her Spanitth aooent.
