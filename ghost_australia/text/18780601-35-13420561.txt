of)t 23 îMe]î Jiftomiits develop SATURDAY, JUNE ;, 1878. WE have already given the substance of the evidence on which the Cable Conference had to base its decision and on that evidence the main conclusion to which it came, Y'izi, to duplicate the existing route, seems justifiable. It is quite true that by so doing with the offer made, YVO confer a practical monopoly on the existing company for a term of twenty years ; but the Governments do not in any way bind themselves not to encourage other lines during that period, or not to make other lines for themselves. They merely bind themselves to pay the telegraph company a certain sum per annum. This sum is not a large one under present circumstances, being only enough to ensure a moderate dividend on the capital invested. We have also to bear in mind that the other cable, laid down by the company, has hitherto cost us nothing, and has not yielded very handsome returns. The company has no complaint upon that ground, because it entered into the speculation on business principles, for the purpose of getting its foot in, and keeping its rivals out, and as would now appear has been successful in that respect and as it practically purchased a monopoly with its eyes open, it must not complain of the cost of the transaction. At the same time there is no doubt that if the company had not been in a hurry, and had at that time sought a joint guarantee, from the colonies, it would probably have obtained one, so that really YVO get two cables for a subsidy which would have been required for one. For, in consideration of the subsidy now offered, the company undertakes to put down a new and better cable, and to keep the existing cable in order and furthermore, to complete the cable duplication by making another line between Singapore and Penang, and to maintain all these lines as well as those between Penang and Madras, and Madras and Rangoon, in full working order. This is undertaking a large responsibility, and the amount of consideration is not by any means excessive. Of course it would be a very nice thing if companies would furnish us with telegraph and steam communication for nothing, and want no subsidies at all, and the time may come when this will be done. But at present a trade of this kind that will not pay must be helped if it is desirable on national grounds that the communication should exist and Yve cannot expect people to serve us for nothing, and to put their money cheerfully into enterprises that would yield them a doubtful or a scanty return. The Government could not make its own telegraphs cheaper than the company proposed to do the work for it, while every- one will admit that it is far better that our Governments should abstain from undertaking enterprises of this kind, and leave them to private capitalists. That part of the stipulation with the company which provides that the new and existing lines shall all be kept in good working order will have to be sternly adhered to. "We know that the present line from Singapore to Batavia is frequently out of repair, and we cannot feel anyjtasuranee_tha¿for the, next twenty years it will remain a - good cable. But the object of the present subsidy I is to keep up not merely the present line, but two lines of communication, and it will never be satisfactory to us to be told that though one line is out of order, the other is always at work. The object of the subsidy is to have a double line as a guarantee against interrup- tion in the communication, and if we do not got that we do not got what we pay for. The final arrangement with the company must make this point so clear as to be free from all possibility of dispute hero of ter. The tvvTo principal points on which the decision of the Continence appears to us defective, is first, that there is no provision for a reduction in the tariff during the course of the contract, if such reduction should become reasonable. It has been proved that at present there is no room for such reduction, except so far as it may be directly compensated by a subsidy. The business has not hitherto proved expensive, and it is the opinion of the company that more reduction would not give any expansion that would give rise to a corresponding income. But who can tell what will happen during the course of the next twenty years The use of the telegraph may during that time immensely increase, and we may attain to a state of things in which a reduction of the charges would lead not only to the entire net income, but even to a larger one. As the contract stands, it is left entirely to the discretion of the company to determine at any time whether such a reduction is advisable, and twenty years is a long time for the colonies to leave themselves helpless in such a matter. The second point on which the decision of the Conference was defective, was in respect to the duplication of the land lines. In the first instance this seems to have been omitted altogether; but at the fag end of the discussion, and on the very last day, a resolution was submitted arranging that in case a land duplication should become desirable, South Australia should engage to co-operate with the other colonies in constructing and maintaining a line from Port Darwin to the telegraph system of Queensland. We do not think that South Australia can fairly be called upon to contribute to such a line. It has already gone to a very large outlay, and could not fairly be asked to compete with itself. But a duplicate line must go through South Australian territory to reach Port Darwin, and therefore the assistance and co-operation of that Government is essential, and it would not do for the other colonies to give to South Australia what it wants in the duplication of the cable, and not to protect themselves as to what they want, viz., the duplication of the land line. This duplication would not cost very much, and shared between Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales would be no burden to either. In our judgment it ought to have formed part of the scheme, and not have been left as a merely possible project. We do not say that the Queensland line would be a better line of communication, or even as good as that through South Australia ; but it would be a duplicate one, and the chances are that when the one was down the other would be up. It is hardly worth while for us to go to the expense of £32, 400 a year to duplicate our communication between England and Port Darwin, and then save the small amount necessary to duplicate the communication between Port Darwin and all the chief office in? Australia. If the duplication was worth doing at all, it was worth doing throughout. Oxn of the last places anybody would have expected to be chosen for the first Ministerial progress of the recess was the southern port of Wollongong. The bitterest battle of last session was fought respecting the Illawarra- rail way, against which Ministers arrayed their forces as well as they were able. How the matter was finally disposed of is but too well known, and will be one of the most discreditable incidents in our-Yvhole Parliamentary history, unless charity shall cover it with the mantle of silence. Notwithstanding this unpropitious and very recent antecedent, Mr, FARNELL selected Wollongong for his first deliverance during the interregnum, and he did not even shrink from dealing with the vexed question. Trusting, perhaps, that the " fellow-feeling " of his Masonic brothers around him would make them " wondrous kind," or relying upon his powers of persuasion he told a large deputation of residents that " the question of constructing a railroad to Illawarra must stand over for the present." But there was another announcement of Mr. FARNELL's still more significant. " Inasmuch as the country has for some time past been living beyond its income, and largely on its capital, the time has come when the question of increased taxation must be taken into consideration, no matter what Government may be in power." If that be the opinion of the present Government, the TnEisuitKR's task in preparing his next budget will not be so easy as his last. Of the necessity acknowledged in this speech at Wollongong few of our public men have now any doubt, For" those who would not yield to argument Yvheu the rage for land was growing every day are more than convinced by the logic of facts now that the tide is beginning to turn. But if the need for fresh taxation be no matter of surprise to anybody accustomed to look an inch further than the point of his nose, neither is it a matter for serious apprehension. The people of New South Wales are among the lightest taxed in the world, although man for man and family by family they are among the wealthiest, without reckoning the fee-simple of their great public estate. To shoW. our position side by side with our neighbours on the opposite banks of the Murray and the Darling, we have prepared the following table of the revenues of the three colonies for the year ending on the 31st March of the present year. The population is taken from the published estimates at the close of last December, and the different items of revenue have been classified as far possible upon a uniform basis. Sources.

It is also worth noting that we derived 228 per cent, of our whole revenue from taxation, 63- per cent, from land, and 24 per cent, from general services for which the public pay, and which can easily be made self supporting any day we please, for Victoria the proportions and 17 per cent, from taxes, 25 per cent, from land, and 400 per cent. from services. In South Australia the taxes yield 30 per cent, of the whole, land 325 per cent., and services 312 per cent, The amount derived from land by this colony is so large as to distort the comparison with the other colonies on this basis, and we must have recourse to that of proportionate population. The taxation per head in Victoria is only Is. land. larger than ours, and the difference; worked upon the Victorian rate, would have increased our receipts by £00,000 during the last year, which is only half what the Stamp Act would have yielded if still in force. But it must not be forgotten that last year was an unfavourable one for Victoria, especially the last quarter, during which the receipts from Customs fall off, as compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year by £44,722. The falling-off for the whole year was £104,778, a sum equal to sixteen per cent, of the whole taxation of that colony, Under the head of inland revenue there was a windfall from duties on the estates of deceased persons to the extent of £70,705, more than double the previous year, but that is a very uncertain, if perfectly legitimate, source of income. New South Wales has no equivalent tax on property, and she also makes a publicans' licenses general taxation, whereas in Victoria they are a source of revenue to municipal bodies. More than nine-tenths of the Government taxes come from the Customs south of the Murray, and about the same proportion on our side of the boundary, notwithstanding the difference between the policy of protection and that of free trade. In regard to South Australia, the compari- son shows more variety, The taxation there is higher pro rata by 6s. 6d. per head, or 15 per cent, than here. A similar rate would enrich our exchequer by £220,000 per annum. Customs yield £500,010 against £l,143,8:1o in New South Wales, which is more than the whole difference in the rates of taxation. The other sources of revenue cannot be compared in this article, but the result of the whole may be briefly stated. If our Parliament had nothing to vote away, and our Government nothing to spend or lend beyond the South Australian proportionate revenue, they would have had to govern the country somehow out of an income less by nearly a million and a-half sterling than they had for the year in question. And if fortune had been so unpropitious, or perhaps we might say propitious, as to reduce their financial resources to the Victorian rate, they would have had to confine their liberality to their constituents at the expense of the country within the limits of a revenue of three and a half millions, instead of five and a half, unless they meant to precipitate public bankruptcy. As to the immense resources of New South Wales and the sound- ness of its financial and commercial condition, The most jealous of critics could find no room for cavil. The only room for cavil is, as to the wisdom and providence of our financiers in turning such splendid resources to the best account in promoting the growth of the colony.

The passenger train which left Orange at 7.46 a.m. proceeded safely on its journey till Springwood was reached, when, on enter- ing the station, it ran into a goods train on the main line which was being shunted into the siding. As the speed of both trains was very slow, little damage was done to the rolling stock beyond receiving a shaking. One lady, who happened to be looking out of the window at the time of the collision, received a scratch on the face by coming into contact with the frame. The passenger train afterwards came on to Sydney, which was reached only twelve minutes later than the advertised time of arrival. DEATH OF THE REV. PETER flora, BJD.-A\'e regret to announce the death of this reverend gentleman at Ewingwood, Ashfield, on Monday evening last. Mr. Hope was the secretary to the Colonial and Continental Committees of the free Church of Scotland, and had been appointed a deputy to visit the Presbyterian Churches of Australia and New Zealand, to whom ministers had been sent by the Free Church. Mr. Hope's health had not been good for some time, and it was expected that the long voyage to and travel through these colonies might prove beneficial. He arrived at Lyttelton, New Zealand, in January but, but not improved by the voyage. He met with the ministers of the Presbyterian Church in Canterbury and Otago, and made an effort to address them. He manifested great eagerness to gain information that might be useful to the colonial committee in providing suitable clergymen to send to Australasia, His strength, however, was not equal to the task, and ! he was ordered away at once to a warmer climate. ' He reached Sydney in the end of March, and, though I he rallied a little, yet gradually sank. His faculties were active and his faith strong to the very last. Mr. Hope was a Graduate of Arts and of Divinity of the University of Edinburgh, and a licentiate of the Church of Scotland. He joined the Free Church in 1813, and was settled in 18H as minister in AVninphray, Dumfriesshire, in his native county, where for twenty-six years he laboured with zeal and efficiency.' He had taken much interest in the public business of the Church, especially in aiding to provide ministers for the colonies and the continental watering places, and he was unanimously appointed secretary to the Colonial and Continental Committees by the General Assembly in 1879. Mr. Hope proved very useful in that sphere of labour and the Presbyterian Churches of all the British colonies, and especially those in Australasia, are indebted to him for his efforts to provide suitable clergymen for the necessities of the people. Like the Church to which he belonged, he took a very warm interest in the union of Presbyterians into one Church on the historic standards in the colonies, and he favoured the movement initiated in Scotland for the reunion of the Churches. Mr. Hope was accompanied by his wife, who is sister to the widow of the late Principal Thomson, of St. Andrew's College. He was buried on Wednesday, in Mr. Thomson's grave, at the Necroplis. The funeral was attended by most of the Presbyterian ministers of this city and suburbs, and by several of the elders of the Church. The services at the house of Mr. Goodlet, where Mr. Hope died, were conducted by the Rev. Messrs. Auld and Jarvie, of Ashfield, and at the grave. after the reading of Scripture by Mr. Auld, the Rev. Dr. Steel gave an address, and the Rev. Principal Kinross offered prayer. Mr. Hope was (23 years of age. His family are in Scotland, where his eldest son is a student for the ministry. Titi: A. S. Co.'s NEW PREMISES. Rumours have been rife in town during the past few days to the effect that the Australasian Steam Navigation Company had not fully determined on removing to Campbell's Wharf. We are authorised to state that such rumours are without foundation. The extensive alterations making at Campbell's Wharf are rapidly I approaching completion, and will be fully occupied by the company within the next few weeks the large boats employed in the China trade having already discharged their cargoes at the new jetties. The advantage which will accrue to the shipping public by the I removal of the A. S. N. Company to the waters of the Cove can be seen at a glance by the most inexperienced 1 men of business paying a visit to the new property. Passengers, too, arriving in our beautiful harbour will be none the less pleased it being landed in the centre of the city, instead of at Darling Harbour, as hitherto. The allotments of land adjoining the new wharfs, .jir.d having frontage to George-street, are to be sold at auction on Tuesday next. THE MONA GALEV.UY will be open to visitors after 1 o'clock; to-day, being the first Saturday in the month. LOYAL VICTORIA. LODGE, G.U.O.O.F., NEWTOWN. The regular fortnightly meeting of the above lodge, on Wednesday, '26th iur.Uuit, was rendered more than usually interesting by the presentation of a testimonial to Brother B. Sutton, who for a period of over eighteen years has held office in the lodge. The gift took the form of a handsome English lever watch, suitably inscribed and although testimonials have of late been rather freely bestowed, yet in this instance the recognition of such long services is considered to be equally honourable to the lodge and its former officer. TEKMBIX COACH ACCIDENT IN NEW ZEALAND. For the subjoined report of the coach accident at the Horse Range, New Zealand, in which Mr. Charles Nichols, of Dalgety, Nichols, and Co., was killed, we are indebted to the Oamaru correspondent of the Otago Times. W.riting on the night of the 21st of May, he states that, "As the coach was coming down the Hampden side of the Horse Range, the driver and owner, Mr. W. Goddard, lost all control over the horses ; it is thought through the king- bolt coming out. The horses bolted down with the fore part of the coach, leaving the body of the vehicle behind, which swayed and tumbled down the precipice, which at this point is some 200 feet high, but its progress was arrested after going some distance by a wire fence. The coach turned over several times, and the passengers were thrown out' in all directions, only a few escaping injury. Mr. Nichols, of Dalgety, Nichols, and Co. was picked up insensible, and expired shortly afterwards from supposed internal injuries, blood flowing freely from his mouth. Master E. Maitland, son of Mr. J. V. Maitland, Commisioner of Waste Lands, who was proceeding to school at Christchurch, was frightfully injured, and is not expected to live. He is suffering from' concussion of the brain, and the flesh on one of his sides, from the ribs to the hip is torn in a frightful manner. Amongst the others who were more or less injured were M'Xieol, hotelkeeper, Dunedin; Mr. Hunter, of Wellington ; Mr. Bishop, of the .SKII newspaper, Christchurch ; Mr. Cullies Hill, of Melbourne ; Mr. J. Cameron, of Timaru ; Master Aralpy, of Dunedin ; Mr. Francis Fulton, of Dunedin and Mr. William Goddard, the driver. Several others received slight injuries, only one or two of the passengers escaping unhurt. Information of the accident was first received at Palmerston by telegram sent from Hampden by Mr. Bell, jun., who was driving northwards in a buggy. Mr. Back, on receiving information, at once despatched a special train, conveying Dr. Brown and other assistance. The train stopped opposite Kartigi,' and the sufferers were brought up to the hotel at that place by means of every available vehicle. Dr. Brown at once set to work to ascertain the extent of the injuries received by the unfortunate victims, and to apply such remedies and temporary means of relief as were within WB power. This having been done they were placed on the train and brought into Oamaru shortly before half-past 9 o'clock. The greater number of them were removed in vehicles to the hospital, where they were attended by a number of medical men. THE AMUSEMENTS Last night Mrs William Creswick appeared for the last time before a Sydney audience for the present, let us hope. We cannot let an actor of his position pass away from amongst us with the bare notice of his last appearance. Mr. Creswick deserves far more, for he has done good here in many ways and whatever may be the differences of opinion as to his impersonation of the varied parts he has assumed during his long stay in Sydney, no one will deny that he has raised the standard of the drama here - and this was sorely needed. We take leave of him with regret, though with the hope that we may be again able to welcome him back to Sydney, where, as he knows, people are generous and true tothosethey like, and he is amongst them. As for the performances at the various theatres last night, they were but repeti- tions-" Othello " attire Victoria, " East Lynne " at the Theatre Royal, an "Lisa Eccles " at the Queen's Theatre, with Mr. L D'Arcy Read's Ghost entertainment at the Guild Hall, and the ever pleasing Spencer's Polytechnic. The comedietta A Winning Hazard" at the Theatre Royal, was smartly played as an afterpiece to " East Lynne." FISHING EXCLUSION. On Thursday last the steamer Minx proceeded on her usual fishing excursion, leaving Circular Quay at 7.30 a.m., and AVoolIoo merino Bay at 8 a.m., proceeding from thence outside the heads. Thanks to fishing Captain Barker for the good selection of fishing ground he made, enabling the excursionists to make a catch of 650 Schnappers with other fish fit for table purposes, not including sharks, leather-jackets, or useless fish. ' 'the steamer Minx will leave next Thursday on her usual excursion, "
