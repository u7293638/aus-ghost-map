SO-CALLED "SCHISM. (concluded.) Afl to No. 2, in Rev. F.

He will be conyinced, historically too, that there was but one legitimate Pope' 'atthe"fci&eb; tdferredto,;' jThe!Bey. ,F. Hastings completes his No. 2 with the weighty sentence : " To build on Christ's promise to' His Church, is to build on adamant." Now the promise of Christ to His Church is exceedingly clear to Catho lics A" Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I wdl build my-church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Regarding his No. 3 we would like Rev. F. Hastings to! produce within any measur ablqpropprtions, credentials as s^sfsctozy as^hose bf the ptoph&ts; and of ^JbhiAthe Baptist, which have come down to us. Wewillbaye towait. tr As to No! A, how in the world can Rev. F. Hastings assert :r, "Aptness for the work 6f teaching, preaching and presiding . over a church, with the possession of personal piety, is to be taken as authorisa tion." Aptness without piety will do, if the authorisation comes from the right quarter. Judas was duly authorised, yet he was an impious man. As far as the assertion of the Rev. F. Hastings goes perhaps piety without aptness might also do. With regard to the deacons,* how comes it, if they were only for serving at table, tb®;appstleSf pfjyed, and! imposed hands on them." Sdray so -solemn an initiation jwereisnot necessary for mere eeryehi »al dtable 1 v Then* v P$he < Jour daughters of Philip the Evangelist preached." (Aqts xxi. 9.) The Catho lic version has "prophesied,"not preached. Well, this was one of those extraordinary gifts, or manifestations, known in theology s& graiiaft gratis datqe, accorded the new believers, on receiving the Holy Ghost, in testimony of the - truth of the Christian religion, and it is of these gifts that St, Paul speaks, , (1 Cor. cb. xii.) These gifts however'did hot convey theauthorita- ; ■tive'power of preaching, which power could. bg.Jiad, ,as it is still.had in the Churph of Christ, "without these extra -orduiary gifts. rJx). J$o.

But how dpqs this i pnoye that such arethe.authoritatiye exponents ofGhrist'sddctrine? orthatthey -have the power to confer authorityi?
