' that is soon to be held in Paris is creating an immense stir in all circlea, and the jurfges-,tvill find their dutj' difficult enough. There have been beauty shows before, but none have been inaugurated like this one. The creator of the competition is the wellknown Faris paper "Gil Bias," and according to tbe conditions, neither social position, dress, nor culture is to receive the least consideration. Beauty, and beauty alone, will count. The first three prizes are certainly worth winning, quite apart frjjm the honour and glory that "accompany Ihem. The winner of the first prize is to Teccive a sum of 5,000f. (about £200) and a trousseau worth S,000f. more; the hippy woman who takes second place will live l,000f. and a trousseau of the same value, while the third will simply have l,000f. worth of pretty clothes. A number of gold and si'ver medals and diplomas will be irwarded as well. Besides "this, when the -Jury have decided upon the winners, the "Oil Blat" will give a great fete, inviting *Ji the social and art&tic; celebrities, in whose presence the result o! the comoeti- ••'on will be announced, and the three lov'-^y nneens wil! be crowded with pomp . «nd ceremony. Xot only is the greatest drv?ssmakrr in the world a man, but the greatest, fashion designer belongs to the masculine sex. jlr. George Pilo-tellc, wbo is answerable for the leading dress designs of Europe, has just been interviewed,. and tbe account given of bim in tbe "Ladies' Realm"' contains much that will interest, lie says—and it will strike every woman who has studied the history of raiment as being perfectly tf 1 ®—i-ha: at no time in the world's liistorv have there been suc-li beautiful clothes as are made and worn nowadays. He a]«» says that it is a mistake to think that women make the fasbioo, for as far back as the middle ages men had the designing and making of our garments. Tliu?, in 1402. a guild was formed nf men tailors for making women n and childrenclothes. Mr. Pilotelle desorves the thanks of our sex for his suggestion of a new and lucrative opening for women of an artistic turn of mind. He W"s that a good income awaits such as dress designers, provided they obtain a food art education and cultivate their imagination. As a rule, the girls who study at the great, art schools consider dress designing as being quite beneath ths-ir notice, and yet it -is.' essential that the dress de sgnicr should understand anatomy, and also be able to draw from life. "What women find to do all dav" is a puzzle "to the generality of men. and it is undoubtedly due to this want of appreciation of their services on the part of men that women have become restless, and have become anxious to go out into tbe world to find positions of more apparent importance. "Men," rays a writer in tbe "Ladies' Home Journal," "have made women feel, too keenly, that it,is what tbe man does, that it is his profesaon—wfhidi mores-the world, and that the work which a -woman does in her home is. while necessary, yet hardly to be compared with a man's achievements." Women's natural work has r'ot received the recognition it merited, so they have gone out of the home to attemnt to do work thai is unnatural to. them. This does not mean that men have belittled women's work in the borne, yet it is a fact that tbe majority of them have faiied so far of a correct and just anpreciation c/ that work and of all that it entails. The "hundred and one KWe ; thinfcs" •which, small as they are, swallow the hours of each day, are absolutely of the most vital importance if the domestic, machinery is to run smoothly, and those are just thc/w matters thiat are continually b^ing overloked by the man who only sees the grand, result,. He t»o+<"s onlv the surface, for he is too busy with bis own wtirt to have time to do more, and if the baby's face is clean, his wife' cheerful and neat, arid the dinner well woked, be thinks it a31 that is necessary witbout in the least, understanding lunr arrest is the cost of time, energy, and thoncht to ensure the same brightness and epotleasnesR in tbe unseen corners the home, as well as in the seen. For the good housekeeper's creed is that of the artist:—"The gods see' everywhere." and it is not a mark of narrowness of out3r>ok if her soul is vexed by. the memory-Af an unswept. imgarniAed corner in her bicme. It is rather a mark of that Ittge-mtndedriess that enables her to look ahead, and forecast tbe dansrer cf harbouring dirt-hannted bacilli. She piay seem fc> be. like Martha, troubled with many things, bnt she is, above all things, the bringer of "sweetness and light" into her home, and as such she merit® the reverent appreciation of h^r busba&d.;
