TUESDAY, FEBRUARY %, 1882. MB. GRIFFITH'S triumphant progress through the Northern districts culmin ated in Charters Towers where he re ceived a reception hjanorable alike to its object and to those who offered it. Unlike the reception he received in Towoaville and other places, the demon stration on Charters-Towera was strictly party and- political in Its signiflcance and as such it must hare weight throughout the colony. Thfe electorate possesses more voters than any electorate an. the colony, and the strength of the liberal cause was unm&takealily; demonstrated on the occasion. Mr. GRIFFITH himself de clared that the banquet given, to. hiiu and at which 20Q persons were present was the largest he had ever received and felt very well satisfied with his re ception. There waB another remarkable difference between his reception here and in other places. The people in lowntT ville, in Port Douglas, Hei bertoa and TJiornbo rough had all of th*?*u " axes to grind "* and produced th«m eagerly. Here Mr. (Jrifbith was not pestered wii'hdepi^tii^^grieTd.rees. 'The people . took higher ground and were anxious to hear only of the- great poli tical questions now agitating the colony and the attitude o£ the leader of the -Opposition towards them. Mr. GfilF fith left nothing dark or obscure about his stand on those sulijeets. On the doolie question he was specially expiU. eit and satisfied expectation. From the published report of his speech at Cook town we had some mfegiringfi* bat after iieaiing Mr. GsiFFiTHwe felt assured that he had taken tbe right stand and he will have both. North and South vi iih him and that be will, so supported, b& able to carry out his wishes, takeep this a European colony and build R dp in'o a * white nation." He was equally expli cit on the Transcontinental railway s-henje, Payment of Members, and Triennial Parliaments. He has dene good service by seeking to remove any lingering bad feeling between - x*orth and South and by opposing Separation esjie cially at the present crisis when the real safi-ty of the North deducts on aclose^ union witli the working classes of the South. Th« knquet was a compJet® succt-ss, and even our jKjlitica.1 ©pawner.to are constrained to admit this. The miners of the field pro'xed that they were capable of oi gatiising .this demonstration, and carrying it out to a successful ter mination without a bitch. Mr. STBBLEZ in responding to. the Mining Interest,got an opportunity of defending himself for bis neglect of his Parliamentary dutiesand made the l«st defence,. we. suppose, he was cajiable of making. Even"in the opinion of his best friends hisdefenee van atuiserable failure, it was'childish in its weakness. W hile the permission of the leader of theOpixmiioii for hia (tbseuce at a particular junction, or the advice of Mr. Mzuss on the point might be a jus tiCcation for a short al seuce, bintly lie cannot expect any musopa'de man will accept this as an excuse' for a total abandonment of Iris duties. Hp boasted that he went beyond the pieties he to the electors, and then brought -forth the ridiculus tntte of & Permissive SiU for which he voted because he knew il would not be |>as6ed! His declaration £hat he had private business to attend to which he would not "neglect for any ^Parliament, was of a piece. If he found that his private business "was so pressing Bud en glossing why did he not resign ? Jle w&b; advised, he said, by a member pf the.
