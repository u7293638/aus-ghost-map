Sydney High School Concert. A musical and dramatic- entertainment was given last evening at the New Masonic Mall, Castlereagh-street, by the members of the Sydney High School Literary and- Debating Society in the presence of a large audience. The programme was opened by a few remark's appropriate to the occasion by the president of the society (Mr. T. B. Trebeck, M.A.), after which an overture ar ranged by Mr. B. Bokrsmana was, ^played by that gentlemen, together with Mr. A. Buisfc. Miss Callaway sang ' Because of me' very sweetly, for which she was encored, when she complied with ' Oh, how beautiful,' the rendition being particularly good. -. 'A recitation, 'How Bill Adams won the Battle of Waterloo/' was given by Mr. G. Bohrsmann, who, in response to an urgent recall, also recited- 'Mary's Ghost.' A piano solo, 'Tarentelle,' was given by Mr. F. S. W. Ziotkowski ^ih a tstyle that elicited much -admiration- - and evoked a deal of applause, after which , he volunteered a 'Giavotte in P.'- Mr. S. L. Drummond sang 'Plymouth Sound' very well, and 'Las- sie' was given by Miss Gallawajr with her accus tomed grace and style. - The entertainment con cluded with a sketch; 'entitled' ' Done on Both' Sides/' in which some half . dozen members of the society took part. ? Although froin an artistic point of view the concert was all that could be desired, yet ? the-, enjoyment -of .the audience was greatly marred b^ the' - presence of a 'number of juvenHes , wlio /throughout the performance Jkept up a running ire of inter ruptions and hideous whistling that proved very discomforting to the listeners. In future it would be well if some authority were placed over the boys who are allowed to ^attend these enter tainments, in order that ihe comfort and pleasure of the adult portion of the audience may be more assured. : ? \,\ ?',?;.;.; \\\' '?. ./','??/ ^ v.--. .
