Mr. and Mrs. Case. The EsTERTAiNStENTa given by Mr. and Mrs. Case, in the large Hall of the Mechanics' Institute, are the great sensa tion of the duy. Tho Hall is not only crowded each evcuiug, but mauy cannot obtain admission. The feature on Thurs day night and last night was the Protean fln.hlnnt: Tina ia an inmimMrulifinaililA piece of mechanism, on the Professor Pepper mode of producing the Ghost. Tte illusions are uot only extraordinary, 9)Ut wholly unaccountailc upon any na tural supposition. The arrangements by 'which the delusions are effected are thoroughly scientific. The Cabinet is, mowever, a more incidental portion of the Wtertainment, and entirely (subordinate to Mrs. Case's impersonations of the most direr so characters. Her greatest triumph is in her perfect impersonations of the dress, style, manner, vocalisation and easo of Mr. Simula Rcevos. Next to Mrs. Case's brilliancy in vocalisation comes Mr. Case's extraordinary performances on the concertina ; his imitation of the Highland bagpipes has never been equalled hero, except by Mr. Ueiuc, the Mind musician, on tho grand organ of the institute. Airs Case has ;i very wide rok of characters, amongst which muy bemputiouod, a- first-rate, her 'Romeo Quffiin,' ' Lord Dundreary,' ' Madame Choamette,' ' Mrs Botherby,' and ' Sary Gamp.' These arc but a low of her great characters, and it is really difficult to say which is tho best, Mrs, Major Buster, or *te Greengrocer wlio waits at table, or tho Pago who smashes everything, and auathemtises Mrs. Major Bust-her, are all so good that tho public must take their choice. Mr. and Mrs. Case will favour their couutry admirers by appearing at the Longford Assembly Rooms on Wed nesday next ; at Westbury ou Thursday, and at Dcloraiuo ou Friday.
