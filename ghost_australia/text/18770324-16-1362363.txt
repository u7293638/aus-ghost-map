Mr. Batley was not the man to let the grass grow under his feet, and having once made up his mind to attain a certain result he bent all his energy toward (Is its attainment. When he left the theatre after the company had received their salaries, it win, with the proud consciousness of having done all that was inquired of him. "I owe the poor devils a lot of money," he bottle qutsed, " but they as well as myself have to suffer. If this affair turns out right, I'll pay them up," and having disposed of the subject it interested him no more " This is a case of heads I win, tails you love," he thought " This woman may be a big thing if so, I win ; if she's a frost, I have a solatium." So cocking his hat jauntily on one side, and swinging his constant companion, a heavy stick, he strolled leisurely down the street. " Whither away, most noble Kuustus '" said a cheery voice at his elbow. Any thing strange, fresh, or startling '" The speaker was a short, good-looking fellow, dressed in a suit of tweed. There was nothing remarkable about him in fact he was a most commonplace looking fellow, and few to look at him would have imagined the power wielded by the individual above described; in short, he was the musical and dramatic critic for that powerful organ The Peacock, and as Bitch was the most feared and courted man, by those whose Miccebn depended on his feet, in the city. " By Jove I" said Butley, catching hold of the speaker's arm, " the very man I wanted to see. You're the first in the market, and as such are entitled to the first bid. Come in and whisky-up, and I'll tell you all about it;" and entering the bar of an hotel they were soon engaged in discussing their particular! weaknesses. After they had mutually imbibed, an adjournment took place to a private room. Two more "liquors" were ordered, and Mr. Batley and Mr. Cheques were soon engaged in earnest conversation, the latter occasionally tating notes. I do not wish to insinuate that the above conversation had any reference to a paragraph that appeared in The Puifodc of two days later; but that it did appear I can vouch for.
