Jokes about Queensland Heat. 'Anglo-Australian,' in the European Mail of July 4 says : — Cooktown, in North Queesnland, is well known as one of the hottest places on the Australian continent, and there is a ? regulation story bearing on its extreme sultriness which is told to every traveller who visits those parts There was a very bad man who once lived in Cook town — an advertisement canvasser — who, when he was not advertisement canvassing, was basking in the sun, and he was such an abnormally wicked man withal that there was never any doubt in the Cooktown people's minds as to where he would go when he died. Die he did eventually, as the story goes, and the town felt relieved. A few nights after his death, however, a local storekeeper was going the rounds of his store to make things secure for the night, when he came across the fellow's ghost, busily engaged in packing up a bundle of blankets ! He had come back for some warm covering. This characteristic (for Queensland) yarn iB now capped by the story of a party of North Queensland ers who came over recently on a visit to England. They felt the cold badly as soon as they landed, and one of the party soon developed pneumonia, and died off quickly. He left orders that he was to be cremated, so his friends had him taken to Woking and sent to the oven in due form. The next day there was to be another cremation, and when the attendants opened the door of the crematory they were surprised to hear a voice from within shouting : 'Will you fellows shut that door? I was just beginning to feel nice and warm for the first time since I came to this beaBtly country !'
