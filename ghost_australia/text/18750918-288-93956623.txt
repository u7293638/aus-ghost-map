This cccarred a little o^er three miles from i'Hr. -Hensley's head, station. All efforts to drag the ?? c ach cut of the -mud : prov»d.. : futile. Gi:e of the front wheels of the vehicle was smashed to pieces ; and to crown . fee difficulties of the situation the driver and ... passengers had enough to do to prevent some ; of the horses ?: beings drowned in JiietBwamp. One of them lost its footing, and it was with the greatest difficulty tkatit was; raised again. : ^hen *ome hoars hai open lost ia. .trying- to ?-- get the coach out, the horses were loased vf com it; and after a three miles1; journey, rwell ? 1 worthy of -remembrance, ^the driver and some : of the passengers reached Hensley^s and saught . . assistance.- Mr. HenBley kindly -lent a buggy, and a return .was essaj«dto ihe deserted coaoh. Having advanced- ihi within 2vO yards of: it a stand was made, and the driver,- assisted fey the passengers, commenced the -task of nnleadiEg the coach, and carrying the; mails and- luggage through mud and water' up to their waistf, to the buggy. There was a large quantity sf luggage besides the mails, and. about an hoar was spent in this task. In trying, to start with the buggy oa tbe re urn to HeDsIey'a a new difficulty arose. The swingletrees broke, . the horses floundered, tbe harness gave way, and two ef the horses got clear away, and had not been found when the coach arrived at Nar racoorte ! . The buggy was alee damaged oon siderably otherwise ; but it was patched up as well as it could be, considering the means of 'repair at hand, and drawn by one horse to Hensley's, the passengers walking the distance through an unbrokes. swamp. After some -refreshment, two new horses were obtained, and a start was made for Narracoorte, which was reached at 7 o'clock on Thursday evening. 'The 'trip was one of the worst experienced on the road, and it is fortunate no serious is jury was done to life or limb. As' it was, the driver sustained several severe kicks from -the horses '.whilst in the mud.

He came to the colony in the ship Catherine Stewart Forbes in March, 1838, and soon after- wards settled on Section 812 at Athelstone, on the River ToTrens. He remained there as a successful fruit and wine grower until he re tired in the eariy part of 1866. Since that year, Mr. Stead has been residing at Norwood. He enjoyed perfect health and was very active up to about five years ago, when by a fall he broke one of his legs. Mr. Stead was a member of the: Unitarian Church, Wakefield street, from its foundation. ; .pately^a young.' couple, accompanied byja; female lEnendy bailed npon one of the Mouufr'G^niLbier clergymen, and finif ormed1 him. tMt! they 'were' arixipua ,to; ^-immediately uaited in Iheindls'Oiu'blel bonds of malrricnpny.
