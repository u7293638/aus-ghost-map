TO THE EDITOR. Sir— I Intended replying to Part 1st by Ghost of October 15, bnt after reading part 2nd of October 22, I altered my mind and concluded that the Ghost was only a, child or that be had very little sense ; also that be is no Judge of sermons. But I promised if you would give me space in your Open Colnmn to iosert the following which was banded, me by an Old Bushman who assured me .that this would give the Ghost an idea of the General reception of his nart fimt. ICorr.]. In the Bunyip of October 15. appears a footprint of the cloven-foot. Th« sanseless as he is aanwless would be GhoBt who makes an uncalled for attack on a Christian pro fecsion'4f ? faUh. gives proof that be himself kaa n» claim whatever to be called Christian, who can only expect the pity of Mr. Green and members innumerable who are prepared to Ate ' battle in the cause of Christ in fair and open fight.
