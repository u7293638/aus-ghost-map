? THE SHENANDOAH. The following effusion has been freely circuited in Melbourne during the last day or two, and is supposed to be from the pen of the ex- American Consul. THE SHENANDOAH. (By a Southern Sympathiser) The Melbourne Tanker look wond'rous blue, And swear it's a "regular" Britisher's do, To furnish the Coals and fit up the Screw, For this damnable Shenandoah! Dismay has seized on the Stars and Stripes, Each Norther n Skipper has got the gripes, And inwardly damns his "Tarnal Tripes" When he looks at the Shenandoah! To sail for a month, they'll be none so bold -- In fact they feel they are "all fire!" sold, And quake at the sight of the " Grey and Gold" Of the Lads of the Shenandoah! If Commodore Wilke was only to band, They swear they'd hang the "[...]" band! And tht not a stick nor a spar should stand On the deck of the Shenandoah! But as there's no Federal Cruiser here -- Nor like'y to be -- why it's very clear Unpleasant news they'll a long time hear Of the crusie of the Shenandoah! It may be only a yarn, at most But they say when off Madeira's coast On board came Stonewall Jackson's Ghost, And shipped in the Shenandoah! Their Southern motto is "do or die" To fight at need or in prudence fly, And if you can overtake 'em —— why. You may tackle the Shenandoah.
