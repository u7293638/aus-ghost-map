toico' Column. liachclor's Hall. BY H. 0. DODOE. Hurrah I hurrah for Bachelor's Hall j The Queen's away and I'm monarch of all ; I don't have to hang up my coat or my hat, And when I get lonely I talk to the cat. I como when I like, and I go when I choose. The finest cigars help me scatter tho bines ; No bundles i enrry, and nothing I buy ; There's no ono to care nhout— only " big I." I revel in wildest confusion around ; There isn't a thing in its place to bo found ; My books and newspapers, tlioy litter the room That basn't for weeks . seen tbo sight of a broom. There's clothing or something on every chair ; My bed's never made, but it's little I care ; 1 sleep liko a top, for there's no one to call— 1 take solid comfort In Bachelor's Ilnll. I've used nil tho dishes nnd now it's my fate To cat, when I'm home, oa tho hack of a plate ; I'm learning to cook, but, rilas, I confess I cboasc to go hungry than swallow tho mess. Bat, Bachelor's Hall with its comfort and quiet, Is almost too spooky for regular (Hot ; No children live la it to welcome their dad, No supper is waitiDg, no wife— 0, so glad. No I Nothing but ghosts of tbo loved ones away Inhabit this tomb where alone I mast stay, Compelled to break silcnco by having a chat With my wofnl companion, tho strange act ing cat. 0, gladly I'll yield (my crown sceptre and all The Kingly delights of a Baeholor's Hall To tho Queen of tha Homo when sbo comes with her train To wisely and lovingly over mo reign.
