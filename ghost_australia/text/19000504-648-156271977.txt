A Litligow Ghost, The good people of smoke be grimed Lithgow are much exercised over the existence of a ghost, which is alleged to take walks abroad about 2 a.m. Several people have been nearly frightened to death, and we shall be glad to hear of the insane practical jocker being shot. He's no good.
