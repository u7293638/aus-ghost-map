A EEM1EKABLE WEED. Sib, — More than one correspondent has, in the columns of the Daily News, brought to notice the periodical outbreak of a dis ease among horses in the Kimberley dis trict Judging from the symptoms which have been described it strikes me that ihe malady may be earned by the' loco' weed, which (says the Melbourne Leader) has found its way to Australia from America. The loco weed is to vegetation what the rattlesnake is to animal lite, ihe name com-'S from the Spanish, and grows in small bunches or . handfuls, and scatters itself in asjarse and meagre way about the c nintry. It is a sorb of vegetab'e nomad, and travels about not a little. Locali ties where it this season fl wishes in abun dance may not see any ol! itf next year, nor indeed for a number of years to come. The prime property of the Joco is to produce insanity both in men and animals who partake of it. Animals — mules, horses, sheep, and cattle — avoid it naturally, and under ordinary circumstances never touch it. But in the winter, when un inch or two of snow has covered the green grasse?, these gre^n branches of Ijco, standing clear above the snow, are tempting baits ro aui mals. Even th-m it is not common for them to eat it. Still some do, and it at once creates an appetite in the victim similrr in its intense torce to the alcohol habit in m inkind. Once started on the downward path of loco a mule will abandon all other kiuds of feed and look for it. In a short time its effects become perfectly apparent-. You will spe a locoed mule standing out in the shadowles3 plains with not a*living ; moving thing in his vicinity. His head is drooping and his eyes half-closed. On the instant he will kick and thrust out his heels ia the most warlike way. Under the influence of loco he sees himself surrounded by multitudes of threatening ghosts, and is repelling them. The mind of the animal is com pletely gone. He cannot be driven or worked because of this utter lack of reason. CUEA.
