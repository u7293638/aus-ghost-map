SPORTING. It is stated on good authority that Joe Thompson, who was present at the Trotting Club meeting on Saturday, laid a representa tive of the stable ±,'5,000 to ±200 about Sardius for the Melbourne Cup. A commission to back Coronet for the Cup to the tune of ten thousand was put in the market last Saturday, but we believe the money was not forthcoming at the price demanded. Joe Thompson was greatly pleased with the appearance of his colt whom lie purchased of Mr. Jordan, and who was present on the Old Course on Saturday. J oe also greatly admired the condition of the youngsters who stripped in the Sapling Stakes, and says that Victoria hasn't" the ghost of a show " of winning the Maribyrnong Plate. He considers our two year-olds are three or four months in advance of the Victorians owing to the difference in climate, and that the Plate must go to an Adelaide or Sydney youngster. The Melbourne bookmakers who are over here discount the statement that Madeline has been backed for the Maribyrnong Plate, as they say that no books are open yet on this event. The metallicians prefer to wait till nearer the day before tliey go into figures over the Plate. The trophies and stakes won at the S.A. Coursing Club's Mount Pleasant meeting will be presented to winners at the Prince Alfred Hotel at S p.m. 011 Wednesday next.
