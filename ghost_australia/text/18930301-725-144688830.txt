DESERTED NEVADA TOWNS. It is queer travelling io some perls of Eastern Nevada, where paralysis has etiuik the mining oamps find nearly obliterated onoe flourishing towns Not infrequontly one finds but half a don-n people In a town that onoo had thousands, aid very often, in a plaoe that onoe bad hundrodp, one finds but a single individual— a lonely link be tween the present and tho past, and getior .It. . aM U^^mm 111* _ ?Ml/ V U»«a; aioaiaiK, vvasw laugujo UtVU ; belated ghost whom sunehlne should havo sent back into limbo. Yet tho plaoe is in variably mapped and oharted as a town ; has a government mill servloo and its duly aooredited postmaster, and, to the oulsido world, exisls as palpably aa ever. 0! oourse the hermit is tbe postmaster, and very frequently he is some eortof an elective officer besides. Inthe Benae ihat he is 4 mooarch of all he surveys/ and that bis \- right there is none to dispute/ he is a sort of Alexander Selkirk, the Beoond ; for bis nearest neighbors are tho scattered raooh men, who live from fifteen to forty miles apart, and his immediate soolety is that of tne Indians who dig in his garden, when be happens to have one. Yet he invariably appears to bs more than satisfied with his lotrand, apparently, would not exohange positions with tbe Frrsldent. With bio. good health, good appetite, a full oupboBra and a weather-tight cabin dlsoount the glory of the world. Moreover, he never UeB awake at night to think about hie sins ; for the sound of the ohuroh-going bell is something that he hoard but few times io his life, and so long ago it 1b quite like a dream. The hereafter haB neither charms nor terrors for him.
