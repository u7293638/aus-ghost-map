A Ghostly Dwarf. 'Ghostly visitations' continue at Clan don House, near Guildford, one of Lord Onslow's mansions. There are upwards of fifty persons in Clandon Village who claim to have seen the 'ghosts.' One takes the form -of a black dwarf, another that of a lady, sometimes brilliantly, sometimes very sombrely, attired. All the servants at Clandon House say they have seen- -one or other of the apparitions. It is even said that the present occupant of the house had a spiritualist specially down from Lon don a few days ago, who had a talk with the lady 'ghost,' and received from her a sad story of having murdered her illegi timate child^before marriage. Her hus band heard of the crime, and employed the black dwarf to poison beivâ€” London paper.
