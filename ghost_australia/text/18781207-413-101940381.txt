BETHUNGRA. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) The principal topic of interest in our usually quiet village during the past week has been inquiries of "Have you seen the ghost?" and there are several who still persist in saying there is "something m it," that is, the illumination of the empty house and on Tuesday night two or three gentlemen were laving in wait with revolvers, determined to give any person a welcome that they found playing the ghost. Some have suggested that the lights are a reflection from the semaphore lamps, but no explanation is given of the weird sounds and the unearthly noises, what- ever they mean. It is rumoured that in consequence of the small, attendance at our local school, if matters do not improve, it will he closed after the holidays; This will be a matter of sincere regret, inasmuch as Mr. and Mrs. Daley have been most assiduous in their attention to the scholars; and several heads of families will lament the loss of the lady and gentleman beforementioned if the school is closed. I think that people living in the country should endeavour by some means to send their children to school, for it is a matter of notoriety that children in the bush are growing up exceedingly ignorant. A great deal of responsibility rests upon the shoulders of the parents, who are negligent of this matter. Feed for sheep and cattle continues in abundance, though losing that green appear- ance that it presented a short time ago. People lighting fires in the bush should be extremely careful not to leave fires burning , when they have done with them, for the slightest spark, if not speedily put out, may cause a conflagration which would ravage the country. We notice that the railway authorities are taking active measures to burn off all the grass within the railway enclosures. Bethungra, December 6.
