INSTRUCTIVE AMUS£EV3£NTS- Judgirg by the fair amount of publio sup port given to Juvenile Technological aud Scientific Exhibitions of late years in this colony, it is a matter for marvel that no enter prising company has been found to start an institution similar to tho l olytechnic of Lon don, in tho metropolis of Melbourno. With what amount of affectionate remembrance the grown-up children of to day look back to the entrancing hoars spoat in hearing aud seeing all the wonders of that much fre quented institute in Portland Place, where, as a holiday treat, thoy were regale! with a variety of amusements whioh then seemed slmobt endless, and which nothing bu« sheer exhaustion could reconcile them in leaving as the ten o'clock gong sounded th hour of closing 1 Tho delights of the vast dis solving views, embracing a whole opera such as Der Frioacbutz, with tbo aocorapauying vocal and instrumental music, and all the details of the weird incantation soene; the myetory of Popper's ghost seances; the fun of Biroh'i panoramic lectures ; tho entertaining teaching9 of t e working models; and the chomistry experiments ; the joys of the diving-bell; and tho terror- striking realism of the volcanic destruc tion of Naples, \ all formed a tout ensemble which made up ono of the happiest experiences of boy life daring holiday time, and was but faintly rivalled by the London and Paris by day and night, tho Swiss Chalet, and the other attractions of tho now dismantled Colosseum inthe Regent's Park, It is tru that many of these entertaining projects are from timo to time presented to the public of Mo. bourne, but they come before us only at intervals, and not iu a coUoctad form, bo that tbo charge for admission to one luch'class of exhibition appears to bo oxoossivo and from want of varioty tho entertainment it self is apt to pall upon tho youthful mind and interfere with the design of' imparting instruct ion, so that it shall b t received only In th guise of recreation. What is wanted is a per manont institute, where a whole evening can be profitably spout, for ons inconsiderable out lay, and where tho change of programme is bo varied and frequent that tbo child's oyo is kept constantly on .tho aiort, while information i imparted in that popular form which hasg already secured tho success of such undertaking as tbo Engineers Exlubition, now unfortunately brought to a cleeo. Ear the leisure hours of tbo adult population tho omusemonU of this city offer ample resources, bnt for the ovoning recreation of tho juveniles thero is but littli opportunity affordod, and as it may be inferred that the t&stss; of thejboya and girls of the present gene ration inoiino twice as mnoh townids theai combinations of icatrnotion and entertainment as onoe satisfied their older, it saom3 ooly-rov renable to predict that any enterprise having ior its object the projection of a Melbourne- Polytechnic, similar to that of Lo id iu, w mi l brcctuo a )x>pulur and a profitable undertaking, ami at tho same time add materially ti thrt diffusion of useful knowledge which it is the proteased derigu of our Stitu oJuoMion to un- jwirt to aud enoourago iu the growing up popul ation of Victoria.
