THE ATTACK UPON ADELAIDE. TO TBI KDTIOI. Sir— 1 witnessed, too attack on and tbe defence of the dty by the forces yesterday from either side at different points, and aU I can sar fa that tba men behaved sniendidlr: but I saw instances of companies being outflanked and bearily find into, yet having the cod cheek to continue in action. Where were the umpiriest Echo answers, where? And if not handy, why not! Is is poor satisfaction to men who out- manoeuvre another body to see tbosuppdstd defunct arise and go for them arrasn, standing up the while, perhaps, like so many targets, so invulnerable do they, in their ismsaca, think themtdves to be. Umpires sbould be distributed on either flank and in tbe centre, and bytbev reports to bead- quarters taeresaH of tectics under fire sboak? be d* ddeaV and not, as.aeemingiy fa done now» rule of thumb or anyhow. . . . ?* '?
