The .day appointed for the trial of',the prisoner was idose at hand, when ^ our .-qui-" village was troubled by "a new terror. One remarkably pleasant Septembermori . ingi^when the children were all oil their way j to schooli the eastern coaicih stopped, a ghoBt descended, and wtdked Idsurely with every semblance of life down the road toward tiie long deserted cottage on the beach. •' - As Bobby Mnller confided to meafterwara, "it was a iiornble, real, live ghost" <or{it tned to pat the shrinking boy-on his cuds, and nodded familiarly to 6oyereI .people whom it met on the yiay. • A number of p ersons were ready to swear that this ghost was endowed with htunan psssions^and that, they almost saw a flush of atiger rise to its cheeks when it found the whole -town avoiding it in nnqonceialed terror. , , _ .. 'But it : -was a persistent ghost, lor at l walked stea t" ' on until it reached ihe garden «ate, *iiioh it found nailed up ; and it developed a talkative propensity when it: discovered tba pigs running riot among the vegetables and flowers. In the voice of the dead Lucy Davis .it exclaimed in a peevish tone: : • . " That John Divis'll be the death ol me yet 1 Letting them pesky hogs root .bp thingssol" It is needless to prolong the story; the ghost was no otha than my old enemy, Luoy Davis, whom I had firmly believed to be sleeping quietly in her grave. : When Buck called apon her in search of particu- lars, she gave the following acoount in her own language: "I've often give John sasB. but he's never ive me ho ease until that last row we. had. f ben he did fire up and blaze out, leavin' me madder'n all fury. He's got a tongue with a deal o' meanness in it, now I tell ye. Well, he dug ontin his sloop, an' I made np my mind not to let'him come home and think he'd got the best of it, so I packed tip too and walked on foot that night to Weybor, whereby nobody knew me, and took the coach to hunt up a cousin o' mine that's married and settled in Vermont. Of course I heard nothing about this 'body business' thet they thought was me, and after my visiting streak got worn out, I started home again, but 'twas nothin' in the world bat the merest luok that brought me so soon; my cousin Maria, Bliewas a going tew do some quilting for the winter, an' Fd partly promised to stay a few weeks longer and help her,' but Lord knows I never meant no harm to John. That pesky -«body' mast have stole? my best skirts and table cloths an'that' whole set of silver clbiny that John brought' me from Bosting." That's the whole story. Davis was, of course, instantly released hidi stopped, and alter that Sherbrooke pever heard of any more disturbance be^ tweenthe captMn irnfl bis wife. _ Some little time afterward I was talking with the old man abont the a&eiir; and all of a sudden he thrust his hand into the c&- paoions:pocket of bis-seatnan's-irouBers and pulled forth something which hie handed to ' me. -".':.•• 1 j .a "Here's A! J mnll what Lucy ^rta^ fished nn " ha tOrday, OCtl) outfn 4 onr old well that's dried up." he said. I iekemined the trinket with eager interest. It was .-the same ring, the same fantastic design " and curious ^setting, tfao eamiB ghastly glimmer to the stone; that toy • rnuiU " yy. MwaaiOBttt, two months ago: T tamed iPover and over.

Lnpy gave it to Mr JobnEpn, and she would have let him .have this,'only I had it in my pocket." : Buck and T went to work upon the neW facts of the case, and I confided to him the whole story of thy client.' "We traced the ring to a New Yorkp&wn; ehop,- where it had been plcced for sale by a German lady, and irom .which plaec it had been soldi to woman—the : description of whom (compared almost identically with that of Lucy Davie. It .was one of those strange, mysterious resemblances with which .one meets rarely,: and was that which had so .impressed .me with en air of familiarity about my clieiit. I 1 wrote to the few names I had possession; of in the woman's papers. 'I Prom some I never heard at all ; others! knew nothing of a woman named '^Beiyl eomething," the title most. have been'fictitious.

Bat of noaree nothing was certain.
