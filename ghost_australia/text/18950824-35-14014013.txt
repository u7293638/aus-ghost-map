LIFE IN LONDON AND THEREABOUT. CirnoyiOTiEO BT HELMET W. _TJCT. HAPPY DAY FOR. MR. GIAMTONE.-HOW HE HEArrDTTrB GOVERNMENT HAD EETniED.-OH THE TANTALLON CASTLES HARBOUR OF REST AT HAWAII DEs. WESTMINSTER, July 19. Whilst political parties are in the throes of deadly conflict, whilst old Parliamentarians find the door of the House of Commons unexpectedly slammed in their face, whilst Liberalism is swept in the background, and coalition marches onward with conquering read Mr Gladstone is quietly sponding the summer days at Hawarden writing a little, reading a great deal, and possibly, as he w watches the rout of the Liberal holt, thinking much more It was a curious coin evidence that the hut newspaper that reached his band on his return from his expedition to the Baltic should have contained news of the resigna- tion of Lord Rosebery's Ministry When he started upon his brief voyage there was no visible ground for apprehension of catastrophe Ministers were threatened with revolt by the Welsh members and by increasing lukewarmness among the Irish But they were always being threatened, and hitherto the truth of the axiom about threatened men living long had been abundantly proved According to all appearance, when the Tantallon Castle left Gravesend the Ministry would struggle through the session, possibly face an autumn session, and dissolve in February next year That, as Sir Gladstone know, was the Ministerial programme, and there was no reason, bar such an accident as bap posed, why it should not be carried out Ten days later he came back to find that his former colleagues were no longer Ministers, and that Lord Salisbury had been " sent for " by the Queen One of the most remarkable achievements of Mr Gladstone is the completeness with which, having formally and finally retired from political [ life, he is able to put away political things It is, of course, no new thing When in 1875 he wrote his historic letter to Lord Granville, announcing his resignation of the leadership of the Liberal party, he for a while was able absolutely to shut off the steam of political life under which, at the time of the dissolution, every fibre of his body had throbbed Cironmstaucei proved that his retirement was premature SVhilb it lasted it was, as far as politics were concerned, absolute In this second and last great renuncia- tion of active politics Mr Gladstone has apparently found it equally easy to cut himself adrift from the long irresistibly attractive field of politics It was curious on the morning when the Tan tallow Castle anchored off Gravesend and a large bundle of morning papers were brought to Sir Donald Currie at the breakfast table how coyly Mr Gladstone regarded them There were some politicians on board, members of both Houses of Parliament, and others, who were in such haste to learn the news that they almost snatched papers from the bundle At Kiel on Saturday morning news had come of the defeat of the Government in the House of Commons on the cordite question Would they dissolve, resign, or go on, giving a chance division on a side issue of These were the questions that had been discussed at the table, on deck, and in the smoking-room Gothenburg, busy about its own affairs, know nothing of the ministerial crisis in England Between Kiel and Gravesend there was no news or means of obtaining it But here were the London papers hot from the press You had only to open them and learn all Mr Gladstone, offered by Sir Donald first pull from the precious bundle, looked as if he were a little bored with the whole subject After a moment's hesitation he took up from the heap a copy of the Daily hues, put it under his arm, and walked off to his state cabin on deck "Ino news would keep at least till he had settled down in his armchair by the table on which were his Danish Dictionary, and the book in the new language which, with its assistance, he was already able to road, Hay imperturbability was not shared in the saloon Before he had got halfway up the companion way Sir Algernon West came after him with the portentous news that the Government had resigned " Eli > "said Mr Gladstone makes use of that Lancashire excel mation which constantly comes to his tongue after a space of more than 30 years " It is very serious " That was his sole remark He slowly continued his journey to his cabin, where, sealed by the open door, to spread out his DaiUi heat and learned all that was to be told of a stumble that led to a prostration of the Liberal Party that recalled Disraeli's triumph in 1874, or the first successes of the Coalition Party at the general election of 1886 It was impossible, observing this scene, to avoid reflection on the altered circumstances under which the veteran statesman lived and still worked In obedience to his own injunction in a famous peroration he had been wise and wise in time Had he not at tho close of the long suasion that saw the Home Rule Bill carried through the Commons and shewed to pieces before the Lords, retired from the political arena, he would have found himself at the close of his little holiday in the B line face to face with a fresh and stupendous contest As it was he could read his paper with all the comfort and healthy interest of the man who had no responsibility for Ministerial action or the course of political events Not for him the anxious confabulation with Cabinet colleagues Not for him the slow arrival at momentous decisions No more Midlothian campaigns for him, nor any more the anxious watch- ing of the rising or falling poll, with the alternate issue of embarking him once more on a troubled Ministerial voyage, or in drifting him out to the hay once a sea of Opposition As after landing from the Tantallon Castle he drove through the crowded streets of the city he must have felt what marvellous change was brought in his condition Three years earlier driving through London, the metropolis throbbing in anticipation of a general election, his carriage would have been followed by on exciting crowd, some cheering, some hooting, according as conscience and conviction -stilled Now as he passed along at the slow pace necessitated by the city traffic, people on the pathways, recognising the familiar face and figure stopped to look ' There's Gladstone," they said to each other, and lifted their hats in mute, respectful salutation There was passing through the city streets not the strenuous statesman round whom for more than 50 years the turmoil of political warfare had raged It was only his ghost-a wealth that had nothing to do with election contests or with majorities in the House of Commons or the country Mr Gladstone is well content with this state of things, even grateful at its existence That on this particular day when he drove from the city in the circumstances indicated his renunciation of power was absolutely voluntary, and might, if he pleased, be only temporary, was a fact that had just been brought home to the public mind The report that he had by an overt act withdrawn his active support from Lord Rosebery; 's Government had, even though it was promptly and authoritatively, contradicted, dealt the Ministry a blow to which may probably be traced a powerful impetus towards its fall In conversation and in general bearing Mr Gladstone seemed delightfully unconscious of his potentiality Talking to me one day as we slowly threaded the mazes of the beautiful harbour of Gothenburg, ho pro faced some remarks about the new Speaker by saying that he did not follow these things very closely now " But," he added, " from what I have seen I have formed the highest opinion of Mr Gully's conduct in the Chair " If the life and doings of Bishop B Hitler, and the addition of the Danish to his store of spoken and written languages, do not leave of him much time to follow contemporary events in the House of Commons, his memory of scenes he has participated in is as vivid as ever Talk about the now Speaker led to a copy creation about his predecessor who, on the previous day at Kiel, Finding himself anchored close by the Tantallon Castle, had come on board to pay his respects to Mr Gladstone "Mr Peel," said Mr Gladstone (it was hard for one who had known him all his life to drop into the new state and talk of Lord Peel) " should for ever hold a high place in the list of Speaker of the House of Commons, if it were only for a single event He once inter- posed to say of the House of Commons from a position into which, had it fallen, it would have been eternally, disgraced " Then, with gathering tire, shining through flashing eyes, in a voice that might and doubtless was heard across the tender in which we were seated, Mr Gladstone recalled an event in the early history of Mr Joseph Gillis Biggar He had made use of an expedition which the Speaker find denounced as a breach of order In his dogged way he had refused to retract and apologise He was "named," and the usual motion was made that he be suspended from the I service of the House The debate was adjourned, and at the next sitting Mr Biggar yields:? to the advice and entreaty of some of his friends, withdrew the offensive! expression and offered his apology. At the time the member for Cavan was not undeservedly an object of especial contumely and scorn on the part of the Conservative members. They declined to accept the proffered apology, and noisily insisted upon carrying the motion of the suspension of the errant but judiciously respondent member. Then it was the Speaker interposed and suggested that Mr. Biggar having made an apology polar proceedings should not be carried further. " It was a bold a courageous stop for the Speaker to take in such circumstances," said Mr. Gladstone. "But it was a great thing to do, and it saved the House of Commons from a lamentable position. It will be an evil day for the House when it comes to pass that an apology offered by a member for an offence is not promptly accepted as absolute amends." _
