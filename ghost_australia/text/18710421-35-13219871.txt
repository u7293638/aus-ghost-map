THE WEATHER, AGRICULTURE, &c.; In the coast districts to tho South, although the sky has been occasionally overcast, little or no rain has fallen dur- ing the week. The Bombala correspondent of the Monaro Mercury, 15th instant, reports that the weather there during the previous ten days was all that could be desired. In Monaro, says the Mercury, during tho early part of the week, there was every indication that we should have a change, and a mizzling rain fell on Tuesday, continuing till night. Next day set in fine, and the weather has since continued so. Heavy frosts have occurred. At morning and evening the air is very cold, auguring that we shall have a somewhat severe winter. Rain would now be hailed with pleasure by farmers in this district, the ground being very hard. Grass is plentiful, affording every prospect of sufficient winter feed.
