GROANS OE A GUZZLER. By the Ghost of a Good Templar. AIR — 44 1 Stood on thh Bridge at Midnight." No. 1. — The Kerb. I sat on the kerb at midnight, And loudly I blew my nose, For my head was wildly throbbing, With dire and dreadful throes. And like the waters bubbling Over their slimv bed. Came various fancies gurgling Through the alleys of my head. How often, oh, how often, In the days gone long ago, I could swill and swill colonial, Without one passing throe. And frequently, how often Have I wished with all my might, That good old shea-oak I could swill Without me getting tight ! For my head how hot and aching, And my stom-jack very sick, And I canuot speak a sentence, But it muttered is and thick, And my pipe has been stolen from me, And is buried away from me, And from my very soul I long, For a g!ass of soda and B Yet sit I here on the kerbing, And the dark tide rolls through the town, Far, far to the distant harbour, Where the corks bob up and down ! And for ever and for ever, As long as that gutter flows, As long as shea-oak fills one With many aches and woes, The moon shall shine o'er Sydney, And its shadows shall appear, To remind those thirsty and weary Of the pints of flowing beer !
