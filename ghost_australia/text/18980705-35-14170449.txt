Crooke, R Windeyer, Marks and Duesbury THE PREMIER'S ADDRESS. PRELIMINARY The Premier, who was very cordially received, said -Gentlemen, It would have been more agreeable to me if we could have had some room like the Town Hall (hear, heart-so as to enable a larger number of the citizens of Sydney to be present, but as this is only a business meeting, for the election of a committee to conduct the electioneering c impugn, you can quite see that under the circumstances we had to make it a smaller meeting than usual But before this great campaign is over I hope and in fact within a very few days I intend, to invite the citizens of Sydney to meet me in the largest hall in the city (Applause ) OLD FRIENDS AND FORMER TRIUMPHS Many of you I recognise as in the front rank of the great Liberal party which won the Liberal triumphs of 1891 and 1901 (Hear, hear ) We fought upon those two occasions for the advancement of sound and liberal principles of legislation in this colony of New South Wales. On this occasion we have to take up an even nobler contest than that, namely, a battle in the cause of liberalism throughout all Australia. (Applause.) Of course under the exertions of the past four years you will not be surprised to see me in the dilapidated condition in which you see me now (applause and laughter, and a voice, " You are all right "and on previous performances I should no doubt now be approaching indeed I ought long ago to have been in-my political grave (Laughter i But somehow or other the kind and continued confidence of the Parliament and people of this country has kept me, as I think my opponents will find out very soon, as the best possible condition (" Hear, hear," and laughter There is one similarity in the situation as it existed it the last general election and the situation as it exists to-day On the last occasion you will remember there was a little federal party and a big protectionist party (hear, hear-and you will also remember on that occasion when the venerable leader of the Liberal cause whose memory we will all remember kindly, in spite of faults which every man most occasionally have (hear, hear- and in spite of mistakes which every man makes-and who will still be revered as the grand old champion of Liberalism in the early days or this colony (hear, hear) theate Sir Henry Parkes (hear, heart came forward against me in 1895 for past Sydney, and the only melancholy thing about it was the company he was re-hear hear) namely, Mr Barton, Mr R E O'Connor, Mr Wise, and a number of other shifty political quantities (Laughter ) Well, they gathered round the venerable old man, not so much because they loved him as because they wanted to "down" mo (Hear, hear) And it is said that the only occasion up to that time when Mr Barton was known to shed tears over a public event was when the sad news came that I had come out on top as usual (Cheers and laughter.) Well, we find that, in spite of these efforts to drag me from the position which, thanks to you, I have held in this country, I am here to-day, I believe, in a stronger position than ever (Applause ) I attribute that circumstance a great deal to the fact that I have had a band of loyal colleagues ther, hear-and that I have been supported by a loyal party (bear, hear-and when people indulge in all sorts of abusive language about me defamatory of my political conduct, my answer is that the men why have stood nearest to mostly men who are ray oldest friends are all round me to day (Applause ) MR BARTON CRITICISED Well, Mr Barton is going to try an impossible feat (Hear, hear.) He is going to degrade the great constituencies of New South Wales into the position of arbiters of a purely personal issue (Hear, hear ) I am happy to say that during my public career I have never been compelled to resort to that device (Hear, hear ) I have taken my stand always on great political principles, and I have thus earned the support of the electors of the country (Hear, hear ). When any man, however gifted he may be, however we may like him in every other sort of business but that which he is trying his hand at again, we will not allow him nor any other man to bring down the politics of this country into a mere question of choosing between Barton and Reid (Applause; If Mr Barton even now had come out with a programme containing a single political principle in it, he might he in a better position to day We have an easy task in setting ourselves before the public with our performances in the past and our programme for the future against a man of mystery with all his political cards up his sleeve That sort of attitude will never commend itself to men who know the tremendous is now at stake The only question, Mr Barton Says, is the question of trust That is a sort of question that always arises when a confidence trick is to be disposed of. (Applause ) If you happen to be a young man from the country -(laughter) with your pockets full of bank notes, a benevolent looking citizen, generally a stout person- (daughter) will get into conversation with you and overflow with the utmost benevolence for your welfare ("You seem to know all about it") Another equally respectable-looking party will come on and extol the virtues of the 1, and then No 1 and No 2 will refer to No 3 foracoitiBcateos to their combined trustworthiness, and before the young man knows where he is his notes are gone and the trust with it (Laughter.) I am happy to say that the party which I have the honour to represent did not come before you in that suspicious guise But, by-the-bye, although I rather think it unusual to have to enter into a political campaign by a series of personal comparisons the undertone running through the speech in the Legislative Council the other night always was, " I don't like quite to tell you, but I am the only man you can trust" (Laughter ) It is rather awkward for a man to spread himself out with a full-length testimonial of himself, and that is precisely what Mr Barton has done, and although I will return to Rub subject later I would like to say this, that the programme which hotpiopoBes to play, or rather not the program but the point which Mr. Barton pi proposes to play on this occasion, has not even the merit of being new, because he played it before (Laughter and applause.) This ardent federalist, fresh from the grand Convention of 1891, came before the loyal freetrade electors of East Sydney thear, hear) and asked them to trust him I grant that although he was a protectionist he came before them D8 a federalist and ob for Sir George Dibbs, he was a daily conundrum, the arch enemy of federation, and he would have none of it On those hustings I predicted that Mr Barton had known him for along time-(laughter)-would be the protectionist Attorney-General of a protectionist Ministry before many months were over And what happened ? He went in to support Sir Henry Parkes's federation, and he kept straight up to September 1, 1891, because on that day Mr. Copeland moved a protective motion in the Assembly, and Mr Barton got to close quarters with him and Sir George Dibbs, and speaking out according to his promise to East Sydney, he loyally opposed the introduction of that motion But within one month and jue half-month from that day the Government of Sir Henry Parkes fell, and the arch-enemy of federation had a portfolio to offer to the ardent federationist, and he was a conundrum no longer. You know as a rule when a very stiff conundrum comes before you you are inclined to give it up , but if it in a conundrum with a portfolio it is altogether another matter. Mr Barton did not give the conundrum up. He went into the Ministry with a fair arrangement Strathewan to have full time to push the federal movement, and Sir George Dibbs has never yet been accused by Mr Barton, and I know he could not be accused, of ever having repudiated his word to Mr Barton (Hear, hear In two months from that time this ardent friend of Australian union not to work to establish fiscal barriers against our Australian brethren all round New South Wales (Applause) When some of the gentlemen across the border get annoyed with me, who never made half the professions that Mr Barton made, I can remind you that when I got the opportunity of using power I used it to bring down every barrier that I could that separated us from the rest of the Australian colonies. (Applause.) And remember, gentlemen, the cost of a man is not the beautiful way in which he can write a manifesto, of the eloquent speech which he can give c the test of a man is when he is my position of power and trust Then you can judge him, because he has an opportunity of carrying out that which he promises (Hear, hear.) Mr. Barton was for two years in the Government of New South Wales, with full power to push the federal question on. sir Henry Parkes had. been two years in office, and had brought it on by a number of stages But in October, 1893, Sir Henry Parkes turned upon the gentleman who had borrowed his mantle and was sleeping in it (laughter) turned upon him and said in the House . " We have had four years in power, I and you, I have done this and that for federation during my two years What have you done ? " Nothing (Hear, hear ) I think that was when the House was not sitting (A voice on the platform No, no ) Well, I'm not sure, but whether he was Acting Premier or not, he was in equal power with Sir George Dibbs all through the Ministry That was not enough for this federal enthusiast In 1863 he proposed his Government proposed-a system of tolls on the Darling and the Murrumbidgee rivers in order to ruin the trade of Victoria and South Australia and drive it to Sydney It seems to me that the gentleman with such a record behind who talk about promise and good faith and consistency trust too much to the forgetfulness of intelligent men (Applause ) MR REID SETS A STANDARD OF CHIVALRY You remember the memorable night of June 3 (Laughter.) These knights of Australian chivalry had a good opportunity of showing the true nature of their inner spirit under the glow of fancied triumph, and only too soon thereafter, under the black spell of disaster (Applause and laughter ) Now let us regard these gentlemen Messrs Barton, O'Connor, and Wise as they showed themselves to the people of Australia when they thought their sacred mission had been accomplished One would think that at that supreme moment, when it was believed that after so many years of trial and disappointment at last the electric current of nationality had completed its circuit over tho whole of the Australian continent, those who had been so full of professions of the finest feelings of humanity would in the moment of triumph have forgotten the small personalities of the recent conflict in a fit of generous enthusiasm (Hear, hear ) instead of that these supposed victors in a great, peaceful national movement displayed a style of vindic- tive language which reminded one not of these bright, peaceful lands of Australia but of the Commune in Paris (Applause ) The scaffold was erected, and there was a positive grudging sort of admission that before they were swung off you would have to bear their last dying speech of confession (Laughter ) On that test of success these magnanimous gentlemen broke down before the whole community (Hear, hear) Now let us look at them when the Cupid from the adjoining newspaper office arrived upon the triumphant scene and found three of the leading federalists struggling for their lives beneath the weight of King Barton. (Loud laughter ) Im- mediately the messenger was to be exalted to a similar perilous condition but the dread truth came out that that reliable journal, when its leaders are not written by an ox-Melbourne journalist- (loud applause \- had made a mistake of 10 or 12 thousand votes They came out to the window again. The drum had ceased to boat (Laughter ) The flag was wet, but not with joyous tears and then in the hour of disaster they had an opportunity of regaining the reputation for chivalry of generosity But again the same dreadful threats of this party at once announced that a perfect simmer of destruction should overtake the traitors who had voted for the 80,000 qualification They have half of them in their ranks to-day (Applause ) But all at once, after these heroes of half an hour had melted away silently in the darkness of the night, a perfect conspiracy of silence said the gentlemen, who for a month or so before could not be reined in by the "Herald " Nora Baird came from the recesses where the flags and the drums were stored THE GOOD CONDUCT OF THE GOVERNMENT I would now like to show you the difference between these tortuous tactics of sudden silence and the conduct of the responsible Government of the country Between June 3 and June 7 I was in structed as to my duty I should consult Mr Barton Well, I might have consulted Mr Barton or anyone else, but the programme which they announced of repealing the provisions about the 80,000 votes and forcing the bill through the Parliament of the country with a programme which made it impossible for any responsible Minister to consult Mr Barton (Applause ) Then again, I was told I ought to have called the delegates together Well, the Act provided that if the 80,000 votes were not reached nothing further should be done pursuant to the Act so the delegates were dead And us to some of them, I do not know but that the interests of New South Wales are not stronger for their political decease (Hear, hear.) It was manifestly impossible to tell them together I bon I think I took the course which the people of this colony would desire I should take The result of the vote had shown that New South Wales is prepared loyally to take her place at the head of Australian federation when the deed of partnership is more equitable (Cheers ) Vhe vote had also shown that any attempt to overcome the tremendous opposition to the bill was worse than a waste of time, because it would be productive of bad blood THE PROPOSED PREMIERS' CONFERENCE So that I felt it my duty, on behalf of the people of this colony, to take a step to show the other Premiers that, although this vote had happened as it did, we were not desirous of abandoning our efforts to bring this federation about So I sent a telegram to Sir George Turner from the Cabinet, which I will now read to you This telegram was sent on June 7, after a meeting of the Cabinet was held to consider the matter I will ask you to listen to this telegram -" At a meeting of the Cabinet hold this morning the position of the federal movement was considered, and I have to inform you that the views expressed in my confidential telegram of Saturday met with the approval of the members of the Government present Whilst we see no prospect of the acceptance in New South Wales at any subsequent stage of the Convention Bill, the events and results of the recent campaign show that our people, as a whole, are sincere well. wishers to the cause of Australian union, and that with alterations the bill would be accepted by a large majority of the electors Under these circumstances my colleagues cordially concur in my request that the Premiers of the colonies represented at the Convention should meet as soon as possible to confer and exchange views as to an improvement in those provisions of the bill which affected most seriously its success on Friday last in this colony If the conference be agreed upon-" And as you listen to this telegram you will see that these cobwebby-like inventions against me will disappear The telegram continued -" If the conference be agreed upon we will undertake to prepare and send to you before its meeting particulars of the subjects we desire to invite you to reconsider and our views respecting them We strongly suggest that the Premier of Queensland should be invited to the proposed conference " THE OFFER TO QUEENSLAND Now it was suggested on that telegram that in bringing Queensland into this matter, or desiring to do so, Twos using treachery to the other colonies That is the sort of thing imputed to me a voice "That is only what Mr Barton says") but the fact is I showed my anxiety that Queensland should come in by travelling something like 1300 miles to Brisbane and back again to endeavour to persuade Queensland to came into the Convention So that my conduct was not only absolutely right in itself, but was absolutely in accordance with my previous efforts (Applause) Thou the next thing said is, "When you sent your telegram to Sir George Turner he replied wanting to know what your amendments were, and you immediately brushed him aside Why ? " Because, as is clearly stated in the telegram, I agreed to make the disclosure of my amendments to the Premiers and our views respecting them conditionally on the Premiers agreeing to the conference (Applause ) Even Mr Barton does not show his hand too often or too recklessly. It would have been silly for me to show Sir George Turner or you all the cards I had in my hand before they agreed to come into the conference That is the sort of way in which your opponents criticise you But Sir George Turner in an interview with a newspaper representative in Melbourne said, " I do not mind meeting Mr Herd to talk over matters, and I do not mind any unimportant amendments " Well, the moment I saw that I did what I think you or any gentleman in this audience would have done I sent Sir George Turner this telegram -" I have received your telegram respecting proposed conference of Premiers with pleasure Of course, the proposed meeting would be a mere waste of time unless the Premiers are prepared to make the bill more acceptable to New South Wales, not in immaterial matters, but in matters of substance This remark is suggested by an interview with you reported from Melbourne this morning I will send copy of your telegram and of this reply to the other Premiers " I got two tremendous replies, one from Sir Edward Braddon-ylaughter)-and another from Mr Kingston, of South Australia-(laughter)-aud on the faith of those replies you are all asked to withdraw your confidence and support from this Government and this party, and to bow down to the friend of Sir Edward Braddon and Mr Kingston PECULIAR POLITICAL MEMORIES But those gentlemen who are running me down havE a most peculiar memory In the early part of this month, when these telegrams were being exchanged, they published triumphantly that the Premiers had snubbed Mr Reid Later on in the month, when they wanted another ery, they accused me of snub- bing the Australian Premiers (Laughter) Then, again, early in the month I was told that unless I submitted a definite statement of our proposed amendments to Sir George Turner I was unworthy of trust Later in the month, when I submitted them, not to Sir George Turner, but to those who had an infinitely greater right to know what my proposals were-the Parliament and the people of the country was told that I had for the third time murdered federation by adopting thousand and-deliver argument to my brother Prouiiora When you read such inconsistent twaddle day after day in a really able newspaper you know what a miserable plight they are in Do not let us forget at such a time as this the great and loyal services which the "Sydney Morning Herald " rendered to this great party in years that have gone by (Cheers ) do not care how much that journal tries to write me down, I will never forget the loyal stand the journal took in fighting the battle of liberalism, and also the battle of just federation But at that time, the able pen that wrote those brilliant liberal leaders was wielded by one of our own people Do not let me dismiss the able and courteous gentleman who now writes the leaders for the "Sydney Morning Herald," I have no desire to do so All I say is that I have seen Victorians so saturated with Victorianism that they can never get rid of it I do not mind down- right Australian federal feeling, but I think that that feeling should have some sort of regard for the rightful interests of the country in which we live The next; thing is that they would have you be lieve that ever since that time the Premiers of Australia and myself are in a state of the most deadly antagonism As a matter of fact we still correspond ??fcto9MmefnoudlyjT>y not we ever did. before. Sir Edward Braddon the other day sent me a long and official letter in recognition of the generous policy of New South Wales towards Tasmania. They were putting certain articles of New South Wales production on a lower duty, and they sent me adroit agreement to enable them to sauntering things free of duty. CHOOSING A PREMIER. Sir Edward Braddon and Mr. Kingston are loyal! Premiers to the colonies they represent, when I seem to take a conrBO against the interests of their colonies they naturally oppose me and want to see some other man in my shoes, and what is more, they have already chosen him As a rule it is the people of New South Wales who choose the Premier to rule over them. On this occasion you are asked by some persons to back the choice of the representatives of the other colonies of Australia If Mr Barton had come out with a straightforward programme of amendments, as we have done he would soon have lost his popularity, but then Mr. Barton says "This is altogether too delicate a matter for straightforward dealing wea must negotiate - we must negotiate Well, the country whose vital interests are going to be dealt with will first of all want to know whether the negotiator has been squared by the other side. The next thing the country will want to know is whether he honestly believes in the cause he is going to fight for Now Mr. Barton did not say so , He came before the Legislative Council the other night, and this was the attitude he took "As to the policy of the three-fifths majority, I defended that, but as there seems to be a large prejudice against it, | I am prepared to negotiate Then, as to the capital I have always resisted help to those who wanted to put the capital in New South Wales, but as it really now looks as though we have to gain I that point, I think we ought to Bay we will negotiate " Now I should think that if a man in private life wanted to select an arbitrator to fight his battles for him, he would begin by having some idea of , whether or not his arbitrator believed in his cause and was willing to fight his battle for him The only attitude Mr Burton has assumed to his brother Premiers in view of the question of federation is this .. Dear Turner, dear Kingston, dear Torrcit, dear Barton You know very well I think that this is all humbug You know well I have told the people of New South Wales that a fairer compromise of the various conflicts of the different colonies could never be devised You know how I left the matter alone when they tried to put the capital in New South Wales. But when I asked the little chap in New South Wales to shut his eyes, and open his mouth, and see I what I would give him, he positively refused to shut his eyes (Applause It is very unfederal, but it is like those narrow provincialists in New South Wales " (Cheon ) Well, gentlemen, you know what little boys who play the game be in one of them that his eyes, the sweet little morsel goes into another boy's month so it would be if you shut your eyes to get a sweet marool-you would find that it would go under the tongue of Sir George Turner, Sir Edward Braddon, or Mr Kingston I say that if this great national movement is to be consummated, it to be done by independent men in an open and straight forward manner (Cheers ) QUOTATIONS FROM MR BARTON'S SPEECHES Let me show you the sort of things that could be said against Mr Barton when he got into a room with the other Premiers to try to fight your battle Mr. Barton said, " The constitution is the most bold, free, and liberal in the whole world " " Truth is imperishable, so is the even-handed justice of this scheme " " If there were flaws they had the democratic right to amend them " " A true and just plan of government fitted for the adoption of a free people " " He recommended it with all his heart and his soul" (Laughter) In the attitude of the small States was not aggressive it was purely one of self-defence " " Up to the crack of doom they would never get a constitu- tion more just, liberal, or fair in Recognising the conflicting claims and interests of the several States " " The bill was abundantly fair to New South Wales Hon material interests were treated on an absolutely fair basis." The rejection of this bill would be tantamount to the rejection of federa- tion " (Applause ) '? As fair a provision for preserving, their constitutional liberties as could be framed " ' Could not be improved by any organisation who know of " (A voice " That was an 1891 speech") No it is all the other day. These remarks are contained in speeches delivered between March 21 last and April 28 " If unable to raise 80,000 votes they would find the rest of Australia united, whilst New South Wales would be left out in the cold " Now, this is the stiffest statement of all-The deadlock clauses were so framed that the will of the majority must ultimately prevail " " The colony was fairly dealt with in the matter of its railways and rivers " " The added cost of federation would be 3d a week for every man, woman, and child " Now where would Mr Bolton, the negotiator " for New South Wales, so when his " brother " Premiers read those utterances out ? (Cheers ) No wonder they are clamouring all round these colonies for Mr Barton (Hear, hear ) Well, he has had some understudies through this campaign Mr O'Connor (whom I have great respect for). " The constitution was the best that could be arrived at I will support it with all my heart He stopped short of " the soul a (laugh worn-out added " and to the best of my power " At Marrickville he said " I want to point out the impossibility of the realisation of any idea that we are going to call those colonies together after what had taken place because a certain number of persons in New South Wales have certain objections to the constitution " By-the-bye do you remember that Mr Barton even used the name of the Supreme Being when he exclaimed, " God means to give us this federation ? " If he had known more of Scripture he would have completed it and said " in His own good time " (Applause ) The irresistible logic of this is that whatever side Providence is on He is not on Mr Barton's side REFERENCES TO MR WISE AND OTHERS. Now I come to refer to a gentleman to whom I seldom refer, because he excites such melancholy feelings in the breast of men who remember him when he was a promising and bright Liberal I allude to the gentleman who, after flying all round the political heaven, is going to fight a gentleman who without his claims to social distinction has been an honest hearted true Liberal representative (Ap- plause ) He is coming down upon Mr Bavister Why did not he come down and have an " interview " with me ¡> (A voice " That's what Barton ought to do ") Well, Mr Wiso-(a voice " George Washington 1 I should like to see George Washington again, and if anything would bring him to us again that is the sort of thing that would. Well, Mr Wise gives you his guarantee that this is a thoroughly democratic measure, and says you must either accept the bill or go in for separation This is the gentleman who speaks of the rights of the people in connection with money bills " a subject fit for antiquarians " (Applause ) This is the gentleman who, surrounded by a highly conservative audience in the Melbourne Convention, uttered this gross slander upon the people of Australia when he spoke of the referendum -that "it confined us to taking the opinion of Philip drunk or sober, and the probability is that he will be in his cups " That signed the death warrant of B R Wise (Applause ) On another occasion he spoke of something which he was almost inclined to do as " a concession to popular ignorance " This gentleman, who began be fairly and so well in the Liberal cause, has shared the fate of every other prominent man in the old Government connected with the freetrade party outside the Ministry and our own party of to-day, who have loyally stuck to me all through. Whilst I was good enough to pass legislation I was never good enough for Mr B R Wise, Mr Bruce Smith and some others All I have to say is they have all bumped up against me , but I am still here. On one occasion Mr Wise was put in a position which certainly did expose him to the intense ridicule of every member in the Assembly On that memorable occasion when Sir Henry Parkes moved a vote of censure upon the Government with the support of Sir George Dibbs there was one political maid of all work who was hanging about the door of the opposition PAYMENT OF MEMBERS AND MR BRUCE SMITH As for Mr Bruce Smith, that gentleman was altogether too superior a person to say much about. You all know the purely independent stand he took on the subject of payment of members He was too superior a man to take it We got later on a public document stating that some calculation was to be made, as it was to be handed over to the charities of the Glebe A little time after we got an application to know the exact amount, and it was drawn out of the Treasury £800 think-("£850")-and we have never seen it since. (Laughter ) Wheutho bill was passing through the House I proposed an amendment that it should not apply to that Parliament, because payment was intended to give a freer, wider choice to the people I did not draw a penny from that Parliament I sent down to know the amount that was due to me, and instead of drawing it for myself and not leaving it there, not knowing what might happen to me, for someone else to draw it, I paid it back into the Treasury and cut myself off. (Apploueo ) I would not have mentioned this matter but that I had been accused by these gentlemen of drawing it When this superior person, with the keenest commercial instinct in the world, comes before the public to state that I am unworthy of confidence I want to show the people when it came to a pinch where his money went, and where mine went THE GOVERNMENT AMENDMENTS Now I want to go away from these gentlemen to the amendments which the Government proposed always saw that unless we gave equal representation in the Senate there was no chance of bringing about federation I made a very great sacrifice to the federal cause when I consented to a thing which, in the circumstances, was inherently unjust (Hear, hear j Now, let me just mention the position of the federating colonies New South Wales, with a population of 1,323,000 souls, will pay £207,000 a year to the new expenditure of the Commonwealth, and a tariff of £7,000,000, such as the Finance Committee reported, would draw £3,010,000 from New South Wales alone in Victoria the population is a 1,170,000 , contribution to the new expenditure, £181,000 per year, tariff, £2,2 10 000 South Australia, population IGJ.OOO £50,800 a year to federation £735,000 to the tariff Western Australia, 102,000 people, £2,350 to the federation: £700,000 to the tariff Tasmania, 171,000 people , £26 850 to the new expenditure £315,000 to the tariff Now I say, gentleman that in a federation in which the two colonies of New South Wales and Victoria, with their 2,600,000 people and their ¿5,250,000 of the federal tariff of £7,000,000, a system under which these two colonies would have) six tower members in the Senate than the other - three was absolutely unjust But we made the sacrifice for federation All through I atina lated, when making that sacrifice, there must be some provision in the constitu- tion which in a time of crisis would enable the voice of the whole nation to prevail Well, I told you at the Town Hall what I tell you now that the bill to King Munjet w jwt/sntwlactorj*) (Hear, hear.) It has been said that I voted for the three plans majority. Those who make that statement know that there is only that complexion to be put on what I did by the shabbiest political trick Sir George Turner was asking something infinitely worse even than a joint sitting with the three-fifths Mr Carruthers may claim and compelled all those who were in favour of the joint sitting as against the Turner proposal which, if I recollect right, Vis a national and pi evinced referendum together, St thing that would have been the greatest absurdity in the world because under it the nation might pro nounce one way and the little) States the other, and the little States would prevail-to vote for it I was against that absurdity, and would rather have the joint sitting under the three-fifths principle Mr Carruthers appealed to us not to be wrecked by Sir George 1 timer s amendment, but to vote for his in order to get principle of the joint sitting in the bill vi o did that I got that peg in mind I Voted for striking out the three fifths when the bill came up again in Melbourne, and before the bill was finished Mr Bruce Smith wrote a whole column to the " Herald " in order to play an attempt to play, with practically half the people of the country He know well I v owed against the three-fifths clause when Mr Higgins proposed it in Melbourne My policy amongst those gentlemen was the right one They were steadily fighting to get everything for the smaller States I hobo in favour of the true principles of democracy did all they could to make the bill more in accordance with our wishes and be cause we voted for the, the obviously unfair assumption is that this was all wo w toil Now they know that was not so-that in the closing hours of the Convention I made a speech which showed my utter disgust at the helplessness of bringing the bill into line with the principles in which I believe the reference to this question the Government say there must either be a national referendum with it, or that the three-fifths majority in the joint sitting of the two Houses must be made a simple. in front) (Applause ) THE FINANCIAL CLAUSES The next thing the Government has mentioned is that the financial provisions should be recast and the Braddon blot removed (Cheers) Those financial provisions, m ra) belief, he absolutely the best which we can arrive at on those lines If a new system is to be substituted for it, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one system pos Bible in its place, and that is that the railways and public debts should be handed over to the federation -(applause) and it would even be necessary whether you handed over the control of the schools or not to hand over the cost of education in the colonies. The great point on the question of the railways To this 'I his country will never allow a system of transfer of railways which did not protect us as to our absolute freedom to develop our internal resources by the extension of the existing lines of new lines of railway (Cheers ) On that head it has been pointed out time that the bill should contain a guarantee that all railways proposed through the State Parliaments as an extension of new lines, if accompanied by a guarantee to the Commonwealth against loss, would have to protect us in that important respect This question of railway transfers in the great a subject to give a definite picnic in favour of either one or the other schemes, but I want to let you know what I think about" is The effect of the transfer would be this That instead of a high tariff of something like £7 000 000 or more to meet the desperate necessities of the different States a tariff of something like to 000,000 would be sufficient Then, of course, there would be no question about returning misuse" of scrambling about surpluses in the order in Pirlivuienl (Hear, hear ) so that the matter is one which will require serious consideration, and the choice will be between hand- ing over these things and having a moderate tariff or not handing them over and I-wing an enormous tariff under which this colony would have to pay something like £3,000,000 i 5 ch As to the " Braddon blot," over Mr Barton now thinks it is a little pimple on the federal body (Laughter ) THE POWER OF THE PURSE Now I come to another matter which I look upon as being just as it is as pup in this bill Some people like Mr Wise, talk about the control of the people's representatives over their taxation and expenditure as if it was a thing to amuse people and on show in the British Museum "(Langhtcr 1 But men like Mr Gladstone and Sir Henry Parkes and I will read to you two or three of his prophetic words later on-said that whilst you are masters of the public a true, you are masters of the situation If you have two masters of the purse instead of one j our finances will degenerate into a profligate scandal, 113 111 America The secret of the stability of the magnificent system of British finance, which is the envy of the world is that long ago the Liberals of England were able to wrest from those who did not represent the taxpayers the power over the purse, and since that time the finances of Great Britain have been the admiration of the world More than that, is there a more just principle 111 the vi old than that the people whose pockets are to be ransacked, whose earnings are to be taken should, by their representatives, have the sole responsibility of expending the taxes i Thee are the cardinal prin- copies of liberalism of the British Empire, and they represent the vital principle of good government, and they fairly represent the liberalism of Sir Henry Par ker until he got too close in touch with some of our friends on the Constitutional Committee In that memorable coming t m Sydney, in 1891, between _ those who sought to give the Senate equal powders we .. i" as its,, aim fnoPO y,0 1 _ 10 Leop the power of the pans with the House of Representatives, fan Henry Parkes in his speech said, " in a free and successful Government there cannot be two Houses to deal with bills of that character Why do we hesitate to give them the same power 111 dealing with what are somewhat erroneously tenue 1 money bills J Because all taxes levied must be burdens on the people of the country Our ground of principle in that the Ch amber elected directly by the people by the taxpayers, shall alone deal with all the impositions of burdens and the distribution of the revenue from the taxes are imposed " As I put it to them in the Convention If all the States put down an equal share towards the expenditure of the Commonwealth, then give equal powers to the Senate but since the area of taxation is national, the area of application in reference to money bills should be national too ' But Mr Barton in the year 1891 in the course of 1 beautiful Conservative speech announced that he know no reason why the Senate should not have as free a right to amend money bills as bills or any other description let me remind you that Mr. Barton, Mr M'Milhia and Ali Bruce Smith are close grained Conservatives it heart AMENDMENT! OF THE COIS STITUTION Now, the next thing I want to point out is this It is said that this bill contains 1 provision which provides for the amendment of the constitution but there is a little rider pul 111 You can imagine it was put in not to protect the many that the for the amendment of the representation of the smaller State should be made without the consent of them Well, that is not a bad provision, but we must improve a little I propose especially cou bidding the position of New South Wales with three colonies 00 bel flank and that does not apply to us alone-that no State bout Jury shall be altered without the consent of the "-tale itself They will tell you that that is in the bill it is, but it is not in the light pines As the bill stands, a proposal to amend the constitution can be carried by a majority of Victim, South Australia and Tasmania -by a majority of the people, by 11 majority of States by a majority of both Houses, and then out comes the provision in the hill But I say with all due respect to the other colonies and giving them the ut most "credit for fair play that if these provisions are put in to safeguard one thing we must have them put in to safeguard mother I tell you frankly from south of this (man- ual problem whether you settle it in (one way or the other it is impossible to settle it without a large contribution from this colony Even if no put over the railways an 1 public debts there would still be half a million to be made up I tell you that in view of the pecuniary sacrifice-, we might have to make, and might desire to make to I mag about federation on proper lines the claim for the capital is an absolutely just one since some people mc attracted b> price dents, may I mention that under the Canadian Constitution the capital was fixed at Ot'nwu, 11 place with 11 the larger prov race of the group BROAD PRINCIPLES I will tell 1911 of 11 number of principles upon which I say this bill should stand Stale rights which it is necessary to protect to be protected by express words in the constitution (Hear, hear National rights to be protected by democratic provisions giving the people as a nation the power of control 111 the last- resort (Hear, hear ) Club covers all the delicate and debateable ground when a question will have to be settled is one of trust-the pact ought to trust the whole, 1 other than the whole the j) lit (Applause) He province ought to trust the federation, rather than the federation have to trust the province MR REID'S VOTE Passing away from those points, I shall again refer to the position occupied by Mr. Barton and his nose dates in connection with this bill and the country have been accused, as you know, of all sorts of political obliquity In the course which I followed I took the ground which I take now-that my vote is my own, and I am only possible to my own conscience for the way in which I used it I did not conceal how I was going to vote I told the public openly what my vote would be he is that I made a great sacrifice and imperilled the fortunes of the whole party in undertaking that course (Hear, hear) If I had said I was going to oppose the bill. Mr. Want would not have had to leave me I felt as the representative 111 a peculiar sense of all New South Wales, as it had acted in post years most Bbabbilj to the other colonies, in taking this matter up and letting it drop I felt I would expose myself to all the ignominy of the opposition by voting for the bill I made, I believe, too great a sacrifice to my public position in voting so (Hear, hear ) I know it would damage my public reputa- tion I had sense enough to know that by the course I took it would damage my There was one depth of inconsistency to which I could not descend I was not born in this country -as Mr. Barton often re- minds you-but I have lived long enough here to be full of sincere affection for the people of this country, for they lifted me to the position which any man might be proud of They have show 11 an extent of generous confidence which no man in this country before me has received MR REID ON SINCERITY There is one depth of political disgrace to which I could not sink-I could not rise to blind the eyes of the people of this country to the true character of the bill (Loud applause ) If I had followed up an inconsistent vote with a series of treacherous speeches, I could now be, according to the "Sydney Morning Herald" and Mr Barton, one of the noblest statesmen in Australia I am not blind to fact that this coming federation will transfer the base of great political distinction from this area to the federal centre I am not blind to the fact that if I had followed the devious course of those gentlemen, and the hour of the federal triumph had come, I, with them, could have made a triumphal entry into that Federal Parliament-by betraying you I know well that the course I would take would cause thousands of those in whose hands will be the future power of Australia to regard me with dislike and aversion But I think if you talk about sincerity, and impute insincerity) to the man who with large federal opportunities does his duty to his own people, and brings upon him self dislike and hatred perhaps in other federal countries too-) you are raising the men who glorify the Australian that is to be at the expense of their country Mr Barton admits that my Town Hall speech was consistent with my statement to him Melbourne. It is a great admission from him Laughter ) Through all my political life I am not indebted to him for much He said I deceived him after wards I ask you to call to mind whether to the 1 Town Hall I did not touch every one of the defects in the bill and fearless) expose them Lift Mr Barton says m) later speeches acquired a sterner and more unfriendly tone 1 now will follow, gentlemen and the country the reason for that I never believed it possible that a number of men who had sat in that Convention, as Messrs Barton, O'Connor, and W |so did could have stumped this country and have made the speeches they did which coming from men of another colony you could forgive but as coming from the representatives and trusted men of this colony, amounted to a practical conspiracy to trade upon the noblest impulses and feelings of the people of this country, and to keep away from them the true gravity and significance of the bargain they were asked to make (Applause) Unless I felt it my duty, standing alone as I did amongst all these delegates-I was alone with the exception of Mr Lyne said he lins disappeared-(liughtcr)-I fell it my duty, I say, to the people of this colony, as this torrent of deception rolled over them, to do more and more to let you see what the thing really was And when Mr Barton talks of sincerity cam p iro his record with mine (Applause ) MR BARTON'S PAST RECORD We began about the same time as enthusiastic freetraders (Hear, hear ) One day in 1836 some of his most intimate friends were astounded with the intelligence that this enthusiastic champion of free ride in the public life of the colony had joined a protectionist Ministry as its Attorney-General That Ministry lived a few months and Mr Barton disappeared again into political oblivion no was appointed to the Federal Convention of 1891 Do followed Sir Henry Parkes, and when that gentleman went out of office Mr Barton was the chosen champion of the people to push on the great enterprise of feder alien He had the power, he had the occasion, and he had the duty to do, and yet during those two vc 113 of his power there was beating of the federal drum, there was no printing of the animal Indgo No, he was busy) during that time putting duties on Australian produce coming into New South Wales from the other colonies" (Applause ) I hit was the tr information scene, and it was a far greater degree of trenches) to the federal cause than has over been committed MR REID'S TBDEBAL PREDILECTION S When I came into power I came in with no pledges about federation I was free "at the moment the great battle of freetrade was accomplished, and those South Australian duties were removed, that moment I took up the cause which Mr Button had left in the dirt (Applause ) I took it upon luiCB which showed that I perceived the great truth that this high national enterprise could novel come home to the intelligence or the patriotism of the people of Australia until it was brought down to their level and they were compelled to take an interest in it (Applause) It ceased to be the plaything of politics and It became the hope of the people and the moment a great cause touches that secret fire which resides in the soul of a free and loyal community there is some hope that there will be a string of the feelings that bring great bodies of people together The history of Hub movement is that but for the Government and its initiative of it would have slumbered in the neglected plaything of the men who had left it to decay) (Hear, hear.) The men whom Mr Bayton no v says cannot be trusted are the men who lit tod this great cause into a healthier and nobler at mosphere, and undorthcnuspices of this Government, which he asks you to ov earthing, the question has assumed its true proportion of a national interest and importance (Applause ) THE ISSUES AT THE NEXT EL] ACTION Some say this election must turn on federation They are quite light, hat they laugh moto score Then I refer to matters of great importance and interest in our own local affairs I do not think the people of the country have so narrow a y cw of the duties of a Government as those who speak in that way (Hear, hear) Although federation must be the prominent question at this election, it would not do for us toime every thing else As the head of the Government we are bound to do our duty to the country there is room for all of the reform' I will not labour this speech with a programme of the changes wo hay c brought about already I will not refer to the great strides in the administrative work of the Government, such as those which put the land system man infinitely better position-(cheers)-which lins enormously increased the spread of agriculture and industries of all kinds 'Cheers ) I will not eat or to the long series of great reforms which have been proposed to You by other Governments during the year that when pressed The ""Ph of that his son two and a u madrilene were in squatted in the one simple fact that when the leader of the Opposition c Ballenger I our position he simply did so on the ground that we could not be trusted with the federal movement No Government ever came out of office with a grander certificate than that I will leave it at that the ruruRE As to the future I cannot be silent I regret that, instead of all the things we record Esher, there are some things we could not do the state of our system of legal redress is a disgrace to this country) The A attorney-General has prepared a bill which will completely) reform the system pre v sing in our Supreme Court and bring it more in touch with pro cut day procedure, and make the process of law more expeditious, priced), and economical that bill will be laid on the table of Parliament in a few days when there 13 reform of the Upper House (Avoca " you promised that for years ago') You are quite right and your friends promised it 20 years ago (Laughter ) you are bound to get an odd one in sometimes Well, we did more than promise it four years ago you made a determined effort to pass it Having sent my supporters and friends to the country after 12 mouths of Parliament I should have been a perfect glutton if I had sent them again That would suit the men outside but it would not take them inside at till I had the choice between throwing the country into a state of politic cal confusion 0- going on with a number of useful measures the country wanted for many years I I venture to say I did my duty to the country by taking the course I did I do not wish to destroy the Upper House I don't believe in an elective House, but I do think that the principle of nominating for life any man to play the part of a legislator in any house is utterly wrong Ay oil, instead of any revolutionary proceeding, vital we propose is that a certain number of members shall refuse periodically and others shall take their places and be eligible for an election There is nothing revolutionary in such a proposal The House will remain untouched, and a stream of new blood will be flowing in LOCAL GOVERNMENT As to local government As you know I had a Local Government Bill almost through the Assembly but Mr Lyne wrecked it I have learned that we were preceding on absolutely wrong lines It is absolute") tight that 1 settled district with a fair population should be brought under local government, but the idea of being tng enormous pastoral areas which are sparsely populated under local government 13 unfair As to the municipalities there is a bill now in type in my office which will improve the existing law, so that municipalities will have a chance of being re stored to their proper position, and of also having a permanent satisfy nig cudon ment from the Treasury) It is utterly unfair that municipal localities taxed so seriously should get no help from the Government also propose that the Government should come to the help of municipalities which are borrowing and give them money or guarantee their loans so that they can get money at 11 low rate of interest sound muuicinalitiea-nit rotten ones ADULT SUrril aGE Another great question which I have pronounced myself in favour of is the extension of the suffrage to the adults of this country (Applause ) I cannot definitely at this stage 1 realise that the whole Government will adopt that as a Government measure of policy I believe that a majority of the present Government are in favourable and if we do not adopt it as a Government measure it c 1 tandy shall have a Minister to take it up I Applause ) THE US. EMPLOYED There is a subject which has been brought home to me very keenly during the past few years there is a class of unfortunates whose case deserves the intervention of the Government The finest spent most of our citizens me by the sheer force of necessity degraded law or the law of This Government intends to take up this question of provision for the aged workers (Applause) Our endeavour will always be to provide a system which will take work from them and give them payment in return the less charity and the more fair and reasonable the employment the better for them REFORM MEASURES I hope the aliens Bill will be passed this week. The laws relating to minnie, the fisheries, the great friendly societies, shipping and navigation, will be attended to They are a disgrace to the community in the consolidation of the laws we have had the unpaid and generous services of Mr G G Roydon a STRAiGirrronwARD federal POLICY And now, gentlemen, thanking you for the magnificent hearing which you have given me, I wish it to be understood, by all those who wish to under - stand, that this Government comes 1 sure the people of the country in an attitude with respect to federation which is in harmony with its straightforward policy upon all other public matters We take you into our confidence as to the blemishes 111 the bill, was 0 put our hand on those blemishes not as things to be mentioned with bated breath as the prejudices of a provincial community but we put them as sound matters of common justice, not only to ourselves but to the whole of the people of this country. (Applause.) And looking upon the prospects of this coming struggle, we stand pledged, every man in this Ministry, to bring about this noble federation of the Australian colonies (Applause ) But it must be a federation brought about by open trans parent investigation of the nature of the transaction must be thoroughly ventilated, and the bill must be radically improved In fighting the battle for New South Wales in most of our demands in the most difficult of them-we are also fiqWiDg tho We for all Australia. (He hear ) The battle for those sound principles of stable government and the enlightened spirit of self-restrained democracy which is the glory of the motherland, and which will be the chief support of this new temple of liberty in which we will enshrine the destinies of our Australian Commonwealth (Loud cheers ) MR WANT, AN HONEST FEDERALIST Mr Want, in response to loud demands, addressed the meeting He said he come there to let them know that there was no more honest federalist in the country than he was People had lied about him a good deal, knowing they are lying He had only opposed Mr Barton's federation because it was not sound, and was only intended to glorify Mr Barton It was a federation which was not fair and honest for New South W ales the Ministry came pledged to bring uboutaaystom of federation til it would be more, fair and honest to ISovv South Wales as well as the other colonies (Hear hear) a lion he started out on his crusade against the bill. Mr. Barton and the gentlemen associated with him declared it was a perfect measure, but now admitted it should be amended in order to remove the blot that he Mr Want) had pointed out If over there was a man who had played traitor to his country in this matter it was Mr Barton, and he would be astonished if the people could be gulled into accepting that gentleman as the recognised leader of the movement (Applause 1 Would they trust a man who was prepared to sell his country- (near support men who had honestly shown where the bill was wrong and saved the people from falling into the gutter dug for them A (Yes ) He ventured to say that when the general elections were over it would be found that the four gentlemen who were advocating the bill would not be returned to Parliament (Hear, hear) Mr Millen was a little man compared with Mr Barton but he had a heart as big as Barton's car- case (Laughter) If Mr Barton went to Bourke and he seemed inclined to shirk it already Mr Millen would defeat him, and those who were looking forward to following Mr Barton as a leader would find that they were following a Will of the Wisp " Mr. Millen, who was received with loud cheers, said that be accepted their applause as expressive of of sympathy in the great Ufht he was entering into He believed in the cause of he was fighting and know- ing that cause must triumph, he asked for nothing better than to meet the champion of the so- called federal cause (Cheers ) APPOINTMENT OF A COMMITTEE On the motion di Mr K Hawken, seconded by Mr S E Lees, the following resolution was carried -' that the following gentlemen be selected to represent the citrons' wing of the Liberal and relief rai party to act in cooperation with the Parliamentary committee section, with power to add to their number -Messrs Beniauun li Moore, T P , 1 Thomas B Holm, H O Farr J P Flockhart E.
