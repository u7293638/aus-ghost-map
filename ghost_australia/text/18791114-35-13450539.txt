Mr M'ELHONE. in a formal after called attention to the revelations Tde that morning's Sydney Morning Herald in reference to the mines t freedom the children at Randwick Asylum ?£***$ human form, who had not only flogged iheJXeh they (The hon member for East Sydney informed him that this Spain, who did the flogging business, had been discharged, but it was the head master, who gave the orders for the egging that ought to be discharged [Mr O'Connor he whole of them ought to be discharged ] If the Government did their duty they would institute criminal proceedings against Thomas It was no satisfaction to the public to know that public and private money was being appropriated to the support of such a hell upon earth as this institution seemed to be The battle with regard to the packing of Boards was forehead this institution a short time nan and this I d to the retirement of such gentlemen as the Speaker and Sir E Deas Thomson from the institution and the institution was then handed over to a few persons who mismanaged it as they chose It now. absolutely transpired that this Thomas asked one woman not to say that a child 's hand was burst by a flogging, but to say that it was hurt by a fall Thomas was a school teacher at Parramatta and was a perfect fiend a perfect brute and that perhaps was the reason he received his present appointment The hon member for East Sydney devoted a great deal of his time to preparing: the interests of the institution i but it could not be believed that he was cognisant the amount of brutality practised there If he was aware of it and did not till e steps to prevent it 01 if any of the other directors Vvcrcin the same position they were unworthy of the name of directors of that institution or of any other What were the revelations P Kate Ruth i deposed - "Air 1 honors the superintendent, and Mr Goble the male attendant were there I did not wait to see the boys put on the horse and therefore did not see them beaten on that occasion but I have seen them beaten on other occa- Ei us beaten in the room next few bel e we dine, by Mr lh bias with a cane on the hands I could not say how men cuts were given, but I am sure there were over a nVen t? Inch boy I could not say how many times I have seen them beaten on the hands I have seen it so often I had no difficulty with the babies and have not known any of them to behave badly, I remember an occasion when it was said some of the boys had attempted to set the place on fire." It would be no wonder if these tortured children did set the place on fire about Thomas's ears. This put him in mind of one of Mr. Dickens's stories of a school master who fed the children on brimstone and treacle, and forced them to take away their appetites. [Mr. Lucas : Dothe boys' Hills Yes. this was Dotheboys Hall and Dothecirls Hill. He hoped that the Government would check the expenditure in connection with this institution until matters I thPrPhad improved. He was not going to say that the institution could be managed without some properly | organised system for punishing unruly children, but here He had gone beyond rational punishment and punished | children for looking- cross? at their masters I spoke to Goble about beating the boys on the horse, and he said Yes, that is the orders ' ; he asked me if I saw him beat them, and I said No. as I could not bear to look : I saw you there with the canes under your arm : I don't know how you could do it he said he did not think anything about it, that he had been in India or somewhere, and that he was used to it." Perhaps this was why Thomas appointed the man : " Mrs. Ebery, a matron in the institution, told me she saw the marks on the boys, and she said It's dreadful, somebody ought to take this in and report it this occurred on the first Monday in last November ; the mother of one of the boys was not allowed to see him the day that he was beaten, though she called for that purpose; I saw the boys put into the bathroom next to mv bedroom upstairs, and kept there all night without any beds ; it was after 11 o'clock when they were put there; the room is very small, and about twenty-one boys were put in there.'' They had heard of the Black hole of Calcutta, and hero in this hot climate they had something equally monstrous. The man who ordered these children to be flogged ought to be flogged and dismissed. (Cheers.) The hon. member for East Sydney ought to insist upon his dismissal, and the Government would not be doing their duty to the public unless they instituted a criminal prosecution against him Thomas, this damnable tyrant-forhi9 brutal conduct : " A boy named Marshall was put in the defendant's dressing-room and locked up all night; several of the boys have been locked up in the attendant's äinrmr- room all day; they have been locked up three days in that room, and fed on bread and water ; the mines used here I have never seen used in schools ; some of the canes used for beating the boys were trot from the carpenter's shops ? They were not cases, but green, and some of them quince switches to the best of my belief the boys were locked up for running away." No wonder that they ran away, or if they committed suicide, to escape this kind of treatment : - " I have seen canes much thicker than those as thick as two of them-used and broken ; with record to the inspection of the children by the doctor, the infants are stripped only to their waist, and if the children were beaten on the lower part of their bodies the doctor would not know it." There was deep cunning in this. The shoulders, and not the lower parts of the children, were shown. The report went on to say, The bathroom was a small place.'' And Twenty-one children were locked up in it all night. Would it have been any wonder if they had been found dead in the morning, stifled for want of air. A man named Chapple came forward, in response to an advertisement, and lies?. " I have seen a great many cases in which the superintendent has thrashed infants for running over the crass, gives- them a dozen for it. and beating them on the back part of the hands as well as on the front. He wished he had the handling of some of these men. (Cheers.) He would give them such a dozen as would take the skin and hair off. Running over the Trade ! There was a train to Sl'vea child a dozen for. This fiend in human form, Who received a his tee salary for doing nothing, gave a dozen to a boy for running over the grass. Beat them on the back as well as the front part of their hands. Flossed them over their miserable skinny and decrepit hands. Fancy that ! : ("Ihavespen boys in the b bakehouse with their hands swollen and the skin broken, though I did not see them beaten ; I saw one boy receive about, thirty odd raps from the superintendent ; the boy said forty, but I counted thirty This was done in the yard ; I saw a boy named Frank Burrowes benton on a Sunday morning by the superintendent, with a cane all over the ' body ; the boys who were in the bakehouse I saw examined next morning, and they were marked from head to foot ; I have heard thoncrpamsof the boys I called the attention of the Rev. Thomas Wilson, a director of the institution, the circumstance. of two boys having been excessively punished, but I believe he failed to draw attention to." There was a reverend gentleman, who preached goodwill to men and when he was told about this matter, he said nothing about it. because Thomas had got influence at his back 11 Some of the marks on the boys were as thick as your fin remand others about half the thickness ; the skin was broken in three or four places that was about fifteen months ago: I have often seen the superintendent punishing the boys in a most unmerciful manner, but I could not leave the boys' names: the cane has been used across the hands and the back: all certs of boys were punished on the quadrangle one day for skipping with a rope." Here was a nice thing, punishing a child for skipping test in which he ought to be encouraged. (Hear, hear.) The children ran away, and were brought back and punished tenderness, and there was no one to protect, them : "Dr. Nott, medical officer of the institution, stated that he had seen marks of severe punishment on the children when inspecting them ; one boy, Thomas, had been punished very severely, and too much for so your g a boy ; he made a note in his last months report to the effect that the children bore marks of severe punishment : he was in the bit of examining the children once a week, and all the children, except the chiefs. were stripped naked : the girls stripped to the waist only ; during the last six months he had not observed any instance of the skin a tree broken or of blood running, but he thought some of the boys had been too severely punished though he might be Breiiidiccd, for he was against corporal punishment altogether ; he had seen it in the army, and knew that it only degraded and did no good ; the boy Thomas had been beaten on the buttocks and a little lower, but he should take a bunch, and the bruises had come out in boils ; some of the bruises might have been dangerous : they looked very Driver indeed, and if the skin had been broken he would have sent the boy to the hospital : there was a slight running or discharged; with the exception of what he mentioned in his report, he did not know of any cases of severity; if a boy were beaten severely the hands it would probably be two or three days before the hands would become black or blue ; but the hands of some children might show it in ten minutes ; several of the boys were often absent from inspection ; he had been told state of the times that no" l">"t,-m in the yaiiHinchor e " They had heard something the other night about the scavengers daughter ' He would advise the directors to none for horses It; would be better to kill the ' midden at once than to keep them under continual torture earth's Machin formerly an attendant in the institution, 'In that the union had iron ».tllp'ltll)lt of beating; the Um iron on end moments after they had been scrubbing latter the children on a cold morning scrubbing (the floor, and then being floated across the little hands' Mix well a sub matron and Protestant delicious instructress hotel that on the occasion when the boys wpiobioncht Dick after having run away, they vi ore in the place called me cells two nights without holding " If a murderer were put in the cells at Darlinghurst he would be given a bed man burnt Pt- (oheersl-and in it occurred that of prisoner It was at Paris that if it given a blanket and bed we Men hear about it ever v when a (Cheek so It was hardly conclude that in a de nil Christian country like this we Son also brutality was quiet on Ah then, T attendant, stated that He boys had been beaten in t, s s"' in other o!iGri<m than picking rt t bmnM Hille was a came to commit' fair Lives And one broth I made to hold the other well enough to brutalise the boys to make any of them Skibo others (Cheers ).

Here was this brute Thomas, taking the instrument or torture out of the Iran's hand, and flogging the boy till he dropped on the floor if he (Mr M'Elhone) were the member for East Sydney (Mr Davies) he would resign his position of director, for he would be ashamed to be connected with such a damnable institution as this He failed to see any honour in the portion, and he did see the degradation The witness Mrs Ebery said she was willing to give her evidence in a Court of Justice Did the Colonial Secretary want anything more than this to justify him in instituting criminal proceedings ? As the head of the department under which this institution was assisted it was his duty to send instructions to the Inspector General of Police to prosecute those scoundrels at once, and not to trust to the tender mercy of those drive is who had allowed this thing to Room year after year, shutting their eyes or winking at it " One boy had a terribly sore finger, which it was painful to see and this was caused by the cane the boy said so and Goble did not deny it, I took the boy down to Mr Thomas and the mutton, and showed them the finger I the boy was in terrible pain, and I got some warm water for the finger ; Mr. Thomas said to me, "Don't say it was done by the cane. Mis Ebory, it might cost the man he j situation," and Mrs Thomas who came there, said That is not a cut from the case, it is a stone bruise Here was Mr Thomas trying to make this woman, who had a feeling bear to say it was not the case in order that them in might be screened from the consequences of his monstrosity and allowed to go on perpetrating his injustice The (Mr M'Elhone) wondered that some of the children had not committed suicide, and if any of them bud, you should have found some of the directors trying to set court rnthorthan bring it to the light of day It appeared that Goble was in the habit of flogging the children every night when they went to bed and on one occasion he waited until a boy had said his prayers, and then beat him The attendant interfered, and Air Thomas was brought, and Mr Thomas said, " AV but d science is it that he has bind his prayer ' And this WTCt h would go to church on a Sunday, and take his bible or prayerbook, as the case might be, in his hand and pray to his God' But this sanctity was only put on for the occasion, and he (Mr Al Llhone) supposed his sanctity was suited whom he got his situation Shame on any men whether a member of the Church of England, of the Church of Bo up, 01 of any other Church, to try and prevent this poor woman from swing these poor unfortunate children from being flogged Ivy Henty -two boys were confined in the bath-room, then brought down to watch the other boys eating their breakfast and afterwards marched back again to get a little bread and water Sometimes, the report said this bread and water had been forgotten and sometimes the attendant, Mrs Ebery, had been told " not to put the party j bit of treacle on their bread " " Cross examined the witness said she considered the conduct of Mr Thomas towards the boys disgraceful , she had heard him repeatedly say to the male attendant 'Give it him harder you are not giving it to him half hard enough give it him, don't spare him He e was a nice man put in by the influence of the hon. member, Mr John Davies Mr J Davies so'] IL had no doubt the Colonial Secretary would do his duty, but he would not do his duty so as to satisfy him (Mr M ElhjnpJ and the country unless he took the matter in hand and had Air Thomas and Goble treated as, the other man was treated-do their three years in Darlinghurst gaol and he wished the law would allow them to be flogged If it would, he would stand by and say, "Give it him harder," though he should see him drop dead it the triangles From the evidence of Goble, it appeared that the superintendent was responsible for the punishment inflicted Both Goble and the superintendent denied that the children had been excessively punished but he (Mr M'Elhone) believed that every word this All Thomas had stated was a deliberate lie to screen himself. He thought there was enough evidence there to testify the Colonial Secretary in immediately having this man at rest d on a criminal prosecution Some time ago a man, whose name he forgot was imprisoned for three years to less than this [Mr J Davies And it was all proved untrue afterwards J Perhaps the hon member did not believe this Mr J Davies Nor do I] He did not believe there was any other hon member in the House who did not believe it. He was surprised at the hon member Did he supposed those waiting ses had perjured thoms West A\ by it was against their interest to give this testimony This woman Lborv would be a marked worn in for life There was another matter he wished to draw attention to Mr. James York informed him that v Hesford ty, when he got to the Blue Mountain station, the guard was so humbled unk that he could not move about This was a very serious matter We had only the guard and the driver of the train to protect people and Government pie party It the Minister got drunk in his office his might not do any harm, but if a eli river or a guard got drunk they ought to be dismissed at once the Minister ought to give instructions that all the guards and eli rivers of trains should be teetotallers [Air J Davies Hear, hear ] Another matter he had to complain of was that, as he was informed by the Rev. Canon White, the public at Murrurundi and Muswellbrook have to purchase a site times ticket from the Government if they take an exclusion ticl pc to come down to the Exhibition He thought it was ron, that the Government should at t as agent to a steam company and the Minister for Works ought to put a stop to it at once Sir HENRY PARKES thoroughly believed the hon. member was convinced he was serving the public in bringing this matter before the House, but he ventured to state his conviction that the course the hon. member had taken would very much emba russ inquiry. and prevent arriving at the exact facts His attention was called to the running away of twenty or twenty-five children from the Randwick Asv him, and that they had been taken back by the police, and that they had received personal chastisement in the Asylum by an anonymous letter signed "Spy ' He had made it a rule ever since he had had public responsibility to treat anonymous letters in this manner If they made general charges he destroyed them if they made specific chai eyes which he could test he immedi italy has 1 tuted proceedings to see it they were true or not At this anonymous letter made specific charges of 'ill-treatment he took steps to ascertain from whom the letter came, and he obtained evade ice which satisfied him that it was written by one of the boys in the asylum He immediately instructed the Inspector of Charities to proceed to the asylum and hold a particular and careful investigation into all the circumstances, and in conducting that investigation the whole of those children who had run away were stripped naked He was bound to say that the report he had received did not bear out the extreme statements made that day [Mr J Dav its Hear, hear.] He caused inquiry to be made of the police who took these children back, and he gave a special direction that they should report to him the complaints of the children, and the state they were found in, and every other fact they could give him And it was while he was engaged in this inquiry that these extreme statements were made in this unauthorised manner It would be far better test lure of rue at the truth, and not prejudice the case by these statements The hon. member had made several random statements which showed how careful they ought to be in receiving his other asset lions He stated, for instance, that this man Thomas had been a Public school teacher The fact was he never was a Public school teacher , he was a teacher in a Denominational school (Cheers and laughter.) Then again the hon member spoke of of the servants in the Asylum as Government officials Theyvvpio noth ing of the kind The Government had no power either in appointing or removing them Some other statements of the hon. member were equally inaccurate Further, it was very noticeable that the hon. member, in reading this evidence, gave the most implicit credence to all the evidence which asserted cruelty, and discredited all the evidence which many say they ed the contrary A case of this kind was bad enough, look at it how you would and nisi in proportion as the conduct of the persons in charge had been culpable, we ought not to exaggerate their faults Avro ought to conduct an inquiry with the greatest care not to extenuate nor to exaggerate The hon member said he felt certain he would do what he believed to be his du in the matter. He might say there were circumstances in his life which would certainly make him nine to any cruelty to children He was disposed to ascertain in the most careful manner the exact facts, and if there were For vants of the institution who have acted in the way alleged one thing he would pledge his word should be done-that not a pi any of public money should be paid to that institution so long as those servants were in its service (Cheer a ) In any case he should conduct the inquiry to a conclusion, and immediately it was finished he should place the papers before the House (Hear, hear) Until this was done he hoped the House was satisfied that every step would be taken to see that no harsh treatment more than "a" note the W npppasnrv tens exercised America than I friendless children (Hear, hear.) Mr. J DAv IBS, while sympathising with the hon member in bringing this matter for ward, thought he would have been far wiser to have left the matter until this inquiry was complete It was unfair to those concerned that the inquiry that was onlypmtly heard and not hull dealt with should be brought up and dealt with in this way Evprvotncor in the institution, from the lowest servant to the medical officer had to make a report in writing to the House Committee every week It was the duty of the officers to report any marks of violence on the children and it was the duty of the medical officer who was entirely independent of the superintendent to report tuwntingto the House Committee every week on the condition of the children It there was the amount of energy that had been alleged by some of those persons in -giving their evidence, it would have been the duty of the medical officer to give particulars of the names appearing on the persons of the children and it would have been the duty of the nation and sub million to furnish similar reports li was a strange thing that the persons who had given the evidence quoted by the hon member had not done their duty in the past and reported the misconduct But who were the I accuser s 9 A man named Chapple who was dismissed the in- stitution for conduct which was disgraceful in the extreme, a man who had brutally injured a boy, and had been reprimanded by the Board, and who had circulated through the institution indecent publications This man had been dis | missed because his example was thought to be of a de- | moralising character. He had been nine months out of the institution, but while employed there he had never made a single complaint He thought members should regard evidence of this class with very great suspicion Then other persons were brought forward who had said nothing but they were discharged, and who accordingly had not then done their duty Another accuser was a man who was allowed to resign, a man who had been robbing the stores but who had been detected He said he had been proved not guilty, but that was not the fact He was speaking of what he knew, and the fact was the man was allowed to resign Mr Chapple now got his living by selling indecent publications through the city He did not belie p that such a state of things could, or did exist at Randwick, but if it did exist, the man who was to blame in his opinion was Dr Nott, the medical officer, a man who was independent of all his subordinates, and who was paid £300 a-year for visiting the institution In no single instance had he over reported that The children suffered from marks of violence If such a report had come before the House Committee, he would have insisted upon a searching inquiry being made. The birch which was referred to, was a few twigs with which they were beaten over the buttocks This was not a very few "re punishment and he would be one of the last to but a hint of a child s head. He had been alarmed and distressed when he read the paper and heard the expressions which the hon. member had used in reference to the institution, but he hoped hon. members would not be so unjust as to condemn the in agement and Mr Thomas, until they had the full report before them, and until they knew the character of the man who had had the charges The remarks of the Colonial Secretary went to prove that there was very little truth in the st interments made If it were found that All Thomas was guilty of one-tenth part of the cruelty that was disclosed in the paper, the hon. member would And that his vote would be wente display Air Thomas and every other servant of the institute n guilty of such conduct (Hear, hear.) He thought it was due to Mr Thomas to say that he believed him to be one of the West have the men in the community Mr Ihomisnovor was connected with the late Air May, and it he were he did not know the if that would be any disqualification He would not change their opinion of Mr Thomas until it was proved that he was wrong The evidence of the people connected with the institution entirely contradicted that of those who who had been discharged d Mr LUCAS hoped that the Colonial Secretary would not be outfit with taking the evidence of any officials, and especially that of the Inspector of Charities, because if the so gross cases of tyranny had taken place in the institution without his reporting them, he had not performed his duty and it was not to be expected that that "gentleman would now report against him self It app "red to him, trout the evidence before them, that the authorities of the institution had not done their duty In his opinion the duty of directors of such an institution was not merely to ride out and sit in a room for half an hour hearing the reports of the officials, without making some further enquiry in order to satisfy themselves that these reports were fine (Hear, hear) Who could possibly say how the reports came up 3 The whole of the servants of the institution, from the wardens to the man a ger, iv ei e reporting upon the user es, and it was only when the officers were at cross purposes that the public were likely to find out the true state of affairs If it were true that one of the persons making the charges had been guilty of robbing the institution, it appeared to him that the directors had not done their duty when they allowed him to i resign He certainly ought to have had a charge preferred against him in the Courts of the colony He could not understand how any one could have brought such chances as wore before them unless there was actually some truth in it He would have to be very well satisfied there was not a p article or truth in the statements made in the paper before he would support the vote for the institution, when the Ls mates were before them and he would not be satisfied w ash any report that was brought up by the officials Dr BOWKER thought that the philanthropy of some hon. members was running to an extreme limit Care should be taken not to run down officials unless they deserved it, because otherwise how could children be kept in order Corporal punishment, in a proper degree, not carried to excess, was the best punishment for children, and the person who did not believe in it was not fit to have the management of children. The hon member for the Upper Hunter, with the best intentions no doubt, had gone to i extremes in this matter The evidence of the medical officer of the institution, in whom he had complete confidence, was to the effect that no now in ran table punishment had been inflicted Dr Nott was in a good position to judge of the nature of the punishment, and it those in. 1 been any wrong inflicted, that gen them in would have been the first to make a stir about it, for he was opposed to corporal punishment Dr Nott's evidence did not disclose anything of a frightful character, and it was to be hoped that the officials would not be censured without a full inquiry into then conduct He would mention one subject which he hoped would excite the sympathetic feelings of philanthropists It was that of a young man named Craddock, who had been employed at Randwick, and had caught granular opthalmia from the children there, so I idly, that he went totally blind Having become blind while in the performance of his duty, he was really deser your of recommence from the State Mr O'CONNOR said that there had never been a ques him before the House, so worthy of consideration as this and that the Gov- eminent should have instituted inspections of all the charitable institutions in the country Last session he drew attention to the necessity for doing this, and introduced a motion to the effect that it should be done He was justified in taking such a course by the authority of a Mr Robinson, who said that this institution, instead of being the handmaid of civilization, was one of the means of filling: the gaols Theron member for Newcastle could not have lead the evidence thoroughly or he would have seen that some of the children perhaps those punished the w first-hand been put aside from the inspection of the doctor It is proved a b mering dam such as the hon member for the opportunity to come down and burst in the doors of the Government, and open up this spectacle to the country Dr Bowker said none of the children were killed What did the hon. member mean-' Was it necessary that a child should be slaughtered before the people should raise their voices-' There was confirmatory evidence to-day in the case tried before the Police Court, and that evidence could not be contradicted the grossest mismanagement had characterised this institution since those men who, while occupying seats on the Board had properly attended to their duties, and to give way to the manikins who succeeded them, and here was the result of the latter's administration He hoped the Colonial Secretary would follow up his work, and we should then be able to get rid of that which had degraded uni neutralized the beneficial effects of those grand institutions Mr ROSEBY was sure the House and the country would give the gentleman who introduced this matter to the House credit for the very best of motives, but he was surprised that the hon gentleman should be so precipitate in his i conclusions before the subject had been finally investigated, and the report given to the country Certainly, if any thing like the cruelties spoken of by the witnesses had been perpetrated, those in charge of the institution ought to be there no longer, for such barbarities were a disgrace to the colony, or to any Christian country. The directors were men of high moral character who he was sure would not tolerate for a moment such treatment as that reported if they were aware of its existence, and it would be we age to wait until the matter was thoroughly investigated before arriving at any decision upon it Mr M'ELHONE, in reply, said he could hardly think it possible that anybody would make the statements published in their port of the inquiry if they we e nothing, and if only a portion of the evidence was true it was quite certain that Mr Thomas was not a by manton his present position The motion for adjournment was negatived PETITION Mr M McINTOSH presented a petition from JohnBiiu' of the police force, praying for the return of thousands li had paid into the Superannuation Fund The petition was received ROMAN CATHOLIC SCHOOL LAND SALE BILL Mr FARNELL moved,-"1 That the St Leonards Roman Catholic School Land Sale Bill be referred to a Select Committee for consideration and report 2 that such committee consist of Mr Jacob, Mr Bums, Mr Dry, Mr R Cameron, Mr leirv,Mi Tee u Mr Keir, Mr J Davies, I M Thompson, and the mover " Agiecdto LAND BILL Ali SU 1 FOR moved that the report be adopted Mr M'ELHONE moved that the hill be recommitted for the consideration of five now clauses, of which he had given notice One of these clauses involved a very important principle, and he thought it ought to be discussed, although he did not expect to carry it Its object was to confine selection to certain specified districts This clause would prevent persons from taking up land for the purpose merely of levying black mail upon the lessee of Crown lands as had been done in too many instances Persons had made dams to conserve water, and this p ii tion of their runs had been selected, so that they had born compelled to pay large sums to buy the selectors out It was bad policy to leave of tho whole of the country open to free selection, whether it was fit for it or not. It was a bad and un- natural law If Sir John Hay's ideas had been carried out in Sir John Robertson's land 1 ivy, it would have been the salvation of the country. The free selectors would have been in a much better position than they are in now If people had been compelled to settle down in definite areas, they would have been a protection to one another, and they could have had their churches and schools and manufactories , they would then have been a benefit to the State and to themselves Sir John Robertson s law had led a number of people, not only to their own ruin, but to the sum of their children, and all they held most sacred It would have been better for those people it they had never had the chance of taking up land at all, so long as they could have educated their children, instead of bringing them up in ignorance of the most gross character, it was too of ten the case they were brought up to look upon sheep and cattle stealing not as a crime, they thought they were doing no injury by it at all Some people thought he had taken an extreme view of the position of selectors, but there was no man who felt more for the bona-fide selectors than he did Insto id of Sir John Robertson's land law settling an industrious class on the land, in too many cases these bona-fide sale tors had been driven off by the large lessees under the Crown As a rule where the Crown lessee had had a un for many years he had come in possession of the land either by purchasing it or by having it transferred to him at the end of twelve months There was very little land, sold in some districts in the colony, and hence it would be desirable to amalgamate their law to that of South Australia by grant- ing leases for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years He had enunciated these views before the selectors of the colony and had generally found the selectors agree with him 1 Mr COONAN thought the present time was on in opportune one for a Land Bill to be introduced, as the Electoral Bill should have been brought in first, in order that the whole rr- 2 3 constituencies might be represented, and the representatives he present to discuss the matter, a matter of the greatest interest to the whole colony. In his district there were both squatters and selectors, and it was impossible for any one member to represent in a proper manner the views of all his constituents upon this subject. He thought the Government, seeing the state a similar measurement with the previous session, would have acted in a much wiser manner if they had brought in the Electoral Bill before introducing this one. He hoped, however, as the measure had been introduced that it would be carried and not dealt with as it had been last year. No one who had studied the question could doubt that the cursed system of allowing any one to go over any of the waste lands of the Crown, take up any part of a run, and transfer it at the expiration of twelve months, was a bad one. In his opinion the lessee should be allowed to hold his land for a certain time, and not be liable to have the country taken away as it was at present Now it was a fact that people made a regular business of levying black mail upon the squatters, ow mer to the existing system. He would advocate the separation of the land into two divisions -nnopmtfo be for the squatters, and the other for the iigricutrmists. If this were effected, it would, he thought, be one of the best things first had ever been done for the colony. He did not admire the tyrannical acts of many of the squatters of New South Wales. but if such a system as was advocated by the hon, member for the Upper Hunter and himself were adopted, these would be done away with. So far as the Land Act at present was concerned, the greatest maladministration lay in the Land Office itself, owing to the reserves berne shifted all over the runs. They had had runs completely revered with these reserves placed there simply in order to defeat the bona-fide selector. As the bill was before the. he would feel it to be his bounden duty to support the third reading, although he objected to the continual patching up of such a measure. He thought that this was scarcely the period at which to ask for the recommittal of the bill, although he concurred in the views of the hon. member for the Upper Hunter in the matter. In his district many persons had taken up large quantities of land on the presumption that the value of the improvements would be reduced to 10s. an acre, and if the bill was defeated it would entail very great hardship on them. He hoped that the hon. member would not further retard the progress of the bill, which, it was to he desired, would be speedily transmitted to the other Chamber, and agreed to there. The question that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question was put, and the House divided with the following result : AVE, 29.

Mr. GARRETT, without notice, asked the Minister for Works whether the Government proposed to erect a court- house on a railway reserve at Moss Vale. Mr. LACKEY replied that the question was occupying the attention of the Government, that the Minister for Justice and Instruction was about having a court-house erected, and that the Works Department were considering whether arrangements could be made to dispose of certain lands not required for railway purposes on which a court- house might be placed. CHURCH AND SCHOOL LANDS. Resumption of the adjourned debate on the motion of Mr. Buchanan,-"1. That in the opinion of this House no moneys derivable in any way from the Church and School Lands shall be paid to any religious sect whatever. 2. That the above resolution be communicated by- address to his Excellency the Governor." Upon w his is Mr. Garrett had moved,-" That the question be amended by the omission of all the words after the word " house " in paragraph I, with a view to the insertion in their place of the words, "a bill to decline the lands known as the Church and School estates to be Crown Lands, and to deal with the funds derived from these lands, should be brought in by the Government as soon as practicable, and that pending the settlement of this question the funds in hand and the proceeds thereof, and of the said lands, should be impounded by the Crown " Sir HENRY PARKES said that he w as the day of 011 nion that this question being raised should if possible be settled He would as briefly as possible so its how the case stood although in doing so he must nctpssTilv go over ground which had been traversed already they all knew, having heard or it so very often, that certain not done on the territory of New South Wales was set apart by vin in that ter for purposes of religion and the era ation of youth in that chair for there were no words which devoted the land to any particular Church but inasmuch as there was only one Church in the colony at the time the Church of Eng- land-the lands were held for the benefit of that Church In the year 1838 this charter was dissolved by a provision which it contained and in the year ISO I the Gov moment then in power the Government of the late Sir Charles Cow pre-determined that these lands should be sold and the interest, and he believed the rout should be distributed between the four Churches recognised by the charter This went on until he thought, the year 1864 But in the same year that this was done, a motion was made in this House declaring these lands to be Crown lands, and this motion was carried by 22 to 11 As subsequent motion was made when it was discovered what the Cowper Administration was doing in gradually selling the lands and dividing the rent and interest among the four Churches, and this motion, he thought, was defeated by one vote In consequence of all this Sir John Young who was Governor at the time remitted the case to the Socie- tal v of State the Dul p of Newcastle, and thereupon the opinion of the Crown Law Officers of England was taken, the Crown Law Officers being the present Lord Melbourne Sirrtounelell Palmer (who was then Solicit >r-General) mail Sir William Atherton, who was Attorney-General Though a passage from this opinion had been road before, he must again read it to complete his statement of his ease the Crown Law Officers of England said : " We think that it is competent for the Governor, without any risk (if authorised by the Home Gov ommont so to do to impound the annual receipts of these lands and to stay the issue of further leases of grants until the question may be settled by an Act of the Legislature or by a legal decision " Then in a subsequent part -" If on the other hand he should treat them as waste lands and apply their proceeds to general public purposes. it is posblo shall, by information in the Colonial Court of Equity such a misappropriation might be corrected" The Duke of Newcastle, in trans million this opinion of the law advisers of the Crow n to Sir John Young, used this method local kable and certainly in a nhfied passage -" I think that the general management of those lands, and the appropriation of the proceeds arising t our their disposal, are matters which may properly be dealt with by the local Legislature Nor do Iroquimvou to 10301 for the signification of her Majesty s pleasure any Act which may be passed for those purposes, if only due respect is paid to the interests of individuals Unless this is done, the Crown, wine li is still in use of those Land entrant in hanning rp1 animals its trust- ' It seemed to him perfectly clear that this reference to the Secret try of State and the reply left it open for this Legislature to deal with these lands (Hear, hear ) But the Government of the day submitted a case to the Supreme Court in accordance with one portion of the opinion of the Attorney General and the Solicitor Generals England and the S ipi erne Court gave judgment, on the 3rd October, 1861 to the following else He was going to lead the conclusion of the opinion of the then Chief Justice Sir Alfred Stephen It was in these words "Inn of opinion that the Church and School Lands always have been, and still are holden in trust in the maintenance and promotion of religion and the education of youth in this colony, that the Crown is, at this moment a trustee of the lands for those purposes, and that it is a trust the tXPcution of which in the case of a private individual, could be enforced against that individual (How, near ). The other two Judges the late Mr Justice Milford and Mr Justice Wise substantially agreed in that judgment of the Supreme Court or to that effect Sir James Martin was in office at that time, as Attorney General and Premier, and he prepared an appeal is to the Privy Council against this decision of the Supreme Court The despatch from the Governor of this colony informing the home Government that his advisers intended to appeal against this decision or rather the intention to submit the e also far the decision of the Supreme Court wistrinsmittod to the Home Government and acknowledged by the following despatch from Mr Secret u v Caldwell - "I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No 66, of the 21st of November, reporting that your responsible advisers had decided upon submitting special case for the opinion of the Supreme Court as to the Church and School lands and enclosing a copy of the judgment delivered on the 3rd of October I have the honour to be Sir your obedient humble servant, Edvvaud Caud avail " After this it was determined to appear against this judgment But early in 1866 Sir James Martin's Government went out of order, and the late Sir Charles Cowper again assuming the Government of the country, the case of appeal to the Privy Council which was then in the course of preparation, was stayed by the incoming Government and the system of dividing the proceeds or income from those Church and School lands amongst the four denominations had gone on from that time to this flia sevenths of the money being devoted to religion and two sevenths to education Still it appeared to him that it was left for the Parliament of this country to take what course it chose (cheers), notwithstanding this decision of the Supreme Court (hear, hear), and as the subject had been brought forward now and must be determined in some way or other, he intended asking the House to determine it somewhat differently from what was proposed by the original resolution, or by the amendment of the hon. member for Camden He intended asking the House to negative the amendment of the hon member for Camden, and to substitute another which would got aside and Mortmain what remained of these lands to the purposes of public education (Cheers ) The amendment which he asked the House to adopt would be to this effect,-" That a bill should be brought in by the Government is soon as practicable, to declare the lands known as Church and School Estates to be Crown lands, and to set aside and dedicate such lands, and the funds derived therefrom, for the purposes of public education and that, pending the settlement of the question, the accumulated funds now in hand should be impounded by the Crown and no further steps taken to sell or lease the said lands and that from and after the 31st December, 1840, the revenue derived either as rider ->st or rent for in the said mds and the accumulated funds derived therefrom, should cease to he applied to mv purpose other than the of public education " electing of this would be to allow the child the son of the inns of the accumulated funds to go on as hitherto to the end of next year He knew that the Churches having looked upon this as part of their income, merit in many cases, or in some at least, have entered into contracts, calculating upon a division of this income to meet their engagements to avoid any possibility of any breach of faith where such contracts had been made he proposed that the sy sto ii e f distribution of the fruits of these occurred ted funds should go on till the end of next year, and if in that time the 1 mds and the accumulated sands, and the interest therefrom should be wholly set apart and dedicated for the purpose es of public education (Hear, hear ) By a return from the J Treasury the amount of money now in hand appeared to be £181 196 11s 3d This consisted of £1) 800 invested in o percent debentures £)2o00 invested in 4 per cent debentures and £10t)79il9s id invested in a per cent. funded stock, le iv ing the sum of £9011 12s id available for invest- ment at the present moment, so that the total sum now in hand I was £181,190 lia 81 It was perhaps desirable to see what these lands originally consisted of and what they I consisted of new Originally these lands gave a total of 130 217 acres 1 he area which had been soil at different times was 1 oO 309 acres Wv mg the present estate of Church and School lands 279 318 acres The lands now left were described thus 160 119 acres of alluvial find, I oG Gio acres of pastoral lands of the first class 179 176 ures of pastoral lands of the second class and 2 i 817 acres of poor land, So that it would be seen that the lands now left-hand which, it the House agreed with him, would be set apart as a permanent fund for education purposes would contain 279,8 acres of very good land A portion of this kind in the county of Cumberland was, he believed, entirely fitted for v Ila sites, and must be of considerable value indeed He would ask the House to substitute his amendment for that of the hon member, so that the land might be dealt with in the way he proposed Mr riTZ PATRICK s d that of the several proposals now before the House, he would give preference to the proposal of the honor ible the Premier Notwithstanding the argument of the hon and learned member who moved the original resolution, of that portion of his argument which asserted that there was no tius' heaped hardly say that a resolution of this House would not determine the fact whether there was or was not a man and the case had been referred to two sets of Crown law officers in England, both of whom she named the opinion given in this colony that the trust still exist d He for one believed, therefore, on a huge preponderance of legal opinion, that there was a trust Then came the question What was the character of that past of the history of the case given by the Premier was not as far as it went, but there were some other facts that ought to be taken into consideration when dealing with this question the charts existed for a very short time The same authority thitt.rmted it repealed it The charter then given contempt ited only the p emotion in this colony of the Church of England (Hear hear) The amended charter did nothing more specific than to devote these lands as a trust for the promotion of religion and education At that peru d of the colony's history, the repealing instru- ment could have contempt and, nothing in religion but the Chur li of Ireland to that extent, he is lloyd his hon friend Mr Stuart would be with him that, taking the thing literally what was contemplated b 5th in the charter and the i ere using instrument was the religion of the Church, of I i gland This Blcuvnan If there was one Scotchman in the country that was nullified ] The next feature in the history of those isa had no connection with even one bcotcQium He thought the credit was due to an Irishman (Sir Richard Bourke), then Governor of the colony evacuated a bill to be brought into the old Lejisl native Council was high or chiefly disposed of this monopoly of religion und recognised four religions as having claims to State-aid To his mind the character of the interests at stake in this question was qualified by the Act of Sir Richard Bourke, which recognises four great communions of this colony, and put them on the same footing in proportion to population. It was true that the four com- munions did not include the whole of the religious in the colony, but it missed the idea that the Church of England was the only religion and it took in nine tenths of the whole of the community The next feature was the Constitution Act of the colony passed in 1892 he believed to at vnt mi in the ma ma sion for the religious teaching of the whole of the colony It must be admitted that the schedule of the Constitution Act made or professed to make provision for the sustentation of religion nthiscdoij That again altered the nature and the character of the trust Another feature that they were bound to recognise was Sir Charles, Cowper's Act of 1862, is in King State-aid to religion He should be tempted to dwell upon this question at great length, for among other reasons there recently appeared in a newspaper which pro- to see to be a statement of this case, not one statement of which was accurate It was inaccurate from beginning to end and a writer of considerable ability in the Hall and had thrown in some other arguments more than had been alluded to there As an at about slum ad absurdum, he had presided that the colonies of Queensland and Victoria had s made indefinite rights in these Church and School lands if the trust still existed His answer to that was simply that no portion of Queensland or Victoria was ever selected as Church mel School Innes The selections never proceeded far beyond the old settled districts of New South AVuIps He argued the thing in this way that the money s proceeding from the e church and school lands were moneys to be devoted to the religions of all kinds and education of all kinds conducted by the State He thought with the Premier it was time that this matter was set at rest, and he thought the legitimate mode was to declare these lands waste lands of the Crown But he thought that, in making this declaration, we were bound to do a thing that was very arguable We were trenching very closely upon a breach of a trust What we ought to do was to recognise the previous legislation in this country, and the temper in which it was conducted He meant the Act of 1862, which abolished State aid to her son, and we should treat these It ends in precisely the same way as the money under the shed iles was treated, that is, subject to all vested rights which could be shown to have events He believed that much of the five-sevenths given to the religious communions was devoted to the in unten mee in certain cases-, of clergymen [SirIlF\'t\ Pakkls to building churches 1 He thought if we wore a > legislate in this matter, we should place it on the same consigns the i replaced the s hereto for public worship He believed the w hen ever a clergy man was endowed under the oil schedule his allowance was separe to him so long as he lived, and when he died the allowance died out too That was the temper in which we should deal with the Church and school lands AYheicver a stipend was promi- ed, that stipend ought n be maintained lining the life of the clergy man, and no longer [Sir HrMtA PviKEd I do not think there are any fresh cases] If there were not, then there was an end to his argument [AL ShE used AA'ho made such promises rj The heads of the Churches to whom the money was legally distributed If an incumbency has- been created on the strength of a promise of the money, that incumbency ought to be preserved during the life time of that incumbent, and no longer He desired that he should keep good faith as we did in 1892 M AVEBB thought the ground taken up by Mr Fitzpatrick n po clear one and the hon. member would have a great difficulty in proving his case nearly the whole of this money received by quo Church had been devoted to making up the stipends of clergymen residing in remote districts of the country Surely the hon. member would not say that the clergymen in such localities had any claim upon this fund merely be cause the Church distributed the mine i list as it liked If this thing was to be tolerated, we should have no end of difficulty in settling this matter Si in the Act to an oil h State aid it would have been per f ctly illegal for the Government to supplement the amount given to any particular individual No claim of that sort ther of 10 could possibly cause It seemed to him that the Chief Secretary had made a clear and fur ht moment of the facts, but he thought it would be much better to deal with this question in the way suggested by Mr Gullett He could not see what necessity there was for making a second ate and distinct fund in this matter Why not appro pi late the moneys at once as part and parcel of the consoli- dated revenue and make the lands at once waste lands of the colony If we were to have a separate trust, it would entail a large amount of expense The Minister for Lands had pointed out an e bretton with regard to conditional pur- causes but there would be no difficulty in reserving those lands from conditional purchase The proposal of the present Government was that they should take charge of a system of Public Education, therefore what necessity was there to place this money in trust for the purpose of public education It would entail unnecessary trouble and expense in keeping these are hints separate There might be other minor difficulties, but they would be easily got over by a Km ill clause II of- nam 1 not D - - u J . lb 2 JIUIH would be to play on these lands from being free selected him, as i eg yarded those people who had highly improved them, it would only be just to allow them something for then improvements He knew there were some very peculiar cases, in addition to which he had every reason to believe that in some instances extensive mines had been developed upon these School lands, under the case of those who had spent tons of thousands of pounds upon those lands, there could be no doubt that their interests would have to be protected It a separate Bill were brought in to place these lands in trust they would have to deal with all these questions, and have a fund to keep the money a all separate if it were necessary to make any regulation for the sale of these lands he considered the best plan would be to make them part and parcel of the Crown lands, so that this funds die i word from the sale would go into the general revenue He would certainly vote for the amendment of Mr Garret, and he could not see why the Ministry should object to it, as it would not trammel the Government in any way Mr O'CONNOR thought it would be desirable to have a slight postponement of the debate and he had no doubt the hon and learned member would consent to it [Mr BuenVN\N No tem we'll decide to-night] It was a subject of the greatest importance and had come before the House that evening rather unexpectedly He thought it would only be in to the House and the country that a matter of such moment and importance should not be decided in the absence of several hon. members who took an interest in the subject, and he therefore hoped the hon. member would consent to the adjournment of the debate, which he now moved ¡ Mr. JACOB thought it quite unreasonable to ask for an adjournment? and is the evening was early, he hoped the House would not consent to it. He thought the amendment of Mr. Garrett was the better of the two. He preferred it by far to the amendment of the Premier, and would vote for it, reserving to himself the night, when the bill was before the House, to take into consideration the position taken by Mr 1 Fitzpatrick He thought the stipends of those interested in the matter should be reserved to them. When they voted a large sum of money for educational purposes it was by far the simplest way to let the Church and Schools lands revert to the Crown. It would compli- city the matter if they were by bill to devote these lands to educational purposes. Mr COPELAND would also vote for the amendment of Mr. Garrett, because the Government were simply prolong- ing the ghost of a trust, if the trust itself had gone the way of all flesh, and he failed to see any good that could come of such a proposal, as if it vi pre adopted all the departments would be burdened by separate accounts For instance, the land at Botany, in all probability, contained coal, and would be let at a loyalty of sixpence per ton, and separate accounts would have to be kept for that, where other portions would be leased and sown, rendering separate accounts in all these departments necessary He could see no earthly reason why such should be the case, seeing that the State provided, 01 intended to provide the whole of the land, for education If the Government had intended to propose a system of education by which the State would only provide a portion of the funds, then he could understand the advisableness of continuing this shadow of a j trust. Mr SHEPHERD also would vote for the amendment of Mr. Garrett, because it would not decide the question, and laid down no principle. The amendment of the Premier seemed however, to continue the difficulty, and tended to perpetuate a wrong which Mr. Garrett's amendment would not perpetuate. It simply said, To di ade the matter let us retain the funds '' If they earned it they would not be deciding any vital question as to whether there was a trust or not, but would simply retain the monPv s in trust for the parties entitled to it. by Mr MACINTOSH said that the amendment of the 1 Premier directed that a bill should be prepared, and by adopting it they would give the Government some information as to what the Parliament winted, while, by accepting I Mr Garrett s they would leave the whole question in a very indefinite position, and that proposition was too abrupt altogether Mr WISDOM said that the Premier had opposed the amendment of Mr Garrett on the ground that it was indefinite, while that which he had proposed himself was of a definite character It Mr Garrett's amendment were carried, it would be quite consistent for the Government to introduce a bill to continue the trust W.hereas if Sir Henry Parken' amendment were adopt ed, the Government would have to bring in a bill to devote the proceeds of the lands to education alone He quite agreed with Mr Fitzpatrick in the general view he had taken that if there were any vested interests which would be affected they should be respected, but he thought he would he able to show that there were no such interest This was not a trust for any particular sect ei spots but for the benefit of the whole of the people of the colony The persons beneficially interested in the trust were the whole of the people of the colony, and no in use ce could be done to any one by the people ch urging the law in the case -tion of the aboli- tion of State-aid to religion it was quite different because there certain people had a day or interest, but in this case, if there were my persons whose stipends had existed owing to the time, they had not been brought into existence by the Government, but by the u clesiastical authorities [ in his engineer " They have been recognised by the Government "j Yes, that was correct, but only annually The money was voted for a year, but beyond this year they had no right whatever If Parliament decided that this distribution must be discontinued it would be quite justified in doing so because this was a trust for the whole of the people of the colony It would be committing no by car hot faith in adopting such a course It would be doing what was done in other colonies, and now that they were about to provide for primary education, Grammar schools, and high class schools for girls, they would want additional lands for them It would be absurd to make these lands the waste lands of the Crown because they had an exceptional value Mr FITZPATRICK said that as even hon. gentleman knew the position of Ali Stuart with regard to this subject, it would be only graceful on their part to consent to an adjournment until that gentleman could be present. (Laughter, and " He has spoken "; Since that gentleman had spoken an amendment had been moved The motion for adjournment was then withdrawn Mr BUCHANAN replied, and said that he had never heard of a proposal that Parliament should adjourn because one member was not in his place Mr Stuart could have been present if he liked, and if he chose to desert his post and abandon his duty it was not for Parliament to encourage him in doing so. He cordially approved of all that had been said by the Attorney-General regarding a trust, and agreed that these lands might be dealt with by the Parliament. It was high time to have this question settled on a basis of fair play and justice If there was a wrong to be redressed it was the wrong suffered by those sects that had not enjoyed a farthing of this money (Hear, hear) It went against his grain to vote for a s rating to be given to any denomination It would not be possible to inflict a greater torture on a person than to make him acquiesce an appropriation of the money of the State for the support of any religion whatever His course was clearly before his i now, and it was not to take this matter out of the hands of the Government, but to support the Government in the proposal He r agreed with that proposal, except in the matter of these denominations having the interest for one year to come That was a bitter dose for him to swallow CLaughter ) They were now voting enormous sums of money for educational purposes, but before long there might be a deficit in the land revenue from which those sums were derived The amounts received from the sale or lease of these Church lands would form the nucleus of a splendid fund for all time coming for those elaborate educational establishments which it was in con- templation to construct He hoped, therefore that the friends of the cause he was alix cating two and stand by the Government proposal The question that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question, was put and negatived The question that the words proposed to be inserted, be so inserted, was put and negatived on the following division :- ATES, 1.'
