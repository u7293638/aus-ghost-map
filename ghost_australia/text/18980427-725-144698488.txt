HAUNTED. One' day alas I lost my youth, I know not when or how; I only know I had it once, And cannot find it now But sometimes in the Winter I feel it in the air And when the snowflakes kiss my face It seems to touch me there. Then in the Spring the breezes That wonder from the South With warm caresses laden, Seek youth upon my mouth And, oh, the Summer sunbeams That make the roses blush — They stir my blood and linger To bid my wan cheeks flush. My youth I lost it long ago, But of thls fact I boast — It may be dead, but, surely, I Am haunted by its ghost. — Edward Van Zile.
