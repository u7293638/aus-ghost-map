ILorel Carcftwcll. Mr. Gladstone during his visit to Cannes recently, called upon Lord Cardwell, one of the closest of his friends and political colleagues. The poor man is now a complete wreck. He lives now, we believe, , permanently at Cannes, and may be seen, about on the terraces most days when the weather-is fine in a wheel chair â€” the ghost of a man who has played a conspicuous part in the Parliamentary lif e of our time from the days of Sir Bobert Peel till the recon struction of the army. THs biography, all cut, dried, and corrected in proof, has been in the pigeon-holes of most of the newspaper offices for a couple of years Tet a few years ago you might have taken a lease of hisilife, and he was one of the handsomest and most accomplished men of Ms time. Parliamentary life now-a-days kills off men very rapidly, and cop sidering the sort of life it is, the wonder is that men live so long as they do. -
