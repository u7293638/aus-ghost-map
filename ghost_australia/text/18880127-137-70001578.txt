A Glass of Cold Water. The following is the apostroph upon '"A Glass of Cold Water," by John IB. Goungh: Where is the liquor which God the Eternal brewed for all his children? Neot in the siemering still,over smoky fires choked with poisonous gases, and surrounded with the stench of siokening odors and rank corrup. tions, doth your Father in heaven prepare the precious essence of life, the pure, cold water. Bat in the green glade and grassy dell where'the red deer wandera,and the child loves to play;. there God brews it. And down, low downi in the lowest valleys, where the fountains murmur and therills ring; and high upon the tall mountain tops, where the naked granite glitters like gold in the sun; where the storm cloud broods, and the thunder storms crash; and away far out on the wide wild sea, where the hurricane howls music and the big waves roar; the chorus sweeping the march of God; there he brows it-that beverage of life and health giving water. And everywhere it is a thing of beauty, gleaming in the dewdrop ; singing in the summer rain; shining in the ice gem till the leaves all seem to turn to living jewels; spreading a golden wall over the setting sun; or a whitegaoze around the midnight moon. Sporting in the cataract; sleeping in the glacier ; dancing in the hail shower; folding its bright snow curtains softly about the wintry world and weaving the many colored iris, that seraph's zone of the'sky, whose warp is the raindrop of earth, whose woof is the sunbeam of heaven all checkered over with celestial flowers by the mystic hand of refraetion. Still always it is beautiful, that life giving water; no poison bubbles on its brink; its foam brings not madness and murder; no blood stains its liquid glass;I pale widows and starving children weep no burning tears in its depth; no drunken, shrieking ghost from the grave coures it in tbo words of eternal despair; peak out, my friends, would you exchange it for demon's drink, alcohol?
