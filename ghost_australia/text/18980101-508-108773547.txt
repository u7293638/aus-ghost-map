VEILED WOMEN. M One of the quesaonB that agitated Cairo last J winter waar -How *an aie atreet -i«41way company be compelled to curtaJn mare eSectuallytiie titflly car hareme? A large part 6t the &&, and iy w., meacs the European section exclusively, ' is eervefl by a rapid transit eyBtem'. The cars do not diffar materially fipom the open cars employed on Amerioaa lines; but the rear seat is fajarved for women, instead of smokers, and its use is indteated by curtains that might be drawn, but in practice are not drawn, at the sides. There is do curtain in front to divide Ube harem from, the other seats, 0an.il on aa important rputfr— Uke that, for example, from the Ezbskiyeh through thfc Boulevard Mehemot Ali to Old Cairo— tihe ceasaks chatter of its black-cloaked, blaek- veiied occupants, regaidla-e of the sUk-robaa m&n; In front and tfae red nightcappai hangsw-on at th« sWes, gives a hysteric suggestion of a picnic attended by masked mourners. Many of tne solid Moslems of Cairo are. dis quieted by the publicity of the street-car harems, and their feelings are understood, and to some ex tant shared, by a few of the Anglo-Egyptiana of tie sscand and third generations. The short line , of the Constantinople underground railway is morfe mindful of Moslem custom* The harem divisions of its cars are fully curtained; but these diviaion* are too email to hold the women who flock from the Gateta-Para sections during shopping hours to the bazaara of Stamboui, ant. there is usually an over flow in the main part af the oar. There are aim mar resorts among tha islands of the Bocphorufl where TurJdeia woficen sometimes go unveiled, and may be ee^n floating in light caiqueo under bright colored parasols with all the enjoyment ot a bar harbor girl in a canoe. In Constantinople iteeSf so many women had put the veil aside as to call out, a short time ago, an irade from Abdul Bamid commanding them to cover thedr features. Travellers who see the struggle of 'la jeuud Turque' after Western forms of civilisation and the easier movement of Egyptian . governmental circles in the same direction, often receive the imprearion thai the 'changel&B; Bafit' is chang ing faster than any other part of the world, and that ' the veiled woman.'- brushing aside all the imagined romance of her life : behind the fretted mouehaxabieh, is mediating the ballot and the bJcycle. But the danger is not .yet Imminent. The incongruous mixture of West and East to bs found in Constantinople, Cairo, and Alexandria la, be-, cause &t; its incongruities,, 'peculiarly interesting. Nowhere else have I felt the strength of Islam a.4 I did in an expra-.e train in Lower Egypt, wqeo an impoang old Moslem stopped hie chat with an ? American girl to consult his American Wtftch, uncoil his 6ft of satined length, drop his aJippprB, and prostrate himself in sunset prayer. The calm, of the Sheik's devotions, undisturbed by the pre^. eeoce of the 'personally conducted,' or by the $ic4i that he mieUiok the direction of Mecca^ and had; to repeat his maghrib exercises on the platform with the wind blowing at forty niiles an .hour, billooning his robes a»d untwisting the yjifds of white fc&d-r; clothe about hU head, was tapi»3?lve.
