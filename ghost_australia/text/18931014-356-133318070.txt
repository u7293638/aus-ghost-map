SPORTING INTELLIGENCE, MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS. Tim victory of Matchbox in the KIempton Park Grcat Breedeors' Pro duce States, run -in England, will place St. Simon ahead of Isonomy in the list of winning sires this season. Last year, nothing had the ghost of achanuco with the Dluke of Portland's stallion, whose progeny won close on £56,000 in stakes. This year, owing to the great success of isinglass, Isonomy secured a long lead, but St. Simon gradually overhauled him, and it is hardly likely, now that Isinglams has finished racing for the season, that Isonomy will catch St. Simon again. Mr. W. R. WVilson, on his return to Australia recently, reported that St. Simon gets his stock rather small, bat there is no doubt that he gets them good. Mr. Wilson owns a daughter of St. Simon in Elsio, who won a few races in this colony, and is now at the stud. Silver, the sire of Silver Imago, who ran third to Matchbox, is the sire of Harmonist, now at Flomington. Hero are a few big double-event wagers actually laid and culled from the books of Mfr. John Cohen, a fielder in Melbourno :-£5000 to £10 Strahan and Fortunatus, £5000 to £10 Titan and Swordbearer, £5000 to £10 Divi sion and Penance, £400 to .8 Stead fast and Vakeel, £5000 to £10 Sun shine and Swordbearer. Straight out on the Caulfield Cup Mr. Cohlown has laid since last week :-£2000 to £120 Fulham, £2000 to £60 Strahan, £1000 to £60 Jeweller, £1000 to £40 Port Admiral, £1000 to £50 Wild Rose, £2000 to £60 Steadfast, and £1000 to £30 Graduate. For the Derby the following have been his biggest -bets this week :-£1000 to £90 Pounamu (before he ran on Saturday), £1000 to £120 Pulvil, £500 to £60 Solanum, £1000 to £150 Gargcon, and £400 to £50 again Pulvil. For the Melbourae Cup--£3000 to £120 Tridentate (in Sydney), £1000 to £50 Portsea, £1000 to £30 Fortunatus, £1000 to £65 Camoola, and £1000 to £50 Malvolio. All of which tends to show that after all Australia is not altogether so poverty- stricken as the pessimists seek to make out. A wonderfully good betting race, perhaps thie most remarkable on re cord, has the V.T.C. Derby of '93 already beon. No. fewer than seven horses have each in turn been well backed at 6 to 1. Carnage touched 5 to 1 at one time; and. Patron was actually supported at a point shorter odds, while Light ArtillU6'rProjectile, Trenchant, Sailor Prince, and (more recently) still Gargon have each been supported at 6 to 1. When one adds to this the fact that Pulvil, Pounamu, and Aquarius have each found friends who have backed them to win a thou sand or two, the apparently open nature of this season's Derby is still more strongly marked. Writing in the Hamilton exchange recently 'Scound' says :-' The late Major Bell, better known in the early days as "Big Bell," was not only one of the strongest men- if not the strongest-in Victoria but one of the most active. Most old colonists will remember his feat of clearing a three rail fence with a. fat wether under each arm, but I think the following equals that p'erformancc. In the good old days when there was no railway between Geelong and Melbourne, and communication was chliefly by steamer, grand times were spent on board the Citizen (sinco lost and never a vestige of her found) and other vessels. On one occasion two of the passengers were the lato Alexander Fyfe, MI.L.A., a noted sprint runner, and-. Major Bell. Said Fyfe to Bell, 'I'11 give you a spin up to Mack's Hotel; last in pays for No. 2 Mosello," champagne not being much thought of in those days. "' I'm your man," replied Bell, and away they went at a. rare old bat. On the flat it was trick and tie between them, but when it came to broasting the hill Fyfe went ahead.- On roaching the road, or street,he was some yards in advance, but to his disgust he folind the way to the chief oentrance blocked by a bullock driay and team. lound this he went, expecting Bell to follow, but oh! no! not for John. Noticing that one of a pair of bullocks was standing up whilst the other was lying down, Major Bell went for them, cleared them splendidly, and, turning round, stood at the entrance of the hotel waiting to give his panting opponent a hearty welcome.'
