TO THE EDITOR OF THE OBSERVER. Sirâ€”The laziness of the citizens of Adelaide, and of the population of South Australia in general, in preparing themselves to resist foreign invasion, which may take place as soon as England takes part in the European war, is a matter of great astonishment to me. They are culpably slow, as they will discover to their cost. We should by this time have several regiments of volunteers ready to take arms when required. South Australians are fond of their some- i times hard-earned money, and it is quite right they should be; but, if they do not look sharp, j they may before long have only the ghost of it to comfort them. j South Australians are continually making j their loyalty their boast. What does it consist j of? Nothing but talk. They should not waste i time in useless disputations, but he up and 1 doing. Hoping you will find a corner for the above, ! I am, feir, &c.;, Adelaide, August 2,1859
