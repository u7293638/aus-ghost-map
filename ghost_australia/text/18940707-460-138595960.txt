ORIGINAL POETRY. REMEMBER ME. When summer sheds her sweetest smiles On Tasma, gem of southern isles, And fragrant are the scented bowers With glorious wealth of summer flowers— When blue the sky that knows no cloud, As eyes to which my soul is vowed, And morning and the evening star In Derwent's wave reflected are— The ocean-tide itself, I ween, Shall bear fond greeting to my Queen. Hark to the voice from over-sea, And—heart's beloved—remember me ! When winter nights are chill and cold, And mist and rain the earth enfold, And ghosts of summers that have been Are brooding o'er the silent scene, And withered every bud that blows, And thorn sole wreck of rarest rose— When envy speaks the absent ill, In spite of all—be loyal still. While suns light up the realms of day, And moons the wave of ocean sway, As sun and moon unchanging be, And—heart's beloved—remember me ! I see the image that I prize In evening star that lights the skies; No murmur of the passing wind But calls thy accents to my mind ; And forms of fairest beauty please Me only as my spirit sees Some passing likeness, blurred and dim, Of her no human art can limn. Art can the outer form control— No art depicts that peerless soul— No weird too dark, too drear to dree. While you—beloved—remember me ! H. B. BIGNOLD.
