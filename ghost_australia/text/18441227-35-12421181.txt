DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE NEW CHURCH-The ceremony of laying the foundation stone of a new church at O'Connell Town, on the New Town Road took place yes terdav morning in the presence of a large num- ber of people, principally resident in the imme diate neighbourhood. The Rev Dr. Steele commenced the service, by reading, alternately with the people, the 132nd psalm ; after which he read the 3rd chapter of the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians. The stone was then fixed in the usual manner, the Bishop saving, "I lay this as the foundation and corner stone of a church to be built on this place : to be named St Stephen's, and to be set apart for the preaching of the right Catholic Faith, which we believe and confess in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen. His Lordship then briefly addressed the peo ple; first on the necessity, in order that Chris- tianity may be preserved amongst us, that the ordinances of religion, prayer, preaching, and the administration of the sacraments, be attended to, next the usefulness of these ordi- nances if they are merely formal, if they are not performed with a a faithful spirit He then dwelt on the dutv of all contributing in pro portion to their means towards the support of the Church, and, lastly, gave an exposition of the doctrine of the Church respecting the observance of Saints days, The ceremony con cluded with the benediction. The church is to be a neat plain building forty-five feet by twenty-seven, and can easily be enlarged should it become necessary, which from the increase of population in that neighbourhood is likely to be the case. BENEVOLENT ASYLUM-On Christmas Day, the inmates of the Benevolent Asylum were regailed with roast beef and plum pudding. Upwards of two hundred men and women, most of them advanced in years, sat down together in the large hall, and seemed to enjoy the bountiful feast that had been pro- vided for them. His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by lady Gipps, and his Aide-de- Camp, was pleased to honour the company with his presence, There were also among the visitors the Speaker of the Legislative Council, the Colonial Secretary, the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Mr. Icely, M.C., Mr. and Mrs. Merewether, and the Rev. Fr. Ross, one of the members of the Committee. Having gone over the sick wards and other parts of the building, His Excellency seemed much pleased with the accommodation provided for the healthy, as well as the sick poor; the good quality of the food, the cleanliness of the apart- ments and the general order which prevailed. The appearance of the while certainly does credit to the Master and Matron, and not less so to the Resident Surgeon-all of them old and tried servants of the Institution.
