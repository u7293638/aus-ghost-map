SCENES IN CRETE. e, (From Blackwood's Magazine.) ON the day following our arrival ave shoulder our guns, and strike off for the Akrotin peninsula To say truth, spot does not so much enter into our minds as a desire to coast along this famous bay of Suda, and examine a harbour in importance and in safety second to none in the Mediteranean Sea And it was averse for neither fair nor leather did we see throughout the long day We did not expect big game for had not Pococke already written, As to wild beasts I could not be informed that they have any other except the goat and the haze But this barren thirsty highland did not even show these force ous animals, nor did a single bird rise within our sight Yet were we well repaid At first our way lay along the cliffs of changing the bay Then we turned, passing at rare intervals holt deserted villages and still, walled convents, to emerge again near the extremity of the peninsula Here and there a peasant tilling the soil looked up and bade us good day But desolation and silence ruled supreme for the dry soil scarce repay s culture and the cistern water is too scarce to be used for gardens In many places we found limekilns where the limestone rock is broken up and burnt and crete or lime is made Even I dently this peninsula was once an island, and geological proofs show how it was raised by successive up leavings But our object is not to apologize, but to visit the nuns of the ancient city of Mines, and thence to observe the bay We reach the village of Stanley, through narrow bridle paths between thick stone we walls and on the hillside towards the bay we find some relics of the ancient walls, stretching from a circular tower downwards towards a most remarkable deep circular basin, which once was the port of the city Of profound depth, this basin seems to have been the crater of a volcano and is now completely) closed in by a semi circular reef of rocks.

But' no true Tur bush style the works have never been begun "W he ever we went in the country - whether on the hilltops among the villagers or on the plains among the olive groves, however beautiful he land through which we rode-aÂ«oni>e of silence and desolation oppresses us Ev crew here are the ruins of larras the villages are thinly peopled one hears no murmur of voices no laughter or shouts of children "the few peasants who are seen wander about listlessly like ghosts among,' deserted halls insensibly the silent Elysian fields, present themselves before our mind For the wants of strife and battle that have passed over this beauteous isles have swept away the flower of all its manhood, and the remnant that is left is we watched and held in check by armed men for nearly seven centuries Crete has been ruled by force, always striving to exchange its existing government for another
