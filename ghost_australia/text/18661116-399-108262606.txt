MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. On the 1st of December ensoiog aa opportunity will he afforded, to the rate payers of tbe town to cjiangp/jather for fetter or worse, the eoatfitat&£ of one present Municipal Council. W| say for .better or for worse, for snch. willbe tLe ■case, as four Councillors Mid iftaf Mayor will retire,' thus giving ac&mis; laafority to. ; be elected. It will therefore depend upon •the ratepayers whether the am± Gooncillora ;c c' are tor 6b as usefnl, to the town as the present ones have heeoj.or whether they are c< toOTfoJotlieir predecessors in judiciously r_ cpendingthe money which will be en .♦: ?tnteted tothem. • _ J?^Kng at the present lively interest . ■ take^in the matter by die ratepayers them v • selyes, and and taking1 thatas an index of their ieelings on the subject, we sboiddsay "' thi⁢ they dii not care a figf which way it went;. That whether Tom, Jack, or Harry wentinto represent them signified very " ^ : jitde.^This, we say, wouldbea fair in •:v .. ftrence to draw from the- present aspectof .CiX 1 i; •Mi • 3^?®re 876 f°ur vacancies to fill up, and yet there are but two candidates who have pjbblicly signified tbp intention of coming ^ forward. We say it is a disgrace to ./the town and every one concerned. Weare quite aware that there are some men Who $re quitequalified for the position of v ^Councillors whose, imsiness or positioh maj hot enable them to undertake . the duties,;' but while we admit this, it is also a feet that there are many ofour tradesmen ; whosebdsines$ habits particularly^it thetn .for the position,..and wbb^jinightmtb :a 1 ^eJT small .strain upon their undertake the duties of Gouncillorfor a time ' We look upon it as a very bad sign , in '' deed. when. sucty offices have to about beg v«ing- It Should not be so.

We a~kjie-it generous of these Der&bns; to expect that those gentle men who have, already a$rve r. past eighteen^'onths?should be ;sgaih called on.when their inclination leads them * to say "enough?"

" u [Smcfe the aoove was iia typd,'we aie' happy to find that two other candidates . have been induced to come forward, -so there is now a candidate for each vacancy ====================== A PUBLIC MEETING was held at Lin- foot's .Hotel, Bagots Gap, on Saturday evening last to take into consideration the necessity of memorialising the Central Board of Main Roads to place the road through Bagot's Gap in a state of passable repair Mr. James. Harvey was unani- mously voted to the chair, who stated the object of .the meeting, and was fol- lowed by Messrs.' Macnamara, White, Laintol, Gamlin, and several other speakers Who deprecated in telling terms the conduct of the Board, the Surveyor {Mr. Macaulay), and Mr. Rankine for ignoring the claims of the District as they ~ had done by leaving the road in such a shameful and disgraceful state. Several resolutions were passed, and a memorial adopted praying that a sum of money be devoted for Repairing the road without delay. On IVIonday: last the Adelaide Police Court* Was /densely cwwded by the curious , anxious to get a glimpse at Kerney arid his associates, whom, it will be remembered, ; were*- apprehended' on several charges of! ..' highway robbery. - The two Eerneys and Thomas Field were fully committed on-ail ^ the charges brought against them, viz.-— John Kerney en two charges of highway. ; roMwy at Prospect Village, and also for being concerned, in . robbing Archibald Maxwell Jafeey, at UnleyjDavid Kerney, f<» robbing .Henry Joseph Garrood, at Gawler j 'Ihomas Eiehij &r; assisting in the jobbery, of Mr Garrood, and also for assault and robbeiy of Gjharles Ide, at Adelaide, at which time Richard Apple . dere was Wounded by a pistol shot The other two prisoners (Robert AHen and Thomas Creamer),. although notcommitted ... for the crime "with whjx^iNhey were charged, were detained in custody to answer some 'other charges. ; Fhiday last,' the Prince of Wales's , Birthday was observed as & pretty general • holiday in £apunda, but beyond the mere closuig of plaices of! business there was no greaf demonstration.

The inhabitants of Kapunda will we are sure regret to hear of the early death of "the l8t Eranklia Hotel, in this town, which occurred at Holey on Taesday last. The memorial in favour of ft Tramway from K&punda; to the Niprth West Band, Is now oat for signature^ and we underetetid that, over 1,000 signatures have been obtained in Adelaide -alone. , On Thursday afternoon we witnessed a trial of Mr Mellor's mowing machines, which took place in a paddoek belonging to Mr J. Done tan, on the Clare road. Just now the at tention of tihe farmers has been greatly directed to improvements in this description of faxming implement^;; hitherto mofct of the attempts made ' have from Bome cause'^or other failed, Mr Mellor and others have given great attentioQ to the matter ; and we beliBTe thai-no*r the object; hat been attained, and thict'in&win;^ machines' will very speedily take the place of the scythe,; as the reaper has that oftheeiekle. 'Mr Mellor had two machines on the field; No. 1 was fitted ■with the side delivery—that is, the capacity to > throw the portion cat dear o£ both machine and hones, the knife of which resembles a cross cut, and can be kept constantly lubricated with' ' oil by means of a simple contrivance.
