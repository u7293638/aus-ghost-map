Legge, of Gosfbrd, New South Wales, has five sons members of the two contingent*. They are Captain 3\. £. Gordon Legge. Adjutant of die 2nd Regiment, and Percy Liegge, of the Army Mcdical Corpe, both of whom arc at present at the front, while Lieutenant G. H. Legge, of the Mounted Rifles (Frab?s), F. If. Ijegge, a priva,te in the Mounted Infantry, and Trooper W. G. Legg», of the Australian Horse, are all going with the Second Contingent. Thq •fath r gave all hl« mona a very hearty Bend-off. dnd stated that their action made lilm 'the prondeet man in Austra lia." It was jurt what he would like them to have done, he said. Mr P. W. Wilkinson, writing in the Sydney 'Dally Telegraph' on the Mngers tent^ln engagement, says :—TVe haven't a ghost of a notion what it cost the Bo i"S in the trenches, but our shell lire most have been awfully destructive. A Boer officer whom we " took prisoner told j me that lie saw SO men lolled by one Lyddite shell, and that he himself had lost half his company. ( After the battle to'ece these shattered units arriving in waggon loads from thc front, some of them with as many as four shots through their bodies, others smashed up with ahrapnel, most hideous sights to look upon. lite accommodation was limited to such an extent that scores > had to lie all night under hotel vera.ii-1 dahs, after having their wounds dressed. I stayed at on hotel that night, but got j no sleep owing to the moans and groans from two pro=trafip figures just outside my, door, wounded officers nest door just brrathing their last, 'Boer prisoners who had been bayoneted by onr men writh ing In agony with death "written plain on eveiy feature, men dying In scores attend ed by Amrades who had escaped with slight injuries; -fresh waggons arriving with ghastly freight at frequent intervals. Immediately' surrounded by anxious com rades, lowing tremendous anxiety as to who were still left behind. t I reached Magerefontein, near'Hodder River, in the grey dawn of Monday, just In the nick of time to see those brave, dauntlrss "kilties'. I eaw them moving forward through the mist in perfect bat tie army, with the light, springy step of the parade ground. I watched than stagger and falter within a tew hundred yards of the enemyte trenches, under a perfect storm of bullets, then lie down and fire, and finally retire In confusion, leaving their dead and wounded behind, while onr own New South-Wales Xjanccrs and Mounted Infantry rode up to cover their retreat. At the moment, I didn't know them from the British Tommies.' Commandeering by the way, is quite a fashionable pastime here. Whenever yon run short of anything you comman deer Ct—from the Boers if possible, but anyhow if necessity. On ^te way to the front I bad to leave my hon» bdiind at Belmont, there being no means of get ting further north except by mad, and, this is not pniitieulariv safe when the Boexs might cut across the line «t any time. I bought another tip hae, but duriiq; the fight at Hagosfontein I tied, it up to ocsp closer to the firing line, I and when 1 went back somebody had commandeered it I have given up bajr ing hqrses now. and etSl I am not with out a mount.

Their commander, with ta telescope gbred to his right eye, kept them going. It was good to hear his chee/y words of command. 'Six thousand and nine hun dred yards, at the middle of the "topic ifo the right—Lydoite shell—ready—firer war as the missile burst" from its mouth with the roar of ten thousand thunder claps. Then there was a. lull to watch the effect through the glass/Finst rate,' cries, the commander; 'another Lyddite shell, same range and same kopje.' a ■second terrific report ae before, B doud of dirty-looking smoke and as It drifted away from the front of the kopje another -Bh§H > w went on for many touts to the accorn panlraentof deep nnnbHng from-a howitz er bflUeiy to onr csthme rigbt. _ -
