THE SCEPTIC AND THE GHOST. A SOUTH GIPPSLAND INCIDENT. The aIntest ghost story comes fro. South Gippsland, and is connected with a deserted teacher's residence, which the Minister of Education, in the interests of economy, decided to remove to another part instead of putting up a new building. Mr. Peacock was recently appcealed to on behalf of a teacher in the locality men tioned to increase the size of his house, two rooms being rather too small for himself, his wife, and four childred. The menubers for the district supported the request, and the Minister decided to remove from a distance of about the same size, adjoining a school which had been closed, and thus in crease the size of the applicant's home. After the contract for removal ihad been let, it transpired that the deserted house was " haunted." One of the contractors, lhowever, was a sceptic, and scoifed at the idea of there being any spirits, divine or otherwise, or any spirit land. I-e got the school-house on the waggon, andi all went well till albout 1.0 a.m., lwhen a strange noise was heard in the adjoiniig roomn to the olo in which he slept. The sceptic started up. lie trembled and Ihis teeth chattered. He waited only to ipartially dress hinmself, and, without loolking ill the room whence the nloise emansated to see if a native bear was scratching himself, he leaped from the waggon and ran as fast as his legs would carry him for about two miles, leavinlg tile horses to take case of them selves. iHe did not liare to come near tlhe waggon again till the sun was up. The schooi-house has been delivered. ibut in view of the countractor'slexperience tile teacher's family hardly relish the idea of liviung in the building, and further representations have been made to the Minister of Education. All the concession, ihowever, MIr. Peacock would make was to order that tihe doors of the building were to be changed and re- palinted. P'ossibly MIr. Peacok's idea was to thus confuse the alleged ghost.
