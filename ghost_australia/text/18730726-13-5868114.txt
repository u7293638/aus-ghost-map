SATURDAY, JULY 26, 1873. The question of a ship canal from Melbourne to Hobson's Bay has been somewhat complicated by the Laboura of the LoYV-lying Lands Commission. The commission had three distinct plans, or schemes, for effecting this before them, and a large mass of evidence was ten- dered in support of each. This was, however, moro than a little conilieting, and the inevitable result has followed a wide difference of opinion among the members of the commission. That might havo been anticipated from tho first, having regaid to the number of gentlemen placed on the commission, and should, wo think, have been guarded against The aphorism of the ancient Hebrew sage as to there being " safctj in a multitude of "counsellors, is not oi turn eis ii application, m modern tunes it anj rate Gnon three plans oi schemes for the execution of a certain Yvork Yvith

meicantile pin suits Other matters appear, both in the report of the commission and in the ad- dress of the dissentients to His EXCEL- LENCY', not having more than a remote bearing on the question of the construc- tion of a ship canal ; and these Y\'e pass over for the present. But a Yvord or two may be added on the different decisions arrived at on this question by the two contending parties in the commission. This does not, so far as Yve are aware, appear to have arisen from any jealousy on the part of the professional members of the commission against the interference of non-profes- sional men in purely engineering matters. The majority certainly say in their- re- port, that " the Yveight of the profos " sional evidence they had taken was " emphatically opposed " to the adop- tion of the first or direct scheme, inas- much as' "the mouth of a direct " channer'' could not be kept open without an enormous expense. But the reply of the dissentient minority to thiB is, that there was "a large pre " ponderance of professional evidence " in support of the VÍOYV " they had been led to entertain on that point, in the evidence taken before former commissions, Yvhich Ihey had been " directed to consult and Mll " aider,", as also in " facts recorded io " the evidence attached" to their own report. Professional men have an na. doubted right to look upou themselves as better qualified than others to give an opinion on questions which como pecu. liarly within their own province, ¡vlwaw supposing that they have paid sufficient attention to them. But there does not so far as we can gather from the évi- dence taken before the commission an. pear lo have been any obtiusive exliibj. bition of this feeling of supciioiity tt»' others on the part of the profesiional members in connexion with its pro. ccedings. Any other 20 gcntlcm" might have been just as niucli divided in opinion as these 20 aw on a question which affords 30 much scope on each side for freedom of thought. It is on some accounts doubtless, to be regretted that thorc vva< such a division of opinion, 11 on one side and 9 on the other. The ¡settle- ment of the question will theieby be delayed or indefinitely postponed. lint it may lead to a closer consideration of the Yvhole matter, and to the adoption of the best scheme ultimately. In tint case, any regret al the delay will necessarily bo much moderated.

The only efficient means is to allow Nature to plant a thousand young trees, as she is quite ready to do, for every one that is cut down for man's use. At the same time, it is not to be denied that another useful task lie3 at the door of the Foicsts department that is, to prevent the wasteful use of trees, and still more their wanton de- struction Circumstanees have been ?very hard uPon tuc Victorian forests In the earlier days, Yvhen bush fnes Yvero nioie common, hundieds of acres of Y.duable timber YVCIC often destioyed by the criminal negligence of a drayman or a sYvagsman. Then saw -millers, splitters, 4\\.c have always been most extravagant m then habits, destroying more trees than they used , if they are more econo- mical now, it is only because an ever nicreasiiig scarcity has compelled them to use moie care The extreme libe lality of our Lind system has also tended to the destruction of our timbei Under successive Land Acts the tei utory has been alienated without any othei consideration than how best the earth-hungei of the public could be appeased, aud it ILLS como about that much land has been given away almost lor nothing that had £20 worth of timber on every acie of it To the aoncultui.il settler the noblest of tiees YVCIC no bettei than weeds, and as such they weie cxtei nimated .is speedily as possible Either they w ere felled and burnt wheie they fell, 01 they were " nnged," and left to disfiguie the Land- scape, g mut ghosts of trees All tlus was sinful waste, and it is to be feared Mindai piactices still prev.nl To put a stop to the wanton destiuction of ti ees, to compel an economical use of them Yvhere then use is peimitted, and to en- courage Natuie to replace those Yvhich aie îeniOYcd-these are the tasks which de volve upon the Lands dep irtment, and if the) ai e pi operly perfoimed aboon will be conferí ed upon the public Yvhich futuie generations will enjoy and appreciate If they .ire neglected, or improperly pei formed, ill the -dilettante foiestry that Mi CAM Y-, lus assistants, and his sue cessors, can possibly introduce, YVIII do 1 nothing to supply the omission Deodais and araucarias aie splendid ornaments to oui parks and gardens , and the oak, the elm, and the plane tiee of northern Europe, lining oin loads and footp iths, arouse the most pleasing reminiscences, but the natue gum ti ees YVIII long con tinue to be indispensable to us, and their ince must be kept up no matta at what cost, 01 at Yvhatevei mcon Ycmence to the classes who piofit by their reckless destiuction The people of New South Wales aie much to be commiserated, although, sooth to say, they aie by no means back waul in supplying food foi inutli Tluough the blundeimg incapacity and unbridled arrogance of then rulois they find themseh cs left alone m then gloiy to cany on their mail communie ttion with Emopoas beat they cm Foi a shoit time aftei declining co opoiation vv ith Yictoi ia, m a fit of chagi in at hav ing been defeiteil on the question of toi numiB, Mi PviiKhs was self contained and den mt Sydney should hav o its Californian line and be altogethei inde- pendent of the impel tinent young up stait who piesumed to dictate to " Now South W.ilcs, the oldest and " tho liehest of tlie Austiahan colo " mes " But, hovvevei consolatory this determination may havo boon to the pcituibcd spnit of hci nate Piemici, doubt» seem to havo alisen in that gen- tleman'_ mind as to w bethel his subjects would legaid the airangement with equal satisfaction, and whothei they would send then lctteis by a longei ion te-oven sup- posing the sei vice to bo thoioughly and efficiently oiganiscd-foi the piuposo of avenging the wounded honoui of their country and the ruffled feelings of their chief. Ilaiassed by these fcais, Mi P HIKES got oil his peich foi awhile, and condescended to heap coals of file on his rival's head by offering to take Victonan conespondence na San Francisco m con- sideration of leceivmg the mel o postage.

This is very magni- ficent, no doubt, but it is also intensely funny | Tlio overwhelming majority by which the Assembly refused to entertain Mr. COPE'S proposal to bestow the fran- chise on the members of the police force is a gratifying evidence that on some questions, at all events, lion, members entertain sound opinions. With the exception of Sir CHARLES GAVAN DOTTY, and perhaps Mr. RICHARDSON, there was not a single gentleman of any position or influence in the House who could be induced to support the causo of the constabulary. The first of those we have named can hardly be looked on as an impartial judge in the matter, as we way assume he is naturally biassed in favour of a large body of his felloYv-countrymon and co-roligionists. The advocacy of most of the other mem- bers who spoke to the question-Mr. CURTAIN, Mr. A. T. CLARK, Mr. MASON. Mr. L. L. SMITH, and such like-would be moro likely to ruin a good cause in the estimation of sensible men, than anything we can well conceive. Let us, however, examine the main fallacy which ran through the speeches of all alike. it ivas said that the police have a grievance in that while other civil servants' are allowed to vote, they alone aro excluded from tho enjoyment of that privilege. This, howoY'er, is ho griovanco whatever, for abstinence from political action is of tho essence of the contract they have entercd_ into with tho state. But moro than this, it is easy to show that the dis- tinction drawnis no arbitrary ono, but that it is dictated by sound policy, and a due regard to what is beBt both for tho force and tho public. Other civil servants aro not called on to interfero directly with the people, and do not, like the police, come into contact with thom at ovory turn. Their impartiality, therefore, is a matter of less concorn. Wo grant that by declining to give a man a vote, and prohibiting him from giving public ex- pression to his political feelings, you cannot reduce him to a political cipher, but you can at all events insure as far as possible the appearance of neutrality. And tills is a great gain, for if the mob once bolieved at an election that tho police were acting in a party spirit, you might say good-bye to anything Uko order. How is it that two or thrco policemen aro sufficient at present to control a crowd ! Is it not because they oxorciso a moral influence arising from the belief that they aro simply tho unbiased ad- ministrators of tho law ! Destroy this belief, and their moral inlluonoo vanishes, and then fifty times their number would not exercise the samo sway. Aconstablo could not voto without publicly exhibit- ing himself in the light of a partisan, a character ho could not assume without dustroying his usefulness. Wo licai ficquent and loud eoiupluuts about the steam îolloi which has boon at woik in oin sheets foi some time past Some take it amiss that the machine should bo seen and heaid dining the d iy, when

Police Court, yester- , day, two boys named John White and Wil- liam Hamilton were charged, on remand, with stealing a horse belonging to Mr. Hugh Iioss, a landholder residing at the Williams- town Junction. The latter stated that on the afternoon of the 11th ho missed from his land ahorse for which ho had some time pre- viously refused £0, and as he could not find the animal by the next day he conclude- that it was stolen, and gave information to the police. The prisoners were seen on the same day riding the horso towards Footscray, and a tallosv-melter at the Footscray Bone-mills proved that on the 15th the boy Hamilton brought a horse (tlie hide of which was nosv identified) to the bone-mills and received 7s.' 6d. .for it. The Bench committed Hamilton for trial, but acquitted White. Frederick Tickell, a lad of 10, was summoned for not supporting his illegitimate child by Ellen Danaher. The hearing of the case occupied several hours, after which the Bench dis- missed the complaint.

Detective Alexander will probably arrest Fairbrother on next Sunday morning." There seems to be some fatality, writes our Sandhurst correspondent, attending the judges passing sentences on persons con- victed at our criminal sessions of late. They satisfy none of the public, and the prisoners are themselves felt to be sometimes too harshly as well as far too leniently dealt with. It seems but yesterday that the general voice was raised in condemnation of his Honour Justice Fellows for the absurdly light sentence passed on the Great Britain gold robbers. To-day everybody is discussing the strangely unequal sentences delivered yes- terday by his Honour Justice Barry in the case of the several convicted ones brought before him. A man named McKenzie, for stealing a blanket, was sent on the roads for six years with hard labour. Phillips and Smart for defrauding the orphan to the extent of £3,000 were sent to gaol for three years with hard labour. Costin, for breaking into an empty office and the em- bezzlement of a paltry £4 3s 4d., is sent on the roads for eight years; while Rea, the gunsmith, for tampering with and ruining two young infants for life is imprisoned for less than half the period, in idleness, unless he chooses to work. The last sentence is the most incomprehensible of all. The man is a very old man, one who has been unco' guid and rigidly righteous for 15 years past. He called witnesses who deposed that he never was known to be drunk or to drink, and that very fact, which appears to have weighed with his Honour, is held to take every vestige of palliation or excuse for his atrocity away from him. His history is certainly very extraordinary. A most steady toiling penurious man for years he worked himself by constant ap- plication and effort into a business which brought him in £1,000 a year. He was greatly respected in the city for very many years and held up as an example of what industry and sobriety could accomplish in Sandhurst under adverse circumstances. In his old age and grey hairs he commits this intolerable and secret crime, not on one infant but on two—a crime that has ruined the poor little ones, wrecked a family and sent a fine young man into eternity. Is not such a criminal a more grievous offender than the "burglar" Costin who broke into an empty room and abstracted therefrom the books of a half defunct mining com- pany? Public opinion here at least says "yes." A meeting of the committee of the Retreat for the Cure of Inebriates was held yesterday at 46 Collins street east. There were present Messrs Richard Hodgson (in the chair) Cur tam M L A Mason M L A lames Aluni o (bon treasurer) M Cutcheon and Dr M Carthy (secietaiy) Dr M Carthy said he had called the committee to-jether at very short notice in ordei to lay before them the position of affatrs The legulations uudei the Inebuates treatment Yet and the niles of the Retreat would be "i/etted m about a month Iheie had been subsciibed by the public £1100 and £1 000 had been lcceived fiom the Gov ernment But though this sum had been raised some of it upwnids of a j ear nto no patient had yet been received into the îetreat He (Di M Carthy) was prepaied to furnish dormitónos foi four voluniaiy latients at his own lisle in oiderthat the institution mitht be put at once into opeia tion Such furnitme would cost about £b0 The total current working expenses weie £18 a month and he did not think the same would be very materially mcieased by the re ception of foul patients and the inteiest pa)iible amounted to £8 a month making the total monthly expendituie £2l> ne estimated that the foin patients would piy£13 each per month to the institution so that the teceipts would be £o2 monthly In the euri out ox penses he h td named his balmy tis secietaiy and suienntendent was not included He had nevei lcceived sivpenco fiom the institution Hie other poition of the institution exclusive of the doimitoncs was aheady fin nished If the Gov ernment tave them another £1000 the institution he thought would lequne no furthei stite aid Mr Munro said tint £118 was now m the bank and that the total liabilities exceeded that amount by about £lo0 He thought that the Government had broken faith with the institution in not giving them mole than £1000 It was not just oi leasontble that the committee should peisonally mern furthei liability m connexion with the insti tution, and about £300 more was required to pay current liabilities and put the institution into thoiough woilunt older If the Govern ment would not give suflicient money to start with and if the public would not it would be better to cast the whole íesi onsibihty on the Government and hand ovei the institution to thom Aftei furthei discussion Mi Munro was nistracted to lay the state of aflaire before the Chief Seaetary and ask foi the othei £1000 which it was saul tho Gov ernment had promised Iheie is now on MOW nt the house of Mi James Davis caipentei so Rowena pm ade a model of D iv is s P itent Victonan YVmdow Sashes which possess several advantages ovei the oidniaiy kind in respect of neat ness durability cleanliness and comfort 1 y an ingenious but simple conti iv ance the sashes aie so made that they can be íeveised so is to be clc mod oi repaired with facility and can be made to act as loimes foi the puiposo of ventilation They can be used as ordinary sashes so is to slide up and down with the ud of lines and weithts Mi Davis consideis that his inv ention w ould be a good thing to utilise m the building of the contemplated new schools comt houses and othei public buildings m which a complete and easily woiked means of ventilation is a dcsidera turn and that it would be worth the while of architects and bmldeis to inspect the patent An inquest was held at Cowies Creek, Geelong, yesterday, before Dr. V.

Tho evidence svas to tlie eifect that the deceased had been in a weak state of health for some time, and had suffered greatly from pain in the stomach." Dr. Carstairs gave it as Ins opinion that death had been caused by chronic ulcération of the stomach, and a verdict was given accordingly. There were registered in the metropolitan and suburban districts during the week end- ing the 10th inst. 11G births and G2 deaths. The reports from all the districts were of a satisfactory' character. The Coburg School Board of Advice held a meeting in the road board room on Thursday evening. The whole of the members svero present. Mr. Duncan was appointed chair- man for the ensuing three years, and Mr. 0. Wilson corresponding secretary. It was do. cided to hold a meeting montldy, and to apply for the use of the board-room for that pur- pose, also that a weekly visit by some members of the board should bo mado to the schools until a suitablo building is erected. Application will be made for the use of the Volunteers' Orderly-room for school pur- poses. - A company has been formed, as announced in our advertising columns, for the purpose of mining at Swift's Creek, a portiou of the I Gipps Land district which has for many years attracted attention It is situated m the Omeo subdivision of the district about 70 miles north of Bairnsdale and boasts reefs of pros ed magnitude and richness A v cry complete quartz mill was placed in the locality at a cost of over £4 003 more than foui j ears ago and was kept going a conple of years by public crushing Unfortunately however it was found that the mill had been badly sited The reefs close to it ian out while one of the best reefs in the neighbouihood the 1-ureka-svhick had been opened out for 700ft along its course and had y îcldod o\ er an ounce to the ton-vv as divided from it by a difficult lange of lulls The mill has subsequently passed through the hands of two other companies but its situation has pieventcd its proving remunerative The company now formed under the no liability provisions of the statute of 1871 is teimcd the 1 ureka Tunnel Mini ig Company and contains in its list of shareholders an unusual number of substantial names It owns n lease of 08 acres of ground including the 1 ureka reef and also the mill m question winch it pui loses removing to the propei site It com menees with a capital ni hand of £2 000 and pi onuses lo gise the svoikings a thorough trial In the last published Government mining reports the munni, íegistrar at Ornoo states that quail/ nuning it Swifts Clock is at a standstill aw aittng the remos al of this milito t moie cential locality A practised minmf, managei Mi W ilium Dick late of the Abo I mcoln mine at S nidhurst has been sent to the gioimd and the business of lemosal has ali cady commenced Mr Chulés Blight who has organised the company has been ai pointed man tger in Alelbo uno A football match svill be played to day on the nietioiolitau ground between the Mo1, bonnie andTJiuscisitj clubs The follow mt, aie the tenus-Melbourne- Byrne Bennie Bail ei Booth Can Cur Cummm_ Comban loirester Goldsmith llnnniell Hepburn helnnd Loughnan Moore Kead lowie W llliams Who Uland W atson Ums eisity -Audeison Inglis itiincr Davidson Bui ton Macdonald (two) Jennings Tohuson Johnstone Hodgson Colles Chirnside (two) Once Ciool e Upton lowie Cox Kiddell cmeifecncj Dickson VI Donncll He nu limit, Hie Ubert paik will meet the Noith Melbom ne at Albeit iaik md the Cailton will tiy conclusions with the Collin, wood twenty Hie following matches have also boen ar îangcd -litzroy Standard v Rainbow m liichmond i addock Alma v Noith Sind ndfee on the ground of tlie lattei Stai of Kichmond s St kilda (second twenty) in Richmond paddocl Clifton (second twenty) s Albeit Carlton Impenal v 1 ssendon at ] ssendon Willi wistow n v lwentj fisoWil hanistovvn Aitilleiy Kings College v Povv lett Carlton (second twenty) s Combined Iionmongers in Roy ii paik Richmond v St Kilda on the ¿round of the latter Hawthorn v ¡studley pail at Studley paik f ast Melbourne v Southern in Kichmond paddock langridge Lmonv I unity School Vlbcitpark v North Melbom ne at Albeit paik Hie team to repiesent Vlbort paik will be selected from the followm_ -Afessrs Ulan Vtkmson Ltlei Blau Biacken Caitei (2) Cafton Ciooke (2) C Chessell Cles cidon W Gray Hart Harley Rees es ?sandilands Snow bill Sis if o layloi Second twenty of Albert park v second twenty of ?Melbourne at Albert paik The team to re piesent Albeit paik will be selected fiom the following -Mcssis Bilei Bracken Boykett (.alter Ciooke Clcseulon (') Chessell Ciocl ett lainane Harpei nughes lord I jons Mitthews Pnaui Sandilmds Slatlei layloi and Whitehoin RcfenniL, to the encumstamo ucently io ¡oited in oin columns that Captain!
