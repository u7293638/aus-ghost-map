ECHOES AND RE-ECHOES. Z do like that lrinfllj custom of sending Christmas and New Year cards—it has so mneh to recommend it. In the first place, it enables the poorest as well as the richest person to oonvey » pleasant intimation to far distant friends that they are not forgotten ? in the second plaoe, it is an encouragement to artistic taste; and in the third plaoe, it is economical as well as prettily effective, inasmuch as the giving of presents most find ft limit even in the bulkiest purse, whereas lor the price of one good gift a hundred friends can be gratified by the receipt of a beautiful card delightfully and eloquently exprersive of the generous feelings of the sender. The custom promotes good fellowship far and wide, . and I notice that the women folk, who as a role are rather fond of the pastime of touching, oh! so deftly, oas another's sore places, are gnat senders of Christinas and Hew Year cards; the Bweet tamtam, they ring and sting with equal facility, but they do not mean to be rally rough upon one another—it's only a little way they have got! , What bushels and tafhels of promises of amendm^gt the, mw. year has thrown at its leek, and stftat qo an title, of those pledges remain oatta Aandi at 41» and of the term without famfag beau redeemed by those who voluntarily put them in his path. The old yeachaa beep teeadjngkneedeep in broken promises fram the beginning,, and so will his successor. It is a way people have got Ih«y feel swfnlly sentimental and inclined toreform when the clock is approaching the midnight hour and the old year is giving *p tin ghost, but sentiment mm differs when It rubs shoulders with stff-intereafcp There is very littleof it left after the week's festivities are over and the direful effects of the Indigestible) Christmas podding have worn off.
