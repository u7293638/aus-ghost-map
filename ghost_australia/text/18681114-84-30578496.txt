SECOND DAY-MONDAY. The meeting was brought to a close on Monday, with a fair attendance of the public, and an excellent day's sport. The number of people on the course was considerably greater than it was on Saturday, and the racing was almostas good. For the Corinth ian Cup the field was reduced to two, Flirt and Comet, the former being the winner. The Maiden Plate was considered a nice little certainty for the Earl; but Kaizer upon this occasion proved too much for him, and the representative of the "yellow and black" had to be content with second place. Kaizer, by the way was ridden by Ramsay, who had recovered marvellously quick from the severe fall which he had on Saturday. The boy was loudly cheered as he returned to scale. For the Free Handicap Italian had been the reigning favourite at even money, until he was displaced yesterday by Karoola, about whom people took 5 to 4 freely. Grvey Moms, and even the Moor, found supporters; but Young Mormon was alnost friendless, and even'his owner thought he had not " the ghost of a chance ;" but " you never can tell till the numbers are up," and in this instance the despised outsider upset the certainty. Karoola was indifferently ridden, or he must have won it; and for that matter Young Mormon might have been ridden better, for the boy began to use his whip far too early in the race. Grey Momns ran up very well at the finish; but Italian was nowhere, the weight, the heavy ground, the hill, and the pace at which the light-weight division travelled, being somewhat beyond his capa bilities. Young Mormon, we may remark, was ridden by Finn, the boy who had charge of one of the horses and who wps injured at the late railway accident at the Sydney station. The Earl was scratched for the Birthday Stakes, which left a field of three; and the winner was found in Sailor Boy, who had not much difficulty in disposing of the pre tensions of Camel and Blabber. The Belter Skelter produced a dead heat between Gardiner and African, which was run off, the former proving the victor. Thus the meeting, which in a racing point of view was one of the most successful that ever took place at Homebush, was brought to a close. In our report of Saturday's racing we omitted to mention that in the Derby the rider of the Earl (Ashworth) lost one of his stirrup-irons; and but for this accident he feels confident that he would have won the race easily. We should also state that the steeplechase was just about three miles instead of two, as stated in the programme. We append an account of the winners.

This was the last event upon the card.
