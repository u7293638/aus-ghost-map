No one had wanted the Premier to go no one had been taken into his chair dence, no one missed him, and when he c uno back no one could point to anything as the result of his mission If I am not a great into to in itself if the Premier had only taken the House into his confidence but the fire man had told the House they would have to pay the amount whether they wanted to or not. That was a gross insult to the House. He confessed the Attorney-Gener ii had admirably succeeded in drafting attention away from the conduct of the Government There was a section of the Government support "era who differed from the Government more widely than the Government differed from the Opposition, but who only a oled 101 the Government through the supposed love for proceeds of duties, I ho lion income or for the Sturt had moved an iiinciiiliuani, but they know what that hon. member moved the Government, and whenever the Government was likely to be in danger the bon prohibit r for Sturt always ran to their mail Itopiediuted when the hon. member had made his little donionstrUiou by reason of his amendment, who could then be found out or the) Government. The speech of the AtUirnci- Goiio>-iit no doubt was a hue displayed orator i but I ion mainly Had it admonished to very little It amounted to this, that the Government, in having wrested the Tabourie idomtBrokoii Hill, d dlh'irduty , it is they also did their duty in having caused the arrest and trial of certain persons con- as to the hurricane institutions in Uns city, Mid having done their duty in two taut meet they contended that the should bin c a lease of office for all time the speech of the Attoiunv Gxiiti li wins in its bid for the hiipnirtot members of the Opposition The ctfcoinoy-bencrnl army to- grant Italy is; called the question of land and under by introducing it into the chamber in ino lit it on party debate He seemed to think that if anybody voted nights at the Government which would be opposing law and order Very few people would believe that Mr Giuuwns bringing with soil to drug the 0>v"mn_it before the country. He knew that there is not the slightest possible chance of The amendment being carried While the picture drawn by the "torney General solved his argument, it was unnecessary, because there was no party in the House or country oppose d to law and order, and his thin 14 horns to defend Unit cause was an insult to the House and the people It had been stated that the labour party had come into the House to son of the motor oats only of one class they had entered the House to represent the whole community, as there was nothing in their programme which they were obliged to support that would not home It the whole people (Hear, live in At the same time, the ill- considered rom tries of some members of the party soon after they entered Parliament save colour to the belief that they represented only one section of the community The yogi Hume of the labour party had been torn down the center by the action of the Government in introducing the tariff question, and half a dozen amendments finch as that submitted by Mr Cann could not heal the breach It was idle morning section of the community to send members into that House pledged to support the law, it they Ihcmathua showed an antipathy to its administration He would like to know whether the hon. member for Sturt intended to deal particularly with the case of the arrested leaders in his union jnr M Theo movement go to their trial. Mr CHICK I they have not been committed vet Dr HOI Lia They must be vo an unprejudiced, unbiassed trial, and, even it they wcromnocint what more could they be sure than to he tried by a jury of their of a country man ? Was the Tun member for Sturt going to gamble away the chances of these men in getting a fair hearing ? Mr CANN I here said that I did not intend to deal particularly with the in<m Dr HOLLIS The amendment would no doubt he the means of gaining the hon. member a good deal of credit at Broken Hill but no asked the hon ea.ntIo-1-ii to consider the case of the men, and to ask himself whether the a liniiiistratiou of the man should not be left free from of its do influx nee altogether Mr CANN lum judging only from the general administration of the law at Broken Hill Dr HOLLIS Well, then, did he i elude the case of these men who had been arrested i It so, he was not in a position to know whether the Government and later wrong If the hon gentlemen would not w threw his amendment Mr WALKER The House would not let him. Mr HOLLIS It would be necessary for each member to vote on it, and explain his reason for so doing He was not prepared to ask, whether the Government had acted lightly or wrongly in regard to the arrest of the labour leaders, for the simple reason that he was not in possession of the 9 h The facts of the case, and could not judge With it gard to other matters, however, he was thinly convinced that the administration of the law at Broken Hill had not been impartially carried out by the Government Mr HOUGHTON Then you will vote for Mr. Cann's amendment on that ground alone 5 Dr HOLLIS BUM! he would vote as he pleased. I With regard to the man question before the House, he could not understand why an endeavour should have been made to exclude the amendment moved by Mr Cotton He was opposed to the Government in granting the £1000 to the Premier, and he would give his vote for the retention of those words, but at the name time he protested against the action of the hon member for Sturt in forcing him into a false position, for in v owing as he intended to do so I would appear to be backing the real issue at stake When it came to the filial division hon. members would see that the subject upon which they had wased particularly « arm was included in Mr. Reid's motion members would stultify themselves if they voted against the Government for their administration of the law at Broken Hill, and then on Mr Reid's motion recorded their votes so as to keep the Ministry, which they had just condemned, in power Mr BOOTH said that in Una matter of the Broken Hill strike he would follow the leadership of the hon. member for Paddington If he (Mr Booth) was a partisan of the Government he would claim Sir Henry -Parker' speech to be on behalf of the Ministry Sir Henry had stated that the motion was wrong, and much silent at the present time. If that was so, it was wrong and inexpedient to vote for that motion In his (Mr Boom e) opinion it was impolitic- and unpatriotic to bring forward a vote of censure at any time during the Bro! on Hill strike. The question was, had the Government reasonable grounds for acting as they had done f He had no hesitation in saying that the Government had noted perfectly correctly. (Hear, hear ) They had had no other course open to them. No onorcgretiod Ino necessity for these arrests more than he did, but throughout the business the Government had acted with the most commendable impartiality. As to applying the Conciliation Act, to talk about con tribution to the Broken Hill stakes at that time was absolutely useless. Mr. CANN They have been -asking for It all along. Mr, BOOTS Mid but weald lead some extracts from a latter from Mr Howell, the manager of the Proprietary mine, which had been published in the wining Uaimng insisted on the 23rd August, and which had never been replied to by the strikers or their partisans That 1" for proved that Mr Howell was a friend of the miners, and in the letter he actually supplicated the men to return to their work as unionists to proceed to lead from the letter, and said it was absolutely fi in, temperate, and impartial His reason for reading the letter was to show that the strike era had really nothing to hold out against It seemed to him very clear indeed why the hotel t to were not interfered with by the Government or the directors There was no question that the three old too anxious to have the matter settled, and there was no question that the Governor. it was anxious to have it settled and it is 113 thought tiytuouittiit after the men had hold out for four or five weeks, the men would probably get a son and go back to work. The lion 111 in ill for Biilinnm, Mr Murphy, went to Broken Hill some week or two ago and he was time for the short period of IS hums Just about that time it was known that arrests a 000 to be made, or there was a strong faith that some arrests would be made Mr Murphy's sympathies were very much with the Htrikun, but how 1 would that hon. member r form 1111 opinion of what was going on at Broken Hill in 48 hours He had known Sub-inspector GituigT for to years and he war incapable of doing an injustice to any 1111 Mr WlntriiitaliL Johnson was that there to administer justice and as far as he knew he did so impartially The question of the bank manager had been referred to, but an ignominious insult w 10 offered to the bank man if. e- before any assault took place. The member for B him was also compared the utter chaos that took, place 111 the Domain with the alleged seditious speeches clean ore 1 at Broken Hill It did not seem to him to be any parallel in the two CISCO The alleged seditious speeches, 11 the facts were true, hero attended immediately and in yards, or about time time, with acts of violence and that was substantial part of the case 'Ibu Domain at cr races were so much claptrap which was to be heard in the Domain any day or two vi ed As to the question of the Government doing,' their duty, he thought they had done their duty, and he was proud to think that they had done what he considered was then duty. He remembered the action of another Government during the last 12 months, when a certain section of the house had to he conciliated He remembered a letter written by the head of that Government to trio posters lists, and he thought it is is 1 most humilia- ting post on for a Government to the up when it was apparent on the face of it that a party him to be council used to keep the Gove resident in police The police magistrate) was removed from Bourke when he was doing his duty and he remembered 200 shearers being taken out of Dunlop without remonstrance on the Port of the Government Mr. LANGWELL there were not 500 men there Mr BOOTH He did not say that port for a wine discs union was not exercised on thatoccison Itsui said that the Government erect d these um sts bedtime 11 motion of censure was pending Dal anyone hear of such a thing' it is is to any thing that could put a Gove meet me minority It three arrests had not taken place the Government would have had a majority 01 11 to-0, which is now Boy would only have a majority of perhaps half a dozen If there was any probablity of the motion being c armed he would say to the leader of the Open position do not pro s, the motion, and he would put himself and his put, and the principles they six seated in a better position before the law-abiding and peaceful citirensbotoio the country than they were over in before Mr COßPY said he did not think he could give a silent vote on that occasion He would like to give a lead of 118 ion oils for opposing the resolution of the roads not the Oi position His chief reason was because the revolution contained two mi3stuonumU who last misstatement which that the Administration had not the con'id'Mico or the House He believed it had the second misstatement was that the Government did not possess the confidence of the country. He said the Government is in the confidence of the country and of the city it had also the confidence of the press it was creditable that some journals had for the time thrown as to the fiscal question and declared themselves in favour of 1 nv and order He bent with very great pain and some humiliation the speech delivered by the lead of the Opposition, and the whole purpose of that speech was to depress me the Premier and to diaper ago but by even possible in rains, and to try and Port ate an still thatched rendered and sea via 11 to the country by his trip to England It struck him as a 111 in - able tin g that co fat nor dy on that twice his son to defend! the Pn mine owing to the Ministry English papers showed that Sir George Dibbs had tendered a distinct service to the country, and 11 letter thistle close to the hut , addressed to the increased the Imperial Iodeiilitiu League, Bto id out as a masterly 1 pointers on the subject the / mann of Un of did June must d that that letter was li most effective of the land that had I to submit to the public The At urn 13 Let team in its August number, speaking at the s one matter, Said bin st world has plainly gave some luipi-"1011 even on our En Club c rules, and the le tons the highest hiiiuiiiuluutuority lil high and, stated that Sir George Dibbs'' letter had landed di percent. stock a percent His visit had wrought such a change from the This lively but there was no th slow and made as to the stability of his 1 iii m securities Ihosevve- distill! t services which could not be over the 1, and 11 sto iii of being' met with a motion of no continence the Premier should I vote leiioiHhothiuil soft libelous 10 Parliament, and the time was not far distant when such a vote would be tarred the country was at the back of the Gov common, and no man who tral called about the colony could fail to see that the upper and middle classes, and even the intelligent lower class, expo r need 110 most intense solicitude as to the b story of the Government One of the charges bioue,htuyuiist thoPicmiorv na that he left for England wittiest the sanction 01 P element, and had it taken ilOOJ to pay li i espouses It was most ending indeed to all the much noise about it and it was only the unscrupulous tactics of the Opposition that had brought that unsavoury subject before the country.

But, taking a mer Oiful view of their CARD, that 0 was still something more important, and that was to show people that, whatever happened, law and order must be upheld. For some days he had been watching with close attention the demeanour of the leader of the Opposi- tion, He expected him to rise and ask to be allowed to with draw his motion with the concurrence of the Home, but he was and that the leader of the Opposition had not that element of greatness in his character Public opinion was at the back of the Government, and the people throughout the country said that the Government was light The Government had simply allowed their officers to carry out the law, and they had allowed the law to take its course those who would destroy the Government at this time gave their vote in favour of disorder All the flour e at Broken Hill had had to over thocoutrict ey On This system prevailed in all the Govern inches deep in titions, and why should it not prevail in mining!' the better class of miners preferred to a 01 k on the contract sy set in, and in a poll were taken to morrow a large majority would he found to be in favour of the contract history Mr R.

In none of the cases quoted was there a parallel to the case under notice They then found the hon. member producing a pnpm in the House, which ought never to have been used unless laid on the table in the ordinary way, in which was areconiniondalionby the late Premier for the appointment of Sir Patrick! Jennings and Sir Robert Wisdom loan Imperial Conference on Defence, but if the hon. member had been honest enough he would have shown a different state of circumstances altogether. Where was the parallel between the act of sending Sir Patrick Jennings and Sir Hubert Wisdom with other representatives of the colonies for this purpose, and this Government paying to one of its own members a sum of -5000 for expenses to England Mr HUlOrilSON The money was paid in the other case without the authority of Parliament Mr GARRARD said that in the case n for all to the House was not sitting, and under such circumstances a Government would not be worth its salt which would not like responsibility But in the present instance the Premier had stated time after time in to some that it was his intention to go to England, but had retired to tell what was the purpose of his visit If he wanted authority Peril i mont would have been glad to have given it if he had been able to make out a case How could Mr store reconcile what they had stated in their speeches in the country with the attitude which the Premier had taken up with respect to the repair most of this money? (Mr CoiErA.Ni) "Thoytild not refer to that matter'') Did not Mr Lyne say that he believed his colleague would refund the motion (Mr COITT_NI> "'That was in the House "2 That was all the better for his purpose, because If the statement was made in the House the excise could not be put forward that there had been misrepresentations in the press In spite of Mr Lyne's assertion, no sooner was the subject brought up in the presence of the Premier than hoBlated. with his usual blunders, that he would see the Gov prominent and his entire wrecked rather than refund one penny of the £1000. Another point was that the representatives of the people should be the first to learn the state of the finances of the country, but instead of this what did they did They found the Minister making a budget speech to the roprtsontativcsof the press, entirely ignoring the House This was one of the things which went to show that, intentionally 01 un intentionally, the present Ministry was continually acting unomstitutlnuully the question before them was whether the Government had the confidence of Parliament or of the people Hovoii tuioitosuy that they had not the confidence and if they like to accept the challenge which had been thrown out they would find that he was right the Ministry was composed of able men, and, except for the blind ring of one or two, were as able a body as could be obtained in the House but when they are found altering the list of policy of "the country, and in tho face of the romance in the Governor B speech with respect to further action till this direction, it was the duty of the Opposition to challenge their position This debate it is not in as gone on for a long time-it li id boo- kept dragging on in order that some members should realise

permit tin on to manipulate votes If the present Government « is in opposition Could they not h refereed a division on the first night I lAnHm Moinbet "So would you if you could ") the Opposition
