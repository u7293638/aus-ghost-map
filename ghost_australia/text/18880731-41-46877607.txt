ENCROACHMENT ON THE PARK LANDS. fSO TffF* XDTTOB. ? Sir— i always Baid it would be so— that as Boon as I left this world they would encroach j on the Park LandB— and I see they have ' begun already to do so. and close to the City- ; know something about it, so I went up and listened to two tram boys talking about it. And one said to the other, 'I say, Bill, ain't the Company awful good to put up this shed for ua to get out ol the sun and wet?' 'Dnnno eo much about that,' says Tom. 'They's liberal on the cheap. They don't pay nothing for this ere land ; and they puts us here to save running two-homo trams and Bave a conductor for each tram also. So it strikes me. Bill, that's a good speck for them — not much goodness about it. I think the-. papers shamed them in doing something for ua poor covies.' Says Bill, ' I Bpose they are going to build a place up at Kermode street, too, for them chaps up there.' ' No* , fear,' BayB Tom, ' they would have to buy or ' rent land there : that wouldn't suit, you bet.'' Oh, dear me, the world seems no better since I left it ; it is still easy enough to be generous, at others expense. Now, Mr. Editor, if that shed remains after this warning from me I will haunt Hia Worship the Mayor and all the Aldexmen and Councillors and the Town Clerk until it is, and if my old friend Samuel Tomkinson doeB not carry oat the trust I leit with him, and do bia best to get it done, £ will haunt him too, bo they had all better look out. I am, Sir, &c;, DAVID GALL'S GHOST,
