AN UNWISE DECISION. SOME timeago His Honor Jlrjfjustice Williams;Sxprfessed a wish that Courts of Petiy Sessions?-wofild'£oifd...8HenderB iu serious cases up for trial ag frequently :as. poaS!ble, jn : ',oraer tbat tbey miglit North ''Melbourne bench - expressed liis' dissent from tliis view, whicli he said: would ; Baddle the country with heavy crimipallaw cost3,but ; His Honor, if lie was icp'oHed arigbt,- ! only meant Ins remarks to apply to desperate clniractors, and not to petty pilferers and backyard tliieves.
