AN IBATE POET. Never, since the days of Pope and Dermis, has anything quite so savage apwired in literature as Mr. Robert Browning's little ode, "To Edward Fitzgerald," published in the last Jtthnurum. Mr. Aldis Wright, in his "Life and Lettere" of the translator of Omar Khayyam, had most incautiously admitted a hasty sentence of the genial "Ktz," ran: —"MM. Browning's death is rather a relief to me. I must say: no more Aurora Leighs, thank G o d A woman of real gemus, " know: but what is the upshot of „ all! She and her sex had better mind the kitchen and the children; and perhaps the poor. Except in such things as little novels, they onlv devote themselves to what men do much better, leaving that whidi men do worse or not at all." Mr. Browning, it seems, lighted on this unlucky passage-never, of course! meajit for the public eye-ond blazed forth into the subjoined volcanic verses :— To EDWAED FLTZ6EEALL>. I chancod upon a new book yesterday; I opened it, and, where my linger lay "fwixt page and uncut page, these words 1 read- Some six or serca at most-ani learned thereby That you, Fitzgerald, whom by ear and eye Bhe never knew, " thank God my wife vra dead. Av, dead! and were yourself alive, p»d Fitz, How to return you thanks would task my wits. Kicking vou seems the common lot of curs •While more appropriate siecting lenda you grace. Surely to spit there glorifies your face- Spitting from lips once aa ctilicd by hers. July 8,1S89. BOBEIIT Buownrea. TanUnieanimis! Should a great poet thus, for a fretfnl phrase, avenge the dead upon the dead, by telling him who was tiie "best friend" of Lord Tennyson, and author, in the way of translation, of the " one thing done divinely well," that his ghost is not good enough to spit at ? Mr. Aldis Wnght has certainly much to answer for.
