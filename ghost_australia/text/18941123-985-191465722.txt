The Tale of ike Witch of Endor. Of all Bible stories none is more popular with, children than the tale of the Witch of Endor. On wet Sunday afternoons the most admired plate in the folio Bible is that which shows Saul falling forward on the earth, and the witch woman shrinking back in astonishment and awe, and the white-bearded, shadowy figure of the Pro phet rising up from the silence of Sheol. The woman of Endor is beloved by contro versial infancy, just launched uncon sciously, on the stream of Biblical criti cism, and pleading against the verdict of parent or nurse for the existence of ghosts and witches. The early syllogism runs thus: The Bible is true. The Bible says there were a witch and a ghost. Therefore, there are ghosts aiid witches. We often meet with worse arguments in later life, as when Science avers : " I don't take any interest in the ques tion,' with the suppressed inference," there fore there is nothing in it but nonsense." Our instructors in our infancy, however, met our logic with pleas more subtle, though not wholly satisfying. Thus, " There were witches, or at least there was a witch, but that was before the coming of the Gospel. So now run away and see if you can find a ripe strawberry." Thus was the daring metaphysical specu lation of infancy diverted into practical researches. Or again, * the answer would be, " Saul was a bad man, and therefore the devil was allowed to deceive him in the shape of Samuel." "It does not say anything about the devil, and the ghost's prophecy came true." " Oh, no doubt that was per mitted for wise reasons. So now run away," ut supra. â€”Andrew Lang, in the j CONTEMPORARY EeVTEW.
