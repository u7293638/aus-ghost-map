Eb passed into, the well-lighted shanty first,. but Bill.stopped at the door, holding the canvas in, his hand, and his face became ghastly pale as he-saw a. young woman behind the rudely-constructed counter ; she was laughing loudly, and:bandying jests -with.the diggers of a none too delicate cha. rcter.- What innocence had ever shone in her contennance had fled, and she bore the :faded-and brazen look that distinguishes so any'of.ber' clasn..bu'; she was still fair to look upon.

'f What! : Didn't Bill follow me P' asked lb. in surprise. "Never showed his nose inside this shan. ty." answered the man. Eb hurried over to Baldy's, the man who served the diggers with groceries. No Bill there. He was not at theirtent. Eb could find him nowhere, and with a white face and misgiving in his heart, he returned to the ehanty. .All tlhatfearful., night he and two others searched; but ear nothing of the miss in man. TTwas not till seven o'clock next morning that they found his body in Yellow Creek, stark dead. How he-had got there no one knew. Eb's grief knew-no bounds; he kissed the cold face,' and sobbed like a child. -How Bill could- have got into the creek they wondered as they carried him to Iac's. He knew every inch of the country, and could not have come there by accident. It must have been suicide, or the slippery hature of the bridge. As they entered the shanty, the new barmaid was serving a cus tomer. Her eyre rsted for a moment on the dead face, then'with'a shriek she dropped the bottle from her nerveless fingers, and rushing out, fell on her knees by the body. She clasped the face between her hands, and, kissing it madly, murmured-." Willie ! Willie! Willie!" No -need of cbujectdres now; she was his Ellen. Her story assoon fold. Beedming weary of waiting for letters which never- came, she had at length determined to follow her lover. : After some trouble, she -succeeded in getting a- passage third-class. Bad com panions on the ship was the first step to ruin, and by the time she arrived she had fallen. She could get no knowledge of her betrothed in Melbourne, nor in fact did she reek him, for, lost as she was, she could not have faced him. Alone and helpless, in a strange place, she turned to some of her ship companions; their assistance could be had only under certain cireumstances. Bad led to worse, but not being thoroughly de praved, she snucceeded in getting employ ment, which, at any rate, was better than her previous life. \- Sh-eleft 1Olsarhcog;gaen ,ainaee.:ier - burial, and what became of her is a mystery, like so many of the old goldfield romances. Eb also left shortly afterwards, the remem brance of his drowned mate's face haunting him for many years. Whether Willie Wright committed suicide or accidentally fell into the creek is another mystery. It is quite possible the unfortunate fellow may have slipped on the treacherous bridge, and in his despair and utter wretchedness pro bably never even made a strnggle to sare himself.
