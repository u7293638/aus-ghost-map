The Mao lean Ghost Mystery Solved. "A PALPABLE GHOST." The public cannot but remember all the ghostly apparitions that have disturbed a home situated on the heights of the classic town of Maclean. On Friday evening last the lady of this romantic home accompanied a visiting lady on an evening walk. The happy ladies had just returned as the sun was sinking into the west ern seas, and in looking for some vestas one of them, to her great sur prise, laid her hand upon the nose of a new boarder. There they found a particularly ugly man in bed, his bead resting on a pillow gently smoothed down, and just about to practice chromatic pieces on his nose. One of the ladies succeeded in fainting, the other began a cloture movement by sealing the doors and putting two blackfellows on guard, while a third went for the police. The police ar rived, and said in a familiar voice, *' Is that you Bill ?" The reply was | .' Yes." After a brief explanation, the unwelcomed guest was taken to to the lockup, and was afterwards sentenced to a period of seven days. The wonderful difference in the presence or mind of both ladies can not be overlooked. While one was fainting, the other was making pre parations for a capture. If" Bill" had the intention of developing into a mid night ghost, won Id bis apparition be visible so early in the evening, unless ha were of unsound mind at that par ticular lime of day ? It would seem as if all the ghost scares of the past had developed into a sensible reality in the presence of this graceful stranger. It seems bard that he should , be disturbed from bis peaceful slum ber, and that he should pay a penalty of seven days for a bed occupied for so short a lime. Many people think that those seven days retreat wilt put an end to the Heart troubles, and that a big victory baB been scored against ghosts in general.-Exchange.
