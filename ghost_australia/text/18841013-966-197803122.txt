VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. [By Telegraph. | [From our own .Reporter. J Melbourne, October 12. The weather during the last few days has been dead against outdoor sports of all kinds. Since I arrived on Wednesday we have had rain every day, and as there are still no signs of it clearing up the tracks are not likely to be fitfor fast work before the middle of the week. The soil at Caulfield is sandy, and when racing began on Saturday the ground was still in fair going order, but before the Hurdle Race a drenching shower fell, and delayed the start some time. Afterwards it came on again, and before the Guineas was run the going was so soft that the horses sank in it up to their fetlocks. The attendance was better than was to have been expected considering the weather, but few ladies ventured out. As might be expected, the day was disastrous to backers, the victory of Sandal in the Guineas being a great throw in for the ring, as Mr. Gordon's filly was supjposed to be dead off, and I have not heard of a Bingle winner on the race. Of course excuses are made for the defeated favourites on the score of the going being against them, but neither Rufus, Tremando, nor David was in it at any part of the race, and although Gratitude and Helene ran well Sandal seemed to me to win with plenty in hand. The triumph of the daughter of Winterlake is only another instance of the glorious uncertainty of racing. Ten days ago she did a gallop good enough to win any mile race, but was so Eore afterwards that Dalton was unable to do anything with her until the day before the race, when she came out and ran five furlongs. Apparently the enforced spell was just what the filly wanted, and her action being admirably suited to heavy going she robbed Adelaide backers of a good win by settling the pretensions of Helene and Gratitude in very easy style. The good field of sixteen faced the starter for the Maiden Plate, and as The Bey was greatly fancied by the St. Albans stable he was made a 6 to 4 chance. In the race he was never prominent, however, and with Duration and Norfolk coming right away at the turn the latter stayed the longer and won a fine race by a short neck. Yately, who was looking in splendid form, was backed at even money when the betting opened on the Hurdles, but a good many followers of Corrigan put money down so freely for Tantaliser that the grey became easier in the market. Of the others Scobeloff was the only one backed for much money. The start was delayed some time, owing to the rain. When the flag fell Batty quickly took Yately to the front, and at the first hurdle Scobeloff got mixed up in the crowd and fell. All along the back stretch Yately was prominent, but two hurdles from home he blundered, and this mishap gave Sinking Fund an advantage, which the grey could not make up again, though he came very fast in jumping the final hurdles. Owing to the rain little was seen of the youngsters engaged in the Great Foal Stakes, but as young Wilson was very confident, about Ringmaster he was made favourite, and after shaking off Ocista at the distance he won handsomely. i Lady Adelaide slipped down, and Boase appeared to get a nasty fall, but he quickly recovered. The twelve candidates for the Guineas were all saddled under the sheds, and nothing seen of them"until they took their preliminary. The friends of Rufus seeired to think the race a moral, and the Williamstown colt came to 7 to 4, while at the last moment there was a run upon Tremando and David, and the betting done in the paddock was almost confined to these three, the friends of Helene and Gratitude not caring about the weather for their fillies. The race is fully described elsewhere, and it is only necessary to say that Gratitude and Sandal were in front half a mile from home, with Helene third, and that while the race was confined to these Adelaide fillies the two that were fancied were beaten every yard of the way by the despised outsider Sandal. The form displayed by Rufus. Tremando, David, and Leporello was very bad, and the Derby certainly looks very like a moral for Bargo. The Findon Harriers' Vase was a splendid contest, nearly all the horses jumping grandly in the mud, led bv Yankee Grab nearly all the way ; and Mr. Filgate says he had the race won when the horse blundered at the last fence, and left Chieftain to beat the ancient Abdallah in the run home. Meteor was served up very warm for the Toorak Handicap, but he had not the ghost of a chance with Precious Stone when it came to racing. As the result of the latter's victory his stable companion Coulston jumpad to 4 to 1 for the Caulfield Cup. Martini-Henry did a splendid gallop yesterday, and will probably come into the market for the Caulfield Cup. The following are the results :— MAIDEN PLATE, Of 100 sovs., added to a sweepstakes of 3 sovs. each. For maiden horses, 3 years old and upwards. Special weights—3 yrs.. 7 st. 7 lb.; 4 yrs., 8 st. 5 lb.; 5 yrs. and upwards, 8 st. 8 lb. One mile. Mr. J. G. Eeid'sb.h. Norfolk, 5yrs., by Stockwell— Fleetwing (J. Williams) l Mr. A. E.

The Bey, C to 1 Norfolk, 7 to 1 each Capri and Conjecture, 8 to 1 Duration, 10 to 1 the others. f From an indifferent start Pole Star and\asco were the first to show, the last to get off being Conjecture. When they settled down Pole Star took up the running from Vasco, and Peut-Ctre, with Metal, Norfolk, and Mozart following, and the favourite leading the others. At the turn Vasco joined Pole Star, and Metal took third place just clear of Norfolk, Duration, and Peutetre, with the favourite still lying off. Entering the straight Peut-Ctre was leading; but Duration quickly joined her, and entering the rails he and Norfolk came right away, a fine racs home ending in favour of Norfolk by half a neck Three lengths off Vasco just beat Peut- Otre for third place, and then came Vernet and The Bey, with Pole Star and Carbuncle bringing up the rear.

Yately, 3 to 1 Tantaliser, Cto 1 Scobeloff, 7 to 1 Star, 10 to 1 Sinking Fund. Directly the flag fell Yately went to the front and led Sinkirg Fund and Concord over the first hurdle, the others following in close order, with the exception of Scobeloff, who fell. Passing the Stand Yately and Sinking Fund were making play, and they led round the turn and up the hill from Dawdler, Tattler, and Star, wil-h Western and Belle Brandon in the rear. Going along the back stretch Yately drew out from Sinking Fund, but he was soon joined by Tantaliser, with Dawdler, Star, and Concord well placed. There was no change rounding the far turn, but at the half-mile post Tantaliser arid t-inking Fund reached the favourite, who blundered at the next hurdle and lost his place. Tantaliser and Sinking Fund then came on together and jumping the last hu'dle were together, but on lai ding binking Kund got away, and Yately coming again a good race home resulted in binking Fond winning by a length, with Tantaliser the same distance eff third. Then came Tattler. Star and Bel.e Brandon in the order named. Time 3 min 1 sec. ' GREAT FOAL STAKES, Mr. J. Wilson's br.c. Ringmaster, by First King— Yardley (Mcore) j Mr. J. Whittingham's ch.f.

After a good deal of delay at the post, cause*! by the fractiousness of Ri gmaster, the flag dropped to a pretty good start, the first to begin being Cloth of Gold, Carew, and Naroween, with Umbra and Ringmaster close handy, while the last two off were Ocista and Lady Adelaide. Coming down the bend Carew and. Naroween were in front from Umbra and Ringmaster, but Ocista ran up to the leaders entering the stiaight, Carew dropping out. Ringmaster and Ocista came on together to the distance, where Ringmaster strode away and won by a length and a half. Umbra was bea'en by a neck for second place, First Prince was fourth, with Merry Xmas, Sauvignon, and Carew next, and Gasburner last. Lady Adelaide fell at the turn. Time, 654 sec. Yr.

Betting—2 to 1 agst. Rnfus, 6 to 1 Helene, 8 to 1 each Gratitude, (Tremando, and David, 10 to 1 Merrimu, 12 to 1 Leporello, 20 to 1 Sandal, Rebus, Bohemian and Pilot. They were kept at the post for some little time owing to Bohemian showing temper and refusing to join his horses. When the signal was given ft was to a somewhat uneven start, the first to jump away being Rebus, Gratitude. Pilot, and Sandal, while three that got off very badly were Tremando, Leporello, and Bohemian. As soon as they settled into their places Rebus took a clear lead of Gratitude, with Sandal leading Pilot. A batch consisting of Merrimu, Sirocco, Rufus, and Helene came nest, while the rear was being brought up by David and Tremando. They ran in this order along the back of the course, but before the railway turn was reached Williamson took Gratitude up to Rebus, and the Sydney filly at once gave way. Sandal here took second place, with Sirocco, Merrimu, and Bebus just clear of Helene, whose colours on the inside were now to be seen deserting the company of Rufus. As they raced along the bend Sandal took ber place by the side of Gratitude, and the pair came away at a great pace, while Helene, who had set all sail in pursuit of the leaders at the half-mile post, was now rapidly leaving Sirocco and Merrimu. Before reaching the turn Sandal had her head in front, and as they swept into the straight the race was seen to be simply a matter of staying home for the outsider, as Williamson and McGrade were hard at work on Gratitude and Helene, while Trahan was sitting still on Sandal, and bar the three Adelaide fillies there was nothing in the race. At the distance Gratitude made a desperate effort to get on terms, but though he struggled very gallantly Sandal always had the verdict in hand, and won easily at the finish by two lengths. Helene, who ran as true as steel, was steadied when pursuit became hopeless, and finished three lengths behind Gratitude._ Some distance away Sirocco was fourth, with David fifth, and then came the disgraced avourite and Tremando, the last two being Pilot and Leporello.

The start took place at the top of the straight, and the lot came to the brush fence in front of the Stand at a great pace, the leaders being Yankee Grab, Barcoo and Banyenong. They allgot overthis safely, and as they swept round the turn Mr. Filgate took Yankee Grab to the front, and led Barcoo and Banyenong np the hill to the first fence. Here the foiling began, but the leaders all stood up and Yankee led them along the back of the course, the most prominent of the others being Barcoo, Banyenong, Abdallah, Syphon, Clown, and Chieftain, who were Tunning in very close company about three lengths behind the white • faced chesnut. Yankee Grab kept his place over the treble in front of the Stand, and went np the hill with a clear lead of Chieftain, Abdallah, and Syphon, the others being headed by The Clown and Barcoo. Three-quarters of a mile from home Abdallah and Chieftain closed on Yankee, but the cbescut shot away again, and held a clear lead at the sod wall, where Syphon was second. After jumping this Syphon made a run at the leader, the j: air coming away from the others ; but at the last fence Syphon fell, and Yankee, who strnck hard, slipped upon the landing side and got rid of his rider. This mishap left Abdallah in front, but as soon as it came to racing on the flat Chieftian passed him, ai>d holding his own easily in the run home, he won by three lengths. The Clown was a moderate thiid, with the others straggling in at long intervals. There were a number of falls, but no one was hurt.

The flag dropped to a moderate start, the most prominent in the jump-off being Meteor, Josepbiue, Permit, Precious Stone, and Don Quixote, while Lesbia and Ironhand were last. Af ,er going a hu: dred yards Muscat and Meteor settled down in front from Josephine and Permit, but the latter took up the Tunning as they ran along the back of the course, and rounding the far turn he w^s closelv attended by Muscat, Meteor, and Countryman, with Prodigal and Precious Stone heading the main body. Countryman joined Permit at the half-mile post, and then came Meteor and Ghost, with Prodigal and Precious Stone next, but before reaching the turn Meteor and Prodigal came away, followed by Precious fctone, and Meteor shaking off Prodigal he appeared to have the rare won entering the straight, but at the distance Precious Stone challenged, and quickly settling the Tasmanian he won easily by two lengths. Prodigal was a length behind Meteor, and then came Musical, Countryman, Acolyte, and Don Quixote in clo=e order, the last three being Xantippe, Irralee, and Ironhand.
