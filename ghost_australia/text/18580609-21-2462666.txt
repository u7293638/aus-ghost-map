TASMANIAN RIFLE CLUB.-Yesterday afternoon a meeting of this Club was held at the Union Club Hotel, Murray-street. The meeting was convened for four o'clock, but it was nearly five before the members assembled, when Mr. C. B. Brewer, on the motion of the Hon. T. Y. Lowes, M.LC., was voted to the chair. Mr. W. Carter, jun, the Secretary, explained what had been already done, and read drafts of circulars to the Officer Commanding the Troops and the Deputy Military Storekeeper, request- ing their patronage of the Club, and the use of the target ground for ball practice. Draft circulars were also read addressed to the Rifle Clubs at Sydney, Melbourne, and Geelong, soliciting cooperation and copies of their respective rules and regulations. The several drafts were approved of, and the Secretary was requested to communicate with the parties. On the motion of Mr. G. J. Neill, seconded by Mr. J. T. Coram, it was resolved that a subscription list be opened for the purpose of defraying the preliminary expenses attendant on the formation of the Club, and that the subscriptions paid by members be placed to the credit of those individuals. The motion was unanimously carried. Fourteen guineas were subscribed in the room, and fifteen additional names were added to the members of the Club. The Subscription Lists were directed to be left at the Banks for signature. A vote of thanks having been awarded to the Chairman, the meeting separated. THE "IRON DUKE " on THE DISCIPLINE of THE EAST INDIA COMPANY'S ARMY - [A D. 1798.] From the promotion being general throughout the line in Bengal, and from the consequent practice of removing officers from one corps to another whenever they please, not only the army is not disciplined, but it is much more expensive than it would be otherwise. The Infantry there consists of three regiments of Europeans, and, at present, fourteen regiments of Sepoys. These are distributed almost equally in six stations ; whereby three are in Bengal and Bahar, where the troops get half batta; one in Benares, where they get full batta; and two in Oude, where they get double full batta. The stations in Bengal and Bahar make detachments to different places, where full batte is likewise given. The staff of every army is taken indiscriminately from its line, and every corps gives a part to it. In every army each corps has a number of officers absent from ill health or on furlough, or for other causes. In the Bengal army, from the practice of removing officers from their corps when they desire it, the regiments in Bengal and Bahar have all the staff posted to them; all the sick, and all those on furlough. Those in Benares and in Oude have nearly all the effective officers of the army ; even those who remain posted to a regiment within the provinces are detached; and it is not uncommon to see a regiment at one of the lower stations without an officer excepting the com- manding officer, who always receives full batta, and the adjutant and quartermaster, who receive very large allowances ; so that upon the whole it may be said, with but few exceptions, that every officer in the Company's service present in Bengal receives either full or double full batta, or is upon the staff. The expense, therefore, is enormous. If they were per- manently posted to their regiments, and if the promo- tion were regimental, the staff, the sick, and the fur- lough would fall equally, or nearly so, among them all; there would be a certain number of officers pre- sent with the corps stationed within, as well as with those stationed without, the provinces ; and thus not only would the army be better disciplined, but nearly one-third of the expense of batta would be saved.

COLONIAL DISTILLATION.-The Report of the Com- mittee of the Legislative Council, appointed in 1838, on the subject of Distillation, which was laid on the Table of the House by the Colonial Treasurer in February lest, and ordered to be printed, has been issued from the Government Printing-office. It will be in the recollection of many subscribers to tho Courier at that period, that the Board reported in favour of substantial prohibition, one of the grounds being that the lower orders of the population would cease to be imposed upon, as they then were, by adulterated and deleterious mixtures. AUSTRALIAN FLOWERS.-The native rose has the colour, but no other resemblance to the European queen of flowers. It is one of the few field-flowers possessing any odour. Wafted on the passing gale, it commends itself pleasantly to the senses; bat, strange enough, on closer acquaintance, there mingle* with the rich perfume an undoubted smell of fox-a scent which, however productive of rapture in ' the field.' is hardly adapted to the boudoir. In the low lands of the Botany scrub 1 noticed a crimson and orange flower, like the foxglove in form, very hand-, some, but so hard and horny in texture that tha blossoms actually ring with a clear metallic sound as the breeze shakes (hem.

BORBOWEO PLUM as.-Like the bird in JEsop's fable, the vanity of the Mercury hu led him to assume that the matter of " absenteeism" wu first brought before ' the publio in that journal. If ba had taken the, trouble to ascertain the truth before he bad made tho" assertion, he wonld have found that the same subject has been urged upon the attention of the publio many years in the columns of the Courier. In charity We assume the writer in the Mercury to be ignorant of the fact, although the system of " bonne* " lately adopted, by the proprietary wonld warrant ns in" believing the contrary. He stoops to every, device) to depreciate all his contemporaries, but we maintain too respectable a position in the newspaper world to care for more than to expose his arrogant presumption to the public gaze. < ' ' s / í f INSOLVENT COUBT.-At a Court'before the Commis- sioner thts day, a first meeting of creditors was holden in the insolvency of B.

In connestion with this subject it Was also resolved, that the City Surveyor hare orders to employ additional hands to expedite the completion of the Slaughter-house, and the Public Works' Com- mittee were requested to carry out the resolution. The Acting Mayor informed the Council that they were in a condition to return £500 to the Government on account of the money borrowed for police purposes, and they were also ready to receive £500 on account of the Government grant After ballot, the new Slaughter-houses were allotted to the following applicants:-Propsting, 7; Austin, 7; Sherwiu, 7; Willing, 7 ; Pregnell, 6 ; M'Cracken, 6 ; Fearnley, 6 ; W.

THE LAUNCESTON DEPUTATION.-Mr. Alderman Allison stated at the last meeting of the Launceston Municipsl Corporation, that upon examination of the requisition of the electors, he found that thr number of ratepayers, including the new bounda- ries, was 2024, whilst the signatures to the address, even supposing all to be those of ratepayers, numbered only 1010. He fouud that of the 1010 there were «313 to whom he was in no way responsible, as they bad become ratepayers only lately by the extension of the boundaries. They never expressed confidence in him, and therefore could not have lost it Out of the 1010 there were 397 persons whose names were on the roll at tho last election. Of these, 113 did not Toto for him ; 377 votes were recorded in his favour on that occasion : he took the number of those who had changed their opinion with reference to himself at 142, and he found that there remained 1235 persons who had not expressed any want of confaV dence in bim. At the last election only one-half of the ratepayers voted. Finding, therefore, that the signatures to the address did not include a majority of the whole, constituency either at the election or at the present moment, and that they did not inolude either a majority of those who voted at the last election or of those who voted for himself personally, he felt it to be his duty to the electors to retain hu office.

THE Lair or LIBEL.-The following is a copy of the Lord Chief Justice Campbell's new Bill to amond . the law of libel : -" Whereas it is expedient further to amend the law respecting libel: be it therefore enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons, in this present Parlia- ment assembled, and by the authority of the same as follows : -1. No person shall be liable to action, infor- mation or indictment for libel in respect or on account of the publication of any faithful report of proceedings at any sitting of either House of Parliament at which strangars have been permitted to be present a In an action foran alleged libel it shall be competent to the defendant, in addition to any other plea which he may now lawfully plead, to plead in bar of the said action that the alleged libel is the repoit or part of the report of the proceedings of a publio meeting lawfully assembled for a lawful purpose, and that the said report is a faithful report of the said proceedings of the said publio meeting, and that the plaintiff has sustained no loss or damage by the publication of the asid alleged libel. 3.

CORONER'S INQUEST. -A jury, of which Mr. Henry Evans, baker, was foreman, met before W. Gunn, Esq., Coroner, at the "Dolphin Inn," yesterday, to enquire respecting the death of a child four years old, of a work- man at the Piper River Saw-Mill, named John Ware. It appeared that the child accidentally got on the tramway at the mill; the waggon came along, and one of the wheels passed over the lower part of the leg.

Mr. Brewer appeared for Rogers, and Mr. Moriarty for Brian, both of whom pleaded not guilty. Rogers was fined twenty shillings and the case against Brian was dismissed. POLICE DEPARTMENT.-Mr. Thomas Faioe lins been appointed District Constable at Avoca, vice Mr. James Knox. TOWN PROPERTY.-Messrs. Worley and Frodsham submitted to auction yesterday, June 8, 1858, oft the premises, Murray-street, two houses, the property of Mrs. Harriet Bonney. An inconvenience of right of way for mutual accommodation was the chief obstruc- tion to the sale. .The highest offer iii accordance with conditions of sale, was £700 for each property, considered by the owner below market value, and therefore not disposed of. This day, June 9, 1858. Messrs. Worley and Frodsham sold by auotion at their Mart, the property at Sandy Bay known as the Baths, including both the Baths on the Beach and the House recently occupied by Mr. Champ. The purchaser wu Mr. Waterhouse for £900. A portiou of the Und,' that occupied by the Baths and pier, was granted for a term of 30 years from 1842 at a peppercorn rent, and liable under a particular event to he annulled an event, however, soarcely likely to happen. An allotment on the King's Road of 30 feet by 125wu sold also for £38 ; and several other allotments were offered, but the company evinced no desire to bid. Messrs. W. and F. submitted also the property known as the Queenborough Arms, which from having been leased for ten years at £60 per annum, rendered it unsaleable to an investor at the price expected by the owner, and the public-house not being sold, the cottage in the rear wu withdrawn. At both sales there wu a good attendance of monied men, besides the usual number of indifferent observ- ers ; and it may be anticipated that sales of property will be mora readily effected when sellers and buyers better understand the marketable and times value of the samo.
