THE BISHOP OF BALLARAT. A very large congregation assembled at Christ Church, South Yarra, yesterday morning, to hear the Right Rev. Dr. Thornton, Anglican Bishop of Ballarat, deliver his first sermon in Victoria The service was conducted by the Rev. W. N. Guinness and the Rev. H. P. Kane The Bishop chose as his text the three following passages -Luke m 12 Master what shall we do! Acts xvii 30 Sirs what must I do? and Acts ix G Lord what wilt Thou have me to do ? He said " The question you observe in each passage is substantially the same What shall I do' asked by human souls in earnest of their spiritual guide Under such circumstances what a momento is question it is how practical I how appropriate 1 0 to hear it asked more often I Surely it is one of the chief functions of the Christian Church and of the Christian teacher to elicit to stand late and to deal with this great question That sermon seems to me best attuned to the keynote of an apostle s or an evangelist a which wrings the anxious inquiry from stirred and eager hearts What must I do and then helps them to the true reply But the question when it comes may evidence very different states of heart and life in those that ask it and it is to the different aspects under which this same question may be regarded as suggested by my tears namely as the inquirers question the convert a question and the saint a question that I want to draw your attention 1 Our first text carries us away to the wilder- ness of Judea where beside the rushing river out among the robbers and wild beasts a bronzed uncouth preacher has drawn immense crowds to hear him A strange grand man this teacher of religion scorning the indulgences and ambitions of the world reckless of its power or favour lifting up no political standard working no miracle yet awakening a ferment-an enthusiasm perfectly amazing He was a burning light a crying voice and whether from curiosity or anxiety-a mighty multitude in which no class of men seems to represented throngs around him eager to learn Ina office and to hear his errand This interest this inquiry it is precisely his function to awaken The welcomes be baptised all the fan is not in his hand But in words of awful plain ness be warns them of wrath to come he Scatters their delusions e pours contempt on the worthless religionists of the day t li Scribe and Pharisee turn from him in disgust with the verdict He hath a deal, while crowds aroused to a new sense of their ignorance their an their need press for ward to receive the symbolic right of disciple ship and muse in their hearts on the great problems of human duty What shall we do thou' - Master what shall we do' Now what counsel did the Baptist give them a Very practical homely counsel He spoke of the second table of the com mandments He attacked their prevailing Bins He told them to give up bad habits and try to be better Many of them like Borne of us lived only for money getting He taught them to learn the joy of making sacrifices and to be generous to the poor Many of them notably the Government officials were in the habit of petty frauds and exactions He charged them to boBtrictly dust in their accounts both towards the tax payer and their cmi lovers The soldiers asked their duty and he bade them cease to he a scourge to the neighbourhood through which they marched and give up the violent and mutinous practices which were the bane of military life My friends such teaching was admirably suited to the case of those inquirers It resembles that of Christ Himself before His hour came to unfold and accomplish the atoning work of His i nation And to be interested about duty to listen anxiously for such counsels as there was a very hopeful symptom in these disciples Such listeners in any age are not far from the kingdom of God Let others if they will disparage the ethical and civilians in fineness of religious teachings for one can never do so It is no small thing if the sensual man be so far won by the preacher as to leave his vice if the irreligious be led to the house of worship the dishonest be taught rectitude the thoughtless be prevailed upon to recognise God in family devo- tion the selfish to interest himself in bone scent schemes And it is preliminary effect of sound religious teaching wherever faith fully given will be prone uniformly to main feEt itself-that the withdrawal of such in fairness will tell grief oual) on the moral and Social condition of any community V general anxiety about duty is not the full ripe fruit indeed of the gospel tree but it is its hopeful blossom We may well be thankful for the twilight albeit we will not mistake it for the blaze of noon No for neither the question of John s disciples nor his answer good as they were so far as they went war enough If they had been his baptism would never have been superseded If they had been Calvary would have been super Huons and Pentecost unnecessary Our Bibles might have ended at the 8th of St Matthew iv hore virtually for some religious teachers they scorn to end But mankind not only needs instruction about keeping, the second table of God's law it needs to he set to rights about the first It does not need improvement only-it wants re generation Men must not merely to come disciples they must be made con vorts John the Baptists teaching was and tourable but it was preparatory and impor feet only It would yield soul rest and satisfaction to no single child of man Greatest as he was of woman born so that was least in the kingdom of Heaven By w greater than he for what is John and his baptism without a crucified and risen Christ 2 Consider then in the next place how the question What shall I do was asked again a few years later on after the wonders of Calvary and Pentecost had been once for all enacted Two gospel preachers lay in chains in an underground dungeon at 1 Philippi their missionary work had been suddenly interrupted in the streets by a furious outbreak of fanaticism not religious fanaticism but what is equally or more deadly fanatic secularism they had been unloosing souls from the grip of the evil one and human greed bad are reminded that if they went forward the hope of its gains was gone These men was the cry are troubling our city They turn the world upside down, They teach customs contrary to the decrees of C csar-not lawful for us to receive being Romans This is enough the truth of these men message was also gether beside the purpose Stripped and beaten the are thrust into an inner call their feet Hcrovved in the cruel stocks their wrists with chains to the wall And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God and the prisoners heard them Then came not exactly an earthquake as one version has it but a Shaking as of that house at Jerusalem when God visited the praying church All the doors are opened and every man a bands are loosed for it is not merely the Apostles that are to be liberated-the miracle is to be s> 11 house of what their message can do for every fun bound soul the gaoler waking sets the doors open an! concludes at once that his prisoners are lied for which the gaoler a punishment was always death. It is a case of despair His sword is out and in another instant his own hand would have anticipated his fate but for St 1 had a presence of mind conspicuous on this season so many occasions We are all born he abouts and the gaoler seeing the latest rushes down and finds it true He feels at once that he is in the presence of more than mortal power and overwhelmed with the terror which contact with the support it was must over inspire in the fallon h era in heart he leads them up tremblingly into the prison court and thou the question bursts from his lips, What must I do to be saved I -his consciences awakened to his own personal guilt must - the question is vital let him know the means of deliver ance whatever it cost awed for although safe as regards his prisoners and his life he is conscious of other and awful danger-yea he feels ruined-lost ! It as the most, urgent conceivable of questions and bow thrilling bow cheerio, to those preachers to hear it from the heathens Japan Sir what must I do to be saved ? ' What must I do ? It seems the same old question put to John the Baptist but it was differently answered here The questioner was one who needed it might be thought advice about his duty to his neighbours quite as much as those soldiers and publicans who consulted John Yet that was not the answer that was given him and such an answer would have been quite unsuited to the case Such instruction came afterwards no doubt in the conversation which for lowed and would then have been in its proper place, but this man wanted horse ditto relief under a present sense of helpless guilt before God, and it would have been memory to point him to the sixth command ment or the eighth to bid him cease from cruelty for the future or try to be pure in life and contented with his station No they told thiS trembler the word of the Lord -the message of the Gospel that simple old familiar message that summed up all his case required Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and the same of the household " How direct, how practical They meet his "I with a "thou," his must with a "shalt" his "do" with a believe in Christ" For "believing" is doing " "This is the work of God," said our Lord, " that ye believe in Him whom He hath sent " Believing in Christ is emphatically an act an act of the entire man, when by one simultaneous, complex movement of the whole soul-his understanding, his heart, his will-he apprehends, loves, and renders himself up to the Saviour who is presented to him. There is no more thorough an action for a man to perform than this, and the grief is that men will not perform it. There is just something to do to be saved, and men do it not. The fountain is pointed out, and they will not, with Hagar, go and drink at it and live , the Jordan is there, but they will not, with Naaman, go and wash and be clean. "Ye will not come unto Me," was the Lord's account of the matter, that ye might have life ' But this gaoler, by God's mercy, did and he had it "He believed in God," it is said Instead of a mere disciple, he proved a convert, instead of an inquirer, a believer. We do not marvel at reading further, and he rejoiced " Of course he did. I Joy is born of faith To be interested about our duty is good, out often loaveausvery unhappy Believing in Christ for ourselves fills the month with songs of praise There are many, it has been truly said, who have only enough religion to make them miserable. If they would dare to do as the gaoler did, they would be rejoicing with him in all the comfort of forgiveness Let those who are asking annously the gaoler's question-and they are more in number than we think Team another lesson from this heathen, and " believe in God," and believing, rejoice with the joy unspeakable, receiving the end of their faith, even the salvation of their souls Oh to get men across from interest to down right faith, from being listeners to being believers, from the attitude of the inquirer to that of the decided convert, from skittish, wherelsraellayinactive.looklngacross Jordan at their inheritance, to Gilgal, where Joshua led them forth from the camp to smite the sons of the Anakies, and conquer the land of rest and plenty ! How many are craving to be conducted thither, and how good and pleasant a thing it is to deal the glad mind of God's love abroad in all its freedom and fulness, proclaiming not only " God commandeth all men everywhere to repent,' but also we pray you in Christ's stead to go reconciled to God' "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved But another text is waiting for us now, and I would introduce it by inquiring, Has a man who has true and Having faith no question more to ask' What is the nature of this third and last demand, and by whom and under what circumstances was it made Lord, what wilt thou have me to do' We have several instances of instantaneous conversion recorded in Scripture, and it is noticeable that they proved to be spiritual transformations of a specially complete and triumphant sort Think of the dying male factor-to what a depth of genuine humility he attained in that his hour of anguish on the cross, what clear views he acquired of Christ's character and work ; how eager was his sat for his Masters honour and his fellow's good , how intense and far reaching were his faith and hope ! So with St Paul Of course it may be conjectured with probability that God's spirit had been striving with him ever since Stephen's dying words had rung in his ears, and that his special madness against the church only evidenced the violence of the struggle that was going on in a conscience vainly grappling with the hard task of kicking against the pricks In his conversion it might be urged, as a most, there was an antecedent preparatory work which culminated in the final crisis just as the first balmy sunburst of the English spring forces out of their hiding places a thousand leaflets upon the forest bougliB, just because they have been forming for weeks past in secret, in expectation of the moment which should give them birth Whether this was so in the apostle's case or not, the suddenness of his change remains a marvel still, when we note with what amazing speed it seemed to have ripened to maturity. The stages through which many are slowly passed he cleared, as it were, at a bound, and became a believer as soon as he had avowed himself an inquirer aye, and a saint as soon as he was a convert His con version was like Bunnee in the tropics there was no twilight, no dawning. To change the figure his course seems like the moon as we see it on some clear calm night half of it dimly outlined to the careful view, but dark and rum, and then beyond a sharp, well defined line, all glow and brightness, such as the eye aches to gaze upon What was that sharp line in St Paul s history, that day when God revealed His son-in him' Hurled into the dust, ha cried to that light which shone above him and said, " Who art Thou Lord ' And when the heavenly voice replied, Paul there and then accepted Christ fully as his master, without a doubt, without a qualm, without a thought of delay. His conversion not only began then it seemed con- summated and filled with the Holy Ghost, three days afterwards he was preaching Christ, with telling effect, up and down Damascus his question, when you weigh it well, is the saints question-a formula of entire and absolute surrender-the watch word not of anxiety merely, nor of faith onlj.butofcompleteself consecration, Lord what what Ihouhavome to do' Crucified with Christ, Paul no longer lived it was Christ who lived in him " What wilt Thou what he himself wished was nothing to Paul thenceforward that the pleasure of the Lord should prosper was henceforth his ruling passion, whatever it might cost We know how-his question was ultimately answered, "I will show him how great things he must suffer." His was the grandest life of self sacrifice ever lived, next to his Master's Oh, my fellow Christians, we talk about making sacrifices for religion but what do most of us know of the real thing ' I sometimes think that the stubborn devils we are trying in vain to cast out in Christ's same and b> Paul's gospel might turn upon some of us, and say, as to Scova's Bona, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are je' We go not out but by pray or and fasting " We need to live the saint's life if we want the saints power And do any of us suppose it is a terrible, a repulsive life ' Oh, it is the pathway of peace as well as triumph 1 To live daily asking morning by morning as we frame our places, not what should I prefer to do what do you expect me to do but Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do' is the life of perfect freedom, of joy unspeakable If a man serve Christ this, bird will His father honour. Do we live that life' Have we asked the saint's question Do not let us ask it unless we mean it but do not let us refrain from asking it from fear that we cannot do the task that may be assigned 1 " He giveth more grace than she can ever feel need That grace is sufficient as, no sufficient, if we will only yield to it and trust it, that we may boldly say, " I can do all things through Christ which strengthened me " Myhoarors God calls us, not only to be inquirers, bat believers and not believers only, but saints. He would have us interested in our duty. More than that, He would have us rejoicing in His salvation, further still, He would have us experience the bliss that comes of a surrendered life, and that the question of the coin out of Damascus might find a clear, ringing echo in the heart of every one in the congregation I see gathered attentively before me this morning in this House of Prayer. If this were so, I should have little difficulty in pleading with you two requests with which I venture to close what I have been permitted to say to you. My first request has something of a personal character in it, and yet is not alien from the purpose for which we are gathered, or inappropriate to that sacred presence in which we find ourselves Landing on these shores only three days ago, as one sent hither to occupy a poet of no small difficulty and awful responsibility in this great colony, I plead in deep earnestness, and with hopeful confidence, after the experience of the last three days for the prayers and the forbearing sympathy of my fellow Christians in this its capital city. The condition and the administration of any branch of Christ's visible church on earth is matter of profound concern and attention to him who holds the stars in his hand, and walks among the golden candlesticks and all that concerns the well being of that branch of it to which we belong should therefore possess a deep and serious interest for each one of us, as His faithful servants I cannot doubt that you regard in this spirit so important a change as the separation from Melbourne and the hide I undent organisation of the new diocese of allarat-as we of Ballarat shall assuredly watch with the deepest interest the arrangements that may under Providence be made for securing a successor to your own covered diocesan. I think I can undertake that we will pray for you, and I entreat you, and particularly the members of the Prayer Union, among church people in this colony, to pray for it and for me, that such wisdom and strength in the Lord may from the very first be given me, that my countless deficiencies may not be permitted to hinder the extension of God's work in our church, and that I may be enabled, in some little measure at least, to be helpful to my brethren, both clergy and laity, who are devoting themselves, in the face of no little discouragement and difficulty, to the advancement of its work in the Ballarat Diocese not, indeed, as one who would have dominion over their faith, but as a helper of their joy." The right rev gentleman concluded his sermon by an eloquent appeal for a liberal collection in aid of the Sunday School Budding Fund of Christ Church. In the afternoon Bishop Thornton preached at St. Paul's Church, Swanston street. There was a crowded congregation. The service was conducted by the Rev. Canon Chase, the Rev. W. Wood, and the Rev. J. S. Low. The bishop selected as his text 1 Cor. ix. 22 "That I might by all means save some That verse, he pointed out contained the solution of the problem of St Paul's Ufo All real and telling lives would admit of being referred to some ruling purpose St Pauls purpose was definite-it was Christ like, for it was nothing lower than this "that I might have " Some men seemed to shine Satan s purpose, and to thirst for the wreck of others' souls , others lead lives of selfishness, for their personal aggrandise- ment, for the development of their own genius Others lived to add to the sum of human knowledge or liberty to the civil action or the happiness of men and such were called philanthropists To the question-Was St. Paul one of these' he could only answer, Yes and yet No God forbid that philanthropy and the Gospel should be thought antagonists Nothing that was for men should be did parsed, rather should such things be ex acted, as a lofty pedestal on which to set up that which towered above them all St Paul did not look to help men, but to save them. He was convinced that men were wicked, that they wanted nothing less than a new nature, a new destiny He saw that man did not want improvement but life, and all lesser things seemed to him as impertinence in comparison He knew that One had come from heaven to deliver men He had received salvation from Him himself, and being charged by Him with a message, " able to save ' mankind, his purpose in life henceforth was to make that message known to all who needed it. In his concluding remarks the bishop briefly referred to the con elimination of the plans that had been made to increase the efficiency of the church in this colony by the division of the diocese of Melbourne, and prayed that God a blessing we may rest upon his efforts to administer the duties to which he had been called
