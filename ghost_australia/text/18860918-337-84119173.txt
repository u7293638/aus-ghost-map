Â« FIGARO'S" AT HOME. "Oh! lie hath drawn my picture in his letter!" -LOVK'S LABOE LOST Fidelity. [FOB FIGABO.] Ceriee, thy coal-black eyes flash fire, But yet thy heart is cold ; Coquette, thy nature is so like A story I was told In days gone by, that I -will tell The tale tho' it be old. * ~ # * A Princess once had golden hair, And eyes of cold, clear blue, With other charms I need not namo; (For you possess them too) From far and nearj from every clime, Her loverB came to woo. She smiled on each one as he came; Each thought himself was best, She seemed to yield, but somehow stopped And turned away in quest Of fresher face with which to sport, (Of course you know the rest.) At last, there came a noble Knight, With sweet, but stately mien, And Boon he was the favorite As others oft had been; And soon the lovely Princess was Enthroned as his heart's Qneen. But soon stern duty called him back To his own land far West; But ere he went he heard her vow That she'd be true - the rest Had also heard the self-same vow The same old love confess'd. And so he went-another came The same old tale again; And when the Knight returned to her He saw her vow was vain: He stabbed the Princess where she stood And his rival cleft in twain. And said "I doom your spirit shall Prom time to time appear. In other shapes, in other climes, With all the charms so dear To man's dull sense and foolish eyes. And play sad havoc there. . 'I doom your spirit to be false, While seeming to be true, And every mood and action be But reflex base of you; And that, like me, your victories may The mad blind, folly rue." * * * And so, Cerise, thus runs the tale That once was told to me; I quite believe that lady's ghost, My fellow wen oft see In many shapes, and one of those Has coal-black eyes like thee.
