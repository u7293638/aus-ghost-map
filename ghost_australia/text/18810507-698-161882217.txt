MAY Now sings a cool bland wind where falls and flows The runnel by the grave of last year's rose ; Now, underneath the strong perennial leaves, The first slow voice of wintering torrents grieves ; Now, in a light like English August's day, Is seen the fair sweet chastened face of May. She is that daughter of the year who stands With Autumn's last rich offerings in her hands. Behind her gleams the ghost of April's noon ; Before her is the far faint dawn of June. She lingers where the dells and dewy leas Catch stormy sayings from the great bold seas. Her nightly raiment is the misty fold That zones her round with moonlight- coloured gold; And in the day she sheds from shining wings A tender heat that keeps the life in things.
