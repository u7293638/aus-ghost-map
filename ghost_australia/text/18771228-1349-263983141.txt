[?] UNDER TI-IK ST A LIS. o youth, rose-cnnvMi"l, yt full of strife- Craving ununiiqin-lii-ii'lcd joys. Hearing "the desperate fight. 'of life But as a far-oil' pleasant in.isi — Ooino, ere 011 thy bolil way limn .start, I While not a cloud thy future tnars, And still that wildly-beating iieart Under the stars. I A stormy prime, so beautiful With fierce delight, ecstatic pain, I Spending and being spent ; 110 lull, No rest, no want of loss or gain Ere with tired feet thou come to tread The blood-stained field of ended wars, Pause: bow the glories of thy head Under the Btars. A heavy time of brows discrowned, Of hanging hands and feeble knees, With piteous pule ghosts haunted round, And longings for impossible ease — Ah, beat no more like wounded bird Against Fate's iron prison bars! Whon alt sounds cease, God's voice is heard Under the stars. Soon, soon will come the supreme hour When like a painted show life seems, Or perfume of remembered flower, Or dear dead faces seen in dreams. Clasp hands beneath the silent night That hushes all flio-e mortal jars ! God, Thou alone art Love and Light — Beyond the slurs.
