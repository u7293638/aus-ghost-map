POETRY. THE ALARM. [By BiCKY SCIILANK.l She was just a little mousie, and she nibbled by tbe wall, And her tiny teeth were busy, though they were so very small; Then she peeped above the flooring with the brightest cunning eyes, And she capered o'er the carpet, and she squeaked in glad snrprise, As she tossed her dusky head up, and whisked her tail, and said, " Why, I must be in a bedroom—there's a little girl in bed; Ob I hope she's very tired, and perhaps she'll not awake, For I sue upon the table there a dainty piece of cake," So she scampered up the table-leg and thought 11 Well, this is fine," And from off the tasty morsel Mrs. Mouse began to dine; And she nibbled, and she nibbled, when suddenly on high From between the white bed curtains rose a smothered, frightened cry, And the startled little mousie from the table quickly Btole, And scrambled in amazement back into her lowly hole. In the room Mama came rushing, and nurse came with the light To see what could have given baby Florrie such a fright I But the little girl sobbed wildly—"There was such a d'wedfnl sound." And It must have been a ghost, or else some wobbers stealing wound." Bat Mama walked to tbe table, and sbe softly langhed, and said— "It was just a mouse that nibbled at the cake by Florrie's bed, So close those pretty eyes up, and Mama her watch will keep Close by her darling's bedside until she falls asleep; But listen, Baby Florrie, what nursie says is right, The poor little mouse, dear, must have had the greatest fright.
