The Mineral Resources of North ' Queensland, (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) My recent letters have doubtless prepared the numerous readers of the Cairns Post for a more detailed description of the numerous mining centres in our vast metalliferous dis trict and while keeping them well informed is to latest developments in known localities, I shall endeavour from time to time to give a more extended idea as to parts which your subscribers are now only acquainted with by name. As certain gentlemen in Cairns are likely to play a big hand in the vicinity of Ashton- ville in the near future perhaps it may be the proper course to start first in this direction. This place is situited at Rook- wood Station the property of Mr. w. Stewart, a thoroughly good and compact run some thirteen miles west of Red Cap and on the Walsh River. Messrs Telford and Lyons who lately visited the locality spoke most highly of the country and hospitality they received at the hands of the owner of Rookwood who spared no pains to give them every information as to the mineral and other resources of his immediate neighbour hood and to make their sojourn agreeable These gentlemen have come, seen and been conquered by the metallic riches Dame Nature has scattered about with so lavish a hand ard have entered into negotiations to take up two large blocks of country with a view to future developments. The bodies are composed of gossan tnd argentiferous galena and so far as tested have improved in quality and bulk as they went down. A pare 1 of some three or four tons of ore i eeently tested by these enterprising speen lators, "ave mo t encouraging results namely -G9 oxs silver, J dwts "oil and 52 j.er cent of lead, 65 ozs silver 3 dw ts gold and 53 per cent of lead being worth about £1S per ton At the present rate of carriage this re=ult would leave a small margin of profit, but with rulway comnuni cation, and smelting works at Cairns this property would pay h mdsouiely However, the samples which these gentlemen sele ted at haphazard from the lode have on being tested, shewn even b tter n suits panning out at 120 ozs silver ind 60 per cent ot lead, value about J£25 pei ton B it the good people of Cairns whin they go f r a thing mean business and consequently the ore is to be tested in the bu'k Eight i ns will shortly be sent to Aldershot for tri it n_ent Assay s are » eil enough m their »ray but when business is meant as it is in this case, they are apt to be misruling and either result in a large usele s cxpeuditure or in no expenditure it all icc^rdm., as to whether a good piece or a bad piece of or is selected for assay Mes rs Lyons and 1 eltoid are however, no novices at mining aud iu determined to asceitain bv bawn" i lar"e parcel tested whi tber further expenditure is warranted or not, and if the promcters of similar ventures took a leaf from these gentlemen's books the W ild Cat * bu ines would become a thing of the past, only genuine mines would be pi iced on the market and dev eloj mi nt vi onld I c t h i rdi i of the day, for investor» would then tike up with greater confidence those mines which liad only the ring of genuineness about them Bulk parcels can deceive no one for the average quality of an ore is «hewn te i mci ty, and the owner« of a property baie good giounds for planking thi dollirsdrwn for the necessary uiacbimry &e;

block of ground .£50,000 worth of tin has already been taken, and many thousands of pounds worth more will yet be, as the claim has had only a very small portion worked out yet Ihe lode claims are mammoth affairs ind may put Mt Bischoff entirely into the shade Mt Borunda has a shaft down 40ft and has grassed eighty tons of 25 per cent ore But the whole mountain, which is of micaceous formation is stanni feious, and would pay well if concentrated is it may eventually be I y a dry process Billings' lode i» also a big thing being of conical shape and spreading out at the base as it gradually goes down Already it is 10ft wide and still it is widening ont te the right and left carrying 25 per cent ore lhere are other lodes showing good surface indications, and prospecting from fifteen per cent., and which will be worked at no distant date when machinery is intro- duced to treat it 1 his portion of the coun- try is highly metalliferous and the prospec- tors are few, very few and very far between Ihe introduction of capital and experienced labour with the necessary appliances would produce payable results. I The Queenslander, at Ridcap, has also contributed its share towards spreading the f ime of our wonderfully rich district Whde in the process of sinking, a make o' ore was strnck and at this same time an immense inflow of water, proving the vicinity of a ( han pion lode The water is so heavy that machinery will be required to combat it but the ore struck will fully warrant the expeuse, as it is some of the richest yet obtained in the district comprising car- bon it> s of lead heavily charged with sulphides of silver, and assaying very highly, better than anything yet found on our silver field district The news is very satisfactory as it proves that our silver mu es are no delusions 1 ut real genuine arboles, requir- ing only pra< tical and experienced manage ment None of our mines have anything of the Wild Cat about them, ind if they don't pay its no fault of the mines but it cert linly is, of the management 1 here is not a single man lipre engaged its a manager of any of our mines who would stand a ghost of a show of occupying a similar position in the Broken Hill district, ind that s the re ison why silver mining has so fir 1 een so lament ableafailnre Buttbe Herberton Aihcrtiser in a recent l'-sue tries to raise a side issue and blind the eyes of +he public as to the real facts of the case, for he says "The treitment of silver ores, howev« r, can only pay winn conditions are most fivourable, is «itness several of the Broken Hill mine», and is the conditions do not exist here, it is fairly safe to a sume that silver nuning in this distnct will not be a pronounced success until carnage is cheaper and ill other costs reduced" Now .» greater pu ce of t» lddle was never wi ltten, for the cost of can läge has nothing whatever to do with the working of mines and the suieltitg of ores than the election nots in Ireland hivi Its the incompetence of the managers md others in charge of the mines that have hitherto pre- vailed onr silver mines from being a "pronounced success" In the Broken Hill district fluxes have to be carted a distance of 40 miles and coke is imported from England, and yet 14oz3 to the ton cm be made to yield a net profit of over £¿00 per »ei k with only one SO smelter running Here the fluxes are close at hand, the dis- tance from the coast is not half as fai, the ores are far richer-three or four times as rich, and are not as bad smelting ores either as the ores at Broken Hill, where a large quintity of it is very refractory requiring sp« cial treatment (To be Continued.)
