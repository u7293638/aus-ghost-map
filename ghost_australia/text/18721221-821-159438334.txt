CHAPTER IL ANOTHER AWFUL VISITOR. Dear reader, I will not describe to yon in the usual manner the secluded nook in which myself and other juvenile members of our family dwelt, and taught "the young idea how to shoot." Our place was rather dilapi dated, but we yet had about it relics of the splendour of older generations; amongst other things some real silver spoons. These were only used on State occasions. They and the jam, in fact, never were placed on the table except a parent of some of the girls visited our establishment, and a good appear ance was wanted. We only used a princess metal spoon when we followed the time honoured custom of administering to the pupils treacle, and sulphur in the evening. About the period when the end of the last chapter took place, a man clad in sombre-looking, not to say shabby raiment, walked cautiously under the verandah of Starvem Villa, and asked is seysterious tones for Molly. She was oar familiar, much-' loved servant, who had been with us fully a fortnight, and had never dreamt of sewing machines or of leaving our family. Molly tripped rapidly up the passage. She thought it was her favourite policeman, come to tell her all about the Enquiry, and take a glass of Simms's best beer (then on tap). But it was not a policeman, and she felt alarmed. "Young woman," said the man, "you perhaps don't know me. But you soon shall. I'm the ghost of your Uncle Bob, and I'm come for them spoons. Mind you get 'em." . A mist for an instant settled over the girl's eyes. It was only for an instant, and soon cleared away; but he who had ad dressed her, whether flesh and blood or a mere shadow, was gone! She ran in and told me her storyâ€”how the man had said he was her uncle. The girls all shrieked, and cried, "Oh, my!" but I soon silenced them. The facts were indeed strange. The plot seemed to be thickening.
