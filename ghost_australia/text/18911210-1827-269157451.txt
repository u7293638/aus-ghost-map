THE NOVELIST. LAYING A GH0SOT. I [BV «BOEG®' MflSy'HiBB SBKK^' s "It is of uo use for you to talk, ! Mary," I said, quite angrily; " a pro- ; fessional:m?,u.hasrio. right, toisit. still. : Uking-his patients'fees without coni stantly striving after higher knowledge for-their.-benefit." . . " Of- course-not, dear," said toy wife, gently—by 'the way, she always does speak.. gently—" b.ut. you. study : too much." " Nonsense! " ; "Indeed, dear, but you do.

" Absurd ! I fee] as if I must be a [ more idler, Mary ; and at a time, too, \ when it seems as if medicine was quite at a stand. Surgery has made won derful strides, but - the physician is nowhere.'-' M " What nonsense, dear, wheu everybody says; that you are the cleverest doctor for..- lil'ty miles round ; and at such unu-s I feel as if I could kiss the person who said, so "' Everybody' 5S a gooSej••••and' goose or no, don't you let me catch \- you kissing them. There, be off, little one, and-1st me get on with my work." " Work, work, always work," she said, with'.;a pretty pout, of the lips which ipvited what they received, with the; result that my happy youngwife went out smiling while I sat down to think I was -young and very enthusiastic in those days. Rather vain, too, and disposed to look dowu upon what I cal led the "old fogies of the profession." ] meant to make great discoveries in medicine for the benefit of suffering humanity, and'for my own benefit too. I'm afraid. Consequently—I confess it—1 was a dangerous kiud of doctor, and always itching to try experiments. At the time of. which I am speaking, I was mac! upon a new remedy which I, believed I had discovered for the nervous state -consequent upon the failure of the digestive powers in people of middle age; audit was upon this remedy that I now sat down to think in my little consulting-room and dispensary combined. I had been ponderiug over the sub ject then for months, and the more I thought the more convinced I was that my remedy would work wonders, but for want of test cases I was completely in the dark. I had got so far, though, that I had given myself full confidence in the correctness of uiy dodnctions ; all I wanted was trialexperiment on the vile body of man, so as to make sure. " Iiow to proceed ?" I said to myself, as I sat amongst my bottles and drugs, tapping the table with my finger nails—"how to proceed Y I mnst try it upon a patient, but it is not fair or just, to try experiments upon one who confides in you. Suppose my ideas are wrong—suppose it is a fallacy 1" These thoughts troubled me so that I grew feverish, and my head burned. Jumping up from my chair, I took a clean tumbler from a shelf, half: ""Elied it from a'seltzogene• which stood on the table, tossed oil the sparkling', water, put back the tumbler and ";r'6" sui\ied 'iiiy seat, feeling decidedly better and clearer. " How to proceed ? " I said again, " I cannot, I must not try it upon a patient. It would not be just. Upon whom, then ? Mary ! " " Perish the thought 1 " I cried dramatically. " To deceive her would be ten times worse." "But I might tell h'er first. She would take it—bless her !—if I told her." " No—no—no—no! " I cried; and then, lialf aloud, " If the experiment must be tried, and you have" so much faith in it, try it upon yourself, like a man! " I sprang- up-once more with-allkinds of unpleasant notions beginning to haunt me. Suppose the dose failed— suppose it pEO^iJd'Vfafajl-^si-ijjpose: I were suddenly - called * away without having time to. explain to a brother medical man what l haditaken. "Why, they would abring ,it...in. suicide, and my wife ...would be a widow," I exclaimed -witM a- chill of horror seeming & ikak;e%)i;jr •.fclood-i'im sluggishly through iny veins.

We were friends out iii Australia—years ago." "Australia, eh?" I cried. " Yes. Do you know Australia ?" he said wouderingly. " I passed my boyhood and my early manhood there," I replied quietly, " I came to England to finish my studies, and settle dowu. So you are haunted, eh ? " " Haunted I Did I say haunted ?" he cried uneasily. " Oh, no : a mere fancy," and he laughed unpleasantly. " Of course," I said. " My dear sir, as a-'medical man I must be plain with you. I will give you the best advice, and will help you iu any way I can ; but the cure for your complaint is in you own hands. Leave all liquors alone, and you will uiend fast. Go on as you are now, drinkinoheavily, aud in six months you will be iu your grave.". He started violently, and grasped the elbows of the chair as he leaned forward, gazing wildly in my facc.
