DRAGONS IN THE ALPS. As a matter of strict se i emu the accuracy there are probably just as many dragons in the Alps as there are snakes in Iceland Possibly there are fewer one cannot say for certain as the interior of Iceland is only part of ally explored What is really interests-, (says Mr Francis Gribble, writing in the "Pall Mall Gazette ") is to find an enlightened man, in an enlightened 1 ago believing m dragons IB firmly as he believed in God, and proving? their existence out of the ra paths of nun v v. increases The man WAS Professor Â¡schouchzer, of the Carver nity of Zurich and there was no question whatever that he was an enlightened mi ii He sat in the chair. of Gainer, and was worthy of it The on green tea the " dilatation " theory of glacial movement, which was mgeniDus, though wrong He corresponded with Sir Isaac New ton and introduced the Swiss to the knowledge of the law of gravitation He argued for the abolition of capital punishment for witchcraft And he devoted his summer vacations to mountain travel, end to the collection of o\ dence to show that there really and truly were dragons in the Alps We gather from his book that he got little pleasure out of his mountaineer- ing, for he says F' Archer said qui dorn aunt scansiones mon him But he was sustained by a sense of duty, and by the desire to increase the sum of human knowledge concerning dragons Not that he had over seen a dragon but he had I seen a dragon stone, which is, he explains, a jewel cut out of a dragon's held while the dragon is asleep, and invaluable as a remedy against plague, dysentery, diarrhoea poison, hemorrhage, and blood ing of the nose " There was sworn t alimony to the fact that the stone which Schenscher saw had been employed successfully for the treatment of these various complaints Consequently it must have come from the head of a dragon, for though certain other sorts of stores might have cured hemorrhage, only a dragon stone could have been effi actions against dysentery or plague But if there are dragon stones there must be dragons and the Alps in general, and the Siberian Alps in particular, are full of the very sort of caves which dragons might naturally be expected to frequent such is the a priori argument It only remains to marshal the a posteriori proofs The professor presents them in the cantonment shape of the depositions of witnesses who " make oath and say " time that, have encountered dragons in the Alps In style and substance- to say nothing of conclusiyoues3-thoy strikingly resemble those circumstantial narratives by means of which the existence of ghosts has been demonstrated by the Society for Psychical Research.
