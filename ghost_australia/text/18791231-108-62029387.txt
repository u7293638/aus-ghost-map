No man cometh unto God to offer Him sacrifice, to pour out supplications and prayers before llim, or to do Him any ser vice, which doth not first believe Him both to be, antl to he a rewarder of them who in such sort seek unto Him. Let men be taught this either by revelation from heaven or by instruction upon earth ; Iy labour, study, and meditation, or by the only secret inspiration of the Holy Ghost. WVhatsoever the mean be they know it by, if the knowledge thereof were possible owithout discourse of natural rea son why should nane be found capable thereof but only men ? nor men till such time as they come unto ripe and full ability to work by reasonable understanding. The whole drift of the Scripture of God, what is bult only to teach theology ? Theology, what is it but the science of things divine ? What science can be attained unto with out the help of nntural discourse and rea son ? "ludge you of that which I speak," saith the apostlc. In vain it were to speak anything of Godl but that by reason men are able somewhat to judge of that they hear, and by discourse to discern how con sonant it is to truth. Scripture indeed teacheth things above nat ure, things which our reason by itself could not reach unto. Yet those also we believe, know ing by renason that the Scripture is the Waord of God.--looker.
