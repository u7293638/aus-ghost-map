ORIGNAL POETRY. SOMETIME. Sometime, in spite of all you crave And all you vow to-day. This loss will fill a weedy grave, Left far on life's highway. This love will be the kindest ghost Laid on sweet Mem'ry's breast; I leave you, deaf to all you boast, Well knowing it is best. Sometime, in spite of all your fears, You will forget this day, Or think of it in future years As one vague yesterday, Crowned with a story, half of pain And hall of joy, maybe— As, on the hills, faint misty rain Blended with beams, we see. So, thinking of that sometime day, forgive this hour of pain ; Some morning, on the future's way. We'll meet as friends again. Others have partcd as we part Whose eyes today are dry! I do not fear your broken heart, —Forgive me ... . and good-bye! JENNINGS CARMICHAEL
