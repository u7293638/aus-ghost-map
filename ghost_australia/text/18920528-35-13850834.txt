THE MUSIC HALL DRAMA. The music halls appo it (writes the Globe) to be within measurable distance of achieving one of their great closes the right to play stage plays They have long had a hankering after this They have coquetted for years with the stage play, and on various occasions furtive billings and goings have taken place between (them, but when the sweet kisses which, being stolen, should have been silent, have become too loud, too theatrical managers have howled out in pangs of jealousy, the stage play has been hauled back to its legal allegiance by the ear, and the rival showman trounced for his improper advances This is a very pretty metaphor, exactly, we hope, to the taste of the managers aforesaid, but it would sound to the music ball caterers rather like begging the question. they would had you to move on with your metaphors, and listen to their facts Music halls were founded for the elevation of the masses. Good Anything which leads to that should be encouraged at the music halls Good again says), a short and simple charade repre Bontation, with a sound moral, is the proper thing for the music hall Range They will tell you, besides, talking of those, that if you wish to see some of the boat talent of the halls you must go to the theatre at pantomime time, and that if you enjoy a thoroughly good variety show, in the best music hall style, you have only to v i it some popular v theatrical burlesque Also, that if you wish to hear the latest music hall rage " without even crossing the threshold of a hall only wait a bit, and the ' lago ' will be exhibited to you under the Lord Chamberlain's license, sandwiched in be tween the incidents of what is decisively known as a "play" There is a good deal and on both sides, and not a little indignation find sarcasm expended, and a trifle of wit and even boom, SO low -minded are some people, allusions to " real tradition " Wh favor the issue of the immediate conti overay, it seems not at all unlikely that the stage play will ultimately got a footing in the music hill, md one may be one use 1 for opeen! using a little on what the results aiohkol} tobe It is interesting to consider what influence the music hall unborn will have upon the drama It is quite certain that the sphere of exercise of any sort regrets upon the art itself Mondolssohn on a seaside band, played upon an empty stomach, with a view to the subsequent circulation of the bit is not quite the same thing as the same composer at St James's li ill in the afternoon after a substantial lunch, and the money secure the aid of the sales man, exercised across the coster s burrow of nine keel, is somewhat illiTorant, both in language and in wide from the same art asoxerctsod by " our All Jones," whose at Berlin is far removed from that of the man who "places" shares So the drama, removed from the precincts of the sacred horse-hoe, and from the pure atmosphere of orange pool un- tainted by tobacco and the aroma of spinks, will differentiate itself as soon as it grows familiar with the Munro hall, the upturned cigarette and melons stare, the short pipe and power, and the lemonade and feathers more are set oral horse on which the now develop ment may proceed twenty minutes appearing to To the happy medium fixed by the would-be legislator for mime hall drama, there might possibly be a revival of the old and warranted Utclinrilsoniunploy, winch occupied about that time Some of throughout bain- stornier» now very much in refloat, would not be at all sorry if this should be the case they have been bewailing ever since they were put on the shelf the decay of the true life drama, and have been prophesying both on the stage and off that "day) will come" and it is possible that the day is coming, under the auspices of the County Council Another line of dov elopment vi Lu h suggests- itself is the calling into being of an entirely new t class of drama, more in keeping with the century-end and the greens loch What, for itu>lu,uco, could be more appropriate than to put a cab pro dramatic setting round some of the precious pearls or art which exhibit themselves on the music hall stage at present ? For instance, a Rent Ionian comes on and details vocally how he " knocked-out in the Old Kent-road " This is all of us well as for as it goes, but how much more realistic, vivifying, and improving it would be if we find the Old -Kent-road there itself, with the pain cipal characters of the song playing their parts in it before us whom. again, take the lady with the sentimental song who is extremely attentive. and sings most Btv cot!
