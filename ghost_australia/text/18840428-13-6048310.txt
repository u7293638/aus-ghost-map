Such a representative could do the cause no harm, and he might achieve considerable results by provoking discussion, and by inducing the English unions to petition Parliament and to press their members on the subject. But it would appear from the reports that the delegate is expected to protest not only against the sending out of convicts by France, but against Australia securing immigrants from the, mother country. Mr. G. WILLIAMS, who has been selected to proceed to England, if the money can be raised, informed the Premier on Saturday that his " principal mission would be in con " nexion with the Recidiviste Bill. " the immigration question was merely " a side issue " But if the mission is to obtain official recognition from the Government and aid from the community at large, there should be no such side issues We are all with the unions in their protest against the readings, but a large section of the community will be thoroughly hostile to the idea of sanctioning the visit to England of a person who considers it to be any part of his duty to disparage Australia as a field for immigration 'Thousands of men and women are leaving Great Britain annually to form homes abroad No fairer field for settlement exists than that Australia affords, and the public at large can scarcely be expected to view with unqualified favour the proceedings of a gentleman, one part of whose duty is to be to assert the contrary, and to advise intending emigrants to turn their backs upon our shores there are people who " run down the colonies," but colonists generally are not called upon to approve of their efforts Individuals can of course please themselves about supporting the Delegate fund, but the Government, as we submit, is not justified in recognising the delegate many official manner until " the side issue of immi " gration " is withdrawn This subject is an open question in the Cabinet, and in common fairness the neutrality should be preserved the farmers have been petitioning Parliament largely, urging that the state should bring labour to Victoria as well as capital, and if the Government can do nothing for the agricultural industry in this matter, at least it need not and a mission one part of whose object is to discourage the men who would voluntarily come out to seek employment in England, Mr Wm LI VMS would be met every where by the representatives of New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, and tasmania whoarooflenngcheap passages, are speaking of the capabilities of the colonies, and are otherwise in licencing intending immigrants to cast their lot in these southern lands, and the sister colonies have a right to expect that they shall not be hampered and obstructed by any one who can plead that he is introduced, sanctioned, or recognised by the friendly Government of Victoria Persistence in the side issue will necessarily limit the usefulness of the delegate in England, as well as alienate support from him here Any conten- tion that Australia does not want immigrants must motor rally damage the plea that we do not desire convicts As the one idea will be regarded as crazy in Great Britain as opposed to the declared policy of most of the colonies may be legitimately questioned at home how far Mr WILLIAM, is a representative man in connexion with the other matter for these reasons we would suggest to the unions that all reference to immigration should be withdrawn, and that Mr WILLIAMS should be instructed simply to press the Australian protest against the decide writes In that case he will represent us all And, making an appeal to generous 01 to patriotic sentiments, he may hope to achieve a success The colonies must work through England, and it would be a great thing if the English 'Trades Unions could be in duced to urge their representatives in Parliament to strengthen the Government in the interests of Australia By arousing public interest in Great Britain, by showing that public opinion is heartily with us, we may cause Imperial Ministers to put heart into their efforts, and may possibly induce them to make offers to France which otherwise they would hesitate about submitting And of course what we all desire here is a friendly settlement of the issue We would be glad to hear of such an arrangement with regard to New Caledonia, as has been an nounced in connexion with the island of Raiatea " The French flag," said Mr C W Dilke on the 11th August last, in reply to a question in the House of Commons, " was hoisted at Raiatea, an island to the leeward of Tahiti, " shortly before the MA JJ SAY"S Govern ment assumed office, and a provisional " protectorate- was assumed over it by " the French authorities at Tahiti at " the solicitation of the chiefs of the island, but the proceeding was dis " avowed by the French Government as " an infraction of the Declaration " of 19th June, 1837 The Trench " Government, however, opened up " negotiations for the alienation of " the deed? alton m conside? atwn of adequate concessions on then put the toast non with other pending gua " tion, and IILU M VII STY S Govern " ment have consented that the French " flag shall remain provisionally hoisted " until the 31st December next, when unless otherwise agreed between the " two Governments, the status quo ante " under the declaration of 1817 will be " I reverted to the words we have italicised are of much moment to ourselves We see the two great powers making friendly arrangements for the cession of territory, the independence of which is guaranteed by treaty, and we naturally ask if this principle cannot be applied to the New Hebrides and to New Caledonia 1 The independence of the Leeward group of the 1 Friendly Isles, Huahine, Raiatea, and 901 shoes, and other islets is guaranteed far more formality than is the independence of the New Hebrides The treaty of 1847 goes much further than does the " understanding of 1878, and if Great Britain gives up the treaty, and allows the Leeward Isles as a whole to go with 'Tahiti, France might surrender her claim to the New Hebrides An exchange with regard to New Caledonia should be equally possible There are old French colonies which are practically of no use to England, and which would be warmly welcomed by li since Some one of these might be offered And if, either, a money compensation is necessary, Australia would prove its earnestness by paying liberally in order to avert the danger which threatens it, and which must always exist so long as New Caledonia the very centre of the Austral group re mains in foreign hands But we can scarcely expect English Ministers to make and the English people to approve of such large offers as would be grateful to 1 Franco, unless we show in a variety of ways our earnestness and our determination, if the worst happens, to protect ourselves by ants penal legislation If this mission of the Trades Union delegate could be arranged for, it would be a valuable evidence of sincerity The one drawback is the suspicion, as matters now stand, that the delegate goes home for an ulterior and a non national purpose, and that injurious idea might well be removed v The advice given to the wine-growers of Australia by the editor of an English trade review to produce a distinctively Australian wine, which shall not only equal but surpass in quality the European wines with which the English palate has familiarised itself, strikes one as having been written by a person more familiar with the cellar than with the vineyard In order to comply with it, we should either have to direct our experiments to the production of a new variety of grape, or to select fresh kinds, in novel pi oper tions, to be em- ployed in the press, or to blend certain vintages in the vat until a product had been obtained which, in the estimation of the experimentaliSt, would agreeably till late the English palate Butter thousand essays of this kind might be made, and yet we might be as far as over from reaching the ideal aimed at It seems to be forgotten that we produce the wines of Spain, Portugal, i France, Germany, and Madeira, simply because we plant the same varieties of the grape, under similar conditions of soil and climate, and the result is a port, claret, sherry, Madeira, hock, chablis, de, respectively, which is, at any rate, the pure juice of the grape, and is not fortified or flavoured, as some Spanish and Portuguese wines notoriously are, in order to adapt them to the palates of people living in a cold humid country Nor does there appear any reason whatever why, in process of time, the vineyards of Australia should not produce wines quite as delicate as the burgundies, the high class clarets, the madeiras, the Johannisberg, and the chateau d'yqucms, which now command such high prices in Europe But when Lord Mentor comes to advise us with respect to the manufacture of and management of nines, he takes his stand upon much 111010 solid ground, and is entitled to be listened to with attention 1 or, as he says, our vinegrowers have not wholly mastered the secret of for mentation Nor does the management of the wine in the collar receive that degree of consideration which is due to it With respect to the process of fermentation, it is liable to be arrested 01 retarded by the greater or less maturity of the grapes, by the external temperature, and a variety of other causes Some years there will be a deficiency of sac charino in the grapes, or the must will be too rich in glucose, or there will be a redundancy of tartaric and malic acids, and all these vans tions will have to be taken into account, and proper connectives applied, as otherwise the quality of the wine will fluctuate from year to year, instead of its acquiring that uniformity-at any rate of flavour-which is secured by the experienced methods observed in the principal vine growing countries of Europe With the judgment of the wine in the cellar, however, commences the nn portant duties of the matter de chin and in the more famous vineyards of Medoc the cellar is excavated in such a soil, constructed of such match mis, and erected so solidly, as to exempt it from atmospheric influences, and to preserve it from acidity on the one hand and humidity on the other Every cask is the object of almost daily attention, so that the void produced by evaporation may be carefully filled up, and each is kicked off three times in the months of March, June, and November the first year and twice the spring and autumn the second And not until every trace of fermentation has subsided, does the final fining take place, which precedes by a fortnight the bottling of the wine We mention these incidents of its progress to maturity as an illustration of the vigilant supervision which the wine receives in the cellar from those who are specially qualified for the work With respect to the care which should be taken in packing and to answer tmg wines for the English market, and in making them known in the mother country, the advice given by the editor of Roberts' Trade Review is sensible and business like , but we believe that, at the present time, our winegrowers find themselves pretty well occupied in supplying the demand for the local market The old prejudices against colonial wine some of them well founded five and twenty years ago, when much of it was very crude stud-have pretty well disappeared Our vintages are yearly improving in quality and in variety, and they are rapidly super sending foreign wines in many house holds It is a branch of industry ninth is bound eventually to assume immense dimensions, and to figure largely among the productive resources of this and the neighbouring colonies and there is con- siderable force in the following recommendation -"The Australian wine " trade claims the most anxious care of " the Australian Governments They " should stimulate and protect the coal'' " vation of the vine by every means in " then power A spirit of emulation " should be promoted amongst growers " by the introduction of a scale of ro " wards Model vineyards and a school of viticulture should be established " and carefully nurtured, and the "general welfare of the industry " should be a matter of as I " much earnest consideration and pa " ternal watchfulness as it is to the " Governments of France and Germany The writer might have added to the Government of Italy also, which, next to France, is the largest wine producing country in the world 'where, the Royal Endogical School at Conegliano, which costs the state only a few hundreds of pounds sterling per annum £400 as a subsidy, and a grant of M per head for each of the students turns out every year a number of young men, the sons of landowners and labourers, who have been thoroughly well grounded in every art, science, and process connected with vine growing and wine making, in eluding the pathology of the plant and the physiology of for ments every known variety of fruit-bearing vine in the world is cultivated in the expo nmental nursery, the habits of the various parasites which are their natural enemies are

each would be insignificant, and the advan Vegas to nil incalculable Of the recent news about Egypt, the most important story is that England is convening a European Congress to deal with the financial condition the country, and the most interesting is that the Ministry have undertaken to despatch troops to relieve General GORDON. The congress was inevitable The enormous debt created by ISMAIL PASHA at an enormous interest still hangs like a millstone round the neck of Egypt The English Minister of Finance finds it impossible to pay her way, and has been already to the usurers for a million of money Of course this cannot go on, and it may be assumed that the object of the congress is to lower the rate of interest, or to write off a portion of the debt, or in some other way to fit Egypt's burden to Egypt's back Had AitABi been successful, Egyptian securities would have been of no more value than are Honduras, or Turkish, or confederate bonds, and the speculators-for Egyptian loans were never bond fide investments are lucky if they obtain a composition where they ran the risk of losing all The unfortunate part of the affair is, that the blundering of the Imperial Government should have given Pi nee an excuse for claiming to be admitted to a share of Egyptian control The French demand will be resisted as a matter of course, but it might not have been heard of but for the disasters in the Soudan The Gordon Gladstone incident will, however, arouse the personal interest of the nation more than the financial issue In the contest between the general and the Premier the former has won As GonnoN will not leave Khartoum to its fate, Mr G-ADSiONi-his vows to the contrary notwithstanding- has to BOIUI troops to Khartoum If only this step had been taken in the first instance, if it had been recognised that a ground can no more do without soldiers than tan a steamer with out coals, a world of trouble and a sea of blood would have been spiced With a thousand bayonets, or, better still, as many Indian and English sabres, General GORDON would have established his mill oncontonco He would have holdIvhai team easily, and probably have relieved Kassala, and certainly there would have been no insurrection in his rear, with the accompaniments of the mass into at Shendy and the peril at Berber The tubes between Cairo and Khartoum had been quiescent up to the time of the despatch of General GORDON so soon as they learned from him that the country was to be abandoned by Egypt, and that the garrison were to obtain no relief, they rose in arms, and an expedition which at that d to could have reached Khartoum in peace, may now have to fight its way thor.

He points out that there is a large tract of country to the westward of Adelaide, from which telegraphic information of changes in the w e either might be obtained, which would be of the greatest possible advantage, not only to South Australia, but to the eastern colonies and New Zealand " Do " not the authorities see," Mr SVKAOGI asks, "that Perth and Eucla are to them for more than what Valontuis " to central and northern Europe, and " that the establishment of connected " high and low level stations in telegraphic connexion with these outposts " would incalculably and the advance of " meteorology ? » Mr Wn VGOE speaks with knowledge The Australian colo- men, from the vast extent of coast line which has been placed in telegraphic com- munication, is particularly well adapted for a system of weather tologi aphy, and there can be no doubt that the value of such a system would be greatly enhanced by the establishment at certain points of high level observatories, such as those which have proved so successful at Ben Novis and elsewhere in the northern hemisphere In com su of time we shall no doubt see a chain of such observatories stretching across the Australian continent, constituting a high level observatory system in which all the colonies will play a pint Which of them all IS to cash the credit of taking the initiative The R.M.S.
