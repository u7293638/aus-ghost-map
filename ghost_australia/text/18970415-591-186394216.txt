Ghosts in the Kitchen. " There are rho3ts in the kitchen, sir,'" was the extraordinary announcement made by a sook last night to her master, just as he was sitting down to dinner. The woman, pale with fright, nearly dropped the soup which she was bnnging to the table. Heir mister, a tradesman in the Rue dn Bac, wondering ivhat was the matter, walked with his cowering cook to the kitchtn, and there saw to his astoni.-lnnent that the chairs and tables -ivore violently oscillating, the cupboards were also shaking, until it seemed as if the spirits had really taken possession of the kitchcn in order to h«ld a seance there. The tradesman then returned to the dining room amar.eii, and hardly had lie resumed his seat when the chairs, tables, sideboard, and in fact all the furniture began to vibrntr* around him. He immediately surmised that the whole house was coming down, so he rushed out to consult one of hi» iiei:z!i')nrs, who is an architect. The latter r tunifl with him to the dwelling, and found that it -ivas gradually coming down. The police were then communicated with, and th-9 tottering habitation was cleared of all its inmates. This morning props were nut up to support the house, which is one of the oldest in the district.—Daily Tdcgraph"s Paris car respondent.
