Plaintiff honesty believed he had bona-fide grievance, and it was astonishing to hear this talk about oppression, and if he had not fought the second trial defendant would inevitably have got judgment on the count on which plaintiff had now Bucooedetl. The farthing damages was not contemptuous! inasmuch as the jury no doubt find in their minds the 100 already obtained; and under all the circumstances, the plaintiff having succeeded was entitled to the costs of the issue and to the general costs of the case. Mr. Justice Williams took the view that the statements made by the defendant might amount to comment or conclusions of fact, and that the only consistent view was that the jury regarded the libels as libels on plaintiff as commissioner. His Honour was inclined to think that the plaintiff, having only succeeded on 10 out of 12 counts, was not entitled to the general costs of the case, but only to the costs of the issues on which he had succeeded. His Honour would, however, consider the matter, and give his decision some day next week. The Minister of Railways has decided to proceed at once with the extension of the Jumbunna railway for 20 miles in order to provide for the opening up of the new seams of coal which have been discovered in the district, and are found to be of superior quality. The estimated cost of the extension is from £12,000 to 1114,000, and the 12th and Ililli sections of the Railway Works Committee Act provide for works involving a less expenditure than £20,000 to be undertaken apart from the special procedure laid down by that net. Instructions have been given to the eiiglncer-iii-cliicf to have surveys completed immediately, and contracts for the formation will shortly be let on the butty-gang principle. " For ways that are dark and tricks that are vain the heathen Chinee is peculiar" A case has occurred in which tricks have been vainly played by a native of the country which is not covering itself with martini glory at the present time, and the individual has come to learn by inconvenient experience that after all "honesty is the best policy," Wah John was circumvented by the Customs authorities some time ago in a little scheme to smuggle some £200 worth of opium into the colony within innooi.'iit-looking packages of preserved ginger. Finding that the "game was up," Walt John was disinclined to within his premises in Little Bourke-street until an officer of the law turned up with a summons, and he bethought himself to pay sundry surreptitious visits to country cousins," leave the police a lot of trouble. J'ntient investigation showed that he had taken refuge in many parts of the colony, but a policeman never happened to get on his back at the right moment. Yesterday, however, Wah John became tired of playing any longer the " artful dodger," and presenting himself at the Custom-house inquired of the secretary how much the " damage " would be to settle the little affair in a friendly manner. After due consideration he was offered the alternative of paying a line of £170 and forfeiting the contraband goods or being proceeded against according to law, and he readily agreed to pay the line named by the Commissioner. In order that complete information may be laid before the Railways Committee on the question of building narrow-gauge railways, Mr. Williams has instructed the engineer-in-chief to have surveys and comparative estimates made for a broad and a narrow gauge line from Cunninghame to Orbost. What may be saved by constructing a 2ft. gauge line in stead of one of the standard width in hilly country will thus be ascertained in a practical manner. The committee also require evidence as to the relative cost of the two classes of Hues in very hilly and difficult country, but a locality has not yet been decided upon to furnish this information. It is the intention of tbeGotcitimonttonppoint anew committee to take up investigations where the old committee left off, and when the evidence indicated above is available a report on the narrow-gauge question can be made available for the consideration of vParlinmenl. sign The opening of. the Spencer-street railway viaduct for passenger traffic is to be an accomplished fact on the 10th December.
