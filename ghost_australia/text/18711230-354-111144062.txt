BOXING DAY. If Christmas Day passed without 'rniii, so. much cannot be said m favor of Bpxiiij? Day. Early rising Aval the order, and- diteap]-ointmeii,tr' the result or.th'e iivjst glance, nt tlie heavens';, for . it was wet, decidedly Tvet, and outdoor amusements in consequence fell below par. Nevertheless the majority having dbtormmed upon enjoying a holiday, and, being nutlnvarta hle, donned their gala attire, and trusting to umbrellas and light , waterproofs, sallied forth for such a, day's pleasure as the adverse circumr stances would permit of. At about half-past' cight.tho streets began to fill, and shortly after wards 'a goodly number of ' passengers rendez-' roused at the steamer's wharf, intending to join1 the excursion by tho Newcastle Artillery Corps to Kaymond Terrace. The Collaroy had been engaged for the occasion, and was advertised: to start at nine, o'clock-;, as has generally beenjthe case, punctuality was not attended to, and [sjie.( did not move off until about a qiiarter' to eleven.' She took a goodly complement of excursionists, the number having bcenirpughly' estimated ;at about three hundred. Sonic tiine before's'hc left the first train? frorn'Maitland had arrived, bring ing down u large number of,, visitors, computed at some three hundred and fifty, a great many of whpm, ,t dissatisfied with the .appearance o£ the wen.th'dr?' t661-°' '(lie' first opportunity of fetiifif-' ing -whence they came, whilst the pthers became absorbed in the busy crowd of excursionists. The railway station was'.incon vi'iiieh'tly ciio»-ded';i..wliat, 'xitri. the lnunbcij jp'f; travellers arriving and departing, it was not to be wondered at there was apparently a consi derable amount of confusion.

This treatment to the visitors*' to ^Wjallscikl oil EoxJnjsf Day has' been remark eel upon by tfs in' former years, and when comfortable carriages, instead of standing idle, could havo been provided.- --We ngaiiurc uinrk, it shows either great negligence or bad management on the part of the railway oliicials.

The drizzling rain kept continually falling, ?at ; .timps heayier'ihan at others; but even tins did not seem'to liave any liindrancc to the. ehjoj'mont of tlicltioliday folks', for from nri early1 liour numbers were seen flocking towards the wharf and trains. The Volunteer Artillery -blind, and the Lambton brass band paraded the streets, adding much to the hilarity of. the scene. The. streets also being decoratcd'/.witli; boughs1 and' flags and with'numbers of-bright and happy faces hurrying to hiid fro to their various desti nations, gave the dull.. day ..a -better, appearance than it ''otherwise would' have* had. However, we will liuvry on, and give a slight description of the various pleasures and entertainments, commencing with the ' .'; '''' WALLSEND JtACES. *' *' i . - FIRST DAY. '! Tnlosday morning, as-,we hove! stated /before/ was anything but favourable to tho success ?which would have otherwise attended the first, dav's races, and some ill-feeling must have oc curred between the clerk of the weather and the clerk of the Wallsend racecourse, for this is the, second wet Boxing Day, — or perhaps it was owing to races being held in Maitland on rthis day that the weather was uapropitipuB ; for jt is a proverbial fact 'that when 'races take place in Maitland, it is. sure to. i be wet. The weather, hower, suited isome, 'Wetter.' than -the interfsb1 heat experienced on former occasions. In I860, tho first year of the Wallsend Races (if our memory serves us rightly) the day was intensely -- hot,, -sp .much so, that not a faste 'oT'lmjfafing % raw -spirits' cbufd^ be' obtained-at . tlio.. booths, and^a.rush hod to. be made to Mr. Eicklow's well of water ; 1867, an other scor-ching hot, day,; 18C8, very pleasant and cool ;' 1869, another' scorcher : for' ther flrutdajj' ;' 1870, the course was ? covered with water ,. sq that the races had to 1)0 postponeVli'to.'New'S^ear's Day, on which' day 'life weather was chilly, and rain fellr at, intervals.

' Verjf ' littlb' time remained; to stay-in the town, as the firjst race -was, announced to come off at noon; so, after a nobbier nt .host Harris's, we sauntered across the wet fields, and, after ? admirimj with an envious eye the ldrpc'heap of small coal lie longing ;to Messrs. Laidley and Go'., we reached the; course. .
