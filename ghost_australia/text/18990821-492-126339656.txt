Beeclier went Unspanked. A new story of Heavy Ward Beeehor has been given to tlic world by Dr. E. K. Oressey. It was a story of Dr. Cressey s boyhood. One day bis mother left tho honse, cautioning biro and bis brothers that they must be very quiet and not romp while sho was gono. Ihoio was a hairbrush with which Mrs. Oressoy was wont to punish violations of the domestic statutes when any such occurred in her well ordered household, nnd the youngsters promised to bo good, and remained as still as mice. , , , Presently Afr. Beeclier arrived to mnn-u » call on tho Cresseys, and found no one to re ceive him but demure-looking boys. A Hash of anticipation came into his eyes as bo joyously told his young hosts to prepare for the romp of their lives. |( ' But mamma told us wo mustn t romp, protested the future doctor pf philosophy. ' I'll take all tho responsibility, replied the great preachor. When Mrs. Oressey neared the house on her return she henrd indications of a small riot, lulled with indignation at this unheard of rebellion in her quiet little republic, she rushed into tlio liouso with words of stern rebuke trembling on hor tongue. At tho door she paused, potrified. Henry Ward Beseher was flat on his back on tho floor, with a parcol of young Indians apparently dancing a ghost dance on his pros trate form, and emitting shrill yells. Tho appearance of the avenger instantly froze all the rebels into silent consternation, excepting tha arch-insurgent. Climbing to his feet, tho unabashed clergyman said: ' Mrs. Oressoy, I promised my friends here to take all the responsibility for this out break, and' — liore he reached ? for the hair brush, and presented it to hor with a Chester fieldian bow — ' I am ready to take whatever is duo them. You may begin at once.' But for once thero was an infraction of tho laws in tho OresBey household that was not punished. Mr. Boechor went unBpanked.
