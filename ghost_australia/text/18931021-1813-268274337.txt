THE WILL-O'-THE-WISP. Nobody nowadays entertains any superstitious ideas about the wiil-c'-the-wisp except, maybe, a few people in is'tilated localities where ignorance of the common natural laws still prevails. The advance of soience has dissipated man ? "of the eld superstitions, and the mythical Jack with" his lantern is one of the subjects of itslrigid investigations in tha material world. The will-o'-the-wii-p is a vory simple affair when one knows about it. It ia a combination of phoaphoretted hydrogen, a combustible gas generated from decaying vegetable matter containing a considerable amount of phosphorite. I A deposit of seeds may throw off ejuoueh of this gas to make a feeble light, though this latter occurs but seldom, and it not infrequently hovers over old wells,- lending a weird, ghostly interest to the old ruins to which it most likely owes its origin. It is not unfrequently mixed with nitrogen and marsh gas. Both gases are combustible, but the will-o'-the-wisp is' ao heavily oharged with phosphorus that it burns spontaneously. ' Carburatted hydrogen, always present in soma degree, plays the part of lantembearer to the psosphoretjted hydrogen, be'ng lighter than air. , I This is the rush-light of the lowlands, which seems always to elude closa pursuit, but this is aasily* accounted for. Tne parsuer, in his chase after tbe phospaaric curiosity, displaces tbe air more or lct.$, driving it before, thus constivitly poshing {his luminous gas away. Should one run away from it, it would mo^t ihioly tarn purs tier. A brisk breeze takes this natural liglrbearer out of sight at once, bat a slight movement of the air will^ give it the weird', uncanny motion and ghost-like suggestion of gome uneasy eoul, prowling about in search of ill-gotten gains, or doing eartliiy penance for its crime.
