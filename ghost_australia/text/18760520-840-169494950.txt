We are constantly ..bearing or reading; . of -gross cases o£ commercial (' fraud.

It , usually happenns that the creditors in ?such an estate are . tlie' first to 'bccbinc ' 'disgusted and denounce the insolvent, because in' his ' efforts to .. avoid the ;coming. catastrophy, he is almost certain - to be persuaded -by sbiAe, particularly sharp creditor to 'giv^ a bill of sale over the whole of liis av'ail . able assets, as the simplest tind easiest mode of tiding over his financial diffi culties., The person who gets the bill of sale is very, profuse in promises of support and assistance to enable' his client to. get clear of his , difficulties , until the transaction is completed^and ' theb,'w'oe betide the -debtor. It is'jiis|t a question of time and opportunity, as rto when and how the bill-of-sale will be realised upon. Sometimes the poor victim is kept on the rack, -until the . last pound is;, squeezed ' out of him ; sometimes he is mercifully put ? out of his misery without having J tp undergo, .a , , yery protracted '.'torture.

The old proverb says'' that ' ''self-preservation is- the . first ,^aw of ^Wature:' ''' 'WJio can blame a merchant or shopkeeper, who is obliged to. seek .-protection in the Insolvent Court; from'taking ca,re that he does not strip himflelf; bare before he allows his ' creditors ? to come in.' It is not honest or honourable according to ' the oldi theory/ but it is '? much' safer and more pleasant, and very much easier to be abld todrctat'e terms with anide little' nest-j egg ready for ^star ting afresh as soon as the' .tro.uble is over— than to have to. admit that.
