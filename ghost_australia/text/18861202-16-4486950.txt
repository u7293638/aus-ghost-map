HOLDING YOUR OWN-"A LA FRANCAISE." (Saturday Review.) It seems to be agreed that M. de Frey- cinet has announccd another expedition to Madagascar. He is supposed to have pro- mised it somewhere in the course of his speech at Toulouse. The particular passage in which he gave the promise in so many words has, apparently), not been reported, for the Freuch Premier said nothing about Madagascar or expeditions, and what he said about colonies was worded in the most judiciously vague way. M. de Frey- cinet was not enthusiastic about the colonies of Fance, and he even referred with apparent approval to the opinion of those persons who do not think that the new ones are of any value at all. Nothing could well sound less enterprising than his almost melancholy recognition of the fact that since France has actually got these posses- sions she must needs keep them unless she is prepared to take a fall. This does not sound like a declaration of a new little war of conquest, and yet it is no doubt the passage in which M. de Freycinet is sup- posed to have announced the re- newal of the most pitiful of all colo- nial adventures. The meaning may seem more than the words can well bear, but then they must be interpreted by the light of a cleai understanding of what a French- man means when he describes his country as in possession of this or that. Judging by what has been going on for years in Uidtrascir, md for some months in the New Hebrides "possession' m his voca hillary means n furn belief th it he ought to possess In the latter eise some rtench men have decidid in their minds that then country has lights of a certmi kind m those islands Accordind^ they hive proceeded to put them in force by istabhshing irmed posts, hoisting lligs md taking other steps of the sainL kind In the linguae of the new dem icntic md Republican st ile crift this is d scribed as seeking for "li immure la plus iivmfageuse on la moina désavun'agi use de les garder,' "they being the said possédions As the Lord High executioner ex ii mis to the Mikido whin his m ijes'y h is ordered a gentleni m to lu belie ided, In is hellt ided, lie is not onlv as good isdcid, but actually de^d mil 1 h it being so, wh\ not si) so?

Kernel in'end wo are infernad to diapuse of their »iib erip tiona in a similar m muir It is understood (says the S M Herald) that steps are to be taken shortly to explore a somewhat recently discovered series of magnifi- cent limestone caves which are known to exist in the Bungendore district. The natural curiosities in question are said to have been visited occasionally by private parties only, and they are situated on the ground of a Mr, Shannon, not far distant from Boro, near Tarago. Thev can be also reached by a journey of a few miles from the main line of railway between Tarago and Bungendore. The opening to them is described as being rather narrow, and on the level, and they are near the headd of a creek. The caverns are alleged to be extremely lofty, ornamented profusely with statactites and extend for at least a mile. The sound of rushing water is to be heard below the floors, and the caves are believed to be in some way connected with the underground drainage of Lake George, which is not far dis- tant.
