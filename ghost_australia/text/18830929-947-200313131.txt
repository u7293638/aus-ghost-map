BRIDPORT (from a correspondent) This uanally quiet little township has been startled somewhat during the past week, by the appearance of a ghost, whioh seems to have boen got up to frighten somo simple boyB, who nearly fainted with fear. It is a great pity, the,; perpetrator of this dastardly aot was not caught by those who went out for that purpose! on Saturday night. l near tnat government nas accepted a tender to fill in the river, with a viow of im proving the channel ; but what is our dismay to find that the work is to be done in the , wrong place. Alas 1 that we should have suoh - short-sighted engineers. Why wero not the' shipping agents and masters of vessels trading* here consulted on this important matter? We are having some fine weather now, the fruit trees are coming out in bloom, the grass is growing, and the snakes are beginning to crawl ' about â€” all signs of spring, and a genial sun.
