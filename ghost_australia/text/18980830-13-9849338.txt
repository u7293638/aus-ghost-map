LAYING A GHOST. EFFECTIVE USE OF A SHOT-GUN. BENDIGO, Monday. The proceedings taken by the young men of the neighbourhood have probably effec- tually "laid" the Bayne-street ghost, as on Sunday night the masquerader was fired at by a party searching for him, and, leav- ing his ghostly mantle, escaped over a fence and disappeared. Shortly after 8 o'clock some youths, armed with a double-barrelled gun, stationed themselves at the corner of Bayne-street and Stewart-street, and had not been waiting long when piercing screams were heard from the corner of the next street. The young men ran to the spot, and found a girl frantic and trembling with fright. She could only utter, "The ghost, the ghost," and swooned away. Turning the corner the lads saw a figure in white moving slowly along the footpath, under the shade of the street trees. One of them fired at it, and without a sound the figure jumped a neighbouring fence, and made off into the garden. The ghostly mantle was dropped in the flight, and when picked up was found to consist of half a dozen yards of white muslin. As it bore shot marks it is more than probable that the ghost was struck by some of the pellets, though he gave no sign. The whole neighbourhood was aroused in a very short time, but though search was made till midnight nothing more was seen of the author of the scare.
