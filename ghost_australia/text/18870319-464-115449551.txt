A GHOST IN THE MUDGEE DISTRICT. Sir Henry Parkes' bald-headed Kiarna ghost has been eclipsed by the fresh young spiritualis tic sensation in the Mudgee district. The report goes that at a place called Cooyal, a mysterious affair happens two or three evenings a week. A family is living in a small hut there, the mother having some time ago left them because she did not like the neighbourhood. Her sons and daughters are simple and unsophisticated people, and they believe that the mother has died, that her spirit has returned to the vicinity of their residence, and several times a week throws stones at their house. The stones appear to drop through the roof, and come through the ceiling of the kitchen. There is an attic between the ceiling and the root hlled witn potatoes, 'lnough there are no holes in the ceiling, the stones are said to drop from there, as many as 40 falling in a single night. A number of sharp-witted residents of Mudgee went out to the place the other evening, and in company with a constable watched for the ghost. About 8 p.m., a stone fell, and others followed at intervals, till about 10.30 p.m., when the spirit apparently went home to bed. The constable and the visitors made every effort to discover where the stones came from, but without avail. They watched both inside and outside of the building, but failed to detect the presence of the stone-thrower. As soou as the stones fall the children of the house pick them up and hand them over to the visitors with feelings of awe. The affair has created some excitement in the district, and is puzzling the minds of many level-headed persons who, up to the present, have been unable to discover a clue to the mystery.
