THE PRESENT, STATE OF THE LABOUR MARKET. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Straw few words on the present business depress sion and scarcity of employment in this and adjoining colonies I trust what I am about to say within accused in hospital in which it is written Many suggestions have been put forth as a remedy for the existing evils, and statements have been made in the public press that the worst has passed the latter are unable to credit, for this reason and there is no use me beat up about the bush on the subject until a more secure and better understanding can be arrived at between C capital and Labour no important improv event as regards employment is likely to take place The average capitalist has had too bitter an experience during the past few years to be anxious to invest his money in any industry in this country without some reason able security 01 obtaining fair interest thereon As one who has taken a keen interest was pretty fair amount of risk in the industries of the country, I am of opinion there is not the ghost of a chance of any sensible man with capital at his command planking down his hundreds of his thousands as a city street many industry so longs workmen insist on the high rates of war as they have been receiving, and so long as the men require the others a race of the absurd rules in the various unions which at present exist Is it not ridiculous that an employee, who is well qualified to see whether a man is fit to do a fair day's work or not, is not permitted to discharge a schemer or an incompetent workman without the sanction of the union to which he belongs, or their representative of Who, I may ask letter able to judge than the person who has got to pay ' And who suffers most now ' Why, the really good, honest, competent man, equally with the scheming agitator and incompetent operative Until good steady workmen can get rid of agitators things will. remain certainly not much better than the by are at present I have an idea, what come of the self-elected leaders will say on this subject, as I have met these men more than once before the late under the late strike, they will declare that I am opposed to the unions I say now, us I said then, that I never was opposed to the union of most whontitit union w s div cited of tyranny but I never would and never will permit any delegate to dictates me v horn I shall employ, or whom I shall die chairs for incompetence And let me say in passing, that in all the companies which I am a dire tor of, and have large interests in, I have never joked whether any of the men were unionists or not I would, if it were possible, be pleased to see the employers and employees meet in some kind way, mutually) bury the hatchet, and discuss what was to be done to remedy the existing evil the men should by this time know that no good can come of the no excuse put forth by agitators I have been thinking that the citizens should appo lied to to subscribe say £5000, and that a number of deserving married men (with families who know something of fanning, should be assisted out of such fund to be settled upon the lands of WJ country, in such places as the Government tug" determine the Government, under the Pecuff circumstances, would no doubt set apart say 100lbs acres of land at a nominal rental or price first men with their families would in a short time is able to make a six inch, and would be a benefit to the country and a blessing to their families If 'JJ scheme can be wrought out, I will give a donation w same and will give my time to further the objects I am, c., JOHN WUUU-.
