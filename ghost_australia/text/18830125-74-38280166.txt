REV. HENRY WARD BEECHER. To the Editor of ihe .Traminner: SItt,-M-lany of your renders were startled by the news from America respecting the above cateumod moinstcr, but, like everything from that quarter, should boe reeived with groat cau tion nod reserve. I have now the Christian Wlorld, November !ith, nod it has an nrticlo on his confession of faith. This was delivered at an nasociation of ministers and delegates, and occupied two hours on delivery, and at its close he intimated his resignation nsa member, but not as a Christian minister, and at its close a unanimous veto was passed, expressning regret that Mr. ]olroher should leanve tbhu Union, nod their confidence in him and his work. In your columns it would not be desirable to enter into 'Mr. Beechot's theological views, only to say they are those of the broad and advanced school of thinkers, but on the grand old doctrinnl truths of the Gospel he in as true as ever. His words are-" I believe in special providence, the oftioanoy of prayer, in the Trinity, the trl personality of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." He believes'fully, enthusiastically, etc., in the divinity of Christ, man as a sinner-" ye must be born nganin"-on atonement, in remission of sins for OChrist's oake, justification by faith, saving faith not a more human not, but wrought by the Spirit of God." Now whence tie out cry of heterodoxy l The sum and substance of his offending appears to be his disbelief in a material hell, and he is not nlono in this, for many of our best men in England agree with him. I have shown enough I hope to allay the alarm and excitement that was cnused by the announcement referred to.-Yours, etc., W. STorae.
