Copper Company were made as under: — Per Thcrmopylie, 7814 ingots; and Port Piric, 8066 ingots." A naval court of inquiry into tho circum stances connected with the loss of the steamer Feima lias been held at Shanghai. The court finds that the master of the British s.s. Hangchow committed a grave error of judg ment in crowding or pressing too closely on the leading British s.s. Feima at such a speed that a collision ensued, for which I10 was en tirely responsible, and he was adjudged to bo severely reprimanded. Tho Hongkong Telegraph, commenting on the fiudiug of tho court, says: — 44 After the collision Captain Arthur did all that a seaman could do to prevent further mischief by keeping the two vessels together until tho Feima was beached, and was so successful that not a single life was Ruermcca. -admitting mat it would have bccu much the wiser course to havo given tho leading vessel a wider berth, and that a Blight error of judgment was actually committed, we arc still unable to gather from tho evidence that Captaiu Arthur was guilty of any carelessness, or ran any particu lar risk that could he foreseen, or did any thing that is not usual under similar circum stances, and, therefore, although the Hang- chow was clearly and solely responsible for the collision, we cannot but consider that the severe censure of tho court was harsh aud uncalled for, and a serious and unjustifi able reflection on the character of as good a sailor and navigator ao ever walked the bridge of c. ship," THE BANKS PENINSULA— A NEW COASTAL STEAMER. Tho steamer Banks Peninsula, which arrived hero yesterday from Hobart, has been chartered by Messrs. Ghcst and Jewctt for tho northern coastal trade. She is a twin-screw vessel of liglitdraught, and should therefore prove well adapted for the trade.

She was very popular as a pas senger vessel 011 the Tasmanian coast. The vessel lias comfortable accommodation for 60 cabin and 30 second cabin passengers. Tho saloon, which is aft, is 'a luxurious apart ment replete with every convenience. Tho Banks Peninsula ia built of steel, and has very good lines.

TTTR TTNTOM RTFAMRTTTP m\tPANY. Tho Outgo Daily Times of December 3 con tains tho balance-sheet for the year ending September 30 of tho Union Steamship Com pany, which was presented to the unnua\ meeting of shareholders held on November 22\. In previous years tho balance-sheet had not been published, hub tho journal referred to states that in view of the interest taken in the New Zealand shipping trade at the preseut moment it had obtained permission to publish it, as well as some interesting details in connection with the work of the company, as explained in the chairman's speech. Tho balance-sheet included tho following figures : — Liabilities. — To capital account (being 59,692 shares at £10), £596,920 ; to reserve fund, £58,000; to now boiler account, £30,000; to special Tasmanian reserve, £20,000 ; to insurance fund, £100,557 5s 7d ; to debentures, £323,206. Assets. — By shipping properly (52stcamcr3 and hulks), 930,393 5a 3d ; by coal, stores, etc., in stock, £64,217 16a 5d ; by buildings, furniture, etc., £36,735 4s lid ; by Sydney wharf property, £104,944 18s 6d. The chairman (Mr. G. M4Lcan, AI.L.C.), in his address to the shareholders, referring to tho figures in the balance-sheet, said, 44 You will notice that the profit 011 working account for lhe year, after making provision for the year's depreciation, is shown at£53,6C6 15s 5d. On the other hand, the charge for interest on debentures and other liabilities, and exchange on remittances, is £17,455 9s 11(1, so that the balance available for distri bution only enables up to pay a dividend of 6 per cent, for t he year. I have already made some reference to the causes of our trade not being so profitable as formerly, sand I may again express regret that the , Hopeful view which I took last year lias not boon borno out. Not only has the volume of trade not been maintained, but the tendency in regard to both passenger and cargo rates has been in the direction of reductions, and theso have not been met by a corresponding increase of traffic. Our desire has always been to make our service as popular as possiblo with the public, so long as we could get a fair return for our shareholders' investment. We have, therefore, from time to time, tried tho effect of reductions in our rates to see whether more people could he induced to travel. On two successive occasions during tho past four years we made large general reductions in our ordinary schedules of fares, hut I cannot say that the sacrifice on our part lias been met by a corresponding increase of traffic. Perhaps tho time 1ms not been opportune, owing to the fact that serious depression lias overtaken all tho colonics. Anyway, the fact remains as I have stated. During tiic winter wo had three of our lineal passcugcr steamers— tho Mararoa, Alauapouri,- and Rotomahana — laid un, as we round they wore not required, 'lhese have juut been rc- commissioned for the present summer traffic, and their places on the Jaid-up list will be taken by some of the cargo steamers and mixed cargo and passenger steamers, which cannot be profitably employed during the summer season, when thorc is no produce trade. Mr. AFLean went on to refer to tho ex penditure of tho company in the following terms : — In order to give some idea of Lhe extent of our operations, Umay tell you that our expenditure for the year for the working expenses of the steamers and their repairs has been something like £820,000. Out of this amount over £320,000 goes in salaries and wages paid directly by tho company, that is, without counting tho wages which arc practically paid by tho company through the medium of the tradesmen who supply the various commodities required in connection with the licet. There are no fewer than 1500 men employed afloat, whose wages iu the year come to £180,000, while no less than £100,000 has been paid during the year in day wages to laborers and mechanics. This is au avorago of fully £1900 per week, and, taking the average wages of each man at 42u per week, it means that steady employment has been provided for 900 men. When, therefore, we include office staff and perma nent outdoor hands at the various brandies, I may say we have directly dependent upon us 110 fewer than 26C0 men, and when you come to take into account their families, the number supported by tho company must be at least 8000. I have only quoted the wages paid direct by the company, but in addition to these, through the medium of our trades men, who do most of our repairs and supply lis with stores, etc., we indirectly support a good many more. The total sum expended during the year in provision supplies for our crews and passengers umoutUs to £89,000, the principal item being meat, of which I find we have consumed 110 loss a quantity than 2,486,2551b., at a cost of £25,646. This is equal to 1110 tons weight of meat, or 41,400 sheep of 601b. eaeli. The average consumption of meat per man per day for passengers, officer.! and crews ex ceeds 2Alb. , ho my English friends who will read tho remarks 1 am now making will ace that tho reputation colonial people get of being large meat-eaters is not ill-founded. lne years oxpcnaicure ior vegeianics aioue amounted to £5500. On fruit there was a similar expenditure. For fish tho expendi ture was £3000. Of bread no fewer than 181,160 loaves were consumed at a cost of £3700, ill addition to lhe bread baked on board the steamers. The consump tion of eggs was .33.000 dozen, cost ing close upon £2000. Poultry and uamo wero used to the valuo of between £4000 and £5000. In addition to these items t here was also a largo expenditure for butter, milk, ice, potatoes, and general groceries, bringing up the total cost of provisions to the amount I have already named. Our coal <»em«n t mihinn in f lii> Kt.nn iru»r.u f.w thr> reached 119,000 tons, of which about half was Now Zealand coal. Then we have expended no less than £32,000 in harbor and light dues iu tho various colonics, while, of course, repairs and renewals come to a very large mini, as also do murine stores, lighterage of cargo, advertising, telegrams, and many other charges which go to make up the sum total of the (lisbursementa in conucctiou with the running of steamers. A M KIUGAN StU P1TN( I STATISTIC 8 In Itis annual report; the United Stales Commissioner of NavieaLion divides ihu .shipping inleresi:; of his country into three brunches-- l he l r.i us- Atlantic, the tram,- 'aeiiic, and the musting-oi which ho savs the third is in a nourishing statu, the uecuiul ia porous but tlireatcocd., and tho firyt hi non-existent, foreign ships have hecn shut 1 out of the coasting trade since 1795, the pro tected American-built coasting sleamer3 are I nnsuipaased on the globe;, and on the great I lakes alone their aggregate tonnage has risen j from 711,269 in "1632 to 1,183,532 in 1992. | The survival of American bhipa on ; the Pacific is attributed to their ! connection with a protected — because deemed I to come under the head of 44 coasting "—line 1 between Sail Francisco and New York, and with a transcontinental railway line. _ The Dominiou Government, the commissioner says, by an expenditure of over £40,000,009, enabled the Canadian Pacific Company not only to build its railway across tho continent, hut to run a line of steamships between British Columbia and China, 'i he Colonial and Imperial Government together subsi dised this line to tins extent of £30,000 a year; while tho American uleauieis ou tho same ocean, for carrying several times as much mail matter, receive only about £16,000. Tho commissioner complains of an attack upon tho 1 dignity us wall as upon the commercial in terests of tho United .States in the shape of a discriminating duty levied by Canada on tea and coffee imported from the Uuitcd States. By way of retaliation he advocates the levy ing of discriminating duties on Asiatic and Australian products imported to the Union from Canada. The commissioner very strongly opposes the proposal of the com mittee of the House of Representatives on tho merchant marine and the fisheries, by which foreign-built vessels would he ad mitted to the domestic as well as tho foreign trade of the United States. Such a policy, lie asserts, would he a more severe blow to lhe ship-builders and shipowners of MIC CUUllWy MUili Ulfj mm v, . v .. from tho Confederate cruisers in the Civil War. ICE IN THE ATLANTIC.— A REMARK- ABLE EXPERIENCE. Alessrs. D. M'Gregor and Co. have for warded for publication a lengthy log report from Captain Bennett, the master of tho barque Fontenaye, giving a most interesting account of his experience in the ice in the .South Atlantic in June last. In concluding Ins report Captain Bennett says : — At day light on the 12th it \va3 blowing a gale from the south-south-east and thick with rain, hut not that thick but it showed the ice ou the weather how on cither tack, and I am very glad to say the opening wc saw Iho uiglit before still norlh-east by north, but much nearer and full of small icebergs. I called all hands aft and told them on either tack, as the- could see, wc had ice on the weather bows, and in 12 hours at the outside she would be on it; but there was au opening north-cast by north of her, small, it was true, but still a passage, as far us f could see, but whether there was pack ice at the buck of it or not I could not say — wo had to take our chance of that ; but i thought it large enough to go through with care, and I wanted them to be quick and smart in carryiug out my orders, and if we struck anything the boats were nil ready aud stored for a considerable time. They were all loud in their cry of 4 Let her go, air ; you have done all that's possible, and wo aro quite willing to take our chances with you.' So, at 8.45, while blowing a south-south-east gale, I let her have top- gallantsails and all lhe jibs, and from 9 until 12 o'clock we wore running through ice, the highest of which was from 200ft. to 300ft. high, and the water covered with small ' ohuuks, none being farther apart than 200yds. At 12.30, thank God, wc had clear water ahead, afler being among the ice four days and nights, and having traversed a dis tance of over 250 miles, as we entered Lhe ice in lat. 44deg. 4min. south, long. 39dcg., 25miu. west, made 63 miles of southing in the ice, and loft it in hit. 44deg. Gmiti. south, long. 34deg. lmin. west. 1 found that it was drifting north east by north about J2 or 14 miles a day, and that it was growing east- south-east and west-north- west, with its north edgo as straight as a line." A MODEL OF THE OCEAN CURRENTS. Au interesting model will ho on exhibi tion at the World's Fair at Chicago next year. It will represent the most, important currents which flow through thu various oceans and other large tracts of -\>ater 011 the surface of the earth. This model is very carefully constructed in a huge tank to give an accurate bird's eye view of the configura tion of the world. Continents, oceans, rivers are all marked in, and small streams of water are ejected through pipes under the model so that the currents move exactly in the same direction and manner ar, they do actually in nature. The course of the currents is clearly shown by a little whito powder, which is thrown 011 the surface of the water. A large map will be placed near the model, giving accurate details as to the direction, strmgth, aud volume of the different ocean currents. The practical value of all this information, combined with a correct and graphic reproduction of the actual motion, will make this exhibit one of tho most interesting of all.
