The latest utterance of the church on the subject was that of the Council of Trent which in its twenty fifth session commanded that the relics of the saints should be honoured and venerated by the faithful that through them many favours might be granted by God to man that was the teaching of the infallible church which no Catholic could doubt Coming to the Hot) Coat now being exhibited at PreveB it was better described as a garment being very similar to that worn by modern J Walks At one time (rev es was the head quarters of the Roman dominion in Belgic Gaul and was very far from being the obscure place it is now to the church of that city) the Empress Iii Jena in the fourth century gave this gar on not of our Lord She undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the express purpose of finding memorials of our Lord s passion 1 xeavationswere made at Calvary and three crosses were found buried there conformably to the custom of the Jews who was to tell which of them was that of our Lord and which were those of the thieves crucified with Only' A test was applied A woman who lay ill in the city was brought and made to touch each of the crosses two of them were without effect the third healed her There could be no doubt about it now It was probable that the Impress bud many antiquarians in her train and it might be taken for granted that proper care was used to guard against imposture Many an moralises the passion were obtained and this garment was amongst them it might be asked, Why was this garment kept ' Sui el) the question should rather be Why should the) not keep its Among ourselves when a great poet or other great man died did we not Venerate ever) in mortal of him'' Even the rooms which Byron use! in New stead Abbey were still kept untouched What wonder was that every memorial of our Lord and Saviour should be carefully treasured and deeply venerated'' A little while ago antiquarians discovered in I got some remains of Die Pharoah's and amongst them the winding sheet of alienates who lived at least 2 000 years before Christ 1 line g garment was now in the British Museum Out of the 30 millions of people in the 1 Engblom perhaps not more til m 10 were fully competent to examine into the historical evidence as to the authenticity of that relic yet the verdict of those 16 men was accepted and proper rly accepted Jvow, the Holy Coat was discovered before the days of printing or of telegraphy and when asked wheat was still evidence for it the answer was The evidence for it is that it is there and the tradition about it has been preserved meat was the evidence for the Holy Coat There were great men in the church at i revel in the fourth century and it was too absurd to suppose that these men conspired to do flared ItYvas too absurd to suppose that the Empress He less would lend herself to a fraud Such a supposition could not be a haunted with respect to any other historical memorial What were the results of these pilgrimages to Treves The cults were found to be the creating of an intense devotion and causing men to change their lives by bringing prominently before them the sufferings of Christ and teach, them what the duties of t IniBtmnit) were the church insisted upon the principle but it did not de clare the absolute authenticity of any particular relic Y Catholic would he con si feared be rash to doubt the authenticity of the Holy Coat but such doubt would be in decorous rather than sinful on his part
