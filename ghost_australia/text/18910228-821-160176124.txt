CHAPTER X. THE OATH OF THE WANDEBER. That night the Wanderer eaw not Meria inun, but on the morrow she sent a messenger to him, bidding him to her feast that night. Ho had little heart to go, but a Queen's courtesy is a command, and be went at sun down. Rci also went to the feast, and as he went, meeting the Wanderer in the ante chamber, be whispered to him that all things were made ready, that a good ship waited him in tn^harbour, tho very ship that he had captured from the SidonianB, and that he, Kei, would be with him by the pylon gate of the temple one hour before midnight. Presently, as he whispered, the doors were flung wide and Meriamun the Queen passed in, followed by eunuchs .and waiting women. She was royally arrayed, her face was pale and cold, but her great eyes glowed in it. Low tho Wanderer bowed before her. She bent her ; head in answer, then gave him her hand, and he led her to the feast. They sat there side by side, but the Queen spoke little, and that little of Pharaoh and the host of the Apura, from whom no tidings came. I When at length the feast was done, Meria mun bade the _ Wanderer to her private chamber, and thither he went for a while, i though sorely against his wilL But Rei came not m with them and thus he was left alone with the Queen—for she dismissed tho waiting ladies. When they had gone there was silence for a while, but ever the Wanderer felt the eyes of Meriamun watching him as though they would read his heart. ., " I am weary," she said, at length. "Tell me of thy wanderings, Odysseus of Ithaca— nay, tell me of the siege of Ilios and of the sinful Helen, who brought all these woes about. Ay, and tell me now thou didst creep from the leaguer of the Achsans, and, wrapped in a beggar's weeds seek speech of this evil Helen, now justly slain of the lie angry gods." "JuStlv slain is she indeed," answered the crafty Wanderer. "An ill thing is it, truly, that the lives of so many heroes should be lost liecause of tho beauty of a faithless woman. I had it in my own heart to slay her when I spoke with her in Troy Towers, but the gods held my hand." "Was it so, indeed ?" said the Queen, smiling darkly. "Doubtless if jet she lived, and thou aaweat her, thou wouldst Blay her. Is it not bo, Odysseus?" " She lives no moro, O Queen," he answered. "Now tell me; yesterday thou wentest up to the temple of the Hathor; tell me what thou didst see in the temple." "I saw a fair woman, or, perchance, an im mortal goddess, stand upon the pylon brow, and as she stood and sang those who looked were bereft of reason. And thereafter some tried to pass the ghosts who guarded the woman and were slain of invisible swords. It was a strange sight to see." "A strange sight, truly. But thon didst not lose thy oraft, Odysseus, nor try to break through the ghosts?" "Nay, Meriamun. In my youth I have looked upon the beauty of Argive Helen, who was fairer than she who stood upon the pylon tower. None who have looked upon the Helen would seek to win the Hathor." "But, perchance, those who have looked upon the Hathor may seek to win the Helen," she answered slowly and he knew not what to say, for he felt the power of her magic on him. So for a while they spoke, and Meriamun, knowing all, wondered much at the guile of the Wanderer, but she showed no wonder in her face. At length he rose, and bowing beforeher, saidthathe must visit theguard that watched the palace gates. She looked upon him strangely and bade him go. Then he went, and right glad he was thus to bo free of her. But when the curtains had swung behind him, Meriamun the Queen sprang to her feet, and a dreadful light of daring burned in her eyes. She clappea her hands, and bade those who oame to her seek their rest, as she would also, for she was weary and needed none to wait upon her. So the women went, leaving her alone, and she passed into her sleeping chamber. "Now muBt the bride deck herself for the bridaL" she said, and straightway, pausing not; drew forth the Ancient Evil from its hiding-place and warmed it on her breast, breathing the breath of life into its nostrils. Now, as before, it grew and wound itself about her, and whispered in her ear, bidding her clothe herself in bridal white and clasp the Evil around lier; then think on the beauty she had seen gather on the face of dead Hataeka in the the temple of Osiris, and on the face of the Bai, and the face of the Ka. She did its command, fearing nothing, for her heart was alight with love, and torn with jealous hate, and little did Bhe reck of the sorrows which her sin should bring forth. So she bathed herself in porfuiues, shook out her shining hair, and clad herself in white attire. Then eho looked upon ber beauty in the mirror of silver, and cried in the bitterness of her heart to the evil that lay beside her like a snake asleep. " Ah, am 1 n'ot fair enow to win him whom I love ? Say, thou evil, must I indeed steal the beauty of another to win him whom I love f' "This must thou do," said the evil, "or lose him in Helen's arms. For though thou art fair, yet is she beauty's self, and her gentleness he loves, and not thy pride. Choose, choose swiftly, for presently the Wanderer goes forth to win the golden Helen." Then she doubted no more, but lifting the shining evil, held it to her. With a dreadful laugh it twined itself about her, and lo ! it shrank to the shape of a girdling, double headed snake of gold, with eyes of ruby flame. And as it shrank Mcriamun the Queen thought on the beauty she hod seen upon the face of dead Hataska, on the face of the Bai, and the | face of the Ka, and all the while she watched I her beauty in the mirror. And as she watched behold her face grew aB the faoe of death, : ashen and hollow, then slowly burned into life ■ again—but all her loveliness was changed. Changed were her dark locks to locks of gold, changed were her deep eyes to eyes of blue, changed was the glory of her pride to the sweetness of Helen's smile. Fairest among women had been her form, now it was fairer yet, and now—now she was beauty's self, and like to swoon at the dream of her own loveliness. "So, ah so, must the Hathor seem," she said, and lo! her voice rang strangely in her cars. For the voice, too, was changed, it was more soft than the whispering of wind-stirred reeds; it was more sweet than the murmuring of bees at noon. I Now she must go forth, and fearful at her own loveliness, and heavy with her sin, yet glad with a strange joy, she passes from nor chamber and glides like a starbeam through the still halls of her palace. The white light of the moon creeps into them and falls upon the faces of the dreadful gods, on the awful smile of sphinxes, and the pictures of her forefathers, kings and queenB who long were dead. And as she goes she Beems to near them whisper I each to each of the dreadful Bin that she has i sinned, and of the sorrow that shall be. But j she does not heed, and never stays her foot. For her heart is alight as with a flame, and she will win the Wanderer to her arms—the Wanderer sought tlirough many lives, found after many deaths. J Now the Wanderer is in his chamber, waiting for the hour to set forth to fihd the golden Helen. His heart is alight, andstrange j dreams of the past go before his eyes, and strange visions of long love to be. His heart j burns like a lamp in the blackness, and by that j light he sees all the days of his life that have been, and all the warn that he has won, and all the seas that he has sailed. _ And now he | knows that those things are dreams indeed, illusions of the outer sense, for there is but one thing true in the life of men, and that is love; them is but one thing perfect, the beauty which is love's robe; there is but one thing which all men seek and are born to find at last, the hoart of tho golden Helen, the World's Desire, that is peace and joy and rest. He binds his armour on him, for foes may lurk in darkness, and takes tho bow of liury tus, and the grey bolts of death; for, por chance, the fight is not yet done, and he must cleave his way to joy. Then ho combs his locks and sets the golden helm upon them, and, praying to the gods (ah! the gods aro deaf), passes from his chamber. Now the chamber opened into a great hall of pillars. As was bis custom when he went alone by night, the Wanderer glanced warily down the dusky hall, but little might ho see because of the shadows. Nevertheless, the moonlight poured into the centre of the hall from the clerestories in the roof, and lay there j shining white as water beneath black banks of reeds. Again the Wanderer glanced with keen, quiok eyes, for there was a sense in his heart that he was no more alone in the ball, though whether it were man or ghost, or, perchance, one of the immortal gods who looked on him, he might not tell. Now it seemed to him that he saw a shape of white moving far away in. the shadow. Then he grasped the black bow and laid hand unon his quiver so that the shafts rattled. Now it would seem that the shape in the i shadow heard the rattling of tho shafts, or perchance it was the moonlight gleam upon the Wanderer's golden harness—at tho least it drew near till it came to tho edge of the pool of light. There it paused as a bather pauses ere she steps into the fountain. The Wan derer paused also, wondering what tho shape might be. Half was he minded to try it with an arrow from the bow, but he held his hand and watched. And ae ho watched the white shape glided into the space of moonlight, and he saw that it was the form of a woman draped in white, • and that about her shone a gleaming girdle, and in the girdle gems which sparkled like the eyes of a snake. Tall was the shape and lovely as a statue of Aphrodite; but who or what it was he might not tell, for the head was bent and the face hidden. Awhile the shape stood thus, and as it stood the Wanderer, drawn by wonder, passed towards it, till ho also stood in the pool of moonlight that shimmered on his golden maiL { Then suddenly the Bhape lifted its face so that the light fell full on it, and stretched out its arms towards him, and lo 1 the face was the ; faoe of Argive Helen—of her whom he went '> forth to seek. He looked upon its beauty, he ; looked upon the eyes ef blue, upon the golden hair, upon the shining arms; then slowly, very slowly, and in silence—for he could find no words—the Wanderer drew near. She did not move nor speak. So still she stood that scarce she seemed to breathe. Only the shining eyes of her snake-girdle glittered like living things. Again he stopped fearfully, for he held that this was surely a mocking ghost which stood before him, but still she neither moved nor spoke. Then at length he found hiB tongue and epoke— "Lady," he whispered, " is it indeed thou, is it Argive Helen whom I look upon, or is it, perchance, a ghost sent by Queen Persephone from the house of Hades to make a mock of me?" Now the vpioe of Helen answered him in sweet tones and low— I "Hid I not tell thee, Odysseus oflthaoa, did I not tell thee yesterday, in the balls of Hathor, after thou hodst overcome the ghosts, that to-night we should be wed ? Wherefore, 1 then, dost thou deem me of the number of the bodiless J" J The Wanderer hearkened. The voice was the voice of Helen, the eyes were the eyes of Helen, and yet his heart feared guile. " So did Argive Helen tell me of a truth, lady, but this she said, that I should find her by the pylon of the temple, and lead her thence to be my bride. Thither I go but now to seek her. But if thou art Helen, how oomest thou to these palace halls? And where, lady, is that red star which should gleam upon thy breast, that star which weep3 out the blood of men?'' "No mora doth the red daw fall from the star that was set upon my breast, Odysseus, for now that thou host won me inen die no more for my beauty's sake. Gone is the Htar of war; and see, wisdom rings mo round, tho symbol of the deathless snake that signifies lovo eternal. Thou dost ask how I camo hither, I, who am immortal and a daughter of god ? Seek not to know, Odysseus, for where fate puts it in my mind to be, there do the gods bear me. Wouldet thou then, that I leave thee, Odys seus?" " Last of all things do I desire this," he answered, for now his wisdom went a wander ing ; now ho forgot the words of Aphrodite, warning him that the Helen might be known by one thing only, the red star on her breast, whence falls the blood of men; and he no more doubted but that she was the golden Helen. Then she who wore the Helen's shape stretched out her arms and smiled so sweetly that the Wanderer know nothing any more, save that she drew him to her. Slowly she glided before him, ever smiling, and whore she went he followed, as men follow beauty in a dream. She led him through hallB and .comdoi-s, past the sculptured statues of the gods, past man-headed sphinxes, and pictures of long dead kings. And ob she goes, once more it seems to her that she hears them whisper each to each of the horror of her sin and the sorrow that shall be. But nought she heeds whoever leads him on, and nought:he bears whoever follows after, till at length, though he knows it not, I they stand in the bed-chamber of the Queen, ' and by Pharaoh's golden bed. j Then once more she speaks— j " Odysseus of Ithaca, whom I have loved from the beginning, and whom I shall love till all deaths are done, before thee stands that loveliness which tho gods predestined to thy arms. Now take thou thy bride; but first lay thy hand upon this golden snake, that rings me round, the new bridal gift of the gods, and swear thy marriage oath, which may not be broken. Swear thus, Odysseus:—" I love thee, woman or immortal, ana thee alone, and by whatever name thou art called, and ia what ever ehape thou goest, to thee will I cleave, and to thee alone, till the day of the passing of time. I will forgive thy sins, I will soothe thy sorrows, I will suffer none to come betwixt thee and me. This I swear to thee, woman or immortal, who dost stand before me. I swear it to thee, woman for now and for ever, for here and hereafter, in whatever shape thou goest on tho earth, by whatever name thou art known among men.' "Swear thou thus, Odysseus of Ithaca, Laertes' son, or leave me and go thy ways !" "Great is theoath," quoth the Wanderer; for though now he feared no guilo, yet his crafty heart liked it ill. " Choose, and choose swiftly," she answered. " Swear the oath, or leave me and never see me more!" " Leave thee I will not, and cannot if 1 would," he said. " Lady, I swear!" And he laid his band upon the snake that ringed her round, and swore the dreadful oath. Yea, he forgot the words of the goddess, and the words of Helen, aud he swore by the snake who should have sworn by the star. By tho immortal gods he swore it, by the symbol of the snake, and by the beauty of his brido. And as he swore the eyes of the serpent sparkled, and the eyes of her who wore the beauty of Helen shone, and faintly the black bow of Kurytus thrilled, foreboding death and war. But naught the Wanderer thought on guile or war or death, for the kiss of her whom he deemed the golcen Helen was on his lips, and he went up into the golden bed of Meriamun. For he had forgotten the words of the god dess—he had sworn by tho snake who should have sworn by the star.
