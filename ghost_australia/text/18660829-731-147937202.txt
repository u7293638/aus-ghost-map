CORRESPONDENCE. (To the Editor of the Chronicle.) SIR, â€” I perceive by your paper that the Primary School is not yet paid for. Now, as the good folks of Maryborough have proved they are fond of amusements, cannot some of the ladies and gentlemen of the town get up some sort of an entertainment, the proceeds of which could be applied to the payment of the debt incurred? The same has been tried in Gladstone and Gayndah with success. I believe we have more talent in Maryborough than Gladstone or Gayndah, but we are too modest. Try, Mr. Editor, if you can bring them out. Yours, &c.;, HAMLETS GHOST. Maryborough, 27th August.
