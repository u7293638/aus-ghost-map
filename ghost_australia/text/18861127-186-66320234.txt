ChaptekXVTIL— The Mistoess of Nether ' Shall I go, or shall I not go !' meditated Hugo LuttrelL He was lying on a broad, ;comf ortablelook ing lounge in one of the luxurious rooms which le usually occupied when he stayed for any length of time in London. He bad been smoking a dainty, perfumed cigarette — he very seldom smoked anything except cigarettes — bat be held it absently between his fingers, and finally let it drop, while he read and re read a letter which his servant hafl just brought to him. Nearly two years had passed since Richard LuttrelTs death ; years which had left their mark npon Hugo in many ways. The lines of his delicately beautiful dark face had grown harder and sharper; and, perhaps on this account, he had a distinctly older look than was warranted by his two- and-twenty years. There were worn Hnps about his eyes, and a decided increase of that subtlety of expression which gave something of an Oriental character to his appearance. He had lost the youthful, almost boyish, look which had characterised him two years ago ; he was a man now, but hardly a 'inn whom one would have found it easy to trust. The letter was from Angela Vivian. She had written, at Mrs. LuttreU's request, to ask Hugo to pay them a visit. Mrs, Luttrell still occupied the house at Netherglen ; and she seemed anxious for an interview with her nephew. Hago had not seen her for many months ; he had left Scotland almost immediately after Brian's departure, with Bat he had then considered himself tolerably prosperous. Brian's death bad thrown a shade over his prospects. He could no longer count upon a successful application to Mr. Colqu houn, if he were in difficulties ; and Brian's six thousand pounds melted before his require ments like snow before an April sun. He had already squandered the greater part of it ; he was deeply in debt ; and he had no relation npon whom he could rely for assistance — un- less it were Mrs. Luttrell ; and Hugo had a definite dislike to the thought of nffc'»'g Mrs. Luttrell for money. It was no more than a dislike, however. It was an ntiplgmmTif. ffointr to do perhaps ; but not a t- hi tij that he would refrain from doing, if necessary. Why should not Mrs. Luttrell be generous to her nephew? Possibly she wished to make him her heir ; possibly she would oner to pay his debts ; at any rate he could not afford to decline her help. So he most start for K«tberglen next day. ' Netherglen ! They are still there,' he said to himslf, as he stared moodily at the sheet of black -edged note-paper, an which the name of the house was stamped in t'T'-H black letters. ' I wonder that they did not leave the place. I should have done so if I had been Aunt Margaret. I would give a great deal to get out of going to it myself I' A sombre look stole over hia f&ce; hishand clenched itself over the paper that he held ; in spite of the luxurious warmth of the room, he gave a little shiver. Then he rose and bestirred himself ; his nature was not one that impelled him to dwell for very long upon any painful or disturbing thought. He gave his orders about the journey for the following day, then dressed and went out, remembering that be had two or three engage ments for the evening. The season was nearly over, and many people had left London, but there seemed little diminution in the number of guests, who were struggling up and down the wide staircase of a house at which Hugo presented himself about twelve o'clock that night, and he missed very few faipfli**' faces amongst the crowd as he nodded greetings to ' Ah, LuttreLL' said a voice at his ear, ' I was wondering if I should see you. I thought you might be off to Scotland already.' ' Who told you I was going to Scotland ?' said Hugo. The dark shadow had crossed his face again ; if there was a T'an in England whom at that time he cordially disliked, it was this man — Angela's brother — Rupert Vivian. He did not know why, but he always had a presage of diaawtpr when he saw the high-bred, impassive face beside him, or heard the modulation of Vivian's quiet, musical voice, Hugo was Rupert Vivian's presence brought bim ill luck. ' Angela wrote to me that Mrs. Luttrell was inviting 'you to Nether-glen. I was going there myself, but I have been prevented. A relation of mine in Wales is dying, and has sent for me, so I may not be able to get to Scotland for some weeks. ' ' Sorry not to see you. I shall be gone by the time yoa reach Scotland, then,' responded Hugo, amiably. ' Yes.' Rupert looked down with a re flective air. ** Come here, will you 1' be B&id; drawing Hugo aside into a small curtained recess, with a seat just wide enough for two, which happened at that moment to be empty. *' I have something to ask you ; there is something that you can do for me if you will.' ** Happy to do anything in my power,' murmured Hugo. He did not Hke to be asked to help other people, bat there was a want of assurance in Vivian's usually self - curiosity. ?? Whut is it ?' '* WelL to begin with, you know the Herons ' I know them by Dame. I have met ' Do you know that they bave returned, rather unexpectedly from Italy and gone to Strathleckie, the house on the other side of the property — about eix miles from Nether glen ?' '* How's that?*1 ' I suppose that Miss Murray thinks she may as well take possession of her estate, ' replied Rupert, rather shortly. ' May I ask whether you are ^oing to call ?' ** Oh, yes, I shall certainly call.' 'Then, look here, Luttrell, I want you to do something' for me.' said Vivian, foiling into a more friendly and confidential strain than be usually employed with Hugo. *4 Will to Mrs. Heron the reason why I have not come to Scotland ? the ^lajm that my relation in Wales t»« on me, and all that sort of jjhjng * It is hardly worth while writing about it, perhaps ; still, if it came in your way, you might do me a service.' lingo was so much relieved to £sd nnthing more difficnlt required of him that he gave vent to a light laugh. ' Why don't you write !' he said. ' There's nothing to write about. I do not correspond with them,' said Rupert, actually colouring a little beneath Hugo's long, satirical gaze. ' But I fancy they may think me neglectful. I promised, some time ago that I would run down ; and I don't see how I can ? until November at the earliest. And if you are there, you may as well mention the reason for my going to Wales, or, you see, it will look like a positive slight.' ' I'm to say all this to Mrs. Heron, am I* And to no one beside ?n ' That will be quite sufficient.' There was a slight touch of hauteur in Vivian's tone. ' And, if I may trouble you with something ' No trouble at alL Another message V* ' Not exactly. If you would take care of this little packet for me I should be glad. I am afraid of its being crushed or lost in the post. It is for Miss Heron.*9 He produced a little parcel, carefully sealed and addressed. It looked like a small square box. Hugo smiled as he took it in his hand. ' Perishable ?' he asked carelessly, ' Not exactly. The contents are fully a hundred years old already. It is something for Miss Heron's birthday. She ia a great favourite of mine — a nice little girL' f * Quite a child, I suppose ?' ' Oh, of coarse. One won't be able to send her presents by and by,' said Rupert, with rather an uneasy laugh. '* What a pity it is that some children ever grow up ! Well, thanks, Hugo ; I shall be very much obliged to you. Are you going now ?' ' Must be moving on, I suppose* I saw old Colquhoun the other day! and he began telling me about Miss Murray, and all the wonders she was doing for the Herons. Makes believe that the money is theirs, not her own. doesn't she V ' Yes.' 'Odd idea. She must be a curiosity. They bronght a tutor with them from Italy, I believe : some fellow they picked np in the streets.' 'He hag turned out a very satisfactory one,' Rupert answered, coldly. 'They say' that he makes a capital tutor for the little boys. I think he is a favourite with all of them ; he teaches Mis* Heron Italian.' Tfi« voice had fo-kfn a curiously formal tone. It aoonded as though he was 'i^rnpfl at something which had occurred to him. Hugo thought of that tone and of the conversation many times beforelie left T^mAn^ next evening. He was rather an adept at the discovery of small mysteries ; he liked to draw conclusions from a series of unaU events, and to ferret out other people's secrets. He thought that he was now upon the track of some design of Vivian's, and he Vcmth* exceedingly curious about it. If it had been possible to open the box without distorting the seals upon it, he would certainly have done so ; but, thie being out of the question, he contented HmnpTf ^{th resolving to be present when it was opened, and to observe with care the effect prodnced by Virian*j message on the faces of Mrs. Heron, Min Heron, and Miss Murray. He reached Dunmnir (where the nearest station to his aunfe house was situated) at eleven o'clock in the morning. Mrs. Luttrell had sent the maU-ptueton for him. As Hugo took the reins and glanced at the shining harness and the lustrous coats of the beautiful bays, be could not help remembering the day when the mail-phseton had last been sent to bring him from the station. Richard had then sat in the place that be now occupied, with Angela beside bim ; and Brian and Hngo laughed and talked in the back, and were aa merry as they well could be. Nearly two years ago ! What changes had been seen since then ! The bays were fidgetty, and would not start at once. Hugo was just shouting a hasty direction to the groom at their heads when be happened to glance aside towards the station door where two or three persons were standing. The groom had cause to wonder what was tbe matter. Hugo gave the reins a tremendous jerk, which brought the horses nearly upon tfr^**** hannches, and then let them go at such a pace that it seemed as if he had entirely lost control over them. But be was a very good whip, and soon mastered the fiery creatures, reducing their mad speed by degrees to a gentle trot, which enabled the groom to overtake them, panting and re J iu the face, indeed, as he strong bid' self up behind. The groom was inclined to think that Mr. Hngo had Lost his nerve for a few moments ; for ' his face turned as white,' honest John remarked afterwards, ** as if he had seen a ghost.' 'John,'1 said Hugo, after driving for a good two miles in silence, ' who was that 'Gentleman, sir?' ' A young man— at least, he seemed young — in a great -coat. ' ' Oh ! — I don't think that's a ycnaig gentleman, exactly ; leastways he's got grey hair. That's the gentleman that teaches at Mr. Heron's, sir ; Mr. Heron, the uncle to Miss Murray that has the property now. His names Mr. Stretton, sir. I asked Mr. Heron's coachman.' ** What made you ask ?' The groom hesitated and shuffled ; but, upon being kept sharply to the point, avowed that it was because the gentleman ' seen from behind' looked so much like Mr. Brian LuttrelL 'Of course iiis face is quite different from Mr. Brian's, sir,1* he said, hastily, noting a shadow opon Hugo's brow ; *' and he has grey bair and a b^sxdt aud all I that ; but his walk was a little like pour Mr. Brian's, sir, I thought.' | Hugo vaa silent. He bad not noticed the man'ssait, but, in spite of tbsgrey hair, the fannrfl fmnplffTi'' ) tnc uruwu oe*xu^— wtuch had lately been allowed to cover tiie lower port of Mr. Stretton'e face, and had changed it very greatly — in spite of all these things be had noticed, and been atarfcled by, the expression of a pair of grave, brown eyea — graver and aadder than Brian's eyes used to be, bat full of the tenderness and the sweet ness that Qiluo H*^ never seen in the face of any other man. Full also of recognition ; there waa the rob. A man who knows yon cannot look at you in the same way as one who fcnowB yon not, and it was this look of knowledge which had unnerved Hugo, and made him doubt the evidence of bis own He was still silent and absorbed when be arrived at Netherglen, and felt glad to hear that he was not to see his aunt until later in the day. A«g**T* came to meet him at- the door ; she was pale, and her black dress made hier look very slender and fragile, bat she had the old sweet smile and pleasant words of welcome for h*'1! and could not understand why his face was bo gloomy, and his eyes bo obstinately averted from her own. It was four o'clock in the afternoon when Hugo 'was admitted to Mrs. LuttreU's sitting roam. He had scarcely Been her since the death of her eldest son, and was manifestly startled and shocked to see her looking so much more aged and worn tb»' she had been two yean 9co. She greeted him much after her usual fashion, however; she allowed him to touch her smooth, cold cheek with his lips, and take her stiff hand into bis own, but she showed no trace of any softening emotion. 'Sit down, Hugo,' she said. ' I am sorry to have brought yon away from your friends.' 'On, I was glad to come,' said Hugo, confusedly, ' I was not with friends ; I was in town. It was late for town, but I — I had ' 'This house is no longer a cheerful one,' contained Mrs. LuttreQ, in a cold, monotonous ▼Dice. ' There are no attractions for young w(|^n now. -It has rxwm a house, of tnnnminp. I could not expect you to visit me.' ' Indeed, Aunt Margaret, I would have come if I had known that you wanted me,' said Hugo, wondering whether bis tardiness would entail the Iosb of Mrs. LuttxelTs money. fie recovered his self-possession and his flneocv mX t^M thought ; if danger were near, it behoved him to be on the alert. ' I have waited,' said Mrs. LuttreU. 'Bat I conliLwait. I knew that yon would come in time. Now, listen to what I have to say.' Hd^d held his breath. What could she say that needed ail thir preamble ? 'Hugo LnttreU,' his aunt began, very deliberately, ' you are a poor man, and an extravagant one.*1 Hugo smiled, and bowed his head. 'Bat yon are only extravagant. Yon are not ricutiu. You have never done a dishonour able tiling — one for which yon need blush or fear, to meet the eye of an honest man? Answer me that, Hugo. I may know what you will say, but I want to hear it from your own lips.** ' Hngo did not fl*™**! His face assumed the ?wyiflh f nrww**w^ t1^ PTprfffKinn which bad often stood nun in good stead. His great, dark eyesi looked boldly into hers. 'That ia all true. Aunt Margaret. I may I have been extravagant, as you say, but I have not been dishonourable. w He could not have dared to say bo much if Richard or Brian had been alive to contradict hyin ; but they were rai dy out of tbp way and be could s»jr what he chose. .''Tlwn I can trust you, Hugo.' 'I will try to be worthy of your trust, Aunt Margaret. ' fulf fbreigu fashion. , but she drew it somewhat hastily away. ' No. None of your Sicilian ways for me, Hugo.

I want to hare a talk «ith you about the house and the property and bo oil ' '* I ehall be glad if I can do anything to help y oil,' said Hugo, smoothly. His cheek was beginning to flash ; he wished that his aunt would come to the point. Suspense was very trying ! But Mrs. Luttrell seemed to be in no horn., ?* Ton know, perhaps,' she said. ** that I am a toIeraMy rich woman etilL The land, the farms, and the moors, and all that part ot the property passed to Miss Murray npou my son's death ; but this hoase and the grounds (thongh not the lock nor the woods) are still mine, and I have a fair income with which to keep them up. 1 should like to know that me. 1 should like to know that there would be LuttreUe of NethergLen for many years to She paused, a. few minutes, bat Hugo made no reply. ' I have a proposition to make to you,' she went on prtatntly. ?' I don't make it with out conditions. You shall hear what they are by and by. I bhoulu like to mike you my anyone 1 choose.

'The question is, will you agree to the conditions oq which I leave my money to you ?' '* I will do anything in nay power,' murmured Hugo.

She had not required so much of Richard or Brian ; why should she aak for such a sacrifice from him ? Mrs. Luttrell watched bis face, and read pretty clearly the meaning of the various ex pressions which chased each other across it. ' It seems a bard thine to you at first, no doubt,' abe aaid, composedly. 'But you would find interests and ?»pnBgmfnt. in course of time. Yon would have eix months of the year in which to go abroad, or to divert your self in London, Yon should have a sufficient jnngme And my other condition is that you marry as soon as you can finda suitable wife.'

I should like to see you married, and have your child r*1' tLil-t*'iriE **P about me.' ** Perhaps you have thought of a suitable lady ?' said Hugo, with a half sneer. I he prospect that had seemed so desirable at first was now very lowered in his estimation, and he did not disguise the sullen anger that he felt. Bat he hardly expected Mrs. LuttrelTs answer. 'Yes, I have.' 'Indeed! Who is it?' 'Mies Murray. Elizabeth Murray, to whom your cousin's estates have gone.' ' What sort of a person is she V 'Young, beautiful, rich. A little older than yourself, but not mack. Vou would make a fine couple, Hugo. She came to see me the other day, and you would have thought she was a princess.'
