j. JUB MELBOURNE LETTER. in i FROST OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. September 18., 1 Three fine days in succession has made us feel as though there was really a chance of drying off the blue mould with which the long continued bad weather has so plentifully) adorned us After the break afforded by the Show week we drifted back into the wet and wintry slough of despond from which we had for so brief a space method and to the end of last week the process of moistening our claimed in the pleasant figurative sense of the phrase but in its most unpleasant literal acceptation went steadily on till we begun unconsciously to mutter Dirty days hath September Quite the worst that I remember; VII the rest with thirty-one Brought no blessed gleam of sun Thank the Lord there are no more To prolong the endless pour, Or they d be with two and thirty. Just as wet and twice as duty Now however, we are enjoying truly vernal brightness and sunshine and we are far h reveille g in our new experience Our present Parliament now very near its end appears to be dying of senile de- bility It can only last about another for Jinghi and its members are devoted us so much attention to their future chances that they have very little to bestow on present duties The last week has been chiefly devoted to a railway wrong e and to the among of other matters introduced by private members and it is clear that no more will be done beyond the unavoidable the estimates and the Federal 3-lee toral Bill The railway subject is a way is a contentious one because there are so many em mug to get back to the old days of political patronage when there were logs to be rolled spoils to be cop tured and constituencies to be bought at the expense of the Treasury The men of light and lending desire to preserve the present arrangement but the jackals are a hungry pack and hope to prevail by reason of their continuous v apping The woman s suffrage movement is Illus tracing the progress of Retrogression As the result of the said petition a 1 the interest is out of it and the Council has postponed the consideration of the bill for yet another week A public meeting in support of the suffragists was held in the Town-hall on Monday night at which the usual speakers orated but they were as pelicans in the wilderness or spar rows upon the housetop Mr Maloney (West Melbourne) gave the movement of which he is on ardent champion a bad book binder in the Assembly last night by eliciting the definite information from the Speaker that regarding the old 30,000 (?) re petition of which so much has been heard the number of signatures was 26 try of which several thousands had been wrongly affixed A large number of signatures had evidently been written by the one hand at the one time in the same ink There were as many OF "0 in one lot of these running down to lots of 20 There were also signatures of men attached but there was no restriction in the heading of the petition as to the age of the signatories The Speaker concluded by saying the petition was on view in his room This came out of an unsuccessful at tempt made by Mr Maloney to make the Women's Suffrage Bill a clause of the Federal Electoral Bill a matter which led to a hot exchange between the mover and Mr Uren with Richmond objected to West Melbourne s proposal West Melbourne retorted that he never did believe in Itirli mond's sincerity Richmond reminded AV M that his opportunities for observa- tion had been limited as he had been two years absent teaching a frog to jump a cruel reference to the electric heating business which got AV M into such trouble at Edinburgh and his col- c league into gaol. W.M. furiously dec need that he would rather teach a frog to jump than live in luxury while his step-mother was in the Benevolent Asylum. The House cried "shame" But W M. was not to be pacified, and Kept on roaring out, "It's true it's true'" "These be thy gods, O Israel'" In one of the foregoing paragraphs have said that attention is now being directed to the consistencies and to the campaign that has already begun. So far it would seem that our State Parliament will suffer by the coming change The best men are going for the Federal Pal lament and there is a rush of the discredit ed to fill their places. All the old dead beats, Weary' Willies, and political Bur don ners are again on the parliamentary wallaby track. To change the metaphor, it would seem as if the ghosts and skele- tons of those long and happily lost to the public life they signally failed to attain had gathered from their cemeteries and bone yards in the vain hope of again winning their way to place and^,pee.liin¡r=. Prominent among them are the land boomsters, whose tracks were marked with the nuns and disasters of 1892. The prospect of their election is very remote, because Victorian electors have, as a rule, a preference, for men of common!) clean records The reference to the "boom" reminds me to say that we have pretty were used out of the valley of that shadow, and a prosaic but forcible evidence of the fact ¡ is furnished by the resurrection of the brick cart. When it was in full blast, the long processions of these days was a city feature more notable than convenient With its collapse they disappeared under ly, and apparently became extinct. For years there VTOB not one to be seen, and the business of brick-making stood still Now they are stirring again in things. Building is going forward steadily and increasingly, especially in the more convenient southern suburbs. About Hawksburn, Toorak, Armadale, and Malvern whole streets of comfortable villas have sprung up The price of land has advanced, in some cases it has more than doubled the rates asked two and three years ago, and the exchange is healthy. It is not at all a boom movement, but a sound and natural process of recovery. Another evidence of all-round improvement is all-round strikes When work is slack and wages low, the men who suffer most naturally make the loudest outcry. When the improvement sets in they not infrequently devote themselves to sawing through the bones on which they are seated With the star in the brick him ness the bricklayers started to make trouble With the rise in coal the coal miners are talking of going on strike and to prove how little work is wanted by the miners a big strike is imminent because among other things the unionists object to work with non unionists They will be siiTPRsful in this matter for as the mining companies will Blmt down there I will be no work for either The election of a member of the University, Council which so loudly) thundered in the index look place very quiet!) on Friday last The circumstances which gave it special interest were those arising out of the Marshall Hall discussion The refusal to le appoint him to the Ormond Chair of Music was carried after heated debate by the casting vote of the chair. Mr. A W Howitt voted against the re appointment and shortly) after retired by effluxion of time The proposal' ites there fore conceived that if they could return a man favourable to the discredited professor they could reverse the decision and the Rev. E. H. Sugden master of Queens was started as their candidate while Judge Molesworth was nominated as the anti Hull ite During the fierce conti every What prevailed immediately on the announcement of the nominations Mr Sugden declared that he was not pledged to support the re opening of the Hall case but he would not pledge him self on the other side After the storm came a calm during which each party worked strenuously There are about 500 votes and the heavy poll tells how close 'v they were canvassed Results were - Sudgen 218 Molesworth 210 majority 3 If an attempt is now made to reverse the decision already arrived at the fight will rage more fiercely than ever and me parable harm will be done the Universt by The Stock Exchanges have been much exercise during the past week over the Glenfine No 1 affair It is another Mount Hoaxlej business and has resulted in the arrest of three men one of whom has confessed that he did the salting at the instigation of his brother one of the others arrested He added enough gold to make flic 27th of stone tested at 1 a Ballarat School of Mines battery KO 15dwt Still that was not too bad and though both the mine manager and legal manner Mr expressed their surprise the slides jumped from 6s to about 25s Then came the bull crushing of 10 tons 6 at the year Speedwell battery and 4 at the School of Mines for the respective re tumsofSlwt lOgis and 2 dwt "grs The company the Ba larat exchange the Melbourne Exchange and the Government move! promptly in the matter and offered row aids for the detection of the culprit so that- the arrest and confess on are regarded as being very satisfactory By the way are salting is by no means a modern industry Do you remember how Ali Ales Montgomery scored in connection with the historic Tasmanian Mount Huxley case' Anyhow it bears retelling Despite the unfavourable report he based upon his first flying visit the business of booming the wonderful discovery (made in old workings) went steadily on and the gold obtained was freely shown So he went a second time and from what he saw and heard he entertained a shrewd suspicion not only that the stone had been salted but also ' as to the matter. He therefore broke out a bag of specimens himself, addressed them to the late Mr. Belstead, and despatched them by the hand of the suspect to the nearest post office for transmission to Hobart, there to be crushed and assay- ed what he did not entrust to the suspect was his telegram to Belstead direct- ing him to have every bit of that stone scrubbed with a nail brush before crush- ing and to pan off the dirt in addition to testing the ore. This was done, and while the result made it evident that the chief value of the stone lay in its almost absolute freedom from auriferous impor lay the dust went at the vote of Berne 1,200 to the load' Formed in ore salting was an art by no means infrequently practised in Victoria, and many stones are told of the extent to which it was carried in the old days One of the best remembered cases was the treatment of a Black Hill mine by an artist who fired a charge of gold for our an old pistol into the stone This was in imitation of the Colorado gentleman who chopped up some dollars, loaded a blun- discuss with the silver slugs and then fired it into the stone of a mine which, on the visible evidences of its argentiferous wealth, he sold at a high figure to a visiting tenderfoot three days later The purchaser was sure that he had bought a fortune AA'hj ' he could even pick the pine silver out of the one in lumps with the point of his knife He actually did so but even his suspicions were aroused when he found on one battered piece of precious metal the enigmatical letters TED STV Dramatically, the days are rather dull in Melbourne just now "The Christian" is still storming away at Her Majesty's but to the houses and the general opinion appears to be that a very capable actor and actress are being thrown away upon the production of a very unpleasant play John F Sheridan is back at the Royal with "A Trip to Chicago in which the Widow O Brien is transformed into Afrs Joanna Murphy The lady has, however changed nothing more than her name and surroundings, and she is still as laughter moving as before There is nothing high class about the melange, but it is very diverting The chorus still has full possession of the Princess but the principals are not far off, and for the present we Rre realis- ing the qualified pleasure of anticipation
