But, I clearly, if the show could not . he held -now j owing to the poor condition of i5he sheep, it could not be held successfully if rain had fallen during the last fortnight. If sheep are as poor as represented at the end of ^April, all : the rain in &e;|nrc£ld would not malw them, fit to exhibit by tie 25th of May, and an -j earlier decision might have been 'arrived at ; to the advantage at least {of those who l have^already made some preparation for' ex- : hibiting. It is quite right- to attach tie ' highest importance to the sheep exhibits, but they do not constitute the ehowy the whole j show and nothing but the show. The horse I sections represent an essentially important elgpaat. and as far as the pnb|jc fs^incerned. (ne most mteresting^JClffion. A show^wilii^J out sheep might be like Hamlet without the ghost, but on the other hand tie ghost un supported by the otier characters would make but a very poor representation of Hamlet. Tie sum total of all this is, that in tie interests of the Association, rather than of any section of it, an increased rigidity should be manifest in the announcements as to hold the periodical exhibitions. It is surely possible early in April to decide whether or not it is advisable to hold a show. If it is thought desirable to hold one then; the announcement can be made and arrange ments proceeded viti. If the outlook is not favorable, there is an end to ilw matteij tie Association is saved a lot of : unnecessary ex- j pense, it is «aved the' loss of prestige which to a certain extent must follow a break in its programme, and no,, loss or annoyance is occasioned, to intending exhibitors, by pre paring stock for a show which will be knocked on the head at the last minute. It would farther have this result. It would disseminate throughout the colony the advantageous belief in the Central Australian P. and A. Associa tion, that when it announced that it intended to' hold a show, it would do so. * # # * *? The Association having withdrawn front the field for the present year,. the way is open for an impartial consideration -of an idea, which has .apparently been floating about yi Snore piiirclfi tian-one -33batris, a fnll-bldiiBj ^joWoieing- impossible, tp fiiibstiiute a horse* paraile for this year.

The chief drawback to carrying out such a proposal is the limited time which is now left at disposal. A horse parade, too, conducted by itself, is better held at a much earlier period of the year. But, even allowing -for these drawbacks, ithere is iime/to .work oui- a, success ifthe.;n&tteribe; started -it; once and proseeut^ -witKfenergy. As a social re-union-, it would proyidea fairly effective substitute for the show, and this social element is not the last or the least of the advantageous results of these annual exhibitions. The Bowing Club is billed with its annual bail at the end of the month, and the horse parade fixed, for a contiguous date would, with that event, form lie load' stone attracting- those who invariably regard, the show as the centre of a round of social amenities, which do much to enliven tie monotony of' bush life, and which', owing to the scattered nature of the district, are unfortunately so few and far between. ? ' * ? *- * ? When Parliament was prorogued till some .time in May no one of course expected that it would re-assemble then. It is a kind of pleasant fiction this prorogation to a date which everybody knows will not be observed. Not without its uses though. It . keeps the country, and better still,' the Opposition, in doubt as to the real intentions of Ministers, and it leaves these latter free to consult their own convenience, to carry on public business 'unchecked, aud to postpone the ordeal of meeting.
