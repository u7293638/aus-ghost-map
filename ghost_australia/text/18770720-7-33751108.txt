THE RUSSO-TURKISH WAR. The R.M.S.

Many Roasiaa batteries have been planted on «be Bowaaniam ode of the Danube, and there v freqasnt mnnnnsifi?g, especially between Kalatat and Widdin. One of the most daring deeds ever wwawhul in the history of warfare was Berfonaad on the Lower Danube, Mat OnOt, on May 26. A small detachment of Basafaa soldiers, commanded by Idea*. Pnbsarhcff, accompanied by die commander of tae Bouanaiaa flotilla. Major Mnigeacn, wentoff in boats and planted a deadly torpedo seder taa monitor Daamatom, lying at aachor. It wms find from tbe thereby aa eleetrie battery aad wire. The monitor dm Mown into to* air, with nil the officers aad o«w. Tbeexpioaiaa was terrific, aad as nothing is «aid of thecnewbaaf saved, His supposed that all onboard perkhed with the Teasel. Lieutenants Dnbasekeft aad SbeeUkoff.tbeKostUn Officers who patlaraasd this exploit, haro been rewarded with tae Gross of Bt. GeoDKe. It is believed that 150,000 are in position near the Danube waiting for the signal to crass, aad that 100,000 vote are in Moldavia. Gnat sickness pcerails in the camp. A telegram from. Ibraila says:—Prince Gort schakoff look?Tery ill, the mere ghost of hiai self. He is tot arnch daappocated a* not being able to go to Ems to take the waters aa nsuaL This disappointment is *"Mw?g spon him irore severely than the wear and tear of war. It is thought he will not live tang. Tbe independence of Rownsnia was tiecTeci on Hay 31 in die Senate and Chantber of De puties by a nearly unanimous vote, aad de clared by Prince Charles on &c; 23r&, in a speech in which he t^nusscd his caafidenoe tbat the Great Fowen would agree. Teens is great agitation, in Serria, botOe Caw has told Prince Milan that ha must main taiaaatrktaeutzaltty,9r Austria will oenpy Serria. Hie Boomaniaas are being tnated very badly by the Banians, who have split the Renaaantaa army in two, aad even broken it ap more mimttelr. They Uagh at toe Bwinwas, aad do jost as tbey please iotitecovntry, amoggJeoa a vast scale (utterly in violation of the Uoavea tfam), treat tbe Boomanian aAoan with amdis guised ocmtempt, aad bebave aa roagbly as, foar weeks ago, they bebaved teaderiy. According to a telegram from St. Petersburg, the Bnadan Amhassadww in London, Vienna, and Berlin return to their posts without having received instructions to eater into any special negotiationi. Thef will, howwer, to able to explain tint the sole object of Oar Govern ment in entering upon the present war is, as heretofore, to protect the Christians m tbe East, aad to obtain far them, by means of political guarantees, those concessions which the European power* have twice deetared to be urgently required. Bossia has no desire to pro mote revelations in die vassal States, or tocaose fresh European complications, and her policy by no tneans excludes the eventual co-operation ofotlterijtatss. It is tboogtit to be not impro bable that the Emptnr, while at the Bnariaa headquarters, will take aa opportunity of ex pressing hit view* on this aabjeet. There has baen some disturbance at Oonstanti ple. The Softas, who have receally been par chasing aims, especially revolvers, sent a Depu tation to die CTiamber on May 23, aad after wards visited the Palace. They demanded tbe execution of the Commandant of Ardaban, aad a change in the Ministry. Tbe subsequent debate was so violent that the President adjourned the sitting, and on May 24 the capital was declared ia a state of siege, all persons ordered to sur render their arms, and domiciliary visits autho rised to search for than. Many of tbe Softas have been deported, and calm now prevails; but the fall of Ardaban created much coaster nation. It seems that tine Soltaa is a mere poppet in the bands of a triumvirate, composed of tbe notorious Mahmood Damad, Sedif Pasha, aad Said Pasha, who have constituted themselves a war council, though knowing nothing of military affairs, aad who only allow their master to know as mach as suits their ends, aad set their faces against his joining the army. The Sfaiek al-Islam has proclaimed the holy war and dubbed tbe Soltan victorious. Heavy reinfarce menta are still being seat to the DaQobe, where the Turks are greatly outnumber jd, and there is talk of making « levy of aoopoQ Cfewtws, recruits. It is stated that so much disaffection has pre vailed amnagst the Circsmiaas in the R'fiinn army since they learned that the dheik-al- Zslam bad proclaimed a holy war thai all tbe Cinawian troops are being seat back ta Sassia. Some of them have been disarmed; oae tegi ment is to be sent to the garrisons in Siberia. The Scberiff of Mecca k repartsd to have placed tbe Sacred Treasury, valnad at two mil lions sterling, at tbe disposal of tfa Sultan. The Khedive of Egypt has some ZfiOd troops to send to Turkey, but has feared to do so, as there is a Bussian man-of-war off the Italiaa coast. Some Tnridah ironclads have been sent to convoy tbetn. In Wednesday sitting of the Turkish Chamber the Miiaster of Finance stated Oat , tfie Government required a gnat of five mfl- Imhb, It was resolved to appoint a Oomarittee to examine tfais A~ir">* The quutiiiai of aa | uttetnalloanandof voluntary donations was at the same time disenssed.
