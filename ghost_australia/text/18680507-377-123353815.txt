PUNCH EXTRACTS. ?uJon Beow --On, A SuOer Cur TO oGLonr. To the land.of thle gorilla . Went the dauntless Major Brown; Took hlie neither scrip nor eiller Wheu he left his native town. Nothing took he when he started, Saviug learve of Mrs. B.; N'othing said he when they parted, Only " You 'll remember me!" Crossed he then tile stormy ocoan In the A 1. packet " Panle ;" Gave he to the sea a notion Of the things lhe'd lad for lunch. Called himself a wrotched sinner When the ovessel heaved the most ; Fancied giving up his dinner Worae othan giving up his ghost. "Land at last," and all the wonders That are Afrie's soon he knew : Afrie'a inative black who plunders, Kills, and cooks, and eats you too! All the man-and-beastly dangers, Bird and feih, a fearful host Such o? welcome little strangers Like the Major to its coat. When at first the king of mnonkeys Met him with an ugly grin, SBeing somewhat in a funk, hisi Bullet barely raised the akin ; But instead it 'raised thle dander Of that most malignant ape, lWho, swith one adroit left-hander, Knocked the Major out of shape. After this lie got on better; Killed gorillea by the score: And an extract from a letter Dated April, sixty-four, Bays, " hIerewith, my dearest cousin, My return of game I send : Full-grown onkeyes-- fifteen dozen; Smanlller animale--no end." Years elapsed, and then to London Homeward travelled Major Brown, And his great deeds-done and undone Soon awere common talk in town.. All thie Leo Hunter party Took the Major by the hand; Road his journal, bought hIis Carte-de. l'iete, and a banquet planned. So, my friends and fellow-flunkeys, See how easily fame is won; Pay your passage, pot your monkeys, Presto, fly! the deed is done! Bag the beasts, as once Orion D)id in Chios--soulhrard roam: Go abroad, and be a "lion" You're an ass Ito stop at home!
