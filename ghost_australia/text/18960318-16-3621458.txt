THE CUNNINGHAM ELECTION. TO THE EDITOR. Sir,-I would crave space to make a few remarks re the Cunningham election. We have at the present moment four candidates in the field-one, Air. A. Gordon, being the contestant approved of by the Premier, the remaining three being Messrs. Finlay, AI'Gahan, and Ransome, Finlay and Ransome posing as supporters of the Government. Messrs. Gordon and M'Gahau are legitimate farmers. E. Finlay, who hails from Pilton, styles himself a farmer also ; but, take my word for it, fellow electors, and I am writing so that I may be heard by you through the " Courier" (there being no time for me to do so through the local papers before polling day), he is only so styled for the occasion. Call Mr. Finlay a son of the soil after the election is over, and see how he would receive the title. We do not want Mr. Finlay, in this part of the electorate at any rate, and we are determined to do our best by united efforts to show him so at the ballot box on Saturday next. Air. Gordon is well and favourably known right through the district. He is a large employer of labour, and has been connected at various times with municipal and other public bodies. He was requested to come forward and represent us by a large number of shrewd, intelligent voters from various centres, and in addition, as I have before remarked, he stands before us as the accredited Ministerial candidate. Mr. Finlay knows full well that he has not the ghost of a chance of being returned. His handful of supporters are well aware of this also. Yet to gratify this man's over- weening vanity, they are taking him to the poll, to the under the circumstances, probable gross injury of Mr. Gordon. I am, sir, &c;, CUNNÃ®NGI-IAAI. Allora, Kith March.
