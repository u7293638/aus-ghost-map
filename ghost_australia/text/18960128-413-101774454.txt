Welsh Superstition. —— SUPERSTITION still retains its hold over the miners of South Wales, writes our London correspondent on 20th December. For some days work was suspended at a large mine, and 300 men were kept in voluntary idleness. It appears that strange and un- usual sounds were heard by some of the miners. Two of them were sitting side by side at a turn in the underground passages, beyond which were miles of old workings. Suddenly from this unknown region came a succession of piercing wails, horrible to hear. According to the Western Mail, which investi- gated the occurrence the pitmen took to their heels, and as they ran spread the alarm. The report spread throughout the mine that it was unhallowed, that some ominous influ- ence was busy in the workings, and the men declined to descend into it. Their fears were intensified by another omen. In the early hours of Sunday morning a dove was found at the pit's mouth, and this, although it was neither white nor black, was regarded is a ghostly messenger. The mystery be- came deeper and deeper, and the more it was discussed the more extraordinary it ap- peared. A gamekeeper heard strange voices singing dirges near a neighboring Metho- dist chapel, which was built near the site of an old monastery, and at the hour, 4a.m., that the miners heard the wails in the under- ground workings. At the same weird hour a door in one of the galleries of the mine was seen to open and shut itself. The managers of the mine showed more coolness than the men. They asked the Government, inspector to make a full investigation of the workings, and he, in company with the men's agent and a small party, made a thorough examination and came up with a most satisfactory and reassuring report. Whereupon the men threw aside their fears and went below again with any attempt to exorcise the ghosts or goblins by whom they had been so terribly frightened.
