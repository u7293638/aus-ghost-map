Punishment in Victorian State Schools COnronAL punishment has been abolished in the State Schools of Victbria, but according to a letter in a recent number of the Ballarat Couorier a far more severe and dangerous practice for punishing the younger scholars seems to have been resorted to, viz., shutting them up in dark rooms and cupboards, and frightening them with the old nursery threats of " togies," " ghosts," &c.;" The writer of the letter alluded to, had a son attending a state school, and not finding hipm at home at half-past 9 o'clock, one night made inquiries concerning him, and ascertained that he was in the " gaol" as ir was called in the school. Accompanied by his wife and daughter, he went to the school, and visited the" gaol" wherehe found his son crouched up in perfect darlness, shivering and stupid with fear; and the boy had been in that place from about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
