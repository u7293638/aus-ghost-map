York paper says:-"I t the Roman Catholic ceme. tery in Birmingh n, early on the morning of the tS:h ult., fo r middle.aged women and two men-the la ter armed with spides and lncnsr--o-terel the side gate and halted in front of a iii i e grave. The men set to work, whil'thv en wept, and opened the grae a hased offin up. The lid was taken off, and ,.. reia~ins of a beausiful young. girl wet revealed .',She was the daughter of one of the wome , and the mother shrieked loudly when she saw the corpse. The men stood aside, and the four women bent orer the coffin, and deft fingers went rapidly. through the dea girl's hair and shroud, and all the pins that c old be found on the remains were removed. Then a needle and thread were procured, d the shroud and hair sewn back into their laces. The lid 'was then screwed back o the coffin, and the remains were again lower d into the grave, which was at once fill;d u . It was learned that the uomes were s very superstitious narure, and that tl?'bm ieved ttat if a corpse was buried with the hioud pinned up instead of sewed, the soul w old be confined to the grave for eternity, and the persons guilty of the t mistake would rh haunted until death by the ghost of the victi . A mistake was made in I this case, and one of the wom:n claimed that she had seen the host for two or three nights successively,:and he could standit'no longer; I so she got the ther ivomen together, and Sbetween. them th y hired the men to disinter the body.-. Th ghost has not been'seen I since." "
