She had-aiiabit of frowiu^ftailittle at times—a fcownjffiat brought her fine dark brows together . She frowned in this way now while sbe^looked at the young mim contemplatively out of her yellow-brown eyes. " I cannot picture to myself why a man like you should wish to marry n woman like me. I am not ductile, not malleable. I have not the qualities that make a good wife—for sudi as you." Claverhouse shrugged his shoulders. ••Hove you.* "Oh, yes. H e old story." "Meanwhile you do not answer me." " Well, I answer you now. And in a way which, to-a degree,- surprises myself. You want me to many yiou? 1 will do as you wish.". .';'•-• Never, surely, was there a stranger courting. Claverhouse "would have wished to draw her to him, hut something in her mien forbade approach. Whether she loved him would Care lieen a question lie could have asked himself very pertinently under die conditions existent. But he did not put the quay to himself. She consented to marry him. And for the rest, lie loved her. This fact alone filled tile horizon for liim, suffused it with a glamor in which all other issues showed shadowily through a veil. When news of Claverhouse's anticipated marriage reached bis friends it occasioned a wondering murmur. He had been deemed an eccentric where women were concerned: almost a misogynist. In many other ways he was unlike other men. As a boy lie bad been a dreamer; as a youth at college he had been called " Miss Claverhouse" until he one day quietly knocked down a big fellow in whose mouth the appellation had most frequently been. He had a skin fair as a girl's, and his frame was eliglit, tall and delicate. He had travelled 'most of bis time. He had never taken any active part in life whatever. He spoke little, and his mode, of address had something of the drawling gentleness of a very I feminine woman. People did not ire-1 qu'ently affect tounderstand ilim. Gener-j ally, the "verdict concerning him- would 1 have been that he was exceedinglyeasy-1 going and harmless. -. ^ ,4 ; | •--AndwhydionldMissSt.^uTCiu-<^:b"jf< marry "this fashion of.-mah?

The dusky faces pressed close together on the outermost fringe of the laVm were accented by wide open eyes and gaping mouths. For miles up and down the river it had become known that a-large wedding was to take place at OrangeGroye-Springs; that night.

The bride was gone and the groom had not come.' Miss St. Sauveur had gone to'ber room early in the evening with orders that she was not to be disturbed. And Josephine St. Sauveur was not a girl whom, even on such an occasion, people disobeyed. When the hour for the wedding arrived, however, and with it the few guests bidden, her door was knocked at and, no response forthcoming, finally broken open. The room was empty, and on the bed lay the white dress, the white veil. In the dismayed confusion that ensued no one at first observed that Claverhouse, too, should have come by this. But as the wild search for the bride continued without result it burst upon those assembled below that they were congregated together to witness an occurrence strange indeed—a marriage at which neither groom nor bride Sud<leidya quivering cry rang over the lawn. A small negro bov stood, with goggling eyes, the centre or a circle that" pressed ever more tightly around him, and strange words were those he poured out; stammeringly. One or two of the white people cried at first that he had seen a ghost. But the Iray, his teeth chattering, insisted tbkth'e hid not been mistaken, and, following his 6tumWingsteps, they came to a thicket down the river where, in the checkered moonlight, there gleamed something ghosJly-T^he pallor of a motionless Jac^,jturned upward,- and near it a 6hadowy mn, the dead;body of Josephine St. Sairveur."
