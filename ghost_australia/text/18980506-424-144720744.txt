Archie smiled as I fluisbed my narrative and thanked me profusely lot what I bad-done, ^ ' As you have been so good as to come to see what Is tbe matter with me, 111 tell you the whole story,' he said, settling back #n an easy attitude, though his look still betokened a troubled mind. ? Tbe story he told me was this. Three weeks before, to that very afternoon, be bad made op at the office, as was bis custom, his flrro*s amount of cash and paper for payment into tbe firm's account at tbe bank. The sum wat £670, among which were two notes of £100 esch. Tbo cuftom was for Archie, as cashier, to count the cash end check off all paper, to place, tbe whole in the cash bag which be then locked end for tbe assistant cashier to proceed witb tbe bag aod key to tbe bank and pay tbe amount in. On that particular afternoon, when tbe cash was taken from the bag at tbe b*ftk,-tta two hundred -pound notes were misatng. Ueorfe Chiswetl* tbe assistant caatfer, immediately notified the lois to the bank and bastenod bsdr to tbe ofilee to inform Archie of it. ? Archie was dnxnbfounded. Alsaost tbe last thing he bad done before Chiswell left for tbe bask was to cbeek eff the notes witb some others and some bills. Though be bad implicit confidence in Chiswell, tbe fsot remained tbat he bed takra tbe bag to tbe bank and bad bad poem aion of Ibe lay to it. To add to their coo* fusion a dip of psper wbirh had borne tbe num ber of tbe misung notes bad also disappeared so tbat there were no means of slopping tbem, Arcbie vu confident that be bad been the vic tim of a well laid plot ; tbe qucetion wss, who was tbe thief. T* He was satisfied that Chiswell bad not consciously been a paxty to it, but this conviction only dcepeoed ibe myatery surround ingtbe matter. 1 The principals of tbe firm bad been immedi ately apprised of the diaappearauoo of the notes end they bad caused the officials of Scot land Yard to be informed without loss of time. Tbe case had been pat into the hands of two of the most experienced detectives, bat up to that time so due to tbe notes had heen obtained. Prom the facts that tbey bad disappeared from his own department, and that until thfe matter were eltared np, suspicion would naturally at tach to Chiswell, Archie bad mado himief ill by warryiog over tbe robbery. He had now been ' at home for four days, and it was easy to see I tbn low state into whicb be bad worked himself. *4 What is your theory of the affair P' I asked when he had finished bis story, 41 Tbat some ODe in the office took the notes. I fee! confident of it, though I have not a res tige of proof,' he answeied, his eye^ashing excitedly. ' Do you tfwpcct anyone I asked agtio. Well, you know, it is a very dclicatc and strjouB matter,' he answered, deliberately, ' 44 It is,' 1 pursue d, r all the more d«siiablo tbat any reasonable suspicion should bo followed up. Have you no &ut-picion; of any one P' 14 I have a vague and lurking association of a certain parly witb the affair,' said Archie, rising and pacing the room uneasily. 41 1 can't dismiss him from my mind. Night and day bis face obtrudes itself, and yet 1 haven't the ghost of a shred of evidenee to connect bim w)th it.' ** Who is he ?' I queried, my interest now being au&kufied.; ** A clerk in a good position. You would take I him to bo a principal by his manner. He's an awful lot of * side ' about bim ; drestes immacu lately and talks glibly about city affairs ; just the kind of mnn you'd rxpect to find dabbling , iu slocks.' f' | 44 Oan ho have taken tbe paper ?' ' | 41 That's just the point. Assuming that be ? meant to take it, he might havo done. He is one of tbe clerks whose business it is to coufcr with me about charges and particulars in btate l ments of account. Tbis briDga him pretty frc I quently into tbe cash-oflics. He hud been iu it ' afternoon, but IVe oot L-e*n able to connect any visit of bis with the lime of the disappear ance of tbe notes, nor bas Chiswell. In fact, I would dismiss bim from memoi^ only I can't.' Archic could tell me nothing more about the matter. It had made him ill. beaming of his illncj!*, Miss Manville, his fiancee, had como from Forest Uote to see Lim.

Dear Charlie,— Tbe name of tbe party I alluded to ia Lawrence Btend. For gooi ne»' cake, mind what you do with the in formation.— Tonrs sincerely, A. v I did mind. Within balf-an-hour the detec tives who had the case in band were apprised of the facts that whereas, on September 24th, two one-hundred-pauud notes were stolen from the office of Mfstrs. On tyre, Crewdeon, and j Co., on September Z6lb, a cheque for two liun. | dred pounds was drawn upon a certain bank by wae Lawrence Brand, a clerk in the employ- j mrntof Messrs.

Yet even then there waa no direct evidence that Brand had stolen the notes. I had no doubt of it, and tbe detectives had none, and when ibe circumstance! which had como to oar fcuowlcdgc were laid before Messrs. Cau tyre and Crewdson, they too, were satisfied tbat Brand was the culprit. Tbe two principals accordingly vummonod Mr, Brand to tbeir private nfEee.
