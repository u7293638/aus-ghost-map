" As All laid the new patient down, Harry gasped for breatii "and stretched out his arais. A sudden impulse of grace came over him like a wave. " Don't tell Olwen," he cried aloud in a husky voice.

One of them came and sat with .-Harry while Mohammad Ali took his hat in haste and went out in search of the nearest medical man to attend him. By the "time Ali returned Harry Chichele" was seriously ill. It. was a liad case; it had run'too far; the virus had taken hold of its victim with terrible- effect. His nervous ' energy and the excitement of the day had •enabled him to hold up against the "enemy much too long. He had used liis..,powers in mental exhaustion. When the. -collapae came it was utter and horrible. He sank at once into a kind of a drowsy lethargy* •The two patients were now on their hands .together-. Seeta sat and watched with "Olwen ' all the night through. From time .to time, Mohammad Ali, stealing in like a ghost, brought her the latest news of Harry. He whispered it low in her ears each time, for fear Ipf'Olwen. But Olwen was sleeping .sweetly by brief snatches now, and jrecoveiing with .the . extraordinary rapidity of recovery that always accompanies tropical diseases. In those, critical engagements you join in a short sharp struggle with the enemy, and whichever wins . wins quickly.
