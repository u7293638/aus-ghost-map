A TERRIBLE PICTURE. Speaking of the condition of the lewer classes in England, a writer in the " Con temporary Review" for July says: — "The admirably logical social life that religiously shuts all the museums and picture galleries on the Lord's day, ana opens all the gin shops ; that is never tired of iterating that the proper spnere of woman is home, and brings np its 20,000 female orphans in large pauper barracks, from which the last loach of home life has disappeared ; that goes , to meetings ana loudly preaches thrift to tho people, and then gruffly whispers in their ear by guardians of the poor. Only be drunk and spendthrift enough, and we will house pou and provide for old age that goes to , church and preaches that the body is the temple of the.Holy Ghost, and leaves the people to litter down like pigs at night — men and women, girls and boys together in tenements where no rich man would think of stabling his horses ; that gnes to school and 1 e iches its children the three R's, and leaves them in dens of infamv to ltatn a fourth R, by every sight and sonnd of the day and night ruin »f body and soul ; that virtuously declaims against the harlot, yet leaves is little girls to be brought up in brothels ; that believes a fatal disorder in undermining the national health, and shut the doors of its hospitals against it. and denies it the public means of cure; that legally protects the heiress up to 21, and refuses to protect the poor mau's daughter even at 16 from the trade of vice ; that holds that mnu is the responsible head of the woman — leaves abundant causes to com- plaiu of the methads of our moral life."
