A Ghost Story. A correspondent of .' Notes and Queries' sends tho following from the Penny Magazine, April 14, 1835, as what ho con siders the best ghost story in tho. world: — Dr. Fowler, Bishop of Gloucester, in an early part of the eighteenth century, was a believer in apparitions. The following conversation of the bishop with Judtre Powell is recorded: — ' Since I saw you,' said the lawyer, ' I havo had ocular demonstration of the existence of nocturnal appai'itions.' ' I am glad you arc become a convert to tho truth ; but do you say actual ocular demonstration ? Let 'me know the particulars of the story ?' ' My lord I will. It was — lot mo soe — last Thurs day night, between the hour of eleven and twelve, but noaror the latter than the f ormor, as I lay sleeping in my bed, I was suddenly awakened by an uncommon noise, and heard something coming upstairs and stalking dir ectly towards my room ; tho door flying open I drew back my curtain, and saw a faint glim mering light enter my chamber,' ' Of a blue i colour, no doubt ?' ' The light was of a palo blue, my lord, and followed by a tall meagre personage, his locks hoary with .age, aud clothed in a long loose gown ; a leathern girdlo was about his loins, his beard thick and grizzly, a largo fur cap on his head, and a long staff in his hand. Struck with astonishment, 1 1 romained for somotimo motionless and silont ; tho figure advanced, staring me full in the i face. I then' said, 'Whence nnd what art thou ?' The following was tho answer .1 roceivod : ? I am the watchman of tho night, an't please your honour, and mndebold to come ' upstairs to inform 'the family of their street door being open, and that if it was not soon shut they would probably bo robbed before morning.''
