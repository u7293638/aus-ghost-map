The Bead Knacker. "The Orphan" sends me some lines on a dead knacker, which died the other day of starvation in Victoria Park, and whose corppe lay three days in close proximity to the General Hospital before it was "planted." There is but little merit in the at tempted verse, but I like to encourage " orphans," and I print the effusion to spur on my contributor to higher and more poetical endeavour: He was a beautiful Arab steed. In Victoria park, he used to feed j His color was a dirty roan, He was low in flesh and high in bone. An animal with some very good points, You could hang your hat on all his joints ; And, by the way he carried his head, You could see that he had been well bred. Too proud to associate with a mate, He walked about with a stately gait. His eye would flash, and he would prick an ear, Whenever he saw a horse draw near; He would stare at it in great disdain As if he owned the whole domain. No one ever saw him run, They might say bo, *' just in fun " He never went faster than a walk, And at a corn-feed he'd not baulk. At last, he got well up in years ; His master sold him, with many tears, And swore he was worth his weight in gold, Though forty years since he was foaled. To work him the buyer tried his best, But the poor old devil wanted a rest; So he turned him in the park to feed - Gross cruelty to this anciont steed! There was nothing there for him to grub, Except the leaves of the box-tree scrub 5 And, at last, he got so very skinny He'd lean against the fence to whinny; And, as he there for grass would grope, He looked just like a telescope. He thinner grew from day to day, Until, one day, he tried to neigh; But he fell down against a post His tail wagged, then gave up the ghost. Three days he lay there dead, I think, Like Lazarus, began to stink, And now he's buried deep, secure, And by-and-bye he'll be manure. ?
