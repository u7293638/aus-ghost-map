LITERATURE The Storyteller. Her Majesty's Tower.* VOL. II. CHAPTER XIX. IN THE TOWER. BY WILLIAM HEPWORTH DIXON. IN less than a week from the assault of Holbeach house, the laymen of the plot were either dead or in the Tower. Catesby, Percy, Jack and Kit Wright were buried near the spot where they had fallen ; but, by Northampton's' orders, they were dug up from the earth and hong. Fawkes, Rokewood, Kay, Tom Winter,' Stephen Littleton, Digby, Tresham, Bates, add Bobert Winter were dispersed in the several prisons, under charge of Waad, who brought itum on* by on* before Korthampton and the Losds Commissioners sitting in th* Powder Plot i Boom. . . ■ , ■. ■ . :: ....

The Council oould hang th* prisoners without . reproach, and great would be vie gains accruing fwn their death. The Puritan towns would be delighted, and the Puritan burgesses more pliant to the Crown. The King oould get his name Into th* calendar and the service-books. But Cecil and Northampton had other purposes in mind. They wished not only to discredit and destroy the Jesuit agency in England, but to cripple still more the partisans of war, by raining ' thepowerful Earl who wm now their chief. Week after week passed by, and the prisoners were not tried for their offence. In fact tony were undergoing a course of daily trial by North* ampton in the Tower. Here they underwent a thousand interrogatories from Coke, a thousand . hostilities from Waad, and a thousand treacheries from.Forsett This ForsettwM one of North* , amptoo's spies; a useful and despicable wretch, . ; "hpm his master employed in overbearing and seporttng the private conversations of prisoners trith each other. Cecil's object in allowing these proceedings was. not to obtain a knowledge of Jesuit complicity in the plot, but evidenoe whioh oould b* adduced in a court of law. , Th* prisoners had a conscience in the matter of a curious kind; for long after they had taken. to aaonaing each other in their nnnf wsssinns, they eomtinned to screen their priests. Both Fawkes , and Winter affirmed, that when they took that -oath on the Primer in Butcher-row, Father r Gerard, who gave them them the sacrament, wm ignorant of the purpose of their oath. The aames of Garnet, Greenway, Oldcorae, never passed their lips. But the object of their lying words and lying silence wm to screen their . P*non«f not to dear their fame. Of Father • Owen they spoke quite freely; for Owen wm beyond the reach of Engueh law. Though Cadi wm an artist in deoeit, he wm amaaed by the complexity of lying which he had now to study. Sir Everard Digby seemed on the whole, apart from his share in the plot, a man of honorable mind; yet Digby, while a nriamer in th* Tower, oonaidered himself free to say and to unsay, from hour to hour. He told has questioner* that he was not sworn ; that be went to Dunchuroh for the hunt and nothiqg ?Be riflfct of n|*bU*ii)« "Her ataM^a Item" note; that he wai.only with the band jtwp dajs in all; that lie' qaitted them of Ks own free win. Next day; on Fawfcai befog set' before him, face to face, the poor young, fellow told some part of the truth, and justified h|a former course of lies. He wrote to bis wife a flood of letter* and a stock of doggrel rhymes. "If I' bad thought there had been'the leait sin in it" (the scheme of wholesale murder), " I would toot . have been in, it lor all the world." Digby had been taught that assassination, in a pertain cause, waa not a tin ; that a falae statement, in •ia certain cause, was not a lie. , Fawkes waa pressed more closely for con fessions against the Catholic peers; and mainly on his avowals the Earl of Northumberland, Lord Montagu, Lord Stourton, and Lord Hor daunt, were brought into the tower. ' Tresham waa the greatest mystery of aIL For many days after Catesby's flight, Cousin Franjk remained in London, going about the streets as usual, and even offering to assist the Council in , seeking out the fugitives. Fawkes mentioned' him, as one of the aworn confederates; yet for one. whole week he was left at large,;. and it is evident from his ways of life that pc felt no fear of being arrested. At length he was oommttted, to the Tower; and Sir Thomas Lale, ihe King's prirAtm secretary, considering him as a lost matt, . applied for a grant of Pipewell Manor, p&eof.hja; •stages, which, J*mea assured him he should hav|e when it was forfeited to the crown ! He made a i cautious statement,, saying lie had seen Cateaby and' Winter, indhad given them money; but was not a member, of tb* plot, and bid only paid the money in, order to tempt,hjajoousjn to cross the seas, fie seemed to know that the Coupcil we're; Bent on skying Lord Monteagle, and he labeled i that* Monteagie' could not be saved unless he bktoself were spared.

The verjy same day he wrote a curious note to Ana*. Lady Markham, of Beakwood Park. This starless creator* had been suffered to reside at Beakwood after her husband's libera tion from the Tower, on condition oi his going to live abroad. But life was misery to her while Sir Griffin ate the bread of exile, and by fore* of brooding on her grief, which she attributed, not unfairly, to the Jesuits, she fell into such ob liauity of moral view, as to think heraalf jus tified in doing them every sort of wrong. She had written a note to Cecil, hinting that her place among the Catholics, as one who had suffered in their cause, wm such a» enabled her to hear and see many things which it behoved the King to learn. Encouraged to speak out, she answered that certain persons then in custody could tell where the missing Jesuits could be found.

Garnet and Gerard, she could tell him, had been biding in the house of Mrs. Vaux at Harrowden, and a stricter watch for two dayß longer would have forced them to oome out. Garnet was gone, but Gerard was in the shires ; and she offered, to inveigle him to Beskwood Park, and then deliver him up a prisoner to the King. «_CeciL WM free in Promises. In letters dated from Whitehall, he told her he was loath to prosecute the Jesuits, but on finding that they had been principals, in the plot, he had no choice. Accepting gladly her proposal to ensnare Father Gerard, he sent her down a blank form of warrant, so that her people couH arrest him the moment he set'foot within her gates* Lady Markham failed in her treacherous scheme, through the seal of one Rutland Moly neuz, a Nottingham squire, who, suspecting her purpose, met Father Gerard on the skirts of Sherwood Forest, and warned him of the peril into which he was about to run.

The country wm up in arms, and erery house suspected of hiring a Catholic mistreM wm certain to be searched. Where oould he and his females hide until the uproar passed? While he wm scheming, Oldoorne arrived from Hendlip Hall with an invitation for himself and trajnf; when he noted, together with Ami Vatnr and his senwit little John, to Mrs. Abington's friendly house. ,  Hendlip .Hall, a Tudor houat.of vast extent, which stood on hud) around, and swept the oountry for many miles, had been recently built by1 ThomM Abmgton, on plans supplied by Little John, m a bidinf.plaoe for priests. Almost erery room in the pile had »reosss, a passage, a trap-door, and a secret stair. The walls were hollow, the ceilings false. The chimneys had double flues; a passage for the fire, and a second lor the priest One hollow in the wall wm covered with meet cunning art; a narrow crevice, next to the fireplace, into which a reed wm laid from Mrs. Abington's bed room ; so that soup and wine could be passed by her into the recess, without the fact being noticed from, any other room. Except the builders and the, Jesuits, no one, had ft Key to the whole man of secrets ; but the local gentry were aware that the Hall had been contrived for the concealment of priests; and when the proclamation against the Jesuits came out Sir Henry Bromley, of Holt CMtle, an active justice of the peace, wm not surprised to receive an order from the Council to search the house. His oiders were minute. He wm to surround the Hall with his man ; to set a guard at every door; to suffer no one to oome in,, no one to go out, until the priests were found. The servants were to be watched by day and night, to see that they carried no food Into strange places. The dining-room wm to be carefully examined, and the wainscot pulled down to see if any passage lay beyond. The cellar floors were to be broached. Every room in the house was to be measured, so M to see whether the lower apart ments corresponded with the upper in length and breadth. Even the chimney-stacks were to be pierced and probed. The searchers came upon Mrs. Abmgton with so much secresy and suddenness, that the priests and their servants had to run like rats into their holes. Garnet and Oldoorne crept into the crevice near the fireplace, from which the reed for passing soups and wine conducted into Mrs. Abington's rooms. Chambers and Little John, their servants, bid themselves in a kind of cupboard. No preparation for. their stay in these hiding-plaoss had been made. The priests' recess wm nearly filled with books and lumber, and the only food which- H contained WMeonWpoteefaanaaMe. Tbe serves* ha* no food at all, Mid their den mi staffed with what Bromley calls "Popish trash." When the justice showed his warrentfrom the Council, Mrs. Abington assured him that bo one was in hiding at Efaidlip.. Abingtbn, her I husband, was then from home; box, oh his coming to the Hall, he confirmed the statement of his wife; adding that he knew nothing of Father Garnet personally, and had not seen Father Gerard for several years. Bromley was surprised; but his orders being strict he pro oeeded to search the house, to measure the rooms, and to count the beds. With a list of the family in his hand, he passed through every chamber, noticing which was occupied and which was not He found more beds in the rooms than guests ; and on carefully testing the con dition of these beds, he found that some of those which wen said to be unused wen warn). , Mrs. Abington kept her room, in anger at the search being made. Bromley would have had her quit the Hall while his troops were 7 there: but she refused to go, and he dared not turn a lady of her quality—the sister of so great» m»n as Lord Monteagle—out-of-doors. He could not guess her reason for so obstinately shutting' her. self up in a single room—eating then, dnaking But after some days of careful watch had been kept hi every room—except the one* in which Mrs. Abington lay-* panel fn the warn soot opened, and two spectres stepped into-'the hall.

Mrs. Abington pretended nstto know them; but the facts wen soon discorewa ; and the search was then continued for their1 masters with a warmer hope. > The cnviee in which Garnet and Oldoorne lay was low and strait; and being filled with books and furnitun, the Fathers oould neither stand on their feet nor lie do wa at length. Their flesh began to sweU and their bones to ache; they could hear the searchers tapping at the walls; and from their talk and bogW as they called to each other, they learned Chambers and Little John we caught "We Wen very merry -and content within," said Garnet afterwards, when describing the scene to Ann Vaux ; " and hekrd the searchers every day most curious over' to, which made me think the place would be fouflcL" But as day afte* day sM past, without Result, the magistrate, after settfnf a watth"inietery room and corridor, rode hornS to HoJt;<fcaW on his own afbirs, for the sake bt a Btfle'rert'Find while he was absent from Hendtip, ttMbr^'preftise and positive news bf Oldeorne being bid toI'firs.

The soldier who slid the panel, seeing two men darkly in the hole, ran back in fear, expecting them to fire. A crowd was soon at the door, to whom Garnet tpoke, bidding them beqaiet, and saying they would yield themselves in peaoe. Bromley reooftdsed Garnet from the proclamation. But the Father would not give his name M You are a learned man V said Bromley. "Let me be takenbalon my Lord of Salisbury," answered Garnet; "he will know me." Cecil's cunning courtesies had so far told upon the Prefect, that he thoughtUm* self an object of the Secretary's grace. Abington, arrested with the lie on his lips. was driven, with the four Jesuits whom he had feloniously concealed, to Worcester in Bromley's coach, "I hoped to have lodged you im a otiaen's boose," said Bromley to the Father; "but I cannot, and you must lie in the gaoL" Garnet started at the word ; "A God's name, I hop© you will provide we have not irons, for/we an lame already, and ahall not be able to ride after it to London." Bromley said he wouM wee to it. He put Garnet into a private room, and left him for a time. On his ntum, he placed the prisoners in his coach onoe more, and drove them to Holt Castle, where they remained, as guests in his house, well lodged, and aftting at table with Lady Bromley and her people, until Candlemas, to recruit their strength. A banquet was then given, and in the midst of .dsnoevfiir Henry called for wine, and standing up, bare headed, drank to the King. The Prefect rose to his feet, and pledged the health, as ha says,."in a reasonable glass." . „ Ann Vaux and Mrs. Abington wan left at Hendhp HalL At length, the cavalcade set out from Holt Castle. MI parted from the gentlewomen, who wen very kind to me," wrote the Jesuit, "as also all the house." The journey was made by easy stages, and a treacherous kindness met them at every turn. From Bromley, Garnet heard that it was by Cecil's express command that he was used so welL He rode the best horse in the company. He travelled at the King's expense. He halted when he pleased, and ate and drank of the best On the road he met, as it seemed by chance, Dean Abbott and Dean Barlow, two of the court divines. They had a long talk together at an inn, and Garnet was struck by the air of respect which the two Deans put on. Yet these divines wen the bitterest enemies of his Order and his Church. When Bromley arrived in Londop with his charge,, he lodged the Prefect in the Gatehouse, near White* hall; Abington in the Fleet; Little John and Chambers b the Tower. ... , , n ooCTnmn,] j ' i •_
