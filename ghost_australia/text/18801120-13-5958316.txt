LONDON TOWN TALK. j (FROM OUR. OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, OCT. 8. London-that is, Pall Mall and its environs' -still continues silent, deserted I was going to say a Sahara , but to persons who understand life it is not so dusty The clubs are full of servants and one gets attended upon as though one were a prince of the Wood A dozen attendants, with obedient start, obey one a word It is not necessary to be a tyrant like Smith, or to offer bribes like Robinson to be helped before other people It is contrary to the rules to give gratuities but Robinson does it He once told me in confidence (though he now denies it that he gives half a sovereign all round in order to get the pay of old Jones when they are ordering things Jones has ten thousand a year but would as soon think of having his last three teeth taken out as of spending ten shillings "Of course it is wrong, says Robinson, " to see the servants, but I like to see Jones who To give you an idea of the solitariness of town, I will tell you what can be done in it, what tons done in fact under these very eyes in Berkeley square yesterday I was in that fashionable Spot, looking up with regret at the shuttered windows and wondering when I should next take dinner within Those east hospitable doors, when an omnibus rattled along Now an omnibus in Berkeley square is of itself a portent but this had been evidently hired for private purposes It had no conductor and within were 12 beautiful girls consigned probably to some seminary When I say 12 beautiful girls, I only exhibit my usual charity There were 12 girls and the two next the door being beautiful, I took it for granted the rest were BO Is it likely the other 10 would have allowed those two to sit next the door if it were otherwise ' I also concluded since the schoolmistress was not in the exposed position, that she was not of the party After wards I was sure of it from what happened Two young men in the undress uniform of the Life Guards were going the same way and to these, as the omnibus passed, the driver beckoned with his arm, as drivers do I am certain they did not know him, nor he them, but they accepted the invitation with alacrity To see them jump on the step and linger there-what a moment it must have been for the young ladies, and especially for those next the step and then slowly climb the roof, with longing backward looks, to our theirhospitablefnendon the box wasacharm ing spectacle Could Miss Pinkerton, awaiting her lambs at Minerva house Academy, have only known they were under escort of the Life Guards Blue ' I suppose the escort was dropped at the corner of her street, and lingered on the step again I wonder whether the young ladies mentioned the matter ' Of course the solitude of London begets A acuity in London town talk there a nothing that is no one for town talk is mainly personal-to talk about The news papers are at their wits end for copy I notice that no less than six earthquakes have taken place in Switzerland-I mean so we have been told since Parliament rose Switzerland is the great London newspaper preserve where all the catastrophes are kept ready for the silly season. It was in Switzer- land that Dumas Pere who was among other things the greatest of paragraph writers, placed the scene of his wooden leg story I will not insult my readers (for I am never at a loss for copy by relating it They must certainly remember the wooden leg which as a legacy was thought nothing of till it was accidentally broken and found full of Napoleons Tint leg the original inventor of it used to say, came every autumn from the east for 20 years travelled over France, Germany and Belgium, and flourished in every town in Great Britain, till Parliament met in February I would recommend that leg (which has been buried for some years the serious consideration of the editor of the Pall Mall Ga site as a substitute for such contributions as his correspondents ' Recipe for Sleeplessness This purports to be a personal experience I should think, of the ghost of Lord Macaulay, for it starts with the amazing statement that "every educated man has Milton at his fingers ends That is surely the very largest (theoretical) gooseberry of the present season Circumstances alter terms (as well as cases), or if Parliament were sitting one would call it a gigantic lie I don't believe 50 men in England know 50 lines of Milton by heart However the gentleman who has found a way of putting himself to sleep is so good as to offer his assistance even to the uneducated The first step, he says, " is to learn Paradise Lost or some other poem, by heart I like that "some other point I should prefer to learn Goldsmith a ' Elegy on a Mad Dog as being on the whole shorter The next stop IS to convert the poem into a kind of game of patience, which forms an admirable sedative Hogoea on to suggest that the sleepless one should proceed with "Paradise Lost till he comes to some lines near the end of the first book (when I should think it would be morning where the word Adonis appears And here he is to begin finding out " spontaneous and undesigned acrostics upon that name in the lines that follow An American burglar once described a part of his stock in trade as ' crowbars and other sedatives, and as compared with the soda five thus recommended, I really think I should prefer the crowbar However, unless the correspondent of the Pall Mall is bent on making fools of every body (and not of himself only ) his last suggestion is noteworthy me say a in the first two stanzas of one of the most famous poems by a living author may be found is initials of words and in their proper order, the letters which go to make up the name of 1 Urquhart This gives more scope for the intelligence than the usual intellectual frivolities:, but even that would t send me to sleep if Sleep wouldn t come to me I have discovered this riddle The lines are in Matthew Arnold's The Gipsy scholar ] How terribly few are the records discovered by thelaatAmencanl ranklmrxpedition though the honour is no less to it on that account The natives related, indeed though it must be almost a legend by this time-how " they saw a small party of officers believed to be the last survivors (from the Erebus and Terror) black about the mouths, and with no flesh about them, dragging a boat across the ice, but of material relics there were none save a few bones The Americans it is said however, secured a board, ' which may be of U8einirtentifymgthe ship which completed the north west passage In that board there may be a romance indeed, for if I am not mistaken the reward is still in abeyance that has been offered for that discovery, and it can still be claimed by the representatives of the shipowner or of the captain Difficult as it may be to trace dead men in the Arctic regions there are places where they disappear even more completely I read this week of an inquest on certain human remains (found in a lime kiln) consisting of " an iron dog and a tooth Such an inci- dent ought by rights to have taken place in Ireland Proceedings have just been taken against the manager of a theatrical company for altering a play I know nothing of the men is of the case, but if the dramatist carries his points the law must be inconsistent indeed since it permits him to pillage from the novelist as he pleases I am told, for instance, that the authoress of East Lynne has never received sixpence from those who have reaped thousands by dramatising and playing that story To punish for alterations, when such wholesale robbery in permitted, would be indeed Straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel Bigoted and idiotic as are the proceedings of tons of our fanatical (in le the Burials _ glass disc above, was written he has lost it, ( Bill, are), the East has still greater zeal A Mahommedan mob at Surfa attacked the houses of the Armenians the other day because one of them had married a Mahommedan wife who had become a Christian. After a good deal of plundering and outrage they brought the newly married couple before the Governor, who, I read, put the (unhappy pair in prison, and thanked the Mahommedan mob for their devotion and piety This is what some people call bringing religion home to us in quite an unusual way I suppose no mob has ever been called pious before They must have been as much astonished as the gentleman who found he had been talking prose all his life Until quite recently, it was an unwritten law in England that honours should be be stowed on nobody who had not the income to maintain them-a circumstance which (with some others) accounts for my never having been offered a peerage Even the C B -a distinction common enough-is not conferred upon persons likely to solicit charity in the street " I have seen better days , pity the poor C B Yet it seems that the possessor of a V C , which is a much greater honour, may be placed in this humiliating position, unless, indeed (as is probable, considering his antecedents), preferring death to dishonour, he prefers to starve or hang himself A correspondent of the Daily News has discovered one of these heroes in the person of a street scavenger, and is greatly troubled that such things should be But it is clearly unadvisable to give a pecuniary reward with the cross sufficient to keep a man to the end of his days on the other hand, what would be only just Built cient support for an officer would be vastly too much for a private soldier, nor would it be possible to make a difference in the scale of pensions A shilling a day, which was the allowance of the hero in question, stands as a means of livelihood certainly in need of some supplement, but I think that should be supplied, when necessary, by local benevolence rather than from the public purse No district is so mean spirited as to permit one of its own people, who has earned so rare a distinction as the Victoria Cross, to starve , while, on the other hand, it would be likely to know what sort of private character the applicant for its bounty possessed, for everyone is not a hero to his own churchwarden, nor even to the parish constable The Sultan, who as may be imagined, has as fine a sense of honours as of honour, has just conferred his principal order (the Med sides) upon his tailor, before reproaching him for his want of chivalry, however, we should remember that this may be the only means His Highness possesses of settling that gentleman's account It has been remarked by a writer in the Cornhill this month that we are getting very fond of tinsel here in England, but we are still far behind the French in this respect " In the last days of the Second Empire the Legion of Honour consisted of some 60,000 persons ' In the case of the military (and this has a direct bearing on the V C question a plain chevalier receives 2500 a year and a grand cross 5,000 In Austria decorations are given abundantly in default of something better, of which the Cornhill writer quotes the following charming story An Englishman calling one day on an Austrian general found him in the highest spirits " By Jove, they have given me the Elizabeth (a minor military decoration) The Englishman, who saw his friend a coat already so bedizened with stars and crosses that there seemed no room for more, looked astonished " Ah, you don D understand, ' cried the general, "they have given me the last remaining order the next time they must out with their snuff boxes which are as good as money In all the proceedings of the Church Congress there was nothing that gave me so poor an opinion of it as the discussion upon theatrical matters it only seemed to touch the very fringe of the subject I could not help thinking if that is the way a Church Congress debates upon a topic that is within the experience of every one of us, how superficial indeed must be its dealings with things spiritual If some excellent divine had devoted the time allowed to him to reading half an act of the " Pink Dominoes instead of to his own little preachment, and at the same time informed his audience (who apparently knew nothing about such things) that that was the sort of play that is now popular in London, and runs for 500 ments, a good deal of breath might have been spared At Chatham, in Lancashire I read that the Vicar, instead of going to the Congress to oppose the Burials Bill has been so far forgetting his position as to attend to the sick wife of the local Methodist minister, whereupon the latter, when she died, de- clined to avail himself of the new act, but requested the Vicar to perform the funeral ceremony The Vicar, however, called on the Methodist Free Church Minister, and invited him to come to the church, and assist at the funeral of his assistant a wife, which be did, wearing a surplice, and reading a portion of the church service It seems curious indeed that after 1800 years there should be found such a specimen of genuine Christianity as this I make little doubt that those of our politicians who are ready to keep their minds open with a view to any popular cry will presently have a word to say for the Peculiar People It is already thought no crime by some who should know better, that parents should please themselves as to not v vaccinating their children, or, in other words, as to sow ing the small pox broadcast, and why should they not take their own wilful way in the case of other diseases' At present however, I am glad to see that a verdict of manslaughter can still be found against people who for all ailments of their children have but one remedy-the outward application of salad oil It would be a good plan and tend to cover this superstition with the ridicule it deserves, if castor oil in good large doses were administered inwardly to all these offenders who at present " deny the effect of medicine All superstitions die hard and of the earthly ones, the Tichborne (except the fanciful allegiance to the House of Stuart) has perhaps lived the longest Though on exit crisis, it still exists Quite a large assembly was got together the other day in London to hear Jean Luio, ticket of leave man, ' make a statement of the old sort about the Osprey All that he now wanted, he said, to establish every thing was to know where young Bogle had gone to which, unless he has died it seems difficult to do Mr Luke traced the origin of his troubles to the trifling circumstance of his having married two women, and to the falsehoods and perjuries committed to escape the consequences Finally, he exhibited his fingers and affirmed, doubt lesS with some good and wise object, that they were permanently crooked ' I saw Jean Line under cross examination at West minster, and he struck me as permanently crooked in all directions The last sayings of dying men have always had a great attraction for their fellow creatures, and few sentences have moved the hearts of England more (the heart that beats quite outside the clubs and drawing rooms ) than those scratched by Michael Smith when shut up an 1 doomed to death in Seaham coal mine, upon his the water bottle "There was 40 of UB altogether at 7 am , florin was singing hymns, but my thoughts was on my little Michael '-a child whom he had left ill at home. " Oh dear wife, God save you and the children, and pray for my self Dear wife, farewell My last thoughts are about you and the children and (pace the "unco gold very proper subjects for a true man's last thoughts The story of the " Three Black Crowe has been quite outdone by that of the lion that escaped from Sanger's circus at Banstead, and occupying himself in eating the deer in Rtoh- I mond park, The account of the incident was received with such greediness that suburban holiday makers funked their favourite resort, while " inquiries at the western police officers were incessant, ' On the second day the animal devoured a respectable woman, a daintiness of taste which struck me as a fine touch The tale originated in some practical joker having taken down the sign from the Lion Inn at Banstead It has been always a matter of dispute whether London fogs are fatal or not, except in the Panston sense of driving us poor English to suicide It has now been proved that the fearful fogs between November and February last did largely increase the mortality from bronchitis, pneumonia, and hooping cough, and actually raised asthma to the rank of a deadly ailment In Kensal Green a Frenchman lies buried, over whose tomb is written, "Suffocated in a London 1 og, but up till now I always thought this a satiric touch, caused by some temporary break in the entente cordiale between the two nations I
