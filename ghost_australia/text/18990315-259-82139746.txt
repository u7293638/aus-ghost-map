FRIDAY NIGHT'S MEETING. (TO THE 1DITOB.) I isEAB Din,—i ne coniesi it over ; lost ana won; and there are (he ins and out« ot it. Morgan and Kates io, and the farmers' re presentative! out. The public, I think, are pleased that you reported Friday night's meet ing. Ona can picture in the mind's eye that youth Biking that Mr. Wilson's letter should ha read, and the mind's ear may yet catch np the reverbrrations ot " Let the gentleman come forward"; and when the pentleman did come forward on the batteries, lie turned out to be Wilson Junior, a youth who can hardly be 8aid to have donned (ha toga. Mr. Morgan had read bit own letter; young Wilson wished to have bis fatbrr's reply read. His appearance on the scene was some thing as unexpected aa the ghost ot Banquo, and a " fancy meeting you" look came from the empty chairs on the stage. It was, however, much easier getting the young man up than it waB to get him io sit down again. Three several times had the candidate in alentorian and strident tones to order him to sit down. Stnbborn kind of boy that. Is your report quite ooireot, Mr. Editor. Did Mr. Morgan aay that there were others behind Mr. Wilson as contemptible as himself ? Surely a man who rushed into the breach, and an outsider too, without committees, without help, and who in a very few day> scores over two hundred votes is not so very contemptible; and sorely the mere fact of opposing Mr. Morgan does not of itaalt constitute contemplibiiity. If so a great ittftnv noAnlo will wet mn (.ha n'olr ULYSSES. Warwick, March 14.
