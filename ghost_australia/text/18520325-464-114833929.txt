ftttrvaturr. INDOLENCE. Indolent ! indolent !? — yes, I am indolent : So is the grass growing tenderly, slowly, — ? So is the violet,. fragrant and lowly, ' . Drinking in quietness, peace and content,-: — So is the bird on the light branches swinging, Idly his carol of gratitude singing, ., Only on living and loving intent. Indolent ! indolent !— yes, I am indolent : So is the cloud overhanging the mountain, — So is the tremulous wave of a fountain, ; Uttering softly its eloquent psalm,— ? Nerve and sensation in quiet reposing, Silent as blossoms the night dew is closing, But the full heart beating strongly and calm. Indolent ! indolent ! — yes, I am indolent ; If it be idle to gather my pleasure Out of creation's uncoveted treasure, Midnight and morning — by forest and sea', — Wild with the tempest's subline exaltation, Lonely in autumn's forlorn lamentation, Hopeful and happy with spring and the bee. Indolent ! indolent ! — are ye not indolent, Thralls of the earth, and its usages weary,— Toiling like gnomes where the darkness is dreary, Toiling and striving, to heap up your gold, — Stifling the heavenward breath of devotion, — Crushing the freshness of every emotion, — Hearts like the dead that are pulseless and cold ? Indolent ! indolent ! — art thon not indolent, Thou who art living unloving and lonely, Wrapt m a pall that will cover thee only, Shrouded in selfishness, piteous ghost ? . Sad eyes behold thee, and angels are weeping O'er thy forsaken and desolate sleeping ; Art thou not indolent ? — Art thou not lost ? A. W. H. — New York Tribune.
