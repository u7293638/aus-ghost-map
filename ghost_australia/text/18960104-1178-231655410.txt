HAUNTED. When candle-flames burn blue, Between the night and morning, I know that it is you, My love, that was so true, And that I killed with scorning. The watch-dogs howl and bay; I pale, and leave off smiling. Only the other day I held your heart in play, Intent upon beguiling. A little while ago I wrung your soul with sighing ; Or brought a sudden glow Into your cheek by low, Soft answers, in replying. My life was all disguise, A mask of feints and fancies ; I used to lift my eyes And take you by surprise With smiles and upward glances. And now, where'er I go, Your sad ghost follows after; And blue the flame burns low, And doors creak to and fro, And silent grows the laughter.
