It is not nice to be laughed at, and-great s the temptation was to tell so good a. joke abroad, Fred promised faithfully to keep it ja secret, and let the ghosts die a natural death, as Annie had a rooted objection to being made-public fun of, though she and arah had ib stand a good deal of it when Fred had them at his mercy. A few daj s after was Christmas, and Fred and Annie—along with the holy rites attached—set it apart as a yearly anniversary and special day of thanksgiving to the "Departei Ghosts of Denver." It pwept a lot of cobivebs from their minds, and meant a commercial rite to the dear old homestead of twice its value. That had happened five years ago, but they still keep up the thanksgiving anniversary, and there is a bright little trio there now that help to make it lively and celebrate the fun. As for Denver now, it is one of the prettiest places to be found under a changing Austral sky, and one of tbe happiest bornes. PVed and Annie are fairly wedded to it, and would not leave it for a king's ransom. They smile now at the fears th&t; held them back from buying six or seven years ago. Even that grave in the far corner that helped to give rise to the history of the /'Denver Ghosts," is guarded by a new fence, and bright with wild flowers, where the children romp and play, and bring to the minds of their elders a line from one qf Gordon's poems—"I may chance to hear the sturdy station children romping overhead."
