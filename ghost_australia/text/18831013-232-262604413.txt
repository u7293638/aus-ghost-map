Y OPINION OF THAT BEAUTIFUL SPOT YCLEPT CHERUP SWAMP. Faith, I left it wid pleasure, Wid delight beyond measnre. Fur tbe devil a leimre BOUT did I enjoy. Sore, Td sooner *be shot, Than live in that same spot, For '£was nothing but roc Without any alloy. In the winther it's splindid, Tbe rain's niver endid. In mud, from your beadid Knees up to your e^es. As in summer it's roasting. Your all tbe day toastiog, An widout any boasting There's boggins o' files. So, fare thee well beggarly Cherup Swamp, Grublesa and grogless and tpudiess coanlrie, And if fate iver forces me back to that spot agtn, The divil himself be shall carry me. Faith, you've only to peep, At the wattis so deep. And rhe illigaut ah weep Of its schrubby-girt shore ; An the raphes a sight, tn That tbe frogs take delight In, Bat yoBll uiver git tight in That country, galore. For the diril a pub To be found in that Bcbrubb, Or the ghost of a taste ' Of the crathur, my dear. Och, £ Hirer WES shorthur, - Bad luck to that quarthor; ^ ' Sure it's mnrthur and sla'ughthur XL- live widout beer. So the back o' my hand, to yoa, beggarly swamp. Blowflies, BE' beetelM, black wathur, and tea; And If fate iver forces me badt to that fpot agin, Tho divil XiimstAf he sball-fchrrv-tne. ". :.' -> • atP.Hr
