POETRY. Strayed or Stolen. Has any one seen a pair of eyes As bluo as tho sea 'neath Grecian skies, And sweet red mouth and teeth like pearl ? Well, they belong to my little girl. She strayed away with a protty pout, And I don't know what it's all about. I would give my life, were my life all bliss, To feol again on my cheek hor kiss. She strayed away on u summer morn, When only tho ghost of a storm was born ; And it was born in her eyes of blue. I don't know what in tho world to do Without her smile and her soft caress, And her presence my days and life to bless, She was so fair, delicious, and sweot, That my heart never ktiew 'twas beneath her feet. Oh, she was so sweet— and she was so fair, With her lovely eyes and sott warm hair 1 And hor dear little hands that fluttered so, And in which the dimples would come and go, When she opened them wide or shut them tight, When love or storms mado her pink »r white. / Thoro is only this: I must pray to Him To send her back in tho twilight dim. Joiin Ernest M'Cann.
