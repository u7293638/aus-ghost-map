CIHILDISI-I FEARS. There are few things more degrading to the moral nature than fear, the ex pectation of pain. Healthy being is impossible under its influence, and one of our earliest cares must be to pre vent its even entering the atmosphere of a child's life. Tijidity and courage are alike easily developed, and it is the business of parents to foster the latter, while avoiding in every way to call .the former into growth. It is perhaps not too much to say that upon the impres sions and influences of the first seven years of our life depends our possession of the virtue of courage or our servitude to the demon of fear. MIan, both in his early and later years. has a dread of the unknown; to an in fant everything is unknown, and it be hoves its parents to watch that no new experience should come to it with fear. A sudden sense of helplessness in soli tude may be dangerously terrifying to a baby. The dark is terrible, unless al ways associated with a sense of secu rity and the mother's encircling arms. Children should never be put to sleep in a room without some shaded light, and the nurse within hearing of the slightest noise. If on waking they are not thus quickly reassured by light and attendance, they may suffer agonies of fear long before they can explain what they are feeling. No children, however yolung, should ever hear disagreeable or frightening things said in their presence. Ghost and goblin stories, murders and terrible descriptions of every kind, such as those in Blue Beard and The Forty Thieves, ugly, uncanfny, mysterious, or painful pictures - everything capable of excit ing fear - must be avoided by the entire household. An imaginative child will contrive to build, on the smallest mys terious suggestion, an image of dread which may haunt him for years.
