PAMS IX JUNE, 1878. (FROSt AN OCCASIONAL CORRESPONDENT.) PARIS, JUNE 7. 1 513 has been an unusually rainy.) season in Parts as else here, and the environs of the great city, as one approaches it by the Chemin de Perdu Nord look beautifully green and fresh at a period of the year at which they are ordered) dust) and dreary enough The flowering acacias which abound from Chan till) on to Paris are in full flower, and the mingled odours of the acacias and the Urnes reach the traveller very pleasantly, while the long lines of brilliant poppies and clumps of sunflowers brighten up the prosaic aspect of the " finish " of the long railway) line Then is one aspect of Paris which ever one army in here would do well to study at once, so as to have the earliest impression of it, it is the view at the sunset hour from the Pont de la Concorde, looking up and down the river, with the faint blue sky above the towers of Notre Dame de Paris, and the bars of purple and gold beyond the Arc de 1 Triomphe The scene is extraordinarily) beautiful just now the trees are laden with foliage, and the air is fresh, the everlasting movement of Paris seems multiplied a hundredfold, as the light fades from the sky, countless lines, clusters, interlacing wreaths, and pyramids of lamps shine in its stead, the Place de la Concorde is decorated with hundreds of Chinese lanterns, the wall of the Tuileries garden is closely set with them, and the) glimmer among the dark green leaved trees of the Berteaux A new concert has been established at the famous Oran_ene-one of the most ghost- crowded historic spots in ill Pans-and the long line of wall and promenade is gaily) draped with flags, while the new 1) adopted limelights throw their white lustre full on the facade of the Palais du Corps Legislatif, causing the build mgto assume the phy signing of a Greek temple, and lending a strange intensity) of expression to the stern colossal figures of the last mail ers of Old France in then marble counterfeits upon the parapet Of COILS, the topic of the time is the x position and the first nov city that strikes the visitor is the great building with its Oriental looking towers, which closes in the view at the end of theatres), and crow is the heights of the _ Trocadero, scene of so many lies and so immense a transit) of fireworks displayed in honour of so many illustrious personages forgotten, and memorable events ignored or reversed so far as faith accomplice ever can be reversed What an eloquent and impressive e sermon might be preached with merely) those words The Trocadero -for its text, but the people would not heed it, and as for the foreign visitors to Paris, they must be dull of brain and slow of heart if their own It thoughts do not supply all the applications which an) preached on such a test could enforce its building, seen from a distance, and more especially from the Tuileries side of the Place de la Concorde, is very) impressive the towers are graceful, the arched arcade of the portion intended to be used as a person must picture gallery and the great spurs whose two divis sions are united by the Port d renew Inch has been very skilfully used for the purpose, have all a light, and at the same time an Â¡in posing effect. On approaching the building by the Seine boats, which with a touch of Trench taste, are called ' Hirondelle Parisiennes the unfinished condition in which everything still is destroys to a certain extent the pleasing effect of the whole The spectacle of the Champ de Mars occupied by great ranges of building and seat tried " houses of all nations, covered with green houses which have a stranger) superficial and artificial air, beds of rhododendrons which are not at all flourishing of aspect, little ponds and little bridges which remind one of the design on the w allow pattern plate of famous memory, a brand new "gavotte with stalagmites, and stalactites, and trick ling streams (photographs of the "Gazette du Champ de Mars sell briskly) stand crowded with sightseers, is a suggestive e one How many) memorable scenes lies that vast space witnessed since it Free civ in its name Vv here onewonderSjVvastheeviitsiteonvvhiih was erected the altar of the country, where was that great tree of liberty pi match which was so soon to be watered with blood' Among the swarming crowd of to day one can see with the wes of one's fancy the phantoms of that crowd of patriot volunteers men, women, and children, who turned out with spades and shot els and wheelbarrows to get the Field of Mars ready for the great festival of peace which led straight to anarchy and terror life first time I ever saw the Champ de Mars en fete was when the Emperor Napoleon III reviewed his splendid troops there, with the Archduke Maximilian of Austria by his side I never could forget the splendour and the beauty of the Sight who could then have foreseen or imagined the catastrophes of Queretaro and Sedan The lost time I saw the Champ de Mars it was a camp of the Communists today it is the scene of a spectacle which, without being all the French people and the Parisian press make it out to be, is undeniable a fine spectacle, and an important event the difference between the order and organisation of public affairs under the Empire and their order and organisation under the Republic cannot, I think, fit to strike every one who knew Pans very iv ed in the Imperial do j s , it impresses itself on me ferments), and is peculiarly) apparent in the incompleteness and disorderliness of the position, even up to the present time, when the show has been open for more than a month, and Paris has been forsaken by the Parisians Everywhere there is a want of " tenure and though the larger and more serious interests of the country may be, as the Republicans declare the) are, secured and advanced by the change in the system of go eminent, those are not the aspects visible to strangers, while the external alterations for the worse are very evident indeed to them. The streets are not kept with the same are, officials are neither so quick nor so cm!, the cocher is a more brutal and insolent being, and altogether there is It Raissa alla about things in general, which may be a tribute to liberty and equality), but does not awaken fraternal feelings in the breast of foreign sufferers from the change 'iourTeadeta will have detailed accounts of the Exposition from other sources, so that I shall not attempt to do more than record my now 11 impressions of the spectacle They were not at first favourable, because of the unfinished state of everything, and the inevitable confusion attendant on that condition Great vacant spaces, the noise of hammers, the concourse of workmen , piles of scaffolding which intercept views and spoil effects, dirty floors, and complicated heaps of packing cases, with ensuring coils of rope which hem wait for the feet of the unwary visitor, clouds of dust from the screens at which the workmen are preparing mortar and the debt is of dinners lying about in old newspapers, are adjuncts of the scene of which one would gladly be rid, but they do not seriously impede the sense of grandeur and interest which soon takes possession of one The most effective view of the Exhibition is obtained by entering the Champ de Mars on the Trocadero side, and contemplating the spectacle from the centre of the Pont dJena 'the grout permanent building on the heights, with its crimson lined arcades, its fountains the vast lawn in front, the colossal gilded figures of lamp at animals the lofty) towers, the deep blue si) behind the view, from the bridge of tin rivet c row ded with boats, w ending, 11 war) between the thick 1) planted chateaux the constant is set not on the bridge itself the stretch of "aldon beyOnd and then the long cliches 1 life of the exhibition building proper it wants height, however, md the row of colossal statues is much too low for either grandeur or beauty the fluttering of countless rings the former looking constructions dotted about all combine to present a spectacle which certainly has not had a ni u among exhibitions The supreme elegance of the Crystal Palace can never be attained by any building which has not a glass roof, and in that supreme elegance the French Exhibition is deficient The plan of it is simple, and easily mastered Tw n immense transit crsal galleries give admit twice into a number of lofty lanes lined on each side with splendid shops, or, in the department of the fine arts, with galleries of painting and sculpture The chief defect of the building is that the idea of space is interrupted by the uniformity of these lanes, and that, except at the wide passages which are points of intersection, when one walk- through each of them, one has no percep- tion of anything outside the lofty arched roof and the gorgeously decorated velvet hung and balustrades bazaar on either side No doubt the preciousness of space has led to the running up of the walls of these lines to a height which impedes ventilation, but it is a fact that it is seriously impeded, especially in the picture galleries, which being enclosed within it corridor, and not themselves opening to the outer air, are very suffocating This, and the absence of coups daily, are, in my opinion, the two faults of the building with the arrangement and the display within the walls I do not think anyone could be disappointed The facade of the fine arts galleries is equally grandiose and beautiful, with its spacious and lofty archway, its entablature m porcelain tiles, and its magnificent hang- ings of rich tapestry and v civ et The draping of every arch and rooms throughout the vast building, the rich pollutes in all the fashionable neutral tints, the carelessly disposed velvet and tapestry covered seats, the rails padded and civ once ered, w lthebonisecl supports, the rich carpeting everywhere, give a truly palatial appearance to the building, which makes the want of coup did more regrettable The idea of the Rue des Nations is a pattern truly happy one, and the illusion there, when the affirms is at its height, is very strong and pleasing, for there are the vi area, the luxuries, the domestic architecture, the comestibles, the people, and the language of numerous countries Russia is splendidly represented in the departments of furs, church vestments, vehicles, somewhat barbeque jew ellery, the piquant liqueurs and strange dainties of the north, and the house that representS those abodes which Ivan lourgiieucf has made familiar to our fancy is a curious and beautiful structure in painted wood I don't think any one could contemplate the Hue lies Nations without being reminded of the old pictures in the Pilyi nn s Pt or less of Vanity Fair, with its swarming multitudes, and its noisy pleasures On every side are strange costumes and strange faces, and tongues str mger than all the we wonderful Japanese court, house, and restaurant, and the Chinese, with its ministers >n porcelain and barque, its oblique eyed civil attendants, and the fierce looking warriors of the Dragon, who contribute the armed guard to the treasure house of the transplanted Flowery Land It was another happy idea to have a small contingent of soldiers from each country to act as sentinels, and the many coloured uniforms and brilliancy life, and now ement to the scene The Svv iss ch shot, the Spanish posada, the old English house, with the little tavern built by Mr Cubitt, the rustic building representing forests and the human life in them, and decorated with specimens of every kind of artificers work in wood the working maris house from the workshop in Bunhill row , the innumerable summer-houses, hot- houses, conseil stones, with wonderful devices thewie of stovesandpipesandsupple blinds, painted green, and looking like silk, but of stout iron in reality -all these form an almost bewildering ensemble, and when one has grown quite familiar with them one has yet seen nothing of the Algerians, the 'I animas, the Turks, who have then gaudy separates shining and basking in the Bun, which really has had a touch of the Orient in it for two or three days past on the Trocadero side These beauties form a curious spectacle, they make one think of Nijni Novgorod, of Cure, of all the human anthills where the chartering of barter and sale goes on under far foreign skies, and every moment, as the crowd pours in and out, among the pigs and saddlery, the tobacco, the bonbons, the strings of beads, the piles of weapons, the sheaves of hand-mirrors, the sacks of dates, some strange figure meets there In the space of five minutes one may see a gi are Arab in turban and burnes, shark in baggy trousers and crimson fe;-, a jet black Nubian m pure white attire, a splendid-looking Indian with rings and jewelled hooks in the lobes of his ears, and line limbs showing like bronze pillars among the folds of his clothing, an intelligent Japanese, moving more quickly than any- one else in the crowd, a Chinaman, in green and yellow, with a good deal of both colours in his complexion a Levantine Creek, with handsome features but insignificant figure, and then the same types repeated 01 cc and over again Having made a particular study of the pottery and glass vases in the Exhibitions of 1853 (in Dublin) and 1802 (in London) respectively, I am especially impressed by the great advance in both, and by the extraordinary grace, beauty, lightness, advance of the French and Austrian pro auctions The long lines of sparkling crystal objects form a scene w Inch is indeed fairy like, and the exquisite taste with which the display is arranged-m many instances on a black velvet ground, with a background of puffed white satin magnificently fringed with gold and silver could not be too highly praised The display of furniture is of very various merit, the English being superior in form and finish, except in the case of some incredibly magnificent beds, which one can hardly believe to be real even while one is looking at them, with their gorgeous draperies of satin and embroidery, precious brocades and fringes, carving, inlaying, and dainty flower decoration There is one small low bed with a lofty canopy, curtains, hangings, and cove effect of pale blue satin, which looks as if it had been simply pelted with all the roses in Flora's garden in mid June. Most beautiful, too, are the tapestries and the mirrors, the grandees, and the lamp, the bull cabinets, and the innumerable objects in brass, bronze, ver- veil, and ormolu. Then the jewels pearls enough to ensure all the harems in Turkey if they had the stringing of them , diamonds enough to surfeit all the diseases in Europe, combinations of all the lustrous treasures of the earth enough to reduce the Arabian Nights to a mere catalogue reasonable All the world crowds to see the diamond cutting in the great industrial gallery, and round the Prince of Wales's Indian treasures, which form a great feature of the show Mr Coleman, who is in charge of the Prince's pavilion, showed me allow of the bijou building, which does credit to the taste of Messrs Gillon, and the skill of the tapestry workers at M intlsor The incongruity between the portrait of Queen Victoria, and the designs which represenative Merry M Ives of Windsor, is, of course, very evident, but with that exception all is in perfect taste, and the beauty of the workmanship displayed in the simple and cleg mt furniture could not be surpassed The Prince of Wales is certainly the most popular of Lui ape in personages among the Parisians at present. He is coming over on Saturday to be present at the grand ball will n is to be given at the Non Continental Hotel for the benefit of the English poor in Pins The bull is expected to be a very brilliant sunshine, the lady patronesses having excited themselves immensely in the chair billion of ticks is and the arranging of all the accessory ICB I have just seen two very beautiful toilettes which are to be worn on the occasion One is composed of opaline satin, the skirt trimmed with zamia ture Prince of Males plumes in main bout feathers, with silver knobs the other is composed of silver tissue worn over white a space Clune, and is to be garlanded with wreaths of red roses and lion e de Dion which will not be placed on the dress until just before the fair wearer leaves her dress ing room for her carriage They are replaced for the house by artificial flowers, in order to enable one to judge of the effect, which is most elegant and striking
