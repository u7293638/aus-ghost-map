OTHEH RESOUTS. Emerson and Woods' celebrated Ala bama Minstrels etil! continue to hold their out against all comers, under the management of the leuley Sinionsen at the Opera House. The management hit upon a happy idea when they resolved to change their programme at ehoit intervals, the public appreciate this sort of thing, with the only natural result. Crowded houses nightly. At the Alexandra Mixed has enjoyed an altogether prosperous week, the company gathered under the wing of the popular and versatile Carey, are making things literally hum, at this usually very much 'stiff' house. The 'Ghost' walks, which is about the greatest compliment that could possibly be paid any Alexandra management. The Cogill Brothers are still on the ta ra-ra-boom, and the boys smile accord ingly, their present programme compares more than favorably with those of the past, which the general public are not slow in recognising, that's if the persist ent manner io which they present them selves nightly at the pay box is any criterion. Phil Stuart also is making things hum at the VVaxworks. Phil has no end of country friends, and of the right sort, for he has been doing grand ' biz.'' during the past week — may it con tinue. Excellent attractions for. the coming week. The '' Vic.' still runs, at least we think bo, we couldn't say for certain which of course, is of little or no consequence whatever. FITZGERALD CIRCUS. At the top end of Swanston -street, City, the thoroughly Australian circus is rapidly closing its farewell season as far as this city is concerned. During the past week the attendance, despite the unfavourable state of the atmosphere has been, well almost phenomenal. 'Quiz.' notes with pleasure, that the business is conducted on the same old satisfactory basis, headed by Mr Tom Fitzgerald, assisted by the popular and always smiling agent — Hendy by name.
