SIDING AT YARRAVILLE. A deputation from the Borough Counail of Faotscray was introduced to the hon. tbo Minister of Railways this morniDg by the local member. The abject of the ddoutstion wns to ask that a Biding at Faotscray might ba altered ao as to aooommodate the growing wants of the dietrlat, It appeared that in July last Mr Woods, tho then Com missioner of Railways, at the request of a similar deputation, made a siding there, but this didjnot suit the wants of the surrounding places. It was alleged to-day, for Instance, that at present it was difficult for trains to back up to the station, so as to take up produce when required, as li.nÂ£ a delay as four days sometimes taking place between the intervals at wmo i truoks were removed. Mr Gillies said that he did not see why all those facts had not been placed before his predecessor. As far aa the Railway department was concerned he could only say that it had not a ghost of a farthing to expend. At the end of the financial year, however, a small amount might bo plaoed on the estimates to do absolutely iieaessary work, but ho could eay this, if laud waa to be bought, the Government would have nous of it at the exorbitaut prices so often asked when it was known that the Stato required to gain possession of a strip. FOOTBRIDGE. In reply to the eame deputation, Mr Gillies said that ho would not for a moment at present entertain- tbe idea of erecting a footbridge over' the Sandhurst liae, at Hope- will street.
