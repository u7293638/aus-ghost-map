victoria Amateur Turf Club Races» SECOHD DAT, OCTOBER 18. (Br TBLBGBAPH. FROM "CASPIAS.")'. i ALTHOUGH the weather this morning gave every appear-kf ance of raining before the gathering was over, it cleared up sufficiently to admit of the Caulfield Cup day of the V. A.T.C. passing off most successfully The fields wore largo and in some instances produced very exciting finishes. Tha Steeplechase and the Nursery Handicap supplied interest-' ing contests. One of the largest attendances over known waa j present, and tho crushing in the trains was only equalled I by the tramcar rush on a race day at liandwick. Tberaf is ono thing in connection with Caulfield which I cannot[ understand, and that is the very inadequate accommoda tion given to tho Press- Surely Mr. Bond, who is an old1 journalist, should know better. Last taturdaythe press-/, box, which is small and indifferently situated, was filled | with, strangers, and pressmen had to obtain scats any-5 where. This stato of affairs will 1 hope ho remedied on-j my next visit. At half-past 1 the bell tolled its warning | for tho Bolling Eace. ll candidates came to the post. J Castaway and Stonebroke wore tho selections ; butt old Mistako, who looked well, came with a run from tho distance, aud won easily. He was bought in for-f £70. After a short respite for luncheon, tho second hurdle* raco engaged attention. Tho withdrawal of Ontario \ brought Gosolicr into prominence, and 3 to 1 was freely-[ accepted. Bon Quixoto came next, while Hazard, whof many thought would ho resorvod for Melbourne, left tho [ paddock at 6 to 1 chance, oo that his party could not have f fancied him a great deal. After Schobelolf aud Tantaliserl made tho running, tho favonrito took tho command j but t Hazard came out at the distsnco, ran over; her, and won comfortably by two lengths, For. the Hursory Handicap, Violet was tho chosen one ; but.' boforo the competitors had left tho paddock Wolseley} rcaohed S to 1, and at a point moro tho Teacher was sup-' ported. Ocista was tho only other name mentioned/ Delamift led for abont two furlongs, and then gave plací to Wolseley and Ocista; the favourite was never dan-j gorous. The New South Wales colt rounded the turn fori ! home, and appeared nil over a winner when the Teaoher^ carno in tho gamest poasiblo manner and just won» by a head. The winner is a very nico colt, by ii Gang1 Forward, and was trained by Mr. James Wilson,^ jun. Ho is snpposed to bc many lengths better than Bing- , master. All the visitors wore now cager to scan the : different candidates for Con honours. Malua, ono of the i first to como nuder my notics, looked perhaps a trillo bigger ' than when at Eandwick, but was full and well, with a nice. > clear oyo. Eapid was next, and apj^eared lighter than I¡ have over seen him. Martini-Henry gavo every sign.' of having a leg. This was proved in the race, as ho broko dowu. Fryingpan, although! j strung up to perfection, evidently~ suffered from" the bniiso which ho received in his hoof. Colstoun rather disappointed mo, and certainly did not display all the . outward signs of a horso who had undorgone the severe 1 Îireparation ho was supposed to havo received. Helene \ ookedwell to th« eye, and so did Lord Wilton, who is sus-i ' ceptible of improvement. Hastings walkod abont the pad-1 dock with all the dignity of a king, but it is evident that1 tho Caulfield course docs not 6uit him. Claptrap, Conioa* I turo, and Battailous, had boon carefully trained, while Norfolk and Despot ware evidently Bhort et a gallop. Vorgy had the largest levco of admirers.., He was big and loaded with muscle, and with ono of the best back» ever wen on -a horso. Bis supporters thought that the\ Cup waa all over " bar shouting." Ringwood waa kee scanned; but not the slightest notice was taken of 'stable companion, Blink Bonny, and some timo elap before hoi* party could obtain the services of a lad to i lier. After tho horses did their preliminaries, they w marshalled before Mr. WaUon. Previously to start two lads were fined for disobedieu< ono of them hoing young Gough on Private Ironhnnd also broke away. Tho starter is rather sev here.and oven thou does not got Iiis Haids well away. W] the fla? foll liastingi was the iirst away; but he goon gi way to Yately, Helene, Battalions, Bend Or, Korfc Bapid, aud Vority.who roniaincd iu the first flight ia pas» tho stand. Fryingpan, Despot, and Martini-Henry heat the next division, and Malua was lase, and ran very wi Xatoly, attended by Helone, continued at tho head affairs; hut along tho back Norfolk nearly brou* ?down the favourite, Vergy, who fell back ii tho. ruck. The deceiving son of Warlike i ?"bang" into the straight, whore ho collapse J Claptrap drew up to Helene, but Blink Bonny oame wit] great run on the outside, followed by Lord Wilton, a headed the leaders. Thau Verey. who had made up 1 Jost gronml, carno away, but ; nothing could catch the 01 Ë. Blink Bonny, who won easily oy a length and a h sa Lord Wilton, who was a length in front of Ven Ina, who caaio faster than anything else from the el oe on the oxtromo outside of his flold, was fourth. H ho been wanted oarlier, ho could have run second. Tl raeo over, none but tha motallioiam rejoiced. J Shrcugh tho meeting look hus been dead against t public and backers. Blink Boony is auothor of the f LAlbans family, and was brained by Mr. Wilson, ot Ballan /Twice the maro was tried with Kingwood and found wai jing. A fow days agu Uraaknell went to tfallurat und ro ¡her, when Kingwood beat her badly. The same jock ^refused to ride hor in the Cup ; and, as already mcntione p-t was not until tha very last minute that a jock [waa obtained. When 'tommy Corrigan was nuki [whether Blink bonny had a chance he xomarkc «'A dog's." Signor's rider fell off after tl \atand was passed. The lad was not injured. 11 ."horse having rna loose, interfered with Hasting '»ad Martini-lienry along tho back. The sensational Cc jitoun. was never dancraroa». Aile: a mile had bei .-traversed ho wa» clean out of tho hunt. Martini pulled v Wery- lame, and ic is feared that ho has brokoa dow SEleren started for the Steeplechase which wis won, aft 'a grand tin ish, by Struggler from Keno; Denmark ran Kamo third. Tho Windsor Handicap brought out 10. S {John was considered "real jam;" but tho brother (Trum a Voss was unequal to tho task, and Mozart, a rei 'jOmart son of Napoleon and Qw:on Mary, cut his field don After the distança was passed in tho fast time of lmln 17se «ver a heavy coursa Hurricane, who won tho raco la «ear, was second; and Irrafee, who made all therunnin ?
