PASTORAL LETTER OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF MELBOURNE. The pastoral letter of the Archbishop of Melbourne (Dr Carr was read in all the Catholic churches of the diocese at the different services yesterday The Archbishop, after dealing fully with the doctrine, practices, and advantages of the Lenten fast and abstinence and quoting the words of the Gospels in its support, says - To the observance of the Lenten fast jean, dearly beloved prayer which is the mystic ladder reaching from earth to Heaven on which the petitions of men are daily and hourly borne up to God, and the angels are ever descending with gifts to men. During the Lent will be celebrated the episcopal jubilee of our Holy Father Leo XIII You will not fail to pray earnestly for him and for the wants of the church Addresses yy will be presented to him on the auspicious occasion on the part of the bishops and clergy of Australasia and on behalf of the young men, and of the members of the Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society The members of the Catholic Young Men s Society in and around Melbourne have signified their intention of receiving communion in a body on Sunday, 11th 1 February, the day fixed for the formal celebration of the jubilee This praiseworthy mode of celebrating the festival will we feel confident, be observed by other religious bodies and societies in the archdiocese Join also, dearly beloved to Your fast and abstinence, alms giving The Lenten dispensations are now much more extensive than in former times , those who use them should be mindful of the duty of substituting one good work for another Objects for the benevolence of the faithful are surely not yy wanting Even during this summer season there is a by widespread want of employment, on account of which many sober and industrious men are left without any decent means of support for themselves or their families The religious organisations through which charity may be dispensed are the safest channels for conveying the aims of the faithful to the deserving poor. The different branches of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul the Ladies Association of Charity, the Sisters of Mercy and of Charity, the Little Sisters of the Poor, and the Sisters of St Joseph are doing admirable work in reltcMtig the wants of the poor, and are entitled to generous support on the part of the charitable public The substantial progress made towards the completion of St. Patrick's Cathedral during the last 12 months is in itself a powerful appeal for continued aid to the building fund Already the finished outlines of the majestic building are coming out one by one, grey eating the grace and grandeur of the completed structure The exertions of the Rev. R P Collins, who is engaged in collecting funds are for the present directed to the country districts of the archdiocese It is due to the people of the rural parishes to say that their liberality promises to in at the splendid generosity of the city and suburban population I have already stated and I now repeat my desire, that the cathedral should be a testimony of faith and piety on the part of every Catholic in the archdiocese Let no one who admires the external beauty of the building and praises the progress made, withhold that practical support which will be much needed during the current year to keep pace with the large expenditure rendered necessary by the terms of the contract I he time is rapidly approaching when the sacrifices and labours of thirty years will be drowned in the solemn opening and consecration of a cathedral which for massive proportions and graceful outlines, will bear comparison with some of the great old cathedrals which mother lands are the glory of the Catholic Church Finally, dearly beloved bear in mind that in supporting the Catholic schools you are not only providing for your children an excellent literary and scientific and religious education but you are also acting as stan dartl bearers for Christ and for Christian faith and morality Wherever religious instruction has been suppressed in the schools as in France, the tide of infidelity and immorality has mun dated the land A distinguished Protestant dignitary, speaking was that the last few months in a neigh- boating colony, bears testimony to the truth of this statement After quoting the strong language recently used by the present Anglican Bishop of Manchester (Dr Moorhouse) regarding the baneful effects of the secular system of education on the morals of the youth of Victoria, he continues - Another note of warning came from Paris where the Government has steadily eliminated church fetching from the common schools A clergyman who had been of late chaplain in the French capital said that Protestants were at first overjoyed at the abatement of the priests influence, now they all agreed that the results of the measure were deplorable An official report addressed in 1888 by inspectors of Workshops and factories in Paris to the Prefect of the Seine contains the following-" We have noticed with pain the lack of moral instruction in the jury ernie employes - Although they have attended Goura de main are an improved version of Hackwood) in the schools they have left, they show no trace of it It proves that the instruction is given in a most imperfect manner It is an unpleasant duty to report that for want of moral education the children are losing all notions of respect and duty, and becoming addicted to bad language and obscene expressions Their misconduct in the public streets is often scandalous Iii dry one is complaining, and many employers will no longer engage up prentices on account of the trouble they cause It is high time to put a stop to these moral disasters He further stated that there had been a rapid multiplication of juvenile crimes within the last decade The houses of correction were gorged with boys and girls There was a proposal for pulling down the Paris Gaol for young criminals in order to erect a larger establishment in its place M Guillot, one of the best known French judges, called public attention in 1888 to the fact that the increase of juvenile crime was beyond doubt coincident with the changes introduced into the public instruction If a Catholic dignitary had spoken so plainly and so emphatically his language would be at once denounced as highly exaggerated and as grossly unfair towards the secular state system of education In reply to the misleading statement that the remedy lay with the churches and their Sunday schools, the same Protestant dignitary aptly remarks, "But what it the rising generation, bred under the secular system lost interest in Sunday schools, and when their turn came cared nothing about sending their children to them ' That this might follow was evident if what the Bishop of Manchester further stated were true, that in 1888, in Victoria, 712 per cent, of children of school age attended the Sunday schools while in lbDO the attendance was only 39 per cent. The parents did not care, and was it likely the children would be anxious to go' Surely that was a point to think on Besides, Sunday school teaching alone made no impression in the habitual thoughts and feelings of the children, and they soon shook it off and forget it, unless they were very well disposed or carefully taught at home, or, above all, it might have been added, unless religious knowledge was impressed on their minds from day to day as part of the ordinary school work Such, dearly) beloved, is the system of education which you are compelled to support, and by which such of your children rest are receiving it, through the fault of their parents are becoming rapidly) demoralised flic Catholic children so trained, or rather so defrauded of all religious knowledge and religious principle in school, afterwards avenge the injury done to them on their parents and on society, and are then maliciously and inconsistently exhibited in the public press as the opprobrium of the Catholic Church May God open the eyes of Catholic parents to the cruel wrong will) do their children by placing them under the corroding influence of a secular system of education, and may He give true wisdom to our rulers, and make them see that it is righteousness, and not material wealth nor secular knowledge alone, that exalteth nation The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all, dearly beloved, and prepare you for the worthy celebration of the 1 east of the Resurrection of our Lord \+ Thomas Joseph, Archbishop of Melbourne St Patrick's Cathedral, Feb, 1853
