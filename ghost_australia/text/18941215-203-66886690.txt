EXPERIENCE.-At the Springrale dairy a few days ago two persons had a sensational experience with a snake, it appears Miss Straughen was resting in a room during tile after noon and had left the door open through which a snake entered. It was observed by a neice of Miss Straughen's a little girl about 4 years old, who immediately slammed the dcor and then informed the young lady of the reptile's presence. The two became terrified and nmounted a chair in the room. The noise and bustle evidently tended to excite the animal for it tore round the room at lightning pace trying to find a way of egress. The cries of Miss Straughen brought assist ance, but immediately the door was opened the snake dashed out and was soon olear away. A search was subse quently made which resulted in the reptile being foundl in soiime bushes and dispatched. It is miraculous that in its miad career the snake did not bite either of the persons caged in the room, and Miss Straughen's experience is one that is not likely to be forgotten in a hurry. The Goz'crneo;ntf Gazctte is filed at this office, and may be inspected at any time by our subscri'ers. ANsNuA.
