District Intelligence WELLINGTON. (Gazette) _ Tho gold dredging maohino, at the junc tion of tho Muoterwa and the Maoquario, ia working very aatisfaotorily, under the management of Mr. MoDouall. Tho ongines nd all parts of tho machinery aro in Bplondid ordor, and tho returns of gold aro satisfactory. Tho following was told tho othor night by a ' swaggy ' at one of fho pubs. Not long ago I was down tho Macquario looking for a job at anything. Ono day, about sundown, weary and footsoro, I arrived at a watorholo and camped for tho night, tuokorless, having beon refused a bit to oat at the nearest station. Shortly after I arrived a tramp oamo up from tho oppoaito direction. ' Hulloa, raato,' said ho, 'havo you got any tuokor ?' ' Not tho ghost of a bit,' said I.' What you havo no tuckor, and that big housoyou have passed up thoro?' I confessed I had beon there looking for food and work, and had boon throatanod with tho dogs. ' I can seo you havo not boon on tho track very long,' said ho. ' You wait horo till I como back and Bhow you what I can do.' Away ho wont, and in duo timo roturnod with an amplo food for tho two of us. Having satis fied a raging appotito, I aakod my now friend how ho had managod to succeed whoro I had misorably failed. ' 0, I know how to work tho oraclo, I am not now to tho game; seo horo.' Ho took from tho poekot of his tattorod coat a pieco of hard caked oowdung. ' Woll, I hold that in my hand, and ask for a littlo suit, I say I oan manage to oat it with salt, but without salt I can't look at it.' Tho pooplo aro aston ished, and tho women ask mo if I am so re duced as to bo compollod to oat stuff liko that. I murmur that I am indeod com polled to eat it. Thon thoy pity mo, and give mo food, tho sumo as you soe I have brought to-night. ' Gosh', you are a bloomor,' said I, 'who olso would have thought of such a thing?'
