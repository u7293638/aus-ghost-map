AT St. Leonards, this week. Sir HENRY PARKES discoursed before his electioneering committee on the subject of, " Slattery's crowÂ«." A few days previously Mr. WISE spoke on a similar theme. Vulgar people have another title for the subject ; they call it " The bloody shirt"; whilst some satirists have described it as "The Kiama ghost." I can say most positively that Mr. Wiso be- lieves, or professes to believe, that there is a conspinicy in the Roman Catholic Church to work the next Parliamentary elections in such a manner that the Assembly shall con- tain a. majority of Roman Catholics. This information I had from Mr. Wise's own lips, and it was to that alleged conspiracy he referred in his Redfern address. And when Sir Henry Parkes spoke of "Slattery's crows," is it not reasonable to assume that he had this supposed conspiracy in his mind ? The veteran will be more than foolish if he raises the sectarian question at the general election, and the result of his conduct will be disaster to himself. It would be a bad thing for the country if any sect became n. domina- ting force in Parliament, but I do not believe that any of them is attempting to accomplish this object.
