THEORY AND FACT. People are very sare as to \rhat their conduct would be in certain supposed cases. For instance : who knows a lady who does not declare that if she were to awake and find a burglar in the room, she would lie silent and motionless,feign sleep, watch the man closely, and so escape uninjured and be able to identify next day ? Who knows a man who does not inevitably remark, when the subject of fire in a place of amusement is spoken of: " Oh, I should be perfectly calm, I should be caref-il not to be pushed forward by the crowd. If I had a lady with me, I should mike her keep her seat, and so should escape without injury or agitation ?" And who knows a person of either sex that does not vow that on the appearance of an apparition he or she would quietly walk up to it touch it, and prove that it was noth ing but a waving garment, a pump kin lantern, or a shadow ? Ail this sounds very fine ; but, alas, when the lady does awake to find the burglar decamping with her earrings and her watch, her best silk dress and her new bonnet, she utters shriek after shriek, manages to get herself at least partially choked, and after all finds it impossible to declare whether the man who stole her property was white or black, six feet or five feet in height, or masked or not. The man who feels certain that he could stand unmoved amidst a conflagration in theory, on hearing the cry of fire in actual fact, either in lectur^ room or theatre, starts to hie feet, either dragging his lady companion with him, or forgetting all about her, and rushes out at the door, roaring lustily for the engines, to learn of the wicked boy who gave the alarm that " the fire is in the stove." And your brave ghost - seer having hung his own night cap on a gas fixture, totters into the apartment of his dearest friend at midnight with the information that he has had a warning of approaching death is the appearance of a spectre seven feet, high, that he believes to be his grandfather.
