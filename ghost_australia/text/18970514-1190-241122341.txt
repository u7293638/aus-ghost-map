REAL GHOST STORIES SPEOTRES SEEN BY " SUOCESSI- TIES," (From "Success.") We linvo never bccii a genuine ghost ourselves, so we cannot atlti uny expe rience of our own to those sent In By our readers. Wo remember, however, being once the recipient of a spectre visit. It was at n big house-party at New Year's time. We hail retired to bed. Illled with good cheer and better resolutions, und were comfortably dropping off to sleep when the door opened quietly, and something In white glided softly towurds us. Wo were very i Interested nt the phenomenon, und our , hair stood straight up on end. Unfor tunately, however, for the success of the spectre's visit, he chanced to run Ills toe against the corner of a tin trunk with such force that lie had to hop about the room on one foot and groan with pain. Then our hair lay down flat, and we chuckled softly to ourselves. The spectre somehow seemed to realise thai he wuh u lilt of n failure, and after glancing furtively from under his sheet at our recumbent form to see whether we were awake, lie took advantage of a lung-drawn snore on our part to heat a hasty retreat.
