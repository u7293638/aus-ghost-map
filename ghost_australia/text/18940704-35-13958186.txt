THE GENERAL ELECTION. AMONG TPIE ELECTORS. THE SYDNEY CONSTITUENCIES. (BY OUS SPECIAL KEFOEXEII.) V.-IN SOUTH SYDNEY. Thero is plenty of paper to be found in and about tho Belmore Division, whicD forms part ot tno old South Syduoy electorato The paper takes tho shape of garish blue and rea posters, wnich are plastcrea on every street corner and hung our irom every hotel balcony, so that one b oyo is constantly met with the request to voto for the on'y true repr"«entative of labour, or the only uncompromising upholder of freetnde or protec'ion, as tho case may be And Belmore s decorated m this way because of the vast n imber of candidates who navo ohosen the httli division as a suitable spot wherein ti, try their prentice hands at Parliamen- tary cand dature Why Belmore, lather than any other oil no now division»,, should bo so afflicted is Lard to understand bat the fact re- main that no less tfu.n 10 gentlemen have an- nounced their .ntontiou oi contesting the election, noue of whom held seats in the last Parliament. It would be superfluous to run over tho whole list of these names, because a gooct many oi tno candidates will nover go to the poll It is noticeable, though, that not ono of the o'd representatives of South Sydney has chosen to stand for tnis division, and thus tho way has been, opened for an entirely new Bet of men It is a compact httlo electorate, and one which should be easily worked, for every inch of ground ia occupied by dwelling houses, and one can walk m a very few minutes trom one end of the division to tho o*her It does not take long, for instant e, to pass through Macquario-street South, from Liverpool-street to Toveaux-strcet, and yet in this brief space one has traversed tho vvholo electorate from north to sonth From east to west or from Riley stwot to Elizabeth street, is a stül shorter »onrnoy, but in this small area, which occupies but little moro room on tho map than does Hyde Park it is recorded thai there are over 2300 persons entitled to ex »reise tha franchise This means i population o£ nrobablv 10 000 Certainly, if the new electoral arrangement has done nothing elso, it has sho-vn us how grievously somo portions of tho city ure overc-owded and how much need there is for spreading tho population over a larger ai ca where each luniily wo aid bein a position to oota n at least a modicum oi sunlight and fresh air There are strcts upon s reefs of crowded t°r ace houaes, each jammed ono upon tho other with the sole ideaoi s nins* (Tound rent there aro nerrow and unsavoury thoroughfares ¡riven up wholly to tho use of tho Mon0ohan, wnere opium dens and fautan shops moro or le»a openly car-icd on abound The market gardener and his ally, the vege able hawker specially itiect this locality, and there must bo severaf nundred Chinaman liymc;

Adjoining the Belmore this electorate resembles it in many respects, though the population is not quite so closely packed, and the householders are perhaps, on the whole, better off. The district includes a considerable portion of Bourke-street and Crown street, where there are many houses of large size and a number of boarding establishments, which of course add greatly to the voting population. It is bounded to the northward by Oxford-street, where there are many shops and much business activity. From this great thoroughfare Riley - street and Dowling-street branch off in a parallel direction, and these two streets, almost entirely of a residential character, form the eastern and western limits of the division. On the south, where it touches the Cook electorate, the boundary line is more irregular, going in a zigzag manner from one small street to another. The division is somewhat larger than the Belmore though it has a hundred fewer voters, a fact which indicates that the population is somewhat less closely herded together, and that the houses are therefore larger and inhabited by a class somewhat better off than their neighbouring voters. Hence a can- didatc who is in touch with the propertied classes should have a better chance here than in Belmore, and Mr. Wise has probably been well advised in choosing this division out of the four into which his old South Sydney constituency has been split up. So far only one other freetrader (Mr J B Ollife) is announced, whilst the protectionists have two men (Mr J. V. Wiley and Dr Kesteven) in the field. This latter gentleman is but a new- comer to the electorate but Mr Wiley, who was an unsuccessful candidate for Central Cumberland at the last general election, has lived for some 12 years in the district. Hence it is pro- bable that he will carry most of the protectionist votes with him, but in any case the upholders of this fiscal creed are by no means numerous enough to get their man in against the undivided vote of the freetraders. The most peculiar feature of this whole contest is that the Labour Electoral League, an organisation supposed to be composed ot workers and run entirely in their interests, is actually backing a University man, a B.A., too, as its chosen representative. Truly the changes and chances of political life are wonderful, and a few years ago no man would have had the ghost 0f a chance as a labour candidate unless he could produce a pair of toil-worn hands, and could wear moleskins and smoke a short clay pipe is to the manner born. But to-day we have changed all this and it seems as though the working classes are beginning to recognise the great advantage which education gives a member of Parliament. So they have chosen a man of high attainments who follows the occupation of a university coach, and we can only commend their choice FREETRADE CANDIDATES A meeting of tho Freetrade Council was held y99tardayatWentwo-th cour* Mi G H Beidwasl in th j chair and there wa3 j. good attendance rho bo-moss und» consideration waa the nom notion of freetrudo cat didatos tor u varions elections, lu many instances the inquiries and arbijra* ous ara still proceeding and tho re-mi's ara not jot avatlabl" but *&8 following li t wes dec dod ui on - Ballina, Tames 3arr r iba Bar von T T Macha'tio Bingara *> A looro Bon x1 \\\ M Court J-.u~wooa V illiam M Millan Cam lou Dr W P Cullen Cobar "\ eil Morrison PAT) nglon W H Manuell L len Bomba!
