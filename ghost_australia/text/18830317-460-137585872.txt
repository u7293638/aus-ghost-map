THE CONTRIBUTOR | WIGGINS* 8T0BH. BT AH BOLNNE. It wonld not be well to let the etom pre diction of " Professor E. Stone Wiggioi, LL.D., Astronomer to the Canadian Fining Department," pass oat ol mind witfcoa giving some little attention to the leacs to got oat of the affair. The incident don to pat a finger on the innermost poise o: public mind in a war we hare thj hI. dom an opportunity of doing. It penmc e3 eee what unmeasured depths of credali? exist in the minds of the people we met; every day, the ignorant and the edncsted, the doll and the ehrewd alike. Thecseeisthu newspaper paragraph appears mentioning that Profeesor Wiggins, of Canada, hu pre dicted that a etorm of unprecedented violuia would rage on the 9th to 11th of thgnocits. grounoB are assigned for the presage. Tie name of Wiggins carries no authority, asiti> quite unknown to scientific men. For whit know, Wiggins's information vis void> esfed to him in a dream, or by spirit sgeocr. Possibly there is no Wiggins, and the *hok affair may be a hoax, as, indeed, TTi&its;'t description of bis official position voatt mm to indicate. Wiggins may be merely making philosophical experiment on the guliibuitj mankind. Or, finally, be may be a lunatic, makes no difference. The predict*® generally believed merely because it wu t prediction, and a prediction of calaniitj. It W8B accepted in various degrees by people cl kinds and classes. In this colony the oo venment gave the matter official recognition formally oonBolting the Government as tronomer on the subject.

We we Sronted every day by instances of behefs which are received without question by whole SSe of minds, and rejected equally without nation by others. How u it that the Sea of Lourdes and the supernatural K itionB of Knock are believed without Sulty by Roman Catholics and rejected in an equally summary manner by Pro testants ' Is it owing to any different canons nf loeic. or different way of testing evidence in the two classes? Not at all. In matters of science, or of everyday life, their methods of inference are exactly tbe same. If they sit side by side as jurymen listening to legal evidence, and deciding on a verdict, there is no claBS difference at all be tween them. How is it, then, that what theone regards bb demonstrated miracle the other eieffBaBobviousillusionorimposture? Clearly Jjecauee the minds of the two are disposed by the influence of sentiments outside the mere ieBFonin£ powers to take just those re* ipective views, and no others. Let me advert to two or three other matters of illnstration, soliciting the reader's patience meanwhile till I endeavour to show their incidence on the matter in band. There iia9 been lately established in England an association of ingenious and ingenuous persons calling themselves tbe Psychical So ciety. Their purpose is the investigation of jhoet stories, I might say the cultivation of ghost etorieB. In reference to thia society and its work, an ably written London paper took occasion to give the warning that the business had its dangers, ana that with the hereditary tendency to superstitions fcelief still so rooted in ns, and so imperfectly eradicated by the teachings of a generation or two of scientific enlightenment, it was tetter and safer to let these beliefs die out untouched than to incur tbe peril of handling them, 1 think that advice very sound ana vise. Many of us have seen within onr own experience cases of men of ability and educa* cation undertaking, merely, as they said, for purposes of scientific investigation, to ex amine the phenomena of spiritualism, with the result of their minds becoming fascinated ta by a sort of spell, and ending by becoming . «ednloQ8 believers in the silliest fables and the most impudent impostures. Clearly it would have been better for them to have kept clear from an influence which fastened on the hereditary streak of superstition in their nature, and led them to believe in table* rapping marvels in exactly the B&me; way in much their ancestors 200 years ago believed iu witchcraft But though the advice was so sound and prudent it was assailed by a repre sentative ot the society in question, who characterised it as shrinking from investiga tion, as ignoring evidence, and as akin to %ions intolerance.

The apprehension felt of WigginB's storm is identical ia kind with the terror inspired by the rain-maker of an African tribe, who threatens to withhold all rain unless his supply of yams and ponibi ia more liberally furnished. It ia always humiliating to find how thin in places ia the rind of civilisation over the latent supersti tions transmitted to as from primitive man. And I fear that this experience has been characteristically brought home to us by the incident of Wiggins's storm.
