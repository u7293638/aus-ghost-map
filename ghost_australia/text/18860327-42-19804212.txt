The Storyteller. The Ghost of Fullerton's Paddock. [WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.] BY J. F. THE little Victorian township of Y- was, five-and-twenty years ago, one of the most isolated in that colony. Situated in the heart of the bush, Y-was but indifferently pro- vided with roads; consequently communication • between it and the outaide world wm of the moat limited kind. Certain rough tracks through the scrub, however, served to connect the place with Ballarat, from which it received its supplies, together with the weekly mail and Melbourne newspapers. The principal buildings in the township were the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic churches and the general store. The supporters of the rival creeds had erected their sanctuaries within a stone's throw of each other, so, when Thomas Suther, the Presbyterian church officer, set the kirk bell a-danging, Pat Doolan, the Catholic beadle, was sure to reply to what he considered as a challenge by ringing the Roman congregation in to mass with such a clatter that douce Thomas was wont to aver " the sound o' that Popish bell made his ears crack." Suther was a middle-aged "Glasgow body;" his rival Doolan a septuagenarian Waterford "boy." who cocked his hat as know ingly, and flourished his shillalah as briskly, as the stoutest larrikin in the township. The store was over against the kirk, and its veranda constituted the favourite lounge of the inhabitants of T . Here it was Suther and Doolan carried on their interminable disputes anent the infallibility of the Pope; and here also the storekeeper—Samuel Splutter by name—was usually to be seen of an evening, his spare figure girt with a spotless white apron, his sly green eyes twinkling as he listened to the jokes of the neighbours, or the wordy warfare between the Scot and Hibernian. Elder Splutter, as he was usually designated from the fact of his being an office-bearer in the kirk, was a Londoner by birth. He had come to Victoria during* the height of the gold fever of '63, but, his health giving way at the diggings, had wisely abandoned the pursuit of mining for that of storekeeping. Popular opinion asserted Splutter to be a " warm" man. Moreover, he was a bachelor, and, in the esti {nation of the widows and maidens of V , personable enough considering his years, which were on the shady side of fifty. His shop was a two-story brick building, the lower part of which was devoted to business. In it were arranged his wares. The post-office, too, occupied a niche in the store, for Splutter combined the avocation of postmaster with his other duties. The upper flat contained a living-room and two bedrooms, and here Miss Hephsibah, the storekeeper's elderly sister, reigned supreme. Miss Splutter, her friends said, had along tongue and a tart temper; but, to give her her due, her bark was worse than her bite, and the Rev. Casar Oxeye, the Pres byterian minister, emphatically pronounced her to be "a vary worthy lady." Mr. Ozeye's tiny manse was but a few minutes' walk from the store, and the reverend gentleman, who, like his elder, was a bachelor, often dropped in of an evening at the Splutters', ostensibly to disouss church matters; but pos sibly the dainties that were pressed upon him by Miss Hephribah—whose culinary successes were the envy of her neighbours—may have had something to say to his frequent visits, the minister being, as he frankly admitted, fond of toothsome dishes. The Rev. Casar Oxeye believed himself to be a martyr. He had left the kirk of his fathers at the Disruption of 1813, when the evangelical party in the Church of Scotland separated from the moderate faction, and established itself into an independent body yclept the Free Church. But, unfortunately for our friend, his congregation did not follow his example, and Mr. Oxeye, finding the position of a shepherd minus his flock, however honourable it might be to him as a sufferer for conscience' sake, anything but remunerative, shook the dust from his feet as a testimony against his faithless congregation, and em barked for Melbourne, folly intending to devote his life to the conversion of the aborigines. His mission to the blacks was, however, a failure, and, after much buffeting by an evil world, the divine at length settled at V , where he intended—so he intimated—to spend the remnant of his days. Notwithstanding the reverses he had experi enced Mr.Oxeyewasaplumprosy old gentleman, and, as has already been tainted, keenly alive to his creature comforts. Indeed the gossips of the township affirmed that, if ever the minister committed matrimony, the sacrifice of his freedom would be made for the pru dential motive of securing for himself in perpetuity a competent housekeeper and notable cook; nor did they fail to Insinuate that, although Miss Splutter was vinegar and cayenne pepper to the rest of the world, to her pastor she was all sweetness and deference. They therefore suspected Miss Hepbzibah of setting her cap at the minister. Now Samuel Splutter's store, notwithstanding it boasted a broad white signboard bearing the name of the proprietor in flaming red letters, exhibited no exterior advertisement of the multifarious articles sold within; and the absence «f such had for some time been a source of secret annoyance to the elder. How ever, he did not confide his trouble to anybody, but pondered it in his own bosom with a view to evolving a suitable advertisement of his wares, to bo printed on the board directly below his own name. After much deliberation he at last decided on the form the notice should take; and one bright December day found him busily engaged in painting it up. The cottntensmce of tfce storekeeper w©r« » mysteriously benevolent expression atf, pttttted on a tall stool, h6 osed1 hib brtab wKft a masterly hand. He looleA like a man who, having originated a great idea, sad generously resolved on making the world free 6f it. Whether the little knot of idlers loitering about the store were impressed by the POT* tentous good-will shadowed forth on the elder s face we do not presume to »ay, but it is certainly on record that a murmur of applause greeted him on the successful completion of the first few words of his advertisement. "Yon done it litigant, Misther Splatter!" cried Fat Doolan, who, with eyes screwed up and chin in air, critically regarded the store keeper's work. "Ye should reserve you* Judgment till ye see the end o't, man/ remarked Thomas Sutber, glancing somewhat dispangiftgly at the signboard. " What's that you're OttfAft Thomas f asked Mr. Oxeye, who came bustling op at this moment  , "Saving your presence," quoth Doolan. knuckling his forehead to the minister, and glancing vindictively at Suther, " it's an in spiration (aspersion?) he's after casting on this good gintleman's handiwork." "Fie, Thomas, fie! slander not your neighbour," said the pastor, shaking his finger reprovingly at his beadle; but there was a twinkle in his eye as he turned to the store* keeper and complimented him on the exactness of his letters. "It's rather neat, though I say it as shouldn't," Samuel assented, complacently sur veying his work. 41 Sugar and spice," read the minister through his gold- rimmed spectacles: "very dpropoa indeed; very much so. Hay I ask what follows, Mr. Splutter r " Well, to tell you the truth, I'd rather you didn't," returned Samuel, dipping his brush into the pot and applying it to the board. "But if you'll step round at 5 and drink a dish of tea with us you will then perhaps see the Jund of it" And the elder directed a scornful glance at douce Thomas. "Very good, very good," acquiesced Mr. Oxeye, rubbing his hands; " I shall not fail to join you at the hour you mention." And nodding in a friendly manner to the bystanders thi* reverend gentleman trotted off to his 1 o'clock dinner, leaving Mr. Splutter toiling manfully at his task. Precisely at ten minutes to 6 the minister emerged from the manse door dressed in his best black suit and stiffest cravat On his arrival at the store be was surprised to recog nise as the centre of a hilarious group of villagers there assembled the burly form of Father O'Reilly, the jovial priest of the district "Good evening, Mr. Oxeye," quoth his reverence, with a low bow. "You have come like the rest of us, I presume, to admire the inimitable advertisement of your talented elder." This was said gravely enough, but there was that in his tone which convinced his brother divine that the priest was laughing at him. " Unregenerate man," muttered Mr. Oxeye. Aloud he said, and there was severity in his accents: " Ah! yes, Mr. Splutter is indeed an original thinker, and I am pleased to see that you, sir, are liberal enough to acknowledge the merit of one whom you do not hesitate to brand with the reproachful name of schismatic." While speaking, the minister had been fum bling for his spectacles. Having found them, he settled the glasses on his little snub nose, cleared his throat, and read aloud from the signboard—"Sugar and Spice and all things nice. Tin- basins, Corkscrews, Mouse-traps, Epsom salts, and other Groceries." "Very poetical and appropriate, very much so," commented Mr. Oxeye, checking an in* dination to smile, and eyeing the priest austerely. " Just what I should have expected from a man of Mr. Splutter's abilities." " What was you afther sayin', sir, concernin' Misther Splutter's soliloquies?" queried Pat Doolan, rather mystified by the minister's lan- K<*«f!e says, Pat," Father O'Reilly explained, "that his elder's soliloquy"—here the priest in dicated the advertisement—" is worthy of him." " Musha, but he's right; it's an iUigant soli loquy intoirely," cried Doolan enthusiastically. The minister darted an angry look at the father, but without vouchsafing a rejoinder, passed into the shop, where he found Mr. Splutter behind the counter, a self-satisfied smile on his commonplace face. It was evi dent he expected a word of commendation from his pastor relative to his day's work, nor was he disappointed: for, after the usual interchange of civilities, Mr. Oxeye assured his elder that he had been extremely happy in the wording of his advertisement. "I am glad you think so, sir," replied Samuel. " For, to tell you the truth, I was terribly worrited before I happened on them words." " Samuel!" cried a shrill voice from above, 41 is Mr. Oxeye there ?' "Coming, Hephzy, coming!" shouted her brother, and, leaving the boy in charge of the shop, he conducted the minister upntairs, ushering him into the parlour where tea was laid, and where Miss Splutter sat in state, arrayed in a pea-green moire antique and smart lace cap, trimmed with crimson ribands. Miss Hephzibah resembled her brother in form and features, but her temper was all her own. Not a vestige of the shrew was visible on her counte nance, however, as she rose to greet Mr. Oxeye, and the trio were soon seated at table dis cussing a very appetising "high tea." The minister did justice to the fare. He had a judicious word of praise for each dish. Nor did he forget to assist his hostess by gallantly filling the tea-pot and passing the cups. The meal over, the elder produced a pack of cards, and the friends began a solemn game of wbist, in which Mr. Oxeye and Miss Splutter were partners, Samuel taking dummy. The exit of the storekeeper who was summoned downstairs to wait upon a customer, while it interrupted the game, was by no means displeasing to the minister, as it afforded him an opportunity of discoursing on his favourite topic, the culinary art, and he had just piously remarked that he wished Providence had blessed him with a sister distinguished like bis hostess for house wifely qualities, when the door which had lately closed on Samuel was noisily opened, and in bounced Mrs. Jawkias, a buxom widow of mature charms, followed by the elder, look ing sheepish and uncomfortable. Now Miss Splutter suspected Mrs. Jawkins of matrimonial design* on her brother, and hated her accordingly; uor would Samuel, despite his admiration for her exuberant charms, have dared to invite the widow into his house, aware a> he was of his stoWs hostility towards her, had not the present «* **« minister emboldened him to do so. , .

"That there is a designing minx with her cock and buU ghost story,* Miss Hephzibah acri moniously remarked on the disappearance of the pair. " She is certainly not my ideal of a Christian female," softly said her pastor, and he looked unutterable tbiqgs.
