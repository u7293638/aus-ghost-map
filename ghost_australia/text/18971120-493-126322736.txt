the church's stkonc. foundation. We have no fear that tlie church of God ?will be exterminated. We would call to re membrance the years of the right hand of the Most High. We would recollect there was once a time when the whole church of Christ not only could be, but actually was, gathered with one accord in one place. It was then that that place was shaken as with a rushing, mighty wind, and tney were all filled with the Holy Ghost. That same day 3,000 were added to the Lord. Soon we hear they have filled Jerusalem with their doctrine. The church has commenced her march. Samaria Las with one accord believed the Gospel. Antioch has become obedient to the faith. The name of Ohi'ist has been proclaimed throughout Asia Minor. The temples of the gods, as though smitten by an invisible hand, are deserted. The citizens of Ephesus cry out in despair, ' Great is Diana of tbe Ephes ians !' Licentious Corinth is purified by the preaching of Christ crucified. Persecution puts forth her arm to arrest the spreading ' superstition.' But the progress of the faith cannot be stayed. The church of God advances nnhnrt, amidst rocks and dungeons, persecutions and death ; yea, ' smiles at the drawn dagger, and defies its point.'
