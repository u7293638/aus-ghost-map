Ar the time of-dir1 qaéne^ttîng-4 inania, in 1877, when pigtails, it was al|ege|< were mysteriously, cut off ..by. unseen agencies, and a " wave of dread spread over the sition," twp respectable hard-working men living in Kiukiang were impeached by their neighbors for ' being the emissaries of the' evil onie who^.w^. guilty of the crime. The med were tried before the magistrate, and~so::great "were the tortures ta .which they wert Subjected that in «fir: agony they confessed that; the charge was true. They had¿ they said, \- putout pjipei: representations ,',pfí¡ ?ecíssórs^which they then burntiitídéolj distributed aa,a spirit over the land,!j and thu was the mysterious agency by; whñh th»,, pigtails were ' separated., "This 'i avowal was accepted by- the magistrate, and : the men,, were led. away to death. Á friend of raine jknew.the men well,, and, was. told of the trial by eye-witnesses ;.. ha jsûbse ¿?ouently saw the two heads hanging by their pigtails from bamboo poles at one of the city gates, while a written legend below eacb gave details of thé crime of which the two men had been -found guilty on their own confessions. But it ié.noç tbe prisoner only who '^shuns the' painted portals of the ^magistrate's. yamen as he would the gates of hell," but the witnesses also^ -and the " dread of being called as a -r,witness, is second only, to .that,.of Ä bong arrested aa a culprit." ;.: - ' ' The Chinese court assumes that the prisoner at the bar is guilty ; so does < -the, court assume that the witnesses ¿j are lying unless they give evidence ^ which fits the case from the point, of -<vriew of : the prosecution. It /.rogar is the bamboo and the hot chain, the ?-rack-and the heated' pincers as power s^fu) -factors in eliciting1 truthful evi t pjdenoe. The more quick witted'the ^fwitness the less then will he suffer,, for the more speedily fae will discover n^what is ethe evidence which the court requires of him, and then he "lies equal to the occasion." -Unlike a European, a Chinese has 'three'souls, which after the death of ^Ijuis body go to reside, one in the grève, another in the ancestral tablet, and a_ T^tbird ia the world beyond the grave. \--..tTalike,. too, some of the western '^.ttatioas, the Chinese have an over- mastering passion to have children. More jbhan death itself the Chinese \- fears to dia without leaving male, -".progeny to worship at his shrine. ^'/Heaven is but a repetition of earth, :> and the spirits in heaven depend for v.'.the comfort of their being upon the '-\ Support of their decendanti Ott earth. ^Anything can be sent to the other /¿ world . .by simply burning a paper" ^representation of it in this. To send :f «Boney-to your ancestor in heaven you need but burn some gilt paper or "paper imitations of money before His ," shrine here ; to send him a horse you 7'burn him\a paper horse, to provide ,. him with a richly-furnished house you ' burn a paper imitation house here, and ? i so on, bet with regard to food there j is this difference : to send your ancestor > [ food : you piously.. offer food,. at his \- shrine, and before it. gets cold ' you eat it yourself-you get the substance, he is regaled with the ' spiritual essence. If a man dies without ;:f male progeny he leaves behind bim no provision for his support in heaven, t. -but wanders there a u hungry ghost," forlorn and forsaken. A man appears in the other world in the garb and in the position which he occupied when he forsook this. If decapitated, he appears headless unless his friends have pieced the head or a paper re- presentation of it back on to the trunk. Jfrhe has suffered death by the Ling r or slow process, which necessitated his "being cut into a number of pieces, he cannot, as a missionary said to me, lie out the'thing in heaven and pro- test that he came there properly when" \- j.vhe fcarries with him suah - damning ' 'évidence - to the ? contrary. It is this conception of the future state, being butta repetition of our present condi- tion, that makes the form of Chinese oath employed in our consular courts ia China so binding upon men who lie " because it is their nature to." On a v i -sheet of yellow paper are written the ? - » -characters which the witness reads .aloud, and which declare, "I swear u ,-before heaven to tell the truth, the ^ .. ;*hole truth, and nothing but the ;**»tnl and may heaven reject me or (have no use for m¿) if I do. not." _He then burns the paper, and if he Lr.. . lies it will be produced as evidence ? i- against him in heaven. - r \ An Englishman whom necessity T?CT-rompéis to wear spectacles would on '} .' .entering a Chinese house put on his V spectacle« and take off his hat ; his short-sighted host would receive him: J°y patting on bis hat and taking off " - 'his spectacles. A polite (innaman \- even takes off his spectacles when he bows to you. A Chinaman never ^ ' snakes hands with yon ; he stands before you and shakes hands with " ' ' "himself, and " the higher he raises his grasped hands the greater is the honor <wbieh te withes to show you." . ria. v A-'Chinese, clerk makes out ; his y. . .account in the«verse way to ours,' for, " >be states the . prices before, the goods ^iand the goody before the quantities. «^Äe. keeps his debit and créait accounts, not on opposite pages Of his ledger,'but -on the same page, and in his fractions he uses the numerator for the denomi- nator and the denominator for j the numerator, and if he wishes to express three-fourths he writes four-thirds. Tn giving a date he gives it inj the .^opposite order to ours, for he says that ' the event occurred in the reign of such \y^an emperor, in such a year, in the . ' irionth of so and so, on a certain day, and, if it has to be stated, at a particu ' Ur hour. The address on the envolope \- he writes in the inverse order in which it would be written by us, for he writes , the<name of the country first, and the name of the addressee last, and if ie is an official he is writing to he is careful to put his official titles before his name and not after, as would the Euopein.
