Not Proud of lier Countryman. Sam Jones, o£ Gold Hill, who dearly loves a joke, has a domestic in his house who is a countrywoman of Sullivan. The other morn ing he and Evan Williams were eating break fast, when, by a preconcerted agreement, they began a dialogue something like this, Sam leading off— " Curious, ain't it, that Sullivan took water from that Dutchman ? " " YeB, indeed; I was quite astonished. He seemed perfectly cowed." " Well, I don't blame him. Hans is a big man and strong as a bull, and I guess he can lick any two men in the world, John in cluded." " Phat's that, Mister Jones ? " broke in the domestic, who had been hovering about the table, " a Dutchman lick John Sullivan! Are yez crazy or dreaming, Mister Jones ? " " It's a fact," said Williams. " Hans Meyer, forman of the No. 2 crosscut, Crown Point, deposited 500 dols. forfeit to meet Sullivan, and when he saw our man he weak ened and let the money slide." The domestic dropped a china plate oa the floor, and stood speechless. " He breaks aU. hia rock with his fist," broke in Sam, " and runs the steam drill by hand. We pay him 12 dols. a day just lot the steam he saves. Sullivaa happened to come in when he was making birdseye porphyry with his fist, and I'm blamed if he didn't turn pale as a ghost." " Mr. Jones, if Mr. Evan Williams says this I'd belave him, but as you say so it wouldn't go. There must be some mishtaka about his bein' a Dutchman." " He is a Dutchman," said Williams, gravely, " or else I don't know a Dutchman wnen I see him." "Thin, gintlemen," replied the domestic, drawing herself up a couple of inches higher, " all I've got to say is that John L. Sullivan's no Irishman, and don't spake of him as one in my prisence. - —Carson (Nev.j Appeal.
