The churchyard where she slumbers J Sfre tender pressure of a vanished hand. The broken chain that time must further sever, The merry laughter of the childish bond, The voices hushed forever. 8 trains of sad music from a far ofl shore— Mute memories those that woo with soft caresses, And tincc with sacred radlanoe evermore Life's lonely wildernesses.
