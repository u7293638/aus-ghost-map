The first was- a cage of a youth* who had been -petted and pampered by ah over-indulgent mother. He received, the too common college education \vhich. re sulted iti .his having acquired no know lodge of any kind, stive on the* subject of dress, lii this respect he thought he was an adept... Without ituy knowlede of busi ness he-made his 'start in life wittr a good firm. Here he had every chance to make' a man of himseU. to acquire -useful and vulu^ble-business habits aiid knowledge, ami to work his way up in the world. The drawback to Ins success consisted in bis great' admiration for himself and for the one or more girls whom he condesc ended to patronise! Pnrt of his ofllce hours would t»e occupied in corresponding with thetn, and another part in .obtaining the much needed re3t of which he deprived himself at night, for this youth was a man abouc town,' a habitue of leading hotels and a lounscr. at the baf3. Of course such habits could* not confor.n t«- those re quired bv a boy in business. He lived in a fashionable boarding house at the. ex- pense of his parents, ao his little salary was his pocket money. But it can be readily imagined that this did .not suffice for such a spark, and lie .was sooti in the habit of borrowing from his fellow, clerks. .His want of 'sleep by night madejiim stupid by day. and of course he, oftieially, proved a failure. ? His memory was like a. sieve and he /.vas practically useless. Finailv iie associated with sports,, and ! then the dowMifall ^ti«v. more rapid.- Jle | remained away frontMiis office for a week | cr two without ? permission, and as a | natural sequence, lie' remained away'for j ever. }?o-v what will' beeonie of this youtii ?
