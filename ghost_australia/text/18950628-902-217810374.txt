DRESS REFORM. The Prussian Government is seriously con sidering the advisability of issuing a decree forbidding women to wear trains on the public promenades. It is claimed that these street-sweeping appendages stir up the dust and scatter far and wide the germs of disease, with which it is alleged to be filled. The police of Meran, the fashionable watering place in the Tyrol, recently made such an order, with the result that the bacteria cranks and dress-reform faddists in several localities are calling for its imitation. The Prussian House of Deputies enjoys the distinction of being the only legislative body to drop minor subjects, such as the budget, agricultural depression, etc. , and to take up this momentous one of- tho wearing of trains by women. From beginning to end, tbe Teutonic states men treated the subject with great serious ness, and not so much as the ghost of a joke marred the debate. Soon we expect to hear from some learned crank that bacteria lodge in the hair, and that both males and females should be compelled by law to keep their heads shayed.
