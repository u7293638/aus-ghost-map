TO THE EDXTOE. Sir-I have noticed that the Government have called for volunteers for the defence of the : colony; and while having faith in the patriotism of my fellow-colonists, I would ask what pos ; sible use the enrolment of alotof cavalry,infantry, &c.;, can be when the only enemy at all likely to appear is a well-armed privateer. With very great diffidence I would suggest that if an English man-of-war t»f decent armament were stationed somewhere in Gulf .St. Vincent, we conld buy and «e11 and get gain in perfect secuity. I should like also ask whether the South Aus tralian Government has communicated with the Imperial Government asking for protection, and in the words of the immortal Strangways, " If not why not ?" If the services of an ironclad were asked for and the expenses of her maintenance were guaranteed by South Australia, I presume there is little question but that one could -be obtained. I also note the Amoor wire is interrupted; how long will our connecting cable 'be likely to be of any use to us ? "A .word to the wise," &c.; I do most sincerely trust that instead of, or at least as well as, the usual amount -of rot - and bunkum on these occasions something really practical may be done, and done qrackly, too. I am anxious to be a member of an artillery corps for the defence of the colony, but hesitate to send in my name, being tolerably -well satis fied that my services in loading a gun will never be called into requisition, as, though I am only 45, my allotted space will have expired long before there is a ghost of . a gnu to experi ment upon, or at any rate that the conflict now looming in the distance will before then be a thing of the past. I am, Sir, &c.;, GRANITE ISLAND. [If our correspondent Is sincere in depretjating what he is pleased to call " rot «ed backum' why did he write this letter ?-Bo.]
