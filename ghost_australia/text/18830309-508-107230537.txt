\\[) MY'Ii__iDY'S PliOT;! ;. ' - ' ? . ? OB, THB €B_ost of Diavolo Castle. CHAPTES XXXVL— fcoNTmuED.'J Without reply be advanced, and sorrowfully ? ient liis assistance in removing the glass cover 'which the unhappy i^an had already loosened ; with his knife. It proved to be an easy task, the cement in *w_ic_ it had been carefully imbedded .having . , -broken away during the journey from London to : 'Beauchamp Vault. \- - For an instant after 'the removal of the glass both men stood in silent, reverent contemplation1 of the beautiful sleeping face. As yet Time had left no marring sign- upon the features. They showed through the long tulle ; .veil that swept from the flower-crowned head to the dainty feet, as unstained as the day the coffin had iid shut them from human sight. Doctor Jeffries moved sadly away, and, with his bask turned upon the scene, once more ?stood ?waiting with folded arms and drooping breast. t With, a stifled groan Norman Devereu_ gently drew aside the Veiling tulle. \- ' Your sweet dead face could never shock me, ? -A^, sainted love !' he whispered, chokingly. As he spoke he bent, and taking the placidly folded hands in his passionately pressed then! to ids lips. Scarcely had he done so when he uttered a loud, horrified ejaculation. With that ejaculation he started back, glaring at the coffia- with the eye of a maniac. Doctor Je_ries rushed to his side. ? What is it, Devereux ? Wnat is it ?' he gasped. . Making no reply, apparently dear to the ques tion, .Nbrinan dashed 'to the coffin again and gently but swiftly passed both iiands over 'the | ? lovely face. | A second cry broke from his lips — a cry loud, Bavage, and vindictive. ' Great heavens ! Le Ima gone mad !' faltered the doctor, speaking aloud in his profound ' Mad !' echoed Uorman Devereux, turning his white face and burning eyes upon the old man for a moment. Uttering that one fiercely-mocking word 'he turned away again, seized the recumbent form, and with a. niisrhty effort, jerked it from the cofii_. Doctor Jeffries's ' voieo now rose in a feeble, ?wavering cry of hopeless consternation and despair. As heedless of the doctor's cry as lie had been. of his first anxious question, Norman Uevereux . held the ghastly form towards him. i ' Look at it 2' he shouted, hoarsely. ' Look at j it ! a creature of wax, kid, wood, cotton and ! wire 1 No ! no !' he hurried on, as the doctor { staggered back in increased terror. ' I am. not mad 1 See the long wires which have secured it tG that infernal box I Oh ! she is alive ! She is alive ! My darling is alive !' That glad cry, ringing out upon the death-like stillness, penetrated to another ear — tlie ear of Lucy. Seated in sad, patient waiting upon the steps of the towering pulpit oi the old church, she caught the words, and. in a moment was flying down the steps leading from the cnancel to tlie ( vault. She broke upon the scene with streaming- eyes outstretched hands, and echoing voice. ' ' Alive ! Alive !' eke screamed. ' Where is she ? Give her to me ! my precious baby ! my sw-»et you^g mistress !' Surprising as Lucy's appearance would have proved to both Doctor Jeffries and Norman DevereTix a few minutes earlier, at this moment . of excitement it astonished neither. Norman, who had just succeeded in bringing Doctor Jeffries to _ full comprehension of the fraud, tossed the wax image back into the coffin and answered her. ? She is not here ?' he cried* his voice ringing ?with mingled joy and anger. * But — ' * Not here !* screamed Lucy, rushing to *t_e ' * coffin. * Where ie one, then ?* - 'Where, indeed!5 echoed 'Doctor Jeffries, ' shiveringly. Before he could say more an avTful shriek broke ' from Lucy. 'O-o-h! It's nothing but wax,' she cried, wildly. ? ? 'With that cry slie turned from the coffin and seized Doctor Jeffries by the arm. ' What has that fiend done with my baby ?' she ' screamed. ' Oh, would that I could know her safe inlier coffin. Oh, where is she ? Where is she?' In her agony she loosed her grasp, aud wrung her hands frantically together. 'She is alive, Lucy/ soothed Norman DevereruE, } his mind clinging tenaciously to that one ghn ? thought, ' and I shall find her.* _Alive, and in that creature's power !' screamed « Lucy, f rantical !y as before. , ? What creature ? What do you mean ?' panted Norman Devereux. - ' There was a new tone in the young officer's voice as he jvut. those hurried questions — a tone of angaished doubt and terror $_at sharpened it *to ihe sound of anger. But Doctor Jeffries sadly interposed upon the .. reply. . ' Don't encourage false hopes/ he said, address ing Norman Devereu-. * She is dead. Her body has been stolen, aud you can only too easily co_ .ceive for wluit purpose. It is a horrible thought, ? but — ' , . Up to this point Norman Devereux had stood ? listening in an appalled silence. He now burst out, half fiercely, half mockingly : * And Doctor AlHnglm.ni guarding, the coffin sight and day. So fcir Egbert, told me/ At those words Doctor Jeffries stared.^4- him aghast, and faltered : '. 'Can Alling-haru have committed the crime ?' Norman Devereux suddenly flung up Ms right arm. ? All the sinister enormity of , the fraud breaking upon him iu one moment, he thundered . fiercely, vehemently : 'By the beav«as above us, AUingham shall answer for this to me ! The fraud is 5ns., and for some monstrous purpose. The — * ? ,Lucy passionately broke in upon hint. ' If/ she cried — ' if the Allingtams are friends ? ef Lady Beauc&imp;, they are all together in the .plot-' ' ? ?- , ? ? * Lady Beauchamp ! .

''It is- to her ifly poor darling is indebted for all her ill health and ..all her so-called* madness. It is her wicked, dreadful plot that brought that coffin here. If \- you' don't believe me, I'll prove it.' - ?'- WIthtliose breathless words she jerked from ? her pocket tha bottle so painfully abstracted 'from Nina's cabinet. She thrust it into Poctor JettTies's hands ?? *.T— ere if B_e cried. * That is my lady's work. Take that to the chemist that compounded it, and / : see/what h» will Bay. I haven't dared, but you lean do it. But, without tho ehomisfc, I know a . tcaspoonf ul of it will kill a kitten.' ' Never ' exclaimed the doctor, recognising the .'bottle on th» instant.
