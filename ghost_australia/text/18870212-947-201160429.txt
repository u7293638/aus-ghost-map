Those two years of sus pense and silence have been terrible to her — worse than she even knowB herself. No wonder she looked as she did when she came !'

Agatha had gone to her room, and the other two were alone in the drawing-room. 1 ' I suppose I must tell Mark when I write,' she said after a pause, as the young man remained silent. Mrs. Slade had been shocked beyond measure. Foolish as a penniless marriage would have been for Mark under existing circumstances, she felt that she would rather that it had taken place than feel the infamy of his conduct as it was. For she 'knew Mark Hylton too well not to under stand wnac wouia nave Deen me euu oi 'the deception he had practised on the 'girl. The strong affection ahe was begin ning to feel for Agatha made the poBsv. ibility all the more dreadful. The girl i would have left the house, that very even ;ing, but she would not let her go.

' I think I would rather not to-day,' she said, a faint appeal in her voice. He understood the hesitation; and he looked angry. But the vexation passed quickly. .
