THE CYCLORAMA. The introduction of new features in the ' entertainment given at the Cyolotama has caused thiB already attractive resort) to become still more popular, arid the attendance on Tuesday evening was very large. The picture of the ' Battle of Waterloo' gains fresh inte rest with every inspection, and the illustrative Ieoture by Mr. Lockley intensifies the pleasure of theonlookersin a marked degree. In additdori to the illusion, the ghost of Napoleon, whioh is nightly on view, a novel and decidedly pretty feature has been added under the 'some- what alarming title 'HydatapikUnmina,'or the enchanted fountains of laughing waters. This consists of a fountain which throws 500 jets to the height of 50 and 60 ft, the altitude of the water constantly changing and assum ing new shapes, whioh with the addition of colored lights has an indescribably beautiful- . effect. The Cyclorama has hitherto amply! repaid a visit, out with the additional attrac tions now offered there is little doubt that it will be still more extensively patronised in the future.
