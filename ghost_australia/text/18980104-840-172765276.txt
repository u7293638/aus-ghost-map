The Fair Little Maiden. " There is ono at tho door, Wolfe O'Driscoll, At tlio door, who ia bidding you eomo 1" " Who ia ho that wakes mo in the durkuess, Calling when all the world's dumb " Six liorses has lio to his ourrhigo, Six horses blacker than tho night, And thoir twolvo red eyes in the shadows Twelve lamps lie carries for hin light ; " And bis coaoli is a coffin black aud mouldy, A lingo blaok coffin open wido : Ho asks for your soul, Wolfe O'Driscoll, Who is culling at the door outside." " Wlio let him thro' tho gates of my gardens, Whore stronger bolts have never boon ?" " 'Twns the father of tho fair little maiden You drove to her grave so groan." " And who jet him pass thro' tlio courtyard, By looBoniug the bar and tho chain ?'' " Oh, who but tho brothor of tho maiden, Who lies in tho cold uud the rain 1" " Then who drew tho bolta at tho portal, And into my honso bade him go?" " She, tho mother of tho poor young muiden Who lios iu her youth su low." " Who stands, that he dure not enter The door of my chamber, botwoonP." ; " Oil, tho ghost of tho fair little maidoii, Who lies iu the churchyard green." â€”Clement Shorter.
