' MUNICIPAL MATTERS. As time draws oil towards nomination day thQovarlous" aspirants lo municipal honours ore beginning to look around them in ear nest. .Already tlie field is 'fairly, full,- and as a', whole there are few coming out on tlie an cient ticket, ..now obscured by a new order of imngs. in" fact, all recognise tlie trutn or J the : statement- that there .Is a necessity for immediate reform, and not .only reform gene rally, bur a sweeping action. To adopt a halGhenrlod measure is suicidal, and whilst there are ninny undecided people hundy, ex hortations to wake -up before it is too late are being seriously considered. It would .be in deed n pity, after all the trouble tlmt lias been 'gone through to, secure a new condition of things, if these warnings passed unheeded, nnd whilst there are no fears absolutely en tertained that such will be the ease, still, as one .candidate put it, it would he as well to be careful. Sydney, snld another, "stinks In the nostrils of humanity," a statement which everybody who heard him did not believe, nor was it a popular assertion nt all,- until he qumllied It by contrast, nnd said It might be thfe "hoihe of the beautiful," ns well ns a city of .palaces and a Joy to all who abided there in. Whereupon, taking this as a personal al-. luslon to the comely appearance of the free and independent electors present, each one said, "hear, hear," hi a most determined manner, meaning, probably, "here, here." But there is a great deal in this sort of ora tory, for not only does It impress Itself upon the minds of .the electors, but it serves to pave the way to more serious statements'. The places of tho old parties who have con cluded pot to come forward any more, having duly acknowledged their defeat, are in some eases being filled, as far as candidature goes, by some going out on the independents' pro gramme, Two are in tlie field already, and aspire to the confidence of the 'electors, as much on a basis of past respectability as pro mises of future conduct. New blood Is occa sionally an acquisition in a body like that of the City Council, and a good many electors favour the Introduction of the new clement, although selected candidates of the Vigilance Committee and Reform Association, do not like lt-as:a -whole. The boys of the Old Bri gade neither like it nor dislike it, for having,: to speak commonly, the alternative of "lump ing it," are. It would sc-em, quite prepared to do so if the occasion arises, and give up -the ghost (the municipal ghost) Willi as much good grace- as is possible under circumstances over which they have no- control. -.There is a good deal of family Influence being exorcised In several places, and in soma of the wards there is such a network of com plicated relationship existing thnt voters are almost compelled ..to put one of a family In whether they like it or not. It Is not held generally as a drawback, but those who are determined upon- pushing for the new order of reform would on the whole prefer things not nearly so "mixed." But It. Is now neces sary to disturb the old order, arid dlBlurb It In a violent manner, quite In keeping with the determination of the new party. "What was good enough for my, father Is good enough for me,", is a saying now, .happily, being heard only Ire. circles. the most Ignorant, and, thanks to the enlightenment of education, It is a cry which will be soon heard no more. GIPPS WARD. There was a large crowd of persons as sembled lust evening at the Federation Hall to - hear Alderman R. G. Watkins, of Kent- street, and Mr. P, Nolan, of Prlnces-Btreet, speak on the subject of the municipal elec tions. Mr. Walter Ives presided.
