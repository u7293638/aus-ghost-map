It would bo wearisome to the reader to tell him how often I looked at my watch and thought of the precious hoars that were flying ; neither will I speak of my hopes and fears with regard to this idea of finding Kaffar's whereabouts by means of clairvoyance. Suffice it to say I was . in a state of feverish anxiety when we drove up to the professor's door that night, about half-past nine.- ^ ,i y. i'( ''V.'' -:'\ -.'?''''

He's got a piller, and he's stretchin' hisself on the seat and layin' his head on the piller- There, he's closed his eyes— he's off to sleepi' '?'?' The; professor turned to me. ',' I am afraid we oan do no more to-night,' he said. 'Evidently he is on a jonrney, and we must wait until he arrives at his destination.' ' But can't Slowden romain as he is and watch him?' ' The thing would be at once cruel and preposterous, sir. No, you must come again in the morning ; then, per chance, he will have finished his jour ney ;' and accordingly be proceeded to wake Simoii. After all, it did not matter so much. It was now ten o'clock, and I could do nothing that night, in any case. 'I do not know but that I am glad that things are as they are,' continued the professor, '? This second sleep' will enablo him to see more clearly to-morrow. Meanwhile consider yourself fortunate If the Egyptian stops anywhere in Italy it will be possible for you to reach him and bring him back within the time you mention. ; Tako - heart, my friend. Good- bye, for the time. I shall expeot you early to-morrow.' !No sooner were we in the street than Simon began to ask me what he had told me, for I found that be was entirely ignorant of the things he had said. ?^ Who'd 'a thought ? it ?' he said musingly, when I toldjhim.; 'Who'd 'a thought 'asi'ow I should bassist in a waccinatin' business like this 'ere. Tell 'eo, yer 'onour, I shall believe in ghosts and speerits again soon. Fancy me a seein' things in Italy and tellin' 'em to you without knovrih' anything about it ! Well, but 'twill be grand if we can find 'im, yer honour, won't it then ??'.. : I spent a sleepless nignt, harassed by a thousand doubts asd fears. There, in the quiet of my room, all this mesmerism and clairvoyance seemed only so much hocuB- poous, which no sensible and well educated man should haxe anything to do with. Still, it was my only hope, and it only wanted eight days for Christmas Eve. Only one little week and a day, that was all. and then, if I did not pro duce Kaffar, all was lost. It would be no use to go to Miss Forrest's house in Kensington and tell her that Simon Slowden hai, while in a mesmeric sleep, aeen Kaffar in Italy. No, no; that would never do, I must produce him, nothing else would suffice. We wero early at the professor's the following morning, and found him wait ing and almost as anxious as we were. Again Simon submitted to the in flaonce of the little man, and soon answered his questions far more rapidly tean he had hitherto done. Did he- soe Kaffar? 'Yes,' waa the reply. ' ? ' Where is he now 7 ' He was in a beautiful town. The houses were white, the streets were white ; the town was full of squares, and in theso squares were many statues. Such was Simon's information. ' Do you know what country the town ? is in?' ' ' .No,' said Simon, shaking his head. ' Could you not by any means find : out?; There's a railway station in the I town ; can you not see the name, there?' (To be Continued.)
