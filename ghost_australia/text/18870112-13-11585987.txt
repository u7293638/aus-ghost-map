WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1887. Government did well in deciding to send a Minister to the proposed Im- perial Conference in London ; they have done still better in deciding to send two. Had Mr. GILLIES seen his way to leave his post at the present juncture, no serious complaint would, we fancy, have been heard from any quarter. The Premiers of two of the neighbouring colonies have decided to go to London, on the clear understand- ing that the business of the conference will be concluded in ample time for the meeting of the colonial Parliaments. Some objection has been taken to the absence of the Queensland Premier while such troublesome questions as the separation movement are still un- settled. Few people would agree that public affairs, or the preparation of bills for the forthcoming session, are in a particularly critical condition in Victoria just at present. It is understood that Mr. DEAKIN goes as a representative of the colony at the special desire of Mr. LORIMER him- self. The susceptibilities of the As- sembly had to be considered, and it seemed desirable that a member of that House should go as well as a member of the Legislative Council. The As- sembly will require an account next session of what was said and done in London, and it is better that it should get it at first hand. As far as the control of the purse goes, the London conference will, however, at no time resolve itself into a " committee of supply." Mr. STAN- HOPE distinctly explains, in his despatch of the 25th November, that it is not the intention to " commit . . . " any colony to new projects entailing " heavy expenditure, but rather to " secure that the sums which may be " devoted to the purpose may be " utilised to the fullest extent, " with complete knowledge of all " the conditions of the problem." Certain small suspicions might have arison in the colony if Mr. LORIMER, tim supposed repre- sentative of a section of opinion in the Government, had been the only Vic- torian Minister present at the con- ferenco, and nothing, we fancy, would have tied the hands of tho Minister of Defence, more effectually than tho idea that his action would have been mis- understood. It is well, again, that the colony should bo represented by a young Australian. Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH, another " son of the soil," is likely to leave the impression on his colleagues at the conference that Australia can produce public men who aro good speakers and clear-headed men of busi- ness. The future of Australia will depend on the men and women bom hero ; and the more speedily, tho moro earnestly, and the more generally they learn to take an interest and a part in all that concerns tho welfare of the colony the botter. The weak point, as far as the meu of tho futuro aro concerned, seems to be indifference or apathy on public questions. But that we believe will pass away. The colony is in a transi- tion stage to-day, and the pioneers havo still to do most of the work which re- quires experience and " knowledgo of " the world." No exception can be taken to Mr. DKAKIN as a representa- tive of the Victorian native-born, standing higber than the average in ability and intelligence. Besides, now that Sir G. BURRY has retired, he is the orator of his party, and will be able to treat tho Imperial Conference to some of ' thoso flowing harangues which we know so well, and of which perhaps-we havo become a little wearied. The proposed conlerence in London may disappoint some of the hopes which havo been formed about it. But it is well that at the fust attempt to " attain " to a better understanding" on matters which concern all parts of the empire, tho Australian nativo party-which is, of course, not a party at all, but destined to swallow up all parties by and by- should be suitably repre- sented. Some attempts aro made by one Melbourne newspaper to trade on sup- posed jealousies und suspicions in the colony of that old bugbear " the Colo " nial Oflico official." There is nothing better than the instinct of indepen- dence, and all colonists ought to value their constitutional rights and privi- leges. But there is no bign of their being attacked or called in question at present, nor any need to bo alarmed about the Colonial üllico official. Bush epigrams about " trailing a red herring "across tho track of colonial federa "tion"have lost their point, because tho difficulties in tho way of colonial fede- ration turn out to bo purely local diffi- culties. "Tho man IÎOOERS" witticism is entitled to be superannuated by this time. Meanwhile no living writer or public mau in Great Britain has pro- posed, directly or indirectly, to tax the colonies for Imperial purposes. It is quite unnecessary to tell the two Ministers who aro going to the con- ference not to forget that there must really bo " no taxation without repre- sentation," or that "whatever body " is entrusted with Victorian money " must be somehow mnde responsible " to Victorian taxpayers." No one for- gets that. A Ballarat newspaper is taken to task for declaring that " the prin " ciple of political federation underlies " tho whole movement. " But as few people exactly understand what " poli " tical federation " means, or involves, the statement seems to bo a safe and harmless one. The Secretary of State explicitly lays down that any discussion of political federation at the forth- coming conference would be premature, and probably mischievous. Tho conferenco, wo take it, will deal with things as tliuy are ; its main busi- ness will be to make the best use pos- sible of the means which colonial legis- latures have set by for defence pur- poses. We have pointed out before that it will be of creat advantage for I the representatives of the various colo I nies to ascertain what colonial, as well as English, opinion really is on these j matters , how far they are likely to be suppoited and how far thwarted in their respective views It is to be hoped that the general results of the conference will be thus profitable m a double sense Some woids and terms winch had ono meaning a generation 01 two ago have been perveited by misuse until invested with a significance quite the opposite t > that which they onco had This has puzzled philo- logists greatly-so subtle has been the changing piocess-but the newer acceptation geneially holds its place and tho old is foigotton Hamlet's threat that he " will make a ghost of " lum who lets " bim when the spectra of his fathei walks the terrace must have been undoistood by the "gentle- men "to whom it uas addiessed, but under stmilai circumstances at the piesent day tho aident joung person would leavo no doubt as to his sanity if ho employed such a remark But this is an ettiemo case Some cen- turies divide the eias, and the change, thouiih coirupt, does not now demand much attention But nearei home therç has been a lemarkable t evolution, and an honouied old time phrase, which had a true ung m the fifties, has become debased, and threatens to undergo com- plete transformation Tho hardy, enterprising nnnei »ho braved hotter summers than w o have now, who had no \ an Yean to grumble at, and who was otheiwise without many accessories to civilised life, used to tejoice in his intention to strike into unknown locali- ties "to prospect " ] le cained his life m his hand, as it weie, and a shovel, a pick, a bill} can, and peihaps a blanket, and tho prospecting ho did eithei re- warded him bountifully or gave hua speedily to understand that he must move to newer ground At any rate, he do\oted his labour and his substance to the work, and if ho lost, ho lost-Lug feeling the while being that " lie eithor fears bia fate too much, or his desert ia »mull, Who clares not put it to the touchant! win, or lose it all Piospecting foi gold meant some- thing in those da} s that could bo understood The gold was m the ground, to bo mined for and gained at individual expense and by hard work.

Brawny muscle is not the physical endowment to be em- ployed, but a bia/en lace, winch, in the parlanco of the day, is do scubed pithily, though not elogantly, in one word Theso lefloctions aie forced upon any one who has followed the history of the prospecting voto of ¿83,000 sanctioned by Parliament last session, and intended to give new life to the mining industry That this awakening is required cannot bo denied, in view oí the very serious depression now exist» ing at the mines, but the opera- tions of the poisons who form the mining community seem to have been directed to the seeming of the largest possible amount of state money on tho simplest of terms, and in a " free, easy, and accessible manner " (Mi PArTEBSON must bo thanked fot having taught us that phrase ) In the first place, tho woll consideied schema proposed by the Government fot the distubution of tho money was senously hacked in the As- sembly, and tho Central Prospecting Council, which would have ensured something like fnir play and the expen- diture of the voto in the best way, had to be dropped The machinery loft wa3 incompleto, and must woik un satisfactoiily It consists of a board for each mining distticr, which has to deal with applications and mako recommen- dations to the Muustei of Mines, with whom icsts tho final responsibility. Now, the Dest of Ministers has to live, and the hi oath of his political life can bo cut oil at any timo at the capneo of certain othoi politicians known as sup- porters If a laige section of these suppoiteis are nuning members, and they aro retained to appeal against the recommendations of the local boaids, the Mimstei must feel tile piessuro Con- sequently there will be little or no improvement m tho method of dis tnímtion The unsuccessful* applicant will move his member, the member will move the Minister, and tho game will ba worked 'Jins is no fancilul diead. It is boin of tho circumstances now observable In neaily every division there has been a flood of applications foi var} ing amounts, and if they were all granted, half a million of money would not sullice The grab is a violent ono, and has to be checked, otheiwise Parliament may be disinclined to îepeat tho exponmout A goose that lnj s a golden egg, and diops it so conveniently as to íendoi prospecting unnecessaiy, is to bo cherished and not killed But death will surely follow tho present tactics of speculators who havo pushed forward ventutos for state assistance in such numbers as to appal A conespondont recently exposed somo of theso pioceedings in connection with the applications in the Castle- maine district, and particularly drew attention to tho fact that some com- panies had applied whan paid large dividends in tho past, and never placed a penny to a reseive fund It is tina prodigality which is the most unfa- vourable symptom of mining Keefs ara madu to yield their riches, dividends ara paid for two or three years, and then como poverty and a cessation of work. If businesses aro conducted in this way, they must fail, and it will be the worst thing possible for the share- holders in such concerns if they aro per- mitted to enjoy the assurance in the hours of their prosperity that when bad times come the Government will supply the wherewithal for developing new ground. Tho prospecting boards in the first place, and the Minister afterwards, should therefore see that the past his- tory of a companj, as well as its prospects, justify that company in being assisted One other point should also be considered, namely, the liability of the company after it has been enriched at the expunse of tho state If a pro- prietary leceives £2,000, it «ill no doubt gladly return £2,000, but this does not appear to be sufficient Stiff interest should be charged for the loan.
