To the Editors of the Sydney Herald. GENTLEMEN,â€”I beg leave to contradict a state- ment which appears in your paper of the 21st instant, in the column of "Domestic Intelli- gence ;" it appears that at a meeting held in the School of Arts on Monday evening last, in a discussion on ghosts and spectral illusions, one of the orators stated that the ghost of the late Mr. Fisher, of Campbelltown, was seen by me, and sworn to before Mr. Howe, of Glenlee, J.P., which circumstance led to the detection and ex- ecution of Fisher's murderer. I now beg you will give the whole of the above statement my unqualified denial, as I know nothing of the case, being at that time two hundred miles distant from Campbell Town. I would take no notice of the circumstance al- luded to now, but for the erroneous opinion now prevailing that I am the person who saw the ghost before alluded to. Gentlemen, your early insertion of the above will much oblige your very obedient servant, JOHN HURLEY.
