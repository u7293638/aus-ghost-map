TEMPERANCE NOTES. (SELECTED RY THE women's CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNION.) Goughs Beautiful Peroration on Water.— “ This is the liquor which God the internal brews for His children—not in the simmering still, over smoky fires, choked with poisonous gases, and surrounded with a ster eh of sickening odonr3 and rank corrup tions, doth your Heavenly Pother in Heavrn prepare the precious essence of life—the pure Water—but in the green glade and glassy dell, where the red deer wanders and the child loves to play, there God brews it ; and down, low down in the deepest valley, where he fountain murmurs ami the rills sing; and high upon the mountain tops, where the naked granite glitters like gold in the sun, where the storm-cloud broods, and the •hunder storms crash ; and away far out in the wide wild sea, where the hurricane howls music and the big waves roar the chorous, sweeping the march of God—there He brews it —this beverage of life—this health-giving water. And everywhere it is a thing of oeauty, gleaming in the dewdrop, singing in the summer rain, shining in the ice gem till ■'he trees nil seemed turned to living jewels, spreading a golden veil over the setting sun, or a white gauze around the midnight moon, sporting in the cataract, sleeping in the glacier, dancing in the bull shower, folding, its bright snow curtains softly about the wintry world, and weaving the many coloured iris—that seraph's zone of the sky, whose warp is the raindrop of earth, whose woof is the sunbeam of Heaven—all chequered over with the celestial flowers by the mystic hand of refraction. Still always it is beauti ful, this blessed life water. No poison bubbles on its brink ; its foam birngs nojmadness and murder ; no blood stains its liquid glass ; pale widows and starving orphans weep no burn ing tears in its depths; no drunkard’s shriek ing ghost from the grave curses it in words of eternal despair. Speak out my friends, would you exchange it for the demon’s drink —alcohol ?” Messrs J.
