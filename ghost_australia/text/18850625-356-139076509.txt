LUXUR1ES IN THIE DIYORCE COURT. AcrD all the painful disclosures too frequently made in the divorce cases, there is occasionally an element of the ludicrous. The case of Orr v. Orr, for example, supplies a definition of "luxuries" which some housekeepers would find novel. It seems that in the course of their matr:monial disputes the husband thought it advisable to warn a certain tradesman against sup plying his wife with what he called luxuries, including the following: Eggs over la 6d per dozen, pills and ointment, pickles, wax matches, pre served fish, magnesia, and condensed milk. Ono can understand how some people can regard pickles as aluaury, and even Solomon, in all his glory, was not supplied with wax matches. Condensed milk, too, though ndt par ticularly exhilarating, may be viewed as something out of the common; and an egg at three-halfpence might not suit the economical policy of some of our millionaries. But with all due respect to the great shade of the venor able Holloway, or the ghost of "' Old Parr," we cannot for the life of us see any "purple and fine linen" enjoy ment in a pot of ointment, a box of pills, or even a bottle of prepared magnesia. The Khan of Khiva was very gratefal for the box of Cockle's presented to him by Colonel Burnaby, but we are not told that he positively went on the spree with them, nor does classio history say that a medioine chest was a portion of a Sybarite's out fit. One lives and one learns.
