Mr. IVi^owvth w;is thoroughly acquainied witit iViechiKiisin, heing the principle founder oi a cuur'h in S utli Acstralia. Mr Tr»-g-»weth on risi'ig, said he kit hi^hlv honortd in beiu^ ask-?d to taku th-.' chair on such an auspiciuus occjusioi*. U\n firrit mipressif-na of Nors mm were lasuu;-, Oapt. Prout being the first worker he met* I'he tt«v. Thos. Ailen had eunnouuied tu&ny; dilliculties during the short time be had he.en in Nor.seina-, and had been suc cessful iu his work. Mr Alien and the church raenihers o»gbt to feel proud in P'jdst-ssing such a sp-endid buitdiiig which he felt sure would be opened out of dt'-irt. He concluded by making a very hunjorons remark ae to the qualifier uou« of a chair ttian. The Rev. Thos. Allen was then callen on, aud expressed his pleasure at b^ing pr- sent, and Riiid he was pieaa«^d to aee the Mayor and JMayores(Mr and Mrs Austin), present, and was very sorry Mrs Austin bad not come to stay amongst us He said he had always one olject in view, and that w-«a to speed the gospel of peace. In obolience to the wishes of the South Au-- traiian Conference he came over here, though perhaps sacrificing a comfortahle parish ; but he held tenaciously, a minis ter belonged to the church, and felt it his duty to do as the conierence told him. When he started to build the church, he en deavored to open it out of debt, and felt sure this would be realised. The rev. gentleman then read the balaiice-shett, arul allowing £16 for the tea, left a debi*; balance of £ly, which he felt sure would be wipe^ out that night, and therefore open the church out of debt. The choir then sang ' Sawing the seed,' Mr. D, Harris taking the eolo. Mayor Austin then addressed the meet ing. He said his first impressions of Nors^maa were ; that th-rc were no build iug?, »nd did 11.it think that in such a shoj t space of time, the town wouid be ay liirtje as it is at present hut he felt c^r-aia the field was a permanent one. He said Air. Alien and his committee bad pufc their hearts into the work of bui'dintr such a fine church and as there was only £,19 to £-nt Vo op^n it out of debt he felt sure Mr iilleu'a an ticipations of getting that amount before the meeting clo&ed; would be realized. j He hoped this would be such, .becau.se, instead of all future collect Los being used to pay the standing dobt, it would be re quired to extend the present building ia a very short time, iu order to accotumodate th« increasing population. , He thanked the Rev Ttios. A'len for the kind remarks made about his wife and himself. The collection was then taken up which amounted to £7 9s. The llev. T. Allen on behalf of the trus tees and himself, thanked all present for their generous support, svnd Mrs if. Ghdu for the pr- sen: ot the organ.

The Rev. J. Dingle was the last speaker, and as it was late; he spoke very briefly. He said at the last tiomh Australian conference, the Bible Christian and Priiiii tive Methodist churches decided to work unitedly in W.A., and all. their churches wore being opened out of debt- . He was very piear-.eii to be able to fay this church was the first United Methodist church in the colonies, as it was represented; by all thV Methodist bodies, and if Methodist aaion is con sum tted, this church would be already united.
