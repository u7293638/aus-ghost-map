THE CYCLOBAMA. The morning, afternoon, and evening ses sions at the Oyclorama were all "largely attended on Monday, and_ the public interest in the wonderfully realistic picture of the Battle of Waterloo shows no sign of abating. Mr. Eoekley's illustrative lecture is listened to daily with the greatest attention, while the musical effects' under the direction of Mr. Dennis Keenan leave nothing to be desired. A novel and striking innovation in the entertainment was introduced. on Mori day evening, when the. ghost of Napo leon appeared upon the scene, of the famous battlefield. At the conclusion of Mr. Lockley's lecture the lights were turned down, and presently from the surrounding gloom the figure of the defeated Emperor stood out before the onlookers, olad in the costume familiarised by his pictures, and gazing with melancholy visage upon the scene of the great struggle. The effect was extremely good, and its repetition to-night will doubtless attract another crowded attendance.
