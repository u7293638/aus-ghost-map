Supernatural Appearance. A gentleman in Leeds says-I have a mania'.'"for ' antiquities, and a few months.ago I came across a curious old carved chair. It was broken, so I got it cheap, glued it, and placed it in my snuggery for a smoking chair I did not use it much for I always felt tight and uncomfortable in it, and sleepy. I always sit up late reading and smoking, with my dog Rex as my only companion. Rex hated the old chair, and would never lie on it, and would bark, and growl at it. One night I drew it up to the table, having some writing to do. I again noticed the pressing sensation, and felt very cold. I went to the fire. Rex was very restless, shivering and moaning. The house-keeper came in, started, and then laughed, saying, " I must be half asleep, for I could have declared ' I saw a man sitting in that chair." 'I sat reading for a long time, then rose and turned to the table. There, sitting in the chair, was an old man, with, the most fiendish face possible to picture. He was leaning over the table, his long arms passing over it. Rex began to moan piteously. Then the thing turned and sprang on to my shoul- ders. I fell to the ground stunned. "When I came to myself Susan and ber husband were leaning over me. My throat hurt me, and I found round it livid finger marks. The next day I ordered John to chop up the chair and burn it. In the seat we discov covered a secret drawer containing a pencil sketch of the fiend I had seen, and two small mummied hands hold- ing a pencil. Was it revenge for the sketch ?
