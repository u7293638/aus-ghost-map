In HubtU- delicate way to tell Of you. ere you and tho world were married— The lilac-odour you loved bo well. Again, T saw you beneath the blooms of Those lilac- trees iu the garden iJd. Ah me ' each tree is a mark for tumbs of Dea.il Hruams aud memories still and cold. And Death, cornea there with Iiia breath sceut-ladon. And gatb'iitig gently the blossoms shed (In guise vl Autumn, the brown-browed matdeu), With your and my dead buries his dead. 0 fuirer far than the fair ideal Ot him whu imagined thu foam-barn Queen, lu foum-whiio nwrhle — a dream wade Vtill — T« inu were you in ihnau years I ween. Your liyB were redder than night-shade burries, That burn iu borders of hedgegrowed U;.es, And sweeter far than tho in'Dt wind cherries Th« Jun-i sun flushes with crimson stains. And gray your eyes as a cuckoo's wings were — A Rray soft shadowing d«ops profound, Were thought* that reached to the heart of 'things were, And love l»y drvawing though seeming drowned. Twin-tulip breasted like her the tread nf Whose feet made music in l'aphos fair, The world tu.nitf n-aa not wi-rth a thread of Your brown ambrosial braided hair.

So riijjht came down like a sombre ravun, And southward ever the ship Bailed on, Till {,'!»-* grwu fields and lessoning haven Grew, taint, and fuded like ghosts at tlaK-it. As fields of H.enven eternal blonming, Th-*» floHvrful nt-lds of my Euglish land, ? ' On midnight visions «w-: still perfuming All wild waste places a .id seas of sand. And still in seasons of storm and thunder, In stmugo lancls under your land aud V mine ; And though our ways luvve been wide asunder, In calm add tempest and shade and shine, Your faco I see as I saw the last timu— As one bi.rne space-ward on wings of ligl't, With eytjs turued back to a sight of past time, Beholds for ever that self-same sight. But scorn has died on your lips, and through you Shines out star-bright an immortal grace, At though God them to His heaven drew you. And sent tin angel to take your place. 1 plucked a rose from the tree you cherished, My heart's blood ebbing hat kept it red, And all my hopes with its eoont have perished ; Why mourn them now— aro tho dead not dead ? And yet, God knows, as this rose I kiss, you May feel the kisses ftcroas the seu ; And Boul to soul for the larger issue, Your soul ,piay stand with the soul nf UlU. Unknown to }ou fur the strings of Being Are not so eusily snapped or torn. And we may journey with eyes unseeing On paths that uiuut iu ttiu years un born. Farewell, fair love.
