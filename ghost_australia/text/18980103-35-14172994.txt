THE LIMBS OF DEAD YEARS. ยก '07 AMONG THE SHADES. The vigorous young new year, baby '9g, fall of noble hopes and high aspirations, had pushed the tottering and worn out '97 over the abyss of time into the fathomless beyond Our poor friend '97 felt his last hour approaching as the Post Office, clock chimed 11 last night, and when the chimes rang out midnight he passed peacefully away and fell into the limbo of Dead Years In the Kingdom of the Past Old Father Time, seated upon his spectral throne, awaited the coming of his More out servant Before him stood the spectral army of the dead years In numerable was that ghostly array, for in its ranks were the shades of every your Since the dawn of time Spacious as is the Kingdom of the East, it was filled with company after company, regiment after regiment, brigade after brigade of the ghosts of vanished years There were more phantoms of the past before Father Time than all the soldiers that all the nations of Europe could put in the field to-day, because there was the spectre of every year since that far-off time when the Maker of all things said, " Let there be Light " It is not given to mortals to behold the face of Old Jfs'hcr Time, for men could not look upon it and Ino It is old beyond conception, and his enslave the dread glance of one to whom the whole (drama of human history is an open book Well might that countenance be marked with suffering, for since our race begin not a wicked thing has been done not an evil thought has been conceived, not a wrong has been wrought and suffered, but has put its mark upon the brow of Time Every ping of human pain felt by the countless millions who have passed through his spectral years has marked his visage, and every good deed and every noble act have left their record upon him As the years before the throne of Old Time bore the characteristics of the period they represented, and it was sad to see what a vast majority of them were blood-red and how few of them had been years of peace Immediately before Old Time stood the yours of grace, and behind them stood the countless ranks of the old heathen j cars Aroona Old Time stood 18 big spectres a hundred times as big as the spectre of the year These were the centuries of the Christian era And the phantom army stood solemn and silent, for on this one night the spectres of the past all foregather before the throne of their area. monarch to witness the addition of one more year to their army Suddenly a shudder ran through the Limbo of Dead Years, a faint chiming of f nr -away bells, so faint that it might have been fancy, was heard, and then before the throne of Old Time a spectre gradually took shape It was the shade of '97 The newcomer made his obeisance and said, "Hail, Father Time " " What of the world, '97 ? " asked Old Time, and from the spectres of oil the vanished years came the whispered question, " Yes, what of the world ?" i " Evil and good, Father Time, good and evil, bloodshed and robbery, self- sacrifice and loving kindness, the brute and the Godhko, the dumb driven human cattle and the fearless mastery of matter and of mind, the. slaughter of the weak by the strong, and the succour of the weak by the strong-an awful mass of contradiction, Father Time, tears and laughter, joy and sorrow, (rood and evil inextricably mingled in the same lives , but amid it all soothing- humanity dimly struggling up the steep ascent from the beast to the Godhko " As of yore," said Old Time, and his phantom legions echoed, " As of yore " " Thou art bloodstained, '97," said Old Time " Battle and murder, Father Time," said '97 " There have been cruel massacres and bloody battlefields Hence these bloodstains " " Thou hast many jewels upon thy brow, '97," said Old Time " Many of the sons of men have done noble deeds in '97, Father Time Many tears of re- pentance and forgiveness have been shed, men have given their lives for their fellows and have perished like heroes in rescuing their comrades, as did the hard-living miners of Stockton, who in the bowels of the earth fell before an unseen foe, and women for the faith that is in them have perished on the mission fields Hence these jewels " " As of yore," said Old Time, and again from the phantom army came the murmur, " As of yore " " Thou art seamed with many scars, '97," said Old Time " Pestilence hath stalked the Earth, rather Time, and Gaunt famine hath devoured its thousands Even 1,1897 of the years of grace, have seen the foolish sons of men perish his sheep because they be not dead I also have seen strong men and tender women and little children walk the earth crying for food till they became living skeletons, and fell dead by the wayside because the sons of men, having plenty for all, do not justice Though they be hours of all the ages the people has a been slow to learn Also, many en- dow ed with genius by which they were meant to do great things for mankind have sold their divine birthright for worldly success, and many there be who, having done noble service for God and humanity, have fallen from their high estate to wallow in the more Pestilence and famine and wasted genius and a ruined reputations and wrecked lives, rather Time State these seams and scars " And again came the ghostly whisper from the army of the past, " As of yore " " Thou standest proudly, '97," said Old Time " Though many of the sons of men have fallen before the flesh and the devil, many bright spirits have conquered them rather Time Great even in its degradation and unconquerable even in its direct defeat is the soul of man Amid all the ei ii and ignorance and suffering, the human race hath been slowly, painfully, and blindly climbing up through 1897 as through all the ages, towards its divine destiny oftentimes going wrong, and slowly, retracing its steps and getting right again in the mighty battle both, been good and evil not all the victories have been on the side of evil In 1897 a mighty one hath been born whose life-work shall mark the beginning of a glorious epoch in human history, and in the annals of men 1897 Shall never be forgotten, because in that year this man came into the world Because of this, and because I see that the spirit of man, unconquerable and imperishable, will win the battle of the ages, a greater victory than any of the creatures of the Most High has over won, and because in doing so men will reach a greater knowledge and power than any of the mighty spirits in the universe, I stand proudly before the, Old Time The spirit of man defies and masters thee and the kingdom of the past, Old Time, even as it shall defy and conquer the eternity to come " And again from the spectral army came the whisper, " Al of yore " " Thou dearest an oft-told tale, '97," said Old Time " It hath been even as thou mayest these many thousand years, but thy aspect is brighter than the year the it came before thee, and if thou looked along the ranks thou, will see that through the ages the years have been getting better and better Take thy place in the rank nearest thee, '97, there where thou seest a gap of three When two more years have come that company shall be complete, for its units are the years of the nineteenth century And now both the Earth for the many thousandth time begun afresh her journey round the mighty orb of day The measurement of the journey since the earth first began its color would be beyond the power of the human mind to grasp Once again, 1897, will you and I and all the years ago mankind When old Earth shall have finished her last revolution the trumpet shall summon us before the Great Judge, and man, not seeing through a glass darkly, shall stand face to face with all the dead years, and be judged for his handiwork Till then patience, all j of dead years, for afterwards Time itself, which is a creation of the human mind, shall cease to be, and the spirits of men in their completed powers shall no longer count by days or years shall no longer know of a past or a future " So speaking, Old Time rose from his throne, 1897 stepped into his place beside 1890 in the company of the years of the nineteenth century, the phantom army in perfect silence and in perfect order marched past the dread monarch, and darkness fell upon that silent kingdom SI 16
