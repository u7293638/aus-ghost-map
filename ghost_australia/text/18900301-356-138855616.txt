S,, : SELECT POETRY OIISSION. IT isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone Which gives you a bit of a heartacheo At the nsetting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you might have sent, dear; Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of hcartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say, The loving touch of the hand, dear, Tho gentle and winsono tone. Tinat you had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. 'These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, T'heso chances to be angels Which even mortals find 'They come in night and eilence, Each chill, reproachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, '?To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. -And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache At the setting of the sun.
