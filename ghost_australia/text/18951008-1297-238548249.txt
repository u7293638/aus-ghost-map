THE PREMIER NOT SUR PRISED. NEITHER WAS "IIE FAIRLY STAG GERED." The Premier denies that he was "fairly staggered," or that he turned as "white as a ghost," or that he "hastend to the tole- graph office and had a conversation on the telephone," because Mr. Hugh Taylor, of Parramatta, had asked him, "What about the Dean case?" The fact was he bad heard of the arrests before he left town for Parramatta, so that Mr. Taylor's Informa tion that the arrests had beon effected was Btale news. Therefore, he was not stag gered. Neither did he excitedly hall a cab and drive to the station. Not oven did he catch the "25 past 5 train" as a result of tho disclosure. "I saw Mr. Taylor af ter I came out of the telegraph office," Mr. Reld explains, "and tho wire that I sent was merely a privato telegram, and had no reference to tho Dean cose whatever,"
