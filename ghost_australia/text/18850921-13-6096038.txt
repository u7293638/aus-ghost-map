ABOVE THE SPEAKER. Br TiMOTHEus. "Timotheus placed on high." If the member for Williamstown had not blocked the Estimates Ministers would have had to congratulate the result es on a really good week's work. Two days were devoted to the Licensing Bill, is to get through the court clauses an 1 ilic c pensation clauses was as much as Ministers could hope for, the bill being" what it is and although the compensation clauses u Elbe discussed further in, attentive has been tuned by carrying them intact in the first instance. It was time progress was made If Ministers are half through the Licensing Bill, it must be remembered that they are also half through a six months session 'The Factory Bill and the Tasmanian treat), and the Electoral Bill, and the Estimates as yet practically un- touched-are big tasks to dispose of in the other three months, especially with the Legislative Council protesting against a crush The expedition of the week is partly owing to a change of tactics Mr Berry resigned his charge of the Licensing Bill, and Mr. Kerferd sat in charge at the table, and hon members, instead of being argued with, were placated How far Mr Kerferd can go in pushing bills through committee no one knows. He has accomplished wonders, and his latest achievements are amongst his best. Every member accepts with confidence the assurance that the Attorney-General will " take a note " of his objection The words have become a catch phrase in the House but in due course Mr Kerferd is ready with a proviso for a statement why the proviso is impossible, and in either case discussion is avoided 'the habit thus dropped into is the only business like time saving practice in the House, and it is precious accordingly 'Then again the idea is gaining force with the Opposi- lion that little further party capital is to be made out of the Licensing Bill There are more promising matters a little further on The ports are current that the Tasmanian Treaty is sick, and that the Electoral Bill is not healthy And so there are hopes on the left that the session which came in as a lamb, inny to out as a lion There was for Ministers one bit of luck The compensation clause was taken immediately after the dinner hour, and before a quorum was present and it went through there and then to the intense surprise of would be amendment movers who sauntered in afterm adds But Mr Bent was in his seat, and a war of his hand, a mere verbal amendment to secure a division, would have arrested proceedings until the committee was again fully constituted 'The fact that there was no one to watch the clause, shows how little the Opposition in the House is organised, and how much the supposed publicans' party in the House is a man he has indeed, no existence Scarcely a member-indeed not one-butwould object to posing as publican a ally pure and simple The objections offered come simply from members who act on general grounds, and who defend the licensed victualler when it seems proper, as they would protect the chemists, the dentists, and the drapers, if those trades were under review Hut Mr Bent's non action was significant also the politicians now want the bill through They see their chance elsewhere When the member for South Melbourne entered the House on Tuesday, it was with a Bil agenda bustle which denoted that he had something good on hand He was late and lost his legitimate opportunity of speaking during question time. 'The House was in committee. A clause in the Licensing Bill does not seem to have much in connexion with a secret circular of the Orange lodges, but that did not matter A motion to report progress got rid of the little embarrassment and the mj sterious document was soon before the House. It would seem as it the sentence intimating that Parliamentary candidates are to be reviewed and recommended or rejected by the Grand Master, the faithful to vote accordingly, was expected to make astir But the dogs have gone by when Orange circulars of any kind whatsoever can much interest the community When the Jesuits were expelled from Catholic corner tries, it was because they were deemed to be formidable , the agitation about the Orangemen in the old days was because of a belief that they were a power-a numerous body, with clever and capable men at their head But nowadays if one band was to play the "Battle of the Boyne" in the streets, and another to discourse "Croppies Lie Down,' the public would not object if only it could be hoped that the performers would keep time so far as Parliament is concerned, the life sion was dispelled when the Grand Master of the day at last entered the House So long as he was unknown, "Bogus Clarke' might be anything, wherefore it was imagined that he was much But when the G M came out into the open everybody laughed ' You cannot think much of a religion, ' has said a critic of Brahma, which takes a monkey for a God, and no one could feel any alarm about the men who selected the G M as their. chief-for if the Bogus was ferocious He was also feeble It is all over with the ghost when once one has seen the scooped out turnip with the candle inside it Mr Richardson is an improvement upon the Bogus.

There is one possible chief, under whom, perhaps, the Orange lodges might make a show but this is their business In Pn land, the familiar letters OOM have been interpreted by caustic Conservatives to mean "Grand Old Muddler," "Great Old Munchausen and so on. The G M 's sent to the Assembly suggest the moaning ' great mistakes " Hon members enjoyed their Wednesday evening this time, for the case of a public servant was brought on, and these are the matters they understand and relish Dr Quick is becoming the champion of the ae partments He has Hansard on his hands already and the railway service, and he shares the Education office with Mr Mackay Cases should throng upon him for two-thirds of the offices are understood to be in the in cipient stages of revolt against the new order of things. The hon, member- pleaded the Macdonald case in a way that showed that he believed it. It is the privilege of youth to believe so much Macdonald is supposed by all the authorities to have been a party to blundering which nearly led to a terrible smash at Burrumbeet, and he has been reduced a grade accordingly Nothing was easier for Dr Quick than to arraign the authorities who have in turn condemned Macdonald to assume that the local traffic manager was bad and wicked that the general traffic manager was bad and wicked that the commissioners are bad and wicked that Mr Gillies, if not bad and wicked, is stupid, and that Mr Service is puzzle headed also With experience, olaslcomcs incredulity, and a suspicion that in these sweeping charges there may be a mistake somewhere 'The battle of the Burrumbeet station comes before the House as Sir Walter Scott said all battle pieces should be painted, ' A great smoke, an inn here a sword there, and all the rest left to the spectators. But amid the confusion two forms are visible there is the sturdy figure of Donald Macdonald, a Highlander, incapable of recognising defeat in argument or in practice We Kee Lum lighting his way from officer to officer from the traffic manager to the commissioners from the commissioners to the Ministers spending an hour with all his papers with the renner himself-and finally appeals" from Ministers to Parliament Such obstinate men the world Donald never met with in all his life. One has come across Donald befor" in general and in local history there is Mieca I, who preferred the iron boot to cluding. a theological first and the shepherd John Brown who checked Claverhouse at the head of his troopers and was cut down by him and the union >wn hero who defended his sixpence so stoutly that the high women think I HeiMm that the man had not a Bacillus,? on In. j oison lee he should have 1 died them both, and last, but not least there is Sunday Macpherson, the Brighton gate. keeper, who-per Mr Pent arrested for life the transfer of the Hobsons lady lines to the state because three halfpence per diem had been or was likely to be deducted from his pay All these heroes are of the Donald Strain the idea that Donald is done for by the vote of the House refusing him a committee is not entertained by any expert for a moment. As with a change of Government we shall hear from him again to take the breeks off a Highlander is declared by the proverb to be impossible-on the assump- tion that the Highlander has none-and to deprive him of any honour, profit, ormolu ment when he is once possessed of the same-is almost as difficult The second figure is not in the fore, but in the back ground of the presentation. It is that an individual gliding from post to post, whispering here and hinting there Mr Service evidently attached more importance to the presence of this second individual than to that of the first, and it was because the secretary of the Railways Employes Association had canvassed hon. members in the lobbies as against the Commissioners that he declined the compromise offer that some Munster should re inquire into the case The future of the departments is still unsettled, and possibly-as we are told that the spirit of democracy is spreading into every nook and corner we shall have the departments governed by elective heads the Commissioners to be changed annually It certainly looks as if the Opposition had an idea of making "Down with the Commissioners ! ' one of their election cries, and particularly as regards the Public Service Board " A Venetian council I ' said Mr. Bent of the latter body, with scorn and with dim reminiscences of Doge mid Lion's Mouth and Council of 'len "A Venetian blind, at any rate," corrected Mr Gaunson Balaam, when the four footed associate of his journey initiated a conversation, appears to have been astonished Sir Peter '1 earle when the screen falls and discovers his wife is for the moment speechless. 'He hump backed bridegroom in the story of Nourcddin was disconcerted when he was placed upon his head in the bathrooms a genie who viewed at him in the horrid form of a gigantic cat 'to the list of individuals ' taken aback by a squall " as the sailors say, must be added Mr Gaunson, who was mute and motionless too paris used, physically and intellectually, even to rise to a point of order when he was handsomely rated by Mr 'VA mon It must be said of this outburst that not only was it volcanic, but that like all great eruptions from Pliny s Vesuvius to the Javan Ivralca tea it was unexpected the air calm, and the sky cloudless South Melbourne had anticipated the Portland arguments about the Macdonald case Mr Wrixon his adversary said, would insist that the House must maintain the law and not execute justice, as of course Mr Wrixon would because the House can maintain the law, and it is not constituted as are the courts to inquire into and to administer justice It is not unfair not unusual, as South Melbourne put it afterwards, but is very effective to anticipate an opponents contention But, no doubt Mr W Rixon found it anno> ing to be forestalled Some idea, perhaps, there was in his mind also that he has been made a butt of recently by the Gaunson section, from which have come allusions to 'milk and water, and declarations that it is " better to swallow a poker than to have no back bone ' As the inevitable Attorney General, whenever Mr Kerferd goes up or the Ministry goes down or when both events happen together-Mr W ri\on perhaps thought it advisable to stop this sort of thing At any rate, his remarks as to why Mr Gaunson enjoys impunity, about the impossibility of gentlemen joining in blackguardism and scenes, and his explanation that insolence is not courage, were so neatly put together us to suggest a premeditated impromptu these being the impromptu that are always most effective There was not so much applause as might have been expected when Mr Wrixon spoke, for the House itself was taken by surprise, but next day hon. members were entirely against a Gaunson reply - partly because the punishment w us deserved, and secondly because any answer ought to have been given at the time and on the spot And so we have only Mr Gaunson's opinion that his critic is a " crank, which is a poor thing for an eccentric to say and that he is " ladylike," which after all, is not very severe The term 'blackguardism,' Mr Wrixon explained, was not applied to the hon member, but Mr Gaunson feelingly asked who else could it be meant for Moral-No one cries so much when triced up as a flagellator line skinned always are those who expect their fellow mortals to possess hides 1 1 hut was an extraordinary question put by Mr Gaunson to the Premier "Now, did you ever know me to occasion a scene in the House during the whole of my career 2 ' It was as bold as the appeal said to have been made by George IV to the Iron Duke as to whether he did not lead a cavalry charge at Waterloo "I have often heard your Majesty say so, was the diplomatic reply Mr Service said nothing, but his face could be read as clearly as the " rape " of the telegraphist \- ' M) dear young friend, did I ever know a scene in the House in which you were not either the original cause or the prime mover'' No complaint, according to Mr Gillies can be made that the railway authorities of New South Wales are departing from the Albury Wodonga agreement The Sydney trains must run through to Wodonga so as to give the passengers an opportunity of obtain mg refreshments there, he they do But as the trains arrive in Albury a quarter of an hour or so before time, why they stop (here for that term first. The hungry and thirsty passengers are not likely to overlook the tempting Albury buffets, and, consequently, Wodonga obtains the society of the travellers, but not their cash And yet the people say that our friends across the Murray know nothing and are not smart The grumbling in the House, it is to be noted, provoked the scorn even of Mr Mirams they talk of federation, he said, with a magnificent sweep to indicate the ' they,' and they quarrel about the expenditure on what they call " liquoring up "a
