DON'T CHEAT THE FEIN TEE. TO THB EDITOR OF TBE TAJVlJUAN NEWS. . Sir,—There was a story told some time ago to the effect that a man died leaving a widow who, after his death, was troubled with an apparition. Mustering up courage she at length asked who it was and what it wanted. The reply was, “ I am the ghost of your departed huibsud; ” and add< d " I cannot rest in my grave because I have not paid the printer.” As this appears to be conridered a dreadful crime on the other *ide. I woald strongly advise the Attorney-General, his partner, the Police Magistrate, aud some of the landholders in the road district of Wellesley to mend their ways, and not construe any changes made in the law, so as to do away with the publication in the ewEpapets as well as the G aztttt of " v ■cry ' meeting of the landholders as is provided expressly in (Re A et The amended Act of 1886, section 2, provides that is a certain case the Governor*in*CouDcil ia empowered to fix a day, hoar, and place for holding a meeting, and notice thereof shall be published -by the M inister of Lands, the same as is done in respect of the annual meeting, that is onoe in the Gateite and twice consecutively in & public news* paper, "10 clear days at least” before the day of meetirg, as well as publishing the names of candidates "three clesr days before tbe day of meeting.” —Tours, etc. ?
