A FABLE. A householder who was awakened at mid night to find a burglar in his room, cried out in anger : ' Why on earth do you. come here to dis turb me T 'I have nothing of value I' . ! Are you not a merchant? 'queriei':the burglar. STo- be sure, but I have nev ? rtised my business.' ' Oh-ah-I see !': observed the burglar, as he climbed out of the window with a dis concerted expression of countenance.: MORAL: No burglar of sense will disturb a non advertiser. A man went to the priest and told him, with a long face, that he had seen a ghost. ' When and where V said the pastor. 'Last night,' replied the man, ' I. was passing by the church, and up against the wall of it did I behold the spectre.' 'In what shape did it appear T asked the priest.' ' It appeared in the shape of a great ass.' 'Go home and hold your tongue about it,' rejoined the pastor, 'you are a very timid man, and have been frightened by your own shadow.' ' Why am 1 like a fisherman V softly asked young Sofasitter, as.he reached for his hat. ' I don't know,' she answered, as she butted her golden head into his necktie. ' Why are you like a fisherman, Augustus V' 'Because I never go without my smack,' he replied. He had just secured the smack when the old man entered the room and collared him. 'It is very seldom that I engage in pisato rial purposes myself, remarked the old man, as he tightened his grip on Augustus. ' but I enjoy yanking a gudgeon occasionally.' And he proceeded to yank.
