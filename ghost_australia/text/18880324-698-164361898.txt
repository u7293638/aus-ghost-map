The Israelites have a day of reconciliation, on which itiscustomatyfor those who have hardfeelingsto shake hands over the bloody chasm. Mose Schaumburg and Ike Schwindelroeyer are rival merchant princes on Austin Avenue, and have said some pretty hard things about each other. They hate each other cordially, each one being very much in the other's -way. On the day of reconciliation they happened to meet. ' To-day vash dot reconciliation day, ' said Mose, holding ottt his hand. Isaac took the offered hand and said, ' Moses, I wishes youall dose dings vat you wishes me.' ' You vishes me dose dings vat I wishes you. So you vants to start dot fuss again, eh? Vy don't you shoost come out and say dot you vishes me pad luck.' Not long ago a wealthy citizen of Boston departed this life leaving several children but no widow, his wife having died some years before. His estate was very large, amounting, I believe, to more than -half a million dollars. By his will he left three-quarters of this property to his three children, in trust, and the remaining one-quarter he bequeathed to an acquaint ance who now lives in New York. There had been no particular intimacy between the two men, and almost everybody who knew them was exceedingly surprised that the bequest should have been made. It is hardly necessary to say that all kinds of explana tions were advanced by the world, most of which involved some scandalous relation between the two persons concerned. I happened to know the true solution of the mystery. Many yearn ago — how many 1 do not care to say— the Boston man had offered Mmself to a beautiful girl, who refused him, and subsequently married Ms less prosperous rival.-; In course or time the rejected suitor also married, as men -'-? and, dying, he took this means of adding to the nappiness of his old love, who was sorely in need of tne money. I think that everybody will admire- both joe generosity of the gift and the tact which led the HMatorto make it to the husband instead of to the wife.
