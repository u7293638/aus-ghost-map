AN INTERESTING HALF-HOTJR FOR BOYS AND GIRLS READING OUR, YOUYGr FOLKS' LETTER? DP.fT.MBEK. December's here, and with her brought A world in whitest marble wpught ; The trees and fence and all the posts Stand motionless and whito as ghosts, And all the paths we used to know Are hidden in the drifts of snow. December brings the longest night And cheats the day of half its light. s i f No bird-song breaks tho perfect hush ; ' No meadow-brook with liquid gush Rims telling tales in babbling rhyme Of liberty and summer time, But frozen in its icy cell Awaits the sim to brenk the spell. Breathe once upon tlio window- glass And see the mimic mists that pass, — Fantastic shapes that go and come Forever silvery and dumb. December Santa Clans shall bring, Of happy children, happy king. Who with his sleigh and rein-deer stops At all good people's chimney-tops. Then let tho holly red be hung, And sweetest carols all be sung, While we with joy remember them, — The journeyers to Bethlehem, Who followed trusting from afar The guidance of that happy star Which marked tho spot whore Christ was born Long years ago one Christmas morn ! — St. Nicholas.
