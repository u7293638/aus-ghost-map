The Damascus in IIobson's Bay.— Tho following report regarding tho departuie of tho Abordoon White Star steamship Dumasous from Port Phillip is to lmnd from Mel bourne:— The Damascus sailed on Thursday' night for London via Capetown. Tho vessels of this lino are becoming very popular with passengers, and the accommodation, both in tho saloon and the steerage, was completely tilled, no fewer than 100 steerngo pussengers, most of them for Capetown, availed them selves of the opportunity. Tho staterooms in the saloon, each to hold two persons, are un usually largo and well ventilated, and as tho voyago to London round tho Cape of Good Hope only takes about two days longer than that by mail steamer, via the Suez Canal, while at tho same time the heat of the Red Sea is avoided, it is not surprising that the steamers of this line are well patronised. The Damascus, which is commanded by Captain A. Douglas, takes home among her saloon passengers Mr. Stephen Thompson, of Aberdeen, one of the firm of owners, Mr. H.
