If Z\J Uriel became mv wife wrnld 1 not always wonder if I held Iter whole heart ? If aimo stray tidings fr-uu this dear friend over brousht a flush t . her cheek, would I not nsk myself m hundred agonising questions ? Bui 11 giro her up! Ql>, mereiful Heaven ! fiiiW cou'd ! P (leaven bestowwd upo'i ran sire»(fib not only to do my luty, for 1 (hi k I coutd not have been bo cruel and unwarily in any event ns to turn traitor in this rlos|ieratc hour. And through those watches I thought of them both, wondt-rintj that I liadne»cr obsmod their peculiar fitnpss before, and the charm that was sure moncr or later 1o draw two »u«h natures together. £ could not idiut out the tlint Muriel did love him, ami had been ivylug t« stitle the voiecflf her own soul. Doctor Markbam catno in nt day break. ' Heavens ! You look like ft corpse yourtotf, Xtftcdoimld!' he exclaimed * 1 did not think the end would com - so bomi-and you nlcne! Why did not Wools remain ?' ' He is not dead,' I said, with stranding hoarseness. * What have you done ? lli4 pulse is stronger-and the l'ever fought to 11 shadow 1' * He waft deor to me,' I replied. ' Haw could 1 «ee liim die ?' .' JiooB your faith or will keep people alive ?' flud he eyed me curi ously. ' Sometimes,' I ma le answer gloom ily. ' You have exhausted yourself, soul, body, and nerves. Nbw'vou are to He down We and take this diaught Sleep if you can. I wilt watch Bar llioldy.' \- There was an odd, fiery imperiousness about the man that you could hardly gainsay, si> I submitted. 1 And you think 1 1 said slowly, turning toy eyes toward Louis. ' That 5011 have worked a mirnclc. Do you want more praise than that ?' 'Then ho will lira!' ' Theft is a hope, certainly.' I laid down and turned my face to the wall. It was all in Heaven's hands. If Louis lived my path would be dreary, but for all that 1 prayed. 1 cnuld not sleep, but the rest did me some good. Markham was watch* ing every breath. The baadtome face fl'os fearfully palo now, the temple» xunkeli, the whole expression sharp and drawn. Ho sun had risen, cud T went out io breathe ila warmth and brightness. How strange the moving ftgur<slooked to me-as if, I had just come from another world. I wandered around a while and then went to tbe Quiuolls. Muriel came down to the library. She, too, was deathly pale, and looked as if she had not slept. The almost .colorless lips quivered as tbey tried to shape themselves into words. ( did not utter the words that 1 had cotnc to eay 1 felt that I must know my fate without tbe weeks of agoniz ing waiting ere circumstances brongiit it about. 'To-day will cad the euspenne,' I began, trying to steady mv voice. I raw the constrirtion of her thrust as she choked down the rising sob. ' Muriel,' I si'dt ' would you not like to see him ' Oh!' with a little pathetic cry,' if I might?' ' If you and your mother will »ome fit ten.' "I hank you.' Her voice seemed <0 fuller through wave* of tear*. SI10 thought it would be for the lust tiiue. Well, Heaven only knew. And if Heaven .gavo hrr hick to me-for it must be tlint alone now. Then Mrs. Quincll came in, and wo talked a little while. 1 was rcstleiiR .ml hurried back to my post. A peculiar change had come over Louis Uartholdy. Htill pale as marble, but the lock of pain lmd passed away nnil left tlio peculiar lovolineuR that comes after death. 11 brought a re membrance of tho old days, when I bad no one to love save liim, and bad given liiin oil tho tenderness of my soul. And ia that hour I was willing t.o sacrifice the beat hope of my life to him. j Ten o'clock, tbe hour I had appointed I for tbe interview, came, i had man aged to send away the otherf, and was alono with him when tbe namcB were spnt up. j caljed siifyly. ovpr tbp rail to J1 uriel. < Wi(l you coilje alone, lir«t,' I said.

Presently I went down stairs and summoned Rlrs. Quiiiell f think she saw what Muriel's de spairing eyes had failed to understand. Sho gave mo a quid;, questioning glance. Louis had fallen asleep again! ' IIow beautiful!' Mrs. Quinell cr claioied, hardly above her breath. ' It is more like a. picture (hail anything human. It is not death, but rather a glorifledhopc.' Muriel Btarlei with n widen con vulsive thr<ll. One moment ashen pale, like some fair bowed lillj, then the wares of secret joy rose in crown ing scarlet and drowned out the chill despair. Yes, they riahtly belonged to one another, i held her promise sacred an her own life, Hnd bin honour and ijcnw Baity were above all doubt. 1 could seal tho clasp of my own happiness, it 180 eleoted, and these t*o heroic soul« would never utter a breath of protest, But did I desire it now P After that day Muriel and her mother camc frequently. Tbe crisis once safely pasted Louis' convalescence was very rapid. I had taken up my abode at hi* rooms, making daily calls ujon Sfra Warren, however, who had a rootlier'u sympathy for us nil. 41 owo you so much,' Louis begun one morning. ' Doctor Mwkhwn iu sistii that you saved my life.' ' You would have done the same for me,' 1 returned. . Yes, gladly. For your own sakv and that of another.'

He shut his lips tightly over a sudden sharp pang. , I sat down on the Ottoman on which his feet rested, but tho face was turned quickly away from me. I felt a shiver speeding through the hand I clasped > Louis,' I began, although my voice was husky with the. stress of pain, 'if I > had been blind lieivtoiora ' He gave me a buiried, ijuestioning look. .

I crashnil out 11 o pangs, and thru»t their pale ghosts in the deepest of gmve*. That Lou's and Muriel were happy t need not say. They tried t,i tcmp -r their J ly, but it was too exquisite. If, sometimes, I had solfUhly double I, each day brought conviction It was necessary to niter the flrst ar rangements. The summons for Louis was still imperative, as there *ero many smaller bequests, and no settlement of the business could be made until he arrived. And presently they hit upon the only true solution-that Louie ami Muriel cliould bn married, and that Mrs. Quinell should accompany them abroad, * | Mrs. Warren had felt keenly disas* j pointed at flrst. * ' ' Though I can't tell why,' trim naM, ' yet I used to have « fancy that he loved her, and I ati> glad to have iter happy,' I did not son them married, but ] went on shipboard to qive tbem a last fatewell. Xever had Muriel looked mure beautiful, yet the tender face had kept something for me which it wonld never outgrow, and of which the mont ardent soul need not be jealou#. ' Bat you will always «e like a son to meMm. Quinell exclaimed, through her tears ' It pires tuo h mother's pang to leave you here alone.' Presently the stately vessel slipped from her moorings, and flouted over the beautiful bay : then 1 felt all the pain and loneliness of being left behind. ' Lpiiin made an od.l request,' I mid to Mv*. Warren, . It was that ? should go tn some place, and take .you. ) have the address licfH.' ' Ye?,' she returned, with a compli ance tlmt might hi(ve surprised nic* if my thoui>ht» had not been elsewhere. So I gave orders to the driver of the hack, and t^et| wc lapsed into silence.
