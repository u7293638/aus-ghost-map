BALLARAT. (From our own Correspondent.) 5th January, 1856. Business matters, as is usual at this season have been very quiet, and the land sales have been the principal atlraction for our monied men during the week; several of your towns men have also been up here investing in our inland metropois. The amournt of the four days sale is Â£4,156, which augers well for our). future progress, as all the lots sold are within:. the township bondary, and many have been eagerly purchased by old miners and mechanicss who intend settling down and building com- forlable cottages, whence, if neceassry, they can radiate as from a centre to all the new rushes. It is gratifying to observe the pro gress of this spirit of settlement, and the con- sequences will not be unfelt by your community, as it will tend to steady trade. , Thire aceoutis from cur agricultrrl dlistrict of Ullrrumrbeet and Dowliang IFurert, are moult' encoragting. 'lhe frequent and abundrlant rainsr have induced a most luxuriant vegetaiirn, rIrde experiecedi farmers fu?m the mother country,v declare they never saw suclh crors there as a?r?e now to be seen ill tlhose nieighlbourhlooids, rtore especially whelre tie ground was utnder crltiinvtl-? lion last year. 'iThe lBarrabooIls ard Colac hadit, better look to their laurels. " Burrumbeet Lanke is now freqirenrly visitied he our holiday excursiorists; t is about 10 miles front tri., rud from the brearitul and variedrl scenery around, and the intrinsic clharms which" a lake will always possess i this conumry, is well worthy of a visit. A torwnshirp Ias been? formed on its banks, of which an hlotel is aowr the nucleus. The municipality meeting for the purpose of electing a preliminary charman to initiate the election of members, took place last evening irr. the Golden Fleece. There was a large attendance comprising the most influential portion of our trading and legal community. Mr J. G. M. Wiglev was voted in the chair. The follow- ing gentlemen were then proposed:--Messrs Lynn, Douglas, Oddie, French, Rainy, Seekamp, Muir, Wigley, Dunne, Walsh, and several others, who with the exception of Messrs Wigley and Douglas all declined the honor. This arose from the knowledge that the govern-. ment Chairman as returning officer cannot be elected a member of the Council. On the votei being taken, Mr A. J. Douglas of Messrs Ranken and Douglas, gold brokers, was elected; by an immense majority over Mr Wigley. The meeting was at one time very animated, and argued well for the interest that will be taken in municipal matters: At the close of the. meeting, means were taken, and a committee formed to commence the establishment of a Fire Brigade. Tile vagaries and i.coansistent decision of ours' Stipendiary Magistrate, Captain Vignolles, have at last, provoked the local press to speak out, and demand his dismissal. It appears that a man named Francis was charged with stealing ac horse, but which having died ii, the interval, was considered by the maaiistratu to be equiva?.t lent to a " tabulrs rasa," for ihe dirsmissed thlo case, stating tihat Francis might as well have ben charged with "mtrdering a ghost." .nesyes. '?rooae and Coppin ably assisted by )lr and hlrs Heir, the latter better known as:" Miss Fanny Cauhcart, Ihave been delighting our' Ballarat audiences during the week. Mr Brooke's genius is most versatile, and ihe excites as much amusement as O'Callaghan, in" Hrs - last Legs " as admniration in the qrandre and most elaborate characters of Richelies, or Othello. He takes hIis farewell to- night, at the Mlontezuma Theatre, when his admirers intend presenting him with a nugget of Ballrat gold. n Mining matters have not as yet resumned their usual acrivity. Hiscouk's Diggings piromise. to be a gold field for the summer. Shepherdiug promises to be a knotty question for the local coprts.
