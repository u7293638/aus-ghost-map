The Advertiser THURSDAY, AUGUST 29, 1878. THE Ministry intend to make another effort to grapple with the rabbit pest, which has assumed such gigantic proportions, principally in the northern districts of the colony. The Bill introduced by Mr. Play ford early in the ■enioa vaa Mjectsd or laid aside in the Upper Hooae on ancwml of certain objectionable prormoM ia it which «« pointed oat at the time the meaEnre mi under debate. It ha* been felt, however, that aaeh disaatrgsjs reaults may follow from leaving the law ia its present state that the Coauaiacioaer of Crown Lande has bronglrt forward aa amending instead of a conanl'wUtins; BiQ, and tbia, we believe, can be oaniedthu session withoot infringing the Standing Orders, notwithstanding the fate of its immediate predecessor. A considerable amount of diacnasion arose in the Assembly eoneerning the rating provisions of the existing Act, and the late BUI abolished them altogether, and threw the whole cost of extirpating rabbits on private land, whether freehold or leased from the Crown, upon the occupier, leaving' the State to pay for the destractktn of the rabbits upon waste landa, and for the de partmental expenses. Now aa the whole powenof the District Councils with respect to Rabbit Districts are transferred to the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and aa the rating clauses are not repealed, the Government may levy rates. Whether this power will be exercised remains to be seen. landholder* might think it unjost to "fend taxes wrung from them, in the destruction of vermin on Crown lands; and the cost or* extirpation on private estates should, according to the Bill, be recovered from the owners or occu piers. Babbit Districts now *Ti«ring will still remain, and new districts may he pro claimed on the recommendation of the Commissioner or upon receipt of a petition from a majority of the members of a Dis trict Council of any district, or from twenty landholders lining in the aggregate not less than 2,000 acres, praying that such district may be declared a Babbit District. There ia alao power for the Governor to proclaim a Rabbit District outside the limits of District Councils. A most important amendment in this little Bill is contained in the fifth cause, which eeems to release pastoral lessees from the obligation to destroy rabbits upon their runs, and throw the responsibility npon the Commissioner and the cost upon the State. The clause is as follews:—"The Commissioner and all persons by him autho rised are hereby empowand to eater upon any waste buds of the Crown, Government Reserves, or land* leaied for pattond pur potea, with such assistants aa he or they (•ball deem necessary, for the purpose of ascertaining if there am any rabbit? thereon, and to do all such acts aa shall be necessary for the purpose of destroying the rabbits thereon* and of stopping die warrens and borrows of such rabbits; and the coats and expenses incurred in so doing shall be paid by the Treasurer out of the general revenue of the said province." Whether it is intended that the Government shall underuka the doty of extirpating rahbite on all lands beld on pastoral laase frowj the Crown, or the words we have italirJsed are inserted in order to give the Commissioner power to destroy rabbits at the public expense on a run when it would be iwsnnVnUj un just to make the squatter bear the cost, we cannot say, bat perhaps the ktter is the proper interpretation. It would be monstrous to saddle a pastosal lessee with anenormottsejqwnditare just a few.monthe before the expiry of his lease, when the profit of that oattay woatdba realised by the State in the enhanced price that would be given for the land, whathar selected by agriculturists or rented by sheep fanaere. On the other hand, it would seem scarcely fair to the country that when there is no probability of the squatter having for some yean to give up his tease the State should increase the value of his property by destroying at the public cost the vermin swarming orar his pastures. Where it i* certain the lease is near its termination die State shoaid pay for clearing the rabbits; if this work is carried out at the cost of the squatter, and the run is shortly after resumed, he ehaald undoubtedly be reimbursed. We observe that the amending Bffl gives the landholder no right of appeal agaiaat die Commissioner's claim, howvvar enor mous it may be, for the cost of d—lwjin^ rabbit?. Such a right is sksnabb as a protection against reckless extravagance or mismanagement. Government departments are too apt to bungle and waste money, and in tills matter than wig be a pecaUar liability to each emu, beoanse in the mul titude of penons who wffl he neasM to cany out this vast work of rabbit dastrac tion few comparatively will here aaaoh experience in the duties required of them, and many will be deficient in industry and discretion. She landowner should be pro tooted agaiaetaapeeitMa or njaetiee.

I A meeting of the shareholders of the Browse Island Guano Company took place on Tnesday. Angost 27, at the office of the Secre tary (Mr. P. F. Bonnin). The chair was ooonpied by Me W. B. BommeveU, MLP-, who regretted that owing to unforeseen accidents the fMOaaofrcbeet and-report were not so favorable aa had been expected. The Directors intended to lave the labor question fixed ona better basis, and hoped from the valuable nature of the in vestment that in time Ingh dividends would be paid. Die Directors' report refattefl to the loss of their despatch-boat the Marten with a cargo of stares and bags, and also stated that fee Matterhorn and Oarleton were wrecked when partly loaded with guano oa Browse Island. The Marten and cargo were insured for £1,000, which amount had been paid over. Negotiations for an open policy cover ing all tile vessels at Browse Island bad been pending, but witbout definite xesalt, when the loss of the ship* was telegraphed, and the Direc tors bad since succeeded in securing a policy embraelng?U vessels<&axteredby; them. Inthe place Of the Marten the Directors had purchased the Mary Webster, a schooner of about 80 tons register, for £I^oo, which had been sent to Browse bland with stores for six months for the laborers. Mr. Hbwlett bavinsdesired to resign his position, the Directors accepted his resigna tion, considering bis management unsatisfac tory, and bad appointed Mr. J.W.l>wis in his place. The cargo of the Euclid (556 tons gross) and that of the Ganymede (650 tons gross) had netted £LS7B and£>,26B respectively,and these amounts had been far in excess of the expecta tions. The recent charters had been effected at a reduction of 18s. to £1 per ton, so that there was stall a wide mMsin for profit. TheDirec ton bad instructed Mr. Lewis to proceed to Timor, and ask for a lease of the new islands on the grounds of the promise made by the Dutch Government, and the Company^ manager, Mr. Hewlett, being the first discoverer of the guano deposits therein. The receipts had been £14,897 3s. 6d, and the liabilities were £13,889. In answer to questions, the Chair man said there were three vessels with guano on their way to Europe, three were loading at the island, and five were waiting for cargo. If the prices expected were realised there were £6,000 profits afloat. Some discussion took place as to the mismanagement of the Company by the Directors; and it was stated that there was a rumor outside that it was likely that the balance of the capital would be called up. It was also suggested that if communication by a despatch-boat had been kept up tbe matter would have been all right. The Secretary read a list, from which it appeared that over 39,000 bags had been sent to tiie island, some of which were on tbe water. In answer to a question as to lite actions of Mr. liewis at Port Darwin, the Chairman said be bad been discharged, and the Directors intended to send some competent person to report and set matters right. Mr. Dalwood thought that as Mr. Hewlett had resigned it wasnnfair that a slur should be cast upon him in tie Directors' report. He would ask if he had mismanaged why bad he not been discharged? The Chairman said Mr. Hbwlett had been most negligent, and had left the Directors in ignorance of the opera tions. Some further discussion having taken place the adoption of the report and balance sheet was moved by Mr. W. K. Simms, HP, who said the Directors would not make a call if it could be avoided, and next half-year they hopsd to be able to show a more satisfactory state of affairs to tbe shareholders.
