Sham Entertainments. An indignant American woman has been vigorously using her pon to uttaok tho social shams of Auioricu — tlioso of Now York in par ticular. Sho says : — " This is the day of shams. I know a woman who is supposed to entertain lavishly, yot who rarely receives a guest. I call her functions 'ghost partios;' heoauBe they aro only tho sliudows of tho oubstunoe, the event itself being purely imaginary. Why, that woman has gained hor reputation for entertaining, und bus received no end of dinner invitations on absolutely nothing at all! I havo suspected licr taotios for some timo, nnd now I am quito sure that what I assort is indeed tmo— that in nino casos out of ton her dinners are purely imuginary. She bus a clover way of finding out who is engaged, to whom, and then she usks pooplo who sho knows cunnot como to her liouso, und so scores to licr social account, with no other outluy than hor orostcd pnpor and dainty seal."
