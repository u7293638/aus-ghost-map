THE HAUNTED HOUSE AT STAWELL. The mystery of the haunted house would appear to be solved at last. It appears that several young men were on the watch late on Wednesday night in order to ascertain if the noises heard were the result of human agency or not. At about half-past twelve o'clock a ghost was seen to rise from the ground in the most approved ethereal manner, with the usual white sheet garmenture, and as it advanced towards the house in question emit strange groans and cries. The watchers, however, were determined to elucidate the mystery, and they accordingly advanced towards the figure, which, doubtless trusting to its ghostly habiliments and cries, and to the innate superstition of human nature, also ad vanced towards them. As soon as the figure came within reach it was grasped, and on the sheet being torn off, disclosed the features and form of a young woman who resides in the neighborhood. After talking to the culprit well, the watchers allowed her to go home. The case may have been one of somnambulism, so that the young woman would not be responsible for her actions; but it is more than probable that the whole affair arose from a senseless and wicked desire to frighten neighbors. The suddenness of the apparition, and its seeming to come from out of the earth, is accounted for by the fact that on the allotment of land from which the "ghost" came, there once stood a public house, which was recently removed. The cellar of this building furnished a good hiding=place whilst the sheet was being donned, and also added to the deception by giving the "ghost" an appearance of having come from the bowels of the earth.
