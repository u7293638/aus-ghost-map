'The Current that Kills.' Many people have a£ genuine a terror of elec tricity as their ancestors had of ghosts and church yards at -midnighti ^Cfais-is quite foolish. As in hthe case of ghosts, it is ignorance which frightens, but knowledge which reassures. Dr. J. B. Verity, in his ' Electricity up to Date,' tells us that though ' some fatal results have happened, electricity does not loll wholesale, as does dynamite, gunpowder, or coal-gas explosions { nor is Che list of fatal accidents to be compared with deaths due to exploding or overturned oil lamps.' It is well to remember that the ability to bear electric currents varies in different individuals. Moreover, that electricity will certainly Mil if contact be good and pressure sufficient, need not be denied. Indeed, it will kill very promptly and certainly ; so much so, that Dr. Verity thinks capital punishment by electrocution is much the most speedy and painless of all the methods of killing known to science. On this point he reminds us that, since elec tricity travels much quicker than sensory nerve currents, the brain is rapidly rendered insensitive, and the subject therefore becomes quite unconscious long before the sensory nerves can communicate the impression of pain. ' The current that kills '.' is, however, as perfectly under the control of those who have but a little real knowledge as is the gas burner or even the composite candle.— The Hospital,
