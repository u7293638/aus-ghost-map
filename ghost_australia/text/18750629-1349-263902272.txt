SELECT POETRY. THE PINE AND THE WALNUT. (Newcastle, U.S., 1SC2.) A mile or so from tho gray little town Of Newcastle, porched liken guil by tho sen, On tho Kittory side (whore the banks shelvo down To the lovolv river's golden-brown) There towered, long since, nn old pine-troe. And across the strenm, in a right bee-line, Like n sentry gunrding the ruined fort, Was a large-limbed walnut, whore the kino Huddled together in shower and shine, Nibbling the herbngo, sparse and short. Summor and winter thoso bravo old trees Watched the bine river that slipt between, Leaned to tho sunshine nnd drunk tho breeze, Clothed like emporors, taking 'their ease, Now in orinino and now in green. Many n time, when I wns n lnd, I drifted by with suspended oar, The wind in tho walnut seemed so sad ! But oh, what a blustering voico it hud In tho rugged pine on tho other shoro ! And often, in restless slumber tost, I seomod to be drifting down the tido, Hearing the strident wind as it crost, To dio away like a murmuring ghost In tho drooping boughs on tho farther side. Perhaps 'twas a boyish fantasy, The dream of a dreamer, half afraid, That the wind grew sad in the wnluut-troe, . But surged through tho pine like the surging soa, With a sound of distant cannonade ! Only a fantasy ! Who can toll? But I think 'twill haunt mo to the end, Seeing what curious thing befell The walnut- tree, and tho pino as well — For they went together, friend and friend ! From a sullen cloud broko war at last, And n grim sea-dog of tho quarter-dock Took the gaunt old pino for a raizzon-mast. In the flume of battle his Spirit past, And the mizzou drugged by tho shatterod wrock. With tho Union Jaok across him laid, Thoy bore him back to the town by the sea; The guns at tho Yard his requiem played ; And the Admiral's coffin, it is said, Was shaped of tho plunks of the walnut- tree ! — T.
