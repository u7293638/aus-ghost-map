MEN I KNOW. No. XI.— The Actor. All actors are curious ; some few are good, With those one but rarely can meet ; But when they are found, and you know them — why, then Their society is quite a treat ! I know some few actors, and have in my time Known many and many a " pro," So I'll introduce one or two just in rhyme — Some actors that all of you know ! First, then, the Tragedian, who, as he stalks As Hamlet, the Moor, or Macbeth, Seems always to have some great weight on his mind — It 's only the thought of his death. He thinks all the evening of how he shall fall When stuck, shot, or knocked on the head ; | Forgetting the audience wholly forget I The actor as soon as he's dead ! Next comes a young actor whom every one knows, The Juvenile Gentleman he ; That 's what he is called, just by courtesy, for j 1 know some who are turned fifty-three ! The Desperate Vilt.ian comes next in the throng, Who mutters, and curses, and stabs ; Whose dress when en regie consists of a sword, i A pair of Jack boots, and tight " drabs." The man who comes next is the real man for fun, | He's called the Comedian, and | The prefix of " Low " is stuck on to his name, What for I cannot understand. J I For his is high art in more senses than one, j His make-up, his wigs, and his clothes ; j It's fearful to think how much really depends j Upon the right tint of his nose. I Of course there are more — there are gents on the stage : Who like ghosts are expected to walk, | Who always look stiff, and who — goodness be thanked ! — I Are never expected to taik. I agree with the Dane who thought actors should be ! Held up to high honour, and so j I take leave of them now ; for the actor's a man ; Who ranks high 'mongst the men that I know.
