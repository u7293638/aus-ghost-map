THE MEN WHO D!tD. Gentlemen, stand for a silent toast, To be drunk with drooping head ; The men who died at a falling poBt, Who won the least, and who gave the most — To our brave, defeated dead. Ghost's of the slain call out to-night From their graves aoroBS the eea. ' Soldiers stain in a losing fight — A. wild attack on a mountain height, Or a hopeless charge — are we. ' Soldiers crossing a ford in flood. Or led to a false attack \ Dragging our guns through seas of mud, Dark'ning the earth with our heart's best blood As. we fought our passage back, * Soldiers marohod through the sunburnt day, Marched through the cold, chill nieht, Walking .asleep j in the morning grey In front of the trenches brought to bay, With an unseen fnejto fight, ' Soldiers — pawns of the gen'rai's came, Tet with lives to lose or live — Done to death on a field of shame ; We gave our lives for our country's name— We had nothing more to give. Gentlemen, drink with uplifted head. Proud though the worst is faced ; Gentlemen, here s to our honored dead, The men who fought, and the men who bled— Defeated, but not disgraced 1 — T.o-Dat.
