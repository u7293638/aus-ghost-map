YANKALILLA. [From our own Correspondent.! Norman viile, November 9. Sir. K. JEt. Williams, the newly-appointed Har bour-Master and Sub-Collector of Customs, has arrived to take charge of this port. I am Borry to learn that we are likely to lose another of our old and highly-respected residentsâ€”Mr. Thomas Will son. long known among us as a man of business anl a great stay and help to our rising district as a wheat-buyer. Chairman of the District Council, and in other respects connected with the interests of the district. A few nights ago a married woman residing in the township of Yankalilla was aroused at rather. a late hour of the night"by a noise in the yard and stones thrown upon the roof of the house. On going to the window she saw a man near the win dow, having on a mask, who asked for admittance, which was of course refused by the poor woman, whose husband was known to be from home. The tall ghost made his second appearance a few nights after, and from a well-known dog that was seen about the house at the time suspicion attaches to a person in the neighbourhood. It is to be hoped these jokes may be speedily brought to an end. On Sunday last hot winds prevailed; since then we have exp -rienced very mild weather.'
