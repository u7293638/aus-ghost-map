"Tam Saw an Unco Sicht." A wb.iiEE with the signature of " One in the Flesh," takes considerable exception to an account of a run with the Melbourne hounds, given bv "Tam O'Shunter's ghost," in the sporting columns of a weeklv iournal. It seems that the latter's version, but for the description given quite accidentally of course, of events which never took place? and people who were not present, was wonderfully accurate, and vet after all the public were led to the inference that the ghost, like his great original, must have got into such a glorious state as to have "seen an unco sicht" more than happened, and consequently Said compliments in the wrong quarter. It is rather a consolation, the season is drawing to an end, or we should have been compelled to attend every meeting for the verification of the sporting news in future, and it is well known that the pursuit of the red herring and the pursuit of literature cannot be combined with advantage at all times, seductive as they both undoubtedly are.
