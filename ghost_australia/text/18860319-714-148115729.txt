Mr. Gladstone's Hold over the Commons. Mr. Gladstone's speech (writes the Pall Mall Budget) in the Commons on the open ing night and its reception by all quarters of the-new House tin ally disposed of the futile expectations in ^certain interested quarters that the Grand <Uid Man's voice would have lost its niagie and its cunning. A few weeks ago a certain " society" organ ( Truth ? J, whose political bellows are be lieved to be blown by a certain well-known politician, predicted that the moment Mr. Gladstone rose in (lie new House lie would find his influence to be like a ghost de-. parted. Never was prediction more wretch edly falsified. There is a temptation to. describe each of Mr. Gladstone's successive great speeches as the greatest he lias ever delivered. Such comparisons are futile what is enough here to note is the abund ant proof supplied that Mr. Gladstone's personal hold over the new House will be certainly not less than it was over the old. Perhaps he is even now smiling at certain rumoured defections : like another actor on a different stage lfc knows when lie pleased lie could whistle tiicm back.
