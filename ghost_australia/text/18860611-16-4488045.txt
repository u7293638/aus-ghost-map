THE LONG-YORK DEBATES. The subject of the debate between Mr, Long and Dr. York the third of the series held in the Academy of Music last night, was " Is the Bible plainly and divinely inspired'' The weather was unfavourable to a good attendance, but the stalls and galleries were w ell filled, and, as may be expected, the platform had a representative gathering of supporters of each de Later To judge from circumstances, aid from the tone of the audience, it appeared evident that the majority of the people at tended from curiosity, and -"in expectation of hearing 01 witness aga bit of fun at the expense of the speakers and. their supporters, rather from any deep interest in the subject under discussion The audience on the evening was seated long before 8 o'clock, and signs of impatience were beginning to be expressed, when Mr S T Buckland introduced the two debates with the usual preliminary remarks of a chairman The supporters of the two speakers occurred each half of the platform in ; Mr. Long's were in the majority, and each speaker took his seat opposite to his party with a greeting of loud applause Mr Long opened the debate in the nlhnuative, by leading from a manuscript a treatise unfolding the Biblical solution of the problem " why are we here, and what shall we be if we pass away ' ' He accepted the w i kings of Moses because they were the most compre sensible, they gave an account of a beginning in nine verses, in simple language, whereas that given by scientists could only be under stood and accepted by trained Secularists, and was, therefore, useless to the million He then proceeded to treat of evolution, and to the satisfaction of a section of the audience, showed how little Mr Symes comprehended the subject. He next proceeded to defend certain language contained in the Bible by asking if the records of crime contained in newspapers and information in medical books could be objected to "You might as well say the body is obscene," cried the speaker At this a lady supporter to Dr York's cause, sitting in the front row on the platform, stamped her foot and cried " No, sir ' Mr Long turned for a brief space, bowed, and the gallery cheered lustily In defending the Bible against alleged mistakes, he said such might also be found in Shakspeare For instance, the great poet spoke of a bom no f i ora which no traveller returned, and then he has the ghost of Hamlet's father parading the earth The benefits following in the train of the diffusion of knowledge of the Bible were next treated, and in proof of this he spoke, among other things, of the work of the Wesleyan missionaries in the Fiji Islands As he was beginning an account of the reformation of a young man, the president of a swearing club, the audience became an tated, but upon his promising not to exceed a few minutes, he was allowed to conclude Dr York opened the negative by complaining that Mr Long had not used the word pleasantly during the evening The Doctor, then apparently satisfied that it was not within his province to reply to his opponent, proceeded to read a lecture upon his view of the book which, in his opinion, mankind ought to consider in spired that book was the universe The proper subject, he said, for Mr Long to have discussed, was "Is it (the Bible) plainly and divinely inspired ' Mr Long here rose to a point of order, but scarcely had he completed the explanation, when a disorderly in terruption occurred Dr York made some inaudible remark about having been refused a hearing on the same point last night and sat down Mr Long continued to occupy the platform, and, amid a noisy uproar with cries of " What about last night and bit down, he emphatically asserted by gestures and shouting that he would not sit down until he had obtained a hearing The disturbance lasted ten minutes, when order was restored, and Mr Long stated his objection Dr York had no right to come there and read a written reply to an affirmation which he had never heard Cheers, counter cheers, and hisses, were given and Dr Y"ork having at length resumed, his essay was completed to the evident satisfaction of his admirers The fifteen minutes' address and reply was never held, but the subject under discussion was generally set aside in the in dulgence of open personalities by the debaters interruptions were frequent, and the dispute of the speakers was often taken up amongst individual members of the audience On the whole, if neither one side nor the other can claim an advantage, there is no doubt that the entertainment-if it can be so called one-had a ludicrous aspect, when he was easily grasped by the greater portion of the assemblage.
