He's the Man! The lady I love's to be married, /To be married to-morrow at noon ! <.<?? I knew that the day must dawn some time. * That would give to ono mortal the boom I've been longing for all of my lifetime ; But I look'd not to seo it so Boon. To-morrow she'll Btand at the altar, She, who's Bweeter by far and more fair Than the blossoms-more precious, more priceless, Than the radiant gems that she'll wear ; And I, who so love her, shall see her Plight her faith to that happy man there ! Ah me ! but I cannot remember When this throbbing heart here was my own ! My love for that lady was ever A part of my lifo. It has grown With my growth, until now, if I lose her, The world's but a waste, where alone. * Alone, I must walk over haunted By the ghosts of the hopes that for years I've harbor'd-must day time and night time Bend in spirit, with sorrow and tears, With mourning and woe and with wailing For my ruin'd love, over their biers. Must I see her tho bride of another, Her I've lov'd since my being began See the dreams of my boyhood, my manhood, 'Neath a blight-all my life 'neath a ban P Must I ever go hating her husband ? . Â«? ?. Well, not much ! For, oh, I am the man ! ,
