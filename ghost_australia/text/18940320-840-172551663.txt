Ohio Minstrels. The first entertainment and dance was given in tho Foresters' Hall on Friday, March 16. There was a crowded house. In the first part the end men in their comic songs and gags were very good, J. Parkor being prominent. Messrs. Tutty, Jno.Parker, and C. Freemantle were recalled for their ballads. The finale, "Ceasar's Ghost,' which was worked by Messrs. E. Rome, Joe Parker, and Jas. Kind- ness, was very laughable. In the second part Mr. Jno. Parker, in "Dream of Home," was much appreciated, and Mr. Tutty also sang well. Mr. George A. Evans broke up the house in his Irish impersonation. Mr, J Par- ker waa again to the for with "By-and-by." Mr. Jas. Kindness received two encores for his highland fling, which was given in great style. The entertainment concluded with the side- splitting farce entitled " Rehearsing Exposed," in which Mr. George A. Evans played the part of Julius Ceasar's " Hardback." The hall was at once cleared for dancing, which was kept up till 4 o'clook. Mr. Jas. Lahey as M.C. did his work to great satisfaction.
