The Hepewapd. SUNDAY AT MAEOUBRA. Yesterday was a very gay day at Maroubra, for a bigicrowd went out to gather relics and see the ?wreck. ? Everj'one was more or less disappoint ed, for as. yet the ship shows not the least sign of dissolution. All the afternoon people kept coming, and the road was so full of vehicles that they had to crawl slowly after- each other. The road is so bad in places : that any attempt to go at all quickly would probably leave the occupant by the wayside, amid the debris oKhis conveyance. All day long the men were working at the vessel, going to ana fro in a basket on a strong hawser attached to the mast. A horse and half a dozen men ashore did a considerable amount of pulling and hauling, and the crowd enjoyed it. It will be some time before the cutting up process makes any show, especially as the weather has to be con sidered. The shed on the. beach is inhabited Dy the present workers, who keep lonely night vigils by the wreck. One night they were startled by the apparition of a woman, dancing in and out the sea, and calling out weirdly — the first Hereward ghost* story. It is said she is daft, and dwells out beyond in the eaves. Yesterday one noticed how terribly epoilt the beach is becoming — dirty paper, broken glass, tins, etc., everywhere. It is a pity it cannot be prevented. 'Wreckage still continues to float ashore, and people eagerly go out into the waves, regardless of sharks, to bring things in. There is a certain surveillance kept over the driftwood and things that make it ex citing to capture ?'on the quiet.' Most of the stuff is flit only . for firewood, as the waves have smashed big timber into matchwood. Not a day is being lost by the people now at work.
