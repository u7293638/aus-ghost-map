NARROW ESCAPE. A grave difficulty arose among the officers of the fiealth Department on the discovery that a recently-arrived ship from Bombay contained not a ghost of a rat. A thorough search was insti tuted all over the vessel abut not one single rodent was to be fiAind. During the. investigation, a cat was pounced upon, and as she was held accountable for the absence of rats, the authorities wanted to make short work of her. Poor puss was the cherished pet of one of the sailors, who declined to relinquish pos session of his furry friend. The ques tion was debated at some length, and at last the prisoner at the Lar obtained a reprieve, and was released without a stain on her character, as her constitu tion appeared quite unimpaired by a diet of unlimited rat.
