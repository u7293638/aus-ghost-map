THE BURROWA ELECTION. ' TIIK Burrowa election will, probably, be a straight fight between the protectionist candidate and the representative of labour, Mr. TWOOMEY. Mr. DANIEL, O'CONNOR, who hos the political disease very bad, intended to have a cut in, but has decided that discretion is the better part of valour. Probably he believed that he would get in between the protectionist and the labour man. At any rate, he paid a visit to the district for tho purpose of ascertaining whether he could get sufficient support to warrant his announcing himself as a candi- date. He was treated in a hospitable manner, as he deserved to be, for he is a genial fellow ; but he wns told pretty plainly that he had not a ghost of a show of capturing the seat, and so, like a wise man, he returned to Sydney. The freetraders in the district will, it is said, vote pretty solid for Mr. MACKAY, and they will do so not because they are becoming converted to protection, but because they have. not the slightest sympathy with the other man, or with the political platform on which he has taken his stand.
