Several Boman Catholic dignitaries were present. The bride looked earnest,, sweet* fair-faced; the bridegroom graven eelf-poS' sessed. The Princess of Wales was lovely, pale, and driicate. The German Crown Princess looked healthy—the inuup of her mother, Queen Victoria. The ■ Prince of _Wales was . apparently cm excellent terms with the German Prince^ and both looked well. During the ceremony in the English chapel, the Empress of Bussia being a con firmed invalid, seemedfatigued andoveroosie^ and made a motion of holdmg a handkerchief to her eyes when the married couple saluted her. The ceremony bring conriuded, the crowd dispersed. There was only a limited display of popnlar enthusiasm. AniUumi nation of the pubbc squares took place, and the general scene was one of splendid festivity. The service formed an extraor dinary combination.. of ceremony, wealth, pomp, and splendour. After the marriage rites there was a banquet at the Palace, and subsequently a ball at the gorgeous hall. At the close of the ball- the bridal couple were formally marched to the bridal chamber, accompanied by the Emperor and officers .'of' the Court. The festivities were continued after the retirement of the happy couple, the Emperor being present. Heroic Conduct.—Mr. John Robertson has written in the-Sydney papers an account of ths fatal boat accident at the Sydney Heads, when, a fishing-smack, being swamped in a gale, foun dered. After showing how the boat went down he proceeds:—" I shall not attempt to describe the terrible position of the four unfortunate men. Nearly two miles from shore, their boat gone, and the sea raging mountains high. They were good swimmers, all of them, and instead of desponding they bravely determined to battle to the last for dear life. They had but three oars, two of which, ■ having floated near to Jesson and Bornan respectively, wore seized by them as some slight means of aid in their calamity. The other oar.— reached at the same time the hands of both Humphries and Blanket, whilst to only one of them could it be of the slightest use. Then, in that boiling sea, those. two men acted towaxda each other with such bravery and generosity as have never been surpassed, if indeed equalled, in any age or country. Blanket said to Hum phries, ' Pat, you take the oar; you have a wife and little children. I have no,wife,,no chil dren, am an old man;, never, mind me.' To which Humphries replied, ' No, Blanket; you are old and weak; I. am young and strong. You keep the oar.' Humphries remained with the oar the shortest possible time neces sary te enable him to get his clothes off, and then darted away, leaving it with Blanket. Nothing but their glorious heroism had those two men in common. One an aboriginal native of New Zealand, between 60 and 70 years of age; the other a young Australian, of European parentage, of but 29 years. After three hours' battling with the see, Humphries lauded about three or four miles north of North Head. Bornan landed about 20 minutes after Hum phries, and Blanket 15 minutes after Bornan—all near the same place; but, alas! poor old wasnever seen more. It was late at night before we at Watson's Bay learned of the safety of three of the men; meantime the vnreu of too absent ones (they were all but Blanket nmmea ... men) watched the sea from the oliffs mta ML indescribable intensity of anxiety.
