QUIZ'S MODERN RECITER.* The Burial of the Old Hospital Boakd. Not a dium was heard, not a funfra! note As its corpse the Executive hurried ; Not a Minister wore a long black coat As the Hospital Board was buried.

They thought ss they holloaed its narrow bed, And smoothed down its lonely pillow, Thfltt Hyoes would be dancing a jig o'er its head, Like the gambolling free of the billow.
