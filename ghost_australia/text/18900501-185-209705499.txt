The first match of the season between the Holy Ghost College and Grenville College football teams took place yesterday on the Saxon paddock. Shields captained the farmer, and Skewes the latter. The game from the onset was decidedly one-sided, the H.G. team running rings round their opponents, iiotwithstmuling the able assistance of several of the Victoria’s most. prominent players. Within - the first five minutes’ of play M'Manainny placed a well-directed goal to the credit of his side. From this out the ball was never seen near the H.G. College goal. M’Leaa was certainly the head of the 40 very ably assisted by J. Donaghuy, Fields (who, it may be said, kept his men well miller subjection), Dowling, M’Manainny (2), .' mitliwick, Stratton, and Mooney; in fact, the whole team played remarkably well so early ill the season. The Grenville for their size and weight performed wonderfully well, and though badly beaten played an uphill game with great credit to themselves. Skewes (capt.), Mllntosh, Lamb, Graham, and Walton were the leading players on the Grenville side. The final result was:—Holy Ghost College, Three goals and 12 behiuds to uil.
