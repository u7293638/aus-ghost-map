VICTORIA TIIEATRE. Mr. G. C. MIiln's " Lacbeth." â€¢ PE?HArs the most difficult character in an actor's repertoire of Shakespearian rdles is that of Macbeth, and of all it is the most easy to criticise. The border-line between nature and exaggeration is so faint that an actoir essaying the part, even though he be familiar with it, having his words "learn'd and conn'd by rote," is liable in many places to overstep the boundary and convert whatis, it may be, thie most educational and moral of plays to a mere surplusage of words and ranting actions. We were glad to see, at the theatre last night, tha; Mr. Miln, who re opened for a brief season after a trip to Mait land, came from the fire untouched. His performance of the Thane of Cawdor adds one snore item to his list of successes. The well known and often-quoted passages in the play were given with much effect. The dagger scene, the banquet scene with Banquo's ghost, and many, other points were scored, and were given' with an effect that called forth the rapturous applause of the audience, which, doubtless owing to the threatening weather, was not large. Fre quent recalls also testified their appreciation. The Lady Macbdth of. Miss Kate Douglas gave evidence of careful study, but the part was somewhat too heavy for the lady. Mr. J. P. West is to be congratulated upon his successful performance as Macduff, which part he played with much ability. Mr. J. B. A.thohoodd as Banquio, Mr. J. JI Welsh as Duncan, and Mr. A. IE. Greonaisay each did goodi.orkin their respective parts, and the three wvitches, represented by Messrs. R. Groville and M. Behan and Miss Jowett, were foreboding enough to satisfy the most ardent admirers of all thlat is hideous. During the evening the orchestra performed several selections, and secured deservedly loud applause. Tonight Mr. Miln will, by request, repeat his scholarly and original in terpretation of " Hamlet."
