I sat nlouc with my conscience In a placc where time lijvil ceased, Anil we talked of iny former living In tlie Innd were the years increased ; And 1 felt that I should have to answer The questions it put to me. And to face the answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Were alive with a terrible might; And the vision of all my past life T . Was an nwful thing to face, 5Alone with my conscience sitting, In that solemnly silent place. And 1 thought of a far-away warning, Of a Borrow what was to be mine ; In a land that then was the future And now is the present time : And I thought of my former thinking, Of the judgment day to be; But sitting alone wi(h my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And 1 wondered if there was a future To the land beyond the grave. llut no one gave me answer ' And no one can come to save ; Then I felt that the future was present. And the present would never go by, For it was but the thought of my past, life Grown into eternity. Then 1 woke from my timely dreaming .And the vision passed away, And 1 knew that the far-away warning Was.ft warning of yesterday; And I pray that 1 mny not forget it In this land before the grave, That I may not cry out in the future And no one come to save. And so I have learnt a lesson Which I ought to lmvc known before, And which, though 1 learnt it dreaming, I hope to forget 110 more. So I sit alone with my conscience In the place where the years increase, And 1 try to think of the future, In the land where time will cease ; And I know of the future judgment How dreadful soe'er it be, That to sit alone witemy conscience Will be judgment enough for inc.
