This shop belongs to Mr. James Conlan, her brother- in-law. The family at once went to work, and with the assistance of constable Paget and Mr. Doyle, the pound- keeper, succeeded in extinguishing the fire. The shop, however, was much damaged and the bellows destroyed. The tools also are somewhat injured. It is fortunate that that there was no wind at the time, or the wheelwright's shop adjoining must have caught fire, whence the flames would haxe extended to John Conlan's dwelling.—Satur- day's Goulburn Herald.
