The Christian Brothers- Preaching in Newry Cathedral recently on behalf of the Christian Brothers' schools of the town, Rev. J. B. Harrimersley, O.P., drew a striking comparison between them and the schools conducted by the National Board of Education in Ireland. The reason of their superi ority over 'the latter was, , he said, very simple. A Christian Brother was a- man in whose ear the Holy Ghost one day whispered, "He who instructs others unto justice shall shine like a star in the firmament of heaven." That young man then resolved within himself to abandon the world and to seek the institute where those prophetic words of the Spirit of God were fulfilled to the letter. Oh, what the Christian Brothers had done for this country ! What they had done " since they were established in the fair city of Waterford under the guidance of that ever to be revered Mr. Rice ! They had counteracted the evil effects of the National Board system of education, for undoubtedly that system was introduced into Ireland for no other purpose than to banish and to exterminate from the minds and the hearts ot the Irish, children not only, religion, but every spark of patriotism and nationality. The Council Chambers of America, Aus tralia, even of this country to-day resounded with Irish eloquence, which was imbued into the minds of the> Irish youth at the knee of the Christian Brother. The Christian Brothers had done their duty nobly and well, and the parents should now come forward and fulfil their engagement.
