It j was suggested, in opposition to this view of the matter, that this very doctrine was the cause of the lapsing. The logical outcome of this doctrine is vividly expressed in the accompanying extract, which is from the second series of sermons by the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon :— he There is a real lire in hell as truly as you have now a reai body—a fireexactly like that which we have on earth in everything except this, that it will not consume, though it will torture you. When thou dlest thy soul will be tormented alone—that will be a hell for it, but—at the Day of Judgment thy body will joiu thy soul, and then thou wilt have twin hells, body and soul shall be together, oaeh brimful of pain, the soul sweating in its inmost pores drops of blood, and thy body from head tofoot suffused with agony : conscience, judgment, memory, all tortured ; but more, thy head tormented with rat-king pains, thine eyes starting from their sockets with sighs of blood aud woe : thine ears tormented with - sullen moans and hollow groans and <hrieks of tortured ghosts,' thine heart beating higher with fever, thy pulse rattling at an enormous rate in* agony, thy limbs cracking like the martyrs in the Gre, and yet unbnrned : thyself put in a vessel of hot oil, pained, yet nndestroyed • all thy veins becoming a road for the hot feet of pain to travel on; every nerve a string on which the devil shall ever play his diabolical tune of Hell's Unutterable Lament."
