Who should you think is the oldest actor in England, and how old should you guess he is? Well,his name is Mr. James Doel, and he was born on July 13,1803. So, you see, he is just over 90. He keeps the Prince George Hotel at Stonehouse, and is a sprightly, hale, old gentleman, and and wears a suit of Scotch tweeds, a white silk necktie with a big horse-shoe pin in it, and a wig, and he played the first Grave-digger to Edmund Kean's Hamlet, and first Witch to Macready's Macbeth, and Fathom when Sheridan Knowles was Master Walter, and Jacques to Fanny Kern ble* s Juliana. It sounds like a pro- cession of ghosts, but Mr. James Doti is very much alive indeed, and criticises with ability and zest Mr. Irving and the modern school. He says of Irving : '* He is so different from my style that I cannot settle down to him." And of the school he says : " The great actors of my day wera not the scholars you now have on the stage, hut they were more natural." But about Ellen Terry he is enthusiastic ««Ellen Terry? Yes. What a lovely actress she is. Great enough to make the fortune of any theatre."
