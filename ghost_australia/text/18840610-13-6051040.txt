the issues shall be dealt with - 1 Federation Crown Lands Hail nay Construction I striking" Institutions Amendment of the Licensing Act Amendment of the Factory Act Marine Board Metropolitan Board of

enthusiasm worthy of the historic occasion It his fallen to the lot of a le ton in to champion the federal al cause, and the Legislature,' we may hope, will so act as to inspire and encourage our allies The domestic legislation may seem dull after this brilliant commencement, but it is both solid and debate able 'The Crown Lands Bill will be argued with eagerness, formal theorists are in arms and the Railway Bill necessarily involves much of discussion Any amendment of the Licensing Act is sure to take the direction of further restricting the trade in liquors, but the diversity of opinion as to details is great As to the amendment of the Factories Act, it will, we presume, be founded upon the ex idence taken by the Shops Commission, and not upon the eccentric conclusions of that erratic body Of the other measures, we need only say that the bill dealing; with banking institutions will attract keen attention, and that any weeding out of justices of the peace who are neither useful no ornamental will meet with general favour What is omitted from Governor's speech is often as important as what is included therein And in this instance, politicians will scan the document curiously to ascertain whether the tariff report is or is not to be dealt with At this eleventh hour it is tolerably safe to predict that nothing will be found by the members of the commission to justify the hope that the Government mean to adopt the recommendations it would be idle to affect surprise at this decision 'The report has found favour in no man s eyes The term " tinkering' has justly been up plied to the scheme as a whole those who would encourage the face and strong growth of native indus it was so disgusted by the new but done it is sought to impose, while, on the other hand, the advocates of the policy of requiring native industries to support artificial trades, see in every remission of duties evidence of a malevolent design As both sections of the Cabinet and the draught nauseous, the conclusion appears to be to let it alone We shall hope, however, that the labours of the Commission will hear some good faith The progress report condemning the stock tax is a weighty page of reason line, and it is signed on its merits and not as a compromise, by protectionists and freetraders alike The complaints. the fellmongers as to the failing trade has also called attention to the injury indicted on local industries by the tax, and people are beginning to feel that if there is to be any approach to Australian army, the first step is to get rid of these internal imposts Under the circums.tances, we may trust that if the Ministerial programme is silent on the subject, some private member will take the kept al of the stock tax in hand, and will push the issue to the desired conclusion His warmest supporters will be prominent members of the protectionist party and leaders in the Cabinet The 'Tariff Commission is strongly represented in the House, and we may anticipate some keen criticism consequent on the omission of reference to their report 'the M misional defence could be easily pictured, but it will be time enough to deal with attack and apply when both have been delivered Taking I the programme as a whole, it may be said that if the Government can pass the measures we have indicated, and in the order we have stated, we shall be able to congratulate Pallin mont at Christmas upon a brilliant declining and a useful end Probably but for his strong and singular opinions on the relations between the Empire and the Colonies, Mr

followed almost as a matter of course, but it may be shrewdly inferred that his Honor would have preferred the old active life of the bin and the Legislature The Lain to the community was great, however, for an eminent judge was obtained in place of a politician who was apt to die in extraordinary dreams and to be hold i oral kable visions The grievance his Honour has last ventilated must be pronounced to be as Iheoictic and fanciful as any of the long list of its shadowy predecessors The " Distinctions passed under the " Royal sign manual and signet to the Governor require the Governor, when the death sentence has been passed, to call for a report on the case from the sitting judge, and to take the advice of the Executive Council the son, but His Excellency is at liberty to dissent

wicked addresses delivered by noble Louis in the Imperial Parliament which no one here lies the head And as a judge, he intimates that the instruction in question has no real " authority,' and that if he is asked by the Governor (or Acting Governor) to forward a report on the Morgan case he will refuse to do any such improper thing Here it will be seen are all the elements of one of those constitutional, and entirely unnecessary bioiK which his Honour was wont to dearly love His sentences have the old man about them 'they are written, it is evident, at white heat Nothing would have

doing so with a " full knowledge of his constitutional " responsibility ' With these remarks it is impossible not to contest Since his Honour's time in politics, many things have happened There has been a famous Embassy begging Great Britain to interfere in our do mestic allan-, and those who opposed that mission did so not because the proceeding was illegal or improper, but because it was (as the event proved) inopportune and unnecessary what his Honour's feelings must have been at that juncture it is difficult to imagine Thumbsciews and the lion boot would probably have inflicted lesser tor times than Mr. lil m s proceedings 'Ihocouespondenco is proof of recovery from the silent horror of those scenes, but we shall be surprised if his Honour finds many others besides himself ready

reason why Ministers should not advise in these matters as in others Here Mnusteis always have advised, and the Governor and the Government have never been in collision 'The instruction complained of by his Honour may be objected to as surplusage for as the G'qvoi nor is not an automaton, the power of rejecting advice on his own responsibility and at his own peril attaches to his position but, it unnecessary, the clause is also harmless H will be quite time enough, at any late to complain of the of vision when mischief occurs under it, and we mistake the temper of the community if there is any

The Australian pressed his suit with the)ounglady, and finally induced her to elope with him, and they were duly married Soon after the elopement the ) young lady's dead body was found in a pond on her father s estate The head was battered in in a by that might have been caused by a violent suicidal plunge into the pond, or by a single heavy blow with a blunt, broad instrument in the hands of another person About the time the body was discovered, Shortland, it was reported, lost Devonshire, having told several persons before the discovery that his professional en engagements made it necessary for him to return at once to Australia, It was generally supposed that Mrs. Shortland had become morbid by brooding over her estrangement from her father, and the lone prospective absence of her husband after so brief an experience of married life, and had committed suicide in a fit of despondency 'lins v Levy was confirmed by a letter received from Shortland soon after the finding of the body. It was dated Brindisi, Italy, where 1 European voyagers take the Oriental Navigation Company's steamers for Levant, the Suez Canal, and Australia. The letter was full of loving messages to Mrs Short land, and stated that the writer had had a successful voyage thus far, and was about to embark from Brindisi for Australia This letter completely failed all suspicions which might be entertained, and the coroners jury found a verdict of Mrs Shortland's coming to death by suicide to-day however, Shortland was recognised at PI) mouth, and as it was evident he could not possibly have returned from Australia it he had sailed at the time he had stated in his Brindisi letter, an investigation was begun It was soon ascertained that he had never left 1 England at all since his marriage, and had written the Brindisi letter at Plymouth, and sent it under cover to a friend at Brindisi, having it remained there in order to cover his tracks Shortland was promptly arrested, and taken back to Devonshire for trial [A recent cable message informed us that on being brought before the Bench the charge against Shortland was withdrawn, and he was discharged from custody) ] " Questions of precedence, ' our London correspondent writes, on May 2, "have to be weighed with almost as much meet) in A lemons chambers, At Westminster, as at Court.
