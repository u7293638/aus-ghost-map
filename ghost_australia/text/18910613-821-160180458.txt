PROPHETIC. When lovely worn,in to the polls shall flock, And their souls are steeped in mining stock, Their tender hearts transformed to rock, There'll bo no need of a cradle. For Criminal Courts and lawyer's tomes, And Parliamentary speeches 'neath capitol domes, Are not conducive to nappy homes, And the swaying, swinging cradle. There'll be no time for tbis hurrying host To dream o'er the memories of the love they have lost, Or to look for that swiftly vanishing ghostâ€” The ghost of the swinging cradle. For there'll be no homes in that coming time, A t hotel or restaurant each will dine, When the coming woman shall draw the line At The Socking Of The Cradle.
