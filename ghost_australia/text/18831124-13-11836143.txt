The work is by permission dedicated to the Queen, and was performed for the first time at the Burning ham Triennial Music Festival, 1882, when the composer himself was the conductor 'The price paid for the work by the Festival Committee was Â£4 000 The scene in Birmingham on Redemption morning, as it was generally called has been described in the Musical Times as being one of extraordinary and absorbing excitement -"The approaches to the Town hall were so thronged that it was with the utmost difficulty any person not going to the Festival could make his way through the crowd , in the building itself there was not standing room, many visitors who had come from a distance . . preferring rather to secure tickets with a knowledge that no seat could be provided for them than to return without hearing the work. The rule for bidding applause during the sacred performance did not prevent M. Gounod from receiving an ovation on entering the orchestra to conduct the oratorio, but this cordial demonstration to a well tried artist was hushed as if by magic when the first notes of the work were heard, and the eager audience became at once transformed into a reverential con tregation It was in the autumn of 1867, the author tells us that he first thought of composing a musical work on the Redemption He wrote the words at Rome, where he passed two months of the winter 1807 8 with his friend Hubert the celebrated painter, at that time director of the Academy of France Of the runic he then only composed two fragments -1, The march to Calvary in its entirety, 2, the opening of this first division of the third part-The Pentecost twelve years afterwards he finished the work which had so long been interrupted, with a view to its being performed at the festival at Birmingham, in 1882 We quote from the author a own commentary as a guide to the reader in forming an idea of the scope and aim of the composition The work is a lyrical setting forth of the three great factory which depends the existence of the Christian church.
