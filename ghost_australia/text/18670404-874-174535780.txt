Mr. Bindon. WE have been silent on the subject of this gentleman for a week. Indeed, we would not now allude to him—for we have no tidings of a cheering character to convey to our readers—but for the fact that a contemporary, who has become defunct since our last, has committed him to our consideration and care. The Spectator, before giving up the ghost, expressed a flattering opinion of us as perfectly co'mpetent to look after him; but if it meant that we had sufficient influence with"hini to be able to keep him in a judicious and proper'path, it overrates our powers. We have been daily, nay hourly, in hope that he will relent in the matter of his contributions to our pages, and consent once more to resume them; but up to the hour of our going to press he has made no sign. The deputation of the Bindonian magistracy came off as arranged; but whether it was they did not look well in the aggregate, or that his colleagues—and we fear he has a sorry life of it amongst them— have forbidden him to supplement his income by writing to Punch, we know not. All we know is he was very morose, almost uncivil. He said " he would think over it." We have not yet, however, given up hope.
