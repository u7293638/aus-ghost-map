A Negro Deputy. M. Legitimus, the new Socialist Deputy for Guadeloupe, is a negro. According to the "Matin," he dresses in the very latest fashion, wearing silk hat, patent leather shoos, white necktie, and irreproachably cut frock coat. This, it appearsj is indis pensable for- any candidate whoso ambition it is to represent the* dusky electors of Guadolope. M. Lcgitimus’s only sartorial peculiarity is the wearing of: A voluminous flaring red neckerchief, wliicli does duty os tho banner of his : political opinions. It is more curious to learn that the Fronch“black man” believes in ghosts, and 'is, indeed himself much honored in his own country as a sorcerer. When about to''be elected n member of the General’ Council of Guade loupe, M. Legitimus performed extraordin ary terpsichorean and vocal feats" by moon light in a cemetery, whereby the Evil One was vanquished and the performer's, election assured. M. Legitimus owes, his election to the school teachers of Guadeloupe, who are not Clericals, but Socialists.
