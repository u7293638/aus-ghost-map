THE OLD CATHEDRAL ORGANISTU 'Tis forty years ago since first I climbed these dusty, winding stairs, To plsy the Dean in : how I spurned Beneath my feet all meaner oares. When first I leant, my cheek on fire, And looked down blushing at the choir. Bendel, and Haydn, and Mozart— I thought they watched me as I played ; ; While Palestrina's stern, sad face Seemed in the twilight to upbraid; . Pale fingers moved upon the keys — The ghost-hands of past centuries. . Behind my oaken battlement Above the door I used to lean, And watch, in puffing crimson hood,. Come etately sailing in the Dean ; On this, the organ, breathing low, Began to murmur soft and slow. I UBed to shot my eyfes, and hear The solemn prophecy and psalm Rise up like incense ; and I loved Before the prayer the lull and calm, Till like the stream that bursts its banks, Broke forth brave PnrcelTs 'O give Thanke,' ' I know those thirteen hundred pipes And thirty stops, as blind men do The voices of the friends they love, The bird's song, and the thunder too ; . And the fierce diapason's roar. Like storms upon a rocky shore. And now to-day I yield me up The dusky seat, my old loved throne,-. Unto another ; and no more Shall come here in the dusk alone, Or in the early matin hour, To hear my old friend's voice and powers. And yet methinks that centuries hence,. Lying beneath the chancel floor, In that dork nook I shall delight To hear the anthems swell onoe more And to myself shall softly smile, When music floods the vaulted aisle,. Or, mocking gravely at some hand Less skilful than my own waa once,. In my snug nest I'll lie, and mark The blunders of tbe foolish dance ) Bat to myself the secret keep, And turn me round again to sleep. —Chambers's Journal.
