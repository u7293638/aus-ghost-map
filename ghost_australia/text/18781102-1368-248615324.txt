Ohailea Halliday, the son of a British civil . servant of high standing, was an e Oxford bachejor of mueic.

This bequest, 6 a few yeats ofluxuriously {esthetic tlce, oal spent a la mods in eveiy European capital, had sufficed to scatter. On reaching en what he then .imagined to be .the very nadir of hft luck, he determined to emigrate to Australia—there to find,as so many others of the same stamp as of- himself have' found, a deeper, fouler nadir, if science will permit the expression.- The nadir which Charles Halliday at^in^d.to in AuBtjralia.was this: it was M^^cf^m (byhim^elf) to fatlipi^iiei inj^ the I H$hat«B«reB gifted, and i Into forgetfulness of Honour, Love, Duty to God, their neighbour, and themselves Deadens the intellect, destroys the will, Andttaiimsa soul!" ^H^dayOT^dn^rbrg Midhejrojdd.
