We recently received a ioonuhaiiieattoa in which the writer Bays, ** I:was iftfraid to' cat' Did he fancy his £obd'*^poi«oiied, or did his nature rebel 'against the iaoarishment lived on? . If the flatter, why? - Let him clear the mystery iumeelf. - HesavB, *' In the year 1S89 I changed my twbn from railway porter to signalman. Il-bad 'been Signalman twelve months, and ;$hfen all at once; .so to speak, I did not feel jjnyaelf.1 My month tasted bad, so that .ordinary articles -of diet seemed to lose their flavour ; the palato, to put it in that way, appeared to have nothing to say to them. ?? .One thing was like another, and none was good. My tougno was coated -and furred, with a dark line down the , middle and yellow for round it. My breathe was . offensive and my appetite poor, with pains through the chest and shoulders wbicb were always right before I had eaten anything. .Then I was greatly troubled with -wind. It .would gather so it felt like a rail in my ?ihioat, and act as if it wonld choke' me.' ' We cannot wonder tbat nnder these circumstances oar friend failed to do justice to bis meals; He adds that there was what , be calls ' a pricking 6ea6atioan at his heart, as though it were touched with eome .^harp instrument. Then, again, at times lie w&s; attacked with spasms, tbe agony of which was 150 severe that the sweat rolled ?Off him. ' I dreaded,' he says, ' the ?thought of eating, and many a scanty meal have Tmadetfor hoas afraid to cat. 41 After a time I got into a low, weak, nervous condition, and felt miserable, as if something was going to happen, and this . me to lose a great deal of sleep.' What he means by the fear of 41 some* thing going to happen ' is, of coarse, tbe fear of some-calamity, each as tbe loss of iifl position, his own death, or the death of somebody dear to him. This was due, as he intimates, to tbe impoverished slate of bis blood (the life bearer), his unstrung nerves, and to the brain enfeebled by lack \- of.no urishment. Tbe night of this form of illness is always fall of ghosts and goblins, the creatures ttfa restless and angoremed . imagination. * - - ? 'With great . difficulty,' , he says, *lt stack to 'my work, 'for i had a wife and family depending on me. Bo I struggled on, but what X suffered for over two years Is past my powcre of description. / avt sure -no one has suffered so much as I hare doHc.' In the latter statement he is undonbtedly wrong. One's own pain is always harder to but than is ooe's notion of his neigh- , boor's pain. There is a countless multitude who are all the while gomg through the same wretched, experience, only we don't happen to come in -touch with them. Well, the writer finally mentions that after all medical treatment had left him where it found him he chanced to read in a book of a case exactly like hi * can having been cured by Mother SeigcV6 Byrup. . «.'^£y. wife,' he says, '-got-inea bottle at Mr.Langs tuffs, -in WoodJesford, and 'after using its contents tbe ailment left me and has never returned once that fortunate day. I should like the whole world to know what it did for me. I have been employed by the Midland Railway Company for eleven years. (Signed) .
