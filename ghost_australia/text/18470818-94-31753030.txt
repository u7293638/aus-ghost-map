New Zealand. FIRST CONSECRATION OF A CATHOLIC BISHOP. (From our Correspondent.) The Right Rev. Dr. Collomb, who had recently spent a few weeks In Sydney, and who had been appointed by the Holy See to succeed the venerated Bishop Epalle, was consecrated in the neat wooden Church of SS. Peter and Paul, at Kororaradica, Bay of Islands, on Pentecost Sunday. The Bishop elect went into retreat on the feast of the Ascention, and spent the succeeding days in spiritual exercises, preparing, like the Apostles, for the coming of the Holy Ghost, whom he was to receive by the im- position of hands at his Episcopal Consecration. The Right Rev. Dr. Viard, Coadjutor Bishop of New Zealand, assisted by the Very Rev. Pere Baty, Vicar-General, and the Rev. Pere Rozat, performed the solemn rite of consecreation, the Apostolic Bull having first been read by the Secretary, the Very Rev. Petit Jean. The Consecrator then delivered an instructive sermon to a large congregation, con- sisting both of Protestants and Catholics, upon the unity, perpetuity, and Apostolical character of the Episcopal office. The ceremony commenced at ten, a.m., and was not concluded until one. The new Bishop, after his consecration, baptised three childien, born of English parents, and ad- ministered the sacrament of confirmation to three adult New Zealanders who had become converts to the Catholic faith. His Lordship seems to have entered with the spirit of the Apostles upon his ar- duous duties, and to have determined upon oflering himself as a holocaust to promote the glory of God and the salvation of his fellow-men, among the be- nighted heathen of the South Sea Islands. On the 5th of June he sailed for New Caledonia, where he will tarry for a few weeks and he will then depart for the Island of San Christoval, which, with the neighbouring islands, is to be the sphere of his future labours.
