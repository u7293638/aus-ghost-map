Constable Murphy stated that about half-past 8 o'clock on the previous evening he met the woman standing with several other people in Union street, Tighe's Hill. When he ap proached she told him to take care of her, as she could not go home. She talked of ghosts, and said her house was full of men. Dr. Harris said he had examined the defendant, and was of opinion that her mind was deranged from ex cessive drinking. He thought it would not be safe to liberate her, unless someone was told off to watch her for two or three days.
