Fools and their Money. Fools and money are proverbially said to be soon parted, and an excellent illustration of this is to be found in the rise and fall of a certain quack, by name Louis Crespin, who has been selecting the Department of Gers, in France, of the held of his operatiions. M. Crespm professed to have almost unlimited powers in cutting the ills to which man and beast are heir, and so great was the confidence he inspired that lie had consulting rooms in jnost of the towns in the department, attend ing, moreover, at all the fairs, to which he vras driven in his own carriage and pair. On an unlucky day for him, however, it chanced that a certain wealthy peasant, came to consult him about the illness of n pig. The animal, according to the quack, was possessed of the devil, and to remedy matters the peasant was told that he must pay a certain sum of money to have musses celebrated. This the credulous client did, und the pig getting no better, a matter of another 400f. went from its owner's pocket into the clinrln tioa's hands. Still the grantor remained in j nn alarming state of health, and at length it ! gave up the ghost. The peasant exasperated i at the loss of the pig, and at the loss of his ! money as well, lodged a complaint with the ] police, in consequence of which M. Louis ! Crespin has been arrested on a charge of ! swindling. For some time to come, therefore j he will probnbly be unable to ride about in i &IS; carriage and pair. |
