THK ORIGIN OV 'JOE.' TO THK EDITOR OF THE ' GYSIPIE TIMES.' Rm, ? Could von, or any of your numumna cor respondents, 'inform me what is tho nrisin of the term 'Joe?' Is it a term of contempt pe.rulinr to disgirsis, or is it more widely used? T never heard it uaed, inVa prpsent iicceptntinn. »'.«., as h term of contempt, till I enme to Gympi', but I nm nwnve it hns been applied by the miners ol this uoldfield and its dependencies »n very obnoxious individunls since Gympie begun; nnd like the chronic rolling Bnowhall, kept continually in motion, it seems to be increasing in extent and sienificance as time rollson. Witness the ioeins Bxhibition of Saturday night lnst. ! Why it would suffice to hnve re-called ' Job' from his grnvp, unleaR that individunl be a mpre myth ? Who on earth advised W. H. Wnlsh, Minister for Works, to vifit Gympie? Tho honourable, gentlemen must linvo been grossly deceivpd. When I heiird the jneing and gronning, I was moved to pity, but whpn afterwards I wns nppriz-'l of that monstrous swindle the cnne.piUtion of Gympie. ns a polling place, I was maddened with rnuo. my sympathy for Mr. Wnl-h. like the ghost of Polydorus. ' vnn ished into the air.' Verily it wns most disurnce fnl to acniteh tho nnmos of the minpra nf Gympie off the Eleetoral Roll, but to scratch Gympie itself off the polling mil was infamous, nye ! tho most bnrefneed piece of trickery nnd trifling ever at temptpd to be perpetrated bv the responsible governors of any country, on the rights and piivi egos of the people. Tho mimes of the tnachina torB (for Bhnme sake I fihall not give these) nf this vile outrage on law nnd equity will be handed dnwn to posterity with execrntion, nnd received with odium as long ns Gympie renninB. But my indignation h»s caused me to prolong and diaress The information sought will oblige your humble 6srvnnt. A MERE DIGGER.
