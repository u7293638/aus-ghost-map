Romance. My lore dwelt in a northern land. ? A 'gray tower in a forest green Was hers, and far op either hand \- The long- wash of &ie; waves was seen, [ And leagues on leagues of yellow eand And woven forest boughs between. And through the silver northern night The snnset slowly died -away, : And herds of Btrange deer, lily-white, Stole forth among the branches 'gia.fi About the coming of the. light The; fled like ghosts before the day ! I know not if the forest green Still girdles round that 'cafe* le gray ; I know not if the boughs between ' ' . The white deer vanish ere the day ; Above my love the grass is green : ' My heart is coider than the clay !
