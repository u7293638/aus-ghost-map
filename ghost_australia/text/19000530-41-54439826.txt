Every .jnan, ??;?? -has ?...., in the , way of fire his '' own' 'likes -' and dis likes,: -writes '!Mr.-rBattersby in a war letter to the 'Morning Post'; ij'ome men always;bab to a bullet; Mothers catch their nraamiar. a yneii; otiiers dread the put:er of a Maxim. It is not a question of timidity or of deadlines-^, but ot }ieri-onil antipathy. Infantry fire is beyond all quest ion most fatal, but many pay 'lis-- heeil to the -whispered whistle of the bullet th-iu to any other cf' tlie flying ioi ms ot' death. There is .a bird out here, a little brown bird like a brambliug, witli a n.Le that evaetly mimic-s the Jlauser, and ;in un tomfortibre habit of fluting it in ugly places. Ttie Lee-iletforil's note is nearly ;i third lower, and the ^Martin; hu.s the dull buzz of a laden be..'. Between the three there can be no inwtakinir. but the Boers have, four or live other riiles harder to re eojjmise. The note varies., no dcubt. wi;-h the riiliufr iind initial velocitv; it varies, too, with the length of flight. The Mauser's nost melodious Iperiod is 1,800 yards; point blank it is nothing but a nasty nasal sneer, but one may b? a poor judge oi melody at close qu-anters. A ' flat-noied or' 'd-un- dunwned'' Mauser prcibablj' makes a sound which one attribute* to *oine unknown rifle, bul the queerest note 01 all comes from a Mauser spinning the wrong way after a riclioi-lidt. It is liko the coughing of a -ick ghost— indescribably curdling, i-'eriuips the'kn-owkd|j3 that at sia-h odd m.uments it will let an int-h of (Ijyliiila throusli c.ne rather adis tj the effe'e-t: Ttie worst 'ar.-l be-t of bul et music i- that omu always hears it b?hii-.'l bue.
