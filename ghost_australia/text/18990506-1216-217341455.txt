Captain Hetchfield, of a German schooner which was ia tte vicinity, succeeded in rescuing some of the natives. The island, he stated!, was completely washed away. Several massacres are reported. At Bismarck Archipelago, at New Ireland, a tradei named Peterson informed Captain Henry, of the Archer, that he had sent two boats down the coast in February. They reached the trading grounde and anchored for the night. Whilst asleep the natives put off in war canoes and captured the boats and massacred the crews. Each boat was m n ed by 11 natives. The bodies were taken ashore and the boats destroyed. At New Britain, some months ago, the little trading ketch Sea Ghost was captured at Nusa by natives, and the whole of the crew massacred. One of the murderers was recently captured at New Britain, tried and sentenced to death. He was shot a few days before the Archer left. The German warship Moewe had started, out from New Britain for Ncea on a punitive expedition in connection -with the same massacre.
