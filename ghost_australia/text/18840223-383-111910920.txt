Dodgerl, judging from. the number of vipes"- he had collected by, stealth; he exhibited' about. a!dozen, including. a ?dark" one obtained from Noah Claypole's, ghost .. Schnapper ,oint was., reached short'y before half past- 12,. a landing! was' speedily effedted, and the:company at once made its way to' the reserves, the hotels, etc., where they proceededfto dine..

Go-aesybu please race :brought out a goodly number of contestanuts, each of whom seemed to be cared for most attentively by his !trainer," the-same causing a deal of amusement each time " the bottle". was brought into requi sition to either. moisten the runner's parched lips, or cool his: heated, face and body.; Whilst contesting one of the"Buf fere" races 'Mr. Linay unfortunately fell and shortly afterwards . exhibited the ! gravel rash" on his face. . The High Jump. resolved itself into a contest between Mr. Seaton Williams and Mr.:A. Opray.

Dancing in the pavilion was kept up during the afternoon with much vigour to the intense enjoyment of the ladies. At.5.o'clock the' Golden Crown was on her.return trip. The .wind, having changed during the afternoon, ruffled: the blue,. placid .waters of Hobson's Bay, and soon several of the company were seized-with nial de;mer., It commenced its attack 'upon; the children,-then the-ladies, and next thbe 'froosters ;"- and. soon the. 'Golden Czown.was made a ,hospital ship." A chemit'e face lengthened as he told how -hewould-lose money bythei bile beingthus freely 'parted with:?,A imember of. the committee ;was :perhaps,:the greatest suf ferer; mournfully! requesting not' to- be touched, but leftk,to die.: -:Even our critic parted :with most of his: paragraphs to the scribes of the ..fmaidP.iPressu One lady sufferer,. oni being requested to mind- her bat, which was: in danger:of going -over board;,replied most woefully, ! Let~it go 1" Most of the company.ihowever *ere'-un affected, consequently dancing and other amusements were.kept in fall swing.. i On nearing Sandridga-we:beg the inhabitants' pardon,. Port Melbourne- the 'wind fell, and soon the company recovered its woited jollity. :. The National Anthemiwas sung on nearing the pier, rand without loss of time all.were, speedily landed and safely; seated in the train for Melbourne, Prahran being reached, about 8 p.m. As an outing and holiday, the excursion proved.extremely en joyable, and, but for the little roughness of the return trip, nothing. occurred ;to mar the..'day's recreation, .Fortunately, the committee .had the foresight to.request 'that some police, officer: should. accompany .the vessel, and accordingly Sergeant O'Donnell and Constable: O'Connor were on .board. Previous. to.starting they observed" one or two :' sharpers'. or spielers," who.. on noticing:.the officers of the law speedily decamped, ;One of the scoundrels was-a noted thief, being most expert in relieving people of. their: watches. :For ;their fore sight :in.this matter, and the,:excellent manger ,in'which .-they carried out. the arrangbmerits of the day, the committee of the club :deserve ,:the heartiest thanks of all. ..,Anongestthe prizes given was a silver medal.by Mr W, Davies, a tRn'pf wood by Mr Dunham, an egg cap. by .:Mr A I.
