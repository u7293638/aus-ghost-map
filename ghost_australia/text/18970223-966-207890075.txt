SOUTH AUSTRALIAN CRICKET, TO THE EDITOR. Sir—Now is the time to take the bull by the horns. South Australia at the present time is in a very sick state as regards first-class cricket, and she urgently requires some medicine, so to speak, to endeavour to restore her to her usual cricketing status. Now, Sir, my prescription is this—As we are on the ere of meeting Victoria I beg of the chosen eleven to unanimously elect Mr. J. J. Lyons or Mr. J. Reedman as captain of the team,- and then I think, with a little ordinary tact, we shall give Victoria a good thrashing. Indeed it would be a pleasure to see South Australia win one match this season,: but I am afraid that if Mr. Gifien is elected captain we shall not stand a ghost of a chance. And in conclusion considering that we have shaped so badly this season I think sixpence is quite sufficient charge for admission to the ground. I am, Sir, &c..; MEDICINAL.
