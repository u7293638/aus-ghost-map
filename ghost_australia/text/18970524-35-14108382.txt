THE ARCHBISHOP'S' REPLY TO THE POPE. in The Papal Bull, named from its opening words Apotlohctc ear IT, which was issued in September last by Pope Leo Mil was (says the J met) an emphatic pronouncement by the Court of Rome against the validity of Anglican orders Nothing else was seriously expected by men of sense, and it may be doubted whether a different decision would have opened the door for an) real possibilities of reconciliation and union But the arguments on which the Pope based his condemnation of the Church of England were in the opinion of able and learned theologians open to complete and easy refutation In a memorandum penned just before his death, Archbishop Benson congratulated the Church on the fact that " Infallibility bad this time ventured on reasons " The Papal Bull has now been met with a j formal answer signed by the Archbishop of Canter- bury and the Archbishop of York, in which its statements are dispassionately examined and. as most English Churchmen will agree, are satisfactorily disposed of The tone of this interesting document is dignified and temperate There is no sign of the odium theologicum The genial spirit displayed in the Pope's utterances is met with equal benignity and good feeling But the Archbishops have a great cause to detest 1 The clergy of the Church of England are convinced that their orders are, in all essentials of matter, form, and intention, identical with and derived from those of the primitive Christian Church The Church of Home can claim no higher origin When the Roman see impeaches the validity of Anglican orders the burden of proof rests upon it Leo MU substantially admitted this when he undertook to show how the Anglican rite was defective, and the reply of the Archbishops, therefore, goes to the root of the matter when It exhibits the irrelevancy, the inadequacy, and the inexactitude of the Papal assertions and conclusions The two sides of the case are now presented to the world in the most elaborate and exhaustive Â«a) The controversy, however, cannot be carried further, since, in the Papal Bull, " Infallibility " has pronounced as its final judgment that ordinations under the Angli- can rite " have been and are absolutely null and utterly void " It is shown, Indeed in the reply of the Archbishops that the Pope's deCision in danger ously double-edged It strikes not only at Anglican orders but at those of the Oriental Churches, and, if its tests be strictly applied, the orders of the Roman Church itself would appear to be placed in pens The arguments of the Archbishops are embodied in a letter composed in ecclesiastical Latin, and accessible, therefore, to every Roman Catholic priest, which is addressed not alone to our venerable brother Pope Leo XIII " but to all the bishops of the Catholic Church We presume that, in spite of its challenge to the verdict of ' Infallibility ' this letter will not be placed on the Index and we may be tolerably sure, at any rate, that the Pope, who has a keen interest in theological controversy, will read it himself. It is necessarily a document of a highly technical character The grounds on which the Pope based his condemnation of ordinations according to the Anglican rites were mainly technical, and the Archbishops have to point out the errors in factor the lapses in reasoning that nullify his conclusions Probably) most churchmen do not concern themselves greatly about the points on which the Pope did so much stress, but many would be troubled in conscience If they were allowed to rest under the belief that the allegations of the Papal Bull was a c1! founded The Archbishop's letter will set at rest the anxieties of this latter class It exhibits all the theological erudition and all the acquaintance with ecclesiastical history that can be demanded in a document of such authority It goes far to nullify the effect of the Papal Bull and proves clearly that, if the Anglican rite of ordination is to be held invalid for the reasons given, the gravest doubt must be cast upon all other orders, including those of the Church of Horne itself The Pope's coronation turns upon two points, the practice of the Church of time and the form of the Anglican rites, including the question of intention With regard to the former n at the practice of the Roman Church in the sixteenth century, after the Anglican Church had gone its own way. there is the greatest uncertainty, and, as the Archbishops pay, the Pope himself is as uncertain as they are themselves. The co ordination of priests ordained in the reign of Edward VI or of his father was by no means universal under Mary, though it was the general policy of Pole 'The later case of Gordon, a Jacobite Scotch bishop, who became a Roman Catholic in 1701, is equally doubtful and even more obscure in the absence of documentary evidence Yet the Papal case has no other support so far as it rests upon the uniform and authoritative practice of the Church It is important, furthermore, to remember that the old historic line of attack was abandoned in the Papal Bull No more is heard of the Nag's Head legend and the unfitness or disqualification of the prelates who laid hands on Parker The continuous laying on of hands by persons deriving their orders from bishops undoubtedly ordained and con- secrated according to the practice of the Catholic Church at the time in itself goes far to establish the fact of legitimate succession The Pope contends that the changes made after the Reformation in the Anglican city of ordination have been fatal to its spiritual efficacy This i low is contested at great length by the Archbishops They are quite successful in showing that the Pope had not thoroughly mastered the nature of the Anglican ceremonial If that be so the judgment of " Infallibility " upon the inadequacy of the Anglican rite is not to be accepted without question, even from the Roman point of van The Archbishops argue, with much force, that the variations in the Anglican rite as compared with the modern Roman form do not differ in kind from similar discrepancies that have not been held to invalidate the same or other offices of that Church they m untrue that the words beginning " Receive the Holy Ghost " accompanied by the laying on of bands, confers the general faculties and poor one of priesthood and, as is generally said, imprints the character " This commission is in no way impaired by the supplementing charge to preach una exercise authorities i Christian minister signified by the delivery of the Bible It is true the conception of a priest which pervades the Papal Bull different from that which the Church of England has cultivated, but the essentials of the sacred office are altered the decision of the Pope that Anglican orders confer no spiritual authority at all may be in accordance with the exclusive temper and policy of the modern Church of Rome But the Archbishops have shown that it is not borne out, either locally or historical!), by the arguments that Leo XIII has adduced in support of it. They appeal from this narrow judgment to the whole Christian Church They do so, however, without disparaging in the least degree the admir- able personal qualities of the Pope, or impeaching his good intentions which unfortunately, the tradi- tions of the Papacy doom to defeat
