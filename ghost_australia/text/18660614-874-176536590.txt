The Phantom Engine. LET US no longer conclude that there is nothing of the supernatural in this hard, too-practical country. Read what the Riverine Herald of the other day said:â€” On the departure on Friday of the afternoon train from the Echuca station, a most extraordinary and unprecedented scene took place. As the signal was sounded, an engine came down the line, passing the tram, on which men were observed wearing white hat-bands and white gloves, and who raised a cheer of derision The train started, and no sooner had it done so than a number of explosions took place, much louder than gun or pistol shots, which tookJhe persons assembled on the platform by surprise, and were, no doubt, productive of much alarm to the passengers. We should think these phantoms did take the bystanders by surprise, and we should think the explosions did produce some alarm ! An engine carrying men with white hat-bands and white gloves ! Ghosts of course! and, as it would seem, derisive ghosts ! and, not only derisive but explosive! The Echuca people may try to explain this apparition in accordance with the unpoetic materialism characteristic of the age and the country; but there is little doubt of it boding ill to something or somebody. In fact, something is going to happen, to use the expressive language of sensible people, and the Echucans had better look out, to quote another expressive and possibly vulgar expression. It would not surprise us to hear of Echuca disappearing altogether, when we remember the alarming level to which the mud rose last winter.
