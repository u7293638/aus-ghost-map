i AN" APPARITION.' " : THE public: of Yiepna.b(iyo.,been much .troubled by the story of an' apparition jwhich has lately occupied the news ipapers of the Austrian capital. A 'sentry, posted by night in the lobbies. : jof the Imperial Palace, observed to his jdismay a- female figure, 'enveloped' iii; 'the long folds of a capacious cloakf emerge from-the chambers- of- the late Archduchess Sophia. The: (alarmed soldier, at iouce saved himself, from; intercourse with the ghost by flight, and told his story to his . superior, officer. Without putting faith, in his juarrafcive, the Marshal of the"Court established a watch, and causedr the; lobbies communicating with, the rooirij ;of the mother of the Emperor to be'" occupied by the palace guards?""Next" night the mysterious vision-was'? again; seen by several persons, but vanished almost instantly. Another night the phantom showed itself to a" second' sentry, who fainted iwith terror. Some; days later a new sentry saw the: spectre, approach, but more bold than his corapa.uipns, maintained, his t5(ing. yWmZ,and airtieid a blow ,at it with bayonet. The spectre thereupon took to flight, but,"pursued by the soldier, fell: mortally wounded -by ,,;a .bayonet-.; thrust in the back. The guards' and attendants hastened to the spot-on hearing the , cries i of-the wounded ghost,' and found a beardless; youth',;" who was recognised as a priest. The strangest part of the business is that the court has done its utmost' to im'shf the matter up ; and the soldier whose" bayonet led to the discovery of- the mystery, has been relieved; from ^his sentry duties, and sent, as was said, to . join a distant garrison. The Tagblatt, however, says he has .been put in , a prison, and is now in Solitary confined merit/' "The clerical papers deny that the ghost was a priest; but, on the other hand, it is alleged that ..ho .wjas. one of- the young cbaplains:att'achred' to the paiace, and',, a.. topl-.,of0 thfy Jesuits.
