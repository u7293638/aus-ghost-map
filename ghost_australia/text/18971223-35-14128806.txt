f. ENGLAND IN CHINA. ET SYDNEY HALLIFAX. Are the war dogs to be loose in the East To the band to begin to play, and are the discords of the European Concert to, be borne across the waters of the Yellow Sea ? In other words, can it be that tho-strongestTvp work of conservatism the world has known liasJäwallowcd its pride and 'besonght'tho British " foreign devils " to come in to keep out the other' barbarians who are assem bhngTound theatres ? All these questions and many others are not tired) suggested by the publication of the telegrams from Europe conveying ; the report that China has asked Great Britain to I proclaim, in prob* ctorate over the richest and most thiokly-popnkt'ted portion of the celestial country. The report- is calculated to remind one of the story door to the heart of childhood concerning the Bussrjii sledge driver, who out lose one horse aftor-aaiother to temporarily satisfy the hunger of the wolves if perchance he might escape, though by the plan of his teeth, with his own life and that of his child But in the up-to-date version the territory is Chinese instead of Russian, and the | wolves retain the nationality of the nursery story with an Imperial eagle with " consecrated person " and " crown of thorns " thrown into the pursuit But is-thc-report true ? Well, there is nothing inherently improbable in it" Even previous to the collapse of China before Japan those who knew their Far East freely stated that the parti- tion of China was one of the possibilities of the not defeat future, but they scarcely credited the victim with the consciousness of his fate Years ago Wingrove Cooke is reported to have said '"The whole present system of China is a hollow (thing, with a hard brittle surface we try in vain to scratch it, but some day a happy blow will -shiver- it. It will all go together , a Chinaman has no idea of surrendering a part to save the rest The only question with him is How long can it be resisted how long can it be evaded 5 " " I think," wrote Henry Norman, " China wüL-nlbmately go to pieces under the pressure of the conflicting interests that focus upon her " If the if port of the application for a British pro- electorates on the part of China be true it shows at least that she learnt move from the result of her confer! with Japan than some of her critics gave her credit for The late Mr Pearson, too, the accomplished and able author of " National Life and Character," who was at one time Minister for Education in the neighbouring colony of Victoria, must be numbered among the prophets whose early decease has spared them the revelation " bore down " that " things are not always what they seem" and that the danger of a Chmeso^onquest of Europe was based on such stuff daydreams are made of In the absence of official information it is of course only possible to discuss a matter of such importance from a purely speculative standpoint It is quite possible that the announcement now made is only another instance of political kite- flying, a pastime in which diplomats are wont to indulge On the other hand the concurrent announcement that the Russian Pacific squadron, which has been enormously strengthened of late, is to winter at Port Arthur, and the British Cicifiosquadron at "Wei Karaweera port, by the way, which was occupied by the Japanese during 'the war, and handed back to China under the treaty of peace lends countenance to the suggestion that the development now reported is not so sudden as it looks It may well be that the policy of a enging German missionaries by grabbing the territory of their persecutors in tho name of the gospel of peace instead of by bidding the successors of the Apostles to shale from their feet the dust of the country as a testimony against it, was only dictated at this juncture by the circula- a son of a rumour that there was "something in the wind," which gave to the German St I Michael the opportunity of shaking his mailed fist in tho face of the European Powers, by whom he has been discomfited in diplomacy In short, the recent outburst of Jingoism in Germany is just as likely to have been an effect as a cause Or, again, the recent meeting of the Emperor William and the Czar of Russia may have paved the way for a mutual understanding between the two countries, the suspicion of which has suddenly caused China to awake from her long slumber In support of this theory, it must be freely conceded that England's influence in the Far East has waned considerably of recent years Her policy has lacked the consistency and the continuity of that of her mails A generation ago England alone of the Great Powers of Europe was regarded as supreme in the control of the destinies of the Orient To-day her path is hedged by the bayonets of other Governments, and the splendid isolation " which is the boast of some of her statesman is not an unmixed cause for congratula- tion in violation of her word she has thrown big strips of Siam in the vain attempt to appease the hunger of France, she suffered an unfortunate rebuff in the repudiation of her offer to mediate in the Chino- Japanese war, and, the war concluded, sho TI as at first tricked out of the opportunity of providing the loan for the payment of the Chinese indemnity These things maybe accounted little in Parliamentary elections They may lay fewer votes than a half guinea subscription to a football club, or a guinea donation to a local branch of a missionary society in an English constituency, but they sink deep into the mind of the Oriental, and have more to do with the maintenance or otherwise of English influence than any " item " in the " programmes " of political parties But if English influence has waned in proportion to that of other Powers in the Far East, there is little doubt that Russia, by showing her hand, has caused the dissembling of whatever approach to affection the Chinaman may over have felt toward her Another factor in the situation is the relations between Russia and England On this point it is satisfactory to know that whatever grounds may exist and that they do exist it were folly to deny-for suspicion of Russia on the part of England, Lord Salisbury, whose misfortune it has been over a long part of his career to be allied with a party and to be the instrument of a policy proverbially anti-Russian, has recently made distinct overtures in the direction of a good understanding with Russia, and has publicly recanted his former attitude by saying that English hostility to Russia is now " the ghost of an antiquated diplomacy "It is not, therefore, necessary to exclude the possibility of an understanding with Russia on the subject of the partition of China, should such come to pass The question remains, supposing China to have sought the protection of Great Britain, will it be given ? Assuming the proposal to have been made (and at this stage an official contradiction may just as reasonably, according to the rules of diplomacy, be treated as a confirmation), it is difficult to understand how it could be refused, except at the cost of the beginning of the end of the British Empire The language may sound a exaggerated, but it is used advisedly " Bo Asiatic ' therein lies the future " " It is in Asia once more that will be decided the destinies of the world in Asia will be founded and will increase great empires, and whoever succeeds in making his voice needed in the Far East will be able also to speak in dominating accents to Europe " Thies a distinguished French traveller Moreover, it caustic admitted at once that in the event of England's refusal- i possibility which it seems almost treason to the intelligence of the British Government to suggest- to accept further re- sponsibilities, and to allow China to be divided among her rivals, it is only a question of time, and not a long time either, when the secrets. of her power in Indian would pass away That there will beon outcry in England the fury of which will be out of all proportion to its strength, against the assumption of a protectorate, goes without saying But fortunately "the party of a small England, of a shrunk England, of a degraded England of a neutral England, of a sub- missive England, has died " Moreover, the very district spoken of as the basis of a protectorate is the one above all others which England could least afford to see pass into the hands of a rival "If there is one region in China with which the trade and commerce of our Empire is more closely bound up than-with any other, artistic basin watered by the great river which, descending from the border of our Burmese dominion, flows into the Yellow Sea close to Sh higher, the greatest em portion of British commerce in the Far East Nothing probably would be better calculated to arrest my pinna which may exist elsewhere for hastening on the dismemberment of China, or even to restore a little backbone to China herself, than for us to make it clearly understood that we could under no circum stances allow the valley of the Yang two to pass under the control of another Power " Thus wrote Mr Valentine Church, the special corespondent of the " Times," who tra verted the Far East a year ago In the present aspect of affairs his words sound almost prophetic, and they gain, additional force from the fact that the negation of such a policy would simply mean that the advance of France, which has long wished to drive a wedge between British Burmah and the volley of the Yangtsze-kiang from the south, and of Russia, with her inevitable expansion in the north, would finally squeeze out England altogether. Whether Lord Salisbury is or is not the " strong man " that dwells in the imagination of his more extreme partisans or whether he is after all as Bismarck said, " only [a lath painted to look like iron, it would be out of place to discuss her. Recent criticism against his foreign policy has proceeded mainly from his supporters in the London press, on the ground that he has conceded too much, especially to France. The critics Trill no doubt be only too agreeable disappointed should they find that he has saved a substantial quid pro quo from recent negotiations. Whatever policy the present Foreign Secretary may be personally inclined to favour, his Under-Secretary and spokesman in the House of Commons has as the result of years of travel and of study in the East left no doubt as to his own conception of England's duty. Mr. Curzon, although not in the Cabinet, has possibly more influence than some who are within its sacred portals, and already it has been predicted that there is no office in the State however high to which his abilities may not entitle him to aspire. Says Mr. Curzon in his book " Problems of the Far East : " The Empire of Great Britain, though a European, a Canadian, and an Australian, before all else an Asiatic dominion. We still are, and have it in our hands to remain, the first Power in the East, ... It is only in the East, and especially in the Far East, that we may still hope to keep and-to create open markets for British manufactures. Every port, he continues, every town, and every village that passes into French or Russian hands is an outlet lost to Manchester, Bradford, or Bombay." And by an extension of the argument does it not follow that the interests of Australia are quite as palpably bound up with the supremacy of Britain in the East as the interests of Glasgow, the existence of an Alien Immigra- tion Bill notwithstanding The southern boundary of the proposed protectorate, bordering as it does on Hongkong, is scarcely second in importance to the rest of the geographical limita- tions. The Chinese are an easily governed race. The character of the governed is very much better than that of their present governors. Englishmen, too, have cause to remember with pride that the only effective branch of the public service-the Customs Department in China was organised and is still controlled by a Britisher Sir Robert Hart, and that in Shanghai the wealthy Chinese keenly appreciate the fact that they are far better off under British jurisdiction. The English language, too, is becoming in an increasing degree the language of the Far East. Another consideration not unworthy of note is this. Nations, like individuals, cannot hope to escape from the consequences of opportunities lost or thrown away. In almost every part of the world where Britain is confronted with actual or prospective difficulties in her foreign and colonial policy to-day, they may be traced to opportunities neglected or territories given up in the past. To go no further, take New Guinea, on the one hand, and the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, on the other. And in the event of the report of the proposed protectorate being untrue, is there any reason why it should be other than premature ? In other words, does not the highest statesmanship consist not in a policy of waiting on events, but in that of anticipating the ? So at the present juncture Pray God our greatness may not fail Through craven fears of being great, ~ Wei-hai-wei, the port at which the British fleet is reported to be wintering, is described by " Vladimir " in his " China-Japan War " as a semi-circular bay, whose coasts measure about 18 or 20 miles in length. The entrance is protected by two islands, the Kung, 500ft. high, and about six miles in circumference, and Jill, which is small, and only contains a fort. The water is mostly shallow, but near the western corner of the Kung Island there is excellent anchorage. The large island at the month of the bay naturally forms two entrances ; the eastern is the widest, but has Jih Island in the centre.
