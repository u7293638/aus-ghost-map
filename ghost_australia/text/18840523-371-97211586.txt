ON D I T . The question of processions in Murray street is not yet allowed to drop, and there appears to be as much feeling in the Council as ever. It is extremely doubtful whether, after all the discussion that has taken place, a bylaw will be passed to regu late the processions of the Sal ration Army. To my mind, it seems absurd tbat any one body of people should be allowed to mono nnliso fV.o nj-nrra of the street nearlv everv evening in the week to the annoyance of the inhabitants. Certainly lately there has been a disposition to go round the back streets as well as Murray- street, but this may only continue while there is the ghost of a chance of the bylaw being passed. * * * # Why cannot the Army on Saturday night follow the example set them by the Adelaide corps, that is to march silently down the main-street if they must pass through it. The noise made at present is not at all likely to bring any person out of any house with the intention of being converted, but rather the other way. * o * o Fancy sueing a man for eightpenje ? Certainly it was a test ca*e, and as such deserved all the attention tbat was bestowed upon it by the Bench. But really the question as to who has to pay the threepence charge for collecting cheques was not settled. True the t-.M. pointed out that the proper coirse the Clerk had was to have *ent the cheques back for the extra threepence, but that does not say that the ratepayer would have to pay the extra money. This ie the first case of the kind, but it will serve to make both clerk and ratepayer careful in the future.
