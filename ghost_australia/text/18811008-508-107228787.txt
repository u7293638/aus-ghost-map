A Fight for a Lover. A STORY IN FOUR CHAPTERS. CHAPTER IV. THE LA.ET BKIEMIEH. The next day there was a fresh surprise forme, ii was a cold, bleak morning ; the boh was not shining ; the sea and sky -were gray and dark, and ominous of angry weather ; there was a wail ing orer sea and land as of human life in suffer ing. When I went down stairs, somewhat eariier than usual, I saw through the glass windows of the Wll that a closed carriage was waiting in the drive. ' Who is going away to-day ?' I asked of the housekeeper. ? ' Hiss Forsyth.' ' Going away — and at onee ?' X said., in any eur . prise. * Yes ; she gave orders for a carriage to be here very early this morning.' was the reply. * She is determined to go. Mrs. Selcombe is vexed, but cannot persnade her to wait till the fore noon.* * And Mr. Garthorne?' Mr. Garthorne was the resident surgeon of the Home. He has expressly forbidden it, but it is of no use. I don't know, 3£iss Douglas, that I ever re member a more self -willed young lady than she is. It may be going to her death — but go she ?will/ * I will see her,' I said. * Oh ! she particularly wished not to be distressed bv any leave-takings, aud said 'that you were not to—' I did not wait to near any more. 1 was selr willed on toy own aeeount, and resolved — even for reasons hard to set down here — to see heronce tiraia. I felt I was the causa other detemiinatiofl to quit the institution ; that for some inexplic able reason it wa,E either she or I who must leave S-?acliSe. I would ask one question, andtiien T.eU her I was sorry she was going away so hastily. Strange as it may seem, £ did feel suddenly and unaccountably sorry for this girl. I did not wish to ask permission for an inter view ; I assumed upon iny old position as her maid, and went suddenly and quietly into the room where she was sitting, in the same chair in ^-hieii I had left her last 'sight, only equipped ncivr for a journey. Ske had been arranging various small suns c£ money from her puree — ?J.auceurs for services of the attendants, I pre sumed, but Btse started up, and scattered some of she silver pieces on the floor, in her surprise at my appearance. ' I did 3 ot send for yon; I did not know you were up/ she said. ' I thought I -would rise early this morning,' I explained, 'and I henr you are going to leave us. jiTay I ask ttW this ie ?' r Oh, yen may ask,' she cried, impudently and rudely. ?And you will Hot aaswer me?' 'Why not ?' she rejoined. * Is it not sufficient, answer that I am sick of this place, heartily sick of it, and everybody in it, that I want to get away ?' * At a great risk to yourself, leaving thus un ceremoniously, and on so cold and bleak a day.' '?It is only two miles to the station, and I am not E32.de of bstrely-eugax,' she cried, flippantly. ? You are not strong.* * I am as strong at you are/ she retorted. * I can. go away and make room for others, if you can not/ 'If I had gone, then/ x. said, slowly, 'you would have remained?' She looked at me for a moment, then turned aside her hend. ? I did not say that. What are your movements to me?' ' Ah ! that is what I want to know, Miss For syth/ I replied. 'For you have shown great in terest in me, have offered me a . large sum of money to depart, and will withdraw yourself in haste, and at any personal risk, rather fh^n re main here with me/ ?You — you must not speak in this way,' she murmured. ' Pardon me j I have not much to say, and I will not willingly distress you/ I said, earnestly ; ' but there does not seem room in this vast es tablishment for you and me now, and for some ?mysterious reason you are afraid of out being here together/ ?Afraid!1 *tiive me a fair explanation, Miss Forsyth- ?why you wish me to withdraw, and T will spare yon the risk of this day's journey/ I concluded. ' I have nothing to exnlain.' ' Ton will not tell me ?' I urged. 1 1 have nothing to telJ,' was her reply. ' I think you have/ I said. 'Well, let me set vour mind at ease by spying that you .need not fear me, that -Captain Macfarlane need-. not fear ise either, and that I shall suffer no distress of miad by meeting him again. ' You knew he was here yesterday, then^? Ton Jnie-sr it?' * And if you are afraid of bis meeting vane,' I continued, 'pray disabuse your mind *--£ any jealous fancies, and — let me go/ ' For my sake — you would do this novrg* she, asked, vronderingly. ' Hardly for any one's sake, but simply for the general convenience,' I answered,'carelessly. *!You are not Etrong enough to go away to-day/ * 1 -wili go/ she muttered j 'I have made up^my jrind. Dcn't unsettle me/ * Why eiiouid this fear — ' 'I have not raid I have any fear of you,' sfce cded, in great excitement. * Why should I? All; ??raa over between him and you long ago V \ -Yee/ 'Then why Eucuid I mistrust him? 'Why should I f*''fr for an instant that — ' The door opened again, and Luke Macfarlane entered. It was a ghost-like entrance to us boih, and scared us equally as a spectre might have done. We looked at him. for a while, and he, Turning white as death himself, advanced toward me with both hands outstretched, like a man vrizh a claim of love to me yet, and which he-had a right to assort. 'Kate! — my own Kate!' he exclaimed, 'ami dreaming ? is it possible it can be you?' I backed from him. I did not take his bands.

I stood before her as the mistress of the; ! position, I the victorious, and she the vanquished 'Yon ere not engaged- to Luke Macfarlane,' I ^xcl&UDed.; ' I am not,* «he murmured. Don't tell- him I j-su'd I was. Oh, don't teli him that 1' ' Yon hare never been engaged to Mm P* , 'Ifarer/ she answered. * Spare mo to him; nave; mj well-respect * little. % hare been very wrong.

' He has been searching for me, thea ?' * Ever since his return from India, where he was telegraphed by the sudden illness of his father/ ' Hence his silence/ ' I was commissioned to explain all to you— presently to search for you. He thought he could trust ma and my mother. He knew nothing — he knows nothing — of my love for him. He will never know it now but for you/ she said ; ' and if you will keep a poor weak woman's secret, I shall be very gratef ul/ * You would not have spared me/ I answered. *You.never came to me. You were going away lest he and I should meet. You knew he loved me still, and guessed my heart was broken by what seemed to me his cold indifference ; you would have let me die/ ? * I loved him/ 'And hated me/ 'Yes/ she answered. * Poor woman,' I said, ' learn to hate me no longer. He shall not know the truth of this/ She seized my hand before I was aware, and raised it to her lips. * God bless you !' she said. ' But you may tell him presently. When I am dead, I should like him to know how much I loved him. But not be fore, lest he should despise me for my enmity to you/ ' Is the enmity at an end ?' ' It has been a bitter struggle between us,' she murmured. * An unfair fight, for I was defenceless/ ' Yet you had right fighting on your side against me/ she answered, with a si^h. ' And I was maticicus and bad. Forgive me if you can in time/ 'And why did you come here after me ?' * I vras ill myself, and it was a fair excuse,' she said. ' 1 had tracked you out, and the thought occurred to me to face you. I had a hope I should hear you say you had forgotten him, and he was nothing to you. Then I could have gone back happier in my mind, and waited for his coming/ * How long has he been in England?' ' A week/ * Ah, Luke, I have judged you very hastily/ I murmured to myself. ' Go to him,' she said ; ? he is waiting for you/ ' Yes, I will go now,' I replied. * And you will remain, here ?' 'Of course, of course,' she said. 'Despite of my plans, you ? and he have met. It is like fate/ As I went out of the door, she looked toward me with, me old piteous look. * You will spare my woman's oride ?' she sold again. ' I will/ was my answer back. I went out to my old lover, to hear his story and relate my owe — a sad story of misconcep tions, hasty words, and quick repentance, tEe re cord of a lovers' quarrfl lasting: two long years. The reader will not care to hear it» details at the eleventh hour like this ; he will take my word for it, and leave me happy with the man so lightly sketched forth here. This is the history of two women who fought for a lover, and Luke Macfarlane is simply a shadow to every one but me. Like a shadow he passed, too, from the life of Lydia Forsyth, and she saw hini not again. She had left the Home at Seacliffe when we went back to her room. At the last she feared to meet him, or to trust to my word, or to witness that happy era of reconciliation which she had striven hard to thwart. But, poor woman, she had loved this Luke of mine, and — unlike a woman, perhaps, I could forgive her for it. THE END.
