How to Treat Stammerers. I wish to show parents and guardians what a dreadful thing to a high-spirited and am* bitious boy stammering is. I sap emphati cally, if taken in its earliest stages, it canto* effectually checked. People are apt to imagine that it is a thing of small moment, and a defect which the boy will ' grow out of.' Fathers, I tell you plainly that, tri fling as it may appear to you, it is a matter of terrible importance to the lad's future wel fare, comfort, and happiness. In sbme odd cases, undoubtedly, sufferers do ' grow out of itbut in the great majority it grows upon them till they become confirmed stammerers, and their whole life is overshadowed^ by a dark cloud. A few words to the general public as to their treatment of stammerers or stultirers. Many kind- hearted men and women endeavour to help the sufferer by saying the \5jord which they imagine he is striving to utter. Friends, don't do this. In the majority of cases you will get hold of the wrong word, and make his confusion worse confounded. And apart from this, it is ex tremely galling to him to be dependent on other people in this way. If you wish to earn hiB gratitude and respect, endeavour to listen to him as if you had not noticed any thing peculiar in his speech. Never laugh at a stammerer. If you could for once put yourself in his place and feel the unutterable humiliation which he experiences, you would never again let the ghost of a smile cross your face when talking to one. When I have gone into shops or offices and, whilst striving hard to make myself intelligible, have seen the clerks or assistants grinning as though they thought it fine fun, it has sometimes been very difficult to restrain myself from ' train:? for them' and administering a ealu tary lesson. -From Ca.ssc'lfs Family Magazine .
