The Advertiser THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 1877. Now that the Corporation has decided to cause a Building Act for the city to be introduced into Parliament during the next session, the same opportunity might be seuea for the ptupose of bringing forward an Aitkan6 Dwelling Act for Adelaide. The experience gained in England and Scotland in caityirg oat tiie prorisionfl of the Public Health Act Bhowed conclusively that a Urge portion of the ill health, which prevailed in large cities and boroughs, and the high death rate in them, was due to the overcrowding of dwellings unfit for hu-nan habitation. Up to the year 1875 neither Corporatiors nor Boards of Works had powers eufficieatly extendve to enable than, to meet the evils which sprung1 from tbe existence of such places; but in that year the Government took the subject in hand, and the result was that uAn Act for facilitating the Improvement of the Dwellings of the Working Classes in large towns," 38 and 39 Viet, cap. 36, was passed into law. In readicg the preamble to this most useful piece of legislation, it might readily be believed that the draftsman had just returned from ™Jring a tour of inspection through the City of Adelaide, so accurately does he describe a condition of affairs known to exist amongst ourselves, and which in England was deemed of sufficient gravity to require the intervention of the Im perial Legislature. It runs as follows:— " Whereas various portions of many cities and boroughs are so built, and the build ings tbercon are so dercaly inhabited as to be highly injai.'ous to the moral and physical welfare of the inhabitants: " And wberers there are in such portions of cities and boroughs as aforesaid a great number of houses, courts, and alleys which by reason of the want of light, air, ventila tion, or of proper conveniences, or from other causes are unfit for human habita tion, and fever* a^d diseases are constantly generated there, causing death and loss of health, rot only in the eouite and alleys but also in other parts of such cities and boroughs: " And whereas it often happens that owing to He above circumstances, and to the fact that euch houses, courts, and alleys, are the property of several owners, it is not in the power of any one owner to make such alterations as are necessary for the public health: "And whereas it is necessary for the public health that many of such houses . courts, and alleys should be pulled down and such portions of the said cities and boroughs should be reconstructed: "And whereas in connection with the reconstruction of those portions of such cities and boroughs it is expedient that pro vision be made for dwellings for the work ing «*l?Rggp who may be displaced in conse quence thereof. Be it enacted," &c;, &c.; Hie Act is divided into three parts, contairing 31 clauses and a schedule. Much of the icichioery for carrying the Act into effect, it need scarcely be said, is wholly inapplicable to the circumstances of the colony. Many of the processes which are required to be gone through are tedious and cumbersome, and attended with an amount of expense which undoubtedly must in a serious degree impair its usefulness. If followed here in their integrity, their cost would often be more than the value of the ""n? lots of land on which the objec tionable buildings are erected. The prin ciples of tin Act, however, can be adopted without difficulty, and they can be applied with eo much the more ease because of the comparatively simple nature of the titles to the land, and the absence of those compli cated interests which in England are often bound up with them. The main provisions of the Statute so far as it is applicable to our circumstances are briefly these. An official representation to the local authority (e^. Corporation or Dis trict Council) may be made by the health officer of the district, after having inspected any given place, either in the discharge of his duty, on the order of two justice"?, or on the complaint of twelve ratepayers, that such place is unhealthy and unfit for human habitation; and, on being satisfied of the truth of such official representation, the local authority may make a scheme for its improvement, and the erection of suit able dwellings. This scheme must be ac companied by maps, particulars, and esti mates, and may include land adjoining if it be deemed expedient; and it may provide for the execution of the works projected by the owners of the land themselves, under the superintendence of the local authority, on terms to be agreed upon. On the com pletion of a scheme notices are required to be published in the local papers, and served on the owners or agents of the properties affected. Upon due compliance with the provisions of this part of the Act, the local authority must then petition a Secretary of State for an order con firming the scheme. After due enquiry by the confirming authority he is empowered to make a provisional order, which, however, possesses no validity until confirmed by an Act of Parliament, which has to be ob tained by tile confirming authority, and then it becomes a public general Act. The costs of these proceedings must be borne by the local authority, which is then bound to carry the scheme into effect In the event of failure Ha confirming authority can order the bind to be sold subject to the condition of building on it such dwelling houses for the working classes as he may direct. The Act contains power for the local authority to borrow money for the purposes of the Act and their general powers and obligations incident to the compukory taking of land, which are embodied in the Lend Clauses Consoli dation Act, and usually form part of all Acts which regulat3 the tailing of lard Tot public purposes. It ako provides "for the application of moneys and the mode of keeping ftrdaud;ang accounts. An Act such as this is most urgently needed for Adelaide, and if a general statute of this nature were passed, appli cable under certain conditions to other parts of the colony, there is very little doubt that it would soon be adopted by Corporations and District Councils. The demand for suitable dwellings for working1 people is always on the increase, and money invested'in erecting model lodging-houses for them everywhere turns out to be a most profitable investment. An experi ment of the kind made in Melbourne has proved to be a wonderful success; for that city, as well as our metropolis, is badly off for suitable accommodation for her working people. It is no figure of speech to say that in Adelaide the large majority of working men's houses are unfit to live in. The wonder is that anyone can be induced to take tfi™ under any circumstances, and it is a still greater wonder how it is that the death rate has not been even greater than it has been. Without some such Act as this the Health Act must become a mere farce, and the office of Health Officer practically useless A large number of the owners of the hovels whose horrible condition we have so fre quently described are unable to bear the expense of making any improvements in their properties, and a considerable number of them are absentees, whose agents have no power to spend money on the hind or in the houses; so that unless there is some means of making the necessary improve ments in Adelaide without their consent, or iu spite of any opposition which interested persons might raise, the state of the city must continually grow worse. No higher aim can be presented to a legislator than that of bettering the condition of the poorest and most numerous class of the population* Dr. South-wood Smith writes with great force upon the necessity for cleanliness on moral as well as upon physical grounds. He says—"lhave more than once ex pressed my conviction that the humanising inflwyy of habits of cleanliness and of those decent observances which imply self respect —the beat, indeed, the only founda tion of respect for others—has never been sufficiently acted on. A clean, fresh, well ordered house exercises over its inmates a moial no less than a physical influence, and has a -direct tendency to make the mem bers of a family sober, peaceable, and considerate of the feelings and happiness of each other; nor is it difficult to trace a connection between habitual feelings of this sort and the formation of habits of respect for property, for the laws in general, and even for those higher duties and obli gations, the observance of which no law can enforce." It is not necessary to add much to euch remarks. We will, therefore, content ourselves with pointing out that it is not of much use to educate the masses so as to fit themfordvilised life if through public neglect they are compelled to live in squalid hovels, as if they were no better than brute beasts or savages. President Hayes has signalised his for- mal investment with power by urging a union of parties for the sake of restoring order in the South, and by counselling a speedy return to specie payments. Nothing else could be expected from him. Although there can be no doubt whatever of his sin cerity on both points, it was manifestly the correct thing to announce without delay his anxious interest on behalf of the dis- turbed Southern States, and to show the hard money supporters of his opponent that the inflationists' had little if anything to gain from the triumph of a Republican. To secure definite advantages in either direction the President will soon discover is no easy task, and Jgss tanboth .will be the other roads which he must traverse on his progress to necessary reforms. He is, in deed, hampered and handicapped to an extent which would impair, if it did not altogether weigh down> the authority of even a stronger man. He must be.conscious that his own political force is weakened by j the fact that although Governor at the time of the election, he could hardly carry his own State with him for the Presidency. He knows, too, that the party of which he was the nominee and rallying point failed, j notwithstanding the most desperate re- course to disreputable electioneering wea pons, to maintain the position it had held during the Presidential contests of the last quarter of a century, and that the popular voice cried loudly and overwhelmingly ngainst it. Moreover, President Hayes must be aware that his exaltation has been brought about by the operation of the very system which as a reformer he is pledged { to destroy. Out of this kind of evil it may be that good will come; but if so, the re sult will be independent of the President's surroundings, and due to the maintenance of his known probity and high personal character amidst the. insidious counsels and pernicious practices of those around him. The doubt thrown on Ms election makes his position an inherently weak 0114 and it has yet to be Been whether he will so far yield to the sinister influence? of his would-be advisers, and thereby further weaken his position, or assume a firm atti tude, which will ensure him the support of the best men of all parties and go far to combat the factious opposition which is certain to be raised against him. We shall, indeed, be very much mistaken in the man if President Hayes turns out to be one who is easily cowed, or who betrays any sort of incapacity to deal with the manifold difficulties by which he will be beset. In intellectual ability and social qualities he is far above the average occu pant of the White House, and in exercising these to the satisfaction of the country he will secure, after all, his best title to rule. For some months at least he will be un molested by the jarring differences of rivajl assemblies, and if not menaced.by overjt acts of a more dangerous kind he will have an ample season of quietude for the enun ciation of a patriotic policy. Whether he will be able, or even willing, to formulate anything like the schemes which Mr. Tilden promised remains to be seen; but if not^ the regret will be increased that one so competent as the Democratic candidate to deal with questions of serious moment should have'been deprived of the honor conferred on him by the suffrages of his countrymen. If there is little on the score of personal fitness to choose between the two leaders who eo recently divided the opinions of the Republic, there is perhaps as little on the score of their desire to effect great and beneficial changes. One and the same obstacle lay before both in the bostility of those interested to the breaking up of tbe precsnt system of administration; but while President Hayes will try to overcome it, President Tilden would assuredly have surmounted it. The memory of Mr. Tilden's successful efforts against the corrupt ring? is still fresh, and the fulfilment of his later promises of similar reforms might have been un hesitatingly predicated. It still rests, however, with him and those who agree with him, by increasing w.itclifulne.cs and proper organization, to impose the policy accepted through him by the country on those to whose lot it has fallen to direct the affairs of the nation. Elections is the future will probably strengthen the Demo ciats in the severe! States and in Congress, eo tbat in effect their policy will become dominant. The tactical employment of the forces thus wirbm their grasp will redound more to their credit, and lead more directly to their absolute supremacy at the next Presidential contest than any other expe dients they may devise for mere party pur poses. Certainly, any factious attempts to upset President Hayes's authority will tUenate the sympathies of all lovers of order and good government, while they might tempt the Chief of the Executive to do what he would otherwise, in our opinion, sensibly refrain from doing, rely greatly on the excessive use of his vetoing power, and on martial interposition in the affairs of the South. Meanwhile, President Hayes's course is cleai- though difficult. The reform of the Civil Service is the touchstone of his chums to be ranked as a reformer. He as well as Tilden is pledged to this particular step; but his accomplishment of it will be more hazardous. Tilden would have been sur rounded by new men selected by himself from the most pronounced advocates of the essential change; Hayes is already en compassed by those who will not without a struggle permit the power, such as it is, to be taken from their hands. The dis- missal of incompetent officials and the ap pointment of honest and efficient men in their stead, would at once exhibit the President's triumph over the worst and most influential class of his supporters. Again, President Hayes, however well meaning, will not be so able to deal with fiTun«M«l reform as Mr. Tilden with his superior practical acquaintance -with the subject -would have been. In fact at the outset, in the very matter of Cabi net selection, the President's trials will begin. Without grave risk and much scan dal he cannot pass over all the Republican { leaders, yet those almost ta a man Are discredited, by the abuses whioh it is #je prime' object of the President io remove.

Coalitions meet with much approval, or work Very successfully, but the lion'lying down with ■ the lamb in the United States would be a hopeful spectacle, while the President's earnestness in the cause of reform would be placed beyond caviL With Mr. Blaine, whose chance for the nomination for the Presidency was for a timeigreater than his own, at the President's right hand and a moderate Democrat at his left, there is no eaying bow. rapid would be the necessary progress. But we are afraid this foretaste of a political miUenium.will not be offered us at the present juncture. Had President Hayes "not required to be " counted-in/ his position would have been otherwise; for the strength derived from his. unquestioned election would have enabled him to do many tilings which he cannot now venture to do. In a little while we shall have the materials before us on which to form an estimate of the change which has actually taken place. In the meantime, we can only hope that, un trammelled by the moreoibnoxiau? party re straints, undeterred by the threats of disap pointed suitors for place, and unopposed by any popular demonstration against himself* President Hayes will strenuously enter and pursue the promised path of reform.

Referring to a correspondent's letter about the abominable smell p?oeeedirg from a. gutter at the east-end of Rundle-etreet, we may state that during a recent visit to the Batanie Gardens we noticed that the creek which ran* through jfeeOardens ham East-terrace had been cleaned out, but die water which was running into the channel was covered with a filthy greasy offensive scum, said to proceed from soap and candle "work?. This refuse would destroy any fish tbat might be placed in the creek. The Curator of the Gardens, Dr. Bchomburgk, ia \- forms us that he had eighteen men employed Trith three carts and horses for seren weeks in cleaning, oat Che creek. About ?C3 loads of mud, having a most offensive odor, were taboi \- out and spread on the walks, where it hardens and makes excellent footpaths. The sewage of the eastern'part of the city being allowed fc> flow thro?gb the Botanic Gardens is a horrible nuisance, and affords a strong argument in favor qf deep drainage. • On Monday, March 6, & boat accident ccenrred at tbe'ioy.' J South-e*rt wesffaer," one of our qld salts says, "is like a woman's temper; when you trim sails for fair weather,, down comes a tqualL" A fisherman, named 3. Yeates, durin;'one of there deceitful lulls, anxious to get a greater propelling power on his dingy than- tbe wind afforded, made fast the sheet of his In?, and task to the paddles. A sudden puff from the high land capsized the craft, and m.-t.«r? ended in what Mr. Bastard would c*ll "a general splash." Happily the accident took place 'near Marino, and a swim of half-a-mOe, no great feat for Yeates, carried hiA to the shore. He left his boat to drift, and reached Glenelg none the worse for his immersion. The boat was picked np afterwards, tte only less being a few ashing lines. Yeates, who is a young man, some years I ago attempted to save the life of a comrade at the imminent risk of his own. Cnibrtunateiy the attempt was in vain, but it proved" him to be an excellent swimmer, and that his power of endurance in the water was considerable.

There are already' secured there'two steam engines for pumping purposes, and four air pomps for suppling the divers, four of whom are always at work clearing out the hopper. This ib very slow work, as the sand can only be lifted in small buckets, bat the divers manage to remove from 38 to 40 tons per day. On Saturday last a huge quantity of the spoil was got rid of very easily, by dropping one of the hopper dcors. and the tide having found am eddy there, took away a lot of the debris. On Wednesday there were not more than 18 inches of vrcter over the deck in the waist, and both cuds were perfectly dry. The afta- hatches and companions are all caulked and sealed down, and it now only remains to clear out the hopper and set to work. Two men named Brookman and Hopper left Maude on February IS fora new wcolshed in the course of erection on Nap Nap (N.S.'W-), but they never reached their destination. They were expected (says the He-; Standard) to arrive at the station by a certain date, but as they did not arrive it was thought they had turned back. On enquiry it was found they had not rettzmad to Maude, and the most natural conclusion was they were lost in the bush. Search was com menced about February 20, and the dead bedy of Brookman was found in tbe scrub, where be had evidently been left by bis connauon, who is still missing. Tbe cart in which they bad travelled was found near the body, bnt the horse and a saddle they had with them were gone, and it is supposed that Hopper rode tbe horse away in search of water. Tracks made by the wheels of the cart through the scrub showed that they ha#travelled' a "tong time ia search oF~waier. but it is considered strange that they should have driven over a ham beaten road several times without knowing it. The dead body of Brookman was found within a few hundred yards of the river. SMokmaa is said to have stated that he was the father of the bushranger of that nuntfti « During the past few days, "relates the Sydney Morning Herald of February 27, "a rumor was prevalent in one part of the city that some ghosts btd been seen is tbe vicinity of the University, and that they had taken the form of feocale figures in Sowing robes, and disported themselves amongst the gicsmy battlements after the 'shadesof evening'batt closed o'er the city. Nnmers of people, inter mixed with a large assortment of W> larrikin element, congregated on several oecmou in tbe vicinity of the seat of learning for the special purpose of Bavin* a. glance at the spectral - visitants, and last night they were gratified beyond their most sanguine expectations. Several constables.wwo despatched to the scene to prevent disorder. They found a motley crowd assembled, and also saw a, figure marching, op the University avenue, dressed in a petticeat and covered with a sheet. The constables immediately gave chaser but thia ghost was too nimble for them. It dropped its. cerements, vaulted over tbe palings* and ran across the shrubbery, where it disappeared among the people and was seen no more. The sheet and petticoat were captured, ho grower, and bore evidence of having bean used by sam* person-or persons with little rejard for oleanU ness."
