Aii Impressionist Picture, (BT D. M. C.) It WOE on artist's studio,,and smelt of turpentine, It also was an artietwlio bad wandered oat to dine, It was a ghost of canvas as blank as blank conld bo. It also was tho artist's cat, mucli troubled by a flea. Then said tho cat " To kill that flea I'll try a dodge that's quaint, I'll roll myself in turpentine and then roll is the paint," So said io done, but though he found it made him . ..rather Boro, That Busty floa in spite of it was active as before. Tho cat roamed round to find a spot to rub the paint away And, as good luok would have it, 'gainst the canvas cliaueed to stray. But while to get the paint all off, the tortured creature toiled, Tho artist hurried back again and found hia canvas spoiled. But luckily tint srtist was a. man of ready wit, " I'll pose as an impressionist," said he, " and make a hit, I'll call tlio thing a waterfall, a sunset, or a tree, A camel, or a battle, or a study of the sea. At next year's exhibition I'll be first upon the list And so I'll win much honor as a bold impression ist." Bo said so docs. Next year he was the talk of all the town. Next year he won more laurels with the picture upside down. i And yet the wondrous Value of the painting is not i gono He's bound to win more prizes whcra he shows it sideways on.
