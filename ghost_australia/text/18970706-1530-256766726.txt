THE JUNE GOLD YIELDS. SOME COMPARATIVE FIGURES. The official statement published by the Commissioner of Customs, showing the quantity and value of the gold entered for export during June, shows a smaller total than the returns fcsuci from day to day during the mouth lei UB to anticipate. For the purposes of comparison the two returns are here given sidu by side : CUSTOMS. CHRONICLE, ozs. ozs. E. Coolgardie 13,719 21,182 Coolgardie 10,283 6,919 N. Coolgardie . r>,C81 6,325 Dundas ... 2.608 Vilgorn ... 1,252 1,128 N.K. Coolgardie 829 3,211 The discrepancies arc noteworthy. In the COEC of Coolgardie an increase IB shown of over 3,000ozs, this difference between the Customs' return and the declared output representing alluvial gold, and that won by foielgn corporations who disdaiu to publish their doings lo -ally. In May tbe production of the field was 8,921ozs., so that the improvement for June was actually l,362ozs. The figures for the East Coolgardie goldfield are given in each columu minus the product of ore smelted in South Australia ; and iu this case the discrepancy is on the wrong, side of the ledger, being in fa it a shortage of close upon 7000oz, The other most nottceablc difference is in the returns from Norlh-East, the customs' statement being less than the actual out i ut by 2382oz. \- Commenting at some length on the June yield the Perth Momhuj Herald make* the following observations :—With the exception of laBt month's return the yield is the biggest on record, and, :u has already been pointed out, last montii's return included 10,000oz of gold obtained from ore exported to South Austi alia, a purtioirof which was despatched in previous monthB. We have now reached the end of the first half of 1897, and the gold yield for that period is only I5,995oz below that for the whole of 189u. That the second Half will greatly exceed the first is the greatest cer ainty iu the world, and the total yield for 1897 is absolutely sure to be more than d rnble that for 1896. Aishowing the way in which the gold yield is suicly mouu'ing up, comparison of the past six quarters should prove in'eresting :— 189G—First quarter... ... 45,356 „ Second qua 1 tor ... 66,971 ,. Third quaiter ... 81,137 Fourth quarter ... 87,868 1897—First quarter ... 113,208 „ Second quarter ... 162,119 This shows that, wbil.* the yield may one month drop below what it was in the previous month, owing to certain parcels not being exported in time to be included, it is only necessary to take a quarter, and it will be found that in absolutely every instance the yield is greater than that for the procoding quarter. Taking.the half-years, the increase is still more marked, the figures being :— 1896—First half oz. 112,327 „ Second half ... 169,005 1897—First half . ... 205,327 Should the. j ioUl for the second half of 1897 increase in the same ratio, it will amount to considerably over 400.0i)0oz. It is quite on the cards tbut this estimate will be exceeded. EALGOOBLIE POLICU COURT.—In the Kaleoorlie Police Court, yesterd ty, Henry Parera, a Cingalese, was charged with shooting with intent to murder Michael Burt on Saturday night. Accused was remanded for eight days, bail being refused. A charge against. Maggie Leddon. of sly grog selling, was withdrawn. Thos. Robinson pleaded guilty to sly grog selling, and was fined £30, with £4 4s. costs. A. D Fysbc, charged with a similar offence w.is acquitted. AN ALBANY SCARE.—A correspondent at Albany writes :—" Whit they call hero, 'Spring-heel jRck,' or the ' Albany Ghost,' is scaring a number of the -residents. At first, the apparition confined his attention to the Perth road, and the lonely roads about Mt. Melville, but oi parties of men and the police setting a watch for him he abandoned those haunts for the Recreation Groun i, and the roads in its vicinity. Now he has been seen near tbe Telceraph Office. His modus operandi appears to be as follows :—He dresses in a very light or white chesterfield coat, and suddenly appeals beside, or a little in front of his proposed victim (usually a woman or a lad) when be throws open his coat and displays the representation of a coffin, and the words—" Your doom is nigh," written in some phosphorescent substancc on hiB vest, or whatever garment it is he wears. On bis face the creature wears a black mask. If anyone attempts to seize him, he throws a liquid substancc over bis would-be captors, and as this is believed to be vitriol, hiB manoeuvres have so far met with success, tbe fear of the vitriol having an especially scsrclng effect. One half of the people are now terrified to go out alone."
