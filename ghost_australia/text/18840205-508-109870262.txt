CHAPTER XXV.— (Continued). ;',. Sice at this moment was in a very different I^Bcene. She was in tns large gallery, which wag a /4ittle chill and dreary -efi. a morning -when all the ^?windows were full of a, grey, indefinable mist in ' *tead -of light, andflfclie ancestors were indis siihgnishable in their frames. She had just been 'jgping through her usual exercise with, the baby, .and had joined Lucy at the upper end of the gal ? lery,tnat sport being over and little Tom carried 1 :-M.--£a his mid-day sleep. There vra^1 a fire there, In the old-fashioned chr.araeyyand Lucy had been Bitting beside it watchin g £ tie sport. Bice seated ^jherself on a stool at a little distance. She had a 0%alf -affection, half-dislike fnr this young woman, ? '?who was most near her image of anyone in the .house. For one thing they were on different eiders, and respresenting- different interests ; and Bice had been trained to dislike the ordinary '?i: 3ibase--keeping woman. Ttiey had been brought j\\. together, indeed, in a moment of emotion by the jinstrumentaiity of the little delicate child for whom 'Bice had conceived a c ompasssionate affection. But the girl felt that Ahey were antagonistic. 'She did not expect -understanding or charity, but ^ito /foe judged harshly ana. condemned summarily ? iby this type of the conven tional and proper. She Relieved that Luey would be ' shocked * by what -she said, and horrified by her freedom and ab eence of prejudice. Tet, notwithstanding all this, there was an attraction in the candid eyes and countenance of little Lady Randolph which jvdrew -her in spite of herself. It was of her own '?'' -will, though with a little appearance of reluct ance, that she drew near, and. soon plunged into talk; for, to tell the truth, now that Jock was ? gone, Bice felt occasionally as if she must talk to the winds and trees, and could not at the hazard \- of her life keep silence aay more. She could ?scarcely tell how it was that she was led into con cessions of all kinds, and descriptions of the de \- .tails of her past life. *We are a httle alike,' said Lucy. rl was not much older than you are when my father died, . ;&nd; afterwards we liad no real home ; to be sure ' I had always Jock. Even when papa was living it was not very homeli£e, not what I should ohoose for ajgirl. I felr. how different it -was : ?when I went t© Lady Randolph, who thought of everything ? ' Bice did not say anything for some time, and .then she laughed. * The Contessa does not think 'iof everything/ she eaid. Lucy looked at her with a question in her eyes. She wanted to ask if tiie Contessa was kind. But . there was' a certain domestic treachery involved _ in -asking euch a question. 'if- , - People are different/ she said, with a certain soothing tone. ' We are- not made alike, you know ; one person is good in one way, and one in another/ This abstract deliverance was not at all in Lucy's way. She returned to the particular point before them with relief. 'England/ she said, ' must seem strange to you after your own country. I suppose it is much colder and less bright ?' ' I have no country/ eaid Biee ; 'everywhere is my country. We have a house in Some, but we travel; we go from one place to another, to all the places that are what you call for pleasure. We go in the season. Sometimes it is for tbe waters, sometimes for the sports or the games — always festa wherever we go.' * And you like that ? To be sure you are bo very young, otheiwiee I should think it were rather tiresome/ Eucy said. * Wo, it is not rather tiresome/ said Bice, with a roll of her * r/ * it is horrible ! When we came here, I did not know what it was, but I rejoiced myself that there was no band playing. I thought at first it was merely jour de relache ; but when morning after morning came and no band, that was heavenly/ she said, draving a long breath. * A band playing !' Lucy's laugh at the ab surdity of the idea rang out with all the gaiety of.a cMld: It amused, her beyond measure, -and Bice, always encouraged by approbation, went on. ? '. ' I expected it every morning. Tho house is so 4arge. I thought the season, perhaps, was just beginning, and the people not arrived yet. Some timea we po . like .that too soon. The rooms are cheaper. You can make your ow.u arrangement/ lucy looked at her very compassionately. ' 'That is why you pass the niorninjjs in your. own room/ she said ; * were you never, then, in a country house before ?' ?1 do not know what is a country house. We have been in a great castle where there was the chase every day. ifo, that is not what la chase means in England. To shoot, I would say. And then in the evening the theatre, tableaux or .music. But to be .quiet all day and all night too, 'that is what I have never seen. We have never known it. It is confusing. It makes you feel as if all went on without any division j all one day, all one night/ Bice laughed, but Lucy looked somewhat grave. . '. That is cur natural life in England/ she said ; '' we like to be quiet, though I have not thought we -wum very quiet ; we have had people almost ? -nr«rv nip-lit. ' To this Bice fnade no reply. But at Lucy's next question she stared, not understanding what It meant. * '1 ou go everywhere with the Con tessa/ she eaid ; ' are you out ?' 'Out!' Bice's eyes opened, wide. She shook her head. ' What is but ?' ehe said. ' * It is when a girl begins to go to parties — .*when she comes out of her home, out oi the schoolroom, from being just a little girl ? 'Ah, I know! From the coit vent/ said Bice; 'but I never was there/ ' And have you itways gone i» parties— all your ' life V asked Lacy, with wondering eyes. . Bice looked at her, wondering too. 'We do :' not go to parties. What is a party ?' she said. 'We go to the -rooms — oh, yes, and to the great receptions sometimes, and at hotels. Parties f I don't know what tbat means. Of course, I go ^ith the Oontessa to the rooms, and to the table ?d'hote. .£ give her my &r;& ever since I was tall ' «nbugh. I carry her faff and her little things. WJien she sings I am always ready to play. They call me the shadow of the Contessa, for I always wear a black frock, and I never talk ex i«ept'wken some one talks to me. It i8 most I amusing how the English look at me. They say, Tffiias' ? ;?.std than stop that I may tell them riaj name/ . . 'And don't yon?' said Lucy. 'Do you know, vtKjsugh it is so strange to say it, I don't «ven \- -istflfcy your name/. ' *' ^?N^Bjce laughed, but 6he made no attempt to snp * .ply the I omission. 'Tb» Contessa thinks it is vitiora 'piqnaiit/ she said. .'Bat nothing is de 'cided about me till it is known tow I turn out. '..'jBE-U am beautiful the Contessa will marry me vw;ell, and all will be right/ _ _.( 'And ip that what you — wish ?' said Lncy, in a \- tonic of horror. ? . ' Slonsieur, your brother/ Baid Bice, with a laugh, f. says I am not pretty, even. H« says it does not matter. How ignorant men are, and ??Stupid ! And suddenly they are old, old, and : pour. I do cot know which is the worst. I do 'not like men ? ; .'And yet you think of being married, -which ;'-£t is not nice to speak of/ said Lucy, with disap proval. ;jmui ? * -??-? .';TTii1 ' »liiT Why i« that? Must not girls $» jnarrie2 ? and if sdj^fthy not think of it ?' eaid 3ice, gravely. There wa* not the ghost of a [Idufih upon 'her cheek. * If you might live with-. -»ut being married that -would understand itself j |*|Bat«tbelWiBe— — % ..f^iideed/ -criet Lncy, 'yon cian, indeed you ? ««i !

' 'By trades ?'- cried Bice, ''by -work?' She laughed. 'We hear of that sometimes, and the doctors ; everybody laughs ; the men make jokes, and they say they will have one when they are ill. If that is all, I do not think there is any thing in it. I should not like to work even if I were a man ; but a woman ! — that gets no money, that is mal mi. 'If that is all ! Work/ she said, with a little oracular air, 'takes up all m your lime, and the money th*i. one can earn is so small. A girl avoids saying much to men who are like this. She knows how little they can have to offer her ; and to work herself, why, it is impossible. What time wonld you have for anything ?' cried the girl, with an impatient sense of the fatuity of the suggestion. Luoy was so much startled by this view of the subject that she made no repry. (to be continusd.) .
