HARBOUR TRUST PA TRONAGM TO THE EDITOR OF THE. ARGUS. Sir, Believing I have just grounds for] being " indignant at the treatment which I i even ved at yesterday's meeting of the Harbour Trust from the chairman and some of the members, in their refusal to allow me to speak on the vexed question of the Trust's patronage, I ask your permission to make public the whole circumstances surrounding the dispute Not very long after the establishment of the Trust I had repeated complaints made to me by labouring men that it was impossible for them to obtain employment from the resident engineer without the personal influence of commissioners or influential citizens Inquiries satisfied me these complaints were not groundless In 1882 some glaring " mistakes" to use no stronger term in the matter of appointments were brought to light, and on the 9th August of that year, on the motion of Commissioner Huddart, seconded by Commissioner How- man, the following resolution was agreed to unanimously - " That the commissioners hereby resolves that the became desirable, in the interest of this trust, to establish such rules for the employ) as an shall Curran- > tee promotion by seniority) and merit, so that every emplO)y, tion ever favour he may be of influential friend-, shall have the certain knowledge that he will secure that promotion for which he may h c qualified himself that a sub-committee be formed to prepare a suitable scheme for revIsion by the ordinary committees, such sub committee to consist of the chairman, Commissioner- Ilowmaii, Hodgkinson, field, and the mover The committee so appointed devoted considerable time to the subject, and on the 21st , September they presented their report to the commissioners, which recommended inter alia that every employer deserving of promo- tion should obtain it, that every new pet routes should enter at the bottom of trade' last, should not be over 40 years of age, and should pass a medical examination that nlL the patronage of the Trust, except in cases a special appointments, should be exercised' through a departmental committee, consisting of the Secretary, resident engineer, and. harbourmaster, it being an instruction to the ' departmental committee that no new appointments should be filled up from outside until they had satisfied themselves that there was no suitable employ√© of the Trust eligible for the vacancy The report of the committee was carried by a large majority, the only dis- I sentiments, as far as I can remember, being:,. Commissioners Bowman and Perry, of Williamstown The ghost of patronage being now find, the mercantile members of the 'Trust congratulated themselves that the new regulations would be carried into effect forthwith, but the resident engineer took up the position that by a regulation passed in August, 1877, the right to engage, and dismiss dredging employes was vested in him, and that until that regulation was re- scinded the new rules could not come into effect. The chairman of the Trust upheld the engineer's objection, and called a special meeting of the commissioners to alter or re- voke the regulation of 1877, but in the unavoidable absence of some of the merchants' and shipowners' representatives, the Trust refused to take any action in the matter ; consequently two regulations remain on the books of the Trust, one giving the engineer full power to appoint and dismiss employes, the other bringing into existence a comprehensive system of administration, based on the lines of the Imperial and New SouthWales marine services, whereby all patronage; is abolished, and ever) deserving employes however devoid of friends and political iris ences, is insured promotion I confess I was bitterly disappointed, because I had hope that the Melbourne Harbour Trust would have been able to make the proud boast that it was the first public department in the colony to kill the degrading system of patronage, which seems to have saturated every portion of the body politic. For years past, several of the leading commissioners have endeavoured to introduce the principle of "a fair held and no favour amongst the 400 or 500 men employed by the Trust, and the result is a fiasco, or at least a deadlock. Assuredly the public will look to the new chairman to find the key which will solve the difficulty - -I am, etc., HUGH R. REID.
