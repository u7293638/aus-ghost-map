GHOSTS OR NO GHOSTS. 13Y J. 0. " On, I don't believe in ghostB and haunted houses at fill. It is all bosh and nonsense, only dreams of a sickly and depraved imagina tion. "And why, pray, do you not believe?" said Alf. "I)o you question it because of the impossibility or the improbability? li you tako it on the former score you will find some difficulty in your proof, if you admit that there is anything beyond the lmteriiil a Bometb'ing intangible to the outward Benncs; if you advance the improbability, why you know as well as I do that you know nothing, absolutely nothing, about the matter, and never will know until it is too late for us to benefit from what you have learned." "It is useless arguing about it. It must bo simply put out of doors."

Alt and I wore seated in one ot the fine old houses of Northern Tasmania-one of thoBe houses which remind us so much of the "stately homes" of the old country. The early colonists of the " Tight Little Island " were thorough Britons, and carried with them all the Englishman's ideas of comfort and stability. Cairnstock QoUBe might have been taken bodily by some genius like Aladdin's slave, and plaoed in the middle of Yorkshire or Surrey, and no stranger would have noticed much difference between it and its neighbors, unless that its broad verandah would look a little incongruous in a country where they think so much of the sun rays that they re ceive all they can of them, and intercept none that will escape a parasol or umbrella. The surroundings were picturesque in the extreme. At the bottom of a sloping lawn there Qowed a broad, silent river, which had in its im petuous youth leaped over a precipice and thundered in rapide, but now glided calmly and majestically through wide meadows and undulating woodlands. Behind the house the hills rose tier after tier, until they cul minated in a peak, whose summit always received the earliest winter's snow. It was a lonely enough position, however, as the nearest neighbor was ten miles away. Alf and his sister lived in the old house, and graoefully played host and bosteeB to many Â§uests. I had met them in Paris. One Sun ay morning while enjoying a contemplative cigar on the top of Napoleon's Aro De Triomph, and surveying the unrivalled urban views which oan be caught from that position alone, I was attracted by a silvery laugh, which came from the rosiest lips in that oity of the beautiful. Ada and her brother Alf Meadows had been like myself admiring the magnificence of the Queen city. As they were strangers I did the guide to them, and pointed out the beauties of the Tuileries, the Louvre, the Invalids and the other Bhow places. We became friends, and it was not very long until I fairly succumbed, and was the devoted slave of the beautiful Ada. Certainly I was a little taken aback when I discovered my acquaintances came from the opposite side of the world, but " love conquers all things," and space in the bargain, and before we lad known each other six months I was ready not only to risk a sixteen thousand miles journey, but even veritable transportation itself, provided I could claim her as my own in the end. I had arrived at Caimstock House the very day (2:ird December) on whioh the fore going conversation had taken place, and somewhat unexpectedly, as I had completed somo business in Melbourne more quickly than I had hoped. Ada had gone to see some friends, and was not expected home until the next day, and I had to he contented with the oompany of her brother, a dear, good friend, but scarcely a satisfactory substi tute. After dinner I happened to say that the position and surroundings of the house would bring to mind one of those haunted establishments of which old country folk think they have the monopoly. I waB sur prised to see my brother-tn-/uturo take the matter, as the French say, au grand tcrieux, and actually consider the possibility of spiritual manifestations. As this was so foreign to hiB usual devil-me-care characteris tics, I ventured on the inevitable chaff, but was still more astonished at seeing Alf's face lose all its buoyancy, and assume something very like the aspect of fear. I had not the slightest idea of what he meant by hig final proposal, and asked him to explain himself. He remained for some time in deep thought and at last said: " You have a right to know all about it, and therefore as it is a family matter I shall tell you, though when you have heard the story you will understand why we don't much care to speak about it to outsiders. He paused again and then prooeeded: "My grandfather oame out to Van Dieman's Land among the earliest of the colonists. He had been in the army, and therefore very easily got all the fine land which you oan see tor miles around us. The climate of the country suited him and his family well, and indeed it would have been a wonder if the old warrior had not contented himself in suoh a country after his life of toil and battle. Unfortunately he had all the sternness and harshness of the soldier, and these were exaggerated by the position of absolute masterdom in whioh he found him self. You are aware, I suppose, that the con victs were assigned as servants throughout the colony, but you are not aware that in ninety-niue oases out of a hundred the un fortunates were the slaves, and nothing else, of their masters. Certainly tbey were the very outcasts and dregs of society, degraded by every sort of crime and ready for any description of villainy. There is scarcely a square mile of Tasmania which has not its tale of murder and outrage, and I remember well all over the island the gibbets on which were hung in chains the bodies of many an outlaw and bushranger. But these wretches were men at least, and they were treated as brute beasts, and we need scarcely say they gave beasts' service. You oannot conceive the horror whioh this lovely island witnessed -much less can you conceive the cause? which in many instanoeB occasioned if they did not account lor them. " My grandfather for a long time had very little trouble with his servants. The strict discipline to which he accustomed everyone made him feared and respected by all around him, but gained bim little good will amongst his dependents. Amongst his assigned ser vants there was one who had contrived to worm himself a little into the confidence of his master by sneaking and tale- bearing on his fellows. It is one of the misfortunes, or, rather, the penalties of slavery that it insen sibly vitiates the character of the masters themselves. The old soldier who detested anything like meanness, tolerated worse than meanness in the people, whom ho looked upon as inferior animals, and he thought Limping Joe a very useful creature. Joe, on the other hand, hated the Colonel with all the venom of a depraved heart. The Colonel believed in the cat, and Joe had sworn to be revenged for every weal scored on his back, and they were not few. The villain meditated no small revenge. It would have been easy to have met the old man alone, but the chances of a struggte with him were desperate, and besides his sudden death would have been a poor satisfaction for the years of oppression at which it must be confessed my grandfather was an adept. " A frcBh (servant was brought from Hobart at the very time Limping Joe's schcmes were taking shape in his bead. The new-comcr was a man who had been convicted of con nection with some trade outrage in Hheflield. It was a strange time that, when men were driven irtmi home and all they oved for the merest trifle, or if they showed tho slightest opposition to the all-powerful oligarchy. The misfortunes ot liis life had nBturully soured Gr Ned Williams, and the unlucky wretch come to tho very worst placo for sympathy. My /-'ruixifather would allow nothing but tho most ordinary communication between his servants and his family, and tho young fellow , innouent as lie was proved to be, was left to broi d over the injustice of tho world without a word of consolation or a touch of kindness. No wonder that there wan nothing on his side but sullen submission, and on my grandfather's a determination to 'drive tho devil out of him.' 1 )y all accounts Colons! Meadows made Cairnstock a hell to poor WillianiB, Tho .Colonel was a magistrate. You will Bh; a .... JI.q . QtmnBiiji .i.ln nf tl.,1 hauk building is the old Bridewell to which prisoners were consigned before being sent to Hobart, and, Heaven help us, it was rarely without a tenant. That biR tree and that paltry house could tell some awful tales if we could give them tongues. " The Colonel bad two children, a girl and a boy, both of whom he loved passionately, as men such as he sometimes do; but he I especially adored the lovely little Ada, the : very apple of Uia eye. You will know whence my sister gets her name. | Matters grew worse and worse for Williams, and Limping Joe watohed everything with a I tiger's eye. About this time there were re ports that a strong body of bushrangers who ; had kept the western parts of the island in terror had come northward, and then Joe, taking advantage of the despair and wretched ness which possessed Williams' soul, tempted him to join them. Williams seeing nothing but a life of misery or self-destruction before him consented, and one night they settled to start the next day for the mountains, and appointed a place of meeting. On that next day little Ada was found dead on the bank of the river, and her lovely body was mutilated almost beyond recognition. A bloody knife wai found near, and every one recognised it as having belonged to Williams. He was not to be found, and of oourse the crime was at once laid at his door. Certainly the attend ing circumstances went far to prove hi? guilt, and at that time much less would have established it in the eyeB ot free colonists. No one in the hurry and oonfusion seemed to notice the absence of Limping Joe. _ _ There was at that time one of the aborigi nals hanging about the station. We have contrived to civilise them off the face of the earth, so you will not have a chance of seeing a specimen. His services as a tracker were immediately employed, and soon there was a strong party in pursuit. I need give you no details. It will be enough to tell you that the fugitives were overtaken, and after a fierce [ struggle Williams was severely wounded ana made prisoner. Joe escaped for the time, and as it was thought the murderer was hard and last no very active pursuit was made after his companion. " The captive was brought here and thrown into that Bridewell. The unfortunate wretch, covered with wounds and with a leg broken, was a miserable sight. When he was aocused of the crime he denied it in the strongest manner, but his judges were prejudiced, and he was alone. Their passions were excited, and some one more brutal than the rest pro posed to roast the prisoner or make him oon fess. , I can scarcely bear to tell you the end. Good God I how unlimited power brutalizes us I The wounded man was dragged before a large Are beneath that tree, and hung up by the arms from one of the boughs, exposed to the double torture of the fire and of his injuries. I oan not imagine that the exeoutioners_ really meant more than to extort a confession, but whether they meant more or not the miser able man was not cut down until his senses had forsaken his wretched body. As they dragged him back to the look-up he partially recovered, arid seeing my grandfather near he cursed him and his, and prayed that neither his son nor his son's son should ever live to reach his own age. The poor fellow's body was found oold, stiff, and still in the oell-done to death by oar omnisoient law. _ The very next day came his free pardon, his entire inno cence ol the erime in Sheffield having been proved. A short time brought the confirma tion of his innooenoe of the murder also. Limping Joe joined the bushrangers just in time to share in a few depredations and in their speedy ruin. He was shot down, and had barely time left to confess that he was the murderer of little Ada, and that to keep suspicion from himself he bftd used Willi&iDB; knife to do the deed. "These few bald particulars will not be sufficient to make you realise the horrible truth. One almost doubtB the goodness of the Creator when we puzzle ourselves to find why such things can be. The share poor Williams had in this world was a very poor one, and I would give all these broad lands that no one of my blood bad helped to make his part in life more wretched. Sometimes I think that his ourse must have fallen on us. My father had barely reaohed thirty-five -William's age was about that-when niB dead body was washed up by the river near the spot where his sister's had been found years before. Our poor mother did not sur vive him long, and we were left to the strangers' care. In all the southern hemis phere we have neither kith or kin to care fox us or feel for us. Can it be the ourse ? The story affected me more than I cared to acknowledge. Englishmen are not often brought face to faoe with such horrors. But I was not going to let a simple story so easl*y undermine my foredrawn oonolusions, and I said to Alt: " It ia certainly a most painful incident to be even remotely connected with, but you will scarcely bring me to believe that the actors in the tragedy have not something better to do than return to the scene. Ia it said your little Bridewell is haunted? To be sure there area'tmauy places that deserve it more. ^ " You may judge for yourself if you Uke, said All, "but I give you fair warning. I would not pass a night there for a kingdom. I have done it onoe, and onoe is enough in a life-time." . , " Well, I shall try it this very night. Ada will not be home until to-morrow, and I may as weU spend the time unraveUing the secret." . ... " All risht; and if you do so no one will thank you more heartily for anything than 1 shall for this." The conversation turned on other topics, but Alf's spirits seemed to have fallen to zero, and gradually we beoame silent. 1 watohed the lengthening shadows of the trees pass slowly over the lawn as the sun dipped towards the western hills, and contrasted, m my own mind the oold and dreary Christmas landscape of England with the gorgeous brilliancy ol the scene before mo. 1 was BO absorbed in this that it was with a sudden start I heard three rapid knooks just bb the sun disappeared behind a distant peak. 1 jumped to my feet at onoe, and was rather surprised that Alt took no notice unless a sickly smile on his lips betrayed his having heard it. " What was that ? " said I. "Oh, nothing 1" said he, "or, something we are pretty well aocustomed to. 1 Of course I oould not show too much curiosity, yet I could not help feeling some thing uncanny, but this gradually wore away under the combined influence of a stiff glass of toddy and the soothing smoke ol a frag rant Havannah. Meantime whatever little preparations were neueBsarytomaketheisolitaTy Bridewell tenant able for a night had been made before sun down, and Alt told me pretty plainly that I should have little chance ot company, "D'f88 the ghoBtly, as not a man, woman, or child, for miles around would venture near the little ^ building for its weight in gold. This, however, was not going to deter me, and that night I was a lodger in a place which oould not boast j ot one before, during more than fifty years. |
