[ THEATRE ROYAL. ) "THE BELLS." The story of Le Jmf Polonaise, b) SIM Erckmann Chntrian, was not written with any view to its being adapted for the stage, and its authors were not less gratified than surprised when M H Lnroclielle applied to them to dramatise it for representation at the Theatre Chili), Paris in 1894 Two years afterwards Mr Leopold Lewis pie paid an English version of it for production at the Lyceum, where it was played for the first time on the 25th of November, 1871, and run for a hundred and fifty one consecutive nights the manuscript had been previously offered to several London managers who had rejected it with ridicule, which is perhaps not much to be wondered at when we remember that an ultra more dramatic version of the novel had been already pin) ed at one of the minor theatres, and that the part of Mathias had been presented under a ludicrous rather than a serious aspect The drama proved to be the turning point in the fortunes of Sir Henry Irving, the original Mathias who had been previously regarded as on eccentric comedian, with a somewhat limited range of characters, but who proved himself to beunnctorof a much higher sphere in The Bells It is a part, indeed which affords great scope for the display of intensity of feeling while the action of the story hinges upon certain psychological phenomena ridiculed by most men of science at the time the drama was written, but which have since formed the subject of intensive investigation by the French faculty more particulars), and have given rise to a whole literature on mental suggestion hypnotic control the transmission of thought and will from mind to mind, and 1 kindred subjects in' The Bells an Alsatian innkeeper murders a guest for the sake of a considerable quantity of gold which he is known to have in his possession The murdered man is a Polish Jew, and his assassin rises into a position of comparative affluence, but is continually haunted by the sound of the bells attached to the horses which brought his v victim a sledge to the innkeeper 8 door on that fatal night Time rolls on, and the mysterious disappearance of the Jew is well nigh forgotten by all but his murderer who gives his only daughter in marriage to his one source of disquietude, the local sergeant of aerial men, who receives some of the Jews gall by way of doing), while the father in law exacts from him a promise on his wedding day that he will refuse to accept any offers of promotion which would involve his removal from the village After the marmite festival Mathias, who is liners called mediumistic, and has been brought under the influence of a mesmerist at an exhibition of hypnotism during one of his visits to the market town, and has seen him extorting secrets from a patient in a clairvoyant condition, falls into a trance himself In this comatose state he witnesses his own arraignment and trial for the murder of the Polish Jew As there is no evidence against him, and he stoutly denies his guilt, he is placed under the influence of a professional mesmerist by order of the judge and struggles with all the energy of despair to resist it, but eventually succumbs Then powerless in the hands of the operator, Mathias re enacts every incident of the murder-the death blow, the theft of his victims girdle filled with gold, and the turn of his body in a limekiln The prisoner is sentenced to death, and in an agony of violent emotion Mathias aw ni ens from his entranced condition feeling the hangman s rope around his neck and dies in the midst of a spasm of mortal terror a few minutes after his outcries have brought his daughter and her husband to his assistance Mr Bentley has evidently based his interpretation of the character of Mathias upon that of Mr Irving but without laughing self open to the charge of being a cop) ist In the first act he is Somewhat unequal and in one scene in which he is left alone upon the stage his soliloquy), instead of being delivered with the subdued earnest- ness of suppressed emotion, as a criminal accustomed to the exercise of a cunning self control would not tally speak under such circumstances, is so vehement!) declaimed that it could not fail to arouse and startle river) bed) in the inn Nor do we think the alteration YY Inch has been made in the ending of this not at all a judicious one In the French drama the spirit of the murdered Jew reappears at the door of the inn reports the very words which the living man had uttered fifteen years before, and goes through every action previously described by an eye witness, while Malvina gazes at him with ston) eyes, stretches out his arms in piteous appeal to the expansion of his v return and falls upon the floor with the utterance of a cry of anguish and horror But in Mr Bentley) s version the walls of the um disappear and we see afaWerni of the murder, which in the immobility of the figures is unreal and ineffective In the second act the quieter passages of the drama were given with a nice appreciation of their dramatic value, and the b) pin), although occasionally tedious, was generally impressive but it is in the trial scene in the third net, and moropurticulnil) in the performance of the murder by its perpetrator under the dominant and irresistible influence of the mesmerist that Mr. gentle) distinguished himself most brilliant) and compelled the hushed attention of the whole house His acting VVHB a in steel) demonstration in morbid psychology) his speech, gestures and actions were those of a somnambulist who had lost all independent volition and was recalling, in the subjection of his memory and imagination to the more powerful will of another, every incident and emotion of the tragedy we Hill had lost such a dark shadow on his life He went through it all from the first conception of the crime until the remains of the victim had disappeared in the burning lime, and Mr Bentley succeeded in presenting a succession of exciting incidents with so much picturesqueness and power as to thrill the audience But was there any necessity for the judge and the mesmerist to anyone their BIUUC of the dialogue and to talk in the measured manner of the Ghost in Hamlet' Instead of being awe-inspiring it opens uni!) bordered on the ludicrous Of the other members of the company it is necessary to spend -here is only one character in the drama, and that isMitlnns The rest are so many foils to the central! figure Mr Bentley was called before the curtain at the end of each act and the audience which included an unusually large number of his professional brothers and sisters complimented him as much by their silence us by) their applause 'The Bells was followed by the Scottish free of Cramond Brig in which Mr. Bentley) gave a proof of his versatility) b) tal ingthepnrtof Jock Howieson and the same bill is announced for repetition this evening a
