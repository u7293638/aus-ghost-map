HOW TO LOVE GQD. A WOMAN once said to her pastor : " I do love God, <: but want to love Him more ; how can I ? " You must become better acquainted with Him," was his reply. " We love those who are worthy of our"love in proportion as we become better acquainted with them." "How can I get better acquainted? " she asked. " Study the Bible more," he said. God speaks to you, reveals Himself to you, in the Bible. Read ii^ the New Testament the life of Jesus, and imagine you had been with Him as John and Peter and Mary were—and pray more. Tell Him all your joys and troubles and needs. He will answer you, and every answer will draw you closer and closer to Him. Then try to please Him in everything you do aud say. We always love those whom we try to please. Love makes ue wish to please the Lord, aud love rewards us when we have done it." The woman followed these rules, simple as they were, and her love to God grew and filled her heart. It made her very happy, so that all who knew her said: '• What a bright, cheerful person she is! I don't believe she ever has any trouble." And yet she had a great deal of trouble, but the love of God so filled her heart that it seemed like wings to lift her up above it all. If she had been asked if she had any trouble, she would have smiled and said: " I don't believe I have; for when it comes the Lord takes it all away.'' " Love is of God; and everyone that loveth is bom of God, aud knoweth God." ''He that dwelleth in in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him." The very essence of religion is love. The love of G^d shed abroad in" the heart by the Holy Ghost brightens life and prepares for death. Love is the atmosphere of heaven, and none can be admitted there who have not first learned to love.
