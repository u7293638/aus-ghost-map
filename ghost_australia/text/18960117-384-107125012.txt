Lust o poritnaitloi There is no pcssible "might have [ee t of life's history- so sad as the op portunity, lost forever, of being tdnd tc somebody who is dead. There is nc. sorrow that can match the sorrow of a heart which .recognized too late that it might have been more kinrd and loving to one whom God hath taken. There is no tear among the many which mor tal eyes might shed which .can blister and corrode like the tears that fall when remembering harsh words spoken oz tender caresses withheld. Itis sosmall a thing to say a pleasant word instead of a cross one, or togive a smile in place of afrow, and yet how strangely reti cent we are in such matters. "Oh, she knows I loe'her; I can't be bothering to say so all the time l! says the hus. band, and meantime the heart of his wi'e craves the word that is never .p.ken, nufil its echo comes likea ghost to haunt the memory when death has forever removed love's opportin?ity. It is so little we can really do for one another in the march of life. We are all under marching orders, and havYE burdens to carry. There is no nalt fc nconday dreams nor twilight rest. It is step, step, step- right onward through dust and commonplace, with-: out music or banners-or present glory, and yet to each soldier has been given a canteen full of never- failing water, cup of which we may proffer with no fear of a diminished store all the way through to the end of the long march to the sea. Is our comrade discouraged" Do his feet. fail an~ d his hands grow heavy? A cheering word, a loving service, a friendly suggestion, born o! the desire to help and encourage, willt revive him like sparkling water in the desert heat. Such things cost nothing, huLt not all the gold and diamonds you could pack into your bundle would match them.for solace on the long and dusty march that stretches for each one of us between the cradle:and the grave.
