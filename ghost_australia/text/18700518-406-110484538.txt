SELECT POETRY. TSB OLD CATHEDRAL ORGANIST. *Tis forty years ago since first , I climbed these dusty winding stain, . To playtbe Dean in;; how I spurned Beneath my feet all meaner cares. When first I leant, my cheek pri fire, And looked down blushing at the choir. Handel, and HaydB,andMozart I thought theywatebed me as I played; .! r While Palestrina's ;Btern, pad, face Seemed in the twilight to lipbraid ; Pale fingers moved upon the keys The ghost^hands ot past centuries. Behind my oaken battlement Above the door I psed to Jean, And watch, in puffing crimson hood, Come 6tately sailing in Â«he Dean ; On this, the organ, breathing low, Began to vnurmer soft and Sow. I used to shut my ears, and hear The solem n prophecy and psalm Bise up like incense; and I loved Before the prayer the lull and calm, Till . like the.etream'thatbursts -its banks, Broke forth brave PurceU's " O give thanks." I know thoBe fourteen hundred pipes And thirty stopB, as blind men do The voices of the friends' they love, The bird's song and the thunder too: And the fierce diapason's roar, like storms upon a rocky shore. And now to day I yield me up The duskypeat, my old loved throne, TJnto anothar, and no more Shall come bore in the dusk alone. Or in the early matin hour, To Hear my old friend's voice aud power. And yet methipke that centuries hcnce, Lying ben&tii; the chancel'floor, ' In .that dark nook I shall delight To 'hear the anthems swdll once more; And to' myseifshall s fitly .smile, When mosie floods theyaolfced aisle. Or, mockiiig gravely at some hand ' Less skilml than my own was once, In my snug nest I'll lie, and mark The blunders of the foolish dunce, But to myself the secret' keep, -1 And turn me ronud again to sleep.
