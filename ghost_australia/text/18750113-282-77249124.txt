Upon this -tor 'Yieiid entered upon I a full account of the mill from its origin i to the present- time .;? which history ho ! largely interspersed with the super j naturat "clement, ami " which I have endeavored to euiV, iy in the foregoing remarks. I need ? jrdly state that the knowledge of the £(???;.? detailed, served by no uieuns to deler mc from paying my.intended visit u> tlie mill.

I did not, however; entirely loso toy presence of mind, for tho unlocked door instantly suggested to mc that some cxio must ,be about tho premises: but where or how to find the said some one was quite , im possible for mc to determine. As to move about tho impenetrable gloom which prevailed, when for all £ knew the first step might precipitate mc into stilt gloomier depths, that was qniteont- of the question. In this dilemma, and wliHe 1 was beginning to think I had already pushed my enriosity quite far enough to be pleasant, and was medi tating a hasty retreat, approaching foot ftteps arrested my attention, and pre sently a hollow voice, issuing apparently from a distance, and sounding weird like through the -thick darkness de manded " "WWs there V i " A friend," I replied: "one whom you may probably expect." "Oh ! it 7 s you. sir: just wait a wee, if you please, sir," aud receding-foot- : steps were again audible. ' I had not long to wait when a middle aged man made his appearance through , n doorway at the extroino end of the building, bearing in his. hand a lamp, f whose feeble and flickering light only served to make the- darkness darker still. j " Step this way, sir," be began, as he ! approached ; '"I really did not expect \ ye sic a. uicht as this, m> I sat doon afore the lire and slepit a wee, and just flu I woke up an nnco puff o' wind blow thnlamp out. I was sure I heard some one at the 'dwr. But, dear mc, .sir, you're drippiu' -weet; step this way and dry yourscl , at the fire." , Thus talking, ho conducted mc throngh the body of the building into a species of. ante-room, where a bright lire sired a rich glow around, and soon dried my soaked garments. {To be continued.')
