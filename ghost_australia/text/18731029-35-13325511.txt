It offended the national pride and prejudice of tho Hebrew race, and was something equally incomprehensible and unacceptable to the tastes and aspirations of tho culti- vated intellect of the philosophising and sceptical Greek. Modern Christians can hardly realise tho loathing and horror with which the cross of Christ was then regarded both by Jew and Gentile To them it symbolised all that was humiliating, for it was then tho sign of nothing but a horrible and disgraceful death Tho preacher drew a vivid sketch of the ovantelising work of tho diminutivo tcnlmnker in the strcots of Connih, and the efloct of that teaching upon both classes of his hearers in that city, and the wondrous success which blessed Paul's labours, and founded one of the first and most flourishing churches of Primitive Christianity From this grand centre point wns afterwards carried tho Gospel of God to tho barbarous Enst, 'W est, North, und ¡south, and the groat and good pin pose of tho Almifcht) was eventunll) roaliïod for lhe salvation of men Iho Gospel was shewn b) Paul to bo the power of God and the wisdom of God only to those who wero mwaidl) eilectutill) called by the liol) Spnit to receive that Gospel in all humiht) and Christum obedience Might God, in his infinite mcrcv, grant that bj mnnv iii theso dav s to whom tho same Gospel should bo preached tho liol) Spirit would gno a like blessed success After the sermon, tho 90lh Psalm was unprossivel) sung, and a collection was made in aid of tho expenses of tho Gencinl Assembly 'Iho Assembl) was then duL constituted with pravor in tho accustomed form Tho clerk of Assembl) hud on tho utblo tho minutes of the eighth session of the General Assembl) (held in October, last vcar) and the minutes of a pro te tinta sossion held in April and Mnj, 1S73 The roll of Assombl) was then mudo up and read b) the clerk The clerk also notified the dlmissions, trim lettons, admissions, inductions, and or- dinations of ministers Iho deaths of tho Rev Burvilliiv Qunifc and the Rev Mr Goold wero also roportcd to, the Assembl) Tho clerk then read the nominations of tho presbv tones fiom which it appeared thnt the Rev John kinross, Bachelor of Arts, minister nt Iviaum, was unan- imously nominated to the office of Modo ator of tho G euora 1 Assembl} for tho ensuing v car Dio announcement was re- ceived with applause, and the new 1) elected moderator was introduced ni tho usual form, and took Ins seat as the pre- sident of Iho Asseinbh 11 e Mom ltvToit addtcssed the Assembl) A« follows - tathire nnd Brethren,-In reviewing the work in which wo hav o been engaged Binco htät General Assembl), we mav bo oble to TCgard some parts of it willi satisfaction, and we may MOW other parts with fcolings of an opposite character Sometimes wo inav have cherished bright hopes ns to the future of our own flocks and of our own colonial Chuich, as well as with regard to the Church of Christ throughout the world At other times tho prospects of tho cause of truth have appeared to be of a gloomy character We arc nil, I doubt not, deeply interested in the questions of the day, and none of us tan remain indifferent to tho progress of Christianity. We cannot remember without feelings of sorrow that millions of tho human race are still in the darkness of heathenism and that among those nations where tho Christian religion has been professed for centuries, there are many things calculated to create uneasiness, if not alarm. Tho cause of education is advancing rapidly, especially in Britain and her colonies Knowledge ls thus more widely diffused than at any period of tho world's history, and a spirit of inquiry is widely prevalent among all classes of society It is n time of rapid changes, and old beliefs are quickly changed for novelties so that even in the sphere of religion con- servatism seems to have been vanquished by scepticism The truth of the Bible, the divine origin of Christianity, and the existence of God, are openly denied; and blank atheism is becoming the creed of an increasing number. Even some of those who stand in the front ranks of science are unwilling to avow their belief in God. While this is tho attitude of doubt and unbelief a strong current seems setting in from the opposite direction A fixed determina tiin is manifested to return to a ritualistic mode of worship, to exalt the power of the priesthood, and to submit with unquestioning faith to ecclesiasti- cal authority This tendency reached its climax in the recently proclaimed dogma of Papal infallibility Along with these opposing views of scepticism and superstition, there is an alarming growth in luxurious modes of living as well as in various kinds of immoruhty Who is to blame for such a state of things? Why has the Gospel made so little progress in the world, and why is it losing its influence over men of science and culture ? How much of tho guilt can justly be laid at our door ? Such questions as these must often give rise to serious thoughts in tho mind of the earnest minister, and when others offer to give an explanation of this state of things we are bound to listen patiently and candidly to what they have got to say. It is a common complaint in tho present day, that tho pulpit is declining in power, that the recog niscd teachers of religion are not fully equipped for tho defence of the faith, and that they have failed, in a great measure, to solve those moral and social problems, the solution of which the present state of society loudly de- mands. It would be impossible, perhaps, to state precisely how much truth there is in these accusations. We should not be over-anxious to defend ourselves, but we ought rather to search out our faults with strict impartiality, candidly to confess them before God and men, and sot ourselves without delay to tho work of reformation. I will in this address only suggest some of tho duties to which we are called by tho nature of our office and by tho character of tho times we live in. I. Ministers of the Gospel are now, more than ever, called upon to be diligent in their work Labour is the indispensable condition of success in all human occu- pations The barrister who is rising in his profession, tho physician with an extensive practice, the successful gold digger, and tho ordinary day labourer, are all hard workers Assuredly tho work of winning souls to Christ is, in this respect, no exception to tho general rule We all felt, I doubt not, long before our ordination to the ministry, that if we are to be successful labourers in the Lord's vineyard, we must toil hard in our master's service, and the experience of every subsequent year has served to strengthen this conviction No man could have more grossly mistaken his profession thin he who has entered the ministry with the hope of enjoying an easy life No calling can possibly demand more entire consecration to its service than the one we have entered nor can any guve fuller scope for the exercise of all the intellectual powers and there is none in which negligence involves greater guilt Thero is no position in tho world more honourable than that occupied by a faithful and zealous pastor of a Christi in congregation, and no man is more worthy of contempt than ho who enters the sacred office for a piece of bread, and who, by neglect uf its solemn duties, converts it into a sinecure Any one brunch of our work might afford full employment for the highest order of mental powers We have both preach- ing and pastoral duties to attend to; we have both general and special preparation for the pulpit; we require to j-tudv human nature, and tho Divine word; and in our case thero must be an harmonious combination of the active and studious life We have to know the state of our own flocks, and we should not be ignorant of what is going on in tho great world outside How to find time to attend to tho whole without neglecting any part is sufficient to puzzle the wisest head Some are tempted to devote them- selves all but exclusively to study and tho pastorml charge will then sustain an injury Others of more active habits are apt to neglect tho laborious work of pulpit preparation But whatever be the proportion of time to inch part of our work, we are bound to guard against wastimg even one hour in frivolous pursuits, and alwnys to remember the admonition, " Occupy till I come It is also expected of us that we should keep pace with the literature and science of the times, while it is often insinuated that ministers of tho Gospel are, in this respect, considerably behind the age We must admit, I suppose, that we are not so highly advanced in science as we might be, but I should be glad if this proved to be our worst fault No one who knows anything of science and of our work would affirm that the preacher of tho Gospel can have a profound knowledge of any one branch of physics or philosophy or that such knowledge is necessary for the efficient discharge of his duties To know thoroughly either chemistry, or geology, or biology, or any other ology would require a man to devote the greater part of his time to its exclusive study If it is utterly impossible for us to take tho omne subtle, which section are we to select ? Some would tell us that we know nothing unless we have dis covered the secret of Hegel; some affirm that we must understand tho philosophy of tho absolute and others insist that tho only thing worth knowing is tho theory of evolution We humbly think we have so many things of much greater moment to take up our thoughts, that we should leave such subjects to those who have nothing else to do. Still, when we find current theories power- fully influencing the public mind, and subverting tho faith of many in tho truth of Christianity, we are bound cordially and faithfully to examine tho foundation of such views We are bound also to refrain from pronouncing opinions as opposed to Christianity, and from branding their authors with tho name of infidel or atheist, until we have carefully examined and thoroughly understood them, and are fully persuaded of their false and dangerous character It is surely scandalous for the minister of the Gospel to be thoroughly familiar with tho state of tho money market, to take a keen interest in party politics, and to have an inti- mate knowledge of sectarian disputes, when he remains in absolute ignorance of current theories which are powerfully influencing the higher minds of tho community (Ap plause ) How in order to reach this necessary knowledge, we can find either tho money to buy tho necessary books, or tho requisite amount of time to read them when bought, I am not wise enough to declare We must just do our best Although, however, we should know such views, we are not to retail scraps of science from the pulpit We should thereby only make the house of Gcd into an inferior lecture-room, and convert ourselves into third-rate lecturers, as well as excite the con tempt of those we desnore to please, by intruding into a pro- vince which is not ours, and undertaking a task for which we are badly qualified We should be guilty of diluting the Gospel of Christ and of starving souls who came hun- gering for tho bread of life (Renew ed npplouso ) Fathers and Brethren, I feel that I only echo the senti intuís if cvtrv one of you when I affinn, that if the Church is to irosjcr si lntuallv, wo in tho miuistiy must be laborious workeis, loth in the study and in out visih tion rounds E Calaniy at one period utod to sltidv srxtctn hollis a day, nnd it is stud of S Rutherford tint lie eccmed "to piay eonstuntly, to preach lonstintly, I) eilo eliisc coDstantlv, to bt still in visiting tho silk, in c\horl ing from house to house, lo teach ns much in Hie sehools, and to spend as mutli tuno willi tho voting men ns if ho had leen sequestered fi om all the world hi nidos and, withal, townie as inuoli as if ho lind been constnntlv shut up m his closet," All the powers of oin imndshotilduochctift.il, tontccratcd to the tomeo of tho world no kind ot drudgei) thould be considei eel beneath us nndwt should locóme tho servant of nil that wo mav gain son» \\\ e must alto be j lenaitd to endnrc huidnos us j,ood soldiers of the crots of Clilist and though we »ho »Id liavo to endmo much opposition, chilling indifference, and bitter disappoint ment, let us not relax our edoris m the slightest degrco, but stcadfnstlv pel severe in tho(,ood work knowing thal in due timo wo tiuill rcup if wo faint not To sum up all in tho words of tro Apostle « Serving the Iord with all hutmilly of mind, and with many tears and temptations which befel me by tho lying in wait of tho Jews, how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, and have taught you publicly and from house to house tcsttfying bolh to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our lord Jesus Christ Therefore watch and remembor thnt b) the spaco of threo vcors I ceased not to warn evci) one night and da) with tears" "Mcduato upon these things, give thvtolf wholly to them, that th) pio fiting ma) nppcar unto all Take heed unto thv self and to tin doetnno, continue in them, for in doing this thou thalt both snvo thyself and thom that hear theo II Wo need skill so to direct our enorgies that a due proportion of timo and strength shall be given to m liters of pnmnr) importance, and not more than thoir duo to tiloso that aro onlv sccondar) and subordinate A\ hen somo ministerial dutiCB arc altogether neglected, and others cue lessl) performed, tho congregation will soon be tovttercd, I and the causo of Christ among tin m will speedilv declino But serious mjnr) is done to the oin o of God. even | though much labour is bung expended, whore a dispro- portionate attention is given to matters of trivnl im poitnuco lhere aro manv instances in hislorv of min wasting splendid powers on the merest trifles, and who hav o tpent tlieir liv cs in laborioush dome nothing , 1 Some mc too much engrossed with tho finaneiiil nfliius of the Chun h lho) set their heart on erecting au ed fice which vi ill bo nn ornament to tho town a credit to tho denomination, and worth) of the sacred use to which it is to be dedicated Much troublo is experienced in raismc tho ncccssni) funds, the cost of ereclion piovos fin mor,, seiious thnncven the most desponding anticipated, and i buidcntome debt is the result Then must be solved ino of the gieat problems of modern churtli life,-Ho« is this debt to le liquidated?
