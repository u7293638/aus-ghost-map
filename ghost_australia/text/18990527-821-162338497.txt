UNEMPLOYED LABOUR BUREAU. To the Editor. Sir—I would like to draw the public tent ion to the manner in which the unemjr ployed are treated at the Labour Bureau,"]) have been to the office for about live weeks and have seen some very mean work eaiH ried on there in that time. I have been tokjl by the Commissioner of Public Works tUatf. all notices of work were to be put on the notice-board, but I find that a lot of Wa men have been quietly put on to Barossa mirf the pipe track and other places through the influence of some of the members fo^ their districts. Those of us who have atteinx ded the offiee every day have not a ghost ojp a chance of getting employment while sueift practice is carried on. If the Labour Party? would make some enquiry into the work* ing of the Bundaleer works, I do not thinjn there would be one man out of work to-iay p but, Sir, hundreds of men have been jo® those works and discharged without beiinP able to get any reason why. I should like, to know if the Barossa works are at S standstill, or why the Government cannon put on a hundred or so there, as things drdf m a very bad state with a lot of the unem5 ployed. The Commissioner of Public Worksf said that there was to he no favour sfoownf yet why does he allow that back- door wAjr of sending men to different jobs? I for one! would sooner see the Bureau closed than! like it is now. Hoping something will soon be done to better our position, 'is.'''1 I am, Sir, &e.;, LE YARL 1 > [Ave have referred this letter to the c>up$t rintendent of Public Buildings, who assure©, us that tlie Bureau is managed on the falnf est possible lines. The men who were pulj." on the Barossa works belonged to the di&t; triet, and, therefore, had claims to first coffljj sideration. Mr. Smythe also informed tin that he has difficulty in getting the men <bdf, accept work at Bundaleer.—Ed.] )■
