COLONIAL EXPERIENCE. Founded on an occurrence which took place on Monday. A jolly stonemason, full seventy-five. Who to swallow his nobblers did daily contrive, A funny old fellow was he ; Near the Post Office, Sydney, was picking a stone, And humming the ditty of Molly Malone, With spirits elated and free. When a cab with a gentleman sitting inside, Did up to this stonemason quietly glide, So intent on his work was he, That the horse knocked him down, put a stop to his peck, And the vehicle wheels went slap over his neck, A most terrible sight for to see. From my windows I made a precipitate bolt, And was down in the street with the speed of a colt, Expecting to find the man dead ; But, there sat old Hardybones on a cold stone. As if nothing had happened. Not even a moan Came from him ; he only looked red. "Alas !" I exclaimed, whilst as pale as a ghost, And with trembling knees I held firm to a post. (The scene other people soon brings.) To our anxious enquiry, "Ar't very much hurt ?" The old fellow said, as he spit out some dirt, "I'm accustomed to those sort of things." I'm a very new chum, as you'd find did you quiz, And colonial experience, scarce knows what it is, But if this is a sample, "my word," I shan't be astonished at aught I shall see ; Such a comical thing in the old countree, (I'll stick to it) never was heard. PINDAR, NEW CHUM.
