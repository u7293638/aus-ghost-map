Fighting THE Wind. "What absurdity it is, under present circum stances for the Labor party to continue in their fight for what they call a Free Breakfast table. Year after year now, ever since Mr. Ash first tabled "the motion in 1890, they have attempt •ed to get rid of the duties on tea, cof fee, cocoa, and sugar, and this month another effort is to be made in the •same direction.- Even if it were agreed to remit the duties, which is not at all likely, the advantage gained would be of a most evanescent char acter, for when Federation comes—and we are told that Australian Union will be accomplished next year—all mat ters relating to Customs will be handed over to the central Parliament. It is not to be supposed for a moment that any resolution of the local legislature will be considered binding on the Fed eration, and it is absurd to imagine that the central parliament will forego the revenue derivable from the articles named in order to place a heavy direct tax upon the lands of the Common wealth. No other method of making up the shortage is available, and it is significant that the present motion for the remission of the duties is fathered by a Single Taxer. Mr. Ash, too, was a Freetrader with a strong predilec tion for an increased all round impost on the land, which no producer is likely to view with equanimity. The near approach of Federation has been pleaded more than once of late, as a reason for declining to come to a pres ent decision on important matters which have been brought before Par liament, but never was there more weight in the argument than there will be in this instance. Indeed, as there is not a ghost of a chance of ■passing first the resolution, and then the necessary Bill to give it effect, within the period which is likely to elapse before Federation comes, it is • hard to believe that its sponsor is really in earnest in the matter; appar ently he is merely after an advertise ment.
