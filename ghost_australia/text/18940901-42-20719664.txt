MUSTERING SONG. AIRâ€”"So early in the morning." Old master came to the old hut floor, And said, as he'd often said before: "To-morrow is mustering day, So rouse up, boys, and get away." The morning stars began to rise As we got up and robbed our eyes; Our horses we quickly manned, Add started off with whip in hand. We met a mob not far away, And started back without delay; An old white cow ran off the track, Old master went to fetch her baok. The mare he rode was rather free, Ran poor master against a tree, Threw him off upon his head, Broke his neck and killed him dead. Next morning I went to catch a horse To help to bury poor master's corpse, And in that most uncertain light I got a most tremendous fright, For there I saw old master's ghost Sitting on top of the stockyard post, Smoking the same old clay That master smoked on mustering day.. Where'er I roam, where'er I stray, May I never forget that mustering day; For then I saw old master's ghost Sitting on top of the stockyard post.
