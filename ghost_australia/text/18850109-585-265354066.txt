T h e nellgrious C a r d - Player. A private soldi*r by the name of Richard Lee was token before the magistrate ait Glasgow for playing cards during .divine service. Th« account of it is thus given in an English journal:—"A sergeant commanded the soldiers at church, and while ther.- the parson read the prayers :-nd to< k tha text. Those who had a'Bible took it out, but this soldier had neither Bible nor common prayer-book, but, pulling out pack of curds, he spread them.!**- f.ire him. He first looked at one card aiid then at another. The sergeant of ' the company saw him, and said, •• Kichard, put up the cards, this no place for them.' ' Never mind that,' said Richard. ' " When the services "were over.the constable, took Richard a prisoner and; brought hiiu before the Mayor; 'Well;' said the Mayor, ' wlint have yon lirough't the soldier.here for!' 'For playing cards in church.' 'Well, soldier, what have you to say for yourself?' 'Much, sir. 1 hope.' 'Very \- good, if not," 1' will punish you severely.' f : • - -V J have'..been,* ; said; the soldier.' 'about six ..weeks on the march. ; T have neither Bible nor common prayer: book.

" ' Well,' said the Mayor,' 'you have described every card in the pack except one.' " • What, it that!' " ' The knave,' said the Mayor. ' I will give your Honor a description of that too if you will not be angry.' 'I will not,' said the Mayor, ' if you do not term me to be the knave.' ' The greatm t knave I know is the constable •who brought me here.' 1 1 do not know,' said the Mayor, .'if he is the greatest hnave, but I know he is the greatest fool.' "' When I count how many spots there arc in a pack of cards, I iind three hundred and sixty-tive, as many days as there are in a year. When I count the number of cards in a pack I find fifty-two—the number of weeks in a year. I find there are twelve picture cards in a pack, representing the number of months in a year, and on counting the tricks I find thirteen— the number of weeks in a quarter. So you see a pack of cards serve for a Bible, almanac, and common prayerbook.' "
