THE DAY OF REST. THE STRENGTH OF THE HiLLS. By WALTER A. MUR&ELL.; Preached ia the Thomas Caats Memoria „ Church, Paisley. "The strength of the hills is His also."—Psalm Xcv. 4. Although the. strain of natural poetry is not so strong in modern as in ancient days yet the annual .exodus from town to coun try, from the crowded city to the breezy coa.st, is evidence of. the fact that we stil appreciate the rest apd stimulus that Na ture gives;" and here and tJhere, perhaps we may yet find some who, lika» Moses, wil turn aside to Tisee. some great sight—and who obtain a hint of God in the colours of a sunset, or hear the sound of His going in the wind, or read (lis kindness in' the gift of flowers. Each mail, must get what he can out of the landscape. We shall have spent a poor holiday if we tiave brought- home no more than the bronze upon our faces, or even a sheaf of nappy memories to gladden the harvest of the quiet eye—that inward eye which is the b iss of ' solitude, lie souL-d of the sea, the J u waving woods, ~ the lonely '" loch, the Strength of the hills, have done little for us if ilie.v have only put new vigour into our bodies and have not touched our minds to finer issues, or awakened a new music in our hearts, or purified and quickened our ima ginations, or afforded at least a 'gleam, a hint, a suggestion of- the divine. It we art. none the better inwardly, thfcn the summer has but served to make us healthier animals; the pageant of the year has left us poorer men jf it has not taught us that the heavens still declare -the glory of fiod, or the yet deeper wisdom that- the Father knows and cares «ven for the falling of a •sparrow. From a scientific point of view tlie universe is great, but from a religious point of view-it is infinitely greater! 31a> not thp two prove eventually to be almost one? ; THE MEN OF THE HILLS. There is something about the hill country which seems to make for strength of character. The men who live in tud heart of the hills often have a breadth, a sturdiness, a vigour,- a solidity about them' which i; foreign to those who awell in cities. And in spite of a rough exterior they have an innate refinement which sets them in thi company of Nature's noblemen. Environ ment has its part to play in the history of mankind. Beautiful surroundings <io~ r/ot necessarily make beautiful characters, but those whose lot rs cast amid suci: surround ings certainly.Tiiive something in their favour. I do not wonder at the pride of thi- Scot iu his country. 'i"he men of old tims were justly proud of .the mountains which were round about Jerusalem, and tbev sang of them- with full hearts, and immortalized them in many a noble psalm. The mountains played a prominent fiart in their national history. Hermon, Nebo, L>ebanon, Olivet, cach of them is associated with famous scene, some memorable event, and it is no wonder that these famous hills were regarded with a religious awe, and were celebrated in. national song, and became dear to the heart.of every patriot. 1 doubt -if I am wrong .in attributing some of the best traits in the national Scottish character to the uneonseious influence "of the noble rugged features of Hie landscape. 1 envy the men who. live among the hills. Tiie county of Cambridgeshire is so flat that it is said that if you stand upon a brick you cau see over the whole county. \Vho could write a psalm about a country that? There is. something infinitely suggestive in tlie strength .of the-hilis. 1 think I could get a nobler religion ouj: .of the hills that out of the plain. ]jet us look the bills for a moment in their religious "Tlie strength of the hills is His also." characteristics of the things made are of their Maker. What there I find suggestive in the hills I find suggestive of God. What is the strength ot the hills? It is not mere bulk, size, hugeness of form, raassiveness of outline.' is not one characteristic; it is a of characteristics. Strength a harmony 'of varicftis elements. {As I andered among the hills during the last weeks this text kept constantly recurring to my mind, and I asked myself in hat does the strength of the hills consist'!' are at least four elements which ay prove religiously suggestive and helpul. 'The first of these is Beautv. TIIE BEAUTY OF THE HILLS. VH,o can fail to be moved by the beauty f tlie hills? To see their green slopes' peckled thin with sheep; the grey crag eeping out here and there like a hoary attlement; the purple heather, making a east of colour; the huge boulder, poised pou some dizzy eminence, • seeming to hreaten destruction to the venturesome limber; the cloud-shadows passing like wift and silent ghosts along the frowning teeps; is not all this an impressive exhiition .in the picture-gallery of Nature, open every day and free of charge? And the thought of the Psalmist is this—that the beauty of the hills is in reality a beauty of God; that all.this panorama of living loveliness is -an indication of the loveliness of the divine character. A religion without beauty has no touch of divinity, about it Jo see the attractiveness, toe allurement of true religion we must go to the New Testament. Ihe semi-pagan terror which appears, so often jr. the Old Testament is absent from the winsome pagps of the New. The me of Jesus has changed our thoughts ol. God, and shown Him as one supremely j worthy to be loved. The God of the Chris ttan is like Jesus Christ. And having said that, have we not touched the verj springs of beauty, the fountain ol all loveliness? There is . no more beautiful book in the world than the Gospel by St. Luke, even if you regard it only in the light, of a literacy composition. But to him who finds in it the reyelation of a life which repre=ents' 5 the' Heart that beats at the back of the uni-1 verse — to him who feels ia the history of! •Jesus the deepest and. tenderest appeal'u ever made if- J-is spiritual nature — to him ' who sees in Christ the power ot Gtod and Y<V the wisdom of Godr^the Gospel will be - much more than & 'beautiful writing,-' much more than a transcendent of ' genius — it will bring Kin'face to face.ivitll •<•• the force that makes beauty of character^ "\ the spiritual influence which moulds" noble , , men aad*\vomen out of the elements ofe i penitence and faith and love. .For'what - ,'f" quire in His tempted, t.~Alid prayer that such '" a » r orishipper '* instinctively , offers? it not, .''And let the beMity of the Lord our God be upon us?" .
