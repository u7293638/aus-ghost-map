Suddenly two strong arms were laid on his shoulders and held him back. He lurned round :u dignant, to find no one anywhere near. At that moment a life- sized portrait two steps from where he stood fell -with a crash to the ground, breaking the balustrade and the stair to atoms. Had he not been detained he would have been kdlied.'
