THE PEOPLE OF THE MIST B H. 1UD1.II HAGGARD. (CONTINUED FROM SATURDAY LAST.) CHAPTER XXXII; HOW OTTER FOUGHT THE WATER DWELLER. Keeping himself carefully under the over shadowing ledge of the rock bank and holding his double bladed knife ready in one hand, Otter swam to the mouth of the Snake a den As he approached it he perceived by the great upward force of the water that the real body of the stream entered the pool from below, the hole where the crocodile lived being but a supplementary exit, which doubtless the river followed in times of flood He reached the mouth of the tunnel with out any great difficulty, and watching his opportunity, killed himself on his hands and slipped through it quickly, for he did not desire to be seen by those who were gathered above Nor indeed was he seen, for his red fringe and the goatskin cloak had been washed away or cast off in the pool, and in that light his black body made little she w against the black rock beneath How he was inside the hole, and found himself crouching upon a bed of sand, or rather disintegrated rock, brought down by the waters The gloom of the place was great, but the light of the white dawn, which had turned to red, was gathering? swiftly on the surface of the pool without as the mist melted, and was reelected thence into the tunnel So it came about that very soon Otter, who had the gift not uncommon among savages, of seeing in any thing short of absolute darkness, was able to make out his surroundings with tolerable accuracy 'the place in the corner of which he squatted was a cave of no great height or width, hollowed in the solid rock by the force of water as smoothly as though it had been hewn through it by the hand of man, in short, an enormous natural drain pipe, but constructed of rock instead of earthenware In the bottom of this drain trickled a stream of water nowhere more than six inches in depth, on either side of which for ten feet or more lay a thick bed of (dora groundsman How far the cave stretched of course he could not see, nor as yet could he discover the whereabouts of its hideous occupant, though traces of its presence were plentiful, for the sandy floor was marked with its huge footprints and the air reeked with an abominable stock "Now, where has this evil spirit gone to' thought Otter " He must be near and yet I can see nothing of him Perhaps he lives farther up the cave and he crept a pace or two forward and again peered into the gloom Now he perceived what had hitherto escaped him, namely, that some light yards from the mouth of the tunnel a table shaped fragment of stone rose from its floor to within six feet of the roof, having on its hither side a sloping plane that connected Its summit with the stream bed beneath Doubtless this fragment or boulder, being of some harder material than the surrounding rock, had resisted the wear of the rushing river, the top of it, as was shown by the high water marks on the sides of the cave, being above the level of the torrent, which, although it was now represented only by a rivulet, evidently at certain seasons of the year poured down with great force and volume "Here is a bed on which a crocodile might sleep,' thought Otter, creeping a little further forward and staring at the mass of rock, and more especially at a triangular shaped object that was poised on the top of the sloping plane and on something which lay beneath it "Now, if that thing is another stone, thought Other again, " how comes it that it does not slip into the water as it should do, and what is that upon which it rests and he took a step to one side to prevent his body from intercepting any portion of the ray of light that momentarily shone clearer and pierced the darkness of the cave to a greater distance then he looked again and almost fell in his horror, for now he could see all The thing that he had taken for a stone set upon the rock table was the head of the Dweller in the Waters, for there in it two dreadful eyes gleamed with a dull and changing fire as the light struck on them Moreover, he discovered what was the object which lay under the throat of the reptile It was the body of that priest whom Otter had taken with him in his leap from the statue, for he could see its face projecting on one side " Perhaps it I wait a while he will begin to cut him, reflected the dwarf remembering the habits of crocodiles, "and then I can attack him when he rests and Sleeps after wards and acting on the thought he stood still, watching the green fire as it throbbed and quivered, waxed and waned in the monster a eyes How long he remained thus Otter never knew, at least after a time he became conscious that the eyes had taken hold of him and wire drawing line towards them, though whether the reptile saw him or not he could not tell For a space he struggled against this unholy fascination , then, over come by dread he strove to fly, back to the pool or anywhere out of reach of those devihshorba Alas I it was too late no step could he move backwards, no, not to save his life, Now he must go on It was as though the Water Dweller had read his mind, and drew the foo towards itself to put the matter to the test Often took one step forward rather would he have walked again off the head of the colossus- and the eyes glowed more dreadful li than ever, as though in triumph 'then in his di spurs he sank to the ground, hiding his face in his hands and groaning in his heart "HUB IS It dr ME that I have come to fight, a devil with magic in his eyes he thought " And how can I do battle against the king of evil spirits, clothed in the shape of a crocodile a " Even now, when he could not see them, he felt the eyes drawing near Yet, as they were no longer visible his courage and mind came back to him sufficiently to enable him to think again At last he sprang to his feet with a cry so loud that the cave rang with the echo of his shout, and rushed straight at the for, holding the two bladed king in his right hand the crocodile, that had been waiting for him to lull insensible, this had ever been the custom of the victims on whom it fixed its baleful glare, heard his cry, and awoke from its seeming torpor It lifted its head fire seemed to flash from its dull eyes its vast length began to stir Hehir and hillier it reared its head then of a sudden it leapt from the slope of rock, as alligators when disturbed leap from a river bank into the water coming so heavily to the ground that the shock caused the cue to tremble and stood before the dwarf with its tail reached upwards 01 el its back Again Offer shouted, half in rage and hall in terror, and the sound seemed to make the beauty more furious At any rate it opened its hues mouth as though to seize him and ran a few paces forward, halting within six keep him sow the dwarfs chance had come and he knew it, for with the opportunity, all his courage and skill returned to him Sprinting forward he thrust his arm and the double knife ran into the yawning mouth and for a second hold it there, one did pointed-, upwards to the bush and one to the tongue

while Then suddenly it started forward past him and the tough he is rope about Others middle ran out like the late from the bow of a whaleboat when the harpoon line gone home in the quarry) Thence the dwarf spun round violently, then he felt himself drugged in great jerks along the rocky floor which, happily for him, was smooth A fourth writ and -nee more he was in the waters of the pool, ny, and being carried to its remotest depths ' Now, that man is a fool, thought Otter, " who ties himself to such fish as tins for he will drown me ere he dies find it been any other man doubtless this would luncheon so that the dwarf was as nearly amphibious as a human being can be, and could dive and swim and hold his breath, n) and Bec beneath the surface as well as the animal from which he took his name Never did these gifts stand their owner in better stead than during the minute of this strange duel Twice the tortured reptile sank to the bottom of the pool-and its depth was great dragging the dwarf after him, though, as it chanced, between each dive it rose to the surface, giving him time to breathe A third time it silver, and Otter must follow-on this occasion to the mouth of one of the subterranean caves of the water, into which the dwarf was sucked Now the brute turned, heading up the pool with a visit like that of a salmon and Otter, who had prayed that the line would break, now prayed that it might hold for he knew that even he could never hope to swim against that undertow It held, and once more they rose to the surface, where the reptile lily lashing the waters in its pain, blood pouring from its mouth and nostrils Very glad was the dwarf to be able to breathe again for during that last rush he had gone near to suffocation He lifted his head, inhaling the air with great gules, and saw that the brakes the pool were lined with spectators, who shouted and surged in a state of mad excitement After that he did not see much more for a while, since just then it seemed to occur to the crocodile for the first time that the man alongside of him was the cause of his suffering, at least it wallowed round, causing the waters to boil about its horny sides, and charged him 'With its fangs it could not bite, therefore it struck at him with its tail Twice Otter dived avoiding the blows, but the third time he was not so successful, for the reptile followed him into the deep water r and dealt him a fearful blow before he could either sink or rise He felt the rough scales cut into his flesh and a sensation as though every bone in his body was breaking and his eyes were starting from his head I ninths and more faintly he struggled but in vain, for now life and senses were leaving line together, and everything grew black But suddenly there came a change, and Otter knew vaguely flint once more he was being dragged through the water and over rock Then darkness took him, and he remembered no more When he awoke again it was to find him self lying on the floor of the cave, but not alone, for by his aide, twisted into a last and hideous connection, was the Snake god dead I The upper blade of the double knife had worked itself into its brain and, with a ti) ing effort, it sought the den where it had lived for centuries, dragging Otter with it, and there expired, how or when he knew not but the dwarf had triumphed Before him lay the ancient terror of the People of the Mist, the symbol and, indeed, the object of their worship, slain by his skill and valour Otter sim- and understood, and bruised and shaken as he was his heart swelled with pride, for had he not done a deed Single handed such as was not to not in the stones of his land he dwarf crept cautiously) to the mouth of the case and peered up at the further banks of the pool, whence he could hear shouts and see men moving to and fro, apparently in a state of great excitement " Now I am weary of that pool, he said to himself, "and if I am seen in it the great people will surely shoot at me with arrows and kill me M hut shall I to, then'' I cannot stay) in this place of steel with the dead devil and the bones of those whom he has devoured until I die of hunger Now, this water must come from somewhere, therefore it seems best that I should follow it awhile, searching for the spot where it enters the cave It will be dark walking, but the walls and floor art smooth, so that I shall not hurt my self, and it I find nothing I can return again and strive to escape from the pool by night ' Having decided upon the adventure, Otter began to carry it out with characteristic promptness As he passed round the rock where the crocodile had lain for so many generations, his attention was attracted by the skeleton of a man, who, from various in directions must have been alive within the last few weeks it was clad in a priests cloak, of which Otter, who was trembling with cold, hastened to possess himself As he picked up the robe with OUR hand be observed beneath it a bit, of tanned 05. hide that doubtless had once been carried by the owner of the cloak ' Perhaps he had food in this thought Otter , ' though what he who comes to visit the M nter Duellir should want with food I cannot guess At the least it will be had by now, so I will have it and be gone Only a vulture could stay) for long in this house of the dead Then he started forward 1 or a few yards" more he find help to guide his steps, but very soon the darkness lit carne complete , still the cave was not difficult to travel, for everywhere the rock was smooth and the water shallow All that he needed to do was to walk straight on, keeping touch of the side of the tunnel with one hand, milked he had but two things to fear that he should fall into some pit and that he might suddenly encounter another crocodile, "for doubtless, thought Otter, the Devil was married ' But he fell into no hole and he saw no crocodile, for, as it chanced, the M atcr Dweller of the People of the West was a bachelor AS hen the dwarf had travelled up a steep slope for rather more than half an hour to Ina intense joy) he saw light before him and hurried towards it Presently headaches the further mouth of the cavern that was

him a vast glacier of green ice stretched upwards, on which the sun shone glorious!)

of poison which was wrapped in a square of kid skin Soa took it and after examination said, Why, Deliverer, you have been borrowing medicine that will bring you bad luck if you keep it, and going to a small aperture in the wall of the cell, she threw the tiny packet out of it, and after it a second packet, which Leonard recognised as having been taken from Just as hall " There, now you cannot hurt

pockets the revolver and knife which had been removed excepted, Leonard turned down the rug and looked at Juannn, who appeared to be plunged in a deep and happy sleep for there was a smile upon her face Then he examined the place where they were confined It find two doors, that by which they had entered and a second of equal solidity The only other opening was the slit out of which Son had dropped the poison It was shaped like an inverted loop hole, the narrow end facing inward lins aperture attracted Leonard a attention, both on account of its unusual shape and because of the sounds that reached him through it Of these, the first and most pervading was a noise of rushing water Then, after a while he distinguished a roar as of a multitude shouting that was repeated again and again at intervals Now he knew where they must be 'They were hidden away in the rock of the temple somewhere in the immediate neighbourhood of the raging pool that lay in front of the colossus and these sounds which he heard rose from the people who watched the fate of Otter and Pian cisco When Soa departed she had left a fragment of dip made of goat fat burning upon the floor but very soon find expired, leaving them in darkness Ison, however light began to flow into the dungeon through the slit in the rock, and it seeme 1 to Leonard that the character of this light was clearer than that to which they had been accustomed in this gloomy land After a while Leonard sat down upon a stool, which he placed close to Just as bed, just where the beam of light pierced the shadows, and groaned aloud in the bitterness of his heart J minim slept heavily under the influence of the drug and he was glad of it, for when she woke it must be to a worse misery than any that had gone before Partly for something to do, and partly because the cravings of nature made them selves felt even through his sermons, he turned to the table and ate and drank of the viands there though not without fear that they might be doctored As the food took effect upon him some share of hope and courage entered into his heart for it is a true saying that a full stomach makes a braceman After all they two still breathed and were unharmed in body nor was it absolutely certain that they would be called upon to give up the ghost at present lines was much Moreover, he had lived long enough to win the love of the fearless and beautiful girl who slept near him, and though perhaps under such circumstances love, has ever true and passionate ceases to occupy a commanding place in a man's heart, even then he felt that this was more, and that happier day a might dawn when it would be, if not every thing, at least most of all As he thought thus he saw colour creep into Juannaa pale face, then she sighed, opened her e) es and Bat up " Where am I she said, glancing round wildly " line is not the bed on which I lay down Obi and she started, "take over "Hush, (baby, hush! I am with you, ' said Leonard, taking her hand "bosses but where are the others and what is this dreadful place ' Are we buried alive, Leonard? It looks like a bomb " No, we are only prisoners Come, eat and drink something, and then I will tell you the story She rose to obey him, and for the first time her eyes fell upon the robe she wore ' W by this is Francisco s I Where is Tran ciaco * " 1 at and drink he repeated he did his bidding mechanically, watch in, his face the while with wondering and frightened eyes ' Now, she said, "tell me, I can bear this no longer Where are Francisco and Otter'' Alas!

Scftora, fare well " Juanna read the touching and noble hearted adieu with an ever growing wonders, and when she had finished put down the book crying aloud, "Oh! what have I done to deserve such des motion as this " And then with a strange and bewildering in consequence she flung herself into Leonards arms, and burying her head upon his breast began to weep When she was somewhat calmer he also read the letter and closed the book, saying "The world is poorer by a very perfect gentleman He was too good for any of us, Juanna" " I think so," she answered Just then they heard a sound without the door, it opened, and Nara entered accompained by boa "Deliverer," said the aged priest whose countenance and troubled ey CB bore traces of many conflicting emotions, " and you, Shepherdess, I come to speak with you I As you see, I am alone except for this woman, but should on attempt an) violence towards her or me that will be the signal for your deaths With much toil and at no little risk to myself, I have spared the life of the Shepherdess, causing the white man, your companion, to be offered up in her place ' "Has that offering been accomplished?' broke in Leonard, who could not restrain his anxiety to learn what had happened "I will be frank with you, Deliverer," answered the high priest, when Juana had translated his question " The sacrifice has been accomplished, but with so many signs and wonders that I am bewildered, the People of the West are bewildered also, so that none know what to think The white man, your companion, was hurled fainting into the waters when the day, had broken upon the mountain and was seen to be grey , but the dwarf, your servant, did not wait to have that office sion for him, for he sprang thither himself, a>, and took one with him "Bravo, Otter I' said Leonard, " I knew that you would die hard " " Hard did he die indeed, Deliverer," said Nam with a sigh And then he told them the story of the fight in the water. " Oh I Jlravo I Otter," saul Leonard. I "Well, what was the end of it'" j "Thatnone know for certain, Deliverer," answered the priest perplexedly "At last the Water Dweller, from whose mouth poured blood, was seen to sink with the dwarf, then he rose again and entered the case, his home But whether the dwarf en forces with him, or no, I cannot say, for some swear one thing and some another, and in the foam and shadow it was hard to see, moreover, none will venture there to learn the truth " " Well, dead or alive, he made a good fight for it," said Leonard "And now, Name what is your business with us" This question appeared to puzzle, the priest a little, for, to speak true, he did not care to disclose the exact nature of his business, which was to separate Leonard from Juanna, without force if possible "I came here, Dell ever," I've answered, " to tell you what had happened " " Exactly," said Leonard, " to tell me that you have murdered his) best friend, and one who but lately was called a god I thank ) you for your new s, Nam, and now, if I might ' make bold to ask it, what are your plans with reference to ourselves' I mean until it suits you to send us after our companions " "Believe me, Deliverer, m) plan is to save your lives If the others have been sacrificed it was no fault of mine, for there are forces behind me that I cannot control even when 1 guide them, The land is in confusion and full of strange rumours I know not what may happen during the next few days, but till they are over you must be bid This is a poor place in which to dwell, but there is none other safe and secret Still here is another chamber which you can use, per chance you have already seen it," and placing his hand upon what appeared to be a latch, he opened the second door which Leonard had previously noticed, res ealing another cell of very similar construction to that in which they were, and of somewhat larger size "See, Deliverer," he went on, "berets the place," and he stepped forward to enter the cell, then drew back as though in courtesy to allow Leonard to pass in before him. For once Leonard's caution forsook him, for at the moment he was thinking of other things Almost mechanically he passed the threshold Scarcely were his feet over it when he remembered the character of his host and the lodging, and turned quickly to come back It was too late, for even as he turned the heavy timber door closed in his face with a crash and he was caged (To be Continued Next Saturday )
