ST. PAUL'S'CHURCH. A confirmation service was held at St. Paul's Church, Adelaide, by Bishop Harmer on Sun day morning, when the! church was crowded to its utmost capacity. After a processional hymn the bishop gave a short but impressive address to the candidates, exhorting them to remember the twofold meaning of the rite - of confirmation. ; Firstly, that of themselves confirming the vows of their baptism ; and, â€¢ secondly, being confirmed by the Holy Ghost and made full members of Christ's Church. The rector, the Rev. J. Sun tor, B.A., then presented nineteen candidates, 12 males and 5 females. After these had been _ confirmed the bishop gave a second address, in which he pointed out that the confirmed were not proof against tempta tions, but only given more strength to fight against them. He compared the elements of air, light, and food as being symbolised in the Christian's life by prayer, the Bible, and the Holy Communion. He urged them to' attend the sacrament of the Holy Coinmunion regu larly and with_ due_ preparation. . The address was attentively listened to throughout. In the evening the rector preached to a large congregation on "Liberty," this sermon being the third of a series on kindred subjects. The solo "If-with all your hearts".
