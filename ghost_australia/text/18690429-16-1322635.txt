PIANOFORTE PLAYERS. (St/ a Yankee in the Musical World?) IT IS R great mistake to suppose that piano I of forte playing consists in the knowledge of music mi and in the dexterous manipulation of the fingers j day and wrists There are some people who seem to play all over the moment they sent them sch as before the instrument Their bodies, from the roots of their hair to the extreme points of their looks, all contribute to the pot formance 'to watch such poisons playing, you would naturally conclude that the pianoforte is the most exacting of instruments And so it may be, perhaps, though to our minds we frankly confess that the trombone appears to us more exacting For if it does not require the foot, like the piano, it demands the breath and though it enclose you the privilege of assisting any al I find you will you must sit to play the piano-it compels into apparently torturing animation what over latent vitality j out face may happen to possess But why a person should think it requisite to play all over the moment he touches the piano is an enigma which we should be MET glad if one of our renders would have the politeness to solve for us There is Hen Ban police, for instance, the great pianist, who positively presents himself to his audience playing the piano some time before he sits down to it All his sympathies are with the premeditated labor And when he made after the performance his body still plays, just like the log of a " daddy long legs," that continues to kick long after it has been severed from the body On the other hand you will sometimes see performers on the piano who play only with their faces Ihon Jingera me at work it is true, but all their highly in acquired A on the face Some men who may be tolerably good looking before they take their seats will transform themselves with the first touch of the instrument into the ghost of conceivable things A strong occur will raise their hair, lift their eyebrows into the forehead, open their mouth, and in ink their ours A plaintive chord will force them into a plaint no gun They totally lost at the keys, and move their heads with the tenderest of emotions, as if they divided Irritating the sounds which you might imagine come out full of highly wrought noses A shattering note high up in the table, to be played so as to die away, will awaken their keenest attention They Bli am thomscUcs, with head on one side, To liston 'Thou faces seem to fade with the

the performer himself the sympathetic face observes the chief part, the hair and eyebrows playing the astonishing but, the eyes and mouth the line resistance, and the head regulating the performance of the whole by gestures as nearly as possible resembling the movements of a conductor's b lion Another kind of pianoforte player is the gentleman who executed the most difficult period in octaves He is, generally speaking, a thin melancholy man, who seems to have thumped all his cheerfulness and muscle into his arms and wrists When he plays he appears to wrestle with the piano as if he had got a deadly enemy by the throat He is no doubt a wonderful performer, but, like a burst hon very filling at the price The amount of perspiration he must IGBO during the course of the our would furnish a pleasing source of speculation to any gentleman with a statistical turn of mind He had no concern either for his own or for the feelings of any other person He plays as if he were thoroughly annoyed with the piano for making such an outcry 'the ends of Ina lingo s where the nails meet the skin pro red like Boro eye lids, produced by aggravated boating, yet he strums away with his raw tips in a manner that makes you feel quite faint He'll smash through an overture in octaves with a kind of murderous pursuit, and chase the maddened tunes with a freney that losing his musCular wrists and Boro fingers still playing after he liaB rison and made an epileptic bow to his audience But even this kind of pianoforte player is better than the miserable uidmduul who nods through a piece with the monotony of an automaton Ilia regularity is detestable He sits bolt upright, has generally loan, long, bony lingers, and bouts time with his head with the precise movement of the little figure in the organ that beats the of mbala up in a cornet You long for some one to give him a kick that something like an impulse might be imparted to him 'This kind of performer always selects a long piece His play mg makes a musical box of the plane there is no more soul in his touch than there is in his boot, and the pathos, the liveliness, the love, the religion, of the music in drowned through an monotonously as an organ go under squeezeD out tunes from his barbarous box You will seldom Bud a graceful performer amongst men on the piano And yet in spite of this obvious fact, pianofortes are always so placed upon the stage as to give the audience the best view of the pianist Few men know what to do with their legs the powders are, no doubt, great god sends, but they cannot, unhappily, always be employed, the legs of an excitable player will wrangle with each other through the whole performance, a cessation of their unnatural fond happening only when the pedal compels them into peace Women are much luckier than men in this respect, inas- much as the hostility of their logs is bidden by their petticoats And yet women have their failings too, at the piano If they do not make such faces as men at the time as they are beaten out, they convulse their bodies into the most perplexing of shapes, pursuing their hands as they rattled over the keys with as much eagerness as if they feared that unless they watched them very closely they would run over the edges of the piano Some women, too, are troubled with weak, irresolute little fingers When they strike on octavo the little finger curls up with a kind of mutinous saucy weakness which is very mortifying But, taken as a body, women are not troubled with half so many odd character duties as men at the piano What can surpass the absurd spectacle of a long hatred performer, who is shortsighted, but who is long aimed, long fingered, and long legged, violently) shaking his enthusiastic hair about his head, with his body curved into the shape of a bow, firstly because his legs and arms will not allow him to come too near the piano and secondly, because his weak eyes will not allow him to keep too far away if the sight is a frequent one, us anybody know a who is fond of instrumental music Onrrorontka have hitherto been confined to public pet for more, but the innumerable BO city of amateurs affords a much
