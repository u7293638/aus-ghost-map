:.:iBURNING DIAMONDS. I, the year 1694 it was discovered, by actual experimenti, at Florence that a. diamond&:would burn.. Cosineo III. had lone fixed in the. focus of a burn ing glass, and::after some exposure to the rays of the sun, it cracked, corus cated,.and finally disapoeared like a ghost, leaving no trace behind. Another. potentate, the Emperor Fiancis I., tried a number of valuable diamonds inf the heat of a melting furnace, and may have felt some gratification in finding that they had disappeared.. This was in 1750, and about 20 years later a magnificent diamond was burned in France. A jeweller named Le Blanc denied the possibility, of burning diamonds, and suspected some unfair play on the part of Macquer, the chemist who conducted the. operation. He had often, h'e asserted, ,exposed diamonds to-great heat, with the soleoresult of increasing tbeir brilliancy. . Then another jewel ler, Maillard'by name, who seems to have had a suspicion of the scientific truth, .put three diamonds into an earthen-bowl pipe packed in powidered charcoal, and exposed them without injury to intense heat.. Lavosier, who was present, proved in 1776 that by shutting out the air' the diamond was preserved in a furnace, but that the' admission of oxygen, with which the carbon combines, allows the diimond to buri.like a piece of coal.
