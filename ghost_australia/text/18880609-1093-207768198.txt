Mares' Produce Stakes 188, or a total of 1,026, SB against 98(3 last year. There are only ten more in the Melbourne Cup than last year, although the stakes have been raised to £3.000, but owners know that there are hundreds of horses good sprinters enough over five or seven furlongs who would not have a ghost of a sho.v ot petting to the end of two miles in the Cap; they are therefore wise in not sending ia their carries for the big event. It is not very gratify ing to lind there is no Adelaide horse entered this year for the Cup; but it is to be hoped that we are nearing a'change, when racing wilL be re vived again, and when we shall be represented of old in this a? in other big events over the border. The nominations for the Cauldlield Cnp number 116, or six more than last year, and the other V.A.T.'J. races have also filled well.
