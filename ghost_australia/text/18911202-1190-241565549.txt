For sometime past tho congregation of Wesley Church, Lonsdale struct, whilom tho leading church of tho denomination, in the colony, has been continuously decreasing in numbers. Whuro formerly there wero crowded attendances sabbath after sabbath tit both tho morning and evening services, there is. now only to bo seen a " beggarly array of empty benches." This haa giving great concern to thu authorities of the church as n whole, who cannot discover a reason for such a change. Tho building is one of the noblest of the religious edifices in tho city. It lias a splendid organ, possesses an excellent choir, and the pulpitis ulways occupied by a good preacher. Still tho people do not ' roll up" as in former days. A dark cloud seems to hover o'er it. which no means that have been tiled can dispcrso. On Sunday last be anniversary services were held. As a general rule, such an occasion brings for ward a largo audience, but on Sunday morning thu total numbor of tho congre gation did not reach eighty. This in a building which, will accommodate at least eight hundred persons was rather a piliablo sight. Tho maUor was referred to by tho Rev. K. C. Iiunn, who preached tho sormon.

Ho concluded by praying that this Sabbath mightboLho starting point for tho iurtlior manifesU- timm tif God's thiU'DP niul elntv in Hi'ik sanctuary.

The health of tho possongors has boon excep tionally eood with thu exception of ono death from paralysis. In tho Principality of Monaco, says "Truth," thoro is an opening for the Salvation Army. A otromi dotachmont ought assuredly to bo aonb to parade its streets and gardens with banjoes and sacred melodies.

This year Mrs Charles Taylor's pretty studios aro mora crowded thnn before with tho work of her pupils, and thero are very few copies in the collection.
