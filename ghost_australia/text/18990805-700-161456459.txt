THE HEIRESS OF FAIUT3LEIGH. ? -if i. CHAPTER XytH. . THB JIIlLL *T FAKNELEIOH. Faineleinb:-»eemed to. have been touched to life and biil'ianey by a ma^ic .waiul. Afler fifteen years' quiet, shadow, and nonser vAlism its big- doors were flung open, its windows uvre woils of light, urowmu- plants banked in lia'lways and .stairs eepaied whi^ptring of sunimar, and the preparatory strains of flute and violin were . .1 ? uearu. I Jasper Monkton stood bemdo Mi33 Abby's lions.? I ki-epor, a woman who had grown Rri-y jn her I service. Thoy wore lookiiit; on this rejuvenate! I l-Vneleigh with aimost awed eyes, for both re I membered tho last time the patter of daneers' feet I vu* heard over the spaciuus, shininrr fluors. I ?' It seemrt as if time hud (rone bnek— fifteen I year*— don't it. Mr. Monktou?' and Mrs. Ruche I fhool? hit head sadly. I ' H'm— yes,' teplied the secretary, grimly I ' f he old ghoito oujfht to be routed for.^,,Oli and I nil - ffaiety at Ftirneleiuh —mid Felix Lancoe I - think of that — once more a truest within itn I vralls, while ;i yoiiny Udy, the very picture of the I woman he wunted so much to marry, will dance I with him.' I 'Lnws, yes. It'8 n tjooil thiiifr to sot the old I mystery .at naught ; therr's no us-- in kocpincr on I mopiiisr, is thor^ ! But I wonder if Muster Pick's I spirit is hoyentifr anywhere mound ; what he I must think ofitali— ana hi.s own child very I likely — dancing with tht- man he got to doteet &- I fiercely Oh.dearie.^nie, what 'n' teiii]-er Master I Dick had.. I've, seen 'hi* black eyes flush some I times, when things didn't go quite his way, so I they fairly f lightened le.' I 'Well. I'd imagine they'd flash to-niiiht to sue I Felix Liincoe at Farncleiah, handsomer, if nny I thing:, than he was in the past, intHrPdting. I chitrmiiuT, with a good piece of hLs life still before I him.' I Monkton nodded his hvad. and over hisle:m fnue I r shade of thought passed. I '1 wonder will we ever know for sure about the I uld murder?' said Mm. Eocbe, musingly, a- she I luid h.T fingers on Jasper Monkton's- arm.' ' 1'oor, I dear Miss Alice I' I ' What els,- is there to know ?' asked the sec I rotary ' Suspicion lies dnvk at Biuhard Faruo I leigh'w door. His flight, his silence ull these years I can have but one interpretation.' I 'Yes; I know nearly everyone thinks that. I But I can't find it in my heart 1o believe that I 3V?nster Dick, for all bis passionate nature, could I ever do such a thingr.' I 'I wish I could think so,' said Jasper Monkton, I their different duties. I Another at Farneleigh was thinkinsr of the old I crime on this night The utory of it! as she had I heard it from her father's lips, had haunted Madge I like an evil dream.. I She was in her first ball dress, outwardly I glorious,^, but sad at heart, tm she jrazed at her I white reflection in the long mirror Often in the I dayof cheerless, hardship she hnd wondered how I she would feel as the moment approached for a I teu\ hall, admirers by her side, and unlimited I dancing in perspective, and her young heart had ? been filled with joy Ht the fancy when there seemed I no possibility of having it granted. But to-night ? how different it all was ! I She looked radiantly lovely. Her own eyes I told her that without the hushed, admiring ex I clumations of her maid. She was iu white tulle I and satin, a jrreat diamond atar aparktiny ag'tinst I Ler bare shoulde', a pink-white rose nestling I ag-ainst her low coiled, dark hair, and in her arms I tbe great blnssomy botiquet of lilies of the valley I which Ivan had sen: her, I Soon every one of position iu the county would I be gazing at her; all thinking her fortunate, some, I uo doubt, envying her. I ' If they knew,' was her poifjnaut thoujrht. I while bit toruess welled up in her heart. ' Oh, if I if they knew that this night, apparently so happy, I id thr- beginning of a difficult and dangerous I service which must be rendered, no matter what ? sacrifices must tollow. If [van knew ; if Aunt I A.bhy knew !' I But she carried her secret successfully. As the ? gimsts began to arrive aud she stood beside Miss I Abtiy receiving them, her pallor, the almost I electric brightness1 of her eyes, were ascribed to I tht.- exciiement and delight of the hour. No one I dr. tmeJ that they were caused by the expectancy ? of s I'm speaking to the man whoSe crime rested at I her father's daor, and whom she had determined to I brini: i-j justiop too long delayed. . . . ? I Ivjh was by her side when FcVix Lancoe entered ? the .nvnt hall. She was smiling into bis eyes, I foni'iy herself to respond to his flattery and B tei:ccv ui-nscnse with words as light. Bat at sight I of I,o. .'o.'s dear cut, white face and gloomy eyes, I her !?? -.rt iju.iiled no suddenly that she stood with I an lulf niTrighted expression, gazing' at the new I 'Wrner over Ivan's shoulder. ? ' WliatV. the matter, dearest?' Ivan asked, B iofi)y ; mid oven tm he spoke he felt he knew what ? had mail' that look illumine her lovely eyes. I : The new born jealousy, only a faint flame iu his ? keai i, leaped to brighter life^ ae he followed her ? guze and saw the patrician owner of The Crest ? bending over Miss Abby's hand in greeting. I . ' Ah, we are to have the sensation of the even-.. ? niR,' said Ivan, with a touch of mockery and ? Anger. ' Luneoe lured from hif eoJitnde : Lonioe, ? the oynoBUro of all eyes ; Lancoe, the handsome ? 7-^ho mysterious. You eeem strangely interested ? »n him, Mt.lg»,' be added with sudden gravity. . ? '; Well, you know,' she said, half laughingly, ? While her heart throbbed heavily, '' he' is a man ? Witha history.' . : . ? ?? I ' Oh, you have a penchant for mysteries, have ? you p.'

I Mtt'Rtl flung up her head and looked with a I i!ri dtnftnce into Ivan's half displeased eye3. I tn T,e )8 a problem. Suppose I try to solve him ? ?

She had a .part to play, and ehe was going to play it successfully. ?? It is vi-ry good of you,' said Laiioje, as he offered her his arm, ' to devote a few moments to me. I hope I'm not goinir to bore you.' They entered the pink-hued conservatory. The splash of fountains was like a lullaby mingling with the distant beat of the dance music, tbe per fume oft the, flowers wove a spell of enohanttneut m-^ne a»r, the soft lights shed a mystical flow over ' the place eoggestivo of fairyland. ' I'm sure you won't,' she said, with apparent innocence, ' if you tell me something about your I self — your life. People say you are interesting. Are you?' ' The lines deepened on Lancoe's face, as they paused beside the fountain. He looked at her in silence ? for a moment. 1 ' If it's interesting to be a failure— yes,'' he said, 8-jdly ; '' but I'd rather not Ulk of ruvsolf. There's something I want to say to you. Miss FarueleiKh. It seems to mo that Time has grown young— that I am happy us I used to be in th^ old days here. How like your mother you are I' he said, abruptly, his eyes fixed yearningly upon her. The words were an affront to Madge, and it was with difficulty she kept from shrinking away with evident disgust. He dared to speak of her mother ! His heart wis a stone like his conscience, If any thing had been, nseded to make her hate him, he had supplied it by those words. But he did not guess her feelings. Outwardly she remained composed, except that the lilies she oarried were crushed in her burning palm, aud her lowered eyelids hid any angry light. ' Yon knew my father — and mother — very well,' tin asked. ' I thiuk Aunt Abby tail so.' ' Oh, very well ! Your mother and I were friends from school days,' he said, ' Of course, yon do not remember her?' ' No,' she replied, feeling her blood tingle at his callousness, ' I wish I did. I was very young —when ehe died,' she said, musingly, then turned her blue eyes fall upon1' his faoe. ' Mr. Lancoe, they lever talk about my mother here. Tell me what you know about her, will you ? Did ehe die at FaraeMjrh P' He looked for a moment more like a figure of stone than a man, only his blaok, bright eyes alive in ms pale face. She saw his fingers open and close convulsively, and for a annual he did. not Bee.ni to breathe. ' I don't remember,' he said, slowly, at last, his eye? avoiding hers. ' I don't think she died nt Farneleigh. Iu fact, I forget. I re illy don't know. .It's a long while ago.' ?? xney nave told ner nothing of the Fttmoleijfh mystery,' he thought, with a wave of relief. ' She evidently doesn't dream that her father bated me ; she doesn't know that the manner of her mother's death is known ouly to one—only to one. I'ni glad they have not told her,' aud an anticipative joy went1 tb rough him. 'Perhaps shs'll let me be her friend. How lovely' she is. How she brings back my youth ! The only woman who ever made my heart quicken by one pulsation seem I before me again, pure, white-iobed, radiant. Oh, if that past'could be wiped out— its horror, its crime, and this were really Alice, free to be won, free to be wed — Alice, loving me. ' A bitter sigh broke from him. He moved away a few steps, passing his hand nervously over his eyes. :?;?.';? 'I have resurrected a ghost indeed,' was Madge's thought. -'Now to gain admittance to The Crest.- To-night's work will nut be well dona unless I arrnngc for that— soon,' ' Mr. Lancoe,' she said, when be stood again beside her, his composure, resumed, ' I've heard wonderful stories about the beauties of. your old house oil the hill.-^ Why don't you ask' Aimt' Abby ; Aiidiae to tea eoute day, and show us stima of the ' lovely things you've picked up dnrfiir yoa'r ^§11! tinveU?'
