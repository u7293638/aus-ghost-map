The Advertiser. TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1882. ME[?] of the Church of England have no doubt [?]ned with great interest the various paragraphs which have appeared thr[?]wing light u[?]n the i-iul.wij'c character of iJu-ir iwa biah<>|>, a:;d ihv app-tiutmc-at is s> important tluit tlie c- \'juy ill goner.tl will benefit greatly if the successor t.< 'ha vc-i!waUe Dr. Short proves to he a man of power, eiiQTjy, .and p-iiy. Tiio ti tmcl which we publishi-d fr..:ni a soriuvtii X)i-i.:id:fcu l>y Mr. Kenni-m at Bradford, ivLcu lie announced to his congregation his acceptance of the frfee of AdcLddo, caunot fail t-j impress the reader by its simplicity and u:iulTocicd iu<jdes*y. That the future bishop has gracefully waived his natural wL-1i to l?e conseci-ated by the archbishop .-iiid bishops who have cliossa liiiii for his new olHce, in deference to the supposed desire of the Synod, seetn3 pro bable ; and this shows his character in a vc-iy amiable lylit. Wliile S'-ms of tie minute details of 3lr. Kennioii's pvi-.vui.il appearance, v.hich corrcsi^mdujits liave supplied, border on the ridiculous, any facts shovrittg the attitude lie is likely to sdopi < >:i questions of general social inte r?.&t; arc it.ally valuable. Mr. iveimiun was f.-msorly an inspector of schools, aud ujay lie expected to bring liis expsriance usefully to l>ear on. tlie discussions on die subject of education which from time to tinio occupy the public wind at present. We !:avi_" been iiUoruscd by an iv-ijlish pcrkulical th;it ihe coming bishop ia a warm adherent of the Church, of Engla.ul Tc-nipcrauce Society, and himself a lot J abstainer, and the circumstance is not without its tignilicance. This society has made atioiiishing progress, and is .1:1 -tlou'uicdly Lecniuii!^ a ?rcat py.rer in Er.ulauu. Its i-atrcn is Her Majesty the <jueci>. its presidents the two archbishops, it numbers aciong its viee-presiae;i:s a!ii:.;.st all ilie bishops ou tlu be;i-"li— nearly a dozen of whom are total ab stainers—and it lias branches iu every <!i>K-ese in England. 113 objec'3a:id prin ciples are —1. The promotion <>f liabiis of temperance. 2. Tlie reformation of the u'tcinpvmto. S. The removal of the causes which lead t<i intemperance. The basis ut the faQcicty is uaion aud co-ope ration, on perfectly cjual terms, betwesn those who use and th<>.-.3 v.h-i abstain frcm alcoholic drinks, in endeavoring to promote its objects. Tlie moderail> >:i of the society has commended it to many, and there can 1-e little doubt that its opera tions liarc induced many an old t'vi-" to it-duce liis sUowauCi: nitliiu Lvalthy bounds, while thousands through its exertions have been checked oa the higli rtsiid tv> ruin. There is still an ii^uiL-n^e ticld for the worliiis^ i-f i:is s-'ciety, and the proce:s of htampin^ out the national \ice must be gradual and slo^-. Tlie csil is and giant cliorts arc uccded, and will be needed foruianyyeaxs t jc^me to O'l-eSvith it. 'We heard s.iniet!ii!s_'last year <??[ a kindredsociety being established in Adelaide.

In a China psper we read that a husband sold kbs wile the other day for £130. It was a sate tjf bSaHioo. The man loved the wife, and the loved the vlsxi. The husband sHpirtatriL liowevcr, for i?yinciit by iti???<wign?-j - imi cu the deed of transfer being presented to Lim be naturally refused to sign it till Lc Lad tcuivctl all the money. There was an awkward legal hisch; tfaa wife belonged to him till he signs! the deed. Acting on Icsul advice, tfce bayer and v.ife saw ors? only way out of it- Toere is u> action for specific performance in China. They drugged tut husband, and, inking hi* hands act! feet, stamped the doenment. The happJ" pair had scarcely sat down to their wtcdii;^ breakfast when the mother-ia-law, actcmpiEicd Ly a maudarian, arrived, anl they were both harried off to separate dungeons. As in England, these sad eases brin^tteirown bitter ornis. Xue wife tooK ojdum £cd died, while the Layer com mirlfd suicide, and the husband is a wiaover and has lest hu> ISJ dollan. After these mia fortuLcs he will probably do tbe same.

The chairman stated that the revcipis for the past nine months had been £??;*>, and tbe expenditure bad-slightly Cicct d; d that amount. The basincsi matters cf the church were more fully dealt with at the crJiuary church meetings, and he had not prepared an elaborate repent. In the Sunday- M_-i:ool there were —'? sAolaxs and 23 teachers aiidciiitxrs. There w:olGs church members, and the church generally was pro^resnng. Tbe ltcv. J.

A deputation, rrpref ontisg the committee cf the l!]ri>e!g Institute, waited on the Slinu>tcr of liducation on Monday mjrcinr, Octclx-r —>, to ask permission to Icl on build ing lease a a piece of land north of the present institute. The land had been granted for in stitute rurx'oscs, and it had bcVu intended to fcitn axx gituariam, but tlv* institiito was much in ntrd of the larger rcvonuo which the lease would brisg in. The iinaiuial position of tbe iu.stitutc was stated to be AsioUow* :— lteccivcd bv donstiona and loans StT.lMil; paid to the building account. tttSiM; received on currcct r.i.-co;;iit, i.1.470: paid to corrent iiccoutt, £i,U:O; la-d lut^Tiat on loaaa, 173J: tnoHi;:-th4ttLjit it' £-'10 l?*r annum had net to lie pai?i as interest oathf mortgage of t"?.Ul|>, ihere would be a tu}>lu3 over ?M5 woiion^ ?*siki:s*3. *' w*B tarr?ierst4i?filtaat the |>ul.]ic ?.-\p??cd *?> be li'.H-ra'.ly catereifor in tlie nsv ct litcrstuiv, thit there was very little iro.-ioit ox" money biuig avaibblc for au aquatiiiiu tor a lon^ liuicto oome, while outfct: other liaud *lil-* fff^uni bciugso near the beacli wcviivi Vh- valuable for a temperance hotel and lofreshniont rooms.

The plans, would, however, have to be submitted to Jtlr. l'ar&ona; for his approval. Toe Minister said be would make enquiries as to whether he bad tbe power to consent to the land being uted for other than for institute purposes, as he was not aware that a similar application had ever been made before. It be found that he could give the required per mission he w-ouM regard the proposal favor ably. Tbe fault of all the insutntes was that they boi rowed too much money. Hie third bow meeting of the season and 6rst day cf scoring for champion points in connection with the Adelaide Archery Cinb was held ou the Old Adelaide Bacecoocse on Saturday, October :!L The day was delight fuL tbe temperature being modified by a cool tea breeze.

H<> said the third man end deceased squared up on the footpath and fought with one another. i>oth the counsel present trrr<i to extract something further from the Tillers, but they onlv repeated what they hail prcviocbly said. Shortly afler 4 o'clock the coroner summed up, and after a brief retirement the jury returned a verdict of niansi^usktcr against the two prisoners, who were i-cminittcd for trial at the Supreme . Court, bail being refused. A meeting was held in ChristohorcTi School rctm. Yackalilla, after the sitting of the agricultural rociery committee, on Octobor 21, to consider <he question 'of applying to the PcstmafterCcncral for an extra daily maiL The great ciicomfort the travelling public is put to by tic inconvenient boors ot arrival and depart un* of the mail w&s; forcibly pointed out.

The increase in the pa? serser trafiic, and the relief of the present overcrowding cf the coaches daring tfci ummer months and at holiday times would, it was thought, enable the mail contractors to carry cut the service fora reasonable subsidy. A ccrcmiltte consisting -of Messrs. ISutter ?crtli, Jo-linc-, aad the Ilevs. ilessrs. Uikt, W^tt 5, and Morse was appointed to draw en a petition, asd to secure a deputation to pre sent it to the roitmaster-Ucner-.il a3 early as possible. Some little tiir.c ago ilr. 807.-cr, It.

It wa3 thought tint sonie crquiry tiio^ldbe made, acd in accordance with a promise the Chief Secretary has ob tained the following report from Sir. J. T.

On behalf of the Netherlands Icdicn Government, I have to thank tlie anthorities here fcr their kind and successful treatment of those of the Blaria's crew who were attended to in tha Adchsidc Hospital. SSome are now well, and sailed yesterday on their way back to Java." The following is the prescription referred to:—"I have h?i cors>i'*er:i.l.le experience in such diseases as J>crri beni. and wonld recommend tha fol low irg treatment:—ln the early sta^e inject cuiciuc into the arm (taken by the mouth it cccs little £ocdj, and use galvanism along the epine—a common portable machine, costing about 2.V, or 30s. A bottle of properly pre paicd liquefied quinine and subcutaneous injecting syringe," lie progress made in founding factories of various kiutia in th? City of Adelaide has been very decided during the past two cr three years. An instance of this prcgrc^s is afforded by the commer cial cLer^e cCectcd during the past few oaj s in connection with the house of sir. J. Williams, stationer and engraver. After fourteen years of successful commercial operations this establishment, which has at tained £ hi^h position as a house of business in South Australia, has been purchased by Messrs. Sands & McDougalL It is note worthy that thu last-named firm ia 183i also purchased from Mr. Williams the business of a biwilar though scarcely £q extensive a concern in Melbourne, on which they have founded -one of the great factories in Victoria. This makes the third venture of an old and respected firm. The first establishment was named Sands and Kency, and was opened in Sydney in 1552. The tame £rni bestowed its came on the Melbourne branch nearly thirty years since. Time has terminated tlie lives but not the names of these gentlemen, whose commercial reputation still stands hi^h, and the new partners perpetuate the business skill and enercy which rendered the names of Sands ard Kenny conspicuous. On the retirement of Mr. Keccy through fll-be&lth; Mr. Dugald JrlcUousall took his position, and the manage ment of the nrm in Melbourne, where the fcnancsa operations became so extensive that on the death of Mr. .Sands, in 1870, they were separated from the Sydney branch and rcse in prosperity and importance. On a large jriece of ground purchased in Collins .?-treet they built a printing-office and book factory of to extensive and perfect a character that it forms one of the sights of the city. A very active and experienced member of the firm has entered on the work of moulding the establishment lately owned by Mr. Williams into a form to ?uit the intentions of the new firm of Sands & McDougall, and it is under stood that these will not be touaUlert-'d com plete until a factory is established similar in character and completeness to that in Mel bourne, a result which it is to be hoped will be achieved. The anniversary services in connection with the I>ai?ti">t Chnr<-h, Parksidc, were held on Knn'iay ?Jctober -A, whea the .Row S. Howard of Cavrler preached morning and evening, and a flower service wad held in the afternoon. On Monday evening tea and public meetings were held. At the latter there was a good att€i.<!?ri?.e. Mr. J. M. Day occupied the chair, ar.d cspresscdhis pleasure at seeing the church iO Ijccutifally decorated with flowers. He (height they mi^ht introduce something of the kind into the church every Sunday, and not merely on special occasions. He spoke of the mistake that the Raptists of Park-side had made in selling a piece of land which would now l>u very useful for building f-chooU npon. In building the church they did not look far enough into the future, and had built too small an edifice. The Krv. S. Faireyread the report, which showrd that last year the debt of £412 on the building fund was paid off; but there were sundry expenses which involved them in debt again to the amount of £1,500. Last year 77 members joined the cfaorch, its beinsr received and three dismissed. This year the addition had been SI, making a total of ICI for the past two years. There were at present 2-31 scholars attending the ?cbool, an increase on last year. There was a great difficulty in holding the school in the jsburcb, and he hoped that some friends would help them to crecta suitable room. The tem perance class had also gathered members during tl?e year. Mr. McMillan read the statement of account*, which shored the i total rwoipta duriag the ye*r to hiv.? Kxai fCoi) ?s. Mr. C. 11.

A quoit match between the Gianville and Eovrdcn Quoit Clubs was piiycd on the grcucd of the former on Saturday last, Messrs. Cock and Bryden representing Giant illc, and Messrs. Ryan and Hall Bowdcn.

In the Advertiser of the2{Khinstantappear> an announcement of a marriage "at the rcsi derjce of the bridegroom's parents, Regent street, by licence, by the Archdeacon M&rryat;" on the lOih of October. The venerable archdeacon informs us that this notice is erroneous, as the ceremony was per formed st Christchnrch, North Adelaide. The correction is desirable, as it would bs considered an irregularity for a clergyman of the Church of England to conduct the marriage service in a private dwelling. The annual fancy dress ball given by the members of the German Club was held in the Albert Hall, Piric-strect, on Monday even ing, when there was a very numerous attend ance, and some of the costumes were ex ceedingly pretty. Daring the evening some amateur theatricals and a negro entertain ment were gone through, and on the whole the ball waa a great success. Dancing was kept up until an early hour in the morning. In another column appears the prospectus of the West Australian Steamship Company. The capital of the company is to be £30,030 in 50,000 shares of £1 each, and the object of the promoters is to purchase, charter, or otherwise acquire acd ran a line of steamsrs regularly for cargo and passenger trade be tween Adelaide and the principal West Aus tralian ports, cr Euch of them as maybe thought most profitable and ad visible; and also between West Australian ports and ports in the Isorthem Territory, Java, and else where. Madame Kate Thayer's last concert of the present season takes place to-night in the Town Hall. This vocalist has made a very favorable impression since her arrival in Ade laide, and those who have not yet heard her should not lose the present opportunity, as she ia unquestionably without a rival in her own art. The programme is a most attrac tive cne, the Adelaide licdertvfel, under Hcrr Puttmann's conductorship, having con sented to take part, while flcrrcn ScUraicr, Oeimann, acd Hugo Fkchcr will also assist. Madame Thayer's hongj arc the grand aria "II Polinto" (Donizetti), "Russian Bird Song*' (Alebeft), and Robyn'sprs&ty; composi tion "A dream." It is to bo hoped that the concert will be well attended, as Madame Th&Yi-r;'* abilities deserve recognition. A musical and dramatic entertainment in aid of the local Catholic I'resbytery was given at the IVrt Adelcide Town Hall on Monday evening, October 23, by some members of the Catholic Literary Society, assisted by a few lady and gentlemen amateurs. The hall was crowded to excess, as it nearly always is on such occasions. The programme was a very Iccg cce and of the u-ual character, cscept that scenes were introduced from, well-known pk.ys.such as the ghost scene from " Hamlet," and a scene from " Ion." Considering that these were performed by amateurs quite unused to anything of the sort, the represen tation was very fair. Those who took part in the proceedings were the Misses Hacken dorf, E. Pj ne, Williams (2), and Swift, Mrs. Cocn, and Messrs. A. V. and G. S. Leston, T. Donnelly, J. McNaraara, L. M. Tier, Flaherty, A. Angelinowich, A. Doyle, V. Roylc, R. Gellento, J. U'SuUivan, D. Gibbs, M. McDonsgh, J. Butler, and N. McGuirc. Kacb Gccnc was performed with considerable merit and decided success. Professor Simon gave his first public lecture at the Academy of Music on Monday night. There was a fair attendance. The professor, who was well received, described the dilferent types of noses, mouths, and cars, which to the physiognomist, denote various traits of character. He enlarged upon the best and the worst lineaments, the men to trust, and the men to avoid, and gave much useful advice to those intending to marry, illus trating his remarks by portraits in oils. The second part of the enter tainmc-Et was devoted to phrenology, fifteen subjects presenting themselves tor cranial examination. After the professor had given an index of each character from looking at the face alone a blindfolded seance took i>laco. Those on tbo platform changed places while Professor Simon had a bandage securely tied over bis eyes, and by touch alone he named them nearly all correctly. The test was the more satisfactory as up to this time the subjects had, by request, worn their bats. The applause from the body of the hall was very hearty as one after csothcr the fitters were identified simply "by the laying on of hands." Once whea a mistake was made the two heads were as much alike as a pair of billiard balls. In con clusion the professor, having given a practical prccf of the truth of tie phrenological science, pointed out how valuable it w<u in determining in childhood what career should l?e chosen to suit the natural bias cf tlie mind, and in enabling the parents to check the undue development of a particular evil propensity. This evening the lecture will treat of character as manifested by Che gait as well as by the features.
