Young Sentry Scared. Fires Four Rounds. Mr. Justioa Wriglit tried an extraordinary cosu at Winchester on . Juno 26 (says tho Daily Mail), a marine, ngod 18, of one ycar's sorvico, heing charged with shooting with intent to mnrdor it lance-corporal. Accused, it appeared, was nn sontry duty at Fnrton Barracks on January 24 .- from midnight till 2 a.m., and when thelnnc'o-. corporal camo round with the reliof party ho immediately opened firo on them . with ball cartridge, firing four rounds. Tho lunco- corporid wns shot in the hoad and thigh, and, uccording to tho dootor, had a miraculous escape frum death. Tlio marine laid, contrary lo the orders read to him, opened and used the hall cartridges, and on being asked for an explanation of his conduct, said ho did not know why ho did it, for Iio hud no ill-feeling against uuyone. During the inquiry it was shown that thoro had been a ghost seara at Gosport in connec tion with tho barracks, and tho plea now put forward' for tho dofeuce was that, having licurd older soldiers' ghost stories, the ucousea became unnerved. Tlio jury found him guilty of unlawful wonuding, but . considering that his aolion waa prompted by fright, reenmmonded him to leniency. The judge liberated tbo morino on his own recognisances.
