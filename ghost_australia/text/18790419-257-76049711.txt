AN APPEAL From England's favored nation (Iocs up a mournful cry, From huligor-strickon mortals An unavailing sigh ; Each day to these far countries The saddening record brines : Across the mighty ocean Its mournful cadence rings. Telling of want and misery That stalk the crowded street, Grim ghosts that find in London A terrible retreat ; Such tales of famine horror, Unrelieved, undepressed, As freeze life's buoyant current In every feeling breast. Enter one wretched dwolling, A starving fam'ly there Over a few dead ashes Cower in blank despair ; A transient gleamof gladness Lights up each haggard face As enters now the father, With quick disordered pace. He bears of food a morsel, Stolen short time before ; But watohful eyes have followed — Stern justice gains the door; He says in faltering accents ' For them I stole the food.' With what a world of pathos Are those brief words imbued. And this in favored England, Renowned o'er land and sea ; Home of the sage, the patriot, The noblo, learned, and free ; . While the whole world is echoing The glory of her name. While every loud is ringing With notes of martial fame. Shall ghastly wont and famine Their awful task fulfil, And not in human bosoms Waken an answ'ring thrill? Shall ire in our abundance Not heed their pleading cry, Who in the streets of London Shiver, and starve, and diet Go forth with earnest purpose, ' While it is called to-day i' Nor calmly ponder theories While famine's power bears away ; Ti« England's golden epoch— 'Tib in Victoria's reign ; Shall famine's ghastly reapers A deadly harvest gain ? Fat over hind and water Comes that dosparing wail ; Speaks 'midst our glad rejoicing, E^-ediooB on the gale ; Oh I that our fellow mortals (?Should starve in misery there ; TS6 hand stretched out to save them, ; . Alone in their despair. ', .' '?' . Blanche. Drayton, hood Friday, 1879.
