THE BALLARAT WEST ELECTION. The Melbourne correspondent of the Dispatch writes " The petition of Mr. C. E. Jones for tbe scat occupied by Mr. Fincham for Ballarat West, is creating quite a sensation ; as it appears certain that Mr. Finchara cinnot hold his ground. Mr. Jones has been very steadily at work, with a host of assistant*, unearthing votes that a committee will be bound to reckon to his credit and others placed to the side of his opponent, which must be disallowed ; so that there is only the very poorest foothold for the Fincham party. Mr. Fincham having been infouued to fight out the cise before the Elections and Qualifications Committee, without counsel, candidate to candidate, offered to solve the difficult* by resigning a seat to which he has only the ghost of a claim, provided Mr. C. E. JonÂ»s would consent, and refer the struggle to the bjllot-box. The friends of Mr. Jones, who know the strength of their cise, won't allow that concession to the weakneis of the opponent, and it is now quite on the cwds that tbe seat will be abandoned hy Mr. Fincham ; in which case Mr. Jones will only have to prove one irregularity to entitle the committee to spat him. Seeing that he has obtained evidence that covers thirty-eight irre<nitar votes, that task will not be very difficult Another offer ba* been put forward as a feeler, to the effect that Mr. JoneB's expenses should be paid, on a very liberal estimate, and thereupon that gentleman shonld leave his opponent in quiet possession of the seat that he has cot won. Mr. Jones does not see the charm of the suggestion, so that it may be token as one of the matters settled that Mr Fincham must clear out, unless his friends can induce the committee to act aa his partizan they threaten.
