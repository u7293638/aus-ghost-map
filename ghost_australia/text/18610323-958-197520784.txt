I immediately ma4eiriquiry'twliether it would be legal for me to. dbsb', and*'rwa8 told that it would not be illegal. I accepted, it accordingly, without the ; slightest hesitation1; aiid' certainly when I; met the House lyas, a^, little prepared to hear the honorable and learned member for the ?Ovens,' JSx^.ood, move a resolution to the effect that I had lost my eel^t; ' as ,t ' was : ' prepared to undertake a inntriRv ;to ^the moon. ?

(Hear, -hear;) But if ever a-, change should 7 come, and my constituents should think nie nq^ longer wormy of their confidence^ Ir. shall be most happy to get rid of the rfcsponsibi^ lity which it entails. 'Of course, it is unnecessary that I should refer at length to the general politics of the'dayiof which the daily prints have lately informed the public so .largely. (Cheers, .anil laughter.)'
