Select Poetry. LOVE'S KERCHIEF ) — (From the Mirror. ) [It was a custom in my time to look through a handkerchief in the new year moon, and as many moons as ye saw (multiplied by the hand- kerchief), so many years would ye be before ye were wed.] WHEN sunset and moon-rise Chill and burn at once on the earth— When love-tears and love-sighs Tickle up boisterous mirth— When fate-stars are shooting, Sparks of love to the maid To fill her funeral eyes with light, And owlets are hooting. Her sire's ghost, which she's unlaid With vexation, down backward in night : Then the lover may spin from that light of her eye, (As through his sight it glances silkily,) With the wheel of a dead witch's fancy, The thread of his after destiny— All hidden things to prove. Then make a warp and a woof of that thread of sight, And weave in the loom of a fairy sprite, As she works by the lamp of the glow-worms light, While it lays drunk with the dew-drop of night, And ye'll have the kerchief of love : Then peep through it at the waning moon, And ye shall read your fate—anon.
