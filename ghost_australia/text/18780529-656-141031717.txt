, THE BED INN. ' Towauds the olose of n cold, bloak day in tho early winter of , 1873, I found myself waiting anxiously arid impatiently in a lonely .and pioturesque spot on the banks of the Ottawa river, about twelve miles from the little town of St. Eustaohe, whence t. bad 'ridden that afternoon; and' thirty or moro from Montreal. ' ? - ????. . I belonged to a private-deteotive agency, and was here in this lonely place by appoint ment, with six thousand dollars upon my person,' in exohange for whioh it had been agreed— by what secret and complicated ne gotiations it is hardly necessary to acquaint bUU IUUUUE WllU— bU £CDbU£O bU 111U VDXbOlU stolen property in the shape of bonds, oer tificatea, and bills of exohange to a great amount. ' ; ??;.. , The place, as I have said, was wild and romantio, with a ruined sawmill .at tbe river's edge, just below the steep and rooky bluff, as tbe only vestige of artificiality in view. Tho sky was overcast, and the wind moaning dismally through the overhanging firs and hemlopks ; tho broad, partly frozen river, with the rugged mountains- looming forbiddingly on the further bank, and a few seagulls soreaming arid swooping weirdly in the gusts between the . low clouds and the' running foam, looked inexpressibly mourn ful and desolate,' arid tbe appointed hoar had long sinoe passed. me by without affording the faintest; indication that the rendezvous was; to be kept. : '.., ': ''?'?:' Years of experience in my peculiar vocation with criminals and deBperate olasseB had inured mo to diiappointment and fortuity; but. I must acknowledge that upon this occasion t felt my. patience sorely tried. I had every r'eaBpri. to believe that the compromise had been effeotsd in good faith (notwithatandmg the wily and unenviable reputation of the go-between; who had arranged for my meeting r with 'Crank Dudley,' the head thief concerned! In the robbery, at this 'particular hour and place), and my. ride thither frorii St. EnstaohB had boen slowly and wearily 'pursued over an unfrequented and most villainous trail, which ii ? would -be an abuBe of language ; to denominate a road, ' and over which I anticipated considerable difficulty in re tracing ' my steps should: I chance to be belated. ' ? ';;' '? :;-'.i '- ?'??? ' ; ? ':';:'- '?'?' -,. At length, however, I concluded that Crank had either mot with some delaying acoident or deemed it unsafe to keep his appointment — he waa an old and shrewd offender, whom any detective would ?' have cheerfully lost a finger to capture— and, remounting my horse, spurred up the bank to regain the road. I had hardly done no before an indistinct but unmistakable' warn- ing prompted me to unwonted haste. ' It was: the tonoh of a anowfljke melting upon my cheek. ?'??;' ? , - ? . '-.:., : Fully alive to the terrors of the fint great snowfall of a Canadian winter, I pushed rapidly forward in the hope of ? reaching St. Eastache before i the ground should' be covered. But I had not proceeded a mile before the track was hopelessly obliterated, arid the sir so thiok with the silent liftings of the Bnow, Iwhich came down almost aa fine as meal, as to render the landscape invisible, Bave for a few yards around ; added to which the temperatu°e was rapidly fall ing, and the wind rising in a manner, sug gestive of breast-deep drifts . and dangerous pitfallB. ?.???': ?..????-..? ..-. There was no place to turn back to, and to push forward involved a certainty of being both benighted and lost in the woods: In this predicament, I recalled a half ruinous, little red-washed hostelry, rejoicing in the ;nameof the Red Inn, which I had noticed at some distance from the roidaide shortly before reaching the river, and whioh hail afforded bo little signs of life as : I rode by it as to give me the- impression -that it had long lince been abandoned.' But 'any port in a atorm''was now my motto, 'and, swerving a little to the left of the track, or what had been the track, I spurrod forward in a direction that I. thought would lead to its vioinity. : I was not only soon apprised of my proximity to it by the bark of a dog, but, upon catching sight of the house itself— a rambling, two-story, frame affair, whose sides had long before lost most of the dull, red colour chat gave it a name as a publio-honee — Iwasoverjoyed to see the lower windows glowing with firelight. ,., .. ?.? , .-'?.??:? , i To obtain admittance, give my horse in charge of the proprietor, who seemed to be the.'only man about the place, and seoure a oapital thawing-spot before the great fire place in the common loom within, at whioh the housewife was also busying herself with some cooking, was the work of but a few moments:. She was a tall, bony, muscular woman, in middle life, with a restless, sullen expression of the. eye that augured badly of her husband's peaoe of mind, and a general gloom and: taciturnity of ,. -bearing; But I have a, way ot speedily making myself at ease' with folks of various sorts, and drew from her in a few minutes that she was Sootch and her husband a French Canadian ; that, they, lived, there all alone . Bince the building o£ the nearest railway had alto gether, difltraotod travol from what had onoe been the deoent highway near at hand ; and that they were so poor as to be eager to sell out at the first opportunity, though still able to accommodate any unfastidious guest who might oharice along, as I bad' done, i The landlord's name was Burohois, and he presentlyoame baok to the house, announc ing that my ' horse . had been comfortably housed and fed, and venturing to prediot that, of course, I would remain overnight. ' ' 'I could return to St.. Eustaohe in a couplo of hoars, if ,1 only had a guide,' Baid I, looking anxiously out at the gathering twilight, through whioh the snowstorm was still whirling its sifted burthen with, fierce, persistency. ' Besides, - T-. fear that 1 have barely, enough money 'with me to meet even my.expenses'atypurinn. .: ','. : .'.',','..

It isn't likely yoii|ll find anyone to guide you through such a tempest, even the half breeds 'having ' deserted this miserable wilderness, with the building of that cursed iron road that his impoverished hi all,' laid the landlord, of the Red Inn in a gruff voice; ?'and. a dollar will, pay for monsieur1! accommodations overniKht. .

I then concluded to remain, arid began to fid myielf of my overnhoes ind other iuperfluous coverings, while taking in every thing about ma with a!swiftneu and astute ness of vision that long habit hid almost converted into aeoorid nature. , ', . , ., , | It was evident that my entertainers were mlaerably poor. The large room in which we then were was probably the only brie in' use . on the lower story, and it ' seemed to answer, all purposes of reception, cooking, dining,-. , ?. and . lounging ,[ combined. , ' . The furniture had seen better day*, but, was 'now eo broken, -battered and, infirm ai to be scarcely,, fit for use, while a long rifle sus pended, with. hunting accoutrements, over the j cUimney-pitce, and - pair ? of anpwihoei leaning in one corner of the room Were evidence! that, the unprofltsblBnetB . of inn keeping ,wa», eked, out by the, fortune* of the, phtae in (he, wild forest round «bou^ , i . ,. - Minp host Mmsejf had an ^veabiMflttrao tive »ppeanoBt than hii wife. , He.

The X'b long, hatchet-face was nearly covered grizzly beard of straggling growth, and from underneath hia bushy eyebrows, which were nearly as heavy as his moustaohe,. his steel-gray eyea glinted with a dull, discon tented glowtbiit might have proceeded from brooding misery or vicious instinct, it was hard to tell which. : ; ' I was nlao not long in. diBcovering— from the frequent little scoldings that wore inter-, changed, though , always in the,, Canadian patois, which I perBiBted in appearingignorant of— that the piir were far frorii living happily together, and came to the conclusion that theirs was certainly not an example, so lnuded by poets, of the marriage-tie beiuR only the closer and more lovingly renewed by adversity, and distress. 1 made these mental notes in for leas time than it has taken me to express them here ; and when I resulted my seat by the ; fire with an air of all the carelessness and trustfulness that I could assume, Bourchois placed some glasses and a bottle of brandy ; upon the table, arid gruffly invited me to join him in un petit verre. But I made a point. of never .drinking out of strange bottles under suspicious circumstances,' and, excusing myself on the plea of being under medical treatment for a painful complaint. I produced my own brandy flask, which ;i pretended to have been especially prepared for me by riiy physician, and, pouring out a small quantity, touched his glass merrily, at the same time wishing; him, and his: consort better luck in the future. ' . .'.! He seemed a little taken aback by this manoeuvre, and only replied to my well wishes;by first a grunt, and then a short Diner. laugn, as m. derision at tne.prepos terousneBs of their purport; after which he arose, and, .opening the door— through , which a column of snow, came suddenly bustling like an angry, ghost— whistled in the dog. — a rough, savage-looking brute, of the stunted Newfoundland stock, which, after snuffing of my legs BUBpiciously, Bhook the snow from his shaggy coat, and Btowed himself away, in ' a corner. The supper, which was soon afterwards served ub by tho woman, made up in quantity what it lioked in quality — consisting of bacon and venison, , with- hot griddle-cakes arid excellent coffee'; and as I was both hungry and tired Penjoyed it very much. There was nothing to read when it was over, and, as neither my host nor hostess appeared to desire sociability in the way of conversation, I was Boon dozing comfortably in my chair, though after an old habit of mine whioh enables me to enjoy the recuper ation of semi-slumber without altogether shutting but a conaciouanesa of what is going on in the waking world around me.' However, as I heard them speaking together in low voices, and in French, I paid little attention to what they were saying1 until a reference on the part of the man to ' Monsieur La Crank' at once aroused me to livelier attention, and to a recollection of my recreant rendezvous-maker of tho river-bank at the same time; but the woman only said in response : 'Yes, this is unmis takably the man,'. and then' their conversa tion drifted upon topips of a personal nature, which soon developed inio a conjugal wrangle, and might have proceeded to blows had I nob just thenstratched myself with a yawn, and expressed a desire to be shown to my room. ? , Before obeying me, the landlord again opened the door, and kicked the dog out into the storm, after which he lighted a candle, and led the way tip a narrow, rickety stair case that ascended from a little corridor just off the side of the room occupied by the fire place, and, proceeding- along a hallway to what must have been the remotest extremity of the lonely house, ushered me into a. large, : bare- walled chamber, devoid of furniture except a bedstead, a small table, and a three legged stool, but somewhat redeemed from absolnte oheerleBsness by a bright wood-fire that had been built, upon the hearth, and whose leaping flame-tongues went np the chimney with ft roar as *he fierce Rtorm shook the one window ss if with a giant's grasp. : ] Altogether, the accommodation was better than* I had anticipated, and, after i assuring myself that the door was provided with both lock and bolt of substantial quality, I bade my host good-night, looked myself in, and prepared to make myself i comfortable for. the night. After a brief examination of the walls, to make sure there was no other entrance, I took off everything; but my undergarments, heaped the fire with all the spare wood that had been provided, blew out the candle, and, : leaping into the luxurious undulations of \- an old-fashioned feather-bed — after putting my revolver urider my pillow — was soon sound 'asleep.-1 : I was suddenly awakened from profound, dreamless slumber by I don't know what not by any noise, or vibration, or stealthy movement, but by a certain indefinable con sciousness that someone else was in' the room ; and at once sat holt upright in bed, with my hand upon the weapon beneath the pillow. The storm had subsided, and everything was ias still as the tomb; and, the.,fire haying sunken away 4o scarcely perceptible embers, the room was almost pitch-dark ; but none the less was I instirio tively certain that a stealthy intruder, was in there,, and- that , a terrible danger was impending over me. ' i ?, ?' ; . I have tha viaion of a cat in an emergenoy, and in a moment, as my eyas grew acoua tomed to tho darkness, I perceived what I knew to be the short, thick-set form of Bourchois, orouohe'd upon ' his hands arid - knees, arid ' creeping noiselessly toward the couch from the opposite side of the room, with » knife between his teeth, though, not being bo sharp-sighted as I, be was not aware of my being awake and on my guard. A yawning trapdoor in the floor: dosed beside him, arid almost directly under the window, betrayed: the manner of his having effected an entrance.!.-.!,;.'! ?.::.-'. ?? ?' . ?. .'; '?'???' :,:?;. \\-'.\\-.,.- The:truth flished aoroas me in an instant. Crtnk Dudley! had not intended to meet Die at the rendezvous, but! it .waa- probably decided Ithat I; should be belated and stop at ' this very place— thla remote and obscure hostelry, to be murdered by his aocoinplloea, the; landlord and his wife, for , the aake of the booty known to be upon my person, without a return of the. equivalent agreed upon, r . . .; .;., ., .,..,. ,?..... . . ? \\... ;, I I hid. never 'baenin anch a desperate position before, but hud often imagined to myself ;. what I would do under similar oirpumatanoea— aa I 'uppose we all of ? ua do at timei— and now did not feel any diminu tion of my usual nerve and presenoe of mind. | Withoat a moment's hesitation, I cocked my revolver , under the pillow, in order, to deaden the alight clicking sonud of the lock, , and then, levelling it rllently at the , bushy head of i the kdyanclrig ;aaaiasin, pulled the, trlggaie with no more compunotion than if I '? had been facing *j wolf or i. ta»ke. .'
