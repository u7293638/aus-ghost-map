ECHOES OF MELBOURNE TBy The Ghost.1 With the exception of talking, Parlia ment has done nothing during the week. The unsettled state of Continental Europe seems to have infoctod honourable mem bers, and none of the measures on the notice paper have been advanced in any degree towards their final stages. Accord ing to announcement, the Irrigation Bill and the estimates were to have engaged the attention of the people's representa tives on alternate evonines. But if Gillies proposes, the Houbo disposes, and the 'good intentions' of the Premier have gone to swell the amount of paving material with which, the proverb tolls us, a certain torrid locality unmentionable in polite society outside clerical circles is laid down. Honourable gentlemen have availed themselves largely of tlie Parlia mentary privilege of moving tho adjourn ment of the House, in order to introduce all sorts of extraneous subjects. The most important of these was undoubtedly the de fence question, and from a perusal of the , debate, it will be easy to infer that Vic toria is again about to become the victim of a 'war scare.' The Government has announced; its intention of strengthening the armaments of the forts at the Heads and in Hobson's Bay, of keeping tho torpedo boats in readiness for instant action, and not only 'keeping their powder dry,' but laying by a goodly store of ' villainous saltpetre ' for future emergen cies. [But why In the name of common sense should the calibre and range of all durtguns be made public ? There is surely a point; beyond; which curiosity in regard, to pome1 matters becomes more imperti rience;,'and any. Government would be fully , justified.ini withholding specific informa ipn, which; would certainly be most useful 10 an, enemy,. and can be but o£ very scant i interest to ? the questioners. At ! times — generally at wrong . times — the-. - Premier.can be curt and 'bumtious ;' at., Other, times his fear of giving offence ' to ;he Opposition renders him top cpininunK: ?catlve... The Premier is assuredly not; 'the ?still,, strong , man '[ that should' always^ bo, at the head of a. Government. , , 'Once niore has the Assembly by a, large majority passed, the bill for. the amalgama tion of the, two . branches oi the legal pro fession. By 47 .to 13. the Lower, House lias abolished the line, of demarcation between the barrister and solicitor. The intention, of: the Assembly in taking this course is to ',' cheapen ' the law. The evidence piven before the'Select Committee that some time since enquired into the matter, negatives this view, and the leading practitioners in b'oth branches of the legal fold are averse to the change. ,A petition signed by all the large firins of solicitors in Melbourne, has been presented to the Legislature— and the Law Institute has also passed, a resolution— against the innovation. There is little, doubt but that thp measure will meet, the fate of . its predecessors when before the Council, and be once more re-! legated to the, waste paper; basket. ;Qno ? supporter!, of the bill — a lawyer too — , urged .as. the chief merit of the measure^ that it would ensure clients being in future' *' robbed by only one man, instead of by two.' ; , But . just as Mawwonn liked ;to b.e despised, so apparently do the grave,! potent, and reverend seignoirs of ;:the. IJpper Chamber like to be fleeced by both; ? attorney and barrister — and so the bill will be again rejected. , , ..; i ', The fact thatl(an animal at the annual show of the Sheep Breeders' Association, mow taking place in Melbourne— .which: said sheep contains one of.., the newest, strains of imported blood^haB,been:ad liifl(TPil f.Ylfl' first.
