Watsford, in dealing; with the ? subject of ' How to Obtain Pentecostal Christi anity,' said humanly speaking it was ini- ? possible a man should ever cease from sin and obtain- the blessing ; but through God's Holy ' Spirit, it was possible. For that Christ died, . and for that the Holy Ghost -was given, and because of that they were commanded to;be filled with the Spirit. ' Without holiness none ? could see God; therefore must' they obtain it . through . faith and ,; through obedience and through trust in God.: -.' . .'' '. ,. '-...,. The llev. S. C.

Webb detailed his conversion, his experience of Christian life and ministry, and said he was faithful in his work, but he ? was thoughtful about his reputation. But there came a change which was the most won derful in his life. He had related his experi ence to encourage others to go in for this great blessing, and if they knew as he knew how it meant the subjugation of. self and the fulness of joy in the Holy Ghost they would not rest content without it. The meeting closed with the Doxology, and an after meeting followed, which, was largely .attended. . ? - . '?....' ?
