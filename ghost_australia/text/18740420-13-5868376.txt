THE ELECTIONS. MR. FRANCIS AT RICHMOND. The Hon J G Francis met the electors of Richmond at the East Collingwood Orderly room, on Saturday evening About 300 persons were present Councillor Benjamin who presided said Mr. Francis political career was a sufficient guarantee that he was the right man for the position he sought Mr Francis having briefly referred to the motives which had guided his political career and the causes which had brought about the present issue which had been placed before the country said he had observed with pleasure that one of the leading candidates who was desirous of returning to public life had stated that he noticed there were less activities less vituperation and less bitterness in the last Assembly than in former ones Consideration for those who differed with him in opinion he held to be necessary to a public man and that there had been less ill feeling exhibited in the last Parliament he held to be in a measure owing to the spirit in which the Ministry had acted-(cheers)-but the consideration which he had a right to expect from, a prominent gentleman who had been one of his colleagues he was bound to say had not been accorded to him in an address which was recently delivered at Warrnambool No merit was given for the fact that he (Mr Francis) accepted there sponsibility of office supported only by the barest majority which ever established a go eminent a majority of two out of 78 under the most critical circumstances or for the fact that they had succeeded in car going at any rate one measure which was all in extent in its present influence and future prospects He was disposed in like manner to deal with a former leader and his hitherto retarded friend He was not going to blame the acts of others and the criticism which Sought to carp and condemn and do every thing but approve because they all knew as well as he did that it was one thing to destroy to criticise and condemn and another to carry successfully through and construct (Applause ) He then adverted to the rejection of the I electoral Bill by the Legislative Council and the general acknowledgement that many of its provisions should be brought into force the irresponsibility of the Upper House and the manner in which the Government proposed to pre went dead locks avowing his belief that if the scheme were not earned or something of a better character emanating from it the Council would have to take rougher measures from rougher men. He then said that although gh the Ministry had placed this scheme of reform in the foreground he meant God willing and should he be in office to deal with the questions of local government the incidence of taxation and they amendment of the tariff - as to payment of members, he should not ask for its repetition and on all these he asked them to believe that he simply said ditto to his former professions He had not intended to refer to the utter ances of other candidates, nor did he propose to himself the task of doing so, but when there came an utterance from a distinguished politician which was so manifestly inconsistent with the merits of the case and when his arguments were used as a means to damage the Ministry of which he (Mr Francis) was a member then if he affirmed the series of assertions to be a political blunder it was his duty to back it and he only did this because he was told It is doing you harm that assertion of O'Shanassy s surely you are not going to leave it unanswered And he felt that it was so patently either an error of misunderstanding 01 an error of fact that he must allude to it Sir John O'Shanassy said at Kilmore - In the early days of the colony we were fettered by a very high tariff made by New, South Wales in a short period the Governor Sir Charles Hotham did him the honour to ask him to co-operate with other gentlemen in making a simple and less expensive tariff The tariff which was then framed was a very simple one They pro posed that 10 articles should be noted and that the duties on 150 should be able visited and these 10 articles it-was gratifying for him to be able to state produced what appeared to be a most wonderful result one which a few persons connected with commerce to whom he had mentioned the figures could scarcely believe He had been so long in the Customs that he thought he knew something of the tariffs of Victoria. He thought he remembered coming to the colony at the end of 1865 is, that there was a tariff in existence then that the alteration in 1851 was the slightest possible modification of it and that instead of 150 articles being reduced to 10 in 1853 when he came here there were only nine articles taxed subsequently made 10 by the introduction of the gold duty Sir Chas Hotham was not in the colony then But he thought Surely, OShanassycaniiotbewrong he would never takes credit to himself for being the creator of a theory of such high scientific intelligence which for many years exercised the admiration of surrounding colonies if not of surrounding nations and he sent a note down to the Custom house asking how Sir Charles Hotham and Mr O. Shanassy came to make a tariff in 1851 when he remembered it in Latrobes time and the answer he got was this- The tariff of Sir C Hotham was passed in 1854 (December) and yy as a modification of that passed in the previous year under Mr Latrobe commonly known as Cassell s tariff and a comparative statement was annexed He found that the only alteration in this Cassell s tariff was the increase of the duty on spirits from 7s to 10s per gallon the other nine articles were the same line by line. He had no doubt there had been some error of memory on Sir John O'Shanassy s part-the fact was he went down to the Custom house the other day to get a dose of figures and they did not agree with him That was quite certain (if an ghter ) He knew this for he obtained a copy of the figures which were given him then Sir John O'Shanassy said - Taking the revenue of the five years from 18 27 to 1801 it was found that this tariff which comprised only 10 articles had including the gold duties produced a revenue amounting to £1 000 000 yearly for the year 1873 the revenue from the Customs was £1 SOI 000 including, wharfage and harbour rates (£101 000) It would thus be seen that considering the population of the colony which in 1859 was 400 000 had since been doubled a term of 10 articles had produced immeasurably larger returns than a tariff comprising 300 articles Iii so when there were 100 000 people here and the tariff brought in £1 000 000 the taxation was £1 per head, now that the Cue toms revenue brought in £1 800 900 and there were 800 900 people the taxation upon the people was only £2 per head and there fore it was quite certain that relatively there must instead of an increase have been a decrease of taxation unless his figures were wrong Let them see how the £1,000 000 was produced in ISoO when Sir John O'Shanassy said his tariff was in operation In that year 1 519 384 gallons of sportswear drunk by these 400 600 people which brought in a revenue of £75 0 11 We had not the same class of population now If we had kept up the same capacity for drinking we should not want any other source of revenue but he was not prepared to say that he regretted that we had not In addition to this in 1856 3 128 370fc,al of imported beer were drunk and 730 3j9(,al of imported wine in fact their drinking capacity seemed to have been something wonderful - how they got through it he could not say (Laughter ) From these sources of revenue £911 430 was obtained now SOO 000 people only paid to the revenue £ is so for the same articles and though it might be regretted as a matter of revenue as a matter of social advancement and improvement it was a source of gratification that double the population only consumed half the quantity of liquor The former amount was supplemented by £575 000 from the gold duty It was quite clear therefore from the cousin es and criticisms of Sir John OShaunsB) that, however happy he might be on constitutional or general legislative questions he had better leave figures alone Sir John O Shanassy der recate 1 that our income was rapidly and and can ably in creasing from 1 000 000 to 1 000 000 but he was sure he forgot that the main part of that income was £600 000 from railwayS AVis that to be regretted '> And he did not hesitate to say that part of that income was from 1 ud obtained at his instance for he had always said they had no right to live on the public estate without any participation by posterity m what they realised from it and consequently £200 600a year was put by as a sinking fund for public works Did any one object to that? Was that not a desirable thing? Then Sir John O'Shanassy also remarked, The system of railways initiated by himself was paying 4 per cent interest, so they would pay for themselves without taxing the working man but that was another mistake for if £8,000 000 was borrowed at 6 per cent and the railways were only paying 4 per cent they must be a tax upon the ratepayers Mr. Francis having answered two or three questions, Mr. Henderson proposed, and Sir Arthur Nicolson seconded, a vote of confidence in him, which was carried unanimously. MR HARTLEY WILLIAMS AT ST KILDA Mr Hartley Williams met the electors of St Kilda at the St Kilda Town hall on Saturday evening There were between 500 and 600 persons present Councillor Johnson occupied the chair Mr Williams addressed the meeting as follows Gentlemen of the four candidates who are now soliciting your suffrages and who seek the great honour of being returned to Parliament as your represent it on one Mr Murray Smith has declared himself a bigoted freetrader I have declared myself a decided freetrader Mr Dixon has declared himself a decided protectionist what Mr Stephen has declared himself I am utterly unable to tell you for I think it would puzzle even the Sphinx to solve the enigmas that he has propounded to his constituency (Cheers ) Is he a freetrader' Is he a protectionist' Is he a mixture of both or neither the one nor the other and here before proceed ling to discuss those questions that at this present juncture most interest the par he mind let me make a few general observations . our re presentatives in the last Parliament and the representatives of West Melbourne were avowedly returned by a large majority of either constituency in the first place to Sum off and man in the constitution of this colony in its integrity both in the letter and spirit of the Constitution Act to guard against any violation either direct or in direct of that act and to maintain the balance of power as it then existed in both branches of the Legislature in the second place as the staunch and avowed advocates of free trade (Hear hear) How have those of them who are in office carried out those i recipes that they were returned by their respective constituencies to maintain and represent a In excuse they uigethatby a sort of silent consent on the I part of their constituents they were permitted to join themselves to Mr Francis under the belief that by such a coalition-an unholy coalition as it was then styled something might be done for free trade in the way of a revision of the present tariff, and when attacked for being defaulters also in this they contend in palliation that it would have been deemed an act of disloyalty on their part had they not stuck to their chief till the Parliament came to an end Assume now for the sake of argument that both of these excuses were and are valid and true That Parliament has now expired by effluxion of time and with it expired all those obligations of loyalty to the Chief Secretary that the gentlemen I have referred to have made so much of (Applause ) Was it not their duty returned to represent the opinions I have stated to have said to the Chief Secretary after the Parliament became de funct- Will you refrain from pressing on this scheme for the reform of the Upper House which that House will most assuredly reject and which scheme in that event must involve experiments at coercion and compulsion and will you bring in a measure that is urgently demanded by our constituencies and by the whole colony for the immediate revision of the tariff ' If this had been done and the Chief Secretary had refused to refrain from the prosecution of the one measure and had decided not to bring in the other then the reply should assuredly have been We must then return toourallcgianco to our constituents we have preserved our allegiance to you even longer than it was our obligation or our duty If this had been the position Mr Langton and Mr Wilberforce Stephen had then taken up I should not have been here tonight addressing you from this platform No one would have ventured to oppose them they would have gone in at the head of the poll and had before them a most glorious and honourable political career in the new Parliament (Great cheering ) Now before I leave this part of my address let me briefly draw your attention to some passages in a most violent speech of Mr Stephens made by him against the M'Culloch Government of which Mr Francis was then Treasurer on the second night of the debate on the property tax you will find that speech reported in the 12th volume of Ramazan Parliamentary debates assuredly a record most inconvenient for members of Parliament who have no fixed opinions In that speech Mr Stephen after accusing the M'Culloch Government of which Mr. Francis was the Treasurer, of keeping in office by bribery inside and bribery outside the House proceeded speaking of free trade and protection in these words - The Chief Secretary has adopted that tremble medium course which he has adhered to eierBince that of incidental protection In other words he neither declared himself an honest and decided protectionist from conviction nor did he continue to declare himself a free trader and at the conclusion of his speech makes use of this most emphatic pledge - I can only say in conclusion that I never will be a party to any coalition between the freetraders and the protectionists (Great cheering and laughter ) How has Mr Stephen kept that pledge volunteered by himself before and in the hearing of the representatives of the whole colony in the same way gentlemen as he has kept his pledges to you his constituents. There is consistency for you in a Parliamentary representative I admit you have two representative in name have you more than one in fact And now with reference to the two or three questions on which without doubt you have a right to hear my views And first with reference to the Ministerial scheme for the reform of the Upper House Mr Higinbotham when addressing the elector s of the East Bourke Boroughs boldly declared that his desire was to directly do away with the second Chamber altogether Greatly as I differ from that gentleman in many of his political opinions and from this opinion of his in particular I cannot help contrasting his outspokenness and boldness with the course taken by the present Government The present Government, gentlemen even date a scheme which simply means doing that indirectly which Mr. Higinbotham desires to do directly In other words the aim of the Government is to reduce the Upper House to a mere nonentity in the Legislature to allow them to have an existence in name but none in fact to take away from them all substantiality to leave that Chamber as the mere ghost of its former self It is needless for me to give you the details of that scheme Believe me when I say it means annihilation of all influence or power on the part of the second Chamber in the legislation of this country while leaving that Chamber the semblance of an existence Gentlemen do you believe that the Upper House will consent to commit suicide by accepting this scheme ' Most assuredly not and if not then according to Ministerial avowals such non acceptance will involve some measure we know not what of coercion or compulsion and permit me to warn you of this-that any measure of coercion or compulsion will most certainly beget evils the result of which we cannot foretell How are you to say whether yea or nay you approve of this scheme when the Government refuse to rev call to you the modus operandi by which it is to be forced through the Upper House ' Supposing it was to be by reverting to the task system would you approve of it then ' (Cries of No no \ Then gentlemen take care lest by returning a member pledged to support it you may endorse a scheme the most lateral portion of which has not been unfolded to you and without which I believe no man could form a just judgment on the issue submitted to the country Further you must bear this in mind that after many lengthy consultations with the members of his Cabinet Mr Francis in the Argus of the 10th March published The Ministerial programme In one of the concluding paragraph of that manifcstoyou will find a sentence which means this and nothing. else that until the scheme pro- pounded by the Ministry had been not only endorsed by the constituencies of the colony but also had been passed by both Houses no other matter of legislation however noces eau could be undertaken by either House and in another part of the same manifesto he states that the question of the ape royal of nona. proved of that scheme was the sole issue to submitted to the country in other words that the Ministry would stand or fall by the voice of the constituencies on that question alone Are you let me ask you prepared to sanction this scheme the attempt to pass which into law must involve the non passing into law for many months of other urgent and necessary matters of legislation And now with reference to the question of free trade and protection I am as I have already told you a decided freetrader (Cheers ) A decided freetrader though I am not one of the merchants who it is said by some are not unprejudiced judges on this question, because I cannot but observe and feel that these protective duties are a drag upon the growth and prosperity of this young and vigorous country because I believe I free trade means large trade and large trade means prosperity to the whole colony It is said that the working classes are in favour of these protective duties because under it they receive higher wages I will admit that for the sake of argument Let me tell them that those higher wages are higher wages merely nominally and not in reality because the increase that they receive with the one hand they pay out with the other (Great applause ) who uni order has to pay say a duty of 22 per cent upon the cost price of the article imported 1 has the freight He has to charge the retailer a ] profit on the cost price of the article plus the freight and plus the duty paid and the retailer has to charge the purchaser and consumer a profit on the total amount he has l up to the importer So the bill rolls on and by the time the article has come into the hands of the consumer he has had to pay a duty not of 22 per cent but of 35 per cent if not more Gentlemen it is evident the consumer is a sufferer under this system and it is equally evident that the retailer is also he can make the same legitimate rate of profit from the consumer if there were no duties and he would most assuredly have an infinitely larger market The importers it is well known are the loudest in their cries for the re my all of these protective duties (Great o) plause ) Again I do feel that these high wages which are as I have ended vowed to show merely nominal and do not in reality exist will within a very short time completely annihilate our ex] port trade For how can our manufacturers export goods manufactured by high priced labour and sell them in competition with the manufacturers of other colonies which have far more free i ports and where consequently all our is not so dear' I can tell you think gentlemen that the exporters of this colony are now being undersold by those of other colonies right and left and that New South Wales in particular will within a very short time absorb the whole of our intercolonial trade (Cheers) Therefore do you even those of you who are protectionists use your most earnest endeavours to procure at once absolute intercolonial free trade On the two questions on which I have addressed you I could speak for hours but in mercy to you my hearers I will curb the torrent of my words and refrain from further fresh passing on your time and patience In conclusion let me earnestly ask of you to return as your representatives to Parliament men who enunciate the opinions that they hold firmly boldly and clearly - whose opinions you can grasp If you do this as I am as sure you will you will have as your representatives men who are your representatives not only in name but in fact, who will nail their colours to the most and only lower them in obedience to a signal from the majority of the constituency they represent-who will not depart from pledges that they make to the whole body of the representatives of the people of this colony (Loud and continued applause ). The candidate in answer to questions said he was opposed to indiscriminate and promiscuous immigration but that he was in favour of assisted family immigration that he was opposed repayment of members and should vote against it that he was in favour of a scheme for the reform of the Upper House by sweeping away the qualification of the candidates altogether reducing the qualification of the electors and shortening the tenure of office to the duration of two P irha ments and that without making himself a local delegate he would if returned advocate the erection of a breakwater off the St Kilda pier as conducive to the safety not only of the small craft plying there but of the ocean and of pleasure boats and yachts Mr Kidston moved and Mr Mason seconded a motion That Mr Hartley Williams is a fit and proper person to represent the electorate of St Kilda in the corner g Parliament The motion was earned unanimously with great cheering There were between 500 and 600 persons present
