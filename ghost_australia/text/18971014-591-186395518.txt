NATHAUA SPRING. SHOW. A SUCCESSFUL EXHIBITION. MOST delightful weather favoured the committee of the Nathalia Agricultural Society on Thursday last, and the tcsidents of the district took advantage of the smiling day and turned out in large numbers to favour with their presence the annual/ell. The Show Ground looked most attractive under its mantle of green verdure, and a number of improvements which have been made since last year, added- considerably to its appearance. Chief among these was the sheep and pig pens, which have been recently burl'. The committee are to be complimented on these ; they area big step in advance of the rough unsightly pons that are mostly in evidence iu other societies* grounds. They are built of red-gum and have a gate attached with si simple fastening. Being newly built the ground was loose, and the sheep got somewhat dirty in them this yeir, but this of course will be remedied on future occasions -by a coating of grass. The only thing they require is a roof, and no doubt before long this progressive society trill see to that. The other arrangements on the ground are also very good, and the general organisation reflects credit on the worthy president, Mr. S. Ball, and the ever-popular and energetic secretary, Mr. A. E. Heighwav. The number of entries was very good, totalling about 1,500, and the gate receipts were about j£8f>, just about a pound more than last year. The attendance, however, was estimated be larger, the sale of members' tickets being considerably greater, some £150 bein raised from this source and donations combined. ' Taking everything into consideration the show was a sigual success. There was a magnificent display of all kinds of machinery. Bryau and Jones's windmills being a conspicuous feature they being awarded a special mention. The local makers showed up well, Air. R. W. Brown, of Yalca, taking first for the best collection- of vineyard implements, and for best laid pair of plough-shares, Mr. John Hansen, of Nathalia, coming second iu the latter class. Air. A. B. Binger, of Nathalia, had a splendid exhibit of beautifully finished buggies and deserves every credit for the taste and excellence of his workmanship. In saddlery, Mr. D. Caldwell, of Nathalia, was awarded all prizes offered, a sufficient testimony in itself. In live stock there was a splendid display. Notable amongst the horses was the Messrs. Graham Bros, draught stallion, which carried oil first and champion, and C. J. Morley's draught mare, which was awarded similar honors. As a whole, the horses were good, but there were some exhibits which should never have been brought into a show yard. In one instance a prize was awarded to a horse in a section, it is needless to mention, which was ring-boned, and which conse- quently should never have been exhibited, let alone being honoured with the blue ribbon. The high-jumping contest was watched with great interest, and the final contest, as at Cobram, lay between Mr. J. C. Rockliff'-e" Landmark," and Mr. J. Gnnn's " Moral." The-positions j were reversed last Thursday, " Landmark clearing oft 3in., well ridden by Patterson, whilst " Moral" knocked the stick the three times. J. Evans, whose judgment and skill over jumps is so well known as to need no comment, showed that although " Moral " had lost the prize, he was nor beaten, subsequently taking him over Mt 6 in so clearly and gracefully, as to elicit ringing applause from the crowd, whilst " Landmark " struck it three times. However, the prize had been won, and Evans had to console himself wiui ihe hopes of better lack next time. " Landmark" also took first prize huntci over 1clearing his jumps very nicely. Miss Oorry's riding over the jumps was one of the sights of the day. Easv and graceful in the saddle, her riding received uuniistakeable marks of applause from the spectators. ' Some very pretty ponies were exhibited, the first prize falling to Mr. J. McCarron, Mr. John ilendy coming second. Mr. J. P. Bed well's tanners' turnout was a perfect one. Amongst the cattle there were some splendid beasts, but a number of mediocre cattle which had not the ghost of a chance of being awarded a prize, and were not more than quarter-bred. One practice we noticed m this class which we consider should disqualify an exhibitor. This is the trick of clipping in order to give the animals a finer appearance. Animals should be shown naturally, there is, of course, no objection to grooming tlicm, but clipping is palpably an attempt to mislead as to the quality and quantity of hair, iu Channel Island cattle, Mr. John Payne's Jersey Buli, 1 1 Haveloek," and his heifer, " Cleopatra II," were models, " Haveloek " is a silver grey bull, a "son of " Beaconsfield" by " Neat Boy" (imp), out of " Buttercup" (imp), whilst Cleopatra II" conies from the same blood on the sire's side, her dam being Cleopatra," whose sire was " What's Wanted" (imp). They are both perfect specimens of the breed, and were purchased by Mr. Payne some' few months ago, for a good round snm from Mr. Macgregor, the wellkuowu breeder ofWoodstock," near Melbourne. Mr. W. H. Tyack's Shorthorn bull had also his crowd of admirers: He is a magnificent looking, Animal and was worthy the first prize and Mr. George Power's Champion Cup, value £!» 5s, which were awarded to him. Mr. Tweddle's hull obtained second prize. He showed somewhat too ranch daylight underneath, and his hair was too fine for the breed, but he was a fine animal nevertheless. His yearling bull, iu the same class is a very promising animal. Herefordswore very strongly represented, both in, quality and quantity, uud Messrs W. M'Phan and J. Garland nearly "scooped the pool'' with their exhibits. In the miscellaneous class, Mr J. Payne took the .special Silver Medal awarded by His Excellency, Lord Brassey. for the best dairy cow, whilst Mr W. Groves, butcher, Nathalia, scored well in the fat cattle. Swine were poorly represented as to quantity, but were excellent in quality. Mr T. McCarthy took first for sow with litter, and a fine exhibit it was. The championship for boar fell to the lot of Mr G. Lwnbtick, and Messrs Magnusson and P. Sullivan had also some good samples of the porcine breed in the pens. Never perhaps before has there been such an excellent, display of sheep in the Show. There were numerous exhibits, and they were lor the most part excellent. It is a somewhat peculiar thing that the Numurkah society excised Merinoes from their prize list, no exhibits being forthcoming, whilst here they were very strong, Roberts Bros., of Rush! worth, having some veiy fine animals on view, with which they obtained three firsts, out of four awarded, and the champion for both ewe and ram. Mr Jas. Martin, Yiellima, scoring first iu the other section, and getting two scconds as well. A magnificent Lincoln 4-tooth ram, exhibited by Mr Lilford, of Tonsrala, succeeded in putting down one of Mr Mortimer's well-known rams. However, the tables were turned in the i-to»th section, Mr Mortimer taking first and Sir Lilford second : the latter was awarded championship. In Linc »lns the quality was especially good. The fat sheep were not up to the usual mark for Nathalia. The following is the list of prize-winners :— Class A—DRAUGHT HORSE STOCK Imported or Colonial Stallion : R. W Pullin, 1 ; A. Colvin, 2nd.
