?:??: . UNDER THE VERANDAH. ' ? . ? «v* ? ' ? ' , ?. '? When Hamlot and the Ghost have 'left.; the scene to ,, discuss their awful sockets, Horatio aud Marcellus take possession , of the stage, and the audience, who erstwhile were listening to the accents of Bandmann or Montgomery, are compelled to endure Skakspearo R3 interpreted ' by Messrs. Belvillo find Mor daunt. What in the kdim region behind th© ' curtain ': are termed carpenters' scenes are not unebninion in real life. The newspaper' thrust in your hand by an obsequious clerk while you are await ing that awful ? interview ' with ? the ; bank manager, which is to precipitate or avert . . your ruin, the half fraternal flirtation1 with the younger sister of your, beloved, while . you are awaiting the conversation with that young lady upon which you, at that, time believe that your, future happiness de '????; pen'cls, the' painfully polite interchange of wordi with the returning officer while his deputy is preparing the final state of tho ?poll, all resemble1 those carpenters'' scenes' which ; upon the stage ? allow the1 ' principals . to get breathing time, or- to change 'their, dresses, and which for a1 short timo give an inferior artist an opportunity of doing; his. little possible. All this circumlocution is jn; myopinionneceasary toannouncetho factthat ^Egles has gone ,tq. spend ?.: his ~: .holidays' in some ? locality which is :much cooler, than Melbourne' is '.{& the present moment, and, that he has asked ine to, fill his place until' he returns.

They were petted and made much of, encpnraged to hang about cafes and billiard-room3 and allowed to neglect their training.

Pro fessional pedestrians are not the most scru pulous ' people in the world. Au rest'e I trust that' the speculators who have brought' ' these worthies to our shored,' and especially Mr. Coppin, will not forget' the old story . about the goose and , the golden eggs. sA charge of 2s. 6d. f or admission to & public, /reserve to see, some very inferior :running-and walking matches was piling, up ^the agony a ' little toostrpng. _, ' .. lV: ., .? ,.;;:;i ,/.,.-.; ' ?-, A medical man .named; Radford- residing at Oasterton, has been committed for, trial , for the alleged .manslaughter of a female pa tient. The evidence went to show, that ,the ' doctor was intoxicated during the accouche ment of the unfortunate woman, and the local papers are indignant that the people V* of the district have ao long ' tolerated i a notorious'drunkard. The journal in question does not do full justice to Mr. Radford's por-! . tiriacity. Some years ago he settled at Cas ? terton, and he took, good care, not to permit his domain to be poached over. By-soine adroit management he got;himself appointed coroner, and the game, was then in his ,pwn ; hands. If any person died under, the, care bf a rival Esculapius, Radfpr(l.heldc an i inquiry. No matter how clear the cause of. death, or , how long the man had been ill, there was an inquest, and very generally an adjourn ment or an exhumation. JVom a return once laid before Parliament;' out of 27 deaths in the district, there had been 23 'inquests! the* ' four being patients of the Mr. Radford. The result was that persons who 'did not desire* ? an inquest on the remains ? of i Stheif friends i always took care to call-in the coroner,; who, by this ingenious expedient , effectually drove away all opposition. .However, the .device wa3. eventually, exppseid,| and Mr.; .Radford. : has. at last coma to grief;,: ?:.;,,; r m .,.,'.;;. j .
