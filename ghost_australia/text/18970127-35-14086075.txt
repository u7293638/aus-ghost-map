LA VIE PARISIENNE, National Observer.) Paris is donating the question whether the glory of the Boulevard is departing, whether bear in the City of Light in losing what in the past were its most essential charms That the point should be mooted is in itself a bad sign When all is in order there are no searchings of heart, and the more existence of misgivings is a symptom that something in M Long The immediate cause of the rating of the discussion in the revival at the Vanotea, that most Parisian of Parisian theatres, of Offenbach a operetta, " La Vie Parisienne " Coming at the opening of the season, this reappearance on the stage of a piece in which the Paris life if a generation back 18 port travel with surpassing fidelity his fitly provoked a comparison of the past with the present As we have hinted, there is little but lamentation at the changes wrought by the lapse of time or a surety the Pans of "La Vie Parisienne " was a wondrous pleasant place and to choose the period for comparison with any other is, in sporting parlance to try the latter very highly In 1866, the year from which the operetta dates, things went very well in the French capital ii The Second Empire is as it its zenith the Mexican expedition ma fair way to be forgotten, the chance of police heard appeasement seemingly considerable in view of the conciliatory attitude of the Emperor, the exhibition in prospect, and no apprehension of the storm that was to gather so shortly Amid these favouring circumstances Paris flourished, and perhaps surpassed herself Certain it is that the libretto of "Ucilhnc und Halevy shows us a society characterised by the quintessence of all the qualities conveyed by the epithet Parisian. Lightheartedness, frivolity the prettiest wit, and the utmost amenity of manners distinguish the personages of the play, and were doubtless to be found in their prototypes To day it is lamented that "La Vic Parisienne " has ceased to be a mirror of Parisian life in the space of a genera- tion the capital, it is declared, has undergone a complete metamorphosis, and the moaning there ever is the more mournful since the nature of the change is to direct the mind of man can conceive Paris has become an Parisian London in ruins and ready for Macaulay's New Zealander would be an exhilarating spectacle in comparison. Without being able to share in all its intensity the woe of our afflicted neighbours, we can at least appreciate the grounds of their grief The change in progress in Paris has long been clear to others besides Parisians An inkling of what is afoot may have come to the mere reader of French, novels or frequenter of Trench theatres The French newspaper, too, is sufficient in itself to betray the open secret to make evident the horrible truth that the Gaul is losing his gaiety. The type of journal that was the joy of the Boulevard in the past has barely the ghost of a survivor, and the best of the papers by which it has been superseded are almost as dull, while remaining incomparably worse informed than the dullest of the London dailies Villemoasaut would not recognise his eye! o, and, anathematising its three sheets, would certainly refuse to read it and probably be ashamed to edit it The fate of the novel has been similar, but perhaps a little worse To turn to a French novel for relaxation was once as natural an act as to sip a champagne cup in summer Non days the one possible classifica- tion of French writers of notion is into various orders of the bore the bore psychological, the bore realistic, the bore transcendental, and so on to the end of the saddening list "Y ere the lady author rampant in France or some Kailyard school in honour there the state of things could scarcely be worse than it is The cause of the theatre is somewhat different The Parisian has. learned to do without novelists publishers declare he is ceasing to buy them but the theatre is still a necessity of his, existence As yet he has struggled manfully against all attempts to bore, him as he sits in his stall Ibsomtes have sought to make him their prey, and attempts have been made to educate him up to Belgian Shakespeare, and other weird geniuses but it with a like want of success He has stood out for the tickling of his fancy, and even asserted his right to laugh His purveyors of dramas wiser than his novelists, continue to humour this obstinacy but there is a significant difference between the fare they offered him and that of which La Vie Parisienne ' is to sample Speaking generally there are two classes, of plays, in the way of light drama, that at present attract full houses in Paris , there are the plays or which the humour is of the broadest, and plays of TV which the humour is of the bitterest. The changed temper of the Parisian may be traced in connection with both Park has always tolerated, not to say loved, a large measure of license on the stage Our neighbours, however, used to boast that their playwrights presented their riskiest matter so cunningly as to allow of, their daring being condoned at any rate by 4 native audience Even this semi-roticence, is not an abandoned tradition In protest against the alteration in the public taste a well known critic recently published in the Jenzen 0 a scathing leader mg article which be entitled "La Lit au Theatre The tenor of the article will be understood from its title That a elistmgmshed man of letters should have deemed it necessary to write it is a sufficient indication of the lengths to which authors and stage-manager consider it permissible to go and of the increasing grossness of the public taste The wit too, when real, which presses the Parisian to-day is of a- different flat our from that in it rich he used to find satisfaction The old mocking spirit which was often kindly and seldom virulent has given place to a spirit of bitterness, of soured discontent, of almost rancorous criticism. How great is the change in tone may be gauged in a moment by comparing the genial humour of "La Vie Parisienne " with the " essence " of any of his better it works of the younger contemporary writers with" Les Fleurs " of Henri Lavedan, for example Look where you will, the evidence points in the same direction the Parisian is altering beyond recognition He may not have been Eobered, but he has certainly been soured His thirst for pleasure is as keen as ever, but unless he look to it he will fall under the reproach before long of taking his pleasures sadly His lightheartedness is beating him, and some uglier name will soon have to be found for his frivolity. His life, too, is less leisurely as well as less gracious. He is more engrossed than he used to be by the struggle for existence , he is beginning to believe in the sad rag at which he was wont to see, that time is money And the result of his altered disposition is that a tie I'm insane is becoming a memory while all that remains in its stead is that very different thing lane de Fans.
