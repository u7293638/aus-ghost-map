.The Automobile. It doesn't shy at papers As they blow along tbe street. It cuts no silly capers On the dashboard with its feet ; It dotsri'tpaw the tod up all around the hitching post, It doesn'c scare at shadows as a man would at a ghost ; It doesn't gnaw the manger, It doBBn't w&ste; the bay, Nor put you into danger When the braBS bauds play.J It makes- no wild endeavor To switoh away the flies; It sheds no hair that ever Gets io your mouth and eyes ; It speeds along the highway and never looks around For things that it may scare at and spill you on the ground 1 It doesn't mind tbe circus, It's not at all afraid ; And it doesn't overwork us When the elephants parade. It doesn't rear and quiver When the train goes rushing by ; It doesn't stand and shiver When the little anowflakes fly ; It doesn't mind the thunder nor the lightning's blinding flash ; It doesn't kepp you chirping and con necting with the lash ; It never minds the banners They display on holidays. It's a thing with proper manners, Which it shows in many ways. When you chance to pass its stable You do not have to care Or cluck for all you're able To keep from stopping there ? It will work all through the daytime and dtill be fresh at night ; There is no one to arrest you if you do not treat it right ! Ii's whei zings ne'er distress you As it moves along the way â€” Farewell, old Dobbins; bless you ! You were alright in your day.
