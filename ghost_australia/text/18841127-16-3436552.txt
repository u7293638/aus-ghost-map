Mr. W Ion est took exception to some remarks made by Mr. Mein on the previous evening, asking the (Chamber not to go against the will of a large majority of the Assembly, especially in a matter in which, many member a of the Council had a personal interest Mr Pou best said only a very small minority of members had an interest in the Act of 1889 and if they had he was sure they would not let that weigh with them in a matter affecting the public interest He himself had not the slightest personal in terest in the Act of 1869 CK the resumption of the debate in the Council on the preemption question, Mr Gregory moved an amendment striking out nearly the whole of the 6th clause of the bill, and making it provide simply that pic emption shall not be allowed under thoC'th section of the Act of 1866 in the case of leases granted after the passing of the bill Mr Mein said there was some reason in the suggestion made by the Observer, that the clause be so altered as to allow pie emption only in respect of permanent improvements, but there was no reason whatever in the proposal of Mr Gregory Mr W roucat said that Mr. T B Stephens, when the Act of 1869 sins before the House, clearly stated that pre- emption was not to be subject to any restrictions as to permanent improve meats, and Bill Taylor cor liberated this statement Mr Mein said that if this was the case the words in the section for the purpose of seem nig permanent improvements' would have no meaning whatever The whole question was then reopened, and fully discussed from all points of new There was a huge attendance of members, all of whom evidently gave close attention to the debate, which at times waxed quite warm One or two passages at arms took place between Messrs Ilcnsslei, Taylor, and Walsh, the latter of whom maintained that Mr Heussler, as a foreigner, was " nationally speaking out of order in direct ing to the Chamber as to the course it ought to adopt Ultimately Mr Gregory a amendment was in bed, on division, by 18 to 7 those voting for the amendment were - Messrs. Gregory, Murray Prior, Wilson, M Dougall, Graham L, B Forrest, Thynne, Taylor, Mac Pherson, W Poltest, Saijth, Power, Turner, Aplin, Lambert, Box, Hill, and Dr O Doherty , while those voting against it were -Messrs Mein, Walsh, King, Heussler, Swan, Pettigrew, and Foote Atrni the adoption of Mr Gregory a un portant amendment Mr Walsh wanted the Postmaster General "reconsider his position " So far is the Government were concerned, the bill was according to the hon mcmbei.utteily destroyed The decision am ed at he con sUcicd the most decided vote of want of confidence in the land policy of the Government that had ever been passed, and there was now not the ' ghost of a chance of the bill being carried ' Mr Mein, howes ei, did not satisfy the hon. member by making any explanation Etc hiding the land board, several members of the Council expressed the opinion that the said of £1000 a year for each of the two members was too small, and Mr Mein expressed some sympathy with those who held that opinion, although he had no fear that the Government would not be able to get honest, campaign in, and capable men at the remained i tion offer ed Mr Taylor thought £1000 a year was quite enough, while Mr G Minor and one or two other members thought the rate or the travelling expenses to be allowed to the board ought to be defined Mr Thynne moved an addition to clause 12 providing that the members of the board shall not hold any share or interest in a partnership or company interested in a holding under the Act, but it being pointed out that this would prevent their holding a share in a bank, the amendment was withdrawn Mr Gregory intimated that in clause 20 hosioull whose an amendment pro sitting for an app ii from the board to arbitration The peculiar conduct of the hon Mr Walsh led to a premature adjournment of the Council During the gi case a part of the afternoon the hon member was content to be on one of the bend is, apparently dozing, and business proceeded Satis factory Tow aub evening, however and after the usual adjournment for dun or, Mr Walsh made innumerable speeches of a rambling nature having no reference the provisions of the Land Bill At length M) Mein told him that if he did not desist the measure would not pass was that the next ten years, and appealed to the hon. member to let the business proceed Mr Walsh, how can, continued his tactics, and shortly after wards called for a division on a formal amendment moved by Mr. Gregory, After the division bell had been rung, the hon. member found himself sitting alone and while the House was in division he said- "Here is a spectacle of the Government voting against their own measure , where upon Mr Graham remail od-' I Army of w 01 so spectacle than that After the dis vision Mr Walsh maintained that the House had a light to demand some explanation of why the Government voted against them can bill, and insisted upon this point for some time When he sat down, Mr Mein said the hon. member had cs recently made up his mind that the House should not proceed with business, in spite of the evident desire of all other members to do so, and moved the Chairman out of the chair the House adjourning at 9 o'clock after having passed only seven clauses of the Land Bill The, Council will probably resume the consideration in committee of the Land Bill at to days sitting The evidence taken during the menin into the Darra railway accident was laid on the table of the House j ester day 1 no pal col st as very bulky, the residence occupying 963 pass more or less In reply to Sir Thomas M'Ilwraith, the Premier promised that all possible haste should be made in him the evidence put into type so as to June it really for the discussion on the Balls ay Estimates In reply to Mr Annear it was stated by the Minister for Works that doubts had existed as to the formality of the lowest tender for the Brisbane Valley Railway extension in consequence of the total amount not being in sorted on the form of tender but as it was for a schedule contract, and the schedule in properly prepared, the tender was, after consideration declared found in accordance with the condition of tendering Till vexed question of the coast terminus of the Herberton Railway was again dealt with by Mr Miles last night in reply to a question put by Mr Li and, the Minister stated that Cairns is to be the terminus and that tenders will be called for the construction of the railway as soon as the plans aioappiosed by Parliament, the permanent houses completed, and the working plans sufficiently forward On the motion of Mr Annual Returns were ordered showing -1 Total expenditure in chas ed in surveying the railway line from Maryborough to Gympie, and length of line so surveyed 2 Names of surveyors employed and amount paid to each "surveyor , time each surveyor was employed and work done, distinguishing between town and permanent surveys A religion from J Sanderson Lyster re selecting a real areas and leases he had sustained in connection with certain selections on the D initiée River was presented to the Assembly by Mr John Stevenson the petition was lead and received BEroi F the Estimates s case proceeded with Sir Thomas M'Ilwraith 1110s ed the adjournment of the House for the purpose of calling attention to the recent proclamation of a protectorate in New Guinea After referring to the previous debate on the subject, he read fi 0111 the Com and of the 15th instant the full text of the proclamations of Mr Romilly and of Commodore Erskine, each of whom acted on the same instructions from Lord Derby but who declared the protectorate to extend over very different areas He said the proclamation of Mr Romilly would satisfy the people of Australia and was identical with the wishes of the Sydney Convention Cominoeloiel Erskine's was not so, he followed the lines laid down in the answer given by Mr. Gladstone to Sir William M Arthur some months ago The pi electorate, as proclaimed by that officer, is as to extend along the southern coast, by a line from lil" longitude, going constantly cast A line could enclose nothing, and any protectorate so proclaimed was an absurdity He wished however, to point out the manner in which Commodore Erskine had ignored the real reason put forward by the colonies for the annexation of New Guinea It was not, as he had stated in Hi proclamation, for the protection of natives, ' but entirely for the protection of these colonies New Guinea was situated 1 split in the main track from Queensland to Europe It was horrible to contemplate the cannibalism which might take place if one of our vessels should be we wrecked on one of these islands it was necessary, therefore, to tender this main road a safe road But any portion of the island which might be taken possession of by a foreign Power would be a serious source of danger to these colonies It is as solely on the consideration that the whole of New Guinea not belonging to the Dutch was to be annexed that the Premier induced Parliament to pass a bill granting money for the expenses of the piece too late If Australia were an independent nation the first step she would take would be to assume sole authority over New Britain, New Ireland and New Guinea, and he did not believe any foreign Power would object He asked, "Why cannot we get possession of these because of the timidity of the British Government, who fear to be embroiled with other nations As a result of the vacilla- tion of Lord Derby, contracts had been let to two German firms for the estab- lishment of German coaling stations on part of the very land annexed by Mr Chester -namely, on New Ireland The establishT 1 of a coaling, station was an evidence of the intention of Germany to acquire land in the neighbourhood of Australia This, however could yet be prevented if England would take prompt measures He then addressed himself to the claims of the Dutch, and quoted from a paper read before the Royal Geographical Society to show that these claims were becoming gradually smaller as time advanced therefore they should not be seriously con- succeed How ished Australians to understand how little had been done that no actual annexation of territory had taken place, and that the protectorate as proclaimed by Commodore Erskine was a mere sham Mil GRUFirit at once folios ed Sir Thomas M'Ilwraith and said that he could not appro bend the object of the debate They knew as much to day as they did on the last debate on cept that what was then conjectured had now taken place Whether the steps taken were the lustrous lenient to the Bi irish Gos ernment they did not now know but we should know more on the arrival of Major General Scratchley He had no doubt that any wish of the advising Council of Ministers would receive consideration at the hands of the British Government As to the claims of the Dutch, he did not think it was now necessary to discuss the matter. The debate was car turned from the Opposition benches by Mr Archer, Mr Palmer and Mr Ferguson The last named protested against the apathy displaced by honourable member-" Tins brought up M Dickson who protested against the inference that silence on his part indicated a want of interest in the subject He took a great deal of interest in the matter, but he thought they were displaying good judgment by waiting for further information as to the intentions of the Imperial Government In common deeds c they might wait until the commissioner race, He had his own opinion as to what had been done, but he trusted that it was an end as most of what was to follow Any talk about annexing New Britain and New Ireland Ireland he regarded as so much ' high falutin At the same time he expressed a hope that some day they would be peopled by sons and daughters of the Anglo-Saxon race,
