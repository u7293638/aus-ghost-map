THE POPE'S APOSTOLIC LETTER. ROME, September 30. The following is the text of the apostolic letter addressed by the Pope to all Protestant and non-Catholic bodies: — " Pius, Sovereign Pontiff, Ninth of the Name, to all Protestants and other non-Catholics. " You must already all know that we, who, I despite our unworthinesß, bare been raised to the throne of Peter, and therefore have been advanced to the supreme government of the whole Catholic Church and to its administra tion, which has been entrusted to us in Divine fashion by Christ Himself, our Lord,—we have judged it fitting to summon before us all our venerable brethren, the Bishops of all the world, and to convene them in an (Ecumenical council, which is to be celebrated next year in such a manner that, with those same venerable brethren who have been summoned to take part in this the subject of our solicitude, we may be able to adopt all the moßt opportune and necessary resolutions to dissipate the shadows of so large a number of pesti lential errors which daily are extending their power and license to the great prejudice of souls, and daily more and more to establish and strengthen among the Christian peoples com mitted to our watchful care the reign of the true faith, of justice, and of the true peace of God. Belying, then, with a firm confidence upon the close and affectionate bond of union which unites those our same venerable brothers to our person and to the apostolic see, and who have never ceased at any period of our pontifi cate to give to us and to the apostolic see the most striking evidences of faith, of lovo, and of respect, we truly hope that, as it has been in times past with other general councils, so it may be in the present, and that this oecumenical council convoked by as may bring forth, with the help of the Divine grace, the most rich and most fertile fruits, to the great glory of God and the eternal welfare of man. " Therefore, in that hope, and instigated and encouraged by the charity of our Lord Jesus Christ, who laid down His life for the salvation of the world, we cannot forbear on the occasion of the meeting of the next council, addressing our apostolic and paternal word to all those who, while recognising that same Jesus Christ as our Saviour, and rejoicing in the name of Christians, j yet still do not profess the veritable faith of Christ, or follow the communion of the Catholic Church. And if we do so, it is, before all, to warn, exhort, and supplicate them with all | our zeal and all our charity to consider and seri ously examine if they in truth follow the path prescribed by our Lord Jesus Christ, and which leads to eternal happiness. In fact, no one can deny or doubt that Jesus Christ Himself, in order that all future human generations should enjoy the fruit of His redemption built up here below His Church in the person of Peter, that is to say, the Church, one, holy, catholic and apostolic—and that He granted to him all the necessary power, in order that the faith should be preserved intact and entire, and that the same faith should be trans mitted to all peoples, to all races, and to all nations in such a manner that all men should be able to be united in His mystical body in baptism, and always to preserve in themselves until the entire development that new life of grace without which no one can ever merit or obtain life eternal, so that the same Church which constitutes the mystical body shall re main, until the end of time, firm and inde structible in its own constitution, developed in vigor, and furnishing to its children all that is necessary for life eternal. " Now, whoever wishes well to consider and examine with attention the different religious sooietiea divided among themselves, and sepa rated from the Catholic Church, which, Bince the time of the Lord Jesus Christ and His apostles, has always uninterruptedly exercised, and still exercises, by means of its legitimate pastors, the power entrusted to her by our Lord Himself—whoever, we say, shall thus examine, will easily convince himself that not one of those religious societies, nor all the reli gious societies together, constitutes, or in any way can be considered as the one and only Caf.ho- lio Church which our Lord Jesus Christ founded, constituted, and desired—should see, that they cannot in any way be regarded as a member or as a part of that same Church, because they are visibly separated from all Catholic unity. As, in fact, those societies are deprived of that living authority established by God, who pointed out to mankind, before all things, the matter of faith and the rule of morality, who directed and ' presided over them iv all things affecting their eternal welfare, therefore those societies them selveß constantly varied in their doctrine, and thus this instability is unceasing. " Every one can easily comprehend that this state of things is altogether opposed to the Church established by Christ our Lord—a Church in which the truth must always rest unaltered, without being the subject of any change, as a charge entrusted to that same Church in order that she may preserve it in all its integrity, a charge for the care of which the presence of the Holy Ghost and its aid has been granted for ever to this Churoh. " No one can ignore the fact that these differ ences of doctrine and opinion give rise to the social schisms, and that therefrom spring those innumerable sects and communions which are daily increasing to the detriment of Christian and civil society. " Whoever, in fact, recognises religion as the foundation of human society cannot refuse to ad mit and avow the influence exercised over civilised society by those divisions and disagreements of principles of that nature, and of religious socie ties struggling one with the other ; and also with what power the denial of authority estab lished by God to regulate the convictions of the human intelligence, and to direct the actions > of men both in their social and private life, has excited, has developed, and has fomented those moat unfortunate troubles, those events, and those disturbances which agitate and affect almost all nations in a most deplorable manner. " Therefore, in order that all thoße who are not instilled with the principles of the unity and truth of the Catholic Church should seize the occasion offered to them by this Council, in which the Catholic Church, to which their ancestors belonged, shows a proof of its com plete unity, of its vigor, and of its unextinguish able vitality ; that they should obey the neces sities of their hearts; that they should strive to bear themselves away from that state in which they cannot be assured of their salvation; "That they Bhonld address without ceasing the most fervent prayers to God that he should dissipate the cloud of error, and that he should bring them back into the bosom of the Church, our holy mother, where their ancestors received the salutary nourishment of life, and alone pre serves in its integrity the doctrine of Jesus Christ, handing it down and dispensing the mysteries of celestial grace; " We, therefore, who ought most zealously to fulfil all the duties of a good pastor, in accord ance with the charge of our apostolic ministry, entrusted to us by Christ our Lord Himself, and who ought to embrace all men in the world in our paternal charity, we address this letter to all Christians separated from us—a letter in which we exhort and supplicate them to hasten to return to the fold of Christ. "It is because we heartily desire their salva tion in Jesus Christ, and fear one day to have to render an account of their soul to that same Jesus Christ, our Judge, if we do not point out to them and open to them as much as is in us the way which they must follow if they would gain their salvation. Also, in all our prayers and supplications, and while performing acts of grace, we never cease humbly to ask for them, both by night and day, the celestial light and the abundance of grace from the eternal Pastor of souls. And, whereas, despite our unworthiness, we fulfil upon earth the functions of the vicar of Christ, we await with open arms the return of those wandering sons * to the Catholic Church, in order that we may be able to receive them with all affection into the dwelling of the celestial Father, and make them participators in TTi« everlasting treasures. "It is that much-wished for return to the truth and communion of the Catholic Church upon which depends not only the salvation of each one in particular, bat of the whole Christian society; and the world will never enjoy true peace until it forma one flock under one pastor. " Given at Borne, at St. Peter's, September 13, 1868, in the twenty-third year of oar pontificate."
