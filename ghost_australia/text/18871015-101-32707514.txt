CHAPTER XXXII. . 'TSE <5HÎM> GHOST IN THE HOVSE. Ä^TBB tlie 'Cöroner, Quayle the Gyke, had gone through part of his dual func- tions at Ballamona, and thereby had dis- covered that'the hodyof Ewan had been wrapped in a sail cloth of the Ben-my Chree, he Bet out on tlie other part of his duty, to find tho berth of the fishing boat, laud, if need be,i io arrest the crew. He i was in tho act of leaving Ballamona when, ¡at the gate of the high road,' he came upon the wemen and children of the crew he was in search of. and there, at the moment when the Bishop arrived for the funeral, he heard that the men had been at sea since, the middle of the previous day. Confirmed in his suspicions, but conceal- ing them, he returned to the village with tlie terrified women, and -on the way he made his own sinister efforts to comfort . them when they ¡mourned as if their hus ibahds .had been lost. 'Aw, no, no, no, never fear ; we'll ; ieee them again soon -enough, I'll go bail,' he said, and in their guileless blindness ?? -the women were no ¡thing lóth to take cheer fromi the fellow's dubiouB smile, i His-Confidsuce was not misplaced, for hardly had he got back to the village,1 . and: stepped into .the liouses one after one, making his own covert investigations whilelhe sandwiched ide: shrewed questions with solace, when the. fish er mon them selveB,nld Quilleash, Crennell, Teare, and Corfcell, and the dad Davy .

One after an- other slunk out ' of his house until they were all fire on the street ia a group holding their heads together and .mutter ing. Aud when at length the Coronel came dut "of old Quilloash's ' house ano lean against the tram m on at the porch and looked towards them in the darkneBf hut said not a word, their self- possessioi left them on tho'instant, and Straightway they took to their heels.. ' Let's away at a slant over the hóa¡3 and give warning lo MasthaDán,' the; whispered, and this was the excuse they made to themselves for their flight, just to preserve a little ray of self-respect. But the Coronor understood them, and he set his face back towards the church Jard, knowing that the Deèmstèt would e thers by that time. ' The Bishop had gone through the cere- mony at the gravé side with 'composure, though his voice when he spoke was full of tears; aud the shrivelled nair of his un- covered head seemed to have passed from iron grey to white. His grand, calm face was steadfast, and his prayer was of faith and hope. Only beneath this white quiet, aa of a glacier, the red dot of a great sorrow was rife within him., It was then for the first timé In ifs fúllhes that-^ub disturbed in the solemn hour by coarser fears-he realised the depth of his grief for the loss of Ewan. That Saintly soul came back to his memory in its beauty and its tenderness alone, and its heat and uneontrolablo unreason was forgotten. When he touched on the mystery of Ewan's death his large, wee face quivered, slightly and he paused, but when he spoke of "thé hope of and everlasting re- union, and how all thal was dark would: be made plain and the Judge of all the earth would do right, his voice grew bold ¡aa with a surity of a brave resignation. ! The Deemster listened to the short night serries with alternate [restlessness -rftramping to and fro by the side, of the grave-rand cold self-possession, and with a constant hardness and bitterness of mind» breaking out .sometimes into alight trill of laughter, or again into a hoarse gurgle» as if in scorn of < the Bishop's belief or in contempt of misplaced con- fidence. But; the crowds that were gathered around held their breath in awe of the mystery, and when .they sang it was with such 'an expression of emotion end fear that no man knew the sound of his own voice. More than once the Deemster. stopped in his uneasy perambulations, and cried ' What's that ?' as if arrested by «ounds that did not break on the ears of others, but nothing occurred to disturb the carer mony until it bad reached the .point of its close,' and while the Bishop was pronoun-. cing a benediction the company was thrown into a great tumult. It was then that the Coroner arrived, panting from a long run. He pushed hie way through the crowd, and Caret in al the grave, side between the: .Bishop and the Deemster. ..;,< : ' They've come ashore,' he said .eagerly ¡ 'tho boit'B in : harbour and > the <meu arc :here.' .>>.: ? ¡ . < ? .,i ¡; , >?,.-...; ; n.. :. ¡ Twenty voices at once cried *?. iVyho F but the Deemster asked ; no explanation.

But hardly had the Coroner' gone br the people re 1 'covered from their/bewilderment when the Bishop lifted onei hand, tO 'hespeak ' silence, and then said, tu a toúeimpossible to describe, ' Can any man say of bis own knowledge that my sbn was 'on 1$ie Ben nia-Ohree last night?' '"' ' The Beemater snorted Contemptuously, but none made answer to'the Bishop's question. ' ? At that moneht there came the sound of a horse's hoofs on the road, and im- mediately the old Archdeacon drew up. He bad been preaching" the Christmas sermon at Feeltown that' day,/add there* he had heard of the death of, his grand,-., son, abd of the suspicions' ^hat'were,.in) the air concerning it. The sbur Spirit of the disappointed man had' never jgone onp with too much warmth to the Bishop, oh), had always been ready'enouglr to east contempt' on the ' moonstruck ways,', of the man who had '-usurped'''bia own place of preferment; and ntyw'-without contrition or pity he was ready to j strike j his blow at!théstricken'man.; I .
