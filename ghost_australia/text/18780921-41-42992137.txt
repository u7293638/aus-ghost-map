The LABGO Bay, which is the first vessel with Immigrants from a Scotch port, reached tha anchorage on Friday morning, and came to in* a good position to await 'being boarded- by the Health Officer and Immigration Agent The Largo Bay is a very tine barque,* tailt under the Immediate supervision of the master by Messrs. John Kay and Sons. She is of Iron, with all late improvements ln|working g.±ar and appliances. She has a saloon devoted to par senger accommodation, tha half-poop simply covering quarters for the officers and master. They are very prettily fitted . and adorned, but part being cut off to afford a companion way for the single girls rather contracts the space. The 'tween decks are taken up by the immigrants, for whose accommodation a large house built on deck is rather an encumbrance. - It Is always a matter of trouble to keep a. vessel clean when so many people are on board, and in the case of this barque there is no exception to the role, bat doubtless thu will be rectified in a few days. The passage out has been very well made considering the vessel is laden with very heavy material and loaded very low. and this has indneeaherto roll over much. She has proved a very lair sailer and a good sea boat, never having shipped any heavy water throughout Tha m&sUr; reports leaving uie Tail of the Bask on June 21, and Temarkably fine weather marked the progress down to the latitude of the Channel ; but it was the 26th bufora final departure was taken from the Irish coatt. The Northern Hemisphere was cleared witli »out north-east trades in any apDreciable degree, the \- customary region of thai wind being marked by ctlois asd light variables, so interspersed that it was the SSth July before the vessel crossed the Eijuator in long. 23*. Most of the recent arrivals have reported anav.narent diminution of trade winda in any force, and -it's Largo Bay was similarly situated, for she headei away till the 14 th before sighting TrisUn d'Acnjft.i. Subsequently there was an interval of rfresh bwozes, and on the Kth August :he meridian ?of the Gape was reached in 39'' 2K S. The eiatins -3Mt very'imil run down with only two checks of em wicd. and tn a parallel Of 40' the vess«l had very good weather. XT.'ien off the Cape there wa3 asharp squill whfcja currieS away the .firing jibboom, but nothing Of any ? conifiuence in th« way of diimv^? occuned barond that, anJ on Wednesday -morning .at 6 o'clock sii-hted Cape Borda. After .getting icto Investigators'1 StraiU Bhe »'i3 l-e- ^alm«d :for sevoril hours b°^ore a sknt of wind tU-cEBsd. Tie vessel was boa.*d«l &t; early morn in, en friday away sotrih-west from the station, and then gun io anchor to pass Cluster The Morrat, of the Orient Line, returned to port «a ftadsjy in charge of Captain Hilf^TT. and it was a var^ag-al» reminder of tb- improve 'menu made in tha line when H was learned that she ha'J spoken the outwaal-bonnd LasUania in th» Straits. The first of ihe Orient Lin* commanders ij at presc 'lt m ^*e colonies, and though the Murray is a won'^'rful im provement on tha old Charlotte Jane, yet the ^'eseot- «Uy Orient steamer quite eclipses both and rets over the voyageiln about half the Ume. When the s.MP was signalled from Cap* Borda it wu supposed to b ^ tJie Baro^sa, but when she hove in sight from tha tuUons on Friday morning it wh soon perceived she was the' Murray.- The officer* made an early start and having pot the pilot on board he filled away on the lUrboard uck ami stood offshore until the vessel could fetch into the roads, where the anchored to await tie services of next morning'* tide, «ben she would be towed into harbour. The Murray left the London dock on Thursday, June 27, with strong east wind, and next day dis charged the pilot off Deal and proceeded to wcrk down Channel. On July 1 she was off Falmotth and made tolerably good progress south, picking up the north-east trades in So* N. 1S° W. on July 9. They were very light and lost entirely in 10s N. W W. on the 16th, when the wind hauled to the southward, and so continued till crGsaiofi tke line in 2S'' W. on July 28. Strong southerly winds prevailed until ticking off the Alirollias ShoaL On Angnst 23 she passed the ineridiaji of the Cape in 40' S., and subse quently increased the latitude to 43*, experiencing squally southerly weather to oir E. On September 12 the Murray w.is on the meridian of Cape Lcuwin with baffling northerly winds, and at daybreak of Septem ber lb &he; sighted the Neptune Islands. Captain Balfour was here some short time back in command of the Alfred Hawley. The Collixgrove had the tug in early attendance on Friday, and was towed to the stream. C!3 MACDOXNEIX BAY. Sept.
