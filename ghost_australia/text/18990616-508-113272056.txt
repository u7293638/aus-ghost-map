THE SENATE. To the Editor of the 'Evening News.' Sir, — On* of the most telling objections to the bill, that seems to carry -weight with all I speak to on the subject ,is'that the senate will be composed exclusively of wealthy men, owing to (until Par liament otherwise provides) each colony being one electorate. It seems to 'me we can use our local and federal people's Houees as a training for the senate. Afier 'Ehe first election, three of the | brightest intellects representing each colony, who have made their mark, could be requested to stand for the senate. A further inducement to our meet capable men would be to reduce the pay of mem .bera cf the Federal Assembly by £50, and add this amount to the payment. of senators; this would raise their pay to £500. This would lead to a moral, intellectual, and progressive Chamber (as no man whose private life was not fairly clean ?would Mhave any chance of -being returned), instead of what our past experience has given us, viz., a Chamber represented by wealth, old age, and con servatism. — Tours, etc. WILLIAM ALDRED. - G-ranville, June 15. . . (There seems no particular, reason to think that thejwiiole colony voting as one constituency would necessitate all the candidates for the senate 'being, ^wealthy. it would be probably .neces.-sary for senatorial candidates to be well known in connec tion with their past achievements; but then well known men should be -better than ncbodies. — Ed The ghost scare 'which recently started in Bal larat (Vic) has .-extended to the Buninyong dis trict. At Mount Clear on Sunday night a young man,- when returning homeward along a. lonely- track, encountered a tall object, with wings. The 'phantom,' the young man informed the police, performed a kind of step dance. After gazing at the figure for some seconds he collapsed with fright, from the effects of which he has not yet quite recovered. * Look out for the Illustrated Federal Issue of the 'Evening News' ^o-morrow.
