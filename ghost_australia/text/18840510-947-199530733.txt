.-, BDSTERWICK PARK RACES The race meeting held under the management of the Victorian Trotting Club on the Elsternwick Park course on Saturday afternoon was a niost. successful gathering. The attendance 'was much larger than has yet'beon seen onlthis course. A new telegraph board; has been erected, nnfron the face of the- ' trottin.ff nudge's atand is a large and handsome clock, the gift of Mr. Thomas Gaunt, of Bourke street. The opening event was the Pair horse Trotting Match for aUOO 'between Mr.;P; G. Dixon's Maid of Mona and Sylph and Mr. T. KobinsV Brown Hawk and . Sparrowhawk. Mr. 'Dixon's pair trotted in admirable!1 style and ' won .?'easily,- 1 .'Mr.' ' Rqbins's team breaking badly all the way. It was said that Sparrowhawk's 'breeching was1' 'strapped so tightly he xouldnot ? extend^himself, and hence hisvery inferior performance. The contest was a very tame affair;''- Four horses started .for'-1 the .Free for-all Purse, which was won by Honesty, / an imported American trotter*! who i aiclthe distance'' 'in -adniirdble: tstyla/.I -LeitliainS stead, wli-)aiJ(l;Botilseoni'toaot'TTbU'ia' tfie first mile, was. second. Oliverdisappointed' his backers greatly, and here again his in different performance was said to arise from bad harnessing. The Two-year-old Selling Race brought out only a couple of starters, Tulta and Calomel. The former won all the way. Tulta was put up for sale and bought by Mi-. Macklin for, .£105, of which the ' club receive £70. The Hurdle Race brought out eight ; starters, Ned Kelly and Equity being ' about equal favourites. Equity made the running, but Merry Maid eame up with a good rush and beat him by a couple of lengths. The Welter Handicap brought out 'inx starters. Phantom and Cupola raced neck and neck up the .straight, the former winning by a bare head. .' It was thought by many that Mr. Yeehd; who road the ivinner of the first Champion Race in Victoria; was hardly an anrateur, but no formal objection was made. Knowledge was heavily backed for the Selling Race, .and till ? within', 50 yards1 of the1 post he; looked all over a winner. Saxon faaine' with a1 well-timed rush, and catching Br6iyn napping won. by about a length. ' 'A protest, was entered against Saxon for running into Knowledge, but after hearing tho evidence the stewards dismissed it. The winner was boutrht in at tho upset. Knowledge was claimed and bought by Mr. Boundy for .£55, of which the club get £5. Oineo was also 'claimed' and bought, by. Mr. Balls for1 the ' upset price.' The List race was the Elsternwick Handicap,' woi by, Lesbia, after a good race ' with, Phantom: '???-'' ??',.'
