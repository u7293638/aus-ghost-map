A GHOST IN LOVE. A farmer, who had lately become widower,was aroused at midnight by the loud barking of his dog. On going to it, the animal. displayed extreme terror, whereupon the farmer took his gun and proceeded to an inspection. All at once he saw a phantom, clothed in a white sheet, rise behind the hedge. The farmer turned deadly pale, and-his limbs shook with dis- may. He, however, contrived to ejaculate, " if you come from heavcn, speak ; if from the evil one vanish !" "Wretch," exclaimed the phantom, "I am your deceased wife,; come from' the grave to warn.you. not to marry Maria A- , to whom you are making -love. The-only woman to succeed me is Hen- rietta B--. Marry' her, or persdcution and eternil tormnent shall be your doom." This strange address from the goblin, instead of dismisying -the farmer, restored his courage. ie accordlingly rushed to the ghostly visitor, and, stripping off the sheet, discovered the fair Henretta B- her self, looking extremely foolish. It is said that the farmer, admiring the girl's trick has had the banns published for his mar- ringe with her.
