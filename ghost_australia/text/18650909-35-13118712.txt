Alliance, in our own day, is an exhibition in another ion of the same glorious unity Yet these institutions, though of immense value in their limited its objects, and exercising a mighty influence beyond them, wore manifestly defective as an exemplification of the oneness of the body of Christ, to which the Now Icstituentgivcssuc h prominence they demonstrated the unity in Christ of individual Chris tniUB But it is our Lord 's will that His followers should be for mere late Churches and Chur ches here in time int t J break down the true ideal of Christian catholicity, but to develop and perfect in the fellowship of a single congregation of Christians is the rudimentary form of Church life , but in such life is capable of indefinite expansion, and it be just in proportion as it is expanded, that the visible Church, as such, approaches the unity which the Lord de- bited by it The craving for unity which characterises the present time is happily the unity not simply of indi- vidual Christmas, but that which arises out of it, and bespeaks a higher stage of development the unity of Christians is already associated in Church fellowship Even these religious bodies, whose theory of Church order would, isolate individual Christian congregations, show a (bit wing dissatistaotion- practically at least-with such isolation, a consciousness of its uunaturaluess, and of the weakness arising out of it, and we see a recourse to various expedients on the part of our brethren in those bodies for securing a combined testimony to the world, and something.; like continued Church organisation and action. Our Episcopalian brethren, on the other hand, are seeking utter a Church unity, for which more Episcopal government and still less tuch gov eminent fettered and a train and, as in England, by a superadded apparatus of State arrangements, -in found to furnish no adequate organisation West cannot but rejoice in the modification which Episcopacy is undergoing in our own colony, in the rise of dances in St nods, with lay as well as clerical representatives, the change being evidently in the right direction, and fitted to extend the liberties, to develope the resources, to promote the efficiency, as well as to cement the unity of that most important and influential portion of the Church of Christ in this land When we look, again, at our own done on thou, the endeavour after greater ecclesiastical unity are to be witnessed Everywhere there is this peculiarity, however None of the Presbyterian Churches-, need to change their existing internal organisation in order to carry out their plans of union The existing organs ation the organise non characteristic of those furnishes the most appropriate machinery both for bringing about weh union, and for securing the harmonious and efficient working of it when attained This, in no small measure, accounts for the extraordinary multiplication in recent times of instances of Presbyterian union, and its no less extraordinary success The various sections of the vast Presby ten in body in the United States of A monea, though not yet formally united, are rapidly approaching each other, and their union cannot be long deferred in the British Empire much in the way of union has been already accomplished In Scotland it is now nearly half-century since the two bodies of the old secession were united in one Church, which, again, was enlarged, somewhat less than twenty years ago, by a further union, which resulted in what is now the United Piosby ten inn Church Arrangements are in progress, under the most promising auspices, for a union betwixt that Church and her younger but more powerful sister, the Free Church, and also for the union with both of the Reformed Presbyterian Church That union when completed, will comprehend two-thirds of the Press testament of Presby terms Scotland the Established Church, indeed, will still remain separate But let us hope that changes will ensue the nature of of the required changes neither side may yet be agreed about, but it is not to be doubted that, when the excitement of recent controversy shall have passed aw n}, and new light be struck out by the march of events, Christian wisdom and charity will find them out by which that v venerable Church which is the mother of us all-the Church of Knox, and Melville, and Henderson, and, erewhile, of Erskine, and Gillespie, and Chalmers will yet with her daughter Churches given back to her, and stronger and better compacted than in the days of her youth, become again, but in a highly and more glorious sense than ever she has ever been hitherto, the National Church of Scotland the Presbyterian Church of England, again, is already making overtures, which are kindly met, for participation in the anticipated union of the Churches north of the Tweed , while, across the Channel, two unions the list of which is more than twenty years old, has resulted in the formation of the Presbyterian Church of Ireland, which comprehends a heifers not the largest portion of Irish Protestantism Turning from the mother country to the British colonies, the union of Presbyterian Churches has spread with such rapidity as now to have become all but universal On the Amoi man continent Much union has taken place in Canada and Nova Scotia i, and, as regards our own Aus of this in New Zealand, in Tasmania, in Victoria in Queen's ntl, in South Australia, and now at last in New South Wales Nor is there any reason why there should not be a confederation of our various Australasian Presbyterian Churches, which might help to still further develop their unity, and, without any infringement of their several rights might economise their resources and promote their efficiency for common ends And this idea of confederation might well be carried out amongst all evangelical Presbyterian Churches throughout the w world the confederation modified, of course, by distance, but at retaining enough to identify all the Churches as one in faith, worship, and government, and furnishing facilities for mutual encouragement in the work of our common Lord Even apart from such confederation, the Presby than Church of New South Wales, this day formed, has become a member, however humble, of the great family of Presbyterian Churches This is enough to fire us with a holy ambition Prcsliv tenaniRm has great traditions It wins the order, as we bolts we, observed in the Primitive Church Under the mighty impulse of the Reformation, it [is the older, generally followed by the Church of Europe in proportion as they were left to spontaneous action, and were unconstrained by princes and rulers It was mainly owing to the intervention of the curd Powers that its adoption was prevented in some countries, and that it was afterwards crushed out in others The Reformed Churches of France, of Holland, of Switzerland, and of Scwtlana, testify to it as a natural and appropriate organ of the reawakened Christian consciousness, and, although in all these countries, with the noble exception of our fatherland, it has suffered long a depression, from which it is only now rising again with a fresh awakening of religious life, and under the shelter of increased civil and religious liberty, it has found compensation in the powerful hold it has taken amid the free institutions of America, where it comprehends within its pale a large proportion of the population, and a still larger proportion of the Christian intelligence and energy of the Commonwealth Presbyterianism. therefore, if only Preab) tenants are true to the spirit of their system and its traditions has a glorious future before it, it is reasonable to believe, in this and the other Australasian colonies With its steadfast adherence to the great doctrines of the Reformation, as embodied in its venerable standards, with the provision which it has always been careful to maintain for scouring an educated ministry, with its combination of ruling along with teaching orders in the government of the Church with the jealousy with which it guards the rights of the Christian people in the election of office-bearers and in general congregational management, with the checks which it provides against merely local and temporary influences in ecclesiastical discipline and administration, it has advantages, as it seems to us, which do not meet under any other system God forbid that we should say, "We are the people, and wisdom must die with us " in our system, at least as hitherto wrought, there are many defects of which we are painfully conscious, and, redoubt, thorough many others of which we are unconscious If, again, other systems, as compared with our own, have their drawbacks, they have also Phar excellences, which we will do well to recognise and copy Still, w 0 have a noble engine with which to work, if we had only wise heads, and strong hands, and loving and earnest hearts to work it And what a glorious, though arduous, mission lies before us There is, first of all, the consolidating of our existing congregations the infusion of new life into them, the development of their resources, the finding work for every one of their members, and the helping of every one at his work, the training of the young, the arousing of our people to act outwards on the religious indifference and the vice around them, and the evoking among them of devout interest and active participation in the general schemes and work of the Church. Then, there is the supplying, in connection with other religious bodies, of the as yet scattered population of our vast interior with the public ordinances of religion, by which alone we can hope to revive in the older portion of that population religious impressions too often well nigh worn out, and to save the young from growing up in something little short of absolute heathenism Our Churches at home lavish their thousands and their tens of thousands annually on missions to heathen lands all honour to their Christian liberality ' Would that it were multiplied a hundredfold ' It is a noble thing to help in carrying out the great commission-" Go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature " But would, also that they only know, that, in the far stretching wilds of Australia, their are their " brethren, their kinsmen according to the flesh, who are as far from the sound of the gospel as the Hindoo or the Hottentot' The first obligation in the matter no doubt lies on the Austral, in Churches, and we must be roused to do our utmost, but until we are stronger and better organised, our utmost will be too little unless our home Churches furnish us with men for the work, and also help us, in the first instance, in maintaining them Situated as w 0 are the work which has to us is great With all the evangelistic effort demanded of us in the recesses of our own island- continent, we are not at liberty to shut our ears to the call from the adjacent islands of the Pacific "Come over and help us ' One of our first duties as a Church will be to organise a mission to the New Hebrides But all this only shows how momentous in the (lines of Australian evangelisation Those young Australian communities, with all the elements of strength belonging to a people chiefly of Anglo Saxon origin, and inhabiting a territory possessed of almost illimitable natural resources, as 0 destined at no very distant day, to become great nations, exercising a mighty influence on the countless islands of Polynesia, on the one hand, and on the larger though less numerous islands and peninsulas stretching on wards towards China and India on the other that their influence may operate for advancing the highest interests of humanity depends on their being thoroughly leavened at the present stage of their development with the knowledge and influence of the Gospel How arduous then, I repeat, and yet how glorious, fathers and brethren, is the mission which opens on us and how shall we be equipped for it, except by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left And how, are we to find this equipment, and to use it wilfully, earnestly, and faithfully when found? In no other way than by our United Church in all its parts, becoming more deeply baptized into the spirit of Christ 'There is much to cheer us in the union of this day. 1 other alterations have been in a great measure overcome -for me. breaches healed-and the divided and dispersed of our denomination are gathered into one in so far as our union is to be traced to any increase of Christian life among UR. and to true Christian zeal and charity, we have cause of thanksgiving to the God of all grace "Sect inferior influences may have mingled to a large extent with those which are higher and purer and enough of spiritual cloud ness and of its concomitant dominoes still remains, to warn us that we must not count too much on more external ann n, 01 on any formal organisation or system of combined action, arising out of it.
