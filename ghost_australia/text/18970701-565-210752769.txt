Poetry. AN AUTIIOITS EPITAPH. Stay, reader, stay, and shed a tear O'er one whose race is run. A Slmkespeare, Homer. Clement Scott, And 8a la rolled in oue : Who, s.ad to say. though filled with zeal, No opus could complete. Because they would not regulate The music of the street-. If solemn thoughts employed his pen, There straightway came along A- primiiug Spaniard with a gift Of incoherent song. And when with light and airy wit Some merry tale he'd tell, There rose upon the tiembling air A sad, funereal knell. With flying pen lie once began An epic great aud grand : 4 Twos very quickly ended by A mad reutouic band. The lyric, almost too sublime, l'V»r human tips to speak, Gave up its blameless ghost let at A bagj/ijie's horrid squeak. Tbe dancing monkey knew bis times J'V.- study deep and brown. And danced, to cheer him, to the tune Or " St rolling Hound the Town." So here he lies, with not a wreath To keep his meiu'ry green, A drcanii-r. all unkuowo to fame, 0£ books that might have been.
