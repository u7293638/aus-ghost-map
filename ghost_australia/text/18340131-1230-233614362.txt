To the Editor of the Tasmanian and Review. SIR,—A controversy lately took place between two of the Newspapers ot" this Town, whether Reynolds the celebrated Irish Spy, was, or was not in this Island, and reference was made by one of them, to the time which had elapsed since he betrayed his countrymen to the scaffold, a proof that he cannot be here. Having been unfortunately a little concerned in the events of that extraordinary time, I am enabled to decide the question. He is assuredly here, for I met either him or his ghost a few days ago.—I am Sir, yours &c.; ERIN GO BRAH !
