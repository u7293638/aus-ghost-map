POETRY. ST. JEROME ON EARTH. From the Times. \- - .. ? BltCOMn V1BTT 'This much I dare say, that, since Lording and. loitering hath coine.up, preaching hath coma down, , contrary to the Apostles, times, for they- preached ' nn'd Lorded not ; arid now thev Lord and nreach not. Ever since ' the Prelates were' mado Lords and Nobles, the plough standeth, there is no work done, ' the people starve.'— ' .' Lallmer — Sermon of 'the Plough.' '. Once more,'' said Jerome, ' I'll run up and see ' How the Church goes on,' — and off set ho. Just then the p'ueket boat, which trades Betwixt bur planet and the shades, Had arrived below, with a freight so queeri '.'*'' ' 'My eyes IV said Jerome,' ' what have we here ?'— ? For he saw when nearer he explored They'd a cargo of Bishops' wigs on board: ' They are ghosts of wigs.' said Cheron, 'all ' Once worn Ky nobs Eplsiopal. '.'''? ' For folks on earth, when they've got a Btore ' Of things like these, they want no more, ' Oft send them down, as gifts you1 know, '? To a certain Gentleman here below.' ''A sign of the times, I plainly Bee,' ' Said the saint to himself as, pondering, ha Soil'd off in the death-bout gallantly. Arrived on earth, quoth he, ' no inoro ' I'll affect a body as Before j . ' For I think I'd best, in the company ?? , Of Spiritual Lords, a spirit be, ; ?? And glide unseen from See, to See.' But; oh I to tell what scenes he saw,-— It was more than Rabelais' pen could draw. For instance, ho found 'Ex — t- — r, Soul, body ,; inkstand, nil in a stir,— For love of God ? for sake of King ? For' good of People? No'such thing; ': But to get for himself, by some new trick, 'Ashoye to a better bishoprick. He found that pious soul, Van M — Id— t, 'Much with his money bags bewildered, Snubbing tho clerics of .his diocess, ?' Because] the rogues showed restlessness At having so little cash to touch, ' ' While he so Christianly bears too much. He found old Sarum's wits as gone, As his own beloved text in John — *' Text he hath prosed so long upon, .' ? That 'tis thought when asked at tho gate of heaven, His name, he'll answer 'John, v. 7.' ' ' But enough of Bishops I've had. to day,' Said the weary saint, — ' I must away. - 'Though I own I should like before I go, ?'To see for once, (as I'm asked below, ''If really such odd sights exist,) ' A regular six-fold pluralist.' Just then he' heard a general' cry* : ? 'There's Doctor Hodgson galloping by!' ' ; ' ' 'Ay, that's the man' says the saint 'to follow,' And off, he sets, with aloud view hollow, ...... At Hodgson's heels, to catch if he can A glimpse of thin singular plural man, . But, talk of Sir Boyle Roche's birdl.t 'To compare him with Hodgson is absurd* ' 'Which way, Sir, pray, is the' Doctor gone?' ' He is now at his living at Hillingdon.' ' No, no^— you'ro out, by many a mile, ??'.He's away at his Deanery; in Carlisle ;' ' Pardon me, Sir, but I understand -' '' ' He's gone to his living, in Cumberland.' ' God bless me, no — he can't be there— '-1' ?'''? ? ' You must try St. George's, Hanover Square.'. Tlhis'nll in vain tho saint inquired, From living to living, mock'd arid tired';—. ' ?' ' ♦Twos Hodgson here, 'Was Hodgson theroV - ? -'Twas -Hodgson no whore, every where ; Till; fairly beat, the saint gave o'er, ' - ' ' . r ' ?And flitted away to the' Stygian shore; . ' .' ' To astonish'the natives under ground'1 '?'?'?' ' '' ' With the comical things he on earth had found.
