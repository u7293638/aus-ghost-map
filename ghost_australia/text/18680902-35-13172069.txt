IS THERE TO BE NO END OF IT To the Editor of the Herald. " The times have been That when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end ; but now they rise again And push us from our stools." Sir,- One would think that after so many long and painful hours of listening to lawyers and parsons on both s doz, each from his own professional point of view, and after the Synod, to enlightened, decided by an overwhelming majority, that the question of tribunal was settled, and that its phantom would not use again to force upon our peaceful recess the same weary debate again and again on paper so far as law is concerned, it was argued " to the bitter end, until some of us, suffering torture under the iteration and ear-splitting, sighed out the thought-.' If the law does not allow us to do what the smallest sect of the population may do, and does, so much the worse for the law ' If the legal arguments against the tribunal had not been shown to be utterly inapplicable, they could have only gonotopiovo thotweweie not wise in adhering to the title-United Church of England and Ireland, at all But I am no lawyer so I prefer looking at the ghost conjured up by Olmo on, which is dressed in clerical garb -1 will not say "vestments" and vi aves awfully in his skeleton hands the " five octavo volumes of Downer, in an English dress" Avaunt I say Aroynt theo, fiend, I defy thee ' Dost think there spirit of Medieval lore, lean and haggard vampire of the white blood of books, there nightmare of the history of forgotten heresies, lost think, I say, that this tribunal is to try it, in this Church of England, in this century, by the lore of the past ? Upon a matter of doctrine or discipline, I trust Deane and Co would remain in your spectre hands-but in the hands of the triers," the creed-, and formularies to which I have subscribed in their lives' and go ammaUcal sense ? All the laity may not indeed be competent to test even by this standard, for even letters and grammar are not universal, but remember, O Spectre, that those are selected laymen, that there is a presiding Bishop, that even out of the selected laymen I my self have the selection of the facts, that there must be at least one counsel loomed in the Lay, and three clergymen who may be learned in a Dornier and Co , besides the Bishop Therefore I say, aiojntlhto1 disturb not my peaceful slumbers " Get thee back into the darkness, and the night's Plutonian shore, Take thy beak from out my heart, and thy form from off my door " The thing is well done Requiescat in pace ZACHARY BARRY, LLD.
