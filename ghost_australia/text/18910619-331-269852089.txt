WRITTEN IN RED: Ok, THE CONSPIRACY IN THE NORTH CASE.* * A STORY* OF BOSTON. Br Cnis. Moxtaock asd C. W. Dvab. CHAPTER XI.—I.v Diicocn. Reporter Thomas had no time to construct theories to account for what had happened. For whatever reaeon, Stella North was the woman^ he had unwittingly followed, and Stella North was the woman who now lav in his arms, at devoid of life to all apjKsarancos, a* the twigs upon which her dainty feet were dragging. He looked into her face for the moment with helpless irresolution. The dictates of common humanity would have impelled him topitrher. but it was no ordinary pitv that filled kis soul on this occasion. He Lad been aware ever since the day she dashed upon him that appealing glance as her sister was leading her from the room at Swampscott of a peculiar interest more romantic and tender, perhaps, than he as a matter-of-fact-man was free to admit to himself. ' Uutthe present emergencydt:nan<U*d prompt action, lie could tzi plainly enough that it eras not merely fright that had caused her to lose consciousness. Nature had bestowed upon her a face charming in its natural rouodneM of outline and ready always to break into dimpled smiles: but, alas! horror and deprivation of sleep and food hsd wrought a wicked change is a few days. As she lay with her head thrown back, her lips parted, her eyes doted, her hair straying recklessly about her temple*, the looked as if she had just died after a painful illness. Thomas hastened with her out of the sight of possible curiosity. A tew ste;* brough* him deep enough into ft projecting w<x«d thnt triuged the roadside, and here, in the leaves beneath the trees where the birds were singing, be laid her gently down. His experience in the art of restoring fainting women to con sciousness had been extremely limited, but he believed in the efficaciousae** of alcohol, and alway> carried when travelling for use in an emergency a ffask of brandy. A little of this strong remedy j-oureddown the throat half strangled the victim, but it awoke her. Her eves opened and she regarded him languidly, lie had seen » dying bird look just that way.’ ** Come, Mi.** North, vou feel better now, don't you he said awkwardly, a« he sup ported her head upon bis arm. Aud then when a sudden betrayal of fear and shame surged into her white’ checks he hastened to add— “ There, now, there's nothing to be afraid of. Not the least in the woxld.” She made an effort to disengage herself and to arise, but she was very weak, and she only sank back again with a pathetic sigh. The tears came into her eyes at ouce, and she was unable to conceal her weakness or to check it. Faster a»t i faster they chased each other down her cheeks. Her face wa* wet with them. Thomas watched her with increasing con sternation. He who had time and again pajwed, apparently unmoved, through the moat terrible and heartrending of scenes, had now to make a great effort to retain control o; himself. But a% a matter oi fact it is improbable that tbe girl detected any evidence* of agitation in his naturally iim»eriurbable countenance. 44 Come, Miss North,” he murmured, 44 this will never do. You must not give way like this. Don't despair. It there is anything wrong, you may depend upon me to help you all I cm.** 44 Oh, it'« not I who need the help,” she moaned, quite light-headed by reason of her lojxg sufferings; and grasping his sleeve with her little hand she excliitued with sudden, passionate intensity, •* Oh. don't let them arrest her. Don't let them hang her. Marion nevtr could have done it iu her right mind. She was ou of her head, vou know. You are sure she wa?, are vou not?” This unexpected entreat)* was a surprise, but it was a most welcome one to Thomas. He had not had an opj>ortunity for deliberate thought since he had recognised who it was that liad thrown away the uncompromising weapon with the suspicious smudge upon it, and tied from tbe North villa iu the mod damaging of circumstances; but in a vague. gexu’ral way his heart had l*een conscious of the weight of the accepted theory that she was iu somn way itn* plicated in the dark work o: the tragedv. And now these wild, hysterical words, delivered under the pressure of her overstrung emotions, gave him more than a hope that she was inno ctut of any part in tbe hideous crime. Innocent! How could anybody look upou this child and doubt her innocenceReporter I Thomas certaiuly could not, and he gave up i trying to. with a feverish alacrity that wn not entirely characteristic of him. Comprehending enough of tho situation to enable him to act Intelligently, he began at once a long attempt to soothe her. And behold another miracle! ThU stem man, whoso stoicism was the wtnier of hi* associates, had ruddeuly become as patient, as geutle, and a» delicate as a woman. He smoothed her hair, he wij-ed away her teare. He induced her to take a little more of the brandy. By repeateily assuring her that her idjiter was iu no /longer, and afterwards, by turning her attention to other thing*, he brought her once m'.re into a condition of sanity. She was not permitted to teat her strength upon her fret, but sho sat up against a tree, and began to regard her companion with great, round, wistful eyes, with an air of mingled timidity ami impulsive cnnlldcc'e. 44 And now, Miss North,” said Thomas, at last. •* it is absolutely necessary that I should leave you for a few minutes. Will you promise me uot to stir until I return f l will be gone just as short a time as possible.” 44 You are so kind,” she said, faintly. 44 If it is for me you aro going I hope, really, you won't trouble yourself. Ju a few minutes I shall be stronger and can go ou.” 44 WVll talk about that after 1 come back," he slid, cheerfully. *• And meantime I have your promise not to stir r” “ S;nce you are so good I can refuse you nothing,” she returned, wearily, and closed her Thomas was off at an energetic pace. He first tied his horse to a tree, and thuxi ran on to the nearest farmhouse. A well-to-do-looking woman, with a ounuv face, appeared at the door in answer to his knock. *• Madam,” said Thomas, hastily. 441 have to apologise for my unexpected call, but. the fact is, I am in great need of food—the best you have and plenty of it. I*H pay—anything. Only let me have it at cnc*v 44 But I can’t,” said the woman ; 441 haven’t a thing in the house to eat !” *4 But I must have something,” exclaimed Thomas ; 44 if it’s nothin? but tmlk and water. The case is very urgent. Here, do what you can for me.” He thrust ft five-dollar bill into the good woman's hand. She thrust it back promptly. 44 Here, I don't want your money.” she said, rather stiffly. 44 Such as I have you’re welcome to. Come in.” She led the astonished Thomas into an ample •PubtJMETbv special arrangement with ilemxt. CaawU* ' pantry, which was in n condition of neatness that was utmost painful. Hut it needed no ]K>wer of divination to determine that it was the pride of the good woman’s life, and the shelves fairly groaned with good things. Not a thing in the houso to oat! Thomas was dumb with delighted amazement. . “ Well,*' said the housewife, evidently enjoy iug the condition of Rtupcfscuon to which she had ieduced him, “do you see anything you’d like \ If so, you’re welcome.” “The—tho fact is,** stammered Thomas, “ I wish you'd let me pav for it. I—1—you sco I might carry away a littlo more than l*d like to; for the fact is l*ve got a friend just back herein the woods, and she—he's starving to Tho woman laughed outright. Of couiao. she did not believe that anybody was dying in this land of plenty. Tho best Thoru&s; could do was to effect a compromise. *l*ho woman accepted “a dollar for the heathen." Thomas took away all he onld well cam*. As the reporter approached the place where he had left Stella North, ho began to have some fears that she had deserted lum in spite of her promise: but no. There she was, still sitting against tho tree, as he had loft her. No, not as he had left her. Completely exhausted, •he had fallen asleep. ’Thomas plac'd his bundles upon the ground, and softly arranged the repast tie had secured from the farmhouse upon a light robo ho had taken from the carriage. From the bowl ot fresh milk to the golden brown custard pie, it was genuine and wholesome: and though he would fain have had Young** chief cook at his command for an hour or two, still he hoped that she could not fail to find the display at tractive and appetising. But he hesitated to awakon her. The poor child slept as only one utterly worn out can sleep. Ho lookeef at her more attentively, and liis heart accelerated its pulsations. “What a pity.” he thought, “that she should be so coinprismgly mixed up in such an affair n> this! ^ oung and charming as she is, if the police know what I know they would not hesitate a minute to arrest her." The thought clouded his brow. He looked at his watch. It was getting late. 1,‘nleas he proposed to turn her over to tho police, iu truth, time pressed. “Ahem!” he exclaimed. “ Miss North !’* ! But her sleep was too deep to bo disturbed by such an expedient. He placed his hand gently uj>on*hcr shoulder, and a thrill ran through him at the contact. She started up and stared wildly,alout her. Gradually the truth came to her, Sho awoke from a happy oblivion to the Lonvr of the past few'days. The sudden frightened look iu her face proclaimed thin fact. And then her oyrs wandered from the reporter’* face to the collation spread at her feet. “ For me !" she exclaimed. “ Oh " But nothing but tears bespoko her thanks. She was evidently ashamed to betray hcnulf »o ; but she was tx> weak to prevent it. She covered her face with her hands and sank down at the foot of the tree. “ You’ll think mo foolish, I know," sho stammered. “ Not a bit of it," said Thomas. 44 I think vour nerve* are quite unstrung, bccauso you haven’t taken nourishment enough. Kat something, Miss North, I bog of you; and, my word for it, you’ll feel better." By dint of much persuasion and adroit management he reassured her, so that ®he actually smiled the very ghost of a amile, but it betrayed the presence of a merry dimple in her check, which Thomas thought quite charm “ How can I thank yon ;** she murmured. 44 By eating all you ran,’’ he returned. And* she did endeavour to show her gratitude In that way. From time to time she looked at him with a glance of dread and apprehension. ** You aro not afraid of me. Mis* North, I hope:" he said at last, pleasantly. He was smiling now, as he «at on a rock near by watching her eat, which the did with that ravenous apj-etite that comes of absolute starvation. 44 Kxcuse me,4* she said, after on evident effort. “ but you are the same gentleman who called at our house—who used to know mv Thomas flushed a little and his eyes fell. “ Mi&s; North.** he said, 441 don't intend to deceive you. I am a newspaper reporter.** She uttered a slight scream and uropped her knifo and fork into her plate. At another time Thomas would have laughed aloud at the un mistakable consternation produced by the an nouncement of his profession. As it wan, he repressed hi* tendency to smile when ho saw her lips whiten under the cruel apprehension that had sprung to life within her. “ You mistrust xne, Miss North,** ho said, 44 Oh, no,” she returned, in a voice barely audible. Anil added immediately, “ For pity’s sake, sir, do you intend to priui what I tolu you when I was Vo crarv awhile ngor" “1)0 1, Miss North: It depends upou whether or not you go cn with your dinner." “ Oh, how can you joke about a thing like this’:" 44 Miss North, I am not joking. I never was more serious in my life. It is absolutely im* j*>rative that you eat." The j>oor girl tried to propitiate him by swallowing a few hasty mouthfuls, but it was evident that he had taken bor appetite away. She regarded him with a look of pathetic “Oh, sir.*' she exclaimed suddenly, "I am only a poor girl, and chance has placed me completely at your mercy. Don’t tor ment me. 1* beseech you. Tell me tho worst at once. 'What do voa intend to do with “ To save you," auswered Thomas. “To *avo me:” she repented helplessly. “ From what 44 From the consequences of your conduct," 44 Mine!'* she exclaimed. 41 What do you moan \ I have done nothing.” 41 Pardon me," said Thomas. 44 You forget the pistol which you threw away, and your flight from home." She fctared at him for a long time like a “ And you believe—'* she began at last, with an awful look in her face. 4‘1 belieTe nothing," he interrupted. 44 so much as I believe you. Miss North. It is not a question of me, but of the police." “ The police—police she stammered. 44 Miss North," said Thomas, 441 would not frighten you needlessly, but I feel compelled to tell you that you have placed yourself, in the eves*of the law, in a very equivocal position. l;nless you can give a full explanation of your conduct—" 44 Oh. «dr,** the broke in, 44 I can tell the police nothing—absolutely nothing." .She wrung her liands and looked at*out her apprehensively. “ It’# not because 1 am guilty of anything— oh, sir. y«>u know that! But I cannot say what I have thmicht. what I have Ih*uu com pelted t<i believe m spite of myself. I have said thing* to you already, when 1 didnot realise what 1 was doing, which I never meant to have repeated to any human being. And you—on your honour, sir !—won’t you keep my “ I will do everything I can for your rister, for your sake," said Thomas. 44 But I must ask you ouo question. What reason had you to believe her guilty r'1 441 do not believe it. No. I will not ac knowledge that I ever really believed it. But ; fur one moment, wheu her strange actions | seemed unaccountable uj>on any other suppod- 1 lion, 1—hut it was a mistake, b;r. I am sure j of it. She could explain everything if the | “There, there!” said Thomas, soothingly, j 44 Don’t get excited. You are as safe with me as you could possibly be with any one. I simply wanted to have the assurance from your lips that you are unaware* of the fact of any crime." “ Oh, believe me, sir." 441 do, Mi#s North. I believe you implicitly, and I will do everything in my power to help ^ 44 You are very noble, sir." 44 You flatter mo," said Thomas, averting his eyes. 441 have sisters of my own, and—" The girl clash'd her hands. 44 And forthuir sake®—" “No, for vour sake," said Thomas, turning quickly to look towards the road. "You spoke of that dreadful pistol, sir!*’ she cried, suddenly. “Tell me how you 441 saw* you. Miss North." 41 And the pistol ia—” 44 In my pocket." She strotchod out her hands impubivelv, while a wild light of hope lighted iu her lace. 44 Give it to me," she exclaimed. “Forgive me," said Thomas, “hut I must refuso you that. Believe me, it pains mo to be obliged to refuso you anything." 41 You—won't give it to me,” she faltered. “And what, then, do you propose to do with it r" “ I will be frank with you now as ever, Miss North," he said, in a low voice. 441 intend to give it to tho police." She swayed, but his arm prevented her from **Come! come!" ho exclaimed, in a quick whisper, as for the moment he held her close to Ihis rapidly-beating heart. 44 Be a woman! Do your duty as I shall do mine 1 I have promised you my protection—my utmost effort on behalf of yourself and your sister. Miss North, will you trust me?” Impulsively she brought her face very near to his and turned tho light of her blue eyes full iuto his dark ones. It was an intense, 'tearful, searching stare; a look such as ono roignt cast into the future at a fork iu the road of life be tween lasting happiness and despair. His gaze never faltered, but hors did. Sho blushed, suddenly became self-conscious, and precipi tately looked down at the ground. “ / will,” she murmured, faintly. “You are in imminent danger,*' he said, hastily. u Thercis no time to lose. Follow me.” And ns ho turned from her she obeved him with the trusting confidence of a little child.
