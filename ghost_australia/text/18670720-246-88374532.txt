ORIGINAL POETRY. (The following "rhymes for the times," were loudly applauded when delivered at our Popular Readings on Thursday evening.] BACCHUS MARSH. If the ghost of old Bacchus should chance to be here— And ghosts may be present , though they do not appear; For if, as some think, when our spirits are fled From the bodies that hold them (that is, when we're dead) Our ghosts are permitted to wander through space And revisit at pleasure each old fav'rite place— The good Captain's, no doubt, will often flit round This, the spot where on earth so much pleasure he found, And to which he bequeathed, as a legacy rare, His name-which in future the district should bear. How annoyed must that decent old spirit be feeling To think that some folks would his good name be stealing, And changing, for something a little more flash, The now famous nomen of plain Bacchus Ma'sh. "Are 'you mad ?" he would say, "for a whim to discard, The name that's a watchword, wherever 'tis heard, For the richest of grass and the finest of crops The primest of lamb, and the sweetest of chops Where the cattle got fat in a far greater hurry Than at any place south of the famed river Murray, Where the veal is so white, and the bacon so thick, That the butchers in town bid each other up quick If the salesman but says, with a tap of his hammer, That's Bacchus Marsh fed—though it might be a crammer ! No, my friends, if you still would my blessing retain, Never mention the thing in my presence again; Or I swear, by the body which through life I carried, I'll appear to the wretch—be he single or married And teach him a lesson will make him think shame Ere he ventures again to make light of my name." W. G. 17th July, 1867.
