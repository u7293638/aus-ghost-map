m. ' The river "bore swiftly on its dosom ueit Hudson's stout little craft. Dprkness was falling,, and the tall pines "by the water's edge stood up like lank ghosts in the ga thering gloom, the sound of tbe. ram among - their branches, mingled, with the thunder of . rushing .waters, , raising,-' uncanny . thoughts.' ' ' : . v-T S ' "Pull in here," at length, cried Jeff. • Above the hiss of "the rain and the' sough . of the ivind, the roar of the river, as it crashed over rocks, .was plainly audible., In "midstream lay a long, low,island, jnow: partly submerged. , - - . . They had run the canoe ashore and were carrying it. through the trees. Presently . Jeff, who was leading,^stopped. _ . "See,' yonder," he said. ,'Tsnt that- a • ' . , ' V /. The boys set down their load, and crept, . cautiously forward.. When within . a lew. vards of the blaze, Tod drew up. . , "It's Pedro Eamarez,"" he wiiispered. ... Hear the fire beside Pedro stood a mule. Pedro himself at the moment of the boys' arrival on the scene was .undressing. Hav-. ing divested' Himself of his - clothing, he walked to the . water's edge. The boys', iceeping at a safe.distance, made for the , same place. „ . ' . . At the spot where the Mexican stood -. was the stump of a tree, pro trading'from g large mound, and round it was fastened the end of a long hide rope.. The other end of this Eamarez tied about his waist,; and then, without further hesitation, leaped in- - to the water. With powerful Strokes .he • worked'his way across the swollen river, . the rope gradually , paying , out from the coils on the' mourid. ' • ... .. "There's spmethmg -over 'there • he's anxious to get at before the- island's flooded," said Jeff! ■ ' Dangerously near the rocks at .the head of the rapids Pedio Eamarez was 'taken be,- - fore.lie reached the other . side.' For some minutes he disappeared, and -in* those mihutes the rain seemed to fall with -in- -; creased." fury. At length he again came into view,, and. in the .dimness the boys were able to see that be had secured a bag about his neck. -... . Once more.the.Mexican plunged into the . water, this-time hauling :on the line. : Be-, fore long, however, it became evident that]. he was in 'difficulties.- The waves Sviashed . V over him, the rushing tide seemed .eager,;to v seize and dash him against those1 deadly rocks. At last, when half-way-across, he . he threw up 'his anhs and uttered a fearful - shriek. - - - ■. "HeVdrowning! Look, he's trying to • loosen, the bag from .his throat! He'll be - over/ the rocks in a minute! Pull on the- : line^-quick!" -v" ■■■•.< .- . > Five minutes later they landed Pedro's body,-apparently lifeless, among the pines.. "He's not dead," said Jeff. "His heart beats, and, see, his eyes are opening." ... • Those eyes rested first upon Tod Bayers, and instantly the naked, wet form writhed as if in agony. ' . "You!" he moaned. "Curse you!That you should catch -me thus. Foivthe love \ of heaven, get me a priest; l am dying." In the silence that followed, the .sound - of feet, and tramping through the under growth was heard. "Hullo, there!" cried Jeff. "Help!" ■ Gruff voices answered.. ; "They're the men, from. the. Gulch!" de-; clared Tod. "From the.Gulch!" shrieked Pedro, striv. ing to rise.. "Don'tjet ^hem take me.

' "What would you confess?" demanded Tod, on: a sudden inspiration. \- v "Ybii null save me?" . V . "Confess! it was' you who killed Old Man Harvey." .. . '1 "Ah! you know." ; "With my father's knife." "Yes;. I stole it." "To revenge yourself for the thrashing \- 'he ga,ve you." "ft is true. Oh, don't - let- those men .take me." - The Mexican fell- back. ! Tod looked; up. Shooter Sam and one "or two more of the.. Gulch miners stood near. "You heard?" asked the boy, "I did." ' ' "You were op your way to Saulville to. break open the gaol andfynch my father." . No one answered for a moment; then . 'Sam replied— \- "That's so." . . . . "Are you smart enough, to see how . things" stand now?" "Don't kick us when we're down, young ' "un. i We'll make good by hanging the • greaser, to this yer tree." ^ "You're too late; he's dead." "The reason I went to Saulville. so mys teriously," said Mr, Dowers, when he, was "free once more and explanations were asked for, 'Svas to see a' lawyer for. Old Man Harvey, He had heard that he was 'sole heir to a- large estate in England left " by his brother,-and, as he wag ill .and ilikely. to. die, and had neither chick nor, child, he sent for me."
