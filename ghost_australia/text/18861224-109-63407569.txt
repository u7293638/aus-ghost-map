THE Detective's Dream By Waif Wander. (W. W.) It is years since I dreamt that dream, yet scarcely a Christmas comes and goes that I do not many times recall it. Perhaps it and the events which followed made a deeper impression on my memory because I was at the time barely recovering from the most serious illness I ever had in my life, and was un- hinged both in body and mind. Two doctors had insisted on change of air and scene, and I had got leave from my superiors, but where was I to go? The bustle and noise of a summer seaside haunt would have driven me wild, and I had not a single friend in the country that I could take the liberty of offering a visit to. One of the unexpected coincidences we so often meet with in life, and which good folk are fond of calling providential, solved the difficulty for me. I met in the street Albert Pemberton, a young University student I had accidentally been able to help in a not over re- spectable mess he had got into in one of our Town slums, and his good-looking face beamed with pleasure as he recognised me. "Good heavens,how bad you look, Sin- clair," he cried, "I only heard by the merest accident the other day that you had been seriously ill. I was just going to hunt you up-upon honor I was, to ask you to accom- pany me home for the holidays." 'Home wih you!" I said "why I am a perfect stranger to your people. I couldn't have the cheek to quarter myself on them un invited, and what a chance there is of them inviting a detective to Werrimona!" " How proud you are; but you're wrong, for I have an invitation for you in my pocket. I wrote asking leave to take you up with me, telling them, you may be sure, that I was greatly indebted to you, Sinclair, though I daren't enter into particulars, and there--you can read the paragraph if you like." "Mrs Pemberton is very kind, and I am very grateful,"I said as I returned the letter " but you are going to have a wedding in the family, and I am quite unfit for any festive- ties " " You need not even share them unless you wish. Evelyn's wedding is to be the quietest you can imagine, but you need not even see the ceremony unless you choose. I have settled it all in my own mind, old fellow, you shall have my room; it is a regular bachelor's den with an entrance of its own--you can come and go without a soul being the wiser. Now you won't say no!" I didn't say no, I went with my young friend to his home at Werrimona, and there I dreamed my dream. Werrimona was and is one of the loveliest spots the sun of Victoria shines on. It is a nest of verdure among the hills that slope in around it leaving broad openings here and there that the eye may wander to the blue moun- tain peak in the far distance, or rest on the shimmering, windings of Werrimona Creek. If the whole country had been searched for a peaceful spot in which one might rest and en joy, with a thankful heart the beauties of God's given earth, none fairer could be found than fair Werrimona. Mrs Pemberton had been long a widow, and was a sweet-faced, motherly woman, who set me at my ease in a few friendly words; to Evelyn Pemberton, her only daughter and the soon-to-be bride, I must devote a few more words. I never understood the girl from the first, though sad after events taught me an explana- tion of much that had puzzled me. She was very beautiful, no one could look in her face and not acknowledge that, she was twenty one, tall, and slenderly built, but of admirable womanly proportions, and she had the most perfect, though slightly peculiar, taste in dress. Her hair and eyes seemed of almost the same hues--brown with gleams of gold in them. The former was abundant, soft and wavy, the latter large, heavy lidded, and fringed with deep lashes that made a noticeable feature in her face. Her mouth was, I think, the sweetest I ever saw, and in her rare smiles the rich lips afforded a glimpse of teeth regular and white as rows of pearls. Yes, Evelyn was beautiful in spite of the almost total absence of color in her face. Her complexion was of a delicate creamy hue, and only in rare moments of excitement a pale rose tint appeared for an instant in her soft cheeks. The very first time Evelyn Pember- ton's eyes rested on mine in a deep, and al- most solemn gaze, I felt a strange thrill through my whole being--a thrill that had something of a shudder in it, though the warm summer sun was beaming down on my bare head as I bowed before her. It was not until after I had seen her that I felt interest enough to question Albert as to whom she was about to marry. He had been initiating me into the comforts and peculiari- ties of his den, which he had, as he promised, resigned to me, and a little fatigued with the journey, I seated myself in a chair near the window to enjoy the wild view of hill and dale it afforded while we indulged in a smoke. "Well?" he asked, " what do you think of the mater and Evelyn ?" ' I think you are a happy fellow to have such a mother," I replied, " and that you ought to try and lead a life worthy of her." " Don't hit so hard old fellow!" he said with a becoming flush rising to his brown cheek," I'll try hard for the future." " My dear Pemberton, I assure you I only spoke in general terms--I had no intention of recurring--" "No," he interrupted. "I am sure you hadn't, but a bad conscience you know. But you haven't told me what you think of my sister yet." " She is very beautiful-- very, may I ask who it is she is going to marry, Albert?" "I should think you may; why you'll meet him at dinner to-night--that is if you don't prefer dining here--I promised you perfect liberty you know." "Thanks, but I must not be too exacting or selfish. I must make the acquaintance of Miss Pemberton's intended at all events. I have gathered that he is a neighbour ?" "Yes, his station is only two miles away, and he is one of the nicest young fellows in the world. If there is any fault to be found with him it is his youth, he is the same age as Evelyn--but that you know, will mend. She is a lucky girl to hook such a husband as Kingsley--Charley is amiable and wealthy." " And is devoted of course ?" ' Oh, of course, that goes without saying but I don't mind telling you, Sinclair, that he's far easier satisfied than I should be in his place." "As how?" "Because Evelyn is so cold--if I was going to be married to a girl I'd expect her to seem happy at all events." "And don't you think your sister is happy ?" "She says she is. But, oh heavens, Sinclair what's the use of trying to underetand women ?" added the nineteen year old cynic, "I don't suppose they're ever of the same mind two months together." "I hope you have no reason to include Miss Pemberton in that sweeping accusation," I said. "I have then," was the short answer, and the young fellow bent his brows gloomily and pulled hard at his cigar ere he spoke again. "I know that you're a safe card to talk to, Sinclair, I can trust you to hold your tongue if I say to you what I wouldn't to another. You see the mater and Evelyn look upon me as a boy, and I'm out of the running in family consultations, but I spoke up about Ned Cor-- wyn before things had gone too far, and I got snubbed for it." " Ned Corwyn ?" "Oh, you don't know him, he's another neighbour, a school-mate of mine, and of Evelyn's too, for that matter, though he is years older than either of us. Well, if ever a girl was spooney on a fellow Evelyn was on him, and by Jove it was mutual, he worshipped the ground she walked on." "Is he dead?" I asked, thinking I had found a solution of the mysterious sadness is Evelyn Pemberton's eyes. "Dead? not he! the poor fellow's taken it like a sheep, and is the mater's right hand man. You will see him at dinner to-night too.' "Am I to understand that your sister was engaged to this Mr. Corwyn, and that it was broken off in favour of Mr. Kingsley ? " "That's how I take it, but as a matter of fact I know nothing positively. I tell you I am only the boy in this establishment, and am not trusted with the family secrets. I know that I used to ----- Ned about being my brother, and he liked it, and all at once it was as much as my life was worth to venture a hint at such a thing," I felt rather curious to see these young men who were to meet on friendly terms under such peculiar circumstances. The low sun was shining in the drawing-room window at Werrimona when Mrs Pembnrton introduced me to them, and my first idea in connection with either was that I was disappointed in Kingsley as a husband for the queenly Evelyn. He was simply a fair haired and empty-headed boy, full of chatter and vanity, good tempered, doubtless, and proud ot his beautiful fiancee but no more suited as guide, guardian, and companion to such a woman than a school boy of twelve. Edward Corwyn was a totally diernent stamp of man. I daresay he was twenty seven. He was tall and strongly built, yet gentlemanly--nay, distinguished looking. I have seen such a man in a cavalry regiment, with a sword in his hand, and the air of one born to do great deeds. What could be the secret influence that forced Evelyn Pember- ton to discard such a man for a common- place boy such as Charlie Kingsley? And yet when I had engaged in conversa- tion with him, and been some time in his com- pany, I began to think that the grave gentle- ness of Edward Corwyn might hide a terrible will and fierce passions. Not that he revealed this in words, but I once or twice saw a flash in his eyes, as they turned towards Miss Pemberton, that haunted me. In his imme- diate attentions to her he was only the smiling and attentive old school-fellow, and he treated Kingsley as a man would a favoured brother, lightly and half mockingly: it was only when he momentarilly forgot his role that I saw the dark grey eyes fash with an ominous fire. I watched Evelyn closely, but saw nothing to guide me as to her feelings in the dignilfed calm of her beautiful face. She accepted the attentions of her intended in a queenly way that seemed natural to her. Her grand eyes were turned on him, on Corwyn, or on myself with the same quiet smile. She was like a beautiful piece of mechanism wound up to play a certain part, in which it was imposeible she should fail Once or twice I saw the mother's eye glance anxiously towards her, and once I saw that Evelyn's eyes met those of her mother, and an- swered the anxiety in them with a smile. It was a tame evening altogether, in spite of the young people's music, and I was glad when I got back to Albert's room, and was once more seated by the open window look- ing out at the moonlight lying in patches on the mountains, and silvering the nearest foliage with gleams among the shades. I was contrasting the solemn quiet of this night scene at Werrimona with the glaring gas and noisy streets of Melbourne at that hour, when the door opened and my young friend Albert entered. "I guessed you would not be sleepy Sin clair," he said as he dropped into a chair op- posite me, "this is an early hour for fel- lows used to town life. I won't be in the way, eh?" "Not at all," I replied ." On the contrary, I am glad of your companionship. This--' and I pointed to the gloomy shadows among the silent hills " is depressing to me--it is like a land of ghosts." "Aye, after town it is quiet. But, Sinclair, I've got news for you-our wedding is to come off sooner than we expected." " Sooner ? " "Yes, you know it was settled for the 29th, but it seems that Charlie has business press- ing in Sydney, and he's coaxed the mater to let the marriage take place on Christmas eve." " And your sister has consented? " "It seems so. I didn't know it until to-night, but it seems everything has been put forward. By Jove its a good job I brought my war-paint up with me after all! " " You are to be best man, of course ? " "Yes, and Miss Emerson is to be brides- maid. It's not Charlie's fault that it's to be such a quiet affair--he, poor fellow, would willingly have spent no end of money on it, but its one of Evelyn's fads that she's to be married like --like a machine girl, by Jove!" I heard a good deal about the arrangements before Albert left me, and I eat there thinking over them and enjoying the quiet long after the household had retired. The rustling of the lonely branches on the darkening hill-side had a weird attraction for my unaccustomed ears-the voiceless air breathing on my face seemed to bring new life into my veins, yet withal even my hardened soul felt, as I had told Albert, a solemn depression that was half fear in the lonely night scene among the Wer. rimona Hills. I had risen, and was about to close the win. dow, when I saw a woman's form gliding among the busbes a little distance from the back of the house where my room was, and I naturally stood still to watch. I had no light, for I had put out the lamp on my first en trance, so as to enjoy the full beauty of the calm moonlight. The woman did not go far, she stopped under a tree a little way up the ride of the hill, and was quickly joined by a man. The latter was tall, that was all I could be certain of, though my eyes were keen from years of detective duty, but the woman I had a nearer view of before she disap peared. The interview was a short one, and the female hastened back towards the house. Once she turned to look back and satisfy herself that her companion had gone-it was as she turned again and moved that her face and figure crossed a ray of moonlight and I saw them both. It was a short, active girl of twenty-three or four, apparently one of the maids, and disgusted with myself for watch ing a servant's interview with some rustic lover, I closed the window and went to bed. I slept well and was out in the garden be fore any of the family had made their appeac anoe. Shortly after, however, I was joined in my stroIl by Mrs. Pemberton, who in her tasteful morning dress of pale blue looked young enough and happy enough to have been the prospective bride herself. She was evi- dently in a happy mood, and soon the conver sation drifted to the subject that was doubtless nearest to her heart that summer morning. "You have heard of our change of plan, dear Mr. Sindair, has soon as I am to lose my Evelyn t" " Yes, Mrs. Pemberton, Albert told me last night. Fortunately its won't be for long. I understand that Mr. Kingsley's place is only a couple of miles away." "Yes indeed, it is most fortunate for me. And to be the mistresa of such a house as Kingsland is a position that any mother might be proud to see her child fill." " Mise Pemberton would adorn the highest position, my dear madam." "Thank you, and I do not think I need fear our words are intended as flattery. Evelyn s a beautiful woman and a devoted daugh- ter." The poor mother's voice broke as she uttered the last low words, but the recovered herself and went on. " I do not mind saying to you, who are such a valued friend of my boy's, that Evelyn's choice has relieved my mind of a great weight. There was a time when I feared that early associations might have biassed her affections in a less favorable direction, and it is a great relief to me that it has not proved to be so. A widow left with but a poor provision for her children has a great responeibility to contend with; but, thank heaven, my troubles are nearly over, Kingsley is not only a wealthy young man, but the soul of generosity !' Her troubles nearly over! many and many a time after did those words of the unhappy mother recur to my memory. It was the twenty second of December. only one day intervened between us and Evelyn Pemberton'o wedding morn. At breakfaet that morning there was only the quartette, Mrs. Pemberton. Evelyn, Albert and myself; but both young Kingsley and Corwyn put in an early appeanrane, and plans were formed to visit Kingsland and innspect the improve- ments the young fellow had effected in honor of his bride. I excused myself from being of the party on the score of my recent iliness. and when I had seen them off strolled up the hill at the back (the same which faced the window of my room.) and throwing myself on the warm grass under a tree prepared to enjoy a dolce far niente which a hard-worked D. must of all men appreciate. I was wondering if Evelyn Pemberton had been influenced by her mother to discard Edward Corwyn for that shallow-pated lad Kingsley, when I happened to see, shinning amongst the grass near the elbow on which I I was leaning. a stud set in onyx. My eyes are, as I said before, professionaily sharp, and I reeognised it at once as one of a set worn by Corrywn on the previous evening. All at once it flashed upon me that I was under the very tree where I had witnesed the moonlight meeting, and that Corwyn's must have been the tall male figure that had formed one at the appointment. Who could have been his companion, and for what purpose had a midnight interview taken place? If for a moment I doubted the honor of Miss Pemberton and believed it possible os that the had accorded a clandestine meeting to her discarded lover. I remembered in the next that the woman I had seen return to the house was short of figure and vulgar of face and could not possibly have been her. I was going to put the stud in my pocket deter mined to say nothing about it, but let my discovery concerning it be the result of chance, when I saw the very girl who had had the midnight appointment coming from the house in the direction of the hill. An idea that Corwyn might have managed an opportunity to inform the girl of his loss made me drop the stud in the grass again and rise from the spot before she saw me. I did not go far-I only dropped on the grass behind a shady cluster of young she-oaks and watched the girl. There was no doubt of it-she was search ing for something, and at last found what she sought, and went back to her housework with a light step and, as she fancied, unobserved. My knowledge now of the fact that Corwyn was capable of a low intrigue with the servant of the woman he had once loved damned him at once in my estimation. The man that could do so was a low villain no matter how noble or gentlemanly the appearance with which he deceived a shallow world; when some hours after he sat opposite to me at dinner, with the unbroken set of onyx studs on his peron, it would not have been prudent for me to have expresed aloud my sentiments in connection with him. The following day--the twenty-third--I had almost entirely to myseiL The prospective bridegroom had been forbidden to put in an appearance again at Werrimona until the marriage ceremony had been performed. Evelyn herself was, of course, invisible, and lMrs. Pemberton full of business in preparing for the wedding breakfast and supervising hospitalities. I rambled about the hills most of the day, with Albert's gun in my posesesion, though I was not guilty of much bloodshed in consequence of carrying it, and I shared a scramble dinner with Pemberton and his mother as evening fell. Mrs. Pemberton was in high spirits, and so naturally was my friend Albert. "l'm dead tired!" the latter cried and I'll have to turn in early if I'm to face the ter- rible ceremony to-morrow morning in my fbeet bib and tucker " "We'll all have to turn in, as you call it, early; there is plenty to be done in the morning,and we most be up betimes." "I wonder what Evelyn means to allow me for this lot ? By Jove she has fine times of it hiding away in her own room while we are slaving to death! Whatever is ahe doing, mater?" "My dear, a young lady on the eve of her marriage has many things to do. She has to pack for her trip to Sydney, and to arrange her wardrobe generally. And you know Evelyn has no maid, but Milly Werner has been helping her all day." Milly Werner? was that the young dame that met Corwyn at midnight on the hill? if so. a pretty treacher- oun maid had Evelyn Pemberton; or, after, all, was it a faithful confidant ? I felt very unlike sleep that night, and knowing, the result of tumbling and tossing about on a sleepless bed for hours was likely to be, I determined not to go to bed at all until I had worn myself out sitting up. It was about eleven o'clock when I came to this conclusion, and all the house was in the most perfect stillness. I had taken a book in which I was interested into the drawing room early in the day, and the idea that I should like to finish it took possession of me. Believing that every soul in the house had retired, I took up my lamp, and making as little noise as I could, sought the drawing-room. The door was ajar, and the room in dark. ness, save near the window, through which a flood of moonlight was falling. I had taken possession of my book and was retreating, be. fore I noticed a female figure standing in a window-recess with one of the drooping lace curtains caught and held back in her hand. At the first glance I knew it was Evelyn, there was no mistaking that graceful yet majestic form. She must have heard my movements even at the moment I saw her, for she turned her face towards me quickly with a frightened air. Never can I forget that beautiful face with the whiteness of death on it, and almost the shadows of death beneath the heavy eyes. Let me try and describe her as I saw her then, before the terrible after events made a horror of the memory. She wore a half-fitting wrapper of white cashmere, with a heavy silken cord and tassels tied round her slender waiste and in loops at her left side. Her golden brown hair was gathered back in wavy and glossy masses, and fastened with a large comb behind, beneath which loops and long tresses fell down carelessy on her shoulders. Her small slender foot, as it peeped from under the cashmere skirt, showed a white silken stocking and shoe of black satin; and that was all-there was not a bit of lace at her fair neck or wrists, or a ring of gold on the perfect fingure. "I beg your pardon, Miss Pemberton," I apologised, "I am afraid I have startled you, Indeed I should not have ventured from my room if I had not believed every soul in the house abed, I came for this book." "Do not apologise," she replied gently, "I have no businees here indeed, and mamma would be very angry if she knew, but I wanted a last look." "Oh no, Miss Pemberton; though you leave home to-morrow it is only for so short a time that you will not miss it out of your life at Werrimona." "I do not know"-she returned as she shook her head sadly, "I feel a presentiment that when I leave my mother's home it will be never to return to it again." " You are nervous, my dear Miss Pemberton, and unsettled, when the sun shines on your wedding morning you will forget all this de- pression." "I hope so." Somehow I felt like lingering, though I was quite aware that good taste would have dedi cated my immediate retirement; but I had some excuse while those grand eyes lingered on me with a sad solemnity that stirred me to the soul Impulsively I advanced towards her and put some of my feelings into words. "Mias Pemberton, do not be angry ith me, I ask you to trust me a little. I feel as if there was something troubling you greatly-is .here anything in the whole world I can do for you?" "There is no one without trouble, not even a young girl like me." she ansrered steadiy. "but my trouble, if I have one, is one of my own making, and no one can help me. Thank s you all the same, dear Mr. Sinclair, some day perhaps--" Someday" I repeatei aas she paused. ' I hardly know what I was goirg to express. Ever since I looked first into your face I have felt as if there was some strange, solemn tie between us, as if one day my life, my honor or my good name would lie in your t hands A queer feeling, is it not? but I was alway a strange, dreamy girl, and never thought I would be a long liver." " God forbid that there should be any foundation for auch fears !" I cried earnestly "but if ever you place a trust in my hands I will redeem it faithfully or die!" " Thank yiu truly. And now let it be farewell-I hall not have a moment to speak to you again." She put her hand in mine as I murmured and' God bless and make you happy." and she left there while she repeated the " Farewell," , that rang in my ears for many a long day after; and so I went back to my chamber leaving her, still by the window, with the moonlight streaming on her pale face and white-robed figure. My book ws after all of no value on that night-the last that should fall on peaceful Werrimona with a shadow of content. It was far on in the small hours are I undressed, and then it was to lie and wonder at the sorrow ofl the beautiful daughter of the house, the bride of to-morrow. I slept heavily at last, to be aroused by someone trying the handle of my door as if to gain entrance without knocking. Seeing that the sun was shining brightly, I bounded from 1 my bed, threw on some garments and unlocked the door-the first glance of Mrs. Pemberton's i j while, frightened face was enough to show me that something had happened. 'Oh, for the love of God, come and help me. Mr. Sinclair"' she whirpered tremblingly, "Evelyn has gone: oh tell me, tell me what I I am to do!" " Gone; what do you mean ?" "Let me in, I don't want to let anyone I know-yet, I went to her room early, So as to get Evelyn up and ready in time, and I found that her bed had never been slept in! I have searched in the house and garden-every where! but I cannot find her; oh God what shall I do?" Has she taken anything with her? made any preparations for a journey I mean?" " Not that I can see- her wraps at all events are in her wardrobe." " Let me go to the room, and be as calm as you can my dear lady-if Miss Pemberton is lost we will find her, be assured." The poor woman led me almost blindly to ; the chamber of the lost bride, tears of terror and agony rolling over her blanched cheeks. It was a new experience to me, and a pitiful one, this entrance to a girl's chamber where all preparations had been made for her happy bridal morn. There were two beds in the apartment, and both were hung in pure white lace looped with pale blue silk On the snowy counter- pane of one of these the bridal garments were ' spread daintily-a trailing robe of white silk almost covered with rich lace, the bridal wreath, the bridal veil. All the little acces- sories to a perfect toilet lay in order, the silken hose, the while satin boots, the long white gloves, the golden and jewelled bouquet holder that had been a gift from the bride groom. The ghostly attire had, under the cireamstances, a weird look-it was as if a dead bride hads lipped from her wedding gar ments and left them to lie there in her form. I saw the mother's hands clasped in pitiful woe as she glanced at them, while I made my own observations on the state of things. It was as poor Mrs. Pemberca had said, not an article of outdoor attire was missing from Evelyn's wardrobe, and the bed was smooth and undisturbed from the hands of' the chambermaid. From what I saw I came to the conclusion that Evelyn had not visited her room after my meeting with her the previous night-I was almost certain of this, seeing that her little watch hung on its :sand i upon her dainty toilet, and that it had stopped at twelve o'clock-if the girl had returned after that hour she would have wound it. I said nothing of the meeting I had had in the drawing-room, but I asked the mother if she had any reason to suppose that Miss Pember- ton did not intend to fulfll her engagement to Mr. Kingsley " Oh no I" she cried" on the contrary, she gave me her sacred word last night ere I left : her here that she would not fail:" "Was a sacred promise necessary then 'I i asked sharply," has it been neoessary to re- mind your daughter of a vow on the eve of an unwelcome alliance? Mrs. Pembtrton, you know I am a detective, if you wish me to help you in this matter it is necessary for you to put entire confidence in me-to tell me the whole truth." "There is nothing ot tell!" she almost shrieked " my child my child !" I began to feel angry with the woman, who it seemed to me must have coerced her daugh ter into a wealthy engagement; I felt lets inclined to spare her, and related what had passed between Evelyn and myself. " There was some weight on her heart," I said, "and some terrible presentiment oppres- sing her-can you explain it Mrs. Pemberton?" "No!" she cried wildly, " I can explain nothing, only that my child has left me for ever! my Evelyn! my EvelynI" Her shrieks had arosed the household, and Albert was in the room with the servant Milly Werner. I glanced into the girl's face sharply and saw that she quailed under my eye. I drew her aside while Albert heard the sad truth from his distracted mother, and ques- tioned her. " Were you aware that Miss Pemberton had left the house?" "Me sir: how should I know of such a thing? I am not even Miss Pemberton's maid ?" " You have not answered my question-did you know that Miss Pemberton had left the house, or had any intention of leaving it last night?" "Nol" she answered brazenly" I know nothing about it! " I might find a way to refresh your memory," I said sharply. " Have you been carrying any messages between Mr. Corryn and your young mistress lately ?" " No, I havn''t "she cried asher face burned crimson. "Your comnmunications with that gentle- man were entirely on your own account then?' She grew pale as suddenly as she had flushed but answered after a moment's hesitation, "Yes, entirely on my own amount I" " Take care-I may make you prove that before you are many hours older." I heard some ejaculation like " impudence!" as I turned and took Albert from the room leaving the hysterical mother in the hands of ! the servants. Together the anxious young fellow and I searched everywhere in hope of discovering i any traces of his sister. There was no use in trying to hide from the household what had happened in the face of Mrs. Pemberton's outcries, and every servant save Milly Wernerr was helping in a search that proved to be in vain. When I saw how usless it was, it was nearly nine o'clock. " We may decide that there will be no: wedding to-day. I'm afraid Albert" I said, while we partook of a hasty meal. " It will . be better for you to ride over for Kingsley, and send messengers to all the invited guests that the wedding is postponed-your mother's sadden illness will be a sufficient excuse." " Sinclair " he returned, looking at me with I a great seriousness in his young ace," this matter will be the ruin of poor Evelyn-do you think it possible that she has run away with Corwyn?"' " I don't think that all likely, since she has gone apparently in her wrapper and slippers, but I am going over to ask him the question now." "You!" "I myself - you seem to have forgotten that I am a detective, Pemberton, who could more fittingly inquire into such a business?" "Oh, heavens, that you should speak so! What awful thing do you suspect that you should recur to your profession now?" "Be a man Pemberton. Remember how much is on your shoulders at this moment since you are the representative of a helpless mother. Go and do as I said - I will see you on my return." I went to the stables, and after having sad- dled a horse for myself, rode on my errand to the house of of Edward Corwyn. I knew where to go for the chimneys of his farmhouse were visible from some of the win- down at Werrimona. aniobad a tI ir he to om.

Young Kingsley had arriv4 and wa roaming about the house in a hei less, limp way, looking, I suppose, for hiolcel bride in crmers that had been searched a dozen times before. The men who had be?n deapstched to make engquirier in the neoih honrhood had returned with young Permh-n ton, and no diecovery had been made. My fiet inquiry was for the girl Wecner ahe was in her own room. I walked?lratlh: to it when it had been pointed out to me it war a lit:tle attic chamber-and knoeked -harply at the door. ThEre was eomo eho flinog inside, and then the girl opened the door. I pushed her bshack, went in, and lockeid the door behind me.

What had Corwyn to say to you that night you me: him on the hill, and what did he give when you returned him the stul he had lost? Come now, it will be better for you to make a clean breast of it." "I won't! see that now you may kill me and I won't I Since you know so much, go and ask Mr. Corwyn himself-you'll know nothing from me!" " Very well, until you change your mind you will remain a prioner in this room. If you have not come to your senses by to-mor. roe morning I'll cu:; you in to Werrimona lock-up." While I had been spoaking I had been ex. am ining the little window --t was imcpossible to escape from it. I took the key out of the door and she made a rush to try andescapeas I opened it. " Let me hear one bit of noise and I'll gag you," I said as I pushec her back. " I'll bing you some prison rations tuwards evening, and if you have come to your senses I'll hear what you have to say." But she said nothing. When I returned at night she was sitting on her bed w:Lh a sul len, determined look on her dark face, and would not even reply to me when I addressed her." " You have been well bribed my lady," I thought, " but the sight of the policemen Ill! give you in chargeto to-morrow will maybe loosen your tongue." I was wearied out:, body and mind, ana was asleep almost as soon as I was in bhd, and I must have dreamed almost as soon as I slept. It seemed to me that I saw E: celyn aain. as I saw her on the previous nigh', in her trailing white dress; but tee hair among which the moonbeams had rested was hanging down almost to her waist, tangled and dishevel ed. In the great eyes, too, there seemed an awful glassy stare, and the white hands seemed stretched out entreatingly towards me I I s:ruo:led myself aware as if from a night mare, and for a second of time after I opened my eyes I seemed to see the shadowy outline of a form behtween me and the window. I sat up in bed to eatelfy myself that there was nothing but space where I had imagined that shape. " I shall have a relaspe if my brain does not get a re-:," I thought, as I resolutely turned my face to the wall and shut my eyes. Just then I heard the clo:k in the hall strike twelve-it was Christmas morning, almost the same hour in whichlast night Evelyn had raid to me her last" Farewell? ' In a few moments I slept again, and again I dreamed, but this time my dream had some new features, and was peculiarly vivid. I saw Evelyn gazing at me reproachfully, and I re. called my promise as though she had then re peated it with her shadowy lips. " INever you place a trust in me I will redeem it faithfully or die; " that was my promise-had she come to claim it ? In my dream I gazed at the misty form and met the awful and glassy eyes. She seemed to stand near a window as she had done last night in the drawing room, but this window was smaller, had broken panes and tangled foliage waving long sprays outside it. Inside, too, the woodwork locked old and broken and out of the perpendicular, and the floor upon which she seemed to stand was broken and discolored. This time when I awoke in a shudder I bounded from my bed and dressed myself-I could no more have lain still after that re peated dream than if I had seen Evelyn in the flesh and she had called me to avenge her. That she had met with foul play I was con. rinced, and I went softly to Albert's room and awoke him-it was not hard to do, he started up fearing some fresh trouble awaiting him. "Albert ?" I asked. " is there anywhere in this neighborhood an old, uninhabited house, with broken windows and wild creeping plants growing around them ?" " Yes, Colonel Hussey's old houce," he answered. " why do you ask ?" "How far is it from this ?" "Under a mile." "Get up and dress yourself my friend, you I and I must go to that old house within the hour,"; and as he was dressing I told the poor fellow of my dream and all I feared that Corwyn had done. "You must be brave to meet the worst, tad," I said, " it would kill your mother to tell her the truth if it is as bad as I fear." We had provided ourselves with enadles and matches, and easily made our way into the fast decaying timber houe. I went straight toward the room that ohad the broken panes the whitefaced trembling youth following me closely. A single look at the window showed me the counterpart of what I had ceen in my dream, only that there was not even the shadow of lost Evelyn to remind me of my promise. IHolding a candle in my hand I looked round the room, and then low on the broken door for traces of feet or marks to prove my fears not unfounded. I discovered tsm; on the very spot where Evelyn had seemed to stand Corwyn's for the second time lost stud was lying, and there were spots of blood where it lay ! Without a single hope now we seearched the house vainly, until I di'covered some loose boards in the flooring of a small back apart ment in which the roof had given way and partially fallen in; the boards were lifted, and there lay the form of Evelyn I'emberton, with some folds of her stained robe covering her dead face ! When the first burst of the poor bother's horrifed eorrow was past we lifted thefair form, carried it into the best of the rooms, and laid it drcently on a table that happened to be there. We could do no more until we procured means and aesistance. We were returning in awful silence, leaving the victim of revenge alone in the ruined house behind us, when the loud neighing of a horse in the bush not far away attracted my atten tion. It was a strange neigh, hail squeal, as if the animal was in pain, and we turned our horses in the direction of the sound. We found a bay horse entangled by the bridle in some scmrub, with a broken saddle beside him near "This is Corwyn's horse 2" cried Albert, as he dismounted and released the horse, who took advantage of his liberty to scour through the brusah homeward; nor did we trouble to follow him, for his master was lying against the log in a crushed heap, evidently breathing his hkt. I stooped and raised his heavy head to my face, andas I did so he opened his eyes, fixed them on my face and knew me. "I've had my revenge you see, and all is welllI" he murmured," sihe will play no man false again I" and he was dead-almost with a smile on his murderous lips ! The story of my dream is told-let the faith less maid Werner drop out of is like the worth less thing she was. I suppose I must do her the joustice to believe that when she persuaded Evelyn to grant Ccrwyn that last meeting, she never dreamed of murder. We had un fortunately no hold on her, so she went free and out of my sight for ever. My friend Albert is master of Werrimona now, and has a family of fair children grow ing up around him. The eldest he has named "Evelyn," in memory of his lost sister, and sometimes I fancy the girl has a look in her great dreamy eyes of the murdered bride. Charley Eingoley did not break his heart, though he grieved long for Evelyn's terrible loss, n,'w there are happy children also at Kingeland that bear his name. Mrs. Pemberton is dead. If she felt remorse for inluencing her daughter to deceive the man she loved, and accept one she could nt love for the sake of his wealth, she never said so, but carried the secret of her sin with her to the grave. Excitement, rightly directed, furnishes healthy motive.-poweor to carry humanity for ward. Without excitement we should be a do ,hlergmatic, uninteresting, anprofitable
