Tho Bank of England has now about £4'J,000,000 of New South "Wales in- scribed stock on its books. For this its commission on flotation was at tho rato of /J- per cent. The Bank of New South "Wales offered to do the work for about £-0,-00, being i per cent, for tho first million of each loan fioatod, and J per cont. per million for tlie balance. Then, for inscription, it was contracted that the Bank of England should reçoive £.000 per annum per million, which, including interest, would amount to £2,198,000 in the tliirty-sovon yoars of the currency of the stock, wheroa. tho colonial bank asked onlv £400 per million annually, or, including interest, £1,462,000. Certainly on our remon- strance a year or two back the rate for inscription was reduced. But whatever the concessions allowed, the transfer of the business from the Aus- tralian to the English bnnk will ndd lo tho cost to the colony in principal and interest nt least £7')0,000. The question is has New South Wales had, or is it likely to receive, special service for this ad- ditional outlay. When tho chango was made wo expressed our doubts of the advantages that would bo derived from the new policy. In tho light of rocent transactions we have had strong confirma- tion of our opinion. We look in vain for any service rendored by the Bank of England whicli oould not have boon given equally as woll by our own leading Australian banks. AVo were led to expect t^at some prestige would attach to our securities for Ihe extra amount wo paid for the distinguished patron- age of the great British institution. Eroin close observai ion wo hnvo never boon able to soe that the colony got muí o for its loans because of tho connootioii Mi Billiiiglmrst, ot tho London and We-tmrastei Bimi», in 1880, ufc a meeting oí bankers compared the losnlts of tho Victonan issues with those of INew '»outh Wales to the clear advan tage of the fo-rner, though the outronoj was shortoi lho pooplo have geneially thought tliat the colony on its own merits was entitled to tho boat results And while the bank rendered no aorvwo in obtaining prices higher than would have been secured by the Bank ot New South Wales or any other leading bank neither wa» it instrumental in presenting the fall of our seouritios in the general deoline that took place at tho time of the crisis. It never incurred' risk on our behalf, and it rendered no special service in the time of trouble If Now South Wales securities did not fall quite so low as others, that was because of our relatively botter credit, not because wo had our Btock inseribod in the beoks of the Bank of England. Queens- land had that bank behind her, yet her stock foil as low as that of any of tho colonies. While the Bank of England has ren- dered us no special service, wo havo reason to think that so far as it is responsible for tho extended currency of tho loans it lins exposed us to a heavy loss. That bankers have somoinfluonco in determining the terms of loans is shown by Mr. Billing hurst on tho occasion mentioned, when he said, " The plan I havo always advocated, and winch, 1 am happy to say, has been adopted by moro than one colony with whoso loans I have been officially con- nected, is that the loan should be payable at a certain fixed date, say 50 years from tho date of issue, but that at tho expiration of, say, 30 years, and thereafter up to the final duo date, the Govornmont should havo the option of ropa3-ment on giving duo notice, say six or twelve months, to tho stockholders." He condemned tho issue of long-dated stock, stating that "tho result of this lengthening of the fixed timo for payraont has not been economical for the colonies." Undoubtedly ho was correct, only that ho ought to have said that tho timoot possible repayment should date, say, nineteen years from flotation -a3 Western Australia and South Australia havo 2U'°vided in their late issuos. As far as Victoria followed this advice of its banker, the results have been advantageous. Its inscribed Btock will be convertible into choaper stock at a much earlier dato than will that of this colony. Tlie advantage Mr. Billinghurst secured through his bank for Victoria, at a cost in commission one-half the amount cliargod on our loans, might surely have boon obtained for us by the Bauk of Eng- land. But this institution not only did not suggest the shortening ol' the currency of our fresh stock, but resisted as far as it could in 1888 the domand for a shorter term. Tt conceded the termina- tion of tho now 3$ por cent, stock at 1918, instead of 1924 ; and though this was a longer currency by ton years than tho Treasurer demanded, it promises a saving of over £500,000 as compared with tho amount that would havo boon payablo had tho additional 3>l Tier cent.issues, amountingto £12,826,000, boon added to tho £10,500,000 already on tho rogistor to maturo in 1924. It was no doubt more convenient to the bank, and would have saved it somo thousands sterling if it had beon allowed to put the whole amount in one set of books. Notwithstanding our warnings from Sydney, and despito the sensible ad- vice of Air. Billiughurst in London, tho bank, on tho only two occasions on which it has sinco negotiated loans on any other rogister, adopted a forty years' curronoy, in the oaso of £2,500,000 4 per cont. stock and in tho case of £4,000,000 3 per cents. The effect of issuing loans for these lengthened terms will bo to make necessary a pay- ment by tho colony of £7,000,000 in oxeess of the amount that would bo pay- ablo if they had boon negotiated in the samo way as tho loan of South Australia for ninoteon years, and then converted at 3 per cent. Of the sovon colonios, Now South Wales, Queensland, and Now -enland ornploy the Bank of England. Their charges of flotation ave heavier and their results loss satisfactory than those of colonies having other agents, for while they obtained no moro for their loans, they, being all long-dated, are the most romotoly removed from the economy of conversion to the lower rate of interost now current. If, then, the Bank of England has not rendered the colony special service what can bo said for the arrangement ? Wo have no wish to seo thoso who render tho colony service less liberally remunerated than others iu like position, nor do wo consider that only colonial in- stitutions or manufacturers should be em- ployed when others can perform the service ¡is satisfactorily and more economically. But we think some justification is needed in the oirenmstances for tho continued employment of the Bank of England. Tho unusual step of reopening the Parliamentary Inquiry into tho Jameson raid, if it was taken in the interests of Mr. Chamberlain's reputation, can hurdly bo said to havo thoroughly fulfilled its object. Our cables on the subject disclose a thrco-cornered situation-with the Secre- tary for the Colonies at one ansie, Mr. Rhodes and those who acted with him at tho second, and Miss Elora Shaw, of the " Times," at the third. No one of the three comes altogether unscathed out of the inquiry, but, briefly speaking, what we aro asked to believe is,-firstly, thatMr.Rhodos had in mind an interference in the affairs of the Hand ; secondly, that Mr. Chamberlain waa closely informed of tho progress of events but had no inkling of the raid as it took place ; and thirdly, that Miss Flora Shaw " during her holiday musings," as she described it, divined and forest)w what actually took placo. So far as Mr. Ehodes is concerned, ho may now be lett out of tho consideration since ¡lis admiasions before tho committee of inquiry. But thero seems n good deal of rooson to believe that the position of Mr. Chamberlain is not altogether satisfactory, although no ono is disposed to question the good faith of his denial of any fore- knowledge of what took placo on the Rand. What wo can gather from tho results of tho inquiry is, among other things, that Miss Shaw had special reason to believo that Mr. Ohainborlnin wished the rising to take placo immediately, because she cabled to Mr. Rhodes to that effect about a fortnight befoio the raid took place. Then the Rhodes cables to Miss Shaw evidently show that he looked upon her as an inter- mediary between himself und Mr. Cham- berlain,-'. Inform Chamberlain that, 1 can got through all right if ho supports mo," and tho other reforring to Lord Rosmead. It also seoms to bo clear onough that those who organised the larnontablo operation on tho Rand be liovod that through Miss Shaw thoy hud succeeded iu influenc- ing public opinion in England through the journal which employed that lady's soi vices. It does not follow, of course, that nil or any of these assump- tions aro true. Indeed, thoy aro each specifically denied. "Wo are bound to accept those dennis, however much the}» may leato unex- plained and luexphoable, and espouiall> that given in such decided toim3 by Mr Chamberlain Tho situation m lus rase was described by a lending London daily as piquant and pauidoxicnl to tho last degroo, but terms liko thoso hardly go far enough if any loom ia left to doubt tho genuineness of the Colonial S°rretar",'s, uisclaimei Tho situation is most sonous Gient Britain ti is at peace tilth tho Transvaal, and the Boci Go,oinment enjoyed certain lights undet tieaty, jet a Butish oolomal loree mtaded the ten 1 toiy in arms, was doteated with loss of life, its action was roprobated by tho British Government, and the surviving leaders woro imprisoned. If it could bo shown for a momont in tho face of nil this that the Minister charged with tho direotion of colonial affairs had any knowlodgo, much less a sympathetic knowlodgo, of whnt was intended, and what Miss Shaw divined in hor holiday musings about five months before, he would by the fact bo rendered impossible in British public lifo for the future. Opinions may differ about tho action of the Boera, about the justico of their restrictions on Europeans, and about the thousand-and- one other points that have beenraised in connootion with this matter. But on ono point all aroagroed, and this tho Lord Chief Justico gave expres- sion to nt the trial when he oharaoterisod the notion of the raidera as a breach of in- ternational law. So far the culpability of th.it act has boon limited to its humbler agents. But had the Socrotary for tho Colonies been compromised the British Government itself would hnvo beou in- volved in tile discredit of a procedure on which tho criminal tribunals o£ tho country havo already pronounced a decision. Tho position of a British Minister implicated in such a responsibility would, it is needless to say, have been untonable for au instant. Uenoo Mr. Chamberlain felt himself callod on to dony, in -plain and definite terms boforo the Parliamentary Committee, that ho lind the slightest sus- picion of anything in tho nature of a hos- tile or armed iuvnsion of tho Transvaal. It is nt this point that Miss Shaw comos significantly on tho scone. "During the first sittings of the committee it was mado npparont that this lady was in the confidence of Mr. Tihodos and his friends and in froquont communication with the Colonial Office, tho reopening of the inquiry being the result of n desire to find out what light she could throw on the position of Mr. Chamberlain. So far as our cabled information goos, it is not conclusivo either way, and the explanation that Miss Shaw's assurance of Mr. Chamborlain's "soundness" on the matter and of his desire for an early rising was glooned from the late Mr. Fairfield is not ns satisfactory as it might bo, and will hardly have ploasod Mr. Rhodes. AVhat is known from the evidence, however, is that Miss Shaw was told by Dr. Harris in September, 1895-that is, about throe month's boforo the raid-that the "exces- sive gathering" of Chartered Company's troops in Bechunnaland was for the pur pope of oo-operating under Dr. Jameson with a revolt at Johannesburg. It was expected to be a bloodless revolt, wo aro told, but it ii significantly added that nothing was absolutely certain- except, indeed, tho fact that the troops were gathered in forco on the border. Theso are tho facts as they bocamo known to the lady journalist through tho medium of her holiday musings, confirmod and amplified by Dr. Harris. It does not appoar from Mr. Chamberlain's denials that ho was uuawaro of thoso things, whilo it is clear that a rising in the Trans- vaal was anticipated by nt least one of tho Colonial Office officials. Tho Colonial Secretary has denied any fore- knowledge of the raid, but he has not denied knowledge of the prosonco of this force on the frontier ready to co-operate in tho rising. So that thero are still two questions concerning persons which re- main unanswered. One concerns tho sudden disappearance of that wido-awako faculty with which Mr. Chamberlain is usually credited, and which for this occasion seems to have trans foired itself to the lady who writes for the " Times." The other question concerns that lady herself, who claims to havo acted in the interests of journalism in all she did. Journnlists havo boen trusted with, and have disoovorod, impor- tant secrets of State before now, and the test question ns to whether they acted in tho interests of their nowspapors or in somo other interest has reference to tho use modo of their part in tho proceed- ings. In this caso it would seem that Mr. Rhodes and his friends made, or thought they made, the be3t use of tho lady's services. Information on either of these two points will bo interesting when it comes ; and if the lady journalist lins erred, it will probably havebeon due to tho nnfnmilinrity of her sex with the weightier responsibilities of journalism. The glorious uncertainty of the law is once more illustrated by the result of the resort to the Court of Appeal in England in respect to a caso parallel to that of Hawke v. Dunn upon which tho decision of Mr. Justino Hawkins was given declaring cash betting on racecourses to be illegal. Tho Court of Appeal, by a majority of five to ono, practically re versos the decision of that lonrned Judge, and cash betting may now again proceed in a highly prosperous way as tho result of the attention that has been drawn to it and the priceless adyerrisement it has received. So far as the offect on tho law in this colony is concerned, our Supreme Court some time ago gavo a judgment which made tho English decision offoctivo hore, and it is to be presumed that some courso will have to be taken to similarly give effect to tho judgmont on appeal. When tho proceedings were ini- tiated which led to tho reference to the Court of Appeal tho iutontion was ox pressed of taking the judgment of the highest Court of nppoUato jurisdiction. That Conrt is the House of Lords, which, if the question is brought before it, may overrule tho Conrt of Appeal and affirm the law in the sonso in which it was stated by Mr. Justice Hawkins. These agreeable changes must ndd much to tho diversity and the picturesque intorost of the bookmaker's occupation, as ho finds himsolf declared one day to be a gravo offender against tho law and tho next day to be mombor of a respectable vocation, and to bo exeroising his legiti- mate rights as a citizen.

A. Dibbs, will to-day complete his 50th year of service in the bank, and the officers of the institution, in order to commemorate the event, have determined to present to him portraits in oils of himself and Mrs. Dibbs to- gether with an address. So many of the officers in the country have signified their desire to attend the presentation that the committee has asked Mr. Dibbs to acquiesce in the proposal that the ceremony should take place on 2nd August, the first bank holiday. To this course Mr. Dibbs has consented. The directors will be amongst those present at the ceremony, which will take place on the day mentioncd, at 10.30 a.m., in the bank. Mr. Dibbs has invited the entire staff to Graythwaite, his residence at North Sydney, on the same day, and thus the directors will have an opportunity of meeting many of their officers. The popular general manager first entered the service of the bank as a junior at the age of 14 1/2 years in 1847 In 1858 he became an accountant, and in the year 1867 attained to the position of general manager, which he has retained since that time. This fact alone, apart from the general esteem in which Mr. Dibbs is held, speaks volumes for his financial abilities, and the confi- dence reposed in him by the directors. Mr. Dibbs is to be congratulated on his very unusual record of 50 years' service in one institution, the success of which in later years has been due in no small extent to Mr. Dibbs himself.
