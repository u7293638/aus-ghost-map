The Sea Ghost -was in charge of Captain Kols- ' 'horn, and was manned by half a dozen natives, ob- _ fained in the Bismarck Archipelago. The cutter.~ had "set out from New Britain on a trading cruise, flying the German flag, and Buka was the first: 'place of call. The Sea Ghost was coming to an anchorage, when the natives swarmed aboard. They seemed friendly, and wanted to do some trade with copra. Captain Kolshorn was in the, rigging, on the lookout for reefs, and when he descended the natives attacked him. Being un armed, he could not defend himself, and he andt four of his crew were butchered. The vessel was run ashore, looted, and destroyed, and the cap- . tain's body thrown overboard; whilo-cannibalistic ' orgies were indulged in over the . bodies of the four natives. A report of the massacre has been/ sent to the captain pf the German warship Falke, and a punitive expedition will shortly be sent to " the scene, which lies off the north-east end of Bougainville. . .- -
