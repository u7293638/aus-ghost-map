THE MOST MYSTERIOUS THING IN THE WORLD. There is no plaoe in the world more full of mystery, whioh is one form ef delight, than a wall-ordered laboratory. A woman's heart is fall of mystery ; but even when one has it— surrendered at dis tortion and given up— in one's own onstody it is so very, very hard to read. A cuneiform, a Hittite inscription, is as legioie. t A factory with its steam-engine and 00m plioated wheels abd whirr is full of mystery, but of a kind jrhioh makes the beholders wonder and utter vague commonplaces about the ingenuity of man. A studio with pictures in various stages of advancement, from the portrait whioh is as yet a mere ghost in chalk to the finished agate; with bits of tapestry; witha gallery of oarved wood ; with armour, spear-heads, B!'™- mirrors, costumes, and properties of all kinds, is foil of mystery. Bat & chemical laboratory, . with its bottles, retorts, crucibles, soaiee coder glass, blowpipes, glass rods, glass oilin pestle and mortar, and its strange smells, is the moat mysterious thing in the whole world. — Walter Buant.
