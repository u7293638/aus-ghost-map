PBOPLE'S CONCEBTS. TO TH zDIMro or F THE IEBCUT. DaEa SBi,-Allow me a space in your -alnable columns to say a few words upon -what I witnessed last Saturday evening. Mvin occasien to walk through Fitzroy I noticed some .long, showy bills, which in formed me that an entertainment, or People's Concert was to be held in the Fitzroy Town Hall. I, therefore, ventured to go to witness all I saw in print. To a certain extent I was not disappointed. But drasing towards the close the pianiste, thinking the time had expired, and all had been gone through, closed the proceedings with the National Anthem. This raised a confusion amongst the Collingwood and Fitzroy lads, who reckoned upon having the grand negro burlesque, until some young gentleman (having no connection with the _management) very kindly made an apology, which was followed by a sort of burlesque, lasting about five minutes. During that time, the ghost, who also occupied a part, hsi, perhaps, been indulging too much, leaned against a number of high boards ased to protect the performers, which at enu? overbalanced and fell, causing rare inn amongst the boys, who wound up their evening's amusement by repeated groans. If the management of these popular concerts were to adopt the plan of lowering their prices, and have sufficient number of per formers in different professions, also a chair man, they might rely upon a good, ap ~reciative audience, and all would go on smoothly. Let me trust that the residents of Fitzroy and Collingwood will be no more imposed upon in that manner. OBSERVER.
