PORTFOLIO. WHIT-SUNDAY. " And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance;" that is theyspoke several languages besides their own mother tongue, or, as it is ex pressed in our Saviour's promise to the apostles, " with new tongues." The mir acle was of that nature that the like was never known in the world, neither before nor since the first ages of Christianity, upon any occasion whatsoever. Nor can we imagine any other sort of miracle that could probably affect men more, and strike them with greater wonder and admira tion; there being a more sensible demon stration of a divine power and presence accompanying the apostles than to see and hear thenl all on the sudden perfectly to speak so many languages which they had never learned before. Consider the great usefulness of this miraculous gift for the more easy and speedy consequence of the doctrine of Christianity, and the diffusing and spreadins the knowledge-of it in the world; and this not as a miracle, but only as a means, so that the Gospel. made a greater progress in the space of a few years than, in human probability, would have been made without it in many ages. We ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we fall away either hy infidelity or impiety of lifei for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, that is if dis obedience to the law of M?oses was so severely punished, and every transgres sion and disobedience received a just re compense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation I which was at first spoken by the Lord and was con firmed afterwards by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, bath with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost--.rdhbishop Tillot ,L.
