PUNCH'S SHAKSPERIAN EXTRACTS, No. 2. COLONIAL EDITION. HAMLET......HIGN-B----M. GHOST......SIR C. D—G. Time: Midnight. Scene: The ATTORNEY GENERAL'S private apart- ments in the Grown Law Offices. Enter the Ghost of SIR C. D-----G. SIR C. D-----G.—"I'm thy" late Gov'nor's "spirit;" he, I wot, Who thro' your bad advice hath GONE TO POT, And who is now "doomed for a certain term" To burn his candles, tallow, 'stead of sperm. "To walk the night," a second time be(k)nighted, "And for the day, confined," by duns affrighted. Reduced by trouble to a perfect lath, And forced by penury to GO TO BATH, "Until the" blunders I've "done in my day" By "fasting" oft "are burnt and purged away." And, "but that I'm forbidden to reveal" (But pooh ! 'twere vain to tell THEE all I feel, For though to place and pay through me you've stuck, You're not the man—now I am out of luck, And scarce have got a single blessed sou— To spare for poor old CHARLES a pound or two)— "I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul," make thy blood curd, "Make thy two" goggle "eyes start from their spheres," And, like MAC'S bristles, "stand on end" thy hairs (Those well combed locks with scented oil that shine) "Like quills upon the fretful porcupine." "But this eternal blazon" of my woes Would call for sympathy from e'en my foes; You know that when they fix the blame on you, They only state a fact that's really true. So since you cannot rob the public purse, And things with me are daily getting worse-- Make up the sum among you, and thus prove "That you did ever your dear" Gov'nor "love."
