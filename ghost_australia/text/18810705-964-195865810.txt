i Woman's Sermon. : 'Perhaps I ought to have called it an address. She was not much of a speaker, but she was mad that night,''and tired of - hearing about the shortcomings of her sex. The subject hid been about the woman spoken of in the Gtispels, and everybody had thrown a stone, ,a»fl, then she began— " Yes, ' There wag a woman taken in adultery/ my friends. Tou will note that it was a woman. But who was the other party i ^lijapi^ life^lield,; tod'i^lb:;;? Biat they toot V poian didn't escape; and ; gopd care foat e^ryonewhoJ s , .

" That's the sort of hero he was: awfully brave when , there- was no enemy in sight; gave 1 up without firing a eho.t,; and then, when he wa® brought : to book, put ajl the blame upon a poor weak defenceless /woman. But then, you bnow, he was the strongest, and they always ! win: . thp jve^k ' go to the wall. But, my frienfis, waB she weak"? No ! it was the strength of her love that shielded him. And that is the place where wo'mah'B weakness ever 'shows itself : in, Jheir great unselflsh love; and in that they axe higher and purer than man; and because of that, when they , fall it is from a greater height of purity*to-a lower depth of misery. But they blame no one else; they hear it alone. Gt-od help them! " And as it was in those days so it is now, ' we always catch the woman, and we hold her tight: that is, in the grip of our contempt. Piassing her in the street, we pull our dress aside, lest we should touch the garment of a thing so foul as a fallen woman! But where is- he who helped her down from the high pedestal of her virtue ? In our drawing rooms, flattered and caressed by the purest, and fairest daughters of the land; riding in our carriages, holding a seat in Parliament, sitting on the judgment seat condemning the wrecks they helped to. founder. My G-od! it makes one's blood run cold to tbink of it. And this is society! " And the poor shivering wretches, with a nobility of soul and a proud endurance, only known to woman: with a fidelity few can ever break, with a whiter soul in the sight of God than his (let the world's opinion be what it may) pass-by in the dark, and look up at the brightness and curBe their birth. Ah, they look out of a darkness, darker than this world's night, because to some it never knows a dawning ; and the tears of a bitter sorrow steal down their cheeks, and the poor imploring eyes look up as if the cry was ever in their souls, 'Have you no pity?' and you ? you pass them by, and the' crowd tramp over them (as it were with hob-nailed boots) tearing their naked hearts. " And a time comes when they get tired of crying, and of locking for a little love, and human pity that never comes; and hope flees away, and—^tremble while you think of it, you that aided in putting them were they are-—they go down, down, into a deeper darkness, into a lower depth of degradation, and, by-and-by, the coma' of death overpowers them ; and, cast out, helpless, forsaken, shunned, cursed by God, man, and themselves, they go to sleep, to awake in the blackness of darkness for ever. And they have to thank man for it." THE members of the Myrtle Lodge gave an entertainment to a large audience last Saturday night in the Oddfellows' Hall. The programme which was a long one wasjwell carried out. Mr. E. Honnslow occupied the chair. Recitations were admirably given by Messrs. Dunsfcan and T. Peirce, addresses on Temperance by the Rev. Burns and the Chairman, comic songs by Messrs. R. L.' O'Sullivan and Hamilton, ballads by' Messrs. Day and two other gentlemen friends, and a most successful entertainment concluded with a very laughable sketch entitled "Toby and the Ghost," in which the various characters were undertaken by Messrs. Nairne, O'Sullivan, and Hamilton in a capital style, Mr. Nairne as the frightened and impetuous nigger exerting himself greatly to please the audience. Mr, Hamilton acted as pianist.
