Confirmation. i On Sunday the Right Reverend Doctor Poldirig administered the sacrament of con firmation to between sixty and se'yenty of the artliliprs of the 17th Retriment.- now on the eve of departure for India. ! The Bishop, robed in his full, pontificuls, addressed those who were about to be con firmed, and explained to them the nature of the sacrament, and the true dispositions they ought to receive it in, and exhorted them 'to shew by their future lives, that' they had become true soldiers of Christ. * He then extended his hands over them, and. prayed that the gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend upon them, and anointed in the form of the_ cross the .forehead of each. We could not but be much pleased with tlie solemnity of the ceremony, and the demeanour of the soldiers, who have, 'we, understand, been most attentive to their religious duties preparatory to leaving, this Country, and much credit is due to their eS^MnclRfy^^Ue^ll^V0^1^!6^81^^ tions rendered to them by the Clergy. . . Wehave of;en heard it said, that ' tlie ? better the Christian, the better the soldier, -? and have no doubt of its truth ; for a man wlio goes into the battle field; in the peace of his Maker, cannot have the dread;or 'death staring him in the face, but advances boldly to meet the enemies of his country, feeling confident that if hefalls; he falls dbing'his duty both to God and his country. This is the first confirmation -or imposi tion of hands that has been performed in New South \V ales, none but a Bishop hav ing the power to give it.â€” From a Corres pondent.
