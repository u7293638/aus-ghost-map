.?? cricked ; i ? CRICKET GOSSIP- ; ! ??.:..-? '? ' ? - By Point. . .. -.-. . .' :,--?, The defeat of the AuBtralian Eleven by tho fifteen of New South Wales .is riot: a matter that need occasion any,' yery great surprise. They played within three daysjof: their arrival, after a. month's . sea. voyage : that in itself would be a sufficient excuse. But, in addition, it must be remembered that in reaching Sydney all of them. had[ to all intents and purposeaj reached - home. Ihey had done Ihoir work, and were! pro* bably much more inolined to take their ease and enjoy tho pleasure of being made heroes of than to buckle- to at a hard fight at once. What they would have done had they 'bebn a few days longer. on, shore before commenc ing the : matoh their batting performance ;in the second innings showed. That they were all abroad the first day is very evident from the number of batohes ' missed by them. When I said they wore all abroad I should certainly have, omitted Blaokham, who kept wioket nearly all day^- and /whilst 260 runs were made, and without a long- stop— not allowing a single bye; This can only be charaoterised. as a wonderful' performaneo. and quite justifies those English critios; who assert that he is without a compeer. The remarkable aooident to Bailey,' too, must have had a very depressing effect upon' the Eleven. It is hard luck .for him that ho should not bo enabled' to take part, in the winding' up of an enterprise with which he has been so creditably oonneoted throughout, and it is a great pity that we in Sydney and Melbourne should nob have been enabled to see the peirfeofc team, and especially his o\it fielding, which has'been-Bp ofien' roferred !to in' terms : of commendatipn ? by the English Dress. T,t he had been- gFaying there' laho telling how tho' matoh might have gorio, for Burrows, fielding substitute, miseod Eyana at the beginning of his ihningS j : and had that chanco been takon it ia more than likely thetotal would haro, been kept' witbin; r reasonable limit. He might have come off, too, with the bat, first inning's, * as he 'and other members of . the Eleven; so tif teri -did in England, and tiirned a. collapse into1 a creditable display ; and there :is . little doubb if he and Sponorth, or the' latter alone, had been able to bat second innings they would have made a draw of the match. 'Spoflorth'a illness by-thb-byo must have been of a very sudden character.' Glonrlv. the hick W/ih against the Eleven throughout. When they come down here they will probably show their true form, and it is quite evident if-th'ey do, with luck evenly balanced, they will make matters uncommonly sultry for the Victorian fifteen. Their batting last. Monday must have been of the highest order, and, 1 should imagine, is about the finest performance ever Been in Sydney. That of tbe fifteen, Wo, must have been very good indeed, bnt there can be no doubt, had the Eleven been in thdir fielding form, the total would hot have been anything like what it was. Evania was by no means successful with the ball j'b'nt Tindall came off, getting six wickets first innings and four second, the six costing 26 runs only. . '? ?' ' ? .;. ' ' The American and Canadian, papers have some original remarks upon the play in the ~ matches contested by the Australians. , We learn from the A/civ York HeraU that at Ne'w York, 'on fcho Hnvfinth- nxrar C. Rnnnnnnin got a ball, a driver, which was well fielded by Greig.' At Montreal, ' Gordon then/took the bat, and soon let out in a bountiful straight daisy cropper for. 3 off Allah. After some sharp play Gordon made a fine drive to square*lcg, but Bailey's hands were there at the same time,- and Gordon re* tired. . . Stancliffe at tho bat played SpofForth with groat oare, making one- fine heavy forward play that was beautifully fielded by the bowler.' The Philadelphia Times calls Allan ' tho eccentric left-handed man,' and has its paragraphs beaded, 'How the Newhalls hit the Demon, ' 'The Australians do a little muffing,' nnd so forth. At Montreal we learn that 'I)aw8on was re called, and tried the batters with that iininor. tal and old-fasnloned stand-by— 'lobs' 'The Toronto Mail in iucliuod to be personal, for we find that 'Adams, who was destined to make top score, joined Powell, and the bril liancy of his jersey evidently disconcerte'd the Auatvalian bowlers, . ; ' , and now Greek mot Greek.' Kennedy, of Hamilton, in choicely colored cap nndhoseof satanic black and yellow, faced the demon bowler.' The same journal, aftor describing the position taken in tho field by various of 'the twenty two, says 'aiid the others artistically Bcat tered along the boundary lines,' reminding one of the famous muff match on the Melbourne ground years ago when the captain directed the field thus, ' Now boys, scatter round.' The Mail also iuforms'U8 thatTMurdoqk ' was then ehofc by a nasty one from Logani' meaning thoroby that he was- bowled. Also that when time was called Horan waa etyi thore, ' imniovableas the rock of Gibraltar^' rl'hcj43neriijanC'ric/i'e-fir,aPhiladelpbiaweekiy devoted exclusively to fiicket,.says of the Eleven :-^-' Leaving AuBtralia at. the end of their summer, they euchred the revolving seouonBj aiid enjoyed' a long summer in Eng land. They are now in the mok of time for tho 'Iudianaummor' in America, and they willreturn to Anatrnlia at thobeginningof still another succesBiro summer season.'

' .!?).- t: Considerable, interest was centred . in . the , taeoting of. the East Melbourne and. South 'Melbourne last Saturday, as each had P°* jishcd off the M.C.C.

In batting they are fairly tfaong, and aa a fielding Bide could not well Jbe, surpassed, but in bowling they are very deficient. For this latter reason it is to be '.regretted that Mi;. P.

In ftho early part of the day there wore about, 2000 persons present, but a3 the day wore on , cab's and .'busbs1 crowded rolled, up every few, minutes, and by four o'clock there must have been an, altqndance of fully .9000, a ? number which, bowovor, did not come up to what was anticipated; The sky was a little overcast at first,1 but' later on it cleared, and' the weather, for''i;th'e ' remainder of the day' was, simply perfect for lorickot,' the, : heat ., being, tem pered, by a. .gentle wind from ' the Bouth, The grand stand 'was well patronised; and looked brilliant1; with ' the beautiful; variety of ' dolors of the ladies' costumes., I regret^ryinudh to' Bay that the only accident which |has occurred to any of us since, the formation of the team happened to Bailey during the afternoon. In returning a ball from :cover-pqin^ he somehow or other mau aged to Break his. arin above the .elbp'|ff.' Some, time botoro, this Bad occurrence ; ho had felt a pain in, the samo arm, and had tied his handker chief round it, and this, in the opinion : of Dra. F ortescub and Warren, who : attended ; to him, helped,to cause the break, .Bailey, poor ^follow, had done a lot of hard work as an outfield all through our English tour,, and more than, once had spoken about a pain in his arm, but little did he or any of us' think that it would lead up to such ! a fead mishap. It threw quite, a gloom over our fellows, and, indeed, over allthei ppeq tators, and took all the spirit and life out of our (play for tho rest of tho day. I boliovein the : history of cricket that not more than two, or three accidents of this.natureho.vetakenpla.ee. Grq gory won. tho toss from Powell, the captain of ? the fifteen, and sent'. them in, much to tho sur prise o£ many 'Cricketers present, for .the wickot was all that a batsman could wish, for^ The reason ; we; ;:did' not go in to bat is -that, having' been accustomed - to the subdued English light, our sights of tho ball was very much' affected ?- by ithestronpf Aus tralian glare, and it was thought by most o£ us that. a good' day's work in the field might assist very much in setting us right in 'this .respect. As an evidence of this dimness of vision, I may say that our fielding throughout was very poor in : deed, worse .than any we have yet shown eithor in England, America or Australia. ? Young' Banner man, whose brilliant fielding brought down, the house in tho old country, made several mistakes, and: four or five besides him missed- easy cuance?, Blackham was: the .only exception, hia form be hind the sticks the whole day long being well worthy his groat reputation. He dispensed! with the services of long-stop, and despite that ho . had to take tho demon's cannon shots not a single bye was recorded. Nor was our bowling up to first-clasB form. Spofforlh had no luck, and lost hia /wind after half a dozen overs, and Allan sent down half volleys and full tosses so of ten as to highly delight tho liatamen; 'Boyle 'bowled vory well, but with bad luck, and Qarrett seemed to trundle without any spirit; Horan tried a few overs, and they only served to increase the re. cord. I do not mention all .this1 in any way to disparage tho : batting shown by our opponents. 1 think a better display all round with the willow has never before been made by a Now South Wales or. any othor Australian fifteen, aridthal isnayingli good* dealj ^^Thomp' eon fell to Spoffdrth when two runB only had been made, but Shoridanand Massie Bent 40 up'beforo the fall of the second: wickot. Tho innings of tho former for 41 wajs tho.foaturo of the, day. He never showed hotter form, and seemed at homo from the start. ' 'His cutting was1 very neat and effective, and bis driving was in keeping, and not the ghost of a chanco ban bd urged against him, for every ball was sent all along the carpet*' Next to him in point! of merit comes Allen with 871 He is one of the most promising cricketers in New South Wales, and bats in a style resembling that of young M'Doncell, of the;Melbourne,Olub. He is rather weak oh1 the log, but is all there on the off, bis cutting and driving being Al. , Allen will be remembered by the Grammar School boys in. Melbqume; for having given them, a leather .hunting when, ho, scored Ii5, not out, against Ithem oiiih'i Melbourne ground some' time 'ago in their matoh' , with the Sydney Grammar School. Davis, another. ' colt, showed fair cricket for 32. He' '.] plays a very steady game, and will not hit at a straight ball. A glance at the score sheet will show that the infu sion of colt blood in tho team lias not weakonqd it in any way. ? Massie' played a very good innings for,. 27, and the manner in which be smote our bowlers' on'the off Bide was a treat to witness. He, I think, will. play with us, in lieu of poor Bailey in the Melbourne match. His style will please tho public there. Greg6ry- though he gave an easy chance td Hqran/and niade three or four fluky hits, played a sound vigdrpus innings for 89, and was. splendidly caught at mid-off by A; Bannorman. ,Wiien play ceased at six, o'clock 260 was up on the board with only tenv wickets down, so that at present it looks no certainty for us, ; jt was about half-past twelve when wo took our places in, the field i and presently the. votoran Nat -Thompson, with Massie came forth from the pavilion^ to face the -bowling :i of , Spoiforth -and Allan. .The demon sent-, down a maiden to Nat, and two ;i- singles , resulted ; ; in Allan's first qv.or; but before another run was added a wily one from SpofTorth sold Nat, and clean bowled him.-. 1—1—2. Sheridan came next, and a good, stand' was made. Runs came 'very slowly at first/, but Massie' soon, opened hiB shoulders, arid drove the bowler of a century in fine style to Iong- offf.or.a.quartoUe. , Ho followed this up ,by sending the same truhdler to square leg for a like, number,; and a couple of ? doubles and a singlo- 'haviniy been 'added;'- Allan was shunted in fdvor dr Garrett. Sheridan' drove Spofforth all along the carpet 'to, long'Off for 41, and 20 was, hoisted. Four more to, Massie off Spofforth for a straight hit, and this contribution with singles and a double to Sheridan sent 30 in sight. Horan now misfielded a drive by Massie off Garrott, 'and '4- rubs' resnUea^,- Spofforth changed ends, and Boyle took , Garrett^ place, and when 40 'appeared on the telegraph a separa tion was effected by a wind-jammer from the demon dislqclgingi Massiq's leg stump. 2 — 27— 42\.

He was very warmly applauded., Fouc^tdr 100. Powell soon' caraq to grief, a breakbabk from the demon, who had just taken Garrett's placo) prov ing too good for him;' 5—1^105.

The batsman was satisfied, but. the public did not appear to be. Davis joined Geary, wiio immediately gave Alick Bannerman another easy chance and, as oh the first instance, the ball dropped to the ground. - Geary drove Spofforth to long-on for a quartette, but soon afterwards was eerit to the right-about by Boyle,' who had taken the leather from Allan. 7 — 18—146.

'Davis' hit a full 'toss from Allan to the grand stand fence, for fdnr, but next bajl was smartly stumped: by Blackham, and had to retiro with 82.to his credit, made by very.

He1 also' hit Gar rett to leg for a quartette, and .20.0 went, up on tho board amidst cheers from all parts of the ground. Changes of bowling wore' tried, but without bringing about a separation, arid princi pally through tho hard and vigorous vit'tirig of E. Gregory 230 followed 220 on the board/ Horan, ab mid-off, close in, missed an easy chance from Gregoryoff Garrett; but it didn't gain the' bats- iman much',' fpr two or three overs later he! was splendidly caught by A.

Evans now opened his shoulders, and drove Spofforth tp! lonle-bn for 4', and hit him to leg for alike number, and 250 went up on the register. More changes of bowU ing were tried.;, but without effect, and. when the stumps wore drawn -at' six o'clock the score stood at 261 for ten wickets, Evans being (not out) 42, and Tindall (not out) 4. ? Doubtless wq shall have.300 to go against, bat on the really splendid wickot we ought to bo good enough for that number. Throughout tho day not ono ball got breast high, and, save an occasional ball, our bowlers got none of that screw on which proved so'destructive on' the slow grounds of the moth' ei country, Spofforth so far has get four wickots for 112 runs off 200 balls, Boyle two for 34, Gar^ rott 1 for 40,' and Allan two for 54. I may add that.all our. joints aro stiff and soroand pur hands blistered from having, practised so. hard for the' last two or throe days after a month's rest at sea.

I think for really beautiful cricket his was 'the innings of the match. Horan filled the vacancy, and when two or three runs, were added an adjournment was-: made for luncheon. On re suming Bannorman was' soon got rid of, Tindall catching him' splendidly off Crane at short-leg, close in, off, a 7ery hard hit; 3-24—88. The stone waller kept up liis reputation for steady defensive play/ having taken over two hours to compose his Bcore. lilackbamand Horan were bowi together, and these two Victorians made a long'stand. The former play«d Crane past point far a brace and a single, while his ; partner re peated'. tho dose in tbo same bowler's next over, 'I'he century, waa hoisted, and then Horan made a grand square-leg' bit for five off Geary over the heads of the spectatprs on the grand stand.
