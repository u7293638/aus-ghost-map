COR i IIESiO' IPENCE. TIi:E SoiriTHIERN MAILS. (T7 the /'litl, f The G'ippst?nd Times.) in,-T do not knowll that I may be, un necessarily, raising a ghost, but I would re qullet youl to Itt the advertisemlent for manil ctntracts to Smoth Gippisland. Tenders are c:lled for mail services from RoIedalo to Port Allert rit Yarramt, ete., hy covered convey ance (i.e., by coachl) ix days. a week. They have now only a thrice a week horso mail by thisisnute. Tenlers are als required for ser vice frsom Sale to Potrt Albert with branch coach, etc., six days a; week. It i siuggested, and I think with snoe degree of reason, that this really mtanso an orl/rc'tlire tender, as it is harlly likely that the deipartment woull go in for a daily imail frot Rosedale to the Port, and also a daily iail from Sale. which wouldl lie twelve mails a week. It may be that they do not ce this*,loint, uot, to mymind, there it the danger existing that the Itlosed.ld linle slihtl low accepted, and it might le direct-ed that tile mails should come there from Sale in the morning and be forwarded thoence. This wiuhId, of cotsie, lint Sale a step Iblckward, and so is worth noting by our town.eoplle. I would recilnlllunld ouir Ctlommercial Asnciation to exmtuine into this matter iso as to satisfy tlhemt eli'ci as tr the existence of any real danger.- Yours. etc., A BUSINESS MAN. 22nd Feb., 18s7.
