..:?TiE OLD CiAitEliDRAL ORGANIST. 'Tis forty years ago. since first 1 climbed these dusty, winding stairs,--" -To play the Dean in: how.I spurned lleneath my feet all meatier cares. Wheih first I leant, mly cheek on fire, Andlooked down blushing at the choir. Handel, and Hiaydn, and Mozart I thought they watched me as'I played; WYhile l'aleatrina's stern, sad Fane Seemed in the twilight to upbraid; Pale fingers moved upon the kerys eThe ghost.hands of past ccnturies. Behind my oaken battlement Above the door I used to lean, ' And watch, in pufling crimson hood, Come stately sailing in the Dan ; On this, the organ, Ireathing low, B:egian to murnmur soft and blow. S1.used to'shut'my eyes, and hear -? Tho solemn'prophecy and psalm 'Riss up like incense; and I loved Slefore :he prayerthe lull and calm, Till like the struem that bursts its banks,. Broke forth brase Putcell's "0 give Thanks?.' I know those thirteen hundr'ed pipes And thirty-stops- as blind'men do The voices of the friends they love, The bird's song, and the thutinder too; And the fierce dispasotn's roar, Like storms upon d rocky shore, -And now to-day I yield me up; The'duk7y seat, my old loved throne, Unto another,. and nomuores Shall cote'l;'dro fh the dusk alone, Or in the early m?ntin hour,.. To'hear my old fricnd's voice and power And 'et methinks that centuries hence, Lying beneath the chancel flour, '-In tht' dark nok I shall'delight To hear the anthems ,well olce more;s And to mysaelf shall sfitly smile, W' hen music floods the vaulted aisle., : Or,' mocking gravely at some hand ' Less skilful than my own was'once, In my snug nest 1'll lie, and murk The blunders btathe foolish dunce, IBut to myself-the secret keep . And turn me round again to sleep... -C Mhmber's Jourinal.' -
