YANKALILLA. LFrom our own Correspondent. I Yankalilia. Auaust 1. A preliminary meeting has been held at the Yankalilla Hotel for getting up a pliughing match in this district at an early date. The names on the Committee- list are a sufficient guarantee that the affair will be carried on with energy. Another instance of the folly of practical jokes was afforded on Saturday last. Some young lads of the neighbourhood wishing to scare a young man on his visiting his inamorata dressed up a figure resembling a ghost. The horse taking fright plunged and threw his rider, and the consequences would have been serious if the stirrup-leather had not broken. A Dr. Braddock, from Second Valley, read a lecture last eveniug at the Wesleyau Chapel, the subject being "Ktmcs, or the Improvement of our Moral and Social Condition." Mr. S. Herbert presided. The lecture was listened to with atten tion by an orderly, though not numerous audience. Several anthems were sung by the choir in capital style, and after votes of thanks had been passed to the lecturer, the choir, aud the Chairman respec tively, the meeting dissolved. The weather continues fine; plenty of work for all hands, and everything appears to be in a state of progression.
