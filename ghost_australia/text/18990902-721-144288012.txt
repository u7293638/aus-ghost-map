A Bull V. L,ioii Tho goad people of lioubaix, in the north of France, celebrated National Fete day in July in a peculiarly atrocious in-inner. The programme of ainussiuents include! a' round of bulI-li^Jitiiig, and 'agran lwind up' in the shape of ah oacouuter bbtween a huge lion, ' Goliath,' and a Sp misli bull, the cantestants being put together in a large case. JLho result, was moss disappoint- 1 ing to the speotitow, for G»liatli, b-jrn and ' reared in captivity, proved a cowardly brute. H*) ' roare 1 splendidly, ' but lh-3 shouts of the blooithirat.y spectators and mud rush of the goaded bull cowed liim completely. The first encounter was decisive. The bull gored the lion's flank terribly,' and in the tnadness of pain Goliavh bit oil' tha bull's ear. But that was his ouly attempt at re-J prisals, for next moment he wai rjl(iog. -ion the ground, bleeding profusely .tn 1 groaning with agony. -Mean ivhile the bull stood with ready head waiting the lion's next. move. When it caine ic was a desperate attcrupt to get anywhere out of the range of the toro's terrible horns. To do so, Goliath tried to climb iho bars of the cag«, aad as he rose the bull charged again, driving his horns in the hapless lion's mouth. The wounded brute bit savagely on the horn and scored the bull's thick neck with a blow of his paw, but it was a last effort, for as th« bull drew off for another charge. Goliath rolled over in the last throes. Ia vaiu did the Chulos try to irritate the poor h^a^t into a final effort ; in vain they tried to make tlie bull charge ©nee again, lie would not touclf tlic iuert tawny mass, and Leo gave up the ghost whilst 14,000 presumably civilized beings cheered tlie victor, and heaped maledictions on the vanquished.
