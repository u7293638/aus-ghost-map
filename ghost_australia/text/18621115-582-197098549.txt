CORRESPONDENCE ————————————————————————— FIRES. Sir,—It requires no ghost, even though he or she came from the nether regions, to tell us what we feel, namely that the hot season is approach- ing, with vast intensity and rapidity. Children should be kept away from matches, and matches from them ; ardent young ladies should not read novels in bed by candle light. Kerosene should be most carefully used ; fires should be extin- guished, and not left to die, ere retirement at night. In the above I merely give texts for familiar thought—texts too, liable to expansion into practical warnings to all who know the scarcity of water, the heat of this semi-tropical season, and the ignitive characteristics of wooden furniture—characteristics which yield readily to the chemical phenomenon known as spontaneous combustion.
