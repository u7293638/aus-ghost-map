Since lie reviewer read 'iitm Poiwington's jlio-t' he ha* lieen puzzling to know what ncutal defect it wax likely to cure, but he ia-s given the problem up. It may be a lired traveller's book, acceptable and nor yk-vahle in a fiwliion— hut that is its highest recommendation— Madge Urodie and her icarcti for u dead man's fortune arc too un utcix-Ming, ami the mode of discovery of he tivu.«.urc too ini|Misrihlc.

Mrs. Dale ha* a pleataiit style: and, tliougli tlicrc is nothing ivou-'erl'iil iu the story, tlie reader's attention is In Id from the lictfinjiini; to the end. The plot is laid in t3'.' north of Eng land, and we are at once introduced to an interesting cniuity family, of whom Sir (Jeoli'rcy_ Hanniug is the licail. 1 11 Sfr (?'etiirrcy's cifotls to n-pair his family for tunes and rescue Ins erruig brother Adrian, and his affection for his mother, we get a good indication of his own thnracler. aud he is certainly a lino subject to Ih- the hero of the IhxiI;. The women arc well drawn, l-ady Hauning in ii faith ful illustration of the Knglish gentlewoman. Milliccnl. who has to cmlni-c the |ieril of acting a Ii ?, is perhaps mure, to he pitied than hlamcd.
