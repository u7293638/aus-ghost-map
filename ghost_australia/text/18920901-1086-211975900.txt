Wanted Infallibility- For more than a year the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council have , been trying to decide what the teaching of the Church of England is, or ought to be concerning her ritual in adminis tering the Holy Communion : and they nave uuu jot ucou uuio oitnci iu asuer- tain or determine the points at issue. This delay has given rise to various rumours. It is said that the majority of the judges wish to reverse the previous decisions of the Privy Council and support the Archbishop of Canterbury, while at least one member of the com mittee holds that the decisions of the Supreme Head of the Church of England in times past cannot be revers ed except by Act of Parliament. Having regard to the remarks made by the judges at the argument of the case, we suppose this is true. Anglicans see nothing singular in this state of things ; but it involves a clear condemnation of the National Church as a teaching body. For, on the one hypothesis, the Church of England has been teaching error for many years past, and is now going to reverse decisions in which, by implica tion, the doctrine of the Eucharist is in volved. Her supreme head decides one thing to-day, and the contrary fifty years hence — in other words, she stands confessed as an untrustworthy guide. On the other hypothesis the Queen and Parliament, acting in concert, can reverse the decisions of the Queen in Council. The Supreme Head may teach- error, but aided by votes of the two Houses of Parliament, she will perhaps approach more nearly to the truth .
