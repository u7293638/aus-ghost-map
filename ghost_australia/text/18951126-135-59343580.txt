TO*1INGAbBIE. (PROM OUR OWN OORRESPONDENT.) November 23. Rumour has it that the mysterous "Spring-heel Jack" has shifted his quarters from Traralgon to Toongabbie and that he was seen by a number of young men on Sunday evening on the cemetery road. When approached he cleared the creek and bridge at a single bound, and then disappeared from sight. 'Taking advantage of the above rumour, several practical jokers, think ing to have some fun, went to the trouble of preparing a ghost by means of a kerosene tine bearing the words "Prepare to meet thy doom," which they proposed erecting near the creek on the Tuesday night. Before the appointed time arrived, however, their secret was found out. After they had placed the tin in position they came up the town telling their acquaintances of the apparition and invited them to go down and see if it was still there. While on their road down, a person hearing their plot, arrayed himself in a sheet and got behind the supposed ghost, and when the funny ones ap. proached sufficiently close, he quietly and greatly to their astonishment crept out towards the interviewers, and thus gave the cunning inventors a well merited scare, which'-they plainly showed by making tracks for dear life. One of M.r Fryer's waggons and team of horses capsized over Bernard's cutting on the Walhalla road on Wed nesday last, the driver J. Pitchers having his arm and several ribs broken in the fall, the waggon was loaded with 4 tons of machinery for the mines and fell about 50 yards down the hill, the horses escaping with a few scratches. Owing to the dry weather the supply of water anO grass is getting very scarre in this district and the sawmill is again stopped.
