THURSDAY, JANUARYS, 1870. Our country contemporaries have spoken with force and with, point on the need of exertion by we will not say the constitutional party, but by the classes which view with alarm and dis- trust the prospects of Victoria under the Berry regime. AVe reprinted two articles on the subject yesterday which will at- tract attention. The one from the Gipps Land Times was an earnest contention that the recess ought not to be wasted by the men who wish to be relieved from a system of government under which property-holders dwell with their hearts in their mouths, not knowing what is to happen next. The recess, our contemporary urges, should be de- voted to organisation for a struggle, the coming of which is not problematical, but is certain. The last words the Chief Secretary spoke in Australia were to say that his return would bo followed by a dissolution, and this hint should of itself be sufficient. Personal and indi- vidual exertion to prepare the con- stituencies is what is now needed, and personal and individual exertion is what ho fai has been too much YV inting Hie indictment of the G »;>;>» Land li ¡sis pcifccllv, conect Hie c1 is es most in terested in the v\ eil being of the colony hive hitherto cunsideied that the whole dutv of i politicim consists m leading his ncwspapei One type of a fishionahle hdy is the woman who lies on n sofa, leads i novel, and sheds teils ovei the woes of an unfortunate heioine, but who nevei dieams of going out to lehevc tlie miser) experienced in the vvoil idiy world "With hei sjinpithj is totally divoiced fiom action And so with whole classes in ^iictoin lite) have filled to îeilise tint mue feelni0-> of m dignation ignnst abuses, igiinst coi ruption, md against a f ilso md mis chievous policy no ibsolutcly worthless unless they find expicssion in deeds The exposuie in the pi ess of the coi nipt agencies and of the dvngcious anns of the deniago0ues of the day has con tented them, and thej have not been aroused to a dctei initiation to do ill that is within then povvei to lendei such tilines impossible foi the iiituie Thus it is that, despite the numbers and the intelligence of the disses who aie mteiested in the secnuty of piopeity, and who seo tho folly of committing their foi tunes to the sole einige of J single House, they hive so f u been swamped Schemes to enrich the pool man by making laws i0imst wealth appeal to man} passions, and can be put foi wai dm attractiv eguise Such view s,when actively piopounded as they ne heie, are only to be met by every intelliDeut mm who sees the dangei constituting hiniscH an individual centie, fiom which advice, lemonstrance, and action may proceed, by i deteimination on the pait of one and all to help the cause m his own person -he individual may say, " How " can I assist?

object Mimsteis now profess to have in view-namely, the "distribution of the " land,' meaning by that the "re distri " bution of land already sold ' There w as a biutal frankness on the part of Mi Bi

old afce 2 That this dutj is grosslj neglected in England "3 The result of such neglect is on lue one hand to unjustly burden the few prow dent to discourage their thrift and to dum* nish their numbers on the other to de« moiahso still further the man> improvident, and to increase their numbers by fostering the fallacy that the wasteful have a right to support out of the earnings of the thrifty '4 ko efforts hitherto made either by law or philanthropy however calculated they may be to assist and guide the exertions o£ the thrifty can even pretend if perfectly successful to touch the case of the improvi dent Although 5 ] \ ery working man ni rn0land is able if willing at a certain period of his life, to make a due and Bufhcient provision against sickneBS and old af,e C It is not unju3t that our law which now compels the provident few to support the improvident many should compel these latter to support themselves if a practical meaii3 of doing so can be found The foregoing may be almost íe garded as axiomatic, and the only de bateablo point is as to the possibility of devising these "piactical nieaas ' In stating Mr BL\CKLLYS views on the subject, we do so, not foi the puipose of endoising them, becauso the ques tion is one which lequnes anxious and delibeiato consideiation, but as grounds foi discussion He would establish a National Club perfectly drs trnct fiom

one in an economic and sociological point of view that v o recommend the article in the Nineteenth Ctntmy to the careful atten- tion of all who aie interested-as who is not?-m abating the evil of pre ventablo paupeiism The official explanation of tho mol dí- ñate delay which takes place m bunging the Sydney mails to Melbourne overland is that the Government cannot aflord to pay the sum of £22,000 per annum, the estimated cost of a special mill ti am fiom Wodonga to Melbourne Tins would un doubtedly bo a considerable amount to expend even foi tho important pmpoao of saving a day's post, but we doubt veiy much vhothei any such outlay is io quued On referring to the time table, it will bo seen that thcic arc two tillouri tiains daily fiom Wodonga, ono lcavriy atG 10 a m , and the othci at 3 5 p m Tho first of these ti ama anives m Melbourne at 2 o'clock, tho hour at vi Inch tho post closes foi Sydney, so tint the opportunrty of loplymg to lettcis on the dvy thoy aro íeceived is lost But there is a tram from Seymoui at 0 40 a m , w Inch leaches Melbourne at 9 40 am, so that the special mail tram would only have to inn fioin Wodonga to Soymoui, and not fiom Wodonga to Melbourne Is theie, however, any need foi an oxtia tiam at all? Why not make the fiist thiough ti am an early one, so as to connect with Sey mom at l> 40 a in , and so have the mails m Melbourne before 10 ? Sey- moui would strll havo rts threo trains pel day, and so fu as tho sta irons between that placo and Melbouruo vero concerned, they would be m pre crsely tho same position as befoie It would be necessaiy for persons starting from the towns between Sevmom md Wodonga to use lathei eaily mthoinoin mg, but thoy would enjoy the immense adv antago of getting to Melboruno at the beginning of tho d ij msteail of tow uds the close A.ud if Home lnconveiiienco should bo caused, is it not bettci that a few shoidd suflei rathci than that tho efficiency of the postal system should be destroy ed 1 Thcie may bo departmental obstacles m the way of which wo aro not aw aie, but if so, it is only light that the public should know what they are It seems so preposteious to lose a whole diy's post when theic is ampio timo to dekvei the mails and cany back the io tuin concspondence, that no difhculty, unless ¿it bo of an insuperable natuio, should bo allowed to ínteifoie with the necessaiy refoim Befoie assent can bo given to the existing maniements fuller ïind bettei information than has yet been aBoided must certainly be demanded Late last nicht we were informed tint cable communication with Singapore had been re stored, but no meS8nL.es of later date than those alreadj published hav ej et come through 1\e notico that the South Australian four per cent loan had been subscribed, but at a low rate, the average price tendered for being 88T Au informal Cabinet meeting was held yes teidnj afternoon Matters m connexion with the Police department formed the chief sub- ject of consideration In the Education de partment, Major Smith is engaged maturing lus scheme for the classification of teachers, which he propounded in Parliament some months ago A meeting of the Lxecutive Council will be held on 1 ndaj Sir George Bowen, accompanied by Mr Warner, vient hythe 11 a ni trim on Mon das to Geclonol where he was met by Sir Samuel hilson Hie party proceeded to Colac bj a special tram, where a four in hand drag was m waiting to convey them to Corangamite In the evening they obtained some good spoit amongst the rabbits in the Stonj Rises and the numerous wildfowl near the lal e On 'luesdny they went in Mi Andrew Murray s 5 acht to an island in Lake Corangamite where game is said to be plentiful We mentioned recently that a reorganisa- tion of the Electric Telegraph department is contemplated by the Minister, who thinks that the arrangements are susceptible of many improvements. Some important changes in the personnel of the depart- ment have now to be announced. Mr. T. R.

Mr Pewtress is essentially a city oifficer and should never have been sent to the bush. Notwithstand- ing his want of bush experience, however, he has, according to all accounts performed the onerous duties which fell to hys lot recently at Mansfield in a creditable manner and appears to have gamed the high esteem of the residents in the bushranging district.

lid of the outer casket, and the lead cut with a sharp knife The silver plate upon the outer lid had also been wrenched off and carried off by the robbers The crime is supposed to have been com- mitted between the hours of 2 and 7am A circumstance that caused some suspicion to rest upon the sexton waB the finding of a rope, his property, fastened around the gravestone, but ho explains that by saying that he fastened the rope m the way discovered to enable himself and assiBt ant to descend into the vault A curious feature m connexion w ith them) steriousaffair is that some months since the

deceased, but the matter appears to have been hushed up and forgotten, almost the only precaution taken being the placing of a night watchman in the graveyard and the moving of the headstone, in order to mis lead intending desecrators The watchman was discharged on Monday, November 4, and the body waa Btolcn u few nights subse- quent!) No trace of the thieves has been discovered The only clue they left behind was an old stocking, a piece of newspaper, a dark lantern, a small iron BUOY el, and a piece of rope The boldness of the robbery was a surprise to the police, the churchyard being m a moat populous part of the city and immediately under their cognisance The police are of opinion that the crime was committed by several adroit and daring robbers, it requiring at least three men to enter the vault and move the heavy coffins from their positions, while another man waa required to luke charge of a horse and waggon on hand when required No traco of the hely haa yet been diacoveredi although, owing to ita decomposed atate, the authorities believe it cannot bo long kept hidden The motive of the robbery is be lieved
