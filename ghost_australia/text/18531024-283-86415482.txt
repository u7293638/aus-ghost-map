That pas=ive attempt in table-movin is prob?bly the mont extensively-shared ncnps tier in the t.ritish islanls at the present mvnoret; r.al in some reioeets it must, be regardled, to those who are fruitlesly ,waitin rolln I the table wi'hant n? mn-h as pulo hia a bottle, as the greatest "sfll" of the dr y. The origin of this eenupation wlhich hI? so s.melon!l devels;,el itself amongst no, althon.h not entirely unknown, is in some degree shrondedl in obiasritr. The aw nrational eas;:n was fir.t im:rrtel to us from America. thoulh Ger many alia claims the orig'n of the invention.

We hire hal por .ysms of it before, and aelentifle historians say, that -.eh portents precede great snecial revo!ttioos. If so, we may conclude, from the amount of the delirinm at the present moment, that our political system is about to hecome a tabula rosa. But probably these generatizinz conelusions of psendo-seience are not the least empirical or donhtfnl part of the matter. in the ever-.dvancing tide of science there is a point, the surf of its wave, abhot which are consl?ttly cofnieting. scientifec Or-' hdoxy, wild m ination Fanaticism, and mapture ; the four dis,mte the great wasifs an eÂ°st-y, and the four are as often defeated they disote. By the time the tide has mad its next high-water mark, all of them have had their rebuke: Imposture is detected and lies wreek: Orthodoxy, which has denied the es istence of some floating fiet, is refuned bh tb faTt lying naked at its feet; Fnaticlm flies of still to rebel amid the fotr of the quarrel.. some surf; and Imaginatiuon keeps its waryward flight upon the wimns. Perhaps, after these little combat., Orthodox Science as often looto foolish as the others. It is as dntgerus to proononce upon what cannot he as upon what i. T'here is not a single important discoverh no finmiliar to science that has not at one timbeer derived byh Orthodoxy as as an impturead, what is worse, a poerility. and The truth is, that in all these ranetioas there is sometlhing to interest the inquirer: if it were nothing mere than a commotion of the human underetanding, the cause of tht .co.nmotion is worth dlisimnpssianed not., to disem?er what it is It is often something, differe.t fram what it appears to he on the surface. The highest dis coveries of huneo science have cone at frst in distinetly from the dreams of empiries and finatis:; and science, when hastening to its ionclnuinns as rashly as empiricism, : as wrong Rhapsnlical persons collect ronnd a table, raps are heardl, and at once it is pnono c d1 that they are the manifestations of ' spirits." What if these spirits can only commune with us throag? the most childish of eonnrirances-do they not answer is we canId wish? Do they not -asanr Mr. Robert Owen, 3Mr. Robert Or,,e. f or exampi, as he has annonieee l in pint, that we areatnout to leave the present irrational state of society and to adopt a more rational state," &c.; and can anvthi;og he moreo onvincin-Tto Mr. Robert Owen? He hnas it m r over o~ the anthority of Ienj.amin Franklin, whom he ascertains to he one of the spirits vonuchin for this prophecy o It is t-ne that the s:irits who can only comma nicate througnh "a 3Mediun" y menms of an al rIha:hot, the correct letters of which her indicate hb tap:inig, are thus reduneeal to the level of little children at their accidenea, or rather to that of " the Lerne:l Piz i" which is a homilia tins position for the ghost of one so familiar with letters as Benjamin Franklin mast have Ieon. Nevertheless, the answer exactly accords with the experiences, past and fursre. of Mr. Robert Owen. Q. e. d. Scientifi Orthodoxy prolnonces that this is done by the toe, or some other equally timiliar machinery; and yet when Ornhodlx is chlallengel to the proof, it fails to point on: the l .ealnt toe, falls balck upon the elltew?, and wanders from every conceivable device, until it retires triumphant to a presnued ar r.n"em?:n' of "bones" in the ncket, a Ia Pell.
