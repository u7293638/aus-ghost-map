MAITLAND QUARTER SESSIONS. TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15. The court re-opened at ten o'clock. This being the day set down in the calendar for the opening of the District Court, his Honor asked the Crown Prosecutor how long the criminal busi- ness was likely to last. The Crown Prosecutor said there was no chance of getting through the list that day, as there were eight more cases on the list, and it would possibly last over the following day. His Honor adjourned the District Court till the following day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when the undefended cases would, if possible, be taken. The criminal business was then proceeded with. STEALING A SHEEP. James Shimmons, on bail, was placed upon his trial on a charge of stealing a sheep, the property of George Clive and Henry George Hamilton, at Collaroy, on the 5th June last. There was a second count in the indictment, charging the prisoner with receiving the sheep, knowing it to have been stolen. Prisoner pleaded not guilty and was defended by Mr. Simpson and Mr. Dillon, instructed by Mr. H. Levien. The prisoner challenged seventeen jurymen. The Crown Prosecutoi, in stating the eise to the juij, mentiened th it the prisoner was only charged with stealing one sheep because, ilthough a number of sheep were supposed to have been stolen only this one could be identified It wis to this one sheep that he particularlj asked the attention of the jury Senior constable James Hazard of C issihs, gave evidence that he went to the prisoner s place with Mr Taylor, overseer of Collaroy station and asked prisoner to let lum have a look at his sheep He did so, and Jh lajloi claimed a number of sheep as belonging to Collaroj station and one of them he produced at the Merriwa police office alive, it was since killed, and witness now produced the skin of it The sheep wis branded with two 0 s, a tar brand Prisonei sud that wis hi» bland, and that he did not know how he cime by the sheep A piece of the sheep s near ear was cut off recently There were different ear mirks on the other sheep By Mr Simpson There was no concealment on the part of the prisoner, who had said that his sheep had got boxed with the Collaroy sheep, and that this one claimed must have been a straggler Prisoner helped to catch the sheep foi Mr Taylor Prisoner had been away from home, and had told wit ness that he did not shepherd his own sheep The tar brand was dry The tip wis cut off the near ear [The skin was here exhibited to the jury J Witness knew of no other peculiarity in the skin proauced besides the cut on the en Mr Taylor took four sheep out of the flock, but one of theso he said he would not claim, he only claimed the other three By the Crown Prosecutor The four sheep were branded 00 Charies Edward Taylor, overseer of the Collaroy station, the propeltj of Messrs Clive and Hamilton, said the paddocks were wire-fenced Prisoner lived about two miles anda half or tlnee miles away from the paddock Ile thought some of the sheep were missing, and on the 5th of June went with constable Hazard to prisoner s place The fir=t sheep he saw had the Collaroy bl ma on its nose aud it was of the same age as those he believed to have been Io«t The Collaroy sheep were branded on the off side of the nose He was not aware that any one else branded with the swne brand ns the Collaroy station Why he caught the <¡heep was because îtbore a re«em blance to the Collaroy sheep, and had the peculiarities of paddock fed sheep If the sheepskin produced was from a Collaroy sheep it would haye a half halfpenny cut from the eu , but the ear mark on the skm produced had been ob literatea by a larger piece being cut out When witness asked prisonei about the sheep, he said he knew nothing about it, that he was away from home He (witness) knew nothing about the Bheep except by the brands and the wool The pecu- liarity in the wool of the Collaroy sheep was that it was a long combing wool By Mr Simpson Witness offered to return the other two Bheep to Mr Levien (prisoners solicitor) if he claimed them The tar brand was not ob literatea John Roper, sheep inspector for the district of Merriwa, was called, and asked to produce the registered brand of the Collaroy sheep Mr Simpson objected to this being put in as evi- dence, and the objection WA6 argued and sustained Witness was asked by the Crown Prosecutor if he could produce the GaMte containing the Collaroy registered brand Mr Simpson said this question was op en to the same objection, but wis quite willing to admit the brand to be as described Mr Taylor, re-called bj Mr SimpsoD, said he did not know of his own knowledge that any sheep were lost at all The Crown Prosecutor proposed to put in as evi- dence the evidence as to registry, &.a, of Mr Boper, and cited the Act under which be sought to proceed Mr Simpson submitted tint under this Act (Regis- tration of Brands Act) such evidence could not go in, although it could with respect to cattle His Honor upheld Mr Simpson s objection Mr Simpson then piesumed that there was an end to the whole case, and asked his Honor if there was anj case to go to the jury, inasmuch as there was no evidence that any sheep hid been stolen His Honor was not inclined to withdraw the case from the jurj Mr Simpson cited authorities to show that it was necessary to prove that propertj had been missed before a case could be made out against a prisoner Here there was no evidence to show that any sheep had been lost, and he thereforo held that there was no case to go to the jury He asked his Honor's ruling on the point Mr Billon urged similar arguments His Honor expiessed his desire to hear the Crown Prosecutoi on the point The Crown Prosecutoi submitted tint his learned friends' arguments were illogical The whole matter turned on one point Ile submitted that the question for determination was yvhether this sheep had been pioied to be the property of Messrs Cliye and H milton The fact of the sheep having been found off the station wns, he con eidered, as clear as daylight that the sheep had been lost The nett point the foamed counsel placed before his Honor was the intention of the prisoner to convert the sheep to his own possession, and he held that the evidence as to bianding and oblitérât mg the ear marks was conclusive as to the intention to appropriate He certainly hoped his Honor would not withdraw the case from the jury Mr Simpson replied, contending that the principle in law that a person was required to account forpio peity in his possession did not apply where it had not been shown tint the property had been stolen His Honor, m deciding upon the point, alluded to the difference m deciding such questions in criminal and civil cases, and said he could hardly take upon himself (after touching upon the salient points in the evidence) the responsibility of withdrawing the case from the jury The jury, after a few minutes consultation in the DOY. intimated through their foreman, their desire that the case should go on Tor the defence, William Bettington, a squatter, said he knew the prisoner for some twehe j ears as a veiy honest joung man he had nevei known anj thing against him Witness considered there was nothing e\tra ordinary in one sheep getting astray nom a flock Ile (witness) had once branded two of prisoners brother s sheep bj mistake Mi Simpson also put in testimonials as to character from Mesvs J B Bettington, Hewitt, Cooper, and another, a justice of the peace Mi Bettington fmthei «¡tated in answer to Mr Simpson, that he could not identify the wool on the skin produced as that of the Collaroy sheep James Smith, Police Magistrate of the Hunter, knew the prisoner for seven or eight years, and said, so far as he was aware, he had borne a good character at Brindley Park. Charles Joseph Gallagher, innkeeper, of Merriwa, said prisoner had alwajs borne a good character Prisoner went out of Merriwa on the 4th of June and lie was down at Newcastle for about a week before tint George Pitt, a farmer and carrier, s iid the u=ual time for bianding was about twice a year Ile (yvitness) knew prisoner wis not at home when his sheep were branded, in June last The fences at Brindley Park were down in some places Witness was at prisoners pi ice on the 3rd of June last Prisoner was not there then Mr Simpson addressed thejurj, contending that the question for them to determine was, were they satisfied that the prisoner stole the beast, and his Honor would tell them that the j must be satisfied that he stole it Now according to the evidence the bust had never been proved to have been stolen He reminded the jury of the advice of Lord Halles (who, he told them, was the greatest criminal lawyer ever known) to juries, never to convict a prisoner of a felonj when no felonj hid been pioyed to hay e been committed and to add force to this advice the learned advocate íelated thi case m which a j oung mau had been convicted and e\ecuted on a charge of stealing a hor«e which the real thief (yvho afterwards confessed) had on being pursued bj the police, a^ked the J oung man to hold He contended that in the present m tance there was not the ghost of nci°e agunsttlie accused The juij ought at oncj to acquit the prisoner Hie Crown Pi secutor replied and in doing so sought to disabuse the mind of the jurj of the sup position that because the prisonei might not have been piesent when the sheep were branded or stolen, be must therefore be innocent. He asked the jury not to look at the case as it was suriounded bj quibbles and legal technicalities, but to look it the whole circumst incea of the C1 e as revealed m evidence. His Honor, in summing up, told the jury tint the point-, for them to consider were-1\ as the sheep stolen * wa» it the propertj of the prosecutor J and was it stolen by the prisoner? He went cirefully through the material points in the evidence, com- menting upon the suiroundmg circumstances ,i» he proceeded. If the jarj* had any doubt, then they would have to considei the pri-ouer's character, and if thej' consideied that sati-factory, thej' should give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt. The jury retired at half-past twehe, and returned in a quarter of an hour with a verdict of nut guilty. Prisoner was discharged. FOItCniLE fHItl AND ÍSSVULT. In the case of the prisoneis Chaile3 Thompson and Robert Jones, charged, with Alexander Lindsaj and Henrj Oeorgo Kemp, with foicible entry and assault, Mi Simp-on, for the defence, stated that one of the prisoners (Thompson), who had not appealed when called upon, and whose bail v>.is eotre ited, M as no v present. He lind, a few dijo befoie the trial, re- turned from sea, but was not nn.ire that the trial was coming on when it did. He (Mr. Simpson) therefoie asked his Honor, if he hld ostieated the pn=oner's bail, to withdraw the eotreit. His Honor wis not ceitnin that he hid the power. Mr. Simpson said there was no doubt about that, and aigued th it his Honor li id not the powei to entrent. His Honoi nßiee 1 to withduiw the estieat. At a subsequent st ige of the busines», the down Prosecutoriutim ited tint he did not wish to proceed with the charge, and the defendant wa» discharged. HORSE-STEALING John Jack, a coloured man, was indicted for steal- ing a horse, the property of Matthew Peak, at Aber- glasslyn, on the 16th August last. A second count charged the prisoner with having had the same in his possession, knowing it to have been stolen. Prisoner pleaded not guilty, and was undefended. The Crown Prosecutor stated the case to the jury. Constable Aggett attested the prisoner, who was riding a horse, on the charge of stealing the horse he was riding. In reply to the charge, prisoner said he had bought the horse for £2, but afterwards said he had stolen it from another man named Jack, on the 16th August because he stole a coat from him. The horse was then in the court yard. Matthew Peak deposed that the horse outside in the yard was his property. Prisoner, who was work- ing at Leggitt's, had had opportunities of knowing the horse belonged to witness, because he had seen him riding it. The witness also gave evidence of having lost the horse. Constable Aggett, recalled, said the prisoner was about twenty miles away from Peak's place when arrested, and was going awav from that place. The prisoner, on being asked if he had anything to say, said he had taken the horse because a man named Jack (prosecutor's brother-in-law) had taken his coat, and he had taken the horse in pa- ment. Peak, re-called by his Honor, said the person alluded to (Jacob Leggitt) was not his brother-in- law. His Honor put the case to the jury. The jury, without retiring, found a veidict of guilty. At the instance of Senior-sergeant Kerrigan, Peak was again re-called, and it was elicited from him that he had a brother-in-law named Jacob; also that he had heard that prisoner had lost his coat. His Honor suggested to the Crwn Prosecutor that the jury should be asked to re-consider their ver dict. The Crown Prosecutor, while offering no objection to the jury being asked to reconsider their verdict, considered the matter could not affect the issue, and reminded his Honor and the jury of the first statement prisoner had made about having purchased the horse. The jury on second consideration, found a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation to mercy. His Honor concurred in the verdict, and sentenced the prisoner to three months' imprisonment with hard labour in Maitland gaol. CONCF ALMEN T OF BIBTII Jane Bal!, on bail, was charged with having unlawfully concealed the bnth of her child, of which she was delivered on the 28th June last, at 'West Maitland Mi J a. Gornck and Mr II Levien appeared foi the accused, who pleaded not guilty The Crown Prosecutor made a buef statement of the case to the jtuj, and explained the law lelatmg to such offences as that with which the accused in the present case was charged Senior sergeant Kerrigan's evidence was to the effect that he saw the defendant m the bedroom it Mi Brewer's Railwaj Hotel, in Llgm stieet, on the 28th June last She then told lum that she had been confined that morning of a still-born child, at the Exchange Hotel She said she had received notice to leave, but Miss Brown did not know that defen- dant had been confined. In reply to Mr Gorrick, Sergeant Kel ngan said defendant made no concealment of the bundle con- taining the child from him. Lhza Brewer, of the Railway Inn, remembered de- fendant coming to her place about half-past one o'clock on the 28th June, and asking for accomoda- tion She had a bundle under her arm, which she took to her room In consequence of what her ser- vant, Kate Cook, told her, Mrs Brewer said to the pnsonei that there was a dirty bundle in her loom, and she (Mrs Brewer) wanted to know what it contained. They went to the room together (this was about seven o'clock m the evening), and defendant said, she would tell all about it if witness would tell no other person She then said she had been delivered of a dead child that morning, and that it was in the bundle, which was under the bed Defendant had gone out duung the afternoon, and, as witness believed, had locked her dooi. In answer to Mr. Gorrick, Mrs Brewer said there was nothing under or on the bed (except the bed- clothes) under which the defendant could have con- cealed the bundle. She did not take the bundle out with hei when she went out in the afternoon The bedroom door was unlocked at tea time, and it was aftei that she made the confession. Defendant told witness that she had missed the morning tram and Bhe bad intended going to Scone to her psients There is only one train up the country on Sunday Anj one might have had access to the room during tea time Emily Brown, residing with her parents at the Exchange Hotel, said the defendant was at sen ice at the hotel, and left on the 28th June Prisoner came down stairs a little after eight o'clock in the morn- ing Witness asked her if she was well, and she said not vtry well "ft ltness had given her notice to leave on the previous week, and said to her that if she was going to be ill she (witness) could not attend to her, but that the hospitil was the proper place for her Witness also told her her suspicions as to de- fendant's state, and defendant said " Oh, no, Miss Blown " That was about ten o'clock the same morn- ing. Witness did not remember her making any clothes By Mr Gornck Witness did not know, of her own knowledge, that defendant had had a child She had seen defendant at the hospital afterwards, and theie defendant voluntarily made the statement that she intended taking the child to Scone to hei parents to bm y it. Mary Ann Cook, a fellow-servant of defendant's at the Exchange Hotel, remembered helping defendant down with a box on the morning she left. Defend ant also had a bundle with her Witness, latei on the same day, saw this bundle at Brewer's hotel. Witness remembered defendant going into their room (before she left), witness saw a large wet spot on the floor of the room, which defendant said was caused by her throwing up there Witness never saw defendant making any baby's clothes Defend- ant was lj rag on the floor of the parlor that morning, and said she had a pam Dr Robert J Pierce gave evidence to the effect that the child was still bom and the birth premature, and that defendant had been delivered on the morn- ing of the 28th June In answei to Mr Gorrick Di Pierce said that the^-e were well authenticated cases m which women had been unconscious of pregnancj until the penod of labour The prisoner had been in the hospital (and was there then) since the birth of the child The child was, he should say, a seven months' child Mr Goinck put m testimonials as to charactei, and addressed the 3iiry for the defence The point which they had to consider was, did the girl inten- tionally conceal the birth of the childp He then recited the evidence of the circumstances under which she left her {.lace of service, contending that it was clear she intended to go to her parents to bury the child The place in which the bundle was left was not, ho held, its final resting place, but the f ict of her leaving it m such a place was no proof of any attempt at concealment He contended that the admission to Mrs Brewer was a voluntary one, and th it she could not have been expected from the cir- cumstances in which she was placed, to have made a confession to nnvone at an earlier period The learned gentleman put it to the jury that there were many opportunities for the girl to have disposed of the child-in a closet, or a creek, or anywhere-if she had had any such intention He also laid stre s on the fact that the child was bom some months hefore its proper time, and that theiefore she could not be expected to have made any preparations for its bnth He asked the jury to consider whether it was likely the accused had intended to conceal the child in the pi ice where it was found, or whether it w is not fir moielikelj, rather than publish her shame to the world, that she should, ns she had stated to Miss Brown, have intended taking it to her home and friend» for burial His Honor explained the law, and the points m the case for their consideration A denial of bnth oi pregnancj, it was laid down, was not sufficient to convict, but the concealment in a bed, for instance, might be taken as evidence of an intention lo conceal The juiy retired at tlnee o'clock At a quaitei past thej returned with a verdict of not guilty Prisoner was di-charged.
