The matter, it would seem, was arranged beforehand. And in due course wo have the request from tho millowuer, " Paper machinery " is fieo now ; give ino my money back " again." Mr. LALOK'S consent had not been thought necessary, and from the Minister of Customs Captain Voi.u.u seems to have received a. very simple but unexpected reply. Mr. LALOR said that he could not refund, and he would not, and the propriety of his action admits of no doubt. Paper machinery was not the only articlo on which duties were lessened or remittcdiiiAugust,1877. In scores of instances duties were re- duced or wore swept away, and im- porters of the articles in question paid the legal duty right up to the day of the tariff change, Not, one of these ímpoifcrs

makers could not compete on these tcims, the Oovetti mont, on its own authority, gavo some fat oured company an advant ige of X3 os peí ton o\er the ímpoitei, instead of the £2 which by law could bo
