It ia the versatile working of Shake speare's Intellect that renders his supre macy unassailable* HLs mind, as Hazlltt suggested; coutslnedT within ■ Itself the germs of every faculty aud feeling. He mew intuitively how every faculty and feeling would develop In every conceivable jhange of fortune* Men and women— good or bad, old or young, wise or foolish, merry or sad, rich or poor—yielded their secrets to him, and his genius illumined in turn every aspect of humanity that pre sents Itself on the highway of life, Laoh of his characters gives voice to thought or passion with an individuality and a naturalness that rouse In the Intelligent playgoer and reader tbe illusion that they ire overhearing men and women speak unpremedltatlngly among themselves, rather than that they are reading speeches or hearing written speeches recited. The more closely the words are studied, the completer the illusion' grows. Creaturea of the imagination —■ fairies, ghosts, irltches, are delineated with a like potency, and the reader or spectator feels Inatlnotlvely that these supernatural anti ties could not speak, feel. d* act otherwise than Shakespeare represents them. So mighty a’ faculty sets ait naught the jommon limitations of nationality, and in every quarter of the globe to which olvl llsed life has penetrated Shakespeare a pOwer is recognised. All the world over language Is applied to his creations that ordinarily applies to beings of flesh and blood. Hamlet and Othello, Lear aud Macbeth, Falstaff, Brutus, Romeo, and Shylock are studied in almost every civilised tongue as If they were historic personalities, and the chief of tho impres sive phrases that fall from their lips are rooted In tho speech of civilised humanity.
