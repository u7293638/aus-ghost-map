SPECTRES OF THE SKIES. COMETS AND SHOOTING STARS. Comets and shooting stars were the subject of a recent lecture by Sir Robert Ball at the Royal Institution, London. He began (says the London " Daily News "J by showing that the sun would attract small bodies as well as great, those that were light as well as those that tin ore heavy taking in his hand a feather be compared this to a comet, and showed how it would be attracted round the sun so that its course would be in the fern, of a great curve The peculiarity of the comet's flight was that it always turned its face may from the sun Amoving slide projected on the screen showed the comet journeying round the sun, and always point lug away from thegieatluminary As address nearer to the sun the tail grew, and as it receded it gradually got less again A series of drawings and photographs (the latter taken by Professor Barnard in America) were now eliott n of various come√≠ home of these were famous Encke's comet for example but there were also many other comets which visited the earth every year, but were not of much consequence The astronomer Koplor had remarked that there were more comets in the sky than ashes in the sea One photograph of a portion of the starry heavens five views of the Great Nebula in Andromeda und n comet these two objects looked very similar on the plate, and it was noticed that the comet had left no picture of his tail behind When Professor Bal - yard was Showing this photo. rajah of the comet to a lady in America she immediately inquired after its tail, and when told that there was not one to he seen she refused to believe that it was a comet at all Contrasting the comet with the Nebula, Sir Robert Ball remarked that, while the father had remained a stationary object for millions of years, the former was continually moving about the "by The Nebula might be compared to a mountain, and the comet to a cloud resting on its summit One of Professor Barnard's plates show ed a comet with a Uro tail, and the stars could be plainly discerned through this tall Although, said the lecturer, the slightest bit of cloud would serve to obscure the stars from our view, yet a hundred thousand miles of comet Bluff did not suffice to prevent our seeing any objects to hand Some people believed in ghosts, and pro- tended that they had even seen ghosts of so shadowy a nature that a staircase would be visible through them I'rtilj the comets might be described as " spectres of the skies" There were many difficulties in the way of photographing comets If a plate were exposed to the sky for an horn the comet would have travelled some hundred thousand miles in this time The camera, therefore, must be moving round This method of photography was all very well for the comet, but it did not answer quite be well for the stars The consequence was that the resulting picture looked as if the astronomer had tried to take the comet in a shower of rain for the stars stood still as the camera went round, and thus they came out as streaks instend of dots Just as it was impossible to please everybody on this earth so it was impossible to please all celestial beings, and if the stars would insist on being taken they could not complain of the results Another photograph showed the curious way in which a comet had left a. representation of itself on the plate As someone had remarked, the comet looked as if it had been out all night Sir Robert Ball now turned from comets to consider those wondering Arabs of the sky, shooting stars He advised his hearers to put on their great coats and go out into a Hold and he down on their backs, taking care And to see that there were no stray cows about As they gored into the skies they would see, if the night was one, the wonders of heaven in all their glory, and perhaps they might be rewarded by a sight of a streak of light dancing across the lineaments and then vanishing This would be a shooting star, in reality merely a little object not bigger than the piece of tin li; with which diagrams were drawn on the blackboard but which was suddenly transformed into a brilliant line of light Pictures of historic fire-balls were now shown on the screen Astronomers regarded these dazzling globes of hie with some annoyance because could never tell when they were coming, and when they did appear they were soon alone, for they travelled as many miles in a single second as an express train would in an horn Sir Robert Bill endeavoured to explain the meaning of shooting stars, and to show boat mankind won sheltered from those streaks of splendour. He drew first on the blackboard the outline of a motor train a mile high At the summit, of this one would be above the fogs and smoke, and the air would be lighter, so that quick and dead or breaths would have to be taken Next, going higher still, so drew Chimborazo the mountain in the Andes scaled by Mr Whymper This was four miles high, and at the summit the traveller tins liable to mountain sickness. Going up still higher, Sir Robert drew a balloon, and said that one with no passengers inside had ascended to a height of 11 miles But he wanted to get much higher than this in feel right above the atmosphere which surrounded our globe Far away in spice countless meteorites were pursuing their course at a speed a hundred times as quick as rifle bullet Tor myriads of years the meteorites had been travelling in stellar space to bore the cold was intense, greater even than that obt tried by Professor Dewar in his Low Toiiipcraturelnvcli gations When the came in contact with our it mosphere they began to bore holes, and as they bore I they got hot, then red hot, then white hot, then hotter than the heat of the electric arc until at last after they had penetrated some 20 miles, it which they would do in a single second, they melted away Sometimes these meteorites came in showers, I and the history of the famous display of Leonid was touched upon. From old chronicles we know that in the year 1902 there had been a famous dies- I play of shooting stars. The Leonids swarm came round once every 33 years. To the. observer shooting stars seemed to emanate from, a point in the constellation ? Leo, but this was only apparent and not real as the lecturer illustrated by comparing perspectives in architecture and in the heavens. A picture of lbs bridge over the Niagara falls, connecting Canada and the United States, was shown, and the lines on this, which were in reality parallel, seemed to converge to a point. The Leonids swarm came in 1800, next in 1833, then in 1866," and it came again in November of last year. The spectacle in 1866 was magnificent, and Sir Robert Cecil remarked that he had never seen a more beautiful sight than this. He explained why it; was that the Leonid swarm came every 33 years by comparing its orbit with that of the earth. Every year on November 18 the earth's orbit came in contact with that of the meteors. On most occasions the swarm was not there, but once In every 33 years it was there, and so we were afforded the sight of the heavens crowded with aliootlagitnrs." " In c jucHision, the lecturer dealt with the constitution and of age of meteorites, and said that in bygone ages, long before life existed on this plant, there had been volcanoes of enormous size and immense activity. These had shot up fragments of their interior into the skies, and those had got outside the earth's attractive force, and had started on their journeys in space. At length, after travelling for myriads of years, they came within the sphere of the earth's i attraction, and finished their wanderings in momentary blazes of light.
