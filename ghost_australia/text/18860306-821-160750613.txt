We publish the following this week Severely wotted an author an essay to complete, W ith others skilled in letters he was striving to com pete; With mental pain at length he, disappointed, hears The palm iB now denied him, yet he, sanguine, nothing fears. But at bis post his course pursuing—with his pen Be hopes to gain perfection in his strife with other men. Devonshire Dumpling. Palm Sunday night in sixty-four—I can't forget the date— 'twas then I left my native shore with my dear loving Kate. Her father hotly did pursue, but oh, he was too late; There rolled between us waters blue; he lost his darling Kate. Kate always trys the past and 'pen to pacify bis ire. But still we stand as we did then with ber indignant sire. Perfection we may never get; we suffered pain so long; Though Kate and I are happy, yet we feel we acted wrong. Yarra, The wonnded knight despite his pain Contrived yon shady palm to gain, There loving friends received him glad, His foes no longer could pursue— They feared the old red, white, and blue, The colours made them frantic—mad. The General was at bis post; lie dropped his pen as if a ghost Had met his clear and piercing eye. Then laughing said perfection, skill, 'Jbe doctor's art have saved yon, still Some other day yon're doomed to die. B S. S.
