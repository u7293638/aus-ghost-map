Wesleyan Missionary Society. On Sunday last, morning and evening, the For Dr Kelynack, the General Secretary of the above Society, preached in the Wesleyan Church, West Maitland, the collections being in aid if the Society. There was a large attendance at each service, and the sermons of the Rev doctor were much appreciated the collections far exceeded that of the previous year. On Monday evening the annual meeting was held at Greta and was most successful. On Tuesday evening the annual meeting was held in he Wesleyan Church, West Maitland There was a large attendance by far the larger proportion of whom were ladies After the meeting had been opened in the usual manner, Mr John Falkiner was called upon to preside The Chairman on taking his seat, and he felt it an honor to occupy the position he did that night. It was an honor to himself, and he felt thankful to God for the sympathy he had not only with the Methodist Church but with the cause of God through out the world He was Kind to say his mind was broad enough to take in every evangelical Chistian Church throughout the world, who preached Christ He would not occupy their time any longer, as there were gentlemen on the platform who could with eloquence advocate the cause of Christian Mis- sions He hoped the meeting would be prepared to respond in a liberal manner to what they did hear it was theirs to give, and may the Lord help them to do so. The Rev. F C Boyer being called on to read the annual report, explained that the report of the society had not yet been received from the printer's hands, and his report would be simply confined to the amount raised last year in aid of the mission in the West Maitland Circuit The Circuit had contributed £53 16s 4d West Maitland itself contributed 142 4s 9d that amount The various amounts were read out, among which were the following Sabbath collections, £6 12s 8d, Missionary meeting, ¿.G Is 6d, Mr R Blur, towards new mission, £3 3s, half of juvenile missionary boxes, £1 16s 11d, ditto juvenile missionary society collections, £7 18s 6d There was one pleasing feature in connection with the last night's meeting that he would mention before he proceeded further that was, that the difference in the sum total and the amount subscribed in West Maitland last year was more than subscribed by Greta alone last night In other words, Greta had subscribed alone this year more than all the country parts of the circuit last year. The branch of the Christian church to which they belonged was essentially of a missionary character. It had ever been Bggres alive, and though the youngest of the prominent Christian churches, was now one of the very largest Quoting from statistics in Whittaker's Almanac, which had been read at Exeter Hall in May last, he stated that the Church of England had 20,600,000 adherents, the Methodist Church, in its various families, which had only started little more than a century ago, 15 600,000 , Roman Catholic, 14 100,000 Presbyterian, 10 300,000 He mentioned these figures so as to arouse in those Christians who were desponding feelings of deep gratitude for what God had done for them The missionary society of this youngest of all the churches is now the largest Its income year by year was over half a million sterling including the sums subscribed by these very missions that had been established The Foreign Missionary Society was the founder of the Australasian Missionary Church It at one time regarded themes children dependent upon it, but both the church and the society began to feel that they were able to take care of themselves and for some time the Missionary Society had left them to support themselves and to govern themselves. At last they had gone a step further, their mother in the old country thought they were old enough to enter the estate of maternity and to have daughters of their own, and obedient to their care the missions in their neighbourhood, in the South Sea Islands For some time they had helped them to support them, but now they had allowed the whole maintenance of the South Sea Missions to devolve upon the Australasian Church If they resolved to increase their efforts and intensify their zeal they would be able to carry them on He pointed out how every minister was a missionary, and he hoped to retain that character, in seeking souls, and finding a souls, and building them up in the grace of the Lord The Rev C Stead, though knowing they came to hear the General Secretary, wished to say a few words some of them might wonder why they had brought the meetings so far on in the new year He pointed out that the Sustentation Society meeting was held in September, and it drove these meetings to a time when they could not get speakers, and when they had to be making ready for conference If spared to have another meeting he would put ideas far on as the month of May If they had started early it would be gratifying if all were held as early, and were as successful as the club held last night at Greta, where the amount raised was £9 12s 3d, about 120 per cent more than last year if that went on throughout the circuit it would show that they felt a better affection and gratitude for this fund than they had yet done He had been thinking seriously of late whether they, as a Church, had been swayed by a right view with respect to con national funds His impression was that some of his brethren were afraid the connexional collections would interfere with the circuit finances He instanced the case of a circuit which had been in the habit of raising 55 annually to this fund, which had been stirred up to increase the amount and had sent 526, 524, and £16 in the three years following that stirring up and all the time the circuit funds were as steady and as reliable as when they merely contribute J £65 He also pointed out that it was in the time when they had built their church and multiplied their conveniences in West Martini that they had raised the most for this fund, Their people were never injured by being liberal to this cause The circuit that was most attached to missionary enterprise was the one event that God Missed. He hoped they would keep in view their object The Missionary Society w s an expensive society They had been receiving £4000 men occasionally from the mother country, but it could give it no longer They were abridging their operations because their financial position compelled them. If there was to be an abridgment here they would have to do it themselves or raise more money If they increased their contributions 20 percent they would be able to carry on nobly of want nil try to realise this truth that it was a grand thing to be an annual contributor to such a fund He concluded by hoping that West Maitland would display equal liberality with Greta lue Rev Dr Kelynack said he had great pleasure in putting before them that night some plain statements of this great missionary enterprise that would carry convictions to their judgment start them up to nobler bearing, induce more Liberality from their pocket, and send them away and determined as co- workers with God in a sense they had never yet been in speeding the evangelisation of the world. He had read the report referred to by Mr Boyer and was struck with the gigantic and overwhelming influence the Christian Church was exercising the world at this moment in all the grand movements for the improvement of society, for the amelioration of the wretchedness of man, in weakening the institutions thatweigbedas an incubus on man and putting in place of them happiness and peace, had their foundation in Christianity. She was in truth to day not in profession but in achieve- ment the light and hope of the world They heard a great deal of the waning influence of Christianity on the advanced intelligence of the 19th century. It sometimes brought strength to their hearts to view the triumphs of Christianity in a broad and extensive scale There were three aspects of this in the world's history, which lifted him above the last remnant of doubt, and made him feel full confidence in the grand truth of Christianity The first was its triumph over the old classic Paganism, and its victories over the barbarians of the North, who overturned the whole civilised world They could not realise the mighty hold Paganism had on the world When Paul and Barry has started on their first missionary journey the world was steeped in idolatry, every race had its tutelary deity, every family almost as household God , the mountain peaks were the watch-towers to some deity, the woods, the streams, every great ocean had their gods, in fact Heaven, and earth, and sea, and the great underworld all seemed peopled with gods Everything seemed vitiated with this spirit of idolatry and superstition Every condition of man's existence was associated with old Paganism He described the journey of Paul and Barnabas to Cyprus, Corinth, Athens Ephesus, the leading places of these superstitions, and the proclaiming of the simple majesty and truth of righteousness, with the power of the Holy Ghost, when the old idolatry was smitten, and Christianity triumphed. In proof of which he quoted the testimony of Pliny 70 years after the crucifixion, of Justin Martyr 50 years further on, and of Ter- Julian. He followed it down through all the terrible persecutions, closing with those of Diocletian, and said that one fact was proclaimed by the world's history through all and out of all that Christianity stood forth by the dominant power in the history of that time No less conspicuous was its triumph over the barbarous tribes that swept as a deluge over the great civilised nations Passing down sixteen centuries they came to Christianity as the bond cementing Christian states to-day He might show another historical review-one of the medieval Roman period. He wished to distinguish between the claims of the Papacy, and (he religion that exists in Ro man Catholic countries under the Papacy. It was said that the power of the Papacy was as great now, and its influence as great as ever, but the speaker contended that the Christianity of to day will extend over the nations, and work in ultimate national freedom from ecclesiasticism in the freedom of the churches in this gradual disintegration they had a pledge of the freedom of men from the tyranny of Rome (applause) The triumph of the church over scepticism over what they called free thought-in the past was a pledge of its triumph in the future He denied the truth of the statement that science was in irreconcilable antagonism with the dogmas and truths of the Bible As long as science kept to its proper domain, it could not be in Antagonism with it, but was so when it entered on pseudo-philosophic views He named a number of great scientific men, all professed believers and devout Christians, and pointed out that Christianity had triumphed over the same foes in the past, the present being the same old subjects of atheism or pantheism dressed up in modern garments He regarded the attempts of Freethought lecturers uprooting Christianity as the work of pea shooters against a granite cliff (applause) The great cause they had met that evening to promote was a vindication of their faith, which perhaps interested them more closely than the things he had been speaking about There was nothing equal to the moral powerehown by modern Christian missions He pictured the scenes the missionaries had to encounter in Oriental countries, among the tribes of the south, among the natives of the primeval forests in the west, the South Sea Islands and asked did any of them turn away, did their faith father, did they turn away and never essay the work, His answer was no. When all other powers shrank back Christian unity took the work up. Men of a sceptical turn sneered at the labours of missionaries, but he boldly affirmed that if they had the ability to recognise the true hero, and the candour to acknowledge it, the highest type of human character would be found in the missionaries they had braved the dangers of the rock-bound shore, of pestilence, bad climate, polar frost, equatorial sun, the dreadful scenes and the cruelties and even putting to death by the inhabitants of the places visited, but had never faltered! in their efforts to speed the truth. The result had been a glorious success To no part of the world had Christianity been unequal to the task of improving He described the various scenes of missionary enterprise and in connection with the Presbyterian Mission to the New Hebrides said there was a stone with the follow ing inscription in a church there -' Sacred to the memory of John Geddes, Presbyterian missionary, who died * * * * * When he landed in 1848 there were no Christians, when he died in 1886 there were no heathen " The present position of mission enterprise was highly inspiring to them to exert their further agencies There were many difficult questions that might be asked with reference to the position of Christianity in the world to day, but without attempting to answer them, he asserted that it had a stronger hold on the hearts and lives of people than it ever had before in the history of the world. He referred to the things he saw in his visit to England six years ago- in Ceylon, Naples, Rome, Fans, and from what he knew was taking place in Portugal, Spain, Brussels, Turkey, and other parts of Europe, and in Africa, America, and Canada, and to sum up all he saw and heard it was that the present position of Christianity in the world was a pledge of its ultimate and glorious triumph He gave an eloquent description of the breaking of day as he had journeyed through the forests on his circuit work in his early days, and said it seemed to him a picture of the glorious day that was coming up the steep of time They were there that night not to ask for assistance for a doubtful case, but for one that has triumphed, does triumph, and will triumph, until it fills the world with its glory The cause wanted money He pointed out that a great many of the amounts mentioned in the report were 6s and then dwindled down lower 5s a year was only a penny and a traction a week, while 2s 6d was not much more than a 6d a week. He would not insult the good sense nor reflect on the resources of the Maitland friends and the importance of this glorious district that laughs with plenty at this hour. He would not plead with them as if they needed pleading with, as he thought the fault was with those who put in force the organisations to reach them but he would say if they could not double their amounts he had miscalculated the power and liberality of the Maitland district He related instances of the success he had had in his mission to different colonies in aid of this cause, as examples of liberal, large hearted, sacrificial giving, and hoped that West Maitland would be quite abreast of Greta, not only in the collections that night, but in response to the circuit organisation He was sure West Maitland was quite willing to take her fair share of the burden cast upon her by the English Conference. With that hope he would leave the cause in their hands, (Applause ) A collection was made amounting to £5 15s 7d The amount collected on Sunday was £15 5s 10d, making a total of £21 Is 54 A letter was read from Mr Briggs, enclosing £2 2s his subscription, from Sydney, Votes of thanks were passed with acclamation to Dr Kelynack and to the chairman, which were briefly acknowledged, and the meeting was closed with the singing of From Greenland's icy mountains, and the benediction."
