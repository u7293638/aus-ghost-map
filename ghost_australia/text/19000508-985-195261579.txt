Why Sentries go Mad. Peering into darkness or semi darkness while on sentry duty has a tendency to produce a distortion oÂ£ vision which m4kes of every bush an enemy, and this has in many cases, even so recently as the Soudan campaigns, so affected the nerves of men that they have had a resulting monomania as to eternally seeing various creeping objects. One man in the Soudan saw every object of a vivid crimson for some months after being on outpost duty during an alarm, and he was only cured with great difficulty. General ETaraley tells on sentries who, on being relieved, yet stood stock still, immovable, speechless, and staring fixedly into vacancy. In some cases, after the man had been re moved this sort of fixity would re main for hours. Even in peace time, there was a case lately where a young sentry wounded the guard by firing at it under the belief that he saw a ghost; and Lord Roberts, in one of his magazine articles, re lates that even the most reliable and truthful of soldiers on sentry often have the most fantastic stories to tell, due to shattered nerves. Great numbers of soldiers in war time have committed suicide or accident ally shot themselves, the cause often being that they imagined they had let .someone creep past them, and had thus betrayed their trust.
