SPORTING. + The committee of the South Australian Coursing Club met on Friday, and made arrangements for the issue of a programme about a week hence, but it was decided to hold the first meeting at the end of March, and the second early in May. The return billiard match between the cham pion, Mr. H. Evans, and Mr. H. Grey took place at the Theatre Koyal saloon on Friday evening in the presence of a fair number of spectators, who evidenced considerable interest in the game, which was commenced at S p.m., and concluded at 11 o'clock. Evans gave Grey a start of 300 in 1,000 up, ancl gradually drew on his opponent till about half- past 10 when the game was called, Grey, 010; Evans, S82. From this point there was some amount of finessing, as the balls broke badly for both parties, but when Evans had reached 893, and Grey was at 910, the latter got the cue and ran out in a very clover fashion, winning by 107 points. Grey played a remarkably good game throughout, being, of course, familiar with the table. Mis best breaks were 71, 08, and 101. while Evans's best were 179 and 129. Grey made 29 and Evans Hi spots in succession during their best breaks. The games between these players are undoubtedly contested on their merits, and it is evident that unless thechampion is in his best form he cannot afford to give Grey the handicap with which he started on Friday. The Melbourne Xporlsman of Wednesday has reached us, and we observe in the adver tising columns the programme of the South Australian Jockey Club's Autumn meeting to be held on the Flcmiugton racecourse on May 2, 7, and 9. On the first day there are five events—Hurdles, St, Leger Stakes, Goodwood Handicap, Sires' Produce Stakes, and Victoria Handicap. On the second day _ a Maiden Plate, ^Nursery Handicap, Adelaide Cup (a •sweep of 10 sovs. with 500 sows, added), Selling Hurdle Race, and Flying Handicap. The third day's card includes another Hurdle Race, Ladies' Bracelet, Steeplechase, the Charity Plate, and the S.A..J.C. Handicap. The total of the money added by the club amounts to 12,000. Mr.'E. T. Barnard is engaged as han dicappcr. Referring to the Queen's Birthday meeting of the A.R.C., Mr. E. Ward, M.P., has in formed us that on Friday, accompanied by Mr. Blackler, he visited some of the leading men usually interested in sport, and obtained several promises of subscriptions, ranging from three to twenty guineas, to assist in the pro posed race meeting to be held on the Old Course in May. They anticipate that a sufficient sum will be raised to enable a first class meeting to be held, and are hoping and expecting that some liberal sportsman would appropriate to himself the privilege of giving a hundred - guinea cup to be added to the stakes. It appears as though some disgraceful dis closures are imminent in connection with the performances of the racehorse Tichborne in Tasmania. At llobart while running in the Bracelet Stakes, which was considered a "moral" for him, Tichborne, who was occupy ing second position, suddenly collapsed, and the matter was considered to be so suspicious that H. W. Rogers, his reputed owner, was discjualified and warned off the course. The jockey Blair was exonerated from blame, as it was supposed the horse had been drugged. Two days afterwards at the same meeting Tichborne easily appro priated the Flying Handicap and the All Aged Stakes; and at Launceston on Thurs day, m the hands of a new owner, he won the Visitors' Gift Handicap. A later telegram states that Id. W. Rogers and T. Lammerse (a Melbourne man) have been arrested by the police on a charge of conspiracy to defraud, as evidence is forthcoming that they gave the horse a big drink of water at a roadside trough just previous to the race being run. Tichborne was bred at Fulliam Park by Mr. Blackler, being by Countryman out of Bridal "Wreath. Mr. Von Doussa is fortunate in obtaining such excellent entries for the Onkaparingu Ea-ter Monday meeting. La-t year ho had 133 nominations for the four principal events, and this year they reach the same total all but one. The figures last year were—Hurdles, 21; Cup, 35; Steeple, 10; Railway Stakes, 31. This year there are in the Hurdles 2.3 ; Cup, 3(5; Steeple, 32; Railway Stakes, 3'J. Such entries in the face of dull times, and the fact of so many horses being in Melbourne, speaks well for the popularity of the Oakbank gather ing, and proves that a well-conducted club will pay its way and provide good sport for its patrons. Owners of horses arc reminded that accept ances and general entries for the Nairne races are due on Monday evening next, at 8 o'clock, at Bulman's Hotel, when a description of colors must accompany each acceptance and nomi nation. Nominations for the Whyte-Yarcowie races are due up till 3 p.m. on Monday next, Feb ruary 23, with the lion, sec., Mr. P. Gillespie. Nominations for Maitland races are due on Wednesday, and on Thursday for the Mor phett Vale meeting. Sporting men will be pleased to know that Tom Hales, the jockey, has so far recovered from his late illness that he is now able to take walking exercise occasionally. Ringwood's time for the Hobart Cup, 3 min. flj sec., was the fatest on record for that event. Ten minutes after the son of St. Albans passed the post, £1,000 to £100 was laid about his chance of carrying off the Australian Cup. Betting during the week (remarks the Mel bourne ,Spor(s>iian) of Wednesday lias been particularly spirited, theNewmarket Handicap being the event principally operated upon, Sheet Anclioi, Sir Garnet, Coronet, Pro metheus, Battailous, Coningsby, and Mascotte having each been backed to win £30,000 or £10,000, while Middlemareh, The Ghost, Xantippe, Malua, Meander, Amelia Victoria, and Velocipede have also received considerable attention. On the Australian Cup very little speculation has taken place. Mr. Pearson has accepted £2,000 to £200 about Commotion from Mr. Morris Jacobs, and Off Color, Acolyte, and Quality have been enquired after, Air. Pearson having offered to take £15,000 to £1,000 about the last-named mare, £5,000 to £500 being the best response. A dead-set was made at the rooms on Tuesday night against Bargo and Le Grand, both of whom are said to have gone crooked. For the ChampionS to 1 is offered on the field, but no business has been transacted during the week. The following are Messrs. Miller, Jones, and O'Brien's latest quota tions :— Newmarket Handicap.
