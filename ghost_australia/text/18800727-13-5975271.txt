GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. TO THE EDITOR OT THE ARGUS. I Sir,- N B takes exception to my advocacy of the Gothic " epidemic," and writes as though that epidemic would be as great a misfortune to Victoria us the importation of small pox or measles. Of course tastes differ very much in persons as in nations, and those who prefer classic residences are quite at liberty to erect them. I think rate papers, lovers of Gothic, should have some show for the public money invested in public buildings. "N.B" is unique In his reasons against the introduction of Gothic architecture He admits the style is suitable and picturesque in " narrow and tortuous streets " Then I would inquire why not in wide and straight thoroughfares ' How is it that if Ooline buildings look best when cramped up in narrow bounds, that corporations and other public bodies in Europe are going to such great expense, and are willing to suffer a pecuniary loss in clearing away houses, so as to JeaVeffec aiiúüü¡rúcrrupi.uu't!GiV8 0f those cold grey buildings which are only C) fitted to cold, dull climates.' The warmer the climate the more need for cool, grey buildings and their attendant shadows. It strikes me that the sunny climate is one more induce- ment for the adoption of Gothic, ag instead of great wide Blaring frontages exposed to the glare of the blazing sun, the Gothic would provide many nooks and corners, in which neil Shades would love to linger throughout the hottest day. "NIS" would imply that few if any works can come up to those of Wi en and Vanbrugh. No one can deny the merits of Wren, but few people can be found to admire St Paul's Cathedral and the Chapel of the Holy) Ghost equally as well as its rival the Abbey church of Westminster and its Hear) Vfl chapel That the English Gothic need not at y ii) a be cold and colourless, we witness the works of Mr Butterfield It is strange that Europe should become a laughing-stock to itself over the Gothic revival, yet strange things do happen in this world of ours however, I would still plead for the school of Pugin and Sir Gilbert Scott as against that of Wron Fo no part I regret the unfortunate opportunity which wren and his disciples had of replac- ing the churches of London I hope for 1 nitor fillies in Victoria -Yours Â.C July 23.

TO IM EDITOR OF THE ARGUS Sir-This old conflict, Greek v Goth is again raging, but at the antipodes, in your columns, this time I agree with your correspondent "N B, in yesterday's Argus, for to "1 are about corrupt Corinthian, detest able Done, inane Italian,' five , as Anglo-Australian has done, is to traverse the opinions of all the world Students in architecture, old or young, should avoid epithets, and would do much better (1) to study the particular wants of their clients in public or private edifices, (J) study the proportions of the structure, no less in detail than in its aygre (sale extent, (3) have a due regard to economy of space, for that involves economy of cost, (1) consider the nature of the climate their works are expected to resist and counteract, and (">) have especial regard to the proposed locality and aspect whether in crowded city or on the open plains, upon a mountain height or deep in a forest glade , alone then, if its immediate surroundings will not suggest to him the style he should adopt, whether the classic, with its leading principle of horizontal lines, or by lines vertical he should produce the mediaeval (so called Gothic) style , or again, if he could adapt the constructive and the decorative features of the one style only to his design, and not those of the other, it might be fairly suspected that he had neither the eve of an artist nor the practical experience of an architect I maintain that there is architectural talent enough to be recognised on all sides of Melbourne, and to disparage what we have or I seek extraneous aid, would be not alone a scandal but a failure too After a recent visit to many of the most celebrated structure in the principal cities of western Europe, 11 are reached a conclusion that the various st s les may be rendered equally beautiful under the hands of a master, but that one only would be eminently appropriate, upon any Mien site, and the whole question between soil r correspondents, I humbly suggest, becomes one of appropriateness and should be determined by (1) climate, 2) aspect, (3) for dairy and its surrounding objects 1 fashions in architecture, like other in Appropriate fashions, would soon be pronounced ridiculous I he high pitched roots of colder regions, constructed to resist annihilating Bnowa, costly and dangerous pi i acres and fairest-, necessary to maintain retarding effect, and the large window open ii j. all Gothic fe figures, in harmony with the fogs and dniMicas of an English atino -11 case would be absurdity itself transplanted hire 'I he wooded landscapes indispensable to Gothic and dramatic styles are in Mel I s i are now here to be seen Unquestionably it is climate has a striking affinity to and south of Italy, and there the styles ( ocean with its noble colonnades, Roman rub its Bpncioiia vaultings, or the Romans in ce (Cinque cento) Italian with its endless U L as at every stage, its charming play of light I and shadow, and its adaptability to any II in-are all appreciated best by those who, are in their deep shades and their cool retro its in accustomed to seek protection from the sultry sun Moreover, the classic styles of architecture, whether in public or private edifices (asBumnig they receive judicious treatment), will, irrespective of their ancient associations, always confer a dignity and Btlietic refinement, unknown to medieval or modern inventions of any kind Some index to the esteem for classic arch lecture in England may be found amongst the 178 artists known to fame, all of whose portrait figures (life size, in marble are upon the pedestal of the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park 1 we are architects of ancient Greece, 3 are ancient Roman architects, 12 are of the Renaissance or Ctnqve-ccnto Italian period, and O of the more recent or modern times, 26 in all, devoted to the classic styles and their works our models down to this day, while only 10 occur to represent the Gothic styles, namely, 7 for the Middle Ages, and 3 of modern date I must apologise for the length of this letter, and remain, so, I ARTHUR ANDlSiloUN, Sen.
