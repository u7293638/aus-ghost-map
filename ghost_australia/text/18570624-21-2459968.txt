Not something or nothing was a muscle in tbatnooifmamtf chinese relaxed HW Latham tightened for Disraeli differs from everybody else even in the way he laughs that is to say he would do if ever he did laugh; but as-he-ntver-doss, and probably never did, why it hurt very easy to photograph the process precisely in pen and ink. The singularity of this abstinence from eeoehinatory indulgence becomes all the greater when it is, known, as all do, know, that he has the liveliest possible relish not merely of subtle humour, but of broad drop that a frank laugh is the echo of" a frank heart, a false and forced laugh the contrary; Sir Robert himself being no exception to the rule, for it is now notorious that he was naturally the reverse of artificial. Great wars. before now have not laughed at their own jokes; but the member for Bucks laughs not at his own, nor others', ; -neither jew d esprit nor Christian pleasantry.' Yet there is nothing offensive in this insensibility. It isn't that he defies the general influence but that he is totally impervious' to it, as indeed he is to everything and everybody in the place, although alive to every pulse, and seemingly to every thought, throughout the whole building in any way pertaining to him. But from everything that doesn't he has the faculty of apparently abstracting himself completely and he might be picking up Weadamite cockle shell by the shores of the Dead Sea for anything that liveliness in St. Stephen's has to do with him or he With it. Still he might really have condescended to have shown a little interest in the affair of to day. The Normans, we know, for he tells us so, are mere mushrooms in his nostrils, and even the Ancient Britons are upstart toadstools. But this O'Donoghue thinks very little more of a thousand years than the Caucasian chronometer himself.

Palmerston gazed at them as if they were indeed the great great grandfathers of the real Old Old Hats, whose antiquity once captivated him. And so of course they are. That was the style of castor that prevailed first ere the triple hatred chimera of the eternal city was born ere the Tiber itself was heard of; here Romulus and Remus quitted their lupins nurse, and turned wolves among the sabine deer. It was in a hat of that cock that Zoroaster crossed over the magic at st the time Methusalem'waa a babby. In such that Cambyses opened his vein in the jungles of the Pharaohs, Darius was so covered, when Miltiades cracked his crown at Marathon j and such a hat had Bajaset when Xamerlano drew a convict's cap over his ears.

This time the companion of his march was Henry Herbert-road of the lakes of Killarney, including that enchanted shoot of water wherein a progenitor of the O'Donoghue already described is said to be seen riding of nineteen white horses at a time in a manner that would "draw tremendously at Astley's, Herbert is a fine start smart-looking fellow, on the sunny side of forty j but you'd 'imagine that he was only the younger brother, and very large, and certainly not at all perceptible from any direct voice in gait or bearing.
