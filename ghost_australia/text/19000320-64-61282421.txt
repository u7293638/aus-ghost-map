I A Beal Ghost. lt waa in a north country colliery village I lived with my email family. I was visiting a particular friend at J another village a few railes away and y stayed rather late. My nearest way home was through the village church- " yard, through which ran a public footpath. I had entered the graveyard and juBt passing the corner of the* church when I beheld something about the size of an ordinary person all white. 4 I had never seen a ghoBt, and really did not want to see even what waa now plainly visible in tbe light of a small bit of moon. Turn back. JNo that would never do. The apparent ghost seemed to glide slowly in the direction I wanted to go. So I threw away my fears and worked up courage to the sticking point, saying to myself it cannot barm me, but I'll speak to it if I overtake it. I did overtake it, and putting my band upon what appeared to be the shoulder I spoko in my best north country dialect as follows:-"Noo, Hinney, if thoo's a good spirit thoo'll not hurt me, and if tboo's a bad spirit , I'se gan hame to leave thee, so good neet." The creepy sensation I bad experi- enced had left me. Was it transferred, I wonder?
