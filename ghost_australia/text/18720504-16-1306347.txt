GRAMMAR. TO THE EDITOR OF till lllliaBANB COURIER. SIR-I am a stranger to the Registrar General, both as to his public and private capacity, so I am not taking up the cudgels on his behalf, but on my own I really think that when a man like your correspondent "Stupid" under- takes to correct another persons English, his own should, at any rate, be above suspicion, and in accordance with the rules of grammar III says, " Just two more, and I am done" Probably he meant to say "Just two more, and I shall have finished I have heard of a joint of meat being done" and of a swindler's victim having been " done," but even these are Blang, inadmissible and irregular tone, and not pure English It is all very well to say that every one knows what is meant no matter whether grammar be violated or not, but at this rate we can dispense with the English language altogether, and fall back upon mere slang, which would be a reductio ad absurdum, as we Bay in mathematics I was very sorry the other day to see your correspondent " Broker " writing to you about people in New South Wales treating our mining laws with "impunity" Probably he moor t " with contumely," for impunity means free dom from punishment A man may violate laws " with impunity," but how he can "treat " a low with " freedom from punishment," is, to say the least of it, obscure However, we cannot expect every one to be a perfect grammarian, but, at any rate, the critics like Mr. "Stupid" should, before appear- ing in print, know how to write the language they profess to analyze -YourS, At THE GHOST OF LINDLEY MURRAY.
