MARYBOROUGH. Wednesday. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) The provisional council of the Mary borough School of Mines have been promised, through Mr Guttrim, M.P., an uncon ditional grant of £4OO for maintenance of the school, which will be opened in the old town hall early in January. The grant is for the unexpired portion of the financial year, aud it is equivalent to about £l6 per week. It is rumored here that it is the intention of Bishop Moore to transfer Father O'Neill from the charge of the Maryborough mission, and give his place to members of the Order of the Holy Ghost brought out by his lord ship. Father O’Neill is a great favorite with his flock, aud his removal from the parish will be very much regretted should it be carried into effect. It is not improbable that Dr Moore will be petitioned against the step.
