I THE SEA SERPENT ONCE MORE. To the Editor of the Times. SIR-Will you do me the very great favour to give a place in your widely circulating columns to the following reply to the animadversions of " Professor Owen on the serpent or animal I seen by me and others from her Majesty's ship Daedalus on the 6th of August last, and which were published in the Times of the 14th instant. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, P. M'QUHAE, Late Captain of Her Majesty's ship Daedalus. London, November 18 Professor Owen correctly states that I " evidently saw a large creature moving rapidly through the water very different from anything I had before witnessed, neither a whale, a gram puts, a great shark, an alligator, nor any other of the larger surface swimming creatures fallen in with in ordinary vo) ages ' I now assert neither was it a common seal nor a sea elephant, its great length and its totally different physiognomy) precluding the possibility of its being a " Phoca" of any species The head was flat, and not a " capacious -vaulted cranium, ' nor had it " a stiff inflexible trunk ' a conclusion to which Professor Owen has jumped, most certainly not justified by the simple statement, that no " portion of the sixty feet seen by us was used in propelling it through the water, either by vertical or horizontal undulation " It is also assumed that the " calculation of its length was made under a strong preconceptions of the nature of the beast, ' another conclusion quite the contrary to the fact It was not until after the great length was developed by its nearest approach to the ship, and until after that most important point had been duly considered and debated, as well as such could be in the brief space of time allowed for so doing, that it was pronounced to be a serpent by all who saw it, and who are too well accustomed to judge of lengths and breadths of objects in the sea to mistake a real substance and an actual living body, coolly and dispassionately contemplated, at so short a distance, too, for the " eddy caused by the action of the deeper immersed fins and tail of a rapidly moving gigantic seal raising its head above the surface of the water," as Professor Owen imagines, in quest of its lost icebergs The creative powers of the human mind may be very limited On this occasion they were not called into requisition, my purpose and desire being throughout, to furnish eminent naturalists, such as the learned Professor, with accurate facts, and not with exaggerated representations, nor with what could by any possibility proceed from optical illusion, and I beg to assure him that old Pontoppidan having clothed his sea serpent with a man, could not have suggested the idea of ornamenting the creature seen from the Daedalus with a similar appendage, for the simple reason that I had never seen his account, or even heard of his sea serpent, until my arrival in London. Some other solution must therefore be found for the very remarkable coincidence between us in that particular in order to un- ravel the mystery Finally, I deny the existence of excitement or the possibility of optical illusion. I adhere to the statements, 229 form, colour, and dimensions, contained in- mj^ofBcial report to the Admiralty, and I l*rr;<î--th*«n m (latta whereupon the learned and science mvf exercise the " pleasures of imagination" until some more fortunate opportunity shall occur or making a closer acquaintance with the " great unknown in the present instance most assuredly no ghost |
