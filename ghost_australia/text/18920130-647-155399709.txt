The Only Proof. Dr. A. B. Leonard. The only proof the world can have that sin is destroyed in a' believer is in the ' good works ' which he performs. He may speak of thrilling experience and ecstasies of joy, but unless he does something the world will have 110 faith in him. When the disciples were filled with the Holy Ghost, they at once entered upon their great work â€” ' they 'began to speak with tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.' They did not take time to shout, to relate thrilling experiences, or to proclaim the joys they felt ; but they began to preach the Word in ' other tongues,' and caused the people to say, ' We do hear them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.' When Peter and John had been ' let go ' from the prison in which they had been immured because they had healed the lame man at the gate of the temple, and preached the Gospel to the crowd which was attracted by the miracle, they ' went to their own com pany,' and 'prayed,' and 'the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, a.nd spake the word of God with boldness.'
