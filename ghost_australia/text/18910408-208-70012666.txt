Wauchopo made 78 not out, by good sterling cricket, as all through his innings he never once gave a ghost of a chance, Wilkinson 43, Hutton 25, Boyve 15, and Vieussicux 11 also batted well, the latter player having his usual bad luck when playing against Dandenong, being snapped up by Dowell, who made a splendid catch at point. The weather was all that could be desired for cricket and if it omntinues a good score may be expected before the last wicket falls, and as the Dandenong boys are in very good inrm a good score will be put up by them and the finish will be very interesting and exciting. The game (as has beeoon usual lately) passed off so far without any unpleasantness which is a good proof that the ill feeling is gradually dying out.
