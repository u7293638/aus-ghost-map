The Advertiser. MONDAY, DECEMBER 11. MR. TAYLOR has not had altogether a pleasant time of it in Victoria. Since he has been in these colonies he has made no secret of his free trade principles, and his astonishment that in these new lands, with toll their variety of resources, all their bvenues to prosperity, and their many yet Unexplored fields for enterprise,! there should be any considerable number of persons who seriously believe that in order to find employment for any class of the people it is necessary to coddle add sub sidise particular interests tit the expense of the community. Having found this system a failure wherever he has seen it tried, he has used what influence he naturally sap posed he possessed among the work men of Victoria to induce them to give up a policy that could only tend to make them poorer, and to cripple trade and industry. The Free Trade League of that colony en gagedhis services as a lecturer upon the sub ject, concerning which they desired to enlightpn^hose of the working classes who have so long bees the dupes of charlatans and imposters, who Uve by exciting their passions and prejudices, and trading upon their credulity. It was naturally supposed that though the horny-handed sons of toil would be impatient of discourses from landsharks and monopolists, and those irhom they choose to consider the allies of fuch enemies of the public weal, they •jrould give a cordial reception to a man of their own order, who had manfully and suc cessfully fought the battles of his order in {he old country, and that if they did not Agree with bis political economy they would it least afford him an attentive and respect ful hearing. Butprotection having no foua < lationin argument or justice, it is necessary i o silence everyone who is likely to effec luaUy exposetbe rotteiiheseand?fraud of fhe system, and this course was pursued towards'Mr. Taylor. His appearance was {he signal for yells, and every proposition he submitted in accordance with bis views in the question of free trade, every argu ment directed against the opposite princi ple, was the signal for fresh uproar. It he bad been atyowjed to finish bis sentences, to conclude his syllogisms or to round his periods, the outbursts would not have been 6f much consequence. People at a public meeting have a Tight to express dissent and disapprobation, and if it is not fery intelligently expressed, that is perhaps their misfortune ; but there is a wide difference between dissent and riotous interruption, especially when the latter is carried to- th* exto-me of causin* the speaker to abruply close Ms aiarese after tnanyineffedtutl efEdrte to continue it. At a numWr of teWnfl \diere Mr. Taylor spoke be -was olamored down, and every strong point which he urged was replied to by noise and insolence. If he suggested that to xai?e the price of an artide was to tax the consumer, there was an uproar. There was more uproar when he eiinply asked if it could be shown that free trade would be an evil to the colony. When he reasoned that it was manifestly unfair to make the community |> a y 80 per cent, more for goods than they could obtain them for ill an oj>en market, he was greeted with cries of "nonsense," and Vehementassurances that he " knew nothing about it." Hie self-evident proposition, that if the consumer did not pay. the 20 per cent extra he would be to that extent better off, provoked 7yeUs of rage, and by|the corollary that the money thus saved would he available for employment in other ways, Mr. Taylor lashed his audience into a state of fury. Explosions of wmth followed the suggestion; that ajcountiy without coal and iron was hardly in so favorable a position for carrying on manufacturing industries as a country possessing both those requisites. Hue description of the proceedings applies to all£the meetings where the protectionists gathered~in force; at Prahran, Richmond, Castiemaine, and Fitzroy there was the same senseless intolerance of free speech. The apologists for tills conduct brought against Mr. Taylor the utterly gratuitous charge, which they do not attempt to sub stantiate, that he made himself in Victoria the tool of a party, and allied himself with tiioee who tried to keep the lands from the people. It is curious how the hind and free trade questions were mixed up by the protectionists at these meetings, though they have no necessary connection with each other, and are, in fact, totally distinct. It is difficult to see how a person unable to get land on terms that be etmsidett liberal will be benefited % having SO per cent, added to the fair market value of a number of the necessaries of life which he must purchase. Then the peculiar circum stances of the colony are urged as a reason in favor oT protection, but it is the duty of those who put forward such an argument toehowliovthe circnmBtanceB affect the question, and why in a new country, with a scanty population, and millions of acres of land wailing to be tilled, mines to be worked, and sources of profit yet to be utilised, we should set up a lot of pauper trades, and tax the general laborer, the farmer, the miner, and in fact tile great bulk of the community, for their support. U ialbundandy proved, by facts, however, that injures a colony, and is generally «nnse than useless to any trade it is employed to benefit. The manufactures that the Victorian -protactioaists assert have been brought into a prosperous condition under their policy flourish in New South Wales under m system <rf fjee trade. Then there is the undoutaad Act that, .excepting IVugnania and Western Australia, Victoria is making the slowest progress, in population and tradw, of juay of this «z«Hip <£ provinces* U v absurd to talk of protection raising wages, wnetf^we knowtiiat wages are not higher in Victoria than in other colonies, and that during the last year or two other colonies have to a large extent been drawing labor both skilled end unskilled from that protectionist province. These great facts will surely in time be .seriously considered in Victoria by the working men, and the agricultura lists, and the proper inferences drawn therefrom.* If deductive reasoning is be yond their mental powers, we may fairly expect from them the faculty of inductive conclusion. From Europeans entrusted with the electoral franchise it is not un reasonable to look for at least the intelli gence of the spaniel that is taught by ex perience, or of the infant that some reviewer tells us is guided by the Baconian system of philosophy when it invariably seeks for lacteal sustenance from its mother, and not from its father. Just now Sir Hercules Robinson is the most popular man in the Australias. The speeches of Governors are usually heavy, and not always particularly instructive. Vice-regal eloquence is of too lofty en order to descend to the common art* which appeal to the imagination and impress the mind. It can scarcely be jocular without a sacrifice of dignity, or satirise the foibles of men without incurring the odium of partisanship. Coming as it does on certain, state occasions, it is apt to "smell of the lamp," and to be uttered with a pomposity that proclaims ite own wisdom and the re flected majesty of the Sovereign. Bat Sir Hercules Robinson has thoughts of bis own, and a styieofhis own, which commend themselves to any average assembly of Englishmen. He has that facile power which has always been a special cha racteristic of the eloquence of Ireland. In its lower and degraded form it if Uarney; in its higher and original form it is that peculiar something which places a speaker at once en rapport with his hearers. And he has more than this. He has keen discrimination of the permanent forces that are at work under the variable movements 'of the popular mind, and he-knows how to dwell on these so as to make more clear to everybody what nearly everybody believes in. The necessity for Federal union among the colonies has long been felt. It has needed only the voice of a true leader to awaken the echoes of two millions of hearts. The most timid content themselves with saying it will come by and by. The bolder do not hesitate to declare that even now the times are propitious. The ssoti ment itself is everywhere applauded to tlie echo. It cannot be expected Ifc*l the more resett speech of Sir Heifcules will s* readfly command fits assent of the maty* The objections to immigration may be ao plausibly put, and there is such « fond of Wftlfiriiness to appeal to, that it is easy for an ignorant declairaer to stand bis groand against an enlightened politician. Bat the applause given by the ratepayer? of Denili quin will be endorsed by all true thinker*. Sir Hercules declares that one great w?mV which impressed itself upon him at every tura in Ins Journey through the counter was the want of population. Everywhere abundance of good laud, everywhere a pro digality of resources, bat few to till the soil, and few to unearth the treasures of the mine. He pointed out how great public works, fiach as tend by their very nature to increase production, were de layed for want of labor, lie showed how, in spite of this scarcity, each already had been the accumulation of capital in the bands of die more enterprising or the more fortunate, that the banks of New South Wake were glutted with private capital waiting investment, and the Treasury over flowing with surplus revenue. IGs state ment will not indeed apply withoat mod^ nation to all the colonies. Of no other can it be said that the coffers of Ok State are overflowing, though probably of aft it may be affirmed that wealth is accumulating faster than remunerative investments can be found for it. Even this modification ts more apparent than real in regard to Sooth Australia. New Sooth Wales may be lightly taxed, but it is taxed more than our own colony. The amount paid per bead of our mean population is 15 per cent, less * than that paid in New South Wales, a j reproach or a eulogy soon to be attend. ■ Gnu#ng> however, Oat the statement is _ generally true, vie, that private capital and public resources are superabundant, the remedy proposed for this plethora of j wealth is the wtrodnctio? of immigrants upon a larger and more liberal scale. It is altogether a mistake to topposf that the tree prosperity of a country is tote mea sured by the amount of its wealth, A/ar truer standard is to be found in the even ness' of its distribution. For this Sir HerculMi pleads when ha speaks of the creation of additional wealth leading to a Btill further demand Hot later, and this to t the enhancing of the comfort of stt. He j declares his conviction that the greater the population the greater will be the general ; ! prosperity, that if only immigration be j wisely conducted it will add to the par- I chasing power of wages. In other words, the ' mechanic and artisan and laborer, instead of being driven to iaapoferisbiiy competttios j through the introduction of more of their j dais, will find Oat work will be more regular, and the mean of lmag wiH be cheaper. Deficiency of laW may ntean a | higher rate of wages, bot it inevitably ; means, too, a smaller amount really earned. It is not the number of sfailfiags a day that amangete, but the value he is abk't* ob tain for these, that is the tat tost of Us | real earnings. He most irst of all exchange . his silver which he can neither eat, drink, 1 nor we?, for necessuy articles of food and ? clothing before he is able to calculate'the amount of his wages. We hold that Sir Hercules is right in bis stotcawenWos*l las'* ' reasoning, within t%e faoonds that he him self prescribed. It* indeed true that there is a limit faeyoad which increase dF fofo htkm will pom en Ok means nf ashtin . teuce, but we Jasve so reasmi whatevw to think, save in such genenl crises cf bade as are common to every country aader I heaven, that this limit k to be reached in i Australia for centariee. It b one of fthe most settled axkau of potfckal economy that an abundsace of land is one of the most fertile and certain sources of wealth, and we have in Awrtra&s;, taken as a whole, a practically unlimited simply. The capital of a country is created by the produce of it exceeding the consumption of those employed in its ptodactioa, aad there is no more certain method of producing what is needed for coi«umnt?m than the cultivation of the eoQ. If capital aad labor be judickHuly employed in this, not only will means of subsistence be obtained, bat an overplus for future need in continuaUf increasing quantity. We have room for millions to settle upon toad and cultivate it, to say nothing of the working of oar mines, which under less speculative methods than exktat present woaidyieU the means of living for great samhen ssflee. Each of the larger colonies, save Victoria, is waking up to the absolute necessity of am iacnase of inumgratio?fa?d we trmt s!tt too will listen to the words of wisdom addressed lay S?r Hercuka Bobmsoato afi Asstaiia.
