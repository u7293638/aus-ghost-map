THE FEBRUARY MAG MANES. ? -- It is a long time since an) magazine article has created so wide and deep a sensation as that which, appears under the title of "The Bismarck Dynasty, in the Contemporary Review It has led to the demand for second edition of that publication , it has been translated into French, German, and Italian, and it is alleged to have been inspired, if not part) written, by the widowed lady who has such just cause for resentment against the German Chancellor The alpress has, however, emphatic elly denied all responsibility for the article, and has expressed regret that it should have ever been published In the article the late Emperor is spoken of as having "representedcivilisation culture, peace Above all he represented the hateful principle of the right of woman to the recognition of her faculties regardless of her seat, and he paid to the genius of his wife the homage to which she was entitled as an intellectual force, without starting the measure of his devotion because she was only a woman'" Prince Bismarck, it is suggested, if not asserted, brought the late Emperor from San Remo in the dead of winter, in the hope and expectation that the journey would kill him, and, he is added, "even now, when all is over, there is no saying how much longer his death might have been averted but for the accident by which the throat of the Imperial patient was torn open by the German operator, whose cause was the most efficient all of the canter ' Bismarck is described as having always hated the wife of Frederick the Noble, partly because she was an English woman, and a Liberal saturated with progressive ideas, and partly because her husband loved and revered her for the high qualities of her heart and mind, and was therefore largely influenced by her Not only so, but Frederick the Third refused to transact business with Count Herbert Bismarck, and would never have accepted him as his own Chancellor after the old man's death. Of the Empress Frederick herself, the writer 60's "Half German by birth, naturalised German by marriage and residence, the wife of one German Emperor and the mother of another, she had never ceased to cherish with affectionate devotion the memories of the land where the sabre is not perpetually clanking in the street, and where there are other ideas of life than that of being a Prussian grenadier. W itb all her husband s aspirations she had keenly sympathised, and she had shared also in his antipathies. She had encouraged him to contemplate the emancipation of the Imperial throne from the ever increasing shadow of the Bismarckian Major home Upon her, therefore, widowed and forlorn, fell the first vengeance of the offended Chancellor" Not only was she attacked, through Sir Morell Mac Kenzie, by the reptile press, but the Empress was " compelled under threats of pecuniary pressure to hand over to the German Government certain documents belonging to her husband How the estrangement between the present Emperor and his parents was brought about is thus explained At canteen years of age the young Prince was sent to Bonn, where " the officers of the garrison littered the lad, filled his foolish young head with dreams of playing the role of a second Frederick the Great, and inculcated a spirit of self regarding ambi- tion, the end of which has not yet been seen. When his parents endeavoured to check the working of this moral poison his comrades encouraged him to defy their warnings. He drew his allowance from his grandfather, not from his father, and the approval of Bismarck was more to him than the love and esteem of his mother. .

Alliance or firmament, strong alliance or enormous armament-the one or the other we mu8tchoo»e, or go down This is the lesson which the whole course of recent events offers to our view. To suppose that a comparatively weak England can " keep out of the arena of European complications,' as the cant phrase goes, is but a vain dream " "British subjects in East Africa," writes the Archdeacon of Maglia, in the Fortnightly Review, are now witnessing the destruction of all their interests, commercial men and traders are watching the ruin of their commerce, while missionaries are looking upon their civilising work rendered abortive, with the lives which have been laid down and the money which has been spent in opening up and civilising the country made of no avail And all because certain Gerrunn'tradera want their Government to found a colonial empire, in opposition to the avowed convictions of Bismarck, which are, or were, these -"I want no colonies They are good for nothing but supply stations for UH III Germany this colonial business would be just like the silken sables in the noble families of Poland, who have no starts to their backs " Archdeacon Farrar has spent 14 years in the closest intimacy and friendship with the natives of his district, and therefore he claims to speak with authority and he declares that, up to the coming of the Germans, the whole of Eastern Africa was peaceful, trustful of England, and regarding the English 11 ing as the emblem of freedom and prosperity) Then came the Teutons, who manufactured bogus treaties with the Sultan of "cinnabar, by which vast tracts of country in the interior were claimed without the consent of the chiefs or owners of the soil, they insulted the chiefs and established a blockade along the coast as an excuse for keeping a large number of ships of war upon the station, so as to overawe the natives who refused to be protected by them One thing the Archdeacon contends the British Government must do at all costs, and that is, it must offer the firmest opposition to an attempt made by Germany to seize the Island and town of Zanzibar, for nearly the whole of the property there belongs to British subjects " England must be firm here ; we have yielded too much to Bismarck in East Africa, and the time has now come for a determined stand " Professor Dowden discusses somewhat discursively, the hopes and fears for literature," and we can only gather from his essay that he does not regard either democratic institutions or the scientific spirit of the age as necessarily hostile to literature Mr Swinburne continues his analysis of Victor Hugo's real poetry, which he extols, while condemning the support and en courngemen« given by Hugo to the fatally and perverse) illogical pretensions of the nation which professes a belief in equality on condition that Frenchmen are to be exempt from the operation of its plainest laws ' Under the title of " A Story of the Lighthouses," Professor Tyndall relates the circumstances under which he resigned his position as scientific adviser to the Trinity house, an 1 makes some very damaging statements concerning Sir James Douglass, who is the inventor and patentee of a. high power gas and oil burner, and has been entrusted at the same time with the entire control of the inquiry on lighthouse illuminations.
