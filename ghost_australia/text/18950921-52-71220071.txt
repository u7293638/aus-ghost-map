Social Shams. An indignant American woman has been vigorously using her pen to attack the social shams of America — those of New York in particular. She says:—"This is the day of shams. I know a woman who is supposed to entertain lavishly, yet who rarely receives a guest. I call her functions 'ghost parties,' because they are only the shadows of the substance, the event itself being purely imaginary. Why, that woman Chas gained her reputation for entertaining, and has received no end of dinner invitations on absolutely nothing at all! I have suspected her tactics for some time, and now I am quite sure that what I assert is, indeed, true that in nine cases out of ten her dinners are purely imagi- nary. She has a clever way of finding out who is engaged, to whom, and then she asks people who she knows cannot come to her house, and so scores to her social account, with no other outlay than her crested paper and dainty seal."
