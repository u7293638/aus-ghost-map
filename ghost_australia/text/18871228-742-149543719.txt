BALLADE OF A FAIR IMPENITENT (From Zongman's Magazine.) Between the midnight and the morn, The under world my soul espied ; I saw the shape of men outworn, The heroes fallen in their pride ; I saw the marsh land drear and wide. A many a ghost that strayed thereon, ' I roam for aye,' a maiden sighed, ' The sunless marsh of Acheron.' ' And ia tby fate thns hope-forlorn T' 'Yes, even so,' the shape replied ; ' For one I wronged ia life hath sworn In hatred ever to abide ; The lover seeketh not the bride, But aye, with me, his heart dreams on, Asleep in these cold mists that hide The sunless marsh of Acheron. ' And still for me with Lacon mourn, And still my pardon be denied ; /Lnd never Bhall I cross the bourne, Nor leave the woful waterside. Yet I repent me not,' she cried ; ' Nay, only that mine hour is gone. One memory hath glorified The sunless marsh of Acheron,' BWVOI-. Princess, when thy fair ghost shall glide Where never moon or starlight shone, See that thou tarry not beside The sunless marsh of Acheron. â€”Graham Tomsoh
