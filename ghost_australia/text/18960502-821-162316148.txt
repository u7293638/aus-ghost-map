THE GARDEN. THE FLORAL WONDER OF PANAMA. The Holy Ghost flower or Flor del Espiritu Santo, is found in the region of the Isthmus of Panama. It seems to thrive in low. marshy spots, and springs up from decayed logs or from crevioes in the rocks. The larger and older bulbs frequently send up the leaf stalks six or seven feet in height, and from these, which are joined, broad lanceolatod leaves are thrown out in pairs. The plant is an annual, and in June, July, and August the flower stalks start up from tho base of the bulb, devoting all their energies to the formation of the buds. The buds are arranged on the stalks much like those of the hyacinth, the usual number for a well-grown stalk to bear being from twelve to fifteen. The leaves are very pale green in colour, as though in harmony with the delicate purity of the blossom. The blossom is of alabaster white ness, much like the old-style English pulpit. This, of itself, is strikingly curious, but it fades into insignificance when one looks into the centre of that strange bloBsom, for there, ,nestling in its very heart, is a perfect image of a dove. It requires no imagination to see it. No one conld mistake it for anything else; for no human skill could fashion its shape more perfectly, no artist could adorn it with more elegant tints, and no perfumer could endow it with a more delicate fagrance. Right in the cup of the blossom, with the snow white canopy about it, rests this wondrous image, its delicately moulded wings drooping, half extended at its side, its gold tinted head lieut slightly forward, and its tiny, crimson tipped bill almost touching its snowy breast. An observer who saw it m its native home, says:â€”"Just as the figure of the dove itself is there, beyond dispute, so does an expression pervade the image, an expression that even the most careless cannot fail to notice, the incarnation of humility and spiritual purity."
