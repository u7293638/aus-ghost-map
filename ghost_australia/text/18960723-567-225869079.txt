The show is the main event of the year here, beiog regarded as a great holi day, while it "is a time when stock-owners see their stock as others see them. The prue-liit has been altered thiv year to try and give what might be called maiden exhibitors of sheep a chance amongst themeelve. The al teration in tbe conditions in the sheep dames for owners of not over 1,000 sheep, are that an exhibitor in seoti on IH is not allowed to com pete in the other sections. This should be the means of inducing breeders not . previously ex hibitors to follow tbe example of those who have been shovri ng in that section and carrying off champion honours as we!L Lord Brasaey'e medal for best dairy cow has been received by tbe Secretary. It is a nice piece of woikman- ship, with the necessary inscription on itÂ»except of oouraa the same of the winner, which wQl be inscribed after the show. We have a reputed ghost hero.
