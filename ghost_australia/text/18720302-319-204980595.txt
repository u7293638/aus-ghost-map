Aa everyone knows' who- has attended Plymouth Church, the preacher and tho audience i. usually settle down to serious business at about the middle of the 'pro-sermon' prayer. It is Mr. Beecher's custom 'at thia point of ihe service to'. 'let himself out' with that grand earncBtnesB which is the chief secret of his success as an orator, and, after a few sentences of pas sionate rnetonc, ino congregation wminaiy abandon themselves to Tiis magic Bpelf.'
