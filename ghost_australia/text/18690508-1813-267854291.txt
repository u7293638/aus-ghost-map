ORIGINAL POETRY. URANA RACES. Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum collegisse juvat. This morn is the [?], the sun's [?] rays Have changed the routine of Urana's [?] Having glittered on greensward, fair tents, and grand stand, Of the prettiest course in Riverine land; Have smiled forth a welcome to each lovely face Which has lent charm and spirit the meeting to grace. Urana, Colombo, and dark Billabong, For their daughters the prize of beauty have won, From the North come M'Niel, Lloyd, Burt and M'Graw [?] of [?] and [?] From the East, Watt and Thompson on [?] [?]. Then Murchison, Chapman and Miller press on. Of the [?] reap Of [?] The man who so lately on [?} did stand, And [?] far distant land. From Southern parts, [?] and [?] the dark, Come in pairs as the creatures entered Noah's Ark. Frank Murphy of [?] Hills with Findlay [?], Ere the home travelling sheep have raised [?] alarm, Dunlop, Black and Campbell, then Gronanibil Moore And the [?] of fair Batherwah, Next comes "Wardon Greene of the Ten Mile [?] fame," With many another imaginable name, From [?], the Devlins, Mair, Baylis and Meares, And dear Mother Elliot, o'er whom I shed tears, Then Dick, Tom and Harry; and when all is o'er, Drives in plucky Four-in-hand Featherstonshaugh, "The Maiden" by Basquin was easily won, "Sunbeam" in the Town Plate the "Witch" has outrun, Five start for the Hurdles, but spills the race mar, And Black's "Jack" is bested by Chapman's T.R. The Hack race is run for in heats, if you please. "Deception" beats "Whisper," and runs home with ease. The second day's come, and as fine as could be, For the Purse 'tis the "Witch" comes in first as we see, Whilst the Squatter's is won by the brown "Eagle Hawk," And "Kaffir" come in for the next at a walk. Chapman's "Ghost," the last victor, then put all to flight, And drove them to Ashcroft's in shades of the night. \--WHITEWASHED YANKEE.
