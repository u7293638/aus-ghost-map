THE SHIPMENT OF HORSES AND CATTUS Tn a book which we have receutly received on 'Horsebroeding for Farmers' the author, Mr. Alfred E. Pease, bewails th* fact that so larg* a proportion of the roadster norse* of tbe United Kingdom have to be imported from the Contiuent* and he point* out tnat, as th* British Government pays £35 tpiece for ordinary serviceable hacks for army r mounts, it ought to pay the farmers of England well enough to engage in horse breeding, if they would only make a study of it. Every remark of tho author in this connection applies with doable- fotce to th* suggestion that th* Australian live stock farmers, having the advantage of a mid climate and pleuty of land, shoald rnak* a se-ious effort to get a footing in the British markets. These colonies an good customers to England, and it is certain that, not only for military purposes, but also for general service, the British pur chasers of horses would xather deal jrith Australia than with the Continent. It is an altogether erroneous idea that daring the long voyage from these colonies to England horses must necessarily softer greatly and fall off seriously in condi tion. Th* Fidd recently published an article describing in detail the first shipment of New Soath Wales horse stock, which arrived two or three months ago in London by the steamer Celtic King. A olose examination showed that, beyond a braise or two of no serious momenjt, the animals were in excellent condition. It was noticed that several of them being country bred had not yet rubbed off their bush manners and tricks, and so it was decided that they should be kept ' nnder training for a few weeks before being submitted for sale, but as regards constitution and the evidences of having been well fed and well cared for thero was nothing to choose ' between the Australian horses aud an equal namber from other places which the caretaker had in hand at the same time. No particulars are yet to hand as to the prices which this shipment actually realized, but if any one convex, sanb with the business will compare the £35 paid by tho British Government for good, sound average horses with the remarkably low prices which are ruling in the Australian Colonies for similar stock, he will see at once that there ought to be a fair margin of profit after defraying all expenses of conveyance and of feeding during the voyage. Horsedealers are supposed to have a particularly keen scent for a bargain, aud it is said, by way of . a joke, that a British north country dealer can sometimes find pleasure in selling a spavined, kicking creature to his own father. If Australia can find means of sending, not such stock, ' but good, sound, naturally bred horses to the mother country, it is almost certain that the trade will prove to be a mutually advantageous one. Rough weather at sea is undoubtedly very hard upon horses, sheep, and cattle in coarse of transport. This is established conclusively by the dis* astrous result of the shipment of cattle by the Echuca, Particulars of the storm met with early in the voyage appear else where, and the facts narrated fully account for the heavy mortality which took place. It is most disappointing that this experimental shipment shoald have proved so unsatisfactory ; but under the circumstances is could hardly be otherwise. The severe experiences of the Cloncurry in taking round live stock of various kinds to Western Australia two or three weeks ago were equally dis heartening. Dr. Charles M. Deaue, whose letter from Albany appeared in our issue of J uly 31, wrote with very natural indig nation of the scenes which he wit nessed on Sunday, July 21, when no less than forty-one head of dead cattle had to be thrown over board. Ho did not notice, however, .or else he was not informed, that the evils of which he complained were Id largs measure due to a divided responsi bility. As Mr. Vasey, for the Steamship Company, explained in his letter subse quently, the practice ia that the shipper, and not the Company, docides how many anima's are to bo put into each pen ; and, as a matter of fact, there were in the Cloncurry three pens which were left empty because the shippers were satisfied that theie was ample room in the others. This, of course, does not alter tho fact that a great deal of apparently avoidable suffering took place. Tae responsibility of the Steam ship Company begins and onds with pro viding proper p-ns and a supply of water. If the shippers risk their live stock by putting so many into each pen that-, in the event of a storm, the animals injure one another, that is their own business. Bub it would be well for both shippers aud steamship owners to agree upon making such arrangements in future as will ronder hoavy loss and suffering, at any rato, ex ceedingly improbable. On board tbe Southern Cross, which sailed from Sydney several weeks ago with 550 bullocks, and other stock, tbe ca'tle were dis tributed in threes and fours, in well sheltered pens having diagonal divisions, so that anything like getting into a promiscuous heap, even in the evont of extremely stormy weather, was rendered virtually impossible. A few weeks ago our readers were in formed by cable of tbe main provisions auzge-ted by tie London underwriters to the British Board of Trade with referenco to the regulation of shipments of livo stock from Australia and New Zeolaud. It is of the utmost importance that this trade should be carried on upon safe and humane lines, and probably the Insurance Companies cau do more than any other agency to enforce attention to all needful precautions. At present there is ie England an agitation, headed by the Society for ihe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, having for its object the stoppage of the live cattle trafiic on tho Atlantic, at any rate during the stormy portions of the year. Most of tbe recorded atrocities of this trade might have been avoided if proper rules for tbe protection and partial isolation of the beasts daring transit had been stringently enforced The London underwriters stipulate in regard to the Australasian trade that there shall be in atten dance upon cattle one man for every twenty-five beasts. This surely is ample provision for proper attention. But in such a trip as that to Western Australia, as well as in the earlier por tions of the voyage to England, the cattle tenders are liable to become prostrated by sea-sickness. This was what hap pened iu the case of the Cljncurry, and the poor animals were thus in large measure deprived of the care of skilled ?xperts at she very time when they most needed it. It is evident, indeed, that, if the trade in live stock expands, a demand will spring up for the services of tbe men wh-; are at once good sailors and clever in handling and treating stock. So far as tho British Government is con cerned it takes but little heed of the oversea cattle traffic, save in tho matter of preventing th* introduction of disease into the United Kingdom. We printed last week the latest 'Port of London Transhipment Order of 1895,' which piovides among other things for the liberal us* of quicklime to destroy all possible sources of infection on.th* landing of cattle for slaughter. The deck arrangements, however, are subjects which are left almost entirely to th* car* and judgment of steamship-owners aud of shippers at the place of embarkation. An important point to be borne in mind by shippers is that all times of the year are not equally suitable for the transport of stock to Great Britain. This fact has been brought home with unpleasant fores in connection wilh tho Echuca's shipment referred to above. It is now recognised by the exporters that the most favourable season fordiapatcbing tho stock was not selected. Tbe best chance for Australian shipments must necessarily eome in the earlier months of the y«ar, when, owing to the rigours of the northern winter, British cattle cannot be fattened excepting at heavy cost, and the American trade ia hindered by stormy weather. By sending poultry for December and cattle for the succeeding months Australian shippers ought to make hand some profits. To this tnd united aud systematic action ia urgently needed. The Victorian Government, it will be noticed, intends to seek the co-operation of other Australian colonies in again calling for tenders for the conveyance of all sorts of produce, and; if reasonable terms should b* offered, it would be well for South Australia to respond promptly to this invitation. The Pastoraiisis' Association-.— It is not without cause that the Paatoralists' Association in its annual report and through th* address of iu President takes credit to itself for having done elfec tiv* wcrk on bohalf of those whom it represents. Brought into being with tho view of enabling those connected with stockbreeding to speak with one voice in matters affecting their welfare in place of having to deal individually with tho strong organization* formed in the in terests of shearers and station hands, it bas satisfactorily discharged its functions. Frm time to time it has been called upon to deal with delicate and difficult questions which have arisen, and the firm ness it has displayed in resisting what it has regarded as nnreasonablo demands has been tempered by a spirit of fairness which has won for it the confidence aud goodwill of the great body of the employes if not of tho whole of tha leaders of the Labour Unions. Now and then it has had a hard battle to fight, but its moderation and readiness to yield where concession was not in its opinion subversive of the just claims of tbe pastoralists have secured for it a large measure of success. At present it is enjoying a period of comparative tranquillity, and although it would seem that the cessation of hostilities is more in the nature of a truce than of a per manent peace, it ie to be hoped that it will be found possible to avert the renewal of conflict* which are disastrour to all concerned. The Association is able to point with satisfaction to the fact that shearers have this season offered no objection to tho terms offered either as regards the ratu per hundred or the arrangements affect ing employment. Two matters upon which the Labour Unions still profosa themselves dissatisfied are the conditions relating to the shearing of wet abeep and tha provision respecting certifi cates of competency. So far as the first is concerned the employers main tain that the existing form of agree men b is just to all, and has the approval of many trustworthy shearers.' The question is a technical one, upon which we do not care to express an authoritative opinion, but the onus of proving that it works unjustly rests upon those who object to it. As to the requirement thac a satisfactory discharge should be pro duced by the shearer, there is really not the slightest justificetion for the sugges tion that there is in it a latent design to humiliate the employe*. To speak of the certificate ot capacity and good conduct as the 'brand of slavery' is arrant nonsenso, and we doubt not that the common sen»o of the men generally revolts against such a characterization of what after all is a con venient and business-like arrangement. Mr. Stirling in his addross takes occasion to allude with regrot to what ho calls the absence of that confidence which should subsist between the Ministry and an Association representing a Urge majority of the producers ot South Australia's most important staple. What he specially refers to is understood to be the neglect of the Commissioner of Crown Lands to confer with the Associa tion in regard to the provisions of a Bill now before Parliament. It certaiuly seems a most anomalous and unsatisfac tory state of things . that the body best qualified to throw light upon pas toral bffiiirs should havo been entirely ignored. It does not follow that all the suggestions it might have seen fit to make should have been approved, but the Minister should at least have given it the opportunity of bring ing ' under his notice the chief difficulties . with which tho pastoraliot bos to grapple and of discussing freely with him the best methods of over coming them. The Association is entitled to speak with authority on behalf of the great body of leaseae of the Crown engaged in the breeding of stock, and there is reason to believe that its mem bership will in due course be largely aug mented from amongst the farmers who are more and more devoting themselves to this branch of industry. Iu many respects the interests of ? both those classes of producers are identical and their co-operation together wil be mutually beneficial. We congratulate the Association upon the position it occupies, and upon the fact tbat its relations with the great body of emplorl* in the pastoral districts are so har monious. It is much to be deplored tbat the good feeling which prevails in this province is not universal throughout Australia. It is true that no serious difficulty is likely to be experienced in getting tho wool off the aheeps' bock* this year in any of the colonies, but signs are not wanting that the animosity towards pastoralists which in previous years has been carried to such oxtreme lungths is not extinct. In the absence of evidence to support such a con clusion we refuse to attribute to the virulence of Unionists tuch atrocious acts as the burning down of the Mcmba woolahed aud tho whole sale poisoning of shearers at Bowen Downs, but reports ar* coming to baud of acts of vandalism which prove only too conclusively that a violent and vicdictivo spirit is still abroad which augurs ill for the future unless means are found for .restoring the good understanding which formerly prevailed between employers and employed. tXITXES FB03C E£ GoVEHSOBS.— His Ex oallency th* Luratenaut-Govemor has r* e*iv*d letters this week from Lord Garrws ton, aa ex-Goveraor of New South Wales, and Lord Ktutore, who »u recently Governor of South Australia.

Pastobalists' Association* of S.A. asd West Dabiixg. — The annual meeting of the Pastoralists' Association of South Australia and West Darling was held on Tuesday at the omess ia Carrie-street.

Some idea of th* general character of Mr. Rote's book, which h* baa published just prior to bis de parture for England, whet* h* is likely to spsnd tb* rest of his days, may be formed from th* intimation that its con* teats are composed of articles that hav* appeared ia tb* Victorian freetbought journal, the Liberator.

Different aspects of tho highly debatable tbemee to which the author nMa1dretwdhim*elf are treated under such headings as '* Soisoc* and Philosopaio Ma terialism,' 'The Theisi,' 'Tb* Mystio,' 'Coannoa Theistical aad Myatioal Argu meats,' ' Th* Auti- Vtatoriattstio Asaoetio,' 'dpaoeaad Tims,' 'Spjoki— Spirits of the Departed,' 'Theo«ophic, Msimeric, aad Hypnotic Assumptions,' *'M*n'a Keepoasi bility,' 'Ti«»tija,' 'L»nd Ownership,' ' L\baac and Capital,' aad ' The Ethics of Marriage and Generation.' Obviously a volume of this kind oaunot judiotously b* discussed ia detail ia a newspaper review, and it is no more our purpose to combat its theories than to commend them, heartily as ws approve of the writer's maxim —'It is falsehood which is always dangerous, bat truth never.' Same people may contend, however, that evea the revelatioa of oertaia verities should choose proper times aad appro priate places. Amongst these critics will be a ?amber oa whom Mr. Rom's writings will inflict psignaat pain, though some of th* 'new novelists' are quite as plaiaspoken as our South Auitraliaachampioa of freeshooght.

A Reua&sablk; Project. — Patent* hav* brea granted in tb* Australian Colonies and all the chief countries of tb* world for a method to be employed in elevating and storing the water of the sea for us* as a motive pow«r. The inventor is Mr. G. W.

Large volumes of sea water ar* elevated to a considerable height by utilizing a law of Nature, and an discharged at tb* top of the rock* into a r***rvoir for that purport.
