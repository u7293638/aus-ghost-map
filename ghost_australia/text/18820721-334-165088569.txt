THE OLD MAN'S GHOST. ————♦———— Several days ago a celebrated spiritualist came to Little Rock, and stated that before giving a public enter- tainment he would give a seance, where any number of a small invited circle could call up the spirits of their friends and converse with them. By mistake a man from down the river was ad- mitted, a man whose reputation for deed of violence would not place his spirit above par in the soul market. After listening awhile to rapping, horn- blowing, and gauze veil materialisation the bad man rose and said : "Sav, Cap'n, whar's the old man's ghost ?" " What old man ?"asked the medium. "My old man, the governor. Call him up." "What is his name ?" "Tom Bealick ; call him up." "I don't think we are in communica- tion with him to-night." "What's the matter ? — wire down ?" "No, the old gentleman is off on a visit.'' "Now, here, just shut up your ward- robe and turn on your light. If you don't give the old man's ghost a show, the thing shan't run." "Wait ; I'll see if he'll come," said the spiritualist. " If he raps three times he is willing ; if only once he has other engagements." A sharp rap sounded. "He is unwilling," continued the spiritualist. "Now, here," said the bad man, "that wan't my ole man's knock. Why, ef he'd hit that table he'd splintered it. Call him up," and, drawing a revolver, the affectionate son cast a severe look on the medium. "To tell the truth, I can't call him up." "Tell him that I want to see him. That'll fetch him." "No : he won't come : but I beg of you to be patient. Wait ; ah, he will come presently. He is here and desires to talk with you. He says that he is perfectly happy, and that he longs for the time when you will be with him. He is one of the rulers in the spirit land." "Cap'n, you're the infernalist liar in Arkansas." "Why so, sir ?" "Because the old man is in the city prison, drunk as a fool."—"Little Rock Gazette."
