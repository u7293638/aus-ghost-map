AN OLD SCRAP-BOOK. . Mrs. Ritchie, who knew, well most of tho literary celebrities of the last generation, has often spoken of certain grotesque drawings, the work of gentlo old Robert Browning (father of the poet), which haunted her when a child. A aUlulJ-UUUiV tuu ui mcau utuu iu(,o wttuiuv long ago tho property of a lady, who received , them from a godson of the poet. It is a curious c collection. The two beads we here reproduce be- J long to a series of at least forty, representing the j various tellers of and listeners, to a ghost story. "The extraordinary variety of expressions," writes one who has handled the originals, "the satur nine humor, melancholy, cunning, fear, and the hundred other emotions depicted on the faces, remind one of nothing so mi/eii as Browning's own great human gallery.

The quiet South London resident and member of York Chapel, Walworth, had an eye for faces not less keen than his son's. One can even detect some Walworth types in his grotesque men aud women." The old scrap-book also contains a good many drawings by Mr. Browning, sen., re presenting scenes in the law courts, whure crim inals and counsel show thtir wit. All bear the Inscription underneath, as in the two examples given. SKETCHES BY ROBERT BROWNING, FATHER OF THE POET.
