THE SUMMER EXHIBITION OF THE ROYA L A CA DEMY. (From a London Correspondent.) LONDON, May 21. It is with great pleasure that I find myself enabled to record the very marked superiority of the present exhibition of the Royal Academy over that of last year. One gains an impression that the show is a liner one from ones first glance at gallery No 1, and that impression is soon continued At Burlington house, as at the New Gallery, the liiiidacaiitsta are foremost this time, and the exhibition is remarkable for the number of new painters, men and women, with whom it makes us acquainted This has been called a vomits mans year, and justly so, it also brings into notice a particular school, concerning which I knew nothing until quite recently This is known as " the Newlyn school, so named from a village in Cornwall), him by Penzance, where a number of young artists have established themselves and whence come the delightful pictures of marine scenes and the life of the (Hhrrmeii which constitute an especial nt traction of the exhibition The influence of the serious careful methods taught in the Paris studios is plainly evident in the works of the rising " school, ' and, to use a homely phrase, it does one good to see such earnest art bestowed upon such wholesome, worthy sympathetic rational subjects as Mr Bromley, Mr 'I like, and Mr Stanhope Forbes have selected. rich in all the qualities of imagina- tion feeling, and human interest, for which we look in vain or, rather, do not look at all in the flimsy works of some of those artists who have made fame and fortune by the reiteration of sentimental, silly, or sensuous subjects, is Mr Bramley 8 "Saved" The poet's line, "Oft in a humble home a golden room is found, ' is the motto of a picture which needs none 'I he rode interior of a fisherman's dwelling the contrast between its rough plenishing and the rescued girl, with her refined face, slender figure, and elegant travelling dress, all dishevelled who sits, bait stupified with the past terror, scarcely awake to the present relief, in a wooden chair before the hospitably replenished fire, while the women, whose whole he is a light with the sea, tend her with ready, it rough, sympathy, and a peering anxious group about the door whisper among themselves about the farm liar details of the wreck, are admirably given ; the full sense and feeling of the scene and conveyed to the beholder Mr 'Luke's "All Hands to the Pumps' stirs one's heart by us intense reality and I power The vessel is only a little craft a fisherman's nil-the hands are but three but the picture 18 tragically grand, because it is so true, "Lives of men" are those at at the, the same with the terrible art is at its fiercest The men s figures are nobly drawn, the action is as fine as the feeling He should all ardently desire the spread of the Newlyn school, ' it we are to have such pictures as these from its members Mr Stanhope 1 arbes paints for us a sailor's wedding at the moment when "the health of the bride is given, with brio and vigour, hdohtv and force, but without the least touch of coarseness or vulgarity. His delineation of the fisherfolk is like Dickens's rendering of the Peggottya-faithful, but to the utmost sympathetic. Before I pass on to the works to which general consent assigns the position of " pictures of the year, I must mention, in connection with these charming sea pictures, Mr Adrian Stokes's Harbour Bar I have already told your readers that he has a very fine work at the New Gallery This is of an entirely different character, being full of sweet restfulness, but it equals the other in handling and in sentiment In the first room hangs Sir John Millais's "Murthly Hater, of which there is no good word to be said No one would glance at it twice if it were painted by an unknown artist And to emphasise it as a failure, we have in the same room two pictures by Mr Hook, which are as good as any he has ever painted, and show no traces at allot the "veteran" academic stage. Some there are who complain of Mr, Hook's pertinacious attachment to the class of subjects with which his name is inseparably associated , but I do not think he is ever completely satisfactory on the rare occasions when he deserts his shore scenes "The Seaweed Jinker" is a delightful picture, with the breath and the odours of the train it to our face), and his companion, "'He fowler's Pool, ' is worthy of its place 'I he still water where the reed shattered basin, where the happy birds assemble unconscious of their d nger, is strongly con- trasted with the heaving sea beyond the hill. The colouring is very much delayed, and the atmosphere is perfectly rendered "One can always breathe in a picture of Hook's, said a lady at the Press view and she was right I do not altogether agree with a distinguished art critic, who remarked, on being asked a question respecting some details of the president's pictures, " H hal s the good of discussing them" We might as well seriously analyse wax dolls'-but Ido think they are without interest, and that the Greek (girls play off at ball must be differently constructed from girls of an) country at this epoch if they could have maintained for a minute the attitudes in which they are placed, and also, that drapery at once so light of texture and so lavish of quantity would twist and cling about a figure in motion, but could not long itself nut and stream in the air after the fashion of Sir Frederick Leighton a sea-green young lady's garment. there was much curiosity about this picture among the private viewers, for it is the work which was commissioned for Manchester, and afterwards rejected by the town council in the "Sibyl' and the "In- vocation" the chief points are the draperies I do not think either figure suggests Greek art by its beauty or its impressiveness, but the drawing in both is undeniably line, and the scheme of colour, pale pink and purple, with which we are familiar in the presidents pictures, is admirably carried out The first room contains a very remarkable painting by Mr Seymour Lucas, who is not the only painter whose imagina- tion has been fired by the recent revival of interest in the Spanish Armada The incident which has li is selected for illustration from the stirring story of the great Elizabethan days is the surrender of Valder one which enables him to revel in the gorgeous colour and picturesque costumes of his especial predilection The catalogue gives the passage Iron Speed, of which the picture is the embodiment " Whereupon Pedro (de Valdez) hearing that it was the fiery Drake (ever terrible to the Spaniards, who had him in chase, with forty of his followers, came on board Sir frauds, his ship, where first giving him the course, he protested that he and all his, were resolved to die in defence had they not fallen under his power, whose valour and felicity was so great that Mars and Neptune seemed to attend him in his attempts " The scene is a thrilling one On the quarterdeck are the two groups, the grave, dignified, austere Sp miah commander, with his downcast retinue, including a tonsured monk in dark brown garb, and the ever victorious English Admiral, whole returning the ron/t1,orsaluteofhianobleadversar), a little in advance of his exultant officers the respective attitudes and expressions very tilling. The Spaniard holds but his sword There is proud despair in the curve of the lips which utter his complimentary sentence of surrender We do not see Drake a mee- this figure is thick set and clumsy I suppose there is authority for this life accessories are very striking, and the noble ship, with its canvas and its gear, no doubt perfectly correct, is eminently stately and picturesque I think it is a pity that Mr. Vicat Coles's picture, " The Summons to Surrender," which takes for ilaaubject au Immediately preceding Incident of the same episode, was not hung side by side with Mr Seymour Lucas's No injustice would have been done to either, and the visitor would enjoy a double pit asure by following the historic story through its momentous stages It is from Kingsley's Westward Hot that Mr Vient Colt has drawn his inspiration. His picture shows a cause that of Mr Seymour Lucas shows us all get It is Drake who speaks " " I fell in (God be thanked !) with a side h great galleon, and in it good booty, which the Dons, his fellows, had left behind. like faithful and valiant comrades, and the Lord Howard let slip past him, thinking her deserted by her crew I have sent to Dart- mouth a sight of noblemen and gentlemen, and Valder himself, who, when I sent my pinnace aboard, must needs stand on ina punctilious and propound conditions. I answered him I had no time to tell with him if he would needs die, then I was the very man for him, it he would live, then stand still r i He sends again, boasting that he was Don Pedro Valdez, and that it stood not with his honour, and that of the Dons in his company I replied for my part that I was Francis Drake, and my matches burning Mr Vital Coles picture also glows with colour, it is of wider scope than that of Mr See our Lucas's, and in it the quarter deck in the Spanish commanders, carrying the resplendent standard of the king dom of GasttUe and Aragon, and the sacred banner under which the great fleet sailed. Drakes pinnace is alongside, the barley is in progress, seamen gaze from the bulwarks into the crowd of sail, seeking the flag of the terrible "sea dog the spirit of the scene is in the picture. Some of the critics say this work is a falling off on the part of the artist, but I cannot see it It may be that it does not possess the beauties of composition which made The Pool of London ' so memorable, but, to me at least, it is more interesting I suppose one reason why China sure be welcome in a picture is because they cannot be made "and life ' Whether in dock or all-out, whether in all their bravery or in the utmost ruin of wreck, there is an inseparable human interest attached to them, and that interest is vastly increased when the ships are stages, whereon important acts from the drama on which no drop scene or green curtain ever falls have been played in close proximity to Mr. Vicat Cole's picture I was much pleased to had a very charming work by Mr. A. Quinton, whose industry and talent are being rewarded by a steady progress in reputation. His "Elstead bridge, Surrey," is a beautiful picture. Of its fidelity I can speak with confidence, for I know the bridge and its environment, its delicate, true, masterly handling and poetical sentiment are evident to oil. The water and the clouds all moving-are quite admirable. Mr. Dickaee'a " Passing of Arthur" has no claims to admiration that I can discover-, except that the artist Ima rendered very well the greenish hues produced by moonlight. We always know what to look for in a picture by Mr Henry Moore, and we are rarely disappointed " As when the sun doth light a storm " is a delightful example of this artist in his most expressive and vivid style It is all grey and white, but what diversified grey and what sun pierced white The storm has been terrible, and still " the stormy winds do blow," but the drift and the din, the rush and the roar, are subsiding, and the sun in his strength is putting these smaller things to Dight. The movement of wind and wave is masterly. I know no work of Mr. Henry Moore's which I prefer to this fine picture I come now to two pictures, in each of which there are qualities so rare and exceptional that they would, to my thinking, cover any technical faults, had I the skill to define such , but I cannot see that there are defects in either " The Prodigal Son," by Mr. Swan, or "The Phantom Ship," by Mr W L Wylie These two artists have risen in a short time to considerable rank and that the pictures exhibited by each of them this year will send them up higher I do not doubt. By far the most poetical composition in the exhibition is Mr Wylie. "Phantom Ship," while I, individually, would rather be the possessor of Mr. Swan's picture, "The Prodigal Son," than own any, or all, of the pictures of the year " The former shows us a smooth sea and a stately ship, with her sails set At her bows and in the rigging lights are burning, and their rays are reflected in the grey water. The good ship is making a prosperous roy age-, the winds, the waves, and the vines are propitious , but in the truck behind her a mist has risen , it reaches even to her shrouds, and in it there hangs, through it there glides rather than sails, a ghostly vessel, while, distinct, only softened by the mist wreaths, a ship with the lines and the rigging of the time at the great Dutch admiral, the doomed ship which carries the Flying Dutchman and his crew. And the night is fair, and the sea is smooth ia this a portent ' All is quiet in the living ship The perpetual tempest that bullets tbeghostlv craft which forms the prison house of the condemned touches her not yet is she doomed to disaster, according to the legend, and in the picture there is tragic poetry Mr Swan's picture was exhibited at the Allora last year, and it attracted at once the attention of the French critics, who recognised with generous praise the technical excellence of the work and the originality of the conception That the pigs which were tended by the Prodigal Son of our Lord's parable, in the last stage of his decadence, should furnish a subject to a painter of animals is no more wonderful than that the " possessed " swine of the Gadnrenes-so offensive to Professor Huxley should have done the same , but that so fine a picture should be produced in which p gs are given the fullest significance is more than a little surprising I confess it astonished me, for I have got out of the way of expecting that any illustration of a scriptural subject will be greatly ing, and Mr Longs "Rinsing of Jairus Daughter" had not encouraged me to look for improvement in this direction But the first look at Mr. swan's picture revealed Its rare merits, and with every moment the sense of them grew. It the treatment be, as I am told it is frankly 1 reach, ' then let us have as much French treatment for the future as a possible it it will give us such pictures. The scene is a bare stubbly field, all brown and dark to lonely and forsakes that it might be at the end of the world, as people thought of that final term before they knew the merry world was round and they might sail for evermore " The sky, dark too, and pitiless, lowers gloomily on the horizon line A little stony ravine breaks the brown blank in the foreground, and scattered about in various attitudes of slumbering repletion are a number of black swine The grouping of these animals is most admirable Everyone of them is made to tell the story of utter plays us content in its own individual way) A Ion,;, mt pig lies, with the leech-like His news we have often seen just in front, with two or three of his fellows " anyhow " about him, while another lies on the stony bank, his head bringing down, with the indifference to possible suffocating of a man dead drunk, Perhaps the most expressive of all is a black glutton sleep, with the remnants of some cornstalks and poppies hanging out in his mouth The line in turn) been unable to finish his meal On the ground above the stone strewn rift sits a forlorn human being, his back is turned to the spectator, it is naked, but there is some rugged clothing on his belly , his arms are raised, and we know that his face is hidden in his hands 'I he painting of the man's figure is very line, the flesh is real, the man is young still one sees that in the muscles and lines, wanted and tired as he is hunger, fatigue, utter detection, the bitterness of soul that has come to the Starving prodigal, who tends the well led swine, and sees them sleeping the sleep of repletion around him, are all expressed in some inexplicable way, known only to the heaven born artist, in the figure and the attitude of the man with the hidden face Not yet had its inspiration of grace come to him. He sits there, with his face turned, no doubt, in the direction of the lost, abandoned home. As yet all is darkness overhead, around, and within-but there is a faint a very faint, gleam on the far horizon, and we know what that means He will see it soon, when his hands drop from before his eyes, and then he will " arise and go to his father " What with the poetry, the meaning, and the painting of this picture-for no words can over-praise the pigs, and the brilliant but Beauty poppies and the harsh herbage in the lore ground-it is altogether fascinating. Mr Orchanlson'd "anning Duke' becomes the place of honour in the largest gallery, and is certainly a fine painting. Although the subject possesses only an abstract interest, and is even more cynical than the scenes of domestic shipwreck to which the artist has devoted burnell of life, Unless we are permitted to suppose that the contemptuous abstraction of the suit! young man who works in a chair at the heart of his magnificently appointed table, indifferent to the enthusiasm with which his flatterers are drinking his health in priceless wine, quaffed from priceless glasses, is caused by the sudden irruption into that scene of luxurious revelry of some unbidden guest, n ghost of the sweated and dead pnBt, n betrayed love, a broken trust, u di arl mothering of those things which may and in their pleasure at rich men's tables, and whom not the most gorgeous and insolent of turkeys can turn out we cannot care about this youthful route. All lies splendidly dressed friends and flatterers are of the well known type, they are the " Adelphi guests " of the studies, we have met them at Madame Hccainier's, and they were present on the famous occasion of the historical insult to Voltaire. The details of the picture, which is chiefly an arrangement in yellow and blue, are -carried out with the customary skill of the artist. the period is early Li ins August
