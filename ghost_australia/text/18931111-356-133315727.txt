" GHOSTS " AT HEAMPTON COU'RT * No small sensation has been caused at Hampton Court Palace by the re peated assertions that ghostly visitants have lately been seen in some of the rooms and corridors of the building. The building has on several occasions been subject to similar visionary visitations, and Mr. Law, in his his tory of Hampton Court, records the supl)posed perambulations of the shades Sof Mrs. Penn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Howard, the two latter having had the misfortune to be con sorts of Henry VIII. On this occasion Queen Jane has reappeared, and is accompanied, says a correspondent at Hainpton, by her sister in misfortune, Anne ]3oleyn. It is asserted by ser vants in the Palace that the ladies named have been seen gliding through doors and walls, that their footfalls traverse the rooms in the middle of the night, and that they have even carried away the pillows from under the heads of sleepers. Two servants are leaving the Palace in consequence, and others are asking for the imme diate appearance of the Government exorcist.
