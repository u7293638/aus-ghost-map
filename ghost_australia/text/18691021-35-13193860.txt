It is with great pleasure, too that your committee leara of tho success attending the labour of those Brethren who havo gone forth from this institution to settled pastorates, and especial mention may be made of tbo settlement of Mr Browne in the township of Windsor, where, under very promising circumstances, ho waa publicly Bet apart to the Ministry in August last Of the students who oro now in tho College your comm! tee loara with satisfaction of the acceptability with which their ministrations ore received, notonlyin the preaching stations regularly supplied by them, but also in tho pulpits of our own and other churches, which they arc called upon occasionally to fill " Your committee note, too, with satisfaction, the increased sym- pathy manifested by Ihc churches towards the Home Missionary bocitty trusting tha* present liberality is but an earnest ola much larger st-pport, of which this society greatly Btands lu n>.ed During the past few years churches and paBtorB havo been multiplied by the labours of tata society, and as we contemplate the growing appreciation of our principles, with new spheres of labour opening to us in the bush and country districts, wc believe that by God's blessing this society, if odequatcly eupported, has o career before it of honourable and increasingly useful service in the cause of our Baviour. "The published report of tho London Missionary Society shows, too, the confidence with which ita claims ore received by the churches, the donations of the children in our Sunday Echools affording especial cause for sincere thanktalness to God. "Inthue reviewing the condition of our churches and their auxiliaries, your committee would again own, that while there i< much to deplore in our lack of service, there is very much for which to bo truly gratified, and your committee therefore hail with gladness the return of these meetings of tho Union, bchev ing that through their influence, by tho Bil ino blessing, churches already united in themselves m laboura of love, may become more closely united to each other, and BO may show forth that spiritual strength in thiir operations whioh is ever the result of sanctified union, " "i our committee were requested by the Assembly of October last to consider the desirability of having a model trust deed for the Congregational Churches of New South Wales, and it is with gieat pleasure that your committee report that through tho un tiring zeal of a few of their number, together with adequate legal assistance, they arc able to lay before you the draft of a deed which they trust will meet with your unanimous oporoval " "V our committee have not lost sight of tho expressed wish of the I; mon at previous meetings to establish a magazine in con- nection with our denomination, but havo been prevented from taking any steps in the matter through the still existing difficulty of securing a suitable editor, " In respect to the Queensland immigration of South Sea Islanders your eommittco havo not deemed it necessary to take any action, the subject having been fully discussed and acted upon by the représentât]* es of the different Churches in Sydney .your committee have toreport thatthcRev A Brown, M A late of Nerth Shore, has sent in his resignation as o member of the Union " The April meetings of the Union were held at Campbelltown and were well attended by both pastors and delegates, who were received by the Campbelltown friends with moro than ordinary boipitality It may be especially noticed that at their meetings the loy secretary reported that he had procured a suitable hox for the reception of the trust deeds of the churches which bov was to be depositea in the safe of the City Bank, having two separate locke, the key of one of which is to be kept by the Chiirinan of the Union for the time being, and that of the other by one of the secretaries lho* following resolution was then unani- mously passed,-' That it be a recommendation to the churches in placing their deeds for safe custody in the hands of the ofheers of the Union, to obtain a voto of the Church as lo the parties for whore such trust deed is to be held, and upon whose order it is to be wilhdrawn ' " In conclusion, your committee would implore that m all your deliberation you may hove granted to you the presence of the Spirit of love ond truth , so that in this cv entful period when others arc beholding the Churches in which they trust shaken to their foundation it may be yours to commend the religious liberty wc prize so highly, hy showing forth a calm and holy ii ust, not m creeds or in church organisations, but in the Lord Jesus Christ himself, that Having Ills presence to guide your thoughts and fill your hearts you may indeed glorify Our rather which is in Heaven " Mr R G READING, treasurer, read his financial Btate ment, which showed a balanco in favour of the Union.

Mr R NOTT brought up tho report of the committee appointed nt the last October sittings of the Assembly, to prepare a model trust deed, under which all properties of the denomination which should come into possession of the Union Bhould m futuro bo placed The decumont having been read by the clerical secretary, it waa ordered to be printed, ona copies distributed to the momoers of the ABBembly Its consideration was postponed until 11 o'clock on Friday morning Tho advisability of forming a provident and superannua tion fund, for the benefit of aged ministers, or tho widows and orphans of deceased ministers, next occupied tho atten- tion of the Assembly Messrs.

In the evening, the Chairman of the Union, tho Rev Tiiovt IS JORNSOV, delivorcd the following;address - DFAR BRETHREN AND TRIENDS -J Since the ministers and delegates of the Churches last met in this place, another )ear, with all its vicissitudos, its opportunities, and ita mercies, has passed away, and though it has been marked by nothing very extraordinary to us as a dénomination, jet wo havo much for which to bo thankful Our ministers have all been kept in life, and for the most port havo been preserved m health, and in the prosecution of their duties, our Churches, " abiding in peace," have been to somo extent " multiplied In all our sanctuaries tbe meanB of grace have been supplied 1 wo now churches hove been opened, and set apart for Divine worship One biloved brother (late a student in Camden College), has been ordoined to the work of the holy ministry, amidst encou îaging prospects of usefulness Toi the comfort of peace, the signs of progress, and tho amount of good effected through the Divine blessing, we offer our unfeigned and heartfelt thanks to Almighty God, and piaj "prosper thou the work of our hands upon us, 0, prosper Ihou our handvwork " But tho ycai, though, fw the most part, quiet and calm wifh us, has been an unusually eventful one to the in- terests of Christ's Kingdom at homo It was well said, in tho report of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, at its meeting in London during the month of Moy, that,-"Public opinion upon ecclesiastical questions has ripened with the rapidity which linds its parallel in the tudden outbreak of spring, after a long and dreary winter, when the germinant properties of nature develop thom Bclves into various forms of life and beauty Principles, which were Eovvn in hope by devoted men, who went forth weeping, bearing precious seed, have sprung up and brought forth fruit abundantly " Some of us have known whot it wns to hold thoso principies which hove now become so popular when there seemed but little prospect of their ii6ing into the ascendant FO poon Trom the changes which have taken place in Great Britain, with refertneo to ecclesiastical establish- ments, wo should be encouro0ed, if we havo and hold principles that are true, to hold them firmly, however un- popular thej may seem lo be Be eure a true principle can never die Even true iiinciplo has a ger nanant power m it, ond, however deeply buried beneath the cumbrous weight of conventional opinion,custom, prejudice or i¡,noninec, seoner or later, and probably much Booner than appearances would seem to indicate, it will find its way to the surfaco It is vcrj noteworthy how (he orgumontE ngun t tbe lniquitj of nil religious establishments were qui^tl) soiking into the public mind, and when th« clock of dtstinj sti u<-l tho people were found npo and read) for the chan0o Let us then have faith m oui distinctive principles, faith in truth, and faith m God na the God of Truth But, whilo we cannot be un ilfccfed by the stupendous chonges which have recentl) taken plnee in reference to ecclesiastical affairs and questions nt home-wuen such mighty tidal waves of sentiment or flowing over the notions, and obliterating one lent bairiers ond distinctions , while our hearts glow wilh jubilant thankfulness that we have lived to seo these times, and while WL feel encouraged as we look forward to still farther and fuller developments of Ihose principles which, ns a denomination, wo most sacredly cbeiish and most firmly hold-j et, as wo are so distant from Ihe scene of wnrfore and of victory, and have not the soiue reason to complain-(there being, happilj no religious Establishment in this land)-wo should judge it unwise to import cither the tontrov elsies or the unseemly strife« which Ihose controversies almost invariably cngendci into the midst of socielv here Not to havo taken somo nofice of these things, and not tohave expressed our thank- fulness en this occasion, would havo exposed UB to tho chorgoof disloyally to our cherished convictions , to do or foy more new, micht seem unnecessary and unwise. Let us therefore for the present, " rest and be thankful " Knowing, what is expected of your Chairman, I have looked forward to those meetings of the brethren with con- siderable solicitude "\\\ hat we all want to know, I am sure is how we may lut sirvo God aDl our generation and if what I moy now Eny shall leid to earnest thought, sh ill tut Vis on the track of íncjuiry, or shall help us to rcnlt o more vividly our responsibilities, wo shall not have come together in vam, and when the meetings aro over I trust ive shall return to our scvcrnl spheres, te work not le«s entncfctly nnd hopefull}, and therefore, not IcssBUCce.-sfullv, in tho eñuEO of our div me and glorious Lord Leaving then, the tculnm of speculative fiuth, and the controversies of thofimcp, to thotc moro ac ¡uainted with their m} steiics, and 1 ettci qualified to grapple with their difficulties, I shall confino myself to thoso things which are moro immediately practical rinding ourEclv CB then m HUB land and deeply interested in its progmo, anxious for the wcllbemg of its inhabitants, and for tho development of its resources, what do vee «co around us, onl what H our duty ns citizens, as litiioti-, rnd as Chnslians, with respect to what wo Beor1 lhe outlook wo have been enabled to take of tho moral and spiritual condition of the people (for it is with this that we as a religious community are now more especially con- cerned) is by no means consoling From all reliable sources of information, as, for instance, tho charges of our judges and tho reports of our criminal proceedings, it is evident that crime is rampant in the land, robbery and murder are of frequent occurrence. Neither life nor property are sacred in the eyes of many of the people In some districts of tho colony gross ignorance prevails, while generally drunkenness and licentiousness abound , Sabbath despera- tion, profaneness, blasphemy, and a reckless infidelity are to be seen on every hand, and such is the indifference manifested to spiritual things, that God and His claims, Christ and His Gospel, the Holy Ghost and the Holy Bible are quietly ignored Of multitudes of tho people it may be said with truth, they neither fear God nor regard man, they are enthraled and engrossed by the materialism around them, they live in and for tho present, and are making no preperation whatever for tho life beyond This being the case, our duty as part of tho Christian community is plain. We cannot contemplate such a state of things without being deeply moved, and surely we have tho weightiest reasons, and tho most urgent motives, in common with our fellow Christians of every name, to endeavour to counteract those evils To show the impor- tance of this, the difficulties in tho way, and how those difficulties are to bo met and overcome, will bo the object of our further remoiks ra this paper. It will always be true, that while " righteousness exalteth a nation, sin is tho reproach," tho weakness, and ultimately tho " destruction of any people " " Tho nation and king- dom that will not servo thee," says tho Prophet Isaiah, "shall perish, yea those nations shall be utterly wasted " And all history proves that this is true. We have not to do here, however, with tho vices and crimes peculiar to on ancient nation, or an effete and worn-out civilisation, but with the fresh and vigorous outgrowths of a young and thriving people, and if we can benefit the present generation, we shall be benefiting the colony for all coming time We are here, as it has been said, at the beginning of things. We are now to lay tho foundation of the mighty superstructure which further ages will build up, to carve tho channels and to prescribe the grooves through which tho streams of its future life are to flow. Great are our privileges. O ' that wo may bo wise to improve them, that we may " understand tho signs of the times, and know what Israel ought to do." But if our privi- leges aro great, so aro our responsibilities. Opportunity now waits upon us-a great and eftectual door is now open to us, which no one can shut. Let us beware lest, by our incapacity, 01 our indisposition to enter, we allow it to close of itself If we act strongly end unitedly now, wo may do much to stamp the character of the colony and to determine ita destiny for all coming time. Nor IB this lesa important, when we consider tho influence of this colony on the regions beyond That New South Wales IB destined to be a great country, and to play an importent part in the world's future, we havo no doubt, that it will be peopled and ruled by the Anglo-Saxon race seems equally certain. It WUB not by accident, we may bo sure, that these lands carno under British rule Indeed, there is nothing accidental in human history, either as regards nations or individuals, " What nro accidents with us ore purposes witn God." It was not for our national aggrandisement then, but for the working out of Divine purposes in the social, the moral, and the spiritual regene- ration of the race, that BO largo a portion of the earth'8 surface and BO great a number of its inhabitants wore brought under the power of Great Britain It docs not require much of the prophet's insight to perceive that the destinies of the world are to a great extent bound up with tho destinies of tho Anglo-Saxon race What that race is the world will be. That race seems likely to be the predominating power in the world's future It is everywhere spreading its influence, everywhere pushing its conquests, everywhere winning its victornes Let it but plant its foot upon the shore, and its first settle- ment is made The end may then be predicted—before long it will claim the territory as its own Older nations and people of softer mould must, and do, give way before it. Already it has planted its flag in almost every clime, and wherever it goes it takes its language and its literature, its science and its laws, its institutions and its religion This race is in possession of this land, and perhaps tho wildest dreamer never supposes it will pass out of their hands And as they are here, and have evidently so important a part to play, how desirable that they be brought under the restraining and quickening influences of the Gospel of Christ Let there be a strong and enlightened Christian Empire established here, and how widely will its blessings be diffused around With what a power of good will it act upon the islands of the Southern Seas, and upon tho teeming millions of pagans and heathens in India and China beyond. lhat there are difficulties connected with this enterprise all will admit. Indeed, nono know so much of their appalling magnitude ns thoso who havo spent then days and nights ra trying to overcome them. There aro dif- ficulties arising from our common nature as men, which are substantio'ly the aomo in every age and in every land, of which we do not now particularly epeak.^We here confine our attention moro especially to thoEo peculiar to our people and our times There are amongst us, for instance, tho thriftless, who, having failed at home, have come here in the forlorn hope of getting on, but who find that the conditions of success are much the same in every place , the enterprising, who have come to push their way, to win a competence and return, the ambitious, who finding all tho avenues to distinction preoccupied in the old country, have come hero with the intention of climbing to the highest places of wealth and influence, the reckless and the un- steady, who have been sent out by their friends, in tho desperate hope that, when severed from thoir old associa- tions, they might moko a fresh start, and live a now life, to soy nothing of thoso of whom much might bo Bald, but which it is bcBt should be forgotten. Looking at tbo varieties and admixtures of chaiacter, of nation, and of faith, at the fast living and tho feverish excitomont BO common, which is so detrimental to tho habit of serious thoughtfulness, without which thoro can bo no staid, intelligent, religiouB character at all, l8 it matter of BUI prise that the work of evangelisation should be specially difhcult and slow r One great hindrance to tho spread of Christianity omomrst us anees from the restless and unsettled habits of tho population Nothing is moro discouraging to the Church, and moro disheartening to the miniater, tuan the shifty and the migratory habits of tho people Just as we get to know them, and to hope we are doing them some good, they are gone from our reach and our influence, and we see them no more. IhisiB one of tbophaBea of lifo at present in the land- especially in this city and its suburbB -which time may remedy, but which meanwhilo IB very detrimental to the religious character of our population It will be well for the Churches, and for all concornod, when the peoplo havo had timo to form strong personal attachments, and to got a fixed, aa vvoll as a " local habita- tion and a name " Another hindrance te our work arises from the scepticism that is so common and wide-spread in our day. That there should be a large amount of scepticism in this land will surprise no one who takes a wide view of tho character of our population, — of the classes from which they have sprung—the motives which have brought them here, and tho state of things existing in our midst According to an inspired writer, it is the fool that hath said in his heart there is no God , and, generally speaking, it will be found that those who think it a merit to mock at God and at all things sacred, have never either diligently read, or earnestly and deeply thought upon the matters about which they so glibly dispute Their infidelity arises, not so much from thought, as from tho want of thought, not so much from tho conclusions of the intellect, as from tho state of tho moral feelings, not so much from either the character or the culture of tho mind, as from tho disposition of tho heart. And though by no means formidable in itself, yet, by its bold and daring utterances, its boasted freedom of thought, and ita happy deliverance from what it is pleased to call tho moro anti cpiated forms and follies of belief, it is peculiarly fascinating to the young who are many of them glrcl to bo liberated from the restraints of religion, the scruples of conscience, and the fear of God But there is a subtler, and, perhaps, a more dangerous form of scepticism affecting the minds of many of our people which does not amount to positive opposition to the truth, which, nevertheless, unfits them for looking candidly at it. If they have not altogether lost their con- fidence in tho Gospel, they have not now a deep, ingenuous, unhesitating, and unquestioning conviction of its realm and necessity. Perhaps this is not surprising when we remember the depraved tendencies of our nature, the spas- modic activity of the human mind in these days, the wide- spread influence of sceptical ideas through tho Press, and the controversies, rationalistic, ritualistic, and scientific, which of late years have been going on. We are not of those who subscribe unhesitatingly to the sentiment of the poet, that a " little knowledge is a dan- gerous thing," but we have often marvelled with what haste people in their ignorance, or at best but half know- ledge have arrayed the facts of science against tho teach ings of revelation, as though they could ever be really op- posed the one to the other. True science we hail. Its dis- coveries and facts will always be found to harmonise with the broad and genuine teachings of tho Bible. But there is such a thing as "science falsely so called " or as true science but half understood, and, as we all know, a half truth may be in its consequences as disastrous as a whole error. But we have no need to distress ourselves about the developments of science, as though any discoveries now to be made would overturn the foundation of things. It is instructive to observe how completely tho Bible anticipates tho various forms of antagonism which are brought against it from age to age, and how little it is moved by all the rage and insolence of its adversaries. With calm majesty and grace it still holds on its way, shedding a mild and benign light upon tho great problems of existence, guiding all who will submit to its teachings into the harbour of eternal repose. Lot us have faith in God, and we need " fear no evil " "In qiuetness and in confidence shall bo our strength." i If v/e n ifetnko neit, we may nlreadj Bto m tho Heavens the signs of a letter dav lho pulse ol the publie mind beotB ii on heal hy th n it did People a o beginning to find that mere negations do not satisfy- that the mind requirei îeailive tiuth in ordei to its comfort and repose When then fore tbcfc ck tide of doubt which of la'o htvo dam- med our tky have piifid avvij, it will be, seen that evon Ile f ccj lieitm that bus provai'td, bus not been without its uses, uaj.lbutithiu had UB plaioin God s plan of educa lion, end has bi en made «¡ub°ervicnt to tho interests of His kingdom "W ith the honest and sincero doubter, we must bo patient, tender, kind, leading him into tho light ns ho is ablo to beor it In mci tmg his difficulties, and in establish- ing mm in lho truth, wo must account no labour too ardu- ous, und no sacribco too great Anothir, and a much more formidable hindrance we en counter in tho indifference to religious things that charac tentes so many of the people, they have not sufficient inte- rest in the weightiest of all matters as even to oppose them The causes of this indifference, I apprehend, are not far t> seek Some having succeeded in improving their social position, have adopted such a style of living, and have found such associations, that they care not now to be seen too frequenty at church, or to be known as closely identi fled with religious, objects Others not succeeding to their expectations have become disheartened and discouraged perhaps oleo soured in temper, and out of love with all things sacred as well as civil Many too finding themselves hee from the restraints of home and friends, and not settling down at once with some religious society, and going heartily into the work of tho Church as soon as they arrived, havo relinquished tho habit of attendance on religious worship, and thus, giving way to spiritual sloth, now "care for none of these things ' We frequently meet with indivi duals, most respectably connected, the children of Christian parents, who themselves were members of Churches at home, who either come out without letters of transfer, 01 who keeping thora back at firs!, and remaining "unat- tached,' have fallen back into tho lanka of the woild 1 hese arc now amongst the moBt difbcult to roach, or to benefit by the Gospel Nothing that wo hove to deal with is so discouraging, so hopeless as this indifference It hangs upon us like n depressing atmosphere, paralysing all our efforts It is said by some, that tho working classes are drifting further and further away from the Churches, and from all religious organisations and enterprises Whether this be true, I am not prepared to say , I doubt, however, whether they ore less religious as a class then those above them, or more difficult to reach But, as an honoured brother is to submit to you his views as to the best method of reaching the working classes, I will not forestall what he may say by any further remarks upon that subject now A further and a ecrious hindrance to the spread of the Gospel arises from the want of reverence m tho people generally, and especially m the young This is ono of the iirst things that strikes an observant stranger whon ho londB on our shores Irreverence is, no doubt, moro or less a characteristic of most young communities where thero aro few antiquities, and but little to oprjeol to the orgaa of veneration. In older communities the ruins of ancient abbeys, and churches, and religious houses, and tho ox lBtenco of shrines that havo boen frequented by the elevout for ages, ore all eloquent of tho past ns well as of the future They were embodiments of the religious feelings ond sentiments of tho times, and the associations and recollections connecfed with them greatly tend to foster the feeling of reverence in the mind But hero everything is new -our cities and towns aro all new, our habitations, many of them stately and imposing, are all new, our churches are all now I like to worship in an ancient Boncluarv, covered with ivy of ages, whieh, ever greon, is a beautiful emblem of the everlaslwg life ministered te and cherished within But our young people have, manv of them, never seen these things,-they havo never felt the charm of worshipping in the same sacred edifico where their ancestors for ages towed m prayer, whero they had visions of the beautiful city, whero they saw the face of God ond of His throne And neither tho style of our cccleBiastical edifices, nor their associations, are sufficiently venerable to awo the mind of tho worshipper as is desirable Rev erence, howover, is an important ally to devotion, and reverence for God's truth, for God'B house, for God's service, ond for God's servants is calculated to lead the mind to a feeling of roverenco for God himself Ihe want of respectful deference for superior excellency, and of reverence for venerable and rnghteous age so charac- teristic of many of the young people of this colony, is not only very painful to witness, but it mdicatos a state of mind very unfavourable to tie reception of the Gospel We must aim, therefore, m our exhibition of the truth, and m our manifestations of tho religious hfo, le let thom seo that there is something beautiful, venerable, and sub lime about sacred things,-that thore is a charm about serene and cheerful godliness not to be found elsewhere. Wo much need m our democratic society, and with our democratic institutions and tendencies, all the conserving influences of a deep, true, serious, ond earnest religious life Are all our modes of worship, and our mani- festations of (he religious life BO well calculated to awo the mind as they might bo i IB the church likely to gain upon the respect and veneration of tho young by its closo and intimate alliance with the pleasure- seeking and popular nnuEemtnt-loving spirit of the day ? I havo no quarrel with tnese ministers and religious people who, no doubt from the best of motives, givo their countenonco and assistance to such things , but I havo a feiling that it is making religion very cheap, and that the amusing dialogue and the comic Bong do not well fit with the venerablencss of religion, which has to do with tho everlasting concernments of the soul It may be well enough to " become all things to all men that we may save some," but the gains must bo great to compensate for the loss of sacredness which the Church sustains by her apparent countenance of the questionable practices which prevail m what is called the religious world in the present doj. In pointing out the hindrances to our work, and to the spread of religion amongst the people, 1 muBt not-with my convictions, I daro not-omit to mention, tho drinking customs and habits of the day Whatever may be our views OB to the remedies proposed for tho counteraction as to tho removal of tho evil, in ono thing we aro all agreed, viz., as to the magnitude of tbo evil itself. Our Judges ond magistrates tell us that drunkenness is tho cause, directly or indirectly, of three-fourths of the crime com- mitted in the land, and that if we could make the people sober their occupation would be gone, for not less than thiee-fourths of all the cases with which they have to deal spring directly er indirectly from intemperance And do not many of our troubles in the Church arise from the same cause? And until this giant will is smitten in the forehead we shall continue to have a plentiful harvest of enmo in the land, troubles will be continually cropping up in our Churches, and the success of our work will continue to be retarded. It would not become mo, as your Chair- man, to abuse your confidence, by taking advantage of my position to hurl anathemas against any class of men in our community, nor am I disposed to do so, as to charge the peoplo in this colony with being moro intemperate in their habits than tho people at home, for I do not believe they are. Nor am I going to denounce all men as unfaithful to their convictions who have not arrived at the same conclusions as myself , but I do hope to see the day when public opinion, and especially tho pubho opinion of our Churches and of all peoplo profcssing godliness, shall be, as I think, sounder and more enlightened on this question I om persuaded it is a question with which the Church, for us own interests as well as for the good of the community, must ultimately deal, and tho sooner it docs so in a wise and lemperato manner the bettor. Many I know are anxiously considering tho matter-they are almost per- suaded-I would to God they wore altogether convinced Let tho Church bo thoroughly instructed on this subject, let its conscience bo once roused and its sympathies engaged, and the days of this monstrous evil of intemperance will he numbered But how, it may be asked, are all these difficulties and hindrances to be removed or overcome ? Not much I fear IB to bo hoped in the way of improvement from our young men's mutual improvement societies and Christian associations, as at present constituted There may be ex- ceptions to lie rulo, but, as a rule, they havo not been productive of BO much benefit OB the) might have been cither to Church or people When they interfere with the habit of attendance upon tho week-night BBIvices, or foBter m tho young a state of mind unfavourable to the SOHOUB consideiation ond reception of roligiouB truth, they aro un- doubtedly on evil They have been of unquestionable scrvico in preserving some of our young m en from falling into the demoralising habits and customs so common in this city, and they may yet become a power for good But if w e would improve tho character of our community wo must look well to tho education of the young Wo have now happily a System of education vigorously worked in lho Public schools which cannot but result in groat good to the children ond the rising youth of tho colony. We have no sympathy whalover witi those who denounce tho Public school system as a godless system becauso their peculiar dogmas aro not taught by it ;0n tho contrary, we boar our cordial testimony to the high moral tone sustained and enforced by it, and are thankful that so much scriptural knowledge is imparted in connexion with such a sound and thorough mental training But tho Public schools cannot do all that it, needed What is done thore must be supplemented by tho efforts of tho Sunday school, tho Church, and the home It may be woll also fo us as nnniafcra lo consider whethorwe are doing all that wo might, whether we take sufficient pains to bring the young into contact with oursclv es I know it may be pleaded that we havo not time, and that with our many and prosing en- gagements the thing is impossible No one is moro sensible of these diflkultics, or haa felt them moro keenly than I huvo mvself, jet I am not satisfied with tho ploa I feel as if somothing more ought and must bo done We ought to know, wherever possiblo, all the children m our church and schools, and to make them all feel, howover poor or young, that we ore thur friends, and that wo are interested in thoir welfare No labeur will bo so reproductive, so cortainly and so widely beneficial, as labour bestowed upon the J'ting But in order to benefit them wo must begim with them early The good John Newton says, ' I compare the human mind to a bushel, and I try to fill it with wheat before tbe Devil can got there to fill it with chaff" And we hove inspired authority for believing that a pious edu- cation is the best safeguard to virtue, for Solomon says, " Iroin up a child in the way he should go, and when he is eld he will not depart from it" Boneo also the Apostolic injunction to parents to ' bring up their children m lho eui lure and admonition of the Lord " Too much stress cannot possibly lo laid upon this matlor. ;The character of tho colony m the future depends very much, uí i ir Goâ> upon thG coaractor of tho education of tho children and the young people m the present day. Lot them bo well and soundly trained m n knowlcdgo of the scripture«, and the principles of the Gospel, and wo woy I hooo lo seo ero long nstrong and well consolidated Chnelmn empire rising in this land Again, if wo would improve the character of our com n unify moro regard must bo paid to tho chirictcr of our homes One of tho greatest evils of tho present day, and one of the greatest hrailinncca to tho Eprend of religion, arises from tbo fuct that our young peoplo aro BO littlo at home Ihoy aro allowed lo bo out in the open world, and in tho "laro of public lifo, before thoy aro ablotobear it ¿ho meetings of societies, and the popular amusements of tho day, which call young people fiom thoir homes almost overy evening in tho week, aro eiorting n bid influence, ihoy may do somo good, but tho good thoy do is likely to bo greatly overbalanced by the ovila to which thoy lead. They 1 eep the mind ra a constant fovcr heat of excitement, so that there is neither the timo nor tho inclination for quiet and useful reading, for serious thoiightnncl rolloction, 01 foi the exercises of pra}er and devotion Wo seo in the giddy excitement, tho fnvolity, tho instability, and the irreligiousness of the Tfrench people what sooioty becomes when the quiet of homo is forsaken fur life in public Under such discipline men may grow sharp, but thoy will also grow shallow They may be smart, clever, eurface men, but the} will not bo deep, thoughtful, strong men Ihey may bo delivered from tho follies of superstition, but they will most likely be destitute also of religions faith Such a state of things is very unfavourable to healthy mental development, and to true religious growth Character can- not root itself in such a soil Humility or reverence cannot breathe in such an atmosphere Such a process may força on an caily precocious growth, but it will never minister tct robust anel healthy manhood In ti profound)} suggestive and beautiful sermon on tho early eovclopment of Jesus, the lato Mr Robortson, o BnghttD, says " No hot-bed precocity moiked tho holies of infancies. Iho Son of Man grew up in tho quio valley of existence, in shadow, not in sunshine, not forced No unnatural Btinralatmtr culturo had dev eloped the mina or feelings, no pubho flattery, no sunnrag of his infantina pcrfecliens in the glare of tho world's chow, had brought tho temptation of ino wilderness, with wh eli his manhood grappled too early, on his soul." Aro our avowedly Christian homos all thoy should boc Aro they as dovout in spirit, and as holy in their character and influences as they might bo? Ai o Christian parents sufficiently careful in watching over tbo morals and tha manners of their children, m guarding thom agamBt dan- gerous practices, doubtful nsBociations, and unholy com« panionshipB t Aro thoy sufficiently select m tho literatura they patreniEe, and in tho kind of amusements and pastimes they allow ? IB the home, aa wo see it here, jUBt tno place) where deep, true, vital Godliness is likely to bo fostered j where early conEfcrution to Christ may bo expected, whorej intelligent piety and steadfoBt faith will bo nurtured inten strength it should bo so, it must bo BO, boforo any great, and decided improvement in the religious lifo in the commu« nity can bo looked for. It is to Christian homes and Christian families that we naturally look for tho steady lncreaso o£ our churches, for the best of our strength, for our ministers and deacons, our teachers and workers, and fon tho most usofU and reliable of our members Bat do our Chnetian families supply our churches with such a steady increaBo of such membora as wo ought to o-npect i I think not, and if not, why not ? God is not unfaithful to his promise, "His car is not heav} that Ho cannot hear, neither is His arm shortened that Ho cannot save " le not the cause to be found in tho want of n deeper tone of religious feeling in tho home. It may bo said that parente cannot make their children pious,-that conversion; IB the work of God , so neither can tho husbandman makes a harvest, but he can plough the ground and BOW tho Beeds and when ho does BO, he is seldom disappointed of a crop. And when ChnBtian parents use tho proper moanB for tho promotion of piety ra thoir children, thoy aro warranted to expect lie Divine bloBBing. Iho late venerable Mr. Jay, of Bath, BUVB, "When wo look back to our oarlier forefathers, wo find religion a kind of heirloom in the family, and the generations of tho upright wore blessed , and, though grace never came by natural descent and that which was born ' was bom not of blood, nor of tho will of the ilosh, nor of tha will of man, but of God,' God hoard prayer and blosBod instruction, endeavour, and example, so that ' instead of the fathers were tho children, whom tho Lord mado princes in the earth ' " Iho Psalmist certainly teachoB ua to expect an entail of good in godly families, for ho says, "lhe mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to ever- lasting upon them that fear Him, and His righteousness unto children's children, to such as keep His covenant, and to thoso tnat remember His commandmenta to do them " Matthew Henry says, " Where I have a tent God shalJ have an attic," and there should bo the daily recognition uf God in family worship But is this most instructiva anti most useful of religious duties as much attended to as it should be, OB it used to bo i I fear not Of Abraham God said, " I know mm that he will command his children and his household after him, and thoy shall kcop the way of tho Lord to do justice and judgment, that the Lord moy bring upon Abraham that which Ho hath spoken of him ," and Joshua says, " AB for mo and my house wo will Bervothe Lord" What we now desiderate IB an improvement in the homes of our poople, ospeciallji an improvement in our Christian homoB Again, if we would improve tho character of our com« munity we must nee to it that the piety of our Churohea ia deepened and improved I aomotimcB doubt whether tho ancient, the Scriptural appellations of tho Church and the world will not lose their significance, and their appro- priateness, for there is BO little difference between them mt the present day. The contrast between the requirements of the Saviour, who says, " If any mun will bo my dis- ciple, and will como after mc, lot him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me," and the actual state of. things presented by men and women professing godlraosa in this land, is often very startling and surprising. Nor. havo we any hope that things will mead until tho Church shall be recovered from its worldliness. I am afraid tho ancient type of strict, conscientious, and consistent godliness IB seldom to be met with now. A newer, and more accom- modating style of religion has become fashionable Tha Apostles, and their associates were, it would seem, " righteous overmuch " Wo are moro refined and enlight- ened, and arc ra no danger of falling into euch a vulgac error The correct thing now is to maka things easy, ta " become all things to all mon," but in a widely different; senso to that ra which the Apostle used those words. Wa aro now told that the theatre is tho school of wisdom and virtue, that the opera is tho place to refine and elevate tho taste Tho grace of posture is now evidently felt by many to be more important than the grace of prayer. Muscular Christianity finds its fitting development in horseracing, and in other not less questionable amusements and pas- times of tho day. Well it may be we are wrong, but certainly wo havo " not so learned Chmt " Wo may bo wrong, but it seems to us that the spirit of worldliness and frivolity is eating out all the vitality of tho Church's life The extravagance! of fashion, and the passion for amusement that now pre- vails among avowedly Christian people, is quite bewilder- ing, things are now declared to bo harmless, and innocent, which tho Doctors of the Church, and the learned Chris- tian casuists of evory ago havo pronounced dangerous It is not difficult to seo from what those opinions and prac- tices proceed, nor is it at all doubtful as to vvhithor thoy tend Like causes have in all ages produced Ilka effects, and I confess I look with great concern at tho present state of things in the Churches of this land I nm not usually, I boliovo, considered na alni mist, I am of a sufficiently sanguine and hopeful temperament not to see fear where there is no ground for it But my soul is stirred within me when X ECO that tho great hindrance to the spread of Christianity in this land is to be found in Christians themsolvcs. Hero is our great difficulty. If the Churches were religiously healthy, such a state of things as now exists would lie im- possible Wero the grandeur, tho importance, the reality of Divine things sufficiently recognised and felt by tha Church, it would be a mighty, an all-but-irresistible power, for good Were Christian people as deeply serious as many of them are trifling and worldly, wero thoy as earnest in the pursuit of their "high calling of God m Christ Jesus'* ns they oro in tho pursuit of their secular aims and plans,, thoy would " be unto God for a name and for a praiso anel for a glory in tho world." The Church vvoulef then go forth on her glorious mission "clear as the sun, fair as tua moon, and terrible as an army with banners " If tho tiela of ungodliness ia to bo stopped-if tho aboundings oE iniquity aro to bo checked-if in this land on empire of truth and righteousness is to bo built up for Christ-thoa tho piety of our Churches must bo deopened and improved. But, after all, the only power capable of grappling with and overcoming the hindrances and tho ovils of which wa complain, and of making this country whit wo all desire to Beo it, vi/ , great, glorious, and freo, is tho Gospel of Christ Without tho efficient preaching of tho Gospol, these evils will never bo removed But the Gospol is tha divinoly-opporated means of salvation, and is still tho powor of God, and tho wisdom of God to that end But do wa always preach it with a hv irg faith ra its adaptation to that purpose f Do we go forth with an oxpoctitisn of realising; preeent success i Do wo prcaoh it w ith that intelligent earnestness of conviction that loaves upon our hoarors tha impression of its immediate importance to thom indiviilu olly P Of tho apostles it was said, " Thoso mon believe, anti therefore speak" Their own deep conviction of lte truth and importance aroused tho attention of tho public mind* Ihey preached discriminatingly to men's character and condition, still it was tho Gospel which they preached. They nevei weaned in telling men the old story that "Christ died for our Bins according to the Scnpturos. and that He was buried, and that Ho roso again tho third day according to tho Scnpturos " And wo, my brethren, must take our stand by tho Cross, and call men's attention to tha love and tho pity and the claims of Him who died upon it. Nothing else can subduo thoir iniquities, deliver thom from tho power, or charm them out of the love of their sins. With wondorful force of argument and oloquonco, beauty and pathoB, the Rev Mr Dale, of Birmingham, tho pre i ent Chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, shows, in IHB address dolivered bofore that body in London in May last, the necessity of proaohrag Christ as tbo aolution of all controversies ana the satisfaction oE all wants The wants of humanity indeed aro substantially tho same in every age and in every land, for wo aro aft " brothers in remorseful memories and moral necessities.'* But we want no now Gospol. Let us but show to sinful dying men tho beauty of Christ, and the vision will gladden their hearts " Nor need wo fear that tho world will grow weary of hearing about Him , it grows weary of everything else, but it never grows weary of Christ " Tho way, my brethren, to overcome the scepticism, tho indifference, and tho worldliness of our land, is to preach Christ " Let tha world," Boys Mr. Dale, " look on His face again, and hoar His voice, and Bee whether tho tide of battlo will not turn, and a glorious victory bo won Wo knew how marvellous was tho spell which Ile oxerted ovor all sorts of mon when Ho was here.

Wo niUBt speak with tho conviction which only a personal interest in tho Savioui whom wo preach will inspire Wo must bo able to sa), " What our ej es havo seen, ond our hands havo handled, of the Word of life, declare wo unto vou" "It is not onough," says Mr. Dale, "that vu know Christ himself bv tho moro report of others, what ovangolists and apostles havo told us of Him is not enough Wo must tell the world what we havo heard from his own lip', or tho world will not liston And whim wo mako * known the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ,' wo must speak as ' oyo-vvitnossos of His ninjestj ' Oin wholo nature, our wholo ministry roust bo penetiat"d and transfigured with His glory." Nor need wo despair if we thus preach Christ, sinoo Ho is infinitely more concerned foi tho snlv ation of tho world thanwoenn possiblv be-, and "all powor m heaven and ia earth ia given into His hands "Ho must reign, ' sajs tho ApOBtlo, " till all His enormes aro put under His foot " Doubt of tho salvation of the world, 01 distrust of the power of tho Gospol to bung about that glonoua consum- mation, we know not Disappointment in tho result of His mission would miplv ignorance or weakness, neither of which dare wo oscribo to Christ Tho work of redemption undor His own superintendence and blessing is still going on "And this man,' eujs (ho Apostle, ' when ho had offered ono sacrifico for Bins, for ever sat down al tho right hand of God, from henceforth cvpecting until His eueimes Jbo made His footstool." Speaking of this world-of ila misónos, its heresies, and its wants-Mr. Dale eave (to quote lum oneo more) "To Chnstitis the samo world which foi so lunn) centuries Ho has been pitjing, loving, and trjing to save lho now porplcxities of (ho ago do not bullio His wisdom, ils now tremoles do not nppal His heart, its now ems do not evhauat Hismorcj.
