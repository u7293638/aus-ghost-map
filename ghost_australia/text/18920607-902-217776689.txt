\ Ghost-Iiuntlnsr in (Hen Innes. , , ,7vrr »i 1 i.rrr;t .-vrr The oddest yarns are told of mysterious goings on in a certain cottage in Church-street, which are corroborated by no less than three persons who have at separate times occupied the place. These people say that the footsteps of someone walking about the rooms in the dead of night have been dis tinctly heard by them, and although one of the narrators once lit a candle and searched for the nocturnal promenader, he could not Bee a trace of him or her ; yet the sounds were heard quite plaiuly in some other part of the house. Another individual who slept in the house says that he was pitched violently out of bed by some creature that lifted the oorner of the bed and shook him out Another individual — and a Salvationist, to boot — ; declared he actually saw a fair man at the door, : who vanishsd when he approached to speak to him. \ Inspired by hearing reports such as these, on Sun-? day night last three of our young fellow-townsmen! courageously determined to solve the mystery, andl betook themselves to the house in question, and! awaited the arrival, of the reputed ghost. Whe-| ther it was from innate talkativeness or whether ite was from sheer nervousness, we do not know ; but| the daughty watchers acknowledge that they kep up a constant chatter all the time they were in th% . house, and his ghostship (who appears to be of a| j retiring disposition) seemingly in consequence! S failed to give any signs of his presence on the occaS s sion. Since then yet another courageous individuals I has announced his intention. of watching all alone I armed with a ferocious buil-dog revolver, loaded ic I every chamber — and woe- be-tide any practical! i joker, he says. The cause of these mysterious dial; iturbances will, in ali likelihood, prove to be | recluse iguana or fat 'possum, and it wifl be moBtpi satisfactory to have the mystery solved. $
