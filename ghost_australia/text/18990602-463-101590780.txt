The low. cancerous figure for coal miners indicates that they enjoy a comparative immunity from cancer, as well i* from phthisis.

CA.N0BB bDS Tp A PABABJLTg. Mr. Plimmer, pathologist to St Mary's Hospital, records the results of extensive investigations which he has made in references to cwnoer. These have led him to the conclusion that cancer ;a due to a parasite. During the past six years be examined micro scopically 1278 cancers. He found parasitic bodies in 1130. The follow ing is remarkable : — ' From the last of these cases which have come 'into my hands I was able to isolate an organism which in certain animals was able to cause death, with the produc tion of tumors ia various parts. The cancer from which this organism was isolated was taken from the breast of a woman aged 35. It had a history of only two months' duration, and it was growing rapidly at the time of the operation.' We have all heard of ghost-haunted hoases; but surely there to a new terror in the idea of cancer-haunted houses. Mr. D'Arcy Power contri bute* some curious observations as to the predilection of cancer for particular places, and even for certain booses. Here is a case ; — ' Miss B,( aged 46, lived in a certain house in a suburb of London for 13 years, and died of cancer of the stomach in 1884. Miss T., aged 41, next occupied her bedroom. She had lived ia the house ior 20 years, and died of cancer of the liver in October, 1885. Mrs. J., aged 67, who had lived in the house for 8 years, succeeded to the place and to the faed room successively oocupitd by Miss B. and Mrs. T. Mrs. J. died of cancer in 1893.' Mr. D'Arcy Power cannot help thinking that such cases raise a strong presumption in favor of cancer being an infective distease, to' which some are much more susceptible than others. Locality seems to be a predominant factor, and he does not put great stress on a given room or house, or water supply. BOW OANCBB CAN BE CORED. The final question is, What can be dons for patients cufiering from can cert Professor Watson Oheyne takes the view that cancer is at first a local, rather than a constitutional trouble. In that view if the disease is detected early and operated upon freely, the patient may be cured. The attempts to cure cancer by other means than operation are, he says, invariably futile. What ean be done for a patient for whom nothing is possible in the way of actual cure 1 In other words, is it worth while living when a cancer b in full possession t Says Professor Watson Cheyne : 'In many cases we can stall do much to prolong life, and, what is of much importance to* these patients, to make such period of life as remains to them much more tolera able.'
