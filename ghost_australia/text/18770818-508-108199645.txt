A GHOST AT ALDERSkOTT. The London Times has a ghost story. For a month the camp of Aldershott was visited nightly by aa aggressive spirit. It was no respector of persons or rank, it pummelled haughty officers in the ribs, and gave humble privates black eyes. A private of the 10th saw it one night, and was abashed. It was midnight, and the sentry preening something advancing to ward him gave the usual challenge, to which no reply was made. The challenge was repeated, whereupon the ghost went to the sentry-box, slapped the soldier several times in the face, and before he could recover from his confusion made off across tho common with astonishing bounds. The soldier, in his excitement, loaded his rifle aud fired, but missed his aim. The ghost vent toward the Military Cemetery, and in a, similar manner attempted to frighten a private in the 100th Regiment, who was on guard by a powder magazine. Again was a gun nred, and again did the ghost stalk off unharmed. A fort night afterward the ghost pounced upon another soldier and endeavoured to snatch away his rifle. A sharp struggle ensued, which ended by the)' soldier receiving a pair of black eyes and losing his shako, which was found next morning in tha canal. Another sentry was accosted in the camp by some one with a mask, who informed him that he was the much-dreaded ghost, and his object was to show tbe nation how easily he could frighten tha Eoldicrs of the present day.
