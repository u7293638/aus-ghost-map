An Hour With the Spooks. IN response to invitation a few ladies and gentlemen assembled at Shakspeare's hotel to witness a private seance with the Bpooks given by Mr. Gilbert, of Gilbert and Wain wright, who are billed for a series of enter tainments in Bancke's hall, commencing on Thursday evening nest. The coffee-room of the hotel served the purpose of a seating room for the audience, while a room opening into it was used as a cabinet. Mr. Gilbert, in introducing himself, said his object in appearing before tbem that evening was to assure them that his entertainment was genuine, and that they might recommend it to their friends. He then gave a representa tion of Mrs. Mellon's ghosts in three charac ters, and the apparitions were as weird and phantom-like as even the greatest ghost be liever could picture or suppose. What struck us most was that none of the ladies seemed in the least alarmed, but appeared | rather to enjoy the situation even though the lights were lowered and the room darkened. Mr. Gilbert wishes us to state that hiB en tertainment is full of fun and mirth and that ventriloquism is his forte. Certainly bis im personation of the ghost seemed quite real istic, and those who have an inkling for a closer acquaintance with such absurd though unwelcome visions will not be disappointed.
