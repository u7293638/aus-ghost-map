THE IDEAL ENGLISHMAN BY A. S. WAY. It is the last year of the 16th century a century marvellous with manifold change quickened with strange hopes, startled with stranger fruition, an age in which the tide of human progress had swept over a broader space than many that had gone before. It was ushered in beneath lowering skies that yet dripped with the red horror of a fifty years' rain of blood, that were still resonant with the thunders of civil strife, amid the groans of lost causes that died hard, and the throes of an expiring feudalism that still seemed terrible Amid the clamour of discontented labour, and the grow ing antagonism of landlord and peasant, the land cowered under the king of the cold heart and the griping hand 'those who BOW the coming in of the the century might well have foreboded evil days But it passed out as beneath a triumphal arch, while the air yet thrilled and throbbed with shouts of victory, when a united nation rallied, as in an intoxication of loyalty, round the throne of a heroic Queen, when the sword of England was heavy in the scale of the nations, and her feet lightened far over the uttermost seas, when the spirit of liberty was strong in men's breasts, and the stronger in that it was closely wedded to the spirit of law and order A new world had been revealed to men, but stranger than any HE Dorado of their golden dreams was that new world which had arisen in the old home. It was new in respect to the national character, new in the spirit of enterprise, new in culture, and new in social life Well might the men who beheld that century go out see visions and dream dreams, that hope was ever on her mountain, watching till the day began " At no time could men so fitly be told of their country's heroic past, be reminded that their fathers had left them an example which it needed no common energy and devotion to emulate, and behold re risen one who was as a kin; the counterpart of that image of a queen which was enshrined as the saint of his deepest devotion in each man's breast. And never, since that day when Athena, laurel wreathed from Marathon and Salamis, g ued on the stately pageantry and hearkened to the rolling music of " The Persians," had worthier audience gathered to mark the unfolding of a noble drama than these that are murmuring in high wrought expectation before the black curtain of the Globe, England a noblest sons are there; from daring enterprise of discovery and war they have wended home for a short breathing space, but half their hearts are on the wild waters yet their ears strain to catch the summons of the (ramps at, the untravelled world gleams ever phantom like before their eyes Raleigh as there, home from the hunting of Spanish galleons, and bringing jubilant tidings of the death of Philip is there, fresh from the plundering of Porto li ice, are Lord George Clifford and the Hart of Cumberland, by it is sea dogs are there, suntanned and wind bloused from Cunb bean Sea and stern crags of Spitzbergen, from trafficking in slaves beneath the line, and from harpooning whales under the northern streamers, asor these alone, but amid gallant soldiers and daring seamen, and venturous merchants and wise states men, but poet and dramatist, Ben Jonson, "Ina deep etc laughter started" with the mirth of "Volpone, and Chapman with his lips murmuring the ocean music of Homer And haply you may cap) another there, a pallid air blow of his former self, like a bag game ghost from the caverns of despair.

He will never see another play of Shakspeare, nor ever resume the Ivre that he has touched with such witchery The "Faerie Queene" must remain for ever a tale half told And so while men are yet talking of the raising of the three latest plays while the) arched discussing the newest literary sense son, the publication of the Pomonal Pilgrim, the curtain rises, and this strange play begins It is like no other play of Shakspeare before or after It is one long pa in ot triumph, chanted in name for triumphs long past, and yet, as men look and hearken, there is something strangely familiar in the story it seems the history of the last twelve years retold-of heroic read letters stubbornly facing fearful odds, of one chasing a thousand, of the humbling of an ancient foe, of the widening of the bounds of empire, and the men who had been making longland a queen of the seas would feel their hearts but the more uplifted in the contemplation of those unbilled laurels won of old on land. And the central figure and hero of it all is the noble prototype of those who have wrought his mighty deeds again, a chief whom they would have loved to follow a character they can understand, one of themselves a man, a thorough sings lishman Dear to the and of the beholders would be his English coolness and self control. No feature in the character of their mercurial neighbours across the Channel had so stirred their amusement and contempt as their excitability and attitudinising Their bursts of temper and Hoods of rhodomontade seemed beneath the dignity of a man. Shakspeare does not forget to satirised the vapouring of the Dauphin among his French lord 'Tennyson crystallises the Borne view when he glances at the schoolboy heat, the blind hysterics of the self" and " the red fool fury of the Seine " The hot southern blood Harnea up at a glance or a touch , but it is a characteristic trait in Henry that before defiance and insult he becomes very calm. I shed before the Melbourne Shakspeare Society at I III ulMllnl on October b. p Recall the scene where the tennis balls art uncovered Imagine the startled hush throughout his court, all eyes turning on the king, as in expectation of some lightnings flash of fury But, in cold measured accents, Henry takes up the bitter jest, and with most grim humour plays upon it, and only by the awful earnest of his meaning can you perceive how deeply stirred he is; and, as on other occasions when strongly moved, so now, as he proceeds, be rises into a strain of burning eloquence that eloquence which is not born of study or practice, but comes in the white heat of righteous anger or high resolve- and from the Olympian height of his scorn and indignation hurls a prophecy of doom We are reminded of that scene where, in Tarentum's theatre, the ambassador of Some stood holding up before the eyes of a scoffing multitude his toga, befouled with beating outrage, when, over the tempest of laughter, the storm of hootings, hisses, and jeers, his voice rung out steady and stern, " Men of Tarentum, it will take not a little blood to wash this gown clean ' The men who played out the game of bowls on the Hoe at Plymouth could well appreciate Henry a English pluck, the stubborn resolution that does not know when it is overmatched, which is most formidable when at bay, which exults in facing fearful odds, which kept the squares at Waterloo was broken, which made Inkerman the soldiers' battle, and at Lucknow and Rorke's Drift snatched victory from the jaws of despair. Well might those who were enough to pluck the Spaniards' leathers one by one," and to chase his huge Bca castles into the sheltering haven, feel their hearts leap within them at Reno a noble answer to Westmore land's wishing that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in England that do no work to day I ' His spirits rise as the crisis of peril approaches, he can break a kindly pat on Westmoreland, and dismisses with a little grim pleasantry the herald Mountjoy, and BO, with an unforced smile upon his lips, plunges into the fight Even such a captain do soldiers love, his I high amid danger is a trumpet of victory, their triumph is as sure as when Hannibal's just sent low thunder of mirth rolling down the Carthaginian ranks as they faced the huge boat of Rome at Carrie. of a peculiarly English type, too, is the manliness of Henry, a king that needed not the hedge on his dignity to command respect He can mingle unrecognised among common men, and holds his own with a quiet humour and mastery of the situation, and amid kings and princes he is of right kingly bearing, and right courteous withal, veiling his strength with tenderness, so that a chance comer could not have told which was the conqueror We cannot, in referring to his manliness, passes) the proof he gives of it under that most crucial test of the hour of wooing Since the world began there has been one problem ever coming to each man in his appointed hour how he shall win a woman to his wife, and, alas, his answer is too often a reductio ad absurdum, for " we that are true lovers run into strange papers." We sink our dignity and stoop our manhood to be the footstool of a fairy foot We wear all the signs of the true lover which Rosalind accounts, we live in numbers with unaccustomed lips, and perpetrate verses as never before nor after rhymes the sight of which in later years should make our fell of hair stir and our noble selves stir and gasp Yet if, after losing our hearts, we could but keep our heads, we might haply remember that woman craves for a stronger than herself, that her heart is drawn to the breast on which her head may mean, not the neck on which he foot may be planted that her trust goes out, not to cunning in protestation," but to the "good heart" that cannot reign, that means more than the tongue can say. It was a hero's wooing, and it was a woman who was, in more senses than one, a crown to her husband ," and each English- man that looked on felt that, if his courage would but he as good as Harry's in the hour of trial, so would he woo and so win. And so they gazed with kindling eyes and hearts that swelled within them, and the pulse of manhood in each man quickened, and the patriot fire glowed as they hung upon the music that rang with triumphs even such as themselves had won, as they saw unfolded even such a royal, manly character as each man might make his own ideal, whose realisation depended in no wise on transcendent genius nor on rare gifts of fortune, nor on opportunities vouchsafed to few, nor on virtues too high for this workaday world, but on the fostering of instincts that stir within us all, on the development of traits which we are wont to claim as peculiarly English, the common heritage of peasant and of prince, which have added dignity to the triumph of a Wellington and turned into something better than victory the failure of a Gordon
