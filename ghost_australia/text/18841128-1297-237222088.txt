" She was si'entfor a little spice; but when ho looked at her he found that leers and umiles were contending for the ma-.ti-ry io her btantiiul face, snd covering it with tbe loviiest rose-tinta of re turning hapuinesr and health, "Ob, Nigel," the said, at length, " I am so weak and foolish that I do not think 1 am worth having at ail. But if you want tae— 1 will do exactly what you like." And then, as if afraid that she bad said too much she bioke from his encircling arms and hid herself in the next room ; whence Madame Vallor pre sently emerged wiilr » faiat smile upon her l-pt, ana feu - d Nigel walking up and down ihe room ut a very rapid raco. He.turoed to meet her us she entered, and held out his hand, " We have succeeded," he said ; and, though he spoke crdmly, he could not keep tho exultant sparkle out of Mb eyes nor the glow of triumph from his face. " You have asked your question," said Madame \al!or, withdrawing .ber hand from, bis close and friendly grasp and teatirg herself at h r work. " I have asked and betn answered. She will be 21 on Sunday, will she ? Then before tbe end of that week she shall be my wife.'' " I am glad of that." Bhe said, without looking at him. "I advised that course long ago, Mr Tremninc. You must not be alarmed if you iiud her mind still apt to be weak am! confused some times, You must keep her veiy tiamjuil, for any excitement throws her back at once. She grows rtrorger and better, cn the whole, however, every day." " 1 am not afiaid," Nigel answered. " And— another thing' Mr Tremainc. Bring Mrs Tr« malne.your mother, io the wedding. Qui -t as it m-y be. yon mas: have witnesses of un- doubter, good faith; your mother and your sister, or same well-knuwn »nd intimate t'ii«nd."
