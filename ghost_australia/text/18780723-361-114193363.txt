A?n Offender Bowled Out. A CLEVER piece of work has been acoom pjished in the Lands Department, an erring officer of long standing being the victim. Xleptomania does not confine its victims to valuables in the shape of money or jewellery, but permits of operations on sweatmeats or, in their absence, on the excellent fare enjoyed by civil servants at the half-hour forenoon interval, In one branch of the lands oflice a day has never passed over without complaints of some unscrupulous hand being laid on lunch baskets. One gentlemen was victimised four times suec oessively not a week ago, and the horrible presentiment asne to his mind that the ohief of the' branch was the culprit. A conference was held, and it was decided to bring the offender to justice. The whole of the lunches next day were liberally served with tarter emetic. At about 1 the chief felt disinclined to dine, and at 2 was sure he was attacked by cholera or typhoid Half an hour later the real symptoms were apparent, and the sympathies of the officers of the department increased as the tableau drew nigh. He was sure he was going to give up the ghost, as he lhad a fearful dose, but instead of that gave up the dinner. Traces of many a lamented tit-bit were forthcoming, and the chief in due course was led back , better and a lighter man. He has since petitioned for the removal, it is said, of the chief conspirators on the ground of insubordination. - Tuesday's E?vening News.
