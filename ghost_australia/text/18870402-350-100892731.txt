poetry The Shield. Ob I did yon hear a voice of death 7 And did you not mark the paly form Which rode on tbo silver mist of the heath, And «ng a ghoetly dirge in the storm 7 Was it a vailing bird of the gloom, Wbioh shrieks on the bonsa of woe all night? Or a shivering fiend (bat flew to a tomb, To howl and to feed till the glance o( light 7 'Twas not the death bird's cry from the wood, Nor shivering fiend that hung in the blast; 'Twas tho shade of Helderio—man of blood— It soreams for the guilt of days that are past t See bow the red, red lightning strays, And soares tbe gliding ghost of the heath I Now on tbe leafless yew it plays. Where baogs the shield of the son of death I That shield is blushing with murderous stair>B; Long has it huDg from the oold yew's spray; It iB blown by storms and washed by rains, But neither can talc the blood away. Oft by that yew, on tbe blasted field, Demons dance to the red moon's light; While tbe damp boughs creak, and the swing ing shield Sings to the raving spirit ol night I
