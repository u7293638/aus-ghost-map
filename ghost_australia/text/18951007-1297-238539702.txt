THE PREMIER SURPRISED. The Premier, it would appear, was In Parramatta when the first news of the ar rests reached him. He had reached the town by the 5 o'clock steamer, and was quietly sauntering up the main street to wards the train, when ho met Mr. Hugh Taylor, the late member for the town. Mr. Reid stopped to exchange a few words with the old parliamentary hand. This is Mr. Taylor's version of what occurred:— "Well, how are things getting on?"— "Oh, quietly," responded the Premier. "How about the Dean case?" said Mr. Taylor. — "Oh, Lhat's all over." "All over?" exclaimed Mr. Taylor. "How can it be all over with Crick, Meagher, and Dean arrested?" The Premier (to use Mr. Taylor's own words) was fairly staggered, and turned "as white as a ghost!" and hastening to the telegraph office, had a conversation ou the telephone. Coming outside he imme diately hailed a cab, and drove to the rail way station, taking the 25 past 5 train to Sydney.
