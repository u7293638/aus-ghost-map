LOVE OF LIFE. Phrenologists have assigned to a protuberance under the ear the faculty of " vitativeness," or love of life, and some of them assume that in proportion to the size of the bump is the strength of the vital, element in the individual. However this may be, that the love of life is intense in some minds, and scarcely exists at all in others, no body, of course, will deny ; and it is no less true that persons who earnestly desire to live can keep a mortal disease at bay much longer than those who are compara tively indifferent to their fate. The tenacity with which some men cling to life is marvellous. We had an instance of this in the case of a noted pugilist, several years ago, who was shot in the breast during a bar-room scuffle, and his condition was pronounced hopeless by the surgeons. But he scoffed at their opinions, and actually lived several days with a ball in his heart ; keeping his hold upon life — so it seemed — by sheer force of will. A resolute determination not to succumb is, as every army surgeon knows, the salvation of many a wounded soldier, who without it would assuredly die. In the Crimean war the mortality among the wounded Turks was much greater than among the wounded French and English. The latter wrestled stoutly with death and often baffled him when their doom seemed inevi table ; but the predestinarian Mussulman, when danger ously injured, said gloomingly, " It is my kismet " (fate), turned his face toward Mecca, and gave up the ghost. There can be no doubt that love of life and vigor of will have been the means of restoring to health thou sands of patients who but for these mental character- istics must have perished. — New York Ledger.
