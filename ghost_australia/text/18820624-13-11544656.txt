PICTURES OF TR IVEL. BY J.S IN AND AROUND ROME. Just outside of Rome, on the slope of the Jauioulus, where the ancient lunga erected their castle, stands the monastery of St. Onofrio, founded about four centuries and, in honour of an Egyptian hermit named Honoplmiifl You reach it, seated as it is upon a lofty knoll, commanding a fine view of the city looking northward, by a IOIM flight of steps, from a street called the Vi i della Longara, which connects the region of the Vatican with the Trastevere, a quarter or of the city inhabited chiefly by the poorer classes who are proud of their descent from the old Romans, and look upon the princely) houses in composed of mere parvenus Not many) persons visit this out of the wa) monis ter), and when you ring the bell the echoes it u wakelin inside have a ghostly sound, and are suggestive of a silent void entering a little cloister, uah grass growing in the interstices of the stones in the quadrangle, you ask for the tomb of Tasso, who died and was buried here 1 who janitor points to a door in one corner, and goes back to his unfinished mid-day meal You are rather thankful for this mark of his confidence in your honesty and general propriety of conduct, and passing through a little sacristy lined with venerable oaken presses and drawers, you cross the threshold of another door and enter one of the quiet, and quaintest little churches you can poB ill) imagine there is a faded ulm piece by Aiinihale Carncci, and t St Anna teaching the Madonna to road, by Pentu reaches out some frescoes b) Pertinax and the whole place wears an old world look, u if nobody ever came to worship there, at d as if it was just possible that, at midnight, the ghosts of bygone priests and monks might revisit the pile glimpse-, of the moon, and celebrate massed in low whispers for the repose of the dead The stillness of the char his quite profound, and the mere rustle of a curtain would be a violent disturbance of it Cardinal mezzotints, the marvellous his guilt, lies buried here, and the pave ment is inlaid with monumental slabs of great antiquity But what consecrates the quiet little face in the estimation of every) lover of II ii in literature is that the ashes of Torquato '1 HSSO rest in one corner of the building you have seen his birthplace at Sorrento and his prison at Ferarra, and Standing here upon the stone which records his death upon the 25th of April, IJOJ, and covers all that was mortal of him, you recall the grow in g tribute of your own coutitrjoieii to his illustrious memory Oh viet r unsurpassed in modern song Each ) year brings forth its millions, but how long The li li I generations shall roll on And not the whole combine 1 an he unites throng Comp BJ i mind like thine?

There is something very touching in the story of the last years of Tasso s life imprisoned for upwards of seven years by the mere arbitrary will of Alfonso the Second and released at the urgent solicitations of the Popeandof theDukeofMantua, one of the first things the poet did was to visit the surviving members of his family, who were settled at Bergamo, whence he set out on foot and penniless for Bologna He continued his journey to Loreto, and proceeded thence to Rome Here he met with nothing but can timely and contempt, and he soon after wards turned his feet towards Naples " to live or to die, ' as he expressed it He was but little more fortunate there, and presently returned to Home, where an imitation reached him from Ferdinand de Medici to visit Florence While there he heard of the death of Pope Sextus, an! of the election of Urban the Seventh as his successor, and resolved upon presenting him self once more to the Papal Court But in the meantime the new Pope had succumbed to an attack of fever, and Gregory the Tour tenth reigned in his stead, and Tasso again became a wanderer from city to city At this juncture the Cardinals Aldobrandi prevailed upon the Pope to decree the poets coronation in the capitol TBSBO was so indifferent to the honour that it was only the persuasions of his friends which induced him to accept it On his reaching the gates of Rome he was met by the Pope, the College of Cardinals and a great concourse of people But the hand of death was already upon him, and he asked and obtained permission to rest himself for a few days in the monastery of St. Onofrio before the ceremony took place Seeing his end approaching, the prior asked him if he had nothing to bequeath and the poet answered with a sad smile that he had had very little during life, and could only leave his tablets to his friend and fellow poet Manson, and his crucifix to the monastery On the 25th of April, 19th, Tasso received his message of release He knew that he was dying, and as the words " In manus tuas, Domine" fell feebly from his wasted lips, and his eyes wandered for a moment to the purple heaven sprinkled with stars visible through the open case ment, at the hour of midnight his spirit passed away, and, by his own request, his grave was for some time marked only by a plain slab of stone, on which were engraved the words The Lett force units lassus " It is not far from the monastery of St. Onofrio to the church of St. Pietro in Montorio, behind which, almost on the summit of Mount JaniculuB, and near the old Via and Porta Aurelia, Surrounded by a beautiful garden, stands the Acqua Faola, a fountain decorated with columns from the Temple of Minerva in the Forum of Trojan From the table at which I am sitting at this moment I look across the city to the hill beyond, a distance of three miles, and see the whole face of this conspicuous fountain, with five voluminous streams of water pouring from as many arches into an enormous basin, from whence the pure element, brought from Lake Brentano, upwards of 30 miles away), is distributed over many quarters: of the city below Probably there is no city in the world in which the water supply is an pure in quality and so abundant in quantity as in Rome There is scarcely a pie?? without its fountain and in many instances with one or two That of fresh, with its colossal figures of Neptune Ifetllh, and Fertility is one of the sights of the city. The aqueduct which supplies it as it does also the three countries in the Piazza Navona and 1939 in the Piazza di Spagna and the Prayer Farnoae, was constructed by M Agrippt, who brought the water, from the Campagna a distance of 11 miles, for the supply of Ina baths, and its daily) discharge in upwards of 18 million cubic feet Besides the sources area!) enumerated there are those of the Ac jun Pellte, 13 miles away , of the Acqui M treta, r( miles distant, and of the Acqua Clmdi 1 r ' miles off The water, as a general rule, is largely impregnated with lime, and this probably has something to do with the fact that the physical development of the Romans is generally good, and that although not tall, their frames are large and ample To which it must he added, I think, that the number of dentists, relative!) to the population, is smaller than in most other European capitals There is not a palace nor an hotel and scarcely) a mansion, unprovided with its four turn or fountains, and the first object that meets your eye as you look up the arched passage leading into the court yard in the never ceasing jet of pure cold water, surmounted by) a statue and surrounded by it or other creepers intermingled with ferns and flowers Some of these court) area, even in the heart of the city, are of spacious dining stone and the quadrangle 13 carpeted with the greenest grass At the corners of the streets, in the newer portions of the veil), small spaces have been reserved by the municipality as gardens and shrub lines and are kept in beautiful order Here also, attached to the pain of the wealth) princes are hanging gardens of considerable magnitude You look up a massive sloping wall, 30ft or 10ft high, and find that it is the embankment of a pleasure ground of corresponding depth, and that on the summit of it is another wall enclosing lofty trees and shrubs shady walks under trellised vines, and marble terrace, from which wide prospects can be obtained both of the city and its architectural monuments, and of the surrounding hills But next to the new from the Bttmmttof St Peters that which is attainable from the open space in front of the church of San
