M.ORIWELL ANNUAL K.aLS. \-------- 0 - The annual races under the V.R.C. rules were held on Boxing day. The weather being delightfully cool, tle day was thoroughly enjoyable. The fields were I fair, andt, though, the finishes were free : from excitement, the interest being well maintained throughout the day. Tlhe pleasure of the spectators was considerably mareed by two infortunate accidente-one to tie rider of Brown liose and tile other I to our well-known townsmanl, Mr. Date. The first, Mr Rice's son, got his collar-bone , broken when his horse fell early in tihe nice, and tile latter got his leg severely injured through being run over by a horse. I Tile number of spectators was nuch larger than on any former occasion. Thle three card and monte Ien turned out in usual i force. Tle crowd was well-cotnducted and i orderly, and beyonit a few slight scrim Ilages, in which discretion was tle better part of valor, there was no incitlent to detract from the day'e pleasure. No pro tests were entered, anti everything went ott well, the contestants and' public being thoronyglyF satisfied, except in tile Publi can;s' turse, when slighlt mtInifestations of disalpproval were apparent, is tile riding of Little Buck was deemed sluspicions, perhaps, owing to tlhe fact, that the first iandt suecond liorns weret entered by tile tile samel owner. The refrelshment booth was as ustal we\ll-contducttl by Mr Breed, who was fully prepared for tile largest de Imeaiind that eould be made on his resources. A very large proplortion of the crowd ar rived by rail, and thle remarkably quiet order an;d despatcht of tile various trains eliciteld frequent counltendiations- freooi tle people on our courteous railway ollicials. The ste\ards, andt their energetic secretary worked very hard to mnake tle races thle success they proved to be. Over Â£'25 was taken in gate money, antl the Club will have a good balance oin hand after paying all exputses. The following is tle result of thie day's racing : 3MAIDEN PL.rAT.
