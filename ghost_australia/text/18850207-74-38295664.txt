CORRESPONDENCE. LWe do not identify ourselves with the opinions o â‚¬orreesondsent.l SUNDAY EXCURSIONS. TO THE EDITOR. SIR -I cannot permit " Non- Freethinker's" effusion of this morning's issue to pass unchal lenged, so must crave space for a few lines to reply, as his letter would give the Sabbath desecrators an opening to say than they had church members on their side-not that that designation carries much weight, as a man or woman may be a fell blown member of a church, attend constantly to all the means of grace, be liberal in their donations, etc., and yet may never have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and I pity any church that is built up by such members. No wonder we have so little epititual life in most of our churches in the present day, when their members will make nil sorts of excuses for breaking the Fourth Commandment. "Non - Freethinker" says -" Far be it from me to uphold the desecration of the Sabbath," and yet his letter is nothing else than an excuse for doing it; so much for his inconsistency. I am as much in favour of freedom of thought and action as any of the many writers on the subject. A man may think what he pleases so long as be doesn't think too loud, and every man will have to account for his own deeds done in the body, but that is no excuse for people upholding actions done in direct opposi tion to God's holy laws. While on the subject, allow me to say how surprised I am that any church in this town can so far support the action of the T.S.N. Com pany as to engage the Natono for a pleasure trip. I should have thought as a matterof conscience they would not have done so. Yours, etc., rNTI-Su?a?aA ExcoUsIon.
