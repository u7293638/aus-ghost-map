Ashton, of Taroom, 400 head '^^^accow|t| «E ^edoarie station, at a satisfactory price ; Mr. L&nna; gan;ipurchaser.- ^: / h.'jHr-Mk: '1 <•; The rumor of the gold discovery .at Gubberamanda turns out to be unfounded. It is a fact, however, that a couple of men i ■went iriit; there bn' ^rtain 'TCprebentitions | . made, but, ihey foaod not the slightest in dication that a search might result satis factorily, ^tpd they at once returned. What ever %lse %rfere in ay tie'about the country at' Gubberamunda there is not the slightest Indication of gold deposits either in quartz or alluvium. So that affair is settled, and we do not expect any similar flatter of excite ment -again; until somebody comes mcross a ■ really good 'diamond drift. Faoii parfciculara.to hiuid it appeara that the fire at Albany Downs which resulted in the destruction of the house,, at the head station occurred iearly <pn^£ waylay, moiling last, 54th intant. It appears that a young man, named--Tarnball, learning colonial experience, was suffering from neuralgia, got up abont 2 o'clock that morning, "and it is supposed a$parkfrpm his lamjp caught the m'oBquitoenrtaitt^b'nt he* did'not observe it. He went put of bedroom to sit bythe kitchen fire, ■ the neuralgic, painsrendering sleep impossible. He had been away from his roorr about twenty minutes when the alarm of fire was given. The flames spread rapidly, and ic was with great difficulty the store, which is about 30 feet distant from the main building, was saved. In the cases tried "before the Police Magis trate yesterday, it transpired that a licensed hawker had gone1 to' the railway station at Roma to vend his'goods, consisting of. jewellery, &c.; The hawker was evidently under the impression that hisiicenseenabled him "*to go anywhere" he thought fit; but Captain Goodall told him that a by-law | exists which makes it necessary for a licensed hawker to obtain the written: anthorityof the^-Gommissionerfor Railways before he can enter railway premises fpr the ^ 1 purpose of selling goods, and . neglect to obtain such authority , renders, the offender liable to a fine. In the case mentioned the iiawker, being a foreigner and evidently .p^ | awar/e that be was trespassing, -spas not pro secuted for a breach of the "by-law, and in the other case, that of refusing to leave the station premises icben reqnestedto do so, he ' was dealt with very leniently. A special inspection parade of the Roma Rifle Volunteer Corps is to take place on Tuesday, November 9. Colonel French, commandant oi ^a..4^ee^lwd^Dejfe&t;>e Force, has wired to .Captaip<;Ypnog that Tie will inspect the corps on the day named.
