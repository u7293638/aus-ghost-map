THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENTS. MR, LOCKE RICHARDSON'S RECITALS. It would have been difficult to provide seats for another half a dozen persons in addition to those who crowded the Congregational hall last night, and who testified by the warmth of their reception, that Mr Richardson is very far indeed from having worn out his welcome By way of prelude to the "Christmas Carol," he gave that portion of the first Book of Samuel in which the encounter of David with Qohuth is narrated, and recited the episode with dramatic force and iiiiprcssiincllect, although we think the rendering was susceptible of improvement in one particular, namely, that it Uni not sufficiently emphasise the stripling shepherd's exulting sense of the supernatural power that was serving his arm to slay the gigantic champion of the Philistines, St. Paul's farewell to the Ephesians was matt delivered with pathetic feeling and tremulous earnestness, and served to bring out the tenderer and more affectionate side of the character of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, and here also we must note a trifling defect, in that the reciter pronounced the few words of narrative which follow the valediction in precisely the same tone of voice as he represented the Apostle to be speaking in. As to the "Christmas Carol," it is pleasant to be able to declare that it improves Mitta repetition, and that Mr, llieluii Ison's portraits of the characters created by Dickens become mellowed with time, like many tiimousseanvnseB the recital never flagged from beginning to end, unit uns us vigorous and picturesque at its close as at the commencement. Khenercr Screen's Interview with Jacob Marley's ghost was described with a delightful commingling of solemnity and humour, the remorse of the dead partner being strung!) accentuated, and at the same time felicitously committed with the grim drollery of the surviving partners matter of fact interjections and interrogatives 'The festivities at old Fe/isiwiii a, Bob Cratch it's Christmas dinner, and the game of blind man's bullion the parlour of Scrooge's nephew, were set before the audience with the utmost vividness, and tile merriment they excited was not less hearty and general than the attention bestowed upon the more serious passages of the book, in which Its author lins personified Ignorance must Want, and reminded modem society of the terrible dangers to which it is exposed by its neglect of or indifference to its most imperative duties. Old Scrooge s experiences in connection with the Ghost of Christmas yet to come-in de- picting which the imagination of Dickens reaches some of its highest flights-were admirably related by Mr Richardson, and his pictures of the German Jew whom he in- troduces as keeping the marine store shop, and of the Irish charwoman who brings him the dead man's shirt and bedclothes for sale were most lifelike. The reciter was equally happy in marking the sudden and almost hysterical revulsion of feeling which takes place when Scrooge discovers that the three ghosts were visions of the night, and that a new life is possible to him, and the burst of applause which immediately followed the close of the recital must have been as gratify- ing to Mr. Richardson as were the eager attention with which it was listened to throughout and the peals of laughter excited by the more humorous passages " Julius Caesar" is announced for Tuesday night, and three other recitals will constitute what is intended to be a farewell series, although we think Mr. Richardson would do well to repeat the " Christmas Carol," since it is such a favourite with the public
