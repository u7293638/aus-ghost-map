IRELAND'S DISTRESS. Hush! hush ! my children, dry those tears ; Where living's dying death is gain. O God I I would conceal my fears Be hush'd ! your father feels no pain. Still, still, your fears-you've yet a mother ;-- Ah, yes ! a mother too bereft. Why weep before your gasping brother ? Telll him we've five potatoes left. Good God ! some strange deliv'rance send ; How shall I bear the rapid end ! Sweet babes, instead of groans and sighs. Which now you raise to heav'n above, .Jligb proise-bhould rend the vuulied skies, Since each lias still a brother's love. j - ' We, darliiigs,"sa\v, not long ago, What children are devoid of feeling, ,, How brethren swell a brother» woe, ,, uIÎBse hunger's tliroes by savage dealing : ' How bitterly your cousin cried, ' ¡"My peel is stoln, and all beside !" , , ¡ , Then, think of neighbour Morgan's end, , ,Who left a home to save his wife, r , And on his way, from ev'ry friend, , , Lay down-and yielded there his eye. Your father died before our eyes; He kiss'd you all, andlov'd yourimother ; And even now, in bed he lies, ' Beside your starv'd, expiring brother. "'1 What npise is that 1-'tis from the bedi! .'
