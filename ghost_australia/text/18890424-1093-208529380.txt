THE MILE HANDICAP. TO THE EDITOB. Sir—Will you kindly permit me to offer a suggestion to the committee of the S.A, Cyclists' Union regarding One-mile Handicap Bicycle Races? Would it not be well in future where large entries are received for this race to run the race in heats, thereby affording every rider, particularlyrthe scratch men, a chance of winning ? I noticed in the races run under the auspices of the Union last Saturday that the Novices Race was run in this way although there were only nine entries and seven actual starters, whereas in the Mile Second-class Race, which had 21 entrieB and 13 or 14 actual competitors, the men were all started at once, and it waB soon seen that only those having good starts would stand a chance, which proved to be the case, as all the place men had good handicaps, The man on the 10 yards mark—virtually scratch aB the scratch men did- not appear—caught the field, but had not the ghost of chance to pass owing to the track being completely blocked by such a large number of riders; If a novices race with only nine entries is run in heats, surely a field of a much larger number of riders could be run off in the Bame way, thus giving every man a show. In the race mentioned it was a manifest impossibility for the riders near the scratch mark to pass, even though they caught the field. The above is written in quite a friendly spirit, and will. I hope, be accented in the same manner,■ —I am, &e;, G. K. JONES.
