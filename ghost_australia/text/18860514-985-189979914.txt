<$ur Summarg of Home Sfttos. I &3T Compiled from the European Mail, Same Kerr, and other late journals ;— At a recent fancy dress ball a lady ap peared as the Times newspaper, her dress being absolutely composed of that familiar journal. The kilted skirt of printed paper at a distance might hare been of silk, and the body and sleeves were equally unrecognisable until nearly ap proached. The latest telegrams, scissors, pens, sealing-war, and literary materials generally were disposed by way of orna ment over this very extraordinary7 dress. Comicality maybe carried to any extent at a fancy ball, bat as a rule there are but few girls who will sacrifice their own good looks and appearance for the sake of amusing others. Men are not so particu lar, and ah animated red pillar post-box has been seen dancing with a case of bon bons. There is a kind of injury inflicted dur ing the recent riots which money cannot mitigate. There are two cases in which ladies, who were robbed and grossly in sulted in their carriages by the mob, are lying dangerously ill from the shock they received. It is not improbable that their lives will be sacrificed to official imbe cility. A wine merchant named Riollet. aged ; forty-two, living in the Rue de laGaitd, Paris, was murdered last week, and the till was rifled. He was a widower, and a maid-servant was the only other inmate of j the house. It is uncertain whether the , deed was committed in the bar, or whether the murderers had induced him to go : down to the cellar, where the body was found. A scavenger at work nearly op posite heard cries for help, and, looking through a chink in the shatter, saw the gas extinguished. He told a policemau passing on the opposite side of the street that a murder was being committed at the wine merchant's house, but the officer shrugged his shoulders and went on. The result was that the murder was not discovered till two hours afterwards, when . the neighbours were surprised at the shop i 1 MOO Una IntiaW telb# fMii^ it mfrtlttg ®jip8^vfcl* rSamW«i «m wt|uMH^ the Ardidttke Reitter. illifttfi siirffriilto iil^f-L M I"lt^^^1-toijL. aAt i.A Ajf-Jiuafci .

Generally speaking, however, the volume of trade last year was below the average, and this the Liberal Press attributes in chief measure to the spread of protection. The Sultan of Turkey has recently en gaged two German pharmacists to devote themselves entirely to the service of his Court, the salary of each being equal to £1000 a year, with board and lodging in the palace. The Queen has intimated her intention of bestowing a pension of £200 a year from her private purse upon the widow of Principal Tullocli. ... t. The German Emperor entered upon his ninetieth year on March 22, having been born on that date in the year 1797. Twenty-five years have now elapsed since the Emperor William Ascended the throne of his ancestors by the death of his bro ther, Frederick William IT. He as cended the throne when already a man of advanced age, and baring spent his whole life on behalf of his country. Almost a youth when he entered the army, he took a prominent part in the campaigns of 1812 and 1815. On the accession of his bro ther to the throne he was appointed in 1840 Governor-General of Pemcrania, a post which he occupied until the revolu tion of of 1848 compelled him to seek re fuge in this country. Elected a member of the Kation&l; Aesembly, he returned to Berlin, and was shortly afterwards ap pointed .Ooanaatoder-itoOliief of the Prus sian forces sent against the insurgents of axBJten, wnen, owing w tne i II- heai th of his brother, he assumed the Regency. The Ltberal Patty in Germany were elated at the prospect of being governed by a Prince who on so many occasions had evinced the most marked Liberal tenden cies. His accession to power as Regent was hailed by all the Liberals of Germany and combated by the Prussian nobility. But, on being proclaimed King, he so lemnly affirmed the tradition of his house by declaring, on placing the crown on his head, that he received it from God. The Emperor, who is again In excellent health, was able on March 20, for the first time since hiB recent accident, to go out of doors again. In the evening he was pre sent at an entertainment at the Theatre Royal. On his Majesty entering the Royal box, the whole assembly rose to its feet, and cheered the aged sovereign most enthusiastically. His Majesty was accompanied by the Crown Prince, the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and the Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden, the last-mentioned being bis granddaughter. The German Empress was also one of the august company, this being the first time her Majesty has ven tured to attend the theatre for several years past. M. Jules Ferry's head 011 a charger is. according to a correspondent, one of the sights of the Boulevard des Italicns. In the window of the printseller next door to Robert Houdin's Theatre a crowd daily gafees at a very realistic pictorial arrange ment of M. Jules Ferry's head. It is like that of John the Baptist on a silver dish, on which blood seems still to trickle. Between the charger and the head is a scimitar. Life is not extinct, but nearly so. There is the effect of a nimbus in the background. The whole thing looks so natural that when suddenly seen it his a startling and, 110 doubt to main", a sicken- i ing effect. The painting is by a M. lleni> Yaoquelin. Occupation lias at last been found for i the Great Eastern. Arrangements have been completed by a Liverpool firm for ; the bringing of the vessel to Liverpool, • where she will anchor in the Sloync. and be one of the objects of interest during 1 the coming Shippers' Exhibition. She will be fitted up for concerts and other J entertainments, one of which is said to be i a circus. It is cxpeected she will prove a great attraction. Walking is now the correct thing in ' Paris for fashionable ladies, driving being considered somewhat out of date. Ac- j cordingly. Parisian belles conscientiously < take daily constitutionals in the Bois or ; Champs Elysdes, on the model of their f English sisters ; and they adopt very so ber walking costumes, enlivened by a , muff of real spring blossoms.

An unusual scene (says a Scotch paper) took place at a wedding feeing celebrated the other evening in a qvien fenr/i -n the E.-.utl,c, ii , '-nfioca of Aligns.

The bridegroom hid been deprived only seven sronths ago of the partner for nearly half a century d his joys and sorrows, who had left him with a considerable number of "dry notes." The neighbours took unusual in terest in the wedding, and ".wo constables attended to preserve order. The clergy man having been admitted, the outer door of the building was locked to prevent intrusion. The only wedding gTt*»«ts other than the rev, srentterr an were three or four females.
