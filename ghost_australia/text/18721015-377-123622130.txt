AD?c?CrrIO.-You may remember that I lectured lately for the young gentlemen of the Claytonins Society. During the afternoon of that day I was talking with one of the young gentlemen referred to, and he said he had an uncle who, from some cause or another, seemed to have grown permanently bereft of all emotion. And with tears in his eyes this young man said: "Oh! If I could only see him laugh once more l Oh! if I could only see him weep." I was toucahed. I could never withstand distress. I said: " Bring him to my lecture. I'll start him for you," "Oh if you could but do it. If you could but do it, all our family would bless you for evermore, for he is very dear to us. Oh, my benefactor, can you make him laughl? an you bring soothing tears Ito those parched orbs P" I was profoundly moved. I said: "My son, bring the old party round. I hare got some jokes in my lecture that will make him laugh if there is any laugh in lhim, and if they miss itre I have got some others that'il make him ory or kill him, one or the other." Then the young man wept on my neck, and presently spread both bands on my head, and looked up toward heaven, mumbling something reverently, and then he went after his uncle. He placed him in full view,in the second row of benches,, that night, and I began on him. I tried him with mild jokes, then with severe onesl I. dosed him with hIad joks, end riddled'him with good cne'; I tired old 'told jokes into him, and peppered him fore and oft cwithi rd,-hot new ones. I wgrmedup., to my work, and assauhlted him on the right and Je4t, in front and behind; I fumed and charged and slioitd' till I was hoarse and sick, and frantic and furioons--~nt, I never moved himt oicre; I never started a smile or a tear. Never a ghost of a smile, and never a duspition of moisture ! I closed tlhe lecture with one deaspairingi shriek-with onu wild burst of lhmnour-and hnirled a joke of supernatural atrocity full at him. 'It inever phased him! Then I sat down 'bewilderi'ed ad .er hlausted. The president of the society casme up;end, batlled my head in cold water, and said, "Whit made you carry on so towards the lastP" A sidi,"ulpras trying to make that confounded old idiot I.righ in the' second row." And he said, 'Well,; you wereveasting your time, because he is doafland luihb, a.das.bllind as a badger." Now, was that any waylor dnold tiib?ahn' nephew to impose on a stranger and orphan like .sanP -fark 2iain. A countryman stared for full lire miionmutes at.t? placard " Cast Iron Sinks"' exhbibiteda in apl ra shop. At last he triumphantly asked, "Wisp ay?yk doesn't P" and walked off, chuckling.
