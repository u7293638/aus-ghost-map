All over but Shouting. IT is rumored that the Reform Leagues throughout the colony intend competing at the Doll Show that is to be held shortly. The Leagues mean to turn an honest penny by exhibiting their nominees for Parliament as " the best speaking dolls." Itis expected that Mr, J. J. Casey will take first prize, with Mr. H. R. Williams close up. The prize money will go to augment the languishing funds- of the League. If this rumor as to the competition be true, it will be useless for anybody else to exhibit in the "speaking dolls'' class. They wouldn't stand even the ghost of a doll of a show.
