'? 1 feelas if 1 had been lining in ii cuurcb, or iu oue u£ those great hotel uiuiiig-roouis abri-ad, with table dbote all to ourselves.' They grew ^uiie at home in tbe old bouse, however, iu a, very few dsiys, and -ibyl went singing up uud down tbe ioug c irridyis iu her clear soprauo, like a joyou-s Oicd. ouly tuiuldug now and then that there might be gu-istti, uud that she might coiue suddeuly upou oue in a dusky coruer.

They came to a little green urcade, and through tbiB into the Pompeian court, where the Colonel sat on his musnud, with his back against the marble rim of the basin, snoring, audibly. He woke up with a start as the maid announced Sir Francis Clevedon, swore a prayer or two, or perhaps something the reverse of o prayer, and then rose to receive his guest in a hearty soldier-like fashion. ' Take the arm- chair. Sir Franci3, and if you like a hookah, there's one ready to your hand ou that table. Heartily glad to see any friend of Sinclair s— congratulate you on taking pos session of Clevedon. Fine old place, noble old place, plenty of good shoo tin , and one of fie best trout streams in the couutry. Sinclair wrote me word of your return, and I meant to have come over to call before this, but this whither tries an old man, sir. I feel the heat more Jfere than ever I did in Bengal. I '11 turn on tbe fountain, by the bye ; I daresay you like the souud 'fa fountain; and thereupon the Colonel applied himself to some complicated arrangement of screws and cranks which seem ed to involve a good deal of hard labour, and threatened to put tlie gallant officer into a pro fine perspiration. ' Pray don't trouble yourself on my account' remonstrated ir Francis. ' I find your room in .^t delightfully cool, even without the foun | tain. ' ' Do you?' cried the Colonel, gratified, aud | smiiing iu the midst of his struggles with a ; very stiff screw ' Built it myself after my I own design; laid every brick with my own 1 band, oue bricklayer's labourer, and an odd b iy to hold the ladder. There's a settlement iu that corner, buc it won't go any farther. I But well have the fountain. 1 like to take a out --f the water-company, because they won't let uie pay by meter. Made the fountain my self from a plan which a fool of a plumber told w ; w.is opposed to every principle of eugiueer inir; but it works, you see, in spite of the begg.ir,' concluded tae Colonel triumphantly. ?ii the water shot up with au explosive sound like a small Niagara, then flew off at a tangent, liberally besprinkliug Sir Fraucis, aud at luht composed itself into-a. quirk, quirk, guggle, guggle, guggle, quirk, of tlie meekest descrip tion.
