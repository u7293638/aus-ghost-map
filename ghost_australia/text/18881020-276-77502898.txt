ftabies' Column. Outside the Party. Thick throng the snow flakes, the evening is dreary, - 591 Glad rings the ninsic in yonder gay hall ; Ou her who listens here, friendless and weary, - ?? ? > Heavier chill than the winter's doth fall. At yon clear window, light-opened before me, Glances the face I have worshipped so well; -There's the fine gentleman, grand in his . gtoi-y ; 1 There the fair smile by whose sweetness I foil. . V;:-. ;This is akin to him, shunned and forsaken, That at my besom sobs low, without bread ; Had not such pleading my marble heart shaken, . I had been quiet, lonjg since, with the dead. Oh ! could I enter there, ghastly and squalid, Stand iu men's eyes with my spirit o'er borne, Show them where roses bloomed, crushed now and pallid, What he found innocent, leaving forlorn How the, fair ladies would fail from their | dances, . . ., . . Trembling; aghast at my horrible tale ! How would he shrink from my words arid my glances ! . How would they shrink from him, swooning . ' and pale ! ? ' This is the hair that was" soft to enchain i ^ him ; Snakelike; it snarls on my beautiless brow; i These are the bands that were fond to de- i tain him With a sense-magic then,-powerless now 1, . .i No ; could I come, like a ghost, to affright ? him,. .' ??? ?] llow should-that heal my wound; silence my pain 1 Had I the wrath of God's lightniug to smite ? .*.him, ?? ? ,?????????.? J. . That could not "bring me my lost peAce i again. Ne'er let him grieve while good fortune be tide'him, ' * Ne'er count again the poor game lost of old ;? When he comes forth, with his young bride beside him, . Here shall they find us both, dead in the cold.
