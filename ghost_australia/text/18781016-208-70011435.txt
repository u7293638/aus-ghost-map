" LosnoN, August 30th. (Fes on om. o? Corlespod .t..) The.last mail left us in the midst of a great de ate bon foreigni policy, initiated by i,?d Hartington. The division was taken lante on the fourth night of the discussion, and the Government had a majority: of full 140. On the day following this triumph, the Premier and Foreign Secretary received the honorary freedom of the City of London amid cou siderable pomp and circumstance. The annual Ministerial' banquet at the Mansion House was given by the Lord Mayor the same evening. Parlia ment was prorogued on the 16th instant. Although in the full flush of their success, the Ministry are not altogether happy. The two latest bye elections have gone against them, which shows that the feel ing of the. country is not so decidedly in their favor as their friends pretend. At tNewcastle under-Tyne the Liberals wrested a seat fromi the Tories; and in Argyllehire, where the Tories made a determined effort to return the compliment, they sustained a discouraging defeat. The Tocaney in Argyllahirewas cansed by the appointment of the Marquis of Lorne a Goverior- Geneal of Canada, and the Marquis's younger brother, Lord Colina Campbell,, stood as the Liberal candi:tate.

He isa staunch Ministcrialist, and an ardent admirer of Lord Beaconsfield's Eastern policy. The struggle was and a keen one, and party feeling ran very high.- Mri. Malcoli was verrvconfident of success on accounnt of his high estimation with the tenantry, whom he is said to treat more generously than the ducal Hotrse of Argyll gets credit for doing.i.

The Queen's speech is much'of a piece, 'with the other utterances. of Ministers, only. a trifle tamer and,more dull.: In one, or two passages, however,. there, is a touch of. uniintentional frankness : which is truly refreshing.

Russia' turn to seors diplomatic "victories" seems at' hand; and there is no certainty that her contre cop in Cabiil' will prove mere sham and illusion. The 'Bositian Begs are resisting to the deathtlhefulfilment if that mandate which Lord Salisbury moved: that the Congress should give Austria to wrest their country from their Sovereign by way of "strengthening" him. ' "The Bulgarians are now accused, perhaps with some justice, of wreaking vengeance on the race whieh so long oppreied them. Nobody could have expected them, when they got the upper hand, to forg''the' terrible prevocation they had received; and they must have been more than mortal to ab staifi altogether from reprisals. :Neither is it among thli ordinttions of the Almighty .that those who have rcevelled 'in devilry shall nee reap aught of that they have sown. British consuls who were unconsesionably selow to detect Turkish atrocities are now quiick enough to spy out and exaggerate 81av excesses. They do not wait till their tales are veri fied; and it is to be feared that they thickly varnish where they do not absolutely invent them. All re liable testimony shows that the Bulgarians are a quiet, patient, and industrious people, with some of the vices of men who have been long enslaved, but by no means naturally or habitually cruel. They wilfully slander them who say otherwise. There is scarcely a spot affected, directly or indi rectly, by the recent "seacttlement" where ominous signs and portents are_ not visible. Of course no reasonable iana would exict things immediately to calm 'down and shake themselves right after an up heaving such as has lately occurred, even if the treaty arrangenents come to had been the best tlhat human wisdom aind honesty could devise.

Odd coincidence, the Catholic Church in France, like the Established; Church in England, suffers from a common affliction-the supply of clergymen is falling short. ,The harvest never was greater, nor the laborers so few. Saving, souls does:not. pay, from the worldly point of view., The AbbuBou gund,'of Orleans, laments the number of parishes in France in want of spiritual advisers, of. vicars, as well as of curates. le does not attribute the cause, as is usual with many fossilised. politicians,,to the Free Thinkers.and the Republicans, butnsimply, to young,men preferring a. more. lucrative. calling Localities that were, renowned, like smany,families, .for, feeding ;the,; priesthood, with ,candidates,now cease todo so.. ,The' consequence .is,,that, there are, 28,000 parishes.,in France deficient'in clergymen, and 3,000 more, where there is neither ch?ch nor Ipriest.
