Make half a point south,' itsaid. Instantly leyncht was squared away asindicated, when, oining full before the wind, hopib-slieots .vcre torn away one by oue, top-sail shivered for a moment in the gale and then was ripped out, and fluttered away like ft cloud ; yet, all unmindful of the wreck above and below, the man at the helm kept her bow that half a point south, for there lay the nar row inlet, dangerous and uncertain in fairest weather, as its breakers roared and broke, but now a desperate, almost a hopeless chance. Margaret Baunton ' held the Professor's arm with a fierce grip. M Will the man make the inlet?' she asked. 41 Is he sure to do it? ' ?4 I don't know; it is a poor chance/* the Professor said. ' Cut why more anxiety for that handsome, daring devil at tlie liclm than for tho two or three other men there, Mar garet ? ' ' k ' Can you look at the different men, and * ask that ? lie stands erect, head and shoulders above tliem all. From here you can see the coward-look in their shrinking figure?, but there is none in his.' He is not careless of his life ; he ia bending every nerve and musclc to pave himself and them, and yet, when he will $e within a single moment of his death, he will not more certainly look it in the face than he is doing now. Why should I not give my sympathy to the brave man inptead of to the cowards there? ' 'Because, Margaret, tlie cowards there may have wives and children at home ; and that fellow lias none, or he would give tliis lee-shore a wide berth.' Then a cloud of suspicion or doubt fell be tween these two that had never been there be fore, and they walked on down the beach to the inlet in silence which neither cared to disturb. The Professor was annoyed aud vexed by tlie girl's interest in this stranger, who guided his boat among the breakers with such free and skilful daring ; and she, too, was annoyed that the Professor, always before just and generous, should withhold any ercdit from the brave fellow out there, strugg ling so graudly for life. Vet what could it matter to the old Pro fessor for whom she interested herself? Were not his loves and romances away back there among the dead Hellenic fables ? He had said » fio, yet the man's heart beat uneasily when he caw this girl, whom he had grown to consider his very own by every tie of gratitude and affection, bestowing herrsympathy and show ing deep feeling for another, and' that other a stranger ; dimly seen as yet far out at sea. He had forgotten, in his annoyancc ut Margaret, to watch the course of the yacht, when a sharp cry from her suddenly drew his attention to the* struggling boat. An ugly squall bad struck her at an imminent mo ment, tearing out the deck fastenings, which held the main-sail square away, and in an in stall* ft was flung aloft, caught by the gale, and wound about and around the pliant mast, whigJV bent like steel. -Top-sails and jibs and mainsail were gone, and nothing left but the foresail now, which, in the flawy gale, threat ened momentarily to jibe, in which ease all previous efforts would be rendered futile. But the blue-coated sailor at the helm held the little vessel on her course as undaunted as if lie knew every drop of water under him. The roar and thuuder of the surf were too deep for those on shore to bear his voice, but from his | gestures they knew that he was giving orders which were not obeyed by the demoralized crew. The yacht was of twelve feet beam, while ihe entrance to the inlet was barely twenty (eel in all. So that even in ease the sailor's quick eye detected the very centre of the channel# he would have scarcely four feet of water on either gunwale. Captain Brown stood among his men, who, resting on the sides of ihe life-boats, keenly watched the daring sailor. 41 She never ken make it, Cap'en Brown ; c( he luffs, sh'll jibe, an* eC he don't luff, that bit of canvas 'ill go by the wind,' Raid a smoky'Skitmed, wheezy- voiced old fellow at the Captain's side. 'Well now, I don't know about that, William. Ita's oncertain. You see, that j'oungiellow's peart, he is, and he's got true grit, an' he's plucky, an' he's got a clear eye &Q;* jo. steady, coaLhand, an' he wouldn't sur prise roe it he^^, after all,' the Captain drawled out, s^Mtiously. The yacht am approached the mouth of f,he seething tall of the breakers that already sprang at' her bows and leaped upon her dock, wbec sbelurched to leeward, and her fore-sail, f which hitherto had stood the fury of the gale unscathed, parted from bourn to gaff, and .directly v&s; only a flaunting mass of ribbons in thewtn^-4 were hurriedly run down to the gj^^^^Kjj^^±^nanned, and a dozen * ready to launch them v^^^^^^^^^^Bl'itruck the bar. But eh e did^^^^^^^^p She was suddenly put ha^^^^^^HPhe gale caught a few yards unfurled about the peak, t^^^^^^^knand at the helm, and wliilc looked on and held their ^^^^^^^^nft&drcd; seconds might bc up her bow again, gtrug^^^^^^^^^B'last defeated breaker, plunged and rose, and quietly into the river* haste or excitement ifce vSntauflned down ; after Home trunks and baggage were brought up from below, her shattered sails weye fuded, her rigging cut away, her decks cleared, her yawl was laun ched, the luggage stowed into it, and then the crew and the blue-coated sailor landed. He was met by the wrecking-master, who | extended his brawny hand in token of wel come and fellowship for the old fellow had boon a sailor before the other was born. ' Thanks for your timely signal, Captain. The little Argo would scarcely have brought us safely to shore without it ; and in that ease tho golden fleece would have been alto gether lost to me, I am afraid.' ' I dunno about that fleece, Cap'cn, but I do know you've just saved your bacon, and although 1 say it to your face, which I shouln't, you're a brave fellow, and I'd like to shake hands agen if you don't mind it ; also, while you're here, I'd like it mightily if you'd make my house your own, just to stay at or come and go to, as' you like; a bed's better nor a hammock any time, and similarly, dry land bettor nor water; but,' said the Cap tain, 44 why in thunder did you, a peart enough sailor, as I've seen to-day, run onto a lee-shore in a nor'-easter? ' 'The last thing first, then, Captain. The yacht has settled sis inches since she crossed that last breaker; that strained and ham mered her to death ; but she was sinking be fore the gale cameon,andlranonalcc-shore, thinking only of beaching her as a desper ate chance for life ; just then I saw your inlet hero, made for it, and got my course by your signal, and here I am, and there's my hand, and I will take your bed, and again a thou sand thanks to you for my safety.' 'You ought 'to thank God for it, young mail ; for when the sea rose up to swallow you nlivc, it was His hand, not mine, that parted the waters and delivered you.' 'I do thank God,' the sailor said, 'with all my heart, my friend, aud ? ' Something just then blanched the brave young fellow's face whiter than the threatened death out there had done. Whatwasit? What I had stopped the ready current of his talk, cut- i ting short his specch? What was it that made his hand tremble up to his mouth in that weak, uncertain way ? Not anything iu the old Captain's manner ; not the soft, brown eyes of the girl, timidly bent upon him; not the quiet, controlled eyes of the man .on whose arm she leaned. Yet, for a hurried moment, he was cowed, as no mere physical danger could have done ; he seemed to the girl to have suddenly lost his height of stature and bravery of bearing; to shrink and tremble before the man at her side. She looked alternately into their faces for an answer to his curious behaviour but when she turned to the Professor, the usual grave, reticent smile was on his lips, and if the two men had over met before, there was no sign of it in the Professor's eyes, which looked dully into the eyes of the sailor, absent of meaning or recognition. When, still perplexed at the unsolved riddle, she turned again to the .other man, he was shaking hands gayly enough with the old wrecking-master ; then he gave some direc tions quietly and coolly to his crew about his luggage and the sinking yacht. Hisiace was turned fully toward her, and she noticed that the pallor and fright were gone from it ; that bis manner was easy and pos sessed ; that, as he looked toward her, there was a bright, boyish smile in his eyes ; and \yhcn Captain Brown presented Mr. Luke Counor to her and the Professor, the two men gravely saluted each other after tlie fashion of gentlemen, and she noticcd*the hits of talk succeeding had nothing different in them from other bits of talk likely to chance be tween two intelligent persons when intro duced to each other. ' We must congratulate you on your escape,' the Professor said. ' Your vessel is sinking, 1 think you told the Captain.' 44 Yes, she leaked badly before, but that last thumping she got in the inlet was too much for her. She will be gone in an hour, if she is not already aground.' ' Then,' said Margaret, her rare, sweet smile mocking the gravely spoken words, 44 1 am afraid the modeni Jason will have all the dangers of the voyage and pursuit, without finding the treasure lie seeks.' Luke Connor looked far out to sea as the girl stopped speaking, as if he weighed the dangers he had passed, before he answered her. 44 I am not so sure of that,' he said presently. 41 The gods of to-day, I fancy, are as vigilant and strong as those older ones; indeed, I am not sure they are not the same, and who knows that they did not send the New Argo there, to this shore, knowing that here the modern Jason might find what he sought ? Adventurers are sailing to-day over every sea in search of it ; one is hunting it in the mines of California or Australia, another in India or Japan, but everybody is hunting it some where. I think the golden fleece of to-day is only auother name for happiness, and I am as likely to find it here as elsewhere.' Tlie man's voice had grown low aud solemn and prophetic, and the girl, noticing his changed manner, looked at him curiously. If then he had given one bold glance into the pure brown eyes before him, or had dared to cast a single admiring look at her, or at the bright masses of the golden hair, waving so luxuriantly about her neck and face, she would have caught the hidden sense of his meaning, and it she had, she would have avoided him forever after. But his eyds did not oncc meet hers, they being still bent far out at sea ; and the girl, too simple and true to be suspicious or to take alarm, only simply wondered where, among the melancholy groves of that grim shore, the golden prize might hang. But the Professor, quicker of thought than she, and more suspicious too, knew that Mar garet had curiously attracted Lukti Connor/ and that the tawny hair floating about her form typified to the reckless sailor Jason's fab- led fleecc. The Argo had settled at flood tide, but her deck still showed above the surface of the shallow river. 'She lies safe enough there,' Luke said. 44 If you think her traps worth the trouble, she is yours to dismantle, Captain Brown, but her hull is sprained and thumped to pieces.' lie looked back regretfully at the sunken wreck. They had been good friends together, the man and his boat. If, as he said, the golden fleecc was only another name for happiness, he had sought that in many places in his yacht. They had shared a good mauy dangers, lived true, brave lives together, strug gling and wrestling with tempest and sea, and now the old Argo lay there in that hole of a river, sunk and worthless. It had been a better life than any he knew on shore. That was a fever of dissipation, a round of pleasure that was unwholesome and vile. The only love he knew there was the love that he had bought. The lips that kissed the pure brow of Psyche, had kissed no pure Zips sincc ; the hand made bloody on that long-ago com mencement night had never been clear again, he morbidly fancied. Yet in every hour of this man's plunges into vice and wretched ness, his true, nobler self cried out for some thing better— for the sweet, manly life he had once known — for friendship and love. But he knew that men looked coldly on him ; that fathers of pure girls never asked him to their houses ; that, mixed with the sincerest interest men ever showed him, there was more than one 'half morbid curiosity. He knew, when he met his former friends face to face, that if they noticed liim at all, which few did, they were quietly wondering, as they passed on their opposite way, how a murderer must feel ; what must he the daily life of a man who has o.fcaped hanging, or what distempered fancies of the murdered victim tortured him by uight. If lie could have answered them at all, ho would have said that no thought of beinS hanged, that 110 ghost of the dead man who had wronged his sister, ever came to him by day or night. But while no ghost ever haunted him, sleeping or waking, the awful crime of which his soul stood guilty was like a second self, clinging close as his skin, urg ing him forever into the Lethe of riot and dis sipation. He only lived to forget, to get rid for awhile of himself; and the pity of it all was, that underlie crust of vice that was on it, there was a true, manly, noble self, fall of generous impulses, capable of heroic achieve ments, worthy of good men's honor and affectionate regard; but indeed it was true, lie had buried it all very deep, so that men went on remembering his crime, after they should have forgiven and forgotten the actors in it. Wliile the men whom lie had known in that old, happier time placed a gulf, impossible to bridge over, between him and them, it was curious that women and little children, with their pure, unerring instincts, came close to and loved the man. It might have becu partly his genuine, hearty manner, or his superb beauty, alive and magnetic with health and strength, or his free thought and free speech that beguiled them and won their hearts ; but whatever it was women and chil dren had been very tender of his faults and loving of Luke Connor. As he walked beside Margaret Dauuton from tlie beach to the farm- house, his in stincts telling him how pure and gentle a womau she was, his sense showing him how beautiful and intelligent she was, he felt as he had never done before ; his crime weighed heavily upon him, and he knew with deadly certainty that the once sweet waters of life that he had muddied, he must drink to the end; that a pure woman, saintly in thought and deed, was not for him to gather to his breast. Other men, with clean hands and un sullied name, might strive to wiu, and somo one marry her ; but he alone was shut out and under the ban. In that same hour, if the old Argo, lying a sunken, worthless week in the river there, could have been made seaworthy again, he would have plunged once more into the breakers with her, no matter how the bar threatened, nor what storms prevailed or I winds blew. Better the sudden death out 1 | yonder, than to live to bear this girl's re- . | proach. It was not that she had already be I come essential to him, but it was natural that ? I a man cut of! from white bread for many lorig years, should loathe the black loaf for ever held to his hps, and hunger for the other; or that a barefooted beggar, passing the boundaries of a fair domain, should pause for a while to behold how fair it was, and then to wish that the title to it should be made clear to him and his heirs forever ; especially natural would it seem if the beg gar's tastes fitted him to enjoy such an estate. He, Luke Connor, was the man who had eaten only of the black bread of bought, vicious pleasures, whose nature cried out hun grily for better food ; he was the barefooted beggar, gazing* over the wall of a beautiful domain, whose fruitful acres stretched away to the sea and sky-line— a wall which he might never cross, lest the cry of the keeper be raised against him, and he be hunted' down. He felt that he was not a man while he could not say to this giii's mother, ' Give me your child, for I love her.' Other men might go to her, telling the reverential love they felt, but he never might. lie could never do that; his hands were bloody ; and if it were right for the State, or Justice, to take life at all, he had no right to his life even. It had been saved, and the State, or Justice, cheated out of it by a quib ble, a lawyer's shrewd eloquence, or the whim of a soft-hearted jury ; so he felt that he bore his life even under a false pretence, and that it had been forfeited long ago. Yet no man loved life better than he loved his. It was sweet and good to him from the rising to the setting of the sun ; and no man would have fought more desperately to preserve it, if a struggle came. But it could never be a man's full life, he thought, unless he might love and marry as other men could. He knew the danger before^ him when it was only an hour old, but he did not flee from it. Let tho surly keeper come, lie said ; but lie would first sec the beautiful fields, the long, dim paths, the friendly shadows of the trees, smell the fragrance of tho flowers and hoar the songs of birds and plash of fountains. Let the keeper come ; the beggar would have climbed the wall and seen with his own eyes how broad and fair the landscape was, and as he was turned out again to wander over the rough highways, eating his black bread, what he had seen and heard would be a pleas ant and happy memory to him forever. So, Luke Connor resolved to linger for a day or two, with the beautiful woman, under tho old wrecking- master's roof, and then he would go back to the love that could be bought and pleasures that bury self and bring forgetful ncf;s. But he never would forget, that he had seen Margaret Daunton, and that, for a day or two, he had stood up before her, ac counted worthy of her regard and honor. But he did not go after a day or two, nor yet after many days. He, too, after long, rough years, sat down by the sweet waters and ate of the blissful lotus, which brought dreamful ease and forgetfulness of crime and trouble. He sent to town to have his horses brought down, ho discarded his sailor's suit, and robed himself bravely, as a man does who wishes to appear at his best in the eyes of the woman lie loves. The story of that old farm-house was re peating itself at every watering-place, large and small, along the whole Atlantic coast, and at every summer retreat in mountain or valley. The old, old story, forever beautiful and new, of two people of opposite sex, coming directly to believe that 'all for love, and the world well lost ' is the only true religion. Margaret Daunton and Luke Con nor had learned that faith on the sands, that day by the sea, I think ; but then they only saw, as in a glass, darkly ; and now, after these many days of rides and walks and Bun set wanderings they would have died at the stake for if» bravely as any bigot of the olden time for his higher creed. This was all very bad for. the grave old Professor indeed. He had made a terrible mistake of it. If he had only, in those old days at home, been less blind, less devoted to his 6tupid books, less interested in his Greek poetry and College duties ; if he had only loved his Hellenic heroines less, and cared more for the beautiful, loving girl whom his stupid affection called sister 1 But he had been so secure in his possession of the yellow-haired little girl that he had been in no hurry to fall in love with and marry her. There, at home, his dear old mother played house-dog, keeping watch and ward at the gate, driving all )-oachcrs away; but here, in this summer holiday, came this barefooted beggar, Luke Connor, claiming the fair domain, and making out a good title to it, too.
