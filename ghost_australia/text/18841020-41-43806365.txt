The lot were very punctual in arriving at the post, and after a little delay caused by Ironhand bolting, Mr. Watson dropped his_ flag. There was some scrambling among the middle division as they got on their legs, and from the Stand the first to begin appeared to be Privateer, Martini-Henry, Claptrap, Lavington, Yately, and Fryingpan. The lot came on in fair line for 100 yards, when Lavington over powered Weazel and dashed to the front As they lsegan to settle into their [places Yately was following the leader, with Bend Or, Vergy, Battali ons, and Privateer at the head; of the others, the rear being brought up by Agent and Malua. At the Stand Lavington led Yately a length, and) then came Battalions, Helena, and Veniet, with Verey, Rapid, Norfolk, Lord .Wilton, Fryingpan, Martini-Henry, Colstoun, and Bend Or in eooa places, while Malua and The Agent were still whipping in. Signor fell opposite the Judge's box, and created some confusion among the rear most horses. Going np the hill Lavington was pulled back to Yately, and Batalious and Helene still ljing together were just clear of Vergy.Norfolk, and Rapid, who were heading the main body, in the centre of which Colstoun's rose iacket was very conspicuous. As they began to make the descent Yately took up the running, and carried them alone at a clipping pace, Lavington lying second, with Helene and Battalions in their original placts, and Eapid, Lord Wilton, Norfolk, and Verey well clear of a bunch, among -which the colours of Fiyingpan, Martini- Henry, Colstonn, and Claptrap were conspicnon3, while Mam had de serted the company of The Agent, and was going up to his field on the outside. Racing along the far side of the course, Yately increased his advan tage to three lengths, and Lavington, Helene, Battalions, Rapid, and Lord Wilton kept then positions, but Norfolk struck Vergy, and the favourite dropped back several places, while it could now be seen that Colstoun was failing to stand his ground. Yately held his own round the far turn, Helene was doling on Lavington, and Lord Wilton joined Battalions, while Blink Bonny could be seen catching her horses on the ontsids, and Fryingpan was also^ improv ing his place, bnt Vergy was still lying with the ruck, and Colstonn was rapidly lading away. Tately continned to lead them along the bend, bnt before tbe half-mile post was reached Helene had passed Lavington and got to the grey's girths, the tockleys mare being' very closely attended by Battalions and Lord Wilton, with Blink Bonny coming up hand over hand on the out side, the only others left with any chance now being Vergy, Fryingpan, Claptrap, and Martini Henry. Blink Bonny made her run at the turn, and Helene 'cominz with her the pair .'caught Yately, and Blink Bonny taking a clear lead she polled in next the rail* as they entered the straight, and, 'With~BlaIr looking nrand-at- Lin pursuers,— tt- was evident the race was all over. Vergy here made a great! run on- the outside, 'and f or a-moment his name was Bhonted as the winner, bnt, though he passed Helene, this was all h8 could accomplish, and though Lord Wilton, who had followed_ the Tasmanian mare and Helene into the straight, headed the latter at the distance and struggled on he could never catch Blink Bonny, who won easily by nearly three lengths. Malua was set going at the top of the straight, and came like a shot from a pun at the finish, and was only beaten by a neck for third place, with Claptrap fifth, Helene sixth, Fryingpan seventh, and Martini-Henry eighth. Then came a cluster altogether with Bend Or the absolute last Time. 2 min. 42J sec . WINNERS OP THE CAUXFIELD CUP. ... .'. .... . ^. |* | .Horse...' ; '.'.
