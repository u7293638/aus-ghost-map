BITTER SWEETS ' AiQ¥E STORY*, BytJoseph Hattoit. CHAPTER XJ.VI. AIL SOU LOVE. \- 'X^leit^iie* iinerfil was over, HarryThornlull left SummerdaJe to astonish. Maryport with his presence in Beckford Square, having previously oomnmnicated by letter witaWelfoid and Co., and 'iPrank -Jrey. ? the ships' niasts still looked over -the' houses Snto the square, and the sailors, and the men wiffi ,big whiskers and short necks, and the well-to-do merchants pushed past each other, as they had done -when Harry left it ; but he -was amazed, to see so few faces that lie recognised, and not one ?human being who remembered him. . ? Did you ever know a young follow named ThomhillP' he asked, stopping one of the deputa-' tion, which had waited upon him years ago, to ask permission for themselves and a numberof, friends to present him with a parting testimonial. ' 'ThornhUl, ThoruhiU,' said the burly ship's broker, cocking his little round head on one side, ;like the parrot in his own office, ' Thornhill, no.' ' ? He ?was very much respected, I think, once in Maryport, though for my part, I think he was a fool,' said Harry, smiling snecringly, as if he were really not speaking of himself. \- * Humph ! very likely.' . ' I understood he knew you/ said Harry. 'Knew me! .Thornhill, Thornhill— might have iinown me, sir; but I never know him. Fellows. trag sometimes of mere acquaintances/ said the Maryport broker, twirling his heavy watch chain. : . .'He was a member of the firm of Welford and iCo,,' eaid Harry. « Welf ord and Co. ?— should think not.' '.?? I believe he was,' persisted Harry. 'In fact/ I know he was.' 'Everybody knows welford ana (jo.j.tnaxs their place of business, yonder,' said the broker, pointing to the old portico and the dingy doorway which Harry knew so well. ' Yes, he was junior partner, I think, this Thoralrill, years ago,' said Harry, who, to tell the truth, felt uncomfortable at the complete way in which his name appeared to have been wiped out. Some people think they would like to walk the earth in spirit, after death. They would soon be .glad to go back to their winding-sheets, under the ?'quiet green turf. They would flit about among their most familiar friends, and perhaps never hear their names mentioned. They would eee the world going on comfortably in their absence ; they would be confounded at the clever way in which come ijody else had popped into their place, and ful £lled ' those onerous duties,' which it was thought must go to the wall with the death of the gentte ?snan ' who had fulfilled that office bo admirably tor fiverflnd-twenty years.' Vacant places are filled in ?fie most surprising way. Young men hop into pld eeats, and begin to write letters, and sign cheques, just as well as the able and accomplished departed, who were to have left places behind them, that never could be filled up. When Squire Mountford laid his head upon his pillow without power to raise it again, they said the poor of .Helswick, the institutions of Helswick, the schools biHelswick would never more have such a. friend j but Paul Massey stepped into the vacated place, and the poor people, and the institutions, and the schools -were og well cared for as over thoy had been. 'When Harry Thornhill disappeared, you know, wiselieads were shaken, and it was thought that a certain department in tie house of Wclford and Co., would be 'in a pretty pickle.'. Young frank Grey, however, sat him down, and -the 'ships came and went as usual, and a certain department Cub efficiently managed as ever it had been be . If you had told old Mentz before Mr. Howard's death that Luke would have been of as much assistance to, the bank as his father, he would have treated you to a growl of contempt and perhaps diought to himself , 'Ah, I hope old Wenfcs-will go first; for it will be hard work to get ou without Howard/ But wo must not leave Harry Thornhill and that pompous broker standing at the entrance to . lieeklom square. 'He was a junior partner,* Harry hod re-i Seated. 'Ah, yes, now I think of it, I do remember! something of him,' said the broker, cocking his liead on the other side for a change, ' I do re Winber — he was blown up in a steamer, or got -lronk, and tumbled off a coach, or. something — oh, jes, now I remember.' \- 'Indeed,' said Harry, coolly, 'thank you.' * I say — here — why do you want to know about this fellow? — anything in the wind ?' . 'Nothing — good morning,' said Harry, turning on his heal; forliedidnotrelishthemanlEmaiiiier 'towards his departed self. He remembered how tills same gentleman had spoken, for himself and jfriends, on that testimonial question, and howful ?sonio im had been in his flattery. The broker was bald-headed now, and had to wear false teeth ; but '.d also hearts, Harry began to think, were almost oe ;*ommon as false teeth. , At length Harry buttoned his coat as if ho -were labout to encounter a giant, and disappeared be neath the portico of the well-known house of Wel ford and Co. \- Nobody in the lower offices knew liiw. Frank '?Grey, who had ecarcely overcome the surprise and amazement with which he had read Mr. Thom iill'e letter, received his former patron in Harry's own room, with sincere manifestations of wonder ing .i°y ? I can hardly believe my own eyes,' Eaid Frank. / ' Ditto,' said Harry, . ' for you're become on ?*.stonishingly fine gentleman since I saw you last, Prank — why, you've grown three inches at least, ana you .altogether astonish me — whiskers and manhood, and all have come iong ago, I see.' ; Frank laughed, and said, ' Let me feel your hand again — are you sure yon are not a ghost?' 'Quite,' said Hairy; 'Where's Mr. Welford?' ?Ho never comes near the office now, sir; he (travels about for tiie benefit of his^health.' ??Travels,' said Harry, 'why, he must be eighty five.' ? He is all that,' said Frank ; * and if it were not I for the gout he would be quite nimble.' . ' And how's Miekleton P' (the second partner) . ' Dead sir — two years since.' ?Poor Mick/ said Harry, pausing for a few, minutes, in respect to the good man's memory. ?And Bailey?' (the third partner). '- 'He's in Paris at present, and quite well, X be- lieve.' A hundred other questions Harry asked about a hundred different men and things, and Frank sat and. wondered, and told him everything, including r«ome of his own trials and troubles. . 'But I am very glad indeed that I havetiot 'taken your place altogether/ said Frank j 'I tthould hardly have known how; to meet you, had you returned and found me the junior partner.* ?Why not? You are over- scrupulous, Frank. rl was dead to all intents and purposes, so far as tyomrere concerned. I was drowned sixteenyears ago, sir— I heard my own passing-bell tolled, and ?saw the fishermen searching for iny body. But of 4hat at a. future time.
