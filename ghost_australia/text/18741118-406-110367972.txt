" IT IS A FACT " Sib,-—I felt somewhat amused while per using tlie rambling statements contained in a letter purporting to have co'ne from the pen of a "Walking Ghost-statement which should not be allowed toj*o unchallenged,and wbieh no one should make unless they have the very best proof togoon. I will only-„ take up one—which refers to the salaries of I lie Town Clerks of Moonta and Kadina. Ghosts. no doubt, may have the power prowling about and listening to the conversa tion of passers-by, but I never yet heard of ghosts troubling themselves aboi.t l>a'.ance» sheets, etc., to ascertain facts. If " Walking Ghost" had done so, be would never have made the assertion that the Sadina Council paid more for the services of a Cierk than that of the Moonta Council. From published statistics I give the following figures, which will prove more effective than thing I could write in refutation of " Walking Ghost's" statements:—For two and a half ' years services—i>z., from August, 1872, to Dec., 1874, the Town Clerk has received £159 for his services as such, and for office accommodation. For the same ppriod, the . Town Clerk of Moonta has received £213 as salary, and for office accommodation. It will at once be observed that the Town Clerk of. Moonta has received £54 more than the Town Clerk of Kadina. .Now, Sir, I don't wish, in drawing comparisons, to make oat* that the latter officer is overpaid ; fsir from it.. I consider he is considerably underpaid, seeing that he is really-the:best man that could be got to fill the position of Town; Clerk in Moonta, and is deserving of ntoro support than has as yet been accorded him; by ihc* Councillors. I want simply to put " Walking Ghost" in the right track ; and hope that in future he' will give facts, and not hearsay statements. —I am, Ac., JUSTICE. Moonta, Nov, 16,1874.
