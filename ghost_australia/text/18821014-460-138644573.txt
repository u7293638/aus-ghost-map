THE ESSAYIST. CREDULITY. " Wewra born to raise ourselves. And no true una Buffers belief in this ever to be torn from hla heui' —UOKTHB. Credulity, whether blindly tmreagonine reverentially docile, or implanted and up! reared by early culture and patient induction seems generally scattered in human nature with an equable impartiality. The aame I man will not nnfreqnently surprise you to day by his exacting spirit of demonstration, j and bis contempt for the finer feelings of j moral evidence, who last week bewildered j you by his unreasoning credulity and blind faith, instead of your required analysis. To day, he admits as an open question " that which yon are disposed to contemn and de ride, last month he denounced even .the temperate discussion of a theory nowise in ferior in interest, and of which the absurdity seemed to yon by no means self-evident. Is it that we are nnconBcionsly biassed by our secret predilections, that the wish is too often father to the thought, that we need some lurking goodwill to the question before we can prevail on ourselves even to give it a fair trial and to take the evidence pro and con.' Certain it is that even the wisest and calmest of our philosophic friends present sometimes the semblance of despotism and caprice, both in their precipitate rejections and in their candid investigations. Johnson derided and denounced the poems of Ossian, yet entered upon the question of Highland second eight with judicial gravity and benignant candour. He concludes his words of truthful seventy with—"I could never advance my curiosity to conviction, bat came sway at length only willing to believe." ... . 1 fear if he bad not been " willing to be lieve" be wonla have been less tolerant of the question, and less jnBt in his treatment of it, and in bis verdict.

We daily read of crimes and offences, and I write amidst criminal trials. Want, horrid want, and no less borr d intemperance,are man's foeB. Let those who have never known temptation practise charity in the heart as in the hand. For wise is he who, by thrift, erects every month an additional bulwark against these invaders. Want and embarrassment, aid.d by intern perance too often, smooth the path of the Temptbe and of the Bkibbr. Let, then, every atartliug delinquency, or lapse from integrity, quicken in the reader habits of industry and thrift, bo, in the hour of temptation, may his loins be girded. As my life cannot be certain for another year, thia day is the most becoming to Balute my kind, indulgent friends whose praises have stimulated me. I prefer wear to rust, therefore will strive on yet, for noiseless as easy falls the step of the pilgrim whose moun tain-path of duty is a labour of love.
