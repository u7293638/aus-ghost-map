WILL OF NAPOLEON III. (From L'Ordre.) IN the latter part of December, 1872, the Emperor, feeling an aggravation of the symptoms of the disease which was so soon to prove fatal, and indulging no illusory hopes of the ultimate success of the operation which his physic mine had declared to be indispensable, was anxious, before resigning himself to their care, to express in writing his last will and testament The will of the Emperor Napoleon III is drawn up in two very distinct parts. The statesman, the Sovereign, the dynastic chief, speaks- in one, in the other, the private gentleman, the father, the friend. Motives of propriety, which it is useless to dwell upon, will not allow of our publishing at least, at present the will of the private gentleman The legacies and bequests with which the dispossessed Emperor has thought proper to reward certain devoted friends, certain faithful servants, either in the shape of rewards or as souvenirs, would only interest the public in a point of view of morbid curiosity which it would scarcely be proper to gratify at the present moment But the political will is a different thing altogether Tins, from the hour of its author's death, belongs to history. It forms part of the immediate inheritance of the present generation, for whose instruction it was written It will be noticed that this will is built up of a series of notes, thoughts, reflections, provisions, remembrances, written in meditative mood, during the tedious hours of exile. At the very moment when the Emperor saw rising before him the probability of an impending catastrophe, he rested satisfied with the compilation of these notes, to which he was hardly aware that he was giving the last touch. This is the document we speak of, and which we print without reflecting or commenting on - " In the name of the Very Holy Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Made aware by unheard of misfortune of the uncertainty of worldly concern at an age when it may please Divine Providence, after so many cruel trials, to withdraw me from this life before I have been able personally) to fulfil the mission which I had dreamt of accomplish mg, I owe it to the honor of my name, to my responsibility before history, to the future of my race, to bequeath to my son, with my paternal embrace and my ardent aspirations, such instructions as may guide his conduct, in the hope that Heaven, soothed by the overwhelming catastrophes which have fallen on that beloved French nation, will abet him in his on powers to remove his country with its past glory, prosperity, and grandeur, ' Weighed down by the most unwonted and most infamous accusations, I have hitherto left to history, over impartial and ever true, the care of my justification "During the twenty tears that I was called upon by the national will to manage the affairs of France I have reigned independently of any care with regard to dynastic interests 01 por Bonol satisfaction I feel the legitimate pride of being able to declare that I have brought that country to the highest dogs co of prosperity, in fluency, and Co at that it will have been given to any hierarchy of the past to enjoy While maintaining order in the interior, and opposing an iron hand to the baneful covetousness of the disinherited CIBSBCS, I have brought all my efforts to boat on the mond, political, and social emancipation of the laborer Under no other regime has the workman been in a more prosperous condition Never have the relations be tween capital and labor been carried on in a more peaceful and satisfactory way "Notwithstanding the renown of military glory which attaches to the founder of my room, I had dreamed, I find desired to exclusion) devote my reign to those efforts of democratic and social emancipation, and when, at the opening of my career as a son foreign, I s 6d at Bordeaux that the Empire was peace,' I expressed the most sincere conviction that was 61 of conveyed to Europe and to the world "But next to the aspirations of my heart with the duties of the monarch and when I was induced to draw the sword it was never for protect the" interests of the honor of France in tlioOrunea, in Italy, in China, in Ooohiiiehiiia, in Asia Minor, the triumphs of n) g illunt many years excited the grandeur of the country " At the time of life when I am pointing those lines in the expectation of soon appeal nig bosom of God, who will judge me I refuse to set myself up as a judge for others I leave to my son, with the recommendation of ultimately making such use of them us the honor of my name and his own may require, the complete en tons of documents which will show that in respect to the Mexican expedition, interrupted by un portions motives of international light, and also to that last and fatal war against Prussia, I once more had solely in view the honor and interests of the country who for the third time in the space of twenty years had by a signal rote 011 tasted its destinies to my keeping "History will explain bown series of fatal and unforeseen liusfoituneB, inevitable casualties improvident advises, disappointed prow sions improbable results, ended in the future of the most generous offer ever attempted to win in the pioiogutivoB and predominance of France "An unmentionable came lins complimented the catastrophe, and while at Siidim Ijoopti disod my personal enmity to secure that of my army, and to co reside in neceSSary peace, in Paris hiainloBB demagogues were working the men of 1> made by affording to the conquering sound) the spectacle of a revolution against their legitimate Sovereign ' A day, which is not far distant will dawn when France will know the truth on all the facts and many other topics which have been distorted by calling) and the imminent political parties, and on Unit day France, after under going so many) trials, will recall to mind the twenty years of glory, happiness, and prosperity which she owed to the reign of Napoleon M to instincts of the people are monal usual, and no monarchy o m reinstate a radio in a safe position I had the conqueror of Aitstoi life "If Providence deems my mission accomplished, and bequeath to my son the task of carrying out this work of reparation, under the guidance of his excellent mother, my worthy and beloved! wife, and that of the dot voted friends who have remained faithful to me, I advise him to revert to tlio|iriiiei))lcs which inspired my nets at the beginning of my reign, in , order within, peace ubi oad. " Bartrop has been too gi early agitated by the recent wars of the latter years and France may regain her prestige and her grandeur without appealing to force The reign of my son must not be one of reprisals, but one of reparation Peace within and without.

" The experiment of the last events has shown that nations are seldom grateful France, who had done everything for the enfranchisement of other countries, found herself deserted at a time of supreme necessity). International alliances should be founded on the interests, on the hopes, and not on rights and memories of the past, in a powerful, well appointed in my, store diplomacy will find a sovereign help to its notion. My son's endeavors should all tend towards ensuring the soldiers' comfort With a monarchy firmly grounded on a mighty army France, without buying recourse to arms, may repair the directors of war. The calamities consequent on successive insurrections during the last two years have not been able to shake the foundations of the financial prosperity laid by the Empire The Empire will render that prosperity as flourishing as heretofore " But to attain this result, at the fame time that it is necessary to proudly display before foreign nations the flag of France over to spected, notwithstanding our unmounted diane tors it is incumbent on the nation to insist, without weekness, without concession, without compromise, that at home the principle of authority which the nation will once more Elliston to consecrate shall be respected "
