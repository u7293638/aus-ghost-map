A DOCTOR'S STORY. (FROM the Speaker.) Once in the course of a medical career of nearly fifty years I saved o patients life other cases I have my doubts, but in the one I in certain of it You II take another cigarette i What no' Then black coffee I The patient was o lad) young and not unpleasing Hart gave me an interest in the case She lived at Surbiton I had never seen her before I was called in for this particular illness, but one day her husband came to my house in Harley street an wanted me to go down post haste with her: to look at her. He was particularly anxious to get a first rate London specialists opinion 1 he) d had a general practitioner down in their own place, he said but that was enough for him he distrusted G P S H insisted upon getting the very best advice to her A tall dark man the husband with keen deep sunken eyes He looked of Spain iron and might have been Grand Inquisitor in what struck me most about him was the queer little fact that though he expressed the greatest anxiety and desired to show the deepest affection I could t help feeling it was my opinion he wanted is more than an) assistance He laid great stress upon the point of my being an undoubted authority Whatever I thought of the case he would know it was right He didn't care about the diagnosis of these suburban doctors he didn't trust their prog nosiB but as I told him his wife would he he could be sure she would recover and if I told him well the worst-wh) he knew he must accept it with resignation (Cambric pocket hand kerchief ) I went down with him and saw her She was very ill indeed A most pathetic young woman She roused my keenest sympathy) But it was the queerest case I ever knew in my life I could make nothing of it I take the husband she was seriously ill I doubted her recovery she had sunk so low but '. didn't understand it His eyes find' an inscrutable gleam in them when I told him that but he answered very anxious!), that) you put a name to it it would be satisfactory at least to know what it is that the matter with her No leant I replied "In the whole course of my experience I never yet saw any thing life it His face tell a little Long medical prac- list has made me observe the quick shades of emotion that pass over faces I was in hopes you would have understood it is said very slow!) with a hard look into my) eyes pointing each word with emphasis It was for that I went to the best London authority I thought these ordinary suburban men might fail to make it out, but that I was sure of an opinion from a tree in London specialist They told me your forM was diagnosis Clever of him I felt at the time to try thus to work upon my) professional pride and my professional susceptibilities he fancied he could force me or cajole me into giving it a name that was denicull sharp of rain but it on either the man) If you come a first clue to the real nature other illness next day and next again, I went down to see a) patient Money was no object the affectionate husband said often All he wanted was to be sure his dear wife had the built of the very best medical advice and assistance The third day I was so pulled I took my assistant down with me without telling him why I sent him in to see her When he come out I sold to him, 'Well, Harvey what do you make of it I don t make anything of it he answered " 1 can t It looks to me unique I don t in the least understand it Neither do I I replied, stroking my chin Hints why I brought you to see it We sat and stared at one another in silence for a minute Then my assistant said, very dubious) The fact is Sir Everard, it appears to me Well go on man I Out with it I " " Not a sense of natural disease at all, but a case of poisoning Precisely) my opinion, I answered, giving a start. I brought on here to confirm it I went into the sick woman. room again I want to ask you one question, I said in as soothing o voice as possible " you may think it on odd one Is there anybody who would benefit in any way by your death She She gazed up at me feebly Note soul she answered All I have in the world I've left by will to dear Archie Hmt settled the question I felt sure I knew a prescription that would cure her I went down again to the diningroom The husband was there sitting uneasily by the window He looked at me with an anxious face Well I v e formed an opinion on the case at last I see 1 and so has Dr Harvey here but perhaps it ran distress you or annoy you to hear it He glanced nervously at my assistant then at me in return I had placed myself on purpose so that both our eyes were upon him from every angle He shuffled in his chair Oh I m prepan d for the worst he answered with sick 1) birdie "I know she can t recover Then do you desire me to give you the honest opinion I vi formed, I asked, at the risk of off ending you Yes I want your opinion, he answered but his lips quivered faintly "Its that that I called you in for I stared straight into his eyes I fixed him with raine He could t avoid them without cntcliinL, Harvey) s Hien my opinion is this I said slowly and distinctly that if your wife dies-yon li be hange 1 for it. He never moved a muscle of his face but his colour unit with a rush-he was white ob 0 ghost in a moment. He rose with an effort This is a maniac peasants le he cried at such a time as this A magnetic pleasanter I (He was more than half French and his native language came natural to him at these critical alone nts ) Ã­\nllauanleric atoll I answered very green; but a simple statement of a) medical opinion I Look here Mr So and so we are two you are one Ivovv I give you fair warning lins lad) upstairs is being), slowly) poisoned Unless she recovers he will hold 100 answerable You wanted the best advice Well now have not it Don't suppose you can deceive me by using a little known poison I won't let you murder her Your wife must recover I have my eye upon you If any) thing ever happens to her now or hereafter I shall take good care there is full inquiry) and so will Dr Harvey I say no more than that Audi wish you a very good morning, to morrow when I come I shall expect to be a marked improvement And so I did She was decidedly better In three weeks all was well in a month she was at Harrogate I never undeceived her She loved the creature and I allowed her to go on loving him but but I confess I was relieved when four years later he providentially broke his wretched neck on theSclucck horn It unburdened my mind of the responsibility of watching him In other cases I have my doubts But in that one I'm confident I really saved my patients life, and I should think you agree with me
