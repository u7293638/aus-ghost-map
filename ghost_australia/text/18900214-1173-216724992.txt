in Ocean Tragedy. Br W. CLARK RUSSELL. CHAPTER XI.—continued. THE PORTUGUESE BRIG. I NEVER beheld two more hideous men. Their skins were begrimed with dirt, and their colour came near to the complexion of the negro with sun and weather and neglect of soap; the hair of the seaman that wore the dirty red nightcap fell in snake - like coils upon Ins back and shoulders, black as tar and shining as grease. He wore thick gold hoops in his eats and a faded blue sash round his waist; his feet were naked, and for the like of them it would be necessary to hunt the forests of Brazil. The other man wore a slouched felt hat, a pair of grey trousers jammed into half-Wellington boots, a jacket confined by a button at the neck, the sleeves thrown over Ids back, whilst his dark arms, naked to the elbows, were hairy as a baboon's, with a glimpse to be caught of a most intricate network of gunpowder and Indian ink devices covering the flesh to the very finger-nails. This creature had a very heavy moustache, backed by a pair of fierce whiskers, with flashing, though blood-shot eyes, like a blot of idk'npon a dice of orange-peel. We were in a group at the gangway when they came sputtering alongside, flinging down their oars and walloping about in the wildest conceivable scramble as they made fast the painter and clawed their way up; and the instant they were on our deck they both let fly-at us in a torrent of words, not attempting to distinguish amongst as, but both of them addressing firatxuxe and then another, all with" such mad"' impetuosity of speech,' such smiting of their bosoms, such snapping of iSheir fingers and convulsive brandishing of their fists, that the irrecog nisable tongue in which they, delivered themselves was rendered the most hopelessly confounding language that ever bewildered the ear. It was quite impos sible to gather what they desired to state. First they woiild .point to our ensign, then to their brig, then; to the long gun - upon our. forecastle, meanwhile talking.: with indescribable rapidity. Finn* tried, to check them ; he bawled, "Stop! stop! Tou no speakee English ? " but they only stared and let drive again the moment he ended his question^ . "There's no good in all this," said Wilfrid, "we must find "out what they want. What the deuce is their language, Charles, d'ye know 1" "A sort of Portuguese, I imagine," said I, " but a mighty corrupt specimen of that tongue, I should think." " I will try them in French," said he, and approaching the fellow in the red nigtcap he bawled in French, with an excellent accent, "What is wrong with your ship ? What can we do for you ? " Both men shook their heads and broke out together afresh. It was amazing that they should go on jabbering as though we perfectly understood them when one glance at our faces should have assured them that they might as well have addressed the deck on which they stood. " Try 'cm in Latin, Wilf," cried I. He addressed a few words to them in that tongue, but his. English accent extinguished the hint or two they might have found in the words he employed had he pronounced them in South European fashion, and after glaring at him a moment with a deaf face the red-capped man stormed forth again into a passion of speech accompanied by themost incredible gesticulations^ pointing to His brig, to our flag, to the cannon as lief ore; winding up in the delirium of his emotion by flinging his cap down on deck and tearing a handful of hair out of his head. . Our crew were all on deck and had come; shouldering one another aft as far as they durst, where they stood looking on, a grinning, harkening, bewhiskered huddle,, of faces. -I'thought it just possible that one of them might understand the lingo of our grimy and astonishing visitors; and suggested as much to Captain Finn. . He called out, "Do any of you men follow; what these chaps are. a-Baying?" ' A fellow responded, "it's Portugoe, sir. lean swear to that, though -t-can't talk in it." "Try them in Italian, Laura," said Wilfrid. She coloured, and in a veiy pretty accent that floated to the ear like the soft sotfnds of a flute after .the hoarse, hideous and howling gibberish of the two Dagfos, as 1 judged them, she asked if they were Portuguese. The eyes of the fellow in the slouched hat flashed to a great grin that disclosed a very cavern of a mouth under his moustache widening to his whiskers, and he nodded violently. She asked again in Italian what they required, but this fell dead. They did not understand her, but possibly imagining that she could comprehend them they both addressed her at once, raising a most instating clattering with their tongues. "It looks to me," said Finn, "as if it was a case o' mutiny. Don't see what else can sinnify their constant pointing to that there gun and our flag and then their brig." I sent a look at the vessel as he spoke, and took notice now of a number of heads along the line of the main deck rail, watching us in a sort of ducking way, by which I mean to convey a kind of coming and going of those dusky knobs which suggested a very furtive and askant lookout. She was not above a quarter of a mile off; the wheel showed plain and the man at it kept his face upon ua continuously, whilst his posture, Liliputianised as he was, betrayed extraordinary impatience and anxiety. The craft lay aback, the light wind hollowing her sails in-board and her ugly besmeared hull rolling in a manner that I suppose was rendered nauseous to the eye by her colour, her form, her frowsy, ill-cut canvas and her sheathing of sickly hue, foul with slimy weed and squalid attire of repulsive seagrowth upon the long and tender lifting and falling of the sparkling blue. There were some white letters under her counter, but though I took a swift peep at them through Finn's telescope the shadow there and the long slant of the name towards the sternpoBt rendered the words indecipherable. The glass showed such heads along the rail as 1 could fix to be strictly in keeping with the filth and neglect you saw in the brig and with the appearance of the two men aboard of the schooner. Most of them might have passed for negroes. There were indications of extreme agitation amongst them, visible in a sort of fretful flitting, a constant looking up and around and abaft in the direction of the man at the wheel. I thought I would try my hand with the red-capped worthy, and striding tip to him I sung out " Capitano ?" He nodded, striking himself and then pointing to his companion, spoke some word, but I did not understand him. By this time the crew had come shoving one another a little further aft, so that we now made a fair crowd all about the gangway every man's attention was fixed upon the two Portuguese. It was: so odd an experience that it created a sort of licence for the crew, and Finn was satisfied to look on whilst first one and then another of our men addressed the two fellows, striving to coax some meaning out of them by addressing them in "pigeon" and other forms of English, according to that odd superstition current amongst seamen that our language is most intelligible to foreigners when spoken in a manner the least intelligible to ourselves. We of the quarterdeck were -beginning to grow weary of all this. The hopg-of being able to pick- up news -of the 'Shark had gone out df Wilfrid's mind long ago. the humour, moreover, of the two creatures', appearance and apparel was now stale to him, and with folded arms he stood apart watching their gesticulations and listening to their jargon—in which it seemed to me they were telling the same story over and over and over again—with a tired air anjjl a gloomy brow. I drew Finn apart. " What is the matter with them, think you ? " " I dorn'i doubt it's a mutiny, sir." "It looks like it certainly. But how can we help them ? " "We can't help them, sir. The best thing we can do, I think, is to order 'em off. You can see, Mr. Monson, his honour's growing sick of the noise." 1 started suddenly. "Why, Finn, look!" I cried, "see they have trimmed sail on the brig and she is under way !" It was indeed as I had said. Unob served by us, the-people of the vessel had squared the mainyards and flattened in the headsheets, and there she was away to windward,-pushing-slowly through it with a brassy wrinkling,Of water at her stem, her crew running about her as active as ants, whilst I noticed in the difference of costume that a new man had replaced the fellow who was at the wheel. "Mind," I shouted, "or by Jupiter they'll run away with the ship and leave this brace of beauties on our hands." A single glance enabled Finn to see how it was. In a breath he sprang upon the red-capped man, caught him by the collar, twisted his head round in the direction of the brig, whilst he yelled in his ear, "Lookee"! lookee ! your ship go ! your ship go; jumpee, jumpee or you loosee ship 3" It was not likely that the grimy creature would have met with a ghost of a hint of the truth in the •'lookees"and "jumpees" of friend Finn, but his nose having been slewed in the right direction lie instantly saw for himself. He broke Out in a long ringing howl, which I took to be some tremendous seacurse in "the" Portuguese language, and calling his companion's attention 'to the brig by striking him with his clenched fist between the sho'uldefs, and then indicating the vessel with both arms outstretched in a melodramatic posture that made one think of Masaniello, he uttered another wild ' roar tha^ Was no doubt a further example of Portuguese-bad language, and went in a Sprawgto the^gangway followed by his comrade. - In a trice they were T>ver the «id« and in the boat and pulling furiously inihp.4irection of_the brig.. , " Better trim SailCaptain Finn, so as to lie up for tfiat vessel/' exclaimed Wil- frid. J"' We must see those men aboard arid the littte^drama -played out, though 'tjsjeexatiously delaying." ' It'was now,blowing a very light air of wind, yet tljere was weight enough in it to hold steady the canvas of the Portuguese brig, even to tie lifting of her foresail, lumpish as those cloths were made by the boom that spread the clews, and one saw by the wake of her that she was starring through it at a pace to render the pursuit of the boat long andpossiblyhopeless, if the ere wref used toback their yards for the two fellows. The boat was a fat, tub-like fabric, apparently heavy for her size, and the rowers pulled with such alternate heat and passion, that though they made the water buzz and foam about the bows, their motion was as erratic—first to right, then to left, then a spasmodic heave round as though they meant to return to us—as the course of a fly climbing a pane of glass. The whole picture was thrown out strong and clear by the background of sparkling azure water melting into a soit of trembling faintn ess off the horizon to above the height of the brig's masts against the sky, which from there ran up in a tint of deepening blue till it whitened out into glory round about the sun. The boat rose and fell upon the long ocean heave, splashed Tvildly forwards by the two rowers, who again and again would turn their mahogany-coloured faces over their shoulders to yell to the withdrawing vessel. The brig's crew stood in a crowd aft watching, most of them, as the glass dis- 1 closed, in a loafing, lounging posture, their bare arms folded or their hands sunk in their breeches-pockets, whilst one another occasionally pointed at us or the boat with a theatrical attitude of leaning back as he did so that made one fancy one could hear the laughter- or the curses which attended these gestures. On high rustily glittered the amazing old weathercock or dog-vane of the saint in his boat, from which would leap with pendulum regularity a dull flame sunwards, timing a like kind of fire which flashed wet from the dirty yellow and Bickly green of the hull, as her side rolled streaming to the noon- tide blaze. "I say, Wilfrid,"cried I, "it doesn't seem as if those chaps meant to let that boat approach them" " What's to be done?" he exclaimed. I looked at Finn. "If they don't pick those two fellows np," said I, "we shall have to do so, that's cocksure. But they are a kind of beauties whose room is better than their company, I think, as the crew would find out when we approached the equinoctial Waters." "Ay, sir, cried Finn, " it would never do to have the likes o' them aboard, your honour," addressing Sir Wilfrid. " No, no, the brig must pick 'em up. Dang their cruel hearts! I never seed a scurvier trick played at sea in all my days." " But what's-to be done!" cried Wilfrid impatiently and irritably. "Could one of our boats overhaul the brig and put the two fellows aboard her 1" Finn shook his head. " See here, Wilf," said I, " suppose we let slip a blank shot at her out of that eighteen-pounder yonder? The dirty herd of scowbankers may take us to be a man of war. And another idea on top of this!" cried I, bursting into a laugh. " Is there anything black aboard that we can fly at the masthead ? It should prove a warrant of our honesty that must puzzle them gloriously." " Would a black shawl do, Mr. Monson ?" said Miss Jennings. "The very thing," said I, "if it's big enough." She immediately went below. "I think a blank shot's a first class idea," exclaimed Finn, " but as to a black flag—" and he cocked his eye dubiously at the masthead, whilst his face visibly lengthened. "Why a black flag, Charles?" cried Wilfrid. "Why, my dear Wilf,—the pirate's bunting, you know. The rogues may take us for a picaroon—no telling the persuasive influence of a black banner upon the nerves of such gentry." "Noble! noble?" shouted Wilfrid, slapping his leg: " frighten them, Finn, frighten them. Why, man, they can't be ail fools, and some of them at least will very well know that that ensign up there," pointing to the commercial flag at our peak, "is not her Britannic Majesty's red cross. But a black flag—Oh, yes, by all means if we can but muster such a thing. And get that gun loaded, will ye, Finn? get it done at once, I say.-" ' -i The skipper walked hurriedly forward aa Miss Laura arrived with a black cashmere or crape shawl—I do not recollect the material. We held it open between us. "The very thing," I cried, and full of excitement—for here was something genuine in the way of an incident to break in upon the monotony of a sea trip —I bent the shawl on to the signal halliards that led from the main-topmast head and sent it aloft in a little ball, ready to break when the gun should be fired. Meanwhile all "was bustle forwards. It is a question whether Jack does not love firing off a cannon even better than beating a drum. Miss Jennings walked right aft as far as she could go, holding her fingers in readiness for her ears and saying to me as she passed that sudden noises frightened her. Wilfrid stood alongside of me, glancing with a boyish expression of excitement and expectation from the seamen congregated round the gun to the little black ball at the masthead. * The yacht was slowly overhauling the brig, but almost imperceptibly. The boat maintained an equidistance betwixt us and was struggling, wabbling and splashing fair in a line with our cutwater and the lee-quarter of the Portuguese craft. The two rowers exhibited no signs of exhaustion, though I expected every minute to find one or both of them give up and disappear, dead beaten, in the bottom of their tub. "All ready forward, sir, "shouted Finn; will your honour give us the signal when to fire?" As he sung out the group of seamen hustled backwards from the gun and thinned into meagre lines of spectators at a safe distance. " Fire!" bawled Wilfrid. There was a glance of flame past the bow port, a roar that tingled through the decks into one's very marrow, and the sea turned blind with white smoke, iridescent as a cobweb, over the bows of the Bride. I tugged at the signal halliards, broke my little ball, and the black shawl floated out fair from the masthead, as sinister a piratic symbol as one could have desired and not an atom the less malignant in significance for wanting the old-fashioned embellishments of the cross-bones and skull. I saw the Jacks forward looking up at the sight with grinning wonderment. However, it was eiasy to see by their way of laughing, staring and turning to one another, that they' twigged 'the motive .-of that wild marine exhibition. I sprang to the peak-, signal halliards and hauled the ensign down for the black flag combined but ill with the Union Jack, and then went to-the side to see what the brig was about. ISither she did not understand our meaning, or was resolved not to take any hint from us. She held on doggedly without a touch of the braces or a shift of the helm by the length of a spoke, with her people watching us and the pursuing boat from over the taflrail, a cluster of sulphur-coloured faces, as they looked at that distance, but harmonising excellently well, I thought, with the dingy yellow of the canvas rising in ungainly spaces over their heads and the sickly hue of the brig's hull with its shiny, pease-soup-like reflection in the water to the lift of the squalid fabric upon some polished brow of swell. "Wilfrid,"cried I, "they don't mean to pick up their boat." "It looks like it," said he, "what's to be done 1 There's something con- foundedly insulting in the rogues' indifference to our gun and colours." " Better consult with Finn," said I. He called to the skipper, who came to us from the forecastle. " I say, Finn, what are we to do ? We don't want those two filthy fellows aboard this yacht; and yet, if that brig don't pick them up, we can't of course let them remain adrift here." Arm a boat's crew," said I ; "you have weapons enough below. Take those two fellows out of yonder boat and compel the brig to receive them. I'll take charge with pleasure if Finn '11 permit." Finn, a slow, sober, steady old merchant seaman, did not seem to see this. The expression of woiiy made hie long face comical with the puzzled twist at the corners of his mouth, which looked to be, in his countenance, where most men's noses are situated. " Or," said I, observing him to hang in the wind, * 4 make them redly believe that those are the colours we sail under," pointing to the shawl, "by slapping round-shot at them in sober earnest, leaving the missle to take its chance of missing or hitting. "That's it," almost shrieked Wilfrid in his excitement; " yes ! that'll saw the botheration of boat-lowering and arguefL cation and perhaps blood-shed, by George 1 Run forward now, Finn, and let fly a round-shot at that ugly brute; hit her if you can, no matter where, that they may know we're in earnest, and that they may believe if they don't heave to we shall sink them. No remonstrance, Finn, for heaven's sake! Jump, my dear fellow. Dash it, man," he cried, passionately, with a quite furious gesture in the direction of the brig, " that's not the object of our chase!" Finn, with an air of concern but awed also by Wilfrid's temper and insisteilce, hurried on to the forecastle. I watched them load the gun a second time, and burst into a laugh when I saw two fellowB rise out of the fore hatch, each of them hugging an eighteen-pound shot to his heart. "Only one ball at a time," shouted Wilfrid, conceiving very likely that they meant to double shot the gun. "Ay, ay, sir," responded Finn. The crew backed away as before. The stout, whiskered seamen, with a face that made one think of a red apple snugged in a setting of horse-hair, who had previously fired the gun and who was apparently the Bride's gunner, sighted the piece with a deliberateness that made me^xpsct wonders. We all held our breath. I fixed my eye on the brig to observe, t' possible, where the shot struck her. Tien, crash! Had the cannon been loadbd to the muzzle the blast could not haw been more deafening. The thunder of i swept with thrill, out and away fiener than the tremble of the first shock, through the deck and was almost immerfately followed by a loud and fearful yell from the forecastle. I thought the gun had burst. " Merciful powers! What has happened ? " cried Wilfrid. Captain Finn came lowling aft fast as his legs would travel, shouting as he ran. " What is it ? what is it ? " my cousin and I roared out in one voice. The shot's struck the boat, your honours, and sunk her! " bellowed linn. I looked, and sure enough whe:e the boat had been there was nothing to be seen but the violet slope of the swel"softly drawing out of the cloud of powdersmoke that was settling in lengthening, listening folds towards the brig! I thcught I observed something dark howevir, and snatching up Finn's telescope fr<m the skylight-top I levelled it and male out the head of the man with the red nightcap holding by an oar or bit of wr«ckage. I shouted out that one of the man was alive in the water. The dismay was universal, bub there "was "no diserder,: no* commotion. By waiting a little lie Bride, even as she was heading, woild have floated to the spot where that mdancholy red beacon was bobbing; but lie delay this would have involved was rot to be dreamt of. With a smartness thit excited my admiration, man-of-wars-manas I had been in my time, our largest boit, a six-1 oared fabric, -with sour old Crimj in the stern-sheets, was lowered and pulled away with splendid precision in the direction of the red nightcap. In a few minutes they had got the fellow in- boards; they then hung upon their oars, looking round and round; but the other unfortunate creature, he of the slouched hat and black and flashing eyes, had found a sailor's grave. I sought with the glass over a bread field of water, but could see nothing. Indeed there was not a vestige left of tie boat save what the red-capped chaphaddungto. "One of them lolled! Heavm have mercy upon us," groaned Wilfrid in my ear, and his appearance was full of creadful consternation. Meanwhile the brig ahead was holding steadfastly on, her crowd of people aft gazing at us as before. I took a new of them; they all held a sort, of gaping posture; there were no dramatic gesticulations, no eager and derisive turning to one another, no pointing arms and backwardleaning attitudes. They had as thunderstruck an air as can be imagined ina mob of men. What they supposed us to i>e now after our extermination of the bojfc and one of the two fellows who had souglt our assistance, it was impossible to conjecture. Our boat, that had sped away fron us about four times faster- than we were moving through the water, hung, with lifted oars, over the spot where our camonball had taken effect until the Bride had slowly surged to within hail; then up stood sour Crimp. "What are we to do?" Have you got both men?"_ba\4ed Finn, who perfectly well knew that tley hadn't. No; there was but one to get, tnd here he is," and Crimp pointed into the bottom of the boat. "Put him aboard his ship," cried Hnn. "If they refuse to receive him, find out if there's e'er a one of 'em that can speak English, and then tell them that if they don't take him we shall arm our men and compel 'em to it} and if that don't do we'll keep all on firing into 'em till they follow the road that's been took by their jolly-boat." • — •" His long face was purple with temper and the effort of shouting, and he turned it upon Wilfrid, jrho nodded a fierce excited approval, whilst I cried; '} That's it, that's it; they must take him." Crimp held up his hand in token of having heard the captain, then seated himself; the oars fell and flashed as they rose wet to the sua, every gold- bright blade in a line, and the foam went spinning away from the bows of the little craft in snow to the magnificent disciplined sweep of those British muscles. In a jifly she was on the brig's quarter, with Crimp erect in her, gesticulating to the crowd, who overhung the raiL I kept the telescope bearing on them and it seemed to me that the whole huddle of them jabbered to Crimp all together, an indistinguishable hubbub, to judge from the extraordinary 1 contortions into which every individual figure flung itself, some of them going td the lengths of spinning round in their frenzy, whilst others leapt upon the rail and addressed the boat's crew with up; lifted arms, as though they called all sorts of maledictions down upon our men. This went on for a few minutes, then 1 saw the bow-oar fork out his boat-hook and drag the boat to C o main channels, into which, all very expeditiously, two or three brawny pairs of arms lifted the red' capped man. Then four of our fellows spiting into the chains, handed the little creature over the rail and let him drop inboards. They then re-entered their boat and fell astern of the brig by a few fathoms, holding their station there by a soft plying of oars, Crimp's notion probably being, as ours was indeed, that the Portuguese crew would presently send our friend the redcap to follow his mate. We waited, watching intently. On a sudden I spied the red-cap in the heart of the mob of men that had clustered again near the wheeL His gesticulations were full of remonstrance; his people writhed round about him in the throes of a Portuguese argument, but it seemed to me as I followed their gestures and their way of turning their faces towards us, that their talk was all about our schooner, as though indeed their mutinous passions had been diverted by our cannon-shot in a direction that boded no particular evil to the redcapped man. " They'll not hurt the creature, I be lieve," said I. "Call the men aboard, Finn," exclaimed Wilfrid, ' 'and get the Bride to her course." CHAPTER Xn. A SECOND WABNING. I HAULED down the shawl from the masthead, carefully unbent, folded, and gave it to Miss Jennings, who stood with Wilfrid watching the Portuguese brig. We had hoisted in our boat, and the men were busy about the decks coiling up after having trimmed sail. " Once more heading a fair course for the Shark," said I with a glance at the compass. "This has been a neat morning's work. A few incidents of the kind should make out a lively voyage." " Oh, but it's dreadful to think of that poor man having been drowned! claimed Miss Jennings. " I was watching the boat before the gun was fired. In an instant she vanished. She might have been a phantom. She melted out upon the water as a snowflake would. I pressed my eyes, for I could not believe them at first." "Horrible!" exclaimed Wilfrid in hollow melancholy voice ; " what had that miserable creature done that we should take his life? Have we insensibly—insensibly—courted some curse of heaven upon this yacht? Who was the villain that did it?" He wheeled round pas sionately : "Finn—Captain Finn, I sayl" he shouted. The captain, who was giving directions to some men in the waist, came aft. "Who was it that fired that shot, Finn ? " cried my cousin in his headlong way, jerking his head as it were at Finn with the question, whilst his arms and legs twitched and twisted as though to an electric current. A man named O'Connor, Sir Wil frid," responded Finn. " Did he do it expressly, think you ? " "I wouldn't like to say that, your honour. The fellow's a blunderhead. I inquired if there was e'er a man for'ard as could load and sight a cannon, and this chap stands up and says that he'd sarved for three years in a privateer and was reckoned the deadest shot out of a crew of ninety men." "Call him aft, said Wilfrid. "If he aimed at that boat intentionally it's murder—call him aft." He took some impatient strides to and fro with a face that worked like a Bhip" in a seaway with the conflict of emotions within him, whilst Finn, going a little way forward, sung out for O'Connor. Meanwhile we were rapidly widening the distance between us and the brig. I pro test it was with an honest feeling of relief that I watched her sliding into a toy-like shape with promise of nothing showing presently but some radiant film of her topmost canvas in the silver azure that sneaked by a hand's breadth, as it looked, tie whole girdle of the horizon ; for one iras never to know but that her people night send the red-capped man adrift for us to pick up or worry us in some other way. Finn arrived, followed by the Irishman who had discharged the gun; his immense black whiskers stood out thick, straight, inflexible ,as the bristles of a chimneysweep's brush, contrasting very extraordinarily with the bright apple-red of his cheeks and the blue, Hibernian, seawardly eye that glimmered under a dense black thatch of brow. He stood bolt upright, soldier-fashion, with his arms straight up and down by his side like pump-handles, and fixed an unwinking stare upon whoever addressed him. You fired that gun, Captain Finn says," exclaimed Wilfrid. "Oi did, your honour." "What made you take aim at the boat?" Your honour, by the holy eleven, I took aim at the brig. There's something wronsr with the pace." "Wrong with the piece! What d'ye mean? " "It was cast with a. kink, sorr; it dhroops amidships and .shoots as Misther Crimp's larboard oye peeps, your honour, though loike his oye it manes well." "Nonsense," I cried, "you must have covered the boat to hit it." By all that's sacred then," cried the man, " I had the natest observation of the brig's maintopmasht as ever oye could bring the muzzle of a pace to soigLt. The gun was cast with a kink,' sorr." "My belief is that you're utterly ignorant of guns," cried Wilfrid. "The concussion was fierce enough to shake the yacht to pieces." ."'Twasyour honour's design to froighten 'em." \- "But not to murder them, you dolt!" shouted Wilfrid. "D'ye know I could ha^e you hanged for this 1" 4 1 It was but a hay then Portuguay, sorr," answered the fellow, preserving lus ramrod-like posture and Ins unwinking -stare. : "Tell him to go forward, Finn; tell him to go forward," cried Wilfrid, "and see that he never has any more to do with that gun on any account whatever, d'ye understand ? " The seaman knuckled his forehead and wheeled round, but methought I could just catch a glimpse past his whisker of a sudden protrusion of the cheek as though he was signalling with his tongue to°a brother Jack who was flemish-coiling a rope not very far from where he was standing. .The luncheon bell rang and we went below. At table we could talk of nothing but the unhappy Portuguese whom our round-shot had sent to the bottom. Muffin's face of respectful horror was a feature of the time which I recall more vividly than even the disaster itself. This man, though he was in attendance on Wilfrid as a valet, regularly stood behind his master's chair at meals. It was Wilfrid's whim to have him at hand. He did not offer to wait unless it was to procure anything my cousin might require when the stewards were busy with Miss Jennings and myself, or one or both of them absent. His air of deferential consternation was exceedingly fine as he listened to our talk about the annihilated boat and the foundered foreigner. "Who," said I with a glance at his yellow viEage, the shocked expression of which he tried to smother by twisting his lips into a sort of shape that might pass as a faint obsequious simper and by keeping his eyelids lowered, "let us trust was cut in halves, for then his extinction would be painless; for, after all, drowning, though it is reckoned an agreeable death after consciousness has fled, is mortal agony, I take it, whilst the sensation of suffocation remains." Muffin's left leg fell away with an exceedingly nervous crooking of it in the trouser, and he turned up his eyes an instant to the upper deck with so sickly a roll that, spite of myself, I burst into; laugh, though I swiftly recovered myself. " It is strange, CharleB," exclaimed my cousin in a raven-like note, "that a ghastly incident of this kind should sit so lightly on your mind, considering that you have quitted the sea for years and have led a far more effeminate life ashore than I who have been roughing it on the ocean, when very likely you were lounging with a bored face in an opera stall or dozing over a cigar in some capacious club armchair. Had you been chasing slavers or pitching cannon shot into African villages down to the present moment, I could almost understand your indifference to a business that's going to haunt me for the rest of my days." "Nonsense !" I exclaimed, "it was bad job I admit, but a pure accident, not more tragical than had the boat capsized and drowned the man. There would be nothing in a twenty-fold uglier mishap to haunt you. But I'll tell you what, though," I continued, talking on to avert the sentimental argument which I saw strong in Wilfrid's face, " the incident of this morning points a very useful moral." " What moral ? " he demanded. "Why, that we must not be in too great a hurry to speak every sail we sight " " Finn knows my wishes ; we must hear all we can about tiieShari," cried Wilfrid warmly. "The very vessel that we neglect to speak," exclaimed Miss Jennings softly— she had spoken but little and it was easy to see through the transparency of her unaffected manner that the tragic affair of the morning had made a very deep impression on her—" might prove the one ship of all we pass that could most usefully direct us," '' Two to one!" said I, giving her a bow and smiling to the look of coy reproach in her charming eyes; "of course, Miss Jennings, I have no more to say. At least," I added, turning to Wilfrid, "on the head of speaking passing ships, though the moral I find in tins forenoon trouble is not exhausted." Well?" said he a little imperiously, leaning towards me on one elbow with his nails at his lips and the spirit of restlessness quick as the blood in his veins in every lineament. Well," said I, echoing him, "my suggestion is that your long Tom's murderous mission should be peremptorily cut short by your ordering Finn to strike the noisy old barker at once down into the hold, where he'll be a deuced deal more useful as ballast than as a forecastle toy for the illustration of Irish humour." "No!" shouted Wilfrid, fetchingthe table a whack with his fiBt: " so say no more about it, Charles. Strange that you, who should possess the subtlestand strongest of any kind of human sympathy for and with me—I mean the sympathy of blood— should so absolutely fail to appreciate my determination and to accept my purpose! That girl there," pointing with his long arm to Miss Laura, " can. read my heart and, of her sweetness, justify and approve all she finds there. But you, my dear Charles "—he softened his voice though he continued speaking with warmth nevertheless—" you, my own first cousin, you to whom my honour should be hardly less dear than your own—you would have me abandon this pursuit—forego every detail of my carefully prepared programme— blink with a cynical laziness at my own and my infant's degradation and turn to the law—to the law forsooth —for the appeasement or extinction of every just yearning and of every consuming desire of my manhood No by G !" he roared, " fate may be against me, but even her iron hand can be forced by a heart goaded as mine has been and is." He rose from the table and without another word went to his cabin. We had been for some time alope—I mean that Muffin and the stewards had left us. When my cousin was gone I looked at Miss Jennings. "Forgive me, Mr. Monson," she exclaimed with a little blush and speaking with an enchanting diffidence, "but I fear—indeed I am sure, that any, even the lightest, suggestion that runs counter to Wilfrid's wishes irritates him. And, she added almost in a whisper, " 1 think it is dangerous to irritate him." "I have no wish to irritate him, believe me, Miss Jennings," said I. "I desire to be of some practical help, and my recommendations have no other motive. But I give you my. word if this sort of thing goes on I shall grow selfish, nay, alarmed if you like. I certainly never anticipated these melodramatic displays, these tragic rebukes, when I accepted his offer of the voyage.. Pray consider: if Wilf, poor fellow, should grow worse, if his actions should result in exhibiting him as irresponsible, what's to be done? Heaven forbid that I should say a word to alarm you"—she shook her head with a smile: I was a little abashed but proceeded nevertheless—"we are not upon dry land here. The ocean is as full of the unexpected as it is of fish. Finn is a plain steady man with brains enough, but then he is not in command in the sense that a captain is in command when we speak of a ship whose skipper is lord paramount. He will obey as Wilfrid orders, and I say, Miss Jennings, with all submission to your engaging, to your beautiful desires as a sister, that if Wilfrid's humour is going to gain on him at the rate at which I seem to find it growing, it will be my business, as I am certain it will be my duty for everybody's sake as well as for yours and his own, so to contrive this unparalleled pursuit as to end it swiftly." She was silent—a little awed, I think, by my emphatic manner, perhaps by a certain note of sternness, for 1 had been irritated, besides being nervous; and then, again, my distaste for . the trip worked very strongly in me whilst I was talking to her. We were a somewhat gloomy ship for the rest of the day. I noticed that the seamen wore tolerably grave faces at their several jobs, and it was easy to gather that, now they had had time to digest the incident of the morning it was as little to their taste as it was to ours aft. Indeed was impossible to tell what kind of omen they might manufacture out of so tragic an affair. Sailors were very much more superstitious in those days than they are now; the steam fiend has wonderfully cleared the atmosphere of the forecastle, and the sea-goblin has long since made his final dive from the topgallant-rail to keep company with the mermaid in her secret bower of coral in a realm fathoms deep beneath the ocean ooze. O'Connor tried very hard to look as if he felt that on the whole he almost deserved to be hanged for his blundersome extermination of the Portugee heathen; at least this seemed his air when, as he sat stitching on a sail in the wsust, he suspected a quarterdeck gaze to be directed at him. But it is hard for a man with merry blue eyes and cheeks veritably grinning with ruddiness in the embrace of a huge hearty pair of carefully doctored whiskers to look contrite. The Irishman did his best, but I laughed to see how the instant he forgot his pjirt nature jovially broke out in him again. Crimp had charge that afternoon, and when I arrived on deck with a .cigar in my mouth, leaving Miss Jennings and her maid hanging together over a hat whose feather in some way or other had gone wrong, I asked the mate what was his opinion of the accident of the morning. "Ain't got any opinion about it at all, he answered. " It was an accident, let us believe, said I. "Pure hignorance more like," he answered. '' That there O'Connor's regularly ate up with pride. He's all bounce. Says he's descended from kings and if he had his rights he'd be at the head o* Ulster or some such place as that 'stead of an able seaman. He know anything 'bout firing off cannons!" making a horrible face and going to the side to spit "Did they understand what you said aboard the brig when you talked to them from the boat?" "Ne'er a word." " Was the red-capped man hurt! "Dazed. Eyes pretty nigh out on's cheeks. He was too full o' salt water to curse, I allow, so when we hauled him into the boat he fell on his knees and prayed. A bloomin' poor job; a measly mean business! Knocking of a boat to pieces an' drownding of a man. What's the good o' that there gun ? Only fit to kick up a plaguey shindy. Next time it may bust and then, stand by I for I once see an explosion." "Is there anything wrong with the piece as O'Connor suggests?" said I, much enjoying the old chap's sourness, which I may say was not a little in harmony with my mood that afternoon. " Couldn't tell if ye offered me all ye was worth. My business ain't guns. I shipped to do my bit, and my bit I'll do, but the line's chalked a mighty long way this side o* hordnance." I walked on to the forecastle to inspect the gun for myself. O'Connor watched me with the whole round of his face, "broad and purple as the rising moon. The gun was of an elderly fashion, but it looked a very substantial weapon, with a murderous grin in the gape of it, and a long dim throat thatwarranted a venomous delivery. The kink the Irishman spoke of was altogether in his eye. I returned to the quarterdeck, relighted my cigar, stowed myself comfortably away in the chair 1 had at an earlier hour procured for Miss Jennings, and pulling from my pocket a little handy edition of one of Walter Scott's novels, was speedily transported leagues away from the ocean by the spells of that delightful wizard. Thus passed the afternoon. Bliss Jennings re mained below, and Wilfrid lay hid in his cabin. It was very__.pleasant -weather. The sky was a clear blue from line to line,, with just a group of faint bronzed-browee 1 clouds of a dim cream at the horizon loom' ing in the azure air far away down in the north-west. The wind was cool though salt, a pleasant breeze from the east with a trifle of northing in it, and very steadily the yacht travelled quietly over the plain of twinkling waters, cradled by a soft western heaving. She made no stir forwards saving now and again a sound as of the pressure of a light foot upon tinderish brushwood ; every sail that would draw was packed on her, to her triangular lower studdingsail, the reflection of which waved in the tremulous blue like a sheet of quicksilver, fluctuating as it drained downwards. Still it -was dull work. I would often break away from Scott to send a glance at the skylight where 1 could just get a peep at the ruddy glow of Miss Laura's hair, as she sat at the table with her maid near her, and heartily wished she would join me. Crimp's company was like pickles, a very little of it went a long way. Hid etiquette permitted, I should have been glad to go amongst the men and yarn with them, for I could not doubt there was a store of amusing experiences lying behind some of the rugged hairy countenances scattered about the decks. Indeed, no summons ever greeted my ear more cheerfully than the first dinner bell; for whether one has an appetite or not, sitting down to a meal onboard ship is something to do. Nothing that need make a part of this story happened that night. Wilfrid was reserved, but his behaviour and the little he said were collected enough to make one wonder at the lengths he would occasionally go the other way. He brought a large diary from his cabin, and sat writing in it up to a Bhort while before going to bed. I cannot imagine what he had to put down, unless, indeed, he were posting up the book from some old date. It found him occupation, however, and he was a good deal in labour, too, throughout, I thought, often biting the feather of his pen, casting his eyes up, plunging his fingers into his hair and frowning upon the page, and comporting himself, in a word, as though he were composing an epic poem. 1 played at beggar-myneighbour with Miss Jennings, showed her some tricks at cards, and she told my fortune. She said she could read my future by looking at my hand, and I feel the clasp of her fingers still, and smell the perfume of her hair, and behold the brightness of it, and see her -poring upon my >alm, talking low that Wilfrid should not )e disturbed, tracing the lines with a rosy finger-nail, with an occasional lift of her eyes to mine, the violet of them dark as hazel, and brilliant in the oil flames—it might have happened an hour ago, so keen this particular memory. It was as peaceful an ocean night as any man could imagine of the weather up in the seas which our yacht was atill stemming ; moonless, for the planet roBe late now, but spacious and radiant with stars. There was the phantasm of a craft when I went on deck about a mile on the bow of us, in the spangled dusk looking like ice, so fine and delicate was the white of her canvas, but no notice was taken of her. Finn trudged over to the gloom to leeward when I rose up through the hatch, possibly mistaking me for my cousin, and manifestly anxious to shirk the job of having anything to do with the stranger. I watched her pass—a more wraith of a ship she looked, sliding her three stately spires that seemed to melt upon the eye as you watched them Under the red tremble and green and diamond-like sparkling of the luminaries which looked down upon her. By the time she had faded out like a little puff of steam in the dumb shadow astern, my pipe was smoked out, and I went below and to bed, scarce having exchanged three words with Finn, and musing much on my fortune that Miss Laura had read my hand—that my " line of life " was ery long, that in middle life I should meet with a woman who would fascinate me, but that, nevertheless, I should die as I had lived, a bachelor. Next morning Wilfrid did not appear fit the breakfast-table. Muffin informe4 me that his master had passed a very bad night, had not closed his eyes, indeed, and for hour after hour had:paced the cabin, sometimes going on deck. "Is he ill, do you think ? " 1 inquired. "Notexactly ill, sir," he answered in his sleekest manner, with the now familiar crook of one knee and lus arms' banging straight up and down. " What then f" I demanded, perceiving that the fellow had'more to say, though his very humble and obsequious respect'- fulness would not suffer him to express much a time. " I fear, sir," he exclaimed,' looking down, "that yesterday's 'orrid tragedy has preyed upon his nerves, which, as you are of course aweer, sir, is uncommonly delicate." I thought this probable, and, as the man was going to his master's cabin with a cup of tea from the breakfast table, I told him to give Sir Wilfrid my love and to say that I should be glad to look in and sit with him. He returned to tell me my cousin thanked me, but that he would be leaving his berth presently, and would then join me in a pipe on deck. There was a fresh breeze blowing, and the yacht was plunging through it in a snowstorm, rising buoyant to the bow surge with a broad dazzle of racing water over the leerail and a smother of white roaring in a cataract from under her counter. There was wind in the misty shining ofthe sun and ^n the spaces of dim blue between the driving clouds. The ocean was gay with tints, flying cloudshadows of slate, broad tracts of hurrying blue rich and gloriously fresh, with a ceaseless flashing of the heads of the dissolving billows, dashes of lustrous yellow to the touoh of the sun that, you would see, sweeping a rusty ball of copper through a mass of smoke-like vapoyr, and then leaping out, moist and rayless, into some speeding lagoon of clear heaven. The horizon throbbed to the walls of the dimness that circled the line all the way round, and my first glance was for a ship; but all was bare ocean. From time to time the fellow on the topgallantyaid ogled the slope over either bow in a way that made me imagine some sort of hope of the Shark heaving into view had come to the sailors out of this rushing morning. I waited for Miss Jennings, thinking she would arrive on deck; but, after stumping to and fro for a half-hour or thereabouts, and passing the skylight, I saw her and Wilfrid in close conversation standing '' almost directly beneath, he gesticulating with-great energy, but speaking in « sub-. dued voice, and she watching him^nith a troubled face. Passing the skylight again, a little later on, I caught sight of JVilfrid's figure marching up and down with irregular broken strides, whilst the girl, leaning with her hand upon the back of a chair, continued to gaze at him, with now and again a little movement of the arm which suggested that she -was endeavouring to reassure or to reason with him. - I .got alongside of Finn and |fell into a yarn with him. One thing led to another, and Tody Monson's name mentioned. Was she a pleasant lady ? " said l. Ay, to look at, your honour. £7p to the hammer. A little too much of her, some folks might think, but such eyes, sir 1 such teeth 5 and talk oi figures /"and here he delivered a low prolonged whistle of admiration. She was a tolerably amiable lady, I suppose ?" said I carelessly. "Well, sir, if you'll foigive me for saying of it, that's just" what she toam't," he replied. " She was one of them parties as can be very glad and very sorry for themselves and for nobody else. She steered Sir Wilfrid as X might this here Bride. She needed ,frit 1 to set her course and the craft answered ithe shift of helm right away off. Ye never saw her, sir?" "Never." 4 'Well, she hadn't somehow the appearance of what I tarm a marrying woman. She looked to be one of them splendid females as can't abide husbands for the reason that, being made up of -wanity, nothing satisfies 'em but the sort of admiration that sweethearts feels. I took notice once that, she being seated in a cheer, as it might be there," said he, indicating a part of the deck with a nod of his long head, " Sir Wilfrid draws up alongside of her to see if she were comfortabfe and if he could run on any errand for her; she scarcely gave him a look as she answered short, as though his merely being near fretted her. But a minute arter up steps a gent from the cabin, the Honourable Mr. lAcy, and dawdles up to her, pulling at his bit of a whisker and showing of his teeth over a long puking of ' Ilaw 1 haws 1' and 4 Yaases;' and then see the change in her ladyship! Gor bless my heart and soul, your honour, 'twarn't the same woman. She hadn't smiles enough for this hero honourable. Her voice was like curds and whey. She managed the colour in her cheeks, too, somehow and bloomed out upon the poor little dandy when a minute afore her face to her husband waB as blank as a custard. No, Mr. Monson, sir, her ladyship wasn't a marrying woman. She was one of them ladies meant by natur to sit in a gilt cheer in the heart of a crowd of young men all a-bowin<» to and a-worshipping of her; very diffe^ rent from her sister, sir, That little lady down below there I allow'll have the true makings of an English wife and an English mother in her, for all she's an Australian. "I suppose, then, you were not very much surprised when you heard of Lady Monson's elopement ? " "No more surprised, your honour, than a man can be when a thing that he's been expecting has happened. But she's not going to stick to the ColoneL If his honour don't overhaul the Shark and separate 'em she'll be separating herself long afore the time it 'ud occupy the schooner to sail round the world. Lord love 'ee, sir ; if I were to hear of her heeloping with some African king, atop of an elephant, it wouldn't surprise me. When a woman like her allows a chap to cut her cable he must be a wiser man than e'er a prophet of them all that's writ about who s going to tell you where the hull'll strand or bring up." delivered himself of these words Srr Wilfrid showed in the hatch handing Miss Jennings up the ladder, and my compamon started away on a lonely quarterdeck walk The girl looked veiy grave and worried; my cousin, gaunt and haggard, with a fire in his weak, protruding eyes that was like the light of fever or of famine. He grasped my hand and held it wlnlst he sent a look round. I spoke lightly of the fine breeze and the yacht's pace and the good runs we should be making if this weather held, finding someunng in his instant's assumption of. a hearty demeanour, a sort of Btrained liveliness far more affecting than his melancholy, that was like a request to mo not to venture upon any sort of personal inquiries. He called to Finn to know th« speed, then said, "Charles, give Laurr. your arm, will you ? There's too much wind to sit. She looks a little pale, but i few turns will give roses to her cheeks. My head aches, and I must keep below out of this air till I am better." Misg Jennings took my arm, for there "THB SHOT'S STRUCK THE BOAT, YOUR HONOURS, AND SUNK HER J" would happen a frequent lee swing with a rise of the bow and a long slanting rush to the whole weight of the cloths till you could have spooned up the white water over the side with your hand that rendered walking difficult and fatiguing ; very soon I placed chairs under the weather bulwarks, snugging her witli rugs and shawls, and in the comparative calm of that shelter we were able to converse. "Wilfrid looks very ill this morning," said I. "He has had another warning," she answered. " The deuce he has. "When ? " " Last night." " What sort of warning is it tliis time ?" "Precisely the same as the first one," she replied. " I am grieved "but not surprised," said I. "I very much fear he is going from bad to worse. I Btill hold with the views I expressed last evening. A time may, nay, a time must come, when you yourself, Miss Jennings, ardent as is your sisterly desire, will look to me for some resolution that shall preserve us and himself too from the schemes of a growing distemper She was silent. "Did lie tell you," continued, " the nature of the warning ? "Yes," she answered. " In confidence ? if so of course— " No," she interrupted, " he came from nis cabin after breakfast when you had gone on deck, and I saw at once that something was very wrong with liim. "was determined to get at the truth and questioned him persistently, and then he told me all." " All! " exclaimed I, opening my eyes, for the word seemed to indicate some very large matter lying behind his confession. "What lie has seen," she said, "for >cwo nights running has been a mysterious writing upon his cabin wall." " Humph!" said I. "Do you remember, Mr. Monson, that he told- as of a dream in which ho had seen a boat with a sort of sign-board in it on which was inscribed the word Monday in lettera of flame? Well, he sees the same sort of fieiy scrawl now in his cabin. " What is the nature of the message ? "He says that the words are 'Uetobn lo BABY 1'" " He has dreamt this," said I, " or it some wretched trick of lie sight or brains but I would rather believe it a dream." "It is an illusion of some kind no doubt," she exclaimed, " but it is strange that it should occur, be the cause what it will, on two successive nights and much about the same time. No wonder the poor fellow is depressed this morning. It is not only that he fears this warning as signifying that something is seriously Wrong with baby, and that it is a mysterious command to him to return to her at once ; he dreads that it may occur again to-night and to-morrow night, continuously "indeed, until it actually drives him mad by obliging him to make up his mind either to neglect his child or to abandon his pursuit of his wife." " The long and short of it is, Miss Jennings," said I, "that when it comes to ones being thrown with a man whose mind is a misfit that's apt to shift like an ill- stowed cargo to any breeze of wind that heels the craft over, one must' stand by,' as sailors say, for troublesome halfhours and bewilderingly unexpected con frontments." But there was no use in my telling her the wish was strong in my mind that if it was to be Wilfrid's unhappy destiny to grow worse, then the sooner he acted in such a way as • to force all hands to see that it would be at his own as well as at our peril to leave him at large and to suffer him to preserve: control over the movements of the yacht,, and by consequence the lives and fortunes of those who sailed in her, the better; for I protest that even in the thick of my talk with the girl I never sent a glance at the white roll of spinning waters- twisting and roaring away alongside without .a sense of the absurdity of the whole businesB, the.aimlessness of the pursuit, the futility of it as -a project of revenge, its profound idleness as scheme of recovering Lady Monson, guess ing, as anyone could from .my cousin's talk and from what Laura' Jennings had let fall, that if Wilfrid should succeed in regaining his wife he wouldn't know what in the world to do with her J (To be continued.)
