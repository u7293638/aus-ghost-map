0UK AMTOEMENTS. . ; THE MUSICAL UNION. Since our last publication we had the pleasure of hearing the members of the Musical Union perform selections from various oratorios that they, have ^already given ; amongst these are Naaman, the Creation, St. Paul, Elijah, Messiah, &c.; The hall, or at least that part occupied by the performers, was tastefully decorated with evergreens-, and evem^e looked as happy and as comfortable as could be. Of ^^performances we can only say, without particularising, that with the exception of once everything went as well as anyone could desire, and much credit is due to the instructor and conductor, Mr. Wallace. CLABK'S GAIETY TROUPE. Mr. Punch would call attention to the opening of this company's entertainment on Monday night under the management of the well-known entrepreneur Mr. Liddy, so well and favourably known in the theatrical world.

This wonderful and amusing entertainment had a most unfavourable time of it in Launseston owing to the very bad weather, which added to the discomfort of the audience in that chilling place the Pavilion. This fact is to be regretted" because the entertainment is really deserving of any patronage it gets ; and each one from the proprietor downwards—not forgetting Mrs. Read—strives very hard to make the audience pleased. When in India, Calcutta, and other places where Mr. Read exhibited his wondrous illusions, both Mr. and Mrs. Read , received the very highest praise from Royal personages as well as their subjects ; and Mr. PUNCH regrets that no suitable place. Was available in Launceston, but has no hesitation in predicting for the entertaining in Hobart Town the support it so well deserves, and which Mr. PUN6H, by reason of its merit, wishes it.
