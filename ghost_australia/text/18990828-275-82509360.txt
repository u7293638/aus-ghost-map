A GHOST IN TEE SOUSE OF COMMONS. MRS. MILMAN'S DOUBLE. A ghost is alleged to haunt a portion of the House of Commons/ The appa rition, it is said, has frequently made itself visible in the rooms of Mr. A. J. C. Milinan, the assistant clerk in the House, and takes the form of Mrs. Mil man, . but always appears; strange to say, in that lady's absence. A scepti cal reporter (? Having some doubts. about the authenticity of the story') has taken the trouble to make a personal call . on Mrs. 'Milinan. 'The funny thing about the story is that it is per fectly true!' says Mrs. Milman. 'It lias been going on for years. People are constantly telling me that they have seen me in places- where I have certainly not been at the time they mention. One of my hobbies is book-binding. I have a binding-room at the top of the house. One afternoon a friend was as sisting me, and on taking his leave found me again on the' other side of the binding-room. Quite taken back— he said — he stood aside to let my double pass in. I have never seen my double myself, but I have heard of it. One night when I had just retired to my bedroom I heard a. noise outside the door, and made sure there was some thing there. I went out, and found all the doors on the landing open. I went back and fastened my door by means of a 'night bolt,' which is worked by a rope from the bed. The handle of the door was immediately turned, and the door pushed open again, the bolt being shot back. I again went out — and found nobody there. Then. I .rang for two of the servants— my maid at the top of. the house,, and the butler at the bottom. As they came to me I knew that they must intercept anyone 'on the stairs. My maid had seen nobody, but the butler had just met me, coming through- the folding doors at the bottom corridor.
