AN EXPOSURE OF GHOSTS. d How to lay a ghost was tlie useful subject of a letter written by Mr. Frederick Wicks in the Times on August 20. it may be safely commended to the attention of the Psychical Research Society. Mr. Wicks found himself (says the St. James's Bud ct) tile embarrassed possessor of a "haunted" house. There was one room, occupied by servants, in which appalling noises were heard. The housemaid had hysterics; the cook gave notice. So Mr. Wicks took action. He put his «on, a young gentleman without nerves and with a legal training, to sieop in the haunted room. Sure enomrii, the observer was awakened in the middlu of the night by tho proper ghostly s muds. Ho heard the noise of a scuffle, the fall of a body, a sound as of a heavy bodydragged across the floor, and, finally, a. long, wailing cry of'a suitably "blo.jd-curdling description. Mr. Wicks tracked the sounds to their lair, and found thoy came from a closed f. So he uent in a carpenter, who explored the rafters, and discovered that a large colony of bats had taken up their abode inside the roof. The bats were chased away, and the sounds ceased. It seeing almost a pity to Jay so promising a " ghost" so quietly. If only Mr. Wicks had invited a committee of the Psychical Research Society to make mvestigaions, we rni^ht have had ? spectral correspondence which would have kept us interested— and cool—all through- the silly-season^ For there is nothing like a ghostly shiver down the backbone for cooling one's temperature on a hot day.
