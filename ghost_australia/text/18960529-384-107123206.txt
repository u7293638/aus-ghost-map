Tho S1W of Omission. B? ManGanZ B. SLaoTGE.. It len- the thing you do, dear, I,..nething you leave undone, Weasuch gives you a bit of a headache At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The ietter you did not write, The lowar you might have sent, deai Are your haunting ghosts to-night. e stone you might have lifted Out of a brothers away, The bit of heoarts me counsel, You are hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The genrie and winsoor.e tone, That you oad no time nor thought foa With trouble enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily vua of mind, 'he'-e ohauceo to be sogye,? Which even mortals nond They cone in night and silence. Each chill, reproachful wraith, W?en hope is faint and flagging, And a blght has dropped so faith." P?or life is all too short, dear, And .orrow is all too great, To suffer our stow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing to do, dear, , It's the thing you leave undone, A%'hieh gives yoo the hitter headacha ,A?t the se?ttsnug of the see.
