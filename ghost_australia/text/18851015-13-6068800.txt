RACES The race meeting held at Elsternwick park yesterday), although favoured by fine weather, was not so largely attended 63 was antici- pated, considering the number of racing men at present in town There was an excellent programme for the day, commencing with a rather uninteresting event in the Austra- lion Trotting Sires Produce Stakes. His arrangement was best two heats out of three, but Garfield happily distanced his opponents, and there was no necessity for a repetition For the Hurdle Rice, Mistake, who fell at Caulfield on Saturday was made favourite and this time Batty had better luck as by hard riding he brought the horse home a winner by a short head. The finish was most exciting n3 1 use only beat Distiller for second place by a head also In a held of 13 for the Ladies Trophy Nuncio was favourite but he only got second, the race being comfortably won by Orlando A dozen horses make up a good field for the two mile race over fences and again one of Mr Millers steeplechasers came home first, Studley who was the favourite at the short odds of 5 to 2 winning in a canter, Chester and land sticker filling the other places. Xenophon came down, and gave his rider (Hill a most) fall For the Selling Flat Race there were nine starters Mabel Gray) and Sorcerer being equal favourites The latter, who won 111 very easy fashion at the late Hunt Club meeting, came with a fast run towards the finish of the race, and beat Mabel Gray by a length and a half Again his victory proved an acceptable one to the club the owner having to pay £270 for the right of 1 epping the horse, and £245 of that amount went to the club funds. Another excellent held of 13 came out for the Elsternwick park Handicap Coriolanus was the favourite the odds against him being 7 to 4. Kit Nubbles was, however, backed so freely that his price shortened considerably before the start. the son of the Diver proved him self to be a good horse by winning rather easily, Umberto being second and the favourite Cooranga third A Maiden 1 rot, for which eight horses started was won by the Ruler, but as his rider could not bring down the side on coming to weigh in, the horse was disqualified and the race given to Confusion ide long programme was got through at a conveniently early hour The following are the details of the racing - LOST AUSTRALIAN TROTTING SIRES PRODUCE STAKES A sweep of £5 each for starters added to a subscription of L 5 each from the owners of sires I trust 100 sons second 144 sovs third 10 sovs Mile I cats best t our Um i (have s 011)).

THE LAWN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP. The final match for the double handed championship was played yesterday on the court of the Melbourne Cricket Club, between Messrs Highett and Webb and Messrs Riddell and Coldham, the former winning by 25 games to 10. The match was a most interesting one from the commencement, as it was generally expected that Messrs Riddell and Coldham would win, but the play of the winners proved too good from the start and after the first 10 games It could be seen that a good match would ensue, as the game then stood 0 to 4 , at the second change the games were 12 to 3, and from this point the winners only lost eight games. The play of Mr. D. Webb was much admired, his strokes being most accurate, and he fairly beat Mr Coldham at his own game, his fast and quick returns completely baffling his opponent; but Mr Highett really excelled himself, his play being splendid. Mr. Kidd oil did not play as well as usual, and at times Mr. Coldham was as active and good as ever The winners each receive a trophy, value eyes _ SPORTING TELEGRAMS. (From Our Correspondents.)
