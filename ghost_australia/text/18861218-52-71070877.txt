(BY .EBANK JLE'MÔN.)' ; Eleven years ago therelived; in one of the: Aus-: tTalian ^coloriies, a squatter, by tho, name 'of' Connors! : He was a ¿T.P., was this Squatter j he waa also an old bachelor, and remited to be verv wealthy/but He was; close-fisted and miserly; and' lived-by Himself/and ne ver entertained anybody, nor eyer spent à penny more than he could possi bly help j and so itcatne to pass that he was nick named"Skinflint Connors." ! . Now, it so. happened tbata misguided Irishman, '.';.'!jyJtHe name of Gallagher, took up a selection to tho; extent of 320 acreB on old Oonnors's run. ; jonribrs was indignant beyond measure, and tried Dy every species of bounce and threat to evict'his ! ? humble neighbor. But tho law was on the side ' C.: tue poor man, and he hold out ; and eventually I tho squatter changed , his tactics, and offered tb ! . buy him off. . : ' 7^ Tb this Gallaghar ' was; willing. 'But' Ho had j bisown ideas as to the value bf Iiis selection! and these were - sowidely ^different. from1 those, of ''Skmfhnt Connon ! anything;. like , terinsj .and they were still nogo- \ tîàting, off and on, when au ¿vent happened which ' \ rather upset matters. Gallagher died. He was j ? ;killEdVih fact. , He was returning one day from j the tácese riding a young colt, and in a state of ] "tipsy excitement was galloping through the bush v.#îtén Ahe: ,was dashed against a troc, aud. killed. So'--thc projected bargain was suspended -until such time aa Mr. Connor might be (able to come I . tb term B wi th tho widow. , :- ;" j Thus much by way of introduction." ; . r -; V/Three days before Christmas, in theyear seventy five; I waa returning from a business trip, in the district, and, pulling up to pass the héat of, 4iië day at a way side accommodation house, I got into conversation with a little boy thorel ' ; -'j ? h"y'':\ ' Goin' to stop'ere to-night ?" asked the ;bt>yyuH ".No, my son/' I replied, " I'm.going on." lî .

' '.'.''.'7-' '" Consequently, I kept a bright look ou^i as I drove along the road that night, eöp'edaBy wbéú I was/àg I judged, sqmewhero in tho neighbor^ .Hood' -'bf rGaUagher*s: selection. ' It was a' clear night, partly moonlight, and Tbbuld seo rv' good . distance ahead when the timber was not top thick j and presently my vigiianco was rewarded, for, sure enough, I could observe coming toward me a whito horse, apparently at full gallop, and on >.- its back a something of unearthly and terrifying appearance. AU I could tell was that it waa whifcb, with two glaring red eyes liko balle of fire, and a glaring gash like an open mouth, and that ït'Éeemed to urge the horse on at a mad rate of speed. J.puUcd up as soon as the thing liovo in sight j and tho HOTSO I was driving cooked its ears and stood trembling with fright. I was hoping, and yet dreading, that the phantom, br ' whatever it was, would pass close by me, but it turned off into the bush and disappeared ; and it was only then that I noticed that although thc horse had appeared to be galloping heavily, I could hear no sound bf footfalls ! A creeping sensation seemed to up and downjny back. I had seen a ghost ! The very thought of it made mo turn pale ; and, whipping my horse up, I drove on quickly, looking over my shoulder overy few seconds, to see that I was not being followed by tho mysterious apparition. I reached the township safely at a late hour that night ; and next morning I made an early visit to a particular friend of mino, who was manager of ono of tho local banks. To him I related with truo circumstantiaHty my adventure of tho previous night ; and I aßked him what he thought of it. I fully expected that he would impugn my veracity, or my sobriety, or something. Bat he did nothing of tbe sort. He merely puckered up his mouth,' and pîn'oliéd his chin, and observed, . : i j " "Well, that's strange, very strange. Do you know I've heard stories about this ghost before, but I never believed thom? I begin to think there's something in it. -j '"I'll swear there is," I remarked, with as much emphasis as I could throw in. I " X have three fellows going out camping with mb to-morrow," said the banker. " If you like to make one, we'll go to Gallagher's, and see if wo can't lay thia ghost. There's something peculiar about it, and it wants clearing up. They say tho animal that carries the ghost is the very one Gallagher waa riding when he was killed; and, although that horse was advertised, aud searched for high and low, ho's never been seen or heard of'from that day to this, except in connection] with this ghost affair." :-"That's highly peculiar," I observed. 1 í (,'ff Carriers have asserted that they have seen tnis.'apparition flying past Gallagher's ; and Mrs. Gallagher, they toll me, is terrified to death almost, and has pretty well made up her mind to forfeit the selection, and clear out." Í v" Well, let's make a Christmas excursion of it, and solve the mystery." ¡ ;" Hight you are, old,man ; we'll, do it/'said ¡the banker.

Mr. Adam3 explained that wo were going; to; camp out, down the creek, and that ono object of; our visit was to find something out about the gal loping spectre which had been seen in the locality.: At this the good lady was much concerned. "Now, don't be puttin'yerselves in harm'BWay,! gintlemcn," she said, " for tho like3 of me. Shuro: I know it's poor Gallagher's ghost (God save UB !)> that's warnin' us to lave the district. But don't' ba after lookih' for it, gintlemen, for only the worst o' luck follows any wan that secs a ghost." " You may trust to our discretion, Mrs. Galla gher," said the banker. " We won't como to any harm. But just send Dinny to put us on to a good place for a camp, and we'll bo for ever obliged." '. ; , .'That I will, sir, wid.the complatest -pleasure,; an' ho shall make up afire for yez; an' if 'it'sany; consideration, ho shall stay an' cook yer vieles, too.» v . .. ^;^'r^ So Dinny was sent j but it, goon b'ecatne. evident that the only wayinwhioh'ttíe ¡bááTcérfwanted to use the ladfa knowledge fof the'lpbaTity Waa to ascertain where .'the ; ghost had/been1 seen, and v/hat road- he was supposed to frequent in his nightly gallops. This was not easily accomplished, for Dinny was very " ekeery" on the subject, and had evidently not desired to know too much about it. But it was pretty clear that, in order to reach thc pointa where he was reported to have been seen, tho ghost must have come along a bush track leading on to the main road, aud crossed the cre¿>k just below Gallagher's sliprail. At thi3 spot, therefore, Adams decided to make an experiment which he had been revolving in his mind. Wo proceeded down the creek, a matter of a quarter cf a mile or BO, fixed our tent, boiled our billies, enjoyed our first meal in camp ; and when the night had fairly set in we went back to the crossing place to make our arrangements. Two conveniently situated gum trees stood one on each side of tho road, and to these, at a height of six br seven feet from tho ground wo fastened a strong rope, which stretched across the road and the creek at the same time. A kerosene tin with a quart *>r two of oil in it, waa placed adja cent; and the rope having been tested and found firm, snouts wore placed a short distance along the road each way, and all being ready we settled down to await developments. - .

On came tho apparition down the slope to the creek; with a bound the,white steed oleared tho water ; there was a loud grunt, as of a man struok violently in tho region known as the *' bread basket;" and next moment,a riderless horso wa3 galloping away, and a very substantial ghoBt was hanging in mid-air, suspended by tho middle over the rope. A lighted match dropped by the bank manager into tho kerosene lit up the scene with a flare ; and five excited individuals danced and yelled around the suspended ghost like so many blackB at a corroboree. . ' ' "Drop, or Til Bhoot ye!" shouted the bank manager. - ' . . ? '. " Agh !" groaned tho gho8t. : . " Drop !" repeated the banker. " Once ! twice ! third and-'.-" " ? ' ' Down splashed tho ghost into the iniuddy creek. We mado a rush, dragged him''out ,'by main force, stripped off a sheet, under which on his head ( Jwas a tall hat with three holes in" it/ and a our* ningly arranged bull's-eye lantern inside j and there in the midst of us stood a short, stubby whiskered, grizzly-lookir, g man, palo and pantin g. " Skinflint Connors, as I'm alive !" cried one of our party. " Connors, you nrserable villain," said the banker, "as you're no customer of mine I'll take you in to the po^ce station, and prosecute you . ?without a shadow of mercy, you deplorable wretch!" , " Why, Mr. Adams," whined the whilom ghost, " I was only having a little joke you know." " Whose gray horse waB that ?" demanded the .. banker; and at that moment our scout who had been stationed on that side came up, leading tho veritable animal, with it« feet muffled in lumps of sheepskin, till they looked thrice their eizo. . "I don't know, Mr. Adami ; I don't really. I found him in my stable last Christmas Day. i "Gallagher's horse, by all's that's ugly. And you've had him under lock and key for twelve months. So ho! Horse stealing in the first place, and attempting to extc rfc money or pro perty in the second. I think you're good for about fourteen years, Connors." "Just for a joke, Mr. Adams?" pleaded Connors. .> "Don't be eo hard, Mr. Adams. Surely aman can have a little joke." ' " Woll¿ I'm going to have a little joke now," said the manager. "Suppose you come up to Gallagher's wich me, and buy them out light off." " .. , . .; j "Oh, 'pon my soul, Mr. Adams! Look at.the - , stát¿>of ¡;me.; j I'm going over to Gallagher^ to morrow. I am, EO help »no." "' - ''? . " Now br never," said the manager.. "Up toi Gallagher's, or in to the police staiicn. Wnich is it to be?" ' ' . \ *' '. Well, if you're sp particular, I suppose I must go, Mr. Adams. ' But don't be took hard.*'] ni onlya poor irian, Mr. Adams j, I am really." And, whining and '^leading all the way, he walked with us up to Gallagher's house.' , ' , We made quite a party, there being six'in the crowd, beside our prisoner; and as;we/öppioachi}d' the dogs barked furiously.

This was signed by Connors, whoso face was a picture of gruesome misery the while, and witnessed, at the banker's request, by Mr. Andy Miles. ' ; ' ; ¿ Next, on a blank sheet of paper; : Mr. Adania drew out an order on the Commorûial Bauk fór the full amount of the purchase; and' though, it waa evidently gall and wormwood to him, Skin- , < flint ;Connors signed this too. n \ 1 ."There you are, Mrs. Gallagher," said the banker. "Lock these papers up. And now, let na have a bottle of the most generous liquor; you - have in the house, and we'll drink to Mr. Con nors's good health and happiness." '? , This ceremony was completed, and then we allowed the squatter to depart; and, as.far as he' is concerned, 1 need only add that he ne?«$M»*«Ui the smallest attempt to back out of his bargain, but took over the selection, and even provided the Gallaghers with a waggon and team where with, to remove themselves and their household gods to another part of the country. After old Connors had departed, a messen get was sont to our camp for certain supplies, with which a great spread was made out on the veran dah. Then Mr. Adams put oh the ghoBt'shat and; lantern, and winding sheet ; whereat the girls screamed and clung to tho boys, and the boys laughed and clung to tho girls '; and Andy Mücs produced a concertina, which he played like Paddy did tho trombone, "by main foórcej" and wo all ate and drank and danced to our hearts' content. And I may safely declare that no jollier company ever sat up all night to wel come in a Merry Christmas, j':! . ' ? ' ''.'?".'.' rr. (
