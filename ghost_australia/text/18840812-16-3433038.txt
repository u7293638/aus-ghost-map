MEETING OF PLANTARA AND FARMERS AT' MARYBOROUGH. [move our own cornuT-O'XnhM 1 M vnxnoKOUi in, August 0 US Friday afternoon a meeting of the Planters and farmers Association was called to consider the importation of Continental low waged labourers The attendance was larger than probably ever known at a meeting of the association Among those present were Messrs. P O'Kelly (president) G A White, H Moncton H M Hall, R li 61 Layton, Jas. Cowan, 1 6 Porter 1 Watson, P Richardson I hj Clayton Clark, Lewis has been, lim boil, and others. The President, in opening adverted to the sugar industry as being of greater extent than gold mining He estimated the value of the sugar product of last year at ¿J0I,<1 >0, against ¿l>')i> 1 >i> realised for gold mines His calculation was based upon the total tonnage of sugar as given in the Cumulan ki of June last, and to get at the value he took the output of the Yengarie Refinery, which was 4000 tons at 250 per ton, the Millaquin at 01 15 tons, with the same value per ton, and the sugar manufactured at all the other cells in the colony, viz , 20 w tons at an average price of ÍT20 per ton line gave a grand total of £901 tiO He claimed that this immense result had not enriched the people engaged in sugar culture so much as the general public who had profited by the demand for skilled and other labour in the need for machinery and other necessaries for the plantations Referring to the labour supply for this huge industry it must be conceded that they had now reached a most critical period Owing to the great demand for kanakas, and he agreed that the kanaka was good Inborn, the supply was getting short, and becoming very costly The cost of passage money was 125, and, owing to the fact that a large percentage arrived from the islands in a sickly condition or indisposed for held work, the cost of the labour was greatly increased Three out of every ten Pol) persians were useless for plantation purposes [A A case " Quite so ] The useless had to be sent back, so that only seven tenths of the recruits were available for work Every Polynesian cost £27 Ida 4d per year, apart from his keep [Mr K B Clayton "More than that 1 He thought, therefore, they would agree with him that it was impossible to canyon with island labour or could they depend upon the white labour to be got here He was happy to say that the facilities for getting employment were so numerous that no surplus w late 1 labour was available when we had few of these cultural class arriving in the colony Those who came found the climate different from home, they succumbed under the heat, or discovered higher rates of wages failing else where In fact there were not as many spare hands in the YY ide Bay district as would supply one plantation borne thought the way out of the difficulty was the institution of the central mill system He was a hunt, witness to the failure of that system from ISM to 175 in this district. We had then trace central mills,, supplied by cane gro vii solely by white labour In 1868 he had in and found 2 tons to the acre The millowners arranged to cut his cane they had only 1 3 to 20 j aids to cart it It cost over 7 per acre to cut and put it to the mill with a navigable river, virgin soil, and good crops, he only netted £11 per acre for his cane All the millowners were ruined (Several voices "Sugar was then £10 a ton ). The farmers were ruined, and went away paupers, all through growing on the central mill system with white labour He got 25 per ton for his simple, which was not anything like first class sugar He need say no more as to the impracticability of growing sugar under the early system Mr G. A White believed that with one or two exceptions he was the oldest planter in the district His experience of the old system was time after collecting plants here and there, he was laughed at, but a French gentleman came to look at his patch, and offered encourage ment, and the best company was started We were then growing maize, and could not export it. It would be the same now Various things had been tried, but not one had succeeded but sugar. He remembered going with Gi cathead when it was proposed to erect a central factory, at the back door of nearly every farmhouse there was a coffee mill, which ground up the coin for food for their families, and the only other food was fish out of the river That state of things existed when they employed labour on the farms at 15s per week. If sugar growing is to cease, what could they grow' If it were not for the sugar growing there would be only 2000 people in Maryborough and they would have one steamer a week. He believed if the sugar industry were destroyed, the saw mills and the foundries would go with it. One of the largest town industries had now paid of all the men, and were only employing boys they could see a steady stream of people going away from the district Mr R U Clayton said the meeting had been called to consider the advisableness of obtain- ing indented labour from Europe at 10s per week, but since the inception of the movement many things had taken place. It was now folly to pass a resolution asking for that which the new bill before Parliament was providing In six months' time the Government would be only too glad to place labour at their disposal at any price He would therefore, in lieu of the motion intended, take up another question, which was included in the following resolution namely, That this association do send delegates, in conjunction with Mackay, to wait on the Colonial Secretary requesting him to extend the period up to which time expired boys may claim exemption, and women be sent to field work, so as to allow time for the new European labour to arrive and take their places, and that for this purpose the Mackay association be at once communicated with in support of the motion he would enumerate several cases of hardship A "boy" on his plantation was but fourteen days short of the fixed time. He had worked within fourteen days, and now the law compels him to be a slave Another instance-and these were not mysteries, but facts woman whose husband was a time expired boy, and who was six months short of his time, and compelled to work where he was not as good as a Chinaman, had six months to serve the husband would not go home, and must be driven out of the town to die The woman had a child born and bred in a kitchen, and on the 1st September would be driven from her offspring to work in the held Mr Griffith was making slaves of the people, and was inviting over the poor Germans to come into slavery line was to be t done on British soil There were also many islanders who had been more than five years in the colony, but during that period had made a voyage home to bring brothers to the colony These would now be compelled to become slaves Then as to the women, it was determined that they were to be turned out into the fields How could the towns supply the planters with domestic servants' He supposed the planters would have to cook their own rations The time must be extended until the new labour was forthcoming They were receiving scurvy treatment Another matter called for attention. The other day a ship came in, when some agitator telegraphed to the Colonial Secretary that the recruits did not understand their agreements, whereupon Mr Griffith wired up inquiring the nature of the agreements This was done, although the Government had their own appointed agent on board, and an immigration agent at the port. The outcome of the political agitator s investigation was this-that out of the ninety three recruits on board the Roderick Dhu seventy six had been in Queensland before and were gladly coming back to the plantations He thought it was unnecessary to do anything respecting the rate of wages, as Mr Griffith, with Mr Brookes at Ipswich, on the "10th October last, stated that he would get white labour at from 10s to 1 paper week. Mr. H M Hall seconded the proposition for delegates He learned that the Messrs Clayton would be in Brisbane next week, and might be accompanied by Mr Power and perhaps the Hon R B Sheridan, the latter having de- clared himself the friend of the Polynesians The Chairman, in putting the motion, said some references had been made to Mr. Griffith which should be withdrawn 'I they ought to remember that all along concessions had been made to the plaintiff and he must say that the | Polynesians were introduced for held labour alone He entirely agreed that if women were turned out into the field they would die Still he was sure the meeting did not coincide with the expressions about making slaves He was happy to say that when he had the honour of waiting on the Premier some time ago the planters were dealt with kindly in every matter that they submitted with reference to the Roderick Dhu informer, he had learned that the party never went on board to ascertain the truth of his allegions How could the Colonial Secretary help acting in the matter as he did, in the state of public feeling Though he was not in the confidence of Mr Griffith, he believed he was quite willing to act fairly Mr R B Clayton, in deference to the meeting, would withdraw his expressions, only he still held his own opinion. Mr. H. Moncton supported the motion, which was put to the meeting and carried. The (Juanmau moved the following resolution .-" That the Government be asked to ap- point an agent in Cîei'iiuiny to indent labourers from that country and other parts of Europe for three years' service on farms and planta- tions at 10s. per week" He held in his hand a copy of the Inimigi aSion Bill), which provided that only £1 was to be paid for assisted immigrants, instead of £2; as in the Act of 1888 But if the labourers were imported wholesale they would compete with that general labour market. It was advisable to request the appointment of an agent in the German Empire at once who should be empowered to indent labour for service to employers in Queensland, else coming in shoals free to do as they like, then countrymen here would tell them not to engage. It was better to have the men at a fixed wage for a term of years than to be at the mercy of those who might come in a general way. Mr. G A. White seconded There was a gentleman in the district, a civil engineer, who had come from the part of Cox many where the best labour was to be procured He stated that they might get a great number from the towns who would be useless 'The right class could be got in an) number, but the cost of Lo to reach the ship would have to be provided These were first class men, and they would willingly hue for two or three years at 10s. per week, board were now coming out under similar agreements The motion was carried by a considerable mainly, one or two hands were held up against, and some did not vote either way. After some discussion as to the intentions of the Polynesian Act, with respect to the cm employment of kanakas about the mills, it being understood that, save engine driving and other matters specified, mail work was admissible, the meeting came to a close by a hearty vote of thanks to the chairman. Till Maryborough Chronicle reports a fatal accident at Messrs Wilson Bros' Buibnrim plantation, Mr. A kanaka, while in the act of flying with cane, the mill rollers, which were being tried pasT to a commencement of the season a crushing, missed his footing and fallen to the rollers In trying to recover himself his arm was drawn in, and before the mill could be stopped the unfortunate boys body was jammed between the rollers, and so badly crushed that he expired shortly after being released A <omu.svONOTM to the Albury Bunnin calls attention to the necessity of some steps being taken to preserve the various stock routes of the colony for the purpose for which they were intended The writer shows that in nearly every case these routes, supposed to be set apart for the use of travelling stock), are eaten bare by the lessees of adjoining lands The runholders, it appears, have to pay rent for these roads, and therefore not unnaturally consider they have some right to the grass It is suggested that an allowance should be made for the area taken from any lease by these roads, and that stringent regulations should then be framed to prevent the roads being trespassed upon by stock which have no right to be depastured thereon On Tuesday afternoon last (says the M it pay widow of 2nd instant a meeting of the Mac kay Planters' Association was held at the AJS Bank, Mr E M Long in the chair On the motion of Mr. King, seconded by Mr Donaldson, it was agreed, "that the Government be requested to appoint some medical man to assist Dr Clailtaon, ' and ' That the Government be requested to make the hospital capitation fee satin nable up to one fixed date during the year " The chairman invited a discussion on the subject of wages paid to Lui o press, in which it was unanimously agreed that considering the very great reduction in the value of sugar, and the principle that the work ing men, who had participated in the ad vantages of good times, should also bear in a small degree the rev 01 ses now being experienced in the industry, it was imperative that a reduction of at least 10 per cent should be made in the scale of wages On the motion of Mr. Walker, seconded by Mr Donaldson, the following scale was adopted for future engagements Island labour gangers, 15s to 2s , ploughmen, 15s to 20s , bullock drivers, 20s to 25s , carpenters, 20s to 40s., blacksmiths, 11s to 45s , fitters and engine drivers, 20s to 30s , bushmen, 20s to 25s , teamsters, 20s to U , horse driver s, 10s to 12s 6d, labourers, 10s to 15s 'That the wages of those at in sent engaged be reduced by 10 per cent from next pay day It was moved by Mr King and seconded by Mr. Mnci are,-" that the Government be i requested to make immediate arrangements for the supply of 2000 white agricultural labourers, to be employed under twelve months' agreements, at tho rate of 10s per week It was also agreed that the time for ploughmen, to work on the plantations should be fifty three hours per week, and that to provide a necessary certain revenue to the district hospital, to which all labour ing men should contribute, Is per months would be deducted from Everyman's wages for the benefit of the institution.

One of the live ones was unable to breads, except in ough a tube fixed in its chest.'
