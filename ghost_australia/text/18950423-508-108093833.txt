Luminous Fungus. Mr. J. S. Bray, naturalist, has brought us a specimen of the luminous fungus to which reference was made some few days since. It is, as most are aware, fairly plentiful in some of the suburbs of this city in favorable seasons, but is always beautiful and interesting when its pecu- liarities are made apparent by darkness. By daylight it is simply a dull, unsightly " toadstool"' sort of production.
