PHOEBE. ERE pales in Heaven the morning star, A bird, the loneliest of its kind, Hears Dawn's faint footfall from afar While all its mates are dumb and blind. It ia a wee sad-coloured thing, As shy and secret as a maid, That, ere, in choir the robins sing, Pipes its own name like one afraid. It seems pain-prompted to repeat, The story of some ancient ill. But Phc.be ! Thtabel sadly sweet Is all it says, and then is still. It calls and listens: Earth and sky, Hushed by ihe pathos of its fate, Listen; no wbisper of reply Comes from its doom-dissevered mate. rhuibe! it calls and calls again, And Ovid, could he but have heard, Had hung a legendary pain About the memory of the bird j A pain articulate so long In penance of some mouldered crime Whose ghost still flies the Furies' throng Down the waste solitudes of Time ; Waif of the young World's wonder hour, Whejtgods found mortal maidens fair. And will malign was joined with power, Love's kindly laws to overbear, Like Proene, did it feel the stress And coil of the prevailing words Close round its being and compress Man's ampler nature to a bird's ? One only memory left of all The motley crowd of vanished scenes. Hers—and vain impulse to recall By repetition what it means. Phabe ! is all it has to say In painful cadence o'er and o'er, Like children that have lost their way And know their names but nothing more. It ia a type, since Nature's lyre Vibrates to every note in man, Of that insatiable desire, Meant to be so, since life began ? I, in strange lands at grey of dawn, Wakeful have heard that fruitless plaint Through Memory's chambers deep withdrawn Renew its iterations faint. So nigh! yet from remotest years It seems to draw its magic, rife With longings unappeased and tears Drawn from the very source of life. —JASIE8 RUHETT Lowers, in the Century Magazine.
