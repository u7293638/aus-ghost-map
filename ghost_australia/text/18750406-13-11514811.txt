ARRIVAL OF THE CALIFORNIAN " MAIL. ' NOTES. OF THE MONTH. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, FEB. 9. Pat.lament is opon, and the "long pent u stream " of London life IB once more loose for the season The Queen's Speech, which is never expocted either to say anything or to say it in good English, is this year more candid and well written than usual, with scarcely any blunder to vex the grammatical soul of William Cobbett. It has even a cer tain literary flavour and a courtly grace which have been set down to the influence of Mr. Disraeli It would be hard, indeed, i .what is practically the drat session of the first real Ministry under a literary man whose boast has been that he has "ni other 'scutcheon ' we did not have i speech from the Throne whose style should distinguish it, if nothing else from thi vapid and átenlo productions to whicl wo aro accustomed In other respects thi Royal Message is a remarkable one Then »re actually four whole paragraphs devotee to the colonies ' Why, I have known man] Royal Speeches coming from Government! of great liberality and commanding power, ir .which not a single word was vouchsafed to the colonies As a rule, the sewers and high ways of England have been thought mort worthy of mention in these documents Turn was when oven Mr Disraeli would have pai. but small attention to the condition of the colonies m a political programme We liav. changed all that It is surprising how verj unanimous we all are, now that we do agree, Everybody admits the grace and propriety ol giving a foremost place to the colonies m the Queen's Speoch, of making thom, in fact, the piece de resistance at the banquet which is set before Parliament In other points the Speech has been well praised on all sides as judic.ous, moderate, and sensible, nor is the programme thought any the worse of because it announces no Btarthng novelties of a heroic and sensa- tional character As was well said by the mover of the Address-a young man who performed a somewhat difficult task with singular ability and Buccess-this was "the Speech, not only of a Queen of the British Islands, but of a Queen of the British Empire " There is not a trace in it of a special party colour, and, m fact, all the measures which it announces may be said to be regarded as just and necessary by Tories and Radicals alike Thiswaa.mdeed, made a tnatterof com- plaint by the Marquis of Hartington on behalf of the Opposition The substance of his criticism was that the Government had pre- pared nothing but "wise, salutary, and beneficent legislation " "Why do you not give us," tho new Liberal leader seemed to any, "something which we can dispute about —something which is essentially Tory, and therefore, according to our conception of what is Tory, reactionary, tending to barbarism, and opposed to progress? Why does not your policy in office echo the spirit of your criticism when in Opposition ? " It is not for me to say how far this was a justifiable species of complaint-how far the conduct of the Ministry is consistent with some of the professions and declarations in the past of its 'members That office is one thing, and Opposition another, we ought by this time to understand, by our experience of all Ministries, whether Conservative or Liberal. The best answer which the Government has to make, and it is a tolerably sufficient one, is that the country has signified in an unmistakeable manner its desire for repose and quiet, and that this is the time for the introduction of those practical measures of legislation which are usually lost sight of in the heat and turmoil of party struggle If we can take advantage of this pause in the political con- flict to provide ourselves with wholesome schemes of pure air, pure water, and clean homes, no one has a right to complain That there is ample work for Parliament in this direction alone, everybody confesses, and there is some advantage m gottmg the work done by Tories, seeing that then it is set about m a business like man ner, and is sure of passing quickly, as the Opposition is not likely to be destructive. The opening days of the session have passed off very quietly and there is every prospect of a tranquil and uneventful Parlia- mentary year Tortunately for the peace of the Ministry, they have not thought fit to meddle with the two dangerous questions to which tbey seemed to be committed, namely, education and lehgious worship Tho En- dowed Schools Act is to be dropped like a hot potato, in spite of the quasi pledge given to Mr Beresford Hope last j ear Nor is them anything more to bo done about church discipline At one time it was said that this was going to be an ecclesiastical session given up to discussing who were and who .were not members of the Church of England, but Government has wisely avoided this rock of offence, thus disappointing some of its more hot headed adherents as well as all its enemies Among the latter must be reckoned Mr Bright, who in perhaps tho most injudicious and least successful of the speeches he ever made, ventured to pro phesy somewhat rashly that the Government was going to devote itself to ecclesiastical questions in order to stave off political This was a particularly infelicitous inuendo to come from a friend of Mr Gladstones, seeing that if any one has lately been guilty of doing precisely the thing of which Mr Bright sus- pects tho Government it is conspicuously the ex leader of the Liberal party It is sometimes useful in a controversy, in order to cover your own failure to ac cuse the adversary of tho very intention in which you have miscarried, and to take off the edge of the hostile criticism by charg. ing the other side with doing exactly that which you have done, and you know they can convict you of doing Upon this principle we can understand Mr Bright masking tho sins of his friends by attributing the same ones to his enemies, but it is not a very high minded device, or worthy of the great Tribune of the People But there is evidence enough apart from this Birmingham speech which was indiscreet, ill timed, and "cheeky" to the last degree, to show that the Tribune of the People waxes old and feeble-that he is no longer a tower of strength to his party, or capable of wielding at will that fierce democracy even though he "fulmine o'er tho arsenal." His friends bave done him but a scurvy sort of service m dragging him from his retirement to do liver an allocution urbi et orbi Even his constant admirer, tho Spectator, which is doomed perpetually to see its idols shat- tered, has not a word to say in do fence of this Birmingham exhibition There could have been no other ob ject in the production of this somewhat rusty engine of war than to silence the enemy and give confidence to the faithful But all that Mr Bright did was to discharge his petard at the church establishment and thus blow up as many of his own friends as enemies It was a shrewd way of incul eating that unity which is just now so desirable to the Liberal party to assail all who did not go in for the destruction of the state church The remarkable thing about tho performance was that Mr Bright was very emphatic about tho necessity of the Liberals sinking all their minor differences in order to restore harmony into their broken ranks. He was very severe on the conduct of those " men of one idea ' those fanatics whose folly was treason, who had ruined tho party at the general election, by insisting upon their individual fancies They were men, he insinuated, not fit to have the franchise, who ought to be looked after by their friends, who did not deserve so good and great a leader as Mr Gladstone It need not surprise us to find that some of these idiots, thus roundly abused, have turned round upon their late idol with a tu quoque. Who indeed has tried the patience of his party has insisted more vehemently upon his individual convictions being preferred to the interests of the party than Mr Bright himself ' "What was the purport of this very Burming ham speech but to create discord and to breed confusion in the Liberal ranks' A very large section of the party including nearly all its accepted leaders it is notorious is opposed to the disestablishment of the Church Almost every Liberal of authority who has spoken in public has deprecated the intrusion of this question into the Liberal programme as being certain to divide the party and to put off indefinitely its return to power And yet we have Mr Bright while deprecating mutiny and over independence urging the disestablishment of the Church as the one great business to which tho Liberal party should devote itself It is a proof of the utter chaos into which the party has fallen however that at the meeting of Liberals at tho Reform Club to choose a leader Mr Bright waa selected as chairman Such a choice foreshadowed the result Mr Bright and Mr forster it ia well known have quarrelled and are not on speaking terms Of the two candidates therefore for tho Liberal headship it was tolerably certain that the Marquis of Hart ington would be chosen By what merit raised to that proud eminence it is hard to say It is true that ho is a marquis which goes a great way and that he ia the heir of the Cavendishes which is something and that he has subscribed largely to the erection of the new Liberal Club which is more But for public form he can have no pretensions to vie with Mr Torster Ile ia not an eloquent man nor a very wiso man He is an indifferent debater Ile is cold stuck up ungemal and inelaatic a man about whom nobody can have any enthusiasm and who coming after Mr Gladstone is a great falling off indeed Ho is not even an ornamental figurehead and he could only be chosen for M Thiers a reason as the man qui nous divise le moms Mr Torster is immeasurably the abler man and as one might suppose the moro pro miBing Liberal It is true he introduced the Education Act but that is but an in uni tesimal grievance which only a section of the DissenteiB pretend to feel and for which Mr Gladstone whom all Dissonters have agreed to praise is at least as much responsible as Mr lorster It is but a poor beginning of the new harmony that at a crisis of this kind, when it ia of vital con sequence to themselves that tho Liberals should bo united under a capable leader they should have preferred the Marquis to the commoner, for no better reasop appa rently than that he is a marquis and wiU be shortly out of the way as a duke As for Mr Bright s part in the transaction some of the discontented Liberals have taken a grim pleasure in recalling the days when the fiery tribune of the people would not admit that any good could come out of the noble families-when all our foreign policy and most of our domestic was declared to be a gigantic Byatem of out-door relief for the British aristocracy A good deal of irritation I am told from an mlluential quarter ia felt in Russia at the refusal of Lngland to take further part in the Brussels Conference It is taken up as a personal matte' by tho Emperor Alexander whose particular idea this is and if we may judge by the tone of the St. Petersburg journals orders have been given to abuse England and to utter ominous threats of new alliances AU the amaller powers have followed the lead of England m tina matter although Trance who is just now very anxious to cultivate the friendship of Russia, and who has a distinct motive for doing so has accepted the prqposal of another meeting to formulate the conclusions arrived at bj the Russian jurists at Brussels It is im possible to see what practical good to humanity can come out of the re gulations m the future conduct of wars although it is quite obvious that they will benefit the larger military powers The true course which Lngland ought to take as an answer to any such new international military law is to announce her withdrawal from the engagement lhto which she was foolishly "betrayed at Pans in 1850 respecting the Bacredness of property at sea The power of annoyance nt sea is the choirest weapon in our national armoury-m fact th0 only one which remains to us now that our regiments have melted

AUSTKALASIAN TOPICS (FROM OUR OWN CO_VIVE3R0YDEM ) LOVDON TED 9 THE COLONIAL INSTITUID The adjourned meeting of tho morabera of the Colonial Institute to discuss Mr Labilheres paper on tho unity of the empire was held at the Society of Arta on the 2nd mat and again drew a tolerably numerous audience It had boen hoped that Mr Vogel would have sufficiently recovered from the illness which had corni oiled him to make his journey from Brindisi by easy stages to enablo lum to leave Pans and to he in London before the meeting took place as thero was a general deBiro to hear one who of lato has attracted no small attention from the British public But it was not to bo ho lins however since arrived and it is expected will bo present at a meeting this day {week when Mr T A\ ChesBon the active secrotary for the Aborigines Protec don Society will road a paper on Tiji Colonial questions of late havo been far more frequently discussed in the Tnghsh Eress than they were only two or three years nek, and the debates on the unity of the 1 mpiro and Imperial federation at the Colonial Institute havo been vory genorally noticed ihe affairs of tho colonies occui led no email portion of the Oueon s Speech _ ara graphs being contained in it having roference to the general prosi ority of our dependencies, the annexation of 1 iji the Gold Coast and Natal As regards Iiji it was worthy of remark that not a single deprecatory allusion to the cession was mado by the Oppo aition speakers In the I ords tho address was moved by your lato visitor Lord Donoughmore who created a most favour ablo impression and was highly cora thmented on lils speech by ¿arl Gran ville Mr Stanhope m tho Commons warmly supported the colonial policy of the present Government and expressed his opinion that the policy of disintegration was now dead He had not been at the last meeting of the Colonial Institute, or he would have heard dismemberment advocated very strongly by Sir George Campbell, tho late Lieutenant Governor of Bengal Sir George, however, did not find a Bingle supporter at tho meot. mg, but listened with the greatest com- placency to tho attacks made upon him, and pleaded guilty to being wholly ignorant about tho tolomes, which he acknowledged was peihaps tho very reason why he did not upprcciate their connexion with Eng land The discussions at the Institute have led to a good deal of correspon denco, particularly in the Standard in winch Mr Halliburton, a son of tho author of Sam Slici, has taken a leading part and ably advocates the claims of the colonies to the fullest consideration at the hands of the mother country, THE BURNIÍNG 01 THE COSPATIUCK. The inquiry into this sad event has been proceeding at Greenwich, before the stipen- diary mays-rate, and three assessors ap- pointed by the Board of Trade, and termi nated on Enday. Amongst the counsel engaged m the case was Mr J Dennistoun M ood, representing the Government of New Zealand M Donald, the second mate, Thos Lewis another of tho survivors, and Cotter, the third ono saved, were all examined, as well as several gentle- men connected with the shipping in- terest in London, and some of the emigration officials Captain Foster, chief omigration agent in London, considered that the cubic contents of the BIK boats carried by the vessel was rather in excess of the requirements of the Paasengers' Act, and that they vv ould, at a rough guess, accommo date about one third of the persons carried on board. He further stated that ho nover before knew of an instance of an emigrant ship taking uro with the passengers in her. 'Iho commissioners had sent out 1100 ships, of which only five were lost, and not one by fire. It was his opinion that in case of fire in a wooden ship, it was almost certain two thirds of the passengers must perish He remarked that had tho vessel liad double tho number of boats on board, moro lives would probably not have been saved, as the boats they had were not all utilised. Mr Edward Alfred Smith, despatching officer to the New Zealand Government, considered that the Cospatrick was well fitted and stowed, and was satisfied that the fire did not originate in the boatswain's locker, but be- lieved it broke out in the main hold. Mi. Cohen, who appeared for the Board of Trade, severely commented on the inadequacy of the means provided for Baving life on board ship in case of disaster, and said that it was a state of things which ho did not sun poBe the Government and the public would allow to continue At tho close of the inquiry, Mr Patterson, the Greenwich magistrate, Bald the Court would send in its report to the Board of Trade It will be seen that Mr. Smiths opinion is directly opposed to that of Macdonald who is con. fident that the firo arose in the boatswain's locker. Yesterday the morning papers re- ported that the ship Coldstream, from Madras, had been boarded on Saturday by a pilot off Torbay, and stated she had on board two other survivors of the Cospatrick. The result was, there was a large crowd at Gravesend to meet the vessel, and it turned out to be a mistake, there only being in the Coldstream a sailor who had been with the rescued men at St, Helena. TICHBORNIANA. Mr. Wm Cobbett has succeeded in getting a rule made absolute rescinding the order of Baron Pollock staying proceedings in his action against the governor of Millbank, in which he UaimB £100 penalty for his neglect- ing to give him on demand a copy of the warrant on which the claimant was detained after conviction. Baron Pollock's order had been obtained on the ground that action was vexatious, frivolous, and abuso of the powers of the Court, but the f nil Court considered that it ought not to have been taken out. Mr. Cobbett intends to proceed to trial, and have the matter decided If it goes in his favour gaolers will be liable to bo constantly called upon under similar circumstances Charles Orton has made his appearance at Lambeth Police Court in a piti- able condition, applying for relief from the poor-box, and explaining that he had been turned out of tho Camberwell workhouse. The conversation he had with the magistrate resulted in his being ordered to be removed to Wapping Mr M'Mahon, one of the junior counsel for the claimant at his trial, has received instruction to take the necessary steps for obtaining a writ of error with tho view of having tho conviction quaBhed , and an application is to bo made to the Lord Chancelier or the Court of Ex chequer Chamber for a mandamus compelling the Attorney General to sanction the issue of the writ When the case comes on for argu ment, Sir Vernon Harcourt is to bo the leading counsel Dr Keneally held a meeting at Stoke upon Trent a few days back with a view to election There were Rome 1 000 pre- sent, chiefly of the working classes, and he was very well receiv ed. THE MOUNT AND MORRIS CASE The arguments in this caso were hoard before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on tho 28th and 29th ult, and judg- ment was reserved.

He is the author of a pamphlet pub- lished soon after his return to England en titled "The! ducation and Training of Naval Officers " and was made a naval aide di. camp to the Queen in February 1873 During the year 187-1 there arm ed at Li ver pool from the States and Canada 78110 persons, being 4014G m excess of those landing from the samo quarter in 1873 It is to bo noted, as strongly Bugcestivo of the Bmall opening for labour in the States, that whereas the number of persons coming from tho North American continent was so much larger last year than tho preceding ono, no less than 95 per cent of thoso arriving from the dominion of Canada had return tickets, only visiting this country to seo their friends, and with the full intention of going back to the dominion. This speaks volumes on behalf of Canada, and of the success of tho emigrants who proceed thither. Mr Childers arrived at Southampton by the West India mail steamer a couple of dayB beforo the opening of Parhamont, having made a burned visit to tho States and West Indies, aftor finishing the work that took him to Canada Amongst the medical students who passed tho required examination a few days ago for the Royal College of Surgeons, England, was Mr Alfred George Buckland, L S A, of Auckland, New Zealand A man named Richard Moxam, residing in a lonely part of the country, near Tullamore Ireland, was found murdered in his house tho week beforo last, and his hoad was crushed with a bill hook Ho lived a vory miserable life, although possessed of some little means. All his family aro in Australia, and tho very morning that his body was dis covered a letter arrived from tho antipodes, containing a remittance Mr Holloway, who has been for some months in New Zealand, whether ho was sent to ascertain tho advantages for emi- gration for agricultural labourers, has re poit.d that it is juBt the country for that class, and that no sober and industrious man who is willing to work neod foar going tr,ore , . ,, , 1 ho Hour, a day or two ago, diow attention to the honours that had boen gained by the Australian wines at the Vienna Exhibi- tion, and referring to Mr Vizitelly s roporr, which it recommended its readers to study for themselves, remarked how proud English- men ought to be of the success tijut had been achieved by our distant dependency, which promised at no distant day to be one of tho most renowned wine growing countries in the world. There is no doubt but that the taste for Australian wine ia spreading, and I may mention also, par parcntlicse that Australian tobacco is coming into vogue, and Bome con- firmed smokers spe ik very highly of it.

Meantime affaira remain very much the same in Louisiana Kellogg still keeps possesBion under the protection of the na tional troops His Legislature remains ra seBBion, but does nothing The White League is as quiet as an association of mice-a result largely duo to the fierce, if reckless, spirit of General Sheridan The treat body of the people ia dis- heartened and gloomy Trade is almost at a standstill The only hope for a re newal of prosperity and peace seems to depend on some compromiso sanctioned by Congress, and arranged between the conten tiouB politicians But that is a frail hope. We have just been witnessing a curious Parliamentary conflict between the "great parties 'n the House of representatives, which, I believe, though it is not very unfre quent here, is never seen in just the same favour elsewhere It is called hero, "filibus tering " I can best give you au idea of the general practice by describing the latest instance The Republicans wished to make a report on what is known as the CivU Rights Bill-a bill to secure to negroes the equal uBO of public conveyances inns, and places of amusement, as well as schools When the motion was made to allow the bill to be reported in the House, a Democrat moved to adjourn On this the calling of the roll was demanded, and in order to see if there was a sufficient number in favour of calling the roll a count of the House was had The roll call being ordered occupied with the count about 10 minutes The House reiused to adjourn Then another Democrat moved that when the House adjourn, it bo till a certain time This like the motion to adjourn, is always in order, and tho same routine was gone through with after which, according to the rules, the motion to adjourn again became in order, and was again made The process of voting and counting on theBe motions alternately can be kept up indefinitely by a respectablo minority until phyaical Blreufclh tives oat lu Ino present ni stance, the Democrats resisted the passage of tho bill for 40 boura continuoua seasion The Republicans then imitated the strategy of their leader during the war Thoy abandoned the direct contest, introduced and passed an amendment to the rules abolishing 1 dilatory motions ' for the remainder of the session, and then passed the bill, thus 'taming the enemy a ilank, and 'com pelling him to retreat." It ia doubtful, however, that the bill can paBS the Senate and receive the signature of the President, although it was stripped of its n oat objectionable feature, by striking out the provision relating to schools It was felt t! at if the white taxpayers in tho South were required by law to keep their schools open to blacks, they would abolish tho schools Politically the passage of the hill by the House ia a blunder of the worst kind. It will cost tho Republicans all the native white strength they have been ablo to acquire in the South, and it will not rotain any negro votes that would havo been lost without it T hero ia no room for doubt that the passage of tho measure was duo to the partisan feeling arouBed by the Louisiana disturb- ances It looks like a parting blow at the rebelB ' The Republicans will not, in all probability, over have the power to ad minister another One fact w Inch makes the prospect moro discouraging for the Republicana ia, that at the last moment thoy find themselves c Jin pelled to levy additional taxes They should havo done so last year, but by using the money that ought to have gone to tho Binkrag fund, they tided over the fore part of the fiscal j ear (which ends hero on the 30th of June) General Grant a new secretary of the Treasury, however, has come to tho sensible and honest conclusion that he will use the revenues first to pay interest, and then to meet tho sinking fund , and if there ia any deficiency, it will fall on the various public improvements now going on Tina touches the CongreBa in a tender apot, for "improvements ' and the expenditures and patronage connected with them aro the stock in trade of the ordinary politician. Accordwtly, a bill for new taxes has been brought in It increases the tax on spirits from 70c to Idol, adds 4c a pound to tho tobacco tax, increases tho tax on importod augar 25 per cent, restores the 10 per cent reduction mado on imports generally threo years ago, and as a tub to the whale, takes off the tax of 2c a box from lucifer matchee Tho not result is an additional rovonuo of about .3 000 OOOdol It will be Been that tho bill is shaped by tho protectionists. These aTe not a majority, I think, but they hold tho "balance of povvor, ' and as, with the Democrats, thoy could overthrow tho bill, their prejudices havo been controlling Otherwise, we should have had tho taxes on tea and oolloo ronn poaed, and tho whisky and tobacco tax alono increased Tho protectionists havo also gainod a signal triumph in tho defeat of the reciprocity treaty with Canada, or moro properly apeak ing, with Groat Britain, concerning the Canadian dominion The Sonate rejectod tho treaty without paying it tho poor com phment of a vote It will probably bo a good while before the measure is renewed But it is worth while remembering that the pro toctionists are moro powerful m seeming than thoy should be in reality if once the country could be enable to vote fairly and distinctly on their notions There aro ouough of thom in each party to exorcise a control which their total strength does not entitle thom to The Bint of Theodore Tilton against the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher for crim. con, is now pending in tho Brooklyn courts, and having just passed the eighth week, bids fair to become a respectable nval to the lieh borne trial in point of length and popular interest The courtroom is crowded every day to suffocation, and the spectators, who are admitted by ticket, but who aro always too many for the room, assemble for hours m the corridors awaiting the opening of tho doors "Tho defendant " appears regularly in court, accompanied by bis wifo and a delega tion of the members of his church, not unfre quently including ladies With his party, too, though perhaps not exactly of it, is Mrs Tilton, who, flanked by the wife of ono of Mr. Beecher's counsel on the one hand, and by a prominent lady member of the Society on the other, Bits day after day before tho jury Hie papers are giving l8 or 20 columns a d ty to the trial, and it is probably a spectacle as disgusting to decent people and as demora lising to the community tenerally, as could well be imagined Hie jury is as stupid as one could ask I stipposo I may say to you, in the hope that tho trial may be finished beforo my letter returns to the United States to discover me guilty of ' contempt of ceurt," that there is no hope that the jury can agree, or, for that matter, that Beochor's guilt or innocence will over bo unequivocally established. Tho evidence in the trial dis closes a very curious condition of opinion and feeling in the society in which the parties to the trial moved A great maBS of letters be- tween rl ilton and his wife has boen laid before tho jury and the public, and they are very curious specimens of the domestic love letter. I ach party seemed to vie with the other m self accusation. Indeed, Mrs Tilton having confessed that she loved Beecher "not wisoly, but too well,' afterwards denies it and explains her confession hy alleging that her husband had acknowledged a similar infidelity, and she did not want to make him feel badly with thinking that she was better than he Tilton, for his part, after he found out, as ho says, his wife s infidelity, did not shoot her alleged para- mour, but forgave bim, as ho thought " Christ would have done " His Christianity, however, did not woar well, and he quar- relled with Beecher, and finally determined to drive him out of Brooklyn. Beecher is not behind his friends m his extraordinary view of what is demanded of human nature in the way of sacrifice. Tilton, as Beecher admita, accused tho latter of making improper advances to his wife, an accusation obviously as fatal to the reputa- tion of a clergyman as one of criminal inter course itself. But Beecher, so far from re- senting it, went to work to hush his accuser and keep him good natured, and advance his worldly interests generally Meanwhile, ac- cording to Tilton's testimony, ho and his wife were accustomed to indulge in pro- tracted ethical discussions as to whether cnm. con. with Mr B was or was not im- moral, and Mr Tilton says that his wife insisted that it was not, that Mr. B. said that it WEB not, and that as Mr B had spent bis whole life m the study of the distinctions between right and wrong, he was a better authority on that subject than Mr Tilton could be This the kind of testimony which the reiorters Bay Mrs Tilton sits in court and listens to with "an ill concealed emile " Of course you can readily behev o that the trial and the reports of it are like a moral poison m tho com. munity. It is, in tho worst senso of the word, a dreadful scandal I havo myself long since come to the conclusion that if all the pal ties to it could be treated to a night's lodging m a close room with a pan of burn- ing charcoal, it would be a great blessing to the public, and possibly to themselves also The stagnation in husmeas to which I have had BO often to refer continues The Beason has come around when it is cus- tomary for tenants to mako a decision con cernmg the houses and stores for anothor year, and it is found that though there has been almost no building for tho past lo months, the demand is less than tho supply, and rents have sensibly fallen. This, of itself, is certainly well enough, for Americans pay extravagant rents It is not unusual for a man to expend 23 or even 33 per cent, of his income for the rent of his house, while 20 to 30 per cent of tho not profits of a business is not an unusual propor- tion to pay for tho rent of a warehouse or Bhop. Yet, thanks to high taxes, and the great cost of laud m cities, as well aa tho trades unions' prices for labour, owners of "real' pronerty do not ordinarily obtain quite the current rate of interest for their investments They would, as a rule, gain more by lending their money on mortgage having, in this way, precisely tho same security-than thoy can get by routing houses and land. Sinco, therefore, the average tenant must reduce his expenses, especially his rent, and since rents do not now pay moro than the average rate of profit, it is plain that the only way out of the dilemma is a "shrinkage in the valuo of real property, and an accompanying fall in the cost of building, especially in the price of labour. This is what is now going on. Among tho ulterior conso quences of this process is a very sharp check to the rapid immigration that ttio United States havo enjoyed so continually. Of course there is much distress everywhere, lut as the country has been spending far beyond its means for a number of years, I know of but one way for it to " got even with tho world," and that is the way opon to in- dividuals as well Whatever consolations there may be, however, m this politico economical way of looking at our preBOnt condition, it is extremely annoying to lose our ppnng season of opera which is what is threatened for us M Mar_t_.t. has lost his beautiful and gifted prima donna, Miss Alhani, and is about to withdraw his an. nouncements for April As this has always been the choicest of the year, our loss will bo considerable.

A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR HUMBUG. The following communication appears in the New York papers - We have had many inquiries as to the name of a mysterious book for which the enormous price of £1,000 is offered by a Mr Golbourne, in London, or a Mr Brown, in New York, and the question seems to have acquired so much importance in the news papers, that we have thought it worth while to say that, in our judgment, the whole story is a sublime humbug or else an obscure method of advertising a "certain book" which has lately been published in this country. We have ascertained that there is no B. R. Brown to be found at No 599 Broad- way, and there is no G. Golbourne, No 35 Duke street, in the London Directory of last year. But we are met this morning with a statement in the newspapers that a certain "Mr Fountain T. Fox," of Louisville, is the fortunate possessor of this precious work. We hops that "Mr Fountain T. Fox" will not on the strength of that forthcoming (?) £1,000 indulge in any riotous living, for the book which is described is nothing more nor less than Memoirs of George the Fourth Descrip- tive of the most interesting scenes of his private and public life with characteristic sketches of all the celebrated men who were his friends ministers and counsellors. By Robert Huish, London , printed by William Clowes, Stamford street, for T Kelly, Pater- noster row , Fisher, Son, and P. Jackson, Newgate street, Jones and Co., Temple of the Muses, 1 Finsbury-square, and G. Virtue, Ivy-lane, 1830." Two vols., 8vo., with por- traits of his court and courtesans. This work was said to have been sup- pressed, but it is by no means rare—we have sold several copies at 10dol (10dol. per set) and will undertake to furnish it to any anxious inquirer at about that figure. The story of George IV and his alleged marriage with Mrs Fitzherbert is all told by Hon. C Langdale in Memoirs of Mrs Fitz- herbert, 8vo. London, 1856—a book which has not been suppressed, and it is surprising that the newspapers should have been so easily led into the discussion of this "hum- bug." Mr. Fox's name and the fact that he has "received a number of despatches," is suggestive of still another sell. We might add that there can be no reason for offering such reward in view of the poli- tical importance of proving the existence of a claimant to the throne of England. Such importance is entirely supposititious; for, from the nature of the "Royal Marriage Act " and law of "Protestant Succession," even an ordinanly regular marriage was illegal under the circumstances, and the issue of any such marriage illegitimate Mrs Fitzherbert was a "subject," and a " Roman Catholic." —J. SABIN & SONS No. 84 Nassau street, Mon- day, February 1, 1875. WRECK OF THE BARQUE AURORA AND LOSS OF EIGHT LIVES. (FROM THE TIMES, FEB. 2 ) Alfred Erridge, boatswain on board the barque Aurora, and others of the survivors have arrived at Poole, where the vessel was owned by Messrs. Ballard and Willis. The men have furnished our correspondent with the following account of the shipwreck. It will be remembered that of a crew of 16 only eight were saved, after enduring terrible privations :—"'The Aurora left Doboy, in Georgia, United States, on the 9th of December, and, considering the time of year, the weather was tolerably fine for the first 20 days. On the 29th of December the cap- tain ordered the vessel to be laid to, owing to the heavy sea then running. On the 31st the Aurora shipped a heavy sea, which washed away her bulwarks and her gallant rail, broke the longboat and washed away the galley. The vessel then commenced leaking very rapidly. On the 1st of January the captain gave orders to run the vessel before the wind, but was obliged to heave-to in the evening owing to the heavy sea. The vessel then lay to for several days, during which time all hands were kept to the pumps. After working some time the windmill pump was choked, and the water gained on the vessel to such an extent as to render pump- ing useless. On the 11th there was a heavy gale of wind from W.N.W., and on the following day the vessel was full of water, and the sea sweeping over her decks The captain tben ordered tho vessel to be again laid to but before this was done a small quantity of provisions and a keg of water wereo taken into the mizen top. While the crew were hauling up the weather clue of the foresail, the vessel turned over and the crew saved themselves by hanging on to the chain plates for half an hour. Heavy seas during this time were breaking over the vessel, and Captain Hore, one seaman, and tho appren- tice were drowned. The masts then gave way, owing to the pressure of water in the sails. This had the effect of righting the vessel, but the starboard rail was washed away. Thirteen of the crew succeeded in getting on board again where they remained from the 12th to the 16th of January (from the Tuesday morning till Saturday) without anything to eat or drink, and, during some part of this time up to their waists in water. On Friday, the 15th, they sighted the Italian barque Nanta, which bore down close to them and endeavoured to render assistance. The sea at this time was running very high and the Nanta's boat was broken in an attempt to get it over the side of the vessel. It was then found impossible to do anything more that day, as darkness was setting in. The captain of the Nanta, however, deter- mined to lay to during the night so as to be ready if possible, to render assistance in the morning. On the morning of the 16th, the Italian captain attached life buoys to lines and threw them overboard, so that any of the Auroras crew who could swim might jump overboard and attempt to catch the lines. This was the only means they had of rendering assistance. Alfred Erridge the boatswain, undressed himself, and was the first to make the attempt, and succeeded in catching the line. Eight others then followed his example, but two of them failed to catch the lines, and were drowned. Two men and a boy who were remaining on board, having seen their shipmates fail in their attempt to save themselves, refused to make the attempt, and as the Aurora broke up soon after this event, it is morally certain that they perished soon after. One of these was an elderly man, who had he made the attempt to save him- self by jumping overboard, must have failed. The sufferings of the crew were very great during the four days they were without pro- visions. The captain and crew of the Nanta were exceedingly kind giving them food and provisions and landed them at Falmouth on Wednesday, the 27th January. CLERGYMEN IN NONCONFOR- MIST CHAPELS. (FROM THE DAILY NEWS, FEB. 5 ) The state of tension which characterises all the ecclesiastical relations of our domestic politics was curiously illustrated in the city of London yesterday. The large building recently erected on the Holborn Viaduct and known as the City Temple, was crowded at noonday by a vast congregation, who were evidently animated by a wish to enter a new protest on behalf of freedom of preaching in the Church of England. A midday service is usually held in the church on Thursday and Dr. Parker, the minister, asked for the co-operation of some clergymen of the Church of England in carrying it on. For some time past an advertisement, which has ap- peared in our own columns has announced that yesterday the Rev. W. H. Fremantle, rector of St Mary's, Bryanston square, would preach on behalf of the building fund and that the religious service would be conducted by various clergy men and ministers. Yester- day morning however, we published letters from Dr. Parker and Mr. Fremantle stating that, legal difficulties having been raised Mr. Fremantle had, at the request of the Bishop of London, postponed the engagement till these difficulties had been cleared up. Dr. Parker in his letter added that, whether at a late hour an arrangement allowing Mr. Fremantle to preach might or might not be come to, at all events he would attend the noonday service and ex- plain why his engagement was not kept. This announcement attracted yesterday a congregation which filled every corner of the great building, and was in some respects representative of what we may describe as the Conformist and Nonconformist wings of the evangelical party Mr. Fremantle was present, occupying the capricious pulpit, to- gether with Dr. Allon, Dr. Staughton, and Dr. Parker, three of the leading Independent ministers in London. After the devotional service had been gone through in a manner which showed that the vast assembly con- sisted of persons thoroughly used to the congregational form of worship, and was no mere chance gathering of the curious, Mr. Fremantle stepped to the front of the pulpit, and in a short speech, characterised by great moderation and good sense, stated his reasons for originally accepting Dr. Parker's invitation and the supposed legal impedi- ment to his doing so, to which the Bishop of London had called his attention three days before, Mr. Fremantle concluded by urging his audience "to remember that the rulers of a great church system, and the admin- istrators of a complicated and antiquated law, have a vast responsibility, in the dis- charge of which they must not be lightly judged ;" and to agitate this question of free- dom of intercommunion as one of capital importance to the whole Christian commu- nity. Dr. Parker then gave his account of the transactions, and of the desire for Chris- tian unity and for healing the divisions of Protestantism in which his invitation to Mr. Fremantle had been given on one side and accepted on the other. No hint was thrown out as to the ecclesiastical law on which the legal proceedings threatened by the Bishop of London were to be based ; but Dr. Parker incidentally stated that they had not originated with the rector of the parish, who had given his consent before Mr. Fremantle was announced to preach. It seems to us that the Bishop of London has not been well advised to raise this ques- tion at this particular time. The law is clear on the point he is under obligation to enforce it ; but if, as is generally allowed, it is doubtful it would have been wiser to give freedom the benefit of the doubt. So long as the parochial system continues it is obvious that the unauthorised intrusion of a clergy- man into the parish of another clergyman is a breach of clerical order and etiquette which should be restrained, but in this case the per- mission of the rector had been asked and re- ceived, so that Mr. Fremantle was not poach- ing on another man's manor. The question raised by the action of the Bishop of London is therefore not that of the relation of the clergy to one another, nor even that of the obedience due from a clergyman to his bishop ; but it is the far wider and more im- portant one of the relation of the Protestant Church as established by law in England to the other Protestant Churches not so esta- blished, but existing and flourishing all around her. In the present state of feeling in this country the tendency of all Protestant bodies to draw nearer to each other is greatly strengthening and the worst disservice which can be done to the Established Church at this crisis is to place that institution in the attitude of absolutely forbidding all union and co-operation. A MISSING SEA CAPTAIN. A correspondent, writing from New York, February 18, to a San Francisco paper, has the following :— A missing sea captain has been announced from time to time coupled with a presump- tion that he may have been murdered, and embellished with a romantic story as to his having two wives, one a perfect shrew and another a perfect angel. It seems that the missing man's name is John W. Mantle, master of the barque Olivia Davis who re- cently arrived at this port from Australia, where in May last he married a young English go- verness who is at present living in Brook- lyn. On the 9th of January last Captain Mantle disappeared from the United States Hotel, and has not since been heard from. Whatever may have been his fate, it is cer- tain that his youngest and deserted wife has been the victim of an ingenious but heartless fraud. Last week she was visited by a young man, representing himself to be a medical student, who, upon making in- quiries informed her that Captain Mantle was an inmate of the Lunatic Asylum at Bellevue, and that he had been picked up while labouring under the influence of drugs that he desired her to come and secure his release and bring with her a change of clothing. The delighted wife at once con- sented, and after packing up the captain best garments, gave them for carriage to the obliging young man, beneath whose guidance she and a lady friend were to visit the island. On reaching 119th street, the guide suddenly remembered that a few dollars were indispensable to defray ex- penses. A 10dol. bill obviated that difficulty, when fashioning an excuse, the youth de- parted in the direction of the East River, carrying with him clothing and money, with no Captain Mantle to be found on the island. PRINCE BISMARCK The following telegram dated Paris, Feb- ruary 3, was published in The Times of the following day :—"Prince Bismarck, according to the Cologne Gazette, is suffering from a nervous affection, which probably accounts for the Reichstag having been closed by Kerr Delbruck. The pressure of his multifarious duties, his zealously-pursued ecclesiastical policym the animosity displayed by the Ultra- montane papers, the expressions of which render the attacks on his life quite intel- ligible, cannot be expected to soothe ex- citable nerves. The president of police has admonished him to take precautions for his personal safety, and it is believed that sen- tries are stationed in his house. It is rumoured in the Upper House that soon after his 60th birthday, on the 1st of April, he intends to retire. He is understood to have remarked that it happens in public life between states- men and their contemporaries as with a guardian whose ward outgrows his services. His physician has told him that with continued labour and excitement his health will only last a few years ; whereas, with a quiet life and by husbanding his strength he could long enjoy an agree- able existence, and he does not see why he should not prefer the latter. The Cologne Gazette considers it quite natural that such ideas should sometimes arise in his mind, but thinks they will pass away at the thought of duty and country. He knows that Germany cannot spare him, and that he is not yet in a position to offer it a substitute." NOVEL VOYAGE ON THE THAMES. (FROM THE DAILY NEWS). Captain Boyton, the young American, whose wonderful life preserving dress we recently described as being successfully ex- hibited in the Serpentine astonished some thousands of persons on Saturday, February 6, by floating from Wappmg to Vauxhall in his waterproof suit. It may be safely said that never before was old Father Thames so defied and set at nought by mortal ; its depths had no terrors to the man who fearlessly committed himself to them, and its yellow tide no power to resist his advance or check his progress. The spectacle of a person calmly lying at ease, and buoyant as a sea bird upon the surface of the river, or, by way of change, standing armpit-deep in it with many fathoms be- neath his feet and moving hither and thither at will, naturally attracted the attention of all the sailors on board the ships and all the spectators on the bridges and to these Cap- tain Boyton gave in addition to a novel entertainment, a valuable lesson in life pre- servation. By a most simple contrivance sea- going people may now take a new lease of life. The stars and stripes fluttering at the feet of the floater, on Saturday, called atten- tion to the true nature of the long black object that kept the centre of the silent high- way, while the perfect success of the experi- ment must have put new ideas into many pondering minds as to what is possible where hitherto impossibilities only have been admitted. Captain Boy- ton started with a flood tide from Wapping Old Stairs—not the modern broad flight of steps used by these latter day wherries, but the narrow old fashioned blocks of stone which still remain to show where the jolly young waterman of the past was wont to take the fine city ladies on board. All the begrimed lighters moored thereabouts were crowded with workmen, just arrived from the yards and shops on the other side and the bargees and watermen, young and old, looked on open mouthed at the gentle- man who encasing himself in an armour of india-rubber walked into and along the river without touching the bottom ;who could not sink lower than his breast had he tried ever so hard to do it and who by the aid of a light double-bladed canoe paddle set off on his journey, followed by a fleet of boats, and loudly cheered by the amazed and delighted spectators. Blowing his foghorn or whistle, using his axe, smoking his cigar, and waving his banner, his voyage was quite a triumphal water progress, and the voyageur seemed to take a special delight in threading his way amongst shipping and boats, and taking the arches where the current was most dangerous. Once or twice he purposely allowed himself to foul a barge or the buttress of a bridge, in one instance shooting like an arrow under the stern, and between two boats towing behind. Easy it was to see that, clad in one of these suites, a man may venture where a boat could never go, and perform services of the highest advantage to humanity. It would be too much, doubtless to expect that every emigrant and sailor should, at present possess such a splendid life preserver, or that possessing it, destruction would be invariably averted. The most dreaded cause of mischief in times of disaster at sea is now, as it has ever been panic, and there is un- fortunately no possible invention that will guarantee as against that. Boyton's life preserving dress may be donned in two minutes by a cool hand, and by any one, so simple is the contrivance, but the essence of success is that it shall be thoroughly fastened and inflated. At first the wearer of the dress is oppressed with a sense of suffocation, but this soon wears off, and there is no danger from cold or wet so long as the suit is intact. By the use of rockets and signal lights Captain Boyton, as he travelled along by Westminster, now floating, and now in the upright half- submerged position which is the only alterna- tive, showed how lines might be conveyed to ships in distress. On the whole, the uses of Captain Boyton'a dress are practically bound- less, and the voyage from Wapping on Satur- day to Lambeth, performed with ease and in spite of stoppages under an hour and a half, told to thousands of spectators a story of cheering hope in the future for all who go down to the sea in ships, and do business in mighty waters. DISTURBANCE AT A CHURCH. (FROM THE PALL MALL GAZETTE, FEB. 6.) A disturbance has occurred at the village of Cowley, near Oxford, in consequence of the vicar of the parish, the Rev. J. Coley, refusing to bury a man named Frederick Merritt, on the ground that the deceased had led a notorious life. After the children's ser- vice on Sunday afternoon the sons and brother of Merritt went to the church to ask Mr. Coley to allow another clergyman to officiate, but he refused to see them and locked himself in the church for about two hours, until a policeman arrived. In the meantime several hundred per- sons assembled round the church and hooted Mr Coley, and when he left in com- pany of a policeman, the crowd followed him, hooting and yelling, to his house at Oxford. The bishop having been appealed to, his lordship ordered Mr Coley either to bury the body or find some one else to do it, and the parish authorities served a notice upon the family of the deceased to have him buried at once under threat of proceedings. The vicar then wrote to the widow of Merritt, saying that having been informed of the state of mind of her husband during his last illness, he would consent to the burial, and that had he been told of it before he would not have refused. He still however, refused to allow the body to be taken into the church and declined himself to officiate. The funeral took place on Wednesday, 11 days after the man's death, the Rev. Mr. Green of Littlemore, officiating. A crowd of about 1,000 persons were present to witness the ceremony, and the vicar having in accordance with his re- fusal to admit the body within the church, caused the doors to be locked, they obtained entrance through a side door, broke open the main door, and insisted upon the body being carried inside the church, where the cus- tomary service was then read. The crowd quietly dispersed after the ceremony, having thanked Mr Green ; and, the sexton refusing to do his work, some labourers filled up the grave. OLIVER CROMWELL'S HEAD. (FROM THE TIMES, JAN.23.) A correspondent draws our attention to a strong corroboration of the main incidents of the story lately told in these columns respecting the head of the Lord Protector Cromwell, to be found in the "Fifty Years' Recollections, Literary and Personal," of the late Mr Cyrus Redding and resting on the authority of Horace Smith, one of the authors of "Rejected Addresses," &c.; Red- ding writes under date about 1821 or 1822:— " Horace Smith was acquainted with a medical gentleman who had in his possession the head of Oliver Crom- well, and in order to gratify my curiosity he gave me a note (of introduction) to him. There accompanied the head a memorandum relating to its history. It had been torn from the tomb with the heads of Ireton and Bradshaw after the accession of Charles II., under a feeling of impotent vengeance. All three were fixed over the entrance of West- minster hall, the other bones of those three distinguished men being interred at Tyburn under the gibbet—an act well befitting the Stuart character. During a stormy night," he adds, "the head in the centre, that of Cromwell, fell to the ground. The sentry on guard beneath having a natural respect for an heroic soldier, no matter of what party took up the head and placed it under his cloak until he went off duty. He then carried it to the Russells, who were the nearest relations of Cromwell's family, and disposed of it to them. It belonged to a lady, a descendant of the Cromwells, who did not like to keep it in her house. There was a written minute extant along with it. The disappearance of the head (off Westminster hall) is mentioned in some of the publica- tions of the time. It had been carefully em- balmed, as Cromwell's body is known to have been two years before its disinter- ment. The nostrils were filled with a sutstance like cotton. The brain had been extracted by dividing the scalp. The membranes within weore per- fect, but dried up and looked like parch- ment. The decapitation had evidently been performed after death, as the state of the flesh over the vertebrae of the neck plainly showed it was hacked, and the severance had evidently been done by a hand not used to the work, for there were several other cuts beside that which actually separated the bone. The beard, of a chesnut colour, seemed to have grown after death. An ashen pole, pointed with iron, had re- ceived the head clumsily impaled upon its point, which came out an inch or so above the crown, rusty and time worn. The wood of the staff and the skin itself had been perforated by the common wood worm. I wrote to Horace Smith that I had seen the head, and deemed it genuine Smith replied, "I am gratified that you were pleased with Cromwell's head, as I was when I saw it, being fully persuaded of its identity.' "It remains, then, on record that two persons, both men of the world and of large ex- perience, and yet so different from each other in character as Horace Smith and Cyrus Redding were satisfied with the evidence brought before them to prove its being genuine nearly 50 years ago. A WONDERFUL AUTOMATON. (FROM THE ENGINEER, JAN 22) Automaton figures, imitating by mecha- nism the movements of life, have been marvels of invention in many ages. In the old classic times, one most wonderful automaton was the flying pigeon made by Archytas, of Tarentum. Another was the walking statue of Doedalus. In the middle ages there was the speaking head of brass, made by Pope Sylvester. There was the moving and speaking head of Albertus Magnus. There was the mechanical fly of Bishop Virgilius. In later times the most wonderful automaton in the world was at one period, the flying eagle of Johann Muller, or the crawling steel fly of the same mechanician, at another period, the artificial man of Reysolius, and, at another, the miniature chariot, horses, lady, and suite of Mona Camus. In the last century the greatest wonders in this class of mechanism were Vaucanson's automaton flute player, which performed with correctness of execu- tion and with clear good tones, certain airs which it was constructed to play, and Vaucanson's automaton duck, which preened its wings, quacked, ate, drank, and digested its food. Late in the last and early in the present century, the most wonderful auto- maton was Kempelen's famous chess-player, which was apparently intelligent, so that it could move any of the pieces at will and in any way, according to the play of the ad- versary, a very different thing from simply executing a series of motions for which the machinery is purposely arranged. However, that automaton turned out to be a deception and the playing was really accomplished by a man inside— a Polish patriot named Wourousky, who, having lost both his legs in battle, was thus enabled to conceal himself in different parts of the figure while the mechanism was being examined by the public. Another wonder was the Invisible Girl of Mons. Charles, in which questions were heard and answered through trum- pets, apparently suspended out of any communication with a living person. Another was the writing and draw- ing automaton of Mons. Maillardet , another, the marvellous little piping bull- finch, constructed by the same inventor and another was the automaton peacock of Le Droz. The French conjuror, Mons. Robert Houdin, made an automaton harle- quin which performed antics in and out of a small box, blew a whistle, and smoked a cigarette. Professor Pepper constructed at the Polytechnic Institution, an automaton Leotard, which tumbled and postured upon a swinging trapeze. A conjuror named Beaumont improved upon this by making a large doll vault upon a swinging rope, and after hold- ing by its hands, disengage them from the rope without assistance, and then hang by its feet. The latest wonder of this kind is an automaton card player, tho joint inven- tion of Mr John Nevil Maskolyne and Mr. John Algernon Clarke, brought out in "Maskelyne and Cooke's Entertainment" at the Egyptian Hall in London. This figure, representing a man in Oriental cos- tume, seated cross legged upon a small pedestal, with cards arranged in front of it, plays whist and other games, itself choosing and taking up with its thumb and finger any card it intends to play. It also tells any card selected out of a pack by the audience ; replies to ques- tions by striking a bell ; obeys by its move- ments the direction of any person in the audience ; can instantly show any colour called for by any person present ; can work any sum in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, and in short execute an extraordinary number and variety of feats, evidently demanding intelli- gence as well as complicated and ingenious mechanism. The peculiar feature of this automaton is, that it apparently effects all this without the possibility of its receiving any assistance or guidance from without. It is supported upon a single piece of thin transparent glass, and persons from the audience may stand all round it while it is at work, and may see inside the body of the figure and the pedestal. SHOCKING ACCIDENT ON THE TYNE. LOSS OF NINE LIVES. The following was telegraphed to the Lon- don papers on January 4 :— To-day a fearful accident occurred on the River Tyne, near Blaydon, by which nine lives were lost, and a large number of per- sons narrowly escaped drowning. During the frost which has prevailed for the past fort- night the river in its higher reaches has been completely frozen over, and the thaw having set in on Saturday morning, the stream has been covered since that time with floating blocks of ice. All dey on Sunday these great masses of ice came down the river, com- pletely blocking up the channel between Newcastle and the sea, and preventing all traffic. To-day the river was very much flooded with the water which ran from the hills into the north and south Tyne, and not only ice, but hewn timber, fences, and in some cases sheep which had been drowned in the flood, were washed down the stream with fearful velocity. About 4 o'clock in the afternoon a number of labourers returning from work entered a wherry near the brick- works of Mr Joseph Cowen, M.P., and pro- ceeded to cross the river to Leamington Point where they resided. They had much difficulty in making any headway at all from the shore in consequence of the great rush of water, but they persisted in their efforts. When, however, the boat had nearly reached the middle of the stream, it was caught by a huge piece of ice which completely over- turned it, and the whole of the men, 11 in number, were thrown into the water. The accident was witnessed by many persons on the shore, and several wherrymen at once put off to their rescue. The poor fellows were soon scattered by the rapid flow of the water, and before assistance could reach them nine of them had dis- appeared beneath the ice. The boatmen who had put off to help them succeeded in rescu- ing five, who contrived to keep themselves above the surface by clinging to blocks of ice and floating trees, but in effecting this they narrowly escaped losing their own lives, for on four or five occasions their boats were nearly overturned, and it was only by con- siderable dexterity that they managed to land the survivors. They were very much exhausted by their immersion, and some of them were cut and bruised by the ice being driven into collision with them. In conse- quence of the swollen state of the stream it was not possible to drag the river for the drowned men. The men were labourers employed by the River Tyne Commis- sioners, and were crossing from their work on an island in the middle of the river, to their homes. The following is a list of the drowned :—Joseph Liddell, aged 29, living at Swalwell, married and leaves two children , Patrick Curly, Blaydon, 25, single man, Thomas Hewison, 14, Blaydon, William Gibson 20 Winlaton, married, but no family : William Coleman, 28, Swalwell, married, and three children , Anthony Kent, 60 Blaydon, single, George Mace, 29, Blay- don, widower, with three children Reuben Ayre, 30, Blaydon, single ; Thomas Daley, 15, Blaydon. The names of those saved were :— William Darby, John Prockter Thomas Mur- ray, William Robson, and William Fenney (a boy). WHY THE CHAMELEON CHANGES COLOUR. At the meeting of the Societé de Biologie of Paris, recently, M Paul Bert discussed the cause and mechanism of the changes of colour in the chameleon. The animal is normally of a dark bottle green colour, which changes to pale green and then to very pale yellow. The causes of these changes of colour should, he said be sought for in the nervous system exclusively. If the sciatic nerves of the left side of the chameleon be cut, the side on which the division is made will take on the darkest shade of green, whilst the other side will become lighter. The nerves to which the changes of colour should be referred take their rise directly from the encephalon, and follow the same direction as the motor nerves, for if the chameleon be poisoned with curare it becomes black, and if it be chloro- formed it becomes lighter in tint, whilst if the experiment be carried further and it be killed with the latter anaesthetic, it then turns black. By taking away the two halves of the encephalon and leaving the nucleus the animal changes colour and becomes very dark. If, on the contrary, one hemisphere of the encephalon be left, the chameleon re- mains light coloured on one side, while the other becomes darkened. It is therefore evi- dent that there exists what may be termed colouring nerves setting out from the nucleus of the encephalon, the two hemi- spheres of which are destined to moderate the nerve action, and to give a greater or less intensity to the tints of the cha- meleon The mechanism of these changes has been thus explained by MM Milne Ed- wards and Pouchet. Under the skin, and communicating with it are vessels filled with a pigment coursing through little canals which intersect cross, and interlace each other in all directions at the back of the epidermis itself. This pigment is afterwards drawn back into the vesicles by the volition of the animal, and the chameleon then takes on a pale tint produced by a pale yellow tissue visible by its transparency. M Paul Bert has also noticed that light excites the colour of the chameleon Thus, if the animal be disturbed in his sleep during the night the side illumined by the light becomes pale, whilst the other side remains dark. This influence of light and its power in exciting these changes of colour in the chameleon require elucidation, and may prove to be a starting-point for interesting researches in general physiology. SNOW SLIDES IN UTAH. A miner in Utah writes to an eastern paper, under date of Jan 10 and gives an interesting account of snow slides and their disastrous effects He says :— In one of our mining camps, known as "Big Cottonwood," the mountain peaks loom up to the height of from 11,000ft. to 12,000ft., and during the winter the snow storms rage incessantly. Consequently the camp is subjected to the most terrible snow slides. One of those storms was of the most fearful character, not a little fall of snow of 6in. or 8in. during a night, but that many feet, with the wind howling, and drifting the snow in every direction. There are places up there where the snow is probably over 40ft. deep. These avalanches are caused by the wind sweeping up on one side of the mountain, and forming a large drift just over the ridge on the opposite side which soon becomes too heavy, and, detaching itself, plunges down the mountain, increasing in size until a moving mass of snow, covering acres and 10ft to 40ft thick sweeps with the rapidity of lightning down into the canons, carrying every thing before it. No soft snow, but packed and jammed together so solid that the moment the mass stops, heavily loaded ore teams can be driven anywhere on top of it, the horses' shoes only making an impression. One of these slides swept over a mine called the Anna last Tuesday, killing four men. The mine was working six men on eight hour shifts which necessarily kept two men at work while four were either sleeping or resting. Their cabin, or boarding house, immediately in front of the tunnel they were running was built very strong and considered safe from slides At 12 o'clock at night the shifts were changed, and the two men whose duty came on left two of the men in the house asleep and the other two sitting up at the fire. One had com- menced writing a letter and the other was sitting on a stool smoking his pipe. The two men had just reached the face (or back end of the tunnel, which was in a distance of 400ft.) and one had raised the sledge to strike the drill when they heard the roar of the slide. They ran back to the mouth, which the slide had run over, leaving it filled with about 5ft of snow, which they had to dig through, and on getting out found nothing in sight. The house was swept away completely. They raised an alarm as soon as possible, and getting word up to the mine called the Prince of Wales, which was run- ning about 100 hands, they all turned out and commenced digging for the house, which was not found until late the next morning. It had been carried down the mountain about 2,000ft., with about 30ft. of snow on top of it. The four men inside were found just as the other two had left them. The snow had broken through the roof, and had enveloped them so suddenly that they had not moved. They were not bruised in any way, but had been suffocated. The man sat there at the table in the act of writing, the inkstand not even having tipped over but the man smoking had probably heard it coming one second before he was struck, as his pipe lay between his feet. There they sat molded in the snow looking as natural as if alive. The two men in bed lay with the blankets over them as smoothly as if just spread. The men who helped to dig them out and who brought the bodies into the city said that by the looks of the men they couldn't have awakened at all. The slides have started in early this year. There have been seven men killed within the last two weeks and a number of animals but the camp for snow slides is Little Cottonwood at which place a couple of winters ago an avalanche came down killing 13 men and some 39 odd animals. A rumour is in circu- lation this evening that another had hap- pened at the same place killing six men. PROTECTED INDUSTRIES (FROM THE GLOBE, JAN. 12) Some of the principles of political economy have by this time become axiomatic amongst us The old fallacies have been exploded so often and so successfully that they do not re- appear. We should not now think of pro- tective legislation or of forbidding imports from foreign countries in order to promote the production of the same commodities at home. We recognise the general principle that the true interests of commerce require each country to barter rather than to produce for herself and a sound economy decrees that every nation shall devote its capital and labour to push its natural trade and not to develop abnormal manufactures. Thus it is possible that we could introduce into England the silkworm and at a greater cost produce an inferior class of silk ; but we recognise the true policy which confines our operations to the manufacture of cotton and leaves to France the industry in which that country most excels. An exception to this general rule has however just been afforded in the case of an entirely exceptional country. A very short time ago Russia did not possess a single mile of railroad with the exception of the little line of St Petersburg Tsarkoé. But when the Grand Russian Railway Company was established a question came to be eagerly debated—How were the rails for making the railway to be obtained ? Russia was rich in iron mines but then she had no factories, no appliances, no knowledge of the manufacture. It was conceded that iron rails would be better made in England and could be imported at about a quarter the price of their home manufacture. In England we should have let the ordinary economic laws prevail. Russia is however governed in a very different way. If Peter the Great established a fleet in a country which had scarcely any available seaboard why should not his successor force iron manufac- tories within his dominions ? This was the reasoning of the Emperor and the Grand Duke 16 years ago. The iron mines of Siberia were worked vigorously. Factories were erected throughout the country and Russia was able to produce not only its own lines of railway but its own locomo- tives. Only the other day the great factory of Kolomna delivered over to one of the companies its 200th engine. The fact has been noticed triumphantly in the Moscow papers. It does not follow that the occasion is one of triumph. Two hundred locomotives have been built at the admitted cost of 800. So much capital has been not merely unproductive but wasted. It has been withdrawn from sources where it would have produced its 50 or 100 per cent.; it has been devoted to a manufacture which yields a loss of 75 per cent. The Moscovians point triumphantly to their Russian rails and Russian locomotives. The retort is very simple. If they had dealt with Germany or England they would have had four times as many miles of railway and four times as much rolling stock. MISCELLANEOUS. Mr Gladstone, having received a copy of a resolution passed by the Greenwich Liberal Association, expressing regret at his retire- ment, and a hope that he will long continue to take part in political life, has written a letter in reply, in which he acknowledges the indulgence shown towards him by his con- stituents, and says -"I owe marked ac- knowledgements to the constituency and to the public generally for their pardon granted to deficiencies, and for their appreciation of efforts limited, I can truly say, only by my strength. Perhaps I may be permitted, without impropriety, to use this letter as a vehicle for extending my expression of gratitude to the numerous and generous friends in different parts of the country who on the present occasion have testified to me their kindly sentiments. It would not be suitable that I should parade before each of the bodies to which I refer the sentiments awakened by their goodness but they may rest assured that it is highly valued, and that it will ever be remembered. " At the Guildhall on January 29 Mr Henry Freeman, the publisher of the World news- paper was summoned before Sir Thomas Gabriel on the charge of having published a malicious and defamatory libel of and con- cerning Messrs Henry Beyfus and Albert Boss that newspaper on the 29th Decem- ber last. Mr Williams who appeared for the complainants, said that the present pro- secution would be withdrawn if the names of the writer of the articles and the editor of the newspaper were given up. He then read the several articles complained of, and said the complainants did not object to the defendant calling them money-lenders or bill-discounters as he did, but they objected to being classed with men who had been bank- rupt and insolvent and had been convicted before the matistrates. Mr Albert Boss was called and said that he was in partnership with Mr Henry Beyfus, at 7 Sackville-street. They carried on business as bill discounters and diamond merchants. In answer to Mr. Lewis by whom he was cross examined on behalf of the defendant, he said he did not know the age of the youngest person to whom he had lent money, but thought it was about 20 years. He charged interest according to the risk he ran. He had not charged 100 per cent., but he had 70 and 60 per cent. He had lent money to a lady twice when she was introduced by her son. He lent money to Lord Albert Clinton on the security of his sister at 60 per cent, and he was sorry for it. He charged 1s. 3d. in the pound per month interest on overdue bills. His hearing of the case extended over several days, and it was ultimately dis- missed. The Chapter of Paderborn having boen summoned by the Prussian Government to elect a successor to the deposed bishop, have definitely declined, on the ground that that would be committing a grievous wrong to Monsignor Martin, who was appointed to the bishopric by the Holy Ghost, and at the same time excluding themselves from the Catholic Church by violation of its laws. The Chillingham, a large sailing vessel of Newcastle on Tyne, which left Philadelphia for England on the 16th of November, has not since been heard of, and is believed to have been lost. A name-board has been picked up at sea, which is thought to have belonged to her. She was commanded by Mr Thomas Beer, of Rectory square, Stepney, and carried a crew of 15 hands. A board of trade inquiry into the loss of the schooner Fanny in Tramore Bay resulted in a decision that the vessel had been lost through the negligence and drunkenness of the captain, and the suspension of his certi- ficate for three years. Two German sailors have been stabbed at Santander, and one of them is dead. A demand is said to have been received at Madrid for an investigation. The Berlin Post of February 8 publishes advices from Vienna, according to which Archduke Johann Salvator, of Tuscany, has been ordered to undergo arrest in his own house, on account of a pamphlet published by him on the organisation of the Austrian artillery. A railway collision of a very destructive character took place near Sheffield on Sunday, February 31. A special goods tram from Ard- wick to Sheffield was standing at the Oughta- bridge Station when it was run into by a second goods train proceeding from Dunford bridge to Sheffield, doing damage to the ex- tent of £3,000. Fortunately, no one was in- jured. Another jewel robbery is reported. The country house of Lord Ellenborough at Holly Springs, Berkshire, has been entered by burglars, who secured a large quantity of jewellery, watches, and other articles, and got safely off. The Queen Dowager of Bavaria, who re- cently joined the Roman Catholic Church, has ordered the construction at her own expense of a new Catholic Church at Munich, which will cost 340 000 marks (£17,000). The municipal council of Munich had refused previously to construct the church, as the town has already quite sufficient church ac- commodation. Captain Alexander West, a retired naval officer, was on Monday (February 1) found lying dead on the roadside, at St. Helier's, not far from his own residence, having shot himself in the head with a revolver. He had been for some time past in a very desponding state of mind in consequence of his having invested large sums in the shares of the Jersey Eastern Railway, which he feared would turn out unproductive. A bad case of hydrophobia is reported from Preston. A man named William Hodge, after returning home from work a few even- ings ago, complained of a severe pain in his right arm. A surgeon, who was called in having noticed a peculiar mark on the arm, suspected that the man had at some time been bitten by a dog. His fears were verified next day, when Hodge went raving mad, fell into convulsions, and foamed at the mouth. He was removed to the infirmary with great difficulty two or three strong men being scarcely able to restrain him, and died in great agony on January 30. The inquest on the bodies of the seven persons killed by the boiler explosion at the works of Messrs Lord Brothers, machinists, Todmorden on the 21st January was concluded on February 1. The jury found that the explosion was caused by the extensive corrosion and grooving of the plates of the boiler and that there was an error of judgment on the part of Edmund Woodhead the engineman in charge which led him to believe and to report to the Messrs. Lord that the boiler was in safe working order and they recommended that there be Government inspectors of all steam boilers.

The 10th annual meeting of this company was held at the offices, 50 Old Broad- street, on February 4. Mr A. J Mundella, M P., was in the chair The annual report (which was published in The Argus of March 11) was presented to the meeting. In moving the adoption of the report, the Chairman said that the same pleasant fea- tures now characterised this company's operations which had hitherto marked its continued and unbroken success. In their report last year the directors stated to the shareholders that the profits made during the year 1873 were to some extent excep- tional. They were then accordingly enabled to recommend a dividend with bonus at the rate of 12½ per cent. per annum, and the addition of £22,000 to the reserve fund. To-day they proposed to pay a dividend and bonus at the same rate and to add £10,000 to the reserve fund. Looking to the low rates of money which have prevailed in the colonies during the last 12 months, he had hardly expected the result of the past year's operations to be so satisfactory as those presented in the report. The drawback, how- ever which he had mentioned, was fully met by the increase in the prosperity of the com- pany, and the firmness of the hold which it had on the colony of New Zealand. The wool consignments of the company had been largely augmented during the year 1874, and were much greater than during any pre- vious year of its existence. He was happy to say that in the list of wool im- porters, this company, as consignees stood highest for the colony of New Zealand, and third for the Australasian and Cape colonies. Considering the short period of its existence, the confidence acquired by the company in New Zealand was most gratify- ing. He did not think there was any cause to doubt a maintenance of their success in the future. They had every reason to believe that the colony of New Zealand would continue to flourish, and according as railway works and immigration were extended, so would the resources of that colony be further developed. With a view to meet the increased facilities for the investment of money in the colonies it was proposed to equalise the old and new issues of the com- pany's shares. In the wisdom of this course he felt sure that the shareholders would agree with the directors. After the payment of the call of 30s. per share to be made on the latter, formal notice of which would be sent to each shareholder, the paid up capital of the company would be upwards of £115,000, and the reserve fund would be £72,000. Confidently believing in their ability to declare next year a dividend on a par with the highest hitherto paid, he begged formally to move the adoption of the report and statement of accounts. The motion was seconded by Mr Porter, and carried unanimously. The Chairman then moved that a dividend at 10 per cent. per annum for the half year ended Decomber 31st 1871, with a bonus of 2½ per cent. for the year, be now declared, which, with the interim dividend at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum paid in July, 1874, will make a distribution at the rate of 12½ per cent. per annum for that year, that £10,000 be added to the reserve fund, thereby raising it to £72,000, and that the balance of profit, £1,528 19s 10d., be carried forward. This was also carried. SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE. ARRIVALS. Abergeldie, at Gravesend 7th February, from Syd- ney. Ben Nevis, at Gravesend 3rd February, from Mel- bourne.
