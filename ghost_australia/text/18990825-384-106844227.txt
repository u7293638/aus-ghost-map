Ghosts in the Kitchen. " There are ghosts in the kitchen, sir,', was the extraordinary announcement made by a cook last night to her master, just as he was sitting down to dinner. The woman, pale " with fright, nearly dropped the soup which she was bringing to the table. Her master, a tradesman in the Rue du Bac, wondering what was the matter, walked with his cowering cook to the kitchen, and there saw to his astonishment that the chairs and tables were violently oscillating, the cupboards were also shaking, until it seemed as if the spirits had really taken possession of the kitchen in order to hold a seance there. The tradesman then returned to the dining-room amazed, and hardly had he resumed his seat when the chairs, tables; sideboard, and in fact all the furniture ,began to vibrate around him. He immediately surmised that the whole house w._vas conung down, so he rushed out to consult -one of Iiis nei-hbors, who is an architect. The latter returned with hint to the dwelling, and :found that it wa-s gradually coming down. The poliee were then communicated with, andi the tottering habitation was cleared of all its "inmates. This morning props were put up to. support the house. which is one of the oldest in th4 district.-Daily Telegraph's Paris cor respondent.
