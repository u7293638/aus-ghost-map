A SURE PROOF. One of the " James gang," as the hand ef robbers were called who for a few years previous to 1881 had committed numerous crimes in the State of Missouri, was on trial ;for participation in what was known as the " Gleudale train robbery." Mrs , a witness for the State, testified that on the night before the robbery occurred she saw .the prisoner, and heard him talking to her husband about the proposed robbery. Upon her cross-examination the following dialogue took place: " Now, Mrs —, tell us again how you happened to see the prisoner upon the ■evening in question." " He come to the house 'long in the fust part of the evenin', an* asked me where was my old man. I said ont-doors someers, an' he went ont to find him. Bime-by I 'lowed I'd better see if he'd found him ; :an' when I got ont-doors I heerd voices in the corn patch, an' I went along kinder still like, an' looked throngh the fence. I was a couple o' fence corners from 'em. 'Twas light as day, 'most." " Ton saw them distinctly ?" "Yaas." " Well, Mrs ■, I want to know if you believe in ghosts—in spooks." Waal, I don' know as if s any o' your business what I believe." " Ton must answer the question," said the judge. " Waal, then I do. I've seen W " Tour house is said to be haunted, isn't it?" " Yaas." "And ghosts have been seen walking aboutoutside by yourself andyour family ?" " Yaas." " I thought so. Now can you swear that it wasn't ghosts that yon saw and heard out in the cornfield that evening ?' . " Yaas, 1 can." " Well, how do you know ?" "'Cause they war a-cussin. I've seen an' heerd ghosts, but never ghosts as cuss."
