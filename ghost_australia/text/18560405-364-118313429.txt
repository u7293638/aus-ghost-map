TIHE DEATH OF THE COUNCIL. (From the Melbourne Argus, March20.) To-DAY the present Council meets for thle lost time for the despatch of busi ness, and as hlonourable members file out of the chamber tlhant has so often resounded to the eloquence of some, and the discordant shrieks with which otl.ers have made both nighlt anld dlay hideous, not a tfew exclaim with Wolsey- Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness. We will not on suclh an occasions invi diously mention tihe names of those whose exile into private litb reconciles us to the loss of others, but altogetlher the dissolution is certainly matter for congratulation. The Council Ihns out livedl public respect and public lpatience, not so miuchl because its career has been other than creditable, as because the feeling has become universal that its stroctu'ois such as to mnake it not a fit Parliament for this colony at this time. Widely different, indeed, are time feel ings withll which it was regarded at its birth fiiom those which smuround its deathbed. Then we were jubilant at having' seccured the great boon of sePar ation,indl tihe riglht to mhnage our own aflhirs, eveon with a mongrel seoni-nom inee semi-representative Council. But during the few short years of its exist ence the whole aspect of society ha:ls undtergone a change. .. . Let us not speak or think unkindlv, however, of the curious oll creaturo as it lies dying. Let us hopei tlit the Parliament lwhich is to be hereafter, will be as much in advance of that whlich no is giving up the ghost as the co'ony of Victoria is in advance of the Port Phillip district. In the mean tinme as we, not reluctantly, it must be ownedl, bid honourable mr?embcrs good bye, we Ihertily and sincerely tlhank them for their past services.
