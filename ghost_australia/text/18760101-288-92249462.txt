James JefferiB recently delivered a lecture in Melbourne on. 'The Victoriesof Labor/' The Argus, in a leading article on the -subject, says:—' It is ~so rarely that a muuster of religion has the courage to denounce that mafignant form of impiety and atheism known as protection that a special acknowledgment is due to the Rev. J. Jefferis, of Adelaide, for, his outspokenness on that subject, and it was a curious illustration of the, Irony of fate' that the Chairman oh that occasion iwas the Treasurer of the Administration to which ,we are* indebted for the1 introduction of fen evil which it may take half the lifetime of a ?genera^ tlon to eradicate. The question of free tirade is 3one which- comes so clearly within the domain «f religion and morals' that its exclusion from the pulpit is only to be 'accounted for, we imagine, by the fear which : a good many preachers under the voluntary system maybe sappesed to entertain of offending the prejudices of the more ignorant members of their congregations. Leaked at from the theo logical stand-point, as well ' as from the social and economic one, unrestricted freedom of exchange is as much a. law of nature as gravitation' or chemical affinity or , molecular cohesion. The abundant and diver sified gifts of the Creator are so distributed over the surface' of the globe as, to invite and impel their beneficial Interchange. Every country within the temperate and tropical zones produces certain articles greatly Jn excess, of the wants :of its inhabitants, which are at the 'same time eagerly sought for by the people of o 'her latitndes. In some regions the superabundance of these products is found above the soil, and in others beneath it. Where the- Matter is the casej a nation applies itself chiefly to manufactures, and with the overplus of thereBults' of its industry it is enabled 4* purchase some of the overplus of the natural produce of distant countries. . To effect this exchange vessels must be built and manned, .ports and harbors must be constructed, and a distinct class of persons set apart for the pur- , pose of collecting, forwarding, and distributing sucli commodities ; and thus new employments are' created, the ?, satisfaction of new wants has -to be provided for, and the circle of human activity undergoes incessant .enlargement;'., ; There is now on riew at 67, Bundle street, a cblleotion of instruments of torture and old weapons that is in*eresting to antiqua lianfe, and also to all those who -desire to deepen their impressions of the refined cruelty that was practised in 'olden times oa persons Who dared to profess non-belief in the received religious tenets of the majority of people. The instruments were certainly de ^igQed with great skill, and the workmanship is in most cases very superior. . The diabolical purposes to which they were applied, however* show the fiendish nature of those who invented and used them. A. feeling of disgust naturally rises in the mind of any one viewing such' horrible things as the '** mouth-pear, ' which was' . used to prevent accused persons \ from cryjag out This was put into the mouth, and by a screw' could be expanded to 'such a way. as to crack the jawbones... The Spanish, or iron. virgin,, an instarumenc of torture made to, embrace a victim, and to it flic t the most dreadr falrtorture; ths scourges, double waist-rings, thumb scjrew, and other articles too numerous to mention in detail, form part of the exhibi tion. Looking at the coHectionfrom an histoii cal point of view, it is well worthy of a visit. On Sunday evening, December 26, the Rev. O. B. Symes, B.A., Pastor of the Stow Memorial Church, preached his farewell sermon to a large audience, the building being crowded. The -rev. gentleman selected for his text— 'And now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among those -that are sanctified. Acts xx., 32.' In his introduction he 4 welt on the woik of St. Paul at Ephesus, and pointed eut that the early Churches founded by the Apostles had, after their formation, been left to the guidance of the grace of God. , Paul,; wben,he ?Was obliged to leave 'Ephesus? transferred his apostolic trust, the pastorate of the Ohorch, to God; to whom he was primarily responsible. He evidently regarded his pastoral work as a trust, and- such it was at present, tlie pastor of *a church although open to., .the :critl-. cbm' 'of men, '. and responsible '.to/- them1 for-the discharge of his duties, was yet- in the highest sense accountable only to -Christ. Havlpg dwelt on the work and du'y of a pastor, he turned to the subject cf his discourse, and descanted on the work'.tobq done in building up a people, bo; as to make them holy and Christ-' like, tit for the inheritance of those that ' are sanctified. Faith In Christ was set forth as the7 basis on which the Christian character should be -built, and in clear and choice language the way in. which ^he superstructure should bej erected was pointed out, while in an affectionate and earnest mannerall were urged not to rely, on emotions, but diligently to labor so as acquire the. true graces of Christ ; to seek for saaoti fication, and remember that they /.were, the. jdiut inheritors, with Christ of a glory that was, rieyer fading. The means to the end in view was the word of GmL, and the power of . His. grace, to which he commended ihem. la Epeakiag of .his own , labors in. cona^c-, tioa with the Stow Chnrch ^during .ihe, fcPftst. three ; years, the rev. gentleman ^sppke ^niosti «loquently of .the motives that ^had ^afetuated and the, h igh Christian principles that 'hb& guided hi na, and in alljiding to the ^change about, to be made through- Ms being compelled to give , tip the pastorship of, the -)hurch in which he had labored long, and as he trusted . faithfully, he urged his hearers to censecrate themselves^with greater, earnestaess to the ?ervioe of Ghost. He addressed himself par ticularly io irotimj men, and exhorted them to dfeolde that Ju^ir lives, should he guided and inflaenced byl^fthe 'great ^ example «f Chrisfc,;: iWhile the ' aged, land those laden' with sin or sorrow, tie' invited toi oonie to -Christ and tb throw their burdens on Him, in ; simple trust in the great atonement that He had made for all.
