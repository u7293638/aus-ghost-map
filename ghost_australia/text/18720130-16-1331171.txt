The Courier. PUBLISHED DAILY. TUESDAY, JANUARY 30, 1872. The despatches of the late Acting- Governor to the Imperial Government respecting the late dissolution of Parlia- ment, with Lord Kimberley's reply, pub- lished in our issue of yesterday, are worthy of more than a passing notice. The subject to which they refer was one of the very gravest importance, involving as it did a fundamental constitutional question, about which uncertainty or doubt would he highly dangetous. If a Premier, by virtue of a majority, could adjourn Parliament for five months, he could do so for eleven months -might, in fact, exercise such an arbi- tary power in the conducting of the busi- ness in Parliament as would practically ignore and render impossible its chief func- tions as a deliberate and Legislative As- sembly of representatives of the people. The subject was not one that directly affected Imperial mteiests, and therefore the Secretary for the Colonies did not feel called upon to do more than give a little friendly advice to the Acting Governor upon it, but still he managed to make it very clear that the Acting Governor had committed a blunder, and just that blunder that the Opposition have always accused him of committing. If Imperial interests had been directly involved, or if his Lordship bad been on the spot, we have no doubt the opinion he has given would have been confirmed and conveyed in much stronger and less friendly terms. It may be that there are local politicians who will stoutly deny the cor- rectness of his Lordship's conclusions, just as they would deny the correctness of any opinion which differed from their own, no matter who propounded it-simply be- cause it did so differ ;-but such men may very well be left to their own harmless vanity aud self importance. Very few people aie simple enough to behove in these obscure oiacles und fewer still will gi\o them credit for possessing a more intimate mci evict Know ledge of constilu tioual foims and piecedents than the pie sent Secretar} of State for the Colonies rho teal cause of the Acting Governor's errol was that lie took sides ftom the very fiist (piobably unconsciously) when he ought to have remained strictly neutial This is peiceived all the moie cleaily in consequence of the palpably ineffectual ellorts he malves m his despatch of July 8, to state the case fanlj and îrupaitiall} Thus, in the 3th, L>th, and 7th paiagiaphs oí that despatch he says his " own intention was to prorogue foi a month, and, if neces saiy, foi such longei time is would enable the Maiqms of Nokm vmiy to an ive, and deal with the political situation us he might deem most advisable " But when tho Op position publicly asked him to do what he had proposed in foi ni to himself and Ins Ministers, he could no longei expect his Ministers to tendel lum that advice, nor did he feel inclined to foice it upon them It is impossible to understand ?«hy he should be obliged to altei his views dnectly the Opposition meuibeis adopted them, unless it was dom a settled deteimination to cling to the Palmer Mmistiy undor any encumstanees that might arise, and íesolutely îeject any course which would be likely to injuro them in any wa}, however much it com mended itself to his îeason oi judgment in eveiy othei respect AYith this foiegone conclusion stionglj impressed upon Ins mind, his judgment was so clouded that lie mistook the action of Ins Ministers foi that of the Legislative Assembly, and ne\ei seemed to pet ceive the en or he had fallen into until it was pointed out by loid ICniBEitLLi The petplexity into winch this strong paitj bias led him is at times so evident as to be îathei amusing than otheiwise Toi instance, his Ministers bad adjourned the House for ihe months without con suiting lum or even informing him -rf then intention to do so He felt that tins was wiong, and that he ought to leftise his assent to it even aftei the Ministi} had " nrevocably committed themselves to it," but how todo it without weakening that Ministry was a question that pulled him eoiel} , moie especial!} when lie found that the Opposition advocated the verj course that he had already pioposed to himself If the Opposition had only pioposed some less reasonable course, so that ho could have ^petied to snub them )( h} pioiogumg for a month, or until the ne \ Goveinoi aimed, everything else would have been smooth and eaBy enough, but their unseasonable moderation and common sense at tins critical j undine spoiled oveiything He was nervously anxious not to establish an} piecedent which might be cited heieattei as sub veisive of the undoubted prerogative of the Crown, nervously anxious to keep the I'vlmek Ministry in good tempei and m oflice, and give no encouiagcment to the Opposiliun by woul oi deed , and in uttei bewilderment how to accomplish these two objects, he at length snapped at the oftei undo by the Premier, which, if established, would haye been a precedent moie dan geious to constitutional Government thin the one he was so anxious to avoid He gave the Piemiei a second dissolution ten months aftei his fiist, when he only had a majorit} of one in tho House, and could not can} on the public business, and theicby, as far as he was able, established the precedent that a Piemicr is entitled to have a dissolution whenevti he linds he cannot cany on the business, no matter how shoit a time it ma} have been since his pievious appeal to the countiy If it had not been for this unfoitúnate paît} bias, the proper line of conduct, undei the cncumstinces, would have been much moie simple and easy Neaily all the dif- ficult} arose from that foregone conclusion tint his onl} hope was in the Puvuib Ministr}, as he plainly states it in the tenth paragraph of the despitch aheady íefeired to-a point which Loid luviBU!LE\ pretty 2'laml} tells lum he ought not to have troubled his head with " In the absence (sajs his Loulship) of any special cucum stances, the obvious couise to be taken b} a Governor whose Mmisteis possessing a majonty of only one in the Representative House, had, without consulting him, pio ceeded in a manner which he could not accept as constitutional, would be to íemove those Ministers fiom ofhee, and invite a leading membei of the Opposition to form an Administration Tf the Government so foimed weie unable to command a working inajoiit}, theie could be no question that it would have a good claim fora dissolution " There weie no "special circumstances" to w allant a depaiture horn this whole some constitutional nile The Opposition weie only in a minority of one, and they tepresented nearly two thirds of the people of the colony, while the public opinion in many districts represented b} the supporters of the Ministry was deculeill} on the side of tho Opposition, if it liad had a fan oppoitumty of expiessmg itself Nobody knew this bettei than the Acting Governoi, and if the position of patties had been reversed, and the popular pait} had been in power, under préciser} similar circumstances, there vvould not ha\e been a moment's hesitation as to the proper course to pursue, the five months'adjourn ment would have been at once cancelled b} a proiogation, and if the Ministry had ob jected, their resignations would have been accepted at once, even if they had been allowed to tender their resignations in stead of being summaril} dismissed Happily for the colon}, however, the course taken by the Acting Governor is not likely to be quoted as o precedent by an} future Governor or Ministr} after the very explicit opinion given by the Secretar} of State for the Colonies on the subject, and although it has undoubted!1} caused much public incon venience, and given nse to d great amount of bad feeling, werna} fairly congratulate ourselves on having suffered so little from so sorious a political blunder by Her Ma- jesty's representative here ny We regret that the last mail brings a record of the death of an old colonist, Mr. Joseph King, who, it appears, died very suddenly at his residence, Stratford upon Avon, on the night of the 21st of November last, at the age of 61 years. We have been kindly furnished by an intimate friend of the deceased gentleman with the following particulars of his early history in these colonies, which we think will be accept- able to many of our readers, who know the worth of the man: - "Mr. King came out to the sister colony of Tasmania some forty years since, in the immediate service of a Mr. Clarke, and shortly afterwards accompanied that gentle- man to New South Wales, in which colony Mr. Clarke, in conjunction with a Mr. Rankin, took up country in New England, being one of the first to take up stock to that locality. It was here Joseph King came to the front as a first- rate bushman, being one of the few who could go through a new and unexplored country on a 'bee line,' accompanied only by a black boy and a spare pack horse. Thus we find localities named after him - such as King's Gap, New England; King's Creek, on the Darling Downs; and wherever, and in whatever direction Joe King went he was a universal favorite. Many still recollect his hearty, cheery disposition under all circumstances; and his ringing laugh and jollity have many a time cheered the drooping spirits of the early pioneer settlers. Joseph King was a self made man; he sought but few favors, preferring rather to depend upon his own tact and judgment than lie under an obligation to another man, and thus, by keeping a steady course, and when opportunity offered, pushing out beyond the frontiers of civilisation, he was enabled to pick up some good country; and, in 1854, retired from squatting pursuits with a moderate competency; and with his kind hearted amiable wife (a sister of Mrs. James Taylor, of Toowoomba), went to the old country to spend the evening of his days, amongst the scenes of his early youth, but he never forgot the land he made his money in, and ever spoke of it as the poor man's El- dorado." Mr. King we regret, leaves no family to inherit his honorable name, but the memory of a good man dies not. Tun usual wcokly meeting of the Articlod CleikB' Society was hold in tho Supremo Court Ohambors, last evening Mr Holy presided The question for discussion wus -"A testator after giving a pecuniary legacy to his heir at law, directs his debts and funeral oxpenses to bo paid and discharged by his executrix herein oftor named Ho aftorwnrds gavo his daughter, whom he mado and ordained his executrix, nil and singular his lunas, tenements, and mes suagos, by h»r fairly to bo possossed and en joyed What estate did tho executrix take ?" After hearing the arguments of Mr Chambers on ono side, and Mr Thompson on the other, tho Chairman decided in favor of Mr Cham- bers, on tho authority of Doo d Ashley y Baines, CM 4, K , p 23 We learn from the Cleveland Bay Express of the 20th instant that George Albert Norton Russell, alias George Brown, was brought up, on remand, at the Townsville Police Court, on the 18th of January, charged with being con- cerned in the Townsville Post office robbery. Sergeant Higgins deposed that an examination of the premises lately occupied by the prisoner had resulted in the discovery of a quantity of tools, also two pieces of paper, consisting of letters from the Bank of New South Wales, signed "W. V. Brown, manager," they were found concealed between the stud and the chamfered board partition. Eight other docu- ments, consisting of portions of letters, were afterwards discovered -They contained the following signatures -Ernst Thamm, H H Barton, J A Holmes, W J Symonds, Frank H Hann (2), Francis Gill, and A. C. Ber- necker. Witness had communicated with most of the parties mentioned, and believed that the pieces of paper produced, containing the above signatures, were portions of letters that had been stolen from the Townsville Post office Evidence having been given by W V Brown, J A Holmes, and E Thamm, the prisoner was further remanded for eight days for the pro- duction of additional evidence. Tiieue was a largo attendance at the Vic tona Hall, last night, when the porformonco was for the benefit of Mr and Mrs J Ii By rs The principal attraction was, no doubt, the announcement that Shakspeare's admirable tragedy of " Eichard III " would bo produced by the whole of the members of the theatrical profession at present in Brisbane This is not saying a great deal, for, with the exception of about half a dozen players, there is not one amongst the " wholo of the profession " who ought to attempt to take a part m such a piece -except as soldtcrs, citizens, or similar cha ractcrs Hut notwithstanding the diihculties connected with the production of a piece of such roagnitudo in Brisbane, it was placed on the boards remarkable well, considering the ac commodation of the hall Mr Byers nas moro successful m the personation of Richard than oven Borne of his friends anticipated, while Stchnond was admirably represented by Mr Hollowu). Mrs Holloway appeared to great advantage as Queen ilixabelli, and tho un fortunato Lady Anne waa well sustained by Mrs Byers Tbo burlesque of " Faust and Imogcne" concluded the performance. 3] At the

somo person or persons unknown to break into the office of the Oleik of Petty Sessions An entry was effected by breaking the pane of glass in front of the latch, and making a hole sufficiently largo to admit tho hand, when the latch was pushed back, and an entrance easily effected Several drawers wcro violently opened, together with a preBB containing papers connocted with tho court, but nothing was removed It is pre Burned tbut the object of tho burglars was to sccuro possession of certain documents bearing on u case now before the court If such was their intention, it was defeated, precautions having been taken to place them pi safe custody when tho office was locked up for tho night Ok the subject of loichhardt's remains, tho South Australian Register of January 13 says -" It seoms probable that tho steamer Omeo will bo brought into requisition to foi ward what is generally regarded as the hopeless Boarch for tho remains of the explorer Loioh hnrdt A Now South Walos paper states that the Sydney Government, after much ti o spent in reflection, and in endeavoring to test the accuracy of certain statements made publio Bomo months ago, hos resolved upon so far assuming

o'clock It is not necessary to do more than recall the fact that the deceased, who hod long served with the army in India, and had seen good service there, was solected by Mi Burke to form ono of hia expedition to the Gulf of Carpentaria and was agaiu chosen to bo one of the little part} of four-Burke, Wills, King, and Gray-whom he led from Cooper's Creek across the continent to tho Gulf of Carpentaria, and back agaiu to the creek How Gray died by tho way how BuVko and Wills were starved to death almost within hail of the party re treating from the creek, and how King tho only survivor,

the Darling and the Murray, or Echjca Mr Main, who it appears has for some time been collecting information on this great soheme, intended to write by next mail to Mr T Dicker on the subject, but as Mr Croyle is going by the Somersetshire, he will wait on Mr Dicker on his arrival, and as certain what can be done The rough estimated cost of the line, if carried to Echuca, does not reach £10 000
