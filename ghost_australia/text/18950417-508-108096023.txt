Rev. H. IL Haweis. 'MUSIC AND NOISE.' The Rev. H. R. Haweis entertained a large audience at the School of Arts last night, while he demonstrated to them what was music and what was noise. The difference between the two was easily shown, he said, smiting a Chinese gong, and then gently touch ing a violin as he spoke; but some peo ple could not always see, or rather ucai jli. j-jjc uuguau JJt^jJlt^ 1UI 111 stance, went down to dinner to the hideous sound of a Chinese gong1, and consequently, abused though he had been for his opinion, he still held they could not really be musical. The lecturer was also severe on what the poets termed 'the harmony of na ture.' As examples, he gave imita tions of - the * soughing of the wind, the lapping of the ocean waves, the screaming of eagles, the piping of canaries, the bray of the donkey, and the midnight screeching of the cat. Still, he would prefer such sounds to the music the public were often treated to, and which was as use less as the surplus morals which were often thrown at them. Many il lustrations of the degrees of notes within notes were given by Mr. Ha weis, who kept his audience in a con tinual simmer with his bright talk and smart anecdotes. Any note which really was a note of music would, he said, vibrate a few hun dreds of thousands of times to the second. A complete analysis of 'the metaphysical effect of sound' on the nervous system was also given, the lecturer making his points plain by the aid of a blackboard and violin. All the emotions, he said, had their exact physical counterpart in musical notes. The four parts into which emotion might be divided, namely, elation or depression, velocity, inten sity, and variety and unity, could all be produced by sound. At the close of the lecture Mr. Haweis was hear tily applauded. He will make his last appearance in Sydney to-night 'Mo- dern Ghosts and Spiritualism' will be the subject dealt with.
