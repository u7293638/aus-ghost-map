An Army Called out to lay a Ghost. One night in January, in the year 1836, two or three young men. while at a farm house not far from Old Washington. Texas, manufactured and turned loose upon the unsuspecting citizens of the town a ghost that cost one negro the loss of a leg and caused the President of the Republic to order out the army, causing the greatest consternation a ghost ever caused on earth. .As a fitting termination to tho (lavâ€™s sport, they fastened a skeleton be longing to a doctor to a white horse and turned the animal loose, and started him towards Xew Washington. An old planter by tho name of Holmes was riding slowly along on his way from town to his home when he suddenly found himself, as he said, face to face with a genuine ghost. He did not lose any time in asking ques tions. It was light enough for him to see the hideous thing pretty plainly. He was a game man, but he afterwards said that he was seared out of his senses. The old white horse was trotting slowly along with the skeleton in the saddle. Ho shouted somothhig, but it kept coming and seemed to be riding right at him. He did manage to draw his pistol with a shaking hand and fire. The Hash and report frightened the old white horse, and he sprattg forward in a gallop, and then t'ho old bones rattled as if the devil himself wore shaking litem. The fanners horse needed no urging. As much heightened as his master, he wheeled iit his tracks and started hack to town with the speed of the wind. Mr. Holmes looked hack and saw the white horse close to him, and it looked as if t he terrible monster wa? reaching out its lone; bony fingers eager to clutch him and tear him to pieces. When the planter, the white horse, and the gho.-tly rider reached the town the entire population was put to flight. General Houston ordered tho troops out, and hundreds of citizens took a shot at the ghost. Finally a pack of hounds tore the hones from the back of the horse, and tho excitement subsided.
