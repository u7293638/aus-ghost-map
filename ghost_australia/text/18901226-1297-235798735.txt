RE POST-OFFICE CARVINGS. to the editor op the daily telegraph. Sir,— In your issue of the 17 th inst. I read a Mr. Hawkins brought forward in the House a question respecting the Post-office carvings — I nresuine he rneaut those monstrocities- at tho Pitt-street end of tho P.O.— modestly proclaim ing himself to be an " art critic," and "if such wore removed it would be an eternal shame." This idea was backed up, to my surprise, by the Premier, a gentleman who has expended Government money in procuring works of art for our colonial collection ot fine arts. I do not hesitato to say these carvings are a perfect libel on the colonial sculptors of tbc present day and a lasting disgrace to so fine a building as the G.P.O. Take, for instance, tha bust of our former Chief Justice, Sir J. Martin — a grosa caricaturo of that deceased gentleman. Also the alto-relievos intended to ropreseut telo- grapby, sheep-shearing, poatal delivery, ike., are all vulgar In the extreme. The eyes of each figure reminds one of two burnt holes in a blanket. Placo these carvings alongside the three- quarter figures on top ot Handcock's Tower, George- street, near tho Haymarket, and they would dis grace those huuablo and rough works of poor Abrahams, who only received ill oach and bis board and lodging. When a pupil of Sir F. Chantry, P.R.A, iu 18B0 to 1886, had I perpe trated such absurdities I should have been handed over by Sir Francis to Mr. Allan Cun ningham, his foremun, who would probably havo set mo to work with snakestone, putty powder and piece of ilauuel to polish a slab of marble. The two boys on the A.J.S. Bank referred to by one speaker arc artistic, although oat of place for a bank. Two cornucopia in their places would doubtless hare been more suitable. I would suggest that the carvings be covered with colored Roman couout to match the stone and left in plain projecting raised entablature. — Yours, ifcc.. GEOST OF MICHAEL ANGELO.
