WOODSIDE. [From oar own Correspondent] September 1. During laBt veek we have had very heavy rains. Torrents of water in various streams rushed to the ordinary channel called the Onkaparinga Biver, greatly widening it, and overflowing its usual boundaries in many places, the mighty stream carry ing away in its onward course many foot and other bridges that were thrown over for the comfort of travellers. Yesterday and to-day having been very fine, the earth, and especially the roads, have dried much, and in some warm and screened places the crops look well, but in the swampy and exposed parts there is a very patchy appearance. Every evening during the last week special services have been held in the Wesleyan ChapeL Considering the state ;of the weather, and the small surrounding population, the attendance has been very good. The special services are to be continued until Saturday next, the 5th inst. The heavy rains on Friday last occassioned the postponement of a lecture 'On Ghosts,' by the Bev. Canon Bussell, of Adelaide, before the friends of the Mechanics' Institute, in the Court House of Wood side. The Bev. Mr. Andrews, of Blakiston, preached in the Established Church, last Sunday evening, to a full congregation. Mr. Andrews intends to preach every alternate Sunday evening in future.
