I A NEW CAPER. I I have before me in writing the fact I itcorded that at a ball which took place I rot long ago "two couples danced in the I mening set" who were "not entifled or requested to be there." The writer con- I tends because of this, that their names I "should not appear." I am afraid he is a young man without sufficient apprecia- I ton of the— shall we say? — aplomb, of H those "two couples." I think most de- tidc-dly people who can walk into an open- irtg set unasked deserve very special man- lion. They have given a novelty to that stereotyped thing, the opening set. They have made one feel that good ton may be missed by not arriving in time to see the opening set at H every dance. They have introduced pos- Hrlhiiities which, if persisted in, might Hnean that others like them could "hould M failure," and those who were requested 'lance the opening set would have to down lower. Imagine the Governor parly pushed to the lower end, whilst 'couples" who have come in unask- H il cavort at the top of the room. The fiter strikes me as indignant. i can only hugk i have not a ghost of an idea who "two couples" were; can my infor- tant tell nte, I thought that i knew ways of Melbourne society, and be- here is a brand new trick. Quite a al idea, too— like so many others. Fu- re announcements of the opening set 1 u'e ronil>'eted by some such remark / 0l-0tt's: "Mr B. and Miss C. were not jested to be there; they ware there all Mr D' and Mrs E- were, not Ml; . t0 be thele; but a trifle like that fart! 5JreIent ,heir walking in and Bmi Tliese "two couples" have not my fancy, but inspired >)m ,,y 0"g'nal. if somewhat brief; caJIed "The Reason," or "'Cos Kn,oa«e 50u «oinS. my pretty maid? li:hV Sl S3t' sir' Ehe said. i'nnf!/0U soing:' pretty maid?
