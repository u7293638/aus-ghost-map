GOD BLESS THEE! I Her eyes were eyes that melt in love, My sister's voice was soft and low, And lips that never oped to blame, And hands that still'd the throbbing brow ; And ever with her " Good night " came My sister's sweet a God bless thee." I sought the tavern's reeking den, And drained the cup till reason fled ; All gentler thoughts I spurned then, And welcomed devils in their stead. She met me with her own fond smile, And whisper'd " May God bless thee." I herded with a gambling crew, Joined hands with that infernal host ; I staked her life upon a throw, Then turned, and found the die had lost. I met her, and she knew the cost, Yet murmur'd still, "God bless thee." " Why are the worthless thus beloved ?" I raised my desperate hands and cried ; And " Who shall save the drunken sot ?" She held my arm and sweet leplied, " Who loves, he reasons not," Then kiss'd and bade God bless me. Her face was pale, her eyes were dim, She lay npon the bed of death ; Mine was the hand that brought her thereÂ» Yet still, between eaeh ebbing breath, She whispered kind words in my ear, And, as she died, " God bless thee." My sister rests beneath the turf, Yet echo lives in memory's cave, Responsive to her accents low. Though flowers grow upon her grave, Her hand is still upon my brow, And still " God bless thee," Amendment came-too long delayed And oh ! how fearful was the price ; Her blood hath my atonement made, I shun my former haunts of vice. Her ghost stands in the tavern's door, And warns me with " God bless thee." She who returned the prince's scorn, And like for like gave back to pride, (Oh God, that ever I was born !) Clung fondly to her brother's side, And kissed him as he struck her down, And cried, " May Heaven bless thee." ! And will God bless me ? I who sent That angel sister to her tomb ? Despair now bid me not repent But, ah ! there kneels> before His throne, A figure that shall not arise, \ Until He says, " I bless him."
