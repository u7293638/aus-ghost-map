Duckwmg- Leg-horns. Duckwing Leghorns were originated by Mr. G Payne after six years' devotion. At the present there is a growing divergence between gold and silvers, and Mr. Payne, in a letter to the Fanciers' Gazette , explains that the material used to produce 'silvers was very different from that used to produce golds, and the two areas distinct as the dark and silver grey Dorking. A silver was the first to score in the show pen ; the first gold ever bred was in 1880, when he carried several firsts ; and for colour has never yet been beaten. He. was bred from a silver hen. Golds can be bred from silvers, but silvers can never breed golds. Mr. Payne deprecates ~ Conning separate classes at present for golds ana sdvere, since admitting _ sports and off colours has been the e salvation t)f the duckwings, judges having done wisely not to insist on an ar bitrary standard of colour, but upholding type, shape, and head points. The first step, however, to differentiate would be a gold or silver duckwing cock anddackwing hen. He is of opinion that hens bred . from golds will scarcely ever be found in the show pen, and no gold-bred bird will ever stand a ghost of a chance against a silver with points equal. It is, however, just as easy to breea gold as diver coda. Silvers require some cultivating, and will occasionally give trouble when it comes to a question of fredi blood, and the selection thereof, and the further we wander from the stripe in the hackle the nearer _ we get to mottled breasts and gnarled ' thighs in the cockerels.
