On thia report an enquiry w^|| held at Bundaberg, commencing on December3$raJ| 1884, before Mr. S. Jobnstione, P.M^ and O'Connell, now M.L.A. for 'Musgrav*, and then local Inspector for?:Pacific. Islanders? At that enquiry!! four ringleaders—Dick, Onbo, Ria and Liedpla-J admitted in cold blood that they had attemptedt^ take the ship and wanted to murder the crew,. 30|ft)^ and Eia, be it specially noted, were Manoba Among other of the'would be murderers was '3 >'kanaka nam«d Joe, ;, or Enou—; now almost &V; notorious in Teputatton as the 4etestable ' blfl^ skunk Messiah, who piloted the "Hopeful" caseS through by unblushing perjury. This fJundaterg enquiry respecting the attempt on thO 35elena "jffta concluded on 31st December, 1884; and thfe; do* . positions were duly fowardfed to Brisbane. „ Nothing was done to punish these self-con?6&e;<l would-be murderers. They; were quietly sent took to the plantations which had recruited them, and allowed to fili.jtheir engageimc&Lts;, I don't want to suggest any particular reason .as being the why and the wherefore for not punishing these scoundrels. I will merely remind the readers-that the " Hope ful" martyrs were then under sentence; that public sentiment was stroDgJy agitated in their favor and against the Government at tbe time ; that the pub lication of a tale of attempted magsacre by kanakas would, at that period, have greatly intensified the general feeling of indignation against the Govern ment's treatment of the " Hopeful" martyrs; and that Sir S. W. Griffith was in the heyday of his might, - Inexpressibly sad is it sometime^ to dive down to the, secret and cavernous deptW in the black and murky ocean of political motives. On February 21st, 1888, the Helena left Bundaberg with returns for the Solomon Islands, and with T. Seymour Armstrong as the Government Agent in charge. On board were Onbo and Ria (the Manoba $air who had confessed to attempted murder) and one of their fellow ringleaders, the fourth having iiied in Queensland. The boys were duly landed on their islands. Remaining in. Queensland; amongst others impli cated in'the attempted" massacre, was Joe, or Enou, and he shortly afterwards managed to get abillet as boatman on the ^labour schooner Ariel. Not long after Government Agent'Armstrong was transferred to the Ariel. Thus sailed to the South Seas, aboard , the same vessel, Agent Armstrong and Boatman Joe, or .EnouT-would-be. murderer and intended . victim. .. } ■ A At Maiioba once more; Word is received aboard ii j£he Ariel that a ishief ashore is very sick, and Arm (' strong decides to go ashore, -in spite ok tbe. warnings [ given by some, natives that he was marked'out for [ butchering. One of the boat's crew that took Arm Lstjrong ashore was Joe, or Enou. . Indeed/Joe was N&jack; -va.' willing Ainstrong ^t&foi;^gh the tsurf ' his' shoulders so that the <3k>-. | vernment agent should not wet his. feet.

Strange to Ba.y, Jbebas . escaped without# scratch. • The- Questions will - rise, to one's lips ajoid won't be evaded-- Was Joe one; of - Armstronig's murderers ? WSis .he^^he decoy tteM off to lure him ' to his preconcerteji butchery F * > ; There ai^ no-proofs of Joe's complicity-before us, say you. True. Yet, I state deliberately that, on suspicions jnot, half ., so reasonably and well-defin* d (for the evidence ait? pointed to^sjelf-defence rather than aggressive'attack), and m six^lar absence of all ? proofs, the Hapeful" m^y^ wt^.conjfe®ned te a . flhamefultleatli, which ^seritence w^a only commuted, kff texwe of.JyibJic; opinionj t®-a U^ag diiE^ by-life long ii^riso^ent. ^ •„ , .

'Ffusfax-' has Made himself 'equally so by the indifference shown since the facts <of the case w^re placed in his possession, but on the I people of Queensland as a whole rests the ; stain and bg»dt of Amstrpng's death. Thus, during the late ; Administration; six white men were macfe to suffer iimprisonment in irons for having fired at kanaka?, ^and made to suffer, too,- on the slightest evidence, yefe four kanakas, who had cle&rly; confessed the gjenormoub crime pf attempted murder; were permitted to return to their islands scot free;" I dissent in part from this, Not *Von the people f Queensland a£( a whole rest the stain and guilt of Armstrong's death,'' but on that Administration hioh ignored kanaka crime lest it might lose the glut of itfe vengeance on the "Hopeful*' jrtyrs.
