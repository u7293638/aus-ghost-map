A SPIRITUALISTIC BUMST UP. An amusing defeat of the American spiritualist, Mr Bastlan, is announced from Vienna where (says the Pall Mall Gazette) for some time the eminent medium, has been the cause of much discussion among the higher and highest classes of society. The Crown Prince of Anstria and Archduke John, having determined to sound the mysteries of Mr BaBtian's art, arranged three seances at the Archduke's residence. The first was held without any revelations, but before the second meeting began preparations were secretly made to catch the gbost in a trap. After the select audience hid'gathered in dimly-lighted room, a spirit in a garb of mourning silently .entered, while the medium was apparently lying in the next room, stiff and fast asleep. This room was separated from that in which the andience was assembled by a curtained doorway through which tho ghoBt passed. In this entrance the conspirators, however, had fixed a secret door, which they could shut silently and instantly-by touching a spring. While the mournful ghost was flitting before the awe-struck assembly, this door suddenly shut, and the ghost, who stood revealed as Mr Bastian, vainly endeavored to make his escape. The merriment of- the company knew no bounds when the medium's shoes alone were found in the next room, where a few moments before Mr Bastian had heen lying in meBmerio sleep. Tho depression in spirtoalistic circles is naturally veiy great.
