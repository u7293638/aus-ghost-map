TOMAHAWKING Tnus tlio D. T.:—" It is understood that the editor of tho Bulletin has entered into partnership with a sexton, and that in future that doleful publication ■will bo known as the Graveyard. A new office, wo believe, is in course of excavation at Haslem's Creok, and the burial sdrvice is to be kept in type as a perpetual and ap propriate leader. Sick persons, who find a melancholy interest in the perusal of this publication, state that there has never been an issue Without a corpse, a grave stone, or a ghost. There was, however, an effort to be cheerful at Christmas time, and accordingly a coloured supplement was produced, representing a dying bush man. In last week's issue there is an old cut of Kelly, tho bushranger, with the name of Mr. Wright, tho Post-master General, printed under it. Mr. "Wright may not be altogether a model Minister, but ho has dono nothing to justify the Graveyard in first disfiguring his personal appearance, and then putting him in the Chamber of Horrors." In its turn the Graveyard thus drives our local machine:—" The liega standard almanac has just been received by us. Once it was to hand. Now it is to foot. It is a wonderful production, anyhow, and as it is so extraordinarily pale, its appearance may bo accounted for by a feeling of nervousness at being about five weeks late. Tho Standard itself is a masterly sample of journalism, exorcising a wise discretion in appearing without an editorial. There is a long essay on "Future Legislation, byCowtail," though whose opinions, as may bo expected, are considerably behind. Wo are glad we exchange with the Her/a Standard. 'Twill 6avo us subscribing to it!"
