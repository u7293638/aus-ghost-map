A WORD FOR THE CHILDREN. Children are very imaginative beings, their fancy is easily excited and little sLrvesto strike then young minds with owe susceptibility to impressions of all kinds is especially characteristic of children. The inlets to feelings are vividly sensitive in them, and during the first five years of life the child, perhaps, learns more of the qualities of objects, their relations, ideas about them, impressions of things, and receives more lasting impulses to conduct and character than he does during the whole of his future life Unhappily, this keen susceptibility of children to impressions is often met on advantage of, greatly to their injury by iso and careful training of youth requires much forbearance, patience, and good gold once. The best culture is slow and gradual, but impatient nurses and educators cannot wait. They foolishly expect children to display of temper and wisdom which age and experience have not yet enabled themselves to acquire Their methods are too often hasty and passionate If the child will not be good," he is stopped on the back, or is threatened with the Old Black Man " And very often the lust power fully of fects the imagination, and, by exciting the fears of the child, subdues him when nothing else will But the quiet which is produced by the top row of "Bogie," is obtained at a fearful sacrifice Every unfounded fear excited in the mind of a child is a stab inflicted on its moral nature The child is terrified, it is true, and is quiet for the moment, but the cause of the querulousness has not been i moved, while you have planted a tenor in its mind, and thereby made an impression upon his character which he will not efface Superstitious fear has been engendered to a greater or less extent, which will continue to affect the child's being, even after he has grown up into manhood But what is still worse, the child by and by of John is that " Bogie " 13 a fiction, for the more " Bogie " is threatened, the more he doesn't come In fact, he discovers that all the while you have been threatening him with the "Block Man " and " Bogie," it has only been a series of lies you have been telling him And thus, not only have you educate your children in superstition, but in falsehood Some foolish nurses go even farther than words, they shut up London children in a dark closet or cellar, to make them so " good " At least this terrifies the child, though sometimes it only makes him sulky and defiant, but occasionally it only drives him into idiocy, and sometimes kills him outright A frightful case of this latter sort occurred at Birmingham some y years ago. The parents of a child had gone out to an evening party The child was fretful, and the servant in whose charge it had been left to terrify it into quiet, while she enjoyed herself with "company" downstairs, dressed up a frightful object in a mask, and pinned it to the curtains of the bed The mother returned home, and ran to her infant, it lay perfectly quiet Its eyes were wide open, but fixed upon the frightful figure in the mask I The mother touched the child, it was dead ' You can fancy the anguish that poor little thing must have suffered before the life was terrified out of it by this inhuman expedient of the faithless eel vant, and what also must have been the agony of the mother at thus discovering her lifeless child Idiocy has not unfrequently resulted from similar tenors practised on children-first there is a fit, then brain disease, ending in idiocy Sei vants who are generally a little educated class, and bring into the Iiohbcs of their em- ploy on the domestic methods of terrifying which have been practised in their own humble, and it may be all regulated, homes-sonants, we say, are very apt to resort to terror in dealing with children, and rely mainly on the " Black Man" and the " bad place," in subduing them into quiet They are sometimes too fond of frighten- ing the young things with goblin stones, and tales of witches and ghosts, which cling to the child's imagination, and cause him much after misery No careful mother will expose her child to the risk of such inhumanity being practised upon its young and susceptible mind, for if she do, she may cb w ell throw up her child at once, 1 and leave off all further care of his up banging as any good influences which she may I express o will be effectually thwarted, and the child's nature irretrievably poisoned, by the more powerful malign influences at work in her I ob once Pictures are often of a kind to excite great terror in the minds of children, and those of a frightful kind ought carefully to be kept out of their way We have recently seen a little book with cuts, representing the torments of the lost, which could not fail to excite such honors in the minds of most children as they could never afterwards entirely shut-off A bud expression in a picture haunts one for long after A child never forgets the pictures with which he has been familiar in curly yours They speak found through the eye, which, at that time, is the main inlet of knowledge and the impressions then made are of the most abiding kind Even some of the modern picture books are not free from the hon rible, and against all such xv o w am mothers of families to beware A Caution to Youthful Smokers- In a lucid paper by Mr Andrew Ross, M D , of Molong, on "The Climate of Australia, Viewed in Relation to Health, which appears in the February number of the New South Wales Medical Gazette, he thus declaims against tobacco - " The use of tobacco (smoking) is another very frequent evil resorted to by many in daily life Its effects are so familiarly known that I need not w us to tune repenting details I merely vv lab to direct attention to the injury it produces on the constitution from its early use Its ill effects are most apparent on the stomach, nervous Bys j tern and salivary glands By its stimulating I qualities it particularly roba tho s reach of one of the essential elements to digestion, for if the food be improperly masticated and intermixed with saliva, how is it possible to expect proper and healthy digestion and nutrition?

It works all day and night, in fair weather and foul It has no sound in its foot steps, but travels fast It grows at a man's substance with invisible teeth It binds industry with its film as a fly is bound in a spider's web Debts roll a man over and over, binding hand and foot, and letting him hang upon the fatal mesh until the long legged interest devours him. There is but one thing on a form like it, and that is the Canada thistle, which swarms new plants every time you break its roots, whose blossoms are prolific, and every flower the father of a million seeds Every leaf is on awl, every branch a spear, and every plant like a platoon of bayonets, and a field of them like an armed host The whole plant is a tor mont and vegetable curse And yet a farmer had better make his bed of Canada thistles than attempt to be at war upon interest.
