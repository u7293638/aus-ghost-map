The winner turned up in the 5 year old Hyacinth, by Lord of Lynne, the property of Mr. W. Pear son, who was not thought of till he ran a good trial last week. Euclid was second, and Larpent a very close third. Hesperian and The Ghost, which had been made very strong favorites, were never dangerous. Ten horses started for the Town Plate. Commotion went to the front soon after they got away, and led all the rest of the distance. Progress ran second till in the straight, where he failed, and was passed by Wellington, who made a fine finish, but could not get up to the leader. Wellington finished wonderfully well, but though he shortened the distance between him and Commotion "lie could not get up, and the colt won easily. For the second time during the meeting two sons of Panic finished first and second in as. fine a race asbas been seen on the Flemington course. That Wellington could carry lOst. and finish second in a two-mile race run in 3 min. 34sec. shows what a wonderfully good horse he is. "His performance was so highly appreciated by the spectators that the winner was neglected, while it was Wellington that everyone thronged to look at, and as the horse came into the weighing yard he was greeted with most enthusiastic cheering. The Victorian public dearly love a good horse, and it is doubted, if a better horse than Wellington ever stripped to do battle on the Flemington course. The race was run in 3m. 34s. Pell Mel], with whom Mr. Phillips declared to win, was never near the front at any time. Allander won the Alleged Stakes easily; Solitude was second, and -Mistaken third.
