? ? : POETRY. The Land off' Long; Ag;o. We've tvoddon ragged -ways, old fviqnd, .. . Siiico childlioocVs buoyant yuuvs, Our paths now brightly arched with hopo, Now dark with clouds and tears ; But looking hack o'er time and change, Tho fairest land we know Lies bath'd in mornings rosy light â€” The Land of Long Ago. When there how distant far appeared To us the glow of noon ! What eager, earnest glances turned To days that came too soon ! Ay, came too soon, with earnestness, With struggles, triumphs, woe ; With gravo, calm words and thoughtful smiles, Tho ghosts of Long Ago. Our frionds,. dear frionds of vanished years ! ?Their 'mem'ry haunts us yot, Like fragments of somo sweet old song ; Tho heart can ne'er forgot. Thoir kindly words woro music's tone, Thoir eyes had friendship's glow ; But ah! thoir'smilcs beam faintly now From far-off Long Ago. Wo'vo climbed lifo's hard, rough hill, old friond, Wo'ro passing down its slope; Boliind us lies a weary road, Boforo tho Land of Hopo. ' : ; ' That weary road is lined with graves, . .. Tho valo is glad below, Thoro ehildron played as onco wo played'' / ' ? ?? In happy Long Ago. Por aye may childhood's sunny sky ; \: ? Bo freo from gloom arid tears, That stores of joy may treasured bo For drearj' aftor years ; Por, viowing now tlio day of lifo Through night's dbsconding snow, The fairest, dearest pictures gleam ?Prom bright old Long Ago. . ?
