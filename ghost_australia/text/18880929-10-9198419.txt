The Retreat was continued until Thursday night last, on which 'evening' a session' was held preparatory' to the opening of the Synod. At this gathering the Synodal officers were named and certain Diocesan de- crees formulated. The officers of the Synod were The Very Rev. Dean Beechinor, of Launceston, and the Very Rev.

The priests present recited alternately the verses of the 68th Psalm, after which the Archbishop recited the Litany of the Saints, the cantors mean- while chanting. Towards the end of the litanies the Archbishop rose with crozier in left hand and blessed the Synod. The Gospel proper to the day was then sung by a priest in Dalmatia, and the Archbishop followed with the intoning of the hymn " Veni Creator Spiritus." That was also taken up and continued by the cantors, after which the ARCHBISHOP gave an address to the priests present. The PROMOTER asked the Archbishop to allow the Decree of the Council of Trent, on making the profession of faith, to be read. The AitCHuisiior having given his consent, the SERETARY (Dr. Gleeson) read the decree. The Secretary, standing at the altar, then read the profession of faith, the priests kneeling, the Archbishop remaining seated, after which His Grace took the oath prescribed in the profession of faith, and received the oaths of the priests, still kneeling. At the conclusion of this ceremony Dr. Gleeson proceeded to the pulpit, and read to the congregation portions of the Decrees of the Provincial Council of Sydney. The PROMOTER then requested that the names of the priests should be read out by the secretary of the Synod. In compliance with that request, the SECRETARY read the names, and the priests responded in order, those who were absent Being excused as having legitimate cause, The PROMOTER also requested the notary of the Synod to take down a record of the proceedings and com- mit them to the archives of the diocese, which request the notary promised faithfully to carry out. At the request of the pro- moter the secretary next read the decree for the termination of the Synod, and the Archbishop imparted his blessing. The Acclamations to God were then chanted by the cantors, in serial tone, after which the Te Deum was sung.
