THE HOUSE OF JACK SHEPPARD. Despite t?ie fact (says an exchange) that the house known as Jack Sheppard's in Wych-street, has been doomed more than once, and a few months since was said to be included in the drastic Strand improvement scheme, workmen are busily eugage'd in restoring the quaint old house in Wych-street, in which Wood, the carpenter, to whom Jack Sheppard was apprenticed, is said to have lived and car ried on his business. The house is a double-gabled one, with overhanging upper floors, and is situated. on the south side of the street, immediately opposite the gate way of New Inn. It has been closed for a long time past, and given over to rats and ghosts, but, much to the astonish ment of the neighbors, a new tenant has been discovered, and the old house is be ?lack Sheppard's House, Wych-street, Strand. ing so ii-ansfonned that it will hardly know itself. It therefore seems that Harri son Ainsworth's exciting romance of Jack and his daring deeds is to be perpetuate'd for a while longer. How llirilling is the section of the story that deals with the old house. 'Jn the pleasant month of June, 1713,'' writes Ainsworth, 'it chanc ed liiat My.
