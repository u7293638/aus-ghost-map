a. EPVI7ALIST RUN pA'D. TEs .I/etetoln GCardhia records some of the incidents of a revival mission of the Revr. Johli M'Neill, B.A; In his nmessage re cently' Mr. M'Neill said that he waa some times asked whether'it vas sinful to attend qluadrille assemblies or danuciig classes. Heo was not going to say whether it; was wrong or not, but hia te?xt, told him that they should be ' sealed with th.; Holy Spirit oa promise," and have "' the earuess of their inheritrnce " within. He would give a cheque for' £50 if they could produce anoy one who was filled with the Holy Ghost and yet attended dancing assemblies. If a man had the .earnest of the inheritance within him, and was'full up of the Holy Ghost, it would take a very stroung rope and a power ful locoomotive to drag himn into a danciung room, where people went splinnin round: and round like so many id ots, and it would be hell to himi until be couldge·t oudb agin. The preacher also indulged in lariable. Heo represented the Lord as hrviug lost some of His flock, and as saying to the rangel Gabriel, "'Gabriel, just go down to the. world, and see if you can hunt them up." Gabriel srarted on his mission, and reported : Lord, I hear the sliulin. of feet in here," whenthe Lord replied, "Oh! none of my flock could be foud there'; that is a b'll room.' "Mr. Mi'Neill concluded this illus-, tration by expressing the hope that thr Lord would niever soliend Gabriel to look for him in a ballroom. -
