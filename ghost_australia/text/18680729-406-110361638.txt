AN HOTEL BILL 335f BRAZIL. Speaking of those prodigious Portugese pennies reminds me that it takeB 1,000 reis (pronounced rays) to make a dollar, and that all financial estimates are made out in reis. We did not know this until after we had found it out, and we found it out through Blucher. Blucher said he was so happy and so grateful to be on solid land once more, that he wanted to give a feast—said he had heard it was a cheap hind, and he was bound to have a grand banquet. He invited nine of us, and we ate an excellent dinner at the principal hotel. In the midst of the Jollity produced by g^piscigars, good wine, and passable anecdotes, the landlord presented his bill; lyncher glanced ,iifc it and his countenanq^sll. He took another lpok' Wassurelpnself that his senses had notdeceived^im, and then read the items aloud, in a ^altering voice, while the roses in his cheeks turned to ashes:—" 4 Ten dinners at600 reis, 6,000 reis! ' Kuin and desolation! ' Twentyfive cigars at 100. reis, 2,500 reis !' Oh, my sainted mother! * Eleven bottles of wine at 1,200 reis, 13,200 reis i'. Be with usall! 4 Total, 215700 reis !' Great s Caesar's ghost, thf^e ain't money enough in the ship tpO|^iii&ai;^biU! Go, leave me to my boys, I'm a ruined community..* ^®uk it was the blankest looking party I evei* saw. Nobody could say a word. It was as if every soul had suddenly been stricken dumb. Wineglasses descended slowly to the table, " their contests untasted. Cigars dropped unnoted from nerveless fingers. Each .man sought his neighbour's eye, but found in it no ray of hope, no encouragement. At last the fearful silence was broken. The shadow of a desperate resolve settled down upon Blucher's countenance like & cloud, and he icose — "Landlord, this is a wre^cftecl: mean swindle, and I'll never, never $ta&d; it. Here's 150 dols., sir, and it's all you'll get—I'll swim, in blood, sir, before I'll pay a cent, more." Our spirits rose and the landlord'^'fell—at least we thonght so; he was &mf;&&d; at any rate, notwithstanding he had not understood a word that had' been said:. He glanced from the little pilW^of -gold pieces to Blucher several tim^, and then went out. He must have visited an American, for when he returned he brought back his bill translated into language that a Christian 'could understand—thus :—10 dinners, 6,000 reis^ 6 dole.; 25 ci^^(;^,500 reis, or 2-4618. 50c. ^ 11 ^ wine, 13,200 reis, "or 13 dole. 20c.; reis, or 21 dols. 70c. Happinfe^|^Sied '^nce-'more: Blucher's ' More refreshments were;order^|3^^P^f In speaking of a learned Serjeant, who gave a confused, elaborate and tedious explanation of some point of law, Currau observed, " 1Mb whenever the grave counsellor e&^avoured to unfold a principle of law,^ he put hip in mind of a fool whom he once skw stru^ling a whole day to open an oyster with a rolling* pin." . >>/-■'■■■ . -y$ ' v / j .
