A TEURIFIC dust storm, accompanied by thunder and lightning, passed over Lake Austin at about 8.30 on Saturday evening. The wind, which blew with great violence, caught the front of the post office, lifting the verandah posts over the building tor a distance of 20 yards, and the galvanised iron was scattered in all directions for a distance of 200 yards. The storm also caught Philbin's Hotel in like manner. The old residents of Lake Austin say the like of it has never before been seen at Lake Austin. The galvanised iron has been blown from the front of the roof of the building. IT will be notic*d from the shipping advertisement of the William Howard Smith firm that they are putting on a new chartered steamer in the intercolonial trade. The name of the vessel is the Brand, a modern steamer of 2003 tons, built by the firm of Messrs. R. Duncan and Co., of Glasgow. She is of the epar deck type, and has a set of triple-expansion engines. She is posted to leave Melbourne on the 19th and Adelaide on the 22nd inst. for Geraldton via ports. We are glad to notice that one of the shipping companies have at last deigned to despatch a boat through to Geraldton, as for the pag): two months or more the large steamers have turned round at Fremantle owing to the demand for freights and passages from the E istern colonies to that port only.- This opportunity, however, should be taken advantage of by the Geraldton merchants who will be able tc receive their goods without transhipment and in ten days instead of from three to six weeks. We cm mend the company tor their enterprise and wish them the sueccss they so justly deserve. Their boats have always berthed at our new jetty (when others have declined to do BO) and a saving to consignees of much unnecessary expense has thus been effected.
