"INDEPENDENT." FRIDAY, APRIL 24Trr, 1891.. AN UNWISE DECISION. SoaM time ago His Honor Mr. Justice Williams expressed a wish that Courts of Petty Sessions would send offenders in serious cases up for trial as frequently as possible, in order that they might meet with adequate punishment, which in l!isopinion they often escaped in the lower Courts. The Chairman of the North Melbourne bench expressed his dissent from this view, which he said would* saddle the country with heavy criminal law costs, but His Honor, if he was reported aright, only meaLt his remarks to apply to desperate characters, and not to petty pilferers and backyard thieves. On Monday a case came before the North Melbourne Court in the shape of a most cowardly and brutal assault, and one in which the victim received injuries of such a peculiarly painful character that it would be horrible to refer to them in detail. The offender had" not the ghost of a defence, and should certainly have been placed in the dock of the Supreme Court on a chargel of. inflicting grievous bodily harm, but in place of this the vague charge of "assault," which Mr. Justice Holroyd once told a jury may mean anything from pulling a man's ear to punching his head into a jelly, was entered against the prisoner's name, and the bench elected to deal with him. The offence was fully proved, and as will be seen elsewhere a fine of £10, with £7 7s. costs, or three months in gaol imposed. Whether the culprit pays the £17 7s. or " takes it out " the penalty is utterly insufficient, and such an outrage on an inoffensive man in his own house on Sunday evening, is quite deserving of two years imprisonment with periods of solitary confinement, if not a couple of floggings. AMen who run amuck in the style described in our police reports of to-day, in the case mentioned, are dangers to society, and when their hyena-like ferocity develops itself should be placed behind bolts and bars for a lengthened period without delay.
