I cheerfully' comply, with the request in the humble assur ance that your attachment to our be loved Methodist Church needs but the reminder that the set time has come to 'offer unto God thankbgnmg,1 for the desires of your giateful heaits to ciy stalise into deeds of consecrated liber ality. A review of the history*'/, of Methodism at home and abroad, from the days oLJohn W eslev up to the close of the present centuiv, compelb from each devout and Catholic student the glad acknowledgment of the source of its power and the cause of its success. 'This is the Loid's doing, n is mar vellous in our eyes ' Perhaps no bet ter summary could be given Km few words than the one contained m'the fol lowing extract :— In the Eighteenth Century God. sent John and Charles Wesley .'and1- the , daily Methodist preachers. They preached Jesus to: the perishing people; planted the Me thodist Societies; revived the Church of England; roused the Piesb)tenan ism of Scotland; carried hope to Ire land, and new life to Wales They saved the nation from atheism and revo lution. ' In' the Nineteenth Century the Methodist Societies, purified through suffering, and welded together as - a church, have been equipped for a mis sion of world- wide evangelism. As the century closes, the mothei Methodist Church and all the daughter churches of every name, in 'every 'land, dwell to gether in unity. They preach the same doctrine, sing the same h)mns, and en joy the same fellowship Together, the}- number more mifhons than any other Protestant church m the world In the Twentieth Century Methodism is called to do a great woik for this she needs the 'golden oil' of the Divine anointing. It needs also,. as the pro phet saw in vision, the 'golden pipes and bowls and lamp- stands, ' which con secrated liberality can give. For the past, so full of meicy, and 'for. the future so radiant with hope, what can we, as Methodists, do ? 'We will take the cup of salvation and call upon- the name of the Lord ' It was in this spirit that our conference, the first conference in West Australia, held in March last, passed, the following- le ?solution: — ., - - r. That ra the' judgment of this con ference it is desirable to commemorate the commencement of the twentieth century,.? -'lafcd ;-ttie establishment of a separate 'conference for -? West Austra lia in ,igo'b, by raising a special coh nexional fund foi the maintenance and extension of the work of God in West Australia. .

The conference, in determining upon this1 enterprise, affectionately^ urges our people to ~ seek coritempor .ancpusly -with this financial ? effort a renewed and richer outpouring of;, the; spirit of God, that our church in West Australia may be ?equipped for the/gre'at responsibilities and grand opportuni ties which' the new century will brings us in this; great arid growing colony, ?',- ?

While tne conference places the loan and the sustcntation funds in the fore front, prpyision^is made for any donor^ tor'dengnatet his gift for 'the reduction of trust' debts on chuicli or manse pro perties,' or for the erection of 'a college 01 any other object desired. The time allowed for the payment of promises is practically two and a half ) ears from ? July 1, 1900 If, week by week, rich and poof, old* and ydung, will give, ac cording as God has * prospered- them, the^amount that will be raised by the trme'the fund closes m February, 1903, will 'be astonishing, and stand out as A MONUMENT TO ^THE PRAISE AND GLQRY.OF GOD., Special 'attention' is ^ directed to the Historic Roll, which will be 'opened on the first day -of .the twentieth century, and which, wlien completed on,,the last day of the first year^n the new cen tury will contain the names of sub scribers and v'colfectbrs, whethei, mem beis of our churcn^'teacKers'/ or scho lars in our SunUay 'schools,' cotrfmuni cants, seat holders, „ or other woi shippers and adherents, ^-i friends of Methodism \, , ThVre\\*is not an indivi dual who lias', received blessing/ .under God m the'Methpdist Church but 'will esteem it ,.a.nr heritor to^have his 'or her name written on the ' Histonc JRoll. Paients will desire that the names' of their children should1 be con'tainerd in the Historic Roll. Qui debt' of grati tude to the sainted dead, by whom we have been helped and comforted^ will^ find expression in placing their names' in memouam on 'the ^Historic Roll.' Each name on the* Historic Roll will represent at least ^1 given or col lected. Many of our peoplewill not limit their expression of thanksgiving unto God by the 'contribution ' of £1, but will contribute? such a sum as God has enabled them to give, for the main tenancevand extension of His work in West Australia'. ;' Few will fail to raise at least one! pound., but if f aftei steady effort anyone should fail, his 'or her name will not be excluded from the his toric roll. , If, as in -the - days of Nehemiah, the people have, a mind to work, and the Methodist^ are the same as when Dr. Chalmers said 'they were at it — all at it — and always at it,' then the Christian exercise awaiting us will be accompanied by a great and giaci ous revival of evangelical religion. In no land has ' Methodism ' a more open door than in this colony. Her organi sation is adapted to^ the needs of the people; the gospel she preaches m her pulpits is the power of God unto sal vation to everyone, that believeth ; and the fellowship in her 'communion is fel lowship with tne Fathei and with His Son,, Jesus, Christ, our ,Lord and Saviour. The blessings* assumed'1 in the new -centjiry ar'e^mmensely greater than any experienced' 4n the past, and may be ouia by.' Christian k consecration and co-operation m the power of the Holy Ghost, - Let us_hand tocoui chil dren m the coming' centuiy a glorious heritage m Zion, and so' fulfil the words of the Psalmist, 'Ore generation shall praise Thy works to another,-1 and'1 shifl! declaie Thy mighty acts ' _ ~
