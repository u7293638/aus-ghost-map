GOUi) XEtVlPLARTTr , ':r Tothe Editor bftheTasmahiari.' [ :.Sib, — Hiving, .had the , misfortune to meet with an acsident a short time ago, which prevented me from my usual em ployment, I therefore, turned my atten tion, to a circumstauee that took place in the old country, in March, 1874, during the general election. One,. John Piper, Esq.. Grand Chief Master of the Templars. preaohed a sermon to a large congrega tion at Enniakillcn, in the Methodist Cliapel, and.suid tho voice of nature, of history, and divine revelation commanded total abstinence. There was something 10 sinful and wicked in these words, that I resolved to search the Scripture fbr the truth. Thank. God I have had the oppor tunity , of doing so, and. I have gone through: the whole Bible with attention. There are 39 books in the Bible, and there are 33 books put of the 39 which refer to drinking wioe and strong drink, and not one of them is against the use, but the abuse of the same. There, are 76 chapters out of 33 books, in reference to drinking wine and strong drink, 119 verses in 76 chapters, which I produce to' you or any Christian brother from God's holy word. There «re in the New Testament, ? 27 books, and 14 ohepters, and 23 verses, in reference to the. same subject, and only one that speaks against! it, and that is in - 1st Timothy— 'No Bishop to drink wine.' I will quote a few of them for your con sideration, as I cannot write nearly the whole Bible, and Testament in vindication of God's holy, truths, but I will giv^j book, ' chapter and; verse fbr.'the whole Bible and Testament, to prove that the Templars are causing great, wiokedness in denying God's holy word arid authority, and by |l denying . what was sent, for the use j| of mankind, but not abuse— denying 1 the right and privilege to their' fellow- 1 man to take what God sends. . ' , By their tyranny and'persecution, .under the plea of morality, the whole British nation and ' publio Press is against 'their Yankee no tion. Look at the'r lang'uage-hd conduct . in Launcestpn and.Hpbart Town in May 1 15th, 1874, and June 8, 1874. :' Read the \ Cornwall.

I '^The 'templars 'are ''of I Ancient . date, . as; history, informs us. -The first order of templars was founded in 1118byBalduin, second king of Jerusalem. The - templars were numerous in several countries, ; and : they^ came' to England before! 1135. Their wealth having ex -cited ,tha cupidity of the French kings, the \ order was 'suppressed by the' Oo'uncilbf Vierine,, and,, part, of its revenues were bestowed upon ether, girders. In 1312 many of the order were tried, condemned, and burned alive or hanged, . and in 1308 and -1310 the order suffered great perse cution throughout Europe. .The ; Grand Master,- 'Molay,' was - burned at Paris in 1314 ' - The temple in London, was . the dwelling of the templars.- At the suppres sion of the order, it was purchased by the professors of ' '. the common' law, and converted into inns. V .Had the .Templars succeeded in their actions at the election's in 1874, they- would.probably have met with the same.' fate as their brethren on. the continent. .' They had at last to fly to America, 'hence comes ,-: their Yankee notion '? from theirs high.: -? priest. Look ; at their conduct in America in 1873.' ' and ; 1874 ; was that like men of honest and moral p inci pie ; the whole public Press of ; the British Nation condeinned their .',' wicked conduct. ; We nee 3 not go baok , for centuries, to inquire into' their moral qualities, but what are they.at the. present. tirec-^nb better'.. .'.
