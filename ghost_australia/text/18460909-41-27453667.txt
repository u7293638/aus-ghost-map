A GHOST. For some time past the establishment of a linen draper in this city, (Bath,) has been thrown into a state of excitement, in consequence of the unusual (and as yet perfectly unaccountable) noises which nightly occur in one part of the house, used as a sleeping apartment for the young men. They con sist of violent knockings—occasionally the chairs and other articles of furniture will move from their places to the centre of the room. Every means has been resorted to to discover the trick without effect. The principals of the establishment have themselves witnessed this extraordinary case, and used every endeavour to discover the cause, but to no purpose. I have, myself, twice witnessed these strange move ments, and also listened to the noises, but have been unable to discover the canse of these most remark able performances.— Bath Journal.
