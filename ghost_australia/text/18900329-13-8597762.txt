PICTURESQUE VICTORIA. BY TELEMACHUS. DOWN THE GENOA RIVER. I suppose the Queen's writ would run on the Genoa country, but it is a matter of fact that an official cheque of the Government of Victoria wasn't well liked. " we're so awfully far away, you see. It might he months before we got anything for that, and more likely it would get lost through the post" So replied our hostess a little plain surely. But it is just possible that they did not believe in our bona fides atalL I am not prepared to say that some of our elders were at all times so seemly and decorous in their conduct us become their years and their assumption of exalted position. The local schoolmaster, who had written a three volume novel, eyed us a little askance at times And another man said he could swear that our Minister was not Parkes, and if Parkes wasn't Premier, who was ' We did not see a newspaper many house entered, nor yet the faintest trace of the cloven hoof of the book fiend. It is an un- sophisticated people, and yet they rallied a bit when Road red gold was mustered, and give us a cheer as we shoved off, and I think the schoolmaster had serious thoughts of the propriety of starting "God Save the Queen." We wanted a paper with another boot and a good long tow rope so that with its proper accompani- ment our Gaelic might have been better understood, or at least appreciated. Away it went again "Perrin aged Tuiegan O I Birrin eggs Tsisean O The boat goes drifting down the stream, Alas, farewell to Fairly 1 ' And some of the elder folks ashore shook their heads and declared it to be a strange tongue, and rejoiced more than ever probably that their reckoning with us had been for hard, honest coin of the realm. The gentle current helped the scull", and Swiftly, swiftly rowed the boat All too swiftly, surely I Why should we hurry down that lane of sunlight, with its many little bays of placid shadow, its bowers of ferns, and infinite variety of greenery, its perfect solitude and repose ? I do not know where to find another such a spot in all our land, and yet, sliding down, swiftly, swiftly down, we permitted it to pass away from us, never probably to return. " Keep her head out from the bank a bit. "Steer straight, you - ! says our scientific fisherman, without the slightest regard to the fact that a Minister of the Crown is steer- ing, he was casting his flies into the shadows, and speculating still on a basket of fresh water trout. But it was not to be. The Genoa trout would have none of that uncanny tackle, only one coming out and opening his foolish jaw. He was a big fellow, and away went the reel like the propeller of the ship racing in a gale. But he stayed in a while, and, navigating our boat with extreme care, ive brought her round to assist in the process of landing. The gulf was III hand, the reel revolving slowly, the rod bent in a fine curve, when suddenly we were shocked by an expression utterly foreign to the rule of that boat " What's the matter ?" " There's a knot in my line. While we hesitated and marvelled the fish " let go," and a little later the road was put away. Our WHtermnu remarked that he had landed them twice that size with wamegrous and a wattle Buck, and even that was not mortifying to our scientist. When he ceased to fish, however, he would sing, and his singing made us all amends, Swiftly, swiftly rowed the boat, and now again the broader bays began to open, and some thunder clouds rolling up the sky added a mantle of proper glory to the mountains Been beyond the maree. Many a little Meet shone in the mouth of many a little estuary ; shrilling above UB went the whistle of the wild 'duck's wings and never for one minute, I think, did we miss the rise and plush of a big fish. So we came to a point that had no fixed name, but stood out the case of an inlet It was grassy and wattle shaded. Luke like water, broad, deep, clear, and still stretched right before us, and we agreed that it was lunch time Save our own, there was no sign of the presence of any human beings. No house, no fence, no track, no ringed timber in the view. From the fresh charge of the water to the lace like crest of the forest against the sky, all seemed perfect, as completed and left by nature. But nature, in a somewhat uncertain mood, seemed to resent our presence The thunder prowled nearer, the water became even more still, and the forest voices were hushed "There is no breeze upon the farm, No ripple on the lake , Upon her every body the ern, Tilt deer have sought the brake The small birds dare not sing aloud, The springing trout He still. So dark) looms jon thunder cloud " And then it breaks crackle and roar above, a Hash down in the lake's centre, and (later, patter, splash, splash, rush, gush at last, a right honest thunder shower on our green wood table and all its furnishings. Kum at lunch time spoils more than sugar and salt. It has been known to effect tempers ii inn Why couldn't we have seen it coming, and have put off lunch a bit'' And now that at length it was over, had we not better gather up the fragments which remain to us and make down to our night camping place' Buatie row again, therefore. Not more than seven miles to the night camp, and ten down to the heads on the morrow's morn. flashes of sunshine played about the lake with transient steel) gleam, and the clouds broke but to gather again, and the thunder still muttered, and the wind began to sigh amongst the trees ashore. The magpies wouldn't sing for us, but we sang to them, doing even " Mncminons's Lament " "Cha till m% titille, Ged dull," and the rest And our angler hooked skipjack without the rod and warbled Tannahill and Burns, and the water way opened and closed and the balls went past. When at about 5 o'clock our port was reached, the grey was over all, close and chilling, with a faint low moaning sound aroused all the hills, and the spirit of a wet night, evident in the blast It was just the evening when one would have liked to come suddenly round a bend on some fair house front, with warm lights streaming through red curtains, and a wholesome blast of smoke ascending from the kitchen chimney. It would have been good to have come out on the balcony after dinner, and to have listened awhile to the son of the water and the sough of the wind-and then to have made contrast sharp and agreeable by simply drawing curtain or blind We did not find any house at all, but a wattle-bark shed, half buried in the scrub which had risen around it. It had a good iron roof, and plenty of stringybark sheets lying round about. Our watermen had a tradition of a bull who in bad weather made the shed his camping-ground, and our sailor men knew that it would be a bad night, and were in some dread of the approach of the bull. The member for South Gippsland proved himself the hero of the occasion. He, with his boat's crew, set to work on a sort of upper floor, and built a wall on two sides, and swept up the rubbish, and spread some bark and wattle boughs, and made a camp which looked fairly comfortable. But still it seemed a very hard fate to some amongst the company to have both grog and tobacco stopped on such a night and amid such surroundings. Tor there was scarce a pipeful in any pouch by this time, and we had bidden farewell to spiritual comforts on the previous evening They talked, these desperate fellows, of smugglers' camps, of illicit stills, of shanties which exist everywhere, and proposed an expedition into the hills, and actually did set forth with that intent, but pulled up at a hut kept by another ancient just on the rise above the wattle clump I thought at length that we had caught the primal eldest, for he was grey, and wrinkled, and bent, and some more wickedly wise set the forty years' settler to talk with him with intent to settle that point The latest ancient was very deaf and hard of understanding, and while the other piped his questions in a falsetto which could be heard a mile away, he nodded, and winked, and answered, "Aye, aye. He be away-back to morrow night." Encouraged by the evident absence of "He," some of the more desperate of the party entered the home, determining that it must be a shanty, or still, or smugglers'' cave of some sort whose hidden secrets should be brought to light. But when in a little while they came out it was plain that there was no wickedness. Only sugar, soap and candles and tea. The old man did, however, unearth some tobacco, and therein was a measure of contentment. Yet it was not a gay procession which went down the hill Again, albeit with filled pipes. Our men were collecting wood, the sailors still dubious about the hut!. Said the cook, " Will the son of a something" (it was a mis- take as regarded the immediate parents of the bull) " take to drop water'' The answer being no, he resolved to "make his (valley " close to the water's edge, and to sleep there too. The others resolved to make a fire inside, and lie round about And in the meantime some of us did a little more fishing We launched our boat, and hoisted the sail, and drifted about. Two of the watermen got a short sitting net from the hut, and taking it up to a sandy spit tried in hand. It seemed that the whole waters were crowded, for they let nine-tenths of those they fairly took escape, and then brought home many more than we could use. But they would not bite. So ever more dreary became that closing day, and yet we made merry over it ere nightfall. Our rude table was heaped again with fish of the freshest and we had fair stock of tea. The fires began to glow chi er fully, the darkness increased, and in a picturesque way, perhaps, the scene was original and complete. We had a Gre without and a fire within, a half dozen candles stuck about, and looming aloft, in flickering light or dancing shadow, weird forms enough to have satisfied any Dutchman of the time when his nation led art There were two or three groups on the Door. The high substantial beams were magnified, and between the pillars at the rear the fire- light plated fitfully on the wattles, whose heavy foliage, just kissed by the win, bowed like nodding plumes. And now who has a song to sing, O '! And let it be a song with a chorus, and a loud one too. But then piped one and another, but our scientific angler was always the clearest and the best. Yet there were others who did well, and loudly rang the rafters to the chorus of " The Old Bullock Dray " and "The Stockman's Last Bed." The phenomenon of the evening, however, was the minister and his singing. 'J he Minister has a faculty, a fervour, a force in this way, which, if fully developed and properly educated, might even yet change his career. As I have already set forth, he is somewhat remarkable as a poet, scarcely yielding the palm for eccentricity or originality of diction and rhythm to his senior, Sir Henry Parkes. But it is in operatic music that his great find marvellous powers appear. His particular choice is that pathetic solo, " The Heart Bowed Down " But as this muster his expression of emo- tion is delivered by the vocal organs of Mr. Dow one comes to understand that there are lengths and breadths and heights and depths discernible in it, which no artist had before him discovered. There was once an Australian musician who played the music through a wonderful instrument of a strange name, and there is a member of the Victorian Orchestra now who blows it occasionally through the bassoon. But let that strange instrument and the passion and the bass viol also he bent, and they shall not equal the volumes which pour from the lips of the Victorian Minister. " It begins In unknown caverns. Like a voice that chance alone 79 it descends into guttural like muttered thunder, it rises to a roar like all the bulls of BnsliiiD. "The heart bowed down * The fishes cease splashing in the sea, the mopoke calls no more from the woodlands, and every man about the fires rises on an elbow as men who imagine they have been awakened by the first jar of an earth quake. " The heart bowed down own 1 ' a bittern booms in reply tram a distant hidden swamp. A flock of cormorants fly shrieking from a Hnug a half-mile away, and the dead man at the hut above comes to his door and listens He is sure he heard something " The heart bow owed dow own Every man is aloft on his two feet, and many what hat is on the ground thrown off by the rising fells of hair. But just as the roar sub sides, down by the fire on the water there is ft shriek and an utmost corresponding roar, the cook's voice swearing audibly He's on us now ;" and then a great splash. The cook did not, however, go into the water. It was only more firmly monster who had been conjured up. I challenge any man who has ever heard the Mcenister'a performance to say my description is unreasonably exaggerated. After that master strain there was not much disposition on the part of others to make music or possibly to make themselves heard. The frog and the bull fable may have suggested itself to many minds Midnight, moreover, was near, and some amongst us began to ascend to the upper deck. Bulky forms lay stretched in the dull red glow of the fires, and still we talked a little-a little, a very little even when midnight had passed. The stars came out then, for the rain was over, and the night things woke and moved about us, and spake with then many voices. More seemed known and understood than at other times I do not know why. When tales have been told and songs have been sung, and without any sedative or stultifying process, the mask which the world knows for us, but which is not us, has been momentarily cast away-we ourselves seem in humanly bare and sensitive, as probably perceivable. Listen to the innumerable words which seem to move on the broad breast of the water. An hour ago you should have been but as he who "Heard the water lapping on the crag And the long ripple washing in the reeds" But now you have flung your world-winning, your flesh-and-blood fighting weapon momentarily away, and though no white urns arises, and no " three queens" appear, there is com- panionship, there are presence, there are communions.

Sleep at length becomes a calamity " Distempers worBtcalamity " Those whom we would not look upon, could not entertain, would not know, would perhaps remember, runs I Come then ' A lurid light, a trampling throng, House of intolerable wrong, And whom 1 st armed those only strong , Deevlsto he had willett were not held , W Rich all confused I could not know Whether I suffered or I did " My own loud scream Awaked me from that cloudless dream " And then, sitting bolt upright on his rag, I beheld our ancient mariner looking down on me somewhat curiously, His first words were, " I would give five shillings to hear that bull come roaring down through the wattles now." "What for'" " Well, for diversion, Boy " It was true, we allvvn,nted"divnrshinn"badly. The friends we had known further up the river, who could not be kept out by eucalypti extract even, were getting the "diversion, " and making up for the long dull time they had had since humanity last encamped here. One after another of our mutes rose on an elbow or a shoulder with a curse, or a groan, or a protest against such infamous treatment. The fires were very low " down stairs," and a few fitful snores came up We smoked again, and laughed as we thought of the matter if the bull should come. But there was neither full nor bunyip 'twixt that time and the dawning. Some language, doubtless ; indeed, if It had been cold enough to have frozen all the language used that night, and if others had come along when it was " thawing out," like Sir John Mandeville in Nova Zembla (as related in The Tatler November 23,1710),they would doubtless have been much astonished, and may be a little scandalised Up came the morn at length, and up rose all our company without bugle call. And the morning was divine as the night in its later passages had been cannibalistic and diabolical-not a leaf stimme, not a cloud moving and all that broad sheet of water gleaming like polished steel. There was not a ripple, nor such a stir as the stroke of a bird's wing might make Everything reflected along miles of circling coast, and all HO mar seriously fresh and refreshing The perfect atmosphere seems to double all our powers of life and enjoyment, as it doubles the mountains and the forests by their reflections in the water And, like the mountains and the forests, we too soon are reduced to normal proportions by the very earliest encounters with the experiences and exigencies of actual daily life With the angler and his rod I rowed out on the lake before the sun had touched it, right across the steely surface, round about the silent shores , all the woods wet, and all the herbage fragrant with the thunderstorm of the night We peered up little glass, coves, we looked around points which had worn only Nature's garments through all the years, and jet displayed neither read nor better And then we turned back to the camp again, and found all our party preparing for a start The cook and his shipmate were in no mood to stay a moment longer than necessary The Minister was prepared to take his place in the stern sheets, and with his banner Spread (the Birnie he had borne to the summit of Genoa Peak 20 years ago) our Ancient Mariner was moving down the truck. As he came he sang " MaoDow s regal flair from the dark wattle and leg, The bearers are seated timber d are the ii alley 2 Flash ' war axe and broadsword I dare; ' target and quiver 1 MaoSlullaw sings farewell to Genoa for over Farewell oh, farewell, to take, mountain, and liver MaciJow may return but MacShUlew shall never I ha till cha all, else till she fairly , Qui Ullllia MaoDow I did till MacShillaw ' So while it was yet early we rowed away again, and again looked with wonder, and admiration, and love on all the marvellous beauties of these broad waters, and often was the wish expressed and re echoed If they were but within easy distance of Melbourne i The magnificent semicircle of hills just above the arm which makes in towards Genoa Peak seemed even more grand on our return than our upward journey the water was so deep and clear, the hills so richly clothed And inexpressibly lovely looked many a tiny bench, a strip of sand just large enough for a family party, with always the wattle shaded turf above, and generally some heavy, musky gully near by Along many a hank you might now maiden hair fern enough to carpet a church, and I do not think search would be made in vain for those lovely rock lilies which clothe so many foreshores of little coves north of Sydney harbour. Down to the Narrows we pulled, where the hills close in and leave but a passage between the upper and the lower lakes And as we came to the ocean gate of the pass, clear to our ears, in low deep, continuous thunder, came the boom of the surf at the barn sound, it need scarcely be said, which brought various emotions to many minds MacShillaw became Captain Cook again, or rather displayed for more of the spirit of that old hero's mate in his earlier voyages, the unfortunate Captain Clarke Captain Clarke could be very merry at times , so could MucbhilUw and I never knew Macbhtllaw do an unkind thing but one, of which I will tell in the proper place The tide ran strong round Rome of the little islands, and though pulling hardly we made but slow work moment. it but we had not the least desire to hurry The dray was fairer than when we find under entry The islands seemed greener The pale violet or tamarisk hues camp out better on the general grin ti-tree and there were some paling lights in the mists which cloaked the distance Howe Hill, and linley Mount, and Genoa Peak seemed all IIB old trick is now, may we looked at them and at all which lay between their crowns and our gunwale as men look at objects They do not desire to forget Ah I the pity that there should be that roaring bar and SOO miles of water between all this beauty and the port of Melbourne There was our friend of the fish factors, by his smokeless chimney, rejoicing in the prospect of an early departure. I myself would not care to abide for ever be condemned to dwell with his crew There was the second eldest inhabitant awaiting us, for there were the masts of the Lady Loch just seen beyond the sand dunes We made another haul of fish on the inner side of the bench, and in about 20 minutes gathered up two coal baskets of garfish, and then we walked round to our little cove No trouble about landing or embarking to day They were loading a little ketch with the preserved hall, and an ordinary ship's boat was pulled in easily enough by a single hand Our bigger boat Iny away a bit, and our elders were carried out in the familiar surf boat style the rest of on following with boots and socks in our hands, and hearts generally bowed down The skipper welcomed us aboard, and told how he had aimed at 2 on the previous day, and had stood out to sea again at nightfall And so we learned that had we pulls 1 right through on the previous day, we might have been safe amongst our blankets at night, and yet there were some amongst us who declared that they had rather have last nights camp again to night than the broken repose which would be their loton board We took the first and the second eldest inhabitant on board, and the eldest brightened and grew jolly above the incipient roll, and declared that he would go round the world with us for love and for good company sake' But the second eldest hugall to overlay his ruddy countenance with the pale cast which is not all of thought, and to look with anxious eyes to tbet- ompntuon way be both were sent ashore, and with them our plucky and hardy oarsmen, who, indeed, were the sons of the eldest, and natives of these parts " Then up came the anchor and about went the ship And Mt Black came to tell of the new lighthouse, and to speak generously of its designer and constructor, as of men who had planned and accomplished good and enduring work. Mr Black was glad and was sorry that he had not gone ashore with us. But tip saul 20 years under canvas teaches one not to trust altogether to Providence in going into unknown lands. We ran across to Gabo, and made report of ourselves, and had a near look at the Monumental City's obelisk, and the magnificent porphyry quarries, and then headed right about for Corner Inlet And the wind began to blow, and her lady ship began to coquette with the dancing seas, and one after another the weak members other party agreed that it was better-never necessary, but better perhaps to go down behind or to take benches in the smoking saloon I have said the Ancient Mariner was un kind once, under am going to tell the story now. It was early in the afternoon and he wanted to read " Where's that book ' " What book'' I he book I was reading " "Oh I Ht H got it " " He " was a very agreeable member of our party, but in this way week 1 Oh I He held him with his glittering eye for awhile, and then sit down quietly to wait and to watch, saving with an air of grim contentment, "He will soon be sick " Just fancy the refined cruelty of the proceeding, the chin rested on the palms, the eyes fixed, and the other poor fellow slowly collapsing And sure enough at length the book fell, and the Ancient Manner went across and picked it up, RUJ ing by was of solace, "Yes, yes, you will be better lying still ' 'I he wind blew louder and the waves rose higher us night tell till at length there was it merry breeze, which would have filled a great ship's sails and sent her along steady as a rock.
