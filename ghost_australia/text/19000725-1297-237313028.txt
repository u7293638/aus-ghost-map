Discussing llrst the supernatural element in Hamlet, us shown in the Incident of the ghost. Professor .MacCallum Justified It as not unnatu ral to the spirit of the times, as not interfering unduly with the story; but as being a symbolical und harmonious part of the play. From that ho proeeedul to analyse the character of Hamlot. In Hamlet, intellect over-balanced tho will and left him vacillating, ever analysing, weighing, discussing, impotent to act. a man in spite of all his noble qualities, iltted for a place In Dante's circle of cowards in the outer Inferno. Such character was due to his one-sided intellectual development; to his severance from all the in stinctive Ideas of training and education which the moral cataclysm in the palace after his father's death caused: to the wwriness of mind of a disheartened agnostic. The gradual growth of evil In Hamlet's character was the real tra gedy of tlic play; at tin end he was shown as having lost all deliberate purpose, a lazv fatalist. l'rofcssor Mact'uHum concluded with an elo quent eulogy of Shakespeare, and of Hamlet in particular.
