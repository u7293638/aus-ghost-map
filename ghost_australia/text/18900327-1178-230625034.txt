Both the baron and his wifo had -itfjikuess for ho''ug communion with the inhabitants of the " other world," and they made the acquaintance of a Madame Chapitoy and a M. Thouars, who acted as mediums in the stances held in the Chateau of Att- dillon, the country seat of the De Martres. After having removed to Paris the Baron died, and his wife catno more than ever under the influence of Madame Chapitey and M. Thouars, so much so. that she made her will in their favor Both Madame do Martres and Madame Chapitey have since died, ar.d M. Thouars is accord ingly the sole legatee. Some amusement was caused during the hearing of the case by the testimony of M. Pellctier de Martres, who had attended some of the spiritualistic seances, and came to the conclusion that his relatives were mad. Madume Chapitey had mado them believe anything, and passed before them us the shade of Louis the Four teenth, Henri the Fourth, Francis the First; and Napoleon the Great respectively, Madame de Martres closely examining each ghost in the history of its epoch.
