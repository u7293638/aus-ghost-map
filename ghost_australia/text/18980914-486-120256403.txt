A LISTER'S TREACHERY^ ^CTP tho midsummer perfect day ; no one bad Been ^j£&ppointed; ; tha girls were pretty, the nion galHiib, and the linmpais wore known to contain the triumphs of tho village houso wivos' culinary skill. Maude Borrion and her young sister Irma wore indisputably tho .?most boautiful girls present), .Maud 's : affianced, Loigh Raymond, thought, with reason. Ho was a happy man on this fair day, for' Maude had consented to sot an early date for their marriage, and hu wns deeply in love. Maude's face was radiunt, her dark, eyes' sparkling with health and the joy of living, her gay spirits setting the keynote of tho occasion, Pretty Irma was moro quint. She was scarcoly present on tho footing of a young lady, for she was barely 16, and small and shy for her uge. But there was the promise of a superb womanhood before Irma ; her hair was a burnished muss of gold threads .; her great lustrous eyes, full of unfathomable shadows, spoko of a deep, emotional nature ; hor cheeks were like faint pink rose leaves, and ,; 'the exquisite lips seemed to tremble with their own richness of colour. She, too was especially happy, for Leigh had given heir a spray from the bunch of flowers Maude ,, wore at her breast. Siie loved her sister dearly, but did not know why she felt ao blissfully content when Leigh was near. She only know that he would be tho deUrest brother in tho world and that no other man could equal him. No bitterness was mingled with her sweet, unconscious dreams of him, and tho world glowed brightly before her. The 'long, happy day wherein the loves had danced and played' among the villago lads and lasses to the great fluttering of siniplo hoarts, was drawing to a close. The carriages were ranged in line, groups were ''' calling lo each other, and baskets and bundles were put in their places. Heavy clouds loomed up in the West, and the breozo had changed to a. ohill, ominous wind. ' Has anyone seen Irma lately ? ' in quired Maude, looking anxiously around. \- 'And Mr. Raymond —whoro is he?' 'v asked someone. V. 'I think they have gone up tho hill,' said .XEllit Wuite.

Ovor tho Berrien homestead a cloud of anxiety brooded. The storm burst furiously before tho picnickers were fairly sholtored, and a dark, rainy night settled down. Maudo wandered from room to room, hor eyes heavy, the muscles of her face working nervously. Mrs. Borrien sal near the wood lire built for her benefit, weeping softly, while the father-paced from window to window, stopping to gazo from each with anxious looks and knitted brows. Ten, elovon. twelvo o'clock came, and still tho delinquents had not returned. Mr. Berricu summoned his man, and together they drove away in tho darkness and rain lo aid in tho search. The storm had quieted down to adull, steady rain, but tho clouds wore still heavy and low, making tho night as dark as a night can be. In the 'gray morning tho searchers re turned, wet through, weary and sorrowful. .No trace, except a handkerchief of Irma'e picked up in the cavo, could be found of the , absotit onos. Maudo aroused horself to find .fresh mon who would take up tho search, or her father and tho others could do f nothing more until refreshed and rested. . Sho accomplished her purpose, and several , moro weary hours dragged along. Sho had not slept or rested one moment, and still . wandered despairingly from room to room. At two o'clock in tho afternoon a carringo camo swiftly up the driveway.

We found ' our way in. Leigh had matches in his case and he broke up a box and a chuir and soon had a fire in the big fireplace of what had1 been u sitting-room. X hardly know how he inanuged it, hut he collected wood and kept a blazing fire all night, and we got dry and wavni. For tho rain kept falling, and ib w'as so pitchy dark that it was no use to go out again. As soon as ovor it was daylight Leigh ? went to find some inhabited spot, and returned in two hours with a carriage. Wo wont to a faimhousc, where the woman had a good warm breakfast ready for us, and made me lie down and rest for halfan hour while she pressed out my .rumpled gown. Then .her son drove us home in the carriage, and hero wo are, safe and sound, and awfully glad to get home.' Before Leigh could udd a word of ex planation, Maudo said — 'Irma stay hero und comfort poor mamma, who is very nervous over this, Please come into bho library, father — and you, Leigh.' When the three stood opposito each other in the dim room, Maude, looking at them with deep, tragic eyes, said — ' Leigh, you must marry Irma — not mo. Our dream is ovor for ever.' ' What do you mean, Maude ? Have you gone mad, child ? ' ' Father, tell him 1 You know ib must be so. I havon't strength to argue tho matter, but no Berrien can bear disgrace. You have kept Irma away from her homo all night lpng— alone— oh, ib is terrible 1 ' Maude covered her face with her hands, and hor slender form swayed to and fro as though she would fall. Leigh caught her in his arms. 'Maude, Maude I I swear that Irma is-: — ' . ' Don't swear to anything 1' Maude ex claimed passionately.freeing.herself from hit) embrace. ' Tho world will not listen to your vows— no one asks to hear the whole story. It is onough— there is nothing moro to bo said. You must marry Irma on the day you wore to have married me.' Leigh. looked at her as white as a sheet, his hands tightly grasping the chair before him, as if to steady himself. ' Suppose I refuse? ' ' You are an honourable man; You will nob refuse. You and I never can marry in any case.' ' Do you regard this sacrifice as necessary, Mr. Berrien ? ' The father looked grave, and terribly worn and troubled. ' It is an awful affair, Raymond. I do nob see any othor way out of it. Our whole world knows uy this time what has hap pened. I cannot bear that sorrow and disgrace should fall on my little Irmu. Marry her; and for God's' sake be kind to her.' ' And you, Maude ? How can you com mand mo to do this thing ? Do you not love me, then ? ' ' Love you 1 Oh, Leigh, you can never know how dearly I have loved you I ' she cried, with wild oyo. ' But you are mine no longer. You are Irma's. I must bear it — I will ! Good-bye,' Leigh.' I cannot talk no more now.' Leigh gazed Ht hor passionately, sorrow fully, reproachfully. He clasped her in Iub arms and pressed a long kiss upon her lips ; then he turned and went out of the room. ' Go, father, and leave mo alone. I can not havo a word said,' Maudo gasped ; and with a look of the deepest pity he loft hur. An hour afterwards her mothor found hot' JHc-xbj. lying upon bKB-flo?rj£jjjjjj'j^rt-|''0^ less. She' was carriecl' tomrrooiiHua fondly nursed until sleep viaijed her weary eyelids. A deep slumber came at lnst, from which she did not wqke until noon of tho next day. Nevor did a man more gravely propose to a woman than did Leigh when, a week later, he took Irma's hand in iiis own and asked her if sho thought she could be happy with him. ' But you are to bo Maude's husband ; why do you ask me that 1 ' she said in sur prise. ' Maudo dees not want me. Will you be my wife ? ' ' Is it possible you love me ? ' ' Vou are a dear, sweet little girl, and I have a deep affection for you.' ' But it will break Maude's heart. We must not hurt her.' ' Maude will not marry, mo. Tell me, Irma, what your own heart says.' Irma's beautiful faco flushed and paled, and her great dark eyes grow mysterious and full of emotional lights. ' I huvo loved you from the first time I saw you, but 1 thought it was only as a sister. I will do anything you wish.' Ho kissed her then and said no more. The next morning ho went away, nob to return until tho day of tho wedding. Maudo did not leavo her room for several days. When --ho did who was so changed, so wan, that Irma was frightoned. She tried to curcsa her, as in tho old days, bub Maude would nob permit it. 'I havo boon ill, but I shall be well saon. Now I am very norvous. Don't annoy mo.' So Irma wept alone. When she knew that sho, not Maudo, was to marry Leigh, she tried again to gain the old confidence ?BiiiT'sympathy of her sister. ' Aro you grieving because of Loigh, dour -Maudo -V If ho, though it breaks my heart, I will give him up. I do not undor stand why he loves mo instead of you, or why you have changed to him. I love him dearer than my own life, buc I will not como betweon you.' ' Hush, child ! Nover talk to me of this again. You aro to marry Leigh Ruyinond, and that is all there is to bo suid.' Irma shrank boforo tho sub, stern faco so uufamiliur to her, and .suid no more. Sho made a sweet, dangerously beauti ful bride. Hor face, in its burnished frame glowed with the radiance of some other world, and her graceful form seemed in stinct with love and happiness.

Loigh was easily induced to comply.with. their 'wishes ; he cured so little now what hi3 future might be that he was ready to acquiesce in any plan to which Maudo did not objecb. It Was several months before Maude came home. Irma, more boautiful than ever in her new happiness— for sho had missed nothing in Leigh's tender, protecting affec tion — was so eager to meet her that all day long she flitted about like a humming-bird, unable to be quiet a moment. The cold, pale, eleganb woman who stepped from the carriage seemed scarcely the sister she had once loved ; but sho lavished upon her all the caresses she would permit. Maude mot Leigh with a cool smile and a frank hand shake ; not a glance or a word meant for him nlono did he receive. He was not as calm and self-possessed as she, and before the evening was over left the little group abruptly, and did not return before they separated for the nighb. The days went on. Irma, loving her husband and sisier with all her passionate nature, grieved that they wero not as warm frionds as she could wish. She noticed Iheir strange avoidance of each other, their chilly silence when thrown together, and ?believed they must have quarrelled. To each she made her plea for mutual forbear ance and kindness Maude turned upon her that stern, sot look she had begun to fear, and bade her be quiet. 'If you value your own happiness, Irma, let us be as we are. 1 warn you. Never mention our bearing toward each other again.' Leigh grew very pale, and a frown con tracted his brow. ' Irma, you do. not know what you are say ing. Am I not kind to you ? Why trouble about my conduct to others.' ' But I want you to love Maude. Surely she deserves it, and I think she is not happy. Sometimes I have a vague feeling that I have wronged hor, and yet 1 know not how. She said she would nob marry you, and you said the same, and surely if you had not loved me best you would not have married me. Bub be kind to her, Leigh, for my sake ' 'Oh, Irma, you torture me ! Be satisfied with me as 1 am.' ' Satisfied ? I am more than satisfied. I trembleand wonder at my own groat happi ness in being blessed with tho love of such a man. Ah, if you know how deeply I love you, Leigh I You are a part of my very life, and to lose you would be to lose my life ; yet, if ibwere for your happiness to give you up, I would sacrifice my love and my life together. All there is of me is yours, dear Leigh. Your joy is mine.' Leigh looked deop into the wondrous, passion-lit eyes with a touch of tragic mys tery in their depths and inwardly groaned. To have won the love of such a naburo, to doaervo and prize it so little I How sad und perplexing was tho whole web of life I What would be the end ? Irma and her husband were in the habit of riding every fine morning to some spot of inberest. Maude had joined thorn a few times but gavo up tho rides presently, and now they never expected her to accompany them. Bub one morning after the horses were ordered, Irma did not feel well enough to ride, and insisted with pretty petulance thot Maude should take her place. Muudo at last consented, looking pale and cold, but \ery beautiful,, in her dmjjjjhlue habit. ?oiid ap(J|.urec( ta»'ira««ual ltJvaTM!i£d'w1loii It was tho lirsb of many such rides ; for Irma continued to be delicate and indis posed to vigorous exercise. Maude was beginning to lose much of her haughty com posuro. Her cheeks would flush and pala without apparent cause, and from a sorb of cold, tolerant bearing towards Irma, she bocumo alternately tender, solicitous, or irritable. Leigh grew moody and impatient grieving Irma one moment to overwhelm her tho next with caressos ; and the young wife could nob determine whether the two she loved so well wore hotter friends than they had been, or if she had improved matters by throwing them so much together. Tho winter passed, spring was advanced, and soft, summery days were boginning to appear. Irma wasstill not strong, but. very happy. Her trusting nature made its own happiness when those she loved wero no-r ; she saw nothing to trouble hor as long as all was well with them.. That Maude and Leigh ofton rode together now without asking her if she felt inclined to accompany them, ploasod rather than disturbed her ; and that bright, loco May morning when sho watched them ride away, waving hand kerchiefs und kisses towards tier,- she was as full of tho joy of life and love a3 ever, and smilimrly rested on hor couch when they wore out of sight until slumber closed tho beautiful eyes. But tho hours passed and they did nob return. Not until tho day seemed to molt into night's clouds did Irma and hor parents fool really alarmed by their pro longed absence. Something must have happened to keep thorn away thus, and anxiety was at its height when a messonger on horseback from a distant town dashed up to the door. Ho had a lotter to deliver to Mrs. Irma Raymond. She pressed it to her lips and heurt when she saw it was directod in her husband's hand. In her own room, alone, she read tho words on closed, which wero written by Maude. ' Irma, curse 113 and forget us. We have tried to endure und do right, bub the old love, born before your own, is too strong, too ovorpoweringi lima, [ sacrificed my heart, almost my life, in giving up Laigh to you, to save you from even a suspicion of disgrace. 1 meant to bo honourable.

It was this, or death. You will never lipar from us again. Honco forth wo are dijad to all who havo over known us. ? ' Maude.' Thrice Irma's eyes travelled ovor the hurriedly written pngo before she could rculieo tho full meaning of the words. Then, with tho lottor clasped in both hands, and moaning pitifully, sho sank to tho floor — not morcifully unconscious, but unable to move. They found her thoro, and sorrowfully carried her to lied. Heatt brokon her father and mother hung over hor, doing whatever love and skill could ?iugirct for tho suffpror. But ib was of 10 avail, ,-v ) ' Why did ho ir.urry mo, mothor ?'
