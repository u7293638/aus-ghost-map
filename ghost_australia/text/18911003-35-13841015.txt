OPEN QUESTIONS. WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THE CRITICS ? J From the Speaker.) The authors are going to have a nice little club in Piccadilly all to themselves I have heard that critics are to be eligible for it but if this is BO, I do not think that many critics will have to as all themselves of the opportunity Where there are clubs, there are dining-rooms and where there are dining rooms, there are table knives duties cannot be expected to run needless risks Even if there were no danger there would be unpleasantness It is could be trying for a poor little critic to a later the smoking room and to see six others will as archdeacon at their head walk out in disgust and dignity Itaides, enties are not so well paid as authors they cannot afford to dress so well they would probably steal the authors' hats But something ought to be done for the critics The) suffer II "ch First thou serves r offer They have to read horrible stories about murders, and ghosts, and mesmerism lins is rum to the nerves of critics they go skipping lightly through the first volume, fall into something awful!, and are brought home on shudders anybody cares Then, again, their opinions suffer they have their dearest convictions assaulted by a guest car not ols ; Robert Elsmore knocks their creed into space, and Miss Edna Lyall catches it as it drops Lastly, their hearts suffer from lacerations The heroine, iii her simple dies, of some soft while clinging material, makes, perhaps, for innocent little mistake vVo all know what that mistake is the sees through the foliage of the dual) -1 "sited conservatory the hero (it is not really the hero) kissing (if it is the hero he is not re ills ' issuing but remove nig a tip from the cjo) her black tiredness (If it is the here, and horsE losing their it is not the ideal but his own sister) who goes to her room and flings herself on her bed and at last lm Is the relief of tears All this tells on the critics Ihi I want to soothe her and comfort her as to wring her ned or to do something to stop her All this suffering is inseparable from the ent c's regular to work it is obvious that it is not exist why a club which the critics require It seems to be rather a hospital or, perhaps, an asylum It must be some price as here they will be treated kindly and a hero each centre can be kept apart from the rest if they are kept together, they will fight I have a united certain articles on criticism by cities, an 11 find that in all of them the water seems to be trying to say two things especially - 1 II) criticism and French criticism is good 2 The other is bad Now it is clear that critics who disapprove of one another to this extent cannot safely) be kept together That is the advantage of the to) him Each could have a sop into c lies padded cell The authors might provide the p adding out of their books, perhaps But on the other hand, there is the question of expense to be considered Critics, as has been already pointed out are not rich men If the authors provided the paid ling, they might think that they had done enough they are fre- quently inclined to think this A cemetery would be Kept up at much loss not than an asylum There would only be the initial expense for the ground, and possibly some men novelist would provide a little plot It could be planted with wheat and tares wild oats, and other gems The inscriptions would cost very little, because English criticism is so shockingly anonymous and the tomb stones would naturally take U of tons of a broken column There is much to be paid for the project, but it is to be feared that the authors would bring it into contempt They would call the critics cemetery the "Saantsbur)mg Ground," and that would never do.
