THE ABORIGINAL MISSION, FltASJiJl'S ISLAND. The Rev E Fuller has kindly furnished us Maryborough Ch once) with bolero additional particulars of his labors at this spot from the date of our last reference thereto Since that time he has continued holding school among the natives About five w weeks ago a tolerably good number were camped at the mission, hut on February 5 the blacks held a corroboree, when they were joined by blacks from the main land On that day there were about 100 present, and on the following Sunday, in the evening, Mr Fuller was left all alone, for the blacks belonging to the misson went off with the mob who) are now going about the island, something like a circus, and holding corroborees at the various e imping pieces of the natives and horn Unit tune to this only two have been prowling school Of those one can do is tolerably) well in the Now LuBtniucnt Soviiol, after mustering the alphabet and just beginning to loud in the Testament, have left for other parts of the island Of these it certainly may be said, they love to roam," form no one particular spot of the shed do the) st on to stay for any length of time more than whole the mission is located This is their rowing place from the mainland On the other side there is a track is our Mary borough to the water's edge The natives (ohio there mid light signal fires, when those from the island go across in their bark canoes and fetch them over On the other side of the island there is a place they call the " Wow country," 01 " Salt without," whom the mussels 01 cookies, and bulb line, Ac, ino said to be very plentiful, yet even there they do not stay for all) length of time As a rule, thornton! the missionary can do pond only upon those whom he can furnish with employment, and supply with rations ; the others wandal about, of an cessity in search of food the one native who is staying with him now has been stationed) for about three months, he acts as cook, and is also a sort of colleague, as he assists in the school by explain- ing to the other nat li as the meaning of the scripture ilhit'triliono Ha, which are sometimes shown to them He can speak very good English, as well us rend tolerably) well, he is a young man, and cannot very well run away with the other blacks as he has a bad log that almost impedes his n idling about Mr Fuller had another native employed working with him in a piece of ground that he is cultivating, but him he was obliged to discharge some time back for want of sufficient in ions Supplies have, however, since been forwarded from Mary borough, Rockhampton, Brisbane and Ipswich, for which the utmost gratitude is expressed by our correspondent The natives are very fond of singing, and when one or two may be got together, they are taught to sing in their native language "Come to Jesus," or " Jesus died for me, ' Ac, and they will sing when they cannot be induced to do any thing else They are in laughter-loving people, the least thing stalls them off A thrilling mistake at school, or other trivial cause, sets them off at once, and they are often soon laughing and singing under privations that would make a white man green there was one woman that for some consider able time would not let her son attend school, soon after he had learnt his alphabet, and was beginning to mud in the Icstutmont Her reason for keeping him back was. unknown, but one day one of the other scholars returned from Maryborough, and informed the Post that a gentleman up there had good him two shillings because he could road a little in a book This move apparently unlocked the old lady's heart, and she then put missed her son to attend school, thinking evidently that there was something to be made out of it. As a rule they learn just as quickly as the whites, especially when young Mr Fuller is making some progress in the native language, which enables him to explain to the natives when they are sending the meaning of the words in their own language Some of the natives have some very curious notions, and are very superstitious The black who is at the mission now assert that his uncle, who is a doctor among the natives, cannot be killed , he says he will never die, and that he can fly like a bird, or dive under ground and come out at some considerable distance he also has a theory about the Mittance of numerous ghosts (culled Mather) on the island, and huspiomtscd to show them to Mr Fuller some night when he can got another black to accompany him. As regards cultivating the soil, all attempts in this line have hitherto proved a failure Nearly everything that was planted such as maize, potatoes, cabbages, carrots, onions, lettuce, radish, mustard and cress, pumpkins, melons, Accame up, but having got their heads above ground the sight of Fraser's Island seemed to frighten them, and they declined coming any farther, except the maize and potatoes The latter all ran away to top, and left nothing at the root The maize grow up to about half its usual height (and in many instances only about a quarter), and then made a show for corn, but the cobs are small and good for nothing Mr Fuller has sent us specimens of the plants, Ac, after being three or four months in the ground, the stunted condition of which is very remarkable We have also received from him samples of the two kinds of soil of which the whole island seems to be composed-one, a light silvery Band is that which chiefly abounds and another, apparently consisting of decomposed limestone and organic matter, found only in the swamps Its appearance betokens extraordinary richness, and the cause of its blighting effect on vegetation has yet to he found out It is probably due to insufficient aeration and want of drainage A drain, 2 foot 6 inches deep, has now been dug round the ground, and the soil has been once more stirred and replanted, to give it another trial Some of the beds have been manured-a very unnecessary addition, we should imagine Some shrubs and plants from the Botanical Gardens, Brisbane, have likewise been planted in both parts, of which a portion seem to be doing well, whilst others are dying oil If the soil fails altogether, Mr Fuller intends, if he can get a boat, to turn his attention to the sea, and if possible do something in the fishing line For he considers that there ought to be a mission on Fraser's Island, whatever maybe done elsewhere, on account of the number of natives constantly resorting there But unless some means can be devised for employing the natives, so as to put a stop to their wanderings, much success in Christianising or civilising them can hardly be expected.
