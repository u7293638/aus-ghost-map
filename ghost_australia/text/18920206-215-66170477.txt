GHOSTS IN THE TEMPLE. The London correspondent of the fancheester Coulrier writes:-Christmas is undoubtedly the time for ghosts, .and very appropriately a strange story reaches me from one of the Inns of Court. A set of chambers had been vacant for some time; indeed; they had only been tenanted. for. three weeks during the last. six. years. The rent was remarkably moderate, and ti e rooms were comfortable. Accordingly a young barrister took them for a month or so. He never inquired why it was that they had been so long empty, nor had be any.idea that they were supposed to be haunted. He had not, however, been. in possession many days before he announced his determination to qutttherooms, though he had spent a good deal of money in doing them up and furnishing them. His friends naturally asked for an explanation, and he con fessed - that he had seen a ghost, oc rather a collection of ghosts, for every nigh= he said, the door opened of its own accord ansi in walked three men and a woman, dressed in last century costumes. They sat down at the' table, and commenced to talk and to drink. Eventually the talk got louder and a violent quarrel broke out, in the course of which the woman was stabbed. After this catastrophe ghoets disappeared. Such is the most recent ghost story. Eighty- ono per cent. of all public school teachers in thoeUnited States are women, and t is found they make the best of teachers. Some recent statistics in regard to the Japanese House .of Representatives show that of 300 members 13 are baptised Christians. Of those, seven areRardicals, four-belong to the Liberal party,'and two are independents. It is pointed out that these figures dispose of the allegation that missionary success m Japan" is confined to the lower orders.
