P O E T R Y Echoes- OMTXMES when Even's scarlet flag Floats from the crest of distant woods, And oyer moorland waste and crag A weary, voiceless sorrow broods ; Around me hover to and fro And ghosts of songs heard long ago. And often midst the rash of wheels, Of passing and repassing feet, When haJf a headlong city reels Triumphant down the noontide street, Above the tumult of the throngs I hear again the same old songs. Eewtand Unrest—'tis strange that ye, i £ M e apart as pole from pole, 8way with on e Btrong sovereignty The secret issues of the sonl: Strange that ye should hold the keys Of prisoned tender memories. It may be, when the landscape's rim Is red and slumberous round the west, The spirit too grows still and dim, Ajad turns in half unconscious quest To those forgotten lullabies * That whilom closed the infant's eyes. And maybe, when the city mart Boars with its fullest, loudest tide Ahe spirit loses helm and chart, _And on an instant terrified. Has fled across the space of years To notes that banished childhood's fears. We know not—but 'tis sweet to know -Dead hours still haunt the living day, And sweet to hope that, when the slow |Sure message beckons us away, The Past may send some tuneful breath lo echo round the bed of death. —L. J. Q. in Chambers' Journal.
