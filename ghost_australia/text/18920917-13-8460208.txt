THE UNIVERSITY AND ITS INFLUENCE. The following is the address delivered by Mr. J. T. Collins, M.A., LLB.. prelector, at the annual meeting of the Trinity College Debating Society on July 18, the subject being '. The University of Melbourne and its Influence on Victorian Life." He said: It used to be the custom in the Dialectic Society for the prefects to address the annual meeting on some subject of University interest. For some years this practice has not been followed. I have ventured to return to it, mainly because for nearly 10 years my work has been done in close connection with the University. There is also an appropriate- ness in doing so on the present occasion, because of the interest which has been awakened in the tercentenary celebrations of a University to which we are deeply indebted. We have been reminded that Trinity College, Dublin,' has given us three out of five of our chancellors. This meeting emphasises the fact that this society, which has done me the honour of asking me to address you, is founded on the same lines as the famous Historical Society of Trinity College, Dublin. It is unfortunate that sir Henry J Wrixon, who was to have been one of the speakers this evening, is unavoidably absent. For he was once the protector (or as it is called there the auditor of that society-and was also one of the very first students of the University of Melbourne. On the subject of the influence of universities generally it would be almost impossible to say anything which has not been better said before. But we are here working out for ourselves, under exceptionally favourable conditions, new forms of political and social life, in a country whose history is yet to be made. And since, as Lowell has well' said, " The measure of a nation's true success is the amount it has contributed to the thought, the moral energy, the intellectual happiness, the spiritual hope and consolation of mankind and there is no other, the consideration of the relation in which intellectual forces are to stand to our national development is undoubtedly of great importance. We may do well, therefore, to consider how far, and in what directions, our University which is the centre from which these forces radiate-is contributing towards our own truest success as' a. nation : what have been the results of its a nation ; what have we are creatures as in past efforts, what is its present position, and what the problems it will have to solve in the future. It is by no means easy to define accurately what a university is. The term " Univer areas " originally meant nothing more than a corporation, without any reference to educa- tions meaning which it still retains in some current legal phrases. But it has come to be used almost exclusively of educational institutions. It is however, applied to a perplex- ing number of such institutions. The Americans are the worst offenders in this respect. Bryce, in his American Commonwealth, tells a story which will illustrate this. He once met in America a certain Mr. Johnson, who was introduced to him as the president of a university there. Mr. Johnson was evidently a man of very sanguine temperament. He talked incessantly about his university, and the faculty which constituted its staff. Bryce asked at length-" What is the strength of your faculty?" Johnson replied with some show of hesitation, " Well, you see, at present weare rather undermanned. It consists of Mrs. Johnson and myself !" So far there are no universities of this type in Australia. History will aid in the attempt to describe the functions of a university. The growth of universities, in the modern sense, dates from the twelfth century. They owed their origin to the outburst of intellectual activity which marked its close. It was then first that certain privileges were conferred on various associations of students notably at Paris and Bologna. These students had come together urged by an increasing thirst for knowledge, attracted in most cases by the fame of some great teacher, stimulated by his presence and personal influence, and feeling almost instinctively that they could attain the best results if they worked together. As the numbers of students increased, patrons were found to endow halls and colleges for their accommodation, to pay instructors, and to furnish needy students with monetary and other assistance. Gradually the universities grew, fortified by privileges and immunities, till they I Families positions of influence and power- I reaClieU JJ WWa Ul will move,, I use, such as Oxford and Cambridge hold to day Thus the term acquired the meaning of an association for educational purposes What were the characteristics of their teaching' At first they taught in the main philosophy and logic That is to say, their teaching was that of general principles rather than details It is very necessary to bear this in mind if we are to form an adequate conception of the proper work of a modern university Further, every advance they made was due to their anticipating and pro viding for the intellectual necessities of the time It was thus they attained their greatest successes On the other hand, whenever they drifted away from the living intellectual forces of any period then influence waned in proportion Their work degenerated, and became fruitless and burren whenever the subjects they taught were not living subjects, taught in a living manner, and bearing directly upon the life of the time, their late stagnated also So that instead of widening the mental horizon, and strengthening the mental powers they tended only to narrow to weaken and to fetter the minds of their students They lost their N real hold on the intellectual life of the community Mark Pattison has said that for this reason Oxford ceased to be really a university at all from the reign of Henry VII down to the beginning of the present century And what was true in that case is trucc,ciierAlli A university, then may be described as an association for the promotion of the highest intellectual pursuits affording opportunities for study under most favourable conditions to a body of students supplying the best teaching in the highest branches of learning teaching everything in a broad scientific or philosophical spirit and aiming at making its "ruchings scholars and men of culture in the best sense not mere Yam pi hints but men of catholic sympathies, broad views, and sound judgment those able to under stand and estimate at their true worth the various forces at work in the society of which they form part This description will include every kind of university except those- like the older University 01 I endorse Inch exist only is examining bodies What are the means which a unit rsity uses to attain the ends indicate I * They are mainly the following sIts direct teaching I and the indirect influence it exerts, such as the personal influence of its teachers the contact of student mind with student min 1 and the associations of the place itself Its very existence implies that it affords oppor tunities for the prosecu- son of studies That our own University dates its origin from so early a period in the history of the colony as the year 1864 shows that the men of that time recognised the great benefits which would result from the testing of m tellectual pursuits in our young and ever ex paneling community The liberal' grants which the state makes towards its support confirm that view Since its foundation it has attracted to itself a constantly increasing, number of students Lost by car or attended its lectures Its era in rates will soon number 2 000 Though it I labours under the dismal vantage of being set in from the intellectual centres of the oil which it has striven to keep abreast of the low and movements in sen nee and thought there uni may certainly claim a very creditable measure of success 1 of example its laboratories are said to be the finest and best equipped south of the equator and to compare very favourably with those of the old world itself And again one has but to recall the world w i le fame of Dr Heurn-to speak only of those who are no longer with us too assure of this There can be no doubt that there are among its present sense of teachers those whose work in science and literature will also hand down its n une to future several tions The University throws open to all students without any restrictions as to religious class or sex its lecture rooms its hor tries its laboratories It urges them to accept its invitation It undertakes to furnish them the best help in the prosecution of their studies which can be had in the colony It seeks to have the direction and control of their work during the years of their student ship It is unfortunate that at present its control must practically cease there Owing to a 1 lamentable want of pence it is rarely able to retain its stu ments after graduation Consequently lt cannot give them any means such as there are in many older universities of following out their special studies further or of doing original work under its guidance Has is a most serious drawback It really cripples the University in what should be one of its most productive fields of usefulness As soon as a student takes his degree in arts medicine law or any other school he is as a rule forced to begin the practical work of a profession to make J. living But as it is only at the end of his course that he could begin with advantage special work of an original character, no student could undertake such work for any length of time without Home means of support. Various remedies for this might be suggested The endowment of half a dozen fellowships for the express purpose of encouraging research would act as a great stimulus These might be founded in the University itself or, still better, in the colleges Men could then carry on their work and at the same time reside in the midst of the most favourable surroundings Again, the appointment of demonstrators or lecturers in the University and the colleges might sometimes be made on similar conditions At all events till something more is done to encourage systematic work of an original character the University will be unable to fulfil one of its most useful functions We shall see more clearly presently what is the influence of the University upon students during their undergraduate career Here let me say in passing that there seems a great deal of haziness and most injurious misconception in the minds of the public as to what the demands of the university course are It is not sufficiently recognised that its work is of a very different order from that of a school 1 he fond parent whose precocious son or daughter has been able to pass the matriculation examination at the early age of, say, fourteen, in some half dozen subjects chosen tit haphazard, too often imagines in the simplicity of his heart that therefore he or she is fully prepared to enter upon a university career No more disastrous band could well be made ' 'The University is no place for the infant phenomenon " Its work requires a certain amount of preparation and mental fitness If these an absent-as they too frequently are the result can only be disheartening failure, an inability to grasp and keep abreast of the work to be done-and consequent heart burning and bitter disappointment A year, or even two years, after passing matriculation, spent at a good school in acquiring a familiarity with compulsory subjects, such as Greek, Latin, and mathematics would be an minute gain to every student The sooner this is recognised the better The proposal of the Professorial Board to raise the age of entrance from fifteen to sixteen is certainly a step in the right direction It will, at least press upon the consideration of parents the above facts It is quite unnecessary to point out how advisable, for these and other reasons, such a change is in the case of students entering for medicine was ,, " or " »,", ",",. "F a," year of " What in the character of the work of a university' It supplies the best teaching in the highest branches of le young It is not my intention to discuss the relative merits of various subjects us means to education, though such a discussions interesting enough in itself. It is of more importance, for my present purpose, to consider the spirit in which these studies should be carried on I have said that a university should teach everything in a broad, scientific, or glucose placed spirit Let me explain tina A university is by no means a technical school -nor is its aim primarily to be the door to the professions, though it is well that every professional man should have the advantage of a university education It is not the place where the practical details of any pro cession are to be learnt These can only be acquired thoroughly in the actual experience of professional life Its business, on the other hand, is to send forth educated men with their mental powers be developed that they may be able to bring to bear on their work whether it be that of scholarship or science in the strict sense, or the everyday work of a professional man-a Scientific or philosophical habit of mind The terms are for this purpose synonymous An illustration will make this clear The savage is thrown into a paroxysm of fear by a total eclipse of the sun He n guards the appearance of a comet's predicting some gieatcatastrophe We, however can smile at his ignorance Why » Because we know these things in their true relations Vic- understand their causes, and can calculate their occurrence with us failing accuracy, whilst he looks on them as phenomena standing apart from other sphere menu So is it in all else The man of seven title habit only c mines this still further He seeks to regard everything in the same way to assign to it its proper place in the order of things Thus he gains a correct and not a distorted conception of it Further he does not rest till helms arrived at facts These lie investigates for himself, weighing them carefully and accurately He hears gladly the views of his opponents He keeps his judgment in suspense till he has heard the evidence In developing such an attitude of mind among its graduates, the university is doing its best work for the community at large This spirit it should aim at cultivating with regard to the higher intellectual concerns It should map out the field of knowledge, and tench the proper relation of one branch of learning to another and in the same field of investigation, should show the relative importance of its several parts In short, it should inculcate method rather than details, principles rather than \- ... m. , a " , as a" ,n " a, "" practice W herein the man of true culture differs from the man of only practical know- ledge is in the appreciation of principles which the former has and the latter lads It is just the difference between the cultured jurist and the attorney s den! who can only draw a good bill of costs No one will deny that there is most urgent need for men or the former class in every department of our national life The most casual observation will convince us of the in stability' of our national temper Perhaps it is an inheritance from the 'evens excite ment of the said days Perhaps it is due to our youth as a pi one in a period of prosperity we are whirled along on a wave of extra INaeatit-almost criminally extravagant speculation Ni hen the inevitable reaction follows we intensify our misfortune by equally extravagant bewailing of our fate J veil our generous impulses are similarly affected We are tempted to rush into schemes for the relief of distress without due consideration of the causes of the evil and the probable results of our well meant attempts to remedy it Our great need is men of broad views and calm judgment men who will not mistake words for things, fancies for tradesmen who will seek to find the causes of social phenomena and be fully alive to the results of the means suggeste 1 to deal with them Let us consider now some of the more important of the indirect influences of the University And first the personal influence of teacher upon student. It was decided at its foundation that our University should be a teaching university and not merely an examining body Obviously then its success or failure will depend very largely upon the success or failure of its teachers It is to day is it was in the earliest times the i teacher who is really alive to his work-who can make his subject live before the eyes of his students-who is able to fire them with some of his own contact. ous enthusiasm will be the successful teacher With such men as professors and tutors there would be no doubt of the generous enthusiastic support of students The ile ii teacher would be a man keenly sensitive to all the developments of thought in his own department ever on the alert for the v ideas reply to assimilate them able to square them so as to stimulate inquiry and not to deaden research present met J his students the latest results of an investigation if only an 1 can hardly not as the ad vocate of any particular school of thought nor in any spirit of proselytising but so astound them to judge; of the CN evidence for themselves and arrive at well thought out conclusions . with it, a man with some appreciation for the work being done in other departments than his own His personal influence will have great weight His student comes to him with a mind open to receive impressions, with a deepening sense of infinite possibilities opening out before him What will he carry away from his lectures ' Soon, in active practice of his profession, he will have forgotten the details of his text books What will remains The effect of that quiet, almost imperceptible, but powerful influence which one mine exerts upon another More his teachers men of lofty ideals, devoted to the pursuit of truth, fair minded, courteous in dealing with opponents, thorough in their work, recognising a higher test of success in life than the mere acquisition of wealth then will their influence remain with him, a more precious and enduring possession than any book learn ing If they were not, he will suffer no injury proportionate to their departure from this ideal The teaching of the colleges differs some what from that of the University professor in being more tutorial in character There is in it more scope for attention to the needs of individual students It certainly supplies in this way an element which is necessary in the majority of cases for a thorough grasp of any subject The colleges are able thus as in so many other way s, to render a valuable service is becoming in the dutiful daughters of a noble mother The direct reading of the University and the personality of its teachers by no means cover all its modes of influence There are many others 1 foremost comes the contact of student mind with student mind As one stone is polished by rubbing against another so are the needs of men There is that in the constant interchange of thought, in the companionship m study with others in much the same stage of mental development is himself, which gives to a man a polish and refinement, a readiness in grasping new ideas and expressing his own and a tolerance to the opinions of others which nothing else can give 'the need of this fellow ship was early felt, and it has been a marked feature of University life It extends far beyond intellectual sympathies The personality of there richer determines largely the mental development of the student The influence of his fellows is also a power ful factor It is of different kind Student is more on an equality with student One am therefore express his thoughts more freely and unreservedly 'the experience of being closely associated with men whose high motives ona sincerity or purpose we cannot fail to respect yet whose opinions are often diametrically opposed to his own is a valuable lesson in toleration the more valuable because it comes at a time when his mind is expanding under the impulse of new ideas and before his opinions have become hardened by the associations which his professional life will inevitably tend to form The man therefore who only comes to the University to hear lectures and then leaves it who stands apart from his fellows who joins in none of the movements which would tend to destroy his sense of isolation can never secure for himself the results of this influence Such a man-and it is a deplorable fact that there are such-fills to realise that he is a member of a community of learning He feels none of the inspiration of that public spirit which is no less the mark of the tooth student than of the good citizen He regards the Shop as be calls it, as a place where he may purchase just sufficient knowledge to enable him to pass muster at the examination which looms before him His motto is. Every one for himself He never learns from his student life one of its best lessons that No man liveth unto himself there is no doubt which of the two is the better principle for the proper discharge of his subsequent duties as a citizen Every attempt made to destroy this selfish feeling and to draw student- more i closely together for some good purpose is a distinct gun to the student to the University and to the community and should meet with a hearty response in this direction the Niinous stn lent societies should make them selves most felt Unfortunately, amongst men students except where as in the medical school their work necessarily throws them more together the history of such societies is somewhat melancholy J he Uni versal continues us Professor Strong,, once said to be haunted by the ghosts of dead societies With women students it seems different at least so much one may infer from the brilliant gatherings at the Princess Ida At home 1 here are the only occasions which afford the uninitiated male being an opportunity of ju Igmg It is in fostering this spirit that the colleges are doing yeoman service By giving students the ads intuya of residence timing their University career they bring them into the most intimate relations with el cb other they afford the best means of cultivating the lies that the individual should be for the community there can be no doubt that rli-trnrmirlp for MP it till the it of the 1st they prove me for the utilisation of the DISC kind of university life It is but right to remember that Melbourne students are deeply indebted for this to the exertions of the present Warden of Trinity Under his guidance, trinity was the first to demonstrate that college life was possible for them He watched assiduously over the early growth of the first of those fan trees, whose fruit we are even now beginning to gather, and whose ever spreading branches will continue to offer a kindly shade to future generations of students The religious bodies have acted wisely in founding and maintaining these institutions They have conferred a great benefit upon the community They have secured a great benefit for themselves. The good resulting to themselves would be difficult to estimate Only the other eley a clergy man occupying a responsible position in this diocese, himself a graduate of Trinity College, spoke warmly of the advantage his residence there had been to him His association with men training for the other professions-the genial good fellowship he had enjoyed with them had left upon him a lasting impression, extending the range of his sympathies, and fitting him the better for his work there is no doubt that clergy men so trained will have a dinner held on the members of the community where their lot is cast Further the e burches gain by thus showing an active sympathy with the spread of " true science and liberal learning At the same time, in the colleges they are directing the minds of students to interests higher even than intellectual success-interests which the University itself, being a secular foundation, does not touch Thus they must and do tend to attach to themselves with grateful recollections many a man who might otherwise have been lost to them in all the ways they are rendering valuable service to the colony. Nor is it the least of such services that college life teaches a student, better than any thing else can, that the very existence of any society depends upon its members working harmoniously for the good of the whole and not merely for their individual advantage Every thing in a college career tends to foster this feeling 'Hunty College is to be congratulated in the fact that it offers to women students, in its hostel, the same advantages as to men within its own walls advantages of which women students will not be slow to avail themselves when once they have realised them It should not be long before the success of Girton and Newnham m Cambridge should be matched by the proportionate success of Trinity Col- li ge Hostel 111 -U Jim r w la IT. letter", P rlnti mill Vfft ...

At present women students form a considerable part of the undergraduates They are entered for all courses except engineering and law Doubtless they will soon be attracted towards so congenial a subject as the latter with the result, let us hope, that there will be many on "final gamation of the legal professions not contemplated by the recent act The higher education of women, however, is still in the experimental stage The quest tion of its ultimate result (has yet to be answered Will it continue to mystify the gloomy anticipations of its opponents ' Or will it tend to destroy those special traits of character which are the charm of the fairer and gentler sex ' Surely not there is Edis attractively feminine way of regarding things which no learning will ever eradicate "Women will remain women in spite of the higher education Nay, rather, that education will but serve to enable them the better to fill their place in society, and to discharge the duties of life I hot softening, refining, and humanising influence, which is their prerogative, will be strengthened and deepened by the attraction of new interests, the opening out of new fields of thought, and the widening of their intellectual swamp others I have already pointed out that the vigorous life of the University depends upon to I " nit Mnsolv i connects it with the vital Icctual movements of the time, and anticipating an I providing for the intellectual needs of the community That the Universities of England have come to recognise this may be seen in the success of the University Extension movement No longer remaining loftily apart, shut up in their own selfsulhcitnci, they have heartily entered upon a scheme of what might well be called intellectual missionary work 'He reproach can no longer be levelled at them that " the universities, securely moored, bene only to show the rapidity of the current by which the other part of mankind is being carried along " The praoticttlbeginningof the movement was made in the yeurlSt.7, when Professor Stuart gave a course of lectures to women at Leeds and other centres It is noteworthy that it was set on foot by women, and has been largely supported by them. It has been marked by a wonderful development Duringthesession 1889 90 no less er than 177 courses of lectures were given in 26 different centres, with a total of J7'l,J77 attendances The beneficial influence on the people and the indirect benefit to the universities would be difficult to estimate the movement is due to the necessity felt for extending the higher education to those who have no opportunity of attending the great seats of learning The students cannot come to the University, so the University goes to the students This necessity results from the spread of cherries tary education and the existence of libraries in the larger centres of population Men engaged in business, Indies with time at their disposal, artisans and working men anxious to improve their education, are those whom it has sought to reach Recognising that " a little learning: is a dangerous thing," it has tried to turn that little learning to good purpose by offering help in the pursuit of favourite studies and guidance in the choice of works to those who have felt sore need of it By no means the least gratifying of its results has been its tendency to break down class prejudices and to strengthen the hands of sympathy between one class and another by the enthusiasm of common intellectual interests In one examination, for instance, the highest place was taken by a working miner and the next by the daughter of a wealthy manufacturer, the MP for the borough 'The enthusiasm with which the working men of England is INe taken up the movement is marvellous One of the most interesting books I have read for some time is Roberts v Eighteen Years of University Extension It is full of instances of self sacrificing devotion to the cause of education sacrificing devotion to mc cause of education which would put most of us to shame. I cannot forbear quoting one typical case. There are numbers of them Owing to a disastrous strike the courses in a mining centre, Buckworth, were threatened with extinction A student, writing in the bitter- ness of his health, said I feel as if I had been a prominent member of a highly civilised community and a horde of barbarians had broken in and swept everything before them. That ennobling and inspiring spectacle of so many pitmen listening intently, after a day's ii work in the pit, to a Cambridge lecturer, may not be seen again All the generous enthusiasm which working men could display at the prospect of a real connection with the grand old University of Cambridge may not again be displayed Our class may not for some time enjoy the company of those who linked up to the outer world and made us share nuts joy s and sorrow s " Some of the students, however, struggled on A Mr. Edwards, a hard-working miner, himself in poor health, conceived the idea of raising funds by means of an exhibition He procured a printing press, composed, printed, and distributed his own circulars, carried on all the correspondence and organisation, and cleared a sum of all, with as high a new course of lectures was arranged So far our own efforts in this direction have been met with gratifying success. But practically no response has come from the working men They should benefit most by the movement Shall it be said that the working men of this colony, who lost their shorter hours of labour, their easier conditions of life, will allow their brethren in England to excel them in devotion to the cause of higher celtic tion and their own truest welfare ' Shall it be said of them that wisdom cried without, uttered hen OHIO in the streets, but they set at naught her counsel' It is impossible to believe that they will allow this reproach to rest upon them Their present inactivity must be the result of their not having grasped the full value of the gift which the University offers them Once that is been the difficulties should be as easily surmounted lure us in England. The good done by the movement is main fest however, it is still on its trial The " lions in the path " are formidable They are two One, the unsatisfactory method of proceeding without reserve funds-the having to live, so to speak, from hand to mouth , the other, the difficulty of securing the advantages of continuous and systematic study. There is some danger of tin movement de- generating into a mere tickling of the intellectual palace by the succession of a variety of ..in.l.uraimnpil In the popular taste and ory lands seasons l to the popular taste, and a disregard of the good wholesome brown bread of continued intellectual effort but if the movement has in it as it seems to have the element of permanence, these lions will be found to be chained The state secures to every one the preliminary education there is a felt want among various classes for some higher education the University is able and willing, to supply the want It has now and will continue to have in the future men of the right stamp as lee turns All that is needed is a cordial response on the part of the community 1 here are many other topics in connection with the University on which I should have like I to speak but I have already sufficiently taxed your patience One word more and I shall have done It has been my car flavour to trace out briefly the main lines of the influence of our University and to indicate some of the problems before it We are laying the foundation of a new national life under the fullest possible conditions Our responsibilities are correspondingly great It is with us to say what our own future shall be Shall we become a people wearing only for the accumulation of riches and neglecting the things of the mind Or shall we give these too their rightful place in our national development Are we to be content to judge, of our success by the amount of our exports by considerations of pounds shillings and pence merely Or shall we recognise a higher standard than those Jo such questions our University will have much to sayin answer And the answer will be given by its graduates who are already to be Shun i holding some of the highest and most responsible positions in every department of the state there is a grave danger in our time and in this community of trying everything by the test of a short sighted 1 utility which looks for immediate results There is a grave danger of our worshipping at the shrine of material pre sp up There are grave dangers from the instability of our social temper We are too apt to rush into extremes to be misled into sudden and violent political and social changes by the importunity of loud sounding but empty words There is a grave danger of class I cine set against class what can the University do to counteract this It can do very much indeed His the mind of the nation Let it see to it that the nation thinks clearly and soberly It is the fountain from which flow streams of thought permeating the whole land Let the four Men, then, be pure '
