EXTRACTS. INCOME AND NUMBER OF THE CLERGY. The total net income of the benefices of England and Wales is £3,055,451; calculating the 178 benefices not returned upon the average of those which have been returned. Of these benefices, 297 are under £50 per annum; 1,629 betwixt £50 and £100-, 1,602 from £100 to £150; making 3,528 living under £150. Of the other benefices, 1,354 are £150 and under £200; 1,979 from £200 to £300; 1,326 from £300 to £400 ; 830 from £400 to £500 ; 954 range betwixt £500 and £750 ; 323 betwixt the latter sum and £1,000; 134 are from £1,000 to £1,500; 32 arebetwixt£l,500and£2,000; and 18 upwards of £2,000. In the latter class, one is the Rec- tory of Stanhope, in the county of Durham, of the net annual value of £4,813 e, and another is the Rectory of Boddington, in the county of Cambridge, of the net yearly value of £7,306. The annual average income of each benefice, as appears from the table, is £285, but as many as 8,972, or considerable more than four-fifths of the whole, do actually range betwixt £50 and £500 a-year-the average being a little more than £200. Deducting £424,519 for 5,227 curates, after the rate of £81., it will reduce the average income of the whole incumbents to £21 i per annum for each. And it should not be forgotten that the income of clergy, the aggregate of which is £3,055,451, is not derived from tithes merely, but includes all their receipts and emoluments, voluntary and legal. Only about two-thirds of the lands of England and Wales are the able nor does a tenth or even a fiftieth part of the produce of the entire country fall into the bands of the Clergy, if the annual value of the agricultural produce of the kingdom be rightly estimated, as it has been of late, at £150,000,000. The Reports of the Commissioners upon Ecclesiastical Revenues (from which the above table is compiled) have tended very much to disabuse the public mind of the erroneous views produced by the statements of various writers respecting the enormous revenues of the Bishops and inferior Clergy. " Black" and Red books, &c;, have represented the Revenues of the Church as amounting annually to eight, nine, and even ten millions. As specimens of the wilful and wicked exaggerations of these writers, it may suffice to say, that by one of them, the Bishop of Winchester is said to receive £90,000 per annum, and the Bishop of Lichfield £1,923 is magnified to £12,590, with 48 livings! Another writer upon tithes is pleased to tell his readers that if tithes were abolished, the State would be able to remit twenty-one millions of taxation ! The whole amount of tithes paid to the Clergy during a year when wheat was £3 18s 3d per quarter, was £1,426,527 18s Old. John Bull. When George III. was being proclaimed throughout Ireland, the Captain of a Yeomanry corps in a southern county, anxious to evince his loyalty, turned out with his raw material' in the market-place, to burn the quantity of powder prescribed for such occasions. The preliminaries went off in good style. The carry arms,'. ' prime and load,' we, were faultless. Expectation was on the tiptoe for the finale, when lo ! the gallant Commandant, to make the thing more impressive, substituted ' Fire a volley,' -for the solitary word that usually trod on the heels of Present. He spoke to an auditory thoroughly Irish and confident that' Ire a vanilla (off with it) was the order of the day, accord, "ghost they pelted, with shouldered arms and charged fossils,' under the impression that the noble Captain's command was obeyed to the very letter. HARMONIC The Dispatch speaks of a vocalist who sings so high in some of his embellishments, that it is necessary to let go his suspenders before he can get down again, STRANGE in FRYER-The Picayune tells us of a man who told so crooked a story at the Police Office that his tongue turned into a corkscrew.
