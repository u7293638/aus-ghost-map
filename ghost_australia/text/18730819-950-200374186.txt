A Ghost. The Melbourne correspondent of the Bendigo Advertiser says - " A story comes to my knowledge which bordete on the mysterious, but perhaps the spiritualists may yet find it out. My informant, a respectable tradesman o t JFitzro y, alleges that some few nights since he became aware that something was moving about in his house,, but remarked at the same time the peculiarity that his dogs, contrary to their usual wont, took no notiee of it. He rose, lit a candle, and went about the house, and in one of the doorways he saw an old woman or her wraith, the said old lady when in the flesh (she died a short time since) having inhabited the room. She stretched out her hand, and said. 4 Murder ! Murder ! Murder ! ' with a peculiar burr, as in life. He declares solemnly that this was no dream nor mental illusion whatever, and that he immediately searched and sounded the room, and the next morning took up tho flooring but found nothing. The s' ory having got currency, some of the progressive spiritualists interviewed him, aud believing there must be some thing in it, they nave hired the room where the old lady is said to have " revisited the glimpses of the moon," but after two or three nights watching have retired, the defunct nob having again vouchsafed te enter an appear ance."
