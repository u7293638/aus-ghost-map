HALL v. ROSSI ESQ. AND OTHER MAGISTRATES. Supreme Court, Wednesday. Present the three Judges. MR. KEITE rose and informed the Court, that Mr. Wentworth could not attend in the case of E. S. Hall v. Justices Rossi, Bunn, Wolston- craft, and Browne Esqrs, hut that he attended in lieu, to hear their Honors' decision. His Honor the CHIEF JUSTICE then sta- ted, that himself and learned Coadjutors had maturely considered the case of Hall V. Rossi Esq. and other Magistrates, and were unanimous in their opinion, that the rule should not be granted. And as His Honor Mr. Justice Dowling had had the goodness to commit to paper their opini- ons, he would read the same. Mr. Justice Dowling then read the grounds on .which the rule was refused. The 'Court. he observed, on a former occasion, had decided, that the conviction of E. S. Hall in the case of Tyler could not be held in law. It was now for the Court to decide on the merits of the application for a criminal information against the fMagistrates who had presided on that occasion. The Court deeply lamented the necessity of their openly discussing the measures, which had been adopted by the Magistrates, but at the. s.an?Q time would not shrink from its du'y. The conviction was alleged to have proceeded from motives of corruption and malice on the patt 'of the Magistrates; they were also charged with having treated the de cision of this court with contempt. Their lIonaro had kept distictly in view the al legation of malice in the Conviction of Ir,. Hall; the charge of contempt was a matter for the Court itself to take cogni sance of, The Magistrates in the execu tion of the dtutics of their office, if they conscientiously performed that duty, were protected by the laws of the land, but, if they wilfully acted in opposition to the Inaws they would be punished for their offence. It was requisite that a distinct case should bo made out of malice in their proceedings ; and the Court was of opi nion that this had not been so fully done il the present case, as to warrant their granting the rule. In taking cognizance of the case at all, the Magistrates had un doubtedly overstepped theirjurisdiction, andi in deciding upen it, they had treated the deciion of the Court with contempt. It nmunt have been malpifest to them, that there was a claim of property set up, Which was beyond their jurisdiction. This tvas distictly laid down in Burn's Justice, '?hich authority the Co..rt ?ust suppose they were acquainted with. Ii was staied, that no objection had been taken to the power of the Magistrates to act in this case ; but the defendant Hall in his affi davit stated, that he appeared before the Magistrates in person, and most distinctly informed them, that they would exceed their Jurisdictiou in taking cognizance of it ; and the Bench if they had paid the slightest attention to the true nature of the late decision must have been aware of it. It was distinctly stated in Hall's affidavit, that they were informed by him, that a decision,. had been given by that Court in a case parallel with his ; yet one of the Magistrates had ?one so far as to say, his law was as good as that of the Judges. This indeed was con tradicted by the affidavits of one of the MaIzistrates, and the Magistrates had also affirmed, that they had only required a more formal opinion from the judges for their guidance. Now the Solicitor General upon a former occasion (that of New) had in treated the Court to take the 9th Clause of the Act into its mature and solemn con sideration, and deliver its opinion on the extent of such clause. In consequence, the Court did do so ; and after the most deliberate investigation it decided, that the Governor had NOT the power to re ,roke assignmentrJ 6f Convic.', except un der special circumstances. His Honor the Chief Justice upon that occasion, deli vered his opinion very publicldly in that Court ; and that decision was promulga ted and made known, and became in fact very notorious. As stated in the atlidavit of Mr. Hall, it had been canyased (very un ceremoniously) in the Sydney Gazette, and therefore could not possibly have been un known to the Magistrates. It had been stated, that the convictian of the Defen dant Hall had taken place for mere form's sake, to arrive at the true and final deci sion of the Court already given. But there was no necesity to have proceeded to such lengths as they done, without asking advice at the hands of the Crown officers.* There was a degree of obloquy in the pro ceeding. The Court however thought, that there was not on the whole suflicient proof of personal malice to authorize it tp grant the rule; but they would only dis charge the rule upon the Magistrates paying the costs of the proceedings. It bad been stated, that the Magistrates had allowed themselves to be guided by a gentleman in a highly responsible situa tion. The court could not find any co lour for such a strange assertion. All which the affidavit Mr. Hall stated was, that he was informed, and verily believed, that they were , ordered to assemble by Mr. M'Leay,' &c.; andthe Court was sorry to find, that the allegation had not been contra. dicted; which mighthavebeen done in the affidavits if it had been false. Having disposed of this part of the proceedings, the Court felt it its duty to offer a few re marks on the alleged contempt of the Magistrates to a solemn decision of that Court. It had been pressed on the Court, that it ought to file a Criminal Informa tion, or direct an attachment against the NMagistrates -for contv?irpt -f-it alesio;vn. In the present instance, the Court flattered itself, that no disrespect would accrue to it, from this dereliction of duty in the Ma gistrates. The Gentlemen had in their affidavits mide every concession in their power to appease the Court; neverthe less, it was quite impassible to pass over their conduct in this case of Mr. Hall, in silence. If the matter had been, as a matter of dilficulty, brought before the Court, it would have given them credit fordiscretion. The Supreme Court of New South VWales was erected into a Court of record; WITH TUE SA1ME POWER AS TiH. COURTS OF ENG LAND ENJO ; and the conduct of the Magistrates', however unintentional on their part, certainly conduced to bring the Court into public disesteem. Whenever the Judges were called upon for a decision on a point of importance, they gave the deepest attention to the matter laid before them. Therefore the Court could not suffer its dignity to be impugned by such decis ions being canvased by any one. - The Ma gistrates had purged thenmselvcs, however, by their oath, romn imlpure motives5 and the Court did not feel inclined on the pre sent occasion to visit them for their in discretion. The Court trusted this exam ple would be useful; and secure to it that respect and deference, which ought and must be said to its decisions. (The learned Judge concluded by quoting the 23rd. section ol the late Act of Parliament, which commands all Governors, IMagistrates, and all others without respect of persons, to obey the dicisions and mandates of the Supreme Court.) PoLien Orvcm.--MIonday. Patrick Rooney, a runaway from a road party was brought up to defend himself. Pa trick said, that he had supjsosed himself free, and bad come to Sydney for the pur pose of getting his certificate of freedom; but upon finding out his mistake, hlie had delivered himself up to the Chief Con stable. IIe further stated in extenuation of his fault, that he had been five years in thd Colony; that hie never during tha' time had an angry word with his masters; dtat ihe been recommended strongly for a ticket-of-leave, which lie was entitled to a year ago by the Government'sown regula tions; and that now after his good service he was lingering in a road party. I-Hle therefore thoubght the delay must be oL casioped by the negligence of the clerks, for he was certain thatt as a loyal mtana, the Governor if he knew of his case would grant him one. Captain Itossi said, he was sorry hlie cculd not interfere in his ease; it appeared by the memorandum from tihe Colonial Secretnry's Office, that htie was not free ihtil the ensuing month of March; and therefore he must be re turned to his gang; but advised him to *(Note by the Editor. Mr. Slamplson sent Mr. -..r ..Ire fAcm to do s&tat; Â£Ae did do.). petition His Exceflency the Governor for a ticket. Samuel Solomons, appeared to answer the charge of having a watch in his pos session which he had purchased fromn ont Gentleman, who had taken it from an.n thc' Gentleman in the presence of a third Gentlemanr. The principal witness in thiscase was a Mr. Bailey, who being in possession of all the circumstances of the case, proceeded to recite the history of the peregrinations of Mr. Cole's watch. Mr. Bailey, Mr. Cole, and Mr. Allerton, resided together in the most perfect har mtony at the house of Mr. Alwyn, of George Street. On Tuesday the 23rd In stant, the three Gentlemen were in a room, and Mr. Allertoni was paying his devoirs at the shrine of Adonis, making out the deficiencies of his own wardrobe from that of Mr. Cole; and among other necessaries to support the character of Dandy on that evening, Mr. Cole's watch, with append ages, was deposited in the fob of Aller ton, int the presence of the owner. Thus equipt, Mr. Allerton's general appearance was so much inproved, that his most in tinmate aqua:ntance hardly recognized him; indeed so great was the alteration, that it called forth from Mr. l3aily, bursts of admiration ; to wit; " You're doing it up brown tot night !" Mr. Cole indeed was of opinion that the watch could be well spared by Allerton, without very considerably de teriorating from his newly assumend cha racter of first-rate swell ; but this motion was overruled by Allerton, who, wishing alieu to his frinds, departed to the scene of festivity and ganllantry, namely, Mr. Solomons' Shades, to enjoy a rubber at Billiards. Here it was, that Mr. Aller ton, in open defiance of good breeding, sold to the unsuspecting Mr. Solomons the fatal watch, to discharge his score, and to enable him to personate his a'ntimcd aharacter with more spirit. And hcke clso was it, that Mr. Cole, Mr. Bailey, and Mr. Alwyn, (upon hearing where thf watch rested) discovered the ticking ab. sentee, the bona fide property of Solo mons, who shewed his receipt for t'he c; ~lh paid. Solomons however, generously of fored to ,iiee up the watch, upon the Gentlemen? paying him the sum lihe had given for it; whlch was something under the real valus; hit' unluckily, no smoney could be proctredIto.rilease it. Mr. Cole became outri~-~agu4. r ad even was rude enough to fotch Jilks, dand to have Solo nion's wat;h and appendiages all taken ih:to vile custody. Allerton bad in the mean time prudently deoamped and was nz where to be found; and the Bench con sidering the case very carefully, released Solorr~on, but held the watch &c.; in durance vile, until Mr. Allerton could be discovered. Sundry Joint-Stock cases were before the Court, and a few five-shilling poor cases, to swell the coffers of Mr. Hill's Be- nevolent fund. \-----o----- Hot-cross Buns on other days besides Good Friday. - AFTER DINNER on Wednesday last, a Magistrate who does not live a hundred miles from the Chamber of Commerce, was seen without his hat, with enraged counte- nance, with dishevelled hair, and armed with a gig-whip, chasing and flogging a drunken black or blacks up the street. It came to pass that an elderly female who appeared also to have dined, accosted the worthy Justice, and said something, which, though most peaceably spoken, ill suited with the state of the nervous system of the said assaulter of the blacks, and worshipful breaker of the public peace. He discovered by the smell of her breath, and the articulation of her speech, that the old lady had, equally with himself, dined. He accordingly vociferated for con- stables, in the name of our Sovereign Lord the King. His words were magical; for a pair of Knights of the broomstick immediately darted through the earth, as ghosts appear through the trap doors of Drury Lane and Sadler's Wells. The old lady was dragged to the watch-house by the order of the bare- headed Justice, but after losing her shawl, and having her clothes torn with resistance, she submit- ted, and declared her willingness to walk peaceably to the said watch-house. There she was of course immured for the night, with- out fire or blankets; and no doubt next day, unless she paid the crown levied for Mr. Hill's Benevolent Society, she was doubtless moun- ted some six feet in the market place, with her feet placed through a board to keep them warm. Quere. - Who broke the peace on this notable and extraordinary occasion - the woman or the Justice? and who, consequently, most deserved to be put in the stocks? The Jus- tice was one of the four Worships who re- ceived a reproof from the Supreme Court the morning of the same day for contempt; and for an illegal decision in the case of Rex v. Hall, in the matter of Peter Tyler. This re- proof, together with a good dinner, was the occasion perhaps of the worthy Justices' flog- ging the blacks bare-headed, and incarcerating the poor old woman. We are pained to find Mr. McLeay was so much annoyed at our brother's notice of his very excellent butter. We too have taken to eating it, and we must say, that of Mr. M'Lenay's office were conducted as well as his dairy, we and the public would not need to grudge him either his liberal pension, his handsome salary, or his still handsomer grants reserves and leases of Crown land. But good as is our Secretary's butter, it is surpassed by the veal of His **,****** Learning, that Mr. **** had a fine calf to kill, which the worthy butcher informed us was of ******* ,* own breed and rearing, we and our brother were determined to regale ourselves with a loin of the same, souscd with plenty of the Secretary's melted butter besides a stufling from the parsley of the Government garden, cultivated as it is by the King's ser- vants and we being His Majesty's state pri- soners; not forgetting to drink to the two illustrious founders of our little feast, in a glass of Col. Dumaresq's choicest french wine, sold respectively by Mr. Savage and Mr. Justice Browne some time ago. The temporary chapel is finished, so as to admit our Roman Catholic brethren hearing mass performed in that very comfortable place by Mr. Therry. It is crowded every Sunday. The music is excellent, the leader of the choir (a Mr. Cavanagh, lately arrived from Ireland) having undertaken to conduct it for twelve months.
