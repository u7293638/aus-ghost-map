THE GHOST THAT WORKED. /{ivost of Vbu fellers have heard oi & »«•' ghoSts, ' said the man behind the stove, " but very few of you have seen them. Now, I'll tell you a story of a ghost-, an industrious ghost. I ain't the man what- seen the man that saw the ghost, mind you. I saw it myself. The story ain't very romantic, but ii/s queer, an' I'll tell it to.you.And the man behind the stove re-lit his pipe and started off. " In 1878 I was in the oil regions of Pennsylvania. I was speculating a littfe, aud had done well, and I knew the coivntry pretty thoroughly. I was on mv way from Pet-rolia, in Butler County, to Fairview. In the party was Sam Shryoclc, two other experts, and myself. We were going to see a new 300-barrel well near Fairview that had just been struck by Green, the oil king. "/What wells is them? I asked as the road took a short cut through a way I had not been before, and I pointed my hand to threfetkll derricks of weather worn pine, with an engine puffiing steadily away beside each one of them. " These are the Bell Union, or Ghost wells," said Sam. " 4 And why the Ghost wells 1' "' Because ft ghost runs them.' "I'doubted Savivs statement at first. But the other two experts nodded their heads aBirmaiiiveiv, and then Sam told the story. , 41 The Bell Union' wells iVere tanong the first struck on the belt in the third sand., "This place, then was a whpbping wilderness. There was no communication''with' the outside world save by pony express, and lalfchough the Allegheny Valley railroad rah •but six miles away, the condition of the 'country and the thickness of the forest ibade these wells almost inaccessible. ,'" No -ivoman lived nearer than Parker, jseven miles off,' arid the two vourig men from Erie who pumped the Wells—Cliarlie jvay-. lor and Fred" Hasting.^—had a ha«l and lonely lot of it. Of these two, ;Kaylor was ;a bright, intelligent Sboy Of friendly dispositibn, just *21.

Kaylor had tried to make friends with Hastings tilne.aixd again,only to ibe repulsed.;; So now the two nien relieved each other, each did his share of "the work and 110 more, and they never' spoke except •wheb necessary to give instructions:" Hiisi£ ingg forked the morning trick and Kaylbr came on at night. • : \ '',/'' u .'"Things went on like this for' some time, ;nntiV bne day "Kaylor -was sei^d'with .a Itbmbie attack of r toothache.

A PITMAN entered a public-house in Newcastle, where'an old nian was seated near the fire, and accosted him w\th the customary salutation of 4£ Gude mornin'." The old man, however, paid no attention, and the pit-man repeated his salute in a louder voice. This time his lungs had effect. The old man raised himself up, and, taking from a d apacious pocket a trumpet of peculiar contruction, put it to his ear. Our honest pitman stood amazed, but, after waiting with s he most anxious expectation for some oments, be exclaimed, with a disappointed .ir : >' Nay, man, it.wiuiu '•'.ee."
