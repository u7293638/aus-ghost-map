The Bible the Umpire of Truth. Let the umpire be where he can be heard. The Scripture is our court of appeal ; let it be open to all comers. Every man must have an anchorage for his faith; even for his unbelief he Meeds some form of holdfast. The disputer of this world believes in himself, and so he ends the mailer. The Soman Catholic finds his anchorage the infallibility of the Pope, and vsub-i-'to his reason to the traditions of his Church. You aud I. find our anchorage in the infallibility of Scripture. The Holy Ghost moved holy men of old to write this b lMk and we believe that every word of it is inspired, and I hat if we could get absolutely the exact words in which ifc was written at first, we should have a book as perfect certain, and immutab' is God Himself. We know i iiat in any one version it there may be minor emus of copyists, which could not have been avoided unless a miracle had been wrought every dav for thousands of years; but, allowing for that, we hold that the volume containing tne Old and New Testaments is God's revelation of Himself to us in words,—a rev.;'"im positive aud clear. Hence it is that we desire >ery living man to read it. We desire to see truth triump vnit, and oi-ror defeated ; and therefore we scatter the de.
