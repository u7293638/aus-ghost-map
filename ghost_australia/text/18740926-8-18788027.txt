SUPREME COURT -MONDAY, SEPT. 21. ttrom the Herald) (Before Sir James Martin, C J , Mr Justice Hargrave, and Mr Justice Cbeeke ) EXPARTE THACKERAY -PROHIBITION The following are the judgments delivered by Mr Jostle« Hargrave and Mr Justice Cheeke in this caae. Mr Justice Hargrave said I need pcarc ly state that I have given this case my moat anxious consideration e\er since it was brought under our notice on 27th March lest, nut only on account of its great importance in relation to the efficiency of the Church of hag land in tina colony by the Supreme Court's maintaining the lawful spiritual authority of the Bishops oí that communion ino jar as the law can maintain such authority) over the clergymen ofthat communion officiating throughout each diocese, in alt their ministrations of religion, which are enjoyed by nearly one half of our population, but also on account of the great importance of this case to the clergymen and laity themselves The only duty however, with which we, as Judges of the Supreme Court, are entru-ted on the present occasion ia to main tam the present law as between the Bishop of ^newcastle and the lier Mr Thackeray in their present statuBand their legal rights toward* each other, which status and legal rights seemed to my mind to have been most perfectly established and declared by the Privy Council for the guidance of this Court, BO as to be now altogether beyond the slightest judicial doubt on my part ID the first place, I will state what is the present state of the law so far as relevant to the present case, which subject will be bent considered, under the four following heads, viz - First The decisions of the Pnvy Connell since 1853, defining and declaring the legal status and powers of colonial bishops, and fixing by such decisions, the boundaries to be maintained between their spiritual and legal authority, especially over the clergy. Secondly I will point out, as briefly as I can, how the old common law of England while recognising the Chrslian religion as part of our laws has from the earliest period of our history drawn especial boundaries round all episcopal and other spintual persons, against their exceeding these boundaries Ihis branch of our law was solemnly coiiBidered and established by Lord Coke and all the English Judges, In their celebrated judgment in the great case of " Prohibitions, ' ra James I reign Thirdly I will show how the statute law of England, especi ally the statutes of Charles I reign, have enacted still more clear barriers against spiritual persons setting up their spiritual authority, or their spiritual claims of power, by especially pro- hibiting the action of any so-called spiritual " Courte,' or any other ecclesiastical jurisdictions or authority of any kind, as against other subjects of her Majesty, whether clerical or lay, unless authorized by our statute law And fourthly, I will notice the special colonial law as to the Church of England in this colony, and several decisions of this Supreme Court aa to prohibitions against illegal Courts, viz our prohibition on behalf of the Rex George King »gainst the Court attempted to be established by the present Bishop of Sydney, in W6I, and the two very recent cases ot Prohibitions granted by this Court against the Chief Commissioner of Insol- vent Estates, in the cases of Frost and M'llveen, ra 1871 First, as to the Pnvy Council The two decisions of the Pnvy Council most directly applicable to the presert ca«e, are Long v Bishop of Cape Town, I Moore s P C Reports, N S 411 (1863), and in re Bishop of Natal, III Moore's P C,N S 115 (1864) These two decisions have been subsequently fully maintained and adopted, first by Lord Romilly, Al R . in the case of Bishop of Natal v Gladstone, III LB £q (1866), secondly, by the House of Lords in the case of Bishop of Èxtttr v Marshall. S L R, H of L, 17 (186b), and, lastly, by the Privy Council itself, In the very recent case of Bishop of Cape Town v Bishop of Nat*,!, III L R. P C- Appeals, 1 (1869 The first decision of the Pnvy Council, viz , Long v Bishop of Cape Town, clearly establishes the following maxim, which is of infinite vi lue both to che clergy and laity of the Church of England in all our colonies, viz -That no colonial bishop whatever possesses any coercive authonty, nor any right or power whatever, arbitranly to depnve any licensed clergyman in his diocese of his license, or to sus pend him from any of his clerical functions, except for some distinct and specific offence, actually committed by such clergyman against the laws of the Church of England, either in doctrine or discipline, and expressly charged against such clerg>man, and examined and tned according to law before a competent tnbunal The second decision of ihe Privy Council in these matters is in re Bishop of Natal, which decision establishes a second maxim also of infinite importance to our colonial clergymen I viz , that the oath of canonical obedience to the bishop«, taken by all clergymen at their ordination, only means that the cler- gyman so ordaintd will obey such commands as bishops are by law authorised to impose upon such clergyman, and that a clergyman can gire no cunsensual promise to obey, except under a colonial Btatute This case also declares .' We have no established Church in this colony. ' that is that no part oi the »o called " Eccleslas «cal Law of England ' nor any of the reported cases in the .' Ecclesiastical Courts" where special Engli'h or Insh bishoDj have exerci«ed or claimed any extraordinary authority or coer- cive junsdiction over English or Irish clergymen, or over any other persons in England or Ireland, lorm the slightest part of our colonial law, nor can any Buch decisions or dicta ot Eng- lish or Irish Judges be cited in our courte as applicable in any sense whatever to our colonial bishops or clergymen, though nominally of the ' Church of England," unless such decisions or dicta come within the principle established by the Ker Mr Long's case,-i e, unless the charges or accusations against clergymen are examined and tned by a competent tribunal within the colony The other three caaes I have mentioned above, namely. Bishop of Natal v Gladstone, Bishop of Exeter v Marshall, and Bishop of Cape Town v Bishop of Natal, are extremely useful, as showing how these great maxims of colonial law, as established in 1863 and 1864, by the two first mentioned eade?, have been subsequently and expressly maintained and acted upon first by Lord Romilly, 31 K (in 1866), with reference to the protection of bishop! themselves against all interference with their spiritual or civil rights unless upon some proved offences by such bishops again?t the law or doctrine of the Church of England to be proved against such bishop by evidence taken in some competent Court, and secondly bj the Privy Council itself Buhop of Cape Town v Bishop of Natal (the judgment in which was delivered by Lord Justice Giffard in 1869) establishes that all differences of opinion between conflicting episcopal persone", or conflicting ecclesiastical jurisdictions, or litigated matters in British colonies, are also to be decided in Courts of competent jurisdiction , the Privy Council expressly fitatin^ is their judgment thattbeir Lordäbips decision in the Kev Air Long a case " was not to be disputed or controverted * The fifth and only modern deem cm I eau find as applicable to the present case is the House of Lords* case of Bishop of Exeter v Marshall, which is also an extremely valu- able decision as to all future ecclesiastical matters, both in England and the colonies, because the House of Lords and the common law Judge0, in all their several judg menta fgiven in this case, have strongly maintained the great doctrine laid down by Lord Hardwick in Middleton v Croît (2 Atk 650, and 2 Strange 105«). that the canons of 1603 have no binding authority whatever upon the laity of the Church of England, whether here or in England , and have also no obligatory eflect upon the clergy, whether here or in England, whenever any civil rights are tn dispute, such as of " advowsons," livingo, or any other temporal or civil right, and that all the ecclesiastical canons of any date whatever are altogether ineffectual to protect any bishop, whether English or Colonial, in any illegal episcopal, or spiritual interference, directly or indirectly, with the temporal or civil rights, either of clergymen or any other persons These five most important decisions, four of which are by the highest Courts known to our law, or to us Judges of the Supreme Court-seem to me to have declared and established the proper legal status and authority of colonial bishops over the clergymen officiating and ministering throughout each diocese-so as to render bishops (if they will only submit m all »incenty to suoh dec-stons) quite incapable oí any illegalities towards tbeir clergymen, and y«t quit« able to maintain all their proper spin tuai authority over all the ministering clergy- men ol their communion With reference to these five important decisions now esta- blished for our own guidance, I may be permitted most respect- fully to remark, as Judge of this Court, that notwithstanding all the discussions which have taken place (especially among eccle- siastical person?) both here and m LnQ'laud as to tbeee deel sion*, lam eati faed that the more these decisions are con ei dertd hy any constitutional lawyer, the more cotiPistent will they be found not only with all the old common law of Kurland, but a so wtih ail the great constitutional statutts of Lngland, enocted expresply to prevent the eccle«iRfltical jurisdiction, whether here or in England from exceeding its proper boun darte* I will now tturefore, in the second and third places consider the constitutional aspect of the present question, stating how the law ot the present subject stands when considered lrom a constitutional point ol view This branch ot the subject may be shortly divided into the following four branches - First We, the colonista oí New Soutli Water, " bring out with us (to adopt the words of Blackstone) this first great common law maxim, distinctly laid down by Coke, and Black- stone, and every other English Jud^e long before any of our colonies were in legal existence or even thought of, that ' C natiamty is part and parcel of our general laws, and that all the revealed or divine law, so far as enacted by the Holy Scriptures to be of universal obit« at ion, ia part of our colonial law-as clearly explained by Blackstone, yoi. 1 pp 43 3 and vol IV , pp 43 GO Secondly The next common law maxim, which is part of our colonial law, and laid down from the earliest history of our law, when bishop-« and other spiritual persons first began to advance their own special claims of divine right-i e, their own spiritual authority, o\ er the rest of her Meje-ty's subjects whether ecclesiastics or the laitv, is -That on no pretence whatever can bishops do any act whatever under their divine Tight or spiritual authority, affecting any single clergyman or any of the laity of their diuctse, except under the supervision and control of the temporal courts of justice, to be exerciaed by the Judges of the Queen's Bench in England and as ex pretty conferred upon the Supreme Court ot this colony by the third section of our Constitution Act<9 Geo IV c 83), subject to the supervision and correction by the Privy Council of the Imperial Statute in that behalf The second common law maxim of our Constitutional Law obviously lies at the foundation of the Privy Council's decisions in the Rev Mr Long s case and in re Bishop of Natal The third branch of the constitutional view of the pre- sent question is the well known history ol Archbishop a Becket and his resistance to the Constitutions of CUrendon in Henry II's reign, 12th century,-the subsequent proceed- ings in restraint of the " ArticuU Cien of Archbishop Boni face in Henry Iii's reign in the same century, when the Judges of the Qut-en a Bench were threatened with excommu ni cat ion for issuing prohibitipn* against the illegal acts of that Archbishop,-and Lord Coke s firm conduct, as Chief Justice in James T 's reign adopting all the previous decisions of the Common Law Judges, and resisting all the claims of Arch- bishop Whitgift and the ' Articuh Glen of Bishop Bauen il« and maintaining to its full extent this very jurisdiction by way of Prohibition All these proceedings are fully reported by Lord Coke as the great " ca^e of prohibitions , 2 I nat. £99, and discussed in Hallam s ' Middle Ages, 3, 311 and ara BO many distinct statements of the Common Law as again it the im proper use of eccle-iaatical authunty, whether by bi«hops or any other spin mai persons,-and all these maxims and judicial authorities upon this important branch of our Constitutional Law are most undoubtedly "part and parcel1* ot our colonial law, as protecting our clergy and our laity against improper ecclesiastical authority, and whether claimed officially or per- sonally, many way whatever, whenever attempted tobe exer- cised by any bishop, outside the express legal boundaries so clearly laid down by Lord Coke and the Common Law Judges of England, and whether »uch innovation be attempted against clergymen or against the laity The fourth branch of the constitutional law of England, which is also part and parcel of our Constitutional Law, con- sists of the great constitutional statutes of the sixteenth cen- tury , such as the Act of Supremacy, as enacted by the Par- liaments of the Reformation, intended not only to protect all British subjects agaiuBt any ecclesiastical authority from foreign sources, whether pnnce or prelate, but also to prevent the establishment of any "Court of Justice1 of any kind whatever, except under the express authonty and in the name of the Queen as "the fountain of justice,' exercised in mo- dern time« only by Her Majef-ty by Act of Parliament In this branch of our Constitutional Law We must include alaothe equally important statutes of the seventeenth century abolishing the Star Chamber and High Commission Courts, " those gloomy conclaves, * SB Mr Hallam calls them which, under the arbitrary sway of Archbishop Laud and Lord Strafford, brought Church and Monarchy into commingled ruin The statute abolishing the Star Chamber is not a mere civil enact m eut, but is also directed against the setting up of any illegal court, jurisdiction, or authonty by any "Arch- bishop, Bishop, or Vicar-Gen eral, or their Chancellor, or any other epintuat or ecclesiastical judge, officer, or mimater of justice, or A*T OTHER PERSON whatever " (Star Chamber Abolition Act, 1641) The same Parliament of England endeavoured to put a stop to all these spintual or EcclesiasticalL Courts" and " jurisdic- tions , " by abolishing the " High Commission Court, * that 1 younger birth of tyranna,* as Hallam calls it, and enacting " that from and alter the lirBt day of AugUBt, 1641, no new Court shall be etected, ordained or appointait within the realm ot England or dominion of Walep, which sfiall or may have the like power ^jurisdiction, or authority, as the eaid High Com mission Court iwwhath or pretendetli to have, but that all and evei y letters patents, curonu-sione, and grants made orto be made, by his Majtaty, his heirs, or successors, and all powers and authorities granted, er pretended, or mentioned, to be granted, thereby, and all acts sentences, and decrees to be made by virtue or colour thereof shall be utterly void, and of none effect " Hie gruat object of this important Constitutional statute (which, though worded only as to England and Wales) is also declaratory of the old common law applicable to all her Majesty's dominions and is quite effectual to protect us ail both clerical and laity-irom all the grievous iniquities of those ecclesiastical tribunals or " Courts of Inquiry , ' and especially from such things as the oaths ex oßcio, and all the various other oppressive proceedings compelling clerg> men and others " to expurgate themselves," as in the present case, " from Blanderoua rumours ' Mr Hallam (at vol 1 p 202) thus epitomises the iniquities of the High Commission Court -" The High Commission Court, , originally established under the Act ot ¡supremacy, twelve of whose members were bishops, had extended its powers ever | since the reign of Elizabeth, and was authorised by the Crown to inquire * by any means they could devise,' into absence from church, heresies schisms, incest", adultenes, and all offences of the kind, to examine all su*, ected persons on their oaths, and to punish all who should reluBe to obey their orders, to deprive all beneficed persons, &o; " The fifth br-inch of our Constitutional Law applicable to the I present case ÍB the long list of modern judicial decisions since 17*50, dirtcted against the introduction into tins or any other i colony of any of the local spiritual laws of England as to the Established Church of England or Ireland or as to any | ecclesiastical matters of any kind whatever, which, though re- maining * law' in England, as to the Church of England, or I Church ot England and Ireland, as by law "established," are I not " law" in this colony, and are not applicable to any colony having a Legislature, until adopted by us or confirmed by some express colonial statute I allude to such decisions as Sir W Grant's decision as to the Mortmain Acts in Attorney General v Stewart 2 Mer 163 (1816) down to Whicker v Hume 1 De (x, M and G 506 (1852),-all expressly deciding not only that the English statutes and decisions as to these Euglwh ecclestastioal matters are not law iu our colony, but also that all the decisions and dicta, whether cued from Co my n'a Digest Title, Eglise, from Salkeld's Reports, from Bacon s Abndgement, from the Law Reports, whether ecclesiastical or lay, or Burns* Ecclesiastical I aw, are uot ' brought out" by our colonial bishops, as if annexed by implication to their commissions-but are left be- hind in the mother country, like the laws of Mortmain and Tithe laws, being solely apphcable(as Blackstone coroplaiently , eavs to his readers in 1766) to the " artiüciiil refinements of English Law * among which he expressly mentions the " Eng hah Spintual Courts * I It ti also quite clear that the 3rd and 14th sections of the Euglah Church Discipline Act of 1840 to put down " scandals ' have no application to this colony, although the legal advisers of the Bishop appear to have framed the present proceedings under those sections, but given only seven instead of fourteen day's notice to Mr Thackeray, they are not "brought out" into this colony by our colonial bishops, and therefore have so application whatever to the present matter I have thought it due to the great importance of the present subject thus to state, as briefly as I could, my view of the five branches of the English constitutional law which form part of our own colonial constitutional law, in restraint of the spiritual claims of bishops when advanced among us be>ond the limits fixed by the common law of England, the English Parliament, and the English Judges, and altogether independent of the modern decisions of the Privy Council and the superior Eu ghi Ii Courts, becaute during the progress of those most invaluable decisions since 1S63, it has always seemed to me that the general effect of thoce decisions was by no means to introduce any new principles, or to ere »te any new or special exemptions of us colonists from excessive spiritual claimB, but rather to adapt ali our old English constitutional law lu ecclesiastical matters to the modern difficulties and dangers of religious liberty, according to the special circumstances of our coluuies, as under free institutions and our responsible local self government uith a view rather to the practical maintenance of episcopal authouty than to destroy it I now come to consider the lourth branch of our present law as applicable to the present prohibition viz, our local colonial statutes as to the Church of England, and the decision of our own Supreme Court by the prohibition granted in 1861, to restrain the present B&hop; of Sjdney from his proceedings against the Bev George King, and also the two prohibitions granted by this Court in Frost's and M'llveen's cases 1871 As to the Church of England Act of 8th William ¿V , o 5. extended by 30th Victoria 1866, aud the elaborated consensual constitutions as agreed to by tiie bishops and clergy, and lay representatives ol all dioceses of the colony, and the provincial synod, as deposited m our Supreme Court, aud as annexed to Mr Thackeray's affidavit, there cannot be a doubt that these statutes and constitutions when read together by any disin- terested person, have effectually provided the Bishops, and the clergy and laity of the Church of England communion in this colony, with a most perfect organization for the effectual regu- lation of all their ecclesiastical matters, whether spiritual or temporal ¡sections 39 and SO of Act of William IV effectually provide for the revocation of any licence, but only " upon carne shown ' H Inch ob\ luusly is the fundamental maxim uf natural ju tice If there be Bouie statutory omissions or silence as to the details of the proceedings to be followed by the bishop after calling upon a clerg) man "to Bhow canee,' Buch omisBion or silence can never be held to imply a legislative sanction to absolute and arbitrary proceedings which any bishop may choose to adopt, ex mero motu-deftors the statute altogether, and against natural justice Moreover the recent colonial constitution as to the diocesan and appellate tribunals fully created by these constitutions of the Bishops, and Church of England, clerical and lay, have supplied in fact all the omissions of the Act of William IV The Rev George King's case, 1861, simply decides that a bishop cannot create, ex mero molo* any new court or tribunal of his own " arbitrators" or commissaries, or any otherwise named, nor can the Bishop call upon any clergyman to join in 1 the construction of any such new fashioned arbitration court, and then submit himself to such "new tribunal," constructed only pro re nata lue passage at the end of this judgment of Mr Justice Dickinson and Mr Justice Witein Kev George Kings case suggesting, or even asserting the possible legahtj of the Bishop's proceeding to decide any clergyman s right to retain his license simply by his own episcopal authority, is a mere obiter dictum, and the moat that can be said about this dictum is, that the Privy Council decisions cited above, especially the decision in the Bev Mr Long s case, have completely overthrown this suggestion, and decided the very opposite of euch dictum as to " episcopal authority,* and also decided that any consensual court must not be set up pro r« nata but must be first sanc- tioned by our local Legislature, which decisions are, beyond doubt, now the clear law of our colony The latest cases of colonial prohibitions which I have now to notice, are the two casea of ex-parte bempill in re Frost, and ex parte Sempill m re M'llveen, June 38,1671, m which the late Chief Justice (Sir Alfred Stephen), Mr Justice Cueeke, and myself (after argument by counsel) most carefully con sidered the whole question of these quasi judicial "Courts of Inquiry," and we unanimously decided that a prohibition ought to go to restrain the Chief Commissioner from any such attempted "inquiry," as he proposed to hold into the conduct of Mr. Sempill as an official assignee under his control, the Commissioner having no legal jurisdiction to hold euch " inquiry " After the conclusion of our separate judg- ment«, the Court unanimously declared against the legality of such ** inquiries, ' and this Court also unanimously decided to is-me a prohibition, and not simply to rescind the order of the Chief Commissioner the former course being decided upon on the ground that this was an assumption of power to act by in- quiry as it a court, and a claim of jurisdiction which the Chief Commissioner did not posses Having thus Btated my view of all the law of this colony ap- plicable to the present prohibition, I must now state the facts of this case as briefly as I can With regard to the facts of the present case, Mr Thackeray's affidavit sets forth a full copy of the constitutions for the management and good government of the Church of England and Ireland within the colony of New South Wales, as adopted at the general conference of the bishops and clerical and lay representatives of all the dioceses in April, 1860, containing first, in clauses l8 and 19, the provisions for establishing a dio- cesan tribunal for the trial of offences by clergymen licensed within the diocese, either as to doctrine or discipline, and that no e'ergymen's license should be withdrawn, cancelled, or re- voked unless at his own request, or as a consequence ot a sen- tence by such tribunal, but saving all powers then vested in the Bishop Mr. Thackeray's affidavit then sets forth his education at St. Bael ; the two certificates of hlB admission to deacon and priest's orders by Dr Prince Lee, the Bishop of Manchester, in 1852 and 1853, each certificate testifying to bis virtuous and pious bfe and conversation He then narrates his year's residence in Melbourne in 1855, and his arnval in 1856 at West Maitland, where he was most graciously received as a guest with his wife and ohildren by the present Bishop, and at once licensed to the incumbency of West Maitland The Bishop's affidavit also Beta forth a paper which was signed by Mr Thackeray and the Bishop before the license was issued to him, to the effect that until Mr Thackeray obtained the testimonial of three years' residence in that diocese Mr Thack- eray would hold his position " at the disposai" of the Bishop. This was obviously a very proper paper to be signed by the both parties in 1856, as Mr Thackeray had not then since his ordination held any appointment for three years in aay one dio- cese. I hare mentioned this document as the Bishop pats it forward in his affidavits, but his counsel very properly did not la} any stress upon his paper, as in the least applicable to Mr Thackeray after his seventeen years unblemished character at St Paul's, and as not produced by the Bishop till the present proceedings were about to be commenced Mr Thackeray's affidavit then sets forth the clauses of the Bishop's letters patent, dated 1847, and the 19th Bection of our Church Temporalities Act, 1B37, endorsed on his own license as minister, under which authority "he commenced his ministry, there being no church, no parsonage, no school, and in fact, nothing but the green sod " He narrates how his clencal labours prospered, till he had gathered together the largest congregation into bis church, possessing the best organ and the finest choir In the whole diocese, and was the only church in the diocese where there is a peal of bells, and that he bad him- self expended from £1200 to £1400 on the church, residence, and grounds together with the schoolroom His affidavit then sets forth the adoption by the Synod of the diocese of New- castle, ra 1866, of the General Constitutions previously set forth, containing the provisions for a " Tribunal," or " Diocesan Court," and the submission of himself and all other I clergymen to that Synod made to the Bishop himself in 1870, and especially the provisions made in 1872 for constituting the appellate triennal from the decisions of the Diocesan Court. I Mr Thackeray 's affidavit then seta out his correspondence in December, and narrates his interviews with the Bishop from November. 1873, when he discussed with the Bishop the first scandalous reports against his moral character, but " he satis- fied the Bishop as to the nntrnthfulnees of such reports and they parted quite amicably ' It then appears that Mr Thackeray applied for a year's leave oí absence on account ot hu daughter's health, bnt after some discussion and on a state- ment by the Bishop ot new scandalous charges he had heard against Sir Thackeray, the latter withdrew his application lor leave ot absence, although the Bishop offered to obtain for bim the usual canonical credentials to other Bishops, from three clergymen of the Newcastle diocese, as to his having livid "piously soberly, and honestly,' and that such clergymen had ¡ not heard anything to tho contrary, fco, and that they ' believed him in their consciences to be as to his u moral charlo ter, a person worthy to be licensed to the cure of souls." Mr Thackeray further sets out how on the 19th December , the Bishop confirmed the young persons presented to him for confirmation, having previously *' administered the Holy Com- munion to him in both kinds by his own hands," thus showing that be could not then Iii-ve believed the scandalous imputa» tions affecting Mr Thackeray's character. ¿ The present proceedings appear hy Mr Thackeray's affidavit to have been commenced by a letter he received from Mr. Barker, the Bishop's solicitor, dt ted the 13th January, 1874, but carefully stated not to be in that character, though watten, with the Bishops knowledge, offering to confer with Mr Thackeray previ rai to formal proceedings, &c;, and to avoid scandal, &c; An interview then took place at Mr. Barker*! office, as to milich Mr Thackeray and Mr Barker differ so much that it is unnecessary to refer to it, as of tnuoh or indeed any importance en the present application After leaving Mr Barker s office, Mr Thackeray, by a Utter to Mr Barker, dated 29th January, says, "1 decline to accede to the Bishop's eug gestion as to resignation, even with the understanding that all my canonical papers shall be perfected by bim for another diocese ' To this letter Mr Barker replies on 3lst January, by "regrets," &c;, &c;, and states that "the Bishop will act at \ once as he may oe advised " The next step was the Bishop s formal inhibition to Mr. i Thackeray by letter on 19th February from " exercising his ministerial functions in the Church of St Paul, West Maitland, or elsewhere in the diocese , until either you shall have satisfied me of the groundlessness of the charges I involved in the reports, or 1 shall bave been enabled to investígate the matter, in case it should be necei sary for me to do so " This inhibition contained a state- | mentof lormal chitrges of gross iinmora lty reported against Mr Thackeray, which Mr Thackeray did not set out in his i affidavit, but which was read to the Court, containing th« | specific reports complaining of Mr Tuackeray's intercourse with Mrs. Frank Stephen and with Mrs Pbilpotts Ou the following day, february JO, Mr. Thackeray wrote ta J the Bishop a letter stating the chargeB to be " gross slanders'* against his character as a clergyman, and declining to submit I to the inhibition until **after cause shown before a competent i tribunal^* and on the following Sunday, 26th Febniary, he Mr. ' ihackeray performed divine service as usual, in St Paul's Church, in open resistance of the Bishop's inhibition. Ou the 26th February the Bwhop wrote to Mr Ihackeray, acknowledging the receipt of 3Ir Thackeray's letter of 20th, refusing to obey the inhibition of the 19th, and then proceed- ing as tollows -" I am officially informed, however, that %n disregard of that duty which you as a clergyman owe to me a* the Bishop, to whom u co uni ii ted the charge and government over you, and under whose license you have hitherto offi- ciated as minister of Saint Paul's Church West Mait- land you did on Sunday laßt, the 2*2 nd day of February instant, c ntrary and in wilful disobedience to my di- rt etion, perform divm¿ service in the said cbarch of Saint Paul Now therefore I do hereby require you to appear before me at my residence at Morpeth on lues ay, the third day of March next, at twelve o'clock noon, to show cause why the liceu-e granted to you by me, dated the 13th day of May, 1856, under which you have hitherto officiated as a minister of the said church, and all or an) other licences or faculties under which you are entitled, or claim to be entitled, to officiate as s clergy uinn in the said church or elsewhere within the diocese of New enmle, should not be withdrawn, cancmea\ or revoked, for that you, bting a licensed clergyman of the said tfiocae, did, by oßaating m the said church on Sandayfast under the tircum ttaucts hereinbefore mentioned, wilfuüit, and agmist your duty as such c ergyman, disobey my reasonable and lawful direction as your Bishop, ami refuse to pay such obedience as u due from you torneas th* Bishop of the diocese antler whait licence mlone you have had any righi to officiate m the said church.

" l8 It was my anxious desire to act strictly in conformity with my duty as the Bishop of the diocese, and in accordance with what I believed and was advised waa the court« of procedure declared by the Supreme Court an the 11th day of February, 1861, in the case of the Ber George King, and with that view all the proc«6dingi Mt forth in the subsequent paragraphs of Mr Thackeray« affidavit were taken by me under the advice of my counsel and solicitor as aforesaid The lift ot charges appended to the said letter were written separately and on a separate sheet of paper, m order that the letter might be produced without pro ducing the particulars of the charges in which other persons' named were necessarily mentioned ' 19 1 huve throughout the whole of the proceedings of which Mr thackeray complains acted solely from a conscien- tious deBire to discharge my duty as Bishop of the diocese with fidelity and lu the exercise of such authority as I belletet) I possessed, I have endeavoured to prevent the great scandal to the Church and to religion by prohibiting a clergyman from ministering m the church whilst there were rumour» to seriously affecting ha character ' Mr Thackeray s affidavit sets out several extract* from the Bishop s charges to his clergy in which the several de- cisions of the Vriyy Council above mentioned are considerad, aud from which it seems to me that the Bishop would have acted far more efficiently by at once prooeedimg to constitute ' the tribunal authorised by law. than to attempt to take the course he has done under the dictum in the Kev George King s case, the more especially as Mr. Thackeray has continuously to the present date stated his perfect readiness to submit to such tribunal The Bishop s affidavit then proceeds as follows - . ¿0 If the said James Robert Thackeray had acted in accordance vnth my letter of the \tfh day of February, and had ceaatd to «munter %n the churcli until the chargea against hua , hud been investigated, I should have taken the earliest oppor- tunity of investigating all the matters of »condoi alleged aiunat bim, and have afforded him the fullest opportunity of being heard either personally or by counsel or solicitor, and of hearing and cross examining the witnesses, and also of prodmcing such eudenceas he thought fit on his own behalf, but after the I receipt of hit letter of the 20th day of February, and finding , that he had in wilful defiance of my directions officiated on the I following Sunday I ftltthatl shoultl be unfaithful m my office \f Idul not tmme ¡lately deal toith ¡um for hi* wilful breach of discipline, aud (acting under the advice of counsel) I proceeded to call upon bim to show cause why his license should not be revoked as set forth in his affidavit " 21 I had been advised by couusel before the proceedings were taken, and it WEB in accordance with my own opinion and desire that Mr Ihackery r-hould have the fullest opportunity of showing cause why his license should not be revoked, and I was ready and willing to hear anything that he or his counsel or solicitor might urge on hid behalf, but he declined.to atttnd, and his counsel did nothing hut object to my jurisdiction» and (after reading it) he handed m a written protest signed by Mr lhackerayas set out in his affidavit, but he did not express any desire to address me, or to take any further part ia the matter * 23 After counsel had handed in Mr Thackeray *§ protest, I fold bim that I Intended to proceed with the matter, and that I would weigh and consider the objection that had been put for- ward by Mr Wisdom as counsel for Mr Thackeray and there- upon Mr Wisdom withdrew, and no person appearing on behalf of Mr Thackeray, I required all ike documents as evi dence to be read, and everything hating been done, but to ex prêts my determination upon Vic matter, 1 declared the inquiry to be closed, aud informed the persons present that my de- cision would be given on the following day I did not exclude au> person who desired to be présentât 'the Inquiry,' but I did say at thâ outset that it was nat a public Court, and my iutentton in doing so was to show that I was not assuming to hold a Court but to act as I believed to be in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case to which I have before referred This decision was given in writing the very next day In the final letter and decision of the Bishop absolutely withdrawing and rescinding Mr Thackeray s license, and declaring all ooa nection ceasing between himself as Bishop and Mr. Thackeray as Presbyter It is plain, from the BiBhop'e own statement, and it Is not attempted to be denied that, up to the present hour, not a single witness has been found to depose, either before the Bishop or his Court, up to the application for this prohibition -or indeed to the present hour, as to the slightest criminality of Mr Thackeray towards either of the ladies mentioned tn the inhibition Upon such a clear statement of the facts of the present oase as narrated by the Bishop from the issue of the inhibition oí the 19th February to the final and absolute revocation of Mr Thacke- ray's licence on the 5 th March, lam bound to state that all the Bishop s proceedings, complained of in this application, are undoubtedly illegal and void because no law, no common law, no statute law no colonial law, can be cited in their favor, either in su- iprndiug Mr Thacker») 'before cause chown.' or m calling upon him to answer these rumours -that is, requiring bun to ' expurgate himself" from these rumours, nor any direct accusations made against him ot these crimes which the Bishop has always most properly declined to make against Mr Thackeray, or even to bring before Jttr Thackeray or this Court, otherwise than as rumours, and only rumours. The two decisions oftbePnvy Council in the Btv Mr Long's case and m re the Bishop of Natal, expressly laying down our colonial laws in these matters, are of course the chief judicial grounds of this my opinion, but I may also state with the most Biucere respect towards those decisions, that 1 consider my present judgment to be also strongly confirmed-first, by the broad constitutional view of the question ever since Lord Coke's case of prohibition , and secondly, by the two decisions of this Court in 1871 in h rost and M Elveen's cases Moreover, when we consider that the charges contained in these rumours were not of bad doctrine preached by Mr Thackeray, but were charges of the grossest moral enme to be charged against Mr Thackeray as a clergyman or as « gentle- man , and were so deliberately but moat illegally endorsed by the Bishop in his inhibition fn February v that I feel myself compelled to remark that the Bishop e proceedings were in my opinion not only altogether illegal and void, but were (by the advice of his counsel and solicit or) so hastily instituted and con- ducted in a manner which was throughout so contrary to natu- ral justice, that this Court is bound to maintain with a firm hand the protection of our social life no less than the legal rights of clergymen, from any repetition of such proceedings, whether considered as to Mr Thackeray alone or as to the other persons mentioned in the inhibition and its enclosure. It wap, indeed, slightly suggested that few or no cases of firohtbit ion against Bishops hau occurred, certainly not within ate years To this suggestion It is enough to remark that the common law right of prohibition against Bishops and their illegalities of every kind is too clearly established by Lord Cokes conduct and decision in James I'a reign, and the paucity of any prohibitions against Bishops since the constitu- tional statutes of Charles I 's reign, is fully accounted forby the wise submission of all Protestant Bishops to the great consti- tutional principles then established I will now proceed to inquire into the three chief arguments advanced at the Bar as legal objections against the prohibition being issued hint It was argued that admitting the Bishops conduot towards Mr Thackeray to be altogether "void in law," and illegal down to the issue of the present prohibition, still, it was eon tended that several technical objections existed to the rule nisi being now made absolute by the Court, HO as to restrain the Bishop from further proceedings against Mr "Thackeray The first of these teohmcal objections was That as the Bishop s proceedings had extended to the final and absolute re- vocation of Mr Thackeray's license before the application was made to this Court for the rule nisi, therefore In technical language, * nothing remained for this Court to prohibit" The second of these technical objections to the prohibition was, that the Bishop had expressly stated, both before com roencing bis own quasi Court, on the SrdMarcb, and afterwards argued in this Court by his counsel, that the Bishop was inquir- ing into these matters, not as a " Court," but as a sort of " forum doinesticum, ' or in " foro conscientisi, or in some other capa- city which ft was contended did not constitute a "Court in law, and therefore was not open to prohibition These two objections are obviously rather contradictory to eaoh other, but may be easily answered, both seperately and combinedly And before considering the argumenta separately as questions of technical law, It may be as well ta remare that the practical eflect upon all the officating clergymen ot the Church of England, if either of these arguments can be maintained, either separately or combinedly, will un doubetdly be that their present form of license, though (like Mr Thackeray 8) absolutely unconditional in its terms will be subject to the sole will and pleasure of the Bishops by inhibition on any Saturdny afternoon against their performing divine service next morning and by consequence, the tenure or occupation by the clergymen of all their par- sonages will be open to the like ejectment through the Bishop«*" attorneys as is now pending against Mr Thackeray and his family , and this may be rendered final and irrevocable without the clergyman having in fact been guilty of the least offenoe exoept refusing to obey the Budden and illegal inhibition by the Bishop, or refusing to answer any scandalous reports, from which the Bishop may choose to require the clergyman to ex purgat himself, except to answer such rumours or chargea in open court, or before some legal tribunal known to our law I will now consider these technical arguments separately, and, first, as to the Bishop having absolutely revoked Mr Thackeray's hcenBe on the Cth day of March, 60 as to leave " nothing for this court to prohibit To this suggestion there are three conclusive answers, namely - First The revocation of the license being intended from the first to be, and being now, the basis of the now pending action of ejectment, under the Church Temporalities Act, the prohibition will obviously not be without operation, lor it will undoubtedly most effectually restrain all further proceedings in such ejectment, by this Court s judicial declaration apon this rule that the inhibition and revocation were both ihegal and void. Secondly The prohibition, being asked to restrain the pro. eeedings on the original inhibition, will, of course, thereby set aside the inhibition, as well as all the subsequent proceedinga, as illegal and void 7 Thirdly This Court will never allow the Bishop to maintain his own illegality m the inhibition merely by his having added to such illegality, by attempting to close the doors of this Court by the Bishop's revoking Mr Thackeray s license, almost concurrently with his having summoned him to appear and answer an illegal charge thus illegally adjudicated upon by tha Bishop The case of Leman v Goulty, 3 East, p 3 (1789) is also a direct authority against this argument, if any authority were required. With regard to the second technical objection, namely, thal the suggestion that these proceedings did not inasmuch consti- tute any ' Court " proceedings, and therefore were not open to " prohibition," these specious objections were all urged oefora the Privy Council in the Rev air Long s case, in the Bishop's defence against the action, and in almost precisely the same words as before this Court Nevertheless the objeotion ob- tained not the least sanction from the Pnvy Council as entitled to the least consideration by any Court of justice The sugges- tion, though m that case set up as a defence against Mr Long s action at law, ÍB clearly equally unavailing and Ineffec- tual as against any rule tor 'prohibition" or any otter proceed- ing in any Court of justice In the Rev Mr Long's case, as in the present cafe, tha Bishop had (p 423' directed the clergyman to ' understand that he was not at that stage summoned to a trial, but to a private meeting, at which he might oller, if he pleased, apology or explanation, and again, at p 424, " that the meeting was to be considered private, and not in the nature of a trial" Nevertheless the Privy Council (p 467) gently, but most decisively, dismissed all these " double aspect considerations out of all judicial consideration and Mid page 462, "with the Bishop's authority in spiritual matters," or "Mr Long's obligations in foroconsaentue," "we have not lo deal," &&, nor with the Bishop's sitting in "foro domestico" There also the Privy Council decided that, notwithstanding the final revocation of the Rev. Mr Long's license, and even the appointment by the Bishop of Mr Long's successor, still, for the purposes of Justice, -" the relation Of Bishop and licensed clergyman still continued existing in law at between thae two parties and the vahóle Question was before the Court, va -"Was i tin BuUop warranted by law it »suing the two orien etífur of suspension or deprivation " which Mr. LoDg Impugned ,8 being illegal and void, and which the Prliry Council overturned ab inibo. At page tee, their, lordships also My " The Judges of the supreme Cann of Cine Town were justified in examinicg, and indeed-were under the obligation of examining, the whole matter submitted to them, and seeing whether ihc pr ceedings ctmpiointd of teere conducted with due attention to the rules of eubstantialjustice and strict impartiality which are necessary to be observedby wHtnbunals^ ¿*c. Here, alto (at mer« matten of lact), oocurrinr; between Feb- ruary 19th and Mareil 5th. we bave the "charge" that be had disobeyed the Bishop by his performing diTine service after being forbidden so to do ; a summons to answer tor this disobe- dience at a Dud time and place-the Bishop's palara-the Bithop, chaplain, io., there present, the Judge being the Bithop, perhaps necessarily so,-Mr. Thackeray's appearance by countel and altorpey, and their protest;-the Bishop going OB still in bis illegal course, at then proposed agtintt Mr. I backe'ray, and the retirement after such protest by Mr. Thacke -ray'r counsel and attorney; and lastly, the so-called final de- cision of the Judqe. and the formal communication of euch tjuasi deoislon to the Rev. Mr. Thackeray the party summoned ; and now we ha,« most properly the appearance of the Bishop by cornual and attorney to maintain in this Court that this iiua«i deoislon was and it good and valid in law. If all this be net the proceedings of an intended " Court," 1 confess 1 am onlte at a loss to understand how the mere assertion by the Bishop, or his counsel or attorney, can etlablisb that this wat not acting as a " Court," and as tuch strictly and technically -within the scope of a " prohibition" in its narrowett possible bieaniig. : It mutt be remarked that the parties concerned in this matter are not in any sense the Right Ber Dr. Tyrrel and the Ker. Mr. Thackeray, but the Bithop of Newcastle and a .'censed presbyter of Ids diocese, and both parties are mntutlly perfect strangers to eaeh other, except in their ecclesiastical relation towards etch other. This attempted abnegation of hit episcopal functions, the Bishop Tery properly admits emanated from his then legal advisers, Mr. Alexander Gordon and Mr. Barker, who prepared a carefully- written memorandum even of the Bishop's words to be used before bli presbyter on that memor- able 4th day of March, 1874. It would indeed be a strange thing ii this Supreme Conrt should decide that any other quasi judicial functionary in the colony could protect himself and his Illegal documents and conduct from " prohibition," merely by a solemn assertion from his own lips, and subsequently repeated in bia affidavits and at this Bar, that he held no " Court," but only an " Inquiry" while engaged in these Illega- lities ; whloh assertion amounts, in fact, merely to this, that be did not with tbia Court to interfere by prohibition. The absurdity of such an argument, it advanoed by any Court of Petty Sessions or any mere Justice of the Peace, is too manifest to be listened to for an instant; and I do not lae that the argument acquires any strength from its being solemnly advanced and argued upon on behalf of a Bishop of the Church of Eogtaad, however much we may respect both the Bishoo and his office, more especially if the legal result of this assertion of " no Court" will be to turn the olergyman out of his appointment without the slightest real '? inquiry." If, Indeed, the Bishop's proceedings had been against Mr. or Mrt. Philpott, with regard to whom no legal relation existed, at between Bithop and the lay members of the Church of Eng- land, then indeed the Bishop probably would not be liable to *' prohibition," and this because Mr. and Mrs. Philpott would otherwise proteot themeelvea against these episcopal proceed- ings, as they have done, by an action of defamation ; or, it Mr. Thackeray had been inhibited or summoned toappaar, and pro- ceeded against by another Bishop, say the Bisbop of Armidale, towards wbom bt stood In no ecclesiastical relation whatever, then indeed I can also understand that no "prohibition" would be necessary, or need be issued, because no court could b» held at between such parties, and all such proceedings would be simply nugatory; but in the present case it is clear that a .'court" seat held, tbougb illegal in itt proceedings, ab ovo; and it is equally clear that nnder the decision of the Privy Connell in the Her. Mr. Long's case, this Supreme Court can- not listen to these assertions of the Bishop, or rather of his advisers, that these proceedings can be viewed as with a double atpect-" court" and " no court"-and thus the Bithop and his attorney can go on BOW unoheoked by " prohibition" to con- tinue these illegal proceedings against Mr. Thackeray till they eject bim from bia parsonage as well at lock him out of hit Dhurob. Moreover, it seems to me that the very recent case of Daw- kins v.Lord Kokeby,4 Kost, and Fin., and8L K, Q. B , S55, expressly decides that all "courts ot enquiry" are eo nomine "courts-," and, as such, therefore subject to ali the laws re- lating to "courts," whether "prohibitions" or any other branch of our law. I now cometo consider a very novel bnt serious argument, which is notât all teohulcal, but was advanced on the part of the Bithop in maintenance ot all these proceedings against our interferenae. It wat contended to this Conrt that the Bishop had precisely the same right to suspend or inhibit Mr. Tbaokeray from all bia church functions In the diocese of Newcastle, and also to go on to revoke his clergyman's license in tolo, that the Go- vernment and Executive Couucil of this colony has to suspend or inhibit a Clerk ot the Peace, or any other public servant or aubordinate official, from bit functions under our civil Govern- ment. I When this argument waB advancd at the bar, I merely asked the learned counsel to read to this Court the spiritual duties entrusted to the Rev. Mr. Thackeray and to all olergy luen by the ordination service, for the performance of which they then devoted and set apart their whole lives, after ihe «Oit solemn inquiries by the ordaining Bishop, both it the ordinations of deacons and priests, and their own ' most solemn assertion that " they are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon themselves this office and ministration-to serve God for the promoting of His glory and the edifying of His pejple-to read the gospel in the churcb of God, and to preach the same if licensed," to. ; "to search for the sick, poor, and impotent people of the parish, and to set themselves a wholesome example to the flock of Christ ; and always,to minister the doctrine and sacraments and the disci- pline of Christ, as the Lord bath commanded,' Sec, &c.; In truth the mere reading of the Ordination Service of a Deacon or Priest is far more than sufficient answer to this degrading suggestion or analogy now for the first time ad- vanced, and never before even hinted at in a newspaper, as to the offloe or status of a clergyman of any denomination whafever. Moreover, how can the Governor or head of a department be Assimilated to a bishop or a bishop to the Governor and Execu tire Council, nor ia Mr Thackeray in any sense the paid or hired servant of the Bishop of the Church of England, but a «acred though' subordinate functionary, ordained and set apart like the Bishop himself in a perfectly independent position to administer the holy sacraments and other ordinances of the ?Church of England, to the BOUIS of those persons who place themselves under their conjoint spiritual care in one diocese, as olshop and clergyman, according to the law of the land ana the doctrines of the Christian religion Lastly, to answer this argument ex absurdo, because the argument was so strenuously pressed upon the Court, it amply amounts to this, that if the Bishop can lawfully ex mero motu suspend or remove any one clergyman of his dioceBe from his ministrations, he can also lawfully suspend or remove all clergy- men from their present ministrations and homes, or even place the whole diocese under a Protestant interdict As a final objection to this prohibition, it was argued that these acandali were injurious to the Church and religion, and required these extraordinary proceedings on the part of the Bishop Anyone who peruses the interviews between these partiel and the narrative of the proceedings between the Bishop and Mr Thackeray from November, 1873, to t ebruary, 1874 till the 19th February, must see how eaEily these most dis- agreeable matters might have been investigated by the Bishop strictly according to law without any of the present litigati n, eo expensive and so persistently pressed to the present hour by the Bishop against Mr Thackeray In the lint place, the Bishop might have proceeded long ago to constitute the tribunal directed to be appointed under his own recent diocesan and provincial constitutions, &o;, signed and assented to both by himself and by Mr Thackeray, and by every other clergyman of the Newcastle diocese In fact, so far ao I ean judge from the several psssages set forth in Mr Thackeray's affidavit from the Bishop's own charges of late years, to ¿is clergy, in relation to the Privy Council decinons, this course would be most advisable for all parties, and cer- tainly seems not unacceptable to the Bishop bimself Secondly The Bishop, if he had any reasonable evidence to support these charges against Mr Thackeray, might have pro- ceeded ab inifto under the 19tb and 20th sections of the Church Temporalities Act, and called upon Mr Thackeray to show cause ' why his Ucenseshould not be revoked, ' though not on .the ground of rumours and scandals, but on the plain and in- telligible ground of Mr Thackeray's actual guilt of an "offence," as raquired by the Privy Council If the Bishop had adopted either of these two courses, Mr Thackeray would at least have had a fair opportunity of seeing and hearing his accusers " face to face, ' and all the principles of natural justice would have been maintained inviolate Moreover, by either of these two courses, the Bishop would have relieved him eel f from the extremely difficult position of double aspect and conflicting duties, so commented upon by the Privy Council in Mr Long a case, of being in effect Judge and prosecutor Inasmuch, as the Bishop had these two obvious courses open to bim, ii he had any real belief in the slightest foundation for these Bcandalous reports, whereby scandal might have been lawfully put an end to, and, inasmuch aa his advisers must have recommended him NOT to adopt either of these courses, I cannot help stating my clear opinion that the course in fact .adopted by the Bi&hop;, and now restrained by the present prohibition, was not, m fact, * necessary tn any sense for the food of the Church, which the Bishop, I am sure, must have ad in view, but was merely an attempt by the Bishop s adviiera to establish and maintain an aibitrary power m colonial ~b.sb.epi which the Courts of common law have always resisted as illegal, from the earliest times down to toe present day, and which the Privy Council have declared shall not be established or set up in our colonies I havs endeavoured to compréis the reasons for my present judgment into the shortest space, but I ought, perhaps, to ¡mention that I cannot see bow the three or tour cases cited as to "mandamus, can have any possible application to the preitnt prohibition case to restrain illegal proceedings ab ovo The English authorities cited as to the Queen s Benoh juris diction over bishops and other similar ecclesiastical dignitaries of the Church of England arc quite conclusive as to the English law on such cases as the present With regard to all the other cases cited to this Court or willoh which might have been cited-euch as Hodgson v Dil- lon, 2 CurteiB 338, and Harris v A B of Dublin, a B P C 170 l«t-it Is enough to remark that I consider the Pnvy Council to have clearly and authoritatively, as our Supreme Appellate Court, directed us to exclude from our colony any coercive jurisdiction not yet sanctioned by our own Legislature, and als» to exclude any English authorities from our judicial con- sideration which would practically " establish ' the Church of England in this colony by entitling the bishops of that com- munion to the extraordinary spiritual authority occasionally exercised by some of the fnglish bishops as an Established Church, while we also maintain the proper episcopal authority of " overseeing" that church like the spiritual head of any other communion, though modified by the episcopal office itself, and the status of bishop and presbyter per se The only question is whether the Church of England in this colony ia to be governed " according to law, ' or left to the vague control of pure English dicta and decisions to be picked out of the English Ecclesiastical Reports of the mather country, and which the Privy Council and English Judges have protected us from, as altogether without legal effeot upon, or any Application to, our simple state of ecclesiastical govern- ment. In my opinion this casa must be altogether decided upon the first principles of our Ecclesiastical law, whether laid by Pnvy Council Law, in our Ecclesiastical Constitutional Law, or in our Ecclesiastical Colonial Law, and that English statutes and reported cases, whether decisions or dicta, are of no use what ever in this case, -except so far as illustrative of such first principies, upon which alone I wish myjudgmentin this case to be founded. I think, also, that It would be a grievous misfortune to the bishop« and clergy of the Church of England in this or m any other colony, if this Court were to require either them or even their legal advisers to hunt out their respective or mutual lights and powers from any of these old law books of decisions or English Ecclesiastical Law, still lees to consult modern Eng- lish statutes as to ecclesiastical matters, instead of studying their mutual relations and duties by the lumiaous and com- prehensive decisions of the Pnvy Council, cited at the begin liingof th i B judgment. In conclusion, I can truly repeat what I said at the com- mencement, that I have given every part of this most painful and important case my most anxious consideration, specially aa bearing upon the invaluable ministrations of the bishops and clergy of the Church of England in this colony, and, as far as possible, according to their own peculiar ecclesiastical opinions, which they may nave formed or inculcated among themselves as bishop« and clergymen, independently of all common law of all Privy Council law, and or all other laws, but of which peculiar opinions we, as Judges, can have no judicial knowledge, nor recognise in any sense as law in a Court of Justice, though we always respect these opinions as ecclesiastical facts i I bave also endeavoured in this judgment to support, as much as I con soi mt toual y could, the largest spiritual authority of bishops If such be in fact claimed by the Bishop of Newcastle, although there is a wide interval between the mild episcopacy sought to be established by Archbishop Cranmer and the Aog boan bishops of Edward VI s reign, and the vast spintual power and the arbitrary authority claimed juie divino, by Archbishop Land and the late Bishop of Exeter As for any wilful tyranny or intentional oppression on the part of the Bishop of Newcastle towards Mr Thackeray, nothing of the kind ought ever for a single instant to be imputed to any Christian bishop, and more especially not to a bishop who has lived for above a quarter of a century among us in the most perfect blamelessnesa of character, both as a bishop and as a Christian, always untouched by the slightest imputation of harshness or unkindnessto a Bingle human being , But while I speak with the deepest veneration of the Bißhop of Newcastle, and haye put the most equitable construction I can upon all his acts and conduct throughout these transac- tions, I must also put the like fair construction upon all the acts and conduct ol the Rev Mr Thackeray throughout these transactions, especially when considered with reference to all his, past unblemished life ever since hia ordination in the year 1S53 down to the present date, or rather down to the com- mencement of the recent proceedings in November last, I must place myself in hit grievous position when he waa for- mally charged in writing by his own bishop-under whose eye be had been officiating in blameless punty and ministenal effectiveness for above seventeen years-charged I say grievously I -charged with actual and grois " cnminahty" witba lady, with whose husband and children Ur Thackeray and hu own wife and children were in daily intercourse. I do think that Mr. Thackeray was fully Justified In indignantly and at once resisting such accusations, though cautiously framed only in the shape of slanderous reports, but endorsed by his bishop I think Mr Thackeray was forced to reBist his bishop as be has done, and. bring the whole matter into open Court. By endorsing these reporta on February 19th, Mr Thackeray's whole life and conduct became at stake, his character was boldly assailed by the Bishop, by hu belieVÎDg these credulous churchwardens, who on their part were manifestly far too ready to listen to the two or three malignante mentiened In Mr Thackeray's affidavit and the pmnent gossip of the Weat Maitland scandalmongers. I say that Mr Thackeray*« whole character waa at stake, not only as a clergy- man and ft christian gentleman, but also as a husband and a father, and bis public life at St Pani a was also at stake, after having spiritually miniitered as a presbyter to his congregation for seventeen years and was like his biihop's character on the Ird November, 1873, perfectly untouched by the slightest Imputation of indecency or impurity , and Mr Thackeray also was on the 19th February fully entitled, and is fully entitled now, to the benefit of such unblemished character, as a prima facie refutation of every possible " slanderous report' -that might be circulated to his prejudice in West Maitland, or brought in any way to the Bishop i ear* Moreover, I cannot help thinking that U the Bishop bad in the first instance shown some desire to establish the proper tribunal under the constitutions, or at least shown some appre- ciation of Mr Thackeray's perfectly unblemished character a« against such foul charges, and if he had indignantly and at once told these churchwardens that he considered Mr Thackeray ? unblemished character as under his own episcopal protection, he. would at once baye enlisted the wannest sympathies of these caurehwardena with his own sympathies, and tbe whole of these slanderous rumours would have been dissipated to the winds, Instead ot acquiring, aa they moat unfortunately must have done, i o great s degree of temporary credibility, through the Bishop'! endorsement of these rumours by thtee most ill advised and arbitrary proceedings, which, I am rejoiced to know, were and to the present date bave been entirely tbe result of bia legal advisers, and in no sense emanating inten- tionally from the Bishop himself, though necessarily conducted in the Bishop's name With regard to coeta, 1 regret that I feel bound to adopt the words of the Privy Council in tbe Bev. Mr. Longs case (p 470) that while I feel the deeply responsible posi- tion of the Bishop in the conscientious discharge of his I public duty, still I cannot put out of consideration, on the other Laud, that the Rev Air Thackeray has been put to great trouble and expense by these most unnecessary and unlawful proceedings on the part of the Bishop of Ken castle, and the cost» therefore, must, as ia Mr Long s case, follow the order to make the rule for the prohibition absolute Mr Justice CHEESE said, After the able judgments now delivered by the Court, and the law and facts of the case so tully enlarged upon, I shall confine myself as concisely as possible, to a few remarks upon the conclusion I have arrived at applicable to this rule The argument adduced for consideration included in effect, this proposition - . W nemer the Bishop of Newcastle possessed the Ecclesiastical jurisdiction and authority to inhibit tbe Reverend Mr Thacke- ray from publicly exercising any of his ministerial functions, as well as revoking his license as presbyter in the church of St Faul, West Maitland, and if aye whether the Bishop exercised such Jurisdiction and authority under the decision of a com petent Court InJLREq p 54 and 56, .. Bishop of \atal v Gladstone' (18GO the Master of the Rolls, Lord Romilly» enunciated ih his able judgment this principle ** ihe Bishops of all colonies having an established Legisla- ture, but no Established Church, can, as regards the ministers and congregations of the Church of England within their diocese, exercise all the powers of a bishop- they can ordain, confirm and consecrate, they can do more they can vi it, in- vestigate, reprove suspend, and deprive, and if, in so doing, they keep within the due scope of their authority aa established by the discipline of the Church of England as by law estab lmhed, and proceed to the exercise of that authority ia a manner consonant to the principles of justice, their acte are valid and will be enforced by the legal tribunals It is only when their acts fall in these rcpects, when they exceed their authority as regulated by the law of the Cbnrch of Kngland, or when they proceed lu a manner not consonant with the prin- ciples of justice that the Bishops cease to be able to enforce their decisions " His Lordship further remarks at page 56 - "The powers belonging to a bishop, according to all principal authorities, are-first, the power ordims, second jurudic ttoms, third, admintstratwnis rei famtlians The colonial bishop possesses the first unfettered, without control or appeal, the second he possesses in this way-that he must apply to lay tribunals to enforce his decisions which lay tribunals will review them, and consider their correctness according to the law which the bishop htmBelf is bound to administer, the third he does not possets at all-it was not e\er proposed to be given to him, it belongs to a different officer, and to a different tribunal ' In this laborious and well considered judgment of his lord- ship, is defined the status of co'omal bishops and clearly deter- mines the jurisdiction and powers of the bishop HI reference to his presbyters, and it appears also under cousentionul contract, they are, in principle, acknowledged and bouud to each other, applicable to the vituations and positions they severally occupy In thi9 colony, however, by the Act of Council 8 Will 4 No 5 (1873) the English Church Temporalities Act, an Act intituled to regulate the temporal affairs of Churches and Chapels of the United Church of Eugland and Ireland in New South Walec, it appears to me, the position of bishop and presbyter is legal!} defined and in my judg- ment I Miall chiefly confine myself to the legal interpretation of that Act, whether the Bishop has under the powers conferred upon bim legally followed the provisions of that Act in regard to the Rev Mr Thackeray, or whether that litter gentleman is entitled to his writ of prohibition By section 19 it is enacted, " No person shall be allowed to officiate aB chaplain or minister unless duly licensed by the Bishop of the diocese." Section JO enacts * That it shall and may be lawful for the clergymen in holy order* of the United Church of Lu g1 and and Ireland who Bhall be duly hoensed by the Bishop to officiate in any church or chapel under this Act so long as he shall be so licensed to hare tree access und admission to and in suoh church or chapel and the burying ground belonging thereto and every part thereof respectively at all time?, as ne shall think fit, and freely to exercise his spiritual functions therein respec- tively without any hindrance or disturbance of the trustees of the same or any person whatever, and such officiating minister shall and may during such times as aforesaid freely use, have, possess and eu joy the ministers dwelling-house, garden appurtenaneet>, and glebe belonging to such church or chapel and receive have and take the rents, profits and ««sues and every part thereof respectively Provided always that no such liberty of access and admirsion to such house of residence as aforesaid nor occupation of the same for any length of time whatsoever, shall be construed to confer any right of property in the same upon the clergyman or other parties by wbom such house of residence and the appurtenances may have been BO occupied, nor any right or title to retain pos se*sion of the same, ASTEH the tícense of such clergy/nan shall hate been withdrawn, cancelled, or revoked, by the Bishop of the diocese upon cause shown, nor shall the samo be pleaded in bar of any action of ejectment which may be brought by or on behalt of the trustees or churchwardens of any church or chapel as aforesaid for recovering possession of such houBe ot residence and the appurtenance* thereof * In view of such plain, clear, comprehensive word*, in what manner did the Bishop act* On the 19th Januar), 1874, be forwards a cumtuuuication to Mr Thackeray, inter alta-1 I have, after duo consideration felt myself compelled to inhibit you, as I now do, from publicly exercising any of your ministerial functions at the church of Saint Paul, West Maitland, until you have satisfied me of the groundlessness of the charge involved in the report«, or I shall ave been enabled to investigate the matter, in case it should become necessary. I have to request that you will send me a reply to such charges within seven dayB alter the service of this inhibition to you " i On the following day (the 20th) Mr Thackeray replies, ' disputing the jurisdiction of the Bishop to interfere with the discharge of his dutiej until cause shown before a competent tribunal On the Sunday following, the 22nd, one of the churchwardens informs Mr Thackeray it was not their intention to interfere with htm in the performance of divine service, that if he did not celebrate it there would be no service that day accor- dingly! Mr Thackeray officiated On the 26th February the Bishop then forwards the further communication to Mr Thacke- ray, tnter aha, " I am informed that in disregard of the duty which you, as a clergy an owe to me as the Biehop to whom is committed the charge of government over you, and under whose license you have hitherto officiated as minister of Saint raul'B Church, West Maitland, >ou did, on Suuda>, the 22nd instant, contrary and in wilful dtsobedieuce to my direction, perform divine service in the said church Now, therefore, £ do hereby require you to appear before me at my residence. Morpeth, on lue«day, 3rd March, at 12 o'clock noon, to show cause why the license granted to you by me, dated 13th May, 1856, under which you have hitherto officiated as minuter of said church, and all or any other licenses or faculties under which you are entitled, or claim tobe entitled, to officiate as the clergyman in the said church or elsewhere, should not be withdrawn, cancelled, or revoked, for that you being a licensed c1 erg) man of the dioceBe did, by officiating in the said church on bunday last, under the circumstance* hereinbefore men- tioned, wilfully, and againBt your duty as such clergyman, dis- obey my reasonable and lawful direction as yonr Bishop, and refuse to pay such obedience as is due from you to me, as the Bishop of the dioceBe under whose license alone you have any right to ofliciitfl ia the said church In case you shall refuee to attend before me as hereby required, I Bhall, at the time and place above specified, proceed to inquire into and determine the matter in such manner as appears to me to be just, and In accordance with my duty as the Bishop of this diocese ' Mr Thackeray was also served with notice to produce his license On the day of the inquiry the Bishop's chaplain, the Chancellor of the diocese, the churchwardens of St. Paul s, and a Mr Carroll (who was to give evidence), assembled at the Bishop's residence Mr Thackeray's counsel and solicitor, Mr Wisdom and Mr Stratford, appeared for him, and Mr Wisdom protested in his c1 ent's name against the competency of the tribunal He also read the following written protest from Mr lhackeray - March 3rd. 1874 Right Rev Sir,-In answer to > our letter dated 26th ultimo, in which you ask me to attend before you this day to show cause why my license as incumbent of this parish should not be cancelled or revoked on account of alleged disobedience to you as Bishop of the diocese, I have to inform you that I disregard your so called inhibition, not because I am unwilling to submit to lawful authority, or in any way to set aside the obediei ce I owe you as my BiBhop in all things lawful and honest, but because I am advised that you have no power or authority to act as yon are doing, or to hold a Court of inquiry in which you would occupy the very anomalous position of judge, jury, prosecutor, and executioner I may also observe that you have yourself been teaching the whole diocese this great lesson for some yea» as see your addresses at the several sessions of S> nod I now beg to inform you again that I am now ready to justify my conduct as to the several charges the result of pure gossip, -which you have been pleased to make against me, but it muit be before a competent tnbunal, and not before yon personally, whose malus animus towards me is so well known and also In face of the statement, which I folly believe, to the eiltet that yon have already prejudged the whole matter, and that you have offered my living to a gentleman who expressed hu willwguess to accept it even before it became vacant I wish y ou to understand most distinctly that I appear before you this morning by counsel not because I in any way recognise the authority of your present proceedings, but to worn you very respectfully against any action on your part which may be detri mental to my interests, asia the event of injury at your iiands I shall seek redress id the Supreme Court, where I shall doubtless receive tha* justice w h ich I must confess, I cannot look for from you. I yield to no man in my estimate of the respect which is due to the episcopal office, and the duty that a clergyman owes to his bishop, but I feel that I cannot but protest earnestly, yet mast respectfully, against what I must consider a psnutent course of cruelty aud oppression * Having read this protest, Mr Wisdom asked whether this was an open Court to which the public had access, the Bishop replied that it was not a court in the ordinary sense of the term, but a * forum domesticum * Mr Wisdom then with drew and the invesltgation proceeded The result waa the Bishop revoked Mr Thackeray *a license, and the following day sent a formal cancellation of such license, with a letter dated 4th March, 1874, fully explanatory of all matters, actings, and oonclmioDS Granting that the language of Mr Thackeray was not strictly in accordance to, or becoming the position of a clergy- man with his bishop, yet it must be considered that the Bishop had had previous communication with Mr Thackeray in rela- tion to ' the alleged scandals which the latter had denied and repudiated and therefore perhaps, some slight excuse for his excitement conduct and language, honestly as he might bava considered for his own vindication The question still arises, taking the language of Mr lhackeray in the strongest sense, Was the Bishop justified in his actings and proceediugB under the 20th section of our Church Temporalities Act ? A few simple remarks will clearly show and summarise the actings of the Bishop On the 19th February (1874) the Bishop by his letter inhibits and suspends Mr Thackeray from exercising any of his minis- terial function , without in any way ceiling upon him to show cause why such inhibition or suspension should take place On the following day Mr Thackeray protests On the 22nd Mr Thackeray officiates at St Paul a at the re- quest of the churchwardens On the 26th, the Bishop, in consequence of alleged disobedi- ence, then gives him notice to show cause before bim on the 3rd March why bis I icen Be should not be cancelled or revoked, and it is revoked accordingly The Temporalities Act plainly provides and enacts (eectíon 20) inter alia " A clergyman, so tong as he shall be BO licensed, shall have free access and admission to and in Buch church or chapel, and possess and enjoy the dwelling house &c;, untU (under the proviso) such license be cancelled by the bishop upon cause shown ' I will not dispute that tbe Bishop was fully justified, from the scandals he had heard to call upon Mr Thackeray to show cause tor explanation He suspends bim however, in the first instance, without taking the trouble to give him any notice to show cause, and Mr Thackeray, having only insisted on his lawful and legal rights, could not then render his conduct to be considered in the light or ßpint of contumacious The Bi hop .having acted contrary to the words and spirit of our Church Temporalities Act in the first instance, he could not, in my opinion, substitute and convert bis after actings into an act ef legality by the BubBequent notice to show cause on the 3rd March The case in 6 M P C, p 392, Willis v Sir George Gipps, appears to me in point-a well known oaae in this colony-the amotion of Mr Justice Willis by Sir George GippB, and although no judgment was delivered, yet the Lords of the Committee reported, in their opinion, that the Governor in Connell had power to remove Mr Willis from his office of Judge, under tbe anthonty of the ¿3rd George III., and upon the facts appearing before the Governor in Coun- cil, and established before their Lordships in this case, there were sufficient ground* for the amotion of M r Willis, but their Lordships were of «pinion that -the-Governor and Council ought to have given him some opportunity of being previously beard against the amotion Jiot^having done so, the order ought to be reversed and accordingly the order was considered illegal, and reversed . The proposition for consideration therefore now is, under the circumstances of this case, can the rule for the wnt of prohibí tion be made absolute. It is established that the writ of prohibition may issne to a Court Ecclesiastical, see in re Gorham v Bishop of Exeter (5Exch G30 S C 15, Q B 52>, supported also by many other decisions, where something is being done by it contrary to the general law ot the land, or manifestly out of the jurisdiction of the Court, and in ex parte Storey (13 C R., 777), Maule, J,, in his judgment sajs, "Where, as in the case of Caple v Child, (Q C Bud J, 558 ) which was in substanee and effect the same as ex parte limning (10 Q B 780) The Ecclesiastical Court, m proceeding against a person who has never been called into it at all is a proceeding in a manner that is contrary to natural justice, and this Court may prohibit And again, Talfourd, J , in the same case, saya -" 1 he general doctnne is well known that prohibition is never granted when the Court sought to be affected by it has clear jurisdiction, unless if is proceeding tn a mannnr contrary to the principles (uot the rules) of common law There may be a ground of com- plaint if the Ecclesiastical Court assume to pronounce a judg- ment again Bt a party who had never been cited Although this question may be surrounded with some diffi- culty, the Bishop having issued his summons to Mr Thackeray to show cause-still, when was the summons issued * JVof, as before remarked until the Bishop had distinctly inhibited Mr Thackeray from the duties of his Church, and without notice or cause «Tunon/-and consequently, by BO proceeding, in my opinion such actings of the Bishop can only legally and equit- ably be construed under the au thon ties cited as acts and con- duct contrary to the principles of natural justice The only further remaining question is whether the meeting " in foro domestico, convened and holden by the Bishop at his own residence can be legally considered a Court against the proceedings of which the wnt ol prohibition can issue Upon this point I entertain and must express som« doubt and embarrassment. Still, as the Bishop issued hia summons citing Mr Thackeray to appear before lum-that he did appear by his counsel and attorney-the Bishop not merely in form, but substantially the prosecutor (and a prosecutor whose feelings from motives of public duty, as well as from the heat necea sanly generated In the purest minds by the controversy, deeply interested in the question), presided-that he was as isted by the presence of his own chaplain his attorney, and one of the churchwardens ? that the question applicable to the position of Mr Thackeray was, exparie, duly considered, and finally, that the judgment waa pronounced by thp Bishop in form, and notice of the sentence given The conclusion I have arrived at there fore», under the authonty of tbe judgmei t in the case of Long T the Bishop of Cape Town, IMP C. N S. m pp 461 to 4G8, that in principle of that decibion a Court was so constituted Under the reoent decision of Dawkins v Lord Rokeby (1873)* 8 L It, Q B , 255, the same principle is distinctly adopted in the judgment pronounced by the Chief Justice, " that although a court-martial was a court of inquiry, not a court of law, & court of record, or a court of justice, still such pointe of in- quiry possessed the qualities of a court of justice" If in error on this point, I am of opinion it is far more de- sirable in the ends of justice to be so decided, espe- cially as it will enable the Bishop to ventilate this vital question before the highest tnbunal, the Privy Council, and establish upon ita proper basis tbe status of the Bishop of New- castle beyond dispute with his presbyters thoughout the dio- cese I consider, therefore, that the rule for the writ of prohibition should be made absolute Upon the question of costs, as applicant has succeeded in his rule, and as the question involved is most important, Mr Thackeray is consequently entitled in my opinion, to his costs An exemplary female in Wajnesburg, Pnnn, is well under way m her forty-eighth perusal of the Bibl# from Gentses to Revelations,
