SATURDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1878. In any amendment of the Local Government Act which the Government may take in hand, provision should be made for the infliction of penalties on municipal councils transgressing against the letter 0r spirit of the statute. Offenders against the letter should be made amenable to the law courts by some easy process, while those who evade the spirit should be liable to a reduction in the amount going to thcni foi subsidy oi licence foe , al the discietion of the Mnustei 'Jins suljcct is igain foiccd ou otu attention bj the fact th it amount ti o othei niCniilaiities of milich the local autluiitics at lïutlieijJen hive been guilt), as ve lenn fiom tho auditois' icpoit, is the employment of thon f cie tu j as slmc ciigineei If wo may jud0e of tins man s competency as au engineei bj the pi oofs ho has given of his abihtv a« an accountant, we cm but anne at the conclusion that it is a monstious slutnc that state and local funds should be expended undei Ins management Butapait horn the abuse, such a piocecding is m diioct contraven tion cf the law The act says (clause 174)-"No peison shall hereafter bo " appointed a suivoyoi oi engineer by " any council under this act unless he is " the holdei of a ceitificate of competency "as a sunejoi of land and «oiks " gianted uiidei the piovisions of some " act hoiobj repealed, oi of a certificate "of the Municipal Suivoyon Boaul undei the piovisions of this act ' Nothing could be plainer than this pi o vision, and the reason foi its enactment is as cleai as its language Apait fiom the geneial duty of the state to see that institutions cicated by its authouty aie calculated to piomote the interest of those on whom they aie imposed, the community at large has a diiect interest m seeing that the money locally expended is laid out to advantage Not only is the public Tieasury chai god with veiy keayy subsidies to municipalities, but whenevci any extraordinary oxpendi turo is incuiied, it is applied to foi special assistance Tor instance, when loads, bridges, oi cuheits are swept away by Hoods, deputations seel m¿ pecuniary help pom in fiom all direc tions, but in many cases it would be found, if stnet liicjiury wen, made, t'>at the clisasteis have anson solely from the fact that the woiks had beon con stnicted, in defiance of tho hw, by m competent men llie hw in man.) instance^ is syste maticallj evaded m this respect In tint pitiful spilt of cheesepaung to which we alluded reconth, many local bod e-> cannot bring themselves to pay tho sum needed to secuie the sei vice-, of a qua' ficd engineei Some c dons on the councils, who could neithei take a le\el noi add up a cdiimn of h0uies to save then souls, undertake, as "piactical "men,' to supeiintend the execution of public woiks A peison is appointed to act undei thom, whose ignoiance makes lum a fitting assistant Uns deputy "practical man'is not st) led engineei oi survejoi, of course, as tint would be iljing dnectly in the fico of the statute, but is dubbed "ovei "seei of woils, oi "cleik of woiks, or "loadsupenntendent, ' oi is called by some other fancy title At Puithcrglcn, appaientlj, no designation is employed to signify the seciotary s connexion with the public woiks of the shne "Mi DONAID BKOWN, duung the time not spent in muddling Ins books and mam pulatmg the shue funds, turns his atten tion to tlie vauous undei taking-, set on foot by th s model municipality, in simple and open defence of tho statute theicin mado and piovided A stop chould be put at once to this sj stem, and expeuenco shows that it can only be clone by the infliction of penalties m the vv aj v\ o Im c poi it I cut The countiy Ins need of eveiy penny it canmustei in caiijing out the new woiks necessaiy to make it habitable We want liuiidieds, aye, thousands, of miles of main and cioss loads, drainage woiks, wateivoiks, plantations, and countless othei Mungi, to render tho place "comfoitable, and we cannot afibid to waste nionoy m doing the same woik over and ovei again m oidei to please those "pncuien' "men" who condescend to place their very expensive talents at the sen ice of the local bodies, oi to minister to that silly ciavmg foi extravagant economy with which some municipal tici aie afflicted The framers of the Local Government Act were cleaily of op) non that public w orks should be cain lout accoidmg to the clesigis and mulei the ?nipeiiiitendcnceofccmpetentpiofcssioml men, and the soonei steps aie taken to make the piovi&ion;

The reward for the other members of the gang remains unaltered. Mr Berry also tele- graphed to Captain Standish, informing that officer that if he thinks the Local Artillery force can be of service in defending, the banks and places of business in the towns near the ranges, the corps will be placed at his dis- posal. The rumour reported by our Euroa correspondent that the Kellys had stuck up Messrs Stodart and Rowe's station requires confirmation, as it seems probable, if such a thing had occurred, that news would have reached us from Alexandra. With reference to the account we published yesterday of the last moments of Sergeant Kennedy, our Mansfield correspondent tele- graphs that no doubt whatever is felt in the district but that there was a long conversa- lion between the Kellys and the sergeant previous to the death of the latter. It will be remembered that in the letter sent to Mr Monk, and signed E and D Kelly, and believed to be the work of a well- known confederate of the gang, the state- ment is made, "Your friend Kennedy is gone, although we made him confess many things and many little things you told him in confidence." Mrs Kennedy, so far, has not received the letter said to have been written by her husband, and the belief is, that if there is anything in it which would in any way destroy the gloss the ruffians choose to put on their actions she never will. Our correspondent adds -"The Kellys are now believed to be on the Strathbogie Ranges, and as some of their pals are now in Mansfield, it is not unlkely that the gang are not far away. The police have just been despatched somewhere in treat haste.? Ave received quite a budget of letters yes- terday, offering suggestions as to how the bushrangers might be suppressed. One cor- respondent says - Let Mr Berry summon Parliament and pass an act suspending the Habeas Corpus Act for a limited time-say six months-and with respect to a limited district. Then every person suspected of aiding or abetting the murderers can be imprisoned and detained during the suspension of the act and this would root out the scoundrelism which infests the Mansfield district. Another suggests the forniing of a "mounted brigade" under an able leader, for the support of which the banks and squatters might subscribe. Others submit that a call for volunteers should be made, and some of the "unem= ployed" say they would be willing to offer their services for a small remuneration, pro- vided they were competent to earn the Government reward.
