STEWART'S BRIDGE. (to the editor.) Sir,â€”There is a great quantity of large trees, with roots and tops, coming down the Goulburn River, and I have been hard at work since sevon o'clock on Sunday morning trying to keep the bridge clear. I have three men assisting me. If I had proper tackling, with the assistance of one man, I could clear it in half a day. So, Mr Editor, you see that all my trouble is for the want of proper tackling. If I don't manage, to clear it by to-night I am afraid that something will happen to the bridge. She is only a " ghost" of a bridge, and is very unsteady. I wrote to the Echuca shire twice and to the Numurkah shire twice to send me tackling, and if I don't get it soon I am afraid I will have to give up the " ghost." - \- Yours etc., JAMES D. GRAY, Stewart's Bridge.
