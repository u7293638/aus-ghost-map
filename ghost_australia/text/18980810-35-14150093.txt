W. W Rutledge, delivered an address on the subject of Methodism and the forward movement He saw that the forward movement was not a departure from the Methodist doctrine or policy, but implied a heaven-born call for souls It was very difficult nowadays to win souls, but the forward movement declared its faith in God and in the Holy Ghost The chief feature of the forward movement was wise adaptation of methods and means to secure the end sought The movement also recognised philanthropic work, and believed in caring for the body as well as the soul In concluding he said that, judged by its front the forward movement was worthy of their approval The Rev Theo Parr, M. A. , of the Wickham Primitive Methodist Church, followed with an earnest and appropriate address The Rev li W T Pincombe, of the Newcastle.
