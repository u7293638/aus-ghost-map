sufferers are two and a at Amsterdam which are involved to the extent of nearly £210 000 One of these institutions (the Ki locale Bank) announced on J desires) that it was compelled to stop payment owing to the locking up of large sums of money in advances to planters The Dutch Gol coming home we came to its leaf and, to prevent the disastrous consequences of a suspension to the traders in colonial produce has granted an extension of tune to meet its liabilities ] Efforts are being made to avert the crisis that would be caused by the closing of the immer ous sugar factories connected with the Dutch colonial banks 1 hQ Java sugar trade has been wonderfully profitable for many years past the cost of production being very low, but the late decline in best produce has for the time crippled the industry till WOOL MART 1 The concluding series of colonial wool sales commenced on Tuesday) evening last when two miscellaneous catalogues comprising 7 109 bales were brought forward by Messrs Balme and Co and Messrs Jacomb and Sons The attendance of buyers from all parts was as large as usual at this time of the ) mr and while good competition was manifested for all Australasian produce no improvement in prices was established on the first evening This, however is no matter for surprise as the selection offered w as on the whole it very poor and indifferent one For Cape scoured and snow white wools which were in limited 1 supply, the demand was inanimate the prices realised were about on a par with the average of the August September auctions, crossbreds being somewhat firmer The gross arrivals for the sires are returned as follows -New South Malts 2188 bales, Queensland, llJl'J Victoria It UM South Australia 22 lb Western AuBtrulm In luBinaiiiu 515 New Zealand 23 lib Cape (Eastern Province 2174 Western Province 1 bo!, Port Natal 3 410) 28 98 total 133 781 bales. Of the above about 5000 bales (any COO Australasian had 10 COO South African) have been despatched direct to the various manufacturing districts thus leaving a net quantity of 122 781 bales which with about 20 9000 bales of old stock give 142 781 bales as the available supply for the sales Of the first arrivals it is estimated that from 35 000 to 40 000 bulcB consist of produce of the new clip Recent advices from Bradford state that Alderman Smith, the newly elected mayor alluding to the condition of the staple trade of the town, remarked that the commercial cloud which for some time hunt over the plan had dispersed He believes Bradford had never at any period of its history done as much work as it is now doing Not only are the whole of the operatives employed, but there is a scarcity of them and machinery is now standing idle for want of hands It has been known that the woollen and worsted branches have of late been exceptionally prosperous among our own manufacturers, but few people were aware that commercial activity at Bradford had attained the point of prosperity indicated by the mayors rosy remarks The Wednesday and Thursday evening sales were marked by great steadiness and the prices current on the opening day were well maintained Ar. owing to present at managements, the series will close on the 29th November. Tin: NUiiiAT TO Mrs 'I here has been no appreciable change in the condition of the wheat trade during the past fortnight. The home supplies have not been excessive, while those from abroad have been upon II more restricted though ample HI ole. Prices have not varied materially, though in some institutes a ru dilution of 6d. per quill ter must be quoted, both us legnrdsHiigbsh and foreign produce The quantity of wheat afloat to the United Kingdom from all districts, excepting the Jurassic, has fallen away from 1,71 6,000 quin here last week!, to Í,*í"),0ü0 quarters, being a reduction of 111,000 quarters There is also a small diminution in them There is said to be a considerable reduction in our granaries stocks of wheat in London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Gloucester and Bristol, which are estimated at about 1,.100,000 (platters, being barely two thirds of the (plan tin) in stock a year ago. This, so far as it goes, is encouraging to the wheat producer It is plain that the low prices have had the effect of so expelling foreign wheat us to lighten the load on the hands of the dealers very considerable, and it is probable that a cultivation so unremunerative will undergo cm ailment next year in America, India, and, perhaps, the Australasian colonies. The Hunting ungo market has been helped a little by some inquiry on Continent of account, but the amount of business altogether in that direction has been "much. Armed Australian parcels realise only horn like to 'IDs pel SOIL and some transactions have taken place in new crop Australians, tor December 1 can carry shipment, at bags. per 1864 c, and i Messrs Hume Brothers state that there are increasing complaints of the very short out-turn of Australian wheat cargoes and parcels, and the feeling is growing strong that buy ers must operate only on 1861 delivered weights The once of Hour has at length followed the course of wheat. The top price has lately) been put down 2s per sack, winch reduce. the value of the best Hour to Tis per 280 lb This is a degree of depression without pre- it dent, and plant has just occurred with respect to English Hour has for some, time been the case with imported descriptions 'Under the American sacks in the market at His and the very (most North-Western Hour made from the splendid v heat of Minnesota, and possessing exceptional strength and merit, had fallen to its some weeks before the best English yielded to the force of competition and full kit feeling, and was reduced to tons per sack The purely fancy Hour which is shipped from Tnestestill makes 10s to 15s , but the pastrycook and not the baker is concerned with this article Aus trade in Hour is not extraordinarily) plentiful, while its rich colour and fine qualities have always made it a favourite wherever procurable At the present time last sacks can be bought as low IIS_")H and the mist in the market can be laid as the buyer who offers 25s per sack The upshot of all this is that, whether a pure English loaf be wanted, or a line Australian one, of a good American one, of an extra quality mixture of English and foreign, the bout in question can be had at about Id cost price and at fad in retail, delivery and credit trade. The loaf can be had at this price by the consumer, but the producer cannot go on producing it at such an unremunerative rate According to Messrs.

The trade is again almost at a standstill, the prices Intel, offered having been salt for their reduced (Growers, however, decline to accept the rates oil creek, although some of them an willing to sell for rather less money than they at first demanded. 'I his state of the market is attributed to the action of merchants who, it is currently reported, have sent back growths purchased by them to be re sold, and thus, by underselling the market, are endeavouring to knock down prices 1 ust Kent planters find trade more unfavourable than usual this year, inasmuch as the quality of the series of crop is too good for their purposes The best growths of Weald and West Kent hops are sufficiently choice to be used this year l>> the brewers, who in other seasons have found it necessary to purchase the finest East Kent growths On the Canterbury Exchange last Saturday, offers of 17 7s. for some line all round lots were refused, and the business done was very limited London factories report an extremely dull demand in the Borough, where the highest price obtainable for choice East Kent hops is "8 per cwt On Nos came r 10 Messrs Tubrum and Son stated that " the market has been much depressed, and prices are lower all round This has been brought about by the anxiety of some holders to quit stocks and the inability of other holders to stand still, coupled with the pressure of Continental and American hops Consumers are still cautious, and find that a hand to mouth policy is to their advantage Continental hops have fallen in price, and Americans me easier " It is stated that a big growth of Just Kents has been exported to Australia. Messrs AVoollston, on November 10, report that consumers still refrain from purchasing beyond their immediate requirements, and merchants are necessarily) guided by their inaction This keeps business depressed and causes the market to be very weak, the more so as growers exhibit some eagerness to sell, and are prepared in most cases to submit to a considerable reduction in values, more particularly with regard to high class geldings Continental markets are again cheaper, but values of beat Americans are about maintained, us the quality of their crop is stated to be disappointing The dispute between the hopgrowers and the southern railway companies in respect to their tariff for the conveyance of hops ism fair way of amicable settlement. A reduction in the charges is to be made, amounting to about 9d per pocket, or within 3d of the sum which, according to ihcruilvvuy commissioners' recent decision, the companies can only legally charge. At an influential meeting on Saturday last a committee was appointed to settle all questions in dispute, and to secure, if possible, a return of past overcharges
