HOLY "SPIRIT PROMISED. May 28.—Afternoon. Golden Text, Acts i. 8.—Reading, Joel ii. 21—32. The central thought of this lesson brought out in the Golden Text, Acts i. 8. I. The Promise.—" Power of the Holy Ghost coming on you." .. Predicted by prophets (Joel ii. 28; Zech. ii. 12). Promised by Christ (John xiv. 16,17, 26). Realised by apostles (Acts ii. 23). 'Enjoyed by all who will receive Him (Ephes. i. 13; 2 Cor. i. 22). II. The puty.—" Be witnesses." 1. In Jerusalem, or where Christ is rejected. 2. In Samaria, or where prejudice is strong. 3. In uttermost parts, or where salvation is unknown. Tell the story of some witnesses for Christ, the Malagasy. Stephen, Polycarp, Brainerd, Henry Martyn, Jr. Williams. > Apply practically according to the position and character of scholars. The Book of Acts the best expositor of Joel u. 21 to 32. Divide the verses into two groups ; yet. 21 to 28. The Spirit to'be cherished. Be glad, rejoice, &c.;, contrasted with chap, i., "howl," "lament," "be ashamed." Why this change P See chap. i. 12,13. Joy after repentance and forgiveness. Compare ver. 22 to 25 with chap i. 18, 20, 10, 4. Wherever iniquity of Judah had brought curses, there the mercy of God would bring blessings. These verses literally fulfilled to Judah. Oar sins greater. Our repentance to be deeper. Our pardon ensured through Christ. Our joy and confidence should abound. Ver. 28—32. III. The blessings to oe bestowed.—" The Spirit poured out." distinctly fulfilled in apostolic days. Ultimate fulfilment not yet realised. (1) The personality of the Spirit. Word frequently used, as spirit of the times, spirit of a book, spirit of the nation, spirit of nature; used in several senses in the Bible. First and last, a Spirit of God (see Gen. i. 2,3; Rev. xxii. 17). The Spirit said to "teach," "invite," "convince," "intercede," "be grieved," " give as He will." Refer to texts. " (2) The abundance of the gift. "Pour out." Man's heart a dry soul, which the Spirit softens as Bhowers the earth. Describe scene of parched earth, perishing flowers, thirsty cattle, when long-needed rain falls. (3) The universality of the blessing on " all flesh," Gentiles included (see Acts viii. 37,38 x. 3, 45, 47 ; xv. 12 ; xvi. 30. Note ver. 28. 29. Miraculous parts of the promise fulfilled in early Gospel days (see Acts ii. 4, 3 ; v. 12 ; viii. 29, 39; xvi. 9 &c.;). Note ver. 30, 31. Figurative expressions to describe spiritual wonders (see use of figurative language in Ezek. xxxii. 7 ; Amos viii. 9; Matt, xxiv. 29; Mark xiii. 24; Luke xxi. 25). Compare predictions of destruction of Jerusalem with historical accounts. Note ver. 32. Two classes—(1) those who knowing God, call on Him (Rom. x. 12— 14), showing personal responsibility ; (2) those who, not knowing, are called of God (Acts xvi. 30), showing God's free grace. By some the former are supposed to represent the Jews, the latter the Gentiles. Bring out the extent of the promises; " My people shall never be ashamed ;" "I will pour out My Spirit," "whosoever shall call." 1\. Importance of belonging to God's people. 2\. Danger of hardening the heart against the Spirit's influences. 3\. Preciousness of the thought that each scholar is included in whosoever. E. R.
