𝑇𝑜 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑆𝑦𝑑𝑛𝑒𝑦 𝐺𝑎𝑧𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑒. Sɪʀ, I hope you’ll excuse the liberty I have taken in addressing to you a few lines, which I have had some time in contemplation. You must know, Sir, that I am a young woman, eighteen years old last birth‐day, and arrived in this Colony about a year ago; at which time your Paper (which my mother takes in regularly) used to be very amusing with accounts of balls, marriages, dinner‐parties, poetry, and other agreeable matters; of late, however, it is ﬁlled with nothing but letters about dollars, bank‐notes, circulating medium, and such nonsense, which is, I declare, enough to give one the vapours. I wish, from my heart, that the Old Settler, with Democritus, Subscriber, and the rest of them, could ﬁnd same other employment, than the stuﬃng such ridiculous nonsense down our throats. I was always reckoned a very shrewd girl for my age, Mr. Editor; and I think, notwithstanding the disguise of those cunning Correspondents of yours, I can unmask and shew their real intentions, which I hope will put a stop to their further lucubrations. There is 𝑀𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟, who opened the ball about liberty of the press, manufactured goods, bushels of wheat, and ounces of silver, in the years 1810 and 1814; what has this to do with the present year, I should be glad to know? I think he must be a 𝐽𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑖𝑡 in disguise, that has found his way amongst us for no good purpose, you may be sure.—Next comes 𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑠, with his ﬁlthy comparisons of 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠, 𝑔ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠, and 𝑠ℎ𝑢𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑠, enough to frighten the children. I assure you, Mr. Editor, that although I should be highly oﬀended at any one that called me a child, yet I could not sleep for two nights after reading one of his frightful letters. Pray what business is it of his, if Mr. Josephson melts a few dollars to make ladies’ tooth‐picks? I wish people would mind their own aﬀairs! I could aver, from the pains he has taken with his wig and whiskers, and looking‐glass, that Democritus is a complete old dandy, instead of the philosopher that his name implies.—Then there is the 𝑂𝑙𝑑 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑆𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑟. I am conﬁdent he must be a schoolmaster, from his ﬁne jaw‐breaking words, which I never could make out without the help of a dictionary. Pray what does he mean by raw materials? The next on the list is Mr. 𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑟, the most tiresome of all, with 𝐴𝑑𝑎𝑚 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑡ℎ, Mr. 𝑅𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑜, and Mr. 𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑎𝑚 (three freemasons I suppose), to assist him in persuading us that dollars are better than bank‐notes;—this must be a knowing 𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒. Do you know, Mr. Editor, that I suspect it was he who brought the dollars here; or, at least, he must have a good portion of them, or he never would write so much about them. I should like to know if he be single, as I wish to marry a rich husband; though, between ourselves, Mr. Editor, I think he would make a tiresome one, if we may judge from his stupid long letters; but I would soon cure him of that. Sister thinks him a 𝑅𝑢𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑎𝑛, from some words in 𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑠 he has written, which we cannot make out; but for my own part, Mr. Editor, I think he is a 𝐽𝑒𝑤, and that the words she alludes to are 𝐻𝑒𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑤. 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑂𝑙𝑑 𝑆𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 𝐶𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠, I think, must have escaped from the Lunatic Asylum, and took with him a quantity of 𝐴𝑚𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑟, and 𝑂𝑡𝑎ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑘, on which he is now living in the bush, preaching about 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 and 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 to the poor settlers, which is enough to drive them as mad as himself. My sister diﬀers with me in this opinion also; she thinks him a discontented old bachelor, slighted in love, as she says no woman could possibly live with such a grumbling 𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝐵𝑒𝑎𝑟.—The man, with the hard name, who talks about the Richmond races, I scarcely know what to make of; but I am sure he is not a lawyer. What is it to him if 𝑁𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑦 sells her pig? It was her own, or her husband’s, I suppose, which is the same thing. We are come to a pretty pass, indeed, if honest folks can’t sell their own without being told of it. ’Twas but last week that mother sold twenty fat sheep, and gave sister and self some money to buy ribbands; and do you know, Mr. Editor, that we were afraid to go to Mr. Blaxland’s shop to get them; and were actually obliged to walk round to Mrs. Macquarie’s seat, with our old ones, last Sunday (such ﬁne weather too!) and all for fear this odious man should say that mother sold her sheep to buy ﬁnery for her daughters. Now, as sure as I am a maid, Mr. Editor, this must be a 𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ 𝑠𝑝𝑦; and perhaps, at this moment, in correspondence with young 𝐵𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑒 to take the place from us. I would, therefore, advise the police to look well after him. I hope, after this, we shall hear no more about balance of trade, Treasury bills, currency, and such useless stuﬀ. If your correspondents wish to write, why not do it to encourage balls, plays, and other agreeable amusements, as they have in other Colonies; as I am sure we want something to keep us alive in this dull place. What a pity we have not a few more Gentlemen like Captain *****. Oh, the dear man! then, indeed, we should be quite gay. You must know how they manage these things at The Cape, Ceylon, Bourbon, &c.; which I learned from a Gentleman lately from India. The Oﬃcers and Gentlemen get up plays for the amusement of the public, the proceeds of which, after paying the expences of the house, they bestow on some charitable institution; by which means they amuse one class of people, and relieve the distresses of another. At the commencement of winter, they subscribe to give six or eight balls during the season, engaging to defray the expences between them; they then choose, by ballot from among themselves, two stewards for each ball, who have the sole management for the night, and whose duty it is to sign and issue so many tickets to each subscriber, with his name written on the back, but the names left blank, to be ﬁlled up by him; by which he becomes answerable for the respectability of the parties he may invite. The stewards also have a discretionary power of inviting respectable strangers, a list of whom is furnished from the post‐oﬃce. A person is next engaged to furnish refreshments of all kinds; sometimes they have suppers, but generally a slight repast is prepared in an adjoining room; all of which, he told us, was done at a triﬂing expence. We have been making a calculation of what a ball of this kind would cost in Sydney, and ﬁnd the whole expence would not exceed £40; and what is that, Mr. Editor, amongst 25 or 30 Gentlemen? I cannot see, therefore, why we should not have those amusements here as well as they have at other places; the only diﬀerence is, that they have got houses, or rooms, for the purpose; but surely a house could be had, for each evening, for a triﬂe. Now, Mr. Editor, if any of your Correspondents will improve these hints, by promoting such agreeable amusements, I am sure they will receive the thanks of all the young Misses in the Colony. I have shewn this letter to half‐a‐dozen charming 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑠, who are delighted with it; and who, together with sister, all join me in requesting you will publish it as soon as possible; which will not only oblige them, but most of the Ladies in the Colony, and none more so than, Mr. Editor, Yours, very sincerely, Lʏᴅɪᴀ Lᴀɴɢᴜɪꜱʜ. P. S.—Oh, dear! Mr. Editor—Such a rumpus you never saw in your life as mother has made about this letter! I went to take a walk in Hyde‐park with Miss B. and left the letter on a table in my room, where mother found it. On our return I never saw her in such a passion; she called me a busy, meddling hussey (you must know she is a great 𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡, 𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑟 having turned her entirely against bank‐notes, by calling them 𝑏𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑒 𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟), and told me I would certainly be prosecuted for a libel by 𝐷𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑠, 𝑀𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟, and the rest of them; but, particularly by the man with the hard name, for calling him a 𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ 𝑠𝑝𝑦. Fortunately however, for me, Mr. Capias, the lawyer (who is courting sister), happened to come in; who, after reading the letter, appeased her, by assuring her there was nothing in it that would be noticed by those Gentlemen; and he kindly undertook to forward it to you himself; for which civility I shall say a good word in his favor to sister; who (I believe) is rather indifferent about him. Adieu! L. L.
