TO Till! EDITOB OP THE EEGI3T2H. Sirâ€” Y our correspondent 'Candidus, in this morning's paper' quotes an apothegm of D. O'Connell, that 'give it 24 hours' start, and he would back falsehood to wiu against truth ; and agrees that the opponents of the Bill for incorporating the Church of England arc acting on this maxim in the objections raised by them to that measure. Your correspondent is, on tbe other hand, one of its warmest supporters, and, taking counsel from the Irishman's wit, starts a state ment diametrically opposed to fact (I .don't like to use the word falsehood), intended to work favourably to this measure. He states that ' an incorporated Select Yestry was esta blished last year at Port Adelaide; that tbe Bishop derived no power from it ; and that he will derive no power from the Bill in question.' Now, as there is not a word of trutii in the statement abjut the incorporated Vestry, 1 leave him in the dilemma of acting on O'Con uell's maxim for the benefit of the cause he espouses, and wuh him joy of the 21 hours he has stolen on, Yours, &c.;, O'CONNELL'S GHOST.
