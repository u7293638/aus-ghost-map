Broken Strings from Freedom's Lyre. "The Birth of M'drni" ' By Edwin J. Brady, The Christ of tho Cross, lias Ho suffored in vain ? Was Calvary bought at tho prico of His pain, That Judas might soil it again, as ho sold Tho Alorciful Man for tho sako of tho gold Wo worship to-day in tho Church and the strcot ; Ami hnto niiA nnnf.lioiv linnmien if. io mnnf. That tlio sweltering masses in penury toil For tho children of Judas to gloat on tlioir spoil, Fore vor and over in silence and tears. Like dumb driven cattlo, Liko lash driven cattle, Tho workors toil on tliro' tho night of the years. Tho myriads murmur tho ghost of a name, And tho Phantom of Frcodom, from chaos and ilamo Liko tho wraith of a birthright forgotten by all In mockery rises and points to lior pall. Enthroned at tho portals of agos sublime This spectre discloses tho vision of Timo — With tlio blood of tlie battle liis bosom is red, And a rivor of tears that tho nations liavo slieil Flows by with the roll and tho roar of a song, In a turbulent torrent, In a wild wailing current, That glitters with light as it ruslios along. Boliold! how tho night-wind is pregnant of warning, And low to tlio eastward tlio poimnnfc of morning, Tlio flag of tho future, tho crimson and gold, With tlio shout of tho millions bogins to unfold ; And a wonderful voice from tho nethermost spaces Cries out in tho depths of tho dark, dosort places — Arise 1 from your slumber, -Oh, mon of tho earth, Awake 1 and boliold yo tho marvellous birth Of tho goldon-haired morning. Of tho day that is dawning — Tho hills and tho highways aro full of her miilh. # Courago !_ my comrades, thoir legions are shaken, Tho daylight is coming, tho oaglos awaken, ' Let us on in tlio tremulous breath of tho dawn, On thro' the silence of highways forsakon, Wo will march to the silvery gates of tho morn.
