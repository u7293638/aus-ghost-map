Mr. JacIlCn was in the chair, and the meeting was thoroughly unani mous. While in America, Mr. W. S. Gilbert was one evening at a fashionable func tion given by a lady of the "new rich" order, who posed as a patron of music, but who had not had time to educate herself. She was foolish enough to attempt to "show off" before the Eng lish celebrity. "And what is Bach ('Batch' she called it) doing now?" shl said. "Is he composing anything?" "No, madam," immediately replied Mr. Gilbert, --ithout the ghost of a smile. "No, m-.lam, Batch is just now decom posing!"
