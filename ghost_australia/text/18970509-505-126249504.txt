[?] Mrs. Lance Rawson's ' Australian Cook and Laundry Book,' has b^en received from the publishers, J. 'VV. Knapton and Co., Mel bourne. The nsw publication is a portion of her larger work, ' The Australian Enquiry Book,' and it is published separately to meet the requirements of Australian women who want a useful book at a moderate cost. From the Salvation Army we have received a copy of 'The Brewer's Ghost,' by Com mandant H. H. Booth. The story is of the usual 'Army' description, and its object is to show the baneful influence of ' the cursed drink. '* The illustrations are numerous and well executed, aud the publication is unusually well printed. The April number of the ' Australasian Anthropological Journal ' has been received. It contains the usual amount of reading matter, which should be of great interest to those for whom it is especially published. The Brisbane Figaro, edited by ' Bobby ' Byrnes, has entered upon its third volume. The paper was established 20 years ago. Though its past has been successful, its future promises to be even more so. ' Harold Efferrnere, a Story of the Queens land Bush,' by Michael Costello (George Robertson and Co.), is a very novel produc tion. Tnken seriously, as it is meant to be, it is a most crude attempt at literature. Otherwise it is almost as ludicrous as oue of Mark Twain's skits on the stereotyped romauces. 'The contents' are denoted in a freakish style, which but too truly indicates what is within. Instead of the customary headings, quotations, dragged iu without rhyme or reason, from the Bible, Shakespeare, Kendall, Cato, some in the doad languages, are there to parade the author's knowledge. Ho is only rivalled by the characters of the story. A girl of 16, daughter of a carrier, also exhibits her learning by quoting Dante, Tennyson, Gordon, and the Greeks over the grave of hor father ; and a crazy drover speaking the poets to a sickening ex tent whenever he opens his mouth. ' Harold Efferrnere' is simply unique.
