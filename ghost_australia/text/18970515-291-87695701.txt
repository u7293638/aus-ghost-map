jfiomtg f top le. FRAIDIE.QAT. [By Clinton Scollahd.] I shan't'tell you what's bis name ! When we want to play a game, Always thinks that he'll be hurt, Soil his jacket in the dirt, Tear his trousers, spoil his hat — Fraidie-cat ! Fraidie-cat ! Nothingiof the boy in him ! ' Dasn't try to learn to swim ; Says a coVil hook ; if she Looks at him he climbs a tree ; Scart to death at bee or bat — Fraidie-cat ! Fraidie-cat ! . Claims there're ghosts all snowy white . Wandering around at night In tli* attic ; wouldn't go There for anything I know. B'lieve he'd run if you said 'scat !;'— Fraidie-cat ! Fraidie-cat !
