I FLOGGING IN SCHOOLS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-Your sub-leader on corporal punishment in your issue of Tuesday last deserves the thanks of every person interested in the conduct of our youth there is not the slightest doubt of its need the cane unduly spared on the young will yet result in the infliction of the lash on children of a larger growth I have carefully observed the effect of Major Smith s circula" since its issue and have too suited a very large number of teachers on the subject and one and all unhesitatingly condemn it Some few head masters will be found who can be got to praise it simply be cause it makes them all but autocratic in their own schools I know several well authenticated instances where the head master of a state school absolutely refuses to punish any child under the charge of some of his assistants no matter what the fault may be, because he hopes by that means to damage the assistant a character as a teacher when the inspector lays his half yearly visit lins 13 absolute fact the effect of the circular generally is to make the under teachers careless and reads to wink at faults Schools can be found and are known where HW caring and disgusting language in the play round are taken no notice of, where land, is often overlooked, and where the o\ ila of lighting are left to right themselves For all faults such as the want of preparation of lessons Le, which tend to bring" down the percentage the head masters are quick enough to take account, but not so vi stir those which are only immoral in their effects Every quail Red teacher, I think is against the use of the cane in the hands of members and pupil teachers but to say that assistants who have been teaching eight, ton, or perhaps twelve years, or even more, are not capable of using the cane is arrant nonsense I am sure the teachers as a whole would have taken some action re the removal of the circular before this, had they not remembered what Mr Ramsay said in the House last Parliament They thought that so soon as he had had time to look into the matter he would not hesitate to take off what he so decidedly condemned I doubt not but that he will What he does unasked will come more gracefully from him Trusting that you will still wage war on this as on other nights of the Berry Ministry Siamese, Abblb-AN-.
