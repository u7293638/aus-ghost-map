THE LIVERPOOL HATCH LivkupooIi, 11th August. We arrived here from Burnley ^it about half past eleven on tho night of the 7th inst., and noxt day at noon bogan our match against eighteen of Liverpool and district. We played on tho Stanley Cricket Club ground, which is situated in a place called Mero Laur, about four miles distant from tho Union iiotoJ, wnoro wo wero stopping. The pitch was very good, but the out fielding ground was vory bad, and as at Buxton several spills occurred in travelling after tho ball. Gregory won the toss from Evans, the local skippor, and decided to bat. As usual, tho two Bannermans appeared at tho wickets first, and the bowling was en trusted to Trantor and Cottam, both professionals. The Sydney crack mado a splendid square leg hit off Cottam'a second ball over ' the ropes for four, and then played him to short leg for a single. Each bowler having sent down a maiden, the elder brother cut Tranter for a braco, but camo to grief tbo noxt ball, which pros trated his leg stump. 1—7—7. Horan filled the vacancy, and started his account at onco by sending Tranter to forward cover for a pair of doubles. Alick cut Cottam for a triplet, and the Victorian followed suit. Three moro to young Bannorman off Cottam, for a good log hit, sont 20 up, and another ton was soon added ia singles and doubles. When the scoro stood at 37 Horan lot out at a looso ball from Trantor, and was caught at cover-point byRickman. 2—12—32. Gregory joined Alick, and snicked tho first ball he received for a single, which, with a capital leg hit to the ctonewallor for a triplet caused 40 to bo hoiated.. Jones re lieved Cottam, and Gregory cut him for thrco to th'e ropes, and this contribution, with several singles, sent tho half century in sight. A series of maidens ensued, each bowler being well on tho spot, tho fiolding being very good. Grogory at longth made a splendid hit to square-log for a triplot off Jones, and Bannerman . repeated tbo doso. Seventy appeared on the tele graph, and when four runs were addod luncheon wasadjourned for, Bannorman being not out 32, and Grogory not out 18. Oh resuming at three o'clock a single was added, and then young Ban nerman was oaught at mid-on by F. Jones off Duckworth. 8—32—75. The departing bats man played a capital innings without giving tho ghost of a chance. Boylo noxt ? appeared on tiioscono, and the stand of our innings was mado. Tho now comor drovo Duckworth for a triplet, and Gregory hit him to Ic2 for a hko number. ,80 up. A Jullnotv took placo in the, scoring,, tho next runs being made in about a' dozen overs. Gradually, however, the Johmontor began to but aad drive in brilliant stylo/ and1 bis efforts wore ablyaided by tho Now South Welshman. - 90 was hoisted, and tho : ceutuiy quickly followed. Gregory, about this : time, gave Tranter a very iiob . cbanco off bis own bowling, and a singly resulted ! through Boyle's' smartness in backing up. Gregory made a square-leg hit off Eickman over tho ropes for 4, which, with a succession of triplets to each batsman, caused 120 to bo posted. Change after change was tried 'in the bowling,- but run3 camo speedily, and'lEO was telegraphed amidst, upplanso. When the, score had roncbed 172 Gregory, in attempting a leg hit, was caught at miil-on by F. Joues, off C. Jonos. Our captain played a really firat-clasa innings for 70-aud'hb.'was very warmly gro'eted on returning to tho pavilion. 4. fo'r;172. Garrott was bowled by Tranter without scoring— 5 for 172— and the i Tasmanian, Bailey, jomod Boylo. By good play tho scoro was raised to 187, and then Boyle was . splendidly caught at ,: mid-on by Kickman,* off JP. Jonea. .Boylo played in capital form for his score of 58j which is tho largost ho has mado during tbo tour. G-r-58 — 187. Hyslop, who played instead of Murdoch, became tbo Tasmaniati's partner, but after uiakine 3 tho former was bowled by C Jones. 7 for 192. opoiioriu ruauo iu in tureo nus, ono over tuo ropes for & and two triplets, and then ho was given but leg before wicket. 8 for 201. Allan added ? a single, and was caught at long on off C. Jones. 9 for 211. .Blackham, whoso finger, is still bad, wis last man, and with Bailey raised tho scoro to 233, when tho.Iattor was caught at mid-on by Rickman off C. Jones after playing a freo and lively innings for 28, Blackham being not out with 5 to bis credit, Throowling o£ tho Eighteen was very good, but pur mon played in something like their Australian form, and the averagos therefore Buffered, By some mistako 'on tho part of tho scorers, tiro analysis of our opponents' bowling was not kept. Tranter is a fast left-handed bowler, witb a slight work from leg, and Jones bowls very like Evans of Now . South Wales, Cottam is straight, but easy to play. The eightoon commenced their, first innings at twenty minutes to six, and when the stumps woro drawn at six o'clock they bad lost three wickets for 3 runs. On resuming next day at noon Spofforth and Garrott had it ail thoir own way, and by three o'clock tbo last wicket had fallen for tbo poor total of 71. Being .more than 80 runs behind they had to follow ou, and by nalf-pasta five woro all out for 91, tha match thus terminating in our favor by au in nings and 71 runs. Tho oigbtoen included some really fiuobatsmon,butthewicketsuitedSpofforth, Garrett and Boyle, and the result was a collapse in each innings. M'Cormack played, well for 17, as did Eopor, for 11. The latter play's with York shire County, and recently scored over 60 against MiddloHOX. In the second innings James mado 14 in good stylo, and Duckworth slogged bard for 18. A glance at tho bowling analysis will show that our bowlers performed with great success. TMia af.fcnnrinnAn finrinor fho fwn iiava nnmhftrerl about 6000, and the weather was all that could be desirod. . We were the better pleased in having scored such an easy victory inasmuch as tho 'Liverpool papers, after our fiasco at Nottingham, ran us down, and said that we could not play a littlo bit. We play well enough, however, to de ' feat in ono innings a very strong eightoou, chosen from a town and district with a population equal to all Australia. During our stay in Liver pool we were on the list at the Prince of Wales Theatre and at Hayne's Minstrels, who are reckoned equal 10 any m tuo worm. At tne latter placa several puns were made about our team, and this went down with tho audience. I could not catch the words exactly, but an allusion was mado to Gregory powders ; and speaking of somo person who lived in a Garrett, it was said they ought to Blackham up a bit and send him to the Old Bailoy, while tbo band played Allan Allanab. Hayno's company of minstrels is under tho management of a Mr. Stringer, who visited Aus tralia snmo years ago with tho lato celebrated actor Walter Montgomery. Ho was vory pleased to see us, and said there was no placo liko Aus tralia, and that bo longed to visit it again. The minstrels havo been in ono place, St. James's, Liverpool, for the past seven years, and perhaps at somo future time may travel to the antipodes to show their skill,. We bad not tho slightest chance of looking round the town, but we could sea that thero wero many handsome buildings, and many, exactly, tbo reverse. Some of the streets are broad and well kept, whilst others are narrow and dirty, and tho' traffic is very largo. Tho streets wore. densely crowdod on the Saturday night, and tho two extremes of lifo, poverty and riches, wero as well represented as in London it self. When we woreleavingour hotel the. proprietor gave each of us a neat match-box, handsomely mounted, and in a few woll-choson words wished us every success in our future engagements, and a safe return home. We met Borne very jolly ?fellows at Liverpool, and will carry with us a pleasant recollection of our visit to that great seaport town. JL ' ought to have, men tioned, apropos of theatrical business, that Miss Ada Ward, tho woH-known actress, sont a telegram congratulating us upon our suc cess in iSogland, and stating tbat she was about to depart at once for ' dear old Australia.' As the match was finished in two days a single innings match was played to fill up the third day. It rained all the morning, and a start could not bo mado until after two o'clock. The eighteen went first to tho wickots and remained there until a quarter to six, their total innings being 193\. Marriott was top score with 39 well earned. Itickman and C. Jones showed good form for 24 each, and E. Jackson hit hard for 19. Allan, Boyle, Garrett, C. Bannerman and Horan bowled, and Spofforth wonfc on for a few overs towards the close of tho innings, in order to please some persons who had come a long distance to see the demon trundle. One old man said that ho had 'paid his shilling sololy to eoe Spofforth perform. At six o'clock Spofforth and Bailey went in, and the latter, after making 8, was caught at short slip. Spofforth was caught in the long-field for a well bit 14, and HyBlop, with Allan, played until half-past six, when the stumps wero drawn. The former was not out 1, and the latter not out 3. Tho night after the first day's play, the pavilion was broken into, and five of our blue and whito silk sashes, which had not been locked up, were stolen. The thief was captured next day with the stolen property ia bis possession, and_ being proseouted was sentenced trt biv mAtil Via* ltytrwiaATiinAVif. VU *J*i».
