An Ode To The Modern Walts. Tis a kind of mild gyration, 'Tis the " Military Waltz ;" A sort of marchc fttnnbre, mixed With some very sudden halts, As your partner, vainly striving To revolve, is forced to stop; And your manly arm is aching, And you're nearly fit to drop; While the moments are so melting, And you can't account at all, For the ponderous persistence Of the " Fairy " of the ball Her weight is but a trifle, If she steps upon the scale; She looks so like a Zephyr That you crowd on every sail * With a feeling of elation, With a consciousness of power, You go, for twenty yards at least, At forty knots an hour; But a deadly drag is on you, And, alas! your dream is false, For you find you have to wrestle With the "Military Walts !" This Waltz, which isn't Waltzing, But a dreary dull parade Of automaton-like figures, ' Looking somewhat " ready-made " As they zig-zag, slide and shuffle, Turn round twice, and then appear As if they " really had to stop," They felt " so very queer." Where is the old-time waltzing ? And the woltzers, where are they ? Here's a lady fair I waltzed with. Twenty years ago to-day ; " We'll try a turn for ' auld-lang-svne*' She smiled, and took my Jim: She weighed about two hundred pounds, But her waltzing was a charm ; Her form was somewhat solid. Yet her st^o was light as air; As we float^STround the room;, I, Thus, -apostrophised the fair: " This is the good old waltzing, Thus in the days of yore, Our steps beat time to th' music, On many a festive floor; I could whirl for hours together, For your waltzing is just divine ; And you weigh like the ghost of a feather, Which I reckon a gracious sign That your style is correct and none other:" Then she sighed, as she told of a youth, Who said that" she waltzed Eke his mother" And he possibly spoke the truth.
