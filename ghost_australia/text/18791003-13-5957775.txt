INTRODUCTION. The chief event of the month in Aus- tralia has been tho opening it Sydney of the first International Exhibition held in these colonies. The Exhibition was opened somewhat prematurely, as all the courts were not ready, but there is no doubt that, both as regards exhibits and attendance the enterprise will be a fine success, and Victoria will profit next year by the ex perience which has been gained in New South Wales on the present occasion. Within our own limits, the history of the month is mainly political. Both houses have been occupied with schemes for the reform of the constitution, and, so far, without any substantial progress having been made. In tho Legislativo Council, Su Chirlos Sladen has introduced a bill which do ils with tlio constitution of tlio Uppoi House, and does not cmbraco tho problems of liow to rondor deadlocks m finance mi possible, and how to socuro finabty m ordinary legislation Aftci tho oxpo nenco of last session, tho lion gentle man considers that it is botter that legislation with regard to those issues should bo initiated 111 tho Lowei Houso Generally, tho linos of the bill adopted by tho Council last session winch tho Government refused to con- sider-aro follow ed Instead of six pro vinces, as now, it is proposed that theio Bhall bo 12 , instead of 30 mombors, 42 , md instead of tho 10 yoars' tonuro of olhce, G years And tho frincluso, it is now proposed, Bhall bo îedueed to a £ 15 v Pittat-on for fieoholdora m simes and £30 for leaseholders, with a coiro sponding arrangement for tho cities Tho Council is now elected by 30,000 voters and tho Arsombly by 180,000, but undor tlio Sladen bul thofianchisoforthoCoun eil would bo exorcised by a numboi of mon vanously estimated horn 00,000 to 100,000, and tho higher of the two num hers is probably tho nearer tho mark Sir Challes Sladen pointed out that with regard to deadlocks they had all boen occasioned by tho aggressive action of tho Lower Houso m resorting to " tacks," but ho admitted that the basis of tho Council had not been widened equally with that of tho Assembly, and that it was now time to correct this error The bl1! is undoi debate Tho measuio known aa tho Reid Mutuo Bcliemo lias also been submitted to tho Council by its promotoi in that Houso, but it is imperfectly drafted, and is not likely to receive unmodiato attention in its present form In tho Assembly, the Mmistenal Ile form Bill Ins been thoroughly discussod It has been read a second timo, and is now about to undergo tho ordeal of con Bideration in committee Tho measuio has not been supported with enthusiasm, and many of tho Government members havo condemned its leading principles, namely-(1) tho plébiscite, (2) the nomineo system, and (3) tho absoluto supremacy gwen to tho Lowei Houso without check oi control in finance These gentlemen intimated then intention of voting for tho second reading is a declaration in favoui of rofoim, but they expressly reBorved tho right of v otmg against tho tho third reading if tho radical alteiations they desire are not made in committee Consequently the division was not taken on tho merits of tho bill, and tho numbers-53 to 31, in- cluding purs-do not discloso the real feeling of the Houso Wo shall not know what that is until tho amended measuio comes to bo pionouncod upon Mr Berry spoko shortly beforo tho division, and ho intimated that ho had no reason whatovei to suppoao that the plebiscite would bo unacceptable ni Eng- land-a statement which is discredited and he mentioned that tho 0th clause of the bul would bo recast so that monoy should only bo payable on the vote of tho Assembly alono in tho caso of the rejec- tion of tho voto by tlio Council His original proposal was to pay money always on the voto of tho Lower Houso, and thuB to render Appiopnation Bills unnecessary Ho now lovells to his scheme of last year, that when tho Coun eil objects to a monoy bill the measuio shall bo put into operation, and the Council shall bo ignored It will be readily understood that such a soheme, even if it should reach the Council, can liavo not the smallest piospcct of bema' passed there On tho othci hand, Mi Service, as leader of the Opposition, his intimated til it his pioposils, based upon the im piovement and not upon the do¿i .dation of tho second Chambei, would bo ao copted 111 a spmt of compiomise and con ciliation by tho Council, md could bo c in led into law thiB session The diffei ences bet» een tho roi olutionaiy and tho constitutional pioposals no very marked, and for convenience of lefeienco wo place them 111 juxtaposition - THF MIMST BRU- BUL THE 0--0SITI0*) IR0.03AL 1 1 The Ui per Houso to ho Tho Upper Houso to be tomposed of non luces sit elected on a low rat" paj tinj, 'or a limited term of ing franchise tho pro j care and responsible to vii ces to bo sul divided tie Ministrj, who would the tenure of ollico re periodically appoint them dueel and tho Houso to bcothciwiso popularised Moncj hills to lo taken The assembly to have out ol tho purv icw of ti o tho ric.1 t ol Initiatin. all Couml Votes to 1 e paid moi ej hills Buel billa not on the authority of ti o to le an ended bj tie Ae«cmbly if tho Council Comic I but i ot to in x.jccta Buch measures elude tacks Ii tho eve it of reject 01 (on ti otround of tacks or jobbery) tho Co incil to bo sul jeet to a dib. lution Jointl} with tho Assembly 3 - Bills of funeral Icr sla TI o liabllit} to a jo nt lion rejected I } the Colin 1 ss 1 ition to a] j 1} \ ith eil to bo sul ii ittc 1 to a re.ard to all I illa In ti e __. of te al d if ii 1 rov ed ei el t of ti c tw o Houses of to lecorno law dis reel s; after sue!

Trade has severely suffered in consequonco of this delay. This week, how over, the duties were taken in hand, and for tho most part they havo boon accoptod. As the measure now stands, it will im- pose now duties to the amount of £200,000, in-tead of £250,000 as was at Iii st proposed, and tho balanco ia to be made up by stamp duties. An effort has been made to rovivo tho . question of payment of members. A . caucus of Ministerial mombors was held ., lo consider the propriety of passing a bill : to continuo payment to tho new Parlia- ment. Great dissatisfaction was ex- pressed with the idea of allowing payment to lapso Avith this Ptihiracnt, but Mr Berry li id to point out tliat ho avis bound by specific promises mido m both Houses not to extend the sj stem until the country hid voted upon it it tho next general election On the faith of tina pledge tho Council agreed to the bill of 1878 na a com pir linse 'J ho Chief Secretary promised his supporters, hoAACAcr, that ho aa ould call the noAV Parliament togothor so soon as it aa is elected-holding an extra session foi tho purpose, if nccessaiy-and this iiTin^emeiit mollified tho lion gentle- men The Rojal Linds Commission has bl ought up its final report Tho docu nient deals Avith tho question of pastoul occupation, and recommends thit, on the expiration of tho present leases, the i uns should bo cut up into blocks of from 1,000 acres to 10,000 acres, to bo ottered at a Ioaa rental, and to bo open for freo selection It is scarcely likely that this reckless modo of dealing aa ith the public estato AAill bo adopted Tho subject of lohgious education in the state schools is still undei discussion Bishop Moorhouse is tho loading sup porter of tho nio\ement so far as the Protestant denominations aio concerned His address at tho opening of tho Church of England Assembly, which mot for a short sosBion, was largely dovotod to tho subject Ho is of opinion that tho oxclu sion of íeligious instruction from tho stato schools is a calamity, that a plan of in- struction similar to that which obtains m tho board schools of London might bo adopted, and that somo concession ought to be mado to tho religious scruples of the Roman Catholics Referring to tho oppo sition that has been raised against tho adoption of this course, ho condemns it as unreasonable, as savouring of hatred and of fierceness , and ho doclaies that while ho has as strong an aversion as any man m the community to the errors of Rome, he will not join "in the hoivl against tho Roman Church " Tho earnestness and eloquence of the bishop alivays obtain îecognition fiom lus auditors, but tho most prominent result of lus advocacy is tho formation of enthusiastic leagues to difcnd the Education Act as it stands The Farmers' Union movement is noAv thorouglily established Branches havo been formed m almost every district in tho colony, and a confoienco is about to bo held in Melbourne to formulate a pro gramme The speeches have been directed againBt tho duties which oppress tho agricultural interest, and it is evident that tho farmers aro rapidly becoming alive to tho gross injustice of the proteo tive syBtem Steps hav o been taken to prosecute the manager and directors of the Provincial and Suburban Bank, foi conspiring to defraud the public by publishing false statements and dolusrv e balance sheets Tho defendants aro noAV out on bail The man John Lawrence, who murdered Mr. T.

bill he considered would be that it Avould lead to some reasonable proposal for a compromise from the Becond Chamber Some amusement had been caused on a prev ioub eA ening by the quotation of a

sat down amid a solemn silence on his oivn Bide, though some cheers cime from the cornets Mr Gilbea m ide an effective de bating speech The criticism and the atti tude of the Opposition last session

and the lion member ivas rewarded b} his part} with warm ap plause On the next day of the debate Mr Grant contended for the British Hy stem pure and simple, and said that all our difficulties had arisen from the founders of the constitution haA ing kept aneje upon America, and having endeaAOured to establish here an American Senate instead of a British House of Lords The plébiscite, Mr Grant admits, is not British, and he is not wedded to it if some other effectual means can be discovered of making the Avili of the majorit} of the Assembly law The Assembl}, Mr Grant urges, is possessed of all the privileges of the House of Commons, and if it giiea up one of them it will bo as bad as that Irish Houso which Bold itself at the Union Mr Williams is dispcBed to vote for the second reading of the bill in order to show his deBire for re- form, but on the distinct understanding that ho disapprovea of some of its leading prin ciplea, and he will vote against the third reading if important amendments aro nut made One of the quotations made by Mr Zox was from a contribution mado by Pro fessor Pearson to the roilnightly Review of Jul) last The description given by the hon gentleman is far from flattering to the Assembly He declarea that " the only interest in politics is to Avatch the fluctua ting fortunes and combinations of BuccessiAe gangs of adventurers The smalluess of

Woods, Baid that judging the one part of the bill from a legal standpoint, tho clause giAing the Council power to reject money bills would override all the platitudes of tho declaratory sections and that as regards these, the most im Eoitont of all measures, the Government ill contains no prevention against deadlocks of an} kind The cardinal objection to the bill is that it is framed not in a calm dis passionate manner, but in a smnt of resent ment against the Council, and with a Aievv to the degradation of that body Dr Madden objects strongly to a Council nominated in the same way as the

extent, and the causes by which it haa been occasioned and to suggest means of relief," submitted their report to the Chief Secretary early _ the month In their report it ia stated that m order to teat the statements as to the scarcity of work, the board opened a registry, in which all unemployed were at liberty to register their names This waa kept open from tho 11th of June to the 10th of Julj, during which period 392 persona were en- rolled, principally artisans and labourera The board considered it doubtful whether tho greateat suffering was not experienced by miemploy ed persons of the class of shopmen, clerks, and others accustomed to light occupa- tions who Bhrank from parading their distress The inquiries mado by the board, and tue evidence given before it, showed conclusive!) that during the winter season of each year tbero was a considerable slackness m trade and busmeaa generally, but that on the occa sion immediately under notice the depreaaioa , waa abnormal, and the distrcaa consequently much greater than had been experienced for man) )ears past Large numbers of clerks, shopmen, and artisans, and also many labourers, were without emploi ment Many of these had been for ) ears resident m the colon), and bad been emplo)ed cluetl) m the Aanous trades, manufacturing mduatnea, and other works in and around Melbourne The board was convinced that lack of employ- ment bad not been senousl) experienced in the majorit) of the proAinces, but numbera of the w orkmg men from thence must haï e gravitated to Melbourne, in the endeaAour to lind work The cauaes Avhich aasiated in bringing about the depression were various Five mam causea are educed-1 The failure to a large extent of the crops, not only of last season, but more or Icsb of those of preceding )ears 2 The drought of lost season, which acted detrimental!) to the graciera 3 The stead) decrease in the )ield of gold 4 A Avave of bttsineas depression Avhich appeared to be passing oAer the whole of the civilised world, the other Australian colonies suffering from its effects in common with ouraehea 5 The high price of mone), Avhich tended to fetter trade operations to a considerable extent, its scarcity being such as to force the banka to exercise the strictest supervision oi er their adA anees, and onb to afford ac- commodation at rates ivhich were almost prohibitive Amongst other causea tho foi lowing were instanced by different persons giAing eAidence befoie the board- free trade and protection, the stock tax, decline in lalue of wool, and diminution of investments by capitalists The board condemned the labour offices, "aa the proprietors thereof appeal to be more intent on consulting their own pecuniar) interests than the permanent establishment tri work of the

or fan itical Christians Ver} much depended on the clerL.}, but the} could do nothing to anj good purpose unless the laity combined to help them with means and work and avmpathy I verjwhere the complaint was made that, with a few noble exceptions the iaitj of the Church of Tttgland exhibited but little interest in its laboura There was no enthusiasm little self sacrifice The reason of that was the want of any deep convie tion of the use and necessity of the Gospel It might be too much to say there waa po3i tive unbelief amongst the laity rather was it the absence of any belief strong and quick enou_.h to serve as a stimulus to self sacn fice A godless materialism was spreading ita deadening mlluence over large classes who knew nothing of it as a theorj It would not be bo long for

not only monej, but also some kind of labour towards the great end It was not mere organisation that waa wanted, but the touch of a kindling purpose, the Bpur of a quickening faith The clergy should summon their churchworkers and as many others of their commumcanta as could be got together for tue purpose of stirring up this feeling of missionary re Bponoibihtj lhere were many days when neither

of leligioua educa tion m state schools he referred to the deputation from a meeting of tho Pro testant ministers of Melbourne, which had about a fortnight previously waited on the Minister of J ducation and sub nutted proposals to the effect that a selec tion of lessons from the Bible ahould be used by schoolmasters as a text book m the state schools, the children of objecting parents to receive secular instruction while the Bible lesson waa being given He defended at length these proposals and stated that Bhould the} be adopted, the Roman Catholic claim for a separate grant on account of secular instruction would have to be dealt with As to this claim he advocated the making in some form of a grant to the Roman Catholics for secular results The meeting lasted four days, during which there waB a lengthy debate on the Bubject of religious education in state schools Mr T T A Beckett moved the following senea of resolutions, which were adopted at a recent meeting of

prospects of gold mining m a good number of the districts of the colony have been more favourably reported on during the past week or two than they were for some months preAioualy Trom nearly all parts of the Ballarat division of the colony a moat gratif)ing extension of mining is said to be taking place, and by that is meant, not only more speculation and more claims taken up, in the hope that they will eventually be pay- able, but the substantial extension of mining in the shnpo of more goldcettin0 The old diggings ground at Brovinia (Scarsdale) l8 one of the lateat of the aucceaaea A party of 12 men took up a claim there, under tbe belief that there was a good run of gutter in it, they found gold, and obtained credit for machiner), and the yield waa so large that they were able to pay off their debts for machinery, o-c , and to divide £25 10a each man One or two other partiea in that direction aro alBO doing very fairl), and all out Scarsdalo and Sm)thesda!e Avay, Avhere the late raina have added to the Bupply of water, mining ia much brisker The opening up of the New Australasian mine at Creswick gives promise of a great future for the share- holders, and will help to prOA e the theory bo often put forward by some as to the main outlet of that rich lead, which is a matter of much importance to the Creswick people and to those aaIio may have land along the course of that lead when ita trend l8 proved The Kingston alluiial mines continua to yield fairly, while those that are not m gold are pushing forward their sinking operations with all despatch , but they have deep ground and heavy water looming ahead, and great care must be exercised in Buch country At Beaufort the boring operations havo re- vealed pretty clearly the courses of the leadB through the

3dwt to the nailcan of dirt, after having driven a Bhort distance The exact locality was just below the i\ lntcllabbitReef, between the 1 ryingpan Plains and the Cosmopolitan, and not v ery far from the latter It was Bald to be likely thef a number of shafts wouid at once be put down to test the loeaht), but the number of miners, in the immediate vicmit) rendered it certain that unavailable

day, and wo already have had suffi cient experience of what an unscrupulous Ministry are capable of, even when onl) poa sesBed of the mere semblance of any such power The discussion on this bill having continued until the end of last week that on the tariff waa reaumed again on Tuesday (this week), and it ia Bincerely to be hoped that the present week s discussion will bring toa close all mattera m connexion with the Budget proposals of the Government During the discussion which took place a fortnight ago considerable progress was made, and the wonder ia that with rcBpect to a matter of bo much sigmfiance, and on which immediate legislation was so neces Bar), anything whatever should be allowed to interfere, but the wonder is all the greater that it should be tiela) ca tor tne saice of a bill which the Ministry them selves know-unless they are destitute of common sense-there is no possibility of ita becoming law After the bill waa laat dealt with, and during the interval whicb occurred till tho resumption of the diacu3 sion this week, meetings vvero held of a arious trades interested and aliected by the proposed alterations , deputations alao waited upon the Commissioner of Customs, in the hope of obtaining a modification in tho view a of the Ministry Amongst the most important meetings held on the subject was one of the softgoods trade, on the 9th September, in MessrB Martin, Butler, and Nichols ivare house, riinderB street The tariff waa shown to bo moat complicated and iniquitous, and it waa condemned by all the speakers as being ruinoiiB, especially to the intercolonial trado Its abaurdity waB illustrated b) the fact that the duties would fall heaviest upon articles of low value, and it Avas pointed out that the greater portion of tho burden Avould be horne by the operatne classes A statement show mg how hats and umbrellas of different ai/ea and qualities would be anomalously taxed waa submitted, and it was resolved that it Bhould be printed and distributed amongat the members of the Legislativ e Assembly, with a request that the House should not agree to the imposition of 15 per cent on drees materials containing wool, as such a tax AAould fall heavily on the Avorking clasaea, and could in no sense be regarded aa protective Miniatenal journals alwaya aasert that the present protective policy of the Government haB been favourable rather than detrimental to the colony and its trade, but every hour and every passing day instances proving the reverse are brought before ub No discussion is ever raised upon the facts involved, the correctness or otherwise of these being easily proved , differences of opinion only arise with respect to causes, but notas to resulta Recently in explanation of the great falling off in
