Bruce had wandered to Mackay's farmhouse, where he was entertaining some friends and at first declined the hospitality; but Mackay compelled him to accept it, saying: "I am king in my own house.'' The next morn ing, after breakfast, Mackay took Bruce to the top of the mountain of Beinn-an-tuirc, to show him the western coast, whither Bruce , wished to go. Bruce then disclosed himself, and said he would give Mackay what he wished, when he had re gained his throne. Mackay asked for the two farms of Ugadale and Arniele; and they separated at the spot now marked by a stone called Crois Mhic Caidh, or the Cross of Mackay. After the battle of Bannockburn, Mackay went to Edin burgh, where the king gave him the title deeds of the two farms and when Mackay declined the goblet of wine that he offered him, Bruce in his turn said; You must drink it; for I am now king in my own house. j ji.On a bank- onth'e 'other side of the ' river - is 'the Holy VYffil, almbat'obnbealed -by long grass ;ahd rcDfohali of'fern; ' -The- water' flows - into a 'small stonef- basinj-'bn " the ront-'bf-':trUi6h''''knfl a sculptured cross, the oMy;l>ne;;:Belqn(||iii; beauty, 'and,pbssei3qSthe'bustqm !, Holy YVell .legend — that'thbsQ/vh'o. drink of its waters should,,wish a; jyish',', and, will bejmarried s tb.

She consented, and went out alono on her perilous journoy ; and in tho morning, rotlirned half dead with fatigue and oxcitoment, but with the Skull in hor liands! Tlio old farmer would not boliovo tho tale that Clio told concerning tlio skull, or that she had brought it from the Mohaitory. She said that when sho .liad at last got ; to the old cliurch, she found its door open ; that she groped her way in— well knowing the spotand the position of-. -Hie. tomb— -and that" :alI6'lieard hVyatGridua moans, and tho movemont of many light foot and forms all around her.

How she got back throilgh the siioW to Gloii Barr, bIio Scarooly know ; but she accomplished tlio. task ; and there she was with the skull iri her hand to claim her reward. Still tho o|d farmer wodld not believe her ; and sot 6ut to Saddell (vith some of hie hneh,' expect ing to find the bIeuII in its usual place. But when they got to tho old chiiroh and opened tlio door, there,- within, the building, wero anumberof deer, who had probably sought, shelter from tho vio lence of the wintbr- storni, and whose startled movements .WerO what the brave girl had heard.' And as there was no skull-on tho tomb,) the "old farmer was coin polled to return home -and give his consent to the girl's marriage to his soil. They took back the skull to its formor resting- place, and ,wero married ; and somo of tlio debr wore killed aiid cooked, itnd they bad venison for the wedding-feast.
