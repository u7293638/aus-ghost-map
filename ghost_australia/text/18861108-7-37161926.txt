SPORTING. V.R.C. SPRING MEETING. STEEPLECHASE DAY. [By Telegraph.] [From our Special Reporter,] Melbourne, November 7. The fourth day of the V.R.C. meeting, of Steeplechase Day, as it is popularly called, in-<*> variably attracts a large attendance to Fleming-<*> ton, and though small in comparison with Cup Day the gathering on Saturday wan larger thin on any previous Steeple Day, and must realises good pn,fit to the funds. '1 he meeting on the whole will pay its own expenses and give the committee a -surplus of i'lo.iOO or £16,000, a sum Fufficient to pay for tbe whole of tbe improve ments tbey have made on building new stand--, &c;, during the past year. This great suc cess is btought about by ihe smart business management that controls tbe dub, by the high status tbat it maintains as the leading turf institution of tbe southern world, by the attrac tions that it offers to visitors in the comp'.ete ress of its appointments, by the U*Ke prizes offered to owners of horses, and by the increased railway communication with outlying districts in Victoria, and the lines tbat are now con necting it with the other colonies, and for many years yet it will continue to grow both in attractiveness and importance. Tais season has brought visitors from all quarter- of the world to Melbourne, and notafevhive pro mised to come back again or send their frien-is out from England or America to be in M-l -b-ome at Cup time. Sir Henry and Lidy Loch were present on Saturday with their vice regal visitors from the other colonies, and the stands and lawns were again well patronised, while there was the utual holiday concourse on the hill and in the pjuldocks. The weather tl.is warm enough to make tbe -U-'b iays a little oppressive, and an occasional doud of duet was blown across the landscape, but on the whole the day was in every way suitable fur euch a meeting, Tbe racing on Saturday _ was veiy interesting, but the fav4.ri!es in __t of the events were defeated, and the ring consequently bad a good time. In the opei.irig event, however, the moral came iff, as Volcano bad nn difficulty whatever in -tutting down Lord William aud Menotti. The Flcniington Stakes was a very open affair after Hort- rse and Huntingtow-r wrte scratched, and there was considerable difficulty in picking the winner amongst so many two-year-olds, who had each been given a cba_,<_a by tbe handictppcr. The winner, Casui-t, owes bis victory jmrtly tetbe fact that the starter lit bim away with a go <1 lead, which be maintained to tbe end from tbe fa vi rite Oceana, and tbe next two best, Siuprritra and Albert Loddun, who ran a de id heat for tliiiil jiosition. Thirteeoirunners came < lit for tbe V.R.C. Handicap, for wbidi Brown and Rose was a good favorite, but she was beaten at the finish, liravo, the son nf Graud Flaneur—The Onthan, winning from Britisher, wiih tbe favorite third. Eightsportedailkfortlie Sue plechare, and the odds were laid on G tine, but be fell two fences from home, aud Lady Aehton, who went straight the whole journny, won from Native, the only other horse who -tied up, and he cut liis leg co bvlly tliat be c-.ul'l hardly get past tbe post. The winner was "dead b-at" when sbe fintflied, and Game would have won easily had he stood up. C-iriigan, his rider, was not hurt, but McC'ree. the rider of Wickliffe, was so badly injur, ,1 internally by his fall that his life is despaired of. Lady Carrington, Have l-jk. Moe-*nlip_t, aud Curiosity also tumbled, but tbeir j tks were unhurt. The Canterbury Plate tui-u_be_-d a grand set to between Trilent ar.d TieiiUn, the latter being favorite with tbe ode-sorbim. Tamarisk aadCydopealso-tarted, but <*nly to render aid to tbe others. Tbere -(-.as a eplrndid finish home between the pur, and Trident beat Trenton handsomely, jmti f> .itg all tbe confidence jlac-trd in him by bis Klioweis for the Melbourne Cup. He is a grard ex't, aud TreutoD, tbou^b ddeated. is oertainly net disgraced. Odds of 1,000 to MJO were laid on Trenton by a sporting _i_dico iutt sis the horsts went to the pest. Thirteen runnera . aoain came out fcr tlie Fiee Handicap, fur which Lord Wilton wae made a warm fave-rite, and al-io n_.ved by many of tlie books. Tbe nie-ial oa this ocoa ?-i.n, however, was capsized by Hales on H.,^ inanay, who is more suited fur the small sticki t ban for the fiat, but be haa m rare torn of foot 4'vtrtbis distance, and won quite easily trim Wilt, n, Remus and Tbe Nun -running a deal heat for third place, IlAtls' l"H<"l>ri"E STANDS A eweepetakes of 10 eova. each, with 100 acd.-. lor three-year olds, the produce of mares 4>.v>red in l"sR2.
