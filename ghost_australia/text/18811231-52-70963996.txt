TO TUB EDITOR. OP THE . *' DAIIiT TELEGRAPH." Sir, - Ghosts or no ghosts, apparitions aro /. faot. My own aunt was engaged to be married to ' a gentleman who, after . hia encraerement. went to ( \- hi3 engagement, went to China. One night : daring his absence my aunt awoke her mother, 'with whom Bhe was Bleeping, and Baid ./"{Mother, there is James at the foot of tho bad." My grand mother, saw nothing, but my aunt was broken in heart and spirit from that night. Letters still continued to come for four -, months from the affi need, the last of which said he might be homo before his letter, if not that the trousseau was to bb prepared at or.ee. Tho Bhip . by whioh James was oxpocted arrived a week after the letter with the news that ho had died from r '? the effects of an accident on tho very day of the apparition. My aunt never recovered her spirits. I well remember her dejected face, though it is nearly 40 yeats sinco her death. Sho was the oldest of Ta family of nine, and her father, mother, and eight brothers and sisters were witnesses of her constant despondency and firm conviction that she would never see James again in tho flesh. Can we account for this on tho mero principio of coincidence P Why should the silent appearauco have left tho impression that it meant a final farewell P There is hardly a family in England that has not some such incident to relate; but the Sadducees, who neither believe in angel nor spirit, aro so credu loua that they prefer to beiioro negative to positive evidence-that is. the weaker evidence of those who Have not seen to the stronger of those who have. I enolbse my card* and am, Sir, yours obediently, October 12, No SADDUCEE.
