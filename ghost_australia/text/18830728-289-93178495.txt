THE SYDNEY HERESY CASE. Sydney, July 20. Tbe special general district meeting of the Weslej an Church, convened for the purpose of considering the heresy case preferred against the Rev. John Oabome, of the York street Church, agreed to the following find ing :— FirBt— ? After hearing Mr. Oaborne's frock declaration of his belief in the Deity of the Lord Jesusdhristand His atonemect for sin by His death ; in the deity of the Holy Ghost; in the plenary inspiration of the Holy Scriptures, and in the efficacy of prayer, and having heard also of his sincere attach ment to the Methodist doctrines generally embodied in cur acknowledged standards, we cordially accept his statements as full and s&tisfaetory.; At the same time we regret that his method cf presenting these truths is at times so inapt as. to produce the im pretsicn on the minds of some .that he is erroneous in doctrine. Second— In reference to the sermon delivered in tbe York-street Church on Sunday evening, April 22, on Reman Catholicism, we are con vinced that Mr. Osborne is sound in the doctrines of Protestantism as held by the Methodist Church, yet from the evidence we are satisfied that in the former part of his discourse he was so unguarded in his statements as to appear to advance doctrines not in harmony with our standards. Third, That the president communicate the foregoing resolutions to Mr. Osborne.
