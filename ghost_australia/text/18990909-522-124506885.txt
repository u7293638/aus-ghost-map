Rcld'sGyration., Mr. Jieid, having for the past1 five years per formed on the-tight rope to the gintiCtcntion of the mob,- has suddenly found'the Mbor member' bob at one end of his balance pole of' political expedience to havo dropped off. and over Georgia ? goes, Ml-. Heid has however much' of a tennis ball in his com position.. He is spherical, hollow, veryv elastic, and'refrounds in every unoxpectted way, and'what his next gyration may bo awnits the sensation of' to-morrow.
