TIIE SAN rIIA L MISSION'. [The Rev. J. Nelson has handed us the following letter for insertion.—Eu J My dear Nelson,-On Friday, the 14th instant, ones of our brethren's house and out-house was burnt down by the heathenH in Chapanlia. On Sunday, the lGth, ninety-eight of our people commemorated On Monday, the Lord's the 17th, d«.aih. I married three hopeful young C °On le Tuesday, 18th, I had a Bible- reading with twenty schoolmaBters. . , , , . .. Ten days ago our first camp, with forty of our Christians, left for the west; they will turn north twenty miles, and (D v.) join the second camp twenty mdes east after two months. I expect to leave with the second camp in eight days for twenty miles east, where we shall build a new mission-station. The country is large, very large, pray ye for more labourers. Twenty of our native preachers are stationed, two and two, 20 miles north, 20 miles south, 20 miles oast, 10 and 0 miles all around. Some of them are men of spiritual power, and successful workers; others are sharp like needles, but of little or no spiritual power. May God baptize us all with the power of the Holy Ghost, and help to glorify His Name by bringing many to a saving knowledge of His truth. One hundred and thirteen men and women have been baptized in 1883 and 1884 ; but as for the hundred thousand, they are as yet unsaved, it is enough to make the angela weep, and 1 think it might well make the church weep. Here are thousands and thousands, thousands and t?ns of thousands trotting ,.n day and night to an unblessed, eternity, and the Christians slumbering all lb-: while. Instead of obeying the Lord's command," Go and preach," they are taking care of themselves. Next week we shall be busy building at Bethlehem for the extension of Jesus's Kingdom. 14,000 paiteuta have been attended. Affectionately yours, " Bethel," Jamtara, E.R.I. A. IIASGERT.
