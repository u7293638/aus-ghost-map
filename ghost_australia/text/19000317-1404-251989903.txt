The Excommunication of a Distinguished Heretic- • Dr St. George Mivart, who has been excommunicated by Cardinal Vsughan. publishes in Saturday's dimes' his correspondence with the Cardinal. Most of the letters are curious—one or two are tuggestive—reading. Apart from tie distinguished heretic's contention that a person ' may be actually a Roman Catholic and yet dishelieve in the Incarnation and the Resurrection'—a sentence that must have made the Cardinal's hair stand on end—St. George Mivart thus summarises as a devont Roman Catholic—he still claims to be eo—his confession of faith :— 'The world waB not created in any eix periods, of time; the story of the eerpent and the tree if altogether false ; the history of the Tower of Babel is a mere fiotion; the story of Noah's Ark is also quite erroneous, as again that of the plagues of Egypt ; neither Joshua or Hizekhh interfered with the regularity of solar time ; Jonah did not live •tithin the bally of any kind of marine animal; Lot's wife was never turned into a pillar of salt; and Balaam's aes never spoke.' Dr St George says tbese are some of the things on which he has to make affirmation as part of the Roman Catholic Church's Confession of Faith, and wbioh he Etontly declares any Roman Catholic who holds that ' the bioks of the New and Old Testament?, with all their parts, were written by the Holy Ghost and have God for their euthor,' ought not and could not logically or rationally make.
