THE PAN ANGLICAN SYNOD. I « ADDRESS OF THE BISHOPS. I ' To the Jj'aitlitui in Christ Jesus, the Priests and Deacons, and the Lay Members of the Church of Christ in Communion with the Anglican Branch of the Church Catholic, WeJ the undersigned Bishops, gathered under the good providence of God for prayer and conference at Lambeth, pray for you that you may obtain grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. We give thanks to God, brethren beloved, for the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love towards the Saints, which hath abounded among you and for the knowledge of Christ which through you hath been spread abroad among the most vigorous races of the earth. And with one mouth we make our supplications to God even the Father, that by the power of the Holy Ghost He would strengthen us with His might to amend among us the things which are amiss, to supply the things which are lacking, and to reach forth unto higher measures of love and zeal in worshipping Him, and in making known His name and we pray that in His good time. He would give back unto His whole Church the blessed gift of unity in Truth. And now we exhort you in love that you keep whole and undefiled the Faith once delivered to the Saints, as ye have received it of the Lord Jesus. We entreat you to watch and pray, and to strive heartily with us against the frauds and i subtleties wherewith the Faith hath been aforetime and is now assailed. We beseech you to hold fast as the sure word of God all the canonical scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and that by diligent study of these oracles of God, praying in the Holy Ghost, ye seek to know more of the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour, whom they reveal unto us, and of the will of God which they declare. Furthermore, we entreat, you to guard yourselves and yours against the growing superstitions and additions with which in those latter days the truth of God halfback overlaid ; as otherwise, so especially by the pretension to universal sovereignty over God'shoritago assorted f or the See of Rome and by the practical exhalation of the blessed Virgin Mary as mediator in the place of her Divine Son, and by the addressing of prayers to her as intercessor between God and man. Of such beware, we beseech you, knowing that the jealous God giveth not His honour to another. Build yourselves up therefore, bolovcd.iuyour most holy faith ; grow in grace and in the knowledge and love of Jesus Christ our Lord. Show forth before all men by your faith, self-denial, purity, and godly conversation, as well as by your labours for the people among whom God hath so widely spread you, and by the setting forth of His Gospel to the unbelievers and the heathen, that you are indeed the servants of Him who died for us to reconcile His Father to us, and to be a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world. Brethren beloved, with one voice we warn you ; the time is short the Lord cometh ; watch and be sober. Abide steadfast in the communion of saints wherein God hath granted you a place. Seek in faith for oneness with Christ in the blessed sacrament of His body and blood. Hold fast the Creeds, and the pure worship and order, which of God's grace we have inherited from the Primitive Church. Beware of causing divisions contrary to the doctrine you have received. Pray and seek for unity among yourselves, and among all the faithful in Christ Jesus, and the good Lord make you perfect, and keep your bodies, souls, and spirits until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.

A conversazione in honour of the bishops of the colonial and United States Churches, under the auspices of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, was held on the 27th September, in St James's Hall. The floor of the large room was occupied by a large assemblage of clergymen and laymen, who spent two hours in conversation before the arrival of the bishops, who did not enter the hall until five o'clock, having been detained by a discussion at the Synod at Lambeth Palace. A number of ladies occupied the gallery. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Oxford, and the Bishop of London, introduced the Aiuorioau and Colonial Bishops, and all were cordially received. The Archbishop of Canterbury took the chair. He read a letter from the Secretary of the Society for the Pro- motion of Christian Knowledge expressing regret that oiroumstauous had prevented that society from giving a public welcome to the Bishops, The Archbishop added that that letter expressed the feelings of all present. They rejoiced to welcome those who had come from distant parts of the world to take part in this Conf orouco, A deep debt of gratitude was owing to them for having taken such interest in the matter, and made such sacrifices for it. At first it was doubtful whether it would be possible to give up any portion of that day for a meeting like that. At the same time an anxious wish was expressed on the part of the clergy of London and the neighbourhood, and of many members of the Church of England, that they should have an opportunity of seeing face to face those who had come to the Conference, and that a portion of the day should be given up for this purpose. He wished that a larger portion of the day could have been devoted to the meeting. The Rev. Mr. Bullock, the secretary to the society, read an address of welcome to the American and Colonial Bishops. The Bishops of Vermont, New Zealand, Louisiana, Cape Town, and Rhode Island having briefly addressed the company, the Bishop of London, as head of the diocese in which the meeting was held, expressed his satisfaction in welcoming the Bishops to this city. It was not for him to reveal any of the secrets of what had been done at Lambeth Palace ; but the Synod had forced on his mind the thought that, although men said the Church was so much divided, there was a real and essential unity of heart and faith, and that such gatherings would testify to the great truth that, with all their diversities of individual character, of training, and of nationality, they were still one at heart, anxious to promote in their several ways the great work committed to them. The Bishop of Ontario having addressed the meeting, the Bishop of Oxford spoke humourously and forcibly on the necessity of providing a mission house for the society. He expressed his conviction of the Apostolical character of the Synod which had been held. He had no doubt that heresies in the Church arose in little communities from the sway of particular minds and the force of particular circumstances and just as they could not get the light of Heaven unless the prismatic rays were mingled in the common composition of light, so they could not keep the truth of the Holy Catholic Church long untainted unless they blended good men of different habits of thought and got their united decisions upon the difficulties with which the Church might be beset. The Archbishop pronounced the Benediction and the conversazione soon afterwards broke up. An annual subscription to the amount of £125 for the Natal bishopric was raised in the room.
