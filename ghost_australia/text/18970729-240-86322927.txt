AN ASTOUNDINO FOREGAST. Mr Edison, it is understood, is respon. sible for a very remarkable vision of the future. The man of A.D. 2107, we are confidently asesred, will be able not only to talk to the planets on the dot. and-dash system of the Morse telegraph, he will be able to visit them at pleasnre, and with much greater ease than we now visit cities only a few hundred miles distant, reaching the planet Mars, for example, as Mr Latrhop, with anxious accuracy computes, in about "eight hours eight minutes !" There are to be on this prosiae earth itself electrical trains run ning 150 miles an hour; motor bicycles (of course); "walking" baloons-baloons, that is, that float 30 feet above the sur face of the earth, having mechanical legs made of aluminium, and travel like gigantic ostriches at an emormons speed. We are promised air ships, automatic mail packets that fly, self-impelled, through space to their destination with out being carried. Books exchanged for phonographs, which will present a tale to the ear instead of the eye. Artificial chemical foods will make wheat fields and flocks and herds uonecessary. Mi crobes are to be enlisted, drilled and employed to extirpate disease instead of spreading it. "Telescopic " cannon will make battles and sieges so dreadful dismissing a city into mere vapour at a stroke-that war itself will vanish. New amusements will make life happy; new arts will make it rich ; new guards will make it secure. There will be a telephone to the sun. Parliaments and thrones will flee like a flock of ghosts te fore the dawn, and the federated human race will lie, lapped in universal peace and swathed in golden comfort, under a World Committee of Twenty I These be dreams, indeed. But whether they are simply the wild visions that haunt the chambers of a lunatic braio, or the pictures which shape themselves in the serene light of a brooding scientific imagination, spelling out the great syl lables of Nature's grammar, who will undertake to say?
