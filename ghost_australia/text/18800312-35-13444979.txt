Iho unfairness of ndnnnistintion during so many veins has dono much to injure the system, which, but tor its inherent vitality, w ould probabl) have long sinco succumbed" Tho hosti- lity spoken of is quite imaginary Notw ithstanding tho trouble tho) havo ofton caused, tho Council has tieated Denominational fichools with so much forbearance as to bring down sovero censures from anti- denonunationaltsts And, as to tho inherent vitality of tho system, I venture to usseit that if the Council had granted certificates to schools w horever tho simple conditions of tho Act wore complied w ith, the system would havo collapBid years ago It was ona thing to retain Denominational schools already estab- lished and doing good work It would havo been looked upon as quito another thing to sot up now Denominational schools to oppose Public sohools (Hear, hear ) Had this been dono to anj considerable oxtcnt, no one who has given attention to the subi cet can doubt that su<*h an outcry would have been raised as would havo precipitated the aotion now taken by tho bill boforo us It will be perceived that the terms of the 9th section aro peiniissiv e, not compulsory, and thoieforo the Council felt at liberty to set np for their ownguidanco another condition, not named in the Act 1 hoj felt it would be impolitic and contrar) to tho under- stood intentions of the Legislature to iniUtiply Denomina- tional schools m opposition to Public schools, and so they granted certificates to new schools when tho condi- tions of the Act were complied with, and when, m addition, it was proved that the accommodation in oxistmg schools was insufficient Iho Council did not act capriciously In giv mg or w lthholdmg corti neates, but on tho well defined principles I have named, and their action tended undoubtedly to tho conservation of the system That their action was in accord with tho views and inten- tions of tho Legislarme maybe presumed from the fact that the Premier of the day, Sir James Marhu the Colonial Secretar), Mr Parkes, the Speakor, Mr Arnold , and tho Chairman of Committees of this House, Mr Allon, woro membois of tho first Council of Education, and laid down its lines of action Under the powers convoj ed by tho Act, tho number of certified schools has boen diminished to ono half, by tho weeding out of the small and inefficient, while the remainder havo been much improved in ellicionoy, aoooidluH lu tho testimony of oven ti mr »«.. f» »«»a» Duringthel3 venrs of tho Council's existence it has ceiti fied U now Denominational schools, 11 of theao being Roman Catholic, one Church of England, and ono Ilebrow, but tbo net result is, that whilo in 1SG7 thoro woro 310 Denominational Bohools, at tho end ot last yoii thoro were only loo Tho weeding out process is still going on, and nenily a do/cu more certi- fied schools aio about rlpo foi tho opomtion Scoing, then that the mixed sj stem hns vi oikid fairly well, and giv en roasonablo satisfaction to the grout bulk of the people, that its oflloicnoy is increasing and that rho Pubho Hchool section l8 rapidly oxpandmg while tho Denomina- tional is quiotly contracting, how comes it that ne aro now j called upon to uproot tho remaining Denominational echo ils, and therob) to Btir up a souso if wrong among a consider- able propoition of our follow-colonisis, and endow thom v, ith a real and tangiblo gnevanco-stiroly a most unde- sirable result, and requiring strong justification Well, I suppose it is understood by all that the immediate causo of this hostilo movement m respoct of Denominational sohools is tho lsbuo of the late Pustoials ot tho Loman ( ntholio Church It is not my business to onticiso thoso Pastorals, but undoubtedly m rospeot of Pubho schools they throw down a challenge whioh tho country and the Government could not well avoid taking up On lead- ing the first of these Pastúrala tho thought flashed irresis- tibly across my mind, " There is an end of Denominational schools " Had tho Roman Catholic Church soon fit to con- tinuo a consenting p irty to the existing compromibO-had tlicv, in fact, let v\ eil alono-Denominational schools might hav o enjoyed tho aid of tho State for many years, but in denouncing Public schools, aud in lefusmg to accept thoir benefits, tho authorities ot tho Church must surely havo foioseen that tho friends of Publio schools would in- evitably be stirred up, not oniy to vigorous de- fence, but to retaliation Porhaps this was foreseen, aud it may have boen hoped that, although Denominational schools might bo n«opt away, yet that a system of paymont by results would follow It is needless to discuss this payment by results, foi whatever may happen in the distant future, I am vorv suro that it Is not likely to meet with any favoui lu the present. Well, I regret that occasion has arisen for tho prospective abolition of Denominational schools, and I would have been glad if a longer tenu of hfo than throe voarn had beon granted, or oven If a sliding; scale of extinguishment had been adopted, so that tho weaker sohoolb miL,ht go within three v ears, ana that the more vigorous murht havo an extended lease , but I am not prepared to say that the proposition of tho Govern- ment IB not justifiable or (expedient, and I do not intend to oifet anv opposition to this part of the bul Tho late election for Last Sydney turnod on this very point, and it proved docisivelj that the majority of that constituency were in favour of this measure, and I have no doubt that a similar result would have followed had it been possible to test tho views of tho whole country At this stage one is tempted to inquire what it is that tho Denominationalists are fighting for, and whether tho thing is really worth much contention Ostensibly it is that the different Churches may have schools of their own where their children may receive dogmatic religious instruction from tho ordinary schoolmaster Perhaps a deeper principle underlies this— that tho clergy may have control of tho education of tho young But, taking it simply as a desire that the schoolmaster should bo tho medium of dogmatic religious teaching, I doubt much if the privilege is of real value Tho noted English preacher, Spurgeon, once said that he was brought up in a Church school, but that all the religion he ever got there he could have carried away in a hollow tooth (Laughter ) I doubt if a larger receptacle would generally be required here But what I may think or other individual members may think is of little conso quence when we know, as a fact, that many consider it of vital importance As to tho general religious teaching in State-aided sohools, which is provided for m the jxistinp; Act, and retained in tho bill before us, that I trust will nevoi bo given up, and I

Now that t'.:o Treasurer has 'somo àit'icuHy in making ends meet, I think it a pity to givo up so much rovenue ; but I ara pot prepnied to say that the Government is wiong in this matter. It may hnvo been judicious lo give up halt to btivo the remainder. (Ilrar, hoar.) Tho division in the Assembly on this point ehuwed thnt there win« a st ron? disposition to abolish fees altogether, mid ibis, Ï Ihink, would bo a gient rnist'ikn, not iiioicly liccau«« a considbrnblo revenue ' would lie needlessly sacrificed, bul bocnuso it Ifiiels to deaden parente! responsibility, nnd to onronrnir« inegulnr ntlcii dnncc, ¡md it weakens political virtue by teaching peopln to look to the Slate for everything. (Hear, hoar.) Tho best authorities condemn freo schooling.' I might multiply piooE of this, but will troublo tho lipuso with only ono 'quota- tion. It is from ii report by tho Itov. Cnnon Noiris, formerly nn inspector of schools in Ennhiiid : .' "That parents ought to fool responsible for their . children's education is nllowod by all. That tho State, or the clergy, or a Ronioty, or a patron, should falco it out of thoir bnnds and do it for thom, is dearly a second-best ex- pedient, nu argument,that something is wiong, a concession ' to conditions (teni or supposed) which wo must all déploie. ' Earnest men havo over felt this. Dr. Chalmors perhaps ono of the gre» test authorities that I could cito on tho mvbjoct, writes,-* Tho only vv.iv of thoroughly incorporating tho education of the young with the habit of families, is to maka it form n part of the family expenditure, and thui to make tho interest, and tho watchfulness, mid the jealousy of th» parents PO many guarantees for tho diligence of the children ; nnd for theso reasons do wo bold tho establishment of freo pchooln in a country to be a frail and impolitic oxporlient.' " (Hoar, hear.) Them is, I think, only ono enso whern foes may bo nbolished with impunity, and thnt is where schools nre sup- ported in whole or in part by locnl rates I would not oven then commend tho abolition of fees, but the mensuro would be comparatively harmless-harmless ns far ns parents aro concerned-but teachers would still run the nsk of injury ; for the substitution of a fixed salary for com- bined salary and fees tends to diminish the difference be- tween a good and a middling1 teacher. They may hnvo tho samo attainments mid thn name classification, but tho one may bo popular and successful and the other a goori deal tho rovorso, for to bo popular and successful mny dopend on qualities that cannot bo gauircd by oxmniiinnon, mid aro not taken account of in classification. But tho popular teacher draws pupils in abundance, and gets his reward in incrrnsod fees. Do away with foes and bo loses his advantage. To the latter part of cla'i«« 11, rcli'ing to fees, I mupt talco the strongest exception. By this the teacher is put into the unpleasant p>=;tion of a mere tax-gatherer. Ile collects monov tint will not in nny way benefit himself, nnd simply icniits it In the Trensmy." Do vou think ho is likely to bo mabins in FUIOI n work ? Or, that the parents uro likely to bp foin aid in paying their iliics ? Observe, thcio is no piovUion in ibis bill for tho legal roo'Very of fees, as in tho existing Act. It scorns clear fo mo tint this enactment will speedily put nn end to fees altogether, and I hnvo no doubt that somo mippoilcd it in lhe other Chamber for tiiis vciy reason. (Ilcnr, henr.) parents disposed to pay fees will desire that the teacher who has worked for them shall enjoy thom, nnd if this cannot bo tbe\ will cease to pav them Anuther nupoitunt point to bo

higher ordor of mind among its teachers, and it would bo seen that puro materialism was advocated, and that the existence of a Supremo Being as the governor of the world was ignored. But I will now proceed to read a few extroota from tho saying» of others who cannot be considered as belonging to that class of thinkers. At a locturo, delivered at a meeting of tho United Secularist Pro- pagandista Society on tho Heroes of tho Bible. Ho found tho lecturer stating-" Tho Bible, then, he took to bo a grund old book and a fine eplo poom. If It wore to be read as true, it would be ' trumpery,' but the imagination that could concoct tho story of the Creation or tho Deluge was far moro poworful than that which had elaborated the stories of Baron Munchauson or Robinson Crusoo ; because thc->e authors had somo facts to go upon, whereas the Bible authors had none." Ho further states, " Jehovah was an attempt to roprcsont God in a physical form. Adam and Moses saw Him. In fact-ho was merely an exaggerated human character. . . . Ho was moreovor inconsistent. He made tho world, and then was so disappointed at another bciug stopping unpolitoly in to intorfoio with tho happy pair that ho dociared his seven days work useless, and ' ropented.' Ho destroyed it by a flood, but still failed to do any good. There was no improvotnont, for the fovv ho kept alive turned out a thousand times worse thnu those who had preceded them." Speaking of Adam, ho said,-" Ho was simply a naked savage, living on un- cooked vp«rntablc!H, with no knives and forks to oat them « i th, or rough towoi» to keep his body oloan." Ho would not quote further from this disgusting ribaldry, but ho thought ho had shown tho Council that it would bo impossible to comply with tho suggestion of tho League for a purely Bocular education in tho primary schools. Lot thom turn now to tho other objectors to tho system of primary education at present in force. . Tlioso wore to bo found in tho utterances of tho ecclesiastical heads of ono of tho principal denomina- tions in tho colony;. These havo denounced the Public schools as ". seed plot's of infidelity," and had couiumndod tile members of 'their''Church to withdraw their children from these schools, and had threatened thom with roligious ponnltios in caso of disobedience. Thua virtually ignoring jiha oxiste.nco., of thoso schools thoy had not naked for tho rontinuniico("of the present system, but for ita abolition as far na thoy wero conoorned, and tho introduction of a now one. Thoy laid great stress upon tho importance of re- ligion forming tho basis of primary education, but denied that it could bo taught in Public schools, or othorwiso than by placing tbeso schools under tho solo direction and control of tho teachor.i of dogiuulic theology-the State doing nolhiiig but paying for results. Now, ho agreed with thom ns to religion being tho indispensable basis of primary education ; but ho deniod their proposition, that religion cimnot bo tuuerbt in Stato schools. Toni riva at this conclusion it would bo nocosbiuy to oxnmino what roligion was. Roligious teaching ho took to bo tho inculca- tion ot those principles which inipiessoil upon tho mind tim duties which overy^iudividunl owed to his Maker and his fellow-mon. Now,' in a Chrisliun country, these principles must necessarily be found in the dootiines of Christianity, n!though fhoro was considerable diversity of opinion among Christiansxvhat thoso doetiines wero; a difference so wido, that what oño body hold ns vital truth, others denounced as dnmnablo error. It was evident, thereforo, that tho State cannot undertake tho teaohing of dogmotic theology. Still, I thoro was a broad foundation on which all professing ' Christians woro agreed. Ho could not givo a bettor I definition of this common Christianity than by ' quoting the words of tho Bishop of MVinohostor. | The Bishop of MVinehnstor in addressing a Church j Congress >on tho subj'oot of tho fundamental differences botvyoen tho schools of thought in the Churches, gave tho ' following as a dofiuitiou of the common doctiiiïos of Chris- ] j tinnity :-" Ho could not undertake to say thoro woro no i ' small"schools of thought botween which furidumentnl differ I enees existed, but ho was assured that botween tho largo ' j schools ,thnio woro no such differences. Nay, though it I j might sound bold to say so, ho fearlessly assorted that even i botween tho Ultramontano Itouian Catholics and oxtromo , j Dissenters Ibero vveio moro points of agreement than of I difference Thoy nil bolioved in the samo God, tho Father, I j Son, and>'Holy Ghost; thoy all put thoir wholo hopa and ; trust in .the Incarnation, tho Death and Passion of Jesus ' { Christ. .They looked to no source of régénération, sancti i Mention and holiness but tho Holy Spirit of God ; thoy all 1 believed in Jesus Christ as their King, and thoy nil hopod at last to reign with Him.

implanted early and nourished through life " It appealed to him that neither of the D1U3 neither the Land Aot nor the Education Act, had been drawn up with reference to that wiso maxim, and he doubted whether tho ohildren of tho squatter, or tho froo- selector, or the Roman Catholic would hereafter bless the authors of these bills Ho had, a fcaw months ago, in a meotmg of English ahurohmon, to

MVhether these were appro- priate or inappropriate to the subject beforo the House ho would allow hon. members to form an opinion ; but he certainly thought that not one of them was suitablo to it. The lion, gentloman seldom made a speech which was not full of quotations, but sometimes he favoured them with.-[Sir JOHN ROBERTSON : Chinese.] -translations. In this instance he had _ favoured them with quotations without translations. This was not fair.. Tho bon. gentloman was taking it for granted that every mombor was as learned as himself. This was a great mistake. If tho hon. gentleman had spoken in modern languages he might havo understood of a meat of what he said, but ho must confess his igncr.ince of what had beon said in Latin and Gi eck-[Sir JOHN ROJVKUTSON : And Chinese |-and Chinese. Indeed, he did not think that tha hon. gentleman had emitted anything whioh would serve to oooupy tho time of tho House. In respect to the inferences which tho bon. gentle- man had drawn from history, ho could not subscribe to hi« dogmas, and he thought that tho hon. gentloman, with all his learning, requireda guide in history. The Act of 1866, in his opinion, was one of the greatest blessings conferred on tho colony, and he considered that tho present bill waa an improvement upon it; and, therefore, ho intended to sup Íioi't the present bill, although he might think that some of ts clauses would need a little altering. What was the state of education in tho colony beforo the Act of 1866 was pissed ? There'was no such thing as training Bchools in those days. Any persons who offered themselves UB teachers woro "accepted. From the report of a commission appointod by the late Mr. Cooper in 1865 to inquire into the school system, he found that this was the state of the schools at that timo :-" Tho Roman Catholics had for teachers 2 drapers, 6 clerks, I grocer, I servant, 2 shop kecp»rs, I dealer, I miller, I turnkey, 1 overseer, 1 farmer. 1 solicitor, and I compositor." The Church of England I had " 3 grocers, 1 lund surveyor, 22 clerks, 1 military clerk, | 2 soldiers, 1 traveller, 6 farmers, 1 gardener, 1 upholsterer, , 2 Buporintondonts, 1 mat ¡nor, 2 merchants, 1 surgeon, 1 engi- I neer, 1 tailor, 1 settler, 1 gold policeman, ? storekeepers, 1 i brewer, 1 auctioneer, 1 wheelwright, 1 apothecary, 1 confec | tioner, I solicitor, 1 currier, I watchmaker, and I agent" i From tho want of efficient training schools, the office of schoolmaster wa« the rofugo of the destitute, and there were, as instructors of the Australian youth, turnkeys, | tailors, sailors, curriers, confectioners, wheelwrights, eco. I A very similar state of things ooourred in England about ton years before ; and when tha Government there asked for £100,000 for educational purposes, it was thought that the [ granting of it would lead to an interference with tho religious convictions and civil rights of her Majssty's subjects ; and it was moved that a i select committee should be appointed to inquire into the matter. MVhat was tho state of things in England at that timo? Ho would ask bon. gentlemen to liston to somo remarks of Lord Macaulay, mode in tho House of Commons on tho 10th of April, 18-17 : " I would earnestly entreat overv gentloman to look at a .. ' ? - . * . ^ - ---J!- i~*l... fl_"t ""!,""" report which is contained in the appendix to the first volume of tho Minutes of the Committee of Council. I speak of tho report made by Mr. Seymour Tromonhoaro on the state of that part of Monmouthshire whioh is inhabited by »popu- lation chiefly employed in mining. He found that, in this district, towards tho close of 1839, out of eleven thousand childi-on who were of an ago to attend school, eight thousand novar went to any school at all, and that most of the re- maining three thousand might almost as well havo gone to no school as to the squalid hovels in which men who ought thomsclve3 to have boon learners protended to teach. In general these mon had only one qualification for their em- ployment ; and that was tlieir utter unfitness for every other employment. Thoy weredisabledminera, or broken hucksters. In their schools all was stench, and noise, and confusion. Now and then tho clamour of tho boys was silenced for two minutes by the furious menaces of the master ; but it soon broke out again. The instruction given was of the lowest kind. Not one school in ten was provided with a single map." Now, all this was changed, although tho chango was mot with great opposition, with the most blind opposition from members of thb vory denomination to whioh he belonged tho Congregationalism or Indopendents. Fortunately for England, and for this country, thoir prejudice« had been removed to a great oxtont, and (rreat work was being done in the direction of educating the people. MVhon ho was for a short time a member of tho Council of Education ho was much pleased with what he learned there. He had wished that when he was a boy ho could have had the advantage of attending an institution like the Fort-street school. Ho might have been differont to what he was, though Binco he loft school-and ho was only at one which was worthy of tho name-he had not boen tdlo in endeavouring to improve his timo. Thoro wero no turnkeys in the schools now as toockors, and this was in conséquence of the Aot of 1866. Thoy talked about injustico being dono, but ho did not see whore it would bo inflicted. Indeed, thoro could not b« any injustice. His bon. friend had spoken »bout the hardship of Roman Catholic children being mixed with Protestants, and foared that words might be used which would hurt their feelings concerning ¿io virgin Mary or the Eucharist. He boliovod that such things hardly ever occurred, and that the Roman Catholics were respoctod in the sohools as much as Protestants. And the utmost latitude was being given to Roman OatholioB under this measure, for portions of the school buildings wera being set apart in which they and other ministers of religious denominations might give religious instruction to the children. MVaa greater liberty over granted in any country under the nun f If this did not suit tho DenominationiilistB, they could build chapel» near the schools, in whioh the priest, the clergyman, or what- ever ho might bo, could give the ohildren religious instruc- tion for an hour daily. Surely one hour. a day was quito suffioiout, besides secular instruction. If children were stuffed too much it had the effect of making thom confused. Exception had been taken to re- ligious education boing given in the schools. He had taken the trouble to refer to somo of rho school books, and he found amongst tho school lessons : No. 1. Old Testament. Tho Doiiay and the authorized versions compared with tho original. From the 1st to thb 50th ohupter of Genesis. No. 2. Old Tostumont. From Exodus 1st to tho end of Deuteronomy. Extract from lesson 35 : " Hoar, O Israel ; the Lord our God is one Lord, and thou shah lovo tho Lord thy God with thy wholo 1 boort, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole might. And theso words whioh I command thee this day shall bo in thy heart, and thou slinlt impress them upon thy children, and slialt talk of them when thou sittcst in thy houso, and when thou walkest by the way. and whan thou liest down, and whon thou risast np.

Did his hon. friend take exception to these f Besides this the Public sohools wera Roman Catholio as well as Protestant, siuoo thoro were Catholio teachers in I thom as well ns Protestant onos. [Sir JOHN ROBERT- SON : II cal, hear.] It would appear from what hod , boon said that im attempt would bo mado to compel Catholio children to attond Protestant schools. No such thing was likoly to ooour, because the Catholio teacher was as likoly to obtain employment in tho school» as the Protestant. His hou. friend, who appeared to be asleep and ho could not wait until ho waked-hud spoken of a brooch of trust. His friend was an oquity lawyer, and when a loarnod lawyer spoke of a breach of trust he ought to be prepared to show whero it existed. Boçause the Parliament m its wisdom endowed tlio Catholic schools to a certain oxtent, aud because it was thought oxpedient to withdraw this endowment, was that a breach of trust ? Those schools had boon endovvod for a certain tin'D, nnd there was no pledge for a term of yoara. Because the endow- ment ceasod, was there a breach of trust V The hon. gontloman had enid that respectable people ought to bo ashamed to soud their children to the Publio sohools. . Thoy contributed to the funds, and the doors wero open to ' all without oxooption, and ho would bo sorry to say to any : children, that becnuso their parents woro welt" off, the schools wore not intended for thom. In rognrd to evening schools, | ho thought that great advantages ware attached to them, us ' thoy pormittod parsons of mature age or those who could not ! attond day schools to supply any defloioncy in their ' oducotion. There was in regard to the ordinary | sohools great advantage in bringing children to- ; gother, and ho would liko to soo children of every | denomination in tho sanio soliool, so that any ill fooling whioh might ariso in consoquonco of their being kept apart, ' might be rubbed off, aud thoy could become friends for life. Ho would not talc? up tho time of tho House any longer now thairvvuuld permit him to say ngain that ho intended to support the bill. Mr. STEWART movod the adjournment of tho debate, on tho ground that tho hour was cuttinir lute aud several hon. gentlemen desired to speak to CM motion, »nil It irai agreed to.
