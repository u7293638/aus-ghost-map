THE LADIES’COLUMN. At Sunset. It isn t tho thing you do, dear, It’H tho thing vou’vo loft undone Which given you a bit of a heartache At tho sotting of tho mm. Tho tender word forgotten, Tho lettor yon did not write, Tho floworyou might havo sent, dear, Aro your haunting ghosts to»night. Tho stono you rniglit have lifted Out of a brother’s way, Tho bit of licart.Homo counsel You wero hurriod too much to say; Tho loving touch of tho hand, dear, Tho gentle and winsome tono That you had no time or thought for. With troublos enough of your own. Tho littlo net of kindness, So oanily out of inind; Those chances to bo augela Which ovory mortal fiuds— Thoy como in night and sileuco— Each ohill, roproachful wrath— When liopo ia faint and (lagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. 3?or life ia all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To tmlTor our slow compassion That tarries until too lato. And it*a not tho thing you do, dear, It’s tho thing you luuvo nndono Whioh gives you tho bit of hourtncho At tho sotting of tho sun. —seieotcd.
