THE PORT ARTHUR CLOCK. To the Editor. Take it, and bury it out of sight ; For the times it recorded will not bear the light. Round that old clock clung the ghosts of the past, Records of bloodshed and murder and lust. Many a terrible sight I ween, Of heart-rending cruelty that clock has seen ; When the thirsty ground with blood ran red. And tne pitiless sun looked down from o'er head On the victims in deep- despairing woe. Ah, yes, thank God, it was years ago, But the painful memory lingers yet, And men are still striving in vain to forget ; So lay the clock in some nameless bed, And thus let the dead past bury its dead. F.L. Balfour- street, December 7
