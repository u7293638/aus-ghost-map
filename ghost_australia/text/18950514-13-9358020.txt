TUESDAY, MAY 14, 1885. The Reid Budget is just as seriously discussed in Victoria as it is in New South Wales, and for the reason that it affects the one colony as materially as the other. It appears to be a grotesque surprise to some people in Victoria, the people who were not aware of how deep the feeling in favour of fiscal reform is in the sister state, nor how the swelling tide is with it, nor how a decided majority of the labour party are stead- fastly pledged to the cause. The miners as a body are for free trade in New South Wales, and so are the workers of the Sydney suburbs, the metropolis and its suburbs not return- ing one protectionist representative. The great argument that caught on with the working man in Victoria is already known to be false in New South Wales, and the knowledge, it may be added, is rapidly dawning upon the toilers here. Wages were to be higher in this colony as the tariff went up, and the working man in New South Wales knows that wages have been and still are substantially higher there. The evidence given to the Victorian Tariff Board was con- stant on this point of the superior payment of the Sydney operatives, until at last even Mr. BROMLEY abandoned for a time his "barracking" efforts for High Duties and joined in the chorus of admissions. If Mr. REID is suc- cessful it must necessarily be by the vote of the working man, given in the belief that the labourer is better off under low duties than his Victorian brother is under high, and that under still lower duties he will be better off than ever. If a conference between the working men of Victoria and the working men of New South Wales could be arranged it would be of interest. So big a Budget may not be carried without an appeal to the country, but it is to be noted that Mr. REID'S sup- porters in the press are confident that he has a majority in the Lower House, and also that he has a still larger majority in the country. It is difficult indeed, to imagine that such proposals would be submitted if their author were not fully convinced that the growing popular favour is with him in his bold idea of making Sydney not simply a free port, but the freest of the free. In fact it may be said of the protectionist movement in New South Wales that it is becoming more and more confined to the people who desire to retaliate upon Vic- toria by closing all New Southi Wales ports to the products of the southern state, and every patriotic Australian must be so far with Mr. REID as to hope and to believe with him that this particular case is not gaining ground. New South Wales is sharing apparently in the general advance which the British-speaking race is making towards fiscal freedom. It is a sign of the times to find British Chambers of Agriculture —the last stronghold of the British Tory—passing resolutions in favour of freeing the land from burdens rather than of taxing Australian and other pro- duce at the ports, as some few of their fossil leaders would willingly do. This great movement may be said to have begun when the people of the United States elected GROVER CLEVELAND to take the duties off wool, timber, and other raw materials. In Canada the liberal crusade is proceeding. The Cape, it appears, is joining in, under the leader- ship of Mr. CECIL RHODES, to the extent of freeing all imports of manu- factures ; in Victoria the party for Tariff Reform was never so vigorous nor so hopeful ; in New Zealand the agriculturists are making their existence and their discontent known in demands for relief, and now New South Wales puts herself in the front of all by her sweeping Budget scheme. There can be no misreading these indications that the Anglo-Saxon race is to lead the world in commerce as in battle, and under the same flag of freedom. In any case the very introduction of the "free port Budget" must be taken as a notice to us in Victoria that our 50 per cent. fiscal system has had it day feupposo that Liverpool lomained a free port Nvhilo Loudon became iden tilled Nvith 50 per cent duties, and not a loosoning man but Nvould admit that Liverpool would bo destined to become the commercial entrepôt and tho finan wal centre of the empire-and it can scaicelv bo said that the position of Melbourne as regards S) dney is strongei than tho position of London as rogaids Liverpool It is to bo noted that the Sydney opposition is not to be based upon tho impropriety of Mr Bud's proposal, but tho ignoble use is made of fedeiationto diag that causo as a helling across the trail Sir Ulnry Pakkfs, nvIio pressed no federal plan upon Paihament lum self when ho was m poNver, is to join as a practical federationist Sir Gtonar Dibbs, who has opposed tho national movoment, and who has talked of bitter reprisals against Victoiia Tho immo diato effect of such a coalition, one Nvould say, would bo to disgust any straight-dealing peoplo and any parties representing principles-foi it is on tho surface that the îcsult would be that Sir Henky Pakki-s would postpono all idea of the freo port and that Sir Geoiigl Dibbs would block federation But does tho Reid Budget really make against federation, as is freely said it does both hore and m Ncnv South Wales? No doubt it will accentuate tho difference as îegards import duties on foreign goods, but these duties aro not the real bat to federation The real bar is the duties levied by each colony to keep out tho pioduco of the others If nvo could get rid of tho border imposts, there ought to be no dilhculty m a freely elected Ans traban Parliament agreeing to a tariff which all Australia could Ion ally accept as best foi all And Mr Hlid asks the Legislature of Now South Walos to abolish all theso provincial duties Ho said in his speech - " ison Mr Chairman, there is no one and I say it deliberately, who has a truer hope and pride in the earl} confederation of the Australian colonies than I lime Mj next stage after these mensures are disposed of will be to invite both Houses of Parliament to tal c u practical step in that direction I despise the cm\cn fear of those who think that the reforma Nve aihocutc tonight will prejudice the cause of federation lhere can be-there ought to be no federation-no union ot Australia, until the compact can be scaled in ii spirit of brotherhood and nfl'ec non I brhe\e those feelings do preiail Kelling as 1 do upon those feelings I to night, on behalf of tins countrj, instead of offering blow for blow, instead of offerine Tiorder duty for border dut}, I oller our Aus trat mu brethren the free use of all our boundaries (Cheers) 'that measure of peace and goodwill which mc despatch to them to night will strike a chord in every Australian breast more powerful than all your suggestions of self interestor>ourpohey of revenge (lttnewed cheering ) ' Honv enn it bo anti Australian for Ncnv South Wales to throw hoi ports open and to wtthdiaNv o very bolder barrie!, and to allow Yictonan produce and Vic torian manufactuies to ontor her evoiy market from Albuiy to Ncvicastlo absolutely untaxed?

These settlers persisted, in opposition to the advice of the Lands de- partment, in selecting Crown lands at Bul- larto, and at the end of 18 months they found, as had been predicted, that it was quite unfit for cultivation. The Lands department then decided to re- move the houses of the settlers to good land near Elmore, but on the material being loaded on trucks at the Bullarto station it was seized by a local storekeeper who had obtained judgment against the settlers for sums owing for stores. The department wrote to the storekeeper, point- ing out that the material was the property of the Government, it having made advances against the improvements of the settlers, and that he could not distrain on it. He has evidently come to this view also, as yesterday Mr Thomas, the officer in charge of the village settlement branch of the department, received a telegram stating that the creditor had abandoned his seizure. 1 lie period for which the Railway Commis sioners were engaged expires at the end ot next month but it is the intention of the Government to introduce a bill dünnt, the forthcoming
