The Baby Nicholls Tourist Party. The Baby Nicholls Tourist Party gave an entertainment last night in the Temperance Hall, and we can honestly say that a more humorous and versatile performance has never been given in Echuca, and unlike the usual tra velling company, every item on the programme was carried out, including first-class ballad singing, comic songs of a refined order, varied dances, a wonderful exhibition of club swing ing and an extraordinary musical treat, viz., two gentlemen playing on no less than twelve different instruments. Tho first part concluded with a most amusing farce, entitled "The Suburban Ghost." The second part consisted of the Irish musical comedy, Muldoon's Picnic, in which Messrs Will Watkin, Aubrey Douglas, John Elliott, Loch Bracken, Ernest Hawke, George Livick, Jack Harrison, Miss Emily Wilson, Miss Violet Russell and Baby Nicholls kept the audience in a continual simmer of merriment, a and sent the away in a thorough good humour. The company will reappear to-night in an entirely new programme consisting of a minstrel first part with four end men and two new farces, and it is antici pated they will have a good house.
