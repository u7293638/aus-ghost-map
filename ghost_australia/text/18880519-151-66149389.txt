TIHE MOONEE POND GHOST. Have you seen the ghost ? has been the all absorbing question asked this week by timid persons who are afraid to venture far in the gloaming for fear of meeting the ' apparition.' Some daring spirits have been vainly looking for him all the week with stout cudgels and a tar pot, but apparently the man in the sheet, has heard of their kind intentions and has retired till a more favourable opportunity. If he values his skin. it would be well for him to put off the ghost and divert his powers of mimicry tro some better use than that of frightening young damsels and old women. We would remind his ghostship of the fate of another aspiring youth with similar propensities, at St. Kilda, who although for a time he managed to elude detection, "appeared" once too often and was at last very neatly winged by a justly exasperated individual who had sworn to ascertain whether he was bullet proof. The Moonee Ponds "ghost' should take warning by the sad end of the career of Spring heel-Jack. On Wednesday night the ghost walked as usual accompanied by a black figure, evidently his accomplice, on the lookout for any unprotected females. A young lady well-known at Moonee Ponds, who was on her way to a party at the house of an equally well-known gentleman, had just passed Mr. Langtree'e property, when suddenly the ghost appeared and began his antics. The young lady, it is needless to say, was terribly frightened. Her brother who went with her would have given chase only for the fact that he had to support lhis sister who was in a fainting condition. The ghost it seems carries a large knife and is also armed with a thick paling in case of emergencies. It has since been reported that the police have effected a capture and that the next appearance will be before the magistrates who no doubt will give him his deserts.
