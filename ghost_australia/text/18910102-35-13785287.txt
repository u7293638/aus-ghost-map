ANCIENT EGYPT AT OXFORD- | MANSION. ^ , (Times, September 11.) Once upon a time there lived a lady whose name was Maker It is pleasant to suppose that she was young and bLUUtifuI, but as site dwi-ltinanob our little town on the borders of the 1? at um in Upper Egypt, some what about the time when the Children of Israel are believed to have made their way out of the land of bondage, and as no record of her features has survived, the question of her age and appearance is one of those union Sir Thomas Browne would have consigned to the limbo of unsolved problems Such mortal remains of her as have been found were unearthed by Mr Petrie a few months ago from a rock cue cedar under a house in Kahun, in which ancient town it will be remembered, was the scene of his most interesting explorations during the season of 1889 This town dates for the most part from the very remote period of the 12th Egyptian dynasty it sprang into existence as a workman's colony when the pyramid and memorial temple of lisortesen II were built, and being deserted when these works were completed, it was used as a cemetery by later generations brime few inhabitants would seem, however, to have lingered on until the 18th dynasty, when the last dwellings were abandoned bow, this rocks up to her must have been first of all occupied as a grave in the time of the 18th dynasty, and re- occupied for the same purpose about the end d of the 19th or the beginning of the 20th dynasty, the later mourners having apparently plundered the early mummies and decorated their own deceased with the spoils In this cellar, besides a variety of miscellaneous objects were found 12 large wooden coffins, each coffin containing the remains of six badly-embalmed mummies mostly fallen away to mere black dust Among those three score and odd personages it was not possible to distinguish the mortal remains of the lady Market, which, however, were found in the best pro served coffin of the sories, together with certain of her ornaments and personal possessions All those and many other things belonging to the rest of the un named dead, are sh town together on a large table in the centre of the right hand room at Oxford mansion, where Mr. Petrie holds his exhibition this autumn Here we see a small (golden scarab a silver scarab set in a ring, and a silver ring with square bezel, all engraved with the name of Market Here, too, are her hand neoUaoo", her earrings, her kohl pots, her bronze mirror, her toilet vases of blue" grey, and white lime- stone, and the wooden comb with which she combed her hair "JUOO years ago Nor must we overlook a small wooden box with sliding lid, containing a quantity of beads of peacock blue glass, so exceedingly small that they could only have been thread) d upon a fine human hair These are the most minute antique beads ever discovered, and weigh 63 to the grain Most interesting of all, however, are her two reed pipes, for the ladyJVIakot was a musician, and the pipes she loved were buried with her when who died these most ancient musical instruments have no mouthpieces, and measure 17ft in length, the one being out with three and the other with four holes T here give the intervals of the major common chord of 1) flat But the soul of Fair has so long been silent within them that they respond reluctantly to a breath of the fifth century, and have a strange- and far off sound, as bones mtiMo from the grave. A among the other very interesting objects with which this table is covered are some pieces of furniture, including a curious pointed head-rest in two pieces, and an almost perfect chair in black wood, with upright panelled back and legs with carved lion-feet. The two front legs are roughly restored in plain deal, the original having been purposely broken off at the time of burial for the Egyptians believed that things inanimate had also their personalities, and needed to be killed in order that their ghosts might accompany the ghosts of their owners to the lower world A walking staff of "trotted wood, -6ft. long, and a large curved " throw-slick," evidently belonged to some of the male occupants of three cellar-tomb A square bar of very nucient-lookmg wood, and a wooden measure, giving. the short debit of 17 sin , may have been the property of a master builder Here, too, may be soon a vase and dish of green paste, and a singular vessel of the same material in the form of a hollow horn open at both ends and closed at the base W a plug. Nor must we overlook among those larger L objects a beautiful little green jasper prism, exquisitely engraved on all four sides with the names and titles of Irishmen HE This gem of ancient lapidary art was found in a rubbish heap in a corner of the cellar The main history, at interest of this tomb, which was quiteundisturbed,and which Mr Petriecloaredwith his own hands of names, however in the pottery, which consists of Egyptian, Phoenician, and Greek ware, of other with Cypriote pilgrim bottles, decorated with concentric circles Very important chronologically is a pointed Greek jar, with a red ivy leaf pattern on a fawn-coloured (round, cloudy re enabling the ' Herz- blatt " design, found by Dr. Schliemann on Mycanra puttory Ima jar is dated by Mr. Penno at about 1500 June , which would correspond with the last years of the 19th of the earliest of the 20th Egyptian dynasty The remaining objects from Kahun, which represent in fact, the clearing of the one opened last year, fill the small room to the left, and stand really First in chronological order It in to this room that the visitor should first turn, after he has passed between the double row of solemn-looking mummy cases which line the entrance passage Home with some important exceptions, are objects very similar to those of the value room in last year's exhibition, such as copper i chisels, hatchets, knives, and fish hooks, wooden boxes, grain crops, plough-blades, matters, clubs, takes, dummies, the cats, spindles, whip tops, and the ike Upon the mantelshelf in this room are seen some remarkable fragments of wooden and stone columns from the private houses of Kahun. Up to the present time we have known little or nothing about the domestic architecture of this remote period, which, probably, did not materially differ from that of the 18th and 19th dynasties as we see it depleted in the wall paintings of many T Beban of rules, light wooden colon- sides being a leading feature. Hero, then for the first time, we see actual specimens of the wooden pillars with which the ancient Egg, plant gentleman adorned his dwelling-place. Whenan, however, the colon- and of the later period were mainly of the cluttered lotus order, those show the 12th dynasty chiefly reproduce the massive " Proto-Dono " style of the Bom-Human tombs Some have 16 flutings, some have eight ribs, and some are plain contains The large eight-sided fragment In the centre is of rich old brown wood, and mi ajurea 12in in diameter It was found in still upon a massive stone base The palm capital suspended above la of a lighter wood and surmounted a smaller pillar Those Kahlin houses appear to have been constructed with a small open inner court, or imitation is, supported on pillars, as in the Human dwellings of (classic lines, and it seems likely that this may have been the prevailing style in good Egyptian houses of the twelfth dynasty As Kahun was but a workman's colony, we may assume that these pillared house belonged to the chief architects and other officials concerned in the erection of the Pyramid and temple Here also, are some small pillar stands, or altars, such as are frequently depicted on funerary steal, when they are generally seen to be surmounted by libition jars or offering of cakes An interesting example of the economy with which these offerings were sometimes conducted may be seen on a shelf close by, which contains, among other objects in pottery, a table of offerings is baked clay, whereon the cakes, the launch, the call's head, and the bird piously devoted to the perpetual service of the mates are repres rented in relief in the same corner is a collection of a curious "sight, unglazed red dishes decorated as in rude anticipation of the Palfrey patterns, with incised designs of large flat fishes the fins and scales are carefully indicated and in one instat re 910 fish is combined with a lotuB pattern Am 1 r other noteworthy objects in this room are a my 1 ent circular dish and kalanthos-shaped cup of b used alabaster This banded alabaster is especially characteristic of the earlier dynasties, and was superseded later on by the clear and " honey waved " varieties In the wind JU races close by ara A collection of large clay seals many interesting scarabs and cylinders delicately engraved with the names and titles of ancient Kluge, a much-rotted leathern bag filled with a kind of not belonging to a tree which now grows only in Abyssinia, many fine flint implements, and two remarkable relics of the Ilyksos period-the one a wooden stamp 8in in length, cut with the name of Apepi in hieroglyphs, the other a small limestone bust of the unmistakable Hyksos type, having a flat broad face, high cheek bones, and a heavy wig, closely resembling that of the celebrated Sykes's bust found by Marietta at fell Mokhdam some 20 5 years ago A charming golden-brown mirror, set like a Bistrum in a leatherhead handle of carved wood, is remarkable in being probably the oldest representative of this goddess yet found, the earliest hitherto known being, if we remember rightly, the Harbor sculptures of the Temple of Day r-ol-Buhan, which date from the 18th di nasty Not less remarkable is a splendid wooden sickle with three small flint saws set in a groove, and cemented with Nile mud and blue. The form of this most ancient implement was evidently suggested to the primitive Egyptian by the jawbone of some large animal, and Mr Petrie, in order to emphasise this fact, has placed beside it the bleached jawbone of a calf found in the rubbish heaps of Kahun These rubbish heaps, by the way, have furnished Mr Petrie with some of his most curious objects, as, for example, with a quantity of potsherds of JEgean types, including black and will be incised ware, a horse's tooth, which carries back the history of the horse in Egypt to a much earlier date than has hitherto been received, and inter alia, a most quaint chioken-natoher m baked clay, with a groove for a sliding door and a roof perforated with air-boles Children's toys are very commonly found in ancient Egyptian grates, but we do not remember to have else- where seen any such little eley men and animals as The in close proximity to the chickon-batcher, nor would any but an ancient Egyptian child, we imagine, find pleasure in so grim a plaUhing as a miniature mummy in a miniature sarcophagus 'I he counting-stick, devised for the torment of these little ones, who were themselves mummified so many thousand years ago, is as great a curiosity as any in the room the numbers go from one to a hundred, and are punched in cumulative groups upon the surface of the board Leaving this room, one passes not merely along the small passage from door to door, but across a gulf of time wider than that which separates the baptism of Ethelbert from the jubilee of Victoria The Gurob room-except only the central table already described, and some Coptic relics to the left of the door- way- le occupied by domestic and other antiquities dating from the 18th to the 22nd dynasty The town now known as Tell Gurob was founded, like that of Kahun, on the edge of the desert, within a few miles of the earlier site. It was here that Mr Petrie last year discovered the grojternumberof those potsherds inscribed with Phoenician, Cypriot and archaic Greek alphabetic characters, of which we gave some account in our issue of September 16, 1889. Here also he found the relics and remains of those yellow-haired aliens, with names of Asiatic and European derivation, which formed so remarkable a feature of last year's exhibition These are the people whom Mr Petrie identified with the Mediterranean tribes who ruled Egypt in the fifth year of Rameses II, and of whom he finds evidence that they were expelled from Gurob by Merenp tah towards 'ho letter half of the 19th dynasty. Though not so rich in objects of this foreign type as last year, the Church <. flute" at the recent 5s ton include many of the so-called false-necked vases, pilgrim bottles of various patterns some flat, some globular, and notably, a vate of Asked type, all attributed by Mr Petrie to JEgean sources. A sling and an iron spear head in one of the window cases came from a tomb supposed to be that of a Canaa mercenary, while near by, is the case catalogued Illahun (iii dynasty), are three very curious pins, two of bronze and one of gold, such as are found only in Greek tombs of the pre-historic period. These pins, as Mr Petrie suggests, were probably used for fastening a dress through a button-hole, like a watch- guard swivel " They are at all events, thoroughly no Egyptian Still more foreign than their personal belongings was a custom which prevailed among these alien settlers at Gurob Although they embalmed and buried their dead according to requirements of Ega option law and in Egyptian fashion, they seem to have instituted a strange observance by way of substitute for the funeral pyre of their Western ancestors Under the floor, of the rooms in which it may be supposed that a death had taken place They dug a hole and there piled up and set fire to such articles as were the special property of the deceased poison, as mirrors, combs, nook lace, knives, cups and bowls, clothing, and even the chair conse stated to his or her daily use the floor, which had been taken up for this purpose, was then relaid Unless we can suppose that these objects were destroyed for sanitary reasons, we can only fall back upon the alternative that the custom was sacrificial. these groups of burnt objects are of great archaeological value, many of them being dated by Koa al names inscribed upon the ornaments or painted on the pottery. line, for instance, contains a nad necklace, with pendants of glazed ware, stamped with the cartouche of 1 utankhamen, an obscure one- sees or of Khuenaton (18th dynasty) , another includes two blue tubular vases, one inscribed with the Royal ovals of Rameses li , while a third gives us the name ofSetill on a steatite dish. Although Sergeant pottery was found in all these floor pits, the foreigners seem to have been fully alive to the beauty of the best Cgt p tion ware, all the finest fragments of decorated " blue washed " vessels to the present exhibition being derived from those sources. The designs, drawn with the usual masterly touch of the Egyptian case painter, represent gazelles, ducks, lotuses, winced sphinxes, and the like. One small bowl, black ened but not broken in the fire, represents a man and a monkey the man, an Asiatic, being in this case the property of the monks who compels his prisoner to dance at the end of a string while he sits at ease and marches a fig. This design adds another to the very few specimens of ancient Egyptian caricature which have survived the wreck of ages Since Sir Charles Nicholson discovered fragments of a bas-relief of the time of Khueniton so far north as Memphis, other relics of this heretic king have been found from time to time in various parts of Egypt, as, for instance, by Mariette at S ikkarah, thus showing that the cult of the disk was propagated throughout the lower region of the Nile Valley. the fragment now found by Mr. Petrie rebuilt into a tomb at Illahun is, we believe, the first yet brought from the Far) um, and it shows that there must have been a chapel of ICbnenaten somewhere in the vicinity It is therefore possible, though, perhaps, not very likely, that more blocks from the slime district may some day be forthcoming. In the present sculpture, Kbuenaten clasps one of his infant daughters, while overhead we see the " Aden," or sundial, with its rays terminating in human hands A male personage, of whom only the head and arms remain, Is in adoration below. The features of this man have been hacked away, but the head is abnormally long, and its form corresponds most strangely with that of a skull found by Mr. Petrie in one of the later rub bish heaps at the neighbouring town of Kahun. Some further trace of the transitory reign of the task-work ship may, perhaps, be detected in the lar ire limestone block which stands near by on the mantelshelf in this room. This, the most considerable piece of sculpture found at our ob, is a no less important historical object than the lines stone of the destroyed temple of Thothmea lil, the founder of this city. Here the name of Amen has been erased and plastered over, presumably by Khuenaten, the originator of the heretic cult. Later still, the name of the Theban deity has been read, thus marking that rat sent to the orthodox faith which took place under Tutankhamen It is from such scattered rolles as these that we must pain- fully gather up our materials when dealing with obscure epochs of Egyptian history For those who love beautiful carvings in wood, bone, and ivory, amulets in coloured glass pottery, and precious stones scarabs and statuettes of kings and goods, curious beads and head work earrings and bracelets fancifully designed to let objects and all the thousand-and-one minor at iniquities which form, after all, the most fascinating part of every Lgyptmn collection there is an abundant least in this Gurob room less attractive than these, but of solid historical! and topographical importance, is the large lime- stone slab engraved with a dedicatory inscription in honour of the Emperor Nero, which stands against the wall to the left of the visitor on entering and which shows the city of Ptolomaia the site of which has been hitherto unknown to have been situate in the t ay um 'this inscription, dated from the city of Ptolemaic A J CO, purports to be dedicated by that town at large, by the 6470," and by all who had reached the age of 18" in the second year of the Emperor Claudius AND 42 It is supposed that this inscription refers to an edict of Claudius, whereby a remission of taxes was granted to 6470 taxpayers of Ptolemaic, and to such other arizona as would become taxable within two years, and that this act of grace was afterwards confirmed by Nero The small middle room, besides some fine examples of Coptic textiles (A D COU) found by Mr Pole last year in the come- here at Illahun, contains the vacant results of Mr. Petrie's recent visit to Palestine To Residents of pottery, the fragmentary specimens of Amonte ware found in the ruins of Lachish will be especially interesting , but the fact that the Ottoman Government laid claim to all antiquities discovered in Syria is so disheartening that was only marvel how an explorer can be found to work under the conditions in a country where labour in both scarce and inefficient, and where he must live and travel literally, with his note-book in one hand and his revolver in the other
