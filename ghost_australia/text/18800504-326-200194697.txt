A " Ghost" Story. — A correspondent of the Geclontj Advertiser is responsible for the following "ghost" story : — "As I know you feel interested in such circum stances, I write, in case you' may not have heard it, to tell you of a very remark able circumstance connected with the death, at Hamilton, of the late Archdeacon Inncs. The archdeacon, as you know, died of diphtheria, and though perfectly sensible to the last, was unable to articu late a syllabic, and was, therefore, com pelled to have recourse to writing. This lends additional value to the circumstance which I have to tell you. For some months the archdeacon had been assisted as lay-reader by a young man recently ar rived from home named Lisserman, who, though not remarkable either for culture or natural ability, yet endeared himself to the archdeacon and all who knew him by his thoroughgoing earnestness and good ness. After working for a few months he fell a victim to prostrated energy, and died at the parsonage, at Hamilton, a few weeks before the archdeacon. Just before his death the archdeacon, who, as I told you, expressed all he had to say in writing, and was compos mentis to the last, wrote that going into his stiuty one evening, after Lisserman's death, he saw him standing at the study table, and involuntarily exclaimed "'Holloa! are you here !" "Yes," re plied the apparition, ' ' and where I now am there will you soon be !" Mr Innes was not a man of fancies, or of impaired physique ; and when he saw the apparition was in the enjoyment of robust health. These facts are well known and vouched for."
