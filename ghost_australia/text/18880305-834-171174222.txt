The Chinese. (To the Editor of the D. D. Gazette.) Sir, — Under tho above heading, in your contemporary of the 3rd., appears a letter signed E. W. Bradford, a greater lot of bosh I never previously read, and shouid imagine he must have entirely exhausted Mr. Johnson, to string together such a number of big words, the meaning of which, I do not suppose, without his dictionary at his elbow, he under stands himself. Really, your comtemporary must have been very hard up for news when it would find space for such immitigatod rubbish. One cannot help being amused at the style of the letter throughout, and I would allow it to go unnoticed, were it not for a reflection cast on the Australians as a body, and for which I can excuse him on the ground that he did not know what he was writing about. This young philosopher amongst other stupid remarks, adds — that something, (I am going to use plain language, and not his high flown words). The Chinaman is not a bad fellow, they say he does not drink, and therefore more moral than the Australian, who has a lament able tendency that way. The italics are mine, and are evidently the inferences of this Juvenile writer, who has omitted the brackets. Now sir,- I entirely dispute the fact that Australians as a rule are intemperate — it is far moreo the exception than the rule, and you as a native, who has seen double the summers of this young philosopher, can bear me out in this. As this young scribe appears to consider himself somebody, I would with your per mission, ask him if he ever heard the 'ghost illusion' and the specific — if not, here it is.
