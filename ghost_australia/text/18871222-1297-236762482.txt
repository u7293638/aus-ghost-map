MR. N. HAWKEN, M.P., EXPLAINS. TO THE EDITOR Off TEE DAILY TELEGRAPH. bir,— i our comment on my treatment ot tno 1 power exercised" motion last night .is characteristic. "Tho dismal fog," "giving up the ghost" and "feebly groaning" is worthy of you or unworthy — which ? As tncre was no Knowledge ot supreme Court action when the resolution was tabled that feature being introduced completely altered tho state of tbe case, as if the power was exercised illegally the danger to representative institutions would bo 'distant. It was only on the assumption that the power was legally exercised that the motion was important to mo or to the country. As I bclioved my motives to be miBundorstood with regard to my object in tabling the motion, I deemed it right before withdrawal to say that the motion was not intended to censure any person or in the interest of any party, but in that of tho representatives of the country only. The resolution itself will await developments and will keep without spoiling. — Yours, die., December 21. N. HAWKEN.
