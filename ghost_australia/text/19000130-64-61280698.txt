THE AGENT-GEK ERAL. Sir Julian Salomons is going to reejgn the position of Agent-General and come back to Sjdney. And a good job too. It may be he is making a virtue of necfSiity. At any rate, there was not the ghorfc of a chance of his being reappointed. Ia conver- sation on Friday with a promineat citizen on the subject, he expressed the opinion that giving the Agent-Generalship to Sir Julian was a gross job. The latter had intended going to England on private business, and Mr. Reid seemed to believe that Sir Julian could attend to that, and also run the Agent-General's office. It bas been a profitable thing to this wide-awkke lawyer, for his expenses to England were paid by the State ; he was also given a salary at the rate of about Â£2200 a year, and his expenses back to the colony are likewise to come ont of the Treasury coffers No one, I think, can truthfully affirm that during the twelve months he has bees Agent- General he has done much for New South Wales ; it is certain that be has not given value for the money that has been paid to him. Parenthetically, it may be remarked that during his abates ce Mr. Reid has occupied his chambers in Sydney. Speaking at Kiama on Thursday, the Minister for Mines said that it was the intention of the Government to appoint a General Agent-which is a different functionary from an Agent-Genera!-in Sir Julian Salomons' place. That should have been done years ago. Having cable communication with England, a quaei-ambassador is not needed there by New South Wales ; but a smart up-to- date business man who at the same time would be able to hold up our end of Australia on the platform and in the press, is much required. A man who will concern himself more about the profitable disposal of our products than with swell dinners or fashion- able entertainments. It should be practicable to get such a man.
