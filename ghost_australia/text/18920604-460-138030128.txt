After some episodes in a gipsy camp and some scenes with a comic doctor and a comic doctor's boy, Nat Aston, the pretended Lord Fairfield, is shot in a struggle with Bracewell. Dovel also gets his deserts, Mabel and Bracewell are happily reunited] and all ends as pleasantly as the somewhat depressing surroundings will admit of. Mr. E. Ilolloway has the best part, that of the farmer, which he ploys with earnestness anl feeling, and he ia well seconded by Miss Lih Dampier as Mabel. Mr. It. Vernon as Dovel ia a good robustious villain, and Mr. A. Rolfe as Nat Aston is a plausible smooth villain. The other parts are filled by Messrs. J. H. Martin, Frank Hawthorn, K. Reid, E. Palmer, Misses May Renno, C. liil ton, J. Merton, H. Nugent, and Rose Dampier. A new Irish drama will )>e played this evening. The week's programme at the Bijou Theatre has consisted of the revival of Jerome K. Jerome's pretty one-act play of "Barbara," and of Sydney Grundy's clever three-act play of "A Pair of Spectacles." In the first-mentioned piece, the charm of the production is exceedingly well sustained by Mrs. Brough, who represents the self sacrificing girl who conceals her right to her newly-found brother's inheritance in order that he may be happy with the girl of his choice. Miss Gibson hits off the girlish cha racter of Lillie very well; and Mr. Chichester and Mr. Cannam are effective re presentatives of Cecil and Dr. Finnicum. In the second piece the two principal characters are the brothers Benjamin and Gregory Gold finch, whose vivid contrast of character is ex cellently presented by Mr. Brough and Mr. Fabert. Benjamin is genial, generous, and confiding to a fault. Gregory, a Sheffield manufacturer, is as hard as a nail; besides being a vulgarian, he starves his own son, believes nothing that he does not see, and trusts no one. Accompanying Benjamin on an errand of charity, he contrives to show that the person seeking relief is an impostor. Then Ben jamin loses his spectacles, and being obliged to use those of his brother his views of life become jaundiced, and he is a changed man, being not only imbued with the suspicions of his brother, but acquiring some of his tricks of speech and manner. ln a time of apparent financial disaster, however, he is so touched by the evidences of self-sacrificing efforts made on his behalf that he recovers his former good nature; and even Gregory admits, in view of the results of his system, that he has carried his principles too far. Mr. Brough shows great skill in the manage ment of his part, gliding from one nature into the other almost imperceptibly, and there are some touches of genuine pathos as well as of humour in it. Mr. Fabert's per formance of Gregory does not possess the humour which Mr. Anson imparted to it, but it is clever and consistent portraiture of undoubted strength, it is natural to suppose that such a person would have no finer sense of humour than Marley's Ghost. Mrs. Benjamin Goldfinch is very agreeably played Mrs. Brough; the two nephews are efficiently represented by Mr. Ward and Mr. Chichester; and Miss Gibson makes a pre sentable Lucy Lorimer. Last Saturday at this theatre was a compositors' or chapel night, when the whole of the amphitheatre and family circle were occupied by the craft, for the benefit of a sick member. The farcical comedy, "New Lamps for Old," is announced for this evening.
