THE SUSSEX MATCH. After their victory at Oxford the Australians re- <*> turned to London, where they stayed for the night, and on Thursday morning left for Brighton, where they met a strong team of Sussex players, Great. prepatations bad teen made for the match, and 34 visitors were besxnnicg to arrive for the season at tlic fashionable waUring place, a large attendance was anticipated. On tteir arrival the Australian? took quarters at the Rose!, <meof the best appointed bottle in BriptttU. It ooccpSea a commanding position on the biplanadeand is quite .dose to the sea, so that the Australians were enabled to get a "Miiffcf the brwyI'by simply ope?ioctbiiirwindowj. On my arrival iv Brighton I f-trolled along the pro menade, and was pleased to notice the Australian Eag flying at the tt)yal. I tunpose. however, the majority cf those who saw it did not know wbu the colors were. Brighton is a favorite plan with the cricketers, and tney would gladly have prolonged their st&y; if possible. Several Australian gentle men took a run down from London to see their conntrymtn, and amongst them 1 noticed Mr. Gtleb Peacock. Shortly after 11 o'clock the Australians drove to the ground, whcrealargegatheringawaited their arrival. Vrerians to the notch commenting tbc colonists indulged in some tail hitting, just to loosen their joints a Lit, and yon "golden opinions from all sorts of men" by the manner in which they bandied the willow. Su-sex has long been a noted cricketing county, and when a ?" foreign** team pl&ya; Uiete they may reckon on being criticised pretty game. *""? Ainjr>a;jfn;? th^r?.f^ n . j m a j fft ng ril^|l^Ft themselves upon producing such a favorable iamrez sicn upon tl.e Sussex cricketing community. The fixe weather which prevailed dnxing the Oxford luatch still beld up, and on Thursday, whaa tbi Australians took ilia field, the son was shining brightly, bis rays being tempered by a cool Viretze—weather not unlike Chat in Sep tember in Adelaide. The teitn was the same as that which played at Oxford, with the exception tk&t; Horan was substituted for Boyle. Sassex having, wen the toss detailed to go in, and Murdoch*^ connttfancc darkened a little as he looked at tha perfect wicket and thought what he had lost. He was not long, however, in getting bis men in the field, *nd Lllis and Greenfield, the first representa tives of Sussex, took their positions atttte wickete to the Lowling of Palmer and Spofforth- Both commenced ??qu?ting*' the bowlers, and the crowd smiled as 10 and then SO went up. It certainly did seem as if they meant bu mess when they hit same of the best balls through the chains. " They'll make about two hundred," said a gentleman in the pavilion, and bis estimate was supposed to be rather under than over the mark. As the bowlers wanned to their work, however, a change began to coin* over the spirit <>f tLe scene, and BlacUisun sooa. ?mapped Ellis off Palmer. Whitfeld stepped into the "imminent, deadly breach," and after matdn; a few rans saw Greenfield well taken by Giffen off Snofiorth. Two good wickets gone for 40, and Sussex not quite happy. The Australians were rapidly getting into lorni, and their bowling and fielding were magnificent. Palmer got on tho spot, and kept on it, and although he was bit, so well was he backed up by the field that it was almost impossible to get runs off him. Spofforth also was ably seconding Palmer's efforts, though the wicket did not turt fciin, Three wickets fell for 4(i, and the score was teen raised to 61, Wbitneld said Bettesworth lreing the agents. The latter pat. a Tall from Spofforth into Hotan's bands at sup, tiid "Tommy held it. Wbicueld got his quietus with Uie tirMlialicf Palmer's next over—s for 63— ir.?l Blackican, a man said to possess a strong defence, toot the vacant wicket. He mast hue forgotten his defence on this occasion, as he go; the ?'?le£thntUle" frum Palmer's fir.it. SixforoJ. l.ueas followed, and shared a .similar [ate. b'svea fcre3. One of Uie '-gods'* suggested sending in two men at once, so as to pave time. The remiining batsmen brought the total np to 95, Humphrey's scoring iS.and the veteranllllju-hiteS.notout. For the Susses eleven to hive gone out for 95 on a bits man's wicket seems incredible, and this is the best. testimony of the excellence of the bowling. la fielding one or two mistakes were made, Maasic an! Jones both miKang vox? y^tz-lifH, Giffin was quite himself in the long-field, and was frequently ap plauded for his smartness. Altogether beusbipin; as well as any man in the team, and I anticipate hu returning to Sooth Australia with "blushing honors thick upon him." Ice dock showed twenty minutes past 3 when the last Susser wicket fell, and at twenty- five miming to t the Australians began their innings, Bannennan ?thj Massie being the first representatives, the former taking strike and sending the first ball through the chains for 4. Both batsmen seemed to understind the bowling from the first, and scored off nearly every over. Ma-ssie began in bis usual ngoronj style, and treated the spectators to some grand hitting. The score of the Sussex team was just headed when Massie skied one from BUckman, and Eettesworth being about effected a good catch. One for 96. Ihe tcore of the retiring batsman, 45, ivas coDipQcd in forty minutes. Prtvijus to the fall of tke xricket Murdoch went into the field, and ob jected to Elackmans bowling, bat tile umpire would sot entertain the objection. To me it looted remarkably like a throw, anl many on the ground maintained its unfairnessl. Murdoch took Massie's place, and at once proceeded to business, repeatedly rending the ball through the chains. Viiea the score bad been raised to 127, Bannennan, who had been getting bis rons rapidly, was splendidly taken by Trevor at mid-rn. The veteran Horan next ap peared, and broke his "duck" the first over,aad almost immediately ufter pot one under the ropes for i. Murdcch was cow tlioronghly set, and pTiyei everjthing like a bou!r.
