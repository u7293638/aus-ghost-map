Laying a Ghost. A New Haven despatch to a New York paper says:-" In the Roman Catholic ceme tery in Birmingham, early on the morning of tlhe 18th ult., four middle.aged women and two men-the latter armed with spades and picks-entered by the side gate and halted in front of a newly-made grave. The men set to woik, while the women wept, and opened the grave and hauled a coffin up. The lid was taken off, and the remains of a beauliful young girl were revealed. She was the daughter of one of the women, and the mother shri-ked loudly when she saw the corpse. The men stood aside, and the four women bent over the coffin, and deft fingers went rapidly through the dead girl's hair and shroud, and all the pins that could be found on the remains were removed. Then a needle and thread were procured, and the shroud and hair sewn back into their places. The lid was lten screwed back on the coffin, and the remains were again lowered into the grave, which was at once filled up. It was learned that the women were of a very superstitious nalure, and that Ithy believed that if a corpse was buried with the shroud pinned up instead of sewed, the soul would be confined to the grave for eternity, and the persons guilty of the mistake would be haunted until death by the ghost of the victim. A mistake was made in this case, and one of the women claimed that she had seen the ghost lor two or three nights successively, and she could stand it no longer; so she got the other women together, and between them they hired the men to disinter the body. The ghost has not been seen since."
