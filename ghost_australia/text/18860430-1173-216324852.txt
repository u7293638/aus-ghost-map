LOrAL HAMLEY LODGE' PIC-NIC AND SPORTS. The annual pic-nic and sports in con nection with the above named Lodge were held on Easter Monday. The weather was all that could be desired, and a large concourse of people were present. The Brethren met at the lodge room, and shortly after half past 11 o'clock marched around East Moonta, headed by Bargwanna's Band. Arriving at East Moonta Race Course, three hearty cheers were given for the Queen, and after the band had played the National Anthem the procession broke up, and at 1.30 the sports committee commenced their duties, and were successful in getting off all the events but one, viz., the bycicle race, sufficient number of cyclists not having put in an appearance. The tea, which was an excellent one,, provided by Mr. F. Michell, was held in a booth on the ground, and was well' patronised by the public. A grand instrumental, vocal : and dramatic entertainment was given at- the East Moonta, Temperance- Hall 'in the evening to a crowded and appreciative audience. After opening .with a selection by Messrs Prisk (organ), Blee (violin), and Woolcock (cornet), the. secretary, P.G. William Hollands, read the annual report of the Lodge, which was shown to be in a very flourishing condition, having commenced the year with 103 members good on the books, whom they still retain, and having admitted 11 new members during the year making their total membership at this date 114, with a total worth of funds of £975, showing a financial gain of about £20. This is a comparatively small gain, caused by the sick pay being more than on previous years, but the money has been spent in serving the great end for which it was contributed, tnd for which the grand old society was established. Following this report were songs by Messrs R. Roberts and T. Trembath, and a drama entitled, " Sold again," in which the parts were creditably sua. tained by Messrs W. H. Wearne, Joseph Slee, A. Trembath, P.G. William Harvey, and Bros. S. J. Hand and R. Roberts, songs from Messrs S. J. Hand and A. Trembath, and a duet, " Money Matters " by Miss Goldsworthv and Mr. T. Trembath brought the entertainment to a close. After an interval of five minutes, Messrs Prisk, Woolcock and Blee, again delighted the audience with a 'selection, which was followed by songs by Miss Goldsworthy and Mr. T. Trembath, i and the last, but not least, was an amusing farce " Paddy Miles," in which all who jtuok part, viz., a Bros. R. Roberts, S. J. Hand, P.<i. ! W. Harvey and Messrs Joseph Slee, W. H. Wearne, A. Trembath and J. Bertles were deservedly applauded ; R, Roberts as Paddy himself being exceptionally good. After a vote of thanks to all who, had in any way helped to- make theanniversary a success, a very enjoyable, festival was brought to a close .by singing th<* National Anthem.
