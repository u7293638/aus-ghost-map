Lett, in the systemsr of the world, for ' 'There 4s light, in all, and light, with more or less of shade, in all man-modes of worship; 'and in his. effort to ' alchemise old hates into the gold of Love' he builds a temple ' neither Paged, Mosque, -nor Church, but loftier, simpler, always open-door'd to every breath from heaven.' .Even as he dreams ruin overtakes this creedless temple of his imagining, but From out the sunset poured an alien race ' Who fitted stone to stone again, and Truth, Peace, Love, and Justice came and dwelt therein. ' Nor in the field without were seen or heard - -~ Fires of Suttee, nor wail of baby wife 'Or Tnriinn widow, and in sleep I said ' All praise to AJla by whatever hands Mv missiop be accomplished but we hear Music : our palace is awake, and thorn Has lifted the dark eyelash of the Night From off the rosy cheek of waking Day. In ' St Telemachus ' we get a legend founded on the suppression by the Emperor Honorius of the gladiatorial contests. The saint is a recluse who, visiting Rome and entering the Colosseum, leapt down among the Combatants to stop the fighting ; at which remonstrance the enraged populace stoned the saint, whereupon Honorius interdicted the contests, and Telemachus's act became a deed that woke the world.' Some thing that will strike the reader with a greater sense of familiarity is an echo 'of ' The Northern JEarmer,' in the. shape of .a dryly humorous bit_ called 'The Curate and the Churchwardei.' The churchwarden 'was- once a Baptist, as he says — For I wur a Baptis wonst, sin' agean the taithe an' the raate, Till I fun that it warn't not the gaainist waay to the narra Gate. ; Aii' I can't abear 'em, I can't, fur a lot bp 'em coom'd \- ta-year — - ' J, Twar down wi' the rheumatic then— to viy . pond to wesb thessens theere — ' ' Sa I sticks like the Ivin as long as I lives to the owd Church nsw, Fjr they werii'd their -sirn i' my pond, an' I doubts they poison'd the cow. the curate was his old-parson's lad, to whom ; he is under an obligation; to give sound advice : — An' thou'll be 'is Curate 'ere, -bat, if iver tha means to git ,1/ ?igher, . ? , ^ ' -? Tl:a inun tackle the sins o'-. the Wo'ld. an' not the faults 6' , the Squire, An' I reckons tha'll lightof a llvin' somewheers i' the Wowd. or th'e.Fea, ' If t'ia cotiuns down to thy betters, an' keeaps thysen to thysen. . Lpt nivor not sfeak plaain out, -if tha wantfi to git fonards ' ' a bit. m Bat' creeap along the hedge- bottoms,'' and thou'll be a \ Pishop yit. i These four are -the most noticeable poems in the *' volume, but'- among the briefer effoite we get .man a subtle touch of the old chafjra. In ' ' f ^M^chanophilus ' we meet with such parages as this:— , - As we surpass our father's skill '... Our sons will shame our own ; . ? A thousand things :are hidden still \- -i- '.' '. ?, And not a hundred known ; and lines like these, from ' Poets and Critics,' seem to embody the results of personal experi 'fen^: — ' . - . ''*? Sing thou low, or lo-jd. -ft sweet, , - : - At all points th m canst not meet, ' ' . .. Some will pass and some will pause. . 'What is true at last will tell : v ' Few atiflrst will place thee well ; ;? Some too low would have 'thee shine, -. Some too high— no fault of 'thine— Hold thine own, and work thy will ! ' . Tear will graze the heel ot year, But seldom' comcs the 'poet here, '.. 7 And the critic's rarer stil. In. a' poem called 4 ' The Dreamer ' there are ' echoes of a tone- which made itself heard in the j late Laureate's earlier strains, as when he makes a . i ^ Voice' of the; Ikrth~'~ express itself in this ^ 4 wise'jT— : r-]'S ? r iam losing thelightofmy youth ' '? ' ' Arid the «si6n'thafled merorold, '' And I clash with an iron truth ?? * ' When I make for au age of gold, . ' * And l would that my race were ran. For teaming with liars, and madmen, .and knaves,'; ? ' / - And wearied of autocrits, anarchs, and slaves, . . ; And darken'd with doubts of a faith that Fave.s, ? And crimson with battles and hollow with graves, ' To tie wail of my winds, and the moan of my wave3 , . I whirl, and I follow the sun. ; Yet another echo of the spirit of the scientific movement of the age is to be found in some verses^ bearing the title ' The Making of Man.' There is,- perhaps, no more interesting study in con- - nectlon.' with the perusal of Tennyson than to note ?the ways and means he has of giving expression to-the popnlar impressions which each successive; ^advance 'of scientific discovery or ^speculation 'leaves after it. ' Locksley Hall' was full of - such echoes, but there is hardly anything that is \- /quite so definite as this : — » ' ? ?:'Where if one that, barn of woman altogether can escape , 'From the lower world within him, 'moods of tiger, orof , 1'- - -'ape ? ' \S Man a3 yet is being 'made; and ere the crowning Age of. . ages, ? ? _ ; '. ' Shall not £B3n aftta- seon pass and toach him into shape ?- The idea underlying these lines repeats itself ^an' the volumb more than once,' as. for example* in ; this extract from ' The Dawn — - : Bed Of the Dawn ! & Is it turning a faintei- red ? so be it, but when'shall we lay The Ghost of the Briit« that is walking and haunting us yet, and be free ? . . | ' - Xn a - hundred, a thousand winters t Ah, what Jtrill our 1 ? .. children be, ' The men of a hundred thousand, a million summers away? A poem called 'Charity ' has more strength ; in it than most of the poems in this book, which ! will not add much on the whole to the poet's re putation. The dedication, to an unnamed ^friend, ! is worth quoting : — There on the top of the down, ; ; j The wild heather round me,- and over me June's high blue, ' When I loolt'd at tbe bracken so bright and the heather 6o brown,' I thought to myself I would offer this book to y Ju,' This and my love together, - ' To you that are seventy-seven, 'With a faith as clear as the heights of the June -blue ' ' heaven, And a.fancy as eummerrliew :? ?As the - .green -of the br.cken amid the gloom of the'-' ' heather. . . . . ' The main interest of the ' vplume, however, will ; consist in the fact that itis the last from Tenny ^spp's pen, -and in thfe s^rit some lines from ' t&The; ^apdpr^r ' hare , a touch of valedictory patho^ * wi^ejtjtojp^et addresses those about him ' V^be'Maftp.of household sunshine ends, /j AMTCienoiong^canl rest ; ; Farewell !—you wfll not speok. my friends, 'Unfriendly of ybiu- parted guest. ,? I count you kind, I hold you true ; ?» ? -ftit what fnav -follow who can tell ? Give'-tne a hand— and 3'ou— and you—1 ' ' * ^ And.deeni me gratetul, and farewel '! ' - '? The telephone is an arrangement by which two men ' can lie to each other without becoming confused.
