THE S.A J.H. MERTIKa. [From our Special .Reporter. 1 Fleminsrton. Mav 12. The Jockey Club Meeting ended to-day. The weather was beautiful, and there was a good attendance, including a number of ladies. Lady Kobinaoa and Miss Robinson were present. Jttacing began with the izardle Race, andas Old Soul and Chats worth, who were heavily backed in the doubles the night before, W6re withdrawn on the course, there were only five left to compete. Minerva and Echo were about equal favourites, and after a grand race the latter won, but it was only Corrigan's line riding that enabled him to gain a narrow verdict over Tattler. A fine field weighed for the- Ladies' Bracelet, and after Remus had been installed favourite heavy commission was thrown into the market for Lantern, and he settled down in better demand than the two-year old. The race was run at a cracking pace, and the heavy weights retiring before reaching the distance, a slashing race ho-ue took place between Venus and East Lynne, the two year-old winning through sheer gameness by half a neck. The steeplechase dwindled down to three runners, andColebrook, a very handsome horse from Ballarat, was made a hot favourite. The three jumped ia most faultless manner, and after getting over the last fence Colebrook assumed com mand, and won rather easily from Songster. Only five put in an ap pearance for the Charity Plate, and Titania bolting and throwing the rider the field was reduced to four. Surprise was backed down to 5 to 4, but after showing great pace be threw it up in the straight, and First Pop won easily. In presenting the Ladies' Bracelet to Mr. Cook Lady Robinson re marked that next year she hoped to have the pleasure of making the presentation in Adelaide. The meeting wound up with the S.A.J.C. Handicap, for which twenty went to the post, and so open was the race re garded that 6's and 7's to 1 were laid on the field till the flag fell. The result was a sur prise, as St. John came away at the home turn and won easily from Britisher and St. Lawrence. * S.A..I C. HANDICAP.
