A Drover's Diary. BY ONE OF THEM. May 9 St Lawrence Why Saint Lawrence?

-M e camped at the foot of the range (Connors Range) last night, and I took adv au tale of a full-or almost full moon to take the bull up during the small hours of the morning, so as to get all hands at the cattle, for the Connor s Range is pretty stiff for anything to go up I had often read how people, looking over a large extent of level country from the top of a high mountain, were impressed by a sense of dim mysterious vastness, of seeing before them an outspread area of apparently limitless extent, as boundaries fading into impenetrable gloom and shadow, that made a man feel his utter in- significance, the Hat mg all this in my memory, I naturally expected that when I reached the top of the range, at about half- past three in the morning, I should experience some of these feelings It was a mist liked did t I lingered on the summit before descending, and tried to start them, but couldn't I looked down at the forest stretching away to the sea, at the ' sea fog landward hound" that was creeping up, and bringing a misty, drizzling rain with it, at the range running away northward, its. highest peaks enveloped in vapoury clouds, and wreaths of mat like gigantic white ghosts stealing up its base from out the valleys But no sense of awe crept over me I felt mad I flattered myself that I had a soul above buttons, and that a scene like the one I was looking at should develop the higher sensibilities of that soul, and that, like Simon Tuppcrtits grinding, "something would come if it, but nothing came, all I could think of was-bed, how I should like to be able to turn into a comfortable bed, and not have to wake up with cattle on the mind any more I saw one pretty sight afterwards when we were about two thirds of the way up with the cattle The morning, was net and
