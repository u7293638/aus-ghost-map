Tiro upper part of hias :,22, was concealed by a mask, his eyes : gTaming through th o)r~holce iu it, His " shirt aleeves were rolled up, and in one hand he carried a long, old faseioned pistol. The women fled screaming from -the room, and when Mr. Jenniugs came in five minutes later he found no one in the parlour and all the doors and windows securely looked. Wh~at was it the women saw ? " During a recent period of ill health," writes an American frend, " I had slept Sbidly for several successive nights. Un the fourth of thess nights about two o'clook, I. was suddenly aroused from a doze by what seemed hlike the calling of my name; and at the foot of the bed stood the image of my mother just as abshe looked fivly years before, as she was leaving home to go on a journey, on which lourney she was killed in a railway disaster. I screamed and fainted. I was foolish enough to tell of it, and the local old Swomen gossips said it was a summons and' I would never get well, Yet I did, and am in perfeot health now, I believe- that vilson came of my weak nerves, for l've neverseen it snc, and it's more that Sthree years ago now," No doubt it -was the nervee.

By-and bye I had to lie helpless in bed. The doctor said he didn't know what my complaint was. I took nothing but liquid food, and could not retain oven that on myÂ·'..etomah. By.thie time I was nothing but skin and bone, My memory coompletely failed, My head aohed so dreadfully I thought I should lose my senses, and my friends fgreed that I would never got better, "I had given up all hope/ when one day Mrs West of lJournemouth, oalled and asked what I was tklis'. bho told me she was herself onco lust as badly off, and was . outed by hMothor Seigol'e Curative Syrup.
