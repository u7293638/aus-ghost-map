DONAT USANT.' BY GEORGE MACDONALD. Author of "Alec Forbes," " Malcolm," &c.;, c. CHAPTER. XXI. ONE stormy night in the month of March, when a bitter east wind was blowing, Donal, seated at the plain deal table which he had got Mrs Brookes to find for him in the house, that he might use it is he pleased, regardless of the overflow of ink 01 other possible injury, was drawing; upon it a diagram, in the hope of finding a simplification of some geometrical dim cutty for David, when a sudden sense of cold made him cast a glance at his age He had been aware that it was sinking, but, delaying because there was no fuel in the room, had, in the absorption of his work, forgotten it It was now very low, and he must go at once upon the roof to fetch from his store both wood and coal In certain directions of the wind this was a rather ticklish task, but he had taken the precaution of putting up here and there a handful of rope. He closed the door behind him to keep in what warmth he might and, ascending the stairs to another door a few feet higher, stepped out on the flat that ran along the thickness of the wall, with the roof on one side and a small parapet on the other, and stood for a moment to look around him It was a moonlit night, so far as the clouds, blown in huge and almost continuous masses over the heavens, would permit the light of the moon to issue The roaring of the sea came like a low rolling mist across the flats, The air gloomed and darkened and lightened again around him as the folds of the cloud blanket overhead were torn or dropped it ailing 01 gathered again in the arms of the hurrying wind As he stood, the wind seemed suddenly to change, and take a touch of south in its blowing The same instant came to his car a loud w ad of the ghost music haunting the house, 'There was in it the cry of a discord, mingling with a wild rolling" ch range of harmonies He stood like one for bad," and listened with all his power It came again, and again, and more continuously than he had never heard it before Now there was indeed some chance of following the sound, he thought hunting it with the ear ' As a gaze hound with his eyes, and a sleuth hound with his nose, he stood ready to start hunting with his listing listening car And now he came almost to the conclusion that the seeming approach and recession of the sounds was occasioned only by changes in their strength, not by any alteration of the position of their source land Donal ever in his life Scaddan coltan harp, he would have thought of it now "Surely it must be something on the roof '" he said, and, throwing down the pen he had brought for his fuel and forgetting the dying fire in his room, he got down on his hands and knees, blot to escape the wind in his ears, and next to diminish its hold on his person, he crept away over roof after year like a cat, stopping every moment a new gush of the sound came, to determine what direction it was from, and then stir ring once more in the chase of it is on a great either ing of roofs like those of the castle, elected at various times on vin ions levels, and with all kinds of architectural accommodations of one part to another, sound would be constantly de affected and there would be as many difficulties in tracing the sound as inside the house But he persevered, aware of neither cold nor danger, as he crept now up, now down, now over flat roads, however sloping states of great roofing stones, now alon" low parapets, and now round ticklish corner following the sound over, as a cat might a flitting unconscious bud When the sound ceased he would keep slowly on-his best Movement was but slow in the direction he had last chosen Sometimes when the moon was more pt soundly obscured he had to stop altogether where he was, unable to get a peep of his course beyond At one such moment when it became unto all but quite dark and the sound had not come for a time, he had to stop in a half crouching position upon a Bill pitched roof of great st lbs, his fingers clutched around edges of the stone and his mount incoming h ibits standing him in good stead but protected a little from the full force of the blast by a huge stack of chimneys that lose to windward of him While he clung thus and waited, once more, clouded than he had yet hear d it almost it seemed in his cry, ear, or nose the musical ghost to-the city this time almost as of a soul in the time the moon came out as at the call to see but there was nothing for Don is to see nothing to suggest a possible origin of the sound As if disappointed, the moon instantly withdrew, the darkness again fell and the wind rushed upon him stronger than ever With that came the keen slanting I am, the! mg Jura as if with fierce intent of protecting the secret, and plainly there was little chance of success that night. He must put off the boat till daylight If there with any material factor in the sound be must be better able to discover it in the daylight By the great chimney stack he could identify the spot where he had been nearest to it there remained for the present but the task, perhaps a difficult one, of finding his vv ly back to us towel And difficult it was consider ably more difficult than he had anticipated He had not an idea in which direction his towel lay-had not even an idea left of thousand , if tracks could be called by which he had come One thing only was element was somewhere else than where he was He left the place, therefore, and, like any other honest pilgrim who knows he must go somewhere else, began his wanderings But on his backward way he seemed to be of a more obst acted than on his way thither Again and again he could get no further in the direction he was trying again and again he had to turn and in another way It was half an hour at least before he came to a spot which he knew But by this time with the a in the wind had fallen, and he was in less difficulty He caught at length the outline of one of the sheds in which lay his stores, and from that his way was plain He caught up his part, killed at firm to-day with coal and wood and hastened to his nest as fast as rather stiffened joints would carry him, though with little hope indeed of finding his fire still in life and capable of recovery But when he stepped from the roof on to the state, and had gone down a few steps, a strange sight indeed was there waiting turn Below him on the stand, just outside his door, with a small dim wax taper in its hand, stood the form of a woman Pla ml), from the position of her hand and her head, she had just knocked, and was heard selling for an answer So intent was she and so loud still was the wind among the roofs, that she did not hear Donal s step above her For the first moment he was afraid to speak lest he should startle her- whoever it was-with a voice from an unexpected quarter, but presently the figure knocked again, and then he felt he must speak, his voice would startle less than his approach from behind her He made, however, a pardonable attempt at ventriloquist, saying with a voice intended to sound further away than it was, "Come in" The hand sought r handle, searched and found the latch, and opened the door As she did so, the light fell on her face, and Donal saw that at was Lady Arctura Then he spoke " I will be with you immediate!), my lad)," he said, and, descending, entered the room after her-a pleasant object to behold after his drawling excursion in wind and rain on the roof She started a little at bearing the voice behind her, and, turning, gazed on him with a slight shadow of dismay Donal was more like a sweep returning from his work than a tutor in a lord's castle, and he bore in his hand. a painful of coals Catching at once the meaning of her look, he made haste to explain, though in truth he had more cause to be surprised at her presence than she at his appearance "I have been out on the roof for the last hour and a half, ' he said "What were you doing there if I may ask' she said, with a strange mingling of expressions on her countenance, and in such a night * ' "I heard the music, my lady-the ghost music, you know, that they say haunts the castle-and-' " I heard it too," she said, almost under her breath, and with a look almost of terror ' I have often heard it before, but I think never so loud as to- night Have you any idea about it, Mr (Grant "None whatever, except that I am now nearly sure the source of it is somewhere about the roof " " I should be very glad if you could clear up the mystery " "I have some hope of doing so But you are not frightened ray lady ' he asked, seeing her catching hold of the lack of a chair, as if ready to sink "Do sit down," he continued, placing a chair for her, 'I will get you some water "Jso, no, I shall be all right in a moment," she answered "Your stair has taken my breath away and then my uncle is in such a strange condition That is why I came to you " "You need hardly be much disturbed by that for you must have often seen him so before ' 3 [The sole right of publication in Queensland of "Donal Grant has been purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company, Limited.

At times not, I suppose " " Would you come with me'" " Any w hen it " "Come then, she said, and leaving the room led the way, by the light of her little taper, down the stair About halfway she stopped at a door, and turning said, with a smile like that of a child and perhaps the best untroubled look Donal had yet been upon her face- How delightful it is to he free of i ora fear I am not the least afraid now you are with me " ' That makes me very glad," said Donal "I should like to kill fear-only by killing Wrong though feat is but the shadow that always follows at the heels of W.rong By the way do you think the music his any thing to do with your uncle's condition ' ' I do not know , I have sometimes thought it hid But it is difficult to be sure about anything She turned again hastily, and, entering a part of the castle with which Doing had no acquaintance, le I am, often in my new idea nig turns on to the great staircase, down which she continued her com as usual be" in to wonder what time of the night it could be, the house was all so still nobody seemed awake in it.

She led him to the room on the stairs where first be had seen the cart There was no light in it Across the near end of it she led him, is he had himself gone once before, through a door round the edge of its back wall under the ascending spiral of the war, and into the little chamber behind, which seemed a cut oiF and forgotten corner As he entered it he heard for one moment the murmuring of a voice, he thought, but immediately it was gone and the deepest silence filled the world One step within the door At cura stood still, turned her head towards Donal, and held high the taper But she looked only at Donal, and not in the direction she wanted him to look the feeble light fell on the form of the east A small box stood against the foot of the will opposite the door on the box, in a long dressing gown of a well faded stuff, the silk and (gold in which shone in the dim light stood the tall meagre form, with its back to the door to face to the wall, close to it, immovable, and its aims and hands stretched out on the wall like one on the cross He stood without shifting of mo\ nig i muscle, of utter in a sound What could it mean Donal gazed in a blank dismay Not a minute passed, but he thought it a long and painful time when the min during came again Donal listened as to a voice from another world tiling terrible to those whose fear dwells in mother world. But this to Donal was tremble as no voice from the world of the departed could have been this was a voice from a world of sin and suffering a world the notation of the eternal, a world of dai knew md the shadow of death Yet surely there was some hope even in the form in which the indwelling despair made itself audible The words were these Don ii could not help afterwards doubting whether he had indeed 1 card them 'And we indeed justly , for we receive the due reward of our deeds , but this man hath done nothing amiss ' Silence is" no fell but the form did not prove, am I still the two stood regarding him Pi m fa aw t> came the sound of the ghost music The head against the wall began to move as if writing from sleep The hinds sank along the will and fell by his sides He early gave a deep syn, and stood leaning his forehead against the wall Donal touched Lady Al elm i and said with his eyes " Had we not better go ' He will presently look round " bbc southed assent and they turned softly and left the room, Lady An entire still leading She went straight on to the library Its dark oak cases and old bindings were hardly able to select a lay of the pool taper she carried but the fire was not quite out She set down the light, turned towards Donal, and looked at him in silence lVh it does it all mean in the said in a hoarse whisper ' God knows," she returned solemnly, but with less emotion than Downs would have expected Are we safe'' he asked "How can you tell he will not come here ' ' I do not think he will I have seen him in many parts of the house but novel here As she spoke of the door swung noiselessly open, and the ear entered His face was ghastly pale , his eyes were wife open and he came straight towards them But he did not see them, or if he did, he saw them but as phantoms of the dream in which he was walk mg phantoms which had not yet become active in his imagination He drew a chair to the embers of the hello his fancy, I believe, a great and comfortable blue-sat for a moment or No looking into them, then rose, and going to a distant part of the room took down a book from a shelf, returned with it to the fir e, di cw towards him At cuts a s tiny taper, opened the book, and began to read in an audible men mur And this is as neat as Donal, trying afterwards to recall and set it down, could come to what he said in the heat t of the dark car in cave Lay the king In the marble dome of the church so brave the huge bells rise Said the wor mat his side King fool 1 urn to the bride or of the night Is cool Wouldst thou He like a stone till the night less morn Out of the dark he born?

All the time the tone of the speaker showed plainly enough that he took the stuff for genuine poetry Nay, more, somehow he seemed to take it as presenting an essential verity of the form and material at least of his consciousness One would have thought that the worm might again have had a word to say to the buried di corner, but no, the worm had vanished, and the dreamer had made himself a god-his now a goal ' Donal v entered after a while to steal softly near, and peep over his shoulder at the book, it was the " Novum Organum " With a mutual glance the two stole out of the room, and left the dreamer to his dreams "Do you think,' said Donal, "I ought to tell Simmons a He must know more about his master than anyone else 1" "It would be better You know where to find him " ' I do not " "I will show you a bell that rings in his room He will think his lordship has rung it, and will look for him till he finds him " They went and rang the bell, and soon heard the steps of the faithful servant seeking his master Then they bade each other good- night, and parted [TO m.
