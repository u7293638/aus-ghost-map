HIS MASTERPIECE. • kb of the prom ising signs of the times is the increased interest shown in S haebmabm’s works. A society hae been formed in H o b art fo r the express purpose of system atically studying the im m ortal productions of the Bard of Avon, and h itherto its gatherings appear to R a re been em inently iastructive. A healthy reaction in favor of th e Shakespariaa D ram a is also noticeable in many quarters, and on F rid a y nig h t the good folk o f H o b a rt will havfi an opp ortunity of w itnessing M r. W alter B f.k tlet e scholarly in terpretation of the character of H am let. Before th a t enjoyable c re n i cbmes off a* sh o rt return* of th e ‘various H am lets w hich have delighted thousands of students cannot fail to interest o a r readers. From Siukbspbarb’s tim e down to th a t of F b c h tb r, th e actors who achieved m ost celebrity in the p art w ere only fifteen in num ber, alth o u g h ; there- have, of course, been m any' H am lets of lesser note. N or does th is Hat include the nam es of such m odern H am lets of distinction as th a t A t H s k b t Isn.vo in Eaglnud, Edwin B ooth - j u ’ A m erica, end Tomimpo gALVjiv end E rnsbto-H ossi in Italy . T h e first stagn H am let was RiCBAiiD B chdagIj th e g reatest acto r o f Shakespeare's day ;.. B orn about th e year 1666, he was’ th e original of a dozen of Shakespeare’s characters 1 o n th e stag e, Including S h y lo ck ,, B ichard 11?., Romeo, H enry O thello, L ear, Macbeth, Coriolanus, a n d H am let. Buxbaok, like O a rric k and K ean, w as sh o rt i n statu re, and a t h e tim a w hen H sm le t w as brought u t had bocome som ew hat corpulent ence, ap p arently ,1th e fine i n th e la st c t o f ^HfuilJet^spdke’n o f 1the Prinda y -Q u e « i7 ^ ^ tn id o , ^ H e ’s mid ftih t o f .isrO i^V ^' i, no record of tho m anner i n ' w hich B ubbaqb acted H am lethhs com edow n to us, a fact which i t toh© regretted, inasm uch os the actor w as in stru cted in tho p a rt by the great d ra m a tist himself. O f his fazno in Shakespcrian intefpretaHbnaT there is, however, no question; aud of all these im personations hifl H am let takes hig h est rank. The second H am let n f n o te was Thomas B » ttew o n (1635-1710), th e lending acto r of the R estoration. H e played chiefly under tho m anagem ent of S ir W illiam Dayvvant, w h o is to be' credited w ith the introduction of proper scenery and costumes to th e fifnge. B e tte rto n , who fir^t played Hnmlet a t the age of tw enty-seven, iustnutly “ electrified his audience ” in tho character. T hereafter th e tragedy w as frequently revived, w ith BiTTiifiTdx As th e Prince, an d w ith feUcli success th a t its financial record was n o t equalled a t the rim e by a n y other production. Ooi.lsy C iussb, in his m asterly “ Apology,” hook w hich is full of adm irable criticism on th e a r t of acting; h as eft >a grapkio word p ictu re, too loug, unfortunately, to quote in fu ll of Bbtteston’s Ham let. B sj’tbhton*^ first scene w ith the ghost w as p a r ­ ticularly impressive. H e opened it with “ a pause of m ute a m a z e m e n t; than risin g siowly to a solemn, trem bling voice, be m ade tb c ghost equally terrib le to th e 6pect&lor; as to himself, iibd in th e descriptive p a rt of ihfl natu ral emotions w hich th e ghastly vision gave him tbe boldness of his expostulation w as still governed by decency, m anly, b u t n o t braving, bis voice never rising into that seem ing outrage or w ild defiance of vrbat be natarally revered." B eiturton, whose H am let w as c h a r­ acterised by filial tenderness and dignity, created n o <less th a n one hundred and tb itty characters d u ring his long and hoaorable oarcer. H is successor w as the illustrious David Gajihick (3 710-1779), w ho first acted H am let in Dublin iu th e summer season of 1742, h a rin g fo r his O phelia no lees a person than Mabgarkt W offinuYoN, whose name wsb tak en by Ciiauus K bapl and Taylob for th e heroine of “ M asks aud Faces.” The popularity of tbe young H am let in the IriBb capital was extraordinary. The people were infected w ith the G arrick fever," and this H am let of tw enty-six was dubbed “ Roscius,” an affectation which did not tu rn th e youthful player's head. The Dublin verdict was endorsed by th a t of London. G airick, like B bttektok, made his g reatest effect in the ghost scenes. *' W hen he first saw the vision the fear w ith which he seemed to be filled im m e­ diately communicated itself to his audience. His expostulations, tiiongb warm and imperative, were yet restrained by a filial awe. T he progress of his impassioned sensation until the ghost beckoned him to retire was accompanied with on adm irable m ixture of terro r and reverence.” A characteristic of Gi*Ries‘’.S' H am let whs tho note of filial piety struck ia the first scene w ith the ghost. Ho was also excellent in the varioas soliloquies, m aking his greatest effect in th e speech commencing “ 0 w hat a rogue and peasant slave am 1." G arrick's pathos in the conclusion of H am let’s exhortation w ith his mother w as also particularly fine. ‘*Davy,” who w as perpetually endeavoring to im prove Shakespeare, m ade a wild and w onderful version i>f “ Ham let.” AmoDg other thitj£r he com pletely w hitewashed Lae:.- 5. and he rxpunged the characters of ; gravediggers and young Osric. L»- isb was also a t first provided with a u jiu g speech, w hich was so well received by th e audience that it was speedily transferred to Hamlet. (jABKirK’s H am let was .f.ilhiwed by that of J ohb H enskrsok ( i 747-I7So), fam iliar in slage history a s th e “ B ath Roscius.” H bndkrson, as Shylock, successfully challenged com parison with Macklik, b ut be is m ost fam ous for his Falstaff. H is H am let, n ev ertheless, had its good points, chief of which w as the exquisite m usic of his voice in the apostrophe “ the fair Ophelia.” B u t tho G a rric k w o r­ shippers would have none of him as Hamlet. They found fault vritk him for throw ing aw ay the p o rtra it of hie uncle in the fam ous scene betw een the Queen and H am let, and, again, for retaining it, after the deseertation os the brothers. N or did he m anage his hat pioperly on seeing th e g h o s t! Bat hie most heinous offence lay in tho famous closet scene, in w hich he did not upset the chair according to tradition. “ M r. G orrick, sir, alw ays overthrew the chair," com plained the adherents of the g reat little man. George F sipbbick Cookz (1756- 1812), who excelled g reatly iu oth er characters, was a complete failure as Hamlet, who w as converted by him into “ an unpolished, obstinate, s a r­ castic m adm an.” T he three K emdlrs—J ohn P bm-it, Charles, aud STErnxv—all tried H am ltt, the mo6t successful of the trio being th e elder, J ohn P m n r (1757-1823), who, thanks to the influence of his sister, S arah S iiiuoks, made hi* first appearance on the hoards of D rury Lane T heatre on Septem ber SOtb, 1873, ae th e Dane.
