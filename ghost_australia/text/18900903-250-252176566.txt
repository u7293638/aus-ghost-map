)N. UPPER YARRA SHIRE ELECT ? TO John .1->TI C. ( ' Wildman W'iLl M-J N says CJ VS : R "Before tmishmg a word with the * Ghost.'" company of a spiritual agency, 1 expecreu «AJ hear something noble, somet!nDg « ^ » inous ; no, but like the- e poile3 cMld ke takes to wallowing in the mire, and throws at me. I am no ghost in my "present helter," as lie wonld throw a bone to a <log to keep him quiet while he is enacting his iuf urions tricks. For thus acting be lets ub into the secret of his motive power, ' 1 have d will of my own," &c.; Unfortunately there are others with wills of their own besides himself that " are wiser in their own conceit than 10 men that can render a reason. « wonld be an insult to the councillors to suppose that the want of taste and gentlemanly consideration displayed in the highest degree by Mr John C. Wildman referring to my " present shelter" finds a response in them, and as the late election shows that the polled child" exploit did not gain him popularity with the ratepayers, so I am far mistaken if his position will be unproved in that respect by his reference to my "present shelter." Nevertheless I thank him for that word. It brings me back to a neglected duty of sincerely thanking the Council for my " preseut shelter."—1 am, &c.;, JOHN EWART. Launching Place, 1st September.
