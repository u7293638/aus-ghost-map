In CPu' 7'' Lady Day they were celebratin. the W ment of Goo's promise in the Gardu Eden that "The seed of the j crush the serpent's head."

It would b« ITJ? to review briefly the wonderful Moaumrtf God, who sent this message of salvaticiti man. In the first place Jesus eiiri-t Son of God, descended from heaven " condescended to possess a l,c-iv that he suffered and died for maihi Christ not only died for mankind, hot 1 left his Church, which is to last f«isl time, for the purpose of continuin- tr< work of saving mankind. He toll tit Apostles to teach all nations, so thai fe might enter into the possession of hippiness, joy, and glory, as He said, - Belriil will be with youall days.erou tothecm-o mation of the world." In this would besi the wonderful economy of Gal's j-lan crie salvation of mankind so b.-autifully w-rti out. There was another point ilmwi! illustrate the beauty of Gol's svstem. 1: the foundation of "the human ras a woman was given to Adaui as a hdpmef, so in the plan of the Almi-htv lor ta salvation of tuaukind the man aniW-jim occurred in almost a similar way, iur Mar was certainly selected by God tóaidiitk plan of man's redemption. She was the wtfinah who was selected to fulfil the dirk' promise " to crush the serpent's head'd to restore purity to mankind." It misrt be asked, why was Mary selected tor fe high purpose r Mary was selected becam of lier piety. " Ulessed are the cku « heart, tor they shall see tiod." Marvhij special graces. In that heautifai old Jewish tradition, preserved l>jtV.e ink, it was shown that Mary, at the a^'e of li was received at the Temple as a rirsil specially consecrated to the service of fisi and she remained there for three van Thus, Mary, consecrated to the senict r! God, was really the first nun. Jesus Chrk was a God of mercy : llarv was sfc tionately addressed by Catholics as lis Mother of Mercy.
