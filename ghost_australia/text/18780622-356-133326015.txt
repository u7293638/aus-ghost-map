LAMBTON. ACCIDENT.-A child, daughter of Mr. James Ihnen, was severely burned at an outside fire on Friday evening. It appears that the child with others was playing near the fire, when its clothes ignitcd. It is severely burned. Something New.-Mr. H. Pilkington, the spirited proprietor of several stone quarrics at Lnm .ton, has led m. deo to order, a strong waggon for the purpose of carrying stone to Nlewoastle. Tlho wargon is tihe first thing of the kind ever seen in this district. It was used on Friday for the first time, when it was loaded with as much stone as can be packed into three ordinary drays. Ble sides its suoerior carrying capacity it has the ad varntage of making muchl lighter work for the hIorses, especially the shaufter, as it is supp ied with a good brake. Theoe Jire some steep hills to descenid oa these roads, r?nd the ordinary dray, when heavity loaded, is hard upon the horses. The Municipaiii l Councils ought to be tlhankful to A r. Pilkiigton for this new introdluction, for they will save something, as it will not cut tihe roads up nearly so much ai the drays. Tie (inonT.-A few nights ago, two men had a fight , car the Dark Creek bridge; one of them, finding the contest rather lhot, took to his heels, leaving Lis coat and white pocket lhandkerchief behind on the road. Shortly afterwards, a pas sing traveller noticed the articles mentioned, and being of ai mischlievious spirit, conceived a joke. lie hung the coat upon a post, and tiedl tIhe handkeirchief round the sop of it to form a head. That nighit several persons saw the Dark Creek ghost, and not even the cork's shrill clarion or tie snillhug of night's candles drove him fromi his perch, for there ihe was found when jocund day stood tip-too on the misty mountain's top.
