THE 5TH OF NOVEMBER. Remember, remember, The fifth of November, Gunpowder Treason and Plot; A faggot and stake For Ted Butler's sake, Parkes' treachery won't be forgot. He promised, the thief! That Ned should be Chief Villany, humbug, and rot! But he sold his friend; How long to his end Shall his Judas act e'er be forgot? O, shade of the "ghost!" Come and pledge me a toast:â€” "The health of Hal Parkes," I say; When "auld Clootie," comes for him, May the memory gnaw him Of that fifth of November day. B. Bega, 2nd December, 1873.
