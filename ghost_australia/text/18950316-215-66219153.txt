Spiritualistic Frauds, aMr Iaskolyne, in an interview which appears ini the "English Illustrated Magazine," gives the following account of how ho first began to suspect the bona tides of spiritualism.:-"-'' The first awaken ing of my interest in" the exposure of spiritualistic. frauds -arose in' this way. wIt Was during lmyappreiticeship. Adja-. ciit te oduplace ?'-busiaioas'there resided a man and wom?n wbliiprofusseau to effect cures by -mesmerism. About that time .table - turning became a fashionable amusement, and the Fox family had startled America by a second edition of the * Cock-lane Ghost.' \Vell, these. mesmerists commenced to hold spiritual intic seances, and one day the woman brought to our 'shop what she called a surgical appliance to be repaired. Itecon sited of two levers, a long one and a short one, each mounted upon apivot attached to a strap, and connected by a piece of catgut. As you may suppose, Ien tirely failedto seewhat kind of surgicalap. pliance this.thing cou'd be, and wascurious -to discover its real use. Having re paired it, I devoted, a few minutes to experimenting with it, and found that by buckling -the strap of the sliortt'lever round the left ankle,-and that of: the long lever round theo leg just below the knee, by pressingthe right.heel upon a projec tion at the side of theshort lover the long one could;be, idrkeduip and made to strike the und'tsilde''of the table. Accord 'in'ly;.I'.ioboked it' as a table-r?iping apparatus, and the bill was sent in: ' Re pairs to table-rapping apparatus, is. 6d.' This I considered very sharp on my part at the time; but it was about, the ,'orst thing I could have done, as it pro vented a complete exposure of those im postors being male. Although cevoral persons, at my suggestion, attended the seances afterwards, with the object of catching the lady red-handed, no table rapping was over attempted.. This was a lesson by which I profited, greatly in my subsequent investigations." . -o --
