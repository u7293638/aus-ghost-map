ACADEMY OF MUSIC. "HAMLET.” The largest house that has assembled in Ballarat to greet the company now playing in the Academy of Music gathered last night to witness Mr G C Miln and his talented assistants in “Hamlet” Eveiy available inch of sitting space was occupud, whilst many thrust themselves into standing post turns, and thus witnessed the play Hun dreds were also refuse 1 admiss on It is the dreini of every actoi with any ambition to figure as “the melancholy Hme,” and every one with any claim to talent his his own reading of the character All may not have the audacity to cany out their conceptions, as their reputations might not stand thestram of sevcie adverse cnticism Hence wo are accustomed to see Shake«pe ire’s in isterpiece of creation depicted on set lines The only depaitines from the fixed groove ventured upon are tnfli ig altei vtions in stage busi ness Mr Mdu goes much further His differences from the accepted version are so many and so marked as to win foi him the utter condemnation of those who consider there is but one way of reading the cha racter, and that vv ay their ow n His concep tion diffeis from th it of other able ictors in that he sees something more than a settled melancholy and a fixed purpose in the prince. He lemembers tint young Ham let was trained at Cmrt in all the graces and accomplishments of vigor ous manhood, and th it while deep set tied soirow might overcast his character the manly instincts must at times break thiongh the hevvy clouds and come to the surface Whenever Mi Milu departs from the beaten trick his action furnishes the rea son that induced his judgment to adopt the new tendering Howevei much the hearer might differ from Mi Miln in hisrciding of the pins vge, he could not but admit that the interpretation was mule by a student who had dived deeply ana lovingly into the great bud’s works In his interview with the ghost Mr Miln was vtry effective, both in act and speech, and the same may be said of his interviews with Poloiuus and Ophelia, and his greeting of R isen cram and Giiddcnstern His delivery of the soliloquy “ Oh 1 what i rogue mu pleasant slave” wa* most po verful, albeit different from what we have been iccustomed to Uh rendition of the fumliai soliloquy on deith was a sp'emlid simple of elocution and acting combined In the plvy c eene he gives auevv rendering, and one that is by no means unpleasant to tlio-e unfettered by prejudice Ills acting in the chamber with his mother was thrilling and powerful In the fin il scene he proved himself an expeit fencer In fact, wherever demands were nude upon his powers he proved tquvl to them, vnd his pourtray il of the eh iractcr was it all tunes consistent with lua eon eeption of it He was called befoie the curtain at the end of each act, md some amongst the audience, not content with the ordinary methods of expressing appro bition, loudly burr died the actor Miss Louise Jordiu furly divided the honors with Mr Miln. In the earlier scenes she was natuial and effeetiw, but in the mad scene she rose to the full height of the occasion. A moio natural simu'ation of insanity it would be difficult tu imagine In it the actress was completely for gotten in the completeness of art. T 1 e utter self abandonment and total disregard of the presence of othcis, vyith at tunes petulant dumb remonstrance at interrup tions, the jerky, disconnected actions and speeches, showing occa-ionally almost a realism ol gnef, only to be changed mstanter to maniacal laughter; all these were mam fested in the abrupt, changeful style ap parent when reason is o’erthrown Stage business, as ordinarily understood, was dis carded, or at least so closely linked with niture, that it seemed the only thing to expect under the circumstances A more natural and thnllingly effective exhibition of a mind off its balance h«s never been seen on the Ballarat stage, and the talented young actress was deserv edly called before the curtain to bow in response to load plaudits. Having expended so much space in criticising the two prin cipals, we must merely single out the names of the other performers worthy of favorable mention —King Claudius.
