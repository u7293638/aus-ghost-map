It is the opinion of all I have spoken to that this vile production emanates from the pen of ono in our midst, who, though iu his own estimation it. rcry subtle, shown hiit auluul sliallon-iicHs by tliis very letter.

My lost glance shewed me a number of stolen sobriquets, amongst which I observe particularly 'cockatoo,' 'try again.' ' S. M.' and man v others. If this would-be conservative felt aggrieved at tbe wanton waste of l'U. ic montj, an a ic innoccn re cllieient' police! how' much more'inauly would it have been had he openly laid those charges before the heads ol' iho de partments, and not stab unoll'endiug public -cminls-iu whom ibo community has explicit confidenceâ€” in tbo dark, shielded behind the signature of' A Lute Visitor.'
