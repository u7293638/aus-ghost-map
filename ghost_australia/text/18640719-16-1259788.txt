"DOINGS AT THE BISHOP OF r SYDNEY. The Right Reverend the Metropolitan Bishop of Sydney held a state in St John's Church hardly Service commenced at eleven o clock, flowers were read by the Rev J Bliss Nearly all of the clergymen of the Church of Llond, resident in Queensland, Wife present, follows -The EightBcveiend Bishop Tuf well and those Messrs Moseley, Tomlinson, Moffatt, Bliss, Hoare, Ramsey, Shaw, Poole, "d Jones After the first portion of the service had been concluded, the Right Reverend Bishop of Sydney delivered the following address which was listened to attentively by the toge'number of members of the Church of England who comprised the congregation Mr Eight Ketebend Brother and Kev EBEVD BRETHREN, In visiting you as your metropolitan, it is my torts desire and prayer that, under the Divine Message I wax be made the means of helping forward the great work we have in common, the advancement of the Redeemer s kingdom, by bringing souls to the knowledge and love of in these colonies, where the intercom so of the clergy with each other is infrequent and where from the distances to be traversed, the bishops of the different dioceses can with dull culty meet, it is on advantageous arrangement "back once in five years brings together (he metropolitan the bishops, and the clergy, to take counsel on matters belonging to our Masters work, and to help each other to over come the difficulties which beset our path In conformity with the requirements of the Queen s letters patent, I have already visited the older dioceses of Tasmania, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Newcastle, and take this my first opportunity) of coming to-von, earnestly destiny with the apostle to impart to you some spiritual gift and to be helped by your counsels and 1 myers in the work committed to my care May the gracious Spirit be present with, us to direct, sanctify and govern both our hearts and bodies in the ways of God Is laws and in the works of His commandments so that now and hereafter woman glorify our Heavenly Father The first observation I will make is that there is much rigour incident to be derived from the fact of our assembling together for the present purpose, so early in the history of the colony Bow musicals did the scattered members of the Church of England in our North American colonies v only sue for the extension of the episcopate to the lands in which they had found them unable to obtain on increase to the number of the or darned pastors from amongst theirselves, save by a perilous voyage and hazardous residence in the mother country No marvel that the church in North the Amer am rather resembled a sickly plant in an ungenial soil than a vigorous offshoot from the parent stem Long too was it el of the church in the colonies could receive the benefit of such government and administration as the Church of England provides Unity i years ago the Bishop of Calcutta was Bishop and Metropolitan of Australia. The Archdeacon of New South Wales t recognised him as far ecclesiastical head, and received from the energetic diocesan who then filled the episcopal chair of Calcutta, such exhortations and councils as in the war with of his zeal and affection, he was ready to offer to this distant portion of his province How great the change which a quarter of a century has witnessed where ano bishop presided over Aiibti basin, including New Zealand, now fourteen bishops, and between 400 and 500 clergymen are found In Australia there are eight bishops, will 300 clergymen, and in New Zealand six bishops, including the excellent missionary bishop Paterson and about 100 clergymen and misioners The most recently for mid diocese of Goulburn was taken from that of Sydney, and is endowed mainly by the colonists themselves nobly led on by one family conti buting £5000 The next bishopric will probably be on the southern boundry ) of Queensland One gentleman has already given £2000 towards the cn dowment of the see of Grafton and Ai medals for this remarkable increase in the episcopate indicating) we are in a great measure indebted to the foresight and disinterested liberality of its predecessor, the first Bishop of Australia who by divesting himself of 8 portion of his income, and by ob taxing the sanction of the Imperial Government to his plans, had the satisfaction of ultimately seeing his unwieldy diocese divided into five, and it has been comparatively easy to follow in his steps, and to obtain the formation of three additional sees The advantages of this subdivision are very great and are deeply impressed upon my own mind on what is now going on in a consider able portion of my former diocese, the present diocese of Goulburn. A financial visit was all that I could hope to afford, and that not without con- siderable inconvenience Too frequent to keep up plans which had for the moment been cheerfully adopted, too burned to see all or to do all that was requisite, these visits occupied one fourth of the year, left the impression that much remained to be done which could never be accomplished, and accumulated a considerable arrear of business at the centre of our work Now, with respect to the southern and south western report of New South Wales all this is changed My right reverend brother and dear friend throws all his considerable experience and energy into work which I could only occasionally approach His selection of clergymen in England, and his location of them in his own ewes, have been characterised by great prudence, and attended with success, and my former anxieties are now as changed for abundant thanksgiving to Almighty Obviously, and in the experience of those who hear me, itisainmmense advantage to the church, not only to have the full organisation which her stem requires, but that one qualified by education, disposition, and experience, should be charged with the oversight of her affairs, should be responsible for the proportionate in crease in the number of the clergy, and for their performance of the duties of their sacred office, should bring all his influence and powers to bear upon the well being of the slim oh, and by his example, exhortations, and prayers be to all her ministers and members truly o ' Father in God ' Uno advantage to this diocese arising out of the extended efforts and increased energy of the church I may here notice.

should find little) for " the Lord had ordained that they who preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel " This leads me to speak of the means of preventing the difficulty I have named from be coming permanent in the church in the colonies Sulhuent provision must be made for the main tenance of the clergy, if suitable clergymen in sufficient numbers are to be located in the diocese -If the service of the church falls into disrepute for its power on the precarious nature of its council lion the consequence will be that unsuitable or inefficient men will be found 111 the ranks of our ministers this it may be said, is rather a question for the laity to doubt it belongs to them to pro While the means of supporting the clergy and they are deeply interested in the character of the clergy who minister to them and to their families , but it is also the duty of the clergy to provide suitable instruction, for his daily on this subject the church has done this in one of the most solemn of her services Some of the offertory sentences are selected for Ihoptuposo of reminding those who are taught in the word to minister to him that teacheth in all good things I have been surprised to find that on the occasion of making a collection for the common fund of the diocese, the officiating minister through a false delicacy, lins omitted the cry sentences which were most suitable for loading at such a time, and thus had lost the opportunity of instructing the people that we " go not to this warfare at our own cost " If the state repudiates the obligate 1 of supporting religion, and we are reluctant to speak upon this club to the members of our own church, on mission must languish if not fail in the towns, and in the riches pastoral dis- (nets a clergyman may be

that this union and liberally may be promoted, the clergy must not be silent touching the duty of the laity in these matters there is, however, another and higher cost federation which may properly be brought before us, as we dwell upon the difficulty of obtaining suitable clergymen The remedy provided by Christ himself is very simple " The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few, pray ye, therefore, the Lord of the harvest that He would send forth laborers into the harvest ' We want men, men whom not one cessity, or the will of friends, or the mere pro silence for a dense! life,
