TALKS ABOUT ROME. A By- O.M.S. AMONG THE NAIADS AND DRYADS. When Keats, who now sleeps under the violets and daisies in the Protestant cemetery at Rome, dated the pathetic epitaph inscribed upon his tombstone, "Here lies one whose name was writ in water," The w tes unconscious), from a Roman point of view, proclaiming his own immortality) Tot, is a modern writer aptly observes, Consuls, emperors, and popes, the great men of every age, have found no better way of immor- realising their memories than by the shutting, indestructible, ever new, yet unchanging, up gush and downfall of water The) have written their names in that unstable element, and proved it a more durable record than brass or marble " And so it is YY carry away all things else, it remains for ever unwearying and unworn Ever changing, and yet ever the same, it is at the same time the most evanescent and the most enduring of e elements What a Protean thoumaturgus is water I Etherealising into vapour, it distils in the dew drop, condenses in the storm cloud, congeals in the iceberg, and cr) stresses in the beautiful snow. Converted into a solid, it will burst a bombshell with an irresistible a force as that of gunpowder Transformed into an invisible vapour, it will read wrought iron as if it were tissue paper, -resolved into a liquid, a little child may cast a pebble into its lowest depths, and yet the swiftestcnniion ball will ricochet from its surface as if it were adamant Imprisoning elemental fires in its bosom that will dissipate the most re- fractory metals into vapour, it is the only element that will subdue a conflagration Though tasteless, it never palls upon the palate, and is the most refreshing of bever- ages and though colourless, it crowns itself with rainbows, and decks earth, sea, and sky with an aureole of prismatic colours and imperial splendours There's the jellowTiber, ever flowing into the freshness of immortal youth, as strong and tireless as when Romulus first laid the foundations of Rome, or Ev antler formed the first settlement on the Palatine Mount. "Great Tiber, that far away wonder in the dusky oak woods of embraces that Umbria which is older than Etruria runs a little rill amongst the mountain mosses, . . . 'liber, a mere thread of water where lovers mirror their smiling eyes, and charcoal burners dip their birch bark cups , Tiber, that comes down from the oak woods to roll like molten bronze towards the setting sun, big with the mightiest memories of the w oriel, Tiber, that has engulfed the statues of Etruria and the other figures of the Vestals, and the treasures of Hadrian, and the golden to) s of the happiness, and the spoils of Jerusalem, and the corpses of the Spolanuin, and holds them all fast and only yields them to the sen." Tiber, ever flowing as it sings its everlasting song " For men may come and men may go, But I go on forever One of the chief glories of Rome is its fountains Perhaps no city in the world, of its size, can bestow such a bountiful supply of pure, sparkling water There is water, water everywhere," and every drop fit for a Rechabite to drink These fountains are ubiquitous The) greet you not only in the principal plane and public gardens, but in the most unexpected, out of the way places The) are as multiform as multiplied How the jo) ous water tumbles merrily in cascades, or meanders aimlessly in rivulets vow to spouts sportive!) from the mouth or nostrils of a lion, 01 griffin, or some other possible or impossible monster, in stone or marble and now "flashes heavenward in aspiring jets, as if to emulate the stars, and then descends in a veil of gossamer, or a shower of diamonds But, whether glistening in the moonlight, or glittering in the sunshine, whether plunging into the sombre shadows of some deserted court, or shooting up adds their liquid cr) stal into the noontide splendours of some populous piazza, whither gladdening the day with their silver sheen, or making musical the night with their m cessant murmur-leaping, splashing edd) mg, bubbling, foaming-the fountains of Rome are a constant surprise, a never ending delight The fountains, too, have their variable moods, and are many voiced It may bellies appear gay) and festive, or grave and melancholy, as they reflect more or less perfectly the changing humours of the sympathetic spectator But, be it fact or fancy), cheerless is virtually the same. At the hour of mid- night, when the old Pagan gods are said to revisit Rome, you imagine, at times, that you hear in their melodious voices the tuneful pipe of some frolicsome fame, or the rippling daughter of a winsome water nymph, who have hidden themselves away all day long in the cool, secluded recesses of their moss covered rocks And then there comes a sadder strain The voices of the fountains are pitched upon a minor ke) They now prattle incoherently of the past, and till) babble of the ghosts of unforgiven crimea ' for ever flowing, as they have since the days of Agrippa and Augustus, will they ever wash away the bloodstains of ancient Rome, whose foundations were find in blood, and whose soil is saturated with human gore to the deepest depths of its most ancient ruins VA ill the) ever obliterate the treachery) of Tarpeia, the enormities of '1 tilba, the shameless de butcheries of Messabna, or the atrocities of those monsters of cruelty and licentiousness Nero and Caligula, Domitian and Tiberius s No ' this bird will rather "The multitudinous seas incarnation, Mnkmt the green one red King, by divine right, over them all is the Fountain of 'Irevi M lth itsmassiverockwork and mythological divinities, its semicircular cascades and multitudinous jets in eau that last into foam the mimic lake in its huge marble basin, tina extravaganza in marble has, tirrcenturieB, constituted the elaborate!) wrought " drinking cup of modern Rome So potential is the virtue of this fountain of Agrippas traditional virgin, that, it lashed, whoever drinks a draught of its delicious water on leaving Rome will assuredly) return again despite all opposing obstacles Then there is the Fountain of 1 germ, still haunted by the legendary 115 mph " Sage Nimias counsellor, his friend, and bro!. - who, was Ovid tells us, overcome with grief at the death of the great law giver, dissolved into tears, when Duma compassionately transformed her into a perennial fountain The Pincian Hill, with its fashionable cono, cosmopolitan crowd, and plutocratic flavour, is eminently typical of modern Rome, where the statues of mythologies gods are supplanted by the marble busts of Italy's illustrate, and the polish of the ancient nobility is eclipsed by the glass of modem respectability But the Borghese gardens belong to the past "Ovid and Virgil might have walked in this lovely spot, says Madame de Steel, and thought themselves still in the Augustan age ' In truth, one can almost imagine, when strolling through the secluded groves and sun flecked solitudes of the Borghese gardens, that Arcadia of the Saturnian age had come again Leay mg the modern city behind, with its bustle and uproar, its narrow streets and stone gave ments, you seem suddenly transported to the fair) realms of mythology), where the unreal world becomes a reality and notes are no longer mythical Wandering amid these sylvan retreats, beneath the whispering pines and venerable alex trees, you would scarcely be surprised to see the shaggy shepherd god, Pan, playing upon his pastoral read, while jocund farms and sisters dis ported themselves, in some flower) glade, with graceful names and deeds, who, on your nearer approach, if not petrified into marble, suddenly) disappear into the cool recesses of an artificial lake, or beneath the rough bark of mail) a patriarchal oak or ancient alex tree Nor would it occasion greater surprise to see Aphrodite, with a train of water nymphs, emerge from the sum of some sparkling fountain as it flashed in the sunlight, and then suddenly vanish ma gossamer like veil of mist 01 a shower of fragmentary rainbows.
