I eterroN, opened in Melbourne last week, H proved a considerable success for a first exhi. bition. From the papers to band by the s.s, h Derwtent we learn that Mr Metzger, of East th Iselbostrne, received thu ctup given tb tieta most stccessful exhibitor of canaries. The to cempetition was very close between him and o Mr Hardie, of Richmond, the number of points scored by each being 23 and 22 re spectively. The cup for the most successful t exhibitor of pigeons was given to Mr Crewe at thers, whose number of points was 23, against to Messrs Fox and Son's 20. Messrs Fox ro. (h ceived Mr George Watson's cup for the most at successful exhibits of pouter pigeons. The I" exhibits of carriers were not considered do- Ac serving of the president's cup. The several cups consisted of etneggsltandsomelymounted , in silver and gold. The cup for the best Boel t gian canary was won by Mr Aldred, of ot Hobart Town. The Argue states that " the sc Tasmanian birds rank as the finest in the ti exhibition; and the order in wlieh the ex. m hibitors stand in point of sticcess is-Mr Aldred first, Mr Northcoto second, and Mer d Montgomery third, 'It may give persons ao who have not visited the show some idea of its extent when we mention that the toal' number of birds present is about 825, of which at least 450 are canaries." A supper was given on Monday evening in honor of the Tasmanian competitors, and in the speeches which followed a feeling was ex pressed that although the Tasmanians w had succeeded in carrying away the challenge tl cup, it would be a formidably contested battle cs for them to do the same at the next annual exhibition. . d AN ODD-LooKING 1IJNTORU-d la KnAoA. di noo.-A correspondent of the. Dally JLerald to states that " wild horses having become so numerous on Dunmore, and their smarket V value 0o low, the proprietor has determined ft to destroy them on the run rather than incur C the expense of mustering. A gentleman Well 2 known in this district as a crack shot has hI now taken thio contract to shoot them. After Ii ttying all sorts of dodges andscltemee to got 1, within range, he has hit upon the following plan, which answers admirably. He has oh. tamed and dried the skin of an 'old man' kangaroo, which he fixes upon his own body, making himself look as like the original owner as possible. The skin of the tail, about L a foot of which 'ho has cut off, hangs loosely from his coat tail. When a mob of horses is o sighted,, he passes the barrel of. .his rifle between his logs and down the hollow of the ii tail, holding the stock in his hands. He then q hops slowly and gracefully on towards whero the horses are grazing or in camp. When lIe gets sulliciently near, he turnn.his back to the doomed animals, low era his head as if lIe were going to feed, the tail rises, a report is heard, and a horse drops. As many its 20. have been shot in one day by adopting this plan, and four and five in one mob as they keep coming ttp to the slaughtered ones, not knowing what the deuce is up. During the last few weeks no lees than 240 'wild horses have been shot."
