THE FORSAKEN FARMHOUSE. Against the wooded hills it stands, Ghost oE a dead home, staring through Its broken lights on wasted lands Where old time harvests grew. Unplowed, unsown, by scythe nnshorn,-. The poor .forsaken farm-fields lie, Once rich'and rife with golden corn - . And pale green breadths of rye. -o 1 J; Of healthful herb and flower bereft, 1 ; " The gaiden'plot.nqhquSewifc Through weeds and tangle only left ' The snake, its tenant, creeps. : A lilac spray, once blossom-clad,. 1 ; Sways. bare befdre the empty rooms ; : Beside the roofless porch _ a sad,' . ; Pathetic red rose blooms, ; f ; His track, in mould of dust and droutfr, ; On floor .and hearth the squirrel lea vies, And in the tireless chimney's-mouth His web the spider. weaves. > The leaning barn about to fall _ i Resounds no more on husking eves ; i No cattle low in yard or stall, - No thresher beats his shraves. ' So sad, so drear I It seems almost - Some haunting spirit makes its sign;' That, down yon. shadowy lane some ghost . Might drive his spectral kine. â€” J. G. Whittier.
