I THE CONFESSION OF FAITH. I We give below another instalment of the Westminster Confession of Faith (Chapters XVI to XII ) The remainder will be published in our issue of to morrow - CHAT XII -Oi ADornov. I All those that are justified, God youth Bafeth, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God , lime Ula name put upon them, receive the Spirit of adoption , have access to the throne of grace with boldness , are enabled to cry Abba, Father , are pitied, protected, provided for, and chastened by him AS by a father, jet never cast off, but sealed to the day of redemption, and inherit the promises as heirs of everlasting salva- tion. CHAP XIII OF SANCTiFicAnoN. I They who are effectually called and re generated, having a new heart and a new spirit created in them, are further Sanctified really and personally through the virtue of Christ's death and resurrection, by His word and Spirit dwelling in them , the dominion of the whole body of sin is destroyed, and the several lusts thereof are more and more weakened and mortified, and they more and more quickened and strengthened in all saving graces, to the practice of true holiness, with out which no man shall see the Lord M This sanctification is throughout in the whole man, jet imperfect in this life, there abideth still some remnants of corruption in every part whence cometh a continual and irreconcilable war, the flesh lusting against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh III In which war, although the remain- ing corruption for a time may much prevail, yet through the continual supply of strength from the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the re generate part doth overcome and so the saints grow in grace, perfecting holiness in the fear of God CHAP XIV OF SAVING TAiTn. The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts, and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the word by which also, and by the administration of the sacraments, and prayer, it is increased and strengthened II By this faith, a Christian believeth to be true whatsoever is revealed in the word, for the authority of God Himself speaking therein and acteth differently upon that which each particular passage thereof con targets , yielding obedience to the commands, trembling at the threatenings, and embracing the promises of God for this life and that which is to come But the principal acts of Boxing faith are, accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone for justification sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of grace III. This faith is different in degree, weak or strong, may be often and in many ways assailed and weakened, but gets the victory, growing up in many to the attain ment of a full assurance through Christ, who is both the author and finisher of our faith CHAP XV OF REFEMANCE UNTO LIFE I Repentance unto life is an evangelical grace, the doctrine whereof is to be preached by every minister of the Gospel, as well as that of faith in Christ II By it a sinner, out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger, but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy nature and righteous law of God, and upon the apprehension of His mercy in Christ to such as are penitent, BO grieves for and hates his Bins, as to turn from them all unto God purposing and endeavour ing to walk with Him in all the ways of His commandments III Although repentance be not to be rested in as any satisfaction for Bin, or any cause of the pardon thereof, which is the act of God's free grace in Christ, yet is it of such necessity to all sinners, that none may expect pardon without it IV As there is no But so small but deserves damnation , so there is no But so great, that it can bring damnation upon those who truly repent V Men ought not to content themselves with a general repentance, but it is every man 's duty to endeavour to repent of his particular BinB particularly VI As every man is bound to make private confession of his BLUE to God, praying for the pardon thereof, upon which, and the for making of them, he shall find mercy , BO he that acondoliseth his brother, or the church of- Christ ought to be willing, by a private or public confession and sorrow for his em, to declare his repentance to those that are offended , who are thereupon to be reconciled to him, and in love to receive him. CiiAr XVI-OF GOOD WORKS I Good works are only such as God hath commanded in His holy word, and not such as, without the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of blind zeal, or upon any pretence of good intention II These good works, done in obedience to God a commandments, are the fruits and I evidences of nature and lively faith and by them believers manifest their thankfulness, strengthen their assurance, edify their brethren, adorn the profession of the gospel, stop the mouths of the adversaries, and glorify God, whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto that having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end eternal life III Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ And that they may be enabled thereunto, besides the graces they have already received, there is required an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit to work in them to will and to do of His good pleasure yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty unless upon a special motion of the Spirit, but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them IV They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height which is possible in this life, are so far from being able to supersede gate, and to do more than God requires, as that they fall short of much which in duty they are bound to do V Me cannot, by our best works, merit pardon of Bin of eternal life, at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them and the glory to come, and the infinite distance that is between us and God, whom by them we can neither profit nor satisfy for the debt of our former sins , but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants and because as they are good, they proceed from the Spirit, and as they are wrought by UB, they are defiled and mixed with so much weakness and imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of God judgment VI Yet notwithstanding, the persons of believers being accepted through Christ, their good works also are accepted in Him, not as though they were in this life wholly unblame able and unreasonable in God a Bight, but that He, looking upon them in His Son, is pleased to accept and reward that which is Sincere, although accompanied with many weaknesses and imperfections VII Works done by unregenerate men, although, for the matter of them, they may be things which God commands, and of good use both to themselves and others, yet, because they proceed not from an heart pun fied by faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word, nor to a right end, the glory of God , they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God or make a man meet to receive grace from God And yet their neglect of them is more sinful, and displeasing unto God CUAP XVII -OF THE PERSEVERANCE or THE SAMS I Tbey whom God hath accepted in His Beloved, effectually called and sanctified by Bia Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace , but shall certainly persevere therein to the end, and be eternally saved II line perseverance of the saints depends not upon their own free will, but upon the immutability of the decree of election, flowing from the free and unchangeable love of God the Father , upon the efficacy of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ, the abiding of the Spirit and of the seed of God is within them, and the nature of the covenant of grace from all which ariseth also the certainty and infallibility thereof. III. Nevertheless they may, through the temptations of Satan and of the world, the prevalency of corruption remaining in them, and the neglect of the means of their preservation, fall into grievous sins and for a time continue therein whereby they incur God a displeasure, and grieve His Holy Spirit, come to be deprived of some measure of their graces and comforts, have their hearts hardened, and their consciences wounded, hurt and scandalise others, and bring temporal judgments upon themselves CHAP XVIII OF ASSURANCE OF GRACE AND SALVATION Although hypocrites and other unre generate men may vainly deceive themselves with false hopes and carnal presumptions of being in the favour of God and estate of salvation . which hope of theirs shall perish, yet such as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and love Him in sincerity, endeavouring to walk in all good conscience before Him, may in this life be certainly assured that they are in the state of grace, and may rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, which hope shall never make them ashamed. II This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion, grounded upon a fallible hope , but an infallible assurance of faith, founded upon the divine truth of the promises of salvation, the inward evidence of those graces unto which these promises are made, the testimony of the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God which Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption III lins infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of faith but that a true believer may wait love,, and conflict with many difficulties before he be partaker of it yet, being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means, attain there unto And therefore it is the duty of every one to give call diligence to make his calling and election sure, that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance so far is it from inclining men to looseness IV True believers may have the assurance of their salvation divers ways shaken, diminished, and intermitted, as by negligence in preserving of it by falling into some special sin, which wounded the conscience and grieved the Spirit, by some sudden or % cherries t temptation, by God's withdrawing the light of His countenance, and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness and to have no light yet are they never utterly destitute of that seed of God and life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart and con Bcienceof duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may in due time be revived, and by the which, in the meantime, they are supported from utter de ? pair CHAP XIX -OF THE LAW OF Goa I God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which He bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire exact, and perpetual obedience, promised life upon the falling, and threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability to keep it. II This law, after his fall, continued to be a perfect rule of righteousness and such, was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai in an commandments, and written in two tables, the first four commandments containing our duty towards God, and the other Six our duty to man III Besides this law, commonly called morn), God was pleased to give to the people of Israel, as a church under age, ceremonial laws containing several typical ordinances , partly of worship prefiguring Christ THE graces actions, sufferings, and benefits, and partly holding forth divers instructions of moral duties All which ceremonial laws are now abrogated under the New Testament IV To them also, OF a body politic, He gave Bundry judicial laws, which expired together with the state of that people not obliging any other now further than the general equity thereof may require V The moral law doth for ever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof, and that not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the authority of God the Creator, who gave it. Neither doth Christ in the Gospel any way dissolve, but much strengthens this obligation VI Although true believers be not under the law as a covenant of works to be thereby justified or condemned , yet it is of great use to them as well as to others, in that as a rule of life, informing them of the will of God and their duty, it directs and binds them to walk accordingly , discovering also the sinful pollutions of their nature hearts, and lives , so as, examining themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction or, humiliation for, and hatred against Bin, together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the perfection of His obedience It is likewise of use to the regenerate, to restrain their corruptions in that it forbids Bill and the threatenings of it serve to show what even their sins deserve, and what affix. tions in this life they may expect for them, although freed from the curse thereof threatened in the law. The promises of it in like manner, Show them Gode approbation of obedience, and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof, although not as due to them by the law as a covenant of works so as a man 's doing good and refraining from evil, because the law en courage to the one and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his being under the law and not under grace VII Neither are the forementioned uses of the law contrary to the grace of the Gospel, but do sweetly comply with it, the Spirit of Christ subduing and enabling the will of man to do that freely and cheerfully which the will of God revealed in the law requires to be done CHAP. IX OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY, AND LiBERT 01 CONSCIENCE The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under the Gospel, consists in their freedom from the guilt of Bin, the condemning wrath of God, the curse of the moral law, and in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan; and dominion of Bin, from the evil of afflictions, the sting of death, the victory of the grave, and everlasting damnation, as also in their free access to God, and their yielding obedience unto Him, not out of Blajish fear, but a child like love and willing mind All which were common also to believers under the law, but under the New Testament, the liberty of Christians is further enlarged in their freedom from the yoke of the ceremonial law, to which the Jewish Church was subjected and in greater bold ness of access to the throne of grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of II God alone is lord of the conscience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in any thing contrary to His word, or beside it in matters of faith or worship So that to be here such doctrines, or to obey such com mandmentB out of conscience, is to betray true liberty of conscience and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience IS to destroy liberty of conscience and reason also III They who, upon pretence of Christian liberty, do practise any Bill, or cherish any lust, do thereby destroy the end of Christian liberty which is, that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life IV And because the powers which God both ordained and the liberty which Christ hath purchased, are not intended by God to destroy but mutually to uphold and preserve one another, they who upon pretence of Christian 1 berty, shall oppose any lawful power or the lawful exercise of it, whether it be civil or ecclesiastical, resist the ordinance of God And for their publishing of such opinions, or maintaining of such practices as are contrary to the light of nature, or to the known principles of Christianity whether concerning faith worship, or conversation, or to the power of godliness, or such er erroneous opinions or practices, as either in their own nature or in the manner of pub fishing or maintaining them are destructive to the external peace and order which Christ hath established in the church, they may lawfully be called to account and proceeded against by the censures of the church, and by the power of the civil magistrate CHAr XXI OF RELIGIOUS Woitsmi AND THE SABBATH DAY The light of nature showeth that there is a God, who hath lordship and sovereignty over all, IS good and doeth good unto all and is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and served, with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the might But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by Him self, and so limited by HIS own revealed will that He may not be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men or the suggestions of Satan under any visible representation, or any other way not prescribed in the Holy Scripture II Religious worship is to be given to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and to Him alone not to angels arunta, or any other creature and, since the fall, not without a Mediator nor in the mediation of any other, but of Christ alone III Prayer, with thanksgiving, being one special part of religious worship, is by God required of all men , and, that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son, by the help of His Spirit, according to His will, with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance and if vocal, in a known tongue IN Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all sorts of men living, or that shall live hereafter, but not for the dead nor for those of whom it may be known that they have sinned the sin unto death V The reading of the Scriptures with godly fear . the Bound preaching and conscionable bearing of the word, in obedience unto God, with understanding faith, and reverence, singing of psalms with grace in the heart, as also the due administration and worthy re serving of the sacraments instituted by Christ, are all parts of the ordinary religious worship of God besides religions oaths and vows, solemn fastings, and thanksgivings upon special occasions, which are, in their several times and seasons, to be used in a holy and religious manner VI Neither prayer nor any other part of religious worship is now under the gospel, either tied unto, or made more acceptable by, any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed , but God is to be worshipped every where in spirit and in truth , as in private families daily. and in secret each one by himself, SO more solemnly in the public assemblies, which are not carelessly or wilfully to he neglected or for saken when God, by His word or providence, calleth thereunto VII As it is of the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God, BO, in His word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment, binding all men in all ages, He hath particularly appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto Him which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week, and, from the required tion of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week, which in Scripture is called the Lord a Day, and is to be continued to the end of the world as the Christian Sabbath VIII This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations , but also are taken up the whole time in the public and private exercises of His worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy
