Oanaa, a ntambsr fox tending tba raoan* ranoval Kaon, on lie 25th October bj iheQarsauuBB-tot large get, afmlnst the Colonial sums of public money from JaeBssrat's »anacoment ot the Bask ot Kew SoeMi the OlxcnlaT Qna/t ? Waba to other banking in* atitatioBS, more espeaslly taereartvalof a him aoav of public money to & bank of whioh the Colonial Treas urer was a director at the titoe of his aooeptanoe of ♦See 5a February last, aad ?f whioh he is reputed to W ?, shareholder. In regard to toe 'specinc' nabme of these two motions it has ta be oon sidered that on the 25th October Vx. Oabvak had cl«wiy stated what his charges were, but, supposing bis motion had made ao re ference to them whatever, and he had only moved fot a committee to inquire into tbje Thftnagement of the Cfagnlar -^aay by tbe Trea sarer, wonM his motion ham been any leas 'vpect&o;' than that of Mr. Pabexs in 1875? Speaking on Wednesday la^t Str Hehbt Passes said that if Mr. Gabvait's motion were accepted _Aay peroon of ansorapnlona character ooald prefer th« wudea% ohar^M against hon. membejs, and ask in tbe *atneat tanna for aselectoonunitteetoiBqniie into them. The hon. gentleman further said — _ When chaeges were made against »n bos. jnemfeer dey ?hoold be etated in olear and specific longaag©. Wbat a raoTirnful specimen of 'dear aad specific language ' in the vsy of avoiding ' the wildest oharges ' and asking for a committee in ' the Taguest terms ' is afforded by the motion of Mr. Pabkss. gome money had been removed from one bank to another, and he wanted to find oat something about 'the ebeuaiatanoes.' I* was the more imperative that these 'eironm- Btances' should be examined into, because the Colonial Treasurer was a director of tine bank into which the money was moved at the time he took offiesaaod worse still, ot which bank he was 'reputed to be a shareholder' at tbe time Mr. Pabkbs submitted his motion. This is a pretty example of tbe ** specific ** on the part of a man who now prates about 'wildest charges' and 'vaguest terms/* in order possibly to tgain time in making his preparations to meet* Mr. Gasman's attack on tbe Treasurer. There was an insinuation in Mr. Pabkss'b motion that Mr. Poaaana* h*4 favoured a bank of wbieb. he w«s a 'reputed shareholder.' but there was not the ghost of a' specific coarse 3' whereas Mr. Gab-, van openly, and in as plain words as the T^^Hgh language eoold t uraiBh, accuses Mr. Watson of ' dishonestly' discharging his duty to the public In the one case there is the bold attack of the lionj in the other, tha stealthy assault of the snake. But what had Mr. Pabebs to say on the sub ject in 1876, when he was in opposition and trying to get a Government into difficulties, instead ot being in office endeavouring to keep his Govern ment out of trouble t First of all, he reminded hon, members of their responsibility, thus : Parliament had att all times been Jealous oi any irndne esercrfao ofpo war. aod un especially by the exercise of it -m the part of those who held office under ttie Crown. . . . In 1888 Bir James Martin carried the following rceolution 1— ' That la the opinion of this House it is highly improper for any of Her Majesty's Ministers in this colony, and more especially for the Colonial Treasurer, to be a director of aiy private 'hnnVlng. insurance, or loan company whatsoever. Had Sir Javob Mastot ta draw up his resolu tion now he would probably add, after the word company, the words 'or owner of any private wharf which competes with the public wharf «{ whioh such Colonial Treasurer is trustee.' Mr. Paekes proceeded — The ojtse one lhie : Tbe Government had, in the ubr doubt*4 «xaroi»« of thefar wathority, xemo-*«d aevewl lane sums of money from the bank. ... It could sot be qaeatkHiea th»t it was toe undoubted right of tbe Parlia ment to make an investigation into anoooanenoe of Otis kind. ...' All he had to say was that the cuxtua steooes themselves c&Ued; Ua to. inquiry.** Tha fact was indtspntfthto, and he believed It vac »n andoabted fact that the hon. gentleman had a proprietary Interest in the hank, and that it va» nnder his band, cm Colonial Treasurer, that those asms had beea removed, Sere we have the only shadow of a ' epecifie onargeuontu«part of SirHKNET Pabess, but it was made in bis speech, and was scarcely nfnted at in his motion except in the ' mildest ' manner and the ' vaguest terms,' which he has now the misfortune to say would only be re sorted to by 'an unscrupulous person.' Tbe moral of all this is that politicians as well as prevaricators sbouia iook arter tn-nr memories. Sir Hknbt Passes was very rough on Mr. Qabvak respecting {he origin of bis charges, and be warned hon. members ia his most solemn style against allowing a committee to be ap pointed on suoa a fliinsey foundation. He said It would not be on inaniry Into a definite charge stated in a. manly etcaighttoewftrd w«s, bat to see what could be fished oat of ti*e tittle-tattle in the com mnnityaRiinstanhonanrftbleman. Could anything be more Parkesonlan than talking about Mr. Gabvak's lack of manliness and stzaightforwardosfis alter his own ineiduous attaok upon Mr. Fobstsk. But leaving that, let us point out the marked difference between the ' ?tittle-tattle of the community ' foundation of Mr. Gabvah'8 motion, and the solid basis on which Mr. Pabkbs rested his. When moving it he said :— He oercld not avoid tha impMsstoa which knowledge ocunmttoioated to him had left upon his mtsd, and he must be ths sole judge of the value of any information of which he might be possessed. On this ' iuipwaeioii,'* tbe result of, as the de tectives eay, ' information received,' Mr. Pabsss introducea his motion, and now he has the in» pertinenca to twit Mr. Oasvas with being led away by' tittle tattle.' The origin of bis wild charge against Mr. Fobstke. was, by bis own ad mission, tittle-tattle, and it was very appro priately found to be allfiddle-faddle. WnetherMr. UASVAirB charge against the Treasurer will have a similarly ignominious collapse, should tbe com mittee he wants be appointed, remains to be seen, bat in the meantime we have proved that in mak lngjeuch a desperate effort to check-mate the hon. member for Eden, Bir Bejkbt Parkes is true to himself es » politician who will abandon his principles of yesterday if the? do but suit his purpose to-day.
