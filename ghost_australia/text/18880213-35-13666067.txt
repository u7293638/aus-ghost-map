TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-I have observed several letters and two leaders on this subject, and in due fairness both to the consumers and the master bakers, I consider, from 30 years' experience, that an Act of Parliament should be passed this session on the basis of selling bread, both in the shops and out of the carts, by weight only, excepting fancy bread, rolls, Le . as practised in London I have a copy of the London Act, which any of your leaders are welcome to see by calling on me A great deal has been said about foremen in some few cases wilfully spoiling the batches, and causing the master or mistress (for we have widows in this line to be Unod Clerks in the banks and other positions of trust have to give a bond, guaranteed by the Fidelity Guarantee Society, and it must be allowed that defalcations or errors of judgment are very rare I would suggest that all foremen should receive extra pay to cover the annual cost of such bond, and in wilful cases the company would have to pay the fine inflicted on the master or mistress by such conduct I think the annual premium would be moderate, as the former are, generally speaking, honest, hard-working men, and, as guarantee company s are mostly guided by character, such a system would leave but few black sheep In concluding, it is to be wished that the London Act will be passed without delay and without "cobbling," like the quasi Chamberlain Bankruptcy Act, where family soil elements of properly unless made at least three years before sequestration, and bills of sale of chattels, merchandise, are , unions made one year before same, should necessarily become a general asset for all creditors The selling of bread by weight I hope to see passed in its entirety, and acted upon like Hamlet including the ghost. I am, ice. I " February 11. ' J. A. M'CARROLL.
