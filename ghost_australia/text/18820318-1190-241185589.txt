THE OLD MAN'S GHOST. Several days ago a celebratod spiritualist Came to Little Rock, and statad that before giving a publio entertainment he would give a seance, whore any number of a small invited oircle could call up the apirits ot their friends and converse with them. By mistake a man from down the river was admitted, a man whoso reputation for deeds of violence would not place his spirit above par in the soul market. After listening awhilo to rapping, horn-blow ing, and gauze veil materialisation, the bad man rose and said : "Say, Cap'n, wbar's the old man's ghost 1" " What old man ?" asked the medium. " My old man, tho governor. Call him up." " What is bis name!" " Tom Bealiok ; oall him up." "I don't think we are in cominnnication with him to-night." "What's the matter, wire down ?" "No, tho old gentleman i9 off on a visit." "Now, hero, just shut up your wardrobe and turn on your light. If yon don't give the old man's ghost a show, the thing shan't ri!n." "Wait ; I'll see if he'll come," said tho spiritualist. "If ho raps three times he is willing ; if only once, ho has other engage ments." A sharp rap sounded. "He is unwilling," continued the spiritua list. "Now, here," said the bad man, "that wan't my ole man'B knock. Why, ef he'd bit that table he'd splintered it. Call him up," and, drawing a revolver, tho affectionate son cast a - severe look on the medium. t "To tell the truth, I can't call him up." "Toll him that I want to see him. That'll letch him." "No, ho won't some; bat I beg ot yon to be patient. Wait ; ah, he will come presently. He is hero and desires to talk with you. He says that he is perfectly happy, and that he longs for the time when yon will be with him. He is one of the rulers in the spirit land." " Cap'n, you're the iuferoalist liar in Arkansas." " Why, so, sir ?" 11 Bonausnthfl nld man Is in tha eitv nrison. drnnkasafool."- â€” Little Rock Gazetto.
