The Congregational Union. A MEETDto in connection with tho annual conference of the Congregational Union was held last night in tho Grey street Congrega tional Churchj when there were a large num ber of delegates to the conference present, and a number of others. The Rov. T. J. Pepper presided, and the Rev. A. Sutherland preached a sermon Horn Acts i. o, ? ? nut ye shall receive power, after that tho Holy Ghost is come upon you.' The sermon was an impressive nnd appropriate ono to tho occasion, and went to show that tho power of the pastor as a preacher depended upon and was in un equal degree successful just as the pastor was imbued with the Spirit of God, and was supported by his people in the 6pirit. He deprecated tho con tentions in the church, and tho new mode in which certain ministers courted popularity â€” by dealing with contentious subjects and in pro mulgating new doctrinos. The church, he said, to be an influence in the world, must abide in the Spirit of Truth. The Rov. W. W. Watts then delivered a common address. The chahman announced that the conference would be opened this morning at 10 o'clook. The chairman of the union for the current year will deliver his address this evening at 7.30.
