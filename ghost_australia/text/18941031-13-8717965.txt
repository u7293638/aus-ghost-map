A GHOST STORY. BY 10 C. IN TWO PARTS. PART II. I looked curiously round our room as we entered. Pierre had told the servants to place a bed for me near his own, and two easy chairs drawn close to the bl tzing fire looked none the less comfortable because a table with glasses, a spirit stand, and it be. of "Jlelnchrinas" stood within easy reach Pierre's loves had been already ransacked, and foils and fencing masks lounge on the walls , pictures, books, and photographs scattered here and there, to make the room as much as possible like what it was when he inhabited it before his other for about an hour we sat smoking and talking, laughing over college quips, arguing on politics, and discussing his plans for the future Once I attempted to turn the conversation upon supernatural subjects and said I wondered whether we should be privileged to see the ghost that night but be seemed so upset and snubbed me so severely, and, I am afraid justly, for my bad taste in unnecessarily) forcing painful memories upon him, that I was glad to hold my tongue about the matter My unlucky wondering put a (constraint upon our conversation and soon we both went to bed, but m> brim was excited, and I could not sleep For a long time I lay watching the clouds scudding over the moon, and the gradually dying fire casting ghostly enough shadows round the room, while Pierre tossed uneasily on the bed beside me muttering to himself I felt instinctively that I was in the presence of a mystery, and, half afraid, half excited, I could with difficulty restrain myself from getting out of it is to see if the legendary, blood stain had re appeared upon the floor but I knew that to do so would probably woke Pierre and rouse his finger, and finally reason mind fatigue triumphed over imagination and I don d off to sleep Suddenly I woke gam with a start, and an undefinable conviction came over me that there was a third person in the room or approaching; it After assuring myself that I was awake and attempting to steady my nerves, I raised my head. The fire was almost out but there was light enough for me to see that, except for our selves, the room was empty I turned to speak to Pierre, and saw that he was sitting upright in his bed, his hands clenched upon his knees, the veins standing out like cords upon his forehead, his face turned towards the middle of the room, and his eyes, full of terror, coming into vacancy. " In the name of God, man, what are you looking at' I cried "in line are you frightened of" But he did not answer me As I followed once more the direction of his gaze I own that curious changes at ere taking place, and misty shapes appearing in the half darkness The room was the same, yet different A shadow) wall, stripped of pictures and ornaments, obscured but did not hide the actual wall behind it, and trunks and packing cases stood here and there upon the Door. I rubbed my eyes and looked again, when I became aware that there was a light that did not come from the fire, and suddenly the whole picture flashed upon me On the dressing table stood a lighted lamp, and near the middle of the room, cigarettLinhis mouth, wnsit)onnÂ¿inaii winding his watch with his eyes on the ground as though absorbed in thought My heart almost stopped beating, as from

that we had at last reached the foot of the ladder and stepped off it on to a stone floor assisting my companion to the ground in order that he should not tread just where I did The shaft widened out

him to inform him of our departure, and begged him not to trouble about ordering any conveyance for us, but to send on a few necessary articles of luggage by a train later in the day. I hesitated a little in propounding the next step in my plan, which was that shortly after my departure I should write to my host telling him that Pierce was set ously ill for some level , a little later I should regretfully inform him of his death, and send a forged death certificate. I must confers that my scruples about the procedure largely rested upon the risk of discovery, but the old man thanked me so for vently that I stilled them, and determined to see the business through If I reflected, his grandfather believed the news of his death and was satisfied with the certificate, no one else was likely to make awkward mi. innes I looked at my watch and saw that it was 6 o'clock The servants would soon bestirring, and it was imperative that I should catch my tram and that no one should see that I left the house alone Going up to the unfortunate old man, who had collapsed into a chair with his face buried in his hands, I said Now, sir, I must go Peri) ips you will kindly come with me to the door and at me but I know the road to the station But before I say good bye there is one thing I should be glad if you would tell me our grandson I believe, was engaged to a young lady who died shortly after he went to 1 England Can catch! me if after his departure she was ever in this room' ' "yes, he said, "I had known her from childhood, and was as fond of her as if she were my daughter She came to me to beg my forgiveness for Pierre I could not grant it then but I remember telling her that he had left behind in his room a photograph of himself, and that I did not want it I believe she went to get it But why do you ask ' I replied that it was mere curiosity on my part, for which I asked his pardon, but thought to myself that the cause of her illness would not have puzzled me as it did the doctors and wondered if 1 here could have been as ignorant as he professed of what he had done to make her refuse to marry him She probably did not see all that I did, but upon her standing in that room with his photograph in her hand. there must have flashed some glimpse of the truth In a few minutes I had left the house Next day I was in London, and a fortnight later wrote to inform his grandfather of Pierre s death from typhoid fever He had few friends or acquaintances at Oxford, but, to those who new him, I told the same story, and as far as I know it was never questioned 1 never blamed myself for the he The chateau has changed hands, as the family became extinct with my host, who died a few years after my visit The secret door has apparently never been discoure 1 and no more rumours of the house bring haunted have ever reached ray ears Hut to this day I smile somewhat bitterly to myself when I hear an by young jackass boosting that he does not believe in ghosts
