DAIBT NOTES. Devonshire oreasi, a correspondent is in formed who nBks. foe dbtailb as to making this delicacy, is produced this way Al'hon tho milk comes from.tha cow: it is strained., sot out in the broad: milk dlshos used far creaming be fore the- separator came in,, and: left for 12 hourB, or until it becomes quite cold in. tho : dairy. Then it is set on a kifehon range in the '.dishes,, or the latter are- placed. in.boiHng. water, until the milk rcaolroa nearly boiling brat. It is important that tho milk should only just begin to Bhow avery slight movement on the surface— Bcarooly a Bimmor— and thou bo at once taken from tho fire and set in tho dairy to cool down. In 12 hours the cream will be all on tho surfoeo of the milk in a thick body. So thick is the oream that many Devon milk maids remove it with tho hands, but tho plan rooommonded is to take it off with a skimmer, and this is tho celebrated Devonshire orolotted cream. It will keep Bwcot even during tho heat, of tho present season from 21 to 30 hours :in a cool situation. Immense quantities of. this- -cream are sent; rill over England; arid evori into IValcs and Scotland,, by parcel posf hi smZ!5 when most in season: ' It is sent in ' little. fr tH PUrpo3e'' whicl> est very THE.snLKiNO tests; at the. dairy show -v u tbe Agriculttiml Hall; Emderi; . were; briefly, reported in 1 wock's Leader;, and we nmv. submit thoofficM voport presented to the- British Dairy Furnierf Association hy the secreta.y, Mr. Ci Matthews, as a sample of what such a report should' be, and in the hope that the negligee L ! of the recent "Royal " eompotitien in m i Mr-M«tthewsgi a list of tho highest number of points obiffine ! by each breed, of , milk competing in. the milk, ing trials rem 1888 to 1893 inclusive.

BREED HETOBU for the eight years, as I will: be Been' by the foregoing,, has been beaten I only in tho Kerry and Dexter class, which lias I , epmpated in only. four, trials during the. period. 1 But tlio latest trial was remarkable for the rich; I nnra of some of the cows' milk,anduotably that I ortno prfzo- vmning Shortlioxna and one Dexter I cow. The-. only-Tory high record in yield of I tnilk.among the prize- wiuuors was 71.3, lb I ;givon by Mr. Morry's Magpie, a Holstcin, but I : nor. miik was- so- poor (containing only 2 9 net I : ceni; of fat) that she lost 10 of tho 140.1 points I shc .would'have obtained without the deduction I madewlion milk' has under 3 percent, of fat; I and was: awarded' 130;1 points. Mr. Merry's I Shorthofn-'gavo 56:2 lb. of milk 22 days after I atlring, or 7: lb; T oz. loss that Mr: Long's cross; bred:;, but tlie percentage of fat in tho former I cow's milk was 5.2, which is exceptionally high I for a cow of any large breed, and the other I solids wore 9i3 per cent. According to the I table o£ details; Mr. Merry's third prizo; I : Dorothy;, a. crossbred, in the mixed class, garo I 47.1 lb; of oven rioher mUk;. as it ib credited I with 5.5' per oont: of frit and'O.G of other solids; I but tho actual woights of fat aud other solids I came out lower than those of tho Shorthorns. I The second and third Shorthorns gave milk con- I taining 4.1 and 4.5 per cent; of fat respectively, I pereentagM higher than have been common I among, Shorthorns in. previous- years. There is I nothbig remarkablo in tho richnees of the milk | of. the Jeraoy prize winners, as 4.5 to 5.5 per I oont., of fat- has often been beaten by the breed ; | but 4(17 lb of milk yielded by Dr. lVatncy'i I Opale, and 40.8 lb. of rioher milk from Lord I Rothsahild's- Beauty, are- creditable records. I Two of the: Doxtor-Korriea did remarkably I wolL Mr. "Woodiwiss's Rod Rose gave 38.8 Ib. I milkof moderate quality, 145 days after calving ; I wliilo Mr. Robertson's Bridget MClnskey, 58 I days after ealving, gavo 31.7 lb. of milk, con- I taming the extraordinary percentage of 114 of I fat; It was regrotted afterwards that this cew I had not been entered for the butter test. I The butter test was, of' oourao, the test of i tho competition. Mr. Shophcrd's Shorthorn I cow, Dairy Model (of which we givo an illuatra- I tion.on page 12), after being 52 days in milk, I gave 48 lb. 14J oz. in a day, yielding the great I weight of 3 lb. 2 oz. of butter. This result has I boon beaten attho dairy show only once, in the I ouso of Mr. Drutton's first prize Baron's Pro- gress, in 1879, which gavo 37.0 lb. of -milk after I being 113 days in milk, and 3 lb. 5 oz. of butter. I Dairy Model'a butter ratio was 15.01, and that I of: Baron's Progress was 11.3. The yield of butter was at tho rate of 21 lb. 14 oz. per week in tho case of Dairy Model, and at tlio rate of 23 lb. 3 oz. in thot of Baron's Progress. But I ; Daisy Belle,, also a Shorthorn, did remarkably I well in the- butter teBt; giving 3 lb. 1 oz. of I butter, in tho- day from 55 lb. 124 oz. of milk, or H -at tho rato of 21 lb. 7 oz. per week, and allowing I a huttor ratio of 18;2L Two other Shorthoras H gave 2 lb. 12 oz. of butter each, and the whole I of tho-17 tested' averaged 2 lb. 1 oz. of butter, a I result novor approached before. In the Jersey butter tost Dr. AVatney's first prizo O;ialo came I out with 471b. lOloz. of milk and 2 lb. 10J oz. of butter;, or l ib., of butter, to 17.7 lb. of milk. H Lord Rothschild's Beauty was a closo second with 40 lb. 12 oz. of mUk, 2 lb. 10 oz. of butter, and a: butter ratio of 15.52. But tbo most remarkablo. resulta in tho Jeraoy teat weretbeso given by Lord Roth'sohild's third prize Regita H Sultana 2nd, which, 103 days after calviugi gave 30 16. 8 oz. of milk, yielding 2 lb. 9j «- H of butter, or lib. of butter to 11.83 lb. of milk. M This; ratio was not approached in any other ease but that of a liad Poll whioh gave only 9 lb. 8 oz, of milk and 12J ox. of butter, and is them. fore not Wortli: considering. Tho first and second' prize oows iliad boon only 30 or 34 oaf ' in milk .respectively, and Rogina Sultana 2n ' would liavo beon placed 'first if points hadbeffi allowod.for timo since calving in tlio butter twti asin tlio mjlking trials.
