TJJE TURF IN NEW SOUTH WALES: A.J. 0. RAND WICK MEETING, 1869. - Saturday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, 4th, : 9th, 10th, and 11th September. Fiest Day—September 4. |_.brom Australasian. \ lne giones or tne Derby Day nave in ne way departed. Beautiful weather, a large and fashionable company, fine fields of Horses, with closeaud exciting racing, inaugurated the open ing-dayat- Rand wick, - and-the campaign of the j ! season'69 and '70, has commenced under aus-1 pices the most encouraging. The drop scene; fell last autumn on .the meeting of theL Australian • Jockey Club, after -a most, successful year's,1 racing. .The best horse; Australia ever produced, j then made his farewell bowjto the turf, leaving behind him a name that few of his kind /everj gained-in any; part of, the world; and inhis.'new; sphere of action as lord of the harem "af ;TocaI, | we. predict] that Ms. children's children will shed j lustre on the,glorious deeds of their forefather,; andTtbatthe-Barb-will be remembered as -long; as there is a "Ruff" or. a Stud Book in exis-j tence. (]There:is]aniold-saying,that ".thereHarej as good fish, in-the sea .as ever . came out of it,"' but,when sbalfwe see the. Demon's like again ?! j Is there "one amongst ithe rising generation ?j Time alone! can tell. Butthiswe can safely say,; 'that for good looks,-ifine. condition, .and perform-; ances,;-s0 fat as-they: (gOj-.:'ther.e is.lno.. fall-! iiig .off -in " the breed.: of.the. x Austra-I -lian '-horse,, as . the! majority ]of 1 the .field! which this day contested for that.coveted honor —the blue'ribbon of the turf—shows.;; Victoria has fonyears tried to wrest both the. Derby and St. Leger from -.NewISouth ."WaleB,. and; .up to the present time- once only haA she been sue; cessfulj and that in one of .the most .memorable contests knowhi'in the-annals'/ of]Australian racing,r]whenFishhook cut ..the./Barb.idown like mincemeat, in the autumn; of. :1866.^; after a struggle for^ mastery the_ like of wMchhas sel | dom been witnessed-'on.any racecourge, and few horses would ^have come. out'scatheless .from sO desperate a cut-throat "game,- far. less, victorious, as the great son of Fisherman: and Marchioness did on that occasion^' Last-year when the sons of Ferryman, also a- scion, of. the . house which the hero of a .hundred fights has'founded.;in I these colonies, made their appearance on . the Fleinington course, Victorians felt proud of the youngsters, and the close and exciting contests between the sons of Juliet and Gaslight gave them unbounded, confidence..in. being able, to j gain fresh laurels on the'green sward -of Rand j wick. The struggle over the Champagne j ! Stakes showed that these colts met foes worthy of their steel, for the game manner-the, Fop came to the rescue when Ms stable companion i Barbarian, compounded to Lamplighter,;jyas sometMngdicr remember; -and afterwards in the j | Nursery Handicap, when the black son of Sir Hercules and .Young Gulnare, receiving 10 lbs. ! in weight, took the- bit in his mouth when the flag-fell, and never gave the Victorian pair a ghost, of a chanc.e. These.. varying, results. ren dered the Randwick Derby, a race of great in terest and speculation during -the recess, and it was not forgotten how Moselle polished, off the Demon's brother at Homebush, seemingly show ing, a,line whereby the daughter of Cossack ought.to he considered. one of the cracks of the season. Nor ha3 the high, reputation which was given to Detective by Ms .clever owner pre vious to Ms intended , appearance. as a two year-old been lost .sight of, and the fol lowers of. .'the ; lucky, stable were not loth to believe in . the _ prowess. tof this, chesmit son of New "Warrior., These- may be said to" have received-the greater-share ;of public support in the betting market, and as the day drew nigh the training, ground at Rand wick saw constant crowds of anxious visitors, watch ing the preliminary preparation-of the horses being " put through the mill." Idle Boy, also a son of New Warriorj was not'only fancied for his beautiful shape and highbred appearance, but for the manner-he used to get through his work, with thaif-cleSyer hack Mr. Baldwin had provided Holm'es 'to act' the schoolmaster. Agnes, tooji.'was no.t; friendless,as it-was ob served that i!Wanrior,- in spite' of her- lameness,, had enough to .do'to .shake her off in her gallops, and the game manner she used to struggle to best him' was a convincing proof , she was a ster ling daughter of that game son of Hercules, -Yattendon, who -had often proved the worth of the blood wMch. flows, in, the, veins of so illus trious a family.' Lamplighter had most friends,' however,, of the lot, during the winter months, until rumors,-a few weeks-hack,,were afloat of there being a " screw loose," when he'fell from Ms high estate of 'first'favorito^ and his plaice wasrtaken by Barbarian,- but Ms tenure of office was' of short' duration, as "one fine morn ing his owner.'-, publicly! declared- that it wasi --" all -r ,up -t; a" • tree" with his black colt, who,' "accordingly,'"took "aback seat," and although-he did show out for a few days taking: his melancholy walks7 before the pen was put through' his"! name! oh the SOthiof last month, neither lakers1 nor layers/cared,'to meddle with such a dangerous customer in ;so sorry a,plight, -There .were .many, loiig "faces over his downfall, as;" barring accidents, his friends ccinsidPred him a certAmty.l /. For; a few days favoritism was in abeyance, :as there was a gieat1''diversity of opinion who should ; >'hfi. prime'-minister:-;but.r;; when- the owner of Lamplighter came, like a young man | "from~the7COTintry,-he very--soon—dispelled the illusion as to there being a screw loose,'as he sent'itheh.colt] along at; such .a; pace re assurediihis' .friends . and "opened.'the ..eyes;of unbelievers,., t'and ton j days , pr ' before1 the race, so great was the rush- to.-cf' get- on" /that the bookmakers had to: put on the screw,"and raise.the rate* of their.discount; to- 2. to jL .

A good line was, however,: nightly j drawn ..as to. how the " wind lay" with; re gard to the favorites. There was little specu lation" i'pn the Trial Stakes, for which |Or Ville was= the most decided favorite, !and. /the/great uncertainty that hung over Barbelle's.l starting/for the. President's Handicap, wMch | looked i moral for her, prevented many from operating until they saw who would put in an .appearance . !at the^ppst. The Innkeepers' 'Stakes ahd-fthe Epsom-Handicap were' treated , in the Jame: Way; the off era7 about the last irace beinig ;100'tp'rI5; on; the^field. -The Derby'and Metropolian absorbed nearly all tbe betting; /with-Tinr-iWhiffier ait 7 fto 2; Barbelleat 6 to 1; the 'Earl at 8 to 1, for the favorites/fori the latter event: Such was the -'state of'/affairs up I tplast night.

If the dust was a nuisance, the effluvium from Moore-park as we passed was anything' but_ a nosegay. However, people willingly submit, as the improvements made and. about being carried out' will, render the' road:to Eandwick in „two qe'".'three '•years. a'pleasantv'-drive through afflandsome- domain planted ; with Norfolk Island pines "and rare shrubs,^ also parapets, terraces,'' 'parterres, and artificial lakes, instead' of; [finoitghf sand covered with - scrub and fern. On our i arrival' oh the course we found;a goodly com-; pany assembled. The grand stand was wellj filled, 'and tbe 'lessees of. the St. Leger and j Derby stands had no reason.to complain of the patronage awarded—them. The Vice-Regal corner was occupied by the* Governor, the Earl of Belmore, and his Countess, surrounded by a large circle of the Slite of Sydney, and the 'sprinkling'of-ladies, although .presenting a sad comparison, to V the'. " gay- r and festive scene at hlemingtoh,^- ; Was '. :'.larger ' than - -' is usually seen' at the J A.J.C. meetings., Punctml to time, the ever-welcome sound of; the bell announced that the proceedings of the] day had commenced, and that the racing season' was opened. At 1 o'clock five candidates for, the Trial Stakes went out to open the ball, Mr. j .Tait.'stDrville'being entrusted with the~greaterj i portion of the betting money at the short odds', rof-3 lxr2, although the Baron came just before, ;Jeaving the paddock, and was backed at 2 to l.j The race was a good one, with a close finish,; half a length separating-the first three. Juanita j made the running, when the Baron, followed, by Orville, came most , gamely invtlim end,; re-j suiting in favor of Mr. "Winch's .ibrse^^-Ninb went out to contest the President's'Handiioap,; with Barbelle at even money against.'•the field.; Notwithstanding 'the hue and cry'about the weights,?thetrun wa3 a very fine one, as;,the lot; dceptrvfell- together all the - way;--'ending^ m ;|a dead -heat between Barbelle and Sir, William.'

Of course, af ter luncheon there was a large muster in the saddling pad dock to scan the- Derby candidates; uid_ the. four favorites had their several partisans "about them in. crowds..
