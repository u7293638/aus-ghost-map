POETRY. ON GLOAMING GRASSES. The light is low upon the land, . The wings of dusk are nigh, Upon the gloaming grasses stand Together, you and I. Why do we wait together so? I would we were apart, For you may give me more of woo, . And break again my heart. Yet, low as sunset in the hills So low ray pulse for thee, Thy glance no vein with rapture fills No passion-ecstasy. Temp'rate as shadows coolly lain About the earth's dark breast. So do I meet thy gaze again, Untroubled, and at rest. Why should I see reproaching eyes? No Phoenix heart is mine, From dead-white ashes up to rise Responsively to thine. Why should I mourn to-night for thee? — I ween no pity lay " Within your faithless breast for me, The night you went away. Love ! I have prayed for us to stand Just as we stand to-night, And yearning so, your touching hand Had filled my soul with light. But praying days have passed for me, And weepmg nights grown still, Till freely now is given thee . Forgiveness and goodwill. Nay, breathe no lie upon my faith, The heart you hold was true; Who bears the blame, that passion's wraith With wan eyes looks at you? Who boars the blarme that I do hold. Spent fires where flames did start, For you did turn the embers cold, When you did break my heart. So in the sundown shadows take My answer to your claim, — Sweet love-in- ashes will not wake, . Howe'er you call her name. When gloaming grasses gather dew In some far evening's light — remember then the ghost you slew, That walked the earth to-night. Jennings Carmichael.
