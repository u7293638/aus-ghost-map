SUNDAY FUNERALS. THE UNDERTAKER. Of all the days within the week. He dearly loves but one day. And that's the day that comes betwixt The Saturday and Monday. For that's the day he works the most, When other tradesmen sorry, Each Philistine gives up the ghost To suit Tom, Dick, and Harry. But no one needs his plaintive sobs, He has no class to get him'; Death saddles him with Sunday jobs, , And union tradesmen swear him. The fashionable upper crust Conspire to die on Mondays; '? But it embalmeR the maker's dust To bury it on Sundays. , This Sabbath desecration rules All CIOSBOB of our nation; Some think the Bible in State schools' Might work a reformation. And when the undertaker' dies He joins the great procession Of Sunday pomp, while myriad eyes Feast on the strange digression. Yip, "Boa."
