All sorts and suet, aria species, llavla^ heard that _ uM*§ Hams,- -W, (-old- lady tbat -Used to -inrtt^«le Wdttulapf the literary world, I inaQett point of seeing her with a view of .??? «DO0eeding her, with your permission, aa a r^jsontribator to the columns of your very i largely circulated newspaper. The old ',, lady was qoita agreeable, and gave me asm*! bints which I intend to act upon, Tit—First, always to write the truth ! »a*fl«jondlj, ? feMio jay utmost to expose E^saaytlufifl in 4be chape of sham or ham bog, and-thirdly, not to be bought by any v, one* or to prostrate my opinions to please *-'f w|«wun Doay or party, but to wnte in a thorough independent spirit. Th&fs; /jqy introduction, sir. and I don't think I ^ , need aisy any more concerning myself, as the less use made of the personal pro noun the more sensible of the writer. All fcrftasfcfidtoi your readera is to treat me as well, and to receive me as well, as Betsy ,,. Harris was reoeived during the three \- yean she, with the help of Nezer, scat ; tend her ideas, and my old darce, \- Margery, and I will do our utmost to ' Bopply their place. Well, by this time most peop?e have s'JWH&M;* their holiday making and once more nave settled down into the stern . realities of business cares and worldly \- anxieties. And there is not the slightest * doubt that trade mid business will ira 1 prove, so that at the end of this year the contrast between '84 and '85 will be a Ir ^wnnigh ftiarked one. I must congratu late youf air, upon having commenced the Ne» Year in a sensible manner by re duotnar the nrioe of the Bdniif. and as Margery says, ' She ought to go now . tnore than ever her did,' 'The New Year's Day sports were un doubtedly a success, but Old Humphrey couldn't help thinking, when he was wit ? nesting the presentation of prizes, at the Institute Hall, tbat young fellowB who * are endowed with a superabundance of , animal power are very handsomely re warded lor showing it at times. Not that there is any harm in these manly sports, but when literary attainments and pursuits of the mind receive such small rewards in comparison, why it just proves that the lower faculties will eventually predom inate above the higher. But what can i you expect, sir, when a scholarly clergy r man attempts to throw cold water on young men attempting to improve their lt jnpdejretandings by what he terms showy accomplishment^. 'Margery says there is auch^ thing as pedantry in the world after ^e greatrire TGng still reigns in his glonanp'MajesJty in .Adelaide, and again has the Academy of Music been a victim to tiie tyrannical' wrath of the monarch. ,JfljraOT\Jhii|B» it's, about time his * Hajestys freaks 'and humours should re ceive a peremptory cheek. Its all very ; well for the' Water? King to be playing ' -with its nral after the damage is done, out anotner powerful monarch is required i':\ to.hunioqt the secret ' allies of the hot i tempered tyrant. Theatrical managers :--[«nd actors seem, especially, to fall foul of ': 'the ragqig demon, and it is to be hoped '?' help will be forthcoming to, at least, assist ..them to .rise from the penniless wreck . they hare been brought to. ''!' ^'JwiPTf in coming down Murray _--;»treetthe other day, nearly lost her way. ? .-What with the glare of the sun and the ;f clpudB.of dust that was blowing, fiUing :, the«hops, spoiling the goods, and choking '''op the windpipe of the passer-by, Mar . i fferv vu fkintlv nhaeremi. lilra n sfindnnr i til aW ?

Just then the wind gave an ??'?extra breathe and -carried the point of ;'';Margery'8 umbrella rirfjt into the ribs of . . a gentieman, who, like Margery, had come to a stand-still and was trying to V find his way to the Council Chambers. . Whether it was the worthy Mayor, or the ^.l^kitite councillor, or the high-flown councillor, or the crotchetty councillor, or 1 the urbane cotibcUlor, or the energeticcoun „ cillor, or.^lic innocent Town Clerk, or the i Cheeky Inspector, Margery won't be cer . tain, but she could tell it was one of tbeto, because the dost went with him. After tbat, sir, no more duet, but a pro per use of the water. (Not ao dusty, says The Port Pirie newspaper, after many yearBtoCmphill urork, has had to give up the ghost for want or sufficient patronage ?? and help from the townspeople, and the ,, proprietor in making his last editorial . remarks in astraightforward and energetic -manner, not to be expected from one quitting the troubles and trials of a weary *d^ffyf^Mnb doubt truthfaily.

So our Town Council have had their \- iannn*l inspeptjop, and from all acponnts some good results are likely to accrue vSEOmu. it» oertamly quite time that \- «r»waeeta should be provided on the Kx ^WonOroundi, as there (are many ffho ?*B«**prtOfcavea quiet corner away from ? the guttering crowd, and whose means ^fcilt not allow them to occupy a seat in the Orand Stand on all occasions. Mar gery saysthe dosen't care for going there, \--a»?people might mistake her for one of the '-ttpper-teni whoever they may be. But I ft^'iS ',M«ienr, we're all upper 'ten in this oolony. LeastirayB all who pay their way, and Jive in aa honest, straigthforward manner ; it don't matter about blood and all that sort of thing here — though there are a few what would like to have a feudal system out here, but it won't go, and besides, its only the ginger breads with gilt on what wants that ; they arn't ladies or gentlemen, bless your heart 1' Margery just gave one of her sniffit of satisfaction in reply, and the sub ject vanished, I've been reading the pipers contain ing1 the reports of the doings of those Spiritualists in Adelaide, and must say I feel very much disgusted at the conduct of some of the young men that belong to an Association that are supposed to set good examples in everything. In this case their conduct was unmanly, con temptible, and a disgrac3 to the body with whom they are connected, and if that's a sample of Christian young men then ideas have very much changed since I was a boy. Because, then, we did'ntgo forming expensive associations, and be making a business of it, sir, but we went about our business in a quiet sort of way, lending a hand where it was required, and not. making a song over it, and holding ourselves up as pictures of goodness, and all that sort of thing. But times are changed now, sir, and it all means busi ness and money making, and if you don't wear your religion, Btuck on your sleeve, you arn't the real thing,
