POETRY. THE HAUNTED LAXD. A Perth's. Abont this land moves many a sad-eyed ghost, And there is found of weeping uU night long And sound* by day of melancholy ?nn^; TTeird is the land, and beautiful, almost; But wrecks of miphty ship* Mrcw thick the coast, Though now tho r«ea looks innocent of wrong, And low, soffc waves the deep 5ea-<av«?n)n throng, Wh«rc titcus iinp, and Death waits at hi* x>ost. JHse, ri<c, my sou], that wo mny strive with fate And flee the baneful beauty which delay* Ua through Yrnrm, xreepinjr nijjhts and hcctic I days: Spread sail and stcur, >rlmro fresh lito may uwnit, But uh« trhat -n-oi-de sigh down thesa trackloas | ways— WTmt wank bat these: 'Too late—Tod lute—Too lute V —£rf thf late PhiVf fiour!:e jlfartto", tit hrfcptu'itnt.
