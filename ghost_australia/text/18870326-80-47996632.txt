Meadow Sweet. In Summerfields the meadow sweet Spreads its white bloom around tba feet Of those who pass in love or play Thc golden hours of holiday, And heart to answering heart can beat Where grows the simple meadowsweet. Embosomed in some cool retreat The long seed grasses bend to meet Thc stream that murmurs as it flows Songs of f orget me not and rose ; The filmy haze of noon tide beat Is faint with scenes of meadow sweet. Ah, love 1 do you know meadow sweet 1 ? Does some pale ghost of passion licet Adown this dreary lapse of years, So void of love, so full of fears ? fioine ancient, far off echo greet The once loved name of meadow sweet ? An Ingenious Swindle.-A swindle recently detected is conducted as follows : A cheque, say for ten guineas, is obtained from a depositor at a bank, and a blank cheque exactly like the filled-in cheque is secured. The two cheques are laid one npon the other so that the edges are exactly even, ilota cheques arc'tlien torn irregularly across, and in such a way that the signature on the tilled cheque appears on one piece and the amount, and name of the payee on thc other. Tb« cheques having been held together whilu being torn, of course one piece of the blank cheque will exactly lit the other piece of the filled cheque. The swindler then fills in one piece of the blank cheque with the name of the payee and the amount to suit himself, say one thousand pounds, takes it with the piece of genuine cheque containing the sig- nature of the bank, and explains that thc 'cheque was accidentally torn. The teller can put the pieces together, and as they fit exactly, the chances are that bc will think the pieces are parts of thc same cheque, »nil ? ; become a victim to the swindle. The trick, of course, suggests its own Temedy. The teller should refuse to pay any cheque that is mutilated. 1 . . .__
