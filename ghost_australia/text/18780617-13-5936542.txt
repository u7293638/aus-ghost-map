MONDAY, JUNE 17, 18T8. The Bishop of MELBOURNE has recently addiessed a cncularlettei to his cleigy on the subject of íeligious education in the diocese It will be remembered that m August last a meet- ing A\as held in the Athcnreum, at which the Chief Justice took the chan, for the puipose of consideiing what stops should be taken to piovide leligious liistiuctioii foi the children of the church Dr MOORHOUSI made a foi cible speech on the occasion, and did hi" best, as he always does, to infuse some bhaio of his enthusiasm into his heaters Ile blamed no man for what had been done ni tins colony with legiud to the exclusion of cveiytlung but seculai teaching fiom the state schools Like a sensible min, he frankly accepted tho situation, and deprecated USLICSS discussion ÜB lo Us natuie by an emphatic, " What lias boon dono lu " been done " At the samo time, til right rev gentleman impreasod mos forcibly on those present tho vital in portanco of tho question thoyhad mt to consider-a question besido whio matters of "taxation and politic!

Heads, the batteries to be fully manned, and to endeav our to hit tho v essel i he proposi tion is a startling one, and Mr Berry was not at iirst disposed to sanction it, but since then Captain Mandeville has seen the lion {.entleman, and lias overcome his sciiiples, and the sensational event is likely to come oft within the next fortnight The object Captain Mandeville has in \ievv is to test the value of the works at the Heads, and ho points out that this can be done by using the 801b guns, and according to calculation their shot ought not to penetrate the 8m iron plating of the Cere bus The vessel will be sunk to her proper fighting level, and will be stripped for action, and therefore no serious damu¿e is antici- pated from the 80 pounders even if she is hit, but Captain Mandeville is of opinion that she w ill not bo touched On the other hand, the 80 pounders are magnificent guns, noted for accuracy of range, and altogether aro liner weapons than a comparatively few years no0 were to bo found in forti fications anywhere Only the other day a rock outside of Point Nepean, and 3700 yards distant, was taken as a target, and was hit the second shot The chance the Cerberus has is that she is a inov ing and not a stationary object, and consequently between her and the targets ordinarily used there is all the difference between a pot shot and a shot at a bird on the wing lho 12 ton guns (300 pounders) which ha\e been lately placed lnpositionnearthelowerlighthouso.arenotto be fired, becatiBC if they did strike the vessel they might either sink, diBablo, or seriously cripple her, guns of these dimensions having been proved to have a penetrating power suflicicnt to pierce 8Jin of iron plating at a distance of 1,000 yards However, the 80 pounders are the readier to handle, and if they do not hit, it will be a fair inference that the 300 pounders w ould not bo more for túnate Under this arrangement the Cerberus will have to face the fire of the four 80 pounders, and such of the 80 pounders us will bo mounted at the time on Point Nepean, where men are still working putting the guns in position. Recent experience, it may be mentioned, has shown that the weak point of vessels of the Cerberus type is their decks, winch are comparatively weak, and it is worthy of note that both the batteries winch will fire on the Cerberus are placed at a commanding eleva tion W hether tins point has been duly con- sidered we are not aware Captain Mande ville proposes to give the batteries every chance, and will come through the passage in open daylight at medium speed, while an enemy would probably attempt a dash m the gloom of early morning or of ev emng, with a strong tide and under n full head of steam Neither, as a matter of course, vv ill he use Ins own 400 pounder guns, with which ho is tolerably confident he could silence the bat tenes in a very brief period 1 he question how far it is possible to run a gauntlet when the sea passage is not obstructed by torpedoes is an open one, and Captain Mandeville takes the sailor's view of the matter, which is that a dozen guns will never stop a dashing officer from exchanging shots vvith them in an at tempt to force the entrance 'Colonel Ander son has been communicated with and directed to tell off Ins best mon to man the bat- teries, and the Cerberus w ill be got ready dar ing the ensuing w eek, or the w eek afterwards There would seem to be one objection, which may not have occurred to Captain Mande v file and the Chief Secretary, in this matter, and that is, that in case of a fatal accident on board the Cerberus m consequence of tho firing, the artilleryman who fired the shot would be lmblo to a charge of man- slaughter A bill to amend the Electoral Act has been drafted, and is nowunder the consideration of the Cabinet Themeasure «understood to rec- tify some of the boundaries of which the Ministerial party complain, such as the inclu- sion of Jolimont within the Richmond elec- torate, and the separation of Carlton from the more democratic district which it adjoins It also terminates tho system of giving votes to non resident property holders The draft bill has not, however, been finally dealt with by Ministers, nor is it certain that it will bo submitted to the Assembly next session, as the Constitutional Reform Bill will be the first measure proposed, and in the ev ent of the Council not accepting theGovernmcnt scheme all new legislation is likely to be hung up pending the appeal to England The Minister of Lands, in his speech at Heathcote on Saturday, stated that it was tho intention of the Government to submit no railway proposals to Parliament, save the proposals rejected last session, until they had carried their scheme of constitutional reform The Kilmore people wero informed later in the day that no national scheme of railways would bo completo unless their town was included, and that tho scheme to be expected from the Government was ono which would connect every centre of popu- lation and production with the seaboard Lieutenant-Colonel Scratchley, R E , hav- ing returned from Adelaide, proceeded ovor land to Sydney on Saturday on business con- nected with the defences of that colony It is understood that Mr E W Crossly has been selected as the Ministerial candi- dato for South Gipps Land Messrs Pincham and Yeomans have visited tho district on behalf of the National Reform League, and have reported in favour of this gentleman, and he lins received a message intimating that the report has been endorsed by tho Chief Secretaij Mr M Lellan is reported as holding successful meetings in every part of the district The Minister of Public Works, after con- sultation with his colleagues, has determined to reduce the rate of wages given at the St Kilda and Carlton relief works, from 6s. and 6s. 6d. a day to 5s.
