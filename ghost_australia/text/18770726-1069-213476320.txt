A sniull dotuobmont of Russian soldiors, com manded by Lioutouau t Dubssohiff, uocouipauiod by tho commander of tlio Iiouinauiau flotilla, Major Murgesou, loft tlio northorn shore of tlio Danubo iu u number of small bouts, uud pro- oooded towards tlio Point Potru Fotoi, bolow Muobin, and opposito Ibraila, at wliioh point thoro was stationed a largo Turkisd monitor. Tho night wus vory dark, and thoy mauagod to surround tho monitor boforo botug discovered by tho Turkish sontrios on board. Tlioy woro oballongod, nnd " Who goos thoro" raog out on tbo night air. Major Murgosen replied in Turkish, " Friends," Tho Turks, evidently uot satisfiod, oommonood flriug in tho direction of Matohin, not knowing whoro tbosO boats wore. During tlio firing, sovoral of tho Rus sian soldiers, under tho diroctiou of Lieutenant Dubasoheff, plungod into tho water, swam siloutly to tho hull of tho irouolud vessel, and plaood tho deadly torpodo in closo oontuot with tho bottom of tho monitor. Aftor tbo destruc tive inaohiuo had been socuroly fastouod, and tlio wiro of an olootrio battory had boon acou- ratoly adjusted, tho raon retired to tho neigh boring shore of tho rivor, uud at half-past 3 in tho morning tho monitor was blown iuto thu air, with all tho oflicora uud orow. Tho explo sion wus lorrifio ; and as nothing is said of tha orow beiug suvad, it is supposed that all on board porisbed with tho vossol. Tho cool dotorinination with whioh this fearful ontor- priso was successfully ourried out, spooks for itself. Tho futo of tho second Turkish monitor ulroady sout to tho bottom of tho Dauubo witli all on bourd, shows how futilo is tho expecta tion that gunboats can . maintain tho mastery of u rivor linod with hostilo butteries, fillod with onomios as resoluto as tbo mon wlioso doods aro reoorded above. Tho name of tho monitor destroyed was tho Dar Matriu."
