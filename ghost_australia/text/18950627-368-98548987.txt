Whittier and Spiritualism. I WOensE whether if I could see a real ghost I should believe my own senses. I do sometimesn feel very near to dear ones who have left ma-perhaps they are with me then. I am sure they would be if it were possible. Of one thing I feel sure: Some thing outside of myself speaks to me, and holds me to duty, warns, reproves, and approves. Itis good, for it requires me to be good; it is wise, for it knows the teoughts and interests of the heart. It is to me a revelation of God and of His character and attributes, the one important fact before which all others seem insignifleant. I have seen little or nothing of what is called spiritualism; I do not think its fruits have always been good; but the best things may be abused and counterfeited. I wish there was a possibility of knowing what it really is. -Harbinger of Light.
