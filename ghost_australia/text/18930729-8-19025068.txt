EOAD TEUSTEES. (To the Editor of the Maitland Mercury.) Sir.-Kindly favour me with a space in the columns of your valuable journal to pass a few remarks regarding the unjust management of public money placed in the hands of certain road trustees not one hundred miles from Branxton. It appears to me that " underground engineering" is adopted by a particular class of individuals in order to assist certain favourites, and thereby gain their own sordid ends. If read money be entrusted to persons t) expend in a legitimate, economical, and beneficial way, why do they not call for tenders when it b ecomes necessary to have portions of the public thorough- fares repaired ? Echo answers, why ? Why ia work given to men " juBt landed" because of their nationality ? And why, I ask, do road trusts under a hypocritical disguise give customers and house tenants the option of obtaining contracts without calling public competition P I leave the questions to an enlightened public to answer for themselves, and also whether snch actions do not warrant a searching investigation. No other persons but particular friends have the ghost of a chance of obtaining road contracts while such trickery is allowed to go on. Let those who are entrusted with the expenditure of money on public works act legally and honourably, and " do unto others as they would others do unto them," then they might escape acrimonious criticism, and receive that respect due to all straightforward men. Let them bear in mind that Honour and Bharae from no condition rise, Act well your part, there all tue honour lies. Thanking you, Mr. Editor, in anticipation, I am, RUSE CONTRE RUSE. Branxton, 26th July, 1893._
