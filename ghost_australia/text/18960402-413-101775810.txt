I Discoveries in Photo I graphy. APROPOS of recent discoveries in the pho tographic science, Mr. VV. Inglis Rogers is Baid to have succeeded in obtaining genuine photographs of images impressed on the retina of the eye. The experimenters looked steadily at a postage stamp in strong light for oi.e minute, and then transferred his gaze to a photographic plate, in nonactimio light, for 20 minutes. When the plate was developed it gave a picture in outline' to which the namo of "psychegram" has been given. On this subject-or a coordinate one-the Pharmaceutical Journal suggests that photographs of psyohio bodies of ghosts could easily.be "faked" by means of the new process described in the Duly Telegraph, and commonly 'callod "opaque photograph." It would appear, however, that the use of the apparatus neoessary to the production of a " faked" spirit photograph would be en tirely different from that reqired to produce an ordinary photo. Its use would at once destroy any illusion.
