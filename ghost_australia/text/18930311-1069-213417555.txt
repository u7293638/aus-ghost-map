THE COMING OF THE YELLOW FEVER. T. Piieston Batteusuy, U.A., F.R.A.S (BAUUAD03.) Out of tho south, The furnaoc mouth, Whence the hot winds blow, with fiery breath, An nDgol came, With sword of fliuie, A mighty nngol whom mo.i call Death. Beyond tho hay A light, cloud lay, And veiled the Cross from the gazer's % cyos ; ' Ruddy as blood AutarOB stood, A baleful gleam in the southern skies. Heavy nnd still, \ Below tho hill, too slimy swamps where mangroves \- JVgrow, A rntik mist slept Where land crabs crept Like ghosts in the moonlight to and fro. With clink and clank From wall and bnnk Tho frogs croaked over their call for rnin ; Aud shrill aud clear, A pain to hear, Cicadas quavered their pictcing strain. Strange, shadowy things, On noiseless wings, Moved in and out of the sombre trees Like black nlamos spread ' O'er coffined dead, And stirred at nigl.t by a passing breeze. On vapors damp 1'be lighthouse lamp Flared red uud green with a lurid glare; None could deftue Tho limit lino Of oily sea and of stagnant air. But far away. Beyond the bay, The thunder roared with a mulllod roll ; Men woke and knew Their dreams wore truo, And Death in the darkness claimed a soul. With eyes astare And ta'bgled hair A corpse lay dark on the whito sea sand ; . And pnssing thence The pestilonco Went forth, with the angel', hand in hand.
