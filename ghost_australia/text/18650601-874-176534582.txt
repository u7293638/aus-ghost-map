AUSTRALIAN MELODIES. THE TOWN OF ECHUCA. A LITTLE AFTER MOORE. THERE'S not in Victoria a township so drear, As that where Campaspe and Murray draws near; My brushes' last bristles will come from their roots, Ere the mud of that township I clear from my boots. It was not that the Council had spread o'er the place Of gravel or sand not the ghost of a trace; 'Twas not in the streets the foul streamlet and rillâ€” Oh no! it was something more horrible still. 'Twas that fleas, which tormented my bosom, were there, Which bit me the harder, the harder I'd tear; And which showed that the juiciest morsel improved, By nibbling oft at the parts that they loved. Vile town of Echuca! How calm could I rest, Were those nimble fleas absent! I'd chance all the rest; Were the creatures that in thy warm blankets increase All drowned in the Murray, I might have some peace.
