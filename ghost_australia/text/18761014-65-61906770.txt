SPUING SADNESS. Oil, Spring, mu√≠ nrt thou hero ngnin ns ono Who bearing erat tho tiding of high tilings, And echoes of that song that no man sings, Coin'st now witli all thy promises forcdouo ? Thy clear fresh wind, thy clouds surprised by sun, Swallows that wheel and dart in ninzy rings, Thy chnritahlo wallllower scent that clings, And noise of streamlets enrolling ns thoy run, Aro those not sweet ns in thu fur-oil' dnys, When tho heart answered soniu mysterious cull, And eyes discerned tho sweet iudollmto fnco Of futura things to ho memorial? Ay, sweet, mid yet, nins ! for ono who snys "Ghosts of thu perished SpringH, und is this all?" 1*. 1J. MAIIHTON.
