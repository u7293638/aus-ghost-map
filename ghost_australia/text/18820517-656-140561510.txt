MONKEYS AND LIGHT. It is a strange fact that in night-time ail unknown sound will scare monkeys almost out of tlieir wits. Tho creaking of. a wheel barrow, a whisper, tho rustling of a window curtain, is enough to throw tliem into a fit of horrified screams and contortions ; capuchin inuuiteys lUHii wiiuiy Liuuugu men cage, nine nques try to force their prison- doors, tho little marmosets huddle together like the; princes in the Tower, all about a matter they i would disdain to notice in daytime. Tho old males of tho anthropoid apes aro about as hard to scaro as any living creature, but after dark tlie veriest trifle will inspire them with an almost supernatural fear ; and it may be a mere fancy, but I cannot get rid of the notion that this niglit-horror of our hirsute relatives must be tlio origin of the spectre dread of savage nations, and indirectly, per haps, of mediioval demonism and modern spiritualism, — :'ghost-mongery,' ns the sceptical Germans call it. Monkeys nre not very sharp-scented, and have to rely on their eyes, and in night-time, therefore, are almost at tho mercy of their enemies, jaguars, pan thers, and leopards, whoso owl-eyes enable them to hunt by moonlight, and iu tlio virgin woods of tho troi-ics tho constant dread of mistaking the approach of a murderer for the rustling of tho fitful niglit-wind would bo enough to make a Berserker nervous. ' It is not books or pictures,' says Charles Lamb, ' nor the Btories of foolish servants, which create those terrors in children., They can at most give them a direction. Tho stories of the Cliima-ras and Gorgons moy reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition, but they were there before. Thoy aro transcripts, types ; the arclio- types arc in us, and eternal. May it not bo that thoso archetypes aro the prowling ferae of the tropical forests ? — Ex- chahge.
