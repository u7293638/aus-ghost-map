It will be remembered that Mr A. Campbell generously made a present to the old lady of her new house —a weatherboard one containing four rooms— and the Mayor, Town Clerk, and other gentlemen also interceded on her behalf, and succeeded in raising a sum of money for liquidating the expense incurred in its erection. Several ladies connected with the Wesleyan Church also assisted in the movement, which, through the praiseworthy efforts of all taking part in it, was attended throughout with gratifying success. The house was also furnished with the surplus of the funds collected, and yesterday afternoon Mesdames Yandell, Cornish, Crow, Elliott and MacLean proceeded to the cottage, and arranged the furniture, &c.;, for Mrs Hunter, who, on jentering the building later on, was the recipient of a "welcome home" from the ladies named. They had brought a good supply of edibles with them, and the welcome took the form of a tea. Thej poor old lady's heart was full of joy at seeing such a comfortable home provided for her, and she frequently expressed her warmest thanks to all who had pecuniarily or otherwise assisted to "put another roof over her head." The Mayor paid a visit to the cottage whilst the tea was being partaken of, and stated that the house would be painted and a fence erectedf in, front of it, and then probably the Committee would be able to present Mrs Hunter with L5, as balance of the amount publicly raised. \- Sir Thos.
