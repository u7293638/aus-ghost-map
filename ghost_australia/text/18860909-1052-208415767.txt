Mrs. Brougham, Mrs. Robert Heir, Miss Louise Pomeroy (Theatre Royal, August 19,. 1882), Miss Cleveland (now Mrs. ArthurNelson), have also donned the sables for the presentation of the «' Prince of Denmark," but the per-, ' formance of Miss Rose Evans at the Theatre Royal, November 22, 1872, was one that having been seen could never be forgotten. The young, lady, was very petite in size, and dressed as Hamlet she was a perfect pocket edition of the character. She gave a charming but certainly novel repre- . sentation. She was supported by Mr. George Coppin as Polonius, Mr. Geo; W. Collier as the King Claudius, Mr. Claremont as the Ghost, Mr. James. Munro as Laer/Miss Docy Stewart '- as Ophelia; and Miss" Lizzie Biische ' (Mrs., G. W.
