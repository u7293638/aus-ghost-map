Whilehe was W^mMWMmm) . at Madrid he saw S?g5immmi2mimm and fell in love Y WMIMImlMmd nun- He withdrew VtfP&Km; her S, *Sa ^, T-romised her that she should. go with. him to Scotland as. has (wife, and that* he would never forsake- her. She used to dress magnifi cently, and from wearing a quantity of the old lace called 'pearling' he called her hie 'Pearlin Jean.' After a time he began to think he should have an awkward story to tell if he . took her home, and he made up his mind to get rid of her by leaving Madrid suddenly, without her know ledge. They did not inhabit the same house. His carriage and horses stood ready at his door' by daydawn, and he was just getting in, when 'Pear- lin Jean,' who had for some reason susipected hoe treachery, rushed' to him and entreated him to take her with him. He pushed 'her away ^without speak ing and got into the carriage. In her frantic despair she threw, herself on her knees in front of the horses to stop them. Sir James called out to 'drive on.' They did so. The horses trampled her under their feet, but he, without even looking back upon her, proceeded on his journey. It was one dark winter night that he drove up the avenue of AUanba&k.; His return had been sudden, and, as he knew, quite unexpected by hie servants. Therefore his surprise was great when, looking towards the house, he saw that every window was illuminated. As hie carriage stopped the great doois were thrown open, and in a blaze of light 'Pearlin Jean' stood at the top of the steps to receive him. From that time she haunted him. As scon as he lay down in bed she appeared, and opening the curtains at the- foot of the bed, stood 'gazing at him. His life became a bur den to him. He neither ate nor slept, and he fell away day by day. In vain his friends tried to -persuade him that hie terrors were imaginary. He always replied, 'She ie there!' He had a picture taken of her in Madrid. Some of his friends thought they would try and cure him of his delusions by placing this picture on the wail opposite his bed, and opening the curtain secretly as soon ae he had lain down, hoping that if he declared again he had seen the ghost they might then show him the picture and laugh him out of his fears. Two of them«hid themselves in his room, and the moment his head was on the pillow they drew back the curtains at the foot ofi^the bed. Sir Jamee started up with, 'My Gcd! There are two of them!' and instantly fell back in a fit. After this no attempt wae made to explain away her presence, and 'Pearlin Jean' continued to haunt j the house of Allan-bank as long as it stood. It was bought and pulled down by Lady Houston (Miss Boswell of Blackadder), but whether 'Pear- lin Jean' still wanders about the site of the old -hcuse I don't know. — 'Edinburgh Scotsman.' At this juncture it may De well to recall the fact that, with the exception of England, Japan is building more and better ships than any other power. Included in the list of ships building for Japan, we 'find that three vessels of 14,800 tons, two of which are nearly finished, are being built in British' yards; one battleship of 10,000 tons is being built by Armstrong; four first-class armored cruisers of 9600 tons, with a speed of 20 knots, are assigned, two to Armstrong, one to the 'Vulcan Company, near Stettin, and one to France; two cruisers of -6000 tons, with 23 knots, are ordered in the Unitecl Sta tes; one cruiser of 4300 tons, with 23 knots, and eigbt torpedo-boat destroyers, with 30 knots, in England; eight torpedo boats at Elbing; four. in France; and three cruisers of 3000 tons, with 20 knots, three torpedo boats, and a signal ship, are being built in the Imperial yard at Jokosk, in Japan, where an ironclad cruiser of 9600 tons, with 20 knots, will soon be begun.— 'Shipping World.'
