THE TALE OF THE WITCH OF ENDOR. Of all Bible stories cone is more popular with children than the tale of tho Witch of Endor. On wet Sunday afternoons the most admired plate in the folio Bible is that which shows Saul falling forward on the earth, aud the witch woman shrinking back in. astonish ment and awe, and the white bearded, shadowy figure of the Prophet rising op from the silence ot Sheol. The woman of Endor is beloved by controversial infancy, jost launched, unconsciously, on the stream of Biblical criticism and pleading against the verdict of parent or ntuse for the existence of ghosts and witches. The early syllogism runs thus : The Bible is trae. The Bible says there wero a witch and a ghost. Therefore, there are ghosts and witches. We often meet with worse arguments in later life, as when Science avers : 4 I don't take any interest in the question, with the suppressed inference, therefore there is nothing in it but nonsense.' Our instructors in our infancy, however, met our logic with pleas more subile, though not wholly satisfying. Thus, 'There were witches, or at least there was a witch, but that was before the coming of the Gospel. So now run aWay and see if you can find a ripe strawbery.'. Thus was the daring metaphysical specula - tion of infancy diverted into practical re searches. Or again, the answer would be, ' ' Saul was a bad man, and therefore the devil ; was allowed to deceive him in the shape, of Samuel.' 4 But it does not say anything about the devil, and the ghost's propbeoy came true.' 4 Oh, no doubt that was per mitted for wise reasons. So now ran awav.' at supra. â€” Andrew Lang, in the Contempor ary Review.
