Q.in, wh~ stood at the head of his profes sio?n ntil the appearance of Garrick, was a nati?6r of 'Ireland. Quin understood the art of good living. His constant allusions to the pleasures of the table, to the merits of well- hung venison, and the delicious dour of John Dories, were merely pleasaut, intentional, and ostentatious .naffectations, just as was his remark when he first saw \Vestminster Bridge : "Oh, that my mouth were that centre arch, and that the ,river ran claret I'" When Thompson, the author of "The Sea sons," was confined in a sponging-house for a debt of Â£70, Quin went to see him. "I havd come to sup i'with yo,"u said Quin "and, as I suppose it would bhe inconvenient to hlve a supper dressed here, I took the liberty of ordering one at the tavern hard by, and I have brought a half-dozen of claret by way of prelude." Supper over, the actor said: " It is now time that we should balance ac counts. The pleasure I have hadin perusing your works I cannot estimate at less than one hundred pounds, and I now insist on acquit ting the debt." Saying which he placed a note on the table and disappeared. Travelling with his friend Ryan, in Wilt shire, Quin alighted at an inn, and was told by the landlord that, hris house bein full, he could offer them no bedrcom save one which was haunted. "The very thing," cried Quin. "Let us have supper in the haunted room, and bring us a bottle of your best." i The meal despatched, Quin drew his pistols, charged them, and called for more wine. "Now," said he, "we are prepared ; lot the 'ghost come when he list." SMidnight sonnded, but no ghost appeared; but, shortly after, a rumbling noise was heard in the chimney, and a tall figure, attired in customary white and flowing garments, de scended, made two or three gestures, but of ered, no spiritual violence. Quin took up a pistol and cried " Angels and ministers of grace, look here. Mr. Ghost, I am speaking toyou ; and, if you do not this instant acknowledge yourself to be one of the human species, I'll make a ghost of you in earnest I" The apparition fell upon its knees, and x plained that it was the master of the adjoin ing house, and had contrived an opening in the chimney in order to terrify the landlord, and prevail upon him to quit the house, that he, the ghost, might see his own name swing upon the sign-post. The spectre was imme diately compelled to drink a bumper, the host was summoned, and the unfortunate ap parition was compelled to leave the ncighbor hood.
