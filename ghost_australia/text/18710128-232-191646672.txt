MINING. The gold returns for this month, as reported by toe several companies mentioned below, are greater than those of lastmonth, though twelve more companies reported last month than this month. We have a total of 24,602 oz now from 57 companies, bb against 21.469 oz from 69 comnanies last month. Bnt this difference must be in the main attributed to the feet that the St George and Band' of Hope United reports this month its accumulated arrears from October last, which had, as we intimated in our last summary, been withheld from publicity pending legal proceedings between that company and the Band andAlbionCocsolk The Ballarat Bank gold purchases for November and December are before us, showing nearly 1000 ounces more for December than for November. In Novem ber toe purchases were 28,006 oz 2 dwt, and in De cember 28,964 oz 2 dwt 6 gr. Excepting toe special case of toe St George, there are only five companies whose yield this month readies to four figures, and the Consols again heads the list, the sequence being, Consols, 2339; Park, 2049; New North Clunes, 1728; Hand and Band, 1678; Port Phillip, 1503. To this list must be added toe St George, which, apart from the aggre gate of arrears already referred to, obtained 1040 oz. for toe month. The good fortune of toe company of late is thus stated by the manager: — 11 Since the re turn of 217 oz 5 dwt appearing in the Star of the 17th October last the total amount of gold obtained by toe company np to and inclusive of ton 30th December, was 5399 oz 19 dwt; which has been sold to the Lon don Chartered Bank, and toe amount of £21,765 3s 6d realised, baa been placed to the company's credit. A sum of £4000 received from calls, and a further sum of £4000 arising from the disposal of gold, has been placed to the credit of mortgage account. Up to the 3rd of January a sum of £13,200 will have been paid in dividends." The market has been dull during the month, and business at the Comer has become the mere ghost of what was seen there in the high days of prospectusing. But if things on 'Change are tons duller toon they used to be mining is now in a more healthy state than before. Our yields keep well up, and there is more disposition to steady work. The Parliament having been dissolved, and payment of members bring law, there is a perfect cloud of candidates now forilie £300 a year which a seat in Parliament carries, and a re-' "rival of mining reform has arisen All toe candidates have theories new or old, bad, good, or indifferent, and even the slow-moving Mining Department haa been delivered of a little contribution in the shape of new leasing regulations. There is Borne ground for hoping that the new Parliament will really try and give us toe mining legislation which has been asked for any time during toe last fifteen years, but we should be sorry to be sanguine in our nope. There are signs of war in our little political teapot even already, and the gathering of toe hosts in toe new Parliament will very likely be followed by toe old abuses of time and opportunity by which toe public interests have been sacrificed to the contemptible squabbling of ignorant or vain or unscrupulous men. Since the date of our last summary the Ballarat School of Mines has opened for the actual work of teaching, Mr John Phillips, C.E., bong the master. The school is but an infant yet, and whether it will ever attain to strength and maturity is of course now a problem solvable only in the future. To European readers we need say nothing as to the value of such schools, for in Europe they have attained historical eminence. Here, in the midst of the golden metro polis of Australia, we see the curious phenomenon of large and wealthy dividend-paying companies refusing to support the school, as in the case of the Hand and Band Company, or else voting only meagre sums in aid, as in the case of the Band and Albion Consols, which voted £5. Other and less wealthy companies have been more liberal, but this only the phe- nomenon the more notable. Strangers may be1 sup posed to ask how a School of Mines can live if mining companies decline to recognise it; and we on the spot may be excused if we have our fears as to the per manence of an institution under such conditions. "Werejit not that working-men of energy and with a thirst for knowledge may show a regard for higher aims than has been exhibited by rich mining 'corpora tions, our fears would be greater than our hopes. To such men, to sterling teaching, and to the self- denying public spirit of the management,we look for success to the infant academy.
