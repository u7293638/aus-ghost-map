Police-office Impromptu. "Sic parvis componere magna solebam." VIRG. In my young days, and that is long ago, I oftentimes was dazzled quite by show; And prone too muoh (a fault perhaps of all), To measure great things by things very small; For instance--when a Scrutton towered on high I used to say, "a Norrie's all my eye;"-- When Cheek delivered out his cobbler's law, I thought of Sampson--no--the ass's jaw; And sometimes muttered, like fair Guerin's song-- "Along go fat boy--fat boy go along;"-- I e'en compared a puisne judge's sham With honours gained upon the banks of Cam, A wrangler's merits and his blazing noon Of fame, with feathers plucked and wooden spoon-- The Aldermanic toga, and the brass Of office with the lion-skin of Ass; And the loud braying of the York-street crew With the proud deeds that Ass aspired to do; A Thurlow's policy and wily skill With the all-open manliness of Hill; A Raymond's snug and sinecural Post, With Cocker's 'rithmetic, or Cobbett's ghost; (How they would smoke, these Raymonds--oh! my stars! On Billy Cobbett's gridiron-ic bars; Each parvenu who has a slave, of course, To sort our letters--to rub down his horse, And take his Cupidons to Sal or Cis-- But this is only a parenthesis.) The railway cutting in the Cleveland fields, The boy-capacity of Civil Shields; The very wheel-barrow that bore the sod-- Wheeled by a Cowper, and a brother clod-- With the gigantic promptitude of mind And deed which in a Stephenson we find, When o'er the Straits he waved his magic wand And linked in friendly fetters strand to strand, A Wentworth's steady patriotic flame, With Lang's deceitful ignis fatuus aim:-- \--But wiser grown, I've not the least pre- tence To measure Martin's gab by Johnson's sense. NOT-I-INDEED.
