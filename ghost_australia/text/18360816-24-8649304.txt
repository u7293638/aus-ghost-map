To the Editor of the Colonial Times. I Mr. Editor,-r-The considerate attention I paid me by the Editor of the True quere False i " Colonist," obliges me to inform the Public, 1 through your Journal, that the evidence given by him in my case is as true ' as were all his accusations affecting His Excellency and the l Colonial Secretary. His opinion that the town and country Ma I gistrate acted wisely in dismissing my up : plication, no doubt arises from the knowledge of the cabalistic meaning of the words Richard son's Ghost. -I am, Sir, &c.; James Hackett. P. S.-The evidence of Messrs. Bilton, Morris, and Caldwell, each contradictory of the other can be rebutted by that of Messrs. Wise, Cox, Burn, and others.
