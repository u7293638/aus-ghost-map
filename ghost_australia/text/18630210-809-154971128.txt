MR. GLASS ON THE LODDOX. TO THE EDITOR OF THE AGE. Sin, — I am afraid the people of Victoria have but a 'very meagre idea of the progress they ara making towards civilisation, liberty, and, indeed, privileges of every kind. As a proof of this pro gress, permit me to narrate the following. A short time ago, having occasion with a companion to make a trip down the Loddon, we, not unnatu rally, carried our fowling-pieces with us. As we passed along it was Baid to us, 'You need not take your guns ; you will not be allowed to use them.' But the 'absurdity of the idea only pro voiteu u srnue. io our astonisnment, wnenwe reached the agricultural area of Pasley, a man accosted us, and having asked some rather imper tinent questions, plainly informed us that the entire district through which we were passing was private property, and that the proprietor, Mr Hugh Glass, had authorised him strictly to pro hibit fowling. Now, to have Btumbled on the ruins of an old castle would have been a stranga thing enough, perhaps the sudden appearance of a banshee would have been stranger still, but to meet with the ghost of the game laws of Old Englsnd, truly that was the strangest thing of all. You may rest assured that if the man had ordered me to fling my gun into the nearest waterhole I would right gladly have complied, so intense was my admiration for the honorable and patriotic gentleman who, either directly or indi rectly, was thus early seeking to introduce into a nearly untrodden region one of the most aristo cratic institutions of his fatherland. — I remain, yours obediently, SPORTSMAN;
