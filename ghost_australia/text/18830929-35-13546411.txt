A BALLOON VOYAGE ACROSS THE ArCHIE SEA. Mr Simmons, the aeronaut, has given the following interesting narrative of his recent balloon voyage across the North, Sea from Maldon, in Kent, in company with Sir" C1 aide de Crespigny - ' Before you undo a sturt several pilot balloons were launched in order to ascertain which direction we were likely for sales the prices under at d son and currants at low alti- tud , but as at the moment of starting the wind gave me a good deal of trouble, I found it necessary to leave the ground with great ascending power, us every attempt I read. t > utilises t currents would hav a been at the expense of gas and ballast. Vie had a desire to cross the German Ocean; therefore even chance of ballast and every foot of gas had to be cautious and We had not much time to enjoy the glorious panorama ere we found it necessary promptly to discuss the propriety of attempting to reach He Hind or Belgium Fortunately the. iititio-mhe'O over England was clear The start was made at 11 o'clock a in , and we soon crossed the Thames, near the Nore _ King our bearings we were going sharp for Rot terrain The bottom of the sea was clearly seen in every direction. we see the man-of-war at Harwich very dis- tinct!), felix stenuerH beneath us appear to be almost in oblivion We are at an altitude of 9000 feet height ship east of the Blackwater is about the use of a flea, hut is very distinct Although the bell is constantly ringing, we can now and again hear shouts from decks We throw out sheets of paper and had them being left a little to our north. 1 his satisfies us there are making still a trifle south of east and, and our safety and the attain ment of our object depend upon being able to continue it 2 o'clock I have not yet spent an ounce of ballast or touched any valve. Altitude at this moment 10 000 feet Our feet are cold. YA o appear to be overhauling a mist to the south east 2 30 p m.- We are enshrouded in it, and can see nought but ourselves and our balloon A few minutes literate here a mag indecent picture of the balloon on the clouds YVo em to our assisting doing everything ex i us) as we do, even to the fingers distinctly handling the ropes Our ghosts are dummies We make them speak by shouting ourselves, and even in this the) exactly imitate us. the grappling cable which I have let out is distinctly re- produced in reflection or shadow running to the phantom car I call Sir Claude de Crespigny attention to this apparent negative He cannot see it where he is sitting, but ltnntediiitelj on coming to my side he sees the rope as distinctly as I do My blue serge suit looks now quite green, and continued so for many minutes the atmosphere is of a very deep blue above us The gas up through the centre of the belle m is perfectly clear, and the great dome with its stores and diamonds haBa very solid and assuring appearance. Every thing is in perfect tranquillity We can hear the beating of our hearts very dist actly Our ears are occasionally blocked, but we remedy this little evil by widely opening our mouths At 4 30 we both think there is a slight sound as of surf We are very slowly descending and at 4.10 emerge on the under side of the clouds and can see something looking like a coast line to the south-east We are still on the same course we started with At 4 oO we have approached near enough to find that our imagines) coast line is a long sweep of shoal, but it encourages us to think that we have passed mid ocean Another long line of shoal now appears behind to the eastward As if by magic, we are in full view of six steamers, as we suppose Those are all coming from the east On nearer approach we see they are sailing vessels They appear to expect we shall require their services, for they are tacking and dodging a 5.10 Two steamers are distinctly visible, both going westward. 0 J - Sir C1 tude cries, 'Look there is that another also di" YVo discuss this matter with much interest. Sir Claude cannot believe it is any thing but mainland I soon begin to think the a mile, but it continues for a long time very indistinct, and as I look very fixedly on it for some n mutes it appears to alter its shape, and I conclude it can be nothing but a streaky cloud instead of in evening in distinctness, the Irish sweep now grows more dim, and at the same time we have other indications which make us think we have changed our course, and that there is a point of nails in it Now sir borne iiiaueuuvriog to try and find out whether a sudden increase of altitude has changed our course. Sir Claude says two or three times that he does not despair of the she is turning, out to be land. His distant voice was more distinct than usual '' At 10 minutes east G Mr Simmons was perfectly satisfied that he was within a short distance of the coast " chosen had been for some minutes deeply shrouded, but he peeped between the clouds, and under the influence of his rays the balloon instantly shot upwards, with tearful rapidity Sir Claude said Do you not me 11 k is c souping i but I did not, and had it not been in this Penfound of his, the consequences might have been sent has In a few seconds we were over a vast area of what I looked like mount one or snow soft enough to win k on The grandeur of this stone it would he utter folly for me to attempt to describe. lYot the slightest movement could be detect d in any part of the by ist cloudland , tin mountain peak seemed to stand there fixed for over the attempt iron was too proud to go down and have this gi include a all! the (re her temptation, the positive son of of the S of America lately benefitting I now opened the valve, and we rushed driving irds with great rapidity A row are india were sufficient, to bring us down from our highest position (17,000 lie is low enough to spread by tore our dear hted vision the beach or Walcheren Is) land, on the north side of the Scheldt River and the in Holland of Holland, shutting us in on the south.
