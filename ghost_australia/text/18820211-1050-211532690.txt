Now, hear the testimony of this very learned Roman Catholic, who had searched so deeply and laboriously into every source from which information on this subject could' be derived: — Concerning the solemn benediction of salt a,nd: water to be made on every Lord's day, I do, not remember that I have read : anything before the ninth centurt, in which Pope Leo IY. has these few words in bis bomily of the pastoral care. : " : p In Goar's " Rituale Graecorum," a col lection of the oldest Greek' liturgies, made by a missionary of the Pope/there is';a service for consecrating holy water.'- Mar- tene rightly judged this to be later than the ninth ' century. W e allude to it' here only for the sake of the note which. Goar gives on it. Speaking of the institution of holy water, he says— " It ackriowledges as its author Pope Alexander, whop re sided over the Church in- the. time, of Trajan, writing in the epistle: ascribed to him, ch. 5. . ." Arid then follow the words,- which we have- given above; from the forgedtopistle. This is the testimony of one employed by the Pope on an im portant mission. .Haying; thus. ;found( the origin ofdli'oly water in the forged decretals, we have to (show bow it was; established iri the ninth century :i - ',i 'P r 7 .. After those forged decretals ware pub lished, Pope Leo IY. ; : published liis " Homily of Pastoral Care,'/ ; which/is, in fact, the Pope's order to the whole clergy how to perform their, functions. And in it we find — " On every Lord's day, bless the rwatertoefore mass, with which 'let tlie people beispririkled- and for this havei'-a proper vessel." This is the, first, genuine .authority in the1 Church 'of Rome ' liat' Mjirtene could find, for .blessing holy water . for general use ; and it1 aplpearedyris a/tor the forged decretals had been published.

Let. us. follow,! as one instance, the up and'dow.ns of poor, KingiCarolus. i 1 He has , given some offence ; and' the - Pope " writes specially1 chiding and; admonishing, and', at the same time, order-' ing him.'" This, seems, to have a . good effect/for in the next letter to.Carolus himself the Pope . praises his . humility, highly. , Times were changed ; for, before forged decretals, came out, ' it ' was ; the ' kings --of France-5 that praised the humility Aof? Pope's -Thus, about /the - year 785, just before' thefdi'gedlepisties'came out,Char-.' lemagne/' the' 'Emperor, f';writes to Pope Leo. III.—" The letters of.yopr excellency!

A Christian bishopmiglit say to such a king, "I want your soul for .God, and I want- neither your kingdom.: nor your property." But/Pope Nicolas Had not so learned the /forged "decretals ; and 'so he answers/ " Anew /we discover evidently the marks : ofthe faith with "which you burn' , (not to . Christ but) towards - the H oly Roman Church ; reading -the letters of your excellency, which distil honey instead, of words !V Aye-; is . that the Pope's honey! But King Carolus loved honey top / and: when King Lotharius was 1 dead, ' Carolus claimed that kingdom also, which- the Pope wished to'- give to another: Then . followed the threats of hell-fire and thej devil, of which we have spoken already. . Carolus is in more trouble : his son Caroloman has rebelled against him, and Caroliis has banished him. Caroloman flies to Rome/and ' will be ever obedient to the Pope ; so we have a, letter from Pope Hadrian II. , to Carolus, pronounc ing/him worse than a wild beast,", and ordering him to restore his son to all his honours, and to his paternal affection, until the Pope shall send legates to en quire into the merits of the quarrel ! So the king must not even be angry, till the. Pope knows why. King Carolus is on his bended, knees again, but in a very grumbling humour. So the, Pope .writes to , him, after a little flattery about the " praise-worthy love and modest wisdom " ' of King Carolus — " You have sent to us a tumultuous, clamour, nor Ao wo find that you have heard with patience; the , admonitions and corrections of our pontificateship ; truly it appears that -you are as yet somewhat wanting ,m perfect, love." The Pope, of course, wishes to have him perfect, and: thus states the treatment be intends to adopt— " Therefore, since we desire to have you a perfect man, and pleasing to God in all things, like a wige father, who does not cease to, whip. with , a severe scourge his most dear son, even. when not offending , lest when feeling secure he might boldly mix himself up with unlaw ful crimes." ' : " Who would not be the son of so loving; a father? But unreasonable Carolus murmurs still, and writes' a murmuring letter to the Pope ; .-to which the Pope replies , again—" no murmurer (against the Pope), receives the kingdom of God." Of course not, if the 'Pope: have the key,. But the Pope is very civil now, for he has heard this good report of' King" Carolus, " that' you fervently wish and desire, to exalt; this, first see of Peter the '.'prinice of apostles ; to honour and to enrich with many gifts his vicar, and the clergy en trusted to him." And the Pope adds, iu all, sincerity, "I so love such virtues in you, as I do my own soul !" : !
