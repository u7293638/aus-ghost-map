Lately ftcr aGerman professor visited the "adepts," as the'e queer Htiudus are called, for the purpose 3 to of finlinng oun the secret of their remarkable col- performances. They treated hin rather scur vily, but interested him all the same. One day lily the professor wanted to examinlle some ancient hb- $anskrit manuscripts. An adept' went with and him to a cave wherein the the books were kept. Thie pIlace was dark an the bottom of a well. aid "I cant see to read, here," said the visitor. :ur- "Then Ae will have some lighlt," was the re ply, and immediately (the professer says) a soft Pearly light briglltened the cave. He could not toll whence it canme, but lie noticed that it had one strange quality-itf cast not the slightest Sshadow. This is a story hard to believe, Vet its truth is 'r aaffirmed by a man of vast learning and high character, aund you who now read it have no reason for doubt except tha:t all the light you have seen have cast shadows. Belief or on belief commonly runs parrallel with one's own experience. Dr. Johnson aniffed at the ac ed count of the Lisbon earthquake, yet credited the tale of the Cock Lane ghost.; , "In the spring of 1d88 ". wiltes our correa,, rn pondent, " I fell into a low,. weak, and languid state.

There is a deal of .diffcebhce betweetn br. Griffith's candid letter and the st6ry about the. light that cast no bhadow.

And that is why people believe all that ta told of Its sncoess by eager witnesses.
