POETRY. ' THE ISOLATION OP ENGLAND.' Tho wind iB hushed t the darkn^Fs growB t The fainting moon iB loBt in flight. Dentil lifts ft sombre haod and throws His clouds across the faue of night. With parted lips and haggard stare, That strives and strains to pierce the gloom, Each nation crouches in its lair, _ And, breathless1, waits the coining doom. Dim shapeless shadows pass like ghosts j Along tho trembling earth they f*iel The distant tramp of marching hosts, And hear the smothered clash of steel [ Till, reaching out for friendly hands To guide them through tho gloom, they presB To where ono silent figure stands Serene in lofty loneliness. They hurl their taunts, thoir oaths, their prayers j Tho snarl of greed, the growl of hate j They, spit upon the cloak she weftrB, Or grasp its hem to supplicate. But, Btill, as though she liear them not, Her anxious eyt-B are fixed afar Among the clouds on one pale spot, Where faintly gleams a single star. By that same star she cIiobu hor path For every night in vanished years ; Though screened by mists of doubt and wrath, She sees it still au if through tears. Then glancing at the fretful horde Who call on her now to bend the knee, She lays her hand upon her sword, And turns her eyes toward tho sea. ? '
