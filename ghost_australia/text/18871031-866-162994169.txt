Pasteur and Vulpian conducted us to the cellars, There, in circular cases o f close lattice •k, w ere confined dogs o f vaiiouB races. One o f them had arrived at the last 6tage of hydrophobia. H e chuld no longer bark naturally. Harsh guttoral cries, somewhat resembling those o f a cock, were all he could utter. These characteristic cries znado the th e neighbouring cages tremble, and they would certainly have fled a t fpU speed had their prisons . been opened. On kick­ ing the cage toe dog i-ushed and gnashed furiously at the bars. W hen the end of a heavy iron rod was pushed in he seized it in his jaws and b it it bo fiercely that it was difficult to make him loose bis bold. I t was the same when the end o f tbe bar had been previously headed. T h e animal refused the food which was offered Iilm , but throw himself eagerly upon the hay which sorved him for litter, and swallowed, without chewiDg, large quantities o f it. T he sequol is always the same. Instead of inoculating rabies by bites, some drops of the cerebral matter o f a mad dog are introduced into the brain o f one in sound health. For this pmposo the operation o f trephining, which is s6arcely e ve r fatal, is performed. W hen inoculated b y this method the period o f incubation is almost m7. The various stages o f the malady rapidly follow , so that in a few days the final phase o f the disease is developed. In the chickeu coops are some fow ls, on which avo carried ont tbo experiments. F arth er od, are rabbits destined t o furnish rabid virus for tbe preventive inoculation^. W e find/ too, some monkeys, still gambolling in perfect freedom, who greet u s with agrim acedf welcome.'

But a t piesent the ^orra theory is ju s t a v ery respectable working hypothesis, which only the developments o f tim e w ill prove o r upset. Lectu rin g in Paris, on December 8 th o f. last year, before a crowded audiende o f medical men Prof. P e t r e , • M .D . {says tb< Jjancet), refei*red to PASTEUh aud the germ theory as follows :— “ A t the present time the whole o f pathology is dominated ny, aud th isby bacteriology. ’ Bacterialiere, bacteria there, bacteria everywhere. E very d ay we learn with amazement that ye t another disease is parasitical. There are bacteria to make us feverish in typhoid, oth ers to produce algidity in cholera; some b low hot, others cold. T h e microbic theories ■have led to attem pts o f medical antisepsis; but this, although w e ll meant, is chimerical. • T h e anti-rabic inoculations o f P a s te o r arenas w ell meant, but no less chim erical. Irrational in principle, th e y are inefficacious in practice/' Turning now, with such crippled space as is le ft us, from the vagaries o f onr N orthm an to the Commissioners' re p o rt which so excited his admiration, w e find that the document, exhaustive as it appears, and warm in support o f Pasteur, as it undoubtedly is, nevertheless leaves some im portant points unexplained. These pretermissions, however, have been la rgely supplied by the publications o f independent observers and w ork ers in the same domain, especially D r. Lutaup, editor o f ‘ the Journal dc Aft-dicme P a r i* ; D r. Dolan, o f Halifax, and Dr. C. B e l l T a ylo r, o f Nottingham. B y these writers, and others, rather suggestive facte have been brought in to the . ligh t of day. For instance, prior* to the Pasteurian furore th e average death-rate in France, fro m hydrophobia, was under 30 per an n u m ; yet the number of persons recen tly -cured by Pasteur's inoculation is represented as over 2500! W h a t can account for the traordinary increase in tbo number of persons bitton by rabid animals ? A re tbe statistics o f the Frenchman's alleged cores w orthy a moment's credence? Again , cauterisation has long been, in v ery many instances, an all-sufficient treatment o f bites from affected dogs. I t is known that numbers o f patients who were treated b y P a s te u r had already been cauterised. W h o then can say whether tb e ir recovery was due to the latter treatm ent o r to inoculation? Once more, some o f his patients were never b itten a t all. T be report admits this, and says that, <( in order to quiet fea rs," Pasteur occasionally “ inoculated persons who believed th a t they had been bitton b y rabid animals, could g iv e no satisfactory evidence of it.” W h o sbal! determine, then, how many o f th e patients reported as cared w ere persons whose sole malady was a m ere supposition that they had been bitten b y rabid dogs ; a superstition e asily accounted for ; yet, ii scores o f cases absolutely baseless. “ A fte r m ore than th irty years’ experience as a physician, dog-owuer, aud student « f comparative medicine,1 says Dr. S to ck w e ll, o f London, “ have y e t to m eet w ith an absolute o f rabies io the d og ; and o f some soores o f so-called hydrophobic animals presented for m y inspection, one and a ll w ere found to have suf. fcred from other and comparatively innocuous maladies.” The saddest part o f all this Pasteurian story is tbo savants admitted failures, as attested b y the deaths of his patiente. T he death'roll non reaches 96, th e latest and most emi nent case b ein g that o f Lord Done kaile, an Irish representative peer. This old nobleman was bitten last January b y a rabid H e proceeded at once to Professor Pasteur, - b y whom he was duly inoculated and treated for' hydrophobia. In August, seven months later, th e p oor earl was smStteh fwith the dreadful madness and died. As a London journal pertinently observes, “ Clearly M . Pasteur has not prevented th e disease. But a terrible question hais arisen in connection with it D id he cause it ? - W as it the virus o f the fox o r tbo virus planted b y the inocnlation which worked in Lord Doneraile's veins P W hich P N obody can tell— it may be either. T h e practice o f M. Pasteur' has not been long enough, and the cases have n ot been numerous enough to make an y conclusion ■certain.” In a form er article we showed from Pasteur's own words that his system and Junker's were not, as many snpposed, m u tually oorroborative. T o ­ day, w c th in k onough has been advanced to induce, if not positive opposition, a t least .an "attitude o f suspended‘ judgm en t in .regard to the Frenchman's anti-rabic practice, even though th a t practice come authenticated 'b y - a host’ o f . commissioned Philo-Pasteurisls, and obscqnioualy belauded b y ton thousand projudiobd provincial prints.
