J011N L. SULLIVAN. Still on Top of the Earth. Myroferonco to tbo resurrection of JohnL. Sullivan, whom tbe cable liond bad killed, and then relenting, brought to life again, was crowded out last wook, lfonce the absonco of any allusion to this modern miracle. I'm sure tho great pugilistic idol of America will derivo an inflnuto amount of pleasure through rend ing hia obituary notices when thoy roach him, OBpooially tboso from this sido of tho terrestrial spueru. Mine waa written trom a personal knowlodgo of the man during hia sojourn in Australia, and close observation of his doings in America. Exaggerated and luridly colored reports of the big fellow's ecceutricitios or ' jags,' aa thoy term thorn, written to ordor, or by scriboa who had au axo to grind, carriod no woight with yours truly. Again how did a couple of our dailies perform, and one particularly? No man over received such a 'send-off' to the land of the groat horoafterâ€” 'twas onougb to mako tho dead boxer's ghost pay a nocturnal visit hithorward, and when I didn't hoar that either of tbe editors of the aforomentiouod journals had boon spiritod nway during tllo night, there woro doubts aroused iu my mind as to whether tho great slugger had roally handed in his cheques or not. Hqwover, this is about the hundredth time Sullivan has ' died,' and ho still lives; but never was there such a genuine ring about tbe report as on this lust occasion, and that must be my exouse for having ' fallou in ' in com pany with pretty woll overy Australian news paper. But I lay tbo fluttering unction to my soul tbat John L. will cherish no bad feelings towards mo upon reading what tbo Referee had to say whon ho was supposod to havo shumed off, and thero is just a faint probability that it may bring him up with a round turn, and bo tbo moans of causing him to pull himself togotber a bit beforo the down hill paco becomes too fast to be chocked, He's not as bad as they paint him.
