Wben the paper first started I predicted its speedy coUapise, bnt it lingered longer than might have been expected ; lingered long enough to get if s editor into paoL and itself a notoriety for filth and obscenity.

Though the news is not startb'ng or sensational, it is very interesting, both at home and abroad. We are very much gratified with the true womanly spirit wiii which tbe Queen received the intelligence of her son's attempted assas sination — I mean in her sympathy for the feelings of the colonists.

A Lover's Adventcbb. -The old adage that 'the coarse of true lave never did ran smooth ' was never better illustrated than by the following incident, which occurred in the quiet town of Moonta last week. Some eight months ago a respectable tradesman sought to win tbe heart of a fair lady, and having suc ceeded appliei to the resjiectable papa for his consent to their union, bnt the damsel being under age he was sternly refused, all further in tercourse strictly forbi'lded, and due caution taken to prevent it Bat ' love laughs at lock smiths,' and a way was found to bold epis tolary commanication through the parlour win dow after the old folks had retired to bed ; the old dad, however, being a knowing card, was mistrustful of the gallant swain, from hearing him aing near the house a couple of lines of the old song — ' At the window Til meet thee, And bear ibee. love, away, avray.' And having slightly dusted the window-sill with flour, the next morning there were nnmis takeable marks on the esll and glass of hands and fingers. The following night the papa, in stead of retiring to bed, lay on the sofa in the parlour. In about twenty minutes after the light had been pot out a slight tapping was heard at the glass. Papa answered by drawing die blind slightly, and gently opening the win dow. He put oat bis band to receive the pro mised bitkl deux, his hand was instantly seized, kissed, pressed, fondled over and over at least ten times, when, a third party appearing in the street, the gallant moved off delighted ; but when he sees this in your paper, I have no doubt he will be disgusted and heartily ashamed of himself. His commanication will be returned on application to pa. — WaUano Time*. Tichborse. — Mr. P. M'Manns, batcher.
