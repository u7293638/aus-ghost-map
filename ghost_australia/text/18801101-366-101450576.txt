" l said, " mine; I bought it off a man who was selling it in the street;" I then charged him stealing it from Mr. L.

Louis Mandelshon deposed: Lindsay Osborne has been apprentice with me for six years; since I came back he has to make up two years; he has been in my employment since March last, when I returned; on Saturday morning last I missed seven yards of cloth from a case in which I generally shrink cloth; the cloth produced is the piece re ferred to; it is West of England tweed and cost me 5/6 n yard; my brother and the prisoner Lindsay worked on Friday night. up to one o'clock; I gave the prisoner no authority to take the cloth or to go Sydney.
