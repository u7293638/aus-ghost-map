7SPOBTIKG. THE y.R.G SPRING MEETING. FotothDay. fBv TelesraDh. I lifrom our own iteporcar.j Melbourne. -Wovember 7. The V.E.C. were favoured with beautiful weather again on Saturday, and the atten dance must have been quits equal to that on Derbv ~Dav. The Governors were asain prefiens. ine racing was nrai-ci&33, zae meeting of Trenton and Trident in the Canterbury Plate being quite the most in teresting feature of the four days. Game's defeat in the Steeplechase was a great disappointment, and altogether the favourites were unlucky, Britisher's defeat in. the V.H.C Handicap being brought about by the jockey of Brown-and Eoss hitting him over the head with a whip, while the crack Game fell in the Steeplechase when looking a certain winner. The opening event was a mere canter for Volcano, whom Hales could not hold back to hi3 opponents. The Flernington Stakes proved a good thiDg for Casuisti who got all the best of a straggling start, and led the whole way. Silver Mine and Ben Bolt were scratched for the V.R.C. Handicap on the coaree, and favouritism rested with Brown-and-Rose and Britisher. The Baliarat horse should have won, but as he 'was making hia running in the straight the rifler of Browh-and-Ecsa accidentally hit him over the head with hi3 whip, and Britisher throwing up hi3 head and stopping Bravo was able to get away and score a lucky win by a length. The owner of Britisher pro tested against Bravo for causing the inter ference, but as it was clear that the ridor of Brown- and-Rose was the sincer the objection -waa dismissed. The withdrawal 'Of Contingent made the Steeplechase look a real good thing for Game, and odds were laid on the top weight Lady Ashfcoa mads the running at a great pace from the fall of the flag, and falls began early. Lady Carring tpn coming to griei at the first fence. Mr. Pearson b mare held a long lead until near the turn^ for home when Game got on easy terms with her, but just as it looked as though he .would win easily the top weight struck the fence, and after stagger ing for a moment he rolled over. Native was nearly down at the Bame fence, and Curiositv fallinz at the last Larfv asnxon was able to scramble home from Native, but the mare was terribly distressed at the finish, and had Game stood up he would probably have won easily. The great match between Trenton and Tridentfollowed. Both sides were very confident, but Trenton was Blightly the better.favonrite of the two, despite the fact that owing to the hard state of the ground Mb trainer was forced to run aim in thin plates while Trident was barefooted. Trident looked all the better for his Cup gallop, and directly the flag fell it became evident that the race was to be a very severe one. Tama risk cut out the work at her top speed, and Hales kept Trident at the head of the others, while Trenton was last. In this order they ran for half the distance, when Cyclops took Becond place, but going round the back Trident went after the mare, and Trenton headed Cyclops. A mile from home Tama risk and Cyclops ceased to have any interest in the race, and Hales kept forcing Trident along, with Trenton in pursuit. Bounding the home turn Trenton was drawing up, and Lis friends thought he would win, as Hales was hard at work upon the colt, but when Bobertson challenged he found his lpise unequal to catching Trident, who kept bis advantage up the straight, and finally won rather easily in the fastest time on record in Australia. In the last few strides xtth horses were eased off; or the time would lave been even faster. There was some leavy betting on the last rase, Lord Wilton and Eitawa being the favou rites, whilst several others were heavily backed. Lord Wilton, who was kept in i very forward position considering his weight, had all the other favourites safe some liBtance from home, but at the distance Bales brought up Hogmanay on the inside, ind the favourite being pretty well spun out ie was beaten very easily by a length. Hogmanay was not backed much by the itable, and his victory wound up a very good day for the bookmakers. The following are the results :— THE MAKKS* PKODUCB STAKES, Of 100 8OV8., with a Bweepstakes of 10 bovb. each added. The second horse to receive 100 bovb. and the third 50 bovb. out of the stakes.

Casuist obtained a great advantage, and came over the tan pursued by Liedertafel, Yetman, and Oceana.

At the torn the positions were the same, bat at the bridge Impulse headed Yallow Hammer, with Brownaod-Rose, First Prince, and Ringmaster still at the heels of the leaders.

Betting— 5 to 4 on Game, 5 to 1 agst Native, 6 to 1 Lady Aahton, 8 to 1 Havelock, 10 to 1 Curiosity. Directly the word was given Lady Aahton went; to the fiont and led Curioaity and Game past; the Stand, and the mare drew away some distance at the first fence, over which Ehe was followed by Curiosity, Game, Wickliff, Havelock, Native, and Moonlight in the order named, Lady Carrington falling. Lady ABhton increased cer lead at the nest fence, Curiosity going oa second and Game third, the others all up with the exception of Moonlight, who was outpaced from the start. Passing the abattoirs Lady Ashton was followed by Curiosity at an interval of six lengths, the favourits being double this dis tance away, with Wickliff, Havelock, and Native running together. At the nest fence Moonlight fell, and coming; through the gap Lady Aahton had a long lead of Curiosity, with Game nest. The&e; positions were pretty well maintained over 'the fences in the Btraight, but jumping the logs Lady Ashton's lead had been somewhat reduced, and Cnrioaity, Game, Native, and Havelock ware well together^ but Wickliff was beaten off. At the river the order was much the same, but the next fence brought down Havelock, and Game took second place, while Lady Ashtpn reduced her lead at the back through striking hard, and Native here headed Curiosity, and went on just behind Game: Passing the abattoirs and sheds Game was gradually drawing up to Lady Ashton, but at the Becond fence from home he struck very hard, and after blundering along the ground rolled over, and got rid of Corrigan. Native also struck this fence, and Curiosity came down at the last The accidents leit Lady Ashton with good lead, and although she was terribly leg-weary in the straight, she managed to struggle home four lengths in front of the equally exhausted Native.

' Directly the fl&g; fell Tamarisk shot to the front and led Trident and Cyclops past the Stand, Trenton lying last The leader made tiie pace very fast rounding the turn and along the river she led Trident six length with Cyclops and Trenton following at intervals of two lengths. Tamarisk continued to force the pace from Trident, and there was no change in the positions until they entered the straight a second time, when Cyclops took second place, and was only two lengths behind Tamarisk at the Stand, with Trident and Trenton separated by the same distance. Tamarisk increased her lead again as they rounded the turn, and Trident joined Cyclops. The two favourites were now steadily making their way to the front, Trenton heading Cyclops at the bridge, and 7 furlong* from home Trident cut down Tamarisk, and almost simul taneously Trenton took second place. Tamarisk and Cyclops dropped further and further behind now, while the cracks were travelling at a tremendous pace. Hales kept driving Trident along at the abattoirs, and at the sheds he had an advantage of two lengths, but racing, along the bend Trenton appeared to be creeping up, Bounding the turn Hales was Btul forcing Trident along, and as Robertson appeared to be sitting Btill, Trenton was maintained the favourite when they entered the straight For a few strides kup the running Trenton looked like catching the leader at any time, but before they got to the distance Bobertson pulled out his whip, and it was soon Been that Trident was to be the hero of the occasion, as despite the game efforts of the big. horse he could never quite reach his younger rival, and Robertson easing off 100 yards from home Hales followed suit, and Trident cantered past the post a length in front Cyclops was ISO yards off third, and Tamarisk cantered in last Tune, 5 min. 25| sec _, s . ,.'
