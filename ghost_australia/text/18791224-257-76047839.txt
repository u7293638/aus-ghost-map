BUTOHER JACK'S STORY. (Bv Archibald Forbes.) It was in the autumn of 1854 that the Eng lish arrd French armies were lying lovingly enough together in front ct Sebastopol, that nut which it took them such a time to crack. Our cavalry had a camp /of their own upon the liity-sido ucar Ruiikoi, aud the old, ' Death's-head and Crosn-bones,' to which I belonged, vrere there among tbr rest, forming part of the Light Brigade. . We had a separate commissary of our own, feed bimdy men were told off from the various corps to act as but chers. Inejrpr was backward when there was any work to do;' and when some fellows were mopiug helplessly iu the tents, or going sick to hospital, every morning I was knock ing about as jolly as a sandboy, doing a Job here aud one there, and always contriving to get more or less tipsy boforenighttaU. If you ever drop across any of the old Crimean Ligst Pf-g*d*. just you ask tham if they retneinW fk Bntch'er 'Jack' of thb Lancers, and sec what the answer will be. I was as well knoivn in the Brigade as old Cardigan himself, and :a my rough-and-tumble way got to be quite a popular character. Indeed, had it not been for my inordinate fondness for the drink, I might have got promotion over aud over again. Bat I used to find my way shoulder-high into the guard-tent pretty regularly onoe a- week, aud more than once I only saved the skin of my back by being known as « willing, useful.fellow when sober. One ' BtiraRhtering-day' at the Commissary we had killed, Bayed, and cut up our number of beasts, ami there wwa lot of rum knock ing about, for the Commissary Guards knew bow to get at the ferog, aud were free enough nith it among the butchers, for the sake of a nice tender stake. Paddy Heffecnan, of the Koyals, aud I, managed to get as Jiauk as IoaU before we found time for a wash, ami one of the ( toininissary-officers came aci-o=s us »hlc in this state, ivud clapped us ; l the Kiprd-tent before you could sav ' knifa.'1 O.ie plico was as good as another ii us, bo we lay there contented enough nil nijht, taking an occasional tot out of a bottle which Paddy managed to smuggle into the teut where he waB confined. It wan goUinj on for morning before we dropped off ip':o a ndvy, dviinfctn n'eep, out of whiob the ( 'oinmandcr-iit-fbicf would have hurl a tough j.ii- to have roused us. We must have hada t long snooze, for it was l-road daylight 'before we were awakened l-y the loud Iliundering of a tremendous cannonade close by, making : the tew teafpoUw. quiver sgiia.' - ?', ; I still felt dc.icedly muzzy, for Commi«- ; : try rum, as you would know if you ever get i ti jht on it, is h.aiil etiiff to get sober of, yet I ? niinagod to pull myself together enough to i l-'iow where I was, and coulil giTc a shrewd I guess what all the row fas. :I eat up with ; tlie intention of hearing more ubout it from \ Buiiiu oi viic guiiiuB ; nut to my eurprise^nerc was not a soul i.i the tent but. Paddy and myself, aud there was not even a sentry upon the door. So we both cot up on end and had a stretch, and then walked coolly out of tho guard- tent, only to find the camp utterly de serted, not* raw heiiig apparently lefl«n it. Tarn''hgJlnto our Writ, we: sat flown, and over a refresher out of the ioexhaustable ruin bottie, we trM iua' boozy sort &f; ftftm, to argue -lut -the peeition.' Prom vrhet» the camp was we could not see what was going on down in the valley by reason of 41 low ridge wliicl; intercepted tb% Mew ; IM we could tell it must be prutty warm wofk.'froin tbe hot and coutiuuous firing whigh was be ingkeptop. Atla&tsaj;»rtoP»d|iy, 'Why the devil should we be out of fun I Letfs go up to the sick liorse lines, and see if there be anything left there fit to put one leg iu front of another.' Agreed,' criea , lie, heartily enough ; so 1 got hold of aJbutcher's axe for a weapon aud he a sword, and half-drunk as we were, and just iij the condition we had left ofT killing the night, befone, we started oil' for tlio sick horses. But it was no go for a moment here, for there were but two brutes left, aud one of them had a leg .like a pillar letter-box, while the other was down on his Ride, aud ilid not look like rising again. Determined not bo beaten, yte started on font, and making bur way round by Mm reru of the stair, who wero on tho edge of the little rid^c, we ilo.lqed down into tho valley just in the rear of tho position of heavy cavalry. , Fill the pot again, governor, ana Iwty .-in well toil you it was Balaclava morning ami the iicavias bad already charged the Russian cavalry, and emptied a 'good: many saddles. Bussiau ho.scs were caltoyiug about riderlos, aud l'addy and myself parted company to give oUaae to i coypie of these. With sonic trouble I captured my one, a tidy little iron-grey nag, which I judged from bue'sao'dla and accoutrements must have been ftu officer's charger. It was easy to bco front tho etste of the saddle that the former rider had been desperatrly wounded, and the reins too were bloodier than a dainty man would have liked ; but I was noways squeamish, and mounted the little horse in a twinkling. The moment I hail got my seat, I galloped -up to the Heavy Hriftnfle, arid formed' up oopUy }-n the left flunk of the old Royals. They laughed at me : as jt I had, bcart a.clowjl in a pautoioine ? and 1 bad not been inVoeitiou aooupteof minutes when up came Johnny. Lee, their Adjutant, on his old buy mare, at a tearing gauof-, and roared to me tb ' Gb to li — — out of that,' Diere's no mistake, I was n«t much ef a credit ti them. 1 was bareheaded, and my 1 hair was like n birch- Vroom in a fit. I - ' minus a coat, with my shirt-sleeves tin..
