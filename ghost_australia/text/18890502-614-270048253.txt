Old Devices of Photographers. There are various ways for providing sur prising reeulta in photography, things that in one age would have been called magic, bat in ours recognised as scientific tricks. The ghost picture, for instance, in which, a shadowy ghost—through which material objects are visible—is seen between natural attitudes and occupations..That is produced by an almost instantaneous exposure ol the figure that is to do duty as the ghost, fol lowed by a full exposure of the figures aud properties that arc to appear natural. Auother novel trick was shown recently in a photograph reproduced by a prominent trade journal; which presented theproprietor seated at a table, playing ohess with himself, sitting on the opposite side of the table,while be, himself, stood up in the background lookiDg at his. two selves playing. The figures were all on the negative, which was produced by the successive exposures of the plate, parts thereof being masked each time by % black velvet shutter. Still auother sort ol trick is that by which a person who likes that sort of thing may ap pear to be photographed riding upon a Hy ing gooso, or a fish, or any other desired style ol ridiculous locomotion. This is done by the cutjj set holding npon his lop a huge piece of white or sky-tinted card with the fanoifnl figure drawn upon it. His face appears above the upper edge of the card, and seems, in the piature, joined to the funny little body mounted on the goose or fiib. The statue piolure is made by about the satno devise. <
