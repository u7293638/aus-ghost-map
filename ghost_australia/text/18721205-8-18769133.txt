The Bishop of Iiewcastle has been the guest of the Bev Canon White, and he preached in our church on Sunday last, morning and evening On Monday he went out to Denman, to take part m the laying of the foundation stone of the new church about to be erected there, and if I can obtain a full report of the proceedings I willsend it to jou HOSPITAL -The committee have been obliged to draw a portion of the funds invested in the Saving's Bank to pay current accounts 1 am afraid that this is one of the signs of the times. There has been a great falling off in the subscriptions during the last eighteen months, or I might say for the last two years so much so, that considering also that the Go vernment endowment has been considerably reduced, the committee have it m contemplation to reduce the expenses of the Insitution if possible The in- stitution is suffering -lery much at the present time for want of a duly appointed medical man The committee is obliged to call in a doctor, and pay him his regular fee for each visit, and each patient But I believe the committee intend if possible to procure the services of a duly qualified medical gentleman m the beginning of the coming year, and I am perfectly satisfied that a clever man, who would not bo afraid of a ride of twenty or thirty miles, would eventually command an extensive Eractice in this large and important district, so 1 ope that tho committee of the hospital will be for toate enough to obtain the services of such a gentle- man The district has sadly felt the departure of Dr B J Pierce who was ever ready at all times, (no matter what kind of weather, or what hour of the night) to nde any distance, for the purpose of re- lieving suffering humanity I am afraid we shall never see his bice again SCHOOL or ABTS -Headings and recitations tooV place In the hall on Monday evening last, Mr A.

Wm- ¿bwmair, J*unr, and J F Doyle, Esqro., were the sitting magistrates. Tho only business transacted waa the granting of a slaughtering" license [ to Mr H SheathjWhoisabouttooommenoebuainesBM a" butcher in the premises formerly occupied by Messrs B and S Rowland. The application was I made by Mr A. C Quaife, Considering that we have had a copious fall of rain of late, which has caused an abundant supply of feed for the cattle, I think it is high time that the pnco of meat should be lowered, at any rate wa ought to be supplied with good meat* especially as the Upper Hunter is famous, for the splendid fat cattle which it produces, but u alas 1 alas 1" the fat kind do not fall to our lot to eat Bnt now we aro to have A third butcher ia the field, it is to bo hoped that we Bhall have no cause to complain, either of the price or the quality, as a healthy competition goes a long way towards effecting a change in those matters in favour of the general public THE WEATHER.-I donotthink that the oldest inha- bitant can remember such unseasonableweath era» w» are having at the present. TÜL rain commenced on Sunday night, and it has been raining and blowing ever since It seems verj strange to see person* wearing ponchos and greatcoats in the middle of summer, but such is the case here at present. If tho weather does not clear up verj soon the wheat will suffer considerablj, and the settlers will be great losers in consequence, 3rd December
