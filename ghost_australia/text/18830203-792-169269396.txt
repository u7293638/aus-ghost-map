By pious custom an .pojarJ^esj the volume which contains what we call V the Holy Writings,'? or«' the Sacred Scriptures, is called par excellence " The Bible," that is " The Booh," as being, from the nature of it? contents, the most valuable and important of ail hooks- This Book or Dibit is not a single narrate or treatise written by one author, but a collection at short histories or tracts written by at least 35 different hands, pf whoni " Moses was the Bitot and St. John the . Evangelist the last. Moses wrote five hoots or short accounts about 1400 years before Christ, and St. John's book of Jtewlaiione was written between 60 and 70 yfeft,rs after the Ascension. So that the Book, or the Bible, was not written 6ff in a ifreek, or a month, or a year, but at various times extending over ft period of 1600 years. The Book or Bible comprises in ail 80 small or short books or tracts. Of these 80 books or writings, 53 hare been Adopted'from the Jewish Church, wliich was procursive of the Catholic Oimrch, and 27, hooks pre the production of certain ministers of this latter Church, who" wdre ordajnpd po their office as ministers by our divine Lord Himself. The 53 books of Jewish origin form what known as The Old Testament, and tbb other £7 books compose The New Testament. J?or many ages these 80 small bopks were cir,ciliated singly, and were in manuscript, and not printed as wei have them '-now.

In transcribing or copying, Borne words or sentences would sometimes ha accidentally or heedlessly Altered, and hence it comes that we have what Are called •' various readings" in parts of the New Testament. jiut besides this, in the first three or tour qapturiep many persons, actuated by vanity or sornp o tiier foolish niotire, wrote tracts or small books, purporting to be Acts, or Gospels, PrEpr'stles of faot apostolic and doctrine/were authority, in maintained, which errors, These "both spurious " scriptures" occasioned great perplexity and 'disputation among the faithful',' so much so -that the Sovereign Pontiff, Pope Gelasius, ordered a review and collation of all to be made, and in a Synod held at Rome, A.p. 494, that is, pearly. 1400 years ago; after full scrutiny, he, as Pope, declared certain books of writings to be the genuine and authentic Acts, Epistles, and Gospels of the Apostles and Evangelists, which had come down from the beginning and always read in' this solemn offices of the Catholic Church, and that all others' were of no value, or false. So that it is only by the Action of this Pope that anyone is sure of having the bible. It anxious care and vigilance of the Chief Pastor of the Church 1400 years ago that the bible has been verified and transmitted to us as the true "Word of the Spirit," of that Holy Ghost who came down' on the Day of Pentecost to abide with His Church for ever, and guide her in all truth to tho end of the world.

From the AePBEGES to the 2nd G-ospel at the end of oar Catholio service, the solemn office of theCatholic Churoh is a compilation from the bible. The Asperger is a verse from scripture. The Mass then commences with a psalm, other verses from scripture, and proceeds -with the Jitdica, the 42nd Psalm. The Intr.oits are verses from scripture, as are the Gradaak. The Epistle and G-ospel for the day are scripture 5 ; the Lord's Prayer is scripture. The other parts of the service which follow are for the most part the words of scripture* Our evening or Vesper service is all scripture, as are klsb Compline, Lands, Matins, Prime, and all the Hours. The Gfood Friday and Holy Week services, especially the Tenebrte, are all cripture. The whole bible is read through n the year, in die daily and Sunday acts of atholic worship, and yet, in spite of all this, he various sects of Protestant separatists eep up an eternal and Shakefuii Clamour about our contempt for the bible, our ignorance of the bible, our aversion to the "Word of God," and a hundred other calumnious imputations, which have been repeated bo often that Hie slanderfers come at last to believe tbeir-own lie, ,Yet, with all the lip-love our Protestant, friends have for their Protestant translation which tbsy set up for themselves as The Bible, tfiey turned it out of the Victorian State schools, and now, stung apparently by the wailmerited sarcasms hurled upon them by the Advocate, tliey are forming A Beblb LBAOTE for repealing so much of the Education Aot as shall enable them to re-introduce the " bible" into tiie public schools as a readingbook. Bat here comes in a difficulty in the shape of a case of conscience. As they turned the bible out from pure love of." it, and as the Catholios wouldn't be entrapped into patronising the State school by so suspicious and so base a forfeiture of their owd principle, now the Gband Point is to get thebjbl^ bacfc without any compensating advantage ito the Catholics." If the Act U amended in ope direction to' iblige the Protestants, why not apelid it in pother direction to benefit thejOatbolios? We want the bible back, say they ; but we don't want to let those wretches of CatHoIfos get one penny of the Education' grant.
