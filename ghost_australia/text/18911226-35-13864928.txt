AT A COFFEE STALL. , BY De. Jektu.. About half-past 1 in the morning is a fairly good time to enjoy the company that comes to a coffee stall, though coffee stalks are institutions that like certain friends we all know, refuse to be bound down to any fixed hours- The patrons drop in promiscuous like in one-,, twos and sometimes three Sometimes they saunter up leisurely and decorously at other times they stagger along, and seat themselves with mock gravity and solemnity eyeing their host with owl like fixity md vacancy However befuddled, they are always able to steer their knife and fork in their short excursions from plate to mouth The fumbling for corn in every pocket the it comes after is much less skilfully carried out, often taking considerable time A threepence or six pence is generally unearthed in time from a pocket that had previously been examined about twenty times This kind of customer is not the rule, however A large proportion of the clients are cabmen, and when three or four of them got together horses and ' fires" are discussed with volubility, mouthfuls of food and cups of coffee serving to punctuate the discourse Some of them blew a dislike to talking " shop," preferring to air then theories with regard to the see saw of politics, and one has only to listen a short time to find how intimate they are with the proceedings of the gentlemen in M icquane-sfreet One had had many fares " from the Reform Club, and was thus able to enlighten his fellows somewhat Blear-eyed Domain habitues are not uncommon They, as a rule, not in silence, staring stolidly down on their plates Sailors, too, at times come along always jovial, occasionally half-ecus over Now and then the even tenor of things is disturbed by a. troop of telegraph messengers, who plump themselves down, and quickly filling the solitary form, overflow on to the kerbstone, mere striplings, and yet perfectly well able to take care of them body as Many or them have from three to four miles to walk, and thus would not reach their homes until an early hour of the morning At times some one v, armed by a couple of cups of coffee, and inspired by the cheerful music of the clattering knives and forks at work around him will launch out and treat the company to some of his experiences " A meal has a wonderful effect in loosening tongues in this way The story of lose of life in the b lekwoods or of new ventures by sea and is listened to with attention, and then almost invariably someone else comes forward with another to cup it The presiding genius of the show morn while goes on calmly w wiping dishes and brushing away crumbs, putting in an occasional word or two Our coffee-stall in a shower of men To see him gently angling with a bibulous old gentleman minus one leg, who, after having had his fill, desires to leave without soiling her hands by the touch of sordid corn, is a study Is what he always succeeds Being a man of peace and of few words, and a philosopher by nature, he occasionally relinquishes the argument with a drag, and elects to go unpaid But there are coffee stalls and coffee stalls, and if you are to enjoy to the full your midnight sue silent saveloy show by roll, and hot cup of coffee it is essential to have the right build of a still Shun boxod-up cages with the stall-holder inside, with an air of the theatrical pay her" sentry box IN o, my vv weakness is for a state that has daylight (I mean lamplight) all round it, so that you can circumnavigated it for then you are given the opportunity of watching the interesting movements of your cook, seeing him transferring the hot juicy meat pies from the oven, or raising the lid from the pot of steaming potatoes, and if it is a cold frosty night, is firm j our-olf externally before the fire, while your coffee performs a likooihco inferiority The sight of the array of pots, too, is inspiring The in mt comprises saveloys, ourned tongue (shudder not, reader), and hot meat pies You see the bill of fare is couched in plain Anglo Saxon, W with a fine scorn of Gallic appellative es With your meat you can get a homely potato and a mutton, scone, or roll The meal is washed home with tea or coffee A plain repast, but made most acceptable by one simple adjunct-it is enjoyed in the open mr Why will people in a land of sunshine and cool summer nights like this keep slavishly to the custom of their forefathers in colder climes and continue to build and fret and fume in stuffy rooms ' But the futility of hoping for a reign of common sense is borne in upon us when we see our women folk, in obedience to the mandates of an intangible something, which all recognise but no one has seen or heard, sweep with their dresses the refuse of the streets and the dirt of the participants in a way that shocks the goddess Cleauliness Here is a work for the umpiring in this world of the Boulk Will Australia usher in the Reign of Reason Let her give birth to " a new brood, native, athletic, con- tinental, greater than before known " I call to mind one household hero in Sydney that carries out this idea, year round j car out enjoying its meals in the open, but that, as Kipling says, is another story To anyone accustomed to keep respectable hours, it is surprising where in the early hours of the morning so many men come from, and w hat they do But it is only the truth of the old saying that one half the world does not know how the other half lives When the respectable shopkeeper retires at 11 o'clock he thinks the world around retires with him But as he puts his head on his pillow the other half begins to be up and doing A The long stretch of street is deserted and silent, save for the measured tread of the guardian of the law The buildings on either side of the street are shrouded in gloom, and overhead the stars twinkle maliciously, as it in enjoyment lit the troubled sleep of the sons of earth Though so many come along for a midnight however, the street preserves its heavy silence You rarely hear their approach They pop round a corner and are upon you in a moment Presently they are gone, seeming, ghost-like, to v vanish into thin au Musing, and looking aloft, a thin column of smoke is observed arising from a block of buildings borne little distance off Hurrying in the direction of the fire we see some policemen are already there, and the next minute the ino besides dash up at a smart gallop, and before you have time to quite realise the situation the hose is connected and a high-pressure steam is playing on the fiercely burning shop This however, is a right that is often to be seen by day What you cannot see by day is a street as still as the house of the dead one minute and the next filled by a crowd of some hundreds of men, women, and even children Where they turn up from in such a short space of time is a question I leave for abler heads to solve for the benefit of the uninitiated let me say that it is by no means only ore iture comforts that you got from a coffee stall Your purse over shares with cobblers the ratiooinativ o faculty, and his discourse is edifying, that is provided you get him in the right year and have visited him a few times to break the ice He talks when there is a company present, but then he confines himself to goner lUtieb, besides he is busy attending to the wants of his guests, and is always keeping one ear open to any conversation that is going on So if you want to got his previews on men and things, you must got him alone, or nearly done The particular dealer out of those midnight dainties that I am acquainted with is a man of some parts To begin with, he looks out upon life from the vantageground of a oil developed flame He is none of your puny, bringing, shovelled up middlings Though not tall, he has good proportions, and, child in his white apron, with his shirt-sleeves tucked up, he gazes at you openly as he inquires briskly, "Now, what for you, sir?" as though he were behind the bar of a first-class hotel He is not too old of humour either, us I found on cooking enlighten- ment with regard to the existence of one of his meat pies " Yer see, sir, it's like this, we've got to vary 'em a bit when tabbies run short we fall back on black and tans " One night when we were alone "and I had finished a modest thioepennorth, our friend un- bosomed himself a little I had said nothing, and thus his opening remark was a little strange, ' Did ye over, Sir," he inquired, " read ' Draper's Conflict Between Religion and Science-''" I had expected a query with regard to the latestdotcctive story, or possibly Bellamy's much-talked-of book But here, you powers, was a nocturnal stall-man dipping into the vortex of the pot discussions of the Huxloya, Gladstones, und Darwin's When I had recovered from my astonishment, I find a few words to induce him to go on that I might hear more I mentioned another vi oil " Oh, yes," he replied, his face lighting up, "I have the intellectual Development's Europe in three volumes, it's a fine work " And having started him, all I had to do was to listen Thomas Pumo had been an early love of his, and the "Age of Reason" Wim a book to swear by Of course, after the mention of Puino carne Ingersoll, while Darwin and others were not unknown Here was one who had formed his own conclusions, crude if you like, on things sent to sea in the range of 15, he had spent his leisure time in reading sua thinking, thinking and reading, and he had turned over a good many things to no purpose " Some people," he Mud, " never get out of one groove" I mentally absented to this, but said nothing "It's not for want of education either It seems to me tluttho'vo got no mind of their own " I muttered something, and he added, " But I always say, Sir, that they are more to be pitied than anything else " It is good to have much of taste of the honest bread and butter of life after a stir f out of the cake and jam roll existence It acts as a tonic As good a one as I know is at home at a coffee-stall in the still hours of the morning
