The lino screw steamer Hero, Captain Lognn, tho "" first vessel direct from Melbonrno to Maryborough, arrived in Hurvcy's Bay Inst Tuosdav week with 320 stalwart diggers, bound for Gynip o. Owing to tho deep draught, of tho Hero, 16 feet, sho did not go up the river, but transhipped her pnssengcrs to the etcaiuer saawk. Judging from tho appearance of the Hero's passongers, a finer sot of men never landed in the colony. The Blnokbird, nnothor stcamor of tho . Hero class, was to leave 'Melbourne on tho lltli for Maryborough, with thrco or four hundred ntoro diggers. . BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH. PORT DENISON. : arrival.
