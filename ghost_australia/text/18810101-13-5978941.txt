RECOLLECTIONS OF PADUA. By J. S. I wonder whether the one-eyed calenders the Arabian Nights settled in Padua, married monoculous wives, and left numerous des cendants. So many Polyphemnses gathered together in one place I don't think I ever saw. Not only so, but numbers of those not thi afflicted squinted as badly as John Wilke 1 he valit de place at the Croce d Oro wason eyed, albeit ho was as keen sighted m ti matter of a bttonamano as any man po seSBtng the regulation pair of visual organ The old women of the city seemed to 1 uglier than those of Venice, and the wrrakli on their faces looked like multitudinot lines and puckers traced with a steel styh upon a mask of soft leather So tha altogether, the first impression produce upon the mmd by a near view of the Paduar w as not a favourable one But then, in con pensalion, there was the Church of S Antony, with its magnificent shrine, to so nothing of the Arena, and of Giotto's Chapel, and of the venerable associations which gather round a city founded by Antenor—at least Virgil Bays so in the first book of the "AEneid," Hic lamen ille urbem Patavi—and honoured by having been the residence f Livy, who was bom on Paduan territory Si hundred years ago, when some excavation were being made on what is now the site c the roundling Hospital, the workmen du covered a largo sarcophagus of marble, it side of which was found a leaden coflit and inBide of that a coffer of cj press wooc containing the skeleton of a man of larg Btature, whose hand still clasped a might Bword. According to an inscription upon th inner coffin, these were the bones of tha Antenor who, escaping from the victonou Greeks after the fall of Troy, established i Trojan settlement gave the nation a net name, and mmc placida composlus pace qui escit Peaceful enough his ashes lie, under neath a sheltering roof at the corner of i Btreet, where all men may look upon the oh sarcophagus, and so assure themselve that the great epica of " the prince o poets ' and the Mantuan bard were some thing more than idle fictions As to Titu Liuus Patavinus, they point out to you th< place tv here his house stood m the street 0 St John, and whither men of noble birtl from distant Cadiz and remoter Gaul mad' pilgrimages to ' drmk of the rich stream o eloquence" which flowed from thehistonan'i Ups, and they have erected a monument ti his memory in the Palace of Reason Abou the beginning of the fifteenth centur" hu bones- or what were believed to be such were disentombed, and great was the sensa tion produced m Padua 1 hey covered thi relics with cloth of gold, and the most dis linguished men in the city and the universit; competed for the honour of bearing then to a resting placo of honour in thi Palace aforesaid The jawbone of thi skull was deposited m the Cancellana and Alfonso the Magnanimous, King 0 Arragonandof the Two Sicilies, sent aspects embassy to beg the gift of the arm and haue which had written the immortal "Annals' The application was complied with, and the precious bones were enclosed in a sumptuous shrine. But, alas ' for the dangors of hero worship, it has been recently ascertained bej ond all dispute that the skeleton was thai of a slave, who, having been enfranchised bj hm master, vvlioBe name happened to be the some as that of the historian, assumed the patronymic out of gratitude, subsequently rose to eminence in Padua, and was buried where his remains were afterwards found, and mistaken for those of his illustrious compatriot Padua is one of those cities which yon take kindly to from the force of old associa- tion. Geoffrey Chaucer must have walked its streets in company with Petrarch, when the author of the Canterbury Tales was sent on an embassy to Italy m 1373, for it was there he obtained the story of "Patient Gri7zel from Lauras immortal lover, having, he says " Learned it at Padua of a worthy clerk So proven bj his word and by his work Hs 1b dead now, and nailed in his chest, I praj to God to tit c his soul (,ood rest, F rancis Potrareh the poot laureate, Tilla scholarhltht Petrarch was one of the canons of the cathe dral here, and although he was buried in the little village of Arqua, 10 miles off, his memory is preserved by a bust in the Duomo, which also possesses a picture of the Madonna, bequeathed to it by him. Then, again, our old friend Benedick in "Much Ado About Nothing carno from Padua, which was also the residence of that learned Bellano who furnished Portia with such ex- cellent opinions and pleadings in that memo rabie case, Sbylock versus Antonio, tried before the Doge of Venice, and fully re ported by a certain William Shakspeare Lastly, it waB to " fair Padua, nursery of arts,' that Petrucio came " to wive it wealthily, and if wealthily tbon happily, and wooed and won and tamed that shrewish beauty Katharine, sister to Bianca, and daughter to Battisto. It ib astonishing how very real all these people become, and how some of them seem to be still living, aB you pass through the streets of the city. I am sure I saw flor teiiBio taking an ice at the Cafe Pedrocchi, and Grumio marketing in the Piazza delle Erbe I think I know the shop m which the bride bought her wedding dress , and I am quite positive about tbe house old Gremio lived m, which was then rich in 1 Fino linen Turkey cushions boss d with pearl, Valance of \enlco gold In needlework, 1 evvter and brass and all things that oclontr lo house or housckcotlng ' It is dilapidated now, but the huge valves which give admission to the courtyard are still strong enough to resist a battering ram, and the bronze knocker, with its central figure of Neptune, flanked by lions, must weigh half a hundredweight at least. There s room enough to turn a coach and six in the porte cochere, and to manouvre a regiment of soldiers in the courtyard In the centre is a well, Burmounted by some beautiful scroll work in metal, and crowned by a coronet Two sides of the quadrangle are on closed by tha massive walls of a palazzo, now tenanted by many families of poor people, some member of which seems to be always engaged in drawing water from the well, and the other two aides by stables and out offices, which are quite disused and falling to decay. They have a musty smell and a faded look, and are probably haunted by the ghosts of Barbary horses and riemish mares whose sleek Bkins once shone like satin be neath the busy hands of dead and forgotten grooms Bank grasB has struggled up be tween the chinks and crannies of the well worn paving stoneB, and the courtyard is con nected by a double arched gateway with a large ¡garden beyond, in which the vegetation has run completely wild " Tho beds w ero all untouch d by hand or tool, No footstep marked tho damp and mossy gravel, Each walk as rrrconas Is tho mantled pool For want of human travel " Tho vino unprun d, and tho neglected peach Droop d from tho wall with which thoy used to grapple. And on tho canker d trco In cosy roach, Rotted tho golden spplo I wonder whether the old man took his jilt- ing by Bianca and her runaway marriage with Lucentio so much to heart that he neglected hi worldly affairs, and allowed his property to fall to decay. The theory is one that fits the present condition of this decay- ing mansion as well as any other, and there- fore I see no reason why I should not adopt it. Stepping out into the hot streets from the cool quadrangle, I see huge waggons from the country, laden with casks of wine, lum bering along the thoroughfare, drawn by large, placid, cream coloured oxen, with eyes like Juno s, and I find the covered foot paths full of shoemakers, tailors, and saddlers, working outside of their reapsctive shops for the eako of a better light and of an occasional gossip with tho passers by _If you are willing to throw off your English morgue, and be companionable, you will be able to leam the family history of each, their tastes, their habits, their personal pre possessions, and their strong antipathies And the dialogue will be accompanied, ac- centuated, and illustrated by such dramatic gestures and such animated pantomime that you will find the conversation "as good as a play"—a good deal better, indeed, than some it has been my misfortune to witness. Carvers and gilders and manufacturera oi ecclesiastical ornaments seem to be doinf a busy trade, and the number of jewellera ahopa aeems to be out of all propor tion to the population Porhapa thej derivo their chief Bupport from the students of the University , although these are by no means so well off as the Bame class of young mon at Oxford or Cambridge Middle aged citizens walk up and down the shady aide ol the squares fanning themselves , and at most of the street corners, there ia an image of the Virgin, with a lamp burning before it,and two or three bunchea of flowera deposited at ita feet How indeatruetiblo these two old beliefs and customs are ! Here are the old lates viales of classic Rome occupying then ancient places, under a now name, and receiving the same floral tributes as were offered to them hundreds of j ears ago Let us cross the hot square, with the fine equestrian statue of Erasmo de Narni, by Donatello, in the centre, and visit the shrine of St. Anthony, in the church of that name, crowned bj eight domes, which remind you of St Marks in Venice Pushing aside tho leather curtain covering fho doorway, you plunge into a cool and manj coloured twi lifcht, to which the ej o requires to bo gradu | ally accustomed before it can make out the figures moving about so silentlj in the solemn gloom, or measure the distance at which those red glass lamps are hung The building is grandly proportioned, and the shrine itself l8 really magnificent The chapel containing it is separated from the church by five archeB, from which depend 12 gold and silver lamps, which aro kept burning day and night It is rich in priceless sculptures li ron 7.0 angels, gold candelabra, polished marble of various colours, and noble statuary adorn the place The sarcophagus sustains the altar, and tho former is encrusted with votive offerings from people who profeSB to have been healed by the balsamic odours which are alleged to issue from the saint s remains "Heretics, writeB] Dr Morre, who v ísited the tomb a hundred j ears ago, " assert that the per- fume-for perfume there certainly is proceeds from certain balsams rubbed on the marble every morning, before the votaries come to pay their devotions I never presume to give an opinion on contested points of thiB kind, but I may be allowed to say that if this sweet odour really proceeds from the holy Tranciscan, he emita a very different smell from any of the brethren of that order whom I ever had an opportunity of approaching Numerous pictures, vilely painted—one re- presenting a woman tumbling down a cellar, another a house on fire, a third a shipwreck, a fourth a chaise upset, and so on—com- memorate the casualties which the saint is supposed to have prevented from being at tended by a fatal result In most of them he is represented as interceding with theVirgin in the clouds People come up, and, laying their hands upon the green marble sarcophagus, bow their heads in prayer Others, kneeling, kiss it I saw one poor woman approach it with a withered child in her arma She placed its dwindled hand upon the tomb, and pressed its white lips upon the cold stone, as if she imphcitlj believed that some vital force would pass out of it into the ahrunken anatomy of her Ticketty offspring and I hope she went home sustained by the comforting delusion A blind old man waa led up to the shrine, and Btretched forth a pair of wrinkled claws in supplication to the saint, and a woman, para lyaed upon one side, and very feeble on the other, leaned her head against the unresponsive stone, as though contact with it were capable of filling her decrepid frame with the quick pulses of a voung and lusty life In her belief, nothing was im possible to the mouldering bones of lum who is senouslj described as having compolled a sw arm of beea to make him a ball o£ wax in which to put the consecrated host, and as having caused a mule to leave off eating her oats, in order that he might worship the sacred symbol If jou want to gauge the depths of human superstition, j ou must con verBe with the more devout of the Italian women of the poorer class, and read aome of the cheap " Li vea of the SaintB, ' and aimilar pubhcationa which circulate amongst them Ou the other hand, if you wish to comprehend the majesty and beauty of Italian art just look at those glorious bronzes by Donatello which adorn the high altar, and that Buperb candelabrum upon which Andrea Riecio was engaged for 10 years , the magnificent cruci- fix, also by Donatello, and the bronze statues of SS Proadocimua and Louis, by Tiziano Minio You might spend a week inside the church of St Anthony without exhausting jour admiration of its art treasures, its pictures, its bas reliefs, its monuments, and its sumptuous bronzes, gold and silver work, and statuary But there is bo much to see in Padua that deliberate study of separate works ib out of the question There ia the Palace of Reaaon, for example, which figures bo conspicuously in Mr Callow s charming watercolour drawing in the International Exhibition It is in dimensions a treble cube, 210ft long, 80ft wide, and 80ft high, with the largest roof, unsupported by pillars, in the world The walla are painted with the ruling planets and constellations of the year, and the windows are so arranged that the entering Bunhght travels in each successive month along tho representatives of those planets The hall ia also crossed by a meridian line, and the solar roy paBsea through an aperture decorated with a golden face in the roof A vast wooden horse, executed by Donatello, and a lapis vitupera of black granite, upon which debtors formerly attested their insolvency which was then a deed of infamy-are among the curious relics exhibited in this gloomy hall In the Arena—once the site of a Roman amphitheatre—stands the Chapel of Giotto. Passing under a battlementcd gateway, and through a garden glowing with flowers and thick with fruit trees, mantled by the '"gad ding vine," you reach an oblong building of moderate dimensions, with a small choir and apsis at the further end, the roof arched, the ceiling a deep blue, powdered with stars, and the panelled walls are red with paintings by the father of Italian art. There is no need to describe them, for they have been accurately reproduced and published by the Arundel Society. For purity of feeling and nobility of treatment they have scarcely been excelled. You look at them with all the greater interest because some of them owed their inspiration to Dante, who was the painter's guest for some time, while this great work was in progress. In recompense for this hospitality the poet has embalmed the artist's name m verse etei ne, in illustration of the mutability of human fame:— In painting Cimabue thought that he Should hold the field; now Giotto has the cry, So that the other's fame is growing dim. So has one Guido from the other taken The glory of our tongue, and he perchance Is bom who from the next shall chase them both."' On the south side of the city lies the beau- tiful promenade—the Prato della Voile— elliptical in form, and surrounded by an avenue of trees and by a stream of running water, upon which the grateful Paduans have erected nearly 80 statues, commemorative of local and national celebrities, and in the distance rise the Euganean hills, from among which Shelley looked down upon the city, and apostrophised it in some memorable lines, and where Ugo Foseólo wrote thoso eloquent and pathetic Leitete di Jacopo Orlts, which are so full of allusions to this Padoia al palude, and to the poet whose SBhes sleep m Arqua. And so some of tho faireat scenes in nature associate themselves with the human life that has throbbed upon her boBom, and her beauty that appeals to the eye is heightened and consecrated by memories that are the antique furniture and choicest possessions of the mind behind the eye.
