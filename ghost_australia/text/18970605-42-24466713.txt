Once Was Enough. "Like a good many young men who have more imagination than experience, I started out to be a detective." The speaker was an American who buys real estate when »ouie one has to .sell, and sells when some one is anxious to buy. " By sheer chance I happened to be on the ground when a new agency was be ing formed, and found employment. There was a reign of terror then be cause of burglaries and hold-ups, just as there now is in many cities. On a cer tain evening one of the wealthiest men ,1n the country was robbed by footpads, and I was put on the case. I found his watch in a pawnshop, and watched patiently there till the thief appeared with a gold matchbox set with dia monds. " Bent on doing the job alone, I shadowed him home with a view to get ting the rest of the plunder and the rest of the offenders, If there happened to be a gang. My man did not make a bluff, much less a fight. He gave up the pawn^.i tickets, surrendered most of the money taken, and declared himself my prisoner. As I was about to slip the cuffs on his iWrlsts he asked me to step for a minute •into the next room. There was a woman that looked about as substantial fisa ghost, and three little children in rags, crying for something to eat. Not a word was said, and when we were back In the main room the man extend ed hie hands for the wristlets. 1 took !hh) right hand, gave it a hearty shake and told him to provide in some honest .way for those in the other room. " On the way back to the agency I was stopped by a revolver near the end of my nose, and the money I had recap tured was taken from me. The robber .was the man I had just spared, and he grinned as he told me that I happened to drop in on him while he had his gun apart cleaning it. He was just stopping there temporarily and had nothing to do with those who had so stirred my pity. • "I mailed my resignation to head quarters, and left for another city."
