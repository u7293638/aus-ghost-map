LONDON WEEK BY WEEK (By Emily Soldene.) London, October 12. We are going to have a great season, so the West End tradespeople say, and they ought to know. Pearls and gold and precious stones— treasures of India, and the latest confection from the Paris ateliers—art in all its forms and ever- increasing developments, find ready purchasers at lavish prices. * * * * The old form of extravagance—the extravagance of the Middle Ages. The most expensive of furs are laid on velvet and plush, appliqued with gold, and cut away in arabesque patterns—collars and cuffs are edged with tiny jewels. * * * * We are full of prosperity. We have no un- employed. In spite of the German, we are full of foreign orders, and people work double time in frantic efforts to fill them. Everybody’s wages are from 5 to 10 per cent. better than they used to be. Everybody’s glad—even the agricultural districts are looking up, and Hodge is gradually growing jubilant. * * * * Good times coming back to the swell restaur- ants. If you want a table you must book it at least a day in advance. Fancy, what a time it will be when the warriors return. * * * * The Stock Exchange proposes banquetting the C.I.Vs. Everybody’s worried because it is so difficult to find a place sufficiently large to dine the whole lot at once. * * * * “They’re coming home!” “They’re coming home!” Every eye sparkles and every heart speaks. There’s to be a thanksgiving service at St. Paul’s. Dean Gregory and the Lord Mayor arranged the particulars on Wednesday. “Home, sweet Home!” Who was it remarked what a capital place “Home, sweet Home” was to stay away from? * * * * We seem to see the first faint ripple of the ap- proaching tide. The C.I.V.’s left Capetown Sun- day evening by the Aurania. The Cape Band played “Auld Lang Syne.” The departing ones sang “God Save the Queen.” I imagine “The Girl I Left Behind Me” would have been more appropriate to the occasion. * * * * Just heard Peckham will banquet the Peckham contingent of the C.I.Vs. Goodness knows what Upper Tooting will do. * * * * The whole thing is too lovely. After playing a great part in this world’s stirring war, the men return to their offices, shops, business, and su- burban boarding-houses (don’t forget the 1500 C.I.V.s. were bachelors, or as nearly as possible bachelors) —return to settle down to the “as you were before you were” avocations and pursuits— no fuss, no bother. * * * * At least that is the idea; but no one, except those who have gone through it, know the dread- ful unrest that comes to people who have trodden paths before unknown—slept in the open—breath- ed the free, fresh, pure air of the “inadequately populated” —seen the tropical stars in the sum- mer night, the mountains lifting their crests to heaven, the rising and setting of the sun, making golden the sands of the desert, and crowning with rosy radiance every visible thing. * * * * Well, of course, I would not like you to men- tion it, but I think, for many reasons, the re- sumption of the domestic idyll will be, for some natures, more than difficult. * * * * We all turned out to see the first Governor- General of the Australian Commonwealth off (from Victoria, you know). Not much of a spectacle. No drums or trumpets; no mounted escort; no nothing of that kind. Just the ordinary 11 a.m. Continental mail—a reserved saloon car- riage—heaps of flowers, and troops of friends. * * * * “Troops of friends!” —What can the world give more? * * * * Lord and Lady Hopetoun were attended by Lieutenant Duff, A.D.C. * * * * Among those on the platform were Mr. Marsh (private secretary to the Right Hon. J. Cham- berlain), Lord Churchill (Lord-in-Waiting to the Queen), the Hon. Sidney Greville (Equerry to the Prince of Wales, and private secretary to the Marquis of Salisbury), the Marquis of Aber- gavenny, the Earl of Aberdeen, the Earl of Jer- sey, Major Lardner-Clarke (representing Sir Andrew Clarke, Agent-General for Victoria), Sir J. Cockburn (Agent-General for South Australia), Sir E. Wittenoom (Agent-General for West Aus- tralia) and Lady Wittenoom, Sir Horace Tozer (Agent-General for Queensland), the Hon. Claude Willoughby, the Hon. Major Candy, Mr. Adrian Hope, Colonel Morgan Crofton, Mr. Henniker Heaton, M.P., Mr. Holmes, and Mr. J. Ethering- ton (from the Institute of Naval Architects, of which Lord Hopetoun was president), and repre- sentatives of the Lord Chamberlain’s Office, the War Office, the Colonial Office, and the Foreign Office. * * * * Where was Mr. Copeland? * * * * As the train started, Lord Jersey called for “Three times three,” and it ran out of the station under a fusillade of cheers. * * * * We are enthusing a great deal over the federa- tion and its affairs. People are anxious about Lord Hopetoun’s health — “aged a deal lately”— “looks delicate” — “and, as everybody knows, is a very poor traveller.” * * * * It seems a penalty paid for official greatness to be pitied as a “poor traveller.” Poor traveller! Rubbish! A certain gubernatorial lady has the interesting reputation of being a poor traveller. Well, I went a voyage with this lady. She was not a poor traveller. She was a lady who ren- dered herself superior to circumstances over which she had much control. * * * * The Royal visit is distressing a lot of quid- nuncs. “Who’s to pay the ex.’s? Not those poor colonial people, I hope.” “And I don’t think the Duchess should accept any diamond necklaces, and that sort of thing, you know.” * * * * The English have good cause to rejoice at the federation of Australia. Once more they have given a proof of their remarkable practical spirit in according to their Australian colonies with a good grace the liberty which they were not in a position to refuse to them. They have thus se- cured their sympathy for the future. From the French and European point of view there is no great reason to rejoice at the birth of this new republic. “The Australian States, masters of their finances, their army, and their navy, cannot fail to powerfully develop their exterior means of action.— “Revue Militaire,” Paris. * * * * Remember I told you how the Paris Ex- position tired one? Other people find it so, too: Read the following: “Many of the Parisians are suffering from ‘Exhibition feet,’ a very tiring and troublesome form of disease. Picture galleries and exhibitions are wont, as we all know, to bring on fatigue, but the Exhibition is so vast, and the distances are so great, that one is ever- lastingly going up and down enormous staircases or over bridges, while in between the unfortu- nate visitor has to trudge over shingle. This, and the heat, soon bring on ‘Exhibition feet.’ They become swollen, tired, and hot, and walk- ing under such circumstances is an impossibi- lity. * * * * Still pegging away at the elections. I send you a good American story of a long ago election. No beastly nonsense about the present Presidential election. I see they nearly killed Roosevelt the other day— Roosevelt of the Rough Riders, who did such good service in the Cuban War. * * * * Two men arrested for the assault on the Lord Mayor’s son. The patient is too ill to attend the court. Now to the story. * * * * A man out West, named Smith—or at least well call him Smith—worked heart and soul and body for the return of Buchanan. Well, as all the world knows, Buchanan was elected, and Smith, who had a sick wife, wrote asking for a consulate on the Mediterranean coast, that sunny shore be- ing recommended by the doctor as likely to do the wife good. * * * * Smith waited, and, possessing his soul in pa- tience, waited yet again. At last—O joyful mo- ment! —the official intimation arrived. He was appointed Consul at some little town in “Ice- land.” * * * * Then Smith sat right down and wrote a reply — “To one James Buchanan, President of These Uni- ted States. ‘Since applying to you, some months ago, for a consulate on the balmy shores of the Mediterranean, my wife, who was ill, has gone to Heaven, and you can go to ——’ ” * * * * I seem bursting with stories to-day. Here is one about the Anglican Father Stanton, for twen- ty years curate at St. Alban’s, Holborn. He is supposed to be the original of John Strong, in Hall Caine’s “Christian.” Physically, perhaps, but not psychologically, for, unlike that irritating young man, Father Stanton is always ready with his joke. * * * * Well, the other day, in dropped the Bishop at the service. And at the end “Daddy” (as he is known locally) escorted the great man to his car- riage. When his Lordship was comfortably set- tled, he leant forward to the window and spoke to the curate: “I like your service, Stanton; it is all right, all right; but I don’t like your incense.” “I am very sorry, my lord, but it’s the best to be had—3s 6d a pound.” * * * * THE HALL OF WASTED THINGS. At the Castle of Men’s Sorrows, in the Hall of Wasted things. Are broken old betrothals, and old betrothal rings. And long- forgotten kisses, and old letters never sent, And heartstrings of young lovers that faithless ones have rent, And long-since burnt-out passions, and the fires of wasted loves, And cast-off maidens’ ringlets, and pairs of maidens’ gloves, And smiles that men have treasured and sweet glances gone astray, And broken words of lovers, and hours of many a day. Now with these I’d fain deposit some few things of my own — Some paltry, wasted trifles that someone has out- grown; This tiny, battered locket, and this bit of gem-set gold, And the love I’ve left unspoken, and the love I may have told; May they lie and be forgotten, where the grey-robed Angel sings— The Angel of Oblivion, in the Hall of Wasted Things. * * * * Lovely weather for Newmarket. Great com- pany. H.R.H., who is staying at the club, was evidently enjoying himself. His Highness has not been to the races for a long time, in con- sequence of the Court being in mourning. Well, now the Court is out of mourning, and “Bertie” hies him away to his favorite sport. * * * * The American jockey craze is still running strong. Last year’s Caesarewitch winner, Scintillant, entered this year for the same event, to be ridden by F. Wood, was on Wednesday morning quoted 25 to 1. Then a rumor got about that Lester Reiff was to ride the horse, and Scintillant went up to 100 to 8. When the rumor was discovered to be unfounded, Scintillant re- tired to his old price. * * * * H.R.H. and the Duke of Cambridge went early, and stayed late; in and out of the paddock, watching the saddling, the parade, etc. Many great ladies. Duchess of Devonshire wore dark blue; her two daughters—Lady Gosford and Lady Alice Stanley—in brown and heliotrope. Lady Trafford, also in dark blue; Lady Marcus Beres- ford, in a tailor-built. * * * * Don’t this bring old days in the Town Hall, Sydney, to your mind? It does to mine: “Lady Jersey, accompanied by Lord Leigh, and Mr. Char- les Murray, yesterday opened a bazaar at Coven- try in aid of one of the parish churches. Lady Jersey made a long speech, in which she re- ferred to the wave of Imperialism and the good fruit it bore.” * * * * Have just heard of Mme. Alva’s windfall of £35,000 from an Australian. A tribute to her goodness of heart.” ”I’m waiting for that sort of thing. I expect I’ll keep on waiting.” “Sa- lute,” Hetty, more power to you. Of course I shall call and congratulate her; one never ne- glects that kind of friend. * * * * I see by the papers that “Mme. Alva and Mr. St. John Brenon” were at Beatty Kingston’s funeral. * * * * Talking about funerals, who do you think is married? Why, Mrs. Crotty. Married last week at St. Martin’s-in-the- Fields, to Mr. “Jack” Watt, manager of the Durban branch of the Bank of South Africa. * * * * When Mrs. Crotty left Melbourne she came to London,, and stayed with Mme. Alva. Mrs. Crotty’s health, after all her worries, was indifferent. She had a long rest, got strong, and went to South Africa as a nurse— nursed Mr. “Jack” Watts back to life from a severe attack of enteric— and St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields was the result thereof. * * * * A splendid lunch at the Metropole—lovely pres- ents, diamond necklaces, diamond bracelets, a brougham, a Ralli cart. * * * * Enough to make the sainted Crotty turn in his grave. * * * * Remember! He was a millionaire, and left his wife £100 a year—or £300 a year if she would go into a convent. * * * * But—she went to South Africa instead. * * * * Kipling at the war. A copy of his passport: “Pass Mr. Kipling anywhere at any time.” — (Signed) “Roberts.” * * * * There’s a new restaurant in the city—down in the depths deeper than the depths of the Tup- p’ny Toob. It is called the “Throgmorton” — al- ready vulgarised into the “Throg”—designed, built, and made lovely for the delectation and re- cuperation of the Stock Exchange, its entourage, its clients, and for all who like to pay, pay, pay, don’t you know. * * * * But not for the sacred committee. No. Don’t you feel afraid at the mere mention of so select a body? The secrets of the Council of Ten was nothing to the secrets of the committee- room of the Stock Exchange; and so they do not lunch in public. All their goings-on are in camera. * * * * Good lunch they get, too. Best of everything — birds, beasts, and fishes, to say nothing of the wines “and” cigars; also the fruit. I know—I’m intimate with the fly on the window pane. * * * * “The Throg” is run by Lyons, Limited—a regu- lar house beautiful, a glorified edition of the Marble Bar at Sydney. * * * * Can’t very well go into these essentially mas- culine resorts, you know. Let me tell you my ideal city luncheon—old-fashioned oyster patties, at old-fashioned Birch’s, an old- fashioned Corn- hill; iced punch or Madeira. * * * * Madeira? Yes, absolutely—been round the Cape and all the rest of it; about 3s 6d a glass. But Birch’s grandson, or great grandson, great-great- grandson, warrants it, and one is obliged to be- lieve anything of origin so ancient, of reputation so respectable. * * * * Then another good thing. About 1.30 p.m., after you’ve been to the bank to draw those dividends, or to your broker to put up a little more margin on those rotten American Rails, a plate of “real turtle” at the Ship and Turtle, Leadenhall-street. * * * * That runs Birch’s very closely. Still there is one thing left — “real natives,” at Sweeting’s, 4s 6d a dozen. Stand at the marble counter (which is just about as high as one’s nose), and as fast as the opener puts them before you, slither them down like the men. * * * * Afraid you’ll think me a dreadful gourmet. Goodness, I forget—is it gourmet or gourmand ? * * * * Wish you could see our parks just now. Green grass—lots of it; trees all the colors of the rain- bow—green, brown, fawn, yellow, red, rosy, pale pink. See the leaves fall softly, and stirred by the faintest breeze pursue each other; see the winds whisper across the lakes—only a ripple; see the ducks, the swans, the pigeons, the spar- rows; the air clear and fresh; the distant murmur of the unseen multitudes. A morning in the London parks is lovely just at present. * * * * We’re in for a cyclone next week, they say. * * * * Miss Coygirl: “Jack Softleigh told me last night that I ought to accept him, because he is willing to prove his love for me.” Her Friend: “Well what did you say?” Miss Coygirl: “I said I couldn’t see it in that light.” Her Friend: “Then what did he say?” Miss Coygirl: “Nothing. He just turned the light out.” * * * * We’re full up with new plays. “The Prince of Peace” at Drury Lane—a great success of adven- titious aids — a mixture of De Rougemont and those “Stories of a Diplomat” written by Every- body and published by Everybody in Everybody’s Magazine. * * * * Clement Scott, in his new Journal, the “Free Lance,” is awfully down on the accuracy of the stage manager. * * * * Our own Clement is bound, like Homocea, to be on the spot. * * * * “The Likeness of the Night”—the “ghost” from which Mrs. W. K. Clifford says “A Debt of Honor” was (unconsciously) materialised—is to be produced next week by Mr. and Mrs. Kendall at Liverpool. * * * * And where the red was, lo, the bloodless white. And where truth was the likeness of a liar. And where day was the likeness or the night; This is the end of every man’s desire. * * * * That verse, I imagine, is the leit motif of Mrs. Clifford’s play. * * * * At Wyndham’s Theatre “Mrs. Dane’s Defence,” in the performance of which Miss Lena Ashwell scores, and Miss Mary Moore’s nose is put out of joint. Well, of course, these things are not pleasant. I should not be surprised if Mr. Henry Arthur Jones—(Oh, yes, that’s right: Henry Arthur Jones is all over the place)—new piece did not have a long run. * * * * “Auld Lang Syne,” at the Lyceum Saturday night, will not, I think, set the Thames on fire. Still, it’s better to know before you prophesy. * * * * Sir Henry Irving has been taking a long rest. A heavy and most successful season in the States made this, if not absolutely necessary, a politic move. He opens in Manchester next Monday week; will tour till Christmas; a short rest, a spring tour, and in April, 1901, the Irving Com- pany will open at the Lyceum, London. * * * * I must tell you that most of the new plays are of the one-man- and-two-women—or two-men-and- one-woman—order. * * * * I ought to be able to do something effective in that way. Nothing like experience, you know. * * * * “They say a carrier pigeon will go farther than any other bird,” said the boarder, between bites. “Well, I’ll have to try one,” said the landlady. “I notice a fowl doesn’t go far!” * * * * “Well, little chap,” said the stranger in the family, picking up one of the children, “what are you going to be when you’re a man?” “Nuffin’,” said the child. “Nothing? Why?” asked the stranger. “Because I am a little girl.” * * * * She (archly): “Whom should you call the pret- tiest girl in this room?” He (looking about him): “H’m! Well, to tell the truth, there isn’t a pretty girl in the place.”
