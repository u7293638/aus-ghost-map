EVENING MEETING. ADDRESS BY THE NEWLY ELECTED CHAIRMAN. CRUISE IN THE CENTURY. The evening session was devoted to the delivery of a presidential address by the newly elected chairman of the union, the Her N J Cocks, MA, on the subject " Christ in the Century " The gather- ing took place in the Pitt-street Church, and was pre- sided over by the retiring acting chairman, the Rev F Binns there was a large congregation After devotional exercises;, conducted by Mr Binns, and the hymn " Forward be Our Watch- word," sung by the congregation, the chairman delivered his address The Chairman said We have come now so near the end of this century, the thought of it is with us naturally whenever we stand, us we do to-night, to take a wide view of the Kingdom of God Yet, partly because of its very greatness, we find it by no means easy to represent that which, like some stretch of illimitable ocean, appeals dimly and profoundly to our imagination Then, too, one always has a difficulty in picturing . division of time that is merely artificial A day is framed between the rising and the setting of the sun A year is encircled by that round of changes in earth and air and sky we call the seasons A lifetime, held between mysterious birth and death, unites us conscious when we look upon it of the trailing clouds of glory at the dawn and the sacred light at eventide But there is no such peculiar grace or majesty in the opening and close of a century It is a cycle of time that begins and ends for human thought Stone Perth ips all that the conception of its great course can do is, as the sweep of a planet in the heavens opens up the unfathomable depth of space, to suggest to our hearts the reality and grandeur of the abode of Him who inhabits eternity When, however, we turn from the period itself to the span of humanity it contains we see that which at once claims and over- powers our attention It is probable no other son tury in the history of the world has been marked by so great and su 'h varied progress too wide and deep for any man altogether to comprehend it, we see it rise and shine before us a magnificent and bewildering complexity of life And it is evident, unless we are willing to lose the privilege of the season, we must try earnestly to grasp the significance of those hundred years When the mountain has been passed it is too late to look for the vision the summit could show though we may be overwhelmed therefore by its splendid ful- ness, we must attempt to gauge the strength and to fathom the depth of this great tide of humanity in order that such an endeavour should gain any lasting success certain conditions are absolutely essential We all know to some extent the magnitude of the varied energies that have manifested themselves in this century We know too, that, like some mighty current bidden beneath the (glancing of the sunlight the rising and falling of the waves, the darkening of the storm shadow, there his through all the mingled his of all these years been a great upward movement It is necessary that we should know also the principle behind all these manifold activities, and the direction and end of the whole course of this our human development For with such knowledge only we shall have crago to go forward the principle of unity who seek in our present purpose, behind all the perplexing phenomena of a century of human life, is known to our hearts at least-the infinite and eternal spirit of truth, whom we worship as God the Holy Ghost We heard it insisted most vehemently and with many a circumstance of proof that science or literature, or political economy, or even some special social or religious organisation, is about the glory of the century, and that all the rest of the manifold life of the time has been contributed like soil and manure to the growth of the great and rare flower Umso arguments, however, though they are urged with power, being no convincing proof The picturing of life as a pilgrimage may be made profoundly instructive and surpassingly beautiful, as it has been by Bunyan and it may also be made utterly foolish and futile It will be wise for us who have a place in the privilege and destiny thus announced to look upon what is advanced on the side of responsibility When participation in the glory that comes from many generations is allowed to lead to pride of power it is nothing less than a destroying curse the influence it should court has been well suggested by him who is called to-day the poet of the Empire when he prays woman not forget and tells of the dominion over interim races as a burden of duty to be borne And we who belong to the life of this new land may well take to ourselves the call that sounds clearly for us here To make us a nation there is far more needed than that we should organise out colonies according to the best form of co\ uni- ment we can (devise We must live as befits those who belong to the Anglo-Saxon people chosen for its character formed by its religion to become the witness and the arm of God's righteousness in all the earth And when we remember the carelessness and want of deep unity there is amongst us we may well cry, " Who is sufficient for these things > ' Illustrated by this, people therefore, shall try to see the advance of humanity in this century, and to Ram there from how the world is being prepared to receive fully and royalty Finn who is our Lord and life The theory was advanced long ago by those who held the extreme of simplicity to be the ideal of life that, within four bare walls, i woollen bed, and an iron cup were all that was needed for the wise man But when the home was Remembered the theory was acknowledged broken at once- a child "cannot be that kind of stone as soon as it is born " The manner of life that has thus been attained for so many does really mean a home, and a place where it you will Jesus will come, and join train mg par t flora the much serving may sit awhile at His feet So, though it be a paradox, this increase of material comfort has brought for many the possibility of a closer discipleship with than, who are calling men to follow Him, told them that He had nowhere to lay H R head When one compares even in a casual way the aim of teaching in our day made the earlier time he is possessed by a deep thankfulness The methods may be mechanical wooden sometimes but they keep the children near to their childhood What books- have done in this country one can hardly begin to tell The world we live in has been opened up, and made enchanting by the accounts of travel the ages if mankind have been revealed in their truth and greatness by the lives of noble and characteristic men the universe which only the mind can journey to and explore has been laid open before us in such a plain jet wonderful way that the way faring man can walk there and the highest genius be more than content the efforts that have been made, successfully to some degree towards regulating the employment of women and modifying the long hours and severer conditions of many branches of men's labour, as well as the legislation for the extension of political power, are all expressions of the great religious idea that equal opportunity should be provided for all men and therefore they are evidence that the strong have to some extent been taking up the burden of the a sak Looking, then, at this brief way, upon the life of our time, we cannot help feeling that there is more than the promise of Christ's reign here-there is the preparation, there is the beginning of it. And we are made to sing, for prophecy once was always with music, " Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given" and the government shall be upon His shoulders The preparation of the world at which we have glanced has opened up to our view a very wide field and a great mass of material made ready for building We have also been conscious of a wonderful moving harmony that suggested to our minds the great and I fair proportions of the building that is to be But now we shall look for a little at what has been accomplished in the name and the life of our Lord and Saviour, at the city that is being built to music and forever " It always must seem strange to us that there can be so little knowledge on the part of the world of the life that amongst us and in all the peoples of the earth is rising in the silent beauty and spiritual strength of love-the very life of Jesus on earth, is a revelation growing and perpetual Yet it will probably always so-that the eternal is unseen And our feeling will be like that of the shepherds who, with the memory of the angel's singing at midnight, and the sight of the mother and babe at Bethlehem could not understand why all the world did not wonder and worship with them Even with regard to the more external side of the Church, its extension and organisation, there is always an impossibility in presenting a true and adequate view to the world When one attempts it he unconsciously doing from necessity that the foolish citizen did from ignorance, who cut his picture down to suit the size of the frame Such a limited amount of space is given for the presentation to me, of that which we know to be ultimately. of paramount importance When we come ourselves, however, to look upon that which has been wrought in Christ throughout the earth, we find how great and majestic the true Church really is Those who were exploring the treasures of Egypt found in the ancient temple of Kai nee one of the most wonderful buildings in the world Dion when they examined the interior they discovered a Christian church So we find within the life of the world, wide and magnficent as it is, a living structure that will grow until it comprehends the very humanity by which now it is hidden But the truth itself is more striking and powerful than any illustration or description of it can possibly be so we shall look at the Church in the nineteenth century, and hope in so doing to find more than an indication of the King in His beauty. There has during this period been a very wide extension in the numbers of the Church The population of countries called Christian, which means that their people are at least potentially Christian, is now two and a half times what it was tOO years ago It has increased from about a quarter to one-third of the population of the globe, till it is now upwards of five hundred millions of meals There is reason to believe that the number of those who really belong to the body of Christ has grown in something like equal proportion to this general increase It cannot, of course, be end definitely by any man what is the exact number The guns of the Holy Ghost are as hard to count in the Church as in the individual heart Yet there are we can be sure, how many millions of all peoples and nations and tribes and tongues who ever v may surround the throne of God and of the Lamb, crying, Salvation to our God, which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and over We may perhaps be questioned as to whether it is worth while finding such significance in the mere greatness of a multitude. But our own hearts reply to Us there is no sound on earth or in heaven to be heard more inspiring than, as it were, the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying " Hullo Rajah, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth ' And if this be uoteuough there is one greater than our hearts who answers which we ask who are those and whence came they "These are they who came out of the great tribulation, who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, ' there fore But we realise that I o are not as John looking at a vision of the future-this is a glory of the present we belong to- we ourselves are in the midst of the great multitude of the redeemed of Jesus If any inquiry into the extent of the Church is difficult, it is even more so with regard to the condition of her fellowship I' or in these day, 9, added to the natural obscurity of what ey a has never seen and ear has never heard, there it a peculiar dislike to the expression of that spiritual experience which if it could " be given utterance the imagination of one who was truly sympathetic might easily conceive The disposition of the present time is to conceal rather than to tell out the great things the Lord hath done, even though thereof we are most glad Still by means of hymns and the memoirs of pastors and teachers we can learn something suggestive of the relative feeling towards the Master- and the state of the communion between His disciples It would appear that perhaps because of the intellectual mood of the time, perhaps because we have been chilled by the camps of materialism, we are more cold and guarded in our personal relationship to our Redeemer than men once were two are afraid to commit ourselves Bren in prayer to Him in this station development of the Church there is now to be noted one further point of certain interest and importance During the present century there have neenamongstus those wonderfully successful and inspiring movements amongst young people at which when the most desponding amongst us look we are inclined to use the old familiar words, and say we do thank God and take courage The peculiarity of this awakening is not, as perhaps we are at first inclined to believe, altogether that it marks a completely new interest in the life and welfare of the children and young people A brief reference to the biographies of the saints of former years would show us that is not no Its significance is that it is widespread, inter-denominational, of lily catholic The movement began, where it is natural it should begin, at the lowest and simplest grade, with the Sunday school for the children then having developed Bible classes for those a little older, at rose about 20 years ago and permeated churches in nearly all lands as the Society of Christian Endeavour, and finally during the last few years of the century it has spread through colleges and universities almost the world over, as the World's Christian Students'' Union The great significance of this work, characteristic as it is of our time, may be sought and found in many of its features and many of its blessings But when all has been reckoned up it will be found chiefly to consist in this that here we have con- centric world-wide circles of those who are learning about Jesus And the idea is suggested to us that when the catholicity thus begun is completed it will be through various sections of the Church forgetting for a while then distinct functions of teaching, leading, and apostle ship, and finding themselves in the presence of Him before whom they are simply and forever disciples not learned but learning , not pastors, but members of the Hock not even fathers and brethren, but little children who are not left orphans We may do more than hope, we may expect the unity of the Church will he more fully realised by the return and the deepening of the spirit of discipleship There is one region of the life of the Church, that of doctrine, where to many minds it is very doubtful w bother any true advance has been un (In during the century It is recognised freely that the old order changeth, yielding place to new but it is by no means easy to be sure that, in the strange ways which open ground, God is fulfilling Himself And the whole subject is considered so iiiisatisfû.ctor\ that you hear it said not infrequently it is too unpractical too much in the clouds for us to concern our aches with it. It is, however, one must urge, in the region of the air storms are generated And it has been by no means uncommon for some fulminations against erroneous teaching to be discharged from the theological clouds during these years, sometimes with disastrous enough consequences The whole question, however, is its bearing' upon the life of the Church, is far too serious a one to be treated with neglect on the one side or levity on the other. It is really terrible in its import to us as was Sinai to the host encamped around, for the future vision of the Eternal depends on keeping its sanctity inviolate Everyone must admit that during those years the old form of doctrine has lost much of its power Occasionally there has been violent breaking away from allegiance to it. But for the most part the former creeds and formulas of dogma have been let slip as easily as when the attention being taken up by some object of interest the grip of the hands is unconsciously relaxed During this period of transition many men have followed many methods Some have tried to take the course Descartes laid down for himself during similar circumstances A wise man will live, be said, in the old house while the new one is building But, we might remark, when the two structures are upon the same ground even this plan may not be without confusion Others have tried as well as might be to live in the open air of the New Testament for awhile And it has not always happened that this out-of-door life necessarily makes a man a theological Ishniaehte with his hand against every man Others again have had the temerity, perhaps, to believe they need not only watch and wait for the new intellectual temple, but that they might work in some way towards its erection Amongst this number some have sketched with loving and trembling hand the plan of the heavenly building unconscious perhaps, that they were helping at all The Baptist seemed hardly to realise that he did I more for the Kingdom than to cry it is at hand ' A few others have realised that the found ation his to be extended before the real construction could be begun They knew full well On gen Gregory, Athanasuts Augustine were better and greater men but they had to build upon the basis of a disaster Greek philosophy And now then has been or is being, established thought that chaos is the minute, glory of the heavens the world of man's person along, the complex whole of humanity And this basin is being made broad enough to hold the centre of the no Urine of rather Son, and Holy Ghost And though thought li is not of attained 1 unto the conception of Christ Jesus and Him crucified it will in time do so For the business of thought is to follow and comprehend life and here in His death is the goal of its finished striking then some have tried with great and loving care to fashion the stones for this building not made with hands And it has been with them as it was with the workers at the temple at Jerusalem they hate cut and shaped the stones army in the obscurity of their ou u lives they wished to come bringing the part of the step or column complete in its beauty so that no song 1 of a hammer should be heard in the sacred place itself Of this number are the patient seekers after truth in the Old Testament and the new and those who, like the great man we heard of last year follow out the signs of Christ, through the centuries and into our own times During the present year the hope has been expressed that in this truly sublime work of building up doctrine we as Congregationalists should have a high place The suggestion has been offered, too, that in the great council now meeting at Boston a substantial bo "anning may be made Although meetings and conventions are not the places where one expects to find such special and high in j tellectual effort, it may be that the hope thus expressed will find some fulfilment Now having glanced at the faith of the Church shown in her widowed increasing he, and at her hope as yet but a dream not quite clearly discernible we shall look for a little while at what that love has been in this century there is certainly learn the faith that lays hold upon the joy of God from heaven to earth come down There is also love in the desire to set forth the person and work of the Lamb acceptably, but we must take the love of the Church for her Redeemer as shown most evidently and powerfully in her sacrifices for Him amongst men in spending and being tenant in His service Certainly it is a most inspired,' vision of late that we behold when we look out and I see the thousands who are engaged in circulating the Bible, teaching children, presents g the gospel and building up churches in far off lands Still it must not be forgotten that by no means represents all the menace of this period Perhaps the missionary looks back on the land he left years ago and sees in memory the teacher or minister doing that which is Christ s will and for His sake unto some homeless child or to someone who is a sinner in the sight of men And it may be he is cheered and uplifted in his work by the recollection even as we are by the thought of him And now there is before us this view of the whole great subject of Christ in the century It is partial, incomplete of necessity let it has brought to our hearts a vision not soon to be lost The hymn "Who is on the Lord's Side" was snug, and the Benediction was pronounced by the chairman u The union will meet again this morning at 10 30 o'clock, when a paper will be read by the Rev.
