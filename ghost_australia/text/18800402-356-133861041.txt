The A. J. C. Autumn Meeting. [(nolr Oer SIDNEY COBRESPONDENT.] CUP DAY-- WEDNESDAY. THE second day's racing of this meet ing took place on -Wednesday. The weather was all that could be desired, with almost a cloudless sky. His Excellency the Governor in company with Lady Loftiis, two daiighters, and suite arrived on the course shortly after the first race aid were conducted on to the stand by the Hon. J. White, Mr. O'Connor, M.I.A., and Mr. Roberts (late Mayor), the hand playing the National Anthem. .The attendance on the course was rather meagre at first; but at the time of the cup com ing off, 3.15 p.m. the number increased to fully eight thousand. There was a larger attendance of ladies than on the first day; but not nearly so many as I have seen on former occasions. ' The promenade after luncheon was how ever, well patronised. The St. Leger stand was nearly full, but the Derby stand was a sorry sight. The racing, as a whole, was particularly good, and the finish of the Flying Handicap where five horses came in neck: and neck was a sight worth going to see. Mr. Dangar must have had a watchful eye to discriminate the first, second, and third, His decision, however, gave no cause for a grumble. The Autumn Maiden was cleverly won by Faublas, beating the favourite ¥Waterloo, easily on the post. The Cup caused intense excitement and brought out a heavy field. The winner, Petrea, won as she liked, and only showed her mal-treat ment in Melbourne. In the words of tlhe crowd, "she is a wonder." The Breeder's Plate brought out but four, Grand Prix was made a: great pet of; but Yeoman's on- Geraldine came up to him in the straight, and without nsing the whip gave him an easy go bye much to. the delight,,of,those who had good hats to throw Uip in the air. The Selling Plate brought fifteen to the post, and at the start two were left behind, The winner (Queensland) was sold to Mr. E. Weekes, Melbourne, for 150 guineas. The Sapling Stakes wound up the day's sports, and the starting of this was so horrible, as wvell as others, -that the sooner a clhange is made the better it would be for the club. Kamalaroi, the favour ite, was left ten lengths to the rear, and, therefore, had not the ghost of a chance in a .five furlongs race. Now to racing matters.

Betting: 0 to 1 on the field. 'The start was only a middling one, Master Avenal taking the lead, which he kept to the half mile post, when he suc cumbed to Clarenza; at the turn Prarie Bird led, with Blackthorn next, then Blantyre, Queensland, and Olarenza; a desperate struggle ensued up the straight between the first five, and it was considered by those on the stand to be a dead heat, but the judge gave his decision, which was not in any way questioned to Clarenza ;.but half a head could not have separated first from second,' third from fourth and fifth. Blantyre finished fourth, and Prarie Bird fifth. Time, 1min. 18 4-10seecs. *The AUTUMN ?MAIDEN STAKES, a sweep stakes of 5 sovs., with 100 sovs. added. Second horse 20 sovs. from the prize.
