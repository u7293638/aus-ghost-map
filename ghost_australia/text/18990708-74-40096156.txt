A VERY TALL STORY., As you are always glad to hear about haunted houses in Ireland (writes a M.A.P. correspondent), may I add a curious story with regard to the home of the late Irish leader? The story is made the more credible by the fact that there was something in the late Charles Stewart. Parnell's majestic isolation which' reminded one strangely of the gloomy grandeur of the mountains sur rounding his home. In the square en trance-hall there is a billiard table, and the story is that the ghosts of the old house amuse themselves in this spot after nightfall. No matter how the billiard balls are left upon the cloth.. at the time the household retires, they will be found in a different position the " next morning. If all the .touacco smoked in the British Empire last year were rolled into a rope lin. in diameter it would' form a snakelike roll which, following . the line of the equator, would go 30 times round the Garth. Czar Nicholas II. is said to have and aversion to the needless slaughter of animals of any kind. He has recently forsworn the pleasure of the. chase and the shooting of game, and the birds and beasts in the Imperial pre serves live in undisturbed quiet.
