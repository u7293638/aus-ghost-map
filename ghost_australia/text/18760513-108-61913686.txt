PORTFOLIO. Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament, adversity the blessing of the New, which carrieth the greater benedic tion, and the clearer revelation of God's favour. Yet even in the Old Testament, if you listen to David's harp, you shall hear as many hearselike airs as carols; and the pencil of the Holy Ghost hath laboured more in describing the afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon. Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes: and adversity is not without comforts and hopes. We see in needle works and embroideries it is more pleasing to have a lively work upon a sad and solemn ground than to have a dark and melancholy work upon a lightsome ground : judge therefore, of th'e pleasure of the heart by the pleasure of the eye. Certainly virtues are like precious odours, most fragrant where they are incensed, 'or: crushed-for prosperity doth best discover vice, but adversity doth best discover vir? tue.-Lord Bacon. There is no vice that doth so cover a' man' Vith' shame as to be found false and perfidious': and therefore Montaigne saith prettily, when he inquired the reason why the word of the lie should be such a dis grace and such an odious charge, "If it be well weighed, to say that a man lieth is' as much as to say that he is brave towards God and a coward towardsmien; for a lief faces God and shrinks frni' man." Ssurely the wickedness of falsehbod and breach of faith cannot possibly be bo highly expres-i sed as in that it shall be6the. last peal to' call the judgments of God upo?ithe'genera-i 'tiods'of men: it being foretold that wlhen " Christ cometh" hle sh'all'not " find faith upon earth:"b-Tid.
