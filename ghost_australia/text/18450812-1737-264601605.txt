THE ESTIMATES AS TIIEY A TIE. We shall lay before our readers a short precis of the Estimates as they arc, with the increase and reduction as compared with last year. In tho salaries of the Governor, the Bishop and Judge, there is a real decrease of £400, which has been given up by his Excellency. This does not appear as compared with last year's estimates, because there the salary is stated at £3,500 instead of£4,000, which it became by the vote of £500 additional. The civil establishment of his Excellency shows an apparent increase of £380 6s 9<1, but there is in reality a saving of £31 18s 9J, by retaining one constable instead of two. The remainder of the increase is caused by transfeiring the charge for orderlies, clothing, forage, horses, &c.;, to this from that of the Mounted Police. In the Executive and Legislative Councils there is a saving of £54 15s on last year, by dispensing with the messengers.— It stands £554 15s. The Cleik of the Council, however, si ill gets the enormous salary of £500. in the Colonial Secretary's office lltpre is a saving of £472 17a 6d. This is caused chiefly by dismissal of clerks, one at £225, one at £16.3, and two constables at £63 17s Gil. The useless Assist int Colonial Secreiary is still retained, and the Colonial Secrelaty still receives £1200 per annum, h now stands £2,49.5. The Van Diemcn's Land Society for the Promotion of Science is docked £200, the estimates being for that sum instead of £400 last year. This we look upon with little favour. . It originated in political swindling, and has never done any good, that wc can learn. We now come to that monstrous imposition, the Colonial Treasurer's depaitment, with, be it remembered,an insolvent government, and not a shilling iu the treasury.— This, mottstrous as it is, costs £1010, being a saving of £12 by reducing the messenger's salary to £40. The Treasurer for doing nothing, receives £800, and two clerks for assisting him, £390. In the In ternal Revenue department, where is the only semblance of business, two additional clerks receive £280. , In the Colonial Auditor's department,: there is a saving of £122, by the dismissal: ofacletkat £110, and reducing the mes-; senger£l2. It now stands £1480. . J The Customscost in Hobart Town £3,234 lis. In Launceston £1,989 9a 9<1\. Total,' £5,224 0s9d, being en increase of £123' 12s. Accountant of Stores, £520, being an ini; crease of £80 for a storekeeper. ,' The Post Oflice department costs £7,026!- 4s 9J, being an increase of £254 12s 9d,j which has principally atisen from the em-! pioyment of four guards for the mails. | The Pott Office department is decreased' from £5,079 to £3,690 16s 3d. The com- 1 pletionof the light-house has been aconsidcrable cause of this saving. The rest is caused by the reduction of petty salaries. The Government Printing Officce costs £1022 10s. The superintendent's salary hos been reduced from £200 to £150—office ront from £150 to £75—a messenger, from £52 to to £40. total £137. Wages increased itoiu £296 to £357, leaving the net saving £77 10s. Total Civil Establishment— £24,784 9s 9d in 1846, against 27,892 17s in 1845 £3,108 7s 3d saving. To effect this, besides petty reductions, the markets* £363 17s CJ—Registrar of Births £450— signul stations £243, and In spcctors of Stock £639 have been totally abolished all useful offices^ amounting lo £1635 17s 6d, or rather more than half the saving. The estimates for police last year were £30,817 13s 7d—for this year £21,859 17s 7Jd. being an apparent decreaseo( £8,957 15s 11 id, but of this £44210s l(j have been oharged against his Excellency's civil establishment. The following reductions have been made —The Ascistant Police Magistrate at Mot ven, £454 15s. Half the salary of the ma gistrate at George Town £304 15s. Assistant Police Magistrate at Brighton and clerk, £454 15s. The same at Hamiltou, and a district constable, £479 15s. The Assistant Police Magistrate at Poit Sorell, declared by the Governor to be absolutely neccssary, £304 15s. Tolal £1998 15s.— A saving purchased at the great inconvenience of the public, which militates against their safety, now when it is more imperative to consult it. £1270 12s 6d more have been saved by reducing the constables' pay from ls 9d to Is 6d per diem. The Mounted Police, amountingto £1837 9a 7d, has been done away with except the small poition attached to his Excellency's establishment under the title of orderlies, while one half the pay and expenccs of two natives for tracking bushrangers, and the whole of their horses' keep is added, amounting to £130 0s 7J<1, and two peisons arc employed to prevent illicit dislilla tion, £91 5s. For the public -works the estimates are £800 against £1443 3s 9d, last year, but there is no provision made for the Director General, which it was fondlyhoped would be quartered upon the roads. The offices of Colonial Architect Bnd Town Surveyor are not placed on the estimates, £1045 16s 3d. The Judicial Establishment is £4,50112s being an inciease of £451 17s 6d, caused piincipally by an excess of witnesses' ex pences on criminal trials over some petty reductions—they last year amounted tc £1250—this year to the enormous sum of £2000. The law officers of the Crown draw £2,560, being a saving on last year of £164 caused by reducing the messengers from £52 to £40 each, and saving office tent. The Courts of Requests and Quarter Seseions £2,830, being a saving of £605. This has been made by dismissing two summon ing officers, one of them the oldest government officer in the colony, two bailiffs, and decreasing travelling cxpences £75. The Sheriff's department at Hobart Town is £1633 4s, a decrease of £462 13s 6d, and that in Launceston £639 9s, a decrease of £184 8s 6d on last year—total saving, £647 Is. The Registrar of Deeds is the same as before, £280. The gaols are estimated at £2,521 7s6d, a saving of £354 2s 6d. Inquests, £450, a decrease of £93 13s Rations to persons confined in gaols, estimated at £2,600, an increase of £100. Tolal Judicial department, £18,015 12s Cd, estimated saving £1,312 13s. In the Ecclcsiastical the estimates for the Chutcli of England are £6,780, a decrease on last year of £1814 10s—that for the Church o? Scotland £2.850, beiag a decrease of £198— Church of Rome £1300, a decrease of £49. The Wesleyan and Baptist Missions remain as they,were,ithe one £500, .the other 1 ; £150. ' Total Ecclesiastical £11,580, a decrease on last year ol £2,062. The sum estimated for day-schools is £3.000,£1,000 less than last year;-and that for infant schools tha same aB before, £150. In the Military department the Commandant of Launceston is no longer charged to the colony, and-this, with a diminution of forage mor.ey and travelling cxpences to the aide-de-camp, making a saving'o'n this estimate of £261 12s, leaving it at present £203 17s 6d. The pensions amount to £1206 10s, a decrease of £38 10, being the difference between Beilby's pension of £75 terminated, and two pensions granted, one to a constable's widow, who waB drowned while in ihe eKcutioncf his ditty (convict duty), and the other to a disabled mail guard. Pauperism is estimated it a cost of £4,448, an increasfe on last year of £308. The miscellaneousdepartment is estimated at £8, 490, an increase on that of last year of £2,196. ' v * ' Thus the estimated expenditure ol Van Diemen's Land fori846 is £101,638 ,5s 4|d, estimated. The estimated revcuuc is £1-06,332 15s. ' , This would shew a tolerably satisfactory balance, did we not remember that the esti- mates were miscalculated £30,000 last year namely £20,633 18s Id, to be spent raor than was calculated on, and £9,408 lis 6j not spent which was expected, leaving a ba_ iance of £11,225 6s 7d, and we have nD reason lo hope that the estimates have been more accurately calculated this year, or that the surplus revenue will not all go to meet those unforeseen expenccs. At all events, it it to be appropriated, not to colonial purposes, but to pay a debt contracted to diminish the expenditure on British felons. The probabte amount of revenue for 1846 is as follows— OUCINAUY. Customs .. .. £70,000 . Post Office .. .. 5,500 Receipts from Commissariat for postage of military and convict letters .. fl ,500 Post Office extra $1,500 Licences .. 9,876 Increased duty on licences 14,004 Quit Rents ., 2,500 Rents of government propsrty .. 200 Fees of public offices .. 8,402 Ferries .. 1,657 15 Total Ordinary £105,135 15 EXTRAORDINARY. Five per cent on the excess of all salaries above £200 8,970 We Printing, &c; , done at the Government Printing Office for the Convict Department %300 Total £106,332 15 think this probability exists only in the imagination of the Colonial Secretary. The hope of an increase of revenue by the incoms of postage will we are sure not realized. The increased revenue from increased licences is in the same predicament, and there goes the surplus revenue at once. As to the very extraordinarily liberal contribution of the officials, amounting to £897, out of some £36,000 paid to them in salaries over £200 a year, we think the less they be parade such munificence the belter. They may depend on it that if something, not only more, but very considerably more, is not freely surrendeied, the r.ext year must see them with the estimates as they ought to be, and which we phall give in our next. The cliBrges on the land fued are in nil £5,975 17s 2d. being an increase of £500 on lost year. This is caused by the interest on the losn of £25,0&0 from tbe Commercial Hank at 7 per cent £1750 which is paid from ilie fund. The other items shew a considerable reduction, Inthe Survey department the Surveyor-General still receives ihe disproportionate sblary of £800 for services rather deficient to ascertain. The De> puty Surveyor General has been omitted. This department costs £2,500 a derrease on last year of £492. The Aborigines cost £1435 17s 2d save (we do not exactly understand the expression £600 or not £835 17s 2d. for keeping 18 men, 26 women and 11 children, decrease £662 7s IOd. Ca'vtat Board costs £190 save £62. The estimate amount of land fund is, Proceeds of sale of Crown lands £8,000 Timber and grazing licences £5,500 Tolal £13,600 * Tlic markets were to have been given up to the city fund. But now ibat the road bill has been rejected, common consistency will on the part of tho men.her throiv out the Lighting and Paring Bill which is ideu:.ical in principle, or what would bo the better course, his Excellency may withdraw it esa late but gratifying tribute lo the wishes of tbe people. t We have understood that this is but one-half the amount which should be paid if the convict department were charged the same as the colonists. Will some of the members enquire if this is true. J Do these two items mean that the increase on the postage and on the licences will produce the specified sums. Calculating the cost of the government printing office, of ink and paper is the proportionate space occupied for convict purposes paid for. IN Council, Mr. Gregson, speaking of probationers, end the eller'.t their cjunsi punishment would have in deterring oihrrs from crime, recapitulated among their advantages thai lliey were fed upon " stall-fed beef." Little did he ihink lhai such is no small part of their punishment. He thought, good easy nan, that he was speaking of the. settlers, or the free, who are but loo glad lo oblai beef, and wiih whom its price renders its a luxury not always nltairinble. We have been put in possession of information which vill place ,lhe mailer in a totally .different light, nnd that we nay escape the sneers dircctcd agointt "an un informed press," we shall <|Hote verbatim from a letter written by the Superintendent of the Anson female penitentiary:— jinson, August 5,1845. • Mr. Gilbert, our butcher, has sup. plied us with nothing' for the last three weeks but Beef.
