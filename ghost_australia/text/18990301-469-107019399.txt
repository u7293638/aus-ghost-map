Original Poetry. A Dream of Spain. O maudoliu ! 0 mandolin ! O silver-soft guitar ! The airs of love are floating in, The voices dreamy are. O sweet guitar ! 0 mandolin ! Tho airs of love are floating iu The voices dreamy uvc "Tho cavaliers are riding slow, Tho dons are ling'ring hy ; Tho orango-blossoms softly blow, With Mimmer scented sigh. O sweet guitar ! O mandoliu ! ' --The airs of lovo aro floating iu With summer scouted sigh. Tho purple glow upon the hills Is fading into niglit, And 'twist tho tender-toned trills Wo dream of faded might. O sweet guitar ! O maudolin ! The airs of lovo aro floating iu With dreams of faded might'. Tlio ghosts of fame sit wearily O palaces of pride, The shadows of night fall drearily And nought there is beside. O sweet guitar ' O mandolin ! The airs of love are floating in, And nought there is beside I W. 51; Flemish. lCelviuside, Abordeeu. â€”Atixtra/ashtii.
