A REVISITED FISHING GROUND. Ey A. 0. Like some contemporary lovers of the art which our forefathers dignified as " gentle," I had begun to forget what it felt like to have a " count school - bah " at the other end of a six cold life-belt, I mean, to the fisherman Likewise, in common with them too, I had forgotten what fried schnapper collops cut from a fish you had yourself caught very early that same morning, and properly presented for breakfast, might be like Antipathetically I was, just as they were, only too familiar with all varieties of canned fish, and of indigenous fish which had probably visited the freeing cells as often as some habitual drunkards have visited the other cells, and with no better results Again, like them, I had begun to forget (I refer to my contemporaries, not the Usl mentioned gentry) whether there was any Domestic Service Regulation on the subject of offing having, and particularly at what age pater- families might be considered as too old for such a diversion I knew that I was a paulo-post-middle-ace fellow for that is a fact which I am not allowed to forget One's ss women folk take such affectionate care of one's memory in that regard It can be understood therefore that when I can mind the resolution that it was expedient that I should pay a short visit the schnapper grounds up north by lerrigalfaud Tuggerah Bight, and 1 or s andy, take a. look at Tuggerah Luke-and do these things in a boat 18ft long, built I should add, for the express purpose the mover of the resolution was his own Roller The entire household voted ' No " The result of course was that the debate was adjourned until I had time to " consider my position " During that process in conference with the leader of the Opposition the reasons of the majority were told me First, the danger of capsizing miles off shore , then the danger of being run into and smashed to pieces by a big screw collier, keeping of course through every watch that sharp lookout toys and for which such vessels are celebrated their there was the casual while, Toft overall, ss which would suddenly rise under the boat and cause calamity , thou the more casual swordfish, which loves to run his prong into the garboard strake and if the little cockleshell should succumb to ne no of these perils of the sea, there was the reef or numbers, which you might so easily come to grief on in a sea fog and, on terra firms, there were snakes and rheumatism, and sunstroke and ticks and I don't know what else, to be reckoned, with Of course, any intelligent bush casuist could have given as in any convincing reasons to a hungry friend why he should not cut his breakfast but a man who, in spite of marriage has managed to double Cape Climacteric is supposed, by his own people at all events, to have forfeited all pretensions to indulge in his unmarried diversions Even steeple chasing is said to him, likewise the barn dance, the bicycle, football, long and high jumping and if he is particularly fond of aquatics they bid him do them in a Manly steamer on a 40 ton yacht, or to say good-bye at once to salt- water cruises and take up with golf and lemonade parties, or convey an assort- ment of his womankind to a Hobart boarding-house or some mountain resort but when one so circumstanced manages to defeat or " dish " or ignore his " Opposition, and hoist- ing the blue peter in his face, to steal away for a week of genuine salt water, has chisels he suddenly becomes of his birthday, and its distance in the past measured by lustres And now wickedly grateful is the home of sea breeze and sea spray how thrilling the promise of a day among the sebooIUsh, if only he can pick up the marks of a wide ground last visited some ten years back and finally, how comforting the consciousness that he won't tire of schnapper steaks as quickly as a Scotch domestic would have read it in books-of lay salmon whichever way cooked, with whatever sauce dished Then there is no little consolation in the fact that, the cruise being a contraband kind of business, a sort of bonum prohibiting, the stolen pleasure, actual and expectant, in all the sis cover Is there a single native born reader of these lines who has not, calm boyhood, stolen watermelons? Did he ever taste a bought one which had the flavour of those others i In those larcenous years one stalked the market gardener for all he was worth creeping down a drain to his melon beds Then, his back turned, exit, Melon No 4, No 2, and so on And all the time he knew what was going; on, for he sent in his bill to our papers, who paid up like the heroes they were, remembering, points on two, things that happened in their own boyhood As for as we devoured the melons with all the more zest as being sanctified, in our opinions, by the odour of larceny, which, in point of fact, did not exist, at least so far as the owner was concerned Noss, thoroughly to appreciate the fascination of a cruise in an open boat of the dimensions already indicated, her owner ought to have been the former owner of a sea-going yacht He will then be able to compute himself as the master of the boat with himself as the slave of his yacht He does what he likes is with his boat in the first case in the other, the yacht does what it likes with him If, haply, it was his fortune to own a steamy acht, ah ' then his case as as bad indeed Do it far from this present writer to disparage yachting, whether under cans as or smoke, as the best way of oxygen ating jaded humanity yet dis- covered, and, further, as an innocuous mode of distributing among struggling artisans the money which might otherwise go into wild-cat ins vestments or as probate duty to a paternal Government What he desires to submit is that, just as the luxurious idea of an elephant with his indispensable mahout, sighs for a 13 or H hand cob, just as the miserable owner of several castles or country seats sighs for just a few quiet days in some hut or tent, so a yacht owner may plead for forgiveness if he botakes him calf now and then to a more cockleshell " to escape the not too soothing obligations of yacht ownership, and go where his inclination, and not that of his paid " yachtsmen," history And this is what he can do in a boat, and what very rarely he is able to do in a yacht Bengal is a small boat harbour, distant about 25 miles north from Port Jackson, and situate about half- way between the southern headland of Cape

Terrigal Highland, to the most densely wooded hills invite exploration and away south you catch the A and contour of coast broken by the he midlands of Cape Three Points the North Head of Broken Day, and the succession of points reaching to the North Head of Port Jackson The indefatigable Mr Cook knows nothing of Terrigal, although every northern train passes within 10 miles of it, and almost

about five years upon Terrigal was the site of busy shipbuilding works owned by Mr J Davis, and from his yard some of the st latest vessels which ply to and fro along our coast have been launched Tom Davis and his brothers were men whose names became household words, but their eingal shipwright brother has gone to the place where honest shipwrights go and his yard is now the, ghost of what it was, bearing considerable resemblance indeed to a deserted goldfield township, minus the shafts and the clay heaps Since Tom's death, and for the want of attention, the meeting, which he had put down and on which hundreds of vessels had hung out the heaviest of southerly gales, have utterly disappeared and terrigal as a harbour of refuge has retired to its natural condition except for the big pier, which still exists though badly in need of repairs All that mosT remains to testify of Terrigal in a shipyard are a row of ramshackle wooden houses, the spectral frame of the old ass and a few outhouses rapidly passing into irreparable decay, the wreck of a steam line nell high and dry on the beach, and an aBeoi ment of less scattered lion and there about the pool, to which a large flock of geese gives animation, but nothing else of value Assay half a mile to the west, prominent on a high wooded knoll, in the pleasantly situated house as Inch Mr Davis built some years before his death, ness the ross deuce of his family By a rather interesting bush road terrigal may be reached from Gosford by bugr V in an hour will a halt, and the track passes through some well brush land where cedar calico flourished, and gigantic stumps of blackbutt and blue and grey gum, turpentine and beach, still attest the destructive energies of former generations of timber-getters It was an attractive night twenty years ago to watch the long span of variegated bullocks yoked to the timber carriage as they sound slowly over the spur of length Hill before descending the steep incline leading to the call, there to deposit a keel piece of perhaps 70 feet long by a foot or so square In those days there was nearly always a 40 cr CO ton ketch or schooner on the blocks, and the hammering of the shipwrights driving home the spikes and bolts, and of the smiths at the forges, combined to make a striking industrial scene It is all a thing of the past now and Nature is fast obliterating all all visible tokens of old Terrigal shipyard The little harbour is formed by a ledge of rocks projecting in a northwesterly direction for about a couple of cable lengths, and the cornices cliffs sweep round to the south into a deeply curved strand, where a boat can be easily beached ninety-nine days out of a hundred Beyond is the west and along northward stretches right away to Point Upright

in the interests of a generation who can never know Terrigal! as it was, but will be amply compensated by seeing Terrigal as it For the rest, Terrigal is genuine ' blackfellow '' A century or so back the powerful Brisbane Water tribe made Terrigal their half-way camping ground on the route to J ugrarub, Budgewi, and Mawuurali, and there they called halt, for on the other side of the narrow neck dividing this last piece of water from Lake Macquarie, began the hunting and fish- ing grounds of the still more powerful Lake Macquarie tribe And between these two jealous tribes the only larceny that was permitted was the mutual abduction of wives, tubal intermarriages here, as everywhere, being considered as the worst possible form When " Willemonng " was hungry it was generally with his
