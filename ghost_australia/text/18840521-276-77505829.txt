CHRIST ON CALVARY. The subject of Munkaczy's new picture is "Christ on Cavalry." This solemn and touch ing picture, says the Paris correspondent of the London Times, which will be exhibited at Easter will certainly prodxce as great an impression in the artistic world as his " Christ before Pilate." The two pictures will be exhibited alongside of each other, and the public will be able to follow the sequence of the master's artistic thought. The figure of " Christ on Calvary " is slightly' larger than that of " Christ before Pilate." The painter depicts the scene where the Saviour has just expired. The sky is black with clouds and streaked with lightning, and beyond the horizon at Jerusalem the veil of the temple is seen, rent in twain. Christ, pale in death, and inclining forward, has given up the ghost. The centurion has'dropped in terror beside the cross. Mary, the mother, on her knees, is bathing in tears her sqn's feet. Mary Magdalene, her golden hair hanging loosely over her shoulders, her face in her hands, is also on her knees before the oross. John, overwhelmed with grief, is on the other side, and a Jewish woman looks on, a sad spectator of the crucifixion. The terrified crowd is descending the hill. Some Roman cavalry look on ashamed. One of the executioners, a { man of brutal mien, shouldering the ladder and i axe in hand, is carried along by a multitude. The three crosses are in the foreground at the right extremity, and the rest of the immense canvas is filled by the fleeing multitude. The sky is magnificent and sombre, and the lightning illuminates the dark clouds that hang over the mountain, the valleys, and the scarcely visible town. One seeB, amid the confused movements of the erowd, that it is bewildered and terror-stricken. The group at the foot of the cross is of wonderful beauty and feeling, and the general colour is harmonious and striking to a degree which even Muukawy himself has neyff befort fttUiqed.
