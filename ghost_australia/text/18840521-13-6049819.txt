There is a fly in everybody b ointment Last week it seemed as if the happiness of the typical radical of Victoria was complete for the discovery had been made that distress existed in Sydney, and that there were men who complained that they wanted work About the c) member of La Rochefoucauld of a secret enjoyment in the interior lanes of one's friends, nothing need be back, for the procession through the Sydney sheets were hailed with open and unaffected joy they were accepted as proving to a demonstration the oft repeated argument that free trade and immigration must lead a nation to beg gary and nun Allusions to the drought were scornfully ignored Our own rainfall and bounteous ha vest were forgotten, and contain disagreeable episodes of the past also People were invited one and all to bow the 1 nee to the policy which had kept povcityfiom the land And this is the opportune moment selected by the irrepressible unemployed of Victoria to put in an appearance without the smallest consideration for then once fronds the pleasant occupation has vanished of lead inghoniihcsinfavom of fiscal fetters It is not possible to go on with proofs that the Sydney tramp is a sober andbiipeiioi working man, the victim of vetches importers and cunning immigra- tion agents Instead of that, it has become incumbent to show that the Victorian unemployed are either conspirators against the cause, 01 are engrained loafers and have no connexion whatever with and no likeness unto the deserving beings across the border 'line, it must be confessed, is a some what difficult task To show that the Melbourne applicant is a good thing is simple enough, but then the evidence is so remarkably strong that the Sydney processionists his bom brother ' 'that tale of how certain of the unemployed drafted from Sydney disappeared in a few days, leaving no trace of work, nor of the goods supplied to them either, identifies them with the Footscray toilers, who pawned the hammers of the tate, as satisfactorily as any ' straw " berry mark upon the arm of the conventional drama And some of the arguments desperately resorted to are cruel to others besides the unemployed the character of the leader, Mr I AiiutnitsT, is held to be sufficient to discredit the men in Melbourne. Mr. 1 returns, we learn, is not always either " wise or moderate Moreover, " he is not a working man in the " ordinary acceptation of the town, and further, he has an ungovernable ' propensity for the stump the pro liability is, now over, that the landed at Sydney, whoever he maybe, is no better than Mr 1 unionism, but the uneasy suspicion that is aroused is whether in these sentences we have not home by hitting at radical chiefs who now decline to let Mr 1 situated approach them, and yet who were not always wise, not always moderates, were never working men in the ordinary accc_ ta tion of the team, and further had an unquestioned weakness for the stump So do disagreeable friends occasionally find it positively delightful to torture those who have risen with allusions that show that antecedents are not forgotten It must be held, to complete the picture, that Mr. W L Mum by from the trades hall steps, loftily repudiates all cognisance of the man 1 in ghosts, and yet it is probably ] in runs s his fortune, and not his fault, that unlike his reprieve, he filled to obtain a snug Government billet years ago The politician who can best afford to look on with a smile at the hubbub in the radical camp is Mr S*u\iu Now he finds himself accused of unduly encouraging the unemployed in 1860, and he remembers, no doubt, that the winning card played against him in the 1880 elections was that he had is owned upon the unemployed, and had spoken of 5s per week in a tent words having been put in his mouth to that effect to damage his chances For our part, we would not work for a moment the miserable men who are to be found in the streets both in Melbourne and in Sydney, and in London and New York and Paris Then pie scene is one of the problems of humanity The thriftless, the indolent, and nces said crushed everywhere, either out of existence of into a better mode of life, but the process is not particularly pleasing to the humane, more especially as more unfortunates ate apt to be drawn into the crowd Jinn ness is necessary to prevent loafers and paupers fastening themselves on the community, but the men need not be made the butt of parties In New South Wales, one can sent alle gallon is, that the unemployed are acting in the interests of the local poor tcctiombtB and and lmnngiationibts, but probably this is as wrong as the mythical wickedness attributed to con stitutionahsts in Victoria of fomenting such agitations in order to annoy the pi otectionibts of this colony These taunts may be omitted with singular advantage When we face the situation fairly it is easy enough to see that the stale need never be required here to do more than to take care that in its capacity of a large employer, it does not attract labour for the farmers in summer by pushing on too vigorous with public works and does not add to the winter dulness by a general discharge of hands. We made this suggestion during the distress of 1879 SO, and its wisdom has since been generally acknowledged but it is possible that the principle has not been sufficiently acted upon Contractors are naturally eager to proceed with public works in summer, for then the cost is reduced to a minimum, but the government has to remember that it is by quietly regulating the labor market that it best avoids a pressure for direct interference And, it may be added, that in a new country one sure way of steadying the market is to increase the population Without population resources cannot be developed, and the more they are developed, into more opportunities must be afforded for those who seek situations Every proved used in a sparsely populated country must need assistance, and at our present stage, they offer, every now produced 13 on this ground alone to be welcomed "We may be sure that there was often more difficulty in obtaining employment in her there were but 1,000 people 111 Victoria than there is now, when thcioaionciuly a million hero And it is certain that.
