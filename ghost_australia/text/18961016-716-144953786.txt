THE CUSTER MASSACRE. ' It was in January 1876 that Gens. Custo^ Terry, and Crook begun a. campaign against the Sioux in Montana. At Rosebud on the Yellowstone, Terry estab lished a camp and Coster kept on the search for redskins. Crook was detained in another direction, which left Custcr trilb. a small force of men. Old Sitting Bull was the mediciue man ot the Sioux and gave thorn advice as to what they should do. On June 25, Custer struck Bitting Bull's trail and followed it into th& little Biff Horn valley. Cnster exptcrins a battle detached Major Reno with seren companies to cross the Little Big Horn river, and attack the enemy from ths west. Custer dashed off to the right, Rtno whs on the left and Beateen m tbe centre. Custer- soon. disappeared in the valley and immediately after R«no and Bentceu were surrounded by Indians, and for 24- hours they fought desperately against over whelming odds. While Reno and his men were battling for their lives they hoard firing in the direction &aKen; oy busier. i^ oaiy rasseo & tew* miuutes and then ceased. Tb*n Terry arrived from the Yellowstone camp and Reno's com mand was saved. The Indians had all dis appeared before Terry arrived. A search was then taade for Coster. He was soon . found dead with his men. Majer Reno was tried by Court Martial for failing to support Caster, He was a ruined man, but tbere have always been doubts as to the justness of his punishment, for it is thought by many that Reno did well to save his command from massacre. And many people were not slow in blaming Gen. Custer for dashing into the trap be did, when by a little strategy he might have given battle to the reds and inflicted a stvsre punishment open them. But he waited for no one and some who knew him well say that tai desire to win all the glory for Custer, led him ti charge tbe enemy instead of waiting for Reno But, who can tell ? Custer died and not one of his brave baud was permitted to escape to. tell the history of that charge . Such is the brief history, of the Custer massacre. It is many years now sinca that desperate charge was made by General Custer, and during those years I met with men who had visited tbt Custer battle field. I also met & number or' Sioux wbo were in the battle, and from differ eut sources 1 picked up all the information T could in relation to the massacre. Some years ago I met Frank Yates, an Indian 'agent. Frank had a brother in the 7th Cavalry (Ouster's regiment) whD died by Ouster's fide. When J saw Yates he had charge of old Kaiit in-tue -Face, a chief who took the lead iu tbe Coster massacre. Rain-in-the-Face ws.« the Indian who. after the battle, cut out Tom Ous ter's heart, and bit a piece out of it. Tom Custer was a brother of Gen. Custer, bq.1 when Rain-in-the-Face cut his heart out lie was ful filling a vow. Some time before the Sioux went on the warpath, Tom Custer had struck llain in-the- Fice for some trivial matter. The old Indian looked htm in the face and ssid : ' ?* Tom -Caster, I will cut your heart oat for that some day.' Ke kept his vow. Gen, Ouster's body was not mutilated, and bis death was sudden tor he was shot in the head. Another story of the massacre wbtch was told to me by Yate,s who got ip From the Indians, was. that of a soldier wbo was with Custer when they charge .1 the, Indians.. When this soldter saw that they were in a trap, he. wheeled his horse and hashed aw*y, toward. tbfi open valley. Several Indians fol lowed him and he finally gave up all hope and drawing a pistol he shot himself in the head. bad a better horse than any of theirs and that they were just going to give up the chase when they saw the fleeing man shoot himself. ! But let us not call it a battle, for it was -simply a massacre. Lately there has been a number of stories published in regard to Custer, and among them is one rekited by a soldier wbo was left behind with Benteeo when Cutter -started off, to find Sitting Boll. This tolmer says that be was oce of the first? men io rea-& . the Custer battle field, and from the signs which he saw he ctme to the conclusion that Custer and his men were not given a chance to strikes one blow. ? The men lav in rows upon the ground and. they Jmmx :«vtdeotij fallen together. They rpde( into the very group of the Indians,' mho were concealed not fifteen feet away when l*ey poured a Volley into the little band which literally melted away like smoke betore a, breeze. ??.-?? - . ?? ., ] Ouster's cavalry, the Seventh, regiment* was / always the bitterest foe ofythe Sioux. The, Seventh had harassed the, Indians for yeara and the Indians were gfadiof a chance to wipe out a. third of the entire regiment. Years after wheit the ghost dancing^ began, and the Sioux wac broke out at Pine Ride feseacy, the Seventh was igain sent into the ield to face their old foes. and it was Shea the old Seventh came very near D«ng ?nmbila.ted.Toe regiineat was surrounded. ind actually teing overwhelmed by number* *beu the liteventb. arrived and saved the old cegim«nt.
