CORRESPONDENCE. TO the editor op the ' TELEGRAPH.' 'SNARLEYOW.' Sie, — I have heard very often of an Inspector of Nuisances in Brisbane, but havo eeldom had the pleasure of Booing him in Margaret street, where, to the great aunoyanco of the residents and passers-by, there are a lot of mongrel ours, which rush out at every passing horseman, vehicle, &o.;, and, in sevoral cases, have made the horses bolt, to tho danger of the ridorB. Even foot passengers are not safo, for last weok a child waa bitton syvorely in the leg. It is a groat .pity this could not bo put a stop to, or at loaBt have tho dogs registered at the police office, or thrown into tho river. Tho inspector we read ubout will oblige by visiting ub a little oftenor, before somo Bcrious accident happens. ? A RESIDENT. Singular Will. — Tho following iB an extraot from the will of John Farmer, who died in Ger anmtown, Philadelphia county, in tho year 1794 : ? — ' I do hereby order my exeoutors to put no new linen about my dead body, but put my worst shirt on it, and my worst handkerchief on tho head, and tho worst drawers and breoohos on my body, and tho worst stockings on my legs and feet,, and invito my neighbours to como to my spouse, who shall treat thom in moderation with a barrel of cider and two gallons of rum or , other spirituous drink, and a bushol of wheat * flour baked into cakes ; and when they aro ready to carry tho corpso, thou in the houao or yard, read tho foregoing and following part of this testament loudly, so that ull may hoar it. And also, bo road it nt the gravo boforo my body is buriod (if tho weather be fit for it) that though when I canuot spook with my mouth, I may speak by this writing to provoke tho hearers to love tho Almighty God, tho Fathor, and the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and tho Holy Ghost which proceodoth from the Fathor and tho Son, and is tho Comforter of all Ohris I tians.'
