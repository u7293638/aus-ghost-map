Now, :>vhat WMj tho-'complaint from which he suffered ? Not galloping consumption, certainly (as one of the doctors thdught),orhe would have galloped ?>' into his grave in less than three months, iusteau.of growing worse for seven years. His complaint was> chronic iaflamatory dyspepsia , (or chjoDio . gastrio catarrh), whioh has lung symptoriis like ; consumption, for which it la so often ignorantly 1 mistaken and wrongly treated. Wheu thd right remedy, Mother Seigel's Syiup, was used -the disease yielded, as all diseases of the digestive . troet do yield, to . that magnificent preparation. Wo heartily congratulate \ Mr. ..
