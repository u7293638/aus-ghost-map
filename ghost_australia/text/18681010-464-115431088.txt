'; nal for wan/t -pf legal Registration.^ Our '? 'r&ders;, as well as the general' public, , are . .pretty well '-aware of the history, of the. .,'? '''case, and the almost universal opinion has '.'-'. been that 'Mr. Mar-tin would never proceed i/s^yith the case and. take- it into a court of ;::'- justice.1 Our own opinion of the honorable .:,, the Premier did not allow us u- iaii m wiuu ! ; i : the charitable view entertained by pthers, ?-? Mt we. allowed our friends to remain;in v ihat happy disposition. Our estimate has '.;; proved correct for on Friday last we re ??'?.. -ceived information froni our Solicitor that ; the trial would take place on the 3rd No : yember in the Supreme Gourt before a jury , / pf four. Thus it will be seen that Mr. . ? . Martin is determined to proceed in this ? 'dirty business arid anything he can do,; .backed up with the authority of his official ' :: position and -with- the use of the public :': ';purse, to destroy the Freeman's Journal ''?-«.; we may rely upon his doing it. The most /bitter opponent we may have could not at ;;. ?tribute any moral guilt to us, the error, if -',;. any, being unintentional and of no legal . value if any one had been libelled in our ?columns. It has recently been decided by .rone of the English Judges that the want of ^registration when every issue of a jour ? .,, nal contained the names of the proprietors, did in no way relieve such persons of that responsibility which would arise from a legal registration. Such has been exactly . our-case, and it is hard to account for the 1 ;; action' of Mr. Martin unless we attribute ;;-^b him- ari; anxiety to silence a journal repre ?''rs.eniing'-;that,. large and influential class of :^..p\e^ple°who did ? for years believe i0|im' :Wd often served him when his political * ^racism was all but complete. The At ''tofneyrGenerarsJcnowledge of the lesources '' '.of 'newspapers is sufliciftntly accurate to in v:&uce;\hini to believe that the Proprietors' of ? the Freeman?s Journal could never meeV the heavy law. expenses and the penalties '; whicliih.e.is endeavouring to enforce. '?Biyi;. '. lie forgets that in attacking us he is ?attack- ?

' Law ??'busiriess is a very expensive thing, especi ! ally1 when opposed to the Crown,. arid :we .'.must therefore crave the indulgence of our . .subsoriljers, especially of those whose ac counts extend o\rer a considerable period j 'if wo ask them to remit their several, ^mounts at the earliest opportunity.

On the first instant Mr. Mr. John Ste wart, the member for the Iilawara district addressed his electors in a lengthy speech in perfect consistence with the written effusions of the same gentleman in the Herald on the education question. He first informed his startled constituents of the undubitable facf,,^hat froni the time the House open ed ' t-uiti| -:it ^ closed ten montfisiiad elapsed, ther^rej :|liat m%ht be considered* the duratibri Of the session. The history of these ten months was then reviewed atr leiagth' with, the usual truth fulness ..and acuteness of observation to which we' are accustomed, of course the sayings and' doings' of the Opposition were appreciated in .''..?'the way; every, body ex/ pected in such ;a place, at^such a time, and from such Hps^;^any|p|^f ^estiofsf added the horio^affe^^a^^^hjeh occu pied the time ^ pf.^'iioi^^w^ of ;a.very trumpery character. .

'nOur readers will doubtless, 'under thiti^ ^^flipparit language see the meaning of Mr. J. Stewart; they know what 'clerks and gaol officers' were', here alluded to : their ? dismissal did not: in truth cause a change of Ministry, but the questions; they raised together with^ many other, .tyrannical measures, wilLin'i ctlie end .prove fatal to 'more than one of its inembersr-^^i^r Ministry still 'accprding tb it worthy ''defender5 had one soiil; per haps two, but no hi ore.

Th e h onourable gentleman also entered ihto a lengthy defence of the Pub lic School Bill. He pointed out that the only opponent to this infidel measure, was, our .Venerable Archbislnp with whom, no: doubt, /he joined in his mind, as they in ?reality are, the Oathplic bishops and clergy of ' 'Nevt ,, ^^South .
