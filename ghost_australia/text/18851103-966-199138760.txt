The V.R.C. Spring Meeling. COP DAY. fBy Telegraph.] Melbourne, November 2, Morning. [FBOM TBUMFATOB.] The weather now looks like clearing up, but even if it keeps fine until to- morrow the ground must be very heavy. The owner of Liverpool sent bis horse another strong two miles' gallop this morning, and Trenton also went strong'.y. The Railway Stakes, with which the proceedings will be op<ned to morrow, should fall to Isonomy or Winchester. Maddelina is the pick of the lot engaged in the Kensington Stakes, and in her absence Halcyon or the Nun may win. Gasalier looks like winning the Hurdle Race, her mostdangerouB opponents being Brigand and Ravensworth. For the Cup the only horse scratched at the time of writing is Honeydew, but spme of the defeated Derby candidates are likely to go out daring the day, and I dare say not more than thirty-two or thirtythree will start. Last Monday I chose Trenton, Mordenfeldt, Liverpool, Sheet Anchor, Brown-and-Rose, Despot, and Kit Nubbles as a lot from which the winner was to spring, with Trenton. Nordenfeldt, and Brownand-Rose for choice ; and after seeing the two sons of Musket win their races on Saturday, I shall couple Nordenfeldt with Trenton to supply the Cup winner, while Brown-and Rose a sound condition sliGuld enable her to gain a situation. Of the extreme outsiders' division I prefer Grace Darling and Plausible. Melbourne, November 2, Afternoon. During the intervals of settling to day some betting was done on the Melbourne Cup at the following prices :— 100 to 20 agst. Nordenfeldt, 100 to 15 agst. Trenton, 100 to 13 agst. Despot, 100 to 10 agst. Liverpool, 100 to 6 agst. Brown-and- Rose, 100 to 5 each arst. Sheet Anchor and Kit Nubbles, 100 to 4 each agst. Cerise-and- Blue, Grace Darling, Stornaway, and Plausible, 100 to 3 each agst. Britisher, Tom Brown, Acolyte, and Arsenal, Melbourne, November 2,11.30 p.m. The Victorian Club was crowded to-nigbt, and some heavy betting took plaee on the Melbourne Cup. The sensation of the evening, was the backing of >Varwick for £20,000. This move was quite unexpected, as the stable had previously backed Brown-ani- Rose, and, moreover, Warwick has only done moderate work since his arrival here. Nordenfeldt and Trenton remain very firm at the head of the quotations, the colt being if anything a better favourite than Trenton, though 5 to 1 is now the best offer against the winner of the Melbourne Stakes. Grace Darling, Stornawav, Cerise-and-Blue, CoriolanuB, First Chester, Blink Bonny, and Lesbia have each been supported to-day for heavy stakes. prices :— 6 tol agst.
