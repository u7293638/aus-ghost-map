AN IRATE POET. Never, since the days of Pope and Dennis, has anything quito so savoago appeared in literature as Mr. Robert Brownings little ode, "To Edward Fitzerald," published in the last Atdlenh, r. 3. Aldis Wright, in his "Life and Letters" of the translator of Omar Khayyam, had most ineautiously adimtted a hasty sentence of the genial "Fitz," which ran:-"Mrs. Browning's death is rather a relief to me, I must say: no more Aurora Leighs, thank God! A woman of real genius. I know; but what is the upshot of it all! She and her seo had better mind the lkiteen and the children; and perhaps the poor. Except in such things as little novels, they only devote themselves to what men do much better, leaving that which men do worse or not at all." Mr. Browning, it seems, lighted on this unlucky passage-never of course, meant for the puboic eye-and hiazeut forth into the subjoined volcamnic verses: To E?ewnu FrznocnLo. I chanecd upon a nw book yrswly; I openedit, and, where my inger ey 'Twixt page and unceut pdGe, thioe words I read- ume si orseven at most-nd u e ?edl there Thot you, Fitzgerald, whom by tnor and eye She never knew, "thank Gol my wife was doead." Ay, dd and wee yourself alive, ooe Fits, ow to return you thanos would tas my wits. Kicking you seems the common lot of curs While more approprite reeting lends you grace, Surely to spit there gloriics your fa.ce Spitting from lips uncc sanctltced by hers. July , 1ene. Boneer Bnowieso. Tao,? eanlemis! Should a great poet thus, for a fretful phrase, avengo the deadupon the dead, by tolpling him who was the "'best friend" of Lord Tennyson and author, in the way of translation, of the "one thing dons divinely well," that his ghost is not good enough to spit at? Ir, Aldis Wright has cor-. tainly much to answer fur.
