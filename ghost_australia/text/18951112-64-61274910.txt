PHOTOSRAPHIC GHOSTS.-Don't be so matter-of-fact, writes a correspondent. You give us a delightful Halesowen photographic ghost story, and then you destroy the romance of it all by telling us that, after all, the whole thing is but " the result of unaccountable reflections produced upon photographing glass ?" Rubbish] One of our best known London photographers the other day showed me a photograph which had been taken a few weeks previously, which represented . an elderly gentleman, minus his legs, poor dear, seated in his own arm-chair, in his own house in his own country- Now, there is nothing extraordinary in this you will say. Wait a moment. The photographer went to the house during the absence of the family and took a photograph of the empty study. When the photograph wits developed, to his astonishment there sat the master of the house in tho arm chair as I have described, but minus his legs. Two days . after there came a letter to say that tho old gentleman had died that very hour in a far-off watering place of dropsy in the legs, I think it was. I well remember Mr. Stead telling me of some- one-it niiiy have been he himself-photo- graphing in un ancient church, and when the plate wus developed there distinctly was the Hguruof a mediicval monk hooded and cowled.
