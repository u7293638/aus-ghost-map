THE O'CONNELL REEF. To the Editor of the Nashville Times. Sir, â€” When I was in Brisbauo I onjoyocl tho profound roflootions of that groat correspondent, 'Aristidos,' Co., thut confused writer of 'mud volcana and uuutterablo gigability j' but undor noath iho forcu of hia languago thoro ia a oyuioal morality, tho othica of whioh tasto vbry Btrongly of broken- hearted sharobrokors giving a passiug kiok. Tho idea of ' Ariutidos' bolouging to tho classics ia onough to draw ' iron tours down Plato's choeka.' bir, 111 roleronco to lua romarka about mysolt 1 cannot reply to them, us thoy aro unworthy of my notico. Had ho reasoned the mattor as a gontloman should havo dune, then I would lmvo boon delighted to havo replied. I hope that tho public of Gympio know mo bettor than to boliovo in tho philosophy of ' Arjstidcs.' I havo much pleasure to inform this classical prospooting ghost, or litorary hack, un worthy of Grub-stroot, that, all Gympio unitod could not falsify tho character of tho O'Coiinoll Hoof, us tho nronpooting claim cau.stand inspection. If you lmvo not got n. waalo papor baskot in youi oditorial room I will bo most happy to proEontyou with ouo, and when your correspondent again honours tho publio with philo-proapootiug areas, ho will lotnombor that ' truth sbowod Btool hia pon and juutico his romarka.' Lotting an individual's buui noss alono who himself would bo private, and who wishes ' AriBtides' no harm. With tho sonti montsof tho moat profound respect, lam, ' Youra sincerely, ? . ' ? ' ? ?
