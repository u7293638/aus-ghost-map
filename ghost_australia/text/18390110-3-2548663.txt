To the Editor of the Sydney Gazette. SIR, A letter I have received from Port Phillip of the 28th ultimo, contains the annexed remarks relative to the blacks and the "protectors;" comment on them is, I think, unnecessary for if the writer by simply bleeding cured two, how much mortality might not have been saved had one of their legitimate guardians been among them? who, being well paid for his services and having his time wholly at his disposal for these our sable brethren, could have performed the same operation to hundreds more himself and thus, it may be, have gained their respect and esteem for the winter in a manner so lasting as never to be forgotten. Perhaps, it will be said, this was no part of the protector's duty; if this be so, quere, si vous plans, what his duties are? 8th January, 1839. F. G. H. I regret to say that the influenza is raging very much among the poor blacks, and several of them, through, want of medical attendances have (to use an old Scripture phrase) given up the ghost. This is at once a pity - and a shame; what, I wonder, are the pro- tectors to the blacks doing in Sydney? Would it not be much better if one of those well paid individuals would come here and endeavour, by procuring me- dical aid to these harmless and (in case sickness) helpless fellow mortals, en- deavour to cure and assist them? Then truly they would deserve our praise, and would not fail to receive the only reward which these poor mortals are able to give their heartfelt gratitude. I have bled two of them myself, and they have since recovered."
