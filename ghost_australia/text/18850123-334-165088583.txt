PASSING EVENTS. - I Perhaps in no part of the world is there to be found - a body possessing Luch a grim, sense of the ridiculous as the Benalla Rifle Club. A few days ago they invited the Seymour Club to a friendly match ; but they afterwards seemed to regret the challenge, aud eni/ertainea tneir -guests in a manner that ought to be sufficient to have the term 'hospitality' removed for ever from the local lexicon. Of course there is no law against such treatment, but there is an unwritten law' which forbids an individual member of society being rude to a guest, and the same law should guide any number, of individuals under similar circum stances. The Benalla Club appear to look upon such customs as mere, relics of middle-age barbarisms, and no doubt they have a perfect right to their own opinions. But the moment an out sider attempts to question the logic of. their reasoning, their recognised organ spits like a wild cat, aud calls all the gods to witness that the Benalla Rifle Club is overflowing with the milk of . human kindness. ' Omne ignotum pro magnifico.' Another phenomenon from : Koby boyn. 'J.R.' reports, an extraordi nary circumstance. A few days ago, seeing a black Spanish rooster tearing up some onion seed% he got an axe and decapitated the hapless fowl. No sooner was the head severed, i.onever, than it jumped on a four-rail fence and crew seventeen times. It then dropped off, gave a convulsive gasp, closed its eyes and resigned the ghost. The Broadford Shire Council can not be charged with hoarding up the goods of this wcrld. They now owe close upon LI, 300 j and as the revenue far next twelve months will reach only I a little over LI, 000, in the words of the immortal Micawber, ' the god of day goes down upon the dreary sccne/' and if tbey are not floored for ever, they migbt at all events indulge in a Rip Van Winkle slumber until I the' discordant, yells of a drunken larri kin announces the birth of '8G. LONE HAND.
