Too ;Hgh a Price. The following story is told of Bensley, the actor: The spirits who alarm Richard III. in his tent were wont to appear up a trap en buste. Bensley, having been playing Henry VI., was waiting impatiently to display his upper half as his own ghost, and having been invited to sup ; with some convivial friends after the performance, divested himself of half his costume to save time. Presently he appeared under the stage, his upper man solemnly arrayed in black velvet and bugles, the lower in a. tight pair of smart new nan keen pantaloons. He placed himself upon the platform, cautioning the carpenter at the winch not to raise him too high, and, the cue being given, up he went. Close by stood a mischievous' low comedian, who had been laughing at Bensley's odd appearance; and, the spirit of fun being too strong for him, he suddenly gave the winch a few rapid turns, ran King Henry up to the level of the stage, and jerked him forward full into the sight of the audience. The roar of laughter which rose was tremendous. Even the conscience smitten, terrified tyrant in the tent, at the sight of the old Lancastrian monarch in a costume belonging to two such different periods sat up and roared with the rest.
