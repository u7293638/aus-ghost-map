THE GHOSTS OP HAMPTON COURT. The Psychical Society, if it be in need f any ghosts to lay, should turn its ttention to Hampton Court Palace. A esident in the Palace informs the Daily Graphic that even to-day—at this latter end of an unbelieving century—the doors of Hampton Court still open and shut to the touch of ghostly fingers, and some of the rooms still resound to ghostly revelry in ,the small hours of the morning. Jane Seymour, it appears, is one of the most restless of these vagrant spirits. Her voice is so often heard that it has become quite well known to the living listeners, while her habit of pulling away pillows from under the heads of sleepers must go far to ensure her a hearing even among the least wakeful. Another of King Henry VIII.'s wives, Anne Boleyn, confines herself, apparently, to what is known in theatrical parlance as " walking." She, poor lady, however unable to rest in her grave, would hardly be more comfortable for a pillow. Nevertheless, even her silent protest against the ancient injustice of her Royal husbahd has been sufficient to deprive one of the residents to-day of the services of a cook. The good woman was not Unwilling to oblige—indeed, in her last situationshe had carried her complaisance so far as to act as nurse to a mistress " who was inflicted with haricot veins " —but she protested there was a limit to fell things, andnot all the good-will in the world could induce her to stay in a place where "Anne Bullion walked, and ghosts were so harbacious." In fact, the same old story that has been told of scores of old houses is told again to-day of Hampton Court. Figures are distinctly seen to glide through walls, locked doors are opened, strange noises are heard, and sleepers are awakened by nightly visitants.
