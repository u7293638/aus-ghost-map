MR. WISE AT ASHFIELD. THE GOVERNMENT POLICY. PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM. At the Ashfield Hall last night a very large gathering of electors was addressed by Mr. B R Wise, the Attorney-General of the new Government, on the Ministerial policy and his personal claims to re- election as member for the constituency Mr B R Wise referred to the necessity which had arisen for him to appear as it candidate before the electors He then alluded to the actions of the late Government and explained the reason which conduced to its defeat He said that Mr field's confused and ill-considered measure of land taxation bad discredited the whole system of d reen taxation not only in t! i colony, but throughout Australia No measure of land value taxation could be successful if it contained exceptions, or if it was associated with a measure so inconsistent with the principle of land value taxation as an income tax He was sent into Parliament last year to do live thems, viz., to press forward federation and to send out Mr Reid He had pi causes! the electors to do business in both directions, and he had kept his word with a degree of success that was best indicated by the bitterness with which he was now e opened It had been said that he ought not to have taken office under Mr Lyne Air Held had charged him i with baillie in the past strong!) at tucked tim gentleman It was true he had opposed Mr L) no previously because Mr Lyne was a pro. sections and he was a record her It was also true that he had opposed Mr Lyne a short time ago when Mr Reid and Mr Lyne were working together to defeat the Commonwealth Bill But Mr Reid was wrong in saying that when he opposed Mr Lyne 01 that occasion he had attacked Mr Lyne He had ally as s preferred the open and housetop position of Mr. Lyne to the Commonwealth Bill a the shifty and unprincipled assassination methods of I Mr Hold He could not endorse and the argument that because he was a freetrader he ought not to have joined Mr Lyne Every sensible man must admit that after the vote of June 20 the fiscal issue is a dividing line between settles in New South Wales should be as cloud to Julius dear Mr Lyne had shown the state than Hine m recognising that it would be disastrous for our commercial interests if any attempt was made at the present time to impose new duties Mr tt he mentioned the reasons why be joined the Ministry THE PUBLIC sriUIJl Mr Wise said the policy of the Government was not one of boasting, bag, or cent, but one of quiet practical administration in the Government did not propose to alter the present system of c imperative examination as to the means of putting It of Civil Service, but he had grave doubts as to the wisdom of requiring examinations To behold of those who had already entered it prior to promotion The Under Secretaries in tharwa or departments non responsible for their return Stratton they were men of great ability, and it w I wrong, he thought, in a principle, that the odious 1 bl subordinate to the Public Service U aid No one propose that the Under- Secretary s eli mel le exempt from the board's jurisdiction, in! that in ap pollute tribunal should be estOili-'icel to which an appeal could be from any decision of the Public Service closed He hoped by these alterations in He law to secure that no Civil servant should be de proved of any bone it without knowing, what the ue custom was against him, and having an opportunity to meet it that would be secured if the Public Service Board was required to report on iinyuflicer whose ositiomtpro granted to alter for the worse to the under secretary of that officers department The report would be come a record, and the UtidofScorcUiy would have an opportunity of expressing his opinion upon it before it went to the appellate tribe al It would secure that both sides of the question should be heard He would also propose in the new bill with regard to those officers who had led into the super annuation fund and had e used to contribute to it upon representations made to them by a previous Government, a means whereby this representations should be carried out At present the letter of the law CAused Boree injustice in this respect but he would advise the Cabinet either to Hillend the law or to put a sum on the Lsti matcH to deal! with special cases of hardship Au) promise made by a Government should be carried out, and if the law did not enter) get the luton am of Bio Munster or 1 allument 1 should be union ted As 11 the appoint ment of a member of the Public --Service to the Public Service Board, he saw some difficulty" in giving practical effect to the idea, but 1% would certainly not at point any new member with out consulting the Civil Service Association, and he hoped to be able to devise a scheme under which the members of the Civil Service could elect a represent I live to the board Mr Wise soil the y-ullcmcii composing the Public Service Board were not to bureau for the grievances under which the nhill Service suffered life Act was faulty, and no three men could possibly administer it Baptist second) HIL CITY RAILWAY He had pleasure in stating that the Government had determined that tax extension of the railways as to the city should be taken into consideration at tin c ghost opportunity The Hyde Park scheme should no longer be allowed d to 1 lock the way That scheme would either have to be approved or rejected, in fairness to the Railway Commissioners If the II) de Park scheme was once disposed of, even in the negative, the Commissioners could recommend a practicable plan, which would u doubt his name churches adopted LOCAL OPTION He had promised his friend, the Rev. V B Boyce when standing for election last year, that if he was honoured by an offer of a seat in a Ministry hon ours not accept it unless local option was left an open question, Mr Lyne had agreed to a proposal by him to that effect EARLY CLOSING BILL An early-closing bill, would be introduced without delay It would differ from the proposal of the Reid Government in being a genuine measure To have enforced the Reid hill would have meant taming all employees into informers The Lyne Government bill would fix a definite time for closing, and if the bill was not obeyed, it would provide for penalties in such could be easily enforced by means of inspectors COMPULSORY ARBITRATION Mr Wise dealt at some length with a measure which he said would be introduced to deal with industrial disputes He referred to the New Zealand methods of arbitration, which required a deposit on either side of / 100, and the a party which did not obey an award boil to f area it its disposal But Mr Wise said he preferred the English proposal to make the interpretation of an agreement between a trade union and an employers' association a compulsory common rule of the trade in the district affected Such a rule could be enforced just us a regulation under the 1 factories Act was enforced, thereby refusing it a allow the trade to be carried on except under conditions agreed upon At the same time, just as there were some parts of honour which no union would submit to arbitration, he admitted there were disputes between employers and their workmen which could never be subjected to deter- mined! n by any tribunal, and could only be settled by a coull ct. It was, however, the duty of the State, so far Government thought, to find some means of lowering the occasion and the importance of such calamitous troubles CONCLUSION Mr Wise, in conclusion, appealed for fair play for (the new Ministry He said his defeat at Ashfield would not affect himself by any means so much as his return by a large majority would encourage the Government in its effort to advance the interest of the community he knew that in fighting this contest he was not meeting the opposition of Mr. Bavister so much as that of Messrs Carruthers and Reval Mr Wise, on finishing his speech, was rather restlessly cheered
