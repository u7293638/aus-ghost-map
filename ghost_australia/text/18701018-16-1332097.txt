THE NEW GERMAN WAR SONG. The Berlin correspondent of the Times sends the text of the new Rhine song, which, set to an inspiriting tune, has fast become the May seillaise " of the present war. He appends the following translation by Mr. G. Solling, late of [the Woolwich Academy:? j DIE WACHT AM ROBIN. THE RIUNE WATCH.) A roar like thunder strikes the ear, Like clang of arms or breakers near, ' On for the Rhine, the German Ullina! 'Who shields thee, my beloved Chino;' Boar Fatherland, their needs not four, Thy Rhineland watch stands firmly here. . A hundred thousand hearts beat high, The Hash darts forth from every eye, For Teutons brave. Inured by toll, Protect their country's holy soil. Dear Fatherland, their needs not fear, Thy Rhineland watch stands firmly here. The heart may break in agony, Yet Fronclunan thou shalt never do, In water rich is Milne ; thy Head, Germania, rich in heroes' blood. Dear Fatherland, their needs not fear, Thy Rhineland watch stands lVrmly here. When heavenwards ascends the eye. a Our heroes' ghosts look down from high ; We swear to guard our dear bequest And shield it with the German breast. Dear Fatherland, their needs not fear, Thy Rhineland watch stands firmly here. As long as German blood still glows The German sword strikes mighty blows, And German marksmen take their stand, No foe shall tread our native land. Boar-Fatherland, their needs Not fear. Thy Rhineland watch stands firmly here We take the pledge The stream runs by; Our banners, proud, are waiting high. On for the Rhine, the German Rhine! We all die for our native Rhine. Hence. Fatherland, be of good cheer. Thy Rhineland watch stands firmly here.
