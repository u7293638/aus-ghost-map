A recent English authority de clares no less than 13 oat of every 100 children attending the schools of the School Board for London habitually go to school in want of food. Charitable efforts have alle viated this misery to some extent, but still, "day by day, week after week, 25,000 are suffering from, hunger in the Board Schools of London, and "of these 8000 are infants, whose physical and mental growth is thus stunted at the commencement^ their lives." And John Morley, at a recent meeting of the Eigbly Club, when advocating free education, said: "Accurate statistics show that there are in the mefcropo'is at this ^moment 40,009 or more children who go into the elementary schools, voluntary and public, starving." Again, on the proposal to provide free halfpenny meals for the-e starring children, he says: " Where lias this movement started from ? It started from the teachers themselves. And why?.. Because they found it intolerable to at hour after hour, and day after day, in tJie mjiip. room with hunger. It is from them that i this*?demand>for a certain provision' office ; .. jneals has arisen.In thecity of Birmingham lai* winter, they ^gave outofa voluntary fund; 214,000 gratuitous meals." Vow, how much; of starvalioh .jahd jniMiy .was l£Et every day in the homes of these starving children ? The answer to this question would doubtless be stall more appalling than the statements we have just read--unutterable woe and anguish, in. thousands upon thousands of mothers' hearts in tbccfcirfjeityof what they boast of as the greatest empire in the world! Now, if anything is certain in the world of politics, it is that Great Britain must hereafter provide (as she can) for the relief, abatement, or ex- j tinctaon of. her pauperism and crime at home, out of the superabundant wealth of her. land, and" commercial and manufacturing and money monopolists, by: so me re-adjustment of her industrial and social life. Those who hold the wealth of the nation must bear its bur dens. and already a demand is being urged for. a juster distribution of the fruits of toil. She., most 6et her own honse in order. It Is notiby theramovalof hw crime and helplei'misejy to these State of Australia that she will find relief- It vronldi~rib 'doubt, be a J^eat tem porary relief to the nobility and gentry of England to shunttiie degodei,. tueless, ani utterly impoverished portion of the population i. i ,®f £ygi;- Britain. into these pro6perous«om mnnitaes. But that would be no permanent remedy; there ^would soon be a new army of hungry destitute to provide for, a per-' ;? - petnalTecnrrenqeof the same resultsfrom$he same causes!? The Australian nation as it is now has been created 'by the enteiprising, hardy, and industrious pastoraliste, miners, and toilers in every jbranch of industry, who have come here to apply their self-helpful and vigorous efforts to the vast resources of the land.' There is room for many millions of such men yet, but they will not be burdened -?'r wtfh thevice, jbelplese poverty, <or crime of Europe; will not allow Ansteaiia tobe maaea | place of deposit for the refuse population of Gxsat Briinm.

Sow. the poli ticians, priests, parsons, " meetusfcrs," and self-dabbed patriots of England, have lately turned their attention to free Australia.. Their object is to rivet the links that bind us to the happy order of tilings which theyhaye to rtile over , in Great Britain, Ireland, nad India, where hanger is. king and emperor. The country from whicli," under aristocratic rule," the bitter ciy of hunger and starvation has risen Cor centuries, which has held Irelandin continual poverty and hanger, accented by occasional famines, for.700 years, whicli has had iO^fMnines inlndia iwithin-'lioyaarsjis now urged to coineforthto keep under her : perpetual rale thefree men of Australasia. : And by whom is this proposed? Those who . lead ate--Lord Bosebery, an ex-Minister of the Grown, and Chairman.of the London! County Coimcil,. within .whose jurisdiction jthnt enormous mass of hungry children and wretcKod parents barelyexist; and Lord Car- j narvon. an ex-Minister of the Crown, and late Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, a large land monopolist in West Australia; and Cardinal -Manning, has .lately joined in the league. In stead of directing their ability, energy, and knowledge of to the work of humanity;. statesmanship, which lies before them and at their doors, these gentlemen hare started in pursuit of so-called Imperial Federation-a phantom, with less of substance behind it than Pepper's famous ghost. Let these men reflect upon a precedent famished by one of the greatest rulers of men, die ruler of the Chris tian world in his day. It is written of him that when he "(Gregory- the Great) was told one day that a solitary; unknown beggar had been fonnd dead from Nervation in the streets of Bomi, he excommunicated, himself for having allowed such a thing to happen in a city tinder his rule. For days he abstained from communion, shutting liimself up in his silent cell, to make atonement by tears and penance for his sin of omission -towards that poor starveling. But this Christian prince did j not believe ih " the survival of the ft: test," pr "the unrestricted play of competition," or fin any of the fine-spun, theories and phrases bf tile gospel of selfishness as rules of human life, used so often" to soothe men's consciences for allowing their fellow-men, women, and child ren to suffer, and even to perish, of Imager. He. was not afraid of pauperising the people, as'we'are. Are they not m -rast numbers already pauperised almost beyond redemption ? To your work in your own country, then, uny lords and lord cardinal, and leaveils ta ours to pverfc,if it may be, the evils of starvation lies, leave us to tey to keep away the' hungcr fiend from the children of oar fair land.ahd to rear a strong. brave, and powerful nation, having an ample range of duty in this new. sphere of action, where we may Keep the peace and follow industry and the arts, ai\d perfect freedom andthe noblest works of onr race. "What Australians desire,and will maintain, is the right todevelop theirnational life, as they wfll, nnfettered byrestricfionsfromabroad, or frotnany external authority. 5osr, whatare the purposes .of the league, which beats the absurd name of "Imperial Federation," andVhlch is. as yet,.regarded with indifference and contempt by Australians? ThiBisLord"Bosebery'saccount of it ^-^HTambeis of our critics have said, 'Your aspirations are all. veiy well, but man Hnddoes not fatten on aspirations, and we should begreatly gratified if you wonldgive as some information of hflw yon propose to cany your aspirations into effect.' Kbw, gentlemen, we have always resisted any such, demand. We have always felt there were great -reasons against the adoption of any: specific plan 'by the Imperial Federation League. In the first plaee,there Is the ex treme slowness with which public opinion moves in England towards any organic cli ange. (Hear, hear.) In the next place, we hare had to lace the fact that onr institutions, rootedas theyare in the customs and traditions of Hie jjast, are not suited for any sudden introduc tion of a new element; and, in the third {place we have to consider the natural jealousyof the young and aspiring Governments outside these islands of any paternal interference from with in-a jealousy which, in my opinion, -would be keen as regards the suggestions of the Imperial Government, bnt indefinitely keener when they came to be the suggestions of a private asso ciation. If-we. have not adopted a plan, it is not for want of suggestions from without. Many of those who hold onr views ate wedded to particular plans. Some have wished tp in troauce into the House of Lords colonial representatives; but there is a fatal objection to that, which is tfiat.the colonies do not "want it- Others h'ave wished to introduce colonial representatives into the House of Commons; there is a doable objection to.that Inthe first place, the House of Commons doesnot want it ; and/in-the next place, snch'an infcro-' ducfa'on could hardly be effected without, to some extent, affecting the local «iitcmbaiy of which oar" colonies are so justly prOud. Farther, it lias been suggested that the Priry Council offiere. the medium of some form of IriiperialFederation; but the Privy Council is abodywhieh does not lend itself readily to the inclusion of a representative element, and it would reunite as muchremodelling to intro duce a reallyrepresentative colonial element' as either of the other twobodies I have men-; tioned. .. A fourth party has thought that a Zollverein or Cuboids union; by which we shoald be guarded by a probative .system from the products of all other countries, would offier the best method of consolidating Mje empire ; but that isnota practical- way of consolidating tiie empire; if fit ever becomes practicable^it; will only be in years to come. The doctrines of free trade an;. Jar too deeply rooted inthis counfcry to leave hope fpr any general assent to such proposals .Jas. those to whirh I have alluded. \^ell,in spite of this attitude of .the Imperial. Federation League, they have at last come to, tiie conclusion, to whicli Ivonfess I came some time ago, as to the practical' and red form of Imperial Federation. I fiave always held that Imperial Federation was really inaugurated by the Colonial ^Goi^eRnce that took place in 1887." _ His.Iiordslup >veiy .truly adds no close scheme cooice outiif these1 conferences, and, indeed, if these: con ferences are found to he of no arail, and i»me to; nothing, then yon may be perfeetly certain : fchaty iwhatever .your -views may; be, or fyour ^ exertions maybe, Imperial Federation in any form is an impossible dream." And so niayit be.. Hie then goes on to reoommend arenewal of thie system of coriferences similar to that in 1^7, ?n which tho nayal defence scheme was arranged, by -which 'these &tates; of Au^iralia became trilmtories for 10 years to the people of Greit Britain. Such conferences,^ifi.erar, lield again, Ehould be treated as anatdjioriB^cl by us, unless a mandate of the whole|AjUB txalian people has been previondy obtained,, for sending representatives ^c<Aed for the pur pose by the people; and conferences intended, to affect ^j-vibiUy Austr^ian misp^tasliould, be lield only on Aostxalian eon j andM ^lonld: be diB^netly .aiader^tood, ^^ ejqrra^y.Sfipu-; lated and her rightto complete foeeigi and domestic ppJ^r>: .fvheneriar-Jirar^ j«presentatives sliall amtional^wflL ' ?
