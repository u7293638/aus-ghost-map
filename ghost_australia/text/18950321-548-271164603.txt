Spiritualistic Frauds, MrMaskelyne, in an interview which uppcnrct ia tliu k* JdngliHli lllu»tnit«il Magazine,” gives tlio following account of how he first began to suspect the bona Sides of spiritualism :—“ The first awaken ing of my interest in the exposure of spiritualistic frauds arose in this way. Ir was during my apprenticeship. Adja cent to our place of business there resided a. man and woman who professed to effect cures by mesmerism. About that time table- turning became a fashionable amusement, and the Fox family had «!artled America by a second edition of the • Cock-lane Ghost.’ Well, theso mesmerists commenced to hold spiritual istic seances, and one day the woman brought to our shop what sho called a surgical appliance to be lepairod. It con sisted of two levers, a long one and a short one, each mounted upon a pivc-t attached to a strap, and connected by a piece of catgut. As you may suppose, I en tirely failed to see what kind of snrgicalap pliance this thing could be, and wascurious to discover its real use. Having re paired it, I devoted a few minutes to experimenting with it, and found that by buckling tho strap of the short lever round the left ankle, and that of the long lever round the leg just below the knee, by pressing the right liael upon a projec tion at the side of tho short lever the long one could bo jerked up and made to strike the under-side of the table. Accord ingly, I booked it as a table-rapping apparatus, and tho bill was sent in : ’ Re pairs to table-rapping apparatus, Is. fid.' This I considered very sharp on my jiart at the time ; but it was aboul the worst thing 1 could have done, as it pre vented it complete exposure of these im postors being male. Although several persons, at my suggestion, attended the seancos afterwards, with the object of catching the lady red- handed, no table rapping was over attempted. This was a lesson by which I profited, greatly in my subsetiuent investigations.”
