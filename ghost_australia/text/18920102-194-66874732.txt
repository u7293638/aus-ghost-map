A Night With a Ghost. Otto Schiller is an aged German shoemaker, who fought in the Franco Prussian war. Otto has always been afraid of ghosts, and a short time ago, when asked to give his reason for be ing afraid, told the following story: Near the close of the Franco-Prus sian war, and while two opposing ar mies were facing each other, a battle expected the following day, a Prussian sentry was found asleep at his post one night. Next day there was no battle, but a hasty Icourt-martial tried the sentry, and condemned him to be shot at sunrise the following morning. Schiller was one of the squad detailed for the execution. The hapless sentry fell dead at the first volley from the firing party. The night fcllowing the execution Schiller was on picket duty and found himse'f on the post where the man lie helped to kill had been found asleep. At first he thought nothing of the strange coincidence, but toward mid night a feeling of dread came over him, and would not be shaken off. Just at 12 o'clock Schiller says he saw a soldier with a musket on his shoulder walking straight toward him on the picket line. ile thought it was the officer of the guard, but as the figure came nearer he saw the face of the man shot that morning. Schiller says the blood in his veins seemed to turn to ice; he was unable to move hand or foot, and could not utter a sound. The ghost of the dead sentry panted within two feet of him, walked on to the end of the beat, turned with military precision and retraced his steps. Back. and forth along the beat the ghostly .sentry continued to walk until near the break of day, when it teemed to vanish in the air. The eyes of the ghoist were closed as if in sleep, but iS musket was at a "shoulder arms," and it walked the beat with regular military tread. Next day the Prussiai army advanced, and Schiller did not. oe the sentry again, but he has ever siuce been .a firm believer in spooks.
