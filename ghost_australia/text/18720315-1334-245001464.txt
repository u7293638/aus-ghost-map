J3LINMAN. (From our own correspondent). March 11. Verily of late we have been afflicted like unto the Egyptians. The year at its com-, mencement brought unto us boils and blains, which fell upon both man and child. Then came the usual summer abomination of flics without number, causing the land (especially in the vicinity of butchers' shops) to become corrupt, and the eyes of men to be closed because of their spiteful and venomous bites. During the past week or 10 days we have been visited with countless myriads of locusts that have eaten up every green thing, and have entered into our houses, and sought to take up their abode in our cupboards, and even our teacups and coffee-pots. Many of the last-named pests being afflicted with guilty consciences, or determined to become a greater nuisance in their death than they had been in their lives, selected one of the deep wells as a spot for committing suicide. If their determination to become, or to continue a nuisance even in death led to their taking this step, I think their ghosts must take a fierce delight in their success, for the stench arising from their remains is abominable, and the water of course undrinkable. The season appears to be an unhealthy one in our neighborhood, and peculiarly fatal to children; for even in our small community there has been a child's funeral almost every day for the past three or four weeks. Affairs at the mine appear to be pretty much as usual, and the appointment of Mr. Botting as Superintendent in the place of the late Mr. Fiveash has not as yet effected any visible alteration in the management. I should say the Company ; s pretty sanguine in its expectation of the mine becoming payable, as I understand they have engaged with Captain Terrell for a two years continuation of his services. The weather has been very hot of late, but we were favored with a nice cool change on Friday afternoon, when it became cloudy, and seemed to threaten rain, but none has fallen up the present.
