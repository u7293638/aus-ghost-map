' SPIRIT PROTOGRAPUS." Ton some little time past a New York City photos aphis has di even an active business in the production of what he terms " spirit photographs, in which faintly outlined figures sold to be those of departed relatives and fi leads -are seen attendant upon the pictures of living sitters lina proceeding having at last been brought to the notice of the authorities in the form of a charge of false pretenses, many curious items have been elicited both as to the credulity of human nature and the numerous ways in which photography may be adopted to the carrying out of on imposition of the character and cecil Of these latter the following were more tioned as fully practicable by a witness - 1 A glass with an image on it of the desired spirit form may be placed in the share holders front of the 10 sensitive plate, so that the image on the glass will be impressed upon the sensitive plate together with that of the sitter wheeze and distinctness of the spirit form will vary so cording to the distance between the two plates 2 A figure of clothed new line can be introduced for a moment behind the sister, and thou be with drawn before the sitting is over, leaving a shallow V range on the plate This is known as * Sir David Brewster a ghost " 1 A mica scenic picture of the spirit form can be inserted in the current box alongside of the ions, and by a small magnifying lens its lineage can be thrown on the sense of place with that of the sitter 1 A gloss with the spirit image" can be placed behind the sensitive plate after the sitting is completed, and by a feeble light the image can be impressed with that of the sister 5 the intention of silver birth may have a glass side and the mile be impressed by a secret light, while apparently the glass plate is only being coated with the sensitive film 6 The ' spirit form ' can be printed but on the negative, and then the figure of the living matter added by a second printing, of it can be justified on the paper and the sitter's portrait printed over it 7 A sensitive plate can be prepared by what is known as the dry process the ' spirit form ' impressed on it, and then at a subsequent time, the pot front of the living sitter can be taken on this same place so that the two will be developed together This result the witness had several times obtained by accident, having used one of these dry sensitive plates for a fund scope, and forgotten to develop it and then use it again and found the two landscapes curiously intermingled -sameness Artisan SPECTACLES With most persons, there is an epoch in life when the eyes become slightly flattened It arises, probably, from a diminished activity of the secreting vessels The consequence is that the globe is not kept quite as completely distended with fluid as in youth and middle age there is thus an elongated taxis of vision A book is hold further off to be tend Fmnllv, becoming more fluttered by the alleged inactivity within, the difficulty is met by putting on convex ginger This is the waning vision of age If, however, when that advancing imperfection is first realised, the individual persists in the attempt to keep the book in the old focus of vision even if he reads under per plexing disadvantages, never relaxing, but per soil snugly proceeding just us he did when his eyes were in the meridians of their perfection, the slack vessels will at last come up to his as asistance, and the original focal distance will be re established This statement will unquestionably be combated, energetically, by those who use glasses But it will be a waste of forensic power, because the fact is established beyond cavil We do not pretend it will be successful in every instance, but generally, if glasses are much resorted to, then the opportunity of doing without them is for ever lost Very aged men may be noticed reading fine print, and ladies, too, by scores, who resisted glasses at the age of life referred to who enjoy all the comfort of distinct vision, and they will, until, like the deacon's chaise, every stick in the vehicle falls to pieces at the some time Therefore, begin with a firm resolution never to use glasses of any kind for reading or writing The ancients knew nothing about such contrivances , if they had, there would have been poor eyes in abundance, and oculists to meet the emergency Cicero never complained of imperfect vision at the age of sixty three He even wrote his last letter by torchlight, on the eve of being put to death by the waiting soldiers Humboldt died at the age of ninety two, having never been embarrassed with those modern contrivances, in nettes John Quincy Adams, illus.riosts for scholarship, at a ripe old age sow without them Indeed, it would be a laborious enterprise to collect a catalogue of names in the chronicle of literary fame, of men and women, who were in dependent of glasses -Du JVC Smith, in the Scientific American The Effect of Charcoal by Fiowtebs - A horticulturist in England purchased a rose bush full of promising buds-the flowers, however were of a faded hue He covered the earth in the List about an inch thick with pulverised charcoal, and was surprised, some days afterwards, to find the blooms of a fine lively rose color He repeated the experiment another season with the same result He then tried the powdered charcoal upon petunias, and found that both the white and violet colored flowers were equally sensitive to its action It always gave great vigor to the red or violet color of the flowers, and the white petunias became veined with red or violet tints , the violets became covered with irregular spots of a bluish or almost black hat Many persons who admired them thought they were choice new varieties from the seed yellow flowers appear to be insensible to the influence of charcoal AA hat Jury, and then A ext? A remarkable discovery has just been made by a man at Grenoble, by which it is calculated that cemeteries and graveyards will become super famous At the dictates of an individual the body is plunged into a liquid invented by the man of Grenoble, and in about five years the individual is turned into stone The secret of the putrefaction is known only to the discoverer But he goes further He says that in a thousand years' time, if people will only preserve their relatives and friends they will be able to build houses with them and thus live in residences surrounded by their ancestors People are sIwjvs advised to put the best foot forward AA hat disposition is to be made of the other a
