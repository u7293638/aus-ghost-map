It was then shown that there was no necessity for the engine to be turned at that particular time and it follows that life was then lost through want of proper arrangements On the present occasion life was endangered without, as it would appear, anx adequate necessity, since it is difficult to concave voted the engine in question could not have taken up the required position before the time when the trains amend the station -Goulburn n Jltrald DErMeRE OF SIR As FIll loss -His Excellency SuW Jervois left South Australia on Wednesday afternoon February 13, for Europe by the steamer Stud Amsterdam There was no demonstration of invalid His Excellency left Adelaide by a special trains half past 2 in the afternoon and proceeded to the Semaphore without any stoppage He was occur sued) the Chief Secretary (the Hon A Morgan), the Commissioner of Public Works (the Hon G C Hawker) and his aide de camp and private secretary the Chief secretary) said Good bye at the Semaphore but the Commissioner of Public Works accom panedtheOovernor to the Stad Amsterdam on board The Government s earner Lady Diana The shipping withered and in the roadstead dismayed their bunting in honour of the departing representative. e of her Majesty - ?

Mr Newell has to pay costs as well as to bear the loss of his horse and the damage to his car rage, but he has rendered a public service in bringing the affair before a court of Justice We do not propose to examine the evidence, or to offer any opinion upon the verdict, but we say that that accident TO preventible and that an express law ought to make the recurrence of such an accident impossible The most careful regulations in the use of the steam roller wall not prevent such accidents, for now and then there will be negligence or error But there is a simple and effectual means of prevention Prohibit thereof the steam roller during the day All the (teamrolling can and should be done between mid night and 6 o'clock in the morning The Metropolitan Board of WA asks has the power to forbid the use of the steam roller except in the night and we urge the adop- tion of the suggestion asteroid means of preventing suchtcidmts03 that which depended the lives of MT ÎUuraellswife and children How deep would have been the public regret and indignation if that preventible accident had cost the life of our most popular novelists of of h Qlín-Ï!,-A'--~Tho Ixellx and Leon troupe at was tt-atiäha,e every reason to be satisfied with the amount of public patronage decor ded to them ex light freight i hate, or the weather may be-and it was easy shot saturday night as it was a warning and tormythewecUefore-the little theatre is crowded M people seem never wear of the jokes and screen wmcswhi h constitute the evening s entertainment accompany made a change in their programme on swan and announced the eUiavaganra boitj/onciie orhateveritmav be called in the '?
