RAVENSWOOD. [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] September 30. The Ravenswood mining journal quietly gave up the ghost a few weeks back. It is to be resurrected though, I hear. Somebody must have newspaper on the brain. The local hospital has been re-opened and several cases have already received its benefits. Dr. Comyn having left the field, Mr. Best, chemist, is at present attending the patients. A doctor is being advertised for at a salary of Â£150 a year. A good doctor would by private practice fetch his income up to '600 a year. Previous doctors have made far more than that. The population here greatly consists of married people with large families. The Church of England is being removed and rebuilt. At present the Court House is made use of for the services. A man named Bourke, camping out at Sandy Creek, attempted to commit suicide a few days ago whilst suffering from delirium tremens. He was brought in here and placed in the hospital. The gash the man made in his throat was not dangerous.
