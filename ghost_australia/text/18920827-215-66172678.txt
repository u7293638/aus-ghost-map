THE SPIRITS AT WORK. That curiosity, fully indulged, is liable to prove expensive is a lesson (says"' Answers ") that has just been thoroughly learned by a certain medical gontleman. In the matter of spiritual manifestations he has always been a stiff-necked and unre generate doubter. As a child he scoffed a ghost stories. and when he grew up the spectre world became a mark for his merry quips and saurastic jests. Despite this he numbers among his friends many of those who believe in the existenco of shades, and they never negleot an opportunity to hurl arguments at his head whidh inay tend to bring him over to the ramike of the elleot.

Ho had never gone to a materialising seance, and was anxious to see what one was like, so he put a quiet little advertisement in a daily paper, stating that an unbeliever would liho to engage a reputable medium for test manifestations. At S o'clock on the evening in question a little party of eight personal friends satwith clasped hands in the doctor's drawing room, and stared anxiously in the direction of the black cloth cabinet, which was faintly out lined in the gloom. A pale young man, accompanied by an obese female, had answered the doubter, and guaranteed to produce a very fline line of de parted spirits for a five-pound note. For over three.quarters of an hour visitors from the other world kept dropping into the doctor's drawing-roam, sailing round his rathornervous guests, and departing. Then there was a long and dreary wait, which was ended by the upturning of the gas. The pale young man and the obese female had vanished as completely as the spectres they had been supplying. Their cabinet remained, and with it a small bag filled with white crepe. In the next ten minutes two purses, a watch, and four sorf pins were discovered to be missing. The evening's entertainment cost the doctor something in the neighborhood of L100, and his disbelief in spirits is now something rapid. The police were not notified.
