SINGULAR INCIDENTS. Two remarkable and wonderful cases of recovery from bullet wounds have lately taken place in the metropolis of London. In one case, that of a girl who was shot by her lover, the bullet is deeply inSedded in the head, too deep to admit of any operation; yet the patient had bean discharged from the hospital convalescent. The other case was one cefi attempted suicide, the sufferer having shot himself in the head with a revolver. In this case, too, the bullet is still in the brain, and in such a position as to prevent the operation of extraction. In spite of this the patient has been discharged from hospital care, and it is said that he suffers no incon venience from the conseqnence of his rash net. A curious coincidence in con nection with these cases is that both shots were fired on the same day, the 19th Gf Jane, and that both cases were treated at the London Hospital. " The times have been," says Shakspeare, " that when the brains are out the man would die." The poet puts these words into the mouth of Macbeth, when that; wicked king sees the ghost of Banquo: rise before him. In the eases just cited we have a reality which no noet could equal in romance. People walking about in the flesh with bullet3 in their brains are certainly more wonderful things than spectres. The marvellous recoveries from what, "a few years ago, would have meant eertain. death, must be credited to surgical skill and the modern anti- septio method of treating wounds.
