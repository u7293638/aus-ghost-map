i FATIIElt HYACINTHE ON THE INFALLI I DILITY DOGMA. 22 The following letter morn rather Ilxacmthe has been published in the Journal des Debats - " A very serious question is now presented to all Catholics Ought they to adhere to the definition of the Iiif-ilhbil} of the Pope, or are they free to withhold their submission to it?

prelates representing the most important and most enlightened portions of Catholicity are known, as 13 also their recent letter, it once rim and respectful, in which, while maintaining their negative votes, they have explained their reasons for retiring from the dis- honourable battle field The world cannot be unaware of the absence of dignity, I may even say of serious consideration, with which the high interests of the faith have been treated by a majority which would not have been tolerated in the ancient Council, both on account of its factitious and illusory composi- tion and its audacious oppression Another condition, not less upon tant than the ceremony of a Council, is that it should be recognized as such by the Church the Council, in fact, had no mission to impose new beliefs upon the faithful, but to maintain, and if need ful to define, the ancient creeds The Bishops are, above all others, witnesses of the traditional and historic faith of their respective Churches and of the Universal Church, and their sentence as judges, limited in advance by the very nature of this testimony, can only be pronounced upon truths which have been accepted from the beginning, everywhere and always, as leycaled-quod semper quod ubique quod as our thus If, then, they should happen to overstep their powers, the Church would not recognise its faith 111 the arbitrary work which they had accomplished, and the Council would remain without authority Such cases are not unexampled, and to cite only one, history has recorded the name: of Seleueias and Inman, and the almost universal defection under which, to use the words of St Jerome, the AV oriel groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian The danger is no less at the present time, and is one of the most important members of the Council (Monsignor Kennelly) is to be believed, the Church has never known so great a peril At such times it behoves even the humblest of Christians to uplift his voice in defence of his faith and the faith of all For myself I feel my self inwardly compelled to fulfil that duty, and as the prophet soldier author animal turn liberalism I protest, therefore, against the

Liv. VU. letter 88, edit. Boned." Mit. MORLEY-The Telegraph remarks that nothing could have been more friendly, more dignified, and more honourable than the tone which Mr. Motley has assumed throughout his dealings with our Government. It has no reason to suppose that the Minister has in any way changed his views with reference to the points at issue between this country and America ; but he has urged them in a manner which left room for fair discussion and honest difference, and not after the fashion of Mr. Sumner's intemperate and illogical indictment. The consequence is, that he has obtained a hearing which could not have been conceded to any one-sided exposition of partisan view s and he has, it is hoped, paved the way for a permanent and amicable settlement of the questions which still divide England and America. It is no light praise to say that Mr. Motley has sustained the repute in which the very highest American diplomatists have been held in England ; but to that praise the departing Minister is justly entitled. In all free States where parties hold rule in turn, there are many considerations bearing on home politics of whose cogency foreigners cannot fairly judge and we are certain that Mr. Motley would most justly resent any attempt to con veithis recall into an occasion for depreciating the merits of Republican institutions. The reverse which has befallen him is one to which every servant of party Government is liable on both sides the Atlantic and all we can offer to the departing visitor is our frank assurance that, though any American Minister will be welcome among us, his successors will find it hard to regain the place which Mr. Motley's personal qualities and reputation had ensured to him in England as well as in America.
