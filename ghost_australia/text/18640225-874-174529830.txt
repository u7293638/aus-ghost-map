#f Bap and excessive belief in anything is the quality we describe as superstitious. Cricket, Mr. SAXBY, and the M'CTTTXOOH Ministry are just now regarded superstitiously. Gentle superstition possessed at one time the depositors in the Provident Institute. Belief in the near settlement of the land question would betray an obstinate superstitionist. Reliance on gunpowder and greenbacks is the great superstition of the Yankees. " PEPPEES'S Ghost," at the Princess Theatre, was not superstitiously regarded. And nobody will be found more thoroughly free from all superstitious belief in one Than bank managers in private parlours, when yoa want to overdraw your account.
