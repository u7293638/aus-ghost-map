STARVING GERMAN IMMIGRANTS. Some little excitement bnB been created in town this week by reports of German scltiers near Benalla,dying from starvation. It has since been proved that the first reports were somewhat exaggerated, although some have died, and all of thrm are in a destitute condition. - It appears they came but tnthie clony a few months ago by the inducement of a prophetess, named . Maria Heller (who is slill with them) who predicted that there would lie fearful ware in. Germany, and other parts ofthe world, bnt .Australia would be free from all etrife, anil upon her advice tboy mustered all the money they could, anil arrived here iu the Somersetshire. The prophetess forbade them to work, and of coarse . they starred. A countryman bad asalsted them foe sometime, but ho re fused to do so any longer on account of their Riiperstitioua belief in Maria Heller. Disease' nod . death . of course followed. They : cannot speak English, and the doctor and others who visited them had to procure the services of an interpreter. -Loads of pro virions have been sent, for which they ' are very grateful. The prophetess still continues to prophesy, and says . . that - she has - direct instructions from the Holy Ghost ; bnt the Inspector of Foliee astonished her when he told her, through the interpreter, that if she did not stop that ibrt of thing she would be placed in tbelnnaticaeylum, a place she would not be allowed to leave if once within its walls. It hae been stated that immorality was practised in the camp, but this is atoritlv denied by the investigators, who asert that. the sexes are kept separate.
