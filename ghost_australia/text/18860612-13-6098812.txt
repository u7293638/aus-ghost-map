"HOMEWARD BOUND." BY "THE VAGABOND." TO COLOMBO. Rounding the Leuwin the winds and the waves make us their sport, and the as Home never misses a chance. She rolls at every opportunity. Then come a few heavy tropical showers to add to the season of oar discon- ' tent. I get weatherbound in my quartern amongst the beasts and the birds, and think regretfully of the days on the Woodbine, when, in a state of nature, 1 would take a bath on deck in such weather, the sharp rain washing the salt out of my Bkin 'lhat barque, however, is now wrecked, and the skipper is dead, butbo'sun (at IOBC advices) still rules supreme m the Lithgow Collieries' yard at Sydnej, and I am again having strange experiences amongst animals afloat I have beard north country people say it is healthy to sleep in a " bj re. J hu\e had to camp m a cow house m the course of my wanderings, and was kept warm bj tbc calf which lay alongside me , but sleeping next to the cows on board snip I find is quite a different thing 'lhere is but a half-inch plank between my bunk and their shed A lurch of the vessel, and there is a violent impact against the par tition, and I awake with the impression that the sjde of the ship has been knocked m T. he cows' cabin is well padded, but mino is not. They rany not get bruised, but I am sore. One of these animals is an Australian shorthorn offspring of the Colac herd, the other a Brittany Ihe former gives far the most milk, mid is in every way the superior beast, the pride of the butcher, who bus the charge of all theammuls on board 'Hie ship's baker is as tall as the doctor or the Government Resident at Alban} Ile is a man who, by tho quality of his breakfast rolls and pie crust, would have been pro inoted by Pharoah to stand on bia left hand whilst (he butler "Mac" poured out the seductive anteprandial cocktail on the right But the smart )oung butcher interests me most Ships' butchers are always smart I have known many ot them, us in the da) s v hen I was a dog fancier the butchers on the AY bite btur, Inman, and Cunard lines have had heavy fees from me for taking care of prize pets Our Komim butcher has enough to do in looking after the cows, sheep, mar supials, and birds Many ot the parrots and magpies die, and a black cockatoo, alter many da) s of piteouB croaking, also expires. If this had lived, it would have beca the first of its kind in Uurope, and as such would have been greatly admired by lovers of natural history But, regard- less of the fame in store, this bird would make no effort, but gives up the ghost to the grief ot its owner, Mrs. Langton, and the joy of the boatswain bold whose slumbers it had disturbed. 'I he wallabies and the sheep are sometimes indulged with a run and ii hop on deck in the morning, but the two larger marsupials are not trusted outside their cage. It is part of the diiy'u diversion for our Baloon ladies to visit the menagerie aft and feed the birds. Anything green greatly excites the wallabies and emus, whose an- cestors may have suftered exceedingly in some of our Australian droughts, and who have the hereditary idea that the greatest good in this world is connected with verdure, not knowing that there is more edible virtue in corn and biscuit than ni stale lettuce leaves We envy the emus their appetites, for it is a considerable contract to get through the meals on a P and 0. boat Breakfast, tiflin, and dinner fill up a lot of onr time, and the seeds of future dyspepBia are laid by man). They feed us, in fact, a trifle too well I, writing hard in my stable, generally avoid tifliu, which in hot climates I believe kills more people than fe\er. But I only once resist the curries at night 'lucre is one very charming arrangement on board the Rome the number of small tables on each Bide of the B.iloon enables parties to be formed, and people visit their friends at dinner. And at leeding time we are generally all as happy and jolly as can be, except the waiters per chance-the hardest worked of mortals on shipboard As we proceed on our 3 300 miles' voyage from Albany to Colombo, the peculiarities of individuals become accentuated The man 3 ou could stand for a week in a country house, jon get to loathe on board ship The man who would not lia» e a chance of speak mg to you on shore, unless with his bat in his hand, ia now familiar and oflensive We, the lookers on, ha\e great fun in watching the doings of the Eminent Ones. The first every morning patronises the weather and the ship and the passengers, and takes as it «ere, credit to himself that all things are good The second acts as auctioneer at the au. eeps, and is doing missionary work after the manner of his kind, in enlarging on the demoralising effects of, and bewailing the threatened ad» eut of the totaheator on the Australian turf, which "will rum the ring ' At least he sa) s BO, and I hope he will be a true prophet. There is a good deal of speculation as regards these sweeps, and the luck which some people enjoy leads to a deal of grumbling But the eminent bookmaker, 1 take it, is the most popular man on board the Rome , not even Mr L L. Lewis, our uiti epi ellem pat excellence, plays his part so well 'Hie bookmaker and his "pal, ' the New faouth Wales commissioner are the li vest and smartest men on board the ship both types of our Australian civilisation. Sir James M'Culloch is certainly the most distinguished looking man on board. Ile looks like one who has had a career Our agent general in the bosom of his family ap peurs the happiest The most miserable is a young Saxon globetrotter, who drops too much at loo The best sailor on the ship IB, without doubt, Mrs -, of Sydney, whoBe grandchildren 1 have nursed in New Caledonia, her son in law, Captain Dillon, being an old friend of mine And the prettiest girl in the saloon I have no hesita tion in saying is Miss Blank, of- Do yon ask me where her Australian habitat is situated? I give it up She is Australian, that s enough When I get to Tngland I hope to hear nothing of New South Wales or Victoria, but much of Australia, That is my missionary ticket However, all agree that Miss-, oti St Kilda is the favourite of the ship Captain Edwards and mjself greatly admire the manner in which Bhe over powers that most magniliccnt yet most courteous being the purser, "sits on a too forvrard admirer, casts a rapid glance over to our table and Bends a smile and a bow equally divided between us, doe3 not flirt, not a fraction of it in her, but holds her own and has just the same good natured manner to all "Not spoilt one bit we agree, and hope she will always remain thus. The Eminent Patromser is as much puz7led with our Esplanade damsel as he is with Mrs - One thing on board the Rome annoys me very much. It is vividly brought before me that cliquism is rapidly developing itself in Australia. Some of the lady passengers avoid each other. There is a perpetual fear that when they get "Home" they may be claimed as acquaintances by other and rival heiresses of the Golden Fleece. Each one wishes to play a lone hand. I begin, too, to think that many of them are rather ashamed of their connexion with the colonies. They would like to be thought " English, you know I" I have been asked Bince I left Aus- tralia, " Why do not young men in Mel- bourne marry '!" I think the reply is cosy. All our lasses want to begin where their mothers left off. They all wish to have un- limited credit at Buckley and Nunn'B, wear expensive jewellery, be in the first swim in " society," make trips " Ilome, " and minglo with aristocratic crowds. Pushing to the tront they would push back others who attempt to compete with them. And yet each one outside Sydney or Melbourne is a déclassée. Australiennes have not the courage of American womanhood. They want to be, or, at leaBt, appear what they are not, hence mistakes and social heartburnings on board the Rome. With the men, however, it is dif- ferent With striking exceptions no male Australian, bom or reared, isa snob, although he sometimes may be a Yahoo. My complaint is lather that we are not suflietently par- ticular who we fraternise with. And taking the Borne as a duodecimo sample of the world, I find that the men who could really talk best are the moat silent. Amongat the mighty men of war, both of sea and land, who turn up amongst the globe trotters in the saloon, Colonel Cox is the most modest, and Major Murphy Bays nothing In tlieeo da>R, when so much is talked about the protection of the Empire, it is rather strange to find here two distinguished officers of Her Majesty s forces, the former a natue of Tasmania, the latter of Victoria. They have been practically helping Great Britain for a long time I like most soldiers and sailors, and the talk of the captains in the smoking room inte rests me much, especially that of the gallant South African warrior, who knew the Prince Imperial, and gi» es us some new light as to his death In the smoking room, too, there is a true British llavour, which asserts itself in one quarter in animadversion of the " penny papers, ' a phiuse linne not heard tor 13 years And so the Rome gracefully rolls on her w ay to Colomba I write " gracelull),'because Captain Edwards particularly draws attcii tion to this. Our motion is not that ol a jerk or a waddle, it is a graceful Bwmg 'Hie result, hotve\cr, is the Bame-unpleasant We can find nothing to grumble at m the Baloon It is getting hot at nights, but Mr G Langburne, kindest of chief officers, rigs up a hammock for me on deck My crippled knee punis me, but Dr Birley, who runs the purser becond in the beauty of his " get up' and attention to passengers, blisters mc violently, and will go on doing it if I like I ba^o to listen to complaints from the Becond class passengers, that they have no piano and no stewardess m their saloon, »»Inch ccrtaml) might be altered. And I hine to listen to confidences from the joung Indies, und speculations us to why someone »vears all the jewellery in the family at brcuk tast time. 'Hie bath parade is earlier m the morning as we run northward and the ladies and officers come out in white clothes. It becomes a puzzle us to »vliere all the dirty linen used on the ship is consigned Before we get to the " fighting ground,' the second Sun day arru es The Rev Mr 1 orbes, a gentle man who disdains the title of a "Wandering Protestant Preacher," again officiates, «lth Mr. Lewis ns organist, and a scratch choir T here has pre» louslj been a muster, and a fire and boat parade At the latter everyone in the ship rushes to his own place. The captain, the doctor, the stewardess, and the boatswain are sure on duty, a faithful crew But what I cannot exactly understand is where are we to go in case of trouble ' All verj well for the officers and crew to kno»v their station and rush to a place of safety in time of danger, but what is to become of us, the poor passengers ' And would not we be crowded out by these Lascars ' I load my six Bhooter when I get back to my cabin. Onward we steam across the Indian Ocean The incipient flirtations become pronounced but not deadly The children are now so used to the ship that they are a nuisance But the) little know what they owe to Captain Ld wards, who promptly suppressed the idea that a Sunday school should be established on board As the weather gets warmer our costumes become lighter, and the oflicers are beautiful in short white jackets and pants, the effect of which, however, is spoilt after sitting down We are half way to Colombo, when we are near the only land between Ceylon and Australia, the Cocos or Keeling Islands which we pass 70 miles to the east- ward, being 1,100 miles from the nearest point of Australia 500 miles from Java, and 1 460 miles from Ceylon T hese were dis covered by Captain Keeling of the Honourable East India Company's service, in 1608, but were heard nothing of afterwurds till 1823, when a certain Captain Alexander Hare, a real beachcomber of the Pacific type, settled in the Cocos with a seraglio of Malay women He was succeeded by a Captain Ross, who took possession of the islands and left a son to succeed him therein. The half caste popu lation at this day is not very numerous, the community being something like what one finds on the islands in Torres Straits. But no missionary has been to the Cocos. These are but a group of coral islands forming an atol, over which the storms burst and the waves dash during the hurricane months So the seafowl roost on the trees, and the rats make their nests high aloft in the cocoa palms It is only visited by stray vessels taking horses to India Sometimes skippers, becalmed near the Cocos, send ashore for fresh water and cocoanuts and lowls But few islands m the Pacific are so unknown as the Cocos or Keelmgs, the inhabitants of which principally live on cocoanut« and land crabs, und as regards religious ideas or know ledge of the outer world are as perfect savages as are to be found on the face of the earth. Tne fighting/one, as Captain I'dviards ex plains to me, is justbeforeyou get to Colombo If passengers have not quarrelled before then they will get on all right afterwards As a diversion we lla^e two nights amusements a "Wa\worL exhibition and an operetta on tbe first, and a dramatic performance on the second The very greatest credit is due to all concerned in " Mrs Jarley s " show With the scant appliances on board ship, how the young ladies manage to make up so well is a m)ster> But all women can "dress a part, ' if they cannot act it T he favourite tableaux arc " The Dirty Boy " (Pears adver tising statuette), " Bluebeard and his Wives (the rutiraa of which I hope will ha\ e a better fate), "Britannia, and "Australia. The counterfeit presentment of Britannia, an exact reproduction of the figure on tbe bronze coinage, IB far and away the best, and the ship s favourite scores heavily over this, but I take the greatest interest in Young Aus traba, represented by Miss Berry The musical entertainment is just as good, and is a great relief after the stupid ' mind reading and "mind willing" which has hitherto occupied so many of ourevenings, one soung girl being nearly driven into hysterics thereby I dislike this "parlour psychological re search, as it opens the way to the chicaneries of the professional medium But if the tableaux manta are good, how can I describe the amateur theatricals, except that they are the best I have cvei seen, equal to any professional requirements Both in the " Happy Pair and "Nan, the Good tor Nothing, there is nothing lacking If Mrs LewiB is a gain to society, I recognise now that Rosa Dunn has been a great losa to the stage.

In the twelfth century, when the Plantagenet^ had just commenced to rule England, the celebrated King of Ceylon, Prikrama Bahu, "not only deteated the rulers of Southern India states, but sent an army against the King of Cambodia, which, proving victorious, made that distant land tributary to Ce) Ion ' Au conti aire Mr. Fer- guson tells mc that " early in the 15th century a Chinese army penetrated to the heart of the hill country, defeated the Singalese forces captured the king, and took him away prisoner to China, and the island for some time had to pay an annual tribute to that countrj " I also learn that the Chinese exported from Ces Ion a large quail tityof Juoltn for potters This makes me uneasj T he other day ni Gipps Land I passed near a large /aolni seam at Toongabbie. Australia is much nearer to China than Ceylon, and if the Mongolians should covet this pottery clay and in\ade us ' In 1505 the continent of America waa only just discovereu, and Britannia, " at heaven's command," or otherwise, had not commenced to rule the waves, being content with 'civil and religious broils at home, and an occa sional Bully into Trench territory. The Spaniard, the ' l'ortingal,' and the Hollander were masters of the seas The Portuguese, therefore, at this date took Ces ion, which then was under seven separate rulera That is, sol- diers and priests occupied the low country, but theKingofKandy, in his mountain fastnesses, defied the European imader It is noticeable that although the Chinese, 100 j ears before, had captured the king "ni the heart of the hill country," the 1 uropeaus were alwujs beaten by the Singulese Highlanders 1 or 150 years the " l'ortingal ' and Holy Church ruled, and then the Dutch expelled them and com nienced the making of canals and Protestant proselytes. The Dutch developed the trade of the country, and encouraged agriculture, till the british, who bud now taken up their heritage of the " natural destins,' turned out the Ms nherrs in 1717, and for live S cars Ceylon was placed uuder the control of "John Company," when it was made a Crown colony All this time the Highland King of Kandy hud held his own, ruling like a despot in the hills, and descending occa sionally into the Low country like a true never, plundering and mutilating the people. Ihe British put him down m 1815, when General fair Robert Brownrigg, G C B , an ancestor of our Victorian colonel, was Governor Wikkrama fainha, the last King of Kondy, anpears to have been a sort of 'Iheebaw, of Burmah His people were glad to get nd of him He was captured, deposed, and exiled, and since then the i aj of England has never been disDuted m Ceylon by aught more important than a good not It is by far the most important of the posses sions of England ruled from the Colonial Office, not only irom its population and wealth, but its strategical position in re Bpect to India and Australia. There is something for our )onng Austra- lian to think of as he first sails along the coast of "Lanka the resplendent" A past of the ancient glory of a mighty people, the ruins of whose anctent capitals are " only second to those of Egypt in vastness of extent and architectural interest " The history of perhaps the most potent religion in the world-Buddhism-is bound up with Ceylon. Records of hard fighting and Lastern cruelty-of Portuguese fanatacism and Dutch trade selfishness-of the establishment at Colombo of the greatest cutt epat of steamship travel in the world. Galle is now nearly de tunct as far as traffic with the outer nations is concerned. There is one ship lying nt anchor in the roads as we pass The town itself, with its high lighthouse, cupolas, and houses bosomed in the trees, looks very picturesque from the sea But to many the most beauti ful thing in Ce) Ion is the great unbroken grove of cocoanut palms extending all along the coast for nearly 200 miles. This is the work of the Dutch Gov ernor, Van Imhoff, who m 1740 had the waste lands on the coast surveyed and divided amongst the people, who were compelled to plant it with newly imported nut The result of their forced labour is that now there is an average yield of one thousand millions of nuts, the greater por- tion used as food for the people, but also pro ducingthousonds of hundredweights of oil and coir for export Wise Van Imhoff ! Ceylon has had worse Governors of British blood And now the passengers crowding the deck of the Rome are rejoiced with the Bight of Adam's Peak, whose jagged summit is 7,353ft. high - a mountain held sacred alike by BuddhiBta, Hindoos, Mahome dans, and Roman Catholics Some say that one of the scenes of the Temptation waB enacted here, others that it was Adam's fav ounte morning walk Hence he would look towards the east longingly, thinking of the Eden from which he had been banished. From Adam's Peak I ara told there is one of the grandest views in the world The highest mountain in Ceylon is Pidurutalagala, 8,29uft, but Adam's Peak is ever the most prominent feature in the ranges either from land or sea. Iroin the sea Ceylon appears like the mountain region of Otago, New Zealand, planted m the midst of a tropical garden Verily, " every prospect pleaseB here Now and then in the dense cocoanut grove one sees glimpses of colour in a red tiled root or brown thatch There is a heavy population nearly three millions- in a country one sixth the area of Ireland, and a large portion ot which is covered by mountain rangea A large number live if not entirely on the water, at least bj the products of the sea 1 ishing catamarans are sailing up and down the coast, and we pass many ot them lying to and drawing in their nets, lins stvle of boat is known to every school- boy It is nenrly the Bame as the 11.07a canoe of the South '-ens.
