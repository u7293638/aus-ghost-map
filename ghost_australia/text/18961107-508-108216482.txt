On the Island of Shadows. (By Ernest paVen^-j ''??:', 7 pig is the \- ' story told' by ^-aBusesne Tri ^^^ mt... ..eqimc?; frpm New Ca ^^ Jedpnia,' pf What, happen ed to feim dur ing taie boat voyage -wihen he - succeeded dn m.aking his es cape. He died in the hospital at Hpng k-oHg, insane, having lost his reason through the suffering and priija*ipn i,e went through ob that, eccasinn. He iiaA lucid intervals, during which ae repeatedly told this gtory, aftd. insisted pn its truth. He was rescued fnim a sand.y is]e| pn the enter egge. of the Qvea^ Barrier- Heaf, off the caast of Nppthem Queensland by a China steamer feking the p.ute]de passage. He had been cas;t away jhe're for. some weekfij Hying on trepang and ehell-fish. Nothing was seen to in any way bear put this story- ' * '-''.? ♦ 9 ? ? *. 'Three of us alone between sea and sky — three men with a .wolf inside each, wolves that looked &t; each pifiher put of our eyes. Grpnard crouched in the bottom of the boat, gnawing at a piece of wepd; Pelrine sat at the stern, with his sheath knife in his band, digging savagely at the thwart; I was sitting in the bow. The sail flapped idiy at every little swing and roll of the boat, just as it had flapped during the last fortnight, never once bellying but. 'Beside us three there was the sun — *he sun that hated us so. Hot and eager it rose in the morning — hot and -eager to drink our blood. With anger that we should be still alive, it set in the evening. Gronard cursed the sun, Pelrine cursed thfe sun, and I cursed the sun. That was all we did from morning to night. It was all we had to do. It is bad for men to sit silent all day, only speaking to curse the sun, for then the wolf rages and breaks out. 'It broke forth in Pelrine, sitting digging- his knife in the thwart, and suddenly he sprang upon Gronard. He would have sprung upon me, just the same, if I 'had (happened to be next to him, for it was the wolf that sprang, not Pelrine, for Pelrine was always a good-hearted man. 'Gronard was taken at a disadvantage, but he was the strongest of us three, and grappled with Pelrine, and in the struggle the boat lurched, and both .fell over the side. I saw them go down, down, in the clear water, turning and twisting, and all I thought was, 'They do not feel the sun down there.' They never rose, for I saw what looked like long flashes of . white light dart at them, and I knew that the sharks that had kept us company so long had them for their sport at last. When I raised my head there was a ripple coming tast across the water. If Pelrine' s wolf had not broken out just then both he and Gronard would be aliye now. I went to the tiller, and . the sail filled, and the boat moved for the first time for two weeks. 'West was our course — anywhere west, to the great continent that reached for 2000 miles north and south. Merrily blew the wind, and in the eyening there were clouds overhead, and a black thunderstorm flashed and muttered in the distance. AM through, the night there was the pleasant riip aid gurgle of water. But the wolf gnawed still. 'Morning! and ahead of me I saw white water, but no land. It mattered little whether I died by the wolf pr the wave, and I kept straight on. As I got dosser- to the br-egikers I saw there was a low, sandy mound visible, with some low bushes growing on it, and to this I .steered.' !pbe north ern side lopked to. foe the smoothest, and I endea^ ?vored to make that side; for though there was no sea, the wind having been but light, the sweep and rush of the Pacific rollers was tremendous, and when they broke upon this submerged wall of coral and recoiled broken and shattered, the very air seemed to tremble. At the northernmost point of the islet the turmoil seemed less, though the rollers were as big; but the passage was deep enough to let them pass through and expend their fury in a sullen swirl over the flats beyond. 'As I approached I was caught in one pf the rollers and swept on with it, with great force acd fury. We mounted on the crest of it, and then fell with a rush that' made me feel sick. Next moment the boat was dashed on the beach, and I was flung /unhurt beside it. 'Then the roller swept back and .left us, the broken boat and myself, on the sand. 'If was a miserable little patch- of dry land in deed, and when L bad rested a little I commenced to examine ft, first ; directing my steps, to the low bushes' on1 the- highest part. I found it to be a ring1 of scrdb surrounding a depression filled with water. I crashed through the bushes and stoop ed to drink, scarcely daring to hope that it would be lEresh. It was, or at least' fairly so, for the spray fippm the breakers drifted over into it, I -drank, and the wolt was quiet for a bit, -wnile I Jay pp tjh/e.. sand and 'looked around. Aline of tossing white ran north, and -south— -the line I had passed through— but to the west was a still sea, twoken here and there in patches of shining foam, but mostly still, and pf a light, transaarent;,green color. Tie tid.e was. falling, and by midday tfcere wera bare si-pts pf coral showing.' I went dpwn anil searched for shellfish, pr anything left by the tidp. I fpiinfl what was better 'than ^gllr-plenty pf' the sea-slugs tnown as trepang. I soon had a quantity collected, and having the means of mak-. ijig'a fire, I spent the rest o5 t&e; flay in cooking anq eating; an4 again 43ie wolf pouched for a. time. That night I slept sound after the cramped space of the' boat, and' when the wolf clambrecl at day-r light I arose. It was a strange tniiig to be stand ing there alone on that 'patch of sand, with the nwll s*t +;i.^.1acc JiT-a'alr'arc: f)71 S1T1P. &id;£. that.lOOked far above me, as though when they fell they would overwhelm my' reifuge.' I fed on. the trepang, and passed the day idly resting, for now I had tamed the wolf' witjiin in£. I longed for my epmBanipns.; but they were in tie bellies of ti^e sharks. ? 'When darkness came' I lay dpwn and slept, but a-woks in .the'ipiddle pf the night, a.reamin'g that I 'heard' §irange sounds. I listened, and at first he'ar4 npifelig but the' *-oqm ^4 cra?^ 9? *be breakers; feut presentlr I heard law voices aad. the crunching tread of feet pn the poral sand. .1 leaj)t' to'-my feet, feut 6m£& see nothing.

'I hastily traversed the island., but saw nothing, only at times I heard the voices talking, and though I called I and called again, none answered me Itoen there was silence, and plainly $ heard the click and grind of steel meeting steej, £hfi teamp, and quickened breathiaig pf %Vfe cpgmbOit^iits; and still 1 saw npthing. ^Suddenly the clashing oasne quf-&fR;: gflfl gaai^s er as though there was a hptJyT^ntested rally, and fallowing it t^me a fall f-n- the sanf, and then a pry in a waman'-s TOjce, and, a peal p| msisieai lawghtjer.* T-herp was- law whisperiiig, and the steps' diepf g.way,' theayy an'S s^pWj'as thpfjigh they' ^Tied a toundefl., and tiieji tlfepe was np sound fe the~ thunder of the tireae,ss biUpws. 'I seams' felt frigfiteneA-I iiad been Jiving for too long' hand in hand wMfc deaffli. I felt curious, and if terrified at all it was more at the idea that it had been a fancy of my brain— that it was my. wits were failing me, for I knew well that lone liness serves some men thus. ? ? '4if -was quiet for the Bemainder.o? taie nigh,t, and in the morning there were no signs nor tracks of any penson but myself. Jbjow, aJthpugh I heard the voices, the tongue that thej spoke in was strange to me, but I thought it was Spanish, from the way that I had heard pld epimi»apj of mine talk together who w«re Spaniards. 'Next night the ghosts were there, again, and once more ^he duel, as I topk it, was fpugh$ on that solitary speck 'oi sand in the gpeat ppea^i; to the music of the surf. ' That was a strange, un real liffr-fty day~to pace -fte sandy shore ana listen to the waves, and talk to. myself-, pt ga«ier and cook the trepang that supjK- rted me; by nigai to h©ar the pranch' of Hhe sand under unseen feet, and tie quick clash of tine blades. But strange* still was to come. . 'I bethought ane, feom wfeat. mifi^maiap.n I has sathered1, that this re?f wai the g-eat reef that lay off flie coast of queienelanfl; aiid ftat inside, between it and the mainland, ships and steamers, 'were cpnstakay pasfing up. agd ^Bsn.

I would only have to kpep due west to come out somewhere on 'the edge of the frer quented passage. To this end I took to exploring the -reef westward as far as I coul,4 go during low tide.

I pushed on further and further by degrees, until I found many .casks still preserving their shape and outline, hiving something within that was of great weight. I fcreke one open, aad inside was tarnished metal so covered, with growth and slime that it was impossible to say what it was. After mqny efforts £ broke pff a portion of it to examine) at my leisure, it was a lump r of silver dollars; welded together by marine growth and diseplprfid by long submergence. . 'I sat aghast at the thought of all those casks there being filled with cain^-salver- coin-^aye, and why not some of them with gold? I stood ankle deep in the salt water' and looked around. A sea pf light and shadow, calm and glassy, of ever changing coler. Beyond the restless tossing wall of white froth and foam. I had wealth — all- 1 de -ivof! of it — in my grasp; and this was my domain. -s ever- man sp situated? When my turn came .j die, shgu.ld I join those ghosts of the isle, who must have been the men who sailed on this trea sury ship. There was blood on these coins, else why were they^here, why was that nightly, duel fought, what brought this ship so far south of her course? I returned to the island and cleaned the coins I held, scrubbed them with sand, and, picked them apart with the knife that Pelrine haa drop ped when he went overboard. They were Spanish dollars, dated 1624 and a few years later-. 'In successive journeys I examined some more of the casks, and found that one smaller one was full of gold, and doubtless there were more. It was better they should remain where they were, safer in every way, until I found a way out of my present position. Sueh a position in every way. With untold riches lying beneath a few feet of salt- water of no more value than the leagues af coral north and south of me. And if I escaped and gained my fellow-men, of what avail would be my treasure to an escaped convict, who might at any moment be seized and returned to tne living oeath I had fled from. My wealth alone wouldYlraw notice to me if I sought to enjoy4 it. At any rate, I determined to try and escape. I could decide afterwards about the treasure: Per haps I should be able to purchase my freedom with some pf it, t 'I determined to wait till the moon was full (it being then half), as it would enable me to make use of the low tide at all hours, and it would also allow me time to patch up my boat, which I com menced to overhaul that 'day. 'I slept soundly the first part of the night, and awoke as usual at the tread pf the. ghosts. The moon hung low in the west, and I saw — yes, saw that night the apparitions that haunted that tiny isle. The night was clear, save for some angry looking clouds in Oie east, and the setting moon shone with a spectral light over the still shallow waters of the reef. The tide was low, and the passage I had passed through, practicable for a well-manned boat, with a skilful steersman. 'But was it the ghosts I saw? Half a mile out* or less, lay a ship with lights both in her rigging and streaming through her ports. A boat lay off the edge of the island, and I thought I heard ano ther rowing in from the ship. 'I had no. fear, iand approached the group gathered on the saad. Tiey were talking seriously, and, though the language was the same as I had always heard, I could now understand every word as though it was my own. They took' no notice of me as I came near; I Vgppke to them, but received no an swer; I laid my hand on -me's arm, and I did not feel him. My sense of touch was dead, my voice was inaudible, my presence invisible. For the time being we had changed places, ajiri the ghosts were the substantial beings and I the impalpabre shade. 'There were five of them, all richly dressed in the fashion 'of 200 yeans ago.. One was an elderly man of dignified appearance, and the pther, who seemed his opponent, was a very -iaTi^-yvrp^ young gallant '- ??-... i . -- ' 'Before we meet Don Herr-era, and I send yo;ur soul to keep company with ; those of' all the traitors since Judas hung himself,'' said the eider man in a voice of deep hatei 'I would 'eay something that these gentlemen may remember epjjeernihg you. Tou, a trusted officer of his Majesty, have tanH pered with the marines of my ship. You tempted, them to mutiny, but your vile plot was discovered, and your dupes hung on the yardarm, where you, too, would have hung, King's officer though you be, and noble ( to boot,' but 'that I reserved you for my own hand. Tou, who came on my ship as an hon ored guest, -honored on-, account of your standing as my master's officer, although I knew you for a ruined profligate. You, in your greed for the gold and silver in yon ship, conspired against me, led weak men on to their death, and, above all, sought to dishonor me in the way. that only death will wipe out I would not slay you on my own . deck, for death by my hand only would suffice, but I yowed that the first dry laad we saw. should witness the death of one of us. This spot will, and we need not wait for daylight. I call -upon you all to hear that this man ia e perjured traitor, whom I greatly honor by descending to cross swords with him.' 'The young man answered not, only by an in solent smile, then tossed hie hat dpsrc, and drew his sword. 'During the tima the captain was speaking the other boat arrived at th.e beach, and two people left and came tp us, a priest and ft ^ovaan. They £tqpA ped close to. where I was standing, and I eiw t&p; most exquisite face illumined by the level moon th#t. I ever saw in 'my life.' Tie' prfeet was dressed in the soutane and broad-brimmed hat of his profes sion, 'and looked ill at ease, 'but his companioji flashed a, hpltj 'glance from her dark ey^s at'~the, younger combatant 'that at once told me the'guUty'eecret. and why the captain had not hujig Tjfin gjt th% yarf ann, bitit brought him.' tp thi« 'patch 'of sand to kilj him himself. !'*ipie fight commenced, w^-pily and cauti-qnsly. at first, but 'the two 'men soon warmeii to their work, and then I saw the murderous trick pf the young man. He was forcing the old man rojind, 'so that he should face the 'deceitfui glare of the getting mpon. Bit by bit he accomplished his opject; then' there was a quick,, ahasp inter- change^ and t*ie cap^ -tain fell, pierced through the body. ' 'BrayoV cri^ the woman, .standing by me, and she laughed' merrily. ? ' «I 'shuddered, *-nH the priest darted from her side, and knelt' beside ttie dying inan.

The gold- you pliotteol for «hall never be yours; the beauty you lushed for' shall be food for fishes. You snail not linger loag belhind me.' He fell 'back, as the edge of thf- ghostly yellow moon kisasd the water's edge, its dying- raya lighting up the spene of horror, the silent men, the recumbent figure, the dark-rqibed kneeling priest, holding on high the crucifix; the'white.-saiid gleaming out from, that great waste of -wateiC '^Suddenly a flaeSi - of lightaing, accompanied by a peel of thunder, made everyone etart.
