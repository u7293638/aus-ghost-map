NW in England the enow lies knee-deep near each door, And hard is the lot of the cottager poor, Though Christmas may bring him n share of good cheer And IIopo. hid him wait for a forthcoming year; In Australia the season' is pleasing and bright, And eorrowB and troubles are banished from sight, And wo hail with a smile old Christmas appear— Forerunner is he of a Happy New Year. What a conliast there ia between England and this! At Christmas how many old sports we oft miss, For those which in childhood were deemed very dear, Are sought for in vaip, they ne'er greet us here ; Still who, now ipng years have calmly swept by. Would change our fair land and its beautiful sky For a Chiislnias in Euglund encircled with snow, And the misery there which the pqor ever know I Who'd sit in the house, as tho wind and the rail) Came drifting ulqng all night by the pane, And in oach rude gust exciting their fears Hear the voices of dear ones, the dead of past years 1 Who'd labour to gain but the ghost of a meal, And hear with those trials which poor nien must fcol ? Not I, while Australia possesses good, cheer, . And Hope leads tho way in the coming New Tear. Quo. E. Lotao. Christmas, 1875.
