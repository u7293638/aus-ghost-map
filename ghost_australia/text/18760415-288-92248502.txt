But she refused to acknowledge that anything had happened to alarm her — plainly as I could detect it in her face. ?? v 'Somebody has been playing a trick on you, George,' she said. I made no reply. It was needles3 to say anything. - My poor mother was evi dently as -- far from being satisfied with her own shallow explanation, as I was. The carriage waited for us at ihe door. We set forth in silence on our drive home. -,;? ? ' The sketch-book lay open on my knee. My eyes were, fastened on it ; my mind was' absorbed' in recalling the moment when the apparition beckoned me into the summer-house, and spoke. Putting the .words and the writing together,- the conclusion was too plain to be mistaken The woman whom I had saved from drownine had: need of meagaih. : . And this was the same woman' who, in her own proper person, had not hesitated to seize the first opportunity of leaving the house in which we had been sheltered together— without ~ stopping to say one grateful :w*rd to the man who had pre served her from death ! Four days only had elapsed since she had left me, never, to all appearance, to see me again. And now,- the ghostly apparition; of her had returned, asiioja tried and trusted friend; had commanded, me to remember her and to go to her; and had provided against all possibility of my memory playing me false, by writing the words whieh invited me to meet her ' when the full moon shone on Saint Anthony's Well.' , What had happened in the interval;? What did the supernatural manner of her communication with me mean ? What ought my next course of action to be ? [ Mv mother roused me from mv reflec tions. She stretched out her hand, and suddenly closed the open book on my knee, as if the sight of the writing in it was unendurable to her. ' Why don't you speak to me, George ?' she said. ?.''
