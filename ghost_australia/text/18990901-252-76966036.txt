E ROSE. Lifting tne yuaint old casket's Hd, To while away an hour, Among the yellow papers hid I found a withered flower ; Its leaves were pressed with tender care, Its petals clung together, It breathed a fragrance faint and rare As ot the April weather. I knew not now it came my own I prayed it√§ giver pardon So long ago its bloom had grown In some forgotien garden ; But yet around its withered leaves Pathetic perfume lingers As if for some old days it grieves And soft, caressing fingers. 'Twas once a red and radiant rose, Deep tinged and fiery embered, But now a dream-perchance it knows Of passions unremembered. Whose hand caressed thee, withered one ? What snowy bosom bore thee, And whose the sigh that lived upon Sweet lips of scarlet o'er thee ? Ah, who can tell !-the romance blent With thee no tongue will sever Thou ghost of some dead sentiment ! I lay thee back for ever.
