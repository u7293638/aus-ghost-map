REGARDING the entertainment given by Professor Rice, the .liynelon Obsecrver, of November 1st, says:--Professor Rice gave his third performance of mind- reading and exposure of spiritualism to a large and ap preciative audience at the Mechanics' Hall last night. In the first part of the enter tainment the Professor astonished both old and young by the wonderful manner in which he discovered articles thought of. lie did not make a single failure, and has truly fulfilled the promises he made to prove him self a veritable mind- reader, and not the possessor of a clever trick, even describing a photograph of an unknown gentleman and a sceptic. In his exposure of spiritualism he was far better than on Thurs:lay evening, and the production of the ghost was so " weird-like" and of such a supernatural appearance that it caused an amount of excitement rarely witnessed withinthe walls of a hall of entertainment. When we state that whilst the ghost walks, the Professor is in full view of the audience, it becomes most puzzling. His ghostship was more himself than before, and although he caused more than one faint, was most affable, per mitting anyone who wished to shake hands with him. The ghost is of an uncertain weight, one moment weighing a ton, and the next but a pound. It is the de-simile of Terry's Ghost, now being exhibited in Mel bourne.
