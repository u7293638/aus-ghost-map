Early Closing. THUS the Queensland " Grazier " It fs now unlawful to get yo'ir hair cut in New South Wales after 7.30 p.m., ex cepting Saturdays, when the function can' be performed up to 10 o'clock. ; If how ever, you have entered the barber's shop, and after waiting your turn, you decide to get shaved as well,and the clock strikes ten between the two operations, then vou can't get shaved until Monday morning. This is the inference to be drawn from the new Early Closing Act. The good chem ist who dispenses the maximum of water ; and minimum of drugs muft " stash it" at 9 p.m., but if you feel unwell you can | get medicine up to 10 on Saturday. As cigars and beer are amongst the most ur- , gent necessities of life, those w,lio oblige j the public by dispensing these things can do so until 11 every night.. Oyster shops j and eating houses can keep open until the witching hour of 12, but if anyone dies then through . eating late suppers, they haven't the ghost of a chance to get a j 'coffin until well into the next day, as the jovial, undertaker has, by Act of Parlia ment, to put up his shutters at 11 prompt. I ~his new Act ought to make the occupa tion of a policeman very lively and inter esting.. People can direct a glass to the aperture between the nose and the chin -is the dark, but the undertaker who es says to'do overtime will have to use a hammer with an indiarubber face on it.
