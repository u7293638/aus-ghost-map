Whatarar bail luck came to him—and i»*»e*Meg«tk«r »u» •* propwtiw H bit £663-fortune —lie,accepted it witn out■* word of complaint. . When Glanders arose from his position upon the pole of the waggon, bis first opera tion was to pile a few sticks of wood upon the coals. In a little while there was a -blaze, which, after sputtering a moment, gave out considerable light. This illumination, or the sound of Glanders' footstep about the place, Apparently aroused some degree of life inside the waggon, for there iwas a slight movement, and then a childish voice, rattier petulant in its tone, said: " " The old man, I s'pose." "Shefc up!" responded another ,«ce, obviously that of a lad, "or youll get another larrupin'. Ef he's full, he's sassy." Glanders leaned against the tree, and all became quiet again.. For the second time since he had .arrived -upon this scene, hie fell; to thinking, and, as before, his reflections were so absorbing'that he lost all conscious^ ness of wbat was passing around him. He did hot even notice that the canvas flap of thewaggon was raised, and that two veiy big, blue eyes were peering cautiously through/the aperture thus formed. It was entirely without his knowledge that the owner of thoae curious eyesstole =oot of the waggon and crept slyly towards him. Not untiTshe spoke was he aware of her presence. "Where'sthe old man?" were the first words Glanders heard. They startled him slightly, and he looked earnestly into the young face that was upturned to his. Perhaps it was the flicker, ing of fche firelight that caused the quick shade that fell, across his face. But :it looked like-an expression of pain. The girl, annoyed at his silence, went on, impetuously: ■ ■ " Don't your hear? What is the matter of you 1 Where's the'old man ?" ■"Down the .-gulch," replied Glanders, slowly, and with some difficulty. "Oh;" 'said the {*irl, with an odd mixture of sarcasm-and curiosity. " He sent you up to say he was drunk, I s'pose ? Said lie wouldn't be home till he got good and; ready —rdidn't he ? .Told you to tell us to look sharp, or he'd lfckb»fch of us when be got home, I reckon—hey ?" " Does hebeat you, then f" asked Glanders, withja weakattempt at. evasion. uoes lie z . isow yon . just bet be does. Audl'ye got uiy opinion of abig loafer.that lieksa little gal like me, -what can't help herself. - .Some day he'll wake up the wrong outfit, and then he'll get put under the daisies with his boots on—you hear me !" Glanders xii(3 hear her, and he shuddered. ■ But he was straugly attracted by the big eyed^ rough-spoken little girl, who stood there looking bim in the face and ejecting her,words with an energy that would have been ludicrous under other circumstances. She was a slender child, perhaps 12 years old.' Her hair was curly and light, and it fell in 1 a tangled mass over her forehead and neck. : She was poorly clad, and her brown fe*t had-long been stranger? to the cramping influence^ of shoes. There was a touch of jsreatpity in Glanders' eyes as be looked at tbischild standing there in the firelight and regarding him fixedly. . ''Come here," be sjifd, after awhile; come'bere and talk with me. | waqt to ask you some*questions." " I'll do it," she declared, in ayoice from which the sharpness had all gone." "I don't know who you aws, bi|t J like yojj, though I can't tell w3)y. It ain't'cause you're hand-1 some—that's dead sure." Glanders paid no attention to this uncom plimentary allusion to his personal appear- j auce. W'th blip it was no time for idle voqis Qr. thoughts. " Tell me," he said, vheii the girl bad I settled herself on the ground in front of him, "do you fore the old man ?—are you fond fif him.M " Well," responded the girl, after a pame, " I can't say as Pd like to eat him. He'e too handy with the back of his fist te make me so awfjil dead in love with him." Glanders sighed, as though be felt relieved from some anxiety. "But, then," the girl went on, with childish frankness, "you can't quite hate a j man when he's the only purtectoryou've gob. Ugly as he ws^s, be put all the bread into my inoijth as evpr yenfc tfoerp, a#d Fye got to remember that. Sometimes tljpre wasn't much .of it, and sometimes it was mighty queer bread. But as a gen'ral thing he did the best he knowed how, and Say, what are you thinking about so bard ?' Glanders was just at that moment think ing he was about the darkest criminal in the world. To sare himself from possible destruction he bad killed a fellow-being— an act, I regret to say, which was not sufficiently infrequent in those days, and in that section, to call for any . special regrets upon its own account. But Glanders reflected that in deprivingthe -Missouri bully of his life, , he 1 had also taken away the only prop upon! \yfaich this helpless child leaned for support, j It wasp. Reflection which filled him at first with dismay and self-reppoach> then : with a certain definiteness of purpose. __" Sis," said he, after a moment, passing his hand over ber straying curls with a kind of rough tenderness that was nob without its element of magnetism ; " sis, ef thar was a man—mind ye, I don't say thar is a man— but ef thar one as come to you and says, says this m»u, ef so ^e as you two children ! Wapts a honje, bein' without q>ne, ye , can ' come and live along of nje, and though it aitj'fc a refined and ellyganfe abode—ef any man was to s»y this to ye, And your dad didn't par- ticular}y tgi^d, what would you Answer?" Tbc gifl looked fulljn his face.. " Answer ? Why, I'd collar the offer like chain-lightning—only," ahp .hesitated an instant—"only the old man ijever'fJ stand by and let me hare such a jgeod thing as that—never." "He'll nerer bother ye any more, my child," said danders. "Do ye feel *wy bad abput it ?" *' Bad ^' shfi ephqpd. " Yes. The old.man h#s beep tQj&r; as it were. - He was -killed, my child, and ; the man, w-hafc offers to take ye into into his home, is the ope as did ib." The young girl started $>?ck, and regarded Glanders wifcb a strange ejpressiop. lb' was not a looik of .repulsion, or anger, or fright; but rather a look <rfa8topl8hmej)fc.' presently, after peering into hjs eyes jtpr sqjpe little tune, she said : \- " Then l don't believe it was your fault. You ain't the kind of a m#p ft? 4o that sorb of thing 'thouta cause. - And as for tfte, i#i?» a-stonishin* be hasn't ketched it afore." Glanders took a deep breath, which sounded like a sigh' of.relief..

Well, what's to hinder now Having by some acute inental process con vinced himself that nothing was to hinder, ■Glanders went thoughtfully to bed * * * ♦ . . * > The soft'autumn days, gilded by the clear and' genial Colorado sun, melted slowly away into~$be crisp and vestal winter.' Then came the budding spring; the'lazy summer, and the blushing autumn again. So the weeks glided into months, and the months' closed into^ears,: until Squatters' Guloh, ashamed of its rough and uncouth name of other days, adopted the more exalted title of Clarion City, i In a tasteful cottage, far towards the outer edge of' the settlement, lived Mr. Thomas Glanders and the members of his family, who have heretofore been described in this veracious narrative. It was a pretty place, and it was marked here and there by I the unmistakable traces of a woman s presence. Neat white curtains hung in the window?, a hammock swung on the verandah, and a trailing vine grew up over the posts by the door One night, as the sun was climbing down across the western sky, the verandah was occupied by two young people. A strong, hearty young man was swinging ip the hammock, while sitting hoside him, idly moving t-lie network backward and forward, wasa lithe and graceful girl. She was blushing, .deeply, but not hanging her head. There was, indeed, in her large blue eyes a look of open frankness which I do not think is often found about the faces of young women when thev are discussing the sub ject which was at that moment occupying her attention. " There Is something which seems almoit like sacrilege about it, Robert," she said, with a touch remonstrance, in her voice. " I had grown to think you my brother in reality." " But you love me, Lucy! You have told me so." " What," she asked, presently, " would he think?' It was apparent that thc young man did »ot require a nipre definite descriptive term to understand wfoo was referred to. "He would scarcely object, Lucy. You know he loves both of us v$ry dP&riy;* .&nd;> his greatest happiness would be in making us happy." " True," replied Miss Lucy, thoughtfully! " But if—if he should rather we did not j seek this kind of happiness, Hobert—you know we owe him a very great deal! Our honje, pur rescqe froifx existence, that would have }eft us bo£b U)orp fcq foe pitied than if we were dead; our education—all were given us by him. We can scarcely dp anything that may bring him pain, Robert," The young man in the hammock was silent for a moment. " Tell me," he said,'in a little while, " why you suppose there is any reason that he will object f Miss Lucy's face assumed a deeper scarlet. " I—I—well, nothing. It is probably my imagination. " Will you-^sk him ?" Another pause. Then, a low voice: " Yes; I will ask him to-night. If he consents, Robert, I will do all that you have asked." " That's a dear, sweet Lucy !" exclaimed Robert, springing to his feet, and kissing her lips. " We shall be vepy happy." As ne strolled down the hill, Miss Lucy's eyes followed his retreating figure, sadly. When be was gone, she drew a long and slightly tremulous, breatb, and laid her head against the post. She still sat thus, -with her eyes bent upon the ground, when a heavy footfall aroused her attention. Mr. Thomas Glanders, returning from his office at the mouth of the Giant mine. - Not quite the Thomas Glanders we have known heretofore. His eyes were seyeqer now than they were of old, -and his tread had not that element of hesitation which formerly marked it. Thomas Glanders, mine-owner i and operator, with a pretty home, and; .the: benefits of solicitous female society,; was rather inclined to be an ornament to his sex. " Geed evenrn', Lncy," he said, kindly, as he drpw a chair qp tq her side, and seated ^himself so that thfc fplds of tier dress brushed against'his knees. "I met Robert as I came up the hilL A fine boy, that, Lucy. - I'm as proud of him as if I bad been his father;" J A moment of silence, during whichlMiss Lucy breathed, a trifle quickly.

Almost before the staid citizens of : Clarion) City were out in the streets, Mr,, Glanders" ana his bride bad-walked to the little chapel down in the ravine, and back again. . He had noticed that Lucy was veiy $xb1* that morning, and that there w^rc long,, deep lines in her face. Clearly she badriot slept. But Mr. Glanders' attributed'Mis fact to a weakness of' the Ee*. and ImaginfeS' that in a little time it would , soon wear away. Robert did not pome home during the nigKt, having gone a twenty-mile ride to visit some friends. Mr. Glanders had wished to defer th» quiet ceremony until his; arrivali- but Lucy had refused with a feverish haste,, whichj her companion setdown to. the scpire'. tof diffidence.' ' It vrassbnie hours after the marriage, that Mr. Glanders, falling to stir up any enthusiasm -in tucy's breaBb-regard-: ing the various topics of conversation, kissed her tenderly, and strolled. .out for J a walk among the trees. - ■ | " She's better alone for a timei'V. the muttered, apblogetioaAlyj to himself. '' When I come back in half-an hour she'll be'as bright and cheery as.ever."'1' s . lor a long time after he ,went away, Ludy sat looking blankly:at Jtbevwall,< Then she arose and walked out upon ..the : porch, and. stood looking down the hili, where she bal last seen Robert , pass away.In a-few: moments she became conscious that someone was near her. It was Robert,. white as a ghost, .and trembling nervously. ' Shie' looked into bib face, but could hot speak. There vrasadeept' pathetio inquiry in her eyes;' ■ which spoke; more plainly than Words. " 5fes, I know," he said, in estrange and worried fashion. I heatd it sfe I came up the street. I shall not reproach1 you, iLucy,. for, if he asked yombomarry iini, it was the only return you could make for Jill his' more than fatherly kindness," , There wasi footstfep riob far away,' but it was not noted by the two young people. «?I have come, Lucy," cdpfciriiied Robert, in the same hurried and unnatural fashion, " to say, good-bye.". "Robert P'she gasped, "do nek—do not ge away." " 1 must," he said, ,-in a . strange ;tahe, regaining a part of his own force as he saw a touch' of weakness in the woman' he' lOiyed. " There is no other'course. ",!$t would bjeak my heart to stay here and see you the "wife of another. It would wear out my grati tude, my manhood.

We l°T® each other too deatly te> have it otherwise.13 • She was silent. "G6od-bye, Lucy," he said, more quietly, taking her hand. " Good-bye," she whispered, in a choking voice.
