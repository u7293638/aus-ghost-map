A CLAIM TO INSPIRATIOY. TO TIH EDITOR. SIR,-I noticed that at the laying of the foundation stone of the "barracks" of the "Salvation Army" in Launceston the other day "Marshal" Booth claimed "the inspiration of Almighty God and of the Holy Ghost" as the source of the remark able organisation of the "Army." This is a bold claim for what is to some of us the great stumbling block of the move ment originated by the "General," and it is due to your readers to remind them that it is the claim of most of the human in ventions in religion. The Pope claims con tinuous inspiration to render him infal lible in all his official acts. Joe Smith claimed to have found certain plates in a hill in the State of New York, and.to have been inspired to translate than to make the Book of Mormon. Mahomet claimed to have received in his cave revelations from Heaven to constitute the Koran. Curious readings, both these, in their travestying of the Great Book of the Ages; with which, in our hands, all religious doctrines, practices, and organisations may be infal libly tested by all the honest and rational; and no need is there of any further revela tion. To seek to reach the outcast and to raise the fallen is, beyond dodbt, a divine work; but the means, the organisation, on the model of a military despotism, with the vain display of colours, and drums, and trumpets, and uniforms, and titles, and the whole jargon of mihtary terms, together with a wholesale and retail commercial enterprise linked in with it, is a very doubtful thing to claim inspiration for, i.e. from Heaven, so some of your readers think.-Yours, etc., J.
