Hilary's Husband* Hilaby stood leaning against a rugged old oak just outside the farm-house gate, watching her lover as he drove' away, from her forever. It was a lonely road ; there were neither neighbors nor passers-by to peer curiously into her faoe. and Aaron never once looked round as he went; she need not have pregaed backthe tears so resolutely. But she stood perfectly calm and still. lookfiig fixedly dowii the road alfter the retreating, wheds, though filing as if she were watching a hearse tha't bore sway her heart to burial ih some far-away graveyard beyond reach of tears. - When theTlast flutter of dust had laid itself in the road behind the gig, like a Borrow momentarily lulled io sleep, but ready to start into life at memory's first breath,'the girl raised her clasped hands above her head, ahdtilosed her eyes tightly as if to shut out the-vision of the long-*-dull yetirs to come, stretching themselves aimlessly into the distance^ empty, loveless, and hard like the blank road before her.. Then she turned and walked steadily into the house, and np the narrow Btairs into her aunt's room, and sat down by the bed, folding her slender hands in her lap, and looking down at the invalid with tired grey eyes that seemed Buddenly to have discovered tbe end of all things, and to know that henoeforth they must always look back instead of forward. The paralytic neither saw nor heard when Hilary came in. She lay as she had lain these many months,—past seeing, past hearing,-past suffering, yet living still, though as utterly dead to her old life as had the Beguiesait in pacealready^ been written in l ters of marble above her. For a long time Hilary sat by the bedside, absolutely motionless, save when she- -'mechanically leaned forward to bru^h -a fly from frer aunt's brow, or smo oth- away a creates in-the counterpane, or straighten" some Bmall crookedness that unconsciously- arrested her eye. One's outward senses are never so peculiarly alive to trifles as when a-great crisis of fate holds all the spirit spell-beund. So now the various consecutive sounds of every-day farm- life struck sharply through to Hilary's brain, and; she rose obediently from her seat at the firat stroke of the bell ringing in the men from the fields to their evening meal. She lingered a moment before going down, to look curiously at herself in the glass. No; this change that had eome was aU in her life—not in herself. There were no wrinkles amid the faint horizontal lines that crossed her forehead, no hollows in the ™ th 'P a . 1 , 6 d?? 6^. no faded threads in the blonde braids that covered her head in such profusion. She looked the same now as when she had run down so blithely to bid her lover welcome only to hour before. She pressed her thin, sweet hps together, and shook her head is if to fence off memory, and:ihen slowly descended to the dining-room, where Farmer Perkins and his wife, with whom-she and her aunt had boarded ever since she could remember, were already seated at the table, which was set for four, and had that air of elaboration*abbHt it whiob-tablea, like people, put on for an expeoted guest. »Why, where's Aaron ?" asked Mrs. Perkins, in evident disappointment. "I made sure he;would stay; and opened a jar of my best strawberries, though young men are that ignorant, I believe he'd all as eoon have had orab-apples." "He couldn't wait," Hilary answered quietly, as she took her plaoe ana busied herself with h6r napkin. " He had a great deal to do." Farmer Perkins raised his bushy brows without lifting his eyes from his plate. " Had he, then ?" he said, with good-humored doubt. " I'd be' glad of the day when Aaron Johns had a deal to do." "Yes," answered Hilary, lifting her head •with a desperate feeling that it was best to get through the wont at once. " He had so little tithe. He leaves to-night for the Weist —for Omaha." "What I" : , The exclamation came from Mrs. Perkins. Her husband merely suspended his operations with the waffles, and stared at Hilary sideways. 4 4 Yes," she continued, in a perfectly quiet, unemotional voice. " He said he had; failed long anpngh here, and ha was -sure to get a start'there. It's a poor opening a young lawyer has in a little country town like this, he Bays." " Bight enough there," assented the farmer, resuming his knife and fork and appetite. " We ain't bo idiahdnest about here yet, that i many folks can earn -a living swearing blaot is white for ns. He'll do a sight better inihat lying country where he's going. He's a smart enough fellow too, is Aaron. Give him a start, and he'll not come in with tbe hindmost.!' Well, I am took baok," said Mrs. Perkins slowly, quite forgetting to spread her bread in her surprise, absently eating tbe butter in little lumps off the end. of her knife, as if testing it. "Ican'tBeem to ,settle down to it. Who'd have thought he'd go. off so sudden, or all the world like arocket before the match s eet jfco it l And when is he coming back^tq etch you, Hilary ? " ' ' •" " He is not coming back." "Notevef?" ^ r . "No; m . . , . ; The«al:answered steadily enough,^finf fier eyas feu. 7 • ; " ' . "Hilajry," said Mr^Perkihs solemoiy^ieaaing forward to look afher, wi&_both elbo^ra on the table, " you don't mean^you've b^n keeping oompany with Aaron Johns th& twelvemonih back, tor him to give yon the go-bye like that in ttie end.?" . -. . ; \- " SBwre isn't any go-by aboirf it.'^ ieplied Hilaij quickly, a hot brimson ^ot coming to each-«heek.

"Four hands is always totter Jhan two at a job, and there's nothing like pioking over currants for diverting the mind.; It's the most distracting I know pf.

I'll ietoh 'em right ip." / They, all left the table together; and ihe farmer took up hia straw hat irom the chair where he had thrown it upon entering, then turneclDack awkwardly to lay a heavy hand on Hilary's shoulder. "Hilary, my girl," he said kindly, " you're made pf pretty decent jstuff. You'll do." By ten o'clook that night all apparent life had erased in the little farm-house. Save. in Hilary's room every light was out, and all but she w§m sunk in the dreamless sleep of the hard-working. But Hilary still eat by v her aunt's, bed, lost in thought and taking no note of time, - At last she rose, with the look of one who les eome to some solemn decision, and, goinjgjto a tall ohest of drawers thai stood Bquare and ungainly in a coraer- of the rooid under (he sloping roof, she took out a white muslift dress that had lain there undisturbed since her first and only ball, and which was still very fresh arid hnruiripled. She shook it carefully out of its creases and laid it by while she sought lor various other dainty articles of apparel,—her one pair of silk stockings and kid .slippers, a white ribbon sash, a bit of rare «ld lace,—and then, tftiring ofi her plain stuff dress, she proceeded fto make ja freah -toilette from head to foot, even rebraiding her heavy masses of hair and arranging them in a way that suited her better.- She stood at last fully dressed in tbe soft white muslin,—very fair, very bride-like. But something was still wanting. Brides wear veils. Ah, she must borrow hers. That little Shetland shawl, soft as spun silk and cobwebby-as lace, which had been hei*aunt's pride in bygone days,—what could better fit tier need? With trembling hands she:unfolded it from its.; many wrappers and threw it over her head, fastening it deftly here and there to her shining braids, It fell fleecy and light over her shoulders and floated far down over her dress. It was the finishing touch. Surely all was complete nOW. But ho; did ever bride go to the. tdtar without a flower upon her ? Hilary hesitated an instant, then gathering her white skirts closely around her, with her long veil flung over one bare white arm, down she went, noiselessly as Ihe ghost she seemed, to tbe tiny hall below. She listened anxiously. Had the creaking wooden stairs betrayed her ? There was not a Bound IndoorB save the old clock ticking weariecUy in the comer, where it stood .like a Bentinel at his post waiting to be relieved. Another step g t c - mfshcfke«sa h m c and she reached the front dob*, slid back the boh, lifted the latch, and passed out into the n darkanddewy garden. Her heart beat high as she stole softly down between the shrubberies. There was but moonlight -enough to make the darkness' visible, and to show herself a misty white spot npon it, strange in the midst of strangeness, as if a cloud had fallen to earth' and gathered a semblance of human shape in falling; the rustling of the leaves waB as so many faint spirit-voices asking in frightened' whispers who and what she was that had thus eome among them; the tan felt cold and unaccustomed beneath her feet; the air was damp arid heavy with too sweet sdors ; bats flew low across her pathway with ugly, flaji- P m 8 wings, and her ears tinged with a thottheard before. It was a gruesome hour for 'itgirl to he out alone, but she kept steadily on her way, down between the straight, stiff flower-beds. The lilacs were long since done blooming, and the lilieB and the syringa'S too. She thought of these last with a sigh; they would have been quite like orange- blossoms. There were plenty of white balsams and white phlox and candytuft too, on either side; but she passed them swiftly by, never pausing till she oame to the very end of the garden where awhite rose-bush, laden withhalf-open buds, seemed to have bloomed purposely for this hour. r - Hilary broke ofi the flowers with hasty hands,—a few for her breast and a few for her hair were all she needed,—and then, with an exultant thrill at her heart, she turned and retraced her steps through the Jtfol moonlight and the mysterious shadows, that seemed to turn when she jdid, and to chase her with glidiflg, du4|ky footsteps,,^ though, loath to let so fair a vision go. . But the house was reached in safety, the: doors realosed upon that strangely unfamiliar world of night outpide^ and Hilary stood once more in her room before the glass, smiling a sad little smile of triumph at berself. Yes, it was-all complete now. There laoked nothing save only some one to say that she was fair. She glanced shyly at her own image, ashamed of her involuntary pleasures in its sweetness, J»nd taming away went to the bed to bend down over the poor invalid, who was no farther .from her now sleeping than waking, and s$|tytlassed iter forehead. • ,• ..-.- ."Aunt," she murmuredbeneatbher breathy '^IiakiB you as my witness.'!:.

Hilary listened withne deepening bl no quickening of her even pulses,' bbt a curious' sense that Aaron had committed a crime,- and that she was responsible for his Bin.- But even that feeling wore gg soon, and Aaron remained her dreaibhusband still, her secret counsel in emergencies, her daily director and helper and comforter, while she tried to think of him as keeping pace with time, and to imagine iam every year with hair a little more gray, and «yes a little less blue, and cheeks a little more sunken and furrowed.
