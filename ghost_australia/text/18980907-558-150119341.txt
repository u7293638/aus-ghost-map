A CANNIBALISTIC FEAST . The Sydney correspondent of the 41 Age,'" writes Another story of a ship's crew being massacred was brought to Sydney on Saturday last by tbe steamer Moresby, which arrived from New New Guinea and island ports. About a month ago the 16 ton cutter Sea Ghost was despatched by tbe owner Mr Tindnl, of Shortland Island, on a trading cruise in tno Solomon Group. The cutter was under the command of Captain Coloborn, and flew the German flag. When approach ing Nusa Island, near Bougainville, the captain was in the rigging, on the lookout for reefs, and did not notice that the natives, who had put out 111 canoes as usual, had clambered on board in largo numbers. Capt: Coloborn was descending the rigging when the native^ made the attack. He was sur prised. and, bring nr.armpd, was soon but chered. Four of the native crew made a desperate fight : but the odds against thom were great, and they were overcome. The other two natives of the crew were taken prisoners, but afterwards managed it escape. Meanwhile, the Sea Ghost had been run ashore, and having Veen looted of even-thing valuable, was subsequently destroyed. The captain's body was thrown overboard, but the remains of the four murdered natives were taken t Â» the village for a cauuibatistie feast. The German war ship Falke will in due course proceed to the island to punish the natives.
