The Advertiser FRIDAY, AUGUST 1, 1879. If the man who makes two blades of gras grow where but one grew before be a benefactor of his species, how much greater will be the blessings conferred on his kind by the man who discovers the means of conquering that destructive disease in wheat known as red rust. Such a discovery would virtually mean in some seasons the reaping of a fair average crop off land which other wise would yidd little more than straw* and in all seasons would add materially to the returns of the agriculturists. The im portance of the subject has long been felt, and much thought has been given to it. It | has engaged the attention of individuals and Associations, and the JEtoyal Agricul tural p_d Hort____r_ Society has urge! | the Up vernment, though unsuccessfully, to offer k reward for a remedy. Why a re [ ward j?hould not be offered for the discovery of a remedy fortius scourge it is difficult Ito understand. If it ia believed by the Government, as it is by many pesple, that no protection from its ravages can be foand, there could be no valid ground for object ing to offering campensafion for a preven tive or a cure; and if the Ministry hold the view that a .means of averting its ravages is within human reach, there is quite as much reason why a reward should be offered for ita discovery as there is for ' giving a bonus for finding coal; for tiie accomplishment of either of these objects would add veI _ considerably to the wealth of the colony. However, as. the Govern ment has decided not to offer a reward, the Society are endeavoring to accomplish something in this direction without its aid At the last monthly meeting of the Roval Agricultural and Horticultural Society papers were read on this eubjee^ and among them oneby M. £. Bourbaud, who affirms that the whole secret of conquering this enemy to the furner lies in altera tion in the methods of Cultivation- Of course the whole value of M. Bom-baud's suggestions depends on the correctness of. his premises, and these equally of course will be objected to by many. The origin and nature of rust are questions about which; a diversity of opinion atill existss and although Mons. Bourbaud puts aside the theory of atmospheric changes as the cause 'of nut as one which "cannot be supported or scientifically explained by anj valuable argument," there will still be believers in the atmospheric influence ! theory} M. Bourbaud _ assertions to ths contrary notwithstanding. The remedies he : suggests, however, .can nearly all be fried on a fcmall scale as experiments by. the | farmers, wherever situated, without in | volving any very great amount of trouble, so that if tbe results attained do [ sot equal the expectations of the persons making the experiments, they will have no reason for bitter complaints about time aad money I wasted. M. Bourbaud starts with the opinion that red rust almost entirely dependp npon the compactness and plasticity of the ground, and that the intensity of its attacks will always be found to be in pro portion to the impermeability of the arable soil to the air, as well as to deficiency of knowledge in farming. The natural im permeability ef the soil is often, M. Bour baud believes, increased by rolling, a pro - cess which _L Bourbaud strongly objects to, especially if undertaken at a time when the soil is wet; as the rains have a tendency to beat down the soil; and when to this agency is added the compressing influence of the roller the soil becomes so compact that it is almost impossible for the air to penetrate it; and air bung a great essential in tte proper de velopment of the plant it is thus deprived of an importent factor necessary to a health ful growth. . _T_a notion will _jt commend itself taj a_y practical' farmer. ~-The roller is absolutely necessary where the-eeythe er - the mowi-g- iuaehiPfl is to be nsed, and; most practic— agriculturists believe that rolling has a directly beneficial influence en the plant. The. soil will not be. too much'. compressed unless the roller is too heavy. _he general principle laid down by M- Bourbaud as to the necessity of the soil being accessible to the air will not be dis-" puted. " Without the assistance of air sili cates and phosphates remain to a great ex tent in an insoluble state, and the work of J assimilation is not properly performed. Warm weather and moisture, however, cause the plant to grow rapidly and look well, but the promise of a good yield which the fine-looking plant holds out to the de lighted farmer is -ften a fallacious one* Not baying taken from the ami those elements which are requisite to the produc tion of a vigorous and sound plant, the sap, though abundant, is not of the character to form a pood head and to bring that head to maturity. The plant is weak, and being frequently too thickly sown the air does not circulate around it so freely iaa is desirable." Under these conditions M. Bourbaud asserts "fermen tation takes place in the confined and vitiated atmosphere, which increases ac cording to the heat of the sun and the state of the weather." Under the influence of this fermentation "the utilised sap ofthe tender stem is dilated; the stalk swells; its atreagthleaa -ieeae _ eoftet_e_r-disa<ggT-> gated,and finally cracks to .__. way to - tte mucilagenoua juice it contains. The fate oF J_j6 wheat plant is now .certain; throughout the exuded juice Jvery B_n appear, numerous microscopic globules, representing so many ferments, which, after having performed the work of fermentation, leave an-oxydated residue, which is .ne ~myce?d_-~khdwn aa red rust. And he adduces as one proof of hia theory that rust is Caused by the plant bot ha__g. |afcmi lated the necessary mineraland nitrogenous matten, the case of the former, who finding wheat field attacked mth. mat, consolea himself with the reflection that at least he will have an exceUent yield of hay. But when lie has cat it, what is the result? He often finds that in drying the weight of the erop is reduced by one* half, or even two-thuds, thus showing the aqueous nature of t_e«p which the plant contained. And the return, besides being poor in quantity 1s found to be poor in qua lity also, through lacking tte essential ele ments for forming a nutritious diet. The core for these evils which is advo cated by M. Bourbaud is making the lani lighter and more permeable, and providing for a more thorough aeration of the wheat field?. There are different ways of making land lighter and more permeable, and the one favored by M. Bom-baud is the use of aand, and he gives the preference to aea sand because it is richer in carbonate of lime and contains decom posed organic matters. Of this there is aa abundance to be fonnd along a great part of our coast line, and farmers living- within easy distance of the sea who have a com pact soil to work, in making the ex periment would only have to consider . the cost. The mode of application which M. Bourfyud recommends is shown by what he wishes the Committee of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society to do. He asks as a favor that three or four experiments be made under its superin tendence on lands which have been most affected by rust, and it will be seen that the plan on which he recommends that the experiments should be conducted provides for thorough aeration bott above and below ground, die land to be equally covered with a layer of sea sand from two to three inches thickjand to be ploughed to a depth of six or eeven inches after sowing; har rowing td be done, and then another light layer of about a quarter of an inch to be put cm the soil, but no rolling to be done. Tracks a foot and a half wide and from six to eight yards apart to _e left; these tracks to run in a north and south direction. Whether the Society will undertake this work is doubtful, but M. Bourbaud puts forward another programme for experi menting, which might be easily tried by many of our farmers, and the results of which would, if communicated to the Society, probably prove of great benefit to the country generally; and, as M. Bour baud intends to make a number of experi ments and analyses during tte coining season to enable him to demonstrate and explain the physical conditions of the wheat plant at all stages of the disease, and to show the formation, development, and action of red rust, it would be well if the fanners who are in a position to give his recommendations a trial would do so, as their returns might prove of great value, and would strengthen the hands of one who -evidently takes a deep interest in their prosperity and that of the colony generally. The following quotation from M. Bour baud's paper gives full particulars of what he wishes to be done:— . "The following are the directions for experi ments ttatXwould strongly advise every farmer; having at heart tte progress of agriculture in South Austraiis, to give a trial this season (before the 15th of Angust). .These Soar ex periments should be made in four parallel beds 16 feet long by 5 feet wide each, separated by tracks of S feet in lueadlli, and if possible having tteir direction from north to sonth. "Nol 1 bed shall be ploughed from eight to nine inches deep, sown a* t^ha rate of IJ bushels to tte aae, harrowed aad rolled, as usually «*_N_ 2 had, tte _-_bs_ be .novated with a layer of aea sand or sandy gravelly matters from disaggregated crystalline rocks two inches deep, ploughed _t tte same depth as No. 1, sown at the rate of one bushel to the acre, harrowed, and then aea sand or sandy matters shall be spread all over Bim bed in sufficient quantity, and only to slightly cover tte soil about a third of an inch; norolling shall be done. "N0.3 bed shall be ploughed from eight to nine indies deep, sown at the rate of oue bushel ta the aere, and carefully harrowed; no rolling to be done. "No. 4 bed shall be ploughed from eight to nine inches deep, properly harrowed, aud sown in drills from six to seven inches apart, at the rate of three-quarter bushel to the acre, and then each farrow shall be covered witt aboat a third of an inch of sea sand or sandy matters, and no rolling be applied. " The four beds to be sown with the Bam s kind of wheat, and the seeds to be used for each bed shall be carefully weighed before sowing. Weekly observations should be taken to notice tbe differences in growing of each __d, and con ditien of health of the plants at all periods o' their vegetation; a memomndom be kept; and at last, after having exactly and separately weighed tte crop of eaeh experiment, a full repprt ttould be sent to the Boyal Agriculturel Society." It is unfortunate that these suggestions came "so late in the season, as the proper seed time has passed, and what is wanted is to see how wheat, all planted at the right time of the year, will thrive under __ch of these methods of cultivation. Pro bably through late eowing'not one of the beds would yield wall, _ind in that case the experiments would -prove unsatisfactory through want of _eing fairly tested. Oub. special attention has been called to the <eaee of George Plumridge, who was charged at the Police Court on Friday last with stealing a carriage lamp, and being brought I op on remand tiro days after, was acquitted. Mr. Plumridge, in a letter to the Register, complains that he waa arrested ou a trum pery charge, preferred by a half-caste boy; that he wss remanded and refused bail; that his house was searched; that his cart load of vegetables was kept by the police till the goods were spoiled; and t_at£the boy, who is tbe only person from whom he can obtain redress, is not to be found. Our contemporary, in publishing this letter, supported it by a -leader taking tiie seme view of the subject. Ith only due to tbe police to say that they give sn entirely different account of the affair, and not merely by tiieir statements, hut by documentary evidence, show that Plumridge bas not merely in his account omitted material facts, but has made asser tions that an absolutely untrue. The charge was preferred by John Antony, a young man apparently nineteen or twenty years of age, in tbe employ of Mr. Lam bert, a well-known market gardener; and another young man who had previously been in the ser. pe of tiu, same -person identified ?t__ •__mpr ft-r_c.ua-. wm ' """ _n-^#.:ipyi_j: A^a^,fAvi7(AA?tc li before the -police Court during, .fhe ' same forenoon, when the informant said ha ** missed his lamp at _F_—> on the evsjriqg of the l4th July, and aaw it on-U_i prisoner's * cart at 4.30 on the following morning.' The Other young man, Jamea Bariey, gave evV A.. detice, and swore to the.__ap_B__r.J_ae-- > bert'a. Here was a pretty condo?iye«_s. ,'' * It was rebutted two days afterwards, _e .'" ______ bringing witnesses to proro^^u. ; ' alitri, and that the lamp was his; but it - would have beep improper to dismiss it in:;. F the absence of this rebutting evidence. It ' -. does _ot appear that Phunridge asked f_r bail at the Police Court. If Tbe did sot it'.'' . would have beea unreasonable to expect the - pc?oe to take bail; if he did make audi an application to Mr. Beddoms unsuccessfully . * : it would have been unjustifiable for tha police to grant what the magistrate had re fused. The constables were bound to arrest the accused, who was unknown to them, npoto. a distinct charge' of felony, and they state that before doing so they cautioned tha informant several times to be careful. It is not true ttat the informant, Antony, cannot be found, for be ia in the regular employ of Mr. Lambert. The vegetables were purchased in the morning and taken by the police to Plomridg?. house the same day. The honse was searched, be cause the case seemed dear against 'the accused, and the police had, they say, re ceived numerous reports of thefts of lamps, coats,and other articles at the' E____d ' Market. There is no doubt of Mr. 1 .umridge _ innocence, but the _ase did __fc present that aspect on the 16_ July. He has sustained inconvenience, loss, aad annoyance, and so far deserves sympathy; but all citizens, however honest and re spectable, an liable to have undeserved charges brought against ttem, and the constables cannot fairly be held responsible for the blunders of other people. In thi* case the police Lave only acted within the strict limits of their doty. The Supreme Court will sit in Banco this morning at the usual time.

" A dastardly attempt to throw a train off the rails appears," says the Border Watck, ** to have been made on Monday afternoon, July 28, on the Meant Gambier and Bivoli Bay line. Mr. Higinbo——i, C.8., accompanied by Mr. B. Stewart, engineer of the line, Mr. H.Smith, and Me. MaeNamara, inspector of platelaying, left Mount Gambier that morning by a special train to go down the line towards Millio__ for the purpose of inspection. Whilst returning, about 4 o'clock, when about I_§ miles distant' from the Mount, the brake guard (as the engine was running backwards) oame in con tact with some object that lay across the rails. The obstruction was observed some dis tance ahead, before the collision, but iu the dim light waa taken for a magpie. A heavy jerk was the result of the contact, but tha obstruction was turned aside by the guard before the wheels readied it, otherwise the re sult might have been more serious. The train was not stopped for an examination of the obstruction, but it is believed to have been a piece of rait or some other block of iron, aad that it was maliciously placed 03 the rails for the purpose of throwing the train off. Oa arrival at the Station it wss found that t!ie guard was considerably dented by tbe collision. Corporal FWd went down the line yesterday morning by Hr. Higinbothatu _ special train to make enquiries into the matter. We were in formed last night that nothing could be found near tbe line where the affair occurred. It was doubtless removed during the night." A trial was lately made at Ipswich, in England, of a patent automatic railway brake, the invention of Mr. SuUivan, M_P. "Tbe arrangement is," says the Bradford Observer, u especially adapted for application to railway carriages which are already fitted with the ordinary hand brake. To the end of the ordinary brake handle a weight is attached, which by means of a chain and pulley is connected with tiie preceding truck or engine, and is thos raised when the train advances, but the moment the engineer shuts off steam the weight falls. If the stoppage is sharp tiie weight falls as far as the lever will allow, and the brake is fully put on; if the stoppage is gentle the weight falls dowly, and is caught and suspended by a stop-catch, so that the wheels are but slightly acted on by the brake, and the engineer can back the train. This stop-catch is so adjusted that if the brakes have been automatically put on, and the train stopped, the engine-driver by advancing the train a few feet can raise the -takes snd drop them into the stopwatch. Previous to backing six waggons belonging' to tiie Midland Company, which had been fitted with the brakes, the invention was repeatedly tested, and the result was very satis factory. Tbe stoppages were made in a short space, and with much steadiness. As esch truok fitted with this brake ia complete and inde pendent, it ean be used with other railway stock whenever it is necessary te do so. These brakes can be fitted to railway waggons at about one-tenth the cost of an air-brake." The following Goolwa notes are from tbe Southern Argus of July 31:—''The Queen of the South left here last Tuesday week for Port Adelaide, but owing to the very heavy weather and the shallow water on the bar she had to lie at the mouth all the week waiting far a chance. Sbe looks almost new, having had a gaod painting up in the meantime. She came back to Goolwa on Saturday afternoon, and went out on Monday morning. The steamer Jupiter left here on Saturday for the Darling with a load. The Cumberoona left the same day. She is going to load at the North- West Bend. The steamer Ariel left the same day. There is not much freight offering; boats are leaving here half loaded. The steamer Albury sails on Wednesday for Wil cannia and Bourke. The steamer Cadell arrived at Goolwa last Thursday night from the Darling, and the Cumberoona the same day. Captain Johnston's new barge will be ready to launch next Monday. Tne steamer Jane Eliza will be ready for her trial trip next week. Sbe is now splendidly fitted up for pas sengers. The steamer Enterprise arrived from Morgan on Friday; she is going through the Mouth this week to Port Adelaide. The steamer Ellen left Goolwa yesterday for a load of fire wood, and is afterwards going outside to Port Pirie. The steamer Maranoa is ready, to come off the slip as soon as the tide rises. The sailing boats are getting ready for the regatta, and there are going to be some first-class boats from Port Adelaide here on that occasion too. List of steamers lying at Goolwa:—Cadell, Ellen, Tyro, Wentworth, Jane Eliza, Albury, Blanche, Kennedy, Enterprise, and Maranoa. Barges— Unknown, Union, Gertrude, Isabel, Macintyre, Morning Star, J. H. P., Barwon, Hume, and Darling. Schooners—Water Lily and White Cloud." The half-yearly meeting of the Glenelg Bathing Company "was held at the Company's Office, Morialta Chambers, Victoria-square, on Thnnday, J«dy __ There was an attendance of shareholders representing 3,529 shares. Mr. W. B. WigleyJ (Ohairman of Directors) occu pied tiie chair. The Director, report and balance-sheet showed that the returns for the half-year exceeded the expenditure by £288 17_2d_, which had -i_inced t__e bank overdraft to .£768 9s. 2d. The receipts for the half-year ending 30th June, 1878, amounted to £264 4s lOd., and far the same period in 1878 they -were £516 9s. 2d. Tbe Chairman remarked that at the last half-yearly meeting it was suggested that the Company ahould wind up, but he was glad to be able to state that affairs were now in a mare satisfactory state. Tbe receipts during the half-year were ■ considerably more than during the correspond ing period of 1878, and the working expenses bad been greatly reduced. In answer to a ques tion as to what this state of things might be attributed to, the Chairman said it was owing to improved management. When the new rail way line to Glenelg was crastructed the Company would be able to make better terms with one of the Companies for the issue of bathing tickets than in the ab sence of competition they were able to do. The report and balance-sheet were adopted. The Cbsirman mentioned that the baths were now being managed by the widow of tba lata Manager, snd her conduct of the establish cent was perfectly satisfactory. Tbe retiring Directors, Messrs. Cornish and Wadham, were re- elected, and Mr. W. 3. Douglas was again appointed Auditor. We have received the Australian Chris tian Pioneer and Truth and Progress for August. From the latter we make the following extract: —The Rev. S. Green and Dean Russell have been rivalling each other in the qualities of "sweetness and light.'' Mr. Green is reported thus:—"The alleged breaking away from the Church of England [on the part of Ritualists] and departure from Protestant doctrines he must most emphatically deny, and he would remind them that it was a sin to go to any schismatical place of worship; it was as much a sin for a Churchman to go to a Wesleyan, Congregational, or any other nonconformist church, as to the Roman Catholic Church. It was an act of schism—a breaking-away from the mother Church, and an encourage ment to disseverance.'' We can imagine the jovial cleric of the Port relieving himself by that utterance without any dis turbance to his own equanimity or that of any one else. But it is altogether different with the keen, studied, persistent repetition of balanced epithets by Dean Russell in his sermon on "State School Education." Thus we have the contrast pursued between the "older churches" and "the multitude of sects;" the "Churchman" and the "sectary," the "Puritan sect" and "Catholic doctrine." It is surely a peculiar time to insist upon the Anglican unity and the diversity beyond. With the utterances before us, recently presented from Mr. Green, Canon Farr, Dean Russell, Archdeacon Dove, Mr. Elcum, Mr. Moulden, &c.;, &c.;, we have an electric light thrown upon the preservation of unity, the sin of schism, and the existence of the sects. How marvellously scientific is the frontier of "the mother Church." A fire, unhappily attended with fatal __-__, took pboe oa Monday, July 28, in Mclntyi__-_, off .___obe___e., Melbourne,— a small shed occupied by an old blind beggar named Joha Winter, wfao for many years has been a familiar objeot in the streets of Mel bourne, accompanied by his dog, sometimes a Hewf otmdlaad and at others a Mack retriever. The Age says—"The abed waa situated in a hack yard, and Winter and his dogs were its sole occupants. Abont 8 .clock on Sunday night tiie old n?— asked a neighbor for a bit of firewood for lhe purpose cf making a fire in a kiad ot 1 einaD stove which he had in his hut. Just as it 1 was getting light yesterday morning a young i bnt_arwho_-__o_>byn_-_edanappea___e 1 of fire in Winter's dwelling. ?He a* once gave the alarm, bnt i* was *? !?**? tot the shed was of such inflammable materials that it was almost immediately a mass ot flame. The young man wbo first saw the fire waa un aware that anyone was Uving in the place, but even fae had it Is doubtful if either be or any one else oould have extrioated tiie unfortunate old man. The Metropolitan Fire Brigade was quickly on the spot, snd prevented tiie flames from spreading beyond the shed, of whieh at fi—t there appeared great danger. As the fire was quenched hy the streams of water thrown on it [a dreadful pioture wai presented to ths sight of those around. Tho blackened remains of the old blind man were seen lying in the oentre of the shed as though he had left his bed wben he felt the fire around bim in order to escape, bnt had been unable to make his way through the intense heat, and through his having haired his door aooording to fais _?u_l custom. His two dogs shared his melancholy fate, their bodies having been literally roasted." The following particulars, showing the respective costs ol a main newer towards the Beedbeds and of one towards the Tam __h_nter Belt, have been laid before Parlia ment :—Estimated cost of main sewer towards Beedbeds—Oval sewer, 1 ft. 4 in. by 3 ft. 6 in., 716yards, at £4 2s. 6d.=£2_53 10s.; do., 2 ft. 8 in. by 4 _~ 1,199 yards, at £_ 12s. 7d.= £5,550 7s.

This would be the coat of the main sewer towards the Beedbeds. of sufficient capacity t- carry fie sewage of Adelaide and of aU tbe principal suburbs, except Unley and Goodwood.

This would be the cost of the main sewer to Tam O'Sbanter Belt, of sufficient capacity to carry the sewage of Adelaide off all tiie principal suburbs, except Unley and Goodwood. The cross section of this aewer towards the outfall is smaller than that of a sewer of equal capacity towards the Beedbeds, because the inclination is greater. Some of the members of the Assembly were in an unusually facetious mood on Thurs day. Mr. Bright, while discussing his favorite qu_tion, the dog nuisance, described one of the objectors to the late Dog Bill as that "uni versal legislator, Mr. Coglin." He was imme diately called to order by the Speaker, who said tbat such a term was hardly respectful. Mr. Bright, amid much laughter, expressed his regret at having transgressed the rules of debate, but said if he never deviated from order further than that he would be per fectly satisfied. Subsequently Mr. Krichauff, in introducing fais motion for " further information relating to immigration," admitted that it was rather vague, a statement which was received with laughter on all sides of the House, and tiie amusement was greatly increased by Mr. Krichauff. naive ex planation "that it was necessary to put some thing con the Notice-Paper." Later on an amusing scene occurred, the principal actors being Messrs. Coglin and Cooke. Both these members had motions on the paper for informa tion respecting the Port Augusta Waterworks, bnt one wanted the information generally, tha other in detail. Mr. Coglin at first agreed to Mr. Cooke's motion being embodied in his. wbich came first, as an amend ment, but subsequently withdrew his con sent, which slightly annoyed Mr. Cooke. Both gentlemen claimed that they were acting in accordance with requests from their consti tuents, and in the end both carried their motions. But Mr. Cooke accused Mr. Coglin of not consulting his colleagues in the representa tion of the district with reference to its wants, si_d Mr. Coglin replied in oae of his cha racteristic speeches, which evoked, as m?y be imagined, much langhtw. Several members g—)_ hurnoredly bantered both Mr. Coglin and Mr. Cooke, and ultimately tbe ma _er passed nff us a joke, leaving behind, we beUeve, no ill feeling. The following pen and ink sketch of the Get man Chancellor delivering his great speech in the Beichstag on the Customs tariffs appeared in ths Taghlatt. a Berlin paper:—Before even 1 hearing a word you can teU by the aspect of the Chamber that it is the Chancellor who is speak ing. With their bodies stretched out and ears wide open everybody leans forward to listen. The pencils of the shorthand writers fly over the paper with the rapidity of lightning, aud you hold your breath involuntarily that you may hear better. From below is beard a feeble -voice—one of those voices which, by its nervous tone, suggests excess of intellectual work. The words come by jerks, each sen tence being laboriously formed. The orator is sometimes flurried, sometimes hesitating in his speech. He recalls each sentence, twists it and turns it about nntil he has elimi nated all the points which an adversary might attack. It is then only that he abandons it to the House. In listening to him you experience a strange excitement, for while this strong man continues his speech you are momentarily feel ing that he will suddenly stop short in the middle of his discourse. Not that ideas are likely to be wanting, but one' fears lest the weakly voice whieh issues so laboriously from the Chancellor's robust frame may fail in the midst of a peroration without the possibility in the hurry of picking up the broken threads. The Chancellor himself looks ill _t ease while speaking, his thin white hands fidget ting now with one and now with an otLcr button of hi. modest dark blue cuinassier's uniform. Then they catch feverishly at' the long pencils so much talked aboat, seek refuge an tfae table, and at last rest on (he glass of water which stands on the tribune. Toa might fancy that it was only tins rating place that was wanting, for presently his speech grows firmer, more severe; words flow from his lips with greater clearness, his thick eyebrows are lowered stiU more upon the grey eyes which seem to pene trate tbe ranks of the deputies. It is now evi dent tbat the orator is approaching the end of his speech, the sentences become shorter and more vigorous. And then the Chancellor draws himself up to his full height; tiie voice sp weak at first gains a clear, hard ring, and he throws his last sentenoe like a bomb into tbe midst of tbe chamber, resuming his seat amid the loud applause of his Mends. Cookery classes will Ve held at the Ss' varts' Home till further notice, commencing to-day.

The whole tiring was weU received.and created botfa wonder and amusement. A sailor's hornpipe, danced by a little girl who is called the "Infant Phantom-. waar_narkaWy good, and the audience impera tively insisted upon a repetition of it, which was good- naturedly complied with. At the Theatre Roy si on Thursday even ing, the great historical play of " Henry V_," was reproduced. The grand display which has told so well with the Adelaide public had lost none of ita attractions, aud the house was as well filled as ever. Thia evening the perfor mance will be repeated for the benefit of Miss Watt-Tanner, who has so ably supported Mr. Bignoldln his arduous task in placing tbe play before Young Anstaralia in such a shape as to make ft always a _n_ee_ra___. The first performance tbat has yet taken place in fhe-new __ast__i_ at Yongala was given by tbe Lynch Family of Bellringers on Wednes day evenihg. The haU was densely crowded from stage to door, many present having eome __g distances. The acoustic properties of the huilding were pronounced to be admirable by the Bellringers, and they congratulated the residents upon tbe -possession of a hall far superior to meat country rooma. The troupe promised another visit before leaving the colony. An entertainment under the patronage of Lady Jervois will be given in the Town Hall this evening in aid 61 tiie Children's Hospital, fay the boya and girls of the Grote-street Model School. Miss Piayford aad Messrs. Mo?ride, Diamond, and Phillips have consented to assist. These concerts have always been popular, and we hear tbat 700 tickets have heen aold already. One item 00 the programme is de serving of notice. A tune, new to the con ductor and the children, will be sung at sight from signals given by tfae hand. The other items in the programme embrace glees, part songs, and rounds, one of the latter being iasix parts. A return match took place on Wednes day, July 30, between tbe Blyth and Saddle worth Rifle Companies, each coinpany firing on Hs own range, five shots per man at four dis tances. Government targets were used. The following are tbe scores 01 tfae Blyth men:— On Thursday evening, July 31, a concert was given by the Adelaide Amateur Minstrels at St. Bartholomew's Schoolroom, the object being to increase the building fund in onnectton with the hall. There was a large aud appre ciative audience. A good programme was very well carried out, the performances of the troape as a whole, and of some of the members par ticularly, being very creditable. The troupe comprised three or four vocalists who bave appeared before Adelaide audiences on previous occasions in connection with minstrelsy, and a few other promising aspirants in the "burnt oork " line. The most faulty part of tiie enter tainment was that for what a rather limited otchestra was responsible, butthe audience was not too exacting, and overlooked tbe short comings of the instrumentalist.. Tfae jokes of the corner men were up to the average, end with the aid of a little byplay Bones and Tambo succeeded in infusing some fun into the first part of the enter tainment. The vocalists with one exception appeared to be in good vo ce, and succeeded in eliciting loud applause. Br'. ELillinbeck gave " Won't you buy my pretty flowers?" and Mr. Humphrey contributed " Little sister's gone to sleep" in good style. Mr. Murcb and Mr. Chamberlain sang oonde songs with effect, and Mr. Small, who has a very good falsetto voice, and Mr. James rendered ballads creditably. ] Mr. Chipp was successful in two songs, and Mr. Murch. song and dance met with a favorable reception. The concluding sketch waa well presented, and tbe audience dispersed appa rently very well satisfied. On Thursday evening, July 31, another of the entertainments in aid of the Ohureh Building Fund was given inthe Baptist Ohureh, Flinders-street, to a large and appreciative audience. The piece selected for tiie occasion was a service of song entitled "Nothing to Kebody," with iltasteations of sacred music. Blr. Theodore Hack, Mayor of Port Adelaide, gave tbe connective readings. Mr. Thompson conducted the musical portion of the entertain ment, and Mr. Crocker presided at the organ, j " Nothing to Nobody^ is taken from oue of the Sunday-school naratives, and describes a poor ' orphan girl who is noticed by a young lady on her way to Sunday-school, sitting hungry and [ cold upon a doorstep. The child at first posi- ' tively refuses the young lad; _ invitation to go j with her to school, but in course of time by many little kindnesses is induced to become a regular atten.ant. Tbe young lady also pays for faer education at a day school, and alternately tbe child is taken from her wretched home, where ehe had known little else than iliusage and starvation, and where too sbe had beeu so often toid she was " nothing to nobody," to be a cheer ful industrious maid in the young lady's house. She is found to possess many excellent qualities, and above all learns unda tiie young lady's in fluence, to set her affections an things beyond thu present world. Tbe musical illustrations were rendered witfa faultless precision, aud the whole performance reflected the greatest credit on all persons concerned in it. After the usual votes of thanks the singing of the doxology brought tbe evening's entertainment to a close. A very successful sacred concert was given in the Tynte-street Baptist Church on Thursday evening, July 31. There was a large attendance. An excellent programme, embrac ing many choice selections of sacred music, had been prepared, and the performers, all of whom were well-known vocalists, appeared to give the greatest satisfaction to all present. Mr. T. H. Jones, the organist of the church, rendered tiiree solos on the organ—the overture to a___buca donosor," " Offerto?S," and Mendelsohn's " War March"—with admirable execution and expres sion, showing that he had perfect control over the instrument. He also accompanied the singers during the evening. Two quartettss, "Morning Prayer" and "Benedictus," were given in an excellent manner by Mra. Jones, MissE. Vandepeer,andMessrs. J. K. Coombe and H. O. _Tms_. Th__re were also two other quartettes given by the same singers, with tbe excepti-n tbat Ur.B. Phillips took the place of Mr. -iasb. Tbe f__m of the evening was the solo," With verdure clad," which was sung with much taste by Mrs. Jones; and Miss Vandepesr achieved a success in "Consider tiie lilies." A trio, "We pray thee. Father, hear ns* by Mrs. Jones, Miss Vandepeer, and Mr. Coombe was given with eonmderalde effect, and tiie purity of the voices of the lady singers was heard to ad vantage in tiie duets "He wipes a tear from every eye," and **Buth and Naomi." Bliss Nimmo gave "O rest in the Lord" in happy style. Mr. Phillips sang with feeling the beau tiful solo * The lost ___d," and Mr. Nash in the recitative "Bialt now ye faithful," aud the cavatina " Once by his bid supernal" was equally successful. Messrs. Nash and Phillips sang with taste the duet" Polaski'- banner," aud Mr. Coombe rendered the solo "O Lord, be thou my light? 1 in a pleasing manner. Daring _a interval several prizes were presented to the boys of the Church choir far their good conduct. The pro ■ eeds of tbe concert were in aid of the organ f_,d. "The lease of the Academy of Music and Victoria-arevde, Bourke-atreet —of which abont 27 years have still to run—was put up to suction yesterday," reports the Melbourne Argus of July _.. •* The theatre and the arcade were built in 1876 by Hr. Joseph Aarons, wbo, through adverse became insolvent. They were partly erected witb the assistance of the Victoria Permanent BuUding Society, who received a mortgage over the leasehold for £28.000. "yesterday's sale took place under.tbe direction of the mortgagee. A laige number of persons attended to look ou at tbe proceedings, aud a few to take part in them. The sale was conducted by Mr. Crews (of Crews & Arkle). with the assist ance of Mr. Monro, MJ-.A., the representa tive of the Society. Jt was stated in the con ditions of sale read out by Mr. Munro tbat the ground on which the theatre, Ac, atood was 1 hdd under lease far thirty years from Ist March. 1876, at the yearly rental of £1,300; tfaat part of the property was held under sub lease by Mr. Hosie; and that the theatre was let on January l_rt to Mr.S. B. Wells, by Mr. Aarons, for seven yeara from 2nd June, 1879, at £20 a week, and S per cent, of the gross re ceipts; bus that tbe vendor had been advised that the lease was invalid as against him, and that an action of ejectment to recover pos_->ion of tbe property had been com menced, and would be continued if the pur charer desired it. It did not take Mr. Crews long to get through his duty, for _ there were apparently not more than three bidders present. From _E4/XX> tbe bids jumped to £20,000, then went on by thousands to _30j003, and stopped at £30,400, at wliich sum tiie pro perty was knocked down to Mr. Thomas Cooper, M.l__A. It was stated in the advertisement tiiat the annua] inoeme from the Theatre and Arcade waa £7,481. Following the disposal of the leasehold came a freehold adjacent to the Arcade, with a frontage of 52 ft to Boyal -lane It waa also bought by Mr. Cooper for £3.500. _* amount of tiie mortgage npon it held by the Society is £3,000.
