THE FLIGHT OF THE TEARS. When one by one tlif> silent stately years Glide like pale ghosts "beyond our yearning eight, "Vainly we stretch our *rms !o stay their flight, So soon, so swift, they pass to endless night! We hardly learn to name them, To praise them or to blame (hem. To know their shadowy faces, Ere we see J heir empty places! Only once the glad spring greets them, Only once fair summer meets them, Only once the automn glory Tells for them its mystic story. Only once the winter hoary Wears for them its robes of light } Tears lrare their work half dooe; like men, alas ! With sheaves ungathered to their glares they pass, And are forgotten, "Wliat they strive to do Lives for a while in memory of a few, Then over all Oblivion's waters flow The years are buried in the long ago.
