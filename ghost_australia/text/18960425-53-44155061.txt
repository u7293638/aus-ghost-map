B. H. A. T. C. RACES. The Club's Inaugural Meeting. BETTER weather could hardly bo conceived than that which at from midday tu 2.30 , o'clock induced a very fair crowd to proceed to the Recreation Association's ground for thc purpose of taking part in the inaugural meeting of the Broken Hill Amateur Turf Club. Moreover, as the proceeds ore to be devoted to the Brunner Relief Fund and thc Broken Hill Hospital, some people who are not habitues of race meetings put in an appearance ; the mine officers, for example, were particularly well represented. Mr. J. Souter was judge, Mr. Bromley starter, Mr. Phyer clerk of the course, and Mr. Megaw clerk* of the scales ; while as secretary Mr. "Tom" Tait was an exceedingly hard worker, both before and during the meeting. The racing was on the whole interesting, and patrons were apparently in no wise dis- appointed with the preliminary engagement of a body for whose future nothing but success is wished.
