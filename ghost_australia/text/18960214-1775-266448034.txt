HAUNTED BY GHOSTS. It is not generally known, in connection with Rudyard Kipling's early life, that to bo haunted by a terribln apparition, which took the form of a grandmother's ghost, was almost tho constant plaguo of his existence a boy. One day the ' guardian of his youthful years' discovered him in the garden dancing wildly round a small tree and soundly belabouring it with-a stick. In [reply to her anxious inquiry 1 as tothe reason for this strange conduct, young Kipling assured hsr that he was trying to tbrash his grandmother, who was for ever appearing before him in an awful shape. Then tho g-ood woman took Rudyard's place, and Rudyard assumed the role of the bush. He saw no moro grandmothers that day at-least. Still, as time went on this habit of seeing apparitions developed to the boy, who complained again and again of strange figures being seatod in chairs or standing before him. Eventually an oculist was consulted, who recommended a particular kind of spectaoles, with the result that the apparitions were effectually and permanently banished from his presence.
