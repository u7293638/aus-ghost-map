Only Think op it ! A man hoard what his neighbours said ahout him — He thought the world would not revolve without Jiim — | At last the thoughts of what his neigh bours thought so worried him — That he gave up the ghost, and then they thought they'd liury him — And their tongues still wag ! He (vc-y plain) : 'They say, dear, that people who live together grow very much alike,' She: 'Then you | uust consider my refusal as final.' 1
