A e e w t My friends are so few and far between present, that it would be a thousand pities to refuse an audience to one of them. But you my f riend! Isn't, that rather a new role for the gallant captain of chasseurs?" She led the way into the bare looking apartment, where last night Harriet Harm an had made her confession, and pointed to a chair. There was a grace, a triumph about her he had "never seen before—the "whole expression of her face was changed. Where was the sad sombre face of Miss Heracastlfe now* A sor: of proud triumph lit all the face before him. He accepted the chair only to'lean across its wooden back and look at her. She stood where the golden sunshine fell fullest upon her—her tail form looking taller and more classic than ever In her trailing white robe, a crimson cord for her girdle. The brown hair was swept off forehead and temples, showing the scar on the left plainly, and adding to the nobility of her face. The black had been washed from the eyebrows—altogether she was changed almost out of knowledge. "Will Captain O'Donnell—my friend— who has hunted me down from first to last speak? What is i; that has takan you out of your bed at this uncivilised hour and brought-you to Bracken Hollow and-me?" .. The ringing tone of her voice, the meaning spartde of her eye and smile confounded him. "To warn you for the last-time." "For the last time—to warn me of what!?" "That all is known—all." "TVliat does all comprise? May I ask you to-explain?" "That the death and burial of Katherine DangerSeld was a fraud, and Miss Hern castle and Kaiherine Dangerfield are one and the same. lam acting on no suspicion—I rarely act on that. I am acting on certainty. I knew the grave in Castleford churchyard to be a. fraud —the tombstone lying even more than tombstones usually lie. I knew that grave held an frmpty coffin." "May I ask how?" "In the simplest manner possible. i employed a man accustomed to such dreadful work, and opened the grave. We raised the coffin, opened that, and found, as I told you—nothing." She sat and looked at him—wonder not unmixed with a species of amusement and admiration, in her face. "And yet you call yourself my friend! Captain O'Donnell, you are an extraordinary man." "No; I don't see it," he answered coolly. "It wasn't anything very extraordinary. From the hour I discovered your Identity with the New York actress my suspicions were aroused. Tou had never given up the stage and buried yourself alive at Scarswood in the ca,pa- •ciiy of governess without some powerful latent motive. That motive. I confess, I felt curious to discover., Then you made love to Sir Arthur Tregenna—I beg your pardon, permitted him to fall in love with you." Katherine smiled once more. "As Sir Arthur had long before been signed, sealed, and delivered over to Lady Cecil Clive, and he seemed powerless to help himself, I felt called upon to help him. He is my friend, you know, so also is his affianced wife. Then you played ghost—oh, yes, you did—and frightened Sir Peter to the verge of insanity. Altogether you were too dangrous a sort of person to be allowed to go on without a short pull up from some one."' Again his listener smiled as she recalled Sir Peter's "ghastly face of fright. "Cap,tain O'Donnell, I cannot understand why you should take the trouble to come here and say this. Why should you endeavor to save a woman you hold in aversion and contempt—a woman, in short, whom you hate?" "Whom I hate!" he repeated, quietly. "Since when have I told you I hated you? I have heard Katherine Danger-field's story—a strange, sad story—and I believe her. even In this hour, to be, more sinned against than sinning. I believe a great and generous nature has "been warped. Katherine Dangerfield, X pity you—from my soul I do — and with my whole heart I stand before you, your friend. It is not too late yet ; pause, while there is yet time, on the road you are treading, and go back." There was no mistaking his earnestness, the generous glow of his face, the friendly warmth of his tone. She had turned away from him and was looking out at the golden morning sky. "Go back!" she repeated, bitterly. "Is there ever any going back in this world? Six years ago I might have listened; today it is too late." She covered her face with her hands, her breast heaving, the color burning in her face, moved to the very depth of her soul with a passion of which he did not dream. " "Come. Katherine—you have fought long and well, and nothing has come of it. Give it up, and for ever." Her hands dropped from her face; something in the last words seemed to rouse her. She looked at him steadily. "And nothing has come of it?" she repeated. "That is your mistake. Captain O'Donnell. Something has come of it. I wonder what you would say if I told you —what?" "Tell me, and see." "I confess,", she'went on, "to all laid to my charge. I am Kaiherine Dangerfield; I have been buried and risen ffom the dead, and with that resurrection aff nature seemed to'.change. I have brooded -on -one- subject—my wrongs—until I believe my .brain has turned. I fledlrom the house of my true and loyal friend,; Henry Otis, and went to America. -I hecame the New York actress you -so -cleverly recognised. From New York I wrote "to Mr Otis. I told him if Gaston Dautree died to bliry him decently—if he lived, to furnish £)Lm with money to quit EnglaiJB. Unhappily he died, but not for more than a year after - receiving' his injuries. All those years r remained to New Yorti I worked hard in.ray profession, and rose. I made money, and I, hoarded it like a miser. . Day and night, stronger and stronger with each.; year, grew the determination to return, to keep my vow. I tell you I believe there were times when I was insane on this subject Death alone could have held me back. I waited patiently, while burning with impatience; I worked, I hoarded, and.at, last my aay came, l I returned , to England; I made w way Into the. family of Sir Peter Dangerfield; my revenge had: begun: ..: '...-•.. • ' •' ' .:'.-'•-.:• '1 had adouble motive .In returning—: one, my vengeance on 'him; the other, to discover my parentage. I had a clue; and, strange jto «ay. In working out one, I Tra? .wofldng but the other.

She your friend through all." -i :; The hard look came over her face once more. & hard light in her eyes. "Was she ? In your eyes, of course! Lady Cecil *an do no evil. But what If i toia,you she iiad done me the deepest, the deadliest wrong of all !" He looked ather in •uiprise. "I don't understand," he said, a little coldly. "I believe Lady Cecil to he incapable of wilfully wronging anyone, and she always spoke gently of you:" . She leaned her forehead on her hands ®f a Pushed hack her hair with a long tired sigh. "Oh, Heaven, I want to do right! -My hfe has been bitter, bitter, bitter, and I feel as though I were steeped in crime to the lips. If I could only die and end it all! But death passes the guilty, and miserable by. and takes the happy and the good." Her folded arms were, lying on' the table; her head fell forward on them, as though she never cared to lift it again. O'Donnell took both her hands in his, a compassion such as he had never felt for any human being before stirring his heart. "What am I that I should judge ? There is nothing., but pity for you in. my. heart—nothing. Give lip this dark and dangerous "Ste, be true to yourfelf—to the noble -nature Heaven has given you—once more." She-rose "up.'her hands still, in .bis, a sort of inspiration shining in.her face. "I will," she-answered. "You,, whom I thought my enemy, shall save me. I renounce it—"the plotting—the evil—the revenge—and for your sake, for the love you bear her, I will spare "her.V He looked at her in mute inquiry. She cmiled. drew'away her hands, and re^ sumed her seat. "You do not understand. See here. Captain O'Donnell: I told you, did I not, my second object In returning to. England was to discover my parentage? Well, I have discovered It." "You have?" he cried, breathlessly. "I have discovered .it. My father lives, and the daughter of my nurse occupies n;y place in his heart, the name I should bear. It's a, very old story—changed at nurse—and - that • nurse has confessed alL" "You have done this? Then I congratulate you, indeed! You will go to your father at once, of course? No one, believe me, can rejoice at this more sincerely than I." "You mistake—I shall never go! This morning I had intended—but that is all past now. If I renounce my revenge and wrong- doing in one way, I renounce it in al). I never understood half measures." " "But there is no wrong-doing here— it is right, it is your duty to go." She smiled. "I wonder If this would be your advice if—if. for example only—my father were the Earl of Huysland. I name him, you understand, as the first I think of." "I should tell you still to go. Right is right Though the Earl of Ruysland were your father, though Lady Cecil had usurped your place,, I should still say, go—tell the truth, be the cost what it may." "You, who love Lady Cecil, give me this advice? Captain O'Donnell, you don't love her." "I love her so well that I leave her; I love her so well that if the thing you speak of were possible, I would be the first to go and tell her. Once again— in the face of all that may follow—I repeat, go! Tell the truth, take the place and name that are yours, and let me help you if I can." ^ "You love her so well that you leave her," she repeated, dreiamily. Then she crossed the room without a word, lit 2 candle, and placed-it on the table before him. He watched her In silent surprise.. She drew from heir pocket a folded paper, and handed it to him. "You have done greater service than you dream of in coming here," she said. "Do one last favor, i • want this paper destroyed. I have a whimsical fancy to see you do it. Hold it to the candle and let it burn." He took it doubtfully. Ho. read the superscription—"Confession of Harriet Hanran," land -hesitated. "I don't know—why should I?. Why is this?" "Nothing that concerns any one onearth but myself. You wRI be doing a good deed, I believe, in destroying It. Let me see you burn it I can do it, of course; but, as" I said, I have a fancythat yours should be the hand to destroy it. Burn it. Captain O'Donnell." Still wondering — still doubting — he obeyed: held the paper in the flame of the candle until it dropped in a charred cloud on the table. Then she held out her hand to him with a brave, bright smile. • "Once more I thank you. You have done me a ; great service. You have saved ^me from myself. When do you leave?" "To-day; but if I can aid you in any way—if- I can take you to your father "You are ready to do it, I know; but I have not quite made up my mind about that yet. It is not a thing to be done lri a hurry. Let us. say good-bye, and part Jor the present." He stood and looked at her doubtfully. He felt vaguely that never had he been farther .from understanding her than.at -this moment. "Farewell, Captain O'Donnell, my friend," she said, softly. There was a lingering tenderness her voice, in her eyes.'that-might have told bSm her secret: But men are totally blind sometimes. He saw nothing. "Not farewell." he said; "but revoir." . .She went with him to the door. She \patche4 him with wistful eyes, out of sight. ' ' 'v.""
