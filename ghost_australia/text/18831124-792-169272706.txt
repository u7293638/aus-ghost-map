THE HOLT GHOST FLOWER. The Botanical Garden in Washington is possessed of a rare ouriosity now in the flower kingdom. It is a Holy Ghost or Dove flower in bloom. This curiosity is from Panama, and blooms annually. The plant grows from a bulb about the size of one's hand, and springs up in a single stalk, which is the size of a pipe stem, and resembling in colour and general appearance a rush, and is about three and one-half feet high. At the top of the stalk and for a space of probably six inches along its sides near the top, the flowers are located. They are about two and one-half inches in circumference, white as snow, appearing rather like white wax or marble, and of the shape of a cup with the month inclined outwardly. At the bottom of this cup-Bbaped blossom is the most lovely specimen of nature's art. It is the dove, which occupies a sitting posture, with wings extending upward, and exhibiting the first half of the dove. In front of tbe dpve is an altar slightly Bprinkled with diminutive dots of maroon oolouring, and this is the only colour about the bloom. At the base of the stalk are three shoot?, or long leaves, like the shoots to new corn. There are twenty-five of the cups on the stem, and the fragrance is very delicate and sweet. It is a great curiosity, and is attracting a large number of visitors. The dove specimen is kept in the greenhouse where the air plants are, which are nothing Jess than blocks of wood, kept in a temperature so hot and damp that they are forced to grow and bloom, and these alone are worth seeing. ?
