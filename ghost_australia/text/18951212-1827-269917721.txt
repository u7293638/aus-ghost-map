PAKSOA jo;;ii, The Cai'lifornia, gold. fever was-at. its height when, the.crowd of 'fortune seekers, excited by -the prospect, of lBiraediate gam, rushed to the banks of the Bangalong. .;:•-:..• !.•;•;•• We—that is, .lack Pett.it aud i— had followed the gold away-up the river for long weary miles, sometimes in company, often alone, occasionally finding dust, but more frequentlv diggmg from sunrise until sunset •without seeing a speck. In commou •with thousands of adventurers, who were in a similar plight, we were ever mocked, by the • tickle jade Fortune. The most incomprehensible thing about it all was that there seemed to be some partv forever m advance of us; for, although the-banks of the river Trere undisturbed, the water cmie down, from the hills laden with mud, •which was easily recognisable by miner's eye. It-was onl y after a Ion"', tedious tramp with heavy hearts and ever lightening pockets, that we '.came upon the advance , party- They wel- comed us with, what "race they could, .which was not much j hub oni arrival- mattered little, for others quickly came along-, our trail, now in there were fully fifty gold-seekers ol almost as many nationalities npoiv the the ground. All of these remained, not one went further. There was no need,' for the bed. of the-gold bad been discovered. Within the space of a ; square mile or so, thereabout, lay enough of the precious metal to have enriched a thousand, miners beyond the dreams of avarice The camp was pitched on the bank of the liver, which, under the scorching rays of the summer sun, liad dwindled down to a mere fresliet. There was none too mucli water obtainable for the requirements of goldwashing ; it was rapidly becoming too precious a commodity to be recklessly employed as a beverage—a result which gladdened the heart of Bert Togue, the barkeeper, who, with the keenness of a vulture for scenting out carcasses.- had followed promptly upou the heels of the thirsty miners and adventurers. The sceneiy was impressive and awe-inspiring. Bleak, barren, yet jinceless quartz reefs rose m. long undulating waves of stone like a pctrilied ocean on every side. Beyond these lay the bush and the sciub, interspersed here and " there with clumps of pme, while further away still a long range of low, naked hills stretched along the sky line until they were lost in mist. Those hills enjoyed an evil reputation as resorts for, bands of redskins, who had cut off more than one prospecting party ; and of prairie pirates and road agents, who were even more merciless than they. In one -thing both were cordially agreed:—their h:i nds were against the miners, and equally the miners scored against tlieni on evei v possible opportunity 1 liese fellows served one useful purpose, for tlift fear and-dread offtherucaused us to keep together, as toihavefal len. 111 to their hands -would' have been cei-fain. death. ,,:- -.- ,0,ite oveniug, when the .cradles were busily rocking: and. the/-eb.pp<«!»j; —si, ^^-ettngBT o the cimp.

The rough fellows talked to one an-j other ; the culprit's guards, perbapsi intentionally, relaxed their vigilance,] and in the confusion the Yankee dis-| appeared, giving Ins comrades audi would-be executioners tune to let; their anger cool. Young Togue did not die.

"The opening hymnlsemg,concluded, the parson led in .prayer. -.-.-:, At the moment when the; attention of- all ,was absorbed in. this exercise,;a shot was fired outside, ;and the sounds of. a scuffle, followed by a wild cry for help, was heard-proceeding, from- the direction of ;the;gold- office. \- The miners, like a - .famished lion aroused from its lair, sprang to their feet, only to find themselves face to face with two tall masked men who •bad-quietly :and-unobtr^sivelyKentered: revolvers,.thundered— -.. --vx'^/t.
