G, Jenkins gave an .address on " Christ and the children." In the:after noon. a " Flag Signal"! service was con ducted, when :r number of 'flags were used and signals as used at sea were given to illustrate the voyage of life. Many of the evils of the present dayjvere dealt with in an able manner, and it was shown how 'many promising voyages had terminated in- terrible disaster owing to the failing into these evils. An earnest appeaL was made to all present .to,sail under Christ as their captain., The service was a very interesting one. In the evening the sab- , ject of Beautiful Flowers and Tender Grapes" was given. The Rev.Mr. Jen bin conducted the afternoon and evening ser vices, and at both the Church was full. On Monday evening the services were ; continued, when a drawing room enter tainment was held.. The Church was again filled/ After a hymn by the children, the Rev. W. S. Pearce (Congre-. gational) opened with prayer. Daring the evening the Rev. Air. Jenkins enter tained the audience with sketches of Cornish character claiming for the Cornish characteristics " Brave heartadnesa," "En durance," " Steadfastness," " industry," and <! Devoutness." These were illus trated by the characters of " Dick Curnoe," "Old Rosie/' "Captain Joe,"1 " A Real Ghost," " Ighly Hummoral," and the passengers and oonversationB which took place in the old mail coach " The Vivid.'.' The entertainment was of an entirely new character in this district; %nd it was intensely amusing and interest ing and also instructive and faelpfnl. The audience was an appreciative one, as was evidenced by the continued applause which greeted the entertainer. It some times happens that an entertainer has to tell his andieDce when to latigh before they can see there is anything to enjoy. This, however, was not the case with the rev. gentleman on Monday, who most have felt that he had his audience with him. At the whole of the Services on Sunday and Monday the school teachers ana children sang -a' number of . beautiful hymns with exactness and sweetness. One piece-sang deserves special mention, as it is the composition, of Mr. Cfaannon; of Adelaide, and has only been rendered once.before. It is a splendid composition, the harmony being considerably above the average writings. The name of the piece is " Day is dying," and it was thoronghly appreciated by lovers of good masic. The picnic was held on Wednesday, when a large number assembled in Mr. McLellan's paddock, kindly lent for the occasion. The" children were taken out in nine waggons, and a thoroughly enjoyable day was spent, the weather being all that could be desired. W,e have got one more picnio in -store, that of the Friendly Societies', which is to be held in the Show ground next Monday. Influenza is becoming prevalent. We.have again had a change in medical men. Dr. Erson, who has been here for about four months, has disposed of his practice to Dr. Murray Gibbs, of Moo rooptia, Victoria, the latter taking posses sion yesterday and the former leaving for Melbourne by last night's express. Dr. Erson has rendered good help in musical matters during his short stay here. I understand lie is as yet uncertain where he will settle.
