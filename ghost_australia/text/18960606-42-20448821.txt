It really seems as if in Ger imany the law prohibiting ■duelling Is more lionom-ed in the breach than tlie observance. Even tlie Emperor himself ■winks at the maintenance of the un written code of lionour. Bismarck fought more than one duel in Jiis youth, and" was only prevented from fighting another in nis old age by the conditions insisted on by his opponent. • It was at the time, when the Prince, then Chancellor of the :; Empire, : was forcing Vthroiygh' the dras tic social aud^ poiiclcaa ;r^forrns; '; For some tinie> Profcssoi.' : ;the great Gernian biologist, had 'been, sharp ly criticising the .measures of policy tile country was asked to accept. At the end of a particularly severe attack Bis marck, feeling himself personally af fronted, sent seconds to Vir'cliow with a challenge. The man of science, as a contemporary account itias it, was found in his laboratory hard at work on ex periments which, had for their object the;, discovery of a means of destroying trichinae, which were tihen making great ravages among the porkers of Ger many. "Ah," said the doctor, "a chal lenge from Prince Bismarck, eh ? Well, well,' as I am the challenged party I presume I have the choice of weapons. ,'Here they, are !" And lie held up.. two ■large sausages,;which.seemed to be ex actly alike. "One of these sausages," lie continued, "is filled with trJehinae-^it is deadly. The other sausage Is per fectly wholesome.- Externally -tliey can not be told apart. ?Let his; Excellency do me the honour to 'clioose whichever of these he Wishes, and eat it,,and I will eat the other." Well, though mani festly the proposition was as -reasonable as any duelling, ; proposition can be, Prince Bismarck's representatives re fused it. There was no and no one was accused of cowardice.

The 5p00k,... so the story goes; presented himself to his pro posed victim with the annoiiucement "Tiiomas Meddal, I want you," spoken in his most awe-inspiring sepulchral tones (ghosts always speak in sepul chral tones ; Wiey 'can't help it; their very surroundings are against the use of-any other kind of tone). But Thomas Meddal: was not willing to give liiinself up to the ghost so easily. He required stronger proof of the claim to his eariihly l>ody, and of the intangibility, of the' accosting spirit. With the assist ance of a stout stick he found that the ghostly flesh was all too solid, and a brief scrimmage ended all doubt and the spiritual visitor turned out to be an ordinary person of the name of Rudd. His little joke cost !him just £4 55.,. quite sufficient punishment to deter Mr. Rudd from meddaling with slieets again. Tliat same Thomas Meddal would be a bad subject for a professipnal stage mes merist to tty his hypnotic powers upon.
