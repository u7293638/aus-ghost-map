HlitILET RE-CREATED. And the man that did it was Beerbohm Tree, the most inlle?pirs l and versatile of all our actors. Halolet, the unsleakable Dane, hasof late years been done to death by ambitious artists who successively hero replied to the "To be" with "not to be." The sight of Wilson Barrett disporting his cumbrous length on the steps of the throne, and soliloquising before a Princess s audience was Inot one to forget easily. Poor bested Dane, he has indeed suffered the "slings and arrows of ootrageoas"-actors. But Mlr. leerbohm Tree has bid the dead bones live, and the sanes of Shakespeare are appeased. There was a splendid first night audience in the IHaymrket on the Thursday the play opened. Mr. Tree grasps the subtlety of the rile admirably. Haoulet's underlying lore for Ophelia is beautifully accentuated by tone and glance. The hosAe Aas moved ita masse at the end of the re ond act, when bending over his tablet by the red fire, Hamlet crii*, "The play's the thing, khcrein I'll catch the conscience of the king." In the filth act the chltchyaid is a spring patterre of blooms, a new rerndelitni, ani thither Hanlet returns to Ophelia's grave. The felring sceiie with Laerte is i magnificent pieci. of iutellectual grasp, shown in :he actor's expression :ind acting when he looks Laertes in the eye and ie'as his tleachety. Then i?ain, i3r. Tree's subtlety shows its power. Mrs. Tree makes a charming Oithelia, delicately as well as ;trongly givren. .Mr. Arthur Dacre, as Horatio, a!so acurdt a triumplh, and Mr. Fersnadez, as Ghost, and lr. Fred Terry as Laertes were generally successful. Shakespeare this season at the Haymarket will not pell ruiu.
