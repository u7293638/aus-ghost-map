The Art of Charming1. A man says that a woman to he clever at conversation must have a good memory. She must keep in mind so much as she knows of the tastes and prejudices of those present. If So-and-so's brother fought in the Egyptian war, if such a one has Scotch ancestry, if such another bad a dear friend or an aunt or something who went on the stage, if such another has written a poem on " mortality," and has- opinions on im mortality, and so on,, of each and all sire must remember. And " As yon said the other day" is a good way to introduce a pungent remark; or, " As your favourite author has it," which shows a flattering regard for one's preferences. All these tricks, if you call them so, must be studied. Don't try to make a man think how clever you are. Make him think how clever he is. Brighten him up. Lead him on to say witty things. You may even coax him up to a joke, he he as glum as Pkaroah's ghost. Remind him of clever things he said " the other day." Never mind if they are in ventions of your own. Never mind if he knows they are; so long as he does not imagine tliat you know they are you are all right. Tell bright things about him. It won't take long to make him feel, espe cially if he is really a chill fellow, that he is a lot smarter than even he thought him self, and he will correspondingly adore you. A man is apt to frizzle under the fire of your own humour and wit and brightness, and, of course, a man is never comfortable when he frizzles.â€”~Womas.
