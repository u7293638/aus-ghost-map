DIRTY BANKNOTES. TO THE EDITOR. Sir â€” come tune back a correspondent writing to your paper called attention to the filthy condition of the banknotea issued by Adelaide Banks, with the result that for a snore time tne most objectionable notes were withdrawn; but matters now, how ever, have been allowed to drift back to the former state, and the public have the pleasure (?) of handling notes which if boiled down would make a pig give up the ghost. Is there no remedy to prevent the circulation of these filthy notes? Must the public submit, while Bank shareholders reap the benefit of dividends through the apathy of the public in allowing these veritable plague- spots to be circulated in our houses and places of business ? I am, Sir, &&, ? ANTI-HUMBUG.
