SPORTING. Br "CETrOun." TIh. Victoria Amateur Turf Club hold their us',al monthly meeting to-morrow at Caulfield. A first.class programme has been prepared, and well responded. to by owners of horses, more than ordinary interest will be manifested in. the result of the running for the Oakleighl Handicap, which race last year introduced !us to the winner and placed horses for the Newmsarket 1886. This year the winner will be penalised with 101b., which ought to give a show to some -of tliose who finish' behind to reverse positions in the Newmarket., The Selling Ialco has a splendid field to pick from, Warfield, The Ghost, Ariul, or Delamia seem to me the best, in the order named; for the Hurdles I have a liking for the top weight, Huntsmen; and next to hii Re venge or Encore. The Criterion Stakes for 2 year olds,-has also a'lergo field to pick fromn. I like Suanshade, Bedouin, and Lady Lovell for the places. The Oak leigh Handicap introduces us to a-lot of Newmasrket candidates, and picking the winner.is a hard task, Millers best, Sedi tion, Louisa Buert and Beckwith are the Wuartctt from:l who think the winner winl come, and for the Steeple:hase I pre fer Ruby, Roulette, and Naboclesh. The llawskburn Handicap ought to provide a good contest, the best in appear ,to be 'The Levite, Salvo, Lesbin, and Britisher.
