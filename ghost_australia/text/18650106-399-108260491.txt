SELECTED POETRY. THE HAUNTED CHAMBER. In thy heart there is a chamber— None but God and thou have seen it— Darkened by the sombre shadows TCrom the folds of thought that screen it. Oq its walls are many pictures, Fainted by the hand of Time, Sketches of those mystic regions In the Infinite sublime. There are portraits of the faces That have passed away from earth; Glimpses of those sonny places Sacred to thy childhood mirth; Of the homestead, old and mossy, Close beside the meadow green, Where the brooks, like threads of silver, Wound their graceful curves between. And it is a haunted chamber; There the ghosts at midnight stray, Silent as the stars that wander Down the white-pav*d Milky Way. Yon behold the light forms trembling1 la their pare robes like a bride, And they look so much like living-, Yon forget that they have died— Ton forget the marble features Of the friend you laid at rest— Ton forget the pale hands folded On a pulseless soulless breast. But you see him slowly walking 'Mid the glow life's sunset weaves, When his lips dropp'd farewell blessings, And tiie trees their autumn leaves. Thus comes he long since departed, Beaching out his hand to thine, And his lips unto thee murmur In a tone that seems divine. In this chamber stands a mirror, Memory's lamp hangs overhead, Throwing dovrn a Eoften'd radiance On these pictures of the dead. In its clear depths we distinguish What we were, and what we are, Tli ere our inner life reflected, Shows us hideous or fair. Oh! iis in this secret chamber That we learn the solemn truth, As in links of spirit union Age again is joined with youth. —Australasian.
