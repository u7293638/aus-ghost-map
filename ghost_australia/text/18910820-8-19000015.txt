The Price off a Stick. In 1758 Foote, the comedian, visited Scotland, and thought travelling in the north very irksome. But he found quite a crowd of admirers in Edin- burgh, and what pleased him as Â«eil, the results in cash were satisfactory. About this time he wrote some of the best plays, including " The Minor," and " The Liar.' In 1702 he pro- duced " The Orators," which caused a great commotion. The comedy was full of bril- liant sarcasm upon the prevailing passion for oratory, and the belief in the celebrated Cock Lane ghost. This ghost was known to be a favorite with Dr. Johnson, and Foote originally in- tended to bring the doctor on the Btage. Johnson would have made an excellent subject ; but, hear- ing of Foote's intention, he took prompt measures to picvent the affront. "What is the price of a common oak stick ?" said Ursa Major. " Sixpence," returned Tom Davies. "Why, then, sir, give me leave to send your servant for a shilling one. I'll have a double quantity, for I am told that Foote means ' to take me off,' as he called it, and I am determined the follow shall not do it with impunity." Foote know the doctor meant what he said, bo ho let him alone, and fixed instead on George Faulk. ner, printer of the Dublin Journal-a decent, quiet man, whose only fault seems to have been that ho was minus a leg. Curiously enough, Faulkner actually printed and published the play in which he was caricatured. But the introduction of Faulkner involved the author in a long and costly libel suit ; and, by a sort of poetic justice, four years afterward, Foote lost one of his own legs.
