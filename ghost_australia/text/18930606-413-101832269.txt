Somnambulist's Story. The following story was told in a recont Dumber of Cassell's Saturday Journal by a sleep walkerOno night 1 left tlio house, asleep of course, without disturbing anyone, nud made my way to the summer-house, a place I visited so often in my sleep that it was always the first to be BOarched whenever I was missed. It appeared that at the time I reached the doorway of the suuuner- houBC, from which 1 coulil easily overlook the road on which the garden abutted, a terrible tragedy wis about to be enacted. Tlio houso nearest ours was occupied by an old maiden lady and her nephew. On this particular night the nephew had been to a party at soino distance, returning towards homo bet ween 2 and 3 o,clock in the morning—just as I was taking my walk abroad. As ho reached tlio roadway at the oncl of tho garden, ho was set upon by two ruffians, and after a eevero struggle was overpowered. The robbers, for such thoy were, wero about to rifle tho young man's pockets when I reached tho ond of tho garden. Owing to the white dressing-gown, and the palo, mild light of tho moon shining on mo, I supposo thoy believed I was a ghost or something equally uncanny. Anyhow, my parents say that wlion they arrived on tho spot—having missed ma and at once started in search— tlio two men were hurrying away, casting terror-striken glances behind thom. Tlio young man, although seriously injured, ovidontally recovered, and now says lie owes bis life to mc. The curious part of tho matter is that, although X was, whon discovered, leaning ovor tho wall, apparently looking at tho injured man, I had not tlio slightest recollection of tho affair on awakon iog.
