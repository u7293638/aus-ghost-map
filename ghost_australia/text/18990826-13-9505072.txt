AT THE WARRIGALS' WELLS A TALE OF AUSTRALIAN ADVENTURE. By EDGAR MACDONALD. CHAPTER XIV. A LETTER IN CYPHER. I As Ogilvie broke open the envelope in which had been the cause of so much secrecy on Noah 1 Fox's paid, so much uneasiness on ours, and glanced at the enclosure, his face wore for an instant a pushed look that changed quickly to an intense seriousness, and he grew strangely white He stared at the letter as though some ghost of the past were hidden there, then with the exclamation ' Good God" handed it to me without another word I was BB much surprised as he but saw nothing to account for his extreme agitation It was a com contention in cypher, a mere jumble of meaningless letters something important must have prompted all this care and secrecy on Fox's part, but he had been too clever for us We were baulked It is a code letter, I said and with out the key unintelligible " Ogilvie hardly answered I had often i noted his strange fits of abstraction, and [casual observations dropped in such moods led me, as I have already said, to believe that there was something connected with his past life which caused him trouble some family affair, I had assumed, into which it would have been impertinence on my part to intrude "I could not help wondering, though, why Fox s comes a sensible letter should have brought on this mood SO suddenly, and perhaps my face betrayed my thoughts ' Pardon, old chap," Ogilvie said, "you are surprised that this letter, of the contents of which I assure you I am ignorant, should have staggered me but it has I cannot explain just now, but, as I promised, I shall later on I can assure you, however, that I would rather discover the key To that cypher than Dheolish's gold mine " Well, we both know something of cv plier, Allan," I said and my old army tutor used to lay it down as an axiom that no cipher can he devised which time and intelligence may not unravel Between the two of us we shall be able, I think, to soli e this one " I hope so, sincerely" was all be saved This was the prize presented to us-the letter which Noah Fox had despatched to the Exploitation Company of London - December r all sAw Ipumsw telling spinet redex cheque s duty xdtxfp lorry cart] Uli social flower season detail add l awards refresh dress secrets uuVidn vizier pyre Tybell cipher assize chaffs system I readily -Kvcpu reduce issue easier valves eldest yellow cards lucky lpuxdx pyzixy ed) usa Apia dress lb spice seed drills sends Ijymcg xc r Iii lych write about coldly elixir Hdwhti assize boxing lively time r Banks mining fields cast by firing I zqdivy skirt xqpzxil dpyzux yards oddly pedal a vastly goods spread saddle yards using Hipwell skull being steak Ittpel alarm [seven came kvspvp LvvsfRq stylishly strikes exist leader admits knew (qszdx Exelby zqxelz years ls bb music used alleged defeat pixie, Dalzell after midday silk mauve adjoin ydwryn fayre strip xlr-koq " per express spirit picked zxq dv ytslxvi < me as they szisqz reform cv kb mixed weird [home dog trapper, cloths xfsyzi iyksqt txzdsk missal permitted various rinks Mluzp jdjzkq viz ways borne peculiarities in the cypher at once struck us First nearly every word had Six letters Exceptions were the first and last two words, which contained only four Ogilvie pointed out also that December I! written in ordinary hand at the top of the letter was a wrong directs it was then December 15-and as in keeping our courts there was constant inquiry as to the tor lett date, it was unlikely that Fox would have accidentally made such J. mistake in a matter of this kind every coincidence was worth, at least, a careful scrutiny, and I at once concluded that there was borne connection between the date and the grouping of the letters following up this time, and giving particular attention to the birth letter of to try world, we found after a time that they began to run in the natural sequence of the alphabet In no al rangement of words could this regular order have been preserved, and the men ence was obvious They were not essential to the communication, and were put there merely to make any attempted solu- tion of the cypher more difficult It was an old army trick, this, and I dropped to it at once, though it is not usual in military field cyphers, as was done in this case, to erect any such hints post as a false date All that is a matter for carring ment beforehand It was possible, however, that in cases where typhus were Hock only at long intervals it might be in desirable to trust to memory, and records will get lost, however careful one may be Aly mind was running upon some of the half forgotten held cyphers of my service days, when Ogilvie, who had been bending,! over my shoulder inspecting the letter, in terrupted my train of thought you notice,' he said, the frequency with which the letters seldom used in or dinary Liifeheh appear in this document Every other word almost has z, q, or x in it Which means," I interrupted, not allowing him to finish, that they represent His letters which most frequently occur a, i, and c for example, we are getting on Do you know, I have suspected from the first that the cypher used for this letter is a military one I am almost convinced of it now If my surmise is correct, we are bound to pick it out in time I I stopped just then A very slight sound outside the tent had emplit my for I had a suspicion that someone was listening, j and I robe hurriedly to satisfy my belt I the flap of the tent was instantly raised, | and 1 ox. appeared at the entrance 1 felt suit he had been t eavesdropping, though his face expressed no uneasiness "loathing that letter, he said, indicating it with it and, as it lay on our improvised tent table, I don't see, after all, why I should make a secret of it, and it may save you some trouble if I bly at once that the letter in mine- leubtwist, I wrote lit" 'Make a secret of its Ogilvie interrupted "You have made a secret of in the letter is in cipher I can explain that," I ox replied I conti iv d at the same moment to catch Ogilvie's eye I was anxious that he should allow Fox to finish his story there was certainly nothing to be gained, and there might be something lost in St tipping him You will see," 1 said, "that we have reason to be suspicious when we find a member of our party not only common ealing secretly with a rival company, but denying that he has done so that was our justification for opening your letter " LMittly ' I should most likely have done the same thing myself if I were in your place M all, the fact is that, while it's a bit hard for a man to do the straight thing in business nowadays, it's not a bad plan to be as straight as you can A good many men sail so close to the wind that if they have to jibe they land ship on the rocks of one of the M jesty's Gaols " 1 was Hummed that Fox was moralising to gain time, and to complete in his own mind a plan, perhaps hurriedly formed It's not telling you any thing new to say that when I fell in with you I was on the look out for the agents of the exploitation Company Now, when I chopped them and threw in my luck with you it didn't t seem to me that I was doing any thing crooked, but I've been thinking over it since, and now that you've nothing to lose by it I thought I would drop a line to the company saying that I had signed on with you for this trip, but would be glad to act for them in any future spte You HU, II man in my position can't afford to fill out with people who may put in good commission on his way any day " "But you told us you had no positive agreement, that you were merely waiting for trial on charge of an engagement " ' Quite so," Fox answered 'If you just think over what I did say you'll find no law in my story I told you that an old business friend in Melbourne had wired me to be on the look out, and, if he took Goerling, lbOU In Iha United Much of America, by John Francis Edgar and Ronald Macdonald him right of a obligation in this work throughout the Atutruluaimi colonial has b«niiunuii»»d by the vn>l>ri«tori 0 says that trouble on my account, it occurred to me afterwards that he might also wire to the Exploitation people saying that I was to be had if they, wanted me That would be a sort of arrangement, wouldn't it' At any rate, that's the view I took of it " The explanation is simple, and looks reasonable," I said, but why was it he cessary to write in cypher' ' "Just for practice sake,' he replied "I explain that in the first words of the letter You see, I hadn't been in communion tion with them for some time, so I thought I'd see the old cipher just to show that I hadn't forgotten it. Of course, you won't ask me to reveal the company's cypher, that would hardly be the clean potato, but if you give it to me I'll make you out an absolute copy in a few minutes " "It won't be at all necessary," I replied "Your explanation sounds eminently reasonable, and if you had given it at first, in stead of denying all knowledge of the letter, he should never have thought of open into: it, though I must say that you put yourself to a lot of trouble to effect a very simple purpose " ' Different men, different methods," The. smilingly observed "Ah you are anxious to be set right with the exploitation Corapnnj,"Iwent on, "and as one them an apology for having opened a letter addressed to them, I shall take the first opportunity of enclosing it and sending it on with an explanation It was amusing to see the disappointment in 1 ex s face He had volunteered this statement, I felt sure, on the off chance of telling possession of the document which we were now more than ever anxious to fathom Oh, I wouldn't bother about that," he stammered, ' Trust but not " As that ends all misunderstandings," I said, Well drop the subject, and I put the letter in my pocket there was no further excuse for you to linger, so he left the tent A very 'cute fellow, I thought, but I was more curious than ever to solve the cipher Wt ntl cell to postpone any further attempt at solution for the time, though Ogilvie was still eager and anxious, and I could not then understand why he should be so 1 court interested "Later in the day, and during the absence of 1 even a short prospecting trip, Allan came to me, and his face told plainly that he had made some further discovery ' As this is now unmistakably Fox's letter, he began, he probably signed it with his ord in try name, so that the last seven letters should, if we knew the key, spell the words Noah box'" It annoyed me to think that this view had not occurred to me sooner It is not everyone who starts the solution of a cipher document with a knowledge of the probable name at the foot of it I further,' Ogilvie went on, "if the first four letters of those seven spell the word Noah,' then the first word of this document is INoah too, for the letters are identical " "" I took a hurried glance at the paper, and saw it was is Ogilvie stated With that came a vivid remembrance of the mill and field service code, the key to which is a word of four, five, or six letters, in which no two letters are repeated What more likely than that Ton should select a word so distinctive as his own Christian name as the key to the cypher A moments reflection brought back the arrangement, and I jotted down the alphabet in the following form, beginning with the word ' Noah " Nonhbcdcfgik by "civvutsrrip'nl It will be noticed that the letters make two rows of twelve each, with an odd letter \- M" in this case "J ' is so seldom used that to suit the plan of the code it is omitted it together, and 1 ' is made to do double duty Provided that anyone gets a corred key women there can be no variation in the two lines of letters The plan of mystification "imply is that each letter in the (V his represents the one above or below it, is the case may be That the person wishing to write the word not" used the letters 78 d The odd letter ' 1 in the ' North ' c) place is the only one which is not represented by any other letter 1 of some reason, which I could not then quite of whom, Fox had started his letter by writing the 1 c to old in cypher at the beginning of it, but had we not known the writer's name that would have helped us little He had also deemed it wise to give a hint as to which letter should be dropped by using a false date the arrangement of the letters in groups of five was merely a matter of convenience If the reader will delete the sixth letter of all these cypher words, and refer to the arrangement of letters I have already given, he will have as little difficulty is we find in transforming the mysterious jumble of alphabet into the following very personal, pointed, and, to us, astonishing disclosure - ' Piel ed up their agents as suggested at Darwin found it easier than expected They took but last offer Suspect nothing Pair of lovely simpletons Arranged with them as instructed purely on results to avoid after complications as to me being their paid servant At present looks as if trouble and money our trouble and their money all wasted thickish map is fraud pine imagination Country at points milked quite different to what he describes Had regard his gold discoveries as hard am Being here, however, I may as well stick to Empire agents as long as possible, on oil chance of then striking anything Prospect good-I like country both for gold and opals I\h plan is if we find will manage to delay pegging the peg for you, and make a dash for Wyndham to register We are on Pomegranate Creek 1 reckon is 13 of Kimberly-not on map -Noah I of " As the whole beautiful plot unravelled it self with the cipher letter under the key, our faces must have been an interesting study "Sold like a Durham 01," was all I said, but Ogilvie was no enraged that had ... been 111 camp just then the consequences might have been Furious ' J lie infernal scoundrel," he exclaimed, "how he lies tucked us" 'The truth was but too painfully evident the whole sitUmnfr, humiliating truth Tox had cunningly masked us by telling us just half the truth 'The instructions by over land who from Melbourne were no doubt correct J o\ ia failed to attach himself to an expedition, but it was ours, not the Ex- ploitation Company s In our eagerness to secure his Benitos 110 had fallen into the trap set for us " "The Exploitation people found that we find the Mount," Ogilvie said, and could not be caught by ordinary means This is then reply to our sudden move, and by love they) don't stick at trifles " In a business such as ours, which is often a conflict of wits, one meets with many things cable surprises, but in all my experience, I never felt so utterly taken aback as with that letter of Fox's staring at me "It's a faces, and no mistake," I said to Ogilvie, ' I feel just now as though I wanted to go aw i> by much and think It might have been worse, though, the thing might have been told us as a good Stock iv change too On our return to England, and how the exploitation fellows would have chuckled' As it issues, I look forward with interest to a that with fir Fox to-night "In the meantime," said Ogilvie, "I wish you would lit at June the use of that letter and that for a while I have a particular reason for asking "
