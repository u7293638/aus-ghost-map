Ever since New South Wales haff togdffl fleg to 'stand on slip lias 'relied on the jjkrantj.pap for susteneuce, and has pushed and jostled with other claimants iu this respect with very fair success. But of late yAri£jil& Motherland, liasf begun ttf evince opldnep |o|^he;off-japring called Australia ; .awl tgnpiuit }? of /jBuotioh ^rcquibi'te gto eli8itvvia Very"small modicum of nourish ment, has generated a desire for the wean ing process more marked on the part of the child than of its pamit. And it is just now; when our^rpgouitonisj^xpectiog usjto turn to ah&MSigi; h|{? fo o^arUiey%\rJen|3-and to bA/e our arms "to"1i["her to sustain botli herself and the encumbrances which her systems have engendered-we, like the generality of childion are desirous of releas r-King-pur§olvoaj; from: control, and branching "©ffl^wlfi^htitllG^woriifM'iourselvesV1 1' j People have talked about this dissolution for a long time liow.ajid somo of our loaders hnvn nxprossed auflrrti adheronce to the tenuis of Federation, but we reckon this proposalto.rai^oj.in^Australia &jloan;,fpart of ^hiQ'h'.wllfgoJtailia^iai to PM^off indebted;! uesS'to-Motiier England, is1, about 'the most . .practical! wove in 'the dii'eotion 'of fedei'al separation which it is possible to con ceive, That Sib GEORGE Dxbbs should be its preceptor is a good sign, as it shows plainly that his English utterances of a few weeks back as an advocate of Imperial Federation were shadowy lispings ; and that he is at heart, and iri backbone a believer in Australia for the Australians, and the devil for the remainder. This fact received pre- eminent exemplification when he burst forth when in the banquet bulls of Great Britain with the assertion that none of the human gutter-scourings of England should be thrown upon Australian shores. It has been customary up to date for -people-in-England, and Australia too, to assert tljat these colonies musfc'continueito ?knuckle down to the .'British. money-lender, aud that >ve are to' bp extricated from every little financial difficulty in which we have become involved solely and wholely by tbo " shent per slienters " over the seas. < This little arraugement has gone on for a time, arid we, aided and abetted by .our natural advantages, rhaye stood, .individually head| aud shoulders above all' contemporaries; ..and,have both, iudivi$|ia}ly and collectively indulged, our i little, caprices and desires!; to -our i full bent, i Phe'money-lender seeing our sleekness, and wondrous verdancy lias assisted us,, wijibjlis' gold and has shaken his' fat sides voluptuously in cachiunation, knowing full well that when .the day of rec^oning^.amvled,«the ;levy and distress wogldj be,- t|»o|Bhflome and - exceeding juicy toJitlie? -= financial .%alate. The 'day of reckoning is on the spot, and we,, like the foolish<virgiuB, ,are. (considerably minus of oil, and the wicks havovanished into thin air. In 'other" words" we have gambled away a rgpod'^sliare. of.our birthright, and the equivalents also have gone, extensively by. the board. Our state coffers are haunted by the ghosts of. overdue, promissory notes, arid those of our neighbors are in a precisely similar predicament; and , times on the whole are positively bad. We have ! never heard 'yet of a. period when those shady spectrpsjmowri as " times " were authenti cally good, but that is irrelevant to the issue, .. ... , ! Our uncles in1 England who have exer cised'a< kind'of pawn-shop affection for us, have>un the'end become .alarmed at our recklessly spendthrift course, arid tliey'have shown'k very1 justifiable.desire to apply the brakes!' Those -^highly' respectable sheets known :as " financial organs have been proliirig us deeply, pouring mustard in the wouiids. rubbing it gently in . at .first, and repeating, the operatian at intervals . with increaisjng ratio* till they have succeeded in scaring- niohied men .into '.fits'.; stopping our credit instanter ; arid have pulled the, fast erft^oF6pgus;prMperii>x up with, such a jerk that the;fra^'ments,(iri the sliape of bubble bursted banks^crorik syndicates, arid!; land boom1 'rogueries) havk; been, pcattered far ancLwide, and the cry of the many'victims has resounded long and tumultuous.through out tlVe . *". ? Therefore, when a man; like SIR GEORGE DismEpsegs a local loan a safe w^jout\pf the difficpjtfi everybody else of course^diioovers it at Cpuce, :and even those ghastly jokists, the Sydney. morning papers, lift'^up itheir voices" irr simultaneous outbursts^ emula tion.::1 At, any rate, we look upon tliis as the sipolje of the knife which is to cut the first strahd'of the painter by which we are bounffc to Britain and Britain's Hebrews; or if our readers like it better it is the first genuine effort promised for the unravel ment of that tangled skein of Anglo-Saxon hypocrisy known as the silken bonds, with a viow to a gradual and painless dismember ment. The possibility that £8,000,000 will be too"large a sum for New South Wales,alone to raise' .will we hope eyolvo offers of assistance from, the moneyed institutions or people of other^colonies, as this will tend in a most practical way to, assist that desirable amalgatriation tending eventually: to an inseparable union which it is the:hope of every true Australian will take place in the near future. That a loan to the people by the people with no intermediary or foreign negotiations, by means of' questionable agencies" or beggarly middlemen, would bo a profitable' investment there can bo no manner of : doubt; at anyrate we hope the scheme .will be met intelligently, and eventually sympathetically,' as we opine it is but the harbinger of a prosperity which shall be built on the sound and unsbiftable bed-jrock of national arid rational govern 'ment-by the nation for the nation.
