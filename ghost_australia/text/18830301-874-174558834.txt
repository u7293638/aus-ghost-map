Death-Day Books. THE latest fashion in Spiritist circles is the Death-Day Books: Every ghost that comes to spend an evening with a party of friends is requested to enter in this book the date upon which he shuffled off this mortal coil. The planchette is produced, the pages are solemnly turned till the Death-Day is arrived at, and then the signature of the ghost is given in the handwriting he used in the flesh. In a Collins-street drawing-room, we were lately shown a Death-Day book that was filled full with the names of illustrious dead. One entry attracted our attention. On the 31st December appeared instead of a name, the figures 1882, and we demanded an explanation from our hostess. " That was a very remarkable circumstance," she replied in an awe stricken voice. "I had the planchette myself, and the geutleman who had possession of me was a ^stranger; though he appeared to know a good deal about me. When I asked him to write his name, he at once complied, and on comiDg to the date you see, he formed the figures you are looking at. ' Who are you my good ghost?" I cried in astonishment..' Madam' he replied, ' I am the Old Year]"' This story, it may be remarked, is absolutely true, so far as the figures and the lady's account of them are concerned.
