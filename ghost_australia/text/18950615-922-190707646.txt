A LOCAL INDUSTRY. The “ Witness ” will complete its sixth year of publication at the end of this month. It still lives, and has no intention of giving up the ghost just yet. However, as a lengthened ex- istence depends on circumstances, we trust that nourishing food will be supplied to the local nursling in the shape of subscriptions and advertise- ments. Most people, we are pleased to say, know the value of a local news paper, and while few only would use it for personal ends, several get their printing done at the newspaper office, advertise (not in vain, we are sure !), find otherwise help to support the local printing office. We have always endeavoured to ran straight, keeping Truth in the foreground. No injurious personalities have been printed in the “ Witness ” since it was first issued. Our object is to do good. Send in your subscriptions and recommend the “ Witness ” to your friends. Don't expect too much ; and whatever follies you may be guilty of don't deprive yourself of the local paper and think that you are saving money thereby. It will pay every local resident to assist the “ Witness,” and next year, we hope, we shall be able to say “ We are seven.”
