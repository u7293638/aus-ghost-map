He moved the following resolution - that. we feel that Mr. Smith has by beaconed iintfti-oiiisiii towards us as r So l) as: evinced In his cowardly) attack on our president forfeited all claim to respect on our part and no challenge that officer to compare before the public the departmental race ds of firemen false and Driver hell) nita that 0 the president 1 he reading of the motion was greeted with loud applause, and the proposer, continuing his remark a said that he did not think that he need pass any continents upon that resolution they could not have a better officer than the president, and his record as an enginedriver would compare favourably with that of any other driver in the world (Cheers ) Another speaker remarked that Mr Smith had pointed out that Driver Kelly had, in the short space of 12 years, raise 1 himself up by his good conduct to the position of a first clubs enginedriver The first question to be asked was whether Kelly was a first class driver because it took others from lb to 20 ears service to reach that grade the next question over-land not favouritism been shown towards Kelly 2 Mr Smith said that Kelly had notes lined his position by favour from his superior officers in all, all that he (thespcaher)eould say it as that he did not know how Kelly had done it I hut man had said that he would not belong to the association because he would not go with the members uni drink at publichouses (Laughter ) Hit) all knew how much that st iterations worth it theregiilationsut the department permitted it and a ballot was taken in the meeting as to the feelings of the drivers and firemen con forming the retention of Kell) in the service, the result would be that that man would be removed from the service. Mr House had spoken against the members of the society, and they could scarcely expect otherwise from that person The next member u he addressed the meeting considers that the action of Mr Smith in condemning their president in the manner in which he had done was something extra ordinary) He did not know how Mr Smith could take a man like their president and say that he had a bad record, and at the B uno time ago that be (Mr Smith) had not a ghost in proof that their president commenced this agitation With regard to the charge of drunkenness preferred against the members, the association would not permit any man who was drunk to stand on the footplate It a mile saw a driver drunk and did not instantly report him Unit man he came the re ii culprit it an accident happened (He is, hear ) The conduct of Mr Smith in fining members for frivolous charges made against them which any other person would miss over in a very different from that of Mr Mirls.

It was again pointed out however, that the meeting was not called to discuss the day I missal of Mr smith, but to show the public that the association had a substantial grievance After some further discussion as to whether the renewal of acting locomotive superintendent should be asked for or not, the mover of the motion withdrew it, and substituted the following in its place - "That we demand the dismissal of Driver kill) on the ground that we consider it unsafe either in the interest of ourselves or the ) utilize, to work with him another representative rose to support the motion as Mr Speight had always listened to any deputation from that society, and he thought that they only had to lay the facts of the case before him and he would give them justice It was a great deal better for the society) to protest than to demand He did not believe, judging by what he knew of Mr Speight character, that he would not give them satisfaction (Hear hear) A member rose to say that his confidence in Mr Speight had 1 pen miserably Clinker Mr Speight might admit the deputation, and give them a fair Hearing and after they had gone I high up his sleeve at thorn to be hoped that Mr. billilli v. nanna) carrying out Mr Speight's wishes in anything that he had don c An amendment was then moved That this association lodges its protest against the retention of the driver held) in the service of the grounds of our own a of the safety of the public A member stated that he would support the amendment but at the same time he believed in the motion.
