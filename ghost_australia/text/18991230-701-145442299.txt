For partles ofibeee (lescripHons invitations are given at short notioe ; daughters are some time* invited witb their parents, and the out fit required is of a tesB elaborate character. * ? ? ? when the prince is thebe. . .When tho frince bf Wales is among tbe ?guests, a ?countiy-hoiHB party reaches its pt^ntof perfection, :and at such an enter taioment tbe question of cost is considered neither by host9 nor by visitors. Wben tbe Prince and Frineess of Wales, or, indeed, one of tbe Royalties, are present, their wishes are deferred to by host and hostess as to the selection ot guests. A - list of the people whom H is proposed to -intdude .as leilOW (jUdBhO U» WW WUf ecrned, is previously submitted to tbe letter by (bo host, and il it be approved the invitations are paomptly sent. Tbe circle of guests invited to meet Royalty is limited to a small, smart, exclusive set, and if aoy outsider be. admitted, he or she must have eome Very special clsim— either in the way of beauty or accomplishment, or possibly of some other kind, to merit an invitation. ? ? » ? BOYAL ETIQUETTE,. A complete set of room) is set apart for the Royal guests, and these include a boudoir for the Princess and a sitting-room tor tbe Prince. 4It is only un very rare occasions that a Royal Princc joins tbe host, hostess, and otber guests at breakiast, but be Is usually present at luncheon and dinner. Tbe PrincesB ot Wales never appears at break, fast. Wben tbe party ere assembled fer luncheon or dinner, both hosts and guests remain standing while awiting the appearance of tbe Itoyal guest, and when be appears a move is at once made to the dining-room. If the Prince and Princess of Wales are both present, tbe hoct lends tbe way with tbe Princess, the Princc with the hostess following next. If tho Prince alone be present, be tubes the lead with the lady oi tbe bouse, the host bringing np tbe ond of the long procession with the lady who happens to stand text iu point ol precedence. After dinner, when Royalty is present, it is not customary for the hostess to make tbe usual move to Indicate tbat she wishes the ladies to gl to tbe drawing-room, but to wait for ber Royal guest to indicate his pleasure as to when he wishes tbe dinner brought to an end. « * * « HUSBANDS AND WIVES. At bouse parties such as these, everything is arranged for the amusement of the fortun ate guests, and witb the object ot making tbe affair 'go off'' well. Invitations are given months in advanoe, and are regaided as a soared engagements. Husband? aid wives are often invited separately, as each is sup posed to sbine to greater advantage tthen alone, and, if a married man is both a good shot and a ' good fellow,' be is safe to be passed on trom boose to honse through th: entire shooting season. His wife, if pretty, popular, and smart, will be equally certain of ber share of amusing invitations. Girls with a few brilliant exceptions, are at a decided j disoount in op to-date country booses. ] » » » . . » AT IABLE. Breakfast is an elastic meal — x ' movable feast ' for all concerned— the women of the patty having the choice of breakfasting in their own rooms, it tbey prefer to do -so.
