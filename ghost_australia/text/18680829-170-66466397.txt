Tbe Brisbane Courier of the 16 tb inst. contains the following paragraph ?— ' It is pretty well known that tbe illustrious stranger who lately honoured our poor city with his presence undtr the style, title, and dignity of the Count von Attem, is the individual who, in our Sydney telegram on Tuesday, was said to bate obtained large a-i- vances in that city on fictitious papers. We are sorry to lay that he managed, during his short stay bure. to walk into tbe graces of some of our citizens, and to make rather heavy drafts on their bankers. His counuhip, it will be remembered, left Brisbane in that renowned cralt the Hamlet's Ghost, the hiitory of which vestal ought to be ivrittnn tome day; and be has last been beard of at Cleveland Bay. A warrant is out for his apprehenuitn, and troopers have been dispatched overland from Port Denison to secure him if possible betort he makes a descent on our friends in Batavia. We failed to notice the Count as he deserved when he wai in Brisbane ; but should he visit us again, especially with tbe order which the Sheriff of Queensland detires to confer on him on his breast, and Mr Seymour's decorations on bis wrists, we shall endeavour to make amends for our former neglect of' Son Altesso.'
