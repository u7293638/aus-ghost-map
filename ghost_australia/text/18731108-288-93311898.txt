00N8EGRATIQN- .- OF - THE VERY REV. FATHER JREYNOLDS AS ROMAN CA.THOLIC BrsHOP OF ADELAIDE. The ceremony of 'consecrating the Very Bev. Father Reynolds, recently Administrator of the Diocese, as Roman Catholic Bishop of Adelaide, took place at St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral, on Sunday, November 2. Father Beynolds is greatly beloved by. the members of his own Church, and by his kindness and courtesy be has secured the re-pect *&&? - e«teem^ '' a very large number of persons who are; not Boman Catholics. No doubt his elevation te the charge of the diocese ^tli meet with very general'approval.;; He was born in Dublin in 1834, and was educated in a Carmelite Convent nearthatcity. Subsequently he spent two or three years in the Bene diotine .monastery; of Lublaoe in. the Papal: States; and froin theno« s« went to Western Australia, staying there about two yejirs, and then coming on. to South' Australia in 1857. He was ordained in this colony by ^ishop Geoghegan in April, I860 ; and during his residence here; Father Bsynolds has been stationed at Wallaroo, Mprphett Vale, and Gawler. He was living at the latter place when he was appointed, on the death of Bishop SheH, Admisutratori of the Diocese. The teohsesration of? a Bishop being a novelty in Ade laide, it is not snrprLdng that considerable in t«rest was excited iong before the evens took place, and that the .interest ma inteasified as the day apprpached, and-.as dignitaries of the Boman Catholic Ohurc4i,iinclading the Arch biahop (Dr. Polding) arrived to take part in the ceremony. . Under-the owmuutanpos it was but natural to suppose that the iflervioe/ would be, as it was, yery- larfely attended, for it was : knewn that.; ion a this occssipn the imposing ritual of the Boman Oatholib Church -would, bs. seen in all its grandeur; and certainly tuch a spectacle was never before witnessed in Adelaide. The Cathedral - had ieen improved in Tfoiotts particulars, and amongst them the roof of the chanoel had been1 cOUred blue, relieved by gold stars. Th« arrangements were perfect, Archdeacon Bussell and Father Kehoe acting as Masters of the OerempnieB. 1 ?Punctually at 10 o'clock the procession Into the church began. First came the sanctuary bpys,;preceded by the Cross ; then the acolytes, 'followed by the priests of the diooosa. Fathers Hughes, O'Oonner, Kennedy, Qainlan, Bon gaerts, Van der Heyden, Moore, Sullivan, MoCloske.t, PaUhuber, and Hager. Next in order were the Bishops, with their Chaplain, as follow:— The Bishop of ' Hobart Town (Or. Murphy), ChaphuBy Or. O'Connor; the Bishop of Bathurst (Dr. Qiiian), Chaplain, Father Corcoran ; the Bishop of Maltland (Dr. Murray), Chaplain, Father Burke; and the Bishop Elect of Adelaide (gather Reynolds), wuapisiu,. vary . .ever, fatcer *appeuier. jjasc camevthe Arohbishop (Dr. Polding) with his Chaplains, Father Cslletti, and Very Bev. Father Strale Superior at SevenbiU. College). The Archbishop.who, although an octogenarian, was very effflctive in bis important part of tbe; sendee, wore a black, cassock with the usual accompaniments, the Bishops pf Hobart -Town, and Sathurt wore copes and mitres, but the Bishop: of Maitland, not having directly to assist ia the consecration, appeared in the ordinary Bishop's dress - of purple. . ' Father Reynolds' had a cope, but in the' place -of a mitre he wore a biretum. The Archbishop on ascending' the throne was -robed by Father Oolletti in the rich Gothic vestments of his offios, the chasuble being extremely handsome, as were also, in a minor degree, the chasubles of the other prelates. The ceremony of consecration, which of course was entirely in Latin, was then proceeded with. The Bishop Elect was . conducted by the two assistant' Bishops -Vet ore the Archbishop, the Censecrator, who' occupied a seat in. front ' of th« altar; and the Bishop of Hobart Town, addressing the Conseorator, said — 'Most reverendFather— Our Holy Mother, the Catholic Church, requires that you raise this Priest here present to the charge of the Episcopate.' The Cpnsecrator — ' Have yon the .apostolic man date?' . The Bishop of Hobart Town— 'We have,' The Consecrator— ' Let it be read.' The Very Rev. Father Syne, Consecrator's notary, then read- the mandate ; and sabae quentlyjthe Bishop. Elect, kneeling .before the Cpnseqrator, read the oath of spiritual fealty and pb'ediance. -Then the Consecrator, holding with both his hands , the book of the Gospels open on his knees, with its lower margin to wards the Bishop, Elect, administered the oath, which *eing done, the Oonsecrator said — ^.Thanksbe to God.' After this the latter read distinctly, .and the assistant Bishops in a low voice, jthefoUowmgexainination,all three wearing their mitres :— The Conseorator— 'JThe/ancient disciplinB of . tha Holy Fathers / taaehes ' and enjoins that he who is elected to the order of 4he Episcopate be first most diligently examined with all charity on the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and be interrogated on diverse causes, andcondacfc conformawe't* this diraity, and necessary to be kept aooordiag to the saying of the Apostle, -Lay hands on no one qplckly/ Both that he who is to be ordained ' be InstrKcted how «ne constituted- under tills authority ought to oonverse inthe Church of: God, and -that those who lay on him their biudm for his ordination may be blameless.: By the: same authority and command, them, deirly beloved brother, with sinoere charity, we ask of you if youwHl, as far as your nature is capable, beud all your understanding to' the meaning of the Divine 8cripture ?'

The Oonsecrator—' Will yon, to the utmost of your power, bv the help of the Lord, restrain your conduct from all evil, and torn it to all good P ?/ The/ Bishop JKlect-'I will.' The Con. seorator— ' wSl you, with the help of God. observe, keep, and teach, chastity and sobriety?' The Bishop Klect-'* I wiU.' The Oonaeorator — 'Will you be always employed in divine things, and disentangled-' from earthly husi ness or filthy lucre, as far as human frailty wiU-allp^?' The Bishop Elect— 'I will.'

The BUhop Elect— ' I wilL' The Consecrator— 'Do you believe, according to your - understanding, and the capacity of your reason, in the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one God Almighty, and the -whole Godhead in the Holy Trinity, co easential, con-sabstantitvl, co-eternal, and co omh'potent, of one will, power, and majesty, the Creator of all creatures, from whom, by .whom, and in whom, and all things which are lu Heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, corporal and spiritual?' The Bishop Elect— ' I agree, and bo X believe.' The Con Mentor— ' Do fQU believe that each einale person in the Hply Trinity is tiM one God, truly, fnlly, and perfectly?' The Bishop Elect—' I believe.'. The Conse orator—' Do yon believe 'that the very Son of God, the Word of God, eternally bom of the Father, con-substantial, co-omnipotent, and, co-equal in all respects to the Father in Di vinity, bem in time by the Holy Ghost of Mary, ever Virgin, with a rational soul, having two births— one of the Father, eternal, the other of His Mother, temporal, truejaod, and true man, not adoptive nor seeming, but 'the only one Son of God in two, and of two natures, but. n the ?ingnlarity of one person, impassible and im mortal by his divinity, but who suffered for us and for our salvation in His humanity by a true passion in the flesh, was buried, and rising - again from the dead on the third day, by a true resurrection of the flesh ; on the fortieth day after His resurrection, in the flesh, with which He rose again, and His soul, He ascended to heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father ; that He will come thence to judge the living and the dead, and will lender to every one according to his works, whether they be good or evil?' The Bishop Elect — 'I agree, and so I believe in all particulars.' The Consecrator—' Do you believe also that the Holy Ghost is fully, perfectly, and truly God,* proceeding from the Father, and the Son, — co-equal and co-essential, co- omnipotent 'and co eternal in every respect with the Father and the Son?' The Bishop Elect— 'I believe.' The OonBecrator— ' Do you believe that this Holy Trinity is not three Gods, but one God, almighty, eternal, invisible, and unchange able T The Bishop Elect— ' I believe.' The Coaseorator — 'I-o you believe that the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Churoh is the one true Church, in which is given the one true baptism, and true remission of all sins ?' The Bishop Elect—' . I believe.' The Consecrator — ' Do you also anathematise every heresy lifting np against the Holy Catholic Church?' The Bishop Elect— 'I anathematise it.' The^Consecrator — 'Do you believe also in a true resurrection of the same flesh with which yon are now clothed, and ever lasting life?' The Bishop Elect— 'I believe.' The Oonsecrator—' Do you believe also that the ITew and Old Testaments, the Law and Prophets and Apostles came from the one God and Lord Almighty ?' The Bishop Elect—' I believe.' The Oonsecrator — ' May this your faith, dearly beloved brother in Christ, be.increased to true and eternal happiness.' Tbe BUhop Elect was then led to the OonBe crator, whose hand he kissed, whereupon the latter, laying aside his mitre, began the con fiteor, the mass being proceeded with as far as the last verse of the sequenoe. In '.the mean time the Assistant Bishops led the Bishop Eleot to his own chapel, where he laid asiae the cope, and was vested with the sandals, pectoral cross, tunic, dalmatic, chasuble, and maniple, and, going? to his own alter, read the mass down to the came point as the Conse crator, who, when that was reached, informed the Bishop Elect that 'it is ths office of a Buhop to judge, interpret, consecrate, ordain, offer sacrifice, baptize, and confirm ;' and then, turning to the congregation, said — ' Let us pray, dearly beloved brethren, that the good ness of Almighty God, watchful for the good of His Church, may grant to this Elect the riches of Hisgraca.' The Litany of the Saints was then sung, and at its close the Bishop Elect knelt before the Consecrator, who, with the Assistant Bishops, laid the book of the Gospels open on the neck and shoulders of the Bishop -Eleot, whose head was then touched by the prelates, and the words uttered ' t- eceive the Holy Ghost,' after which the Consecrator said, Mercifully receive our supplications, O Lord ! and inclining over this Thy servant, the horn of priestly grace, pour out upon him the virtue of Thy blessing, through Jesu* Christ our Lord.' Another, prayer having been offered, Father Ooletti bound with a napkin the head of the Bishop Elect, and after the hymn ' Veni Creator' had been sang, the Consecrator, with the holy chrism, formed the sign of the cross over the whole crown of the head of the Bishop Eleot, and anointing him, said : — ' May this, O Lord, flow plenteously on his head ; may it descend' through the very extremities of his frame, that the virtue of Thy spirit may both fill his interior and surround his exterior. May constancy of faith, purity of love, sin cerity of peace abound in him. May his feet, by Thy grace, be beautiful to preach the gospel of peace, to manifest Thy goodness. Give him, O Lord, the ministry of reconciliation in word and deed, in the virtue of signs and words.' May his discourse and preaching be not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the showing forth of the spirit and virtue. Give him, O Lord, the keys of the kingdom *f heaven, that he may use and not glory in the power which Theu bestowest for edification, not for destiuction. May what ever he shall bind on earth be bound also in Heaven ; and whatever he shall loose on earth be loosed also in Heaven. May his Bins be retained whose sins he shall retain ; and his be for given whose he shall forgive. May he be filled with blessings whom he shall blesB. May he be a faithful and prudent servant whom Thou, O Lord, mayest place over Thy family, that he may give them food iu due season, and show every man perfect. May he be diligent in care* fulness, -fervent in spirit. May he hate pride, love humility and truth, and never abandon it, overcome by praise or fear. May he not set up light for darkness, nor darkness for light. May he not say that evil ia good, or good is eviL May he be debtor to the wise and the unwise, that he may gather fruit from the maturity of : all. Grant him, O Lord, the episcopal throne, to rule Thy Church and the people committed to him. Be Thou his authority, his power, his bulwark. {Multiply over him Thy blessing -f and favor, that through Thy bounty he maybe ever fitted for imploring Thy mercy, and by Thy grace be ever devout. Through Jesus Christ our Lord.' The hands of the Bishop Elect were then anointed, and a pastoral crozi-er and a ring presented to him, both prior to presentation being sprinkled with holy water. After theB3 ceremonies the Consecrator . and- the Assistant Bishop3 gave to the Conse crated the kiss of peace, saying ' Peace oe to you,' to wnicn ne answered 'and with your spirit.' The Conseorated afterwards offered to the Consecrator two lighted torches, two loave^, and two barrels of wine, and kissed his hand as he accepted them. They then went to the same altar and proceeded together in the mass, there being only one Host and one chalice for both. The Consecrated received the communion from the Conseorator standing. Subsequent to the Mass, a mitre and also gloves, both having previously been ble Bed and sprinkled with holy water, were presented to the Consecrated ; after which he was enthroned in the seat before the alter from which' the Consecrator had risen. Turning to the altar he began the Te Deum, and whilst that was being eung, the Consecrated was led by the Assistant Bishops, mitred, through the charoh, giving his bless ing to all as he passed along. On] return ing, prayers having been said, the Conrecrator and the Assistant Bishops assumed their mitres, and turned towards the epistle aide, to which the Consecrated had gone, who, turning towards the Conseorator. and kneeling, with his mitre and -pastoral staff, said, 'For many years' — repeating the words before the middle a-ltar, and again at the feet of the Consecrator, raising his voice each time. He then received the kiss of peace from the Conseorator, and also from the Assistant Bishops, who conducted him to his own Chapel, he the while repeating a por tion of the Gospel of St. John, which the Cen secrator, at the same time, was reading in a low 'voice at the altar. The Conseorator then put off his sacred vestments at his throne, and the ceremonial part of the service was at an end. The Bishop of Maitland . then ascended the pulpit and delivered a sermon from the text — ' Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock over which the Hely Ghost hath placed you Bishops to rule the Church ot God which he hath purchased with His] own blood.' — Acts of the Apostles, chap, xx., v. 28. These words, dearly beloved brethren, which I have quoted from the Acts of the Apostles, were addressed by the great Apostle of the Gentiles to the ancients of the Church of Ephesus with the view of calling their attention to the high commision entrusted to them by God of feeding the people confided to their care, of instructing them iu sound doctrine, of preserving them from poisonous pastures, and protecting them from the inoursions of the ravenous wolve», who, after his departure, would enter in among them, not sparing the flock. They were addressed, too, under circumstances that could net but make a. lasting impression on the nlergy of Ephesus, for he hud out no hope of ever seeing them again. ' And now behold, bound in the Spirit I go to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befal me there, only that the Holy Ghost in every city witnesseth to me, saying that chains and afflictions wait for me at JeiUialem. And now behold I know that all you among whom I tuye gone preaching the kingdom of God thall \- v; -V; *=* l}r ???-' ''^??;'r0 '?'

It is always, my dear brethren, a solemn thing to; witness the trauBmissuMrof the Apostolic Office — an act bf which the Ohuroh renews her vigor,j provides for her preservation and expansion. As the plants throw out the seeds! $hat produce t-ther plants which take their place- when they, have themselves decayed, Bbrt&e-JhuTch;,; or-; ganised by Christ, preserves her life and Integ rity, and meets the exigencies; of the hour by, the transmission of the Apostolic 'Office,* with! all its duties, its graces, and its responsibilities,; from age to age, from generation to generation,} from her duly ordained ministers to others&p-;* pointed and called by Ooi to tiie sublime «moej of the Apostolate. These circumstances all! combined, my dear brethren,eannot:hnt fill you! with joy*, and cause you to rejoice at seeing, one, I may* almost say: taken from among yourselves and placed over you. to guide and; direct you in the ways of salvation, charged with the onerous duty of governing this vast; diocese, with a full knowledge of ail its wants' and requirements. But for you, my- Lord,? placed »b .you are today as awa'chmanimthe' towers ofr Israel; whose light is this day placed] on the ca&dlestiok;, on whose BoulQod'tmprintsj a character that disiingnishesyoufromaU other; men now and for evermore, it is jin -event o£ very great concern. Christ this day makea^ou a commander of His hosts, wih*114;he powers' .and with all the graces attached to that high; position.. The' tJhnroh, which is His agent'in this great work, has endeavored to Impress' them on you in the beautiful ceremonial which! we are all witnessing with such' delight, T»nd which causes .you to approach in fear and' . trembling the venerable pontiffs who by .the' imposition of their hands pour upon, you the; Holy Spirit of God, .that by His power yea may! be strengthened 'tofeed the nookof God which is among you, taking oars thereof not by eon.-' straint, but willingly, according to God, neither; for the sake of filthy lucre, but sroluntarily, neither as domineering over the clergy,; bat being made a pattern of the flock front -the heart.' While all around you, both prelates^ priests, and people, are. joyful at yohr^eleTO tion to the Episcopate, you, my Lord^ deeply impressed with the awful responsibiKty of 4he dignity.to which yen have been,cihrpugh the mercy of God, raised to-day, -seem, if I rightly] interpret the sentiments of your 'ramost^aoiiD to beg our united prayers that the XThuroh if Adelaide may have in you a wbithy - and useful Administrator, so that when -the 'Educe of Pastors shall appear you shall Teceive: a . never-fading crown' of glairy. Impressed with \- the same spirit, and entoiiiiginto.your feelings,' I shall endeavor to point out the £uties of your office, so that all, realising *b some, extent its heavy burden, anay sympathise witH you in the anxieties that press on.' you heavily! just how, may ajd'yon hy theirptayers; ju∈ the course of yonr Episcopate-^ which I trust ? will be a long and useful one-r-mayrby *heuf docility and obedience, alleviate :its «aresjan4 lessen its numerous responsibilities. 'When sof^ old the- word of the Lord, came .to, Jeremias.i sanctifying him and making' him ajprpphet unto the nations, He said tohim ''PSTiatsoerer I shall; command thee theu shalt apesk. Be not afraid. . at theirpresence, for I am with- thee to deliver thee. Behold I have given my words in tby. mouth; so I have set thee.thi?. day over the; nations and over kingdoms 'to irbpt, up ,and toi pull down, -tb waste and to aestrby, aad toi build and to plant.' Thou therefore Jgird |ip thy; loins and arise and speak to them &'ti thajfc I command thee. Bo not afraid, at their pre sence, for I will make thee not to fear their countenance. For 'beheld I have made thee this day a fortified city and a pHar of iron and; a wall of brasB over all the land, to the Kings of Ju4ah, to the /princes thereof,, and **» 'the, priests, and to the people of the. land.' ^.TJyj these words, my brethren, a solemn mission was given to the' holy Jeremias, who for; that purpose was sanctified ia his mother's womb. He was commissioned to speak and preach sot only to the Jews, but, even to the* Gentiles, He was to forewarn, both Kings and; Princes of the land, and the priests and people, of the dreadful calamities that would befal them if they were not converted to the .'Lord./ His mission was not so much to wasteor to destroy ^ but rather to admonish tbem to avoid . theeba*; tisements of Heaven, and to exhort ibejn to abandon the wicked ways of sin, the cause of all the miseries which had covered the land. Bnt the missioa with which our, young Bishop is ? charged to-day is of a far higher import, cpm}1 prises 'far greater powers and prerogatives, and therefore conveys graces more numerous .and more significant, symbolised by the 'beauty, the magnificence and variety of the ceremonial at which we. have all assisted with such profit* Christ confers on hi«n to-day not only the power of speaking, teaching, and reproving, bat he imparts to hinx the power never vouclte&fed.t;^ hi* angels in heaven of binding an4 loosing with the fall assurance that the sentence pronounced by him here on earth shall be ratified and con firmed in heaven. The words addressed by Our Lord to his Apostles are not only. repeated'lxy the three prelates who takeapartin the consecration to-day, but their wondrous significance is asf ul'y realised as when pronounced by 'Christ himself, 'As the Father hath sent He so I also; send you. All. power is given to Me in Heaven' ana on earth. Go ye therefore aral4»ach\aU.iiat'ion*i baptising them in the name of the' Father-and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, /'teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world ;f by which words the Apostles were .not; -only appointed Christ's messengers to ~ speak, to preach, and to reprove, but .they were made the possessors of these powers and the trea- surer* of His Heavenjy gifts. And in such a way did they inherit these powers that whoso ever would reject them would be .rejecting God. himself. *'Be that -heareth yon heareth Me'; he that despiseth you deepiseth Me.' Behold, my dear brethren,- what we 'witness here to-day — the fullness and perfection of the priesthood conferred on your Fishop, that haiinay exercise i*s functions for the advantage of both priests ; and people, and dispense i»s wonderful graces to the souls of men. Truly he is set np to day as a master ia Israel, as a faithful senti nel on the heights of Mount Zion to ' guide and direct, to build and to plant, to root up and- pull down, to waste and to destroy, to exercise for a time the wondrous powers of the eternal priesthood of Christ, to sanctify your souls in His name, and to raise them tip ' from ' the ' sorrows of this valley of tears to Heavenly bliss and glory everlasting. Yes, my brethren, I repeat it, it is not simply a declaratory power with which he. is invested, but a real life-giving power is conferred on him by which he shares God's heavenly gift*, that he may convey them to his fl ock. and dispense foed. medicine, and whatever else they need, amid the toils and dangers of their pflgrimage here on earth. And, my brethren, if to-day your Bishop becomes the treasurer of greater powers and blessings than were vouchsafed of old to the Prophet Jeremias, we seed not be ashamed to confess that the miseries and calaauties whioh have come upon the world in this age of boasted civilization and progress point out to us the necessity of their being dispensed in season aad out of season {or the benefit of the faithfuL who are continually led astray by the-false maxims of the world, and by the perverse teaching of false prophets. For never perhaps before was the Church of Chrirt, her Supreme Head, and her Bishops engaged in such a deadly warfare as. in the present age. If Jersmiag were set np by Poi as a prophet to the cations end made a fortified city, a pillar of j iron and a waUvf'irass^'because- tot *h« 'eyO* %hit then pre^led, hoV mtic'h more nedfeBsary noif-a-daya, when the Kings »ndPjinces;of *h» world have'all oonspired against tJhrist and His anointed, ana *re«et up-io. battle-rray againit His holy Church j and when, tbtue'the words of the Fathers of 'Ihe VaticanX3otoaV*'^o6a» ing efforts are made by modern rationausm to banish Christ our £prd and bur .Saviour from the minds of men, and'frbm the Hfe and cos tomrof the nation* ;*K6w^u6h]^i«neofssaf)r, l«ay,*is it that those, who are appointed rulers of the pharch of God should 'bl9 iiUed with His Holy Spirit, and furnished -with i& the weapons necessary /to fight a gbod- Tfignt.to ' preserve the faith, and to folfil their mMstry.

I have i^e ATcnb^BhopB-auQ Biflhops of Ireland, which wa« - presented tothe British Parliament ia the year ]$H, ? that is to say, five years before 'Cathouo emancipUien, .when, the Irish Cftthqlios wereieng^ted in {heir great struggle ?to live as free citizens in their native laud. - It ahows that, .though tha Catholic j of Ireland were at thatttimB^isbarred from the exercise of their civil 'rights and privilegec, the slavery and- sufferings, unier -which they groaned For almoBt^hnie, hundred years, only had the effect of Triaitjng , them more s^edjEast-j'n their faith, and more; attached to the jpnaciples and prac tices of^theM' holy religion.- I quote the follow |ng postage from the petition to which I refer. They say ' that in ihei Roman Catholic Church the literary and religious ^instruction of youth are univewally combined, and that no syatsm of education which separates them can be ac ceptable to the members of -her Communion; that the ^religious instruction of youth in Ca tholic schools is always conveyed by means of catechetical instruction, daily prayer, and the reading of religious JbookB, wherein the Gospel morality is explained and inculcated; that Boman , Catholics have ever considered the reading of the sacred Scriptures by children as an inadequate 1 means of imparting to them re ligious instruotiod, - as a usage whereby the word fof God . is made liable to irravereac?, youtb.f exposed 'to' misunderstand its meaning, end thereby not unfcequently to receive in early life, impressibnB wMchJ may af ferwards prove injurious to their ; own 'best interest?, as well as to those of the sooLety which they are destined to form ; that schools whereof the master professes a religion different from that of his pupils, or from whioh i^uch religious in struction as the Catholic Church prescribes for youth is excluded, or in whioh books and tracts mot sanctioned by it are read or commented on, cannot be resorted to by the ohildren of Roman Catholics ; and that threats and rewards have been found equally unavail ing as a means of inducing Catholic parents to procure education- for their ohildren from such persona ox in luoh schools ; that any system of eduaaiion 'incompatible with the discipline of 'the ' Catholic Charch, or superintended ex clusively by persons professing a religion dif ferent rfrom -that of the vast majority of the Tibor bf 'Ireland; cannot possibly be acceptable to the latter, and must in its progress be slow -and embarrassed^ generating often distrust and diBCord, as well ts a want of that mutual good faith and perfect^ confidence; which should pre vail' between those who receive benefits and those who dispense them.' -These word*, written so' inany years ago by the prelates of -Irelatia'j s%emcBb' appropriate to: the wants of the present day/in these colonies that— although: I admit we .are liring under very different cir icumBtanoesj and 'enjoying the rights granted to -4is allunder the Ooastitution — I' have taken .the f liberty of qaoting them, - ? We Catholics profess xmr belief in the Scriptures, but at the same time we declare that neither the con-' soieabejthe Teason,'th« light, nor the moving: 'spirit 01 each individual is the legitimate inter preter of them, but the Church ef God, the pdlaraHd- ground of truth, to which has been ehtrUBfed the deposit of the faith that «he may guard and protect itfer the enlightenment and guidance of her ohildrenjpand hand it down, un tarriiBhed' andnnsuUied; without chanife, spot, or wrinkle, from generajtion to generation, until time shall be, no jinpre. ; 1, am; well aware that .the course pursued by the /Catholics of this and other colonies, and especially by the cBishopB in regard to educatiop, has frequently beenmade the subject of severe strictures and opmments,- It has been said: thvt we desire to have the whole education of tbe country in bur own hands, to enforce sonr views not only on our own .flocks, but even on those who differ -from us in religion. We are charged with the desire ?to. appropriate to pur own purposes, and accord ing to'our own. views, the public funds destined for. the educational: interests of the colonies. It has, been said, notwithstanding our, repeated ?assurances to the contrary, that, we tobject to our aohools being, inspected and examined as to .the /character of the. teaching given in hthem, .and as to their general efficiency, by /Govern- jment , offioials^ or by those duly appointed . by :the Boards of Education. We have only to states in : reply, what -we have repeatedly. said before. .The Bishops,, as in duty bound, are ,makingeyery Bacrifice to Becura a good Catholio eiucatioa fyr their own flock; they declare .that in: the discharge of their solemn duties as rulers of a portion of the Church of Christ, and chiejE paBtors of His flook, areBponsible to *,h» P/^nca of Pastor* forievery. soul committed to their' charge, it is their firat and paramount duty to attend to the. pastures, in which the little ones of the .fold-: are fed, ? and to the .doctrines with which they.are -nourished. But the ^rights^hich the Bishops and ci0at(iplics of these colonies claim forthemselves they cheer fully, grant-to . . those '. of other -communions. If' they preffir mixed educatioh, as far, as we rare' concerned, '.-by, all. means, let them haver .it; ? and. ehould - any-.1, other- sys Um -t» agreeable to any. ' particular sect, let ? them have their way, and let them - be , entailed to a proportiosate sharo of the public funds destined for educa tion, provided tiie secplar'teaehing be found on enquiry and examination by the duly appointed Inspectors, to' satisfy ihe_requirementB of the law. rWeOathoJics, on *h» other fend, shall ?be always ready; to 'admit the. Inspectors into our flcKbolfl to examine thdr state and efficiency, and if , on a fair and impartial examination, they arje founfl not to reach the standard ,astte the course of ; secular teaching, let' 'the Govern' merit aid 'be 'withdrawn.

Behold, 'my J*jord,( the gteat misrion which is placed in your hjandJi tb*-day. tifT. Jeremias, t*'£e Prophet, you are made a fortified. city to defend this diocesb, to secure a good Catholic education for its Catholic people.

Forf behold. I, have made1, you this day a for-: tified city, and 'a pillir of iron, and - wall of brass over all the land, to the Kings of Judah, to the Princes thereof, and to the Priestg, and to the people of the land. Be not afraid of their presericej for I will makeihea not to fear their: cottasenance, and they shall fight against ihee, andshaU not prevail. For I am with thee, skjth the 'Lord,, to deliver thee. And our Divine Jiedeemer, whin sending his Apostles on theaa'ns mission with which he charges you iq-iiUy, he annonnce I to them that they woiiLl b'e brought before Governors, and before Kings, and Ji6 said :=— '* But when they shall deliver you jap, be not thoughtful how or what tb speak, for it shall bi given you ia that hour what to speak. 'For it is not you that' speak, but the spirit 'of the Father thit speaketh ia you.' But it was not only to the.K|ng8and Princes of Judah Jeremias was Bent, but' .to the priests and people of the land ; and So you to-day, my Lord, are appointed the guide, the lig'b.t.-.and Fathar-of both priests and people in this vast Diocese. It is true that the priests now under your juriadicioa are, in many respects, like you— the helpeis of God, Sis agents and- instruments, freely co operating with; Ghrist in that great work which He -prizea bo highly, oa^which 'His, heart -was se| froin eternity, .which*, caused Him to come down to this ear h, Jor which He labored aid died. They are your equals in that which is most. inbUoiei— theojffpring of the great sacrifice, and. the adypibistra.tion of ,many of ,jthe eacra merits,.BixtIyoTi now poBsesB this power in its f ulnees; and, moreover, it isunderyo.ar %'uthoritr that they discharge their duties and exercise the solemn functions of .the ministry.' It is for you to assign to eich one hu sphere of action, to quiokeji, rule, and direct, to be the eye that Bee's all, that watches over all, that is account able to God and responsible to men for all. To you a'one belongs -that authority which is the jjaardiap i-jmjl ..the pledge bf f-tiihful adherenc; to 4uty;in this ppr^tioa of the vineyard of the Lord._ You have only to consider the various figures under which ...the Church , of God, and yoaif relalions to %i, are rt presented to form a cerreefc. idea of the character of your sacred bffi;?. The Church you know is represented as the spouse; of Jesus Chrisr, purs and unde ?filed, not haviog spot or wrinkle. Her purity ia entrusted to your guardianship. It is for y.-u. with the powerful weapons which God has placed in your hands, to preserve that purity, and to war against aU that would taroish her beauty. If '& this Church of Adelaide during her long ! widowhood has suffered frost any abuses or irregularities that m«.y.have crept in, it will be ybur duty to rt move them. Tou are called en fey jthe nature of your, office to pro'eot and defend her, land to wage an incessant war agrinst aU that would ' sully her fair name. Again, tha Church is representei as an army in battle array, and you are placed at the he id of this army to guide and direct it in the gre«.t battle in which all aro engaged against the world, tho fhBb. and the devil. All your flock are, ia-Jeed, fighting in the same cause, but uu4er your authoiiny an«l com mind. And if you fail for want of vigilance, or singleness of purpose, or devoted* ness, it 'will be vain to expect victory from tho bravery of those under your^ charge. The Church ,ia a ship bearing a. precious freight to the heavenly port through the troubled sea of this world, and you are its -pilot appointed to eteer it through the rocks and quipkeanda that TT~, ? ^T — ; ? , . ? .-. . - -.........: : .are eure to came in her way in .whatever course j you' may direct it.' If you fail in a vigilant eye or a steady hand, nothing but confusion among those who are under your care, and total wreck, will be their lot. The Church; is a house — the ' house of God ; you are a steward in that house ; to you are- committed all its treasures. Be a faithful steward, so that on the last day you may have to rejaica .that you have been -Ood's faithful minister in dispensing the' treasures that were / entrusted, to your safe keeping. Onerous duties- have been imposed! upon yon. to-day ; aU {four efforts.. Jmust bel directed to the jnjerests ofThu Church of Adelaide, to. which you are now wedded by an almost ? indissoluble bond, xymbolts d by the .ring which has been put upon your finger. The cross too has been, placed, on your breast to remind you that you will have trials and afflic tions which must be- borne with all: meekness and patience, and the staff which you beir in! your hand reminds 'you' of . the power, and authority which you have received -from, Jesus Christ for the edification of the people entrusted to. your pastoral care. And yet, my Lord, how different is your position^ from that of the Prophet 'Jeremias, to whom it, was announced by. the Lord: that: not.: only the Kings of. Judah. and the Princes thereof, but also the priests, and the people, should ; fight agunst him, and yet he was to fear them .not. butjou, my,Lord, are here today, sur rounded by .your priests and faithful people, who have come here to testify their affection, their loyalty, and obedience to your sacred person, and to assure you that' nothing will be wanting on theirpart to lighten theheavj respon sibilities bfybur sacred office. ? . Yes,, my Lord, you. wHlallow me to say, before I conclude, the position you hold ought to encourage and bus-; tain you in discharging the onerous duties which you r undertake to-day. . . The prelates, the clergy, and the people prostrate before the; altar of God in' this noble Cathedral^ have offered their; fervent and united prayers that you may be' endowed with that strtbgth and fulness of the Spirit of 'God, to govern this diocese with wisdom, moderatiop, and firmness.
