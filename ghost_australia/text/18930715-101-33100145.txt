WAT FEARFUL FISH. A MATHEMATICAL MALEDICTION. Br L'AMBOBO. Everyone, even Macaulay!* ghastly school-. boy, knows to their unlimited sorrow, that awi al jinglo about a ".red trip slip for a three'oent fare, and punch brother, punch,' punoh with care, puuoh in the présenos of the paeîengaré." I ref rain from quo iog it in foll,' or evatt correctly, (ot the sake of the vvbole,' haman race. The man who would willingly and of utaliee afmethought revive it and set' it going, in its infernal abd eternal jingle; deserves to be tied ap for the reBt of his natural life with his head stuffed into a steam organ. I Was haunted by thiB for weeks, and oBly reeevere'l in time to catch tbe 14.15.13 puzzle fever. By. this I was: completely thrown', and many years* of, violent mathematical prostration was the' subséquent result. But now I am the victim of another mathematical putzle, which haunts ' me night and day.

The answer to this jig three milcB, and it does not seem altogether as preposterous as some answers I have got by applying this universal rule. To every- thing I sea, to everyone I meet, I unoon , toioualyapply this rule. If I met the ghost of my'departed grandmother X should, after the nrst euprise was over, begin to wonder that if ber tail weighed 7UJB. and tho rest of bersptrttuous anatomy weighed half as much as ; her tail and four times aa muoh as bet head, how muoh her halo would weigh Ï Nothing I feel will relieve me but the scalp of the rat-trap urchin, and I ean no longei resist the temptation to be free from tbis 'wild and barrassihg bi-f urcated fish.
