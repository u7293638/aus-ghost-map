WELCOME Another toilsome year has passed And Christmas, honour crowned, Comes hale and hearty as when last He scattered joy around. We welcome with glances gay, Our blithest carols sing, And all our griefs this festive day Unto the winds we fling. Roast beef upon the board we show, Plum-pudding too is near; He'll see, though lacking frost and snow, We've good old Christmas cheer. . Let all partake rn brotherhood Who come within the door, And welcome him as Britons should, As BritonB did of yore. And lest from parching thirst he pine, And fly with flagging wing, Go fetch the brightly foaming wine Now cooling in the spring. Dispense it round with open hand, Brimful the bumpers fill, And to this fair and sunny land Bid him a welcome still. Fling open wide each shutter rude, The balmy breeze let in; No gloomy geblins dare intrude, Nor squalid sorrow's kin. Old Christmas comes! Each jolly soul Give him a welcome fair; Drown discontent deep in the bowl And drive away dull care. Now clear away the tables all; Let old and young advance; And Shepherd Jim the fiddler call To play a merry dance. Hang up our native mistletoe, 'Twill serve the purpose fair; Inveigle all the girls below And boldly kiss them there. With dance and song the day we spend, With tales of jest and ghost; And ere the evening's mirth we end We'll drink a parting toast. FQl glass and cup, and rude tin pot, Give Christmas one last cheer, And let him see that though 'tis hot He is right welcome here. R. B.
