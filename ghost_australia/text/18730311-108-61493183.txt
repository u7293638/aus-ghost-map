A GIPPSLAND GHOST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE GIPPSLAND TIMES. SIR,—A man died in the hospital, and was buried in the cemetery. The Mercury says, "he did not die, but was seen walking about the Sale streets on Wednesday last", (a week after he was burled) as I think this is the first well authenticated ghost story in this district, it should be recorded.—Yours, &c.; SCEPTIC.
