Air. jj. i'. 1'ieia presided tnrougnout the sessions. Yesterday afternoon there was a large attendance at the meeting, and in the evening every seat in the building was occu pied. Archdeacon Henry Langley, speaking on tho general subject — "LIfo in the power of the Holy Ghost"— said that he had placed be- fors his hearers the day previously the truth that lovo was tho great testing point of the position of the Christian character. The sub ject ho wished to bring before their notice that evening was humility. A conference such as they wero holding would not be likely to have its best effect if that subject was not brought forward in"'a prominent place. His advice was to lie low — very low. They should get so low before the Lord that there would be no room for self. If that were only the caso with them, then tho Lord would have room to work. That was the way to let Him work. That wan the way to be 'filled with the Holy Ghost, and that the only way. Dr. Man ning and Dr. Rutledgc followed, speaking on tho subject "Grieving the Holy Spirit." Af ter tea an interval meeting was held, which was addressed by Mr. E. P. Field. The sub ject for consideration at the evening service was "Receiving the Holy Spirit." Tho speak ers wore tho Roys. Archdeacon J. D. Langley and J. Vaughan.
