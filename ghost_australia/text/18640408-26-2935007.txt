The Independent Journal. Vox Populi, Vox Dei. FRIDAY, APRIL 8, 1864. The result of the conference with the Governor had by the gentlemen who waited on His Ex- cellency on Friday last, will be satisfactory to by far the greater portion of the settlers, as it caused the withdrawal of the proposed Memo- rial, the publication of which, on the 31st ult., was without doubt a great mistake. The very fact that such a Memorial has been put forward will lead, on the part of the opponents of Trans- portation in the other colonies, to an argument that even here we have changed our ideas regarding it ; while on the contrary it is un- deniable we are well satisfied to let the question rest as decided by the Home Government, and certainly not disposed to give Transportation up for the present, in favour of a project which there is not a ghost of a chance will ever come to anything. We have good reason to believe that the proposed Memorial does not represent the sentiments of the settlers, and merely those of the two or three gentlemen concerned in framing it, and that it will be protested against by most of the leading members of our com- munity. These continual whinings after extraneous assistance to the colony, must be somewhat disgusting to other communities and to the Home Government, and induce but a poor idea of the colony and its natural resources, as a field for immigration and the employment of capital. In our thinking it is high time the settlers began to look to themselves and their own exertions as a source of general prosperity, and more heartily try to make the colony self- supporting ; daily evidence is being given that its available country is not so restricted, as it was supposed to be in the days when the set- tlers never looked beyond the narrow precincts of the runs they occupied, leaving to the Government or chance, what in the other colonies has been done by private enterprise â€”the discovery of greater ranges of pasture ; even that immovable individual, the farmer, is beginning to find out that his fields will produce something else than wheat and barley, and possibly more profitable ; and it is the want of capital alone which restricts the bounds of our production of minerals and timber. Truly these are evidences that prosperity must follow a hearty and vigorous attention to them, such as ought to distinguish a British community, and with such great natural riches as West- ern Australia, undeniably possesses, it is morti- fying to think that with so considerable an amount of capital lying dormant, as evidenced in the Bank Returns, its owners are wanting in the enterprise which would alike make it beneficial to themselves, and the colony from which it has been gathered.
