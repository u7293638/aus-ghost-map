SCIENCE AND SPECTRES. In a recent autobiographical sketch Mr. Grant Allen describes his first and unconscious essay in fiction. It was a narrative (writes the Jj ally Acres) dealing with the curiosity felt by a man of science in ascertaining that a ghost, in his own experience, is a ghost. This apology was apparently based on Hume's famous argument about miracles, whereby, a Mr. Patrick Proctor Alexander observed, " he placed the supernatural in a position of some little embarrassment." For, granting by way of argument, that the supernatural exists, and is anxious to make a demonstration of the fact to the senses of a man of science, he cannot do so, because, according to the hypothesis, that is impossible The evidence cannot conceivably be good enough to attest the fact, therefore the ghost cannot establish his identity as a ghost, therefore for scientific purposes he might as well not exist at all 1 his, play fully stated, the argument may be described as a vicious circle, however it justifies many persons in disregarding spectres altogether. Whether the argument might not be so applied as to confirm o disbelief in the sensible universe at large, we shall not pause to inquire. But it is plain that when a scientific gentleman establishes his doctrine by conclusions drawn from a ghost of his own my cution, he is merely copying the preacher who demol shea the Infidel The old Infidel of the pulpit was a mere lay figure or Aunt Sally, Whose ideas were just what the preacher chose to make them, and who I am never hoard up his own defence in the same way Mr Allen might, if he chose (though vi of hope he would be more sportsmanlike) set up a mere ghost of Straw, whom he could as to demonstrate for an impostor A well-known a plan for making a ghost is to cut him out in thin sheet metal, paint him white, and exhibit him in the dusk. As the observer approaches him he is sion by. turned round till his sharp edge alone in opposite the observer, so that he vanishes. The scientific control engines might erect a spectre no more worthy than this, and then destroy his claims to spirituality. But it would be a much more worthy exercise to lay some other person's ghost, not the mere puppet, or fancy ghost, of Mr. Allen. By way of an example, is of may select a bogie who, it is understood m ghostly circles, is no mere creation of romantic fancy in a recent number of a magazine was published a sketch called " A WoatcinMjateij " This is, we believe, to be taken by the curious, not as a " short story," the child of imagine it ion, but as a record of facts, or of what seemed to be facts Let this be assumed as an hypothesis, at least, and then let us ask, What does science make of it, that hypothesis being specu- latively granted? That is, admitting that the narrator is speaking the truth, to the best of her ability, how does Science, in the person of Mr Grant Allen, for example, explain the situation P The story is of a character very familiar in such tales but includes one feature of more than common eccentricity. The narrator is a lady who, with her husband and one domestic, took a house in a deserted mining town on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains The front door opened straight into a sitting-room, which again opened into another ; these, again, " gave " on bed- rooms The kitchen wasteland, and there was a large cellar. 'Iho agent who let the house frankly admitted that it was cheap because advice " haunted Here over Uni least scientific must admit that the new occupants were encouraged to expect something odd, which they proposed to lay with a revolver After the first night in the new house, the servant girl complained that she had heard a baby cry ing where no baby should be She therefore departed liiBtnntly Next, when the lady of the house was alone she heard a terrific combat for two taking place in the cellar, and ending with a heavy thud boo did not go down into the cellar. On the same night the sound of footsteps was heard ranging the house, and no owner of the feet could be discovered The fight in the cellar was in vestigated by the occupant, with a revolver on a following occasion, but he could not even detect the presence of rats He occasionally pursued the v ion less owner of the feet which echoed in the corridors, but to no as all the sounds of withdrew into empty bedrooms The lew less baby also made itself a nuisance, as nobody can stop a sicitral infant from wailing in the night 'I lungs got it worse, not better, rocking chairs rocked of their own accord, and then a strange thing happened " On the glass pane of a widow was visible a picture in that work of art was represented a skeleton standing elect, the figure of a child kneeling to the skeleton, and " in the corner of the pane a red coloured hand," plainly implicating a " B of B K ," as the Claimant said, a Baronet According to the neighbours, this remarkable study had been v isi his three years earlier "It comes all of a sudden, and yo 11 never got it off " And indeed the picture could not be " got off " As large crowds of amateurs used to assemble for the purpose of view mg and criticising the skeleton, the pane was broken, instead of being sent to Mr Grant Allen or Air Frederick Myers there is not very much more to tell Moro j couple heard the noises, the hit by, the terrific combat for two of the collar, the footsteps which walked the house, and all the rest of it is of one pretends to have seen any visible sprites, no one accounts for the nonce as Mr Pepys did for the sprite which alarmed him, " 'towns only our young gib-cat " True, an ancient miner declared that the house had been a gambling and drinking saloon, and that two men had killed each other, with bowie knives, in the cellar This, of course, satisfactorily accounts for the trouble in the cellar where the heroes, as in A illness, fight their battles o'er again But the baby, and the skeleton and the blood-red hand are as obscure as ever Here, then, is the opportunity of science Granting the phenomena, what are the persons to think who beard and saw the phenomena is they are sober, and others is a sane, how are they to account to themselves for their experience Â° This is the question which at once is in no hurry to tackle Bulli admit that there may he a difficulty in discovering the persons with the abnormal experience.
