POLICE PROTECTION. WHY THE GHOST IS NOT CAUGHT. The Even Noose published a letter this week from a correspon dent wharf clerk wherein the writer drew attention to the inade- quate police protection afforded by the municipal authorities. The letter was right enough as far as it went, but it did not go half far enough, for all the suburbs except the Glebe are left entirely without police on duty every night. One man is stationed at Lansdowne Crescent, one at the wharf, one at Battery Point, one at North Hobart, and one of them at Upper Mac quarie street ; but none of them do regular night duty. The city itself is almost as badly off for, owing to men being sent to these out stations and vacancies being left unfilled the force is now much below its proper standard, and at present the night patrol for the whole city consists of but ten men whose beats extend up to two miles in length. With these facts in view it is little wonder there is so much crime undetected and said nothing about ; but it is likely to continue till the citizens make a stir in the matter and insist on the proper number of men being ap pointed. The ghost scare is a case in point of how powerless the force is either to prevent or detect crime when it is committed. If Dr. Crowther had been cognisant of these facts it is more than likely that his remark that ' it was a I wonder the police did not catch the ghost ' would never have been made, for even a bobby cannot be ubiquitous, or in more than one place at a time. Considering the small number of men in the force, the manner in which the duties are carried out must be considered creditable to all concerned.
