ARTHUR ORTON. The sensational confession by the Tichborne Claimant, which the People has just published, verified as it is by his affidavit, ought to finally lay the ghst of one of the most famous imnostures of our timeB. Arthur Orton, as now he admits himself to be, was the son of George Orton, a shipping butcher of High-street, Wapping. He always had a taste for a roving life, and so he went to Australia, where the advertisements which' the Dowager Lady Tichborne had published caught his ARTHUR ORTON. eye. It speaks much for his abilities that this uneducated vagabond Bhould have deceived so many persons of brains and culture as to his identity. The story of the two trials has often been told. Siuce his release, about ten years ago, Orton has been gradually sinking in the slough impecuniosity. He lectured on his prison experience, appeared at music-halls, and then at public-houses. The obese imposter sat behind the bar, and customers were permitted to converse with " Sir Roger Tichborne." In 1892 he came forward as a Parlia mentary candidate for Hanley, but did not go to the poll. He has now practically closed his strange career by selling his confession to a newspaper.
