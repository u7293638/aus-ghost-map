Footscrazy. THE skittishness of a BROWN Mayor is rendering famous the dreary solitudes of the borough of Footscray, heretofore only celebrated for bluestone boulders, thistles, half starved goats, and trigs, whose appearance would dispel any such illusion, as the chance of the place ever becoming a land of ham, or in which people, much less pigs, would be able to save their bacon. It appears that the original mayor—for there are now two magisterial functionaries—disappeared some time since, and in consequence of the vagaries of the new Borough Act, Footscray became suddenly bereft of its councillors— probably no great loss. For many months things relnained in Statu quo, thfe Town Clerk being a kind of ghost of the defunct corporation, and the Surveyor, like SELKIRK, monarch of all he surveyed. But at last things were put straight, a new council elected, and a nevV Mayor appointed, when lo, the BROWN Mayor canters iii, and declares his rightto the Civic chair, in which he forthwith ensconces himself, and cannot bte induced to relinquish it. The consequence is that the Council Of Footscray has a brace of Mayors, and will be able to drive a madcap-tandem.
