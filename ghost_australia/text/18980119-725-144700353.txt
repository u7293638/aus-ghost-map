Agon ; shot blew - it to pulp, but when' die doctor lookod to see what Jaad teoome of his ide liverer, the ghoet had vanished. - In another instance, a giri, when sitting up into the small hours of the morning reading, -sa? her' own , apparitioQ is' sight-' robe glide across tho bedroom to a bay win* dow whioh stood open, pass through it, and vanish. The girl was known on. rare oc casions to walk in her deep; and her mother, shrewdly imagining it was a premonition of disaster, kept watch the. following night, ' Sure enough, the girl, at the hour of the vision, rose, crossed to the window/ un fastened it, and in another second would have been burled, thirty .feet to.tbe ACound beneath, bad her another hot olntcheohsr. * Less fortunate was^a man -iwho, having seen his spirit double, ^lifl not take .warning. He was sitting reading at -. the window one evening last summer, when his attention was attracted by bis d(g jBudd6i1y getting barked vigorously. -Looking out, he was astounded to see s . matj. resembling him exaotly 'in face, -figure aud driese, ooming elowly up the steps leading to the front -door. , Half; way pp the figure vanished, apparently into the masonry«r.and the .expectant terrier gave a mournful howl. - The next evening, returning from business at (he identical -hour, be was mounting the steps, when- tbey -sud- denly collapsed; .he was flung into thecellar bonoath, and instantly killed. Perhaps -a. more dramatic .instance +li«.n my is one told in the Fire Brigade. A few years back a call was received, and tha engine was manned. Five men constituted the crew, but as it drpve out of the station tbey noticed a sixth, the exaot double of a mate who they knew was left in the station. As the engine swung into the road at a gal- 1 lop the he'riAkd ? soectre : vanished into thfcv ' air. On their return, the men, pale as sheets, related loeir uncanny experience, and, to their adtinishmeht, were corroborated by their 'tniates in' the1eBttiOti,',*'andIitobng 1 tbem -the double in the flesh, '? ' Ah hour later a second caQ came, and flic unfortunate fireman, being : next for duty, ! mounted to his seat. Again the engine s wept ont at a gallop, bnt as it took the ' corner the wheel struok a post, and one of the crew was flang from his seat and his brains knooked oat on ihe cobbled street. It was the -man whose speotre a coaple of hours before had appeased and vanished oh j the same spot. . .
