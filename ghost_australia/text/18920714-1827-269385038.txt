A COLONIAX- STATESMAN IN ENGLAND. —Mr. Diblis is npw-a-days -the leading man in England. One reads "Mr. Diblis is at present attending - the agricultural shew at ;W;#mick, which-itliii iPrihce of Wales and the Dulce of York- are also visiting." This placing pf the Prince of Wales and the Duke th^sto^nd. rank, showing them 'jf^'^^-^teUit^; in the orbit of pilibs/ -reiriirids,'one'; of' Cardinal Wolsey's pliras'e,- " I and-riiy k'inc." There is, however,-no-chance of Mr; Dibbs's presumption ;bemgiesented ;5vitli the sanie effectiveness as Wtis- thc- 'Ciia'dinal-s. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of York dp nob complete the roll of high personages whose susceptibilities Mr. Dibbs is, consciously or unconsciously, wounding. He might have kept away from Wru-wicksliirG. .It, ir^mrliir- Bli00d."t3i-£fc l>ith<scu> tlio-jpooplo ot WjLVwit-.lv bt.-C-i ;n\i(l(;r. t lie J mpresiiioil tluvv •New South Wales was governed by one of tlicmselves named Parkes, and that were '-Pa'rices reirioyed New South Wales would incbntiiieutly relapse into savagery. It is unkind to dispel this fair illusion, unkind to iWa,r>vickshire^ndi unkind to Parkes. But -e is auotlier and as bitter a blow coming Wliile in Warwickshire Dibbs is sure to dine with Lord Leigh, the successor of the local magnate to whom Parkes in youth looked up with awe, Dibbs on this occasion will enjoy himself more than if he were consigning nectar and -anibrosia: Just as many g&pd; p'eppl^think""that the .pleasure of sittiug4iefnre'd_fire'bf :, a , Sviuter's- s iiight is enhanced by thinking of poor wretches put in the cold, so Dibbs with his legs tuider Hie table at'Stpneieigh.wiU have the delight pf picturing Parkes in retirement at Balmain, with no solace left but tp pray that his rival maychoke.. ' ' DIED or WATER.—A contp.mporary received, by cable, the weful intelligence pf tlie sudden and peculiar deaths pf three men : at' ; Arg;eriteiiil, a town on the right bank of the Seine, seven miles below Paris. Said :the.-telegram :—" These men entered into a water-drinking contest. One succeeded in swallowing twelve quarts, the second nine quarts, and the third seven quarts of water, but the •' effect upon their system was so serious. that each man shortly afterwards died." This record of the fatal effects of water will rejoice the Licensed Victuallers' Association; but if the beverage were Seine water, the catastrophe could be accounted for without casting any slur pn water in general. Water, one knows from Falstaff, •''sivells a-nian," hut really the sportsman whp tppk the. seven quarts ought to have been able, had lie had what turf writers call "a .careful preparation" in liquid absorption, to have escaped swelling fatally. A German student of very ordinary capacity will make away with 15 zeitels of beer at a sitting, which is well on the way to seven quarts, ttnd^extraordinaryperformers have been known to polish off 30 zeitels and be neither sick nor sorry in the morning. If the water drunk by the Argenteuil competitors was without injurious admixture, we must couclude, either that Germans by long continued drinking have strengthened their internal organs so as to withstand much .greater strains than the cpniparatively little taxed ones pf-Frenchmen, or else that beer -is . less Aarniful than water. Beth these theories would from a temperance point of vieyy .be -rank heresy..
