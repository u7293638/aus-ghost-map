DR. TALMAGE'S BROOKLYN TABERNACLE. [BY CHAS. H. MATTERS.] Being in New York on Sunday, May 10. I determined to hear the world-renowned Dr. Talmage. So I crossed over the great Suspen- <*> sion Bridge which connects New York and Brooklyn, and found my way to the corner of Clinton and Green avenues. Though half an hour before the time for service a crowd was waiting outside eager for admission. Soon after the doors .were opened and we entered. Tile building id not yet complete, though opened for worship two weeks before my visit. A tower at the corner will be carried consider ably higher than it is yet built. The- church walls are of brick, on granite foundations. Chiselled in stone at the comer is this inscrip tion:—"Brooklyn Tabernacle: erected A.D. 1890." The internal appearance is almost octagonal. There are two galleries arranged iv the form of an amphitheatre. The roof is constructed somewhat in the form of a dome about 90 ft. above the ground floor. An open dais, GO ft. long and fo mi- circular in sliape, i-> reserved for the preacher. At the foot of the platform fcix tables are set aside for reporters, of whom three were present reiwrting tho sermon on Sunday morning. On the ground floor ore eight aisles by which access is gained to the (lews. The whole building provides seating accommodation for 5,600 persons. A organ, which cost 30,000 dollars, is placed behind the preacher, but tlx; keyboards, in four rows, arc in front of the preacher some distance froru tlu> organ. lVo fessor Browne is the organist, and an excellent musician. He is assisted by a gentleman wlin leadg the 'psalmody with a cornet. At thu waving of hi.- hand the whole as.-s.-mWy rises to join in the praise of God. There is no choir, but some grand congregational tinging, never theless. The preacher is apparently between 55 and CO yeais of a^>-, tall, f-jian-ly liiiiit, partly bald, with no flashing t'j«- or ruaewive head, but luts a high forehead. Il«'roi* ainaiidestifiitenf thearts and graces of oratory, with plain feature*, harsh, unmusical voice, and nuattractiw manner, and yet |K«<eF*ing some magic and magnetic power capable of drawing crowds of people at every *ervice. Hi? <*amo-tii'?" aiiil sincerity are genuine, aud he evidently believe.-. what In- preaches. About 10.30 a.m. Dr. Tahnage enters by a ride door on the platform, jilaofs his Bible on a small table boside a yaw uf iiowers, takes hi* teat (there is no pulpit), engages a few moments iii silent prayer, and looks around on the multi tude of faces gathered from almost all nation-) on earth. Immediately afterwards the entity audience ris*^, at the nourish of the conductor's hand, to join in a grand pasan of praise, singing " Praise God from whom all blessings How. It was good to be there and hear tuch a burst of liarmony. Then the doctor rose and offered a short, plain prayer. Next followed reading the Scriptures, part of the 11th chapter of Hebrews, termed by the doctor "The roll of the martorrs," with short expositions and com ments on'the rerecs. After singing and prayer again a host of announcements was made by tEe preacher and thd collection *-*k*m up, followed again by tinging. The test of the sermon was Luke, eh. xiv. v. 17, "Come, for all things are now ready." Thus the preacher began—"This ia not an invi tation to the funeral of a dead Christ, but to the marriage of the King's Son.' Then in flowery language and poetic stylo no gave an historical description of the vis.it of Queen Elizabeth to Lord Leicester at Kenil worth, " where a sumptuous feast was provided, accG&ipanicd; with die burst of mu^tc, amidst encliantiug M<*n<*>. in which the pix\\-t> v-r. wafted from joy to joy and from rantur--t • rapture.''
