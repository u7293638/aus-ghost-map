DEATHS FROM FRIGHT. ' I have interested myself iomewhat in looking up unusual causes of death,' said a well known physician, 'and have met several well-authenticated instances where fright was the cause. The English Surgeon General Francis tells of a drummer in India across whose legs a harmless lizard crawled when he was half asleep. He was sure that a ' cobra had bitten him, and it was too much for his nerves, and be died. 'Frederick I. of Prussia was killed by fear. His wife was insane, and one day she escaped from her keeper, and, dabbling her clothes in blood rushed upon her husband : while he was dozing in his chair. King | Frederick imagined her to be the white lady . whoBe ghost was believed to invariably ap pear whenever the death of a member of the Royal Family was to occur, and he was thrown into a fever, and died in six weeks. ' But perhaps the most remarkable death from fear was that of the Dutch painter Pentman, who lived in the seventeenth cen tury. One day he went into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketch some deaths' heads and skeletons for a picture ho intended to paint. The weather was very sultry, and while Rketohing he fell asleep. He was aroused by bones dancing around him and the skeletons suspended from the ceiling clashing together. In a fit of terror he threw himself out of the window, and, though he sustained no serious injury and was informed that a slight earthquake had caused the commotion among his ghobtly surroundings, he died in a few dayB in a nervous tremor. ' I could cite many other cases where the shock to the nervous system which we know as fright has produced death.'
