: . .. .MARTS GHOST; ! A Pathetic Ballad. 'Twas in the middle of the night, To sleep young William tried ; j "When Mary's ghost came stealing is, i And stood at his bedside. i : 1 ' " o William dear ! 0 William dear 1 My rest eternal ceases ; ' Alas 1 my everlasting peace Is broken into pieces. I thought the last of all my caves Would end with my last minute ; : But though I wont to my long home, i didn't stay long in it. ' ' f Tlie body-snatchers they have come And made a snateh at ine ; I It's very hard them kind of men ! Won't let a body be ! j You thought that i was buried deep, j Quite decent like and chary, i But from her grave in Mary-bone, j They've come and boned your Mary. | The arm that used to take your arm Is took to Dr. yyse ; And both my legs are gone to walk The hospital at Guy's. i i vowed that- you should have my hand ' But fate gives us denial ; | You'll find it there, at Dr. Bell's, i In spirits and a phial. j As for my feet, the little feet Xou used to call so pretty, There's one i know, in Bedford Row, The t'other's in the City. I can't tell where my head has gone, Bt Doctor O.rpue cr.u ; As for my trunk, it's all p.-. iked up To go by 1'ickford's van. : I wish you'd go to Mr. P. j And save nie.sucii a ivio ; | I don't half iikc t:ie oatside pla.ee j They've too': for my inside. The cock it crows— i must he gone ; . My William, v.-e must part ! But I'll be yours in death, r.ltho' ! Sir Astley has my heart. ; Don't go to weep upon my grave, i ' And think that there I be ; ! They haven't left an atom there i Of my anatomic. i — Tnoius Hood.
