The proceedinga will com mence with a Procession leaving the Shire Hall at 11 o'clock sharp, headed by the Bendi.o Brass Band. The route to be taken will be South to the Stand pipe, then back down High Street North, to the cemetery road. Returning from this point to the Show Ground Major Moore will act as Marshall, the position taken by him last year.

A sum of one shilling will be charged, the whole proceeds being for the Hospital. Major Moore will t again conduct the "try your luck" busi ness and Mr Cope the race game.

CauncH or EN?LAND SUNDAY ScooL, Pic Nic.-The annual pie nic of St. John's Church of England Sunday School was held on Wednesday the 30th March, near the somewhat romantic site of the Old M'Ivor Inn. The weather promised to be hot in the morning, but early after dinner old Sol withdrew his beams behind clouds, so that not an umbrella or parase was in requisition for the greater part of the day. The children met at the church early in the morning with their teachers, and after a short service held by the Incumbent the Rev. J. Carrington, were driven in a number of vehicles kindly lent for the purpose to the scene of their festivities. The teachers and pastor worked right hard to organize a perfect pie nic, and as a result they deserve the congratu lations of the numerous assemblage that gathered at the pic nic spot in the aftei noon. A number of prizes for athletic prowess in the Anglican youth of Heath cote were contended for and awarded, boys and girls being the contestants so that the prizes were not confined to the sturdier sex only. We are unable to produce the records of the wins but members of every class in the school had the honor and qualification of taking at least two prizes, so that the pleasure of success must have been wide spread. Dnring the afternoon a verit able host of visitors came upon the scene, for all were welcome and they gathered to that one spot from the four quarters of the globe, we were going to say M'Ivor Shire, and found every facility for being amused provided with pro fuseness. The huge quantities of sand wiches, the vast cakes, the intermninable supply of fruit, the gallons of drinkls, disappeared in a fashion that according to Shakespeare would "make the judicious grieve." Indeed the pro visions taken to the place would have fed eight mammoths for six months, but the provisions taken back to Heatheote would not have sustained as many mice for 6 hours. Yet all were provided for and a basket of cakes left behind as a thank offering to thie owners of the pie nic grounds. In accordance with the ancient custom, the adult ladies played a cricket match, a team led by Miss Horne succumbing to a team led by Mrs Christie jnr., the latter lady scoring 34 runs and her team ultimately beat the enemy by 65, as against 46. As regards ladies cricket in this town 3 we received a very explosive letter from a person signing himself " The bald headed coon without a waistcoat." We I had to suppress the bulk of his comments but he says very truly "People are just beginning to perceive that in the natural order of things, ladies are born cricketers. They excel in "cutting," "glances" are their great weapon of attack, they are always trying to make a "catch" they like to be "caughted" themselves, they only possess feet as far as we know and " l.b.w." can only mean lady before wicket, to use the word" duck" in res pect of them is considered a compliment, they rarely possess such a " good length" as the men but occasionally are " fast" As a sex they have countless admirable " points," and we cannot deny that a lady "slips" must enthral maukind; us their instinctive self possession prevents them from being "put out" and as they never become old they are nev~e "run out." They cling so fondly that they tc can see no merits in a good " bye"; D we never heard of "Miss Hit" it is true, but is there not something ungallant when a gentleman bowls a " maiden over" that we miss when a lady does the same fat. The gentle sex are so fastidious about their hatsf that "the hat trick" eomes with them when s they are born, and makes them obnox ious only when they sit in front of you at a theatre, but that is because they are so "the hat trickal." We can continue no farther as the puns grew viler as we read on, While cricket was in progress other games were played by the adults, and after the departure of the juveniles *s,`y;s 'i frolic hunter.s of both ghosts by mooriiIgfhfiTheai2 . \- Carrington and Mrs Carrington were w heartily assisted by the teachers and 0 others, but it would be invidious for us rt to particularize any individuals for y separate praise. They all contributed e their best to making the effort the most s- successful Church of England pie nic is that we have attended for years. d
