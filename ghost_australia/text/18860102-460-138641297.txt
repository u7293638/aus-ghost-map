With a coal breeze from the southward, and dull leaden clouds threatening rain, the weather did not present a very promising appearance on the morning of Bo.ving l»ay. but though the sky was pretty well obscured throughout the day, the threatened downpour never descended, and quite a pleasant after noon was spent on the grounds of the V.A.T.C- The attendance numbered gotne 6,000 or 7,000 persons, and amongst the visitors was His Excellency the Governor, who was accompanied bv several mem ber? of his suite. Since the spring meet ing several improvements have been effected by Mr. Bona, not the least appreciated by the public being the new scratcbing-boards attached to the clock tower in the saddling paddock. They have been increased to nearly double their previous size, and the numbers are now large enough to be dis tinguished at any reasonable distance. By the erection of picket-fence, a lane has been made from the weighing enclosure to the jockeys' room, and thus the difficulty pre viously experienced by jockeys in reaching their dressing-place has been done away with. The turf was in splendid order, the late rains having caused the conch grass to pow most luxuriantly, and sll the tree* beinz in full leaf. Caultield never presented a prettier appearance. A Selling Race was the introductory item, and 1" appeared on the card, bat scratching* reduced the 6eld materially. First Pup was one of the number, and as the n)!y was in excellent form, arid had the services of llanagan, the public followed the stable, and she advanced so rapidly in the wagering i that in order to get on backcrs had ; to lay odds.

In a field of eight for i the Hurdle Race, General Jackson was moat ' in demand, the stewards having decided that 1 he was not entitled to carry a penalty for . winning at Elsternwick park - a decision ; which gare rise to considerable discussion, j Vulcan, for whom Corri^an was retained, ! received plenty of support, but one section ot , the Ballarat division went direct for Uerin», , who was to be steered by A.
