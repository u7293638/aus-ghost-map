LOCAL COURT - STOCKPORT. Thursday, April 14 (Before Messrs G.W. Hawkes, S.M., R. Hark- ness, J. McLachlan and G. Rhodes. J.'s P.) P. McArdle v. J- O'DEA - £29, dishonored acceptance. This case occupied the Court for a considerable time, and there was some very hard swearing on both sides. From the plain- tiffs case it appeared defendant purchased a mare from him for above amount in November last, but when the bill became due he refused to meet it. Defendant alleged that the mare when purchased by him was suffering from some disease, and that he only signed the acceptance on the condition that if the beast died, which it did a few days afterwards, he was not to be called upon to meet it, and to show that plain- tiff expected such an event was likely to occur, when he informed him of the fact he (plaintiff) said that he had dreamt such was the case on night previous. Much amusement was thereupon caused by the S.M. asking plaintiff whether he had seen the mare's ghost. Plain- tiff vigorously denied the defendant's testimony, and after a short consultation the bench gave a verdict for the full amount. Mr. Lewis ap- peared for defendant. Maphson v. Riches. — £10 10s. 3d., goods supplied. Plaintiff had no definite account made out, but handed in his ledger, in which the accounts were made up in such a mixed way that the presiding magistrate remarked that it was like a Chinese puzzle to him. Defendant said the goods were delivered to his brother, and that he was not responsible for him. The case was ultimately nonsuited. A few minor cases concluded the list.
