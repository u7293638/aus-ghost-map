SOME SCRAPS FROM "THE FORTIES." ', . One of the darkest intervals of Australian history is that which lies between the colonisation of Victoria or Port; Phillip and the discovery of gold Through 15 years the founders of Victoria plodded and struggled along, harassed by the restrictions of a Government which was more strict and less sympathetic than that of Downing Street Seeking in vain for a market, also watching a potential wealth increase, yet seeing no means of transferring it into commodities of actual enrichment or comfort or luxury. A spirit of power brooded over the face of the old colonial chaos when the rush to the diggings began, whose influences are traced in all our larger life, and whose enterprise, pluck, and daring we are pleased to think charac tense the Victorian amongst Australian people to this day. We seldom care to look beyond the digging times, and yet, indulging that indifference, we are grossly unjust to our first founders, who laid great foundations in slow and laborious times, and truly and really in the district of Port Phillip planned and prepared the lines on which the colony of Victoria has grown They were the "Old Brigade " They held themselves as men, and prepared and maintained a heritage lit for proper men long are the great army of the diggers rushed in And aught that concern them and their fame should interest us, and and place and record where the historians of the future will search chiefly for facts- which is, and will be, the columns of the reputable daily press very gladly, therefore, we seek to set forth here a further instalment of the long and praiseworthy) labours of Mr James Bonwick, who stands first, perhaps, amongst those who have sought to seek out and to come pile the facts of Australian history, from the " First Meet" onwards Recently Mr. Bonwick, in England, has been searching the archives of the Colonial Office, and chiefly from the records of the "forties baaculledout a series of documents, incidents, and facts, which, purchased by the proprietors of this journal, will furnish materials for a series of articles which it is expected will be of much interest to old colonial like, and will not be regarded as unworthy of attention by their children and grandchildren, and by all those who come under the generic and honourable term of colonists It inn) surprise and even startle those who are not familiar with the history of old colonial days in Victoria, to be met on the very threshold of investigation with the heading "The Bad Times, 1811 V They are accustomed to think of those early years at the golden age of Australia, when Melbourne town lots went a begging, and the investment of £100 would grow as naturally into hundreds of thousands na seed grains into line est bushels Surely, it is strange, then, to find Governor Gipps reporting in 1841 (February) 1) - " Since the date of my Inst confidential despatch (17th July, 1840), my reports to your Lordship have been so full and frequent that there is I believe, only one subject of interest on which I shall have occasion to touch in this separate communication, and that is, I regret to say, the commercial em bnrrnsHinent which has existed for the lost three months, and still continues to exist in the colon) ' it appears to me that it is precisely. of the same nature as that which seems to occur almost periodically in England, and other commercial places, from an excess of speculation or over trading, or from the undue extension of credit and the facility with which our bankers have been in the habit of discounting more accommodation paper " now reasonably might that concluding pnaBnge have been repeated on the 1st of February, 1882 ' But, further, His Excellency in those early years seems to have been just as familiar with the artificial ghost of over borrowing as the financial critic, in London to day What are the baseless diatribes and unreasonable lamentations of the Mary and the Financial News but echoes of the vice-regal comment of half a century ago ' '"the large debt, moreover, which the colony is, by means of these companies (new loan companies) contracting to Great Britain will tend, I fear, to place it ultimately in the condition in which the West Indian Islands have long been placed in a condition, that is to say, in which all, or b) lies the greater part, of their produce will go to England, to be distributed amongst annuitants and mort gages without any return to the colony." A little remains in the colony we may say after the lapse of 50 years, and we have little doubt now that our national debt and national prosperity will increase in about equal ratio for 50 years to come. In one respect, however, His Excellency was happily placed in that remote time. As our statesmen of the present, he also had an unemployed " difficulty to deal with, but evidently had not the fear of the Trades hall before his eyes, for he writer, August 19, 1843 - "'the working classes are calling on the Government for employment, and of feel that in some way or other it must be afforded to them, though at wag considerably below what they have hitherto demanded. I Intend, therefore, to offer employment at 5s a day to mechanics and 2s a day to all labourers who may be out of work " Would the gallows ofHaaman be high enough for the statesman who would so insult " the dignity of labour," or " the proper pride of the unemployed, in these latter days? As to the cause of these hard times the Governor has very clear ideas " Recent events have only confirmed me in the opinion which I have long cherished, and often expressed, that nearlylalLthe evils under which this colony has laboured, and is now labouring more severely than ever, are to ascribed to the reckless rapidity with which cu pital of all sorts, but especially banking capital, was poured into it, Melting greedy gains at usurious interest, between the years 1834 and 1840, the mischief beginning With the commencement of business by the Chartered Bank of Australasia in 1830 " And further - "'The condition of the four banks which remain is simply this -They are the holders collective!) of discounted bills to the amount of about two millions sterling, or, in other words, they have parted with their substantial capital, and held in lieu of it bills to the amount I have mentioned, but the drawers and endorsers of these bills are daily going into the Insolvent Court, and the amount of loss which the banks may consequently. have to sustain it is impossible as yet to calculate " Truly, we may say, on reading this and reflecting on other very recent events, "The thing which is has been, and the thing which hath been shall be, and there is nothing new under the sun " And may we not derive a good deal of hope and solace from the knowledge that all this burden of depression, which served to make chapters of lamentation of every Government-house despatch in the forties, was utterly lost and almost for gotten in the tremendous developments of the " fifties " There is at least as good reason to believe that any little depression which may mark the close of the decade will be as effectively lost in the full tide of pros ' perity which will flow in onus through the "nineties ' For though we do not anticipate any new Ballarat or Bendigo, we are justified in believing that the wedding of the land and water will, through the great fruit and and wine industries, bring forth more wealth and prosperity than followed the outpouring of the world's enterprise and industry on our virgin goldfields The Governor's record of the banks in existence, with their paid up capital, between the years 1834 and 1843 has also an historic value They were as under - And yet, despite all this competition in a small community, money was not cheap "It is a remarkable fact that this great abundance of banking capital has not, since 1834, produced a reduction in the rate of interest, but, on the contrary, that the interest of money continued to rise until it attained in 1841 and 1842 in some cases 15 per cent in Sydney, and even 20 per cent in Port Phillip." from which we must conclude that the science of bank management was not very well understood in those early days And, indeed, on this particular point the Governor is able to speak in very positive terms " I have now to inform your Lordship (Lord Stanley), May 26, 1943) that instances of more direct fraud, though not of greater mis management, have within these few days been brought to light in respect to theS>dney Bank, and that much distrust exists in the public mind in regard even to some of the other banks " In the Sydney Bank it is discovered that large sums of money have been applied by the manager and accountant to their own use by the former it is slid to the amount of 14,000, by the latter of £4 600, and also that every clerk in the establishment has been allowed, in a greater or less degree, to anticipate his salary , or, in other words, to make use of the funds of the bank ' We did not arrive at conditions quite so desperate as those through any of our recent boom And lest it should be supposed that Sir George Gipps took an extreme or a pessimistic view, it may be well to refer readers to an account of the same times those of the depression which followed the collapse of the Bank of Australia and the chance of the balance in stock-given by a contemporary observer and writer, the late Dr Lang The doctor is more graphic than the Governor in his description of the banking system of the time He pictures a Mr Dasher, an imaginary but typical case, under examination before a committee of the Legislative Council. "What sort of an establishment did you keep up''' asks the chairman. " We had nine servants, a curricle, and a brougham, ' is the reply "And you had large transactions in land and stock '" " es, very large." "You must have brought large sums of money to the colony I " " Not a farthing, I assure you. I got £50 000 from the Bank of Australia. Ever) J body did it." And we know what happened to the J bank Another incident of the old times was the difficulty experienced in obtaining any increase of the superintendent's salary. Sir George Gipps had, on two or three occasions, brought the matter under the notice of Downing street, and at length, on the 28th of April, 1841, wrote at some length "I feel it a duty to bring under your Lord ship's consideration the amount of salary received by the superintendent of Port Phillip, Mr La '1 robe, the same being only 800 a year, with allowances forage for two horses, but without an official residence or lodging money " When the Estimates for the present year were before the Legislative Council, I was urged by more than one of the unofficial members to augment Mr La Trobe's salary, and the Council appeared general!) to concur in the propriety of such a measure , but I, in reply, stated that I did not consider my) self at liberty to propose without the permission of your Lordship an augmentation in any Bulnry the amount of which had been fixed in England "The appointment of a resident judge, with a salary of LI WO a year, seems to render an increase in Mr. La Trobe B salary more necessary even than it was when the 1 estimates were last before the Council And I therefore beg to submit his case to your Lordship " We are not favoured with his Lordship's reply, but naturally, perhaps, associated with this matter of salary, was the question of precedence) Precedency amongst officials in the colonies hasoltencuused trouble There is a recorded casein New South Wales, where the bishops of both the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches declined invitations to Government house because His Excellency declined to state which should go down heat And when Lord Carrington arrived in Sydney the Premier and mayor came nearly to a very practical settlement of the difficult! The Governor was announced to make his official landing at the steps at Circular Quay, and two hours before the time, the run or, in all the glory of his purple, took her stand on the lower- most step " If the Premier does come before me," said he, "it will be in the water The major was a burly citizen, the water deep and dirty, and the Premier was content with the second place Sir George Gipps, wishing to arrive at some certainty in the matter, as it affected the superintendent of Port Phillip, wrote home, December 23, 1842 " " I beg leave to submit to your Lordship that no place in the table of precedency in this colony has yet been assigned to the superintendent of Port Phillip, and that ran sequently a question has been raised at Melbourne whether the mayor of that town is) not, under the 62nd clause of the Corporation Act, 6th Vict., No 7, take precedence of the superintendent "I do not mean your Lordship to understand that such a claim has been seriously put forth, but in order to prevent the possibility of its being advanced as well also give a proper degree of consideration to his office, I beg leave to propose to your Lordship that a place may be assigned to the superintendent immediately after the Bishop, by which means the table of precedency will stand thus - "The Governor The Chief Justice (who has; this place assigned to him by the charter of justice) " 1 he commander of the forces " The Bishop " The superintendent of Port Phillip " Eight hundred a year, no horse, no forage allowance, and only the fifth place in colonial society New South Wales was not disposed to give " our Governor " a very high position in those days Nor did Downing street consider him entitled to a more dignified position unless within his own district" Lord Stanley replying, July 12,84 Bald " I perceive no objection to the position which you propose to assign, to the superintendent in the general table of precedency in the colony, and as regards the position of that officer within the district of Port Phillip, I consider that he is clearly entitled to stand at the head of the local society In in which he is placed. This point will be duly attended to in revising the book of general regulations."
