AUSTRALIAN JOCk CLUBS AUTUMN MEETING THIRD DAY -THURSDAY, AriUL 5 [BY SPECIAL WIRE.] (From "AuaUR, or "IheAlstralasian ) SYDNEY, THUSDAY The off day of the Australian Jockey Club meeting seldom creates much interest amongst the general public, and the attendance at Randwick to day was small both inside and outside the stand enclosure The Two year old Plate was the introductory item, and for this only four put in an appearance, Carette being most in demand , the only other that received anything like support for money being Camillius who justified the confidence of his friends by beating the favourite cleverly The winner, on being submitted to auction, caught the eject Mr h Weeks who bought him for MS sovs "ft ith only three two year olds to oppose Cranbrook in the ll AgedStai estate was considered good enough to lay liberal odds on Mr White's crack, who however, was looking lighter than when he ran in Melbourne Lonsdale's friends were evidently not dismayed, for the) accepted 4 to 1 pretty freely about the colt, and a few invested in favour of Lady Betty Mr Cooper was determined that there should be a strong pace, and gave orders to the boy on his billy to make it. The youngster made no mistake and though at the distance Cranbrook seemed to have her at his mere), the laughter or of- "serious came again, and fairly wearing the big gun down, beat him cleverly), the crowd cheering Mr Cooper heartily as he went into the enclosure to receive his filly I am glad to say that after this victory be determined not to sell her, and the filly was withdrawn from sale, For the Welter Hun dtcan Bertram was at first in most demand, but before the horses left the paddock a commission was worked in favour of Aristocrat, who won cleverly. Odds were freely laid on Volley for the Foal Stakes, and she gave her supporters no cause for alarm, for she had Pearlshell at (her mercy all the way, and won with ridiculous ease, Rosabella, who was the only other starter, never having the ghost of a chance when they commenced racing. By far the most interesting race of the day was the Cumberland Stakes, for which there were but three competitors. Mr Gannon was anxious to prove that The Australian Peer was a better colt than Abercorn over a distance in a truly run race, and in order to insure a pace, he determined to risk breaking down Arsenal, whose fore foot was split from the sole to the coronet He had a leather boot and bar shoe specially made for the injured hoof, and openly declared that if Arsenal could make anything like decent running his colt would prove his superiority. There was not much to choose between them in the wager ing, first one and then the other having a slight call, but finally Abercorn left Of a little better favourite than 'The Australian Peer. Ellis, on Arsenal, made the pace as severe as he could, though the Melbourne Cup winner was so sore that he could not make it a cracker. Still he did good service for his stable companion, who took up the running near!) five furlongs from home Abercorn made his effort when they had fairly entered the straight, and at one time looked like winning, but when Power and down upon Mr. Gannon's colt for a final effort he came away, and, amidst enthusiastic cheering, won rather easily. Only seven of the thirty numbered on the card for the- City) Handicap faced the starter, and Algerian was made favourite The Nun also received a lot of support, and the Victorian bred filly at last rewarded her loyal supporters by winning in the commonest of carriers, people wondering how she had been so easily remedied as engineer. and found ing are the details I THE IttO PLATE 300 PLATE, Of 200 80.3 Miner to be sold forloOBO.a Five furlongs.
