TUE MARCH MAGAZINES. In the nineteenth Cuilmy Mr Dicey writes a weighty and well considered article upon the Lgyptian question, to which ho has devoted special attention for many years past Our occupation of that country he saya, has deranged every yung and established nothing in its stead Hie conditions for self govern mont do not exist there and the work of cliectuul reform can only be accomplished by the establishment of a prolonged, if not a permanent, protectorate In conclusion Mr Dicey reminds us how, in the grandest days of lhe Venetian Republic, that power refused to mal e herself mistress of 1 gypt, when she might have done so, and the result was that ' the course of trade passed into other hands and other channels, and the Queen ot the Adriatic became a tradition of the paBt the shadow ol a great name Under the ironical title of 1 casants' Homes Arcady, the Rev Dr Jessop contributes a paper which is directed to BIIOW that tho housing of the poor m the country ia a sub ject of no less pressing importance than that ot housing the same classes in the largo towna And while making out a Btrong case on behalt ot his clients ho does not invoke Government interference, but argues that everything necessary can be done by philanthropic effort, tho amount that is necessary to chango tho whole face of the open parishes in East Angba, for example and to raise the lev el of comfort,

believes, to exercise a hardening influence on their hearts and minds and to render them unfcmimnc lord Dunraven smites the Sabbatarians hip and thigh m au article on the opening of national institutions on Sunday Ho shows that this is desired by an ov erwhelmiug pre ponderancc ot the wage eurning classes in the mother country, that much of the oppoai tion to it is attributable to the disingenuous táctica of the Lord s Day Rest Association, which artfully confounds Sunday opening with nn íncreaso of Sunday labour , that, even if thero were not n majority in favour of it the boon should bo grunted at the re quest of a minority only , that tho fear that the Sunday opening of museums would lead to the Sunday opening of workshops, is a ridiculous bugbeur , that the advocates of tho former aro not unmindful of the value of Sunday , and that whether a mon shall visit a mansion or a pictuio gallery on a Sunday afternoon is a mutter upon which he may justly claim to be guided by his own conscience, and to cxerciso the right of private judgment As to the trans patently fallacious assumption that the opening of such institutions on the first day of the week would entail forced attendance in workshops nnd factories on that day, Lord Dunraven writes -"Nobody wants to work on the day of rest Neither working men nor capí talists desire to do so, and to say that, be causo men wish to amuse themselves rationally on Sunday, they must therefore also be willing to work on that day is absurd 1 o suppose that labour is so completely at the mercy of employ ers of labour is to ignore the history of the last 40 years Even if masters desired to keep their factories mines, shops and commercial undertakings open on the Sunday-which they do not-they could not possibly compel men to work ni them Mr II D 'Iradi presents us with an amusing dialogue between some wild and domesticated animals, in which they interchange their opinions with respect to mau In an article on 'Ship Insurances and Loss of Life nt Sea by Sir 1 homos Brassey, he points out the many CVIIB mci dental to the practice of issuing " valued ' policies und ' time policies, und asserts that, ' if half the

doubted whether the imagination of a romaneo writer could depict anything more terrible than the atrocities practised upon the unhappy creatures who ure sentenced to exile in Siberia by the Russian Government, as described by Prince Krapotkm In 10 years ISO 000 persons have been thus exiled, numbers of them for political offeneeslonly, and the annual*in flux at tho present time averages be tween
