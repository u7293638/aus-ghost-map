AN ACTOR'S STORY. So you want to hear my story, do you ? Well, it's a sad one ; but, though the recital will not bring a smile to your lip, it may prove a useful lesson and serve as a warning to you. All ready? Well, I'll begin. Will 1 Have a drick? No, tbank you! No, indeed, not if it was to save my life! I know you mean no harm by the invitation ; you intend only kindness and courtesy; bnt, if you knew all that the love of Btrong drink has cost me, the sorrow it has brought into my life, and the dark shadow it has trailed aOrOSS mv nathw&v.; T tmlimra fVxif -wjnrt -™1J never again ask me to hold a glass of liquor to my lips. It was of that I was goine to tell you 1 You see, I was travelling in the far West bringing up at last at San Francisco. I was doing variety 'biz,' and little Nell trapeze dancing, etc. Nell? Shewasmylittlegirl— the prettiest creature the sun ever shone on. Didn't know that I was married ? Well, you see your mistake. Poor Katie— my wife ? hers was a;dreadfal fate ! You see, we were playing an engagement at a certain fashion able theatre, when, one night during the periormanoe, a nre brofee out, by accident, behind the scenes. Katie was standing near waiting for her ' call' on, when the flames suddenly burst forth, and, seizing her gauzy dress enveloped her in their horrible folds. And I stood there and saw it all— the writh ing, leaping, red demons winding their deathly arms about the slender form ol my darling : her aconizine shrieks and «??;*--. t^~ meroy, it seemed as if I should go mad. In an instant I sprang forward and grasped her in my arms. I seized a shawl that was lying near, wrapped it around her, and so ex tinguished the flameB. But KatieJ my lovely, bright-eyed darling — she, you'll understand, my friend, I— I can't bear to talk of it — she only lingered a few hours, and died in horrible agony. Pardon these tears. It all happened long ago. I am an old fellow now, and will soon be on tbe retired list of the profession, but the memory of that terrible night still haunts me. It overwhelms me, unmans me, and breaks me down. Well, after that I dung tenaciously (for poor, weak human nature must have some thing to which it out cling), with all the strength of my desolate and stricken heart. to my one ancuor — my only nope, my little Ifell, Oh, how I loved the child t Yea, believe it, even when you have heard my dreadful story. She was bo like her dead mother, with her great, soft, dark eyei, and waving, golden hair, that seemed to catch all the dancing ? sunbeams, and hold them prisoners in it» shining meshes.

W«ll, I'd come to the wrong corner of my life, and when a man once turns that corner he's gone, and no hope for him. Don't look at me so pitifully ; I can's bear pifcv, even from your kind eyes, my friend. ]-.t we hasten to the end of mv ssory— my traeedy. Y«n see, about that time l took to driukicg. I didn't realise 'that I was taking the first ttep on the \jown 1/1*1, tlack; but r had8° many 'friends' (bah I 6,,ch ?« friendB' are really a man', worst enemloB), and they congratulated me on Nell's incceFs, and invited me to drink; and so. elated by all the kind thioga they said (they Were a set of Well-mAnnina Ulnni __J u._._ dreamed at the harmftbey were doing). I got into the habit of drinking with them and! leaving Nell alone when she should have had her father— her only narthly friend— at he* side to protect and care for her. So I went on from bad to worse. You know how fast a man Koes down hlU when he'e once started, aBd at last ifc was all I could do to retain my | position in the company, for I was always | more or Jess intoxicated. I believe it wag «*11 s ewset face and gentle ways that had go won on the heart ol the manager tbat, aside from her popularity, was the cause of my beiog retained with the troupe. Bat I must hasten. One evening I eam« home, cross and out of sorts, to find Nail lying on the couch, white and wan. * -.-»*«- i«o maccer?' i demanded, roughly. *? O rather,' she cried, lifting her soft, sad eyes to my bloated face, ' I feel so bad to-night I I'm right weak and dizzy. Can't *r8t?J»at home for once? Won't you see Mr. Mills, the manager, and beg him to let me off for to-night 1 Truly, I am very ill, and I believe he will excuse me 1' \- Excuse you I' I growled. « Not much I 1 ve made a bet with some men who are to he at the theatre, and I've got fifty dollars staked on your wire- performance. You're to do the new business to-night, you know. I Come, be getting ready 1' Stie put up both little hands whi* - nervous cry. 'O father! father!' she wailed plea-l- mgly, « I cannot— indeed, I cannot do the new act to-night J I'm not able i I shall get dizzy up there and fall. I know it. Father' —her voice grew dignified and firm—' I shall not go I ' Dou'c look at me in that way, my friend ; I can t bear the scorn in yomr face. I was maddened with drink, remember. I was no batter than a savage or a wild beast. I— I— raised ray clenched hand, and— I struck nsy little child 1 Don't— don't speak a word, tot God's sake! . . . Well, I went to the theatre; a spaBm c( remorse touched me, and I determined to till the manager that she was ill and could not appear.. Bat, when I got behind the scenes, to my amazement, little Nell was there before me, frightfully white and wan, and a great, red mark upon one pallid cheek. She came awaignc up to me, and laid her slender hand on mine. 'You didn't mean it, father dear,' the little angel whispered. ? ' I forgive you— and 1 11 try to play my part.' Bat I only pushed her from me and turned away. God ! if I could but recall that night I I would lay my life down willingly to be able to undo that deed. ' Well, the curtain was rung up and the performance began, and went on — and at last came jNeu s new act on the wire — something more reckless and daring than anything she ~ had ever before attempted. She bounded out before the noisy audience like a lovely spirit. The rouge oa her cheeks covered the imprint of a father's dastardly blow ; she was bewitching beyond compare. I shall never, never forget it. The sight that I witnessed that awful night follows me about for ever, like an avenging spirit, and haunts me persistently like some horrible ghost that will not be laid. It has made my lite a bnrden — one long, awful agony ; sleeping or waking, the phantom is evtr at my side and dogs aiy footsteps. I cannot forget it, can not ehnt it out; and eo it will stay with me until the day I die. You cannot imagine the scene. The gorgeous theatre, one flash of light — filled with richly-dressed people — for the eliti of the city were assembled there. The glitter of jewels, the lovely faces, the intoxicatinc perfumes, and over all the soft, low Btrains of music from a matchless orchestra, while above our heads stretched out tbat murderous wire npon which my darling stood, smiling and bowing to the applauding audience — smiling and bowing, when I knew her little heart was breaking. Can you not imagine it all ? Can you not see her, as she goes through with the diffi cult performance ? One tremulous motion, one mistake, and she would ba lost. Seel she turns her frightened eym upon my own, which, with the savage glare of partial intoxica tion, were bent upon her movements. Sae trembles — the diamond-tipped wand in her hand quivers aud drops from her grasp ; she essays to recover herself, bat her little form reels and totters. She stretches out both arms, and with a wild cry of ' Oh, father 1 I cannot do it 1' falls — falls all that horri ble distance, dewn — down. The net spread below is not sfcroDg, she goe* downward — and, oh, God ! my little Nell — my lost Katie's only child — lies a bleeding, mangled mass at the very feet oi the horror-stricken audience ! Dead ! ay, quite dead ! There I That's my story. Dreadful, isn't it r Y«8. 1 am sure that it would be if only it were not founded entirely upon fiction/ Y*tt^ see, my friend, I overheard jou when you said last night I was ' no actor,' «ol tfcooght I'd treat you to « bit of realutic ftctingi Yon wanted to bear my Jttpry, you know* Well, you're heard ifc I didn't say that it was to be a true one. You see, I never had a wife. Little ffell ia but a brain child ; I never followed Horace Greeley's advice: 'Go West,' and variety ' biz' isn't in my line ! Have a toidy, old fellow, aad shake hands on the ' Actor's Story.' Ha I ha ! ha! ? ♦ ? Tub Rxnux Eye.— That wa* an appalling question propounded recently by Dr. Loring to the New York County Medical Society, 'Is the human eye gradually changing its form under the influence of modern civilisa tion?' It is Dr. Loring's opinion that constant Btudy, incidental to the live* of «o many in modern times, has a tendency to engender the derangement of the eve, and ihat this derangemnat is often perpetuated in heredity. , I should agree in tbi« with the doctor, if I could persuade myeelt (which I cannot) thatnwe study »siurd as our *»r*/-v| xatStsrs aid.
