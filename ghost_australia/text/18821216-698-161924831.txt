Eccentricities of Adulteration. Some of the eccentricities of modern adulteration arc dclicately disclosed to the commonwealth of consumers by a contemporary German satirist, in the following neat little fable : â€” ' There were once four flies, and, as it happened, they were hungry one morn ing. The first settled upon a sausage of singularly appetising appearance, and made a hearty meal. But he speedily died of in testinal inflammation, for the sausage was adulterated with ani line. The Eecond fly breakfasted upon flour, and forth with succumbed to ' contraction of the stomach, owing to the inordinate quantity of alum with which the flour had been adulterated. The third fly was slaking his -nun tne contents ot tne milt-jug. wnen violent cramps euddenlv convulsed his frame, and he soon gave up the ghost, a victim to chalk adulteration. Seeing this, the fourth fly, mutter ing to himself, ? The sooner it's over the sooner to sleep,' alighted upon a moistened sheet of paper exhibiting the counterfeit pre sentment of a death's head, and the inscription ' Fly Poison.' Applying tbe tip of his proboscis to this device, the fourth fly drank to his heart's content, growing more vigorous and cheerful at every mouthful, although expectant of his end. But he did not die. On the contrary, he throve and waxed fat. You see, | even the fly porstn was adulterated ! '
