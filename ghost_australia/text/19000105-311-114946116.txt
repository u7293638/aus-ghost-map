A Man of Resource- ' Sir John Watero was the most admirable spy ovor attached to an army. Id the Peninsular War ho gave Lord Wellington tho most accurate and valuable information about the Spaniards "and their movements. On one occasion ho was taken" prisoner by a company of Spanish dragoons while still clad in the English uniform. He was supposed to be a Btupid BriLisher who could no* understand a word of French or Spanish, and his captors conversed freely before him. He learned from his guards, while riding be tween them, that they were going to kill and rob him at an old mill where tho company was to stop for dinner. They would pretend that they shot him becaudo of his attempt to escape. On reaohiog the mill the dragoons dismounted and went into the house, leaving their prisoner outside, in tho hope that he would attempt to escape. The instant they were out of sight, Waters threw his cloak upon a neighboring olive bush, and mounted his cocked hat on top. Some empty ftour sacks lay. on the ground, and into one of them lie crawled. A moment later the dragoons came out, fired their carbines at the supposed prisoner, and galloped off, intending to return later to rifle the body. A horse, loaded with sacks of flour, stood near the door, ana Sir John, still enveloped in the sack, managed to throw himself on the horse's back, as if lie were part of the load. The owner at length came out, mounted, and rode away without detecting the peculiar con tents of one of the sacks. When far enough away for safety, Waters, finding his positiou most uncomfortable, man aged to freo himself from the saek, and sat up. Tho horseman, chancing to look round, beheld the man covered with flour, and took him to bo a ghost perched behind him. Terrified at the sight, he fell over in a swoon, and the eup> posed ghost thrust him to the â–  ground and galloped otf. Sir John reached tho English camp without further adventure, and was warmly greeted by Wellington.
