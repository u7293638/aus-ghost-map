The Sprite of the Creek, REVISED, AND ACCOMPANIED BY NOTES, FOR "BELL'S LIFE IN SYDNEY." \- To the Editor of Bell's Life in Sydney. SIR,--Perhaps it may not be uninterest- ing to some of your readers to learn, that a coincidence somewhat rare will attach to the appearance of the "Sprite of the Creek" in the columns of your interesting and amusing journal, arising from the foll- owing circumstance:--About the middle of the year 1832, a half-sheet hebdomadal was ushered into existence, under the animated title of "Hill's Life in New South Wales," the Proprietor and Editor of which, having learnt from a friend of mine that the mysterious affair of the Campbelltown Ghost was about to be consigned to "immortal verse", requested a copy; as exclusive of the novelty that would attend the debut of the poem in his moiety of the "broad-sheet", the chief part of those who took in that paper possessed more or less knowledge of the principal actors in the tragedy. A manuscript, in rather an indigested state, and unaccompanied by notes, was furnished, and the poem, "with all its imperfections on its head," met the public gaze.--(Here I feel urged to add, that poor "Hill's [paper] Life" had but a brief, though merry career; to which, in a few months, suc- ceeded the extinction of the worthy Editor's "vital spark"). Thus, Sir, after a lapse of fourteen long years, (as Pat would term them), and through mere accident, is the "Sprite of the Creek" doomed to re-appear in a journal, bearing almost a perfect simi- litude of title to that which first introduced it to the "glimpses of the Sun." Your's, most most obediently, FELIX.
