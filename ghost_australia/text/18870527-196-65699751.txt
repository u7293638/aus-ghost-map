SHYING HORSES ARE NEAR SIGHTED. "Why it is that shying in horses should be set down to an ugly dis position I don't know," said a prominent veterinary surgeon. "It must be be cause horsemen'don't know what else to lay ft to. The fact is that it is seldom met with unless the horse is nearsighted. I have tested scores of shying horses for near-sightednese, and in nearly all cases found what I expected. And now when I am asked to give points on buying horses I give this as one of the re quisites: Never buy a. horse that is near- sighted. There are, however, two exceptions to this rule. If the horse is to have a mate, then it doesn't make any difference about the sight. One horse can go blind if the other is clear-sighted. If the horse is to be used for riding to saddle be careful that he is not near sighted, for he will throw you sooner or later. " The reason why a near-sighted horse shies is very simple," the surgeon con tinued. "Of all animals the horse is the most gentle, and even timid. He sees a strange object, and his susceptible mind magnifies it into a monster that is going to destroy him. A piece of white paper in the roadside at night is a ghost, and an old waggon in the ditch is dragon. Every horseman knows thatif you drive the animal close to the dread ful object the animal cools down atonce. It is supposed that it is because the horse makes a closer acquaintance with the object. That is true but not in the sense in which it is generally understood. The animal has not been able to see it from a distance. He is near-sighted.
