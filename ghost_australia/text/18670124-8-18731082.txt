WEST MAITLAND ANNIVERSARY REGATTA. On Tuesday evening a speoial meeting of the regatta oommlttea was held at Qraney's Commercial Hotel, for the purpose of reconsidering a resolution passed at the previous meeting, in referenoe to thß dimensions of the boats lo be entered as watermen's skiffs. After the minutes of the previous meeting had been read, and con- firmed, tho special business was considered The reso- lution adopted at the last meeting was that all boats entering as watermen's skiff, should be of the same dimensions as those in the builder's raoe last year, viz., length, 22ft 6in., and not loss than 22ft.; width not lcBa than 4ft. 9in. in the o'oír; depth, 1 foot 6 ¡nobes ? thickness of plank, $ inoh. Mr. T. Hyndes proposed that the i ule be r»-cmde I ; for the reason that bo knew there wer» not sufficient, boats on the river of the class referred to to run a raoe. Nearly all the watei men's skiffs on the river had quarter inoh planks. He contended that if the resolution were not rescinded the regatta would be a failure. Mr. J. M'Laughlin seconded the motion, and, after a few remarks from other eomtnitteemen, it was put and oarrled by six to four.-Mr. Lachaume then proposed that with the view of equalising the boals they should be handioapped. Mr. K. K. VPolstenholmeseoonded the motion. The general opinion, however, appeared to bs that the boats oould not be handicapped after the publioation of the programme, aud now that the time (or holding the regatta was so olose at hand, The resolution, upon being put to the meeting, was negatived.
