TRYING- TO SLEASE- EVERYBODY. One reader crics your strain's too grave, Too much morality you have, Too much about religion; Give me some witch oand wiard tales, Of slipshod ghosts willth dos and scales, And features like a pigeon. I love to read, another cries, Those monstrous fashionable lies In other words, those novels, Composed of kings, and priests, and lords, Of border wars, and Gothie hordes, That used to live in hovels, No, no, cries one, we've had enough Of such unpleasant love-aick stuff, To craze the fair creation; Give us some recent foreign news, Of Russians, Turks, the Poles or Jews, Or any other nation. The man of dull aecholastice lore Would like to sea little more Of first.rate scraps of Latin The grocer faIn would learn the price Of tea and sugar, fruit and rice; The draper, silk and satin. Another cries, I want more fun, A witty anecdote or pun, A rebus or a riddle; Some wish for parliamentary anes, And some, perhaps of wiser views, Would rather hear a iddle. The critle, too, of clatd i skill, Must dip in gall his gender quill, And scrawl against the paper a Of all the literary fools Bred in our colleges and schbools, He euts the greatest caper. Another ores, I wat o men A jumbled-sp vrariety Variety in all thisge A misellaneoas hdgopodge pin Composed (1 only give the hint) Ormlifd ioa small things.
