MECHANICS' INSTITUTE. Mr John L. Hall with his new dramatic company contributed his quota to the day's amusements in the form of two comedies, entitled 'The Major' and 'The Wander ing Minstrel.' The former is an eccentric comedy in three acts, teeming with farcical situations which give Mr Hall ample op portunity for the display of his powers as a comedian, and he was not slow to take advantage in it, and employ it in a manner which kept the house in a continuous state of merriment. There is nothing particu larly taking in the play itself, but it owed all its amusement to tha capital character Mr Hall made out of the was well supported by Messrs Bellair various situations in it. In this he and Marshall, though the latter was rather stagey. Mrs Byan's acting was very natural, but the part gave her no par= ticular opportunity for displaying her powers. Miss Ansten Eliot and Misi Arrowsmith took their allotted parts creditably, though on oocasions Mr Hall's acting seemed to overcome them as well as the audience, more especially in ' The Wandering Minstrel ' which followed. This is a farce full of absurdities and a general contribution of nonsense which upsets the audience's gravity in spite of themselves. Mr Hall, bringing Shake speare into harmony with the uni ties by EC'.ing Macbeth iu the ' daggec' scene in a ' braid ' Scotch accept, brought down the Louse, and was enoilgh to make Shakespear's ghost rise fiom tyis grave and protest Against such sacrilege. JZe also got much applause in the shape of uproarious laughter for his song ' Villdns and his Dinah,' sung in antethesis to ' When' other lips and other hearts,' by Mr H. D'Eimaine, who has a very pleasant tenor voice of good range. There was a very good house, and the evening formed a pleasant termination to the day's holiday. ] To-night ' Woodcock's Little Game' j will be performed, and followed by the ! ' Wandering Minstrel.'
