Your well-known reputation as a zcalousand devotee' Pastor, and especially your election by the Holy Ghost to-role the Church of God as one of the successors of the Apostles, inspire us with sentiments of con fidence that the interests of our Holy Faith will flourish more and more in you paternal hands, and in confirmation of' this we hnye only to glance at the many works in aid of Religion inaugurated by Yo.ir Lordship's zeal and charity. Remotely situated as we are from the centre of the Diocese, and notwithstanding so many years have elapsetl since we enjoyed the hap piness of welcoming our Bishop, we sincerely trust that the labors of our F iithful Clergy have not been without fruit; and wc will also venture to add that in attachment to the Holy See, and the respect and veneration that are due to tho Episcopal character, we may not bear an unfavora le comparison vy'th the Catholics of more highly favored districts, Praying that God may long spare Your Lordship to preside over ifs, as a Father and Apostle, and promising on our part the most hedrty co-optration and filial obedience, we once more bid you a hearty welcome, and beg Your Lordfhip's Episcopal'blessing; His Lordship in reply thanked the depu tation-for the addr.ess%which .had been pre sented to him, remarking thai every part',6f it was permeeted by a Catholic spirit. Since he had no personal claims upon them he accepted tbe compliment as paid to him in the capacity of a Catholic Bishop. He was gratified at the allusion in it to the pastor of the Mount Gambier Church, as he knew from, personal observation" that the compliment was well deserved ; . and at their willingness to co-operate with liim in any undertaking for the benefit of the church, The deputation then withdrew.

Ho warned them that if they neglected this duty those children would bocomo tlio in strument of God's wrath upon them in this * life, and to many of them the cause of their eternal condemnation on the day of judg ment.
