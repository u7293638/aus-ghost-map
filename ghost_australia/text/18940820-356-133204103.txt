CL.?!I? AGAINST THE QUIGLEY ESTATE. Prohibition Applied for. A MAr?ER in connection with the case of Purcell v." the Perpetual Trustoo Company came before the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice lnoes, and Mr. Justice Foster in Bunco on Friday. Mr. Ralston, instructed by Mr. Davenport, appeared on behalf of the defen dant company, and moved for a rule nisi calling upon Mr. W. E. Henry, P.M., of Wallsend and Plattsburg; E. Cohen, regis trar; and Purcell, the plaintiff in the action, to show cause why a writ of prohibition should not be issued to restrain them from further proceeding upon an order made by the Police Magistrate. It appeared that Purcell was employed by one Moore, who was trustee of the Quigley estate, to do certain work on the estate, and the amount duo was Â£10 3s. Aftor the work was com pleted Moore gave up the trusteeship, and the Porpetual Trustee Company took his place, and as Purcell had not been paid by Moore, he sued the company and recovered a verdict. The company now appealed on the grounds: -1. That the plaint disclosed no cause of action against defendant company. 2. That the magistrate exceeded his jurisdiction, and his decision was contrary to natural juslico in that the plaintiff had no cause of anotion or right to recover against the defendant com puny. The rule was granted, and made re turnable next Friday. On a railway running from Lezama to Bil bao, which was opened last May, an accident recently ocourred which resulted in the loss of 12 lives.
