VICTORIA. MELBOCTBKB, Saturday. William Piïley, sen., was late last ] evening found not guilty at the Criminal Court on the charge of conspiracy to commit perjury, and was discharged. The jury, however, unanimously wished to express its gratification at the statement of the Crown Prosecutor that another presentment was immediately to be filed against Pilley. George Hatherly, 60 years old, while in j a fit last night fell over Princes Bridge on to the railway line below ; but the only injury he received was a dislocation | of the hip. It was a most remarkable eßcape and a most peculiar accident. A widow, named Lavenbury, aged 55, was dreadfully barned from head to foot yesterday evening through her dress catching fire by contact with some fire which she had burning in the yard attached to her residence. A stupid and cruel hoax was practised in the city last night. Some fool attached to the official shipping notice board out- side Elizabeth-street a paper announcing that the R. M.S. Parramatta, which sailed a day or two ago with a full complement of passengers, had been wrecked oft* Cape Leuwin, on the West Australian coast, and that all hands save the mate and one seaman had perished. The two Ballarat municipal councils are again at loggerheads. At a meeting of the Ballarat East Council last night con- siderable umbrage was taken and ex- pressed at the fact that the Mayor of that portion of the city had not been invited to attend the ceremonials in connection with the visit of Sir Henry Parkes on Friday. Daring a very excited scene a large glass chandelier crashed down on the table, sending splinters of glass in all directions. One of the councillors said something about " a gaseous discussion," and that " the unseemly proceedings had been brought along with a ghost into the chamber."
