Childish Fears. -There are few things more degrading to the moral nature than fear, the expec tation of pain. Healthy being is Impos sible under Its influence, and one of onr earliest cares muBt be to prevent Its even entering the atmosphere of a child's life. Timidity and courage are alike easily de veloped, and It la the business of parents to foster toe latter, while avoiding In every way to call the former Into growth. It Is periiaps not too muoh to say that upon the impressions and Influences of the first Beven years of onr life depends our possession of the virtue Qf courage or our servitude to the demon of fear, Man, both In his early and later years, has a dread of the unknown ; to an infant everything Is unknown, and it behoves its parents to watch that no new experience should come to It with fear. A sadden sense of helplessness In solitude may be dangerously terrifying to a baby. The dark is terrible, unless associated with a sense of security and the mother's en circling arms. If on waking they are not quickly reassured by light and attendance , they may suffer agonies of fear long before they can explain what, they are feeling. No children, however young, should over uuor uinagroeauiu ur iriguiiouuig things aald lu their presence. Ghost and goblin stories, murders and terrible de scriptions of every kind — everything capable of exciting fear — must be avoided by toe entire household. An imaginative child will contrive to bnlld, on the smal lest mysterious suggestion, an Image of dread which may hannt Mm for years.
