THE SHIFTING SCENE. THE GHOST OF MRS. O'GRADY. (BY WAMBA.) Michael Patrick O'Grady was rather fond of boasting that he feared neither God nor man, and he would gladly hay of added another word only that conscience would subtly arms, at times and amuse him and make the veriest coward of him. He was unduly susceptible on this point Had you asked him to walk into a fiery fair race in the course of his duty O'Grady would have done if he had done things almost as perilous many a time, but these inner qualunga could not be met and routed by a cool nerve and firm heart Therefore O'Grady became morose, and in moments when liquor had been freely absorbed, his six-foot-two of sinew and muscle became an unpleasantly pronounced personality to the men of the .'. shoot fire station At such times O'Grady would divest himself of all authority that belonged to him as superintendent of the station, and would " go " for his men with a fine spirit of equality that stamped him as a true democrat Now, Hill CO an undersized looking Cockney named Wilkins had been killed at a fire, through some burning timber falling upon him, there was no man at the station who could hold his own with O'Grady Therefore the men began to talk At this little out-station of the Sydney Fire Brigade the dozen men 01 so who comprised the staff were about as good specimens of "the Legion that not er was 'listed " n s could well be found They were recruited from sailors and minors and men who had seen comb in every position of rough Life's hard-ayy hearing, hard fisted, godless to-the very best men in the world for a tight place, and the least desirable for a soft one They were all more or less pro- types of O'Grady, and, like nearly all men of this class, they shared his weaknesses They had looked on death, swift, sudden, and bloody, from a hundred points of view , but scarcely one of them would have put to sea on a Friday, and you could make theRe burly despera- does shake m thin slices if you told them " true " ghost story with sufficient unotion O'Giady'n ghosted story was noted instead of told And this is the story Before Wilkins had been killed he had had many encounters with O'Grady, and had, on occasion?, been brilliantly sucessful He was one of those specious looking little Londoners who seem sent into the world for the express purpose of illustrating the theory that things are not always what they seem His small, shambling, ill-made figure looked neither to have activity nor strength in it, and his large head and goggle eyes gave no evidence of pugnacity however, these matters are mere details When roused Wilkins was memories, and when O'Grady was not available he was always brought out to support the honour of the brigade The night before he had been killed he and O'Grady had enjoyed the luxury of four most exciting rounds-or rather three, for in the last Wilkins was effectually sent to sleep The next night, after the timbers fell upon poor Wilkins, his comrades carried him back to the station, and there, whilst he lay gasping his last breath away, he told one of them a broken story 0 Grace, he said, was haunted Every night for ears post he (Wilkins) had known that the spirit of O'Grady's dead wife visited him and upbraided and tormented him, and then O'Grady would fly out of his bed in a paroxysm of rage and fear and attempt to slay his tormentor , but he was powerless, for he strove with a visitor from another world Then he would go out and got drunk, and all the wlulohisyvifo'sgliostwonld be at his elbow, taunting and tyy fitting him, and O Grady,, maddened to desperation, would return to the station and sail for all and sundry, and it wasn't safe to be in the place with him And Wilkins, having related this circumstantial he turned placidly over on his side and expired The story was firmly credited by all by all except one Saunders, a Taciturn North of Ireland Presbyterian Snttndors never spoke to anyone, but he used to chuckle in his private manner when he heard the others talking under their breath at night time, relating blood-curdling incidents of O'Grady's wife's spirit Saunders was an loose class in regard to the supernatural Still, the men talked, and when O'Grady broke out, as he did about three times a week now, a strange, uncanny feeling would take possession of the men, and life was becoming unendurable at the station The worst of it was that O'Grady had heard the half hints and whispers of the men, and he was as much afraid of his own evil spirit as the others In his sober moments he was still an excellent fireman, but morose, sullen, and half beside himself the thing came to a climax one hot night in January The station had originally been a panto house, and it was one of those old fashioned two storied buildings which are so common in Sydney On the ground floor were the stables and offices, on the first O'Grady had a bedroom to himself, and upstairs lins the men's dormitory Just above this dormitory was a flight of wooden stairs which stopped a few feet short of inky light that looked out on the roof A. man of average height standing on the top of the stairs would be able to rent his arms easily on the skylight, and so comm and an expansive and contemplative view of the sur loundmgroofs This was, in fact, v line Saunders was doing on the night in question. It was murderously hot in the little dormitory below, and he had found sleep impossible So he had risen from his bed just as he was, and mounted the ladder, and was at that moment ruminate ely smoking his pipe over the ledge of the skylight It so happened that a soft moments after Saunders left the dormitory a man named Tiuogan came to bed He had been " out and the boys," as he called it and his head was full of wheeling circles and other strange phenomena that time a milky origin The bestowed himself to sleep in his cot, but his head had scarcely touched the pillow before he found that the room was dancing round and round, the ceiling kept falling in on the floor, and the floor rising to the ceiling, whilst his bed was the centre of a wild and wlinhngmnol strom Under the circumstances Finegan concluded that it was useless to woo slumber, until matters became a trifle more commonplace and he, 311st as Saunders had done, arose, went out of the room and made for the wooden stairs The night was pitch black, and Tinegnn went up the stairs bond down, never dreaming that the course was not clear And so it happened that as Saunders was standing with his legs wide apart, regan's head was projected in between them, and his hair brushed the naked skin The moment Saunders felt the strange sensation he closed his legs like a vice on the foreign object, and at the same time all the supernatural and blood curdling stones of the last few weeks rushed across Finegon's mind, and he let out a loud tell , but, at the same time, with a natural MileBmn impulse, he let out with both fists Saunders relaxed his leg grip, slid down on the other's back, returned the punches with a will, and the men grappled and rolled down the stairs Pinegnn, yelling like a madman that the Banshee had gU him, struck out all the while at the invisible ghost, and down the next flight of stairs the two rolled, till they were brought up w to a bump against O Grudy's bedroom door Saunders realised his peril in a flash, and with a supreme effort he got himself free as he heard O Grady's footsteps on the floor, opened the door of the room, and throw Tinogan bodily In Then he crept upstairs quietly, made his way silently to his bunk, and listened in quiet enjoyment to the conjectures of his mates 6 2 6 . What happened when O'Grady seized ITinegnn was related by the latter -"There was further 111 his of win he got a hold on me, and I swore by the Holy Virgin I'd seen the Evil One Thin ho presse 1 ma and his questions and at last I up and told him that I'd seen his wife's spirit, and she flew at me like a wild tiger and cudgelled and pummelled me till I was black and blue and at last picked me up like a handful of shavings and throw me into the room and was in I'd finished," concluded Finegan, and showed him my back and arms, his face was like a dead corpse in a fainting fit " s s s, s . Tiuegnn's australia and indeed created considerable effect on O'Grady The moment after he had turned I mean out of his bedroom he rushed down to the man on watch below, and questioned him as to Tinegnn's condition when he came home "Perfectly sober, sour," was the untruthful reply Thru O'Grady went back to his room, and (Sat for an hour or so with white and scared face tin mug matters over, and then I t * * * The next morning O'Grady did 11 it turn up to master and he was missing at breakfast there was a coiiMiltitiou unions the men but not one of them dared go to the 'haunted" room, not one, except S Hinders he got no response to his knock, so he pushed the door open and walked in O'Grady was hanging by the neck from a hook in the wall in the flesh and in the spirit Mr O'Grady had been too much for him
