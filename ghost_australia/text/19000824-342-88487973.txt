THE PRICE OF CLEANLINESS. i ; R?ther a novel mode of beeping warm during the cold weather was pur sued by a vagrant, who was found by a constable in a dying condition during the week. ^The man was discovered huddled up; in a doorway, and was nothing but a bundle of rags and filth, Ins make-up m this respect being per fect. To make the disguise more per fect his tattered garments were stuffed with a quantity of straw and old news papers, which also gave shelter to a swarm of 'canny wee beasties,' the man being literally alive with vermin. The luckless vagrant was removed to the hospital, but the thorough cleans ing he was subjected to at that institu tion was too much for his enfeebled: frame, and he gave up the ghost with his parasite bedfellows, for in death they were not divided. For a state of sublime unclcanhncss your city loafer is hard to beat, even the odoriferous Oriental, with his religious aversion to anything approaching soap and water, luns him a bad second, and that is say1 ing a lot.
