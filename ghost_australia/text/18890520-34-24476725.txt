THE REV. F. HASTINGS'S WEL COME. TO THE EDITOR. I am, &c.;, CHRISTIANUS. Sirâ€”Together I am sure with a very large number of colonists I looked forward with a good deal of anxiety to see what sort of man the new pastor of the important Congregational Cturcb at North Adelaide would show himself to be. Mr. Hastinga'e speech at the welcome creeticg may fairly be taken as giving eorce insight into the rev. gentleman's line of thought. Much of that speech was excellent in conception and expression, bat surely Mr. Hafcticpe was betrayed into both an illogical and uncharitable position when in dealing with tbe great qnpstion of Christianity he quite un necessarily scoffed at baptism and expressed tAe desire to" emaeh priestism." Perhaps Mr. Hastings does not know that &t; least one-third cf the professing Cbtistian? in the colony to which he has come regard the command of onr Saviour that the apostles were to "Make di?ciple? of all the nations, baptising them into the name of the Father, and of the Bon, and of tbe Holy Ghost," as constituting baptism an unalterable obligation of membership in Christ; 'and that they also look upon the declarations in the Epistle to the Hebrews that we have in Ohrist a "high priest," and that "we have an altar," as mak ing eternal the great principle of priesthood. In any case the rev. gentleman xnnet upon re flection see that the cause of unity and charity will be be?t served by refraining from giving prominence to his dissent from doctrines held through all the centuries of Christianity, and if be must express his own opinions he will, I am sure, come to see that he ought to do so under the chastening control of tbe neatest of the cardinal Christian virtues-
