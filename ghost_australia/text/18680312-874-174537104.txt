A Lament. (PICKED UP AT THE BALLARAT RAILWAY STATION ON FRIDAY EVENING LAST.) ALAS ! poor JONES is sadly flitting To his friends, and, low brows knitting, In a railway train is sitting, Wildly tearing off his hair; And as evening shades come o'er him, Then his rivals' ghosts before him Seem to rise, and mock and bore him— Worn and weary with despair. Wet are now the eyes once glowing, Gone is now the air once knowing, Gone the chance of trumpet blowing From the pot-house balcony; Driven from this wealthy city, Humbugged by his own committee, Object of reproach and pity, Whither, whither shall he flee ? " Oh, confound those Melbourne papers— Those vile literary scrapers, That exposed my former capers To the men of Bungaree; Oh, alas I it is too trying, All my little schemes sent flying; Nothing now is left but crying- All is up with wretched me!" Still, he giveth way to groans, Tells his woes with piteous moans, And waileth forth in hollow tones— " Sold again by Bungaree; Instead of being JONES, elected, Alas ! I'm only JONES, rejected; Crest-fallen, cast away, neglected— Weep, dear public, weep for me."
