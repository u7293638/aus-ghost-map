Tasmanian International Exhibits. \--4, The industrious women of this colony who for months worked away cheerfully prepar- ing exhibits for the Woman's Court could not have had the inkling of an idea of the heartburnings for which they were laying the foundation. With true artistic instinct they designed, cut, stitched, and painted for the love they bore towards their work. Their lights were all hidden beneath town and country shades, awaiting only the opportunity to reflect pleasure upon all who should gaze upon their handiwork, and seeking only the approbation that true work deserves, and, to our credit be it said, invariably receives. Very different appears to have been the spirit in which the ladies who volunteered to place the exhibits to the best advantage have been playing what is at most a secondary part in the matter. It would be difficult to define the position into which the Women's Ooinmittoo have now drifted, whatever might have been their individual) motives in agreeing at the commencement of affairs to act. But from what an eye witness has to say about the proceedings at the meeting Lady Gormanston presided over yesterday it is evident that considerable friction has prevailed lately, and apparently increasing in strength until the committee seems likely to appear in one act of spontaneous combustion consequent upon an explosion of small and ignoble feelings. The " new woman " in Tasmania evidently has not had sufficient experience to be able to deal with unruffled serenity in motions, amendments, and the like appertain- ing to orderly and regular procedure. The spectacle of between 20 and 30 ladies meeting early on a Monday morning and " going for " each other in vigorous rhetoric over such a simple matter as placing the beautiful works sent in to them is not edifying, nor calculated to inspire confidence in the logical faculties of the sex just now asserting its rights " in all parts of the world. A special feature about the Tasmanian Mineral Court is the admirable labelling of every specimen. From the largest down to the smallest each exhibit is legibly placarded, so that those most ignorant of mineral substances, people who would mistake the Gormanston the nugget for a slab of blue metal or a dish of silver concentrates for unclean sand, can educate themselves and blossom forth into more or less " authorities" on the mineral resources of the colony. The plan of the label is to state the locality where the specimen was obtained, its name, and comparative value. Additions continue to be made to the I agricultural trophy, tending to make it more interesting and instructive There is a tastefully executed plan of the Eastfield experimental plots, Inch Mr Frank Maddox is cultivating under the auspices of the Council of Agriculture The plan is the work of Mr Maddox, who carries his experiments to a high pitch of perfection, and he has exercised considerable skill over the execution of his illustration, which conveys a clear idea of the work in detail Mr John Hope, of Sheffield, has forwarded a couple of small bags of the famous "Red skin" potatoes From Port Esperance, Mr W P Clennett has sent some fine specimens of English grasses freshly pulled from his paddocks, comprising cocksfoot (or, as the Americans call it "orchard grass), English rye grass, Crested Dogstail, meadow foxtail, Italian rye grass, smooth stalked meadow, Yorkshire fog, and sweet scented vernal Messrs Burgess Bros have arranged to supply teas for afternoon brewing in the Women's Court A celebrated Australian caricaturist is expected in Hobart to hop round for Exhibition work in a week or two. The efforts of the Artisans' Committee, led by Mr Beards, are producing results in the direction of securing now exhibits, and the Court is rapidly filling up and approach- ing completion The French Commissioner, Mr Laurolle, recon oil a further consignment of exhibits bytheUMS Kaikourayesterday and will have his Court, which already bristles with novelties, finished in a day or two Information was received from Sydney yesterday that the fine art exhibit from New South Wales was being prepared for train ditto despatch. The experiences of Captain McArthur, who is the Customs officer in charge of the Exhibition has to practically live on the premises and keep a vigilant watch night and day, will prove interesting reading at the end of the ensuing six months At 5 o'clock yesterday morning he was alarmed 1 by Mr Lindeman, one of the restaurant proprietors, who reported that the monkeys were loose again, and attacking his poultry Wild and unearthly shrieks UB of a regiment of Chinese guards being routed by Japanese troops of the line confirmed the intelligence, and the bugle sounded the assembly for the attendants On marching round to the pleasure gardens, a large monkey was discovered trying to capture a fat turkey rooster It was a very exciting scene The monkey sparred round the turkey, but the latter defended its position vigorously. Each combatant used his own particular language, but as neither understood the other, the confusion was worse confounded Mr Lindeman gently addressed the monkey as "Jacko," and ap- pealed to him to retire and leave the turkey alone, the hour being too early even for an altercation of this kind But "Jacko" only capitulated to force and peace was restored in the poultry yard At about 2 10 on Sunday morning two disciples of Bacchus created a disturbance on the north wing of the building and v, out through a programme of unpublished musical items Yesterday morning, just after the hour when ghosts are reputed to walk, cries of "murder" were heard from a feminine throat. The Exhibition guard turned out, but discovered nothing Among the announcements for to-day are Miss Mills'Brinsmead pianoforte recital in the British Art Gallery from 4 to 5 an exhibition of specialties by Messrs Webster 4, Son in the machinery section , repetition of the Whitehead torpedo lecture by Artificsr Roberts, with the Military Band, and other attractions, as mentioned in the adler Use ment appearing in another column
