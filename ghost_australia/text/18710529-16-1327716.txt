EAU WAY EXTENSION. MEETING- IN IPSWICH. (FROM OUR SPECIAL REPORTER.) A public MEETING- of the inhabitants was held at the School of Arts, Ipswich, on Friday evening, for the purpose of taking into consideration the subject of railway extension The hall was densely crowded, there being between 900 and 1000 people present Amongst those on the platform were the Hon J M Thompson, Messrs G Thorn, MLA, J Ferrett, M L A , Johnston, M L A , Forbes, MLA, B Cribb, ML A W H Groom MLA O'Sullivan, the Mayors of Ipswich, Brisbane, and Toowoomba, Alderman Hogan, and Mr J Hardgrave, Brisbane, Ac The Mayor opened the proceedings by reading the requisition and the advertisement convening the meeting It now became their duty to elect a chairman On the motion of Mr P O'Sr/urvAN, the Mayor was called to the chair The OiUiiiAtAî. thanked them for the honor they had done him The meeting was one of great importance probably to the colony, and he trusted that every speaker would get fair hearing and he listened to attentively (Hear, hear) No doubt there was some difference of opinion concerning this question of railway extension, but still he thought that every one should be allotted to give expression to her opinions upon it, for then, after hearing both sides of the question, they would be better able to form a correct opinion of what would be for their good and the good of the colony generally (Cheers.) He would now call upon the mover of the first resolution M P 0'bU_.__VA>|W_o was warmly received, moved the first resolution, as follows - reeling the forcible effect of the close illusion after the following debate In the I legislate of Assembly met tim SUING intent action thereon of the Ministry In the House and elsewhere. the decision arrived at in the Legislative Council at their last sitting and the firm tone of opinion expressed at p three meetings held in other towns It is the opinion of this meeting that the time has with oil it when it is absolutist necessary for the interests of this community to reconsider the question of railway extension throughout the colony. He said that although the resolution was very oppressive in itself, he would crave their undue gence to make a few remarks concerning it The resolution stated, at least it insinuated, that the colony was at present at a stand still Parties in the House of Assembly were evenly divided There were sixteen members in favor of the extension of railways and of public works, and the settlement of the colony (Hear, hear ) There were sixteen the members who were opposed to this policy, and the consequence was that at the present moment legislation could not proceed (Hear, hear) they were at a dead lock, and it was his belief that the Ley of that lock was in the hands of Ipswich, and West Moreton (Cheers) The members of the Opposition in the House represented somewhere about two thirds of the population of this colony Those members said that we had been idle too long, that they had been coming up to the rest and caution policy-the humdrum policy-long enough, and that it was time that the colony should advise (Hear hear.) They say that to stand still is to go back, and that the colony cannot possibly stand in its present position without going back The party who uttered these sentiments represented two thirds of the population of the country There was another party in the House, who were the squatters of the colony, and they said that the colony was well enough, and that they should let well enough alone they hold the government of the country in their hands, and they represented one section of the people of the colony only, and they wanted class legislation there was not a man in that Got ornament but a squatter They were perfectly ulivotothcirotvn interests and they say, in opposition to the others, that the colony was doing well enough, and that the better plan would be to let well enough alone This was the real question before the country at the present time the squatters, who were now the governing body of the colony, owned half the country they went down to the Assembly and made themselves a present of half the country for ten years, and gave themselves the same right to the other half as any body else This was in the settled districts, but in the unsettled districts they had the whole of the country for twenty one years (Cheers) They had fenced it in, discharged their white laborers employed a four blocks, and then they will tell you that everything was well enough (Hear hear) Wborothoro were forty or eighty men employed on a station a few years ago, they would now find that station managed by two or three blacks, and a boundary rider at a salary of £20 per annum validated his own horse if he were put to the test he could give instances of where this salary was paid Those gentlemen thought that things were doing very well They can manage their stations at very little oOBt they cannot be doing better (Hear, home They did not forget their own interests Every year in the Legis lative Assembly they passed Pastoral Relief Act to believe the squatters who went smash (Hear, hear ). If a merchant in that town or any other town smashed or turned insolvent did anybody over hear of an Act being passed for his relief (Cheers ) The consequence of all this was that the people are unemployed and what were they to do with them ? (Cheers ) What was to become of them Nowhere can they got employment? The question was very clear as soon as, they raised £5 or £10 they were off to California or New South Wales, or some place olsc-(elieoi.))-and this was the very exact thing which this faction required (Cheers ) They had now an Act before the House by which £100 000 of land orders were to be confiscated Ever thing to prevent settlement Out of the £100,000 the Government, he believed, would themselves pocket about £53 000 This land order system had been an actual swindle on the part of the Government (Cheers) People were induced to come out here with a promise of this land order The immigrant arrived here and the Government then acted the part of a pawnbroker, and gave him an advance of £6 upon his land order (Hear, hear The poor man was then, perhaps, obliged to go up the country to look for a living The probability was that the first year, or perhaps the second, did not go very well with him, and he was then, perhaps, 500 miles up the country. He said to himself that he would wake up some money for two or three years, and go and take up land, but if he were then to Ipswich or Brisbane to purchase land with his land order, it would cost him more than the price of it (Hear, hear ). This was the very same principle that acted against the cotton bonus in that district The faction in power had thrown every obstacle in the way of settlement they continued even to that day to say that Queens land would not grow a cabbage, and that every occupation was disreputable but squatting (Cheers ) This was the faction that was ruling the country at the present day, and who were supported by the members for Ipswich and West Moreton (Cheers ). In that m.oving calling upon these gentlemen to reconsider the verdict which they came to at the last election, it was not intended to cast any disrespect upon their members, because these gentlemen had kept the pledges which they gave the people faithfully (Cheers ) There was therefore no person in that House who could blame these gentlemen many ways what over lOsers In fact they merited their approbation for the members for that town and die! net were never known to stick as well to gether since Separation (Cheers ). He could only say for himself, that if the question of railway extension was approved of, and these gentle in n came before their constituents again, he would vote for the whole six members In speaking of these six members he remembered that it had been said that he had a down upon one of them He could only say that he never knew it before It had been stated that he had spoken disrespectfully of Mr Thompson, and he would take that opportunity of denying that he had either publicly or privately spoken disrespectfully of that gentleman With his private character he had nothing to do, and he was surprised that such a question should have been introduced at all He considered that Mr Thompson was the best and most able member they had (Cheers.) He had also been charged with calling Mr Walsh the arch potter of the Ministry (" Question, Railway ") He would come to the railway immediately in saying that Mr. Walsh was the arch potter of the Ministry his reason was that that gentleman had managed to divide the constituency of Brisbane and East Moreton from Ipswich and West Moreton, in order to weaken the power of the farmers and citizens, so that the squatting class could walk in between them Not only that, but at the time of the extension of the bonus for cotton, he took the opportunity of saving that they were all a lot of paupers in Ipswich and West Moreton He would now give his reason for going in for extension of railways and public works He had been held in Ipswich for a long time, where he had great possessions in the shape of children, houses, and other property (Hear, hear ) For the last three or five years since the railway had been finished he had been looking about him to see whether that property would realise its value No person find a better right to oppose railways than him By the introduction of railways he was a personal loser to the amount of about £700 per annum cash, and besides that, there was tim dop isolation which his property had undergone He had studied the matter for the last two or time years and looked around him for a way out of this difficulty But how could they got out of it, with the railway having neither beginning 01 and like Mahomet's coffin, hanging in mid-air (Cheers ) As a respectable tradesman of that town had said to him a few day before, they were stuck in the mud, and then best plan was to get out of it the best way they could (Cheers.) He had come to the conclusion that they could easily improve this colony in the same way. that America had been improved, and the principal things that bad be on in that country to its present state were free lands, public works, and immigration (Cheers ) He did not know whether the oar wage of goods by the inter 61 the train was the cheapest 01 dearest He did not sit down to work out the kind of vulgar fractions at all His object was to see whether it would improve the colony directly or indirectly Whether it would give the people who were at present leaving them plenty of our ployment (Cheers) The answer to this would be were they proposed to submit to more taxation (2 No, no," and "Yes, yes ") Now he was personally as unprepared to submit to any more taxation as any of them, for he considered he already paid taxation enough, and on that account he ob voted to the vote that was given upon this question by their members for railways in the North If they believed that railways would increase the taxation they should have been consistent and not voted for the extension of the Northern railway But he denied that public works would increase the taxation He believed that if they stood in the position they were now in the taxation would inevitably increase but if they add to their population, and know how to settle that population by a judicious system of reproductive public works, he said that those people would share with them the taxation, and it would become less (Cheers) If they doubled the population, the income to the revenue would be also doubled and not only that, but they would have added to the wealth of the colony the over production of every immigrant (Cheers) In America they considered that every immigrant was worth about £100 per annum to the State But while they repainted in this stand still position, what would become of the colony what would become of their children how were they to dispose of their youth? (Hear, hear) Were they to make them drovers or bullock drivers, shepherds, or cattle dealers ? Could they point out, in the position in which the colony at present was any way of getting rid of them or providing for them ? (Cheers ) A few y em s back there was in that town as fine a population of mechanics, tradesmen, and laborers a' could be found in any town in the colony Now they were walking about the streets with nothing to do (Hear, hear ) The increase of taxation was got up to frighten them, but he thought they would rather be in a position to pay £5 for a bag of Hour than not buy one at all (Hear, hear ) Hub was a question between the mechanics, tradesmen, and the working classes, and the governing class They said that they were Bring and settled us they were, that they should let well enough alone But they should not be satisfied with this If they had a railway to Roma, a railway to the Boy, and a railway in the North, they could then scour of for that town the trade of the border for five or six hundred miles, and there would be then I only an hour and a half's delay from the ter miiiUB (Cheers.) He would not delay the moving any longer as he know there were a great many other gentlemen to address them (Oin ors ) Mr. James Foote would ask the chairman if this meeting was called for one party, or if they were prepared to hear both sides of the question The OnAiinrAt. said that he thought the meeting was quite prepared to listen to any one who was able or willing to speak upon the question Mr James Lmxii Ha. (who was received with mingled cheers and groans) came forward to second the resolution, because be thought that in all probability its result would be to effect some little in prot moment in (his poor old town that he had been a resident of for so many y ears He believed that a system of public works 'ves required, not only there but in every other part of the colony, to induce some change in their affairs and bring about a circulation of money (cheers), and without this was done they could not thrive (Hear, hear.) He was no end I cr, and they might not there fore expect a speech from him, but there was one thing to which he thought it absolutely necessary to allude It had been said that the extension of the railway would damage Ipswich (hour, hour, and no, no), but he could not understand how it was possible to make it worse than it at present was (Hear, hear) It cer family could not be done by the railway s The thing was this, that they must have something to bring about a satisfactory state of the colony Then houses were at present tenantless, and the grass was growing in their streets, and in a short time if there were no change, the heads of the squatters would come into the poor old town, to cut the grass off their streets (Hear hear) If they were to resist this state of things they must have money put incirculution (Hear, hear ) What was a million of money ? ( W o|ce " Nothing ") When he was in the old country, the people thought there that Queensland was the grandest place imaginable, with an immense territory, in which there was plenty of land for every one and so undoubtedly this was the case, but they required money to make it what it should be (Cheers ) The matter of the railway was one in which they all agreed, and what he said was, that because the government had a majority of one in the House to oppose it was no reason why they should not have the railway from Ipswich to Brisbane and deep water If they only hold out, they would cause the Government to appeal to the people Mr Pettigrew, who was received with great cheering, said that he came forward with the healing salve-the cure all He was in Brisbane about a fortnight ago, and he went to a public meeting there, and he went on the platform and was received with great applause They believed that he had come down to turn traitor, and so they received him warmly, but when they found that he was come down to tell them a little of the honest truth their time was soon turned (Cheers ) Mr. O'Sullivan when he went down was received very differently He must say that he had never heard Mr O'Sullivan nfltko such a lame speech as he had that night, and the reason was that he did not believe in the Ipswich and Brisbane Railway Mr 0'3tJLLirAh rose to order Mr Pettigrew should keep to the question. (Cries of " Sit down, we have heard you ") The CHAIRMAN hoped that every one would get a quiet hearing Mr Petiiomievv did not intend to quarrel with anyone, and he would come to the quest tun The question was railway extension ¡ and he was prepared to more on amendment upon the motion, and it was to the following effect - "That this meeting while in favor of an extension of the Southern and Western Railway to some suitable place in the south western shores of Honiton Bly so on as to the mci it off lies of the colony w fruit its construction has also of ory confide coln the Goto in ment nuts approves of the noble stand they are taking .?unhisUudlscriinluuto uiHliiuroiuuuomii of public expenditure He was in favor of the railway, but that railway was to carry the produce of the south arm and western districts to a port (Cheers ) The railway which they were now desirous of making em ned the produce to South Brisbane, and they were then as far from a shipping port as they were in Ipswich He had got a few figures which he would read to them Mr HrMiBEV This is not an amendment upon the motion The second resolution which we propose is exactly similar to it. The CitAiuiiAV said that Mr Pettigrew was perfectly in order in moving this amendment Mr Piîitiobkvt would prove to them that the making of this railway which he proposed would be a saving of £700,000, which would have to be spent in deepening the river from Brisbane to the Bay He believed that it was 47 miles to Victoria Point, and to make a line of railway those, say at £8000 per mile, which was a high estimate, would be £300 000 The terminus and other works would cost about £10,000 more, making a total of £370 000 The interest on this sum, as they would require to borrow the money, would be £22,200 per annum He might tell them that of course they would have to pay for it. It was not the squatter that would have to pay, but those (Hear, hear ) the deepening of the life of -Hanoi.'

(Hear, hear) Nott, they could have a i away from their ton u to deep water for £370 000, which the largest ships in the world could run) alongside of He was told as a fact that forty five feet of water could be always found those (-Aroico By sinking a well) Hooouldptoto it to them Their fi onda here said that they wanted a i railway to a shipping port and they should bring, the line to where they could yet one CLear, he u ) He did not see the fun of making a i army down to Brisbane (of all the people that would travel by it How many people, he would ask, would that 1 to Brisbane in a fit of of mouth ? He had occasionally gone up the Southern and Western Railway, and he had tilnujB travelled second class, and the only people whom he met nimbly saw in the first of its carriages were members of Parliament organ lemon connected with the Railway Department they were to have a special railway, and not for the winners and the other classes, but to accommodate such men as W. H. Groom and H B Fair, who could come down in it without having to pay the fare by Cobb and Co a coach Mr Pettigrew, at considerable lang h, quoted from the report and evidence or the Commission to show that the railway was not required to Brisbane He was in favor of a mi tray to Victoria Point, in the language of the amendment, as soon as the financial affairs of the colony would vari at those entering upon it Now he would ask them, as men, seriously, Did the financial affairs of the colony warrant them going further into debt at present ? (No, no and Yes, yes ) For every inch of railway Bindon for the future they would have to pay the interest on it, and they know perfectly well that to pay that in recent required further taxation (No, no, and i es, you) Could they tell him a single article that was not already taxed in this colony P If they did not feel it directly, they did not feel the p not But he could assure them it was quite us not one as if it was direction fact it was worse, because there was it commission charged upon the ad valorem duties, which they had to pay (Hear, hear) They were told that this railway would do the work- ing classes a good deal of good that if would improve their condition eoii-nleriibly lins he doubted control they had heard a great deal about the squatting Government, and that they were doing them all the injury Mr O'Sullivan had said that they had made them selves a present of one half of their runs He would like to know where Mr O'Sullivan thus when they did this, for he was a monitor of the Parliament Why had he allowed them to take half their runs f They were told also that these railways would increase population. He would ask what became of thousands that came here to construct the railway ? Could they find 100 of these men settled upon the fluids of the colony? No they had not settled down, and such a class of population never did He had in his hands a pamphlet from which he would lead them a few extracts bearing upon this question He quoted at some length to prove that navvies were a useless class of immigrants and that they noted por momently enriched a country He would ask what advantage tina military would be to the cotton growers of West Moreton ? What ad vantage to the residents of the lil labour River except to grind them into the dust? He had visited a man lately in the Rosewood Scrub, and he had told him that there had been no kind of meat in the house for six months but wallaby Those were the men who would have to pay, while they got jobbers like Fitzgibbon, and Brady, and Francis to rob the country (Hear, hear ). This brought him to the second part of the resolution they had every confidence in the Government, and approved of the noble stand they were making against indiscriminate and unremunerative public expenditure If any men in first meeting had a light to oppose the present Government personal grounds it was himself, for he had lost money by them But at the same time he would not allow his private feeling to go against the public good He would not cut off his nose to spite his face He said that the Government deserved their utmost confidence and support, and he trusted they would stand firm (Cheers ) What was the humbug of the great Liberal party which was represented by Mr O'Sullivan and a few gentlemen behind him (No, no, and Yes, yes ) About eighteen months ago he was appointed one of a deputation to wait upon the Government of that day, of which Messrs Lilley and Stephens were members, concerning the cotton bonus He tried to got something definite from them, and what was the i osultPonoMimstcr dodged him and another defend him, and they had to come away without any satisfaction they had had large meetings in Brisbane lately, and they wished to make the world believe that Brisbane was the colony, and a great deal more (Hear, hear ) they had also meetings at Toowoomba, Dalby, and Rockhampton, which were got. up by the mayors But they all know what mayors were Did any person believe in them ? They know how they were made, as well as J. P. , and a blackfellow would not take the opinion of three fourths of them. (Cheers ) Then they had the great Dr O'Doherty crying out "No Surrender," and "We will drive them into a corner," and one miserable lunatic had written to the Courier to say that Mr Macalister must give up the Speaker's chair to hold out the threat that if he did not do this he would be rejected for every constituency at the next election But he (Mr Pettigrew) was prepared to say, and that meeting would endorse what he said, that if Mr Macalister wanted to come to Ipswich they would be glad and happy to receive him (Hear, hear ) Such abominable bounce us this could only come from some man like " Calico Duck " (Hear, hear ) Why was this village of Brisbane called the capital of the colony ? It was only half way down the creek, in the neighborhood of Frogs' Hollow and Mud Creek, and it was this miserable place that wanted to dictate to the rest of the colony (Great cheering ) They only wanted more railways that they might have more salaries to pay away, and more men riding about in their carriages. (Cheers.) Brisbane was not a shipping port, and before any further railway extension was made, and before they consented to increase the taxation, they should as wise intelligent men see that the railway was made to some place that would be suitable to take the exports of the colony both North and South-away in the largest ships and at the lowest rates (Cheers If they could take wool from Sydney for 3d per lb and they had to pay 2d , then he said it was monstrous and absurd to ask the of farmers and producers of the colony to pay more taxes that it should con- tinue (Great cheering) Mr Jas Foote, in seconding the amendment to the resolution, said he sincerely regretted that they should be divided in their interests for the town or district could not be affected for good or cut without them all feeling it more or less (Hear, hear) The object for which this meeting had been called was not so much to consult the interests of Ipswich and West Moreton as to give a helping hand to a Brisbane action that had taken it into their heads that the railway should be extended to Brisbane, and any amount of reasoning, bott ever good, was not sufficient to dissuade them that it was not necessary (Cheers ) The question of necessity might be laid aside, inasmuch as the proposed extension was along the bank of a navigable river, which, in the present state of the colony, was quite capable of transmitting all the goods to and fro for the next fifty years (Cheers) The question was not the earning capabilities of the mer steamers, neither had there been any attempt made to show that the business of the interior was impeded for want of the railway There had been an attempt made by the late Commission to show that if the river a mile could be transferred to the railway at the expense of the country, it would probably pay the increased the money expended in its constr notion, but not its working expenses , but it was no part of the work of the faction that was to oil king up the unfit at excitement to go into the matter of profit or loss they did not care whether is paid or not, so long as the extension to Brisbane was completed (onions), and no further (Cheers) Although, for the purpose of getting support, they proposed an extension in the North (Head, hour ) If then own purpose was served, they would oppose the extension in the North (Lead, them Evi faith in their iJois Brisbane was Queensland, and Queensland Brisbane (Hi in, June) The present proposal was to extend the, railway to Brisbane, and then spend double the amount of the cost of construction in clearing the area between Brisbane and the Bay (Hear, hear) If there was a necessity for a railway between this and Brisbane, why surely the same necessity must exist for a line between Brisbane and the Bay But that this not a part of the Brisbane scheme, and therefore could not be thought of The country had seen that the extension it is not required at the present time (Cheers ) There was an appeal to the country on the question, and the ton chief was that the people did not require in the house had also decided against it, and now it was tried by unconstitutional means to wrest it from the Government (Hear, hear) The Government were threatened with a stoppage of supplies, but let them try it and he hoped they would and the burden would fall upon the light Bli millers, for he was sure there was not a town in Queensland in greater need of Government money, than Brisbane (Cheers) the half of the population of Brisbane would be insolvent within six weeks after the stoppage of supplies (Chee is What the country south required had been lost sight of by the great agitator of public inter- oats They wanted to induce settlement to give the people roads, so that a lion they had grown a crop they might be able to bring it to market (Cheers) They wanted to settle those districts through which the railway already passed, not after their names of their Warwick, Toowoomba, and Dalby friends, who allowed the whole country to be fenced in for sheep walks to such a degree that there was scarcely room for a single farmer to settle on all the land between Toowoomba and Warwick (Hear, hear, and cheers ) they did not want sheep walks and wife Iuiicob, with morning labor excluded (Hear hear ) They wanted population and he said that the country had spent enough on railway b at present, and they should let the Government turn their attend to the improvement of the goods in good agricultural districts, and by this means facilitate the settlement of population (Cheers ) How much wiser would this friends in the west have been find they narrowly watched their own interests, and not placed their faith in a Brisbane faction, and prevented that vast monopoly of the lands on the Darling Downs I (Cheers) How must is better would Toowoomba, have hired wich half a million of population scattered among those plums, i rather than what it was at the present moment a solitary Bbecpnnlk ' This hub a very broad question, and much might be said upon if but he saw no |[ use to waste the time of the meeting (Ohoeia ) Charity began at home, and they should con- -idea that the interest of this town and West Moreton, and then the interests of the country (Cheers) their interests could be seen at a glance they find no difficulty in getting their produce to a shipping port without a railway (Cheers) They experienced no delay they had a market here for the pro duct and at a better price than they could obtain in Brisbane they would ship then freight on their own account, and they would see by the evidence of Mr Quinlan that the difference was paid by the ship, and they could get on advance upon it without interest (Cheers They could not be in a better position if there with a railway up one side of the river and down the other 'J hour greatest dash cult) was in getting their produce to market in consequence of bad roads (Hear, hear ) For the purpose of getting the support of the working men it was sought to prove to them that this railway would give them work, at 7s per day This might be possible, but he hoped they were not to be caught by arguments of that class (Cheers ). If they allowed their memories carry them back, they would son that when the railway was first constructed, laborers came in by thousands, like swarms of bees , every since was crowded with them from the other colonies, and they swallowed up everything, and, like locusts whom they had eaten up all that was to be bud, they then took their departure And the same thing would occur This year, because the other colonies were at present very Hut, and there was a great many idle men both in New South W lion and Victoria (Cheers He would now come to what he considered the inconsistency of two gentlemen belonging to the Opposition, Messrs Lilley and stephens Two years ago they were members of the Ministry, hence the Governor Blackall, steamer (Cheers ) They were continually bored by their constituents for this railway, but they told them the country was not yet in a position to afford it But no sooner had they got ousted from power, and better men in their places, than they turned round and began to clamor for the very work which they had said the country was not in a position to construct (Ohocra ) He was sorry to say that the country was not in a much better condition now Why, if there had been a spark of enterprise in Brisbane, and that they believed that this railway would pay handsomely, they would have constructed the line long ago by a joint stock company, and not cry to the Government like a great blubbering schoolboy-" Make us a railway '" (Loud cheers ) Mr. P Raei. came forward and opposed the putting of the amendment, as he did not think that it was an amendment at all (Confusion, and cries of "Sit down") He said that the first portion of the resolution asked them to ie consider the question of railways, and after they had decided that, they could legitimately the question as to where the railway was to be made to (hear, hear), and he therefore said that this was not an amendment, and it only showed them that these men were afraid to face the ques non honestly (Confusion ensued, which lasted for several minutes, in which Mr Rae) tried to proceed, and was prevented from doing no by the incessant shouting Mr tHORN, amidst great applause, asked the coal man to first put the amendment, and then let Mr Rae) speak The CnAiittiA-t decided that Mr. Back was in order in speaking to the amendment. Mr RabIi would certainly speak before the question was put He would never move off that platform until he was heard After quiet was restored, he argued for some time that the amendment was no -amendment, and only a dodge to burke the question If they wished to propose an amendment upon the first resolution they should have proposed that it was not advisable to reconsider their decision in rife route to railway extension His principal reason for supporting this resolution was time Mr Foote had told them that the land of the Darling Downs was in the hands of the squat tors and they were told that navvies were not the men to make settlers No man who knew Amonen could say this, for they found there that all the land along the railways end of mala was taken up by the men who had constructed tin so works in the Northern States of Anne rica sheep farming would not pay, and when companies got large tracts of land for construct lug railways it was their interest to soil them and settle population along the lines Thus the great severity of the American winter had proved the salvation of that country, as it prevented the land from being taken up by the squatters (hear, hear Note what would be the effect of a general system of railway i being carried out If they had not good land laws it would be the same as before, for certainly if the nut tics could not get land to settle upon they would have to don out, but then it was the duty of the Government of the day to see that facilities were given for settling upon the lim 1 Mr Foote had said that they must first look after number one, and not mind the country He said they must look after the interests of the country first, because the interest was identical with the interests of the country, and if the country advanced they must advance with it (Cheers) Consequently, if the) only looked from a si Hull point of view they would find themselves on their beam ends j He believed that it would not be very difficult to got the i min way to the Buy, because they had been sold by their members, Messrs 1 horn and Co on this question If they had gone in for an extension of railways, the people of the country would have mined with them in profit once t > leaving the Brisbane members, because it would have been more to their interest that the units) should go to the Buy than to Uns brute, and if this railway eventually) went to Brisbane they would have no one to blame but their own members (Hear, hear ) The hands of the colony along the line of railway had been allotted to put into the hand of the squatters, and settlement had been (hereby prevented, to the injury of the colony Besides that, they were tin inna things which caused a depression, and that depression had been attributed to railways, and their mis eonsoqiiuiith a large population mound Ipswich who had a p p m ice against railways, and they believed that it would be in good thing to pull up the railway altogether, mild y thought it had done no good to the u mirth) It has no use in opening up the hinds by railways, if they took another means of shutting them up There was no use in building a palace, it they shut the doors of it. One advantage of this railway would be that it would unite the town members, and that would be or more so than the molloy the railway would cost, if it were thrown I do tim tea He believed that this would be of more consequence than any thing I care and that was the reason he supported it (Hear, hear ). If the town members were united they be and soon linton, land tax, which I would hinder the squatters from taking up the it hole of the country along the line, and then they might human farming population on the Downs (Hear, home ) The members of thiptoDint Government could not n at aw about the railway, they would as soon mill out to the Gull is anywhere else, thou only object was to keep turn party in power, because so long as they did this they had the whole country in their hands, that was far more pi ifit able ut on than their official salaries, which that did not so much care about the only inquiry of stopping this was to pass this Railway Hill, then the bone discontent tion would be well led, and the people would pay attention to other matters of far more harmoniums Mr Walsh had said that the making of this railway would take the fin more away from the farms He thought it would be vary pi usant for some of those far more to be able to got six or twelve mouths' i apple) ment, so that they could account late a little capital to work this falling with property (Hear, In in ) Of course no one would suppose for a moment that a man would deport Irish farm pciniotiintly to find work on the railway line would then have the Brisbane and Ipswich members united to support a good land Jury to settle the people on the land, and consequently these navvies would not be come pulled to run away from the colony when the railway was completed He hundred that it was population (but Hindu of country, but still he did not believe that it paid to be dug people but of to walk about with their hands in I bur pockets (Hear, hear ) The greater portion of the immigrants came out here with very little but their health and strength, and it was necessary) to induce some public works to enable these men to make a little money to Bottle upon the land, australia some business If the railway was made lind population induced to come here, it would be a benefit to all ohiBBOS Pur if it increased the population of West Mond on, it. would benefit the people in the town. It would give work to ullolussis and lines For these reasons he considered that the amendment was not an amendment at all, and, if it were it should be moved upon the second resolution By adopt mp it they would be stultifying themselves, as it had nothing to do with the motion It would be a contradiction in the rail He would propose, as an amendment that this iiinoudmo_.t was an insult to the meeting After some further confusion, the Chairman called for a show of hands for Mr Pott grew's amendment, and declared it carried by a huge majority Mr P O'Sullivan then called for a division, but the Chairman refused, on the ground that it was impiiicduihlo Fully a third of the people in the room did not vote at all Mr W Henduhn proposed the second reno lution as follows - That this Meeting rooms It ultiMo to urge him on the members for Ipswich and the West Moreton tire of sullenly of using all their energy by every legitimate means in causing the t permanent leviathans of the South corn and Western Jlnllwigr to his cat ric 1 to deep water on the shores of Moreton Bay (-hours) He agreed to a great extent with those who said that the present has not the time for railway extension, and that this question was entirely one of finance (Hear, hear On the other hand a large minority in Queensland said that now was the time for those works to be undertaken, as the circumstances of the colony might never be in a better position for so doing When they considered the of only balanced strength of the Itto parties in the Assembly, and the determination come to by the Legislative Council upon the railway debate, backed up so enthusiastically by large public meetings held at AVarttirk, Dalby, To woomba, Rockhampton Mid Brisbane, they must be very short' shared indeed if they continued to think that then six members could much longer stem the tide of public opinion (Hear, hear, and he no ) It was folly to disguise the fact that sooner or later the railway policy would be carried, and it would be madness for them, as a commit only, not to look at their necessitous position at once, and endeavor to avoid 1 the greater of the two owls involved in the extension of railways (Hear, hear When the Additional Members Bill, which was on the business paper for the present session, became law, there would be eight fresh seats occupied in the Assembly, and the new blood thus in fused into the House would place the fifteen members of the minority in a different position, and they would then undoubtedly carry the railway question It would then be too late for Ipswich to profit by the political Bituudnu, for once the terminus was established at Brisbane, as was at present proposed, they might bid good bye to the chance of the line ever being extended to deep water, and no sooner would the terminus be settled at Brisbane than the workshops would be removed there j piecemeal. Whereas, if the terminus trow erected on the shores of Moreton Bay, there would be no inclination to remove the wor. They could not find fault with their members for the vote they recorded in the Rail way debate. They were pledged to vote against Railway extension, and they could not consistently do otherwise on that occasion; but matters had taken a turn which was not anticipated at election time, and their members should now be left free to vote whatever way they might, consider most conducive to the interests of the country. It was a very remarkable fact that while it was admitted freely on all sides of the House that the Northern districts were entitled to have the railway extended to Expedition Range, not one of the members advocated the extension of the Southern and Western line to the shores of Moreton Bay, where there was depth of water for the largest vessels, and where the natural position of the terminus was. (Hear, hear.) It was argued that it was unnecessary to make railways alongside navigable river:,. He would not discuss this matter. He would merely inquire thus the river navigable from Ipswich to the Buy to the extent required by the Southern and Western districts of the colony. The clear- ing away of the obstructions in the river be tween Brisbane and the Buy had hitherto cost more money annually than would in ten years be sufficient to construct the railway from Ipswich to the Bay. From an official return laid on the table of the House the other day, he found that the enormous sum of ,(.180,000 had been paid from the revenue since Separation to obtain an additional depth of five foot of water on the bar, the original depth then being only ten foot. They must bear in mind that the whole of this money had been sunk at the mouth of the river ; and to make it navigable up to lii'inbiino for large sea-going vessels drawing twenty-one foot of water it would be necessary to deepen the river all the way up to the . wharves to a depth of at least twenty-five feet, which, if carried out at the main reasons the five feet at the Bar, would cost the country .2510,000, and the dredge would require to be kept constantly at work afterwards, at an annual cost of at least £10,000. Then, provided all' this money were sunk in the river, Brisbane would become a seaport equal to Melbourne. He fancied that the people of Brisbane saw through this railway extension policy very obscurely. It seemed to him that instead of advocating a railway from that town to Brisbane they would drive for greater benefit by advocating the formation of a railway to the II in, which would cost much less limit the claim of the river, and make the metropolis a seaport worthy of the name, while Ipswich would be completely resolved, not having the connecting link. (Hear, hear.) The amount paid to Captain Prime is in one item for clearing the channel and some other work was, he thought, £20,000. If this sum were multiplied by ten it would do what he had avail, if even one really expended corn met the rniltvnytotlioBny. (Cheers.) Notwithstand- ing all this money that had been sunk in the river, the obstructions to itsnutigution were as great us over, and that river would continue to be a sinking fund for a large portion of the revenue annually if the country would permit it. (Cheers,) A few days ago it was publicly notified that on account of the silting-up of the sand and mud to a height of sixteen incline in the channel the pilots would not conduce. up the river Tiny viiBocln drawing more than a certain depth of water. Yet this patchwork policy of wasting money on the river would be continued all infinitum, if the people of Bris bono worn allowed to continue it. (Hear hear.) On the other hand, a large amount of money would be annually saved to the revenue if the railway terminus were erected at Victoria Bay, which was situated seven miles south of Cleveland Point, possessing safe anchorage for the largest ships in any weather, with a depth of water right up to the bank of from twenty-five to forty foot, surrounded by good agricultural land, and where the Government had alienated no land as yet. This spot would form a beautiful site for a township, besides the course of the railway line to this piece would pass through unsold mineral lands for a distance of twenty miles, where no engineering difficulties would be met with. (Cheers.) It occurred to him that now was the time for their members to try to compromise their differences with the Brisbane numbers. They wanted twenty-five miles of railway, not their members give them that and twenty miles additional, whereby the whole colony would be benefited, and it could not be said after wards that the local nggruudio.inont of Brisbane was the object of the railway legislation. With the terminus at the Bay, large vessels could, get very little cost, deliver and receive cargo from the trucks on the wharf, and both in porters and exporters would save the money that was now paid for lighterage, pilotage, ngenoioH, and the host of other small charges consequent upon the river carriage. Tile estate fishiness, of a town at the Buy would result from this course being carried out, and also the settlement of a mining and agricultural population along the line. (Cheers.) . creator in- ducements would thus be offered to capitalists and emigrants arriving in the colony to proceed at once up-country to select land or some money business, instead of hanging about the motropolisiuntil their money was all gone, and they became disgusted with the colony. With the I terminus at the Buy they might hope for a return of prosperity to Ipswich and the other inland towns, but with the tomlin us at Brisbane they might cease to hope for a revival of trade and commerce in this place, which had for some years past been in a languishing condition. (Hear, hear.) He urged the electors of Ipswich and West Moreton to look this difficulty in the face, and of the two evils choose the least, seeing that railway extensions were inevitable, and that the railway policy would be enacted sooner or later. (Cheers.) Mr. W. Whmby seconded the motion, but contended that the time was not come for the construction of this railway, and that the people should depend upon their own exertions for proBponty,ondnoton the expenditure of Gol ru- ment money. Mr. L. Si'AimoW (bought that the passing of the amendment made this resolution uiiUBces gary. He argued at some length upon the use lessness of constructing a railway at present. The resolution was then put and declared carried. Mr J. Hoxton considered that the present Government was one of the most creditable that existed in the Australian colonies, and he thought that it would be a very bad thing to change them, although he did not anticipate' anything of the kind. He contended at some length that the railway should be brought down to Victoria Point, and the terminus fixed there, so that there would be no necessity for changing it, he urged that the opposition to this did not proceed from the people of Ipswich, who were really in favor of it, but from a few private individuals who were interested parties, and had held a meeting in Bell-street the previous night to get up an opposition to it. He said that instead of increasing taxation the construction of the railway would have a contrary effect, that it would revive trade and commerce, and give employment to all classes in the community. He also pointed out that a tax of 1d. per acre upon all the alienated land would pay the interest upon the construction of all the Hues proposed. He also asserted that the railway would pay its own expenses, and that the money would be nil spent among the people in the colony, instead of being sent away by foreign companies, as was the case at present. He concluded by moving that the two foregoing resolutions be conveyed to the members for West | Moreton and Ipswich with as little delay as possible. Mr. Curtin denied that he had held a meeting in Bell-street the preceding evening: to 1 UP in opposition, and he scorned the idea of Having well therefore submit with a good grace. Mr TnonrsoK, who was received with great "cheering, said that he had not tended to take "nu$£p.rt-i the meeting, but he had been requested to speak, and as it appeared to him that, if he did not take an opportunity now, it would then be said that the Government he represented were afraid to give expression to their views upon this question at public meet- ings, inasmuch as the leaders of the Opposition gave their views upon it at the meetings in Brisbane, and they had not brought forward theirs (Mr OSB-lirAJ. "They were asked to do so ' ) He thought they had done very well to stay at ay, considering the treatment which Mr Pettigrew had met with when he tried to address a Brisbane audience upon the question (Hear, hear ) He only wanted to take this opportunity of denying the false State ments which he had heard made in the room with reference to the Government of which he was a member One of these was that they did not intend to proceed with the Elections Bill, and that they had purposely put it at the bottom of the paper with the view of shelving it He denied this In the first place it was well known that this Government did not meddle with the business paper as had been done by other Governments and it was also well known that they would have no object in doing so as they could take the business when they pleased (Cheers) He had it on the authority of his colleagues to say that they intended to carry this bill, and in deference to a large number of their supporters they intended to leave out this writing test (Cheers ) They had heard a good deal to light about the squad rs and the leader of the Liberal party all of a sudden seemed to revive that ghost of squatting ascendancy, and it seemed to frighten him on every subject He sought to raise this era"" distinction which had been allowed to slumber, and his object was to bring discredit on the present Government and by damaging them By to carry this railway (Cheers ) It was quite fair to use this style of argument in politics and it had always been the case If they could not attack the thing itself, attack the person If they thought he was doing good but that they did not agree with him, says that he was little, and if that was not sufficient they must call him a village attorney (Cheers) It was perfectly justifiable, and after all it had a certain effect (( beers ) He 'now wished to recall to them what they had done this evening They had passed resolutions asserting that they would carry the railway to the Bay when the finances of the colony permitted of it and consequently they had passed a resolution that the members for Ipswich and West Moreton would use their best endeavors to carry out this project This was all very right and proper, and amounted to a vote of confidence in the Government, and he hoped that they would pass this one as they would be quite prepared to carry) the railway as soon as the finances would permit There were numerous proverbs in every language that expressed in few words some very sound maxims, and they had one of their own which said they should look well before they leaped This was exactly what the Government were doing now They did not buy steamers for which they had nothing to do They did not profess to want railways alongside navigable rivers to carry nothing They did not propose to borrow a million of money, in addition to three millions of money on which they had already to pay more than £100 000 as interest which would make all their roads and bridges They did not propose to go in for a submarine telegraph line to New Zealand, to learn the news of the Maori war They did not propose to run a mail line for themselves for the sake of having it to say that they were independent of the other colonies. (Cheers.) They must look at these matters in a common sense manner If they were small now, they should look to the day of great things, but they should not forget the small things in the meantime (Mr O'SttLiiiTA... "The humdrum policy") He would ask them whether they would rather have the power of Germany or France ? Whether they would rather have the quiet confident determination of the German-or the Galbo dash and spirit, coming to nothing when it come They were asked to go into works that were premature to interfere with the law of 1 Supply and demand-and to please the people of Brisbane they were asked to have a railway He had a higher opinion of this country than to think that its property was dependent upon the borrowing of a million of money to be spent upon the people (Cheers ). If they could not live by their own exertions, they could not certainly live upon the money that would be expended upon public works (Hear, hear.) The leaders of the Opposition admitted that this railway would not pay, and yet they were asked to go into it. He thought that the experience of the past should have taught them wisdom In their young days they had spent lavishly, and now they were clamoring for more He admitted that it would be a mere thing to have this money spent Money was money after all, and he had no doubt that he would profit by it as much as any member of the community , but that was no reason why he should allow his private interests to interfere with his prudential motives for the good of the country (Cheers.) It had been said that this debt would be paid by posterity, but however that might be it was certain they would have to pay the interest themselves and how could they bear more taxation (A Voice Let them give the land for nothing ) Their main stay was the land They had given away enough already He was not aware that he was responsible, or the present Ministry responsible for the land leaving the public in the way it had done (Hear, hear) the present Government were the best that the colony over had for settling the people on the land (Hear, hear.) It was the great Liberal party that had allowed the land to be dummies (Cheers) There had been nothing said of himself but what was rather complimentary than otherwise, and he would not enter into any personal defence. The time for going into personal matters woe when a man came forward for election, and he held that the private character of a man should have something to do with his choice by the people He would like to say some thing about the threat of stopping the Government business It was something like a lot of children at play, and one party of them fell out and would not play any more, because they could not got it all their own way (Laughter) This was just the same as one of the Opposition rising up and walking out of the House, and the others all following him-not even waiting to try to get one or two of the members on the ballot " He who fought and ran away, would live to fight another day ," but he who fought and died that day, would never fight another day He thought that this question might now be left to them, inasmuch as they had passed the resolution that the railway would be constructed as soon as the finances permitted of it (Cheers ) Mr. Groom in answer to repeated calls, come forward and addressed the meeting at considerable length He said that it was a matter of indifference to his car stituents whom this railway was made to either to the Bay of Brisbane so long in they had connection with the latter town He contended that if the Ipswich members were going to become liberal it was the first time they had been so for a long time past, as they were the men who gave the most trouble in the passing of a liberal land law He said that the present Minster for Lands was worthy of great credit for his persistent efforts to grapple with the dummies, and he concluded by strongly supporting and advocating the adoption of a general system of railway construction vi The resolution was then put and passed F A vote of thanks to the chairman was carried by acclamation, and the meeting broke up at I near 12 o'clock. A general meeting of the Railway Committee (says the D) D Gazette) raB held at the Commercial Hotel on Wednesday evening last for the purpose of nominating a deputation to attend the Ipswich meeting JChore was a good attendance of members, and his Worship the Mayor presided A letter was read from the Mayor of Brisbane, stating that he would be happy to meet the Toowoomba delegates, and to render every assistance in promoting the cause of railway extension Telegrams also were road from the Mayors of Allora, Warwick, and Dalby, expressing a desire to co-operate in the movement and an intimation was given that the people of Ipswich were favorably disposed to an extension of the line to Victoria Point, seven miles south of Cleveland The following gen- tlemen were then appointed a deputation to attend the meeting -W H Groom, Esq, M L A , his Worship the Mayor, Messrs. T F Merry, L W Pechey, and O W Pitts. '
