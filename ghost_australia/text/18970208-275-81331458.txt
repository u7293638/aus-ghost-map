LOOKING FOR GHOSTS. IN THE GUTTER A SPOOK SEANCE. Samuel Willis was yesterday found lying flat in the gutter by a police constable, and when asked what was the matter, replied to the effect that he was looking for ghosts. From this is must not be inferred that Samuel is a pro., who was out to see if the ghost walked. To-day, Willis put in an appearance at tho police court, when he said he must have been on the verge of the horrors. Mr. Cowan thought a few days remand would have a salutary effect on Willis, who was accordingly remanded for three days. As Mr. and Mrs. Johnston and a friend, of Subiaco, were driving into Perth on Saturday morning, the horse became frightened at some camels, and bolted. The vehicle was capsized, and the occupants were thrown out. All three escaped with slight injuries. The inquest on the body of George Robinson, who was found dead in an unoccupied house at Geralton on Thursday, resulted in a verdict of suicide.
