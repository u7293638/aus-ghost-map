VILIKINS AND DINAH. To the Editor of the Victorian Express. My Dear Mr. Editor, â€” I have been so delighted to read in the Express that we are to have a Dramatic Company in this town. How nice! And only fancy! Vili- kins and his Dinah to be played on Wed- nesday night. I never shall forget the day, or rather night, when I first 6a\v that beautiful drama ; my feelings went out to lovely Dinah as the music played, the curtain rose, and silence fell upon the au dience, as they listened with bated breath to the accents that fell from the . sleeping beauty (not Silvester's) ; and oh; dear 1 I felt all of a glow when handsome young Vilikins came forward, poor fellow, and declared his love for Dinah, yes, thinks I, true hearts shall be united and happy, when, to/ my horror, that old beast of a Grumbleton Gruffin steps in between them, and actually forbade the union, because he had selected some big wig of a Baron for his beautiful daughter ; but did'nt the Ghosts give it liim 1 1 don't like spirits myself, unless it's a drop of something short, but I was glad when old Gruffin was just about frightened to death. And the poor Baron had a rough time of with Dinah's sulks, Vilikin's jealousy, and old Gruffia's eager ness to get bim into .liis family, money and all. How I do long for Wednesday night. Please look out "for fifteen seats back, with a white rose in my hair, and do- please get me an introduction to the celebrated strangers who have arrived. ' I do so adore actors and actresses, do try now, dear Mr. Editor, and believe me Yours, ffushinsrlv. JEMIMA JINKS.
