PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY. An Australian Guthrie, who knew the frifldftn vices and tragedies whioh lie fester ing and bleeding beneath the respectable sur- faoe of Melbourne life, might write an almost sadder version of "The City— Its flinw and Sorrows'' than that which the great Scotch preacher wrote on the gloomy wynds and oonrts of Edinburgh. Every effort to grapple with Melbourne vice and to Christianise the lapsed masses amongst ns has a claim for sympathetic recognition ; and we gladly notice the energetic City Mission whioh the Methodist Churoh is just now launching. This new mission is plBwaf! on lines whioh are both bold nud wise. Its " workers" Include no less than six classes of agents :— 1. Ministers ; 2. home missionaries (of whom Mr. Matthew Burnett has hitherto been one ;) 3. Looal preachers ; 4, Deaconesses, or Bible women ; , Working bands ; 6. District visitors. It bius ten halls or rooms in which services are held. Open-air services are to be regnlarly conducted every- Sunday afternoon In snoh plaoes as the Queen's Wharf, the Royal Park, etc., and its list of enterprises includes also mothers' meetings, children's servioes, working men's meetings, special missions to cabmen, factories, hospitals, gaols, etc. The " plan " which links all these worken undertakings into a compact whole, and firaa the place and time of meeting, etc., is a most business-like document. The ma chinery of this new City Mission seems, Indeed, perfect. Nothing is needed but the Inspiring presenoe, the efficient gram of God, the Holy Ghost, to make it a great nower in the Citv. We most heartily wish It God-speed. — SoulJtern Cross,
