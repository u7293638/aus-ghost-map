MR. PARKER ON "HAMLET." -I TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-I was sent, from other engagements, I could not attend and listen to Mr Parker's able, eloquent, and most interesting dissertation on Hamlet, but I carefully read it in Saturday's Herald, and, while admiring if very much, I found at least one main and vital point on which 1 entirely dissented from Mr Parker's views As this subject is of great interest to almost all your readers I propose, with your kind person sion, to point out wherein I differ from Mr Parker. The position I take up in reference to this great play is, that the mind of Hamlet, from the position he was in and tbeternbla circumstances of his surroundings was completely over thrown and that he was mad to all intents and purposes Mr Parker rather favours the idea that he was feign ing madness b) asserting "that it was only when others were present that he used cipher in Jus language " But this notion seems to me entirely unten- able, seeing that Hamlet did or said nothing in his pretended madness that be mightnothavosaiaordouem his perfectly sane senses Mr Parker says -' There was a Hantlet pre yet the spirit of his father appeared, weighted with woe through a weird bereavement saddened and disturbed by all too true suspicion! Those suspicions Mr Parker must mp in had reference to his father's murder Now, I submit that this is entirely erroneous Previous to the revelation of the Ghost, Hamlet had not the slightest thought of such a thing, and this is proved and seen in the astounding effect produced on Hamlet when the Ghost announces the terrible fact Haiiiht instantly, with intense surprise, ejaculates, "Murder?" showing that he had no thought of ena a thing at the time Mr Parker dissents entirely from the thought of Hamlet being at any time was He saw s " From the standpoint of art alone a mad Hamlet would be curiously force less and ineffective " I submit, and I think I will amply prove what I say, that any man who believes He let to have been perfectly sane must believe him to have been a coarse, vulgar ruffian, as well as a demon of superhuman malaria) Not for the proofs of this Hamlet lived Ophelia "Forty thousand brothers, with all theirquantiti of love, could not make up my sum," so says Hamlet, speaking of his love for Ophelia Could any man, loving woman at this rate, in his sane senses, treat her as Hamlet treated Ophelia i Hamlet i conduct to Ophelia vi is cruel and brutal in the extreme, more worthy of a drunken coal-hole or thanet a panel or a man He first insults her dear old father, says she loved as much, to her face, then ships the most un- truly cruel abuse upon her She pardons him, on the ground of insanity), as we all do but to suppose, with Mr. Parker, that Hamlet was perfectly sane in all this is to make a supposition fatal to our respect forth man and raising in our minds a feeling of abhorrence and detestation of him To suppose Hamlet sane in this conduct to the innocent, unoffending Ophelia is to ' outrage nature, and is most untrue to art Mr Parker's manner of accounting for it is even a greater outrage against nature and art He says "Hil revolt at the Queen's unnaturalised was the secret of his conduct towards Ophelia" This is to make Hamlet even more mad than I ha) e allotted. To vent his spite and malignity in no measured end unseemly abuse of an innocent blameless girl, whom he fondly- loved because his niotherhadcom mitted a grave of crime, is absolutely ridiculous in its unreasoning absurdity The pure good, generous, highly gifted Hamlet was not himself when he thus assailed the pure and gentle Ophelia It would be sterile to suppose him otherwise, and I cannot imagine anyone holding- Mr Parker s opinions, entertaining any other feeling than detestation and contempt for Hamlets character. It was not so much firmness of purpose of vacillating indecision, or hesitation that prevented Himmler from executing his purpose of vengeance again this uncle It would seem rather, to have been a refinement of savage cruelty, demoniacal in its character, which promoted him to wait for and select an opportunity which would overwhelm it one common ruin both body and soul of the King in my mind another proof of Hamlet's disordered intellect When Hamlet surprises the King in the act of prayer, he instantly draws his sword to execute his purpose, but shows his h and, on the thought passing through his mind that the King was too piedish enraged, then to slay him No' He would take him while gambling, swearing, or in the performance of such an artist has no relish of salvation matthew trip him that his heels may kick at heaven, and that his soul march as - and black as hell wherein it goes " This is too horn too to think of, and can be only thought was the result of poor Hamlet's madness to believe Hamlet in his sound senses when he said this is to believe him to be the person I have spoken of How different is poor Othello under somewhat similar circumstances. He directs Desdemona to ask Heaven! forgiveness before he murders her saying "I would not kill the soul " Hamlet's religion amounted to more fatalism-" There's a special pro sale in the fall of a sparrow " " If it be now it will not be became If it be to come it will not be now If it be not now, yet it will come the readiness is all Since no man has aught of what he is leaves, what ls'ttolpavobetimci I quote from memory, and may not be exact ."'"Â»J last philosophy appears-, to me strange if I understand it aright It would seem to be-since we can t ss away anything with us, it is a matter of moonshine whonwedie I would rather think that under such circumstances, it. was a matter of import to Ino as 'one- as we can Hamlet thought ranretmlT when he said-" there's a du out) that shapes- our ends much hew them how we may " I agree: cordially with Mr Parker in his hitch zoology S T great play but, holding his belief, I would necessity think hamlet the most hateful and detestable character in literature Holding my own belief, I am over whelmed with sy apathy and admiration in the though that is pure good, high smiled man was immersed entangled in such a columns son of appalling ara distracting incidents, that in the contemplation it is helplessness and bitter agony, his mind lost its Dam and left him to the mercy of the waves, a previous me bad and unscrupulous people that surrounded him Agate.
