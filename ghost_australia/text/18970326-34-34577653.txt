THE TURF. RACING NOTES. [By MENTOR.] THE ONKAPARINGA JUMPING DOUBLE. In order to give my readers a fair idea of what the horses are who are left in the two jumping races at Onkaparinga I have com- <*> piled a brief resume of their principal or more recent performances without attempting to make the record complete or exhaustive. The turf student who can get access to the turf guides and racing calendars will be able to follow for himself closer along the lines than what I am giving this morning for the benefit of the general public, but it is certain there are some horses in the list about whom the general reader will bo glad to get a line of information, if it be only bi? breeding and ownership.
