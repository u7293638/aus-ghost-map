[?] TI\e Weapons'' 'of Mystery. CHAPTER XIX. THE SECOND' CHRISTMAS EVE. I I will not write of what happened ; then. It is not for the eyes of the ' world to see. Tears come into my eyes I now as I remember bow her newfound j happiness lit up bar eyes with joy; arid ? how tho colour came into; her beautiful ? cheeks. God alone knows how -happy / wo were. We had, been kept asunder by : a cruel hand, and had been brought' to-; gether again byflong and bitter struggles,: }l.; j. OblU^gtVD TMilUU WUULU UOVOl^UUYO UCDU [j but for the lova of God and the love in f) | onr hearts. Then, when our joy was !;{? j! fullest, a choir from a neighbouring ji'j' ^ church began to sing — if | v ' ' Christians, awake, salutethe happy ;morn, ' h i J.-- Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born.' \- ! It was indeed a happy Christmas, ijj morn to us.' The darkness had rolled Jij. i' away, and the light of heaven shone ?i: ; . upon us. ? ; 1 - ^ i When I left shortly after, I asked ii! whether I should come the next day, or rather when daylight came, and Bpend ^ I Christmas Day with her. i;ij j; 'You must not be later than nine sj; 1 o'clock,' Bhe said, with a glad laugh, while my heart seemed ready to break i for joy. i I have nearly told my 3tory now ; the I loving work— of months is almost at an . ? end, and flQoq' I must drop my pen. I If] am very happy, happier than I ever |j ! hopied to be. My new-found strength i j ' not only enabled me to accomplish my , 1 purpose, but gave tae'ifuller and richer !j i life. Gertrude , arid I live under i j brighter s&iea; than we should do had I not been led through so terrible an ex !!' i perience. Thus the Eternal Goodness j: ; brings good out of evil. . I- , Voltaire is on the Continent. I do p ,/[ . . not think that he-has over returned to !;]- | England ; while:- his mother, who still ; ? lives the same kind of life as of yore, i'j ; supplies him with money. It appears ij , that she has means which were unknown 'i;| to her friends, and thus keeps him sup '!?] plied. Of course the relationship between |j.! , them explains their being in league in jlj'i Yorkshire. She was ever seeking to ?ji j serve him then; she is still trying to I'l ' do the same. She never speaks to me. H; , But for me, she sayB, her son would , have married Gertrude, and then she j. i! ;? would have lived with her Herod, who [jjjj j would have been a country gentleman, |j ? nor the poor outeast he is now. i ; i ii] Kafifar has gone back to Egypt. He jij'; stayed in London a few days after the' 'i,f scene on Christmas Eve, and I gave ijjji' ?' him honse-room in, my ... old lodgings ; but he tired of England, SO' 1 sent him i'Vv back to Cairo. ' I think he is a far better man than he was, but I am not at Jjjj all sorry that he dislikes England. He ?ijjj writes sometimes, but I never: receive j&S.; ; his lettejs without thinking of the i||j j terrible night on the Yorkshire moors— j||'i- of the dark waters, the red ;hand, and 1 1| j. : the terrible struggle. Although I am )|l! - -now '.entirely free from any such in ] )if I fluences, I cannot help fearfully wonder |j| ? ing at the awful power one being can jvj exert over another. How an evil man |'J j could almost deplete me of my own self, !| | ' and make me see according to -liis will '!?! . and act according to hiEi disirs, is tb ine' vj 1 beyond explanation. Truly does our i ' | ! greatest poet a ay — ,'j ''WearesuohlstufE . . , i-tf' Asdreama are made of, and our little life iill - Ib rounded with a sleep,' . . - .... jjjjj 1:. . Tom Temple is married, nnd- lives || j happily at Temple Hall. Tom attrib !j:|: ;' utes all his happiness to the ghost. He jjij'f | should never have bad the luck to ask Edith Gray to be his wife, he says, had iiil .S? not his lady-loye been bo fearful, ill;] ; ' But you found no difficulty in gett jijb ing her consent, Tom ?' I said one day i U at Temple house, jijij 'Difficulty!' laughed Tom. 'She iljii said' Yes' before I bah stuttered out of jj'il my little speeoh.' jij'i ; ' I couldn't bear to see you in such {I r an nf noin ' his happy little wife. i' ij ji': Ah, well, Tom desorves his happiness, j|;; because he makes , those around him !||;iV'-i, happy. jiji; r Simon Slowden lives with Gertrude j 'l; ? and me. He declared that he couldn't bear f||'i -: the idea of leaving us, after he'd gone j,;! i through so much to bring us together, ijl; j ! We are not sorry for this, ior he has /j j ! boon an incalculable help to me in many jjiil li ways. But for him, perhaps, I should jlj ij:' never have the treasure I now possess, .;!i!i;jt$y.' the truest and noblest wife God ever gave to man ; but for bim, I might havo dragged out my woary life, disappointed i| li' and almost broken-hearted. Of course this might not be so ; but I know that i / j' . Simon was one of my greatest helpers in I;-) j making me the happiest man on earth, 'j: j I will closo my .{story with a seoret. i :il{ j Yesterday, Simon camo to me, looking it very grave. , ' If I remembor aright, yer honour,' :;i ; 'I told you as 'ow I'd [completely \- finished wi' all belongin' to tbe female ?: lljB] .persuasion.' , ;||;i ' 'Sou did, Simon.' jijij 'Well, I've changed my mind. I ;; S i used to think after that waccinatin* bufli jii-i j ness gived mo small pox, that I was jiji done for; but that 'ore Emily the ?ij j l 'ousemaid 'ev bin waocinated, and she 'ev j ! j bin waccinated, and she she 'ev had small Ijjif i pox too. Well, it seems to me as 'ow it jij;, must he v bin special Providence as hev j j|i! brought us together, as we read the Book jiji' of Job ; and not likin' to go 'gin Pro ;!;j I vidence, I axed her to change her name j ji ' to Slowden.' ii; ' Well, Simon, what was her reply?'. ; i i ' She seed the force o' my reasonin' in a minute, and so, as you may say, ji\ 'there'll be good brought out o' evil,' j'; | oven tho evil o' waccinatin' ; for it's give ' us both small pox, and we both live. Oar faces be a bit pitty, but kisses ain't none the less sweet for that.' ' ; ' And when is it to come off, Simon?' i ' I'm goin' to the registrar's now, yer honor, so thrco weeks to-morrow I shall bo took in and done for, and all threw wdcoination.' The End.
