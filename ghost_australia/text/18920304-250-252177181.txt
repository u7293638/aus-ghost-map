The attempt to make John Wc-L v p .]• as an upholder of dippiuir.' 5 to ill : e\\-lesion of •'sprinkling," is v« ry nnfor 11:1 ti.

Mr B.'s claim, j-,,. iii.,t Culviii Luther, and \Ye a!.y, >.rere amecd m ihc belief that immersion was neees-ary to tlie right performance of bapti-i!\ is searec]- borne out by faeis. The teaching of Comnnn Prayer as to th-"! mode of 'naptisni— th L- "materia proxima," us il is called, i-; e::j>lje';r Besides the disputed meaning which * contend for as to the materia proxima," which in the sacrament of liaptism is Ablution, in one way or other t> performed, there are notably three, others, viz.. (!) Literal meaning, where it is said of tliL Jews that when they come from the irark.-tplace, except they wash themselves (i,ai'„ i{ V., sprinkle themselves), they eat not ; (2) a Metaphorical mean'iig. as in Aeis i 3 "' Yc shall be baptised with (liiarg. U.\'. ''in ') Uie Holy Ghost not many days htuco ; (:}) a Legal and Ceremonial meaning, us i u Keb. ix, 10. & There are two distinctive points to be considered in regaid to baptism ; the subjects of the rite, and its adiiiinLtei ing. As to the former, they, according to our frk-id- the Baptists, must b> adelts only, infants being considered ineligible for the s'crainent through incapacity for faith and repentance.' As to the latter, our friends maintain that the word " baptise " means dipping or immersion only, 111 proof of which several wellknown and favorite texts are advanced, c. . John's baptism 'in ' Jordan, and a-ain near fsalim, " bccause there was mueli water ihere or as the R.V. margin reads "were is any waters;'" that the Saviour e.une up out of the water ; that Philip and the eunuch both "went down into the water."' That all these were immersed, or that the three thousand who were added to the church on the occasion of St. Peter's fn-t sermon iu Jerusalem, " having receive 1 the word.'" were all iimneraed, regardless of the common decencies of life ; or that the several whole families or households who repented, and were baptized, contained uo children is highly improbable ; the more so in the face of St. Peter's words, " The piomibc is to you and your children." Much more mi-ht" be said, but for the present I have not any more spare time, and I am sure yon -will not be able to afford more space.—Yours trnly, \- "AQUA."
