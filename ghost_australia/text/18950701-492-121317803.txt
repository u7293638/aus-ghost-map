GOGRANGOOLA. For the past week the weather has been ex tremely cold, with occasional showers and an incessant, strong westerly wind. The rain has partly replenished tanks, etc., but it is too late in the season for it to be of any benefit for grazing purposes. It has softened the ground a little for piougmng, However, and the farmers are all busily engaged turning up the soil preparatory to sowing. Most of the agriculturists have disposed of their maize, and seized the opportunity, while prices were a little higher, of reaping some reward for their trouble. No doubt they are inwardly con gratulating themselves on their good sense now, since the market has fallen again. News is very scarce here at present. We' are enjoying (?) an almost Arcadian existence, so quiet and so lacking in excitement have the past few weeks been ; and, except fop the little stir which Parliamentary matters and the latest ' spook' cause, the monotony of our lives would be com pletely unbroken. We have our disembodied spirits here too, and many a locality is dreaded for its ' headless lady,' ' mysterious light' (which is probably a firefly), etc., by the superstitiously in clined. These and many more have undergone a revival since Singleton and Morpeth commenced the business of ' ghost resurrection,' and amusing talea in connection with them often help to pass an hour by at the fireside on these long winter evenings.
