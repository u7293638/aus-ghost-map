In íeturiiing thanks to the electors of Geelong for the majority which gave him a seat and a few months of office, Mr. Beerx declared that he was " calm." Ho had been calm all day, he waa un- ruffled at the time of speaking, and intended to remain tranquil to the end of the chapter, for, said the hon. gentle- man-"He who is fighting the battle " of intelligence against something " which I will refrain from describing, " ought to remain calm, and let his " reason have full play." This no doubt is a very pretty senti- ment, rich in practical wisdom, not altogether unrelieved by a touch of humour. The idea of Mr. Betsey being engaged in fighting the battle of intelli- gence, or any other battle oxcept that of his breeches pocket, cannot fail to pro- duce a smile upon the face of everyone acquainted with his enterprising political career. We fear, however, that the majestic immobility which the Premier claimed as his distinguishing character- istic on the occasion, was more seeming than real. The speech delivered bears in- ternal evidence that,while the hon. gentle- man was edifying his hearers by affecting an almost statuesque placidity, the Old Adam of Berryism was raging inwardly. This is apparent in many ways. In the first, we find that the preternatural calmness of which such loud boasting, in the reckismfllan vota, was made, was not sufficient to overcome a settled habit of iui_represeiitaUon Tor example, take the following statement -" We have a " class in this colony which will never " nat until tho Govommont ls chosen " from its ranks It is as the em " bodiment of the nght3 of human " labour that I receive all the persecution " I have received ' IN ow, m theo f»w words thcro is a ui'fgatio fahi and a ludicrous assumption of martyrdom that aro eminently Berryistic Wlicro is the " class" to bo found to which tho Pre mier alluded as desnous of monopolising powell That the wcalthy do not con stitute it is evident, because as a rule they abstain from taking any part in public affairs We are duven, then, to tho conclusion th it it was to the Constitutional party os a whole that Mr Bl um s remark applied But wo submit tbat m speaking of it as a " class," lie was guilty of a misuse of language Ihe Constitutional patty, both in a"d out of Parliament is composed of men b longing to every cla¡>8 m the community, so tbatwhethei its doctrines and obj° ts bo right or wiong, salutaiy or dangerous, stilish or disinterested, they arc held by all sorts und conditions of men, and must therefore be free fiom any dm tinctively sectional bias 'lhese aie facts which cannot be denied with truth, and they are sufficient in themselves to rendel Mr Blkuv s statement meaning less It may be, however, that the Premier wastoo"cnlm' in the moment of vic tory to make his meaning clear-that what he meant to sa j was, that there is a class in "\ letona which will never rest while he occupies a position which enables him to work mischief through ignoionco or malice If this is a correct interpretation of his meaning, we do not hesitate to say that m ah probability ho is correct foi once in his lifo Such a clas"- dots evist, but it is divided from the rest of the community by common views, not by social distinctions It comprises all thoso who, whethci they hold lands, houses, and goods in possession 01 not, consider that property-to mvort the well known phrase-has its lights as well as its duties, that a btnct observ ance of the law is, in every countiy an! age,the onlv safeguaul of fleedom, that Governments should considei the coun tiv as a vvholo, and not sit down in its chief places like a hostile aimy dividing ti e spoils of a conquered land, that minorities have rights which cannot bo ignored without moral guilt, that wiong does not become n¿ht simply by the declaration of a majority that commerce ls an honourable and fruitful source of national prosperity, which every Government should loster negatively, by maintaining ti e order essential to that confidence which is the prime necessity of successful trade , and that progress depends on tho co opera tion, not the antagonism, of laboui and capital By far the 1 îrger portion of the veiy largo class that holds these views ia profoundly lndiftoiont a3 to the 2K1 connel of the executive, so long as the administrative offices are filled by men of oidinaiy re putation and capacity Its members would be perfectly content that the different parties in the state should each have their opportunities of giving effect to all that is good in their respective progiamines, provided they would iccog mse the fundamental pi mci pies we have enumeiated as the bases of all iction It is only because Mi Blkrv, through out the whole of his political caieei, lins deliberately made a tiade of setting tho " haves ' and the " hav e nots ' by the ears, of exalting one giade of society I at the expense of another, of insulting and riding tough shod over minorities, of trampling upon the law in the into íests of democratic despotism, of govern ing with a sole view to party gain, of harassing commerce to win the suffrages of ignoiance, and of sowing hatred and distrust between the vvotking man and those who alone can provide him with employment, that he has opponents w ho contend that his complete exclusion fiom power is a condition precedent to any leal impiovcmont in our affaus Let him reform and live cleanly-let him show tint he has awakened to the fact that the leadei of a great and diversified community must not be "the embodiment of the rights " of human laboui " in any lestucted sense, but the servant and f nendof human enterprise and activity in all its develop ments, and we venture to think that the hon gentleman would soon find that the desire, which at piesent undoubtedly exists, to take the reins of government out of his hands, would spoedily abate Mi BEritY, with sublime audacity, Las held himself up to the public gaze as a martyr Because the cou stitutionalist-, having îegaid to his outrageous proceedings at the opening of Parliament, and his notorious in capacity to deal with the financial difh cultiea in which he has involved the countiy, thought proper to oppose his re election, he would now pose before the country as a persecuted saint " I am " guiltless," said tins immaculate poh tician on Wednesday evening, "of a " single word or act to justify the op " position brought to bear against me " It strikes us that this assertion is " cool" as well as " calm " If the hon gentle man will look back for the last ten years, and consider the loss and disgrace which the country has suffered through his greed and ambition, we are in clined to think that even so ac comphshed an adept in the art of " make believe " will see the necessity of modifying the statement A mere glance at his career is sufficient to Ehow how transparently false the averment is We need do no înoio than mention the "stonewall," the révolu tionary violence of 1877 8, the seditious language of the same period, "Black " Wednesday," the embassy with its suppressed accounts, and the mault offered to Hlr Ma test y a few weeks ago, to convince any reasonable person that, so far from being guiltless of words or actions warranting opposition, the lion gentleman has committed crimes enough against the commonwealth to almost justify an impeachment It is not ne ceseary, however, that we should pursue the subject further Mr Bekey has now a great work before him, and it is time for him to come down out of the regions of romance We trust he will continue calm and collected, but we would beg of bim to beai in mind that the country' would take much greater pleasure in his dignified repose, if Ji9 would change the tranquillity ha du played at Geelong for some descnptiou of quiescence that would permit _,M occasionally to Btray into truth I hal retrenchment and reform are desirable m connexion with the "ni service of this country no one will doiiy If we cnticiao the Mmiaterial proposals on tin. subject, it is in no spirit of hostility to the principle of reform, but because of the íneíhciency of Mr Bl 11 \ s suggestions and of thoir shira chaiacter , because they are of the order entitled mike behove There is really but one way of reforming the cmii service, and that way-abroadaud open path- the party which the Ministry ra presents bia steadily ignored, or perhaps it would be more correct to say that the politicians who represont the party con spiro to ignore it It is to ascertain the cause of tho ovd, to find out what it is that leads to the civil service benii» ovei manned, and in many cases moflí ciently officered, and then to stuke at the caii=o and so get finally ud of the extravagance and tho inoflicioncy com plained of The cause is not far to seel On the contriry, it is notorious The civil sei vice LS rushed and oflices ara multiplied because tho appointments aio in the peisonal gift of the politician» who may chance tobo in power The po^ts in tho public service aro the 3poil» of victory, and there is a natural ten dencv on the part of the victois to make the fruits of victory as largo as possible Their followers call for booty Munster» find it diihcult to íesiat the prcssuio pu> upon them, and the whole set of the system is in favour of creating ofhcea, wheieas the tendency should ba to concentrate work as much as po3 Bible Now and then some deficiency in the revenue, or some grow abuse of the system, leads to au outcry, and we seo what is happening to day A few salaries are reduced, or a handful of men arc dismissed, and then, when the pinch is over, everything goes on as before The scare is forgotten So are the victims A new Ministry finds the old vacancies remarkably convenient for rewinding its own friends, and Uta system blossoms and bears fruit as bo fore The public is tickled and grat fied bj the zeal displayed for economy at the moment, and it is oblivious to tha ciicumstance that the procesa of filling up the sen ice commences immediately afterwaids But this is the fact the indisputable fact-to attempt to reform the civil sei vice by a few temporary reductions and dismissals is to bo guilty of the folly of the old physician-» who treated the eruptions of small pox, aud went no fuither It is to attack the symptoms, and to ignoro the diBOxse The real cure is well known, and it is to divorce patronage norn politics It is a curious circumstance that Mr Blrrv. has twice taken office in time to nip this all important reform in the bud In 1877 Sir Jamls M'Cullolh pledged himself to introduce a bill to establish here the Imperial system of appointing to the public service by ment, but tha Berry Ministry came into office, and no more was heard of the proposal We had Black ^ ednesday instead Ihe first step taken by the »Service Goveiu ment was to provide for the ni troduction of the competitivo prm ciple, and Mi W II Arch.r wis appomted to prepare a scheme for adapting the British system to this colony, but again Mr BtRitv takes office, and again the Ministerial pro gramme does not contain a reference to the subject \\\ hether the patronage is little or whether it is much, Mmisteu want it Thev use it as an instrument of povvei It sunouuds them with a host of men who aie expectant of favours to come, and who are road) to do then woik with zeal in the constituencies lo statesmen who desire to serve their country in the hi^hei branches ot politics patronage is a nuisance, but to the tinding politician it is a necessity The Lnglish leaders m the House of Commons and the House of Loids havo declared that whether the competitive sjstem be peifect or not, nothing would induce them to return to the cid dajs of personal patronage, while here the handful of men who, as tha Amencans sa), "run the party -that is, the radical party-cling tenaciously to mtionage as though it were necessary to their existence In their eyes tha first use of the oublie service is to piovide for theu suppoiteis and their agents "He is oui friend, vuoto a radical member to Mr Bl Ri i when recommending a ] 1 otc ja m a correspon dence which has been publisiied "He " is an active liberal ' And the gentle man was appointed accordingly, without an inquiry whether the post was required 01 whether the man was competent oi otherwise It is difficult to conceive what Uni fide objection there can bo to appoint mont by merit And if we adopt this principle we may hope to speedily obtain all the reform w o require There would bo no object m a Minister ci eating offices, for ho would not know who would fill them There would be uo thing to interfere under such circum stances with the natural ambition of the head of a department to see his ofhee con ducted as efficiently and as economically as possible The Minister would be at liberty to serve the country, whereas now the claims of the party-and too often the claims of the scum of the party -are what press upon his consideration The numbera of the civd service could be kept down with ease And what we are bound to say we consider of equal ira portance, the prestigeof the service would be maintained, whúo at present it is suffering yearly and daily detonoiation In England the old rule was that acorn mission was purchased for the fool of the family Heie the social failure is foisted upon the civil service If tue j outh is destitute of abilities, or if ho is too idle to hold his own m competition m the woild, a set is made to obtain for him a public situation, and so with broken down politicians who cannot got their living elsewhere Whether the candidate be young or old, in nme cases out of ten he is forced on the service because he is incapable in the w orld It is inevitable, under such circum stances, that the service should bo rapidly losing tone and caste, and m this direction, as in that of economy, a thorough refoi mahon is required, the community to be sei ved not by the halt and the lame, but by the brightest and the best of ita members The evil of in competency necessarily disappears when we appomt by personal ment and not by parliamentary influence, but it does not disappear until thon Efficiency and economy go hand in hund, and thero is tho experience of Great Britain as well as the conclusions of common sense, to pi ove that the only way of securing both is to divorce patronage from politic The Berry Government has refused, and still refuses, to toko that stop The 1 adical leaders want patron >ge for their hacks and their roi itn os, their F utrti i r s and their Bi_sjviiiri Bli.uvs, and so long as political pationago exists and personal mont is scouted, so lon¿ must the evil of an expensive and inefficient «jiblie sen ice endure In one respect Mr Tons

render assistance to the persons in a vessel with which his barque had come into collision. The case for the Crown is that on the 8th April last, while on a voyage between Java and Melbourne, the barque ran into a catamaran, in which were five Malays, and the defendant, instead of stopping to render assistance, continued on his course. Two witnesses were examined, sailors on board the Trochrague, and the further hearing of the case was adjourned till this morning. The trial of the five young men-William Johnson, Thomas Tyrrell, John Hulme, John Sheehan, and James Gillies-on a charge of criminally assaulting a woman named Emily Blair, at Sandridge, on the 17th July last, was concluded in the Central Criminal Court yeaterday, before his Honour Mr. Justice Barry. The jury, after half an hour's de- liberation, found all the prisoners not guilty, and they were discharged. At the City Police Court yesterday, John William Thomson was charged with obtain- ing the sum of £1,000 from Mr H Jennings, solicitor, by means of fraudulent representa- tions. The prisoner obtained a loan of the sum named from Mr Jennings on the deeds of some land at Footscray on the 19th Feb- ruary, 1878, and as he did not pay either prin- cipal or interest the land was put up for sale, but not sold. When the land was advertised for sale, Messrs Moule and Seddon gave Mr Jennings notice that the Bank of Victoria held a mortgage over the land in question. A search was made, when it waa discovered that the land had been brought under the provisions of the Land Transfer Statute, and had been pre- vioualy mortgaged by the prisoner to the Bank of Victoria. There was no memoran- dum of registration endorsed on the original title deeds, and in making a search before lending the money Mr Jennings, clerk, as is the custom, merely searched the register for mortgages under the old statute. The defence was that the affair was a mistake, and that Mr. Jennings had virtually admitted as much in accepting a second mortgage. The Bench committed the prisoner for trial at the next sessions of the Central Criminal Court Bail was allowed in one surety of £200, and the prisoner in the same amount. The tender of Messrs.

About a dozen mem- bers were present. Mr Wolfe presided. A report was made by a member who had visited several houses in which children had been vaccinated. It was to the effect that many of these children had subsequently suffered ill health, chiefly in the form of eruptions on the body and erysi- pelas. The hon secretary Mr Macal- ister stated that Dr Sparling, of Hawthorn, had recently become an anti-vaccinator. Mr Ellery, Government astronomer, had sug- tested that a petition should be got up to Par- liament in favour of the abolition of the legal enactment making vaccination compulsory, and had promised to sign such a petition. The Minister of Mines and Mr Davies M.L.A., had also promised to assist, the movement. Other prominent colonists had promised assistance, not because they did not believe in vaccination, but because it was against the spirit of the time to make vaccination compulsory, considering that doctors differed as to its desirableness. Mr Macalister also mentioned the names of the Rev J J Halley and Mr David Blair and others as being opposed to compulsory vaccination in this country. It was resolved that the present pro tem officers should be the executive for the first 12 months. The league then considered the best means of advancing its objects, petitions to Parlia- ment, circulars on the subject, and public meetings in the suburbs being advocated. The twelfth annual meeting of the Society for the Assistance of Persons of Education was held yesterday in the Town hall, the Rev C S Perry in the chair, A letter was read from tho Mayor of Melbourne, regretting that he could not attend the meeting. The report showed that 67 persons had been assisted during the past year chiefly by loans of money. In spite of the general depression the committee had been able to obtain employment for a few of the many persons who had made ap- plication to them.
