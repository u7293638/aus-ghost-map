THE OOMMI8SION RAOKET. To TUG EDITOII.—Si a,—f would like to ask the North Mclcourne Counoil if it is u fact that the present surveyor receives commission on his own estimates or ou the uotual amount tendered for and accepted by the contractor. If the surveyor estimates for a job which he considers yorth £500 and charges, say 5 per cent.,' that untitles liitn to £25,. but if the contractor docs it for £350, what then? Of course .the difforenoe is not much, only £7 10a., but in tho course of a year on the aamo proportion ttie amount would oomo to a nice little penny. PerliapB Or Barwise wlio is ontitled to the thanks of tho ratepayers for his actions in tho Oounoil, will Furnish the information I; desire. I think Crs Petrie, King and Henderson should buBtir themselves and not lot Or Barwise do all the .necessary faultfinding anil "unearthing the ghosts of the ohambar.". Yours obediontly, ABOVBBOABP.
