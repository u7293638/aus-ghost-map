THE CREED IN JAPAN, ^The young Church in Japan, com ^-posed of converts made by the1 various Presbyterian bodies, now considers it self of age. It has decided that it will not take a creed from any other Church. It has heard the distant cry of 'Re- vision' from all. Tne last Synod was remarkable for the controlling influence of the native ministers and elders, and for the adoption of the following Con fession of Faith : — ' The Lord Jesus Christ, whom we worship as G-odj the only begotten Sou of G-od, for us men and for our salva tion was made man and suffered. He offered up a perfect sacrifice for sin ; and all who are one with Him by faith are pardoned and accounted righteous, and. faith in Him working by love puri fies the heart. ' The Holy Ghost, who, with the Father and the Son, is worshipped and glorified, reveals Jobub Christ to the soul, and without His grace, man, being dead in sins, cannot enter the kingd'om of G-od. By Him the prophets and the apostles and holy men or' old were in spired, and He, speaking in the Scrip tures of the Old and New Testaments, is the s»preme and infallible judge in all things pertaining unto faith and living. 'From these Holy Scriptures the ancient Church of Christ drew its Con fession; hence we, holding the faith once deliveaed to the saints, join in that Confession with praise and thanks giving.' Then follows the Apostles' Creed.
