CHURCH OF ENGLAND ASSEMBLY. FIRST DAY.—MONDAY, SEPT. 29. The Bishop of Melbourne (president) took the chair at 4 o'clock, at Trinity hall, Claren- don-street, East Melbourne, and opened the proceedings with prayer. THE ANNUAL ADDRESS. The PRESIDENT delivered the annual ad- dress to the members of the Assembly. The address was as follows:— My Brethren of the Clergy and of the Laity.—Most heartily do I bid you welcome to this the first session of the eleventh assembly of the Church of England in the diocese of Melbourne, believing as I do that, with the divine blessing, the triennial period on which we this day enter will be signalised by special ventures for God, and for His church—ventures put forth by warm hearts, and sustained by willing and liberal hands, resolved upon the enlargement of our Redeemer's kingdom, and upon a holy crusade against the empire of sin and Satan. PROGRESS OF THE CATHEDRAL. The pnBt -,enr has been a Benson of ex- pectation Bright visions of the future have piiHBed before ue The interior of ' our cathedral has been grawin-; in beauty and grandeur dnj by day, as tne promised gifts of those who love it hove found each its appoin- ted Dlace , and, in anticip ition of its being consecrnted on Januarv 22 the liuty of the diocese have kindh presented to its bishop«, present and to come, a pastoral stuff, bear 1114 a Uguie ot the gre it apostle to whom the cathedral is dedicated, and to whom the church owes those inspiring; words Tor getting those things which are behind, and renching forth unto those things which are before ' An article on the restoration of fat Saviour's, Southwark, in the April num hu* of the Qnarlalii Review observes that ' it is now a common place of church opinion, that the proper work of a cathedral is not merely to present a dignified ideal df worship, but also to strengthen weak places, to revive flagging energies, and generally to impart vigour and life to the diocese " Owing to tho scantiness of our resources in men und menus we may eeem at present to be iar from realising this noble ideal, but I desire thut it may never b» absent from our thoughts us the goal to be attained We shall not be able to justify the expenditure of £100 000 upon this one building it it is regarded as onlj one more church, of Bupenor si/e and dignitj, added to the cnurehei ol Melbourne Our people must be taught that the Cal lied ral is not simplj a lint structure, or even a school of sacred music, but that it is also tv diocesan institution , that, na the centre of unitj, its tendency is to break down parochial selfishness, nnd bind the parishes to.ether as un organic whole The great diocesan societies, such as the Bishop of Melbourne's Fund, the bunda) school Association, indthe Curls friendly Societj, will, I trust, hold their annual solemn services in the Cathe drnl Owing to aatisfuctor) arrangements mude for the maintenance of the ser vices, I trust that the Cathedral wil' be raised above the necessity ol seek ing the aid of seat rents, and that 1 may adopt the words of Bishop Short when anticipating the completion of his cathedral at Adelaide-" The «eats will be unnppro printed and unlet, all who will may en'er, and all Ireely worship, high and low, rich und poor, one willi nnother It is the mother church ot the whole diocese, in which every member lins a ruht and an mterest It may be practicable at some future time for the Bishop to form a greater chapter vv ltli the object of connecting the parochial clergy more closelj with the Cathedral Church, one of their duties being to preach at least once in the year in the Cathedral Church when dulj summoned At nuy rute I hope that the Cathedral pulpit vv ill verify the remark made by my predecessor at the laying ot the first stone 10jears ago-that there isa generally unsuspected use m a large building , it helps lo make good preachers The members of the assembly will not forget that the day ot consecration will be Thursday, January 21, if the Lord will, In order that the 1 east ot the Conversion of St. Paul, to whom the Cathedral is dedicated, and which will lull on the following Sunday, mav be included in the octave 'I hey will also be glad to leam that already nine bishops have promised to take patt m the services aub WOHL m ciinncii B\rEvsioN But important as the Cathedral undoubtedly is to the strengthening and consolidation ot church work in the diocese and to the per fection of our ecclesiastical machiner), we have in hnnd another enterprise still more urgent, more loft) in ltj aims, and more far reaching in its issues Ï he nature and com puss of this enterprise will hobest understood by a enreful study ot the report of the church extension committee lor Melbourne and its suburbs, which will be pluced in your hands 'J hose members who had seats in the last assembly will not have forgotten the enthu Mastic unanimity with which the resolution ni pointing this committee was carried I then \entured to cull it an ideal committee, and I seize this opportunity of bearing my grateful teBtitnoti) to the patience, thorough ness, and /eui which have characterised its labours, and to the conscientious cure with which the council has scrutinised every bill- in the report before submitting it for jour npproMil Ihc task has been au aiduousone Notwithstanding the vast increase in the population during past j ears, there has nor been a corresponding increase in church work or church attendance Accordingly the committee have found it necessury to recommend the torrantiou of seven new parishes, 14 misBicn districts, the erection ni eight mission halls, and the purchase of 10 sites for church purposes As this will necessarily involve a very heavj outlay, the committee have submitted, and the Bishop in Council has adopted certain financial recommendations not without ¿nive and an_iousthought 'Hie committee have also held many conterenccs with "the suburban clergj who, with few exceptions, have shown a readiness to co opi rate with them in their plans even though in some cases it muht seem to be to their own hindrance to do so Thtse circumstances, and others on which it is needless to dilate, have rendered it im possible for the council lo formulate a bill drawn up on the lines of the report in time tor this session But it the assembly adopts the principle of the report the way will be cleared tor the introduction of a bill at io mr distant period And let no one

This being so, since the ejes ol young people throughout the colon) are turning towards Melbourne, is it possible that their pirentH and guardians can be lndiflcrent to the question whether Melbourne is ndequatel) supplied with clergy, churches, ami puioclnal institutions, ni order that their children on coming luther ma) be brought at once under kindly pastoral and Christian iiilluence-i, or whether they he left to wunder about ouratieets us sheep hav ing no shepherd * 1 nuuiitiiii thut this church extension movement deserves and has a right to demand the S)mpathy and aid of the whole diocese, und that there!«notu squatter, not a farmer, not u selector, however r< mote Irom the metropolis, who is not summoned, as with the blast of a trumpet, to "come up to the help of the Lord to the help of the Lord ngalnst the might) ' THF BISHOP 01 »ILLIlOtlltM S 1 UND One oi the most pressing subjects fo- the Bishop to dilate upon every year on such an occasion as this is the Bishop of Mi Ibourne a J und, the backbone of our church's home mission work, the iigenc) which supplies the sinews of war, without which the church in the country cannot even ho maintained, much less extended It would be needful for me to enlarge more fully on the work of the tund were it not that the nnnunl meeting in its behalf will be held this evening in the Temperance hall, Russell street, at 8 o'clock, when the or.aniBinc secretary will present the annual report and speeches will be de livered by the Rev H F Tucker, Mr. C. A. Pearce, Archdeacon Langley, and Canon Carlisle. I trust that this meeting will be well attended by the members of the assembly. It is a particularly important meeting, because we shall not only hear of the spiritual benefit conferred upon the diocese at large by the fund, but also of the increased demands which will shortl) be made upon its resources b).the anticipated extension of the church in the metropolitan area. I will now onlv add that, though theie has been a considerable decline in the con tributions from some oi the larger ud wealthier parishes as compared with last V car there has been an mocase m the smaller parishes, and I heartily thank Clod, who bus BO moved the hearts of kind friends, that "when the accounts were closed (I quote from the report) the estimated income tor the )ear was not only reached hut exceeded by the sum of £223, the total amount of sub aenptions and calk étions being ¿0,223," of winch the nrchdeaconry of Melbourne con- tributed £5,572 TUB 8UVDAT ScnOOL ASSOCIATION Nearly akin to this work ia the great und growinguBefülnessof our Sunday school Asao eiution The tenth report of th.it udmirable institution, managed ,"11 for lo.e mid nothing for reward by Mr ED Puck'e-(hear, hear) Ima just reached me, accompanied by a paper on the association in the torm of ques tion and answer, intended to explum its aims, its needs, ita work, and ita progress 'Hie questions are so clearly pat, and the anawers to them are so cruaiungly conclusive, that the inquirer cannot fail to do what the question m tends him to do-fill up the subjoined slip But, besides the qneBtions and answers given in the paper referred to, the last BIX ringeB of the reportare occupied with hats of udmirable questions, which ha\e during the piiHt veor been put to both tciclnra and acholara nt examinations 1 he questions are mstrui(ne und ccimpre'henpup Lnough to be worth the pi rusal even of members of r. church na seinbly , they were unawe-eil in writing by the examiners, and the successful competí tora received rewards The questions require ii Rood knowledge ot the bible, tliePrnver bonk, the articles, church history, and Church uiteelusm , all are excellent In looking timm (.-..

Act No 3,1888 Known as the Regulation of Elec lions Act ïhis measure introduced the practice of preferential voting recommended by Profeaaor Nanson, and tile eleceiona of 1S80 were conducted on tint principle At luat aunt, therefore, it may si em air inre that nfter ao short a triul of the new pi i(i the As sembly ahonld be invited to abandon it and to return to the former system Hut lhere is no

the 1 ill 11s an expen ment, and, theretore, in 188), when the ex périment was tried for the lirst time, the As sembly adopted the following resolution - ' Iliac the secretary, Ins deputy, and the ocrutineera appointed for the elections of thia session 111 connection with the new system of voting, be requested to turnish to the Bishop 111 council, na soon as may be, a report on tue manner in which, in their opinion, the system has been lound to answer 'Hie secretary and his colleagues presented their report accordingly It waa unfavour ablL to the new plan, concluding with the ex pression of a decided opinion that it ia desir- able " the assembly should return, at aa early a date as possible, to the ordinary method of voting ' Hence this motion I make these remark«, not with a view 'o anticipate or to mlluence many wny the decision which the assembly may arrive at, but simply to point out that the motion is atrictlv in order, and to urge that the bill, ii loave be given to mtioduce it, should be discussed and dis posed of without prejudice, on its merita and un its merits only MAILIII\L rnoanrss 01 riiF cuuiton, Our material progresa during the year, though no1 rapid, lins been

though wooden structures, are thoroughly neat und churcblike in their shape and littinga , it ia not so with all I desire that every church, of whatever material built, should include a chancel for

sometimea employed who are not luminar with the interior of an Anjienn church For these, and other reasons, the diocesan architect has been instructed to prepare designs lor sacred edifices, which shall be at once cheap mid church like Copies of these designa can bo obtained at the registry lora small Bum, and I íecommeud all clergymen and guardians who propose to erect small churches in the country to procure them and to be guided by them 1 here ia one column in the atatiatica for luat year wlucti cvuaea me some anxiety , it ia the column entitled "estimated number ot communi- cants If the returns are to be relied upon, it appears that in three out ot the four inch deaconnes the number of communicants was leas in 1889 than in 1SS8 How lo account tor tina apparent decline I know not

Newman was the man But he deliberately abandoned his own theory, and showed by his secession how impossible it is to reconcile the teaching of the church of England with that of the Church of Rome There are some who would minimise the differences between the two churches and represent them as slight But let me quote the words of the committee of bisliops appointed at the Lam beth Conference of 1888 to consider the question of Home Reunion :-'The com mittee with deep regret felt that, under present circumstances, it was useless to con suter the question of reunion with our brethren of the Roman Church, being pain- fully aware that any proposal for reunion would be entertained by the authorities of that church only on condition of a complete submission on our part to those claims of absolute authority and the acceptance of those other errors both in doctrine and in discipline, against which in faithfulness to Gods Holy Word and to the true prin- ciples of his Church, we have been for three centuries bound to protest Before leaving this sUbject, let me refer with pleasure to a valuable pamphlet just published, by tne liishon ot J athurst.

On the other hind when we look back on the paat history ot the relations between capital and labour, we can scarcely fail to trace present trouilles, m great measure, to the worship of private property on the part ot the moneyed classes That private property is, in a sense, lawful cannon be denied , otherwise there could be no place for the eighth command nient But when men make private properly their graven image, when they fall down unto it, and worship it, and pray unto it, and say, Deliver me, for thou art my god, when they use it chiefly tor self gratification and Belt aggrandisement, show no sympathy with others-such conduct as this tills the hearts of the masses with discontent, envy, and malice. It t« altogether contrniy to the spirit and genius of CliriBtiamty Tesus Christ, its founder, had no private property and nis fishermen willingly surrendered what little they had forUia sake Hie whole current of His teaching nina counter to the doctrine that everyone haa the right to do what he likea v/ith his own We know what the im mediate effect of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on the Day of Pentecost waa upon the holders of private prooerty But let no one assert that because that particular eftect was temporary it was therefore u failure It was not a failure, it asserted in a conspicuous manner the attitude of Christianity towarda property, and the lesson has never been wholly lorgotten by the church. On what ground, then, uuy you call your land or your money your own' lhe Christian answer to this queation ia plain You may calf these tlunga your», becauae the Great Proprietor above has constituted you, and you alone, the trustee of them, the atewaid and caretaker ot them Tina is the only theory of ownership recognised in the Kingdom ot Heaven Your property ia yours, because you have a personal responsibility for the dispos U ot it, which none can share with you , it is yours, because from you, and irom none beside your Lord will hereafter demand an account of the use which you have made of it Iheie are many Christian men, thank God, owners of property, who dee thus recognise the responsibilities of wealths -men whose example and lnllnence shed a perpetual benediction upon the world around them , and if all resembled them, it would perhaps be too much to any that tuer» would have been no strikes, bul it may be said that there would have been no ground lor them CONCUSIÓN What shall be the end of these thing none can tell. But I am persuaded that the hearty prac- tical adoption of Christian principles in their beuring upon the vast social questions which now convulse tho world IH the only "remedy for present troubles. We are assembled li ere as communicant members of the church of Christ, banded together to extend Ilia kingdom and to make nis life, His death, His example, His teach- ing more widely known and understood amongst men. The aocial disorders which threaten ua with so much misery may well kindle within our hearts a holy enthusiasm for the extension oi the Christian luith. Let us endeavour throughout our debates to keep in view the grand design of all church or- ganisation, which is (in the words of a thoughtful writer) " that the whole fabric of humanity, all the relations of men to God, to one another, and to the outward world, ahall be pervaded by the spirit of Christ." \ ArroiNniEivT or orno its.
