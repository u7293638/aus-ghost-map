My Ashes. THE VICISSITUDES OF IK rXCTKEEATED JIOTHEB CJ-IAW. My ashes, locked within & handsome silver urn, were placed by my son-in-law on die mantle in tbe drawing-room, after he had carried ont the provisions of my will, one of which was that my remains were to be cre mated, which he h^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H ter'g prayers.

'^^H ' Sell 'em io the fence bs banged,' co^^f temptnously replied the other; 'wot udti^^H fence want of them, I'd like to hnow? ^^^| much ; bat they're valu'ble all the same. ^^^^| you wait a day or two, an' look at the adve^^H tisements in the paper w'ile yer a waitin^^H Ef ye don't see a piees in the paper offaria* '-^^| lib'ral reward' fur the return of a vase or^^H 4 milk pitcher,' es you'd cal! it, an' 'no que^^H tions asked,' I hope I may git seven stretch^^H afore I'm a week older.

The burglar who held the lard cao^^| into which my ashes were being ' dumped* ^B trembled perceptibly, ani threw a iiaatyJ^^B apprehensive glasce around as if fearing the^^| approach of my angry spirit. His companion ^^B noticed his agitation, and with a scornful ^H smile remarked : yM ' Well, ef yon ain't the wust, Bfll— yer ». I flunk.' Then, with a few Jiyht taps on -the 9 bottom of the am to detach any^adfcesive Jfl grains that might be clinging to*the^M|^^j|H taele, he laid it asids with, ' There, o^^^^^^^| you'll keep, I -gasss, 'tfl yer called t^^^^^M her in the pantry.

She'stl^^^^^H Bill, an' vfe ought to treat the wimmen^^^^| respect.' ^^^IH As the burglar had predicted, my eorJB^^^^ law advertised for ' a rase or am,' and fee burglars replying through the 'personal column' over the signature 'Ashes,** the negotiation was soon concluded, and in con sideration of the payment of $30G by 'the party of tbe first part,' the lard can contain ing my ashes was transferred to his residence. I will do my son- in-law the justice to Bay that be did not haggle over the ransom charged by - the burglars. He even paid it cheerfully, and lost no time ia procuring another urn as familaT to tbe one that bad been stolen as possible. This urn, however, was not dis played on the drawing room mantle, and I was relieved from contact with my hateful ' intimate friends ' by being relegated to my daughter's dressing-room, the arn being con cealed in a lacquered cabinet on the bureau. Here my ashes were comparatively safe from the vandal hands of vulgar burglars, but not from the ruthless mischief of my own flesh and blood. One day while the family was occupied in another part of toe house, my grandson, a little imp of Satan — a child five years of age — crept into the room, un locked the cabinet, abstracted the urn, and concealing it nnder his apron, slipped out in to the back yard, where, with water and a broken stick, he mixed about hall of the con tents of the err. into mud pies. Great heavens — just think of it ! The ashes of a dignified, respectable old lady converted by a young scoundrel into mud pies 1 — and the ashes of his own grandmother, too ! Distinct KhpnHj have taught him reverence for the dost of one but for whom he would never bave had an existence. Bai this was not the worst of it. A hsndf nl or more cf my ashes remained in in the urn, and the child, beginning to realize that he was committing a domestic felony, became frightened, and picking op the am, started back to the dressing-room with it. Passing through the dining-room, the castor on the dining table caught his eye, and another brilliant idea stnics him. He emp tied the pepper bottle into the fire-place and filled it again from the orn. He performed the same operation with the salt dishes, and then distribatea my remaining asbes in the vinegar and oil cruets and the mustard bottle. Having thus disposed of my remains, he re turned the urn to the cabinet and awaited developments. They came at the dinner table that afternoon. 'Matilda,' said my soa-in-law, ' this is. the queerest tasting pepper I ever saw in my life.' ?' What, my dear, what does it taate like ? ' inquired ray daughter. 'Like old dried bones, as far as I can make out,' replied her husband. 'And the mus tard has the same taste. Look3 as if some body had bsen emptying the pepper to tbe mus tard bottle — it's full o' little gray particles ; and there's a sediment in the vinegar cruet, and — just taste that salt, MatUda.' My daughter touched her tongue to my ashes and averted her face in -3isgu3t. ' Why, Alfred ! ' she exclaimed, ' what can it be?' 'I'll tell you, Matilda; it's some cf oar young hopeful's work, that's what it is. Come here, you young rascaL What have you been patting into the pepper bottle, Alfred! Speak up now, and no lying. If you tell me a lie I'll whip you within an inch of your life.' Tije boy bursl into tears, and for a time neither threats nor expostnktioas had any efiect ! npon him. At lasi, on a promise that he should have a new drum and a train of ' steam cars,' he blurted oat : ' It's gran'ma.' 'Grandma!' cried his parents simul taneously. ' Yes.heiinud.' ] ' Her mud 1 ' The plot wa3 thickening. Mystery brooded ovar that housshold. *' You know, papa, that speckled stuff yoa said was gran'iua, up in the jampot ia mamma's room.' A shrill shrink resounded through the hou.-e, and rav daughter fell fainting to the floor. With a s'ri^Ltful oath, my sca-iu-Iaw rushed into his wife's dressing room, tore open the cabinet, hastily unlocked the urn, and four;d is— ciupty. He reeled against the wall, one hand pressed coavol BiveSy against his brow, the other clutching the arn, at which ho stared like a. maniac As he elowly sank to the floor, bis limbs trembling with honor, I heard him gargle rather than mutter : ' My -Jod ! my God I I've eaten my mother in law.'
