i The Archbishop of Canterbury on 1 Temperance Societies. 1 The following passage from the Prim- ary Charge of the Archbishop of Canter- bury will be read with interest. It occurs in the division dealing with " The Spirit of Strength,"-" And now, last in the or- der of building our society, we avail our selves of that wonderful law according to which the Spirit of Srength works in a veiled manner through the companionship of the likeminded and their association in action ; works wonders by them even when those who are associated would one by one have no strength even of resistance. Here is a very decided and manifest law of the operation of the Holy Ghost. We cannot bring a number of people together steadily for a good end in right ways without fiuding every one of them streng- thened to powers, not only of resistance, but of achievement which ho would never attain in any other way. It is this law which gives to Temperance Societies such extraordinary power against evil. It overcomes temptation for individuals iii most cases,perfectly, and even to a great degree in many 'failures." "
