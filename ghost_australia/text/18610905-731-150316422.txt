Police Magistrate was/that he identified himself with Qie Police Court troubles of bis lancjlojftl; , ' The loudest complaint still against tbMJiiifif '.V Constable is that he espouses the like his host. Is npt this an unsatisf^iMfl^atb'rbf aflhirs for a small place? and proofs I?' of its evil working beforame^Al^sin^^^yoiir' correspondent asks too m^l'lri^iU'i^ulrcs me to forbear commentiu^^M^^l^jfoittpvern ment officeT 6hould^^|^g^^^^^ftwell in houses which are toto^(ri£^^^Mt-bcds of crime ; and this reqa|^^| Jjp ®5y ' that it is time even the reapecte^i^^Mt of the Court sought out more retired lodgings. The poor man complains justly that it is hard f| to initiate a court case without getting drunk R over it !—? a most startling statement, Mr. Editor. In the first place, he says, an applicant for a summons must go to a tavern — (a moat unsafe place to.enter for sonoe men)— at one end of the town to make bis complaint before the Police Magistrate ; that's temptation 1. He must then go to the Clerk of tbe Court, who lives in another diinking-house, to bave a summons fillStl in : that's temptation 2. He then probably has to return to the Police Magistrate to get it signed ; this is No. 3 And, finally, he may have to call upon tbe.Ghief Constable at hiB peculiar inn; and, of course, tbat^temptation 4. If this is not an' exaggerated picture of the temptations , thrown in the way of men who may come into towii for an especial pnrpose,-can there be any doubt, except in an oUicial's mind, of the gross impropriety it iliuBtrites.' Mr. Haynes has beenJHie victim to some ex tent of a 'jealous'pot-liouse fionspiracy, and bos been grossly misrepresented, and maligned. . He has hiB faults, though, and' I sbould be pleased were he' to correct the'm.: He mutt ihank his impolitic friend' for my' now saying that his tediousness over simple 'cases in the Court amounts to a mania, anil that his droll and absurd manner of conducting himself «hd the Bench is .driving- men from his tide who have long satigfadtiBrily conducted 'its' bu'sin?*is. I do xiot think they are right to withdraw as they am withdrawing; but, if tbey -.mean to leave tuS' work to the Police. Magistrate, from whatever motive, I warn them from taking periodic inte rest only in their duties ; and especially, as on the other day only, when a sense of those duties may be traced' to a strong-desire to serve a friend, or propitiate an enemy. ? 'i I have endeavoured to uphold the' usefulness and the claims of the Police Magistrate— to shield him from the insults improperly cast upon him. .1 tried to turn his arrival in'. Gpyndab to account for the «x-mmoh gppd, by contrasting his steadier conduct with those justice^ who ^aspired to be dubbed good fellbws, who indulge in getting 'jolly screwed,' .and who act as though they believed their first duty in the Court was to serve or mate '« fribftd; and, above all, I tried to check that mountebank 'Bertorii' from prostituting hiB magisterial , influence fpr politi cal purposes. ' Only the other day ! saw him busy at; this rascally work. Had Mr. Haynes - applied his legal knowledge and undoubted talents in a rational -way I should have better succeeded, ;for it is even; aow'only to-'escape from too much of him that the people here turn at all to the ' happy family party *' set. One pf the most humiliating sights ever affoided by the . race^ of dirt-eaters we had lately in an ofeten- _ tatious display .of sham - affection by those pan- ' deling magistrates towards -a inan-whom they never . speak vof ; but to abuge, . who had -veiy 'properly 'Been incarcerated in .the lockup,, but who for the 'occasion was fol lowed out 'of ' Cou rt, shaken hands with, and almost kisBed. Heughl such conduct cannot.be paralleled In' any other community than puis, nor by any other section , of it than the class which ' court, the, ^Police Magistrate's company indoors, bnt have'lately 'retrained from being much with hiin in tho street. Your remarks about our paper are £po true : it is falling from the same cause as of old. The gent who disfigures even its columns finder the signature of ' J ack ' is a neat production of the genus homo, and associates -with a very nice lot. He is to be promoted to a prominent place 111\. the happy family, party,, and is-coming out with'an ode jn praiBe of the Police JMa^jstrate.
