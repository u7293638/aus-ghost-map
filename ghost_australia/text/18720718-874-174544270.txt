THE EAST MELBOURNE GHOST. A COTTAGE in East Melbourne For a residence I boast, And that's a place you'd never think Was haunted by a ghost. But there is one, a perfect fright, Resorting there all day, In the shape of a figure tall and slight Of a young man dressed in grey. Chorus—He's a nuisance; fol de riddle ido. Perfect; fol de riddle ay. He takes his stand before your door, And then he'll gently raise His eyes aloft to the upper floor, And there for hours will gaze, Delighted with that little game, Then swiftly glide away, And serve some other place the same, Will that young man dressed in grey. Chorus—He's a, &c.; He views, with looks contemplative— Just fancy his artful dodge— The homes (as if he were really alive) Where lovely women lodge. So, girls, if you want to do your hair, Don't go near the window, pray, For fear of meeting the hideous stare Of the young man dressed in grey. Chorus—He's a, &c.; When people saw him watch, of course They fancied him a spy, Or member of the Detective force On duty, on the sly. At first they laughed, but now their mirth Has changed from grave to gay, In dread of this visitor, not of earth— This young man dressed in grey. Chorus—He's a, &c.; No matter, wind or storm, or wet, To him it's all the same, And no one's ever managed yet To stop his little game. He'll, lingering up and down the street, With gingham hoisted, stay For hours, as if he liked the treat— Will this young man dressed in grey. Chorus—He's a, &c.; Could some Inspector of Police Curtail this bogy's pranks, And make his spectral visits cease, He'd well deserve our thanks, For managing, in spirit-land, To permanently lay The ghost that haunts East Melbourne, Of the young man dressed in grey. Chorus—He's a nuisance; fol de riddle ido. Perfect; fol de riddle ay.
