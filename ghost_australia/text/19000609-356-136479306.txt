WHY SIINTRIES GO .MAD. Peering into darkness or semi-darkness while on sentry duty has a tendency to pro duce a distortion of vision which makes of every bush an enemy, and this has in. many cases, even so recently as the Sou dan campaigns, so affected the herves of men that they have had a resulting mono mania as to eternally seeing various creep ing objects. One man in the Soudan saw every object of a vivid crimson for some months after being on outpost duty dur ing an alarm, and he was only cured with great difficulty. General Hamley tells on. sentries, who, on being relieved, yet stood stock still, immovable, speechless, and staring fixedly into vacancy. in some cases, after the man had been removed this sort of fixity would remain for hours. Eeven in peace time, there was a case lately where a young sentry wound ed the guard by firing at it under the be lief that he saw a ghost; and Lord Rob erts, in one of his magazine articles, re lates that even the most reliable and truth-'. ful of soldiers on sentry often have thes most fantastic stories to tell, due to shat= tered nerves. Great numbers of soldiers in war time have committed suicide or ac cidentally shot themselves, the cause, often. being that they imagined they had let-. 'someone creep past them, and had thus be-. trayed their trust.
