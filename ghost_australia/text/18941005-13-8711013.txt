concerned Mr Deakin was on the extreme end of the back bench When he shifts the party will be rudderless Mr Shiels wandered all over the chamber without stopping us) where For a time he had the Premiers seat, but no importance was attached to that circumstance he is understood to be determined to sit in prox unity to the labour party Whether he or Mr Deakin is to be the power behind the throne remains to be seen Betting is even 'they both introduced the Premier when the time came for Ministers to be sworn in On the left the party is Top sided, the corner benches holding the greater

detestable thing called retrenchment The country required that there should he of Arthur retrenchment if more taxation was to be imposed, and it was necessary for PorUtv ment to show "that it was stronger than any of the minor powers in the state, and would not permit itself to be die tated to by those in the service of the state ' You should not have threatened them ejaculated Mr Hancock The Premier replied that the Ministry had not had time to prepare its policy, but constantly) contradicted himself by saying that its policy would command the support of a large majority in the Chamber, and that his only fear was that it would be so good that Sir James Patterson would be compelled to sit behind the Ministry) He scored the first point Mr Maloney gave Mr Hear, the new Minister of Lands, an oppor twenty to make his first official statement, and then the motion was agreed to and the House adjourned Members dispersed into the lobbies after having devoted about an hour's time to the service of the country, for which they will receive about £22 each, which seeing that these are times of retrenchment, must, it is supposed, be considered very reasonable The visitors to the galleries were evidently quite unaware of the Coolgardie character of the proceedings which they had been witnessing Mr Andrews and Mr. Methven, whose colours went down at the general election,

A general conversational discussion took place, in the course of which it was insisted on by several members that the immediate essential to keep the farmers on the land was the passing of a measure to provide cheap money and that the Government should be urged to bring in the Credit Foncier Bill in some shape at as early a moment as possible Mr M'Imiiu. moved that a party be formed to be called the Country Party Mr M'Iscn7ie seconded the motion which was carried Mr Irvine only dissenting Mr M In mu moved that a committee be formed to formulate a policy to be submitted to a future meeting of the party, such com- mitted to consist of Messrs Graham M Kenr.p M'Leod Bros e, Grattan and the hon secretaries Misses L Langdon and 11 run son The motion was seconded by Mr Bowser and camel unanimously It was in Senate d that a meeting would be called before the mci ture, of the House to receive the report of the committee, and that the meeting will be convened by advertisement and not by circular
