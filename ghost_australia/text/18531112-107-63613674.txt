ORIGINAL POETRY. A DIRGE. On the late Captain Sir James Everard Home, Bart., C. B. Far from his country has the seaman brave Look'd for the last time on the wave-- Look'd for the last time on the tide That had so long carried his warlike pride. Far from his country, but not far From his countrymen: from them alone Death can take him-- Death parted can make him-- By taking him from the earth which they cover, From the earth which they crowd and spread over From zone to zone. O English sailor brave, Tender-hearted as a woman, Faithful friend, and fearless foeman, One boon of thee we crave. Let not thine eager spirit Haste at once to inherit Its stormless rest With the good and the blest. For to thy valiant ghost A mourning British host Prepares to render The rites funereal of a martial splendour. O, stay, We pray, Until the soldiers shine In long and stately line; While thy gallant crew, Manly, tender and true, Who would have won for thee the laurels gory, Who would have borne thee to a victor's glory, Now wreathe for thee the cypress-gloom, And bear thy body to the tomb. Then, when the lengthen'd column Slowly winds away; When the soldiers and the sailors, Common mourners, brother wailers, Mingle their sad array; And the martial music solemn Pours on the air its sweet complaining: Then, our tribute not disdaining, From the folds of that banner Which, free and unfurl'd, In the high English manner Thou hast borne round the world, Let thy soul flutter forth, and fly Exulting into the sky. There the angels, from some azure height Gazing down upon the solemn sight, And pleased to see due honor given To a mortal brave by mortals, Will open wide for thee the portals Of the starry heaven.
