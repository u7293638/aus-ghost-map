THE POLICE. To the Editor of the PASTORAL TIMES. SJR,â€”Your last issue contains an account a " Clever Capture " made by Detective Alt s ander of the Melbourne police force, aided Mr. John Taylor of the Royal. I admire tie activity of the Police Officer as well as Mr. Taylor for his prompt assistance ; but it d< ts not occur to you that the fact of the detect) e seeking aid from Mr. John Taylor, while the exists in the town a well paid and well tak: care of police force, is rather a censure on tl: body of doughty champions/ The splendid condition of the horses of tie force, whose coats shine like polished steel, an whose " bread baskets " are so large and bold, proving how sound and fattening is Government fodder in Deniliquin, do not show sigis of the times when other people's horses are starving for want of food. Would it not have redounded to the credit of man and berst if they had been called into requisition to a d the smart detective from Melbourne, vlb would'then have carried back to that city tit pleasing intelligence that the Deniliquin poli<^ force is worthy of commendation, and that thqr did not require the aid of a ay civilian in tie course of their duty 1 I am &c.;, 13th Nov. PEEL'S GHOST.
