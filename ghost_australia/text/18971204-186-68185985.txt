Her box was soon packed, and in less ihan an hour she was ready for her journey. She eat down in the cool morning to await the hour when she might call upon Mr. Kennett, but after a time found inaction Juite unbearable. She looked at her watch. t was not quite six o'clock.

Without a word to anyone, Bhe slipped quietly out. She walked rapidly across High-street, through Fargate, Barker's Pool, and thence on to the Moor, and in the direction of Sharrow Vale. The fresh morning air revived her a little, as it fanned her pale cheeks, but no gleam of riaiog sunlight could brighten np those heavy eyes. Walking and loitering sbe passed the time on til ahe thought Mr. Kennett would have breakfasted, and then faintly turned her Btsps towards bis door. To eay that that gentleman was surprised at her appearance and intentions would be to understate the case considerably. Gravely and earnestly, witb all the feeling eloquence of his kindly nature, he strove to combat her resolution and to fathom the cause of her extraordinary conduct. ' It is no use, Mr. Kennett,' ehe said at length, ' I am unable to tell yon why I must act thus — the secret U not my own . to tell and I must be silent whether I will or no.' She had been very plain and bluot witb him, had shown scarcely any traces of deep feeling as ahe laid the case before him, bnt it seemed that at last bis persistence wearied out her resolution to appear calm. ' We must stop the discussion at once,' she cried in pained tones. ' I can stand it no longer. Believe me, the idea of being Mr. Blake's wife altered, while it was a possibility, my whole being. Life seemed about to be come a higher and more beautiful thing than I had everimagined it could be. I realise, you can never know how fully, aU I am losing, aU I have lost, bat— it must be.

When he epoke again there waa that in his voice that touched and strengthened her. ' Miss Calvert, from what I have seen of you I quite believe that only the best intentions, the purest motives, could move you to take such a course as this. I am con vinced, further, that something of a very serious nature has happened to induce you to adopt it- I pity you from my heart, for I knowthatyoumustneedit. You may command shall be proud and glad to do aU in my power to assist yon.' The tears weDed op in her eyes .at bis generous offer, but she repressed them firmly. ?? I should do wrong to reject your aid,* she replied, ' and I will eagerly avail myself of it. I have a Few pounds, but they will not but me very long, and I want you to find me a place if you can where I may maintain my self by my own laboars. I am a good nurse, as yon will admit, eir,' with the ghost of a smile, ' and if you could obtain me a situation in one of the hospitals T should be very thankfuL I want no sinecure, you under stand ; it must be a place where there is work, and plenty of it. If I cannot work I shall go mad.' « Yea, yes,' he answered. ' For all Rieat trials work is a necessity. When do you propose to leave Sheffield V *' To-day,' she said. 'I shall Bhall go direct from here to tfae railway station.' 'Do you not intend, then, to see your father again— your mother?' ' No,' responded the girl with a shiver. ** Let me have my own way, please.** -He saw that there was something amiss here that all his efforts must fail to amend, and nrped her no farther. ** Where do you propose to go ?' ' Anywhere. AU places are alike to me. Hare you any idea as to where I could get a situation at once ? If so I would accept it to morrow. The sooner I find something to occupy myself with the better.' He considered a few minutes. ' Since we conceive the notion of founding a new hospital here,** he said at length, **I have, as you know, been in correspondence with one of the London institutions with regard to the requirements of such a building. I have no doubt that I could obtain yon a place at once in St. Margaret's, if you like to go there.'* ' Are you sure of this ? 'Quite sore,' he answered. 'I know Dr. Ellis, the principal, very well.*' ' Then to London I will go. Can yon give me the train times?** * ' Tes if you are really determined not to rive yourself the opportunity for further re flection.*1 *? It woald be positively useless, and I dare noi : 'Then yon may leave here about eleven o'clock. I will wire Dr. Ellis to se&daomeone; to meet you. 'Oh, there is do necessary for that.' 'There may be,' replied Mr. Kennett, firmly. ** And it is best to do so. And now, I rely upon you to keep me acquainted with your whereabouts in tfae event of your leaving St. Margaret's. We must keep you in eight, Miss Calvert. We never know what may happen, and I cannot reconcile myself to the thought of losing sight of yon in the great vortex of London.' 11 1 am very greatfnl for your kinflneg*. Very greatfnl indeed. I will promise to let yon have my address very gladly, but it must be on the plain understanding that it is known to you alone, and that you will under no cir cumstance acquaint anyone else with it unless you have my authority to do so.' The curate quite understood the person ehe had in mind, but after a momentary considera tion gave the required assurance. 'I think thatUall, sir,' she said at length. ** For the present I must say good-bye.' She held out her little hand, and he took it in a warm, friendly grasp. 'There is no help for it?' he asked, im pelled to make one last appeal, for he knew how much unhappineas her departure would be the cause of ; knew also that the good work must inevitably suffer by her action. 'There ia not!' she answered wearily. ' Do not try me further. I begin to feel faint- hearted — childish. Good-bye, sir I' ' Good-bye, Miss Calvert— Tapbenes. There is that in your face that forbids me to oppose yon. You need comfort that can only cpme from one source. Vou remember, my dear, what Longfellow says — 1&h;,*when the infinite burden of lifedescendeth upon Tbeo it ia jzooi to pray onto God, (or his sorrowinjr children Turns He ne'er from Ilia door, but bdps and heals aod consoles tbem.1 That, Taphenes, prayer and the work of heal ing others may console even you. May God be with you. Good-bye !' With a choking sob she turned hurriedly from him and was gone. Gone to battle with the great sorrow that had fallen upon her ; to struggle in the unsympathetic city with the passionate yearnings of her heart, with the shattered bopea and vanished visions, newly-born and stifled in the moment of their birth.
