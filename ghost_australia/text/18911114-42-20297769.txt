Flotsam and Jetsam. The Answer of Jindoobarrie to Poet Meston. Meston. Alas! alas! the teardrops shed In honour of our noble dead By pale-faced Archie Meston, Australia's lyrics never knew A poet half so good and true At poet Aiohie Meatonl Bee how the trickling teardrops Howl See how his heart i» filled wKh woo Oar unrecorded sighs to know— Bandam Jindoobarrie. What do the fleeting vistas tell, As rolls the pathos and the swell, •The pathos of the black man's knell t The knell of Jindoobarrie! Why did the Moses breathe the ore, Or tune the favoured poet's lyre, To light the black man's funeral pyre In never-ending flame? Why did he sigh a fearful doont| And shut us in a living tomb, As rolls on us in mighty boon The thunder of our shame ? Give up, oh seal the stately dead: Give up, oh spears! the blood-drops bled: The vistas on his vision shed, 80 dim and shadowy. As sadness and its echoes pour O'er sand-duneß on the golden shore, And death's eolipse be told no more By singing Carooinggi. Te thousand ghosts beyond the shades Where Cape within the ocean fades, How came a nightingale in Hades r Talba—the funny question I In ocean's dip the fight goes on, The white-winged ships are borne along, And spears and flames in shades and song Name our tormentor- Meston. JINDOOBARRIE.
