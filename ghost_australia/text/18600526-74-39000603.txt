OUR OWN tFREISCHUTZ. To cast such balls as should not fall Toreaeh their destination. The marksmen, in the German tale, Performed an ineantatlon Around a magic circle set Black stones and skulls in order That ghosts and demons might not get At him behind its border. Ho called upon the Devil's name To bless his undertaklng, And thau endow with certain aim The bullets he meantmakin t With things uncanny minxed the lead, Unhallowed words recited, At noon of night awoke the dead, And flonds to dance invited. Hobgoblins frisk'd and yelled about, And reptiles crawl'd and twisted, And shabrouded skeletons, without Tha charmed verge nssistd : Whilst ho those fatal ballets east At farthest range for ehooting, And husge bats hovered on the blast, . And fireeyed owls kept booting. These bullets, all but one, went true, Baut that one did miscarry, And shot, for 'twas to go askew, The maid he wished to merry ; Thus showing, that with charm and spell The jager should not trifle, Bat learn the art of shooting well Whih honest ball and rifie. Our rifle corps on macls aid, Indeed, place no rellsnco t T':ey've buallets, though, unerring made :By help of art and science, To fetch an eagle from the sky As high as you can view him, And, if your hand hbe firm, and eye , Be sure, go right slap through him. Or should a foreign wolf come, bent Oar native land to ravage, Those ballets, with precision sent, Far oRf will pierce the savage, None go askew young maids to kill, Or old wives, cows, and cattle, ' If yoi but learn, with cautlouandrill, To markyour tfoe in battle.
