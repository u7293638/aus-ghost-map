mi ORfCjNfiL POETRY. TOO DEfcP FOR TEARS. 0;:t of the flilonce, coUl and drc.ir, Of the ghostdtUe pliantomi of yesteryear, Coiucs the low wailing, full of fear, Of a pain too deep for tcarv. Out of the stonn rack overhead With its distant ramble, nll tluinder fed, Comes the deep anguish, full of dread, Of a pain too deep for tears. Out of the ocean's ceaseless tide, With tho deep sea sccret3 its cold depths hide Come the sad murmur, far and wide, Of a pain too deep for tears. "For my love lies dead 'neafch tho low'ring sky, .While the scro leaves fall and bare branches t fiifih, . And tho sad sea moans and tho wind blo ws high, And my pain is too deep for tears. Ada Warn.
