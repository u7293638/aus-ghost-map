Having a presentiment, ' hat he should .-re tV.em no more, he again ele irs his conscience of their bluoi (ver. 2d), and proceeds to give them a sol]:mx r:\noiLTATiox. 1\.

'J'heir responsibility was great., for (a) The Holy Ghost had called them to the oiiiee, though men set them apart (Acts xiii. 2, 3). (I) Thev v.a re the " llock of God" (see 1 Pet. v. 2).

The apostle again recurs to one portion of their duty, and enforces it by bis own example of unselfishness anil disinterestedness, vi:c., to fa re for the poor, "support tho weak." If you cannot alford it, work with your own hands and you will have enough and to spare. As a further inducement he quotes, in ver. 35, o;ie of the many (John xxi. 25) •\nreeorded sayings of Jesus, " IL is more blessed," Sea. There is a luxury in doing good.

Tho farewell prayer, not only for them, but with them ; 2. the farewell tears—" wept soro ;" 3. the farewell kiss of affection—(the Greek tense implies that (he kissing was long continued)—and Paul had at last to tear himself away, implied by the expression, " Gotten from tliem " (xxi. 1). It is worthy of note, that tears are three times mentioned in this short passage—(ears of suffering (ver. 19) ; tears of pastoral solicitude (ver. 31) ; and tears of personal affection (ver. 37). Practical Lessons. — Pastors and Sunday school teachers are Christ's " under-shepherds." Be thankful for them, and pray that they may have strength and wisdom for their charge. There are wolves in sheep's clothing still prowling about—infidel teachers, infidel books, Sunday science lectures—all seeking to devour the elder scholars ; and bad companions, pretended friends, seeking the ruin of the younger scholars. How may you know them ; (Matt. vii. 1."), lt'>). Flee from them (.John x. 5 ; I'rov. iv. 1!), and commit yourselves to the care and grace of the " Good Shepherd " (l'sa. i. 1-3 ; Judo 21).

The lleinchtrni of fjiring.—One of the be.-t. things said by the late George Peabody is this, spoken at a reunion at his native town " It is sometimes hard for one who has devoted the best part of his life, to the accunmhit f,m of money to spend it. for others; hut, practise it, ami keep on practising it, and 1 assuie you it becomes a pleasure."— JlUdiea' 3Ii'sr«lii.
