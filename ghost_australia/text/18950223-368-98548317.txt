SIFTINGS. To read one's own obituarv in the newspapera is not given to many, but the pleasure, if pleasure it be, will be enjoyed by Sir Robert Hamilton if he lives long enough for recent issues of the Tasmanian papers to be delivered. Somebody received a letter in the colonies stating that Sir Robert --who was at one time Governor of Tasouania-was very ill, and in some way this no ews was exaggerated in eirculn tion until the positive report; was spread that he had yielded up the ghost and beea gathered to his father s. Thereupon the four daily paprro of Tasmania pub lishedtbiographicealotices,bcig oeulterprisin gjouroals which had had thle notices, uo doubt, stowed away in readiness in conveoienct pigeon boles ready for sucht a contingency. T-Iowever the looked-lor confirmation of the death didn't come, and as time went by it beogan to look as if thle obituaries were a little lpronelature. So thle two Ioloartt papers, takingh tilmen by the forelock, spologisedt for publishing tees biographies. It it easy to imagine with what a shook to their pride esomo apompous individuals would poeruse these quasi post-mortem notices of their lives and chabractrs. Instead of thlree columns of oulogy whlich they expocoted woulcd dignify their exit they mighlt find themselves dismissed withll a contemptuous paragraph stating tie date of their birth, and precious little else.
