SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 21, lS'Jl. The future of Victoria is admittedly it question for grave discussion, not from any party standpoint, but in a broad and patriotic spirit. Times have changed with the colony. There is in war an operation called a "change of " base." 'J'lio army which has drawn its daily supplies from a particular quarter now abandons that quarter, and looks for support and sustenance to another. And students of history know that there is no more anxious period in military life. No general will hazard the undertaking unless it is forced upon him by stern necessity. So it is with the colony. For years past Victoria has lived upon a double, a faulty, and a contradictory system of borrowing largely in order to bring commodities into the country, and of taxing through the Customs heavily in order to keep commodities out. The borrowing led to the undertaking of huge and useless public and private works. The taxing rendered com- modities dear and led, as was intended, to the creation of many highly artificial trades. With the stoppage of the borrowing has come inevitably the break- down of the whole policy. The community wakes to find itself with an overgrown city and with a neglected country, with investments of doubtful utility, and with its own particular resources still undeveloped. The necessity has become apparent for a national " change of base." We dealt with this all-important subject as a whole in our Thursday's issue, when we formulated and called attention to the guiding principles which this journal has long advocated. And happily we can say that the swing of the community towards those principles is very evident. Those who watch the signs and symptoms of the time will see on every hand evidence of the growing inclination of the people to make a bold forward move towards accepted economic truth. Some change, the people see, must be made. We have diminished our exports of late, and we have increased our debts. Anti show the process has to be reversed, and we must if possible increase our exports, and assuredly we must decrease our debts. The old idea was to tax the country districts in order to employ people in Melbourne in working up foreign or imported material, and the new idea is to go no further in this profitless direction, but rather to devote every energy to develop- ing our own Victorian resources. We must live by our products. That is the view of the case which is being more and more accepted daily, and undoubtedly it is the correct view. Nor is it too much to say that it is upon the thorough acceptance of this vital doctrine that the immediate future of Victoria largely depends. Our gold, our wheat, our wool, our wine, our butter, our frozen meat, these and such articles as these are our sources of natural wealth. But they are only sources of actual wealth so far as we can make a profit out of them, and hence it is that the first object of the country must be to increase the producers' " profits." Obviously the more we increase the producers' profits the greater is the surplus for expenditure in Victoria in wages and on manufactures, on the home and at the store the greater must be the general prosperity. If these country industries are our main industries, then our every endeavour should be to maintain them in a buoyant condition in order that they may the more easily support the dependent city trades. Every community is entitled to its ideal. But it is for a community also to work with nature and not against nature. Taking things as they are, our task in Victoria is evidently not to attempt at present the creation of great cities on the British and Continental scale ; we are not called upon to force on the growth of the factory system ; but rather our healthy and hopeful mission is to lift up country life-to introduce the vineyard and orchard work which is pleasant to the individual to establish the dairy farm with its comparative emancipation from agricultural drudgery; to place comforts, society, and remuneration within the reach of residents outside the towns. In due course great manufacturing centres may spring up here. If so, well and good. But if they come at all they should come naturally. Our legitimate aspiration is to inaugurate the model country life. Those who admit that the natural industries of the land are our main industries, must go yet one stop further and must also acknowledge that the market for our wheat, our wool, our butter, our frozen nioat,!,tfca, is abroad. Melbourne is glutted already with all such products, and it would be more madness to add another bushel of wheat or another ton of butter to our present yield in the hope that the local home market would consume same. This being the case-and it is impossible that the statement should be seriously chal- lenged it is evident that the future is I associated with the colonist who produces for sale abroad. We have to 1 trade with the world, and this implies that we have to trade against the world also We have to live by the world's markets, and in the meat, markets we must be prepared to encounter the cheapest labour and the most perfected machinery the strongest muscles and the keenest wits ,\0 obtain no protection, no allowances but only bare justice in the soieiestufo to which we are now committed Under such circumstances it is vain to ask the Victorian produce to miss sacrifices for others If sacrifices me to be made they must be made for him in order in every way to help him I'm struggle on which so much depends We must not seek to tax the producer no matter on what plausible theory, but we must seek to reduce charges in an directions in his direct and indirect interests, changes at the Customs charges on the railways, and charges at the money that so far as we practically can the Victorian people are wanting neither in patriotism 1101 intelligence Large sections of them have been misled in the past by unusual circumstances, but experience teaches them as it teaches others, nations ha\otohve and loam, nations as well as men and the Victorian people once they are on the right path will, we are sure, display their old pardon for their country's good 'ihokeystono of the new policy is to increase the pioduceis'piolits" by 1 reduction of charges at home in order that the Victorian producer may command the markets of the world abroad The latest blow at " superstition " in London takes the very practical and not unpleasant form of a specially good dinner, so constructed as to come into violent collision with all the phenomena known to the literature of magic Xlie belief that a malign influence, in ks in the number tim toon is nearly as old as Christianity, and survives under modern conditions in very odd forms Multi tides still vaguely belies 0 that if thirteen persons sit down to dinner at one table "something will happen and the life risk of the whole unhappy tim toon is sensibly nug mented A poet so essentially modern ns BiiUNam has Moven this grim superstition into a sonnet In London, however, a group of dinner and advanced ' spirits, with Mr Ham.

This letter came up for consideration at the usual meeting of the council last night, and more than one member charge denied it as a piece of sarcasm which amounted to a studied insult. Mr. Trenwith, M L, A in a brief speech, moved a motion to the effect that the council were pleased and flattered " by the Premier's request for a written statement, but that they were still of opinion that the necessities of the case would be best met by deputation An amendment that a deputation of three should be appointed to submit in writing the views of the council was moved by Mr. G W.

A meeting of tradesmen and others was held yesterday, afternoon at Prell's buildings, Collins street, for the purpose of considering the best means of reducing the number of insolvencies among railway employes Mr I D Oliver occupied the chair, and in discussion which took place attention was drawn to the fact that a large number of railway employes had filed their schedules since the alteration of the duty allowing them to do so, and that in many instances the amounts owing by the insolvents were quite small, and such as they ought to be able to pay. they would not, however, pay their debts, and the consequence was that tradesmen lost boat and It was also pointed out that such insolvents were required by the law to obtain their certificates of discharge from the Insolvency Court within a reasonable time Mr Upton, solicitor, who was present, explained the state of the law on the subject, and suggested that a deputation should wait upon the Minister of Thursdays to see whether he could not cause a circular to be issued to the employes, and so cause a reduction in the number of insolvencies On the motion of Mr T C Murren it was decided that a committee of six should wait upon the Minister of KiaiIaviv}8 with the views seeingAvhetht r be or the commissioners could not act upon this suggestion.
