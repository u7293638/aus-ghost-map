SHOULD THE REDFERN RAILWAY BE EXTENDED ? Sir, — This question has lately been put before the public, and probably before many months are over, it will meet its final decision. That is to say, the public decision against it. There havo been large meetings held at tho Town Hall for the purpose of settling tho matter, Every timo the meet ings wore hold a large number of people congregated together, to hear what our J.V1.JT. 1)11(1 LO !iliy Oil tllU HUUJUUU 0.1115 meetings, however, were not liko unto church gatherings. They wore very noisy, and that noisy that our ' stiff-necked gents' could not got a word in edgeways. Praise bo to tho Sydneyites for defending their rightful property. As long as tho fresh air league is alivo, tho public havo tho sole right to uso Hyde Park. Looking at* the proposed extonsion of tho Railway Station into tho city, is a mattor that everyone could give answer to. The public generally think that the station is right enough where it is at present. What right have tho Government to claim public property? Why, at that rate, Mr. Editor, wo should havo outlaws all over tho country. Trying to take other people's property is a good way of setting outlaws an example. What need havo the Government for extending tho railway ? This question, howovor, is soon responded to by those who take interest in it, and tho answer will not occupy more than a few words. Thoir reason is, as all know well, for tho purpose of making thousands and robbing the public of thoir rights. Evory citizen ought to roll up and dofond thoir rights, not ?walk about liko a pomm in a sleep, or as our Parliamentary gouts call thorn ' walking ghosts.' In future, lot not tho arrogant class got tho host of you, and lot not them tako tho bread out of your mouths. — I am, &c;, G.N.U.N.
