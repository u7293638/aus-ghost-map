TO TTTR RDirnTl. Sirâ€” When first I read our Bishop's pro posal to open the service in our pulpite to* the various ministers of religion I waa much' pltased at the nroBnect oi a wider union 'of the people or Australia, Due since reading; the effuBion of the self-styled 'Rev. Bishoi- Kirby,' 'who had his licence years ago from the Holy Ghost, and that; licence duly countersigned by pro perly constituted Christian Churches,', I now see how our Bishop would have to drag his dignity through the mire, and would it be likely that we, an educated and intelligent cIobb of society, would come to sit and listen to euch egotistical doggerel as delivered by him on Sunday last at Port Adelaide 1 I am, Sirj&C;, .
