','.:' SPORTING NOTES : ! , ..,? ; ,'? -.[By Merlin.] , , .,, : , Th^j nominations for . . the Campbell Town* Steeplechase appear in another ?column, and although the foreigners do not muster so strongly, still the .result is satisfactory, especially so considering, thatitwill beworth £100 less to the winner, and £25 less to the second horae. , If the, handicapper is succcedaful , in his task ; a pood field mav be looked forward to. as all the horara nominated are Tasmanian owned, with the exception of AslanbegofF, Or uisor, and Alhambra. With the Eand w.iok! Meeting so close it will always be a matter of uncertainty whether any horses from the other colonies will compete in the Campbell Town Steeplechase so long as it is held in September,, ; as last year's experience , proved. , . . : In another column will .be , found a complete, list of the Melbourne :Oup weights, which were declared in Mel bourne on Monday, and which, we received by telegram. Commotion this year heads the litst with 103t lib against; Darebin with Oat 01b last year. Then the minimum was 6at, but now it is, according to the newiV.R.C. rules, which came in force on Monday, 6st 71b, or seventeen, pounds more than Banker carried in 1863, when he won the third Melbourne, Cup. ,., The crack. two-year-old of his year has no less than 8st 31b to carry,, and Archie has, therefore, a gigantic task set him, even allowing for the increased,, minimum. Stockwell, it will be noticed, is very nicely weighted at 8st 131b, while Bagot has 7st41b, or one pound. less than Stock well carried last, year into second place . Of the Tasmanian horses proper, Signor' and Prodigal are both handicapped at 7st lib., Since, ,the. weights have appeared several horses have been scratched for the Cup. ./ ).

Winter Meeting, which take? place on July 21, will also bo : found in another column. , , ??, The decision in Mr. Agnew's case, from what I hearj is not approved of by all members -of the Tasmanian , Turf Club, and [ the question will,, I understand,, be brought up at the annual meeting of the members., People,, too, are asking why; should ^Mr. Agnew be singled out? There, was; another gentleman who in the heat of,, the - ''moment,, made use of', stropg . .language .', like ... Mr. Agnew, and rf the .conduct of Mr. Agnew, is to be complained of 8p,,is( the other,' While eyery one would be glad to see the stewards protected, . if they are in Lthe : right the prospeot of a lawsuit is viewed; with much disfavour, as the prevalent opinion seems to be that a great mistake h»8 been made. A j letter from Mr. Agnew will : be found in another column asking racing clubs' to suspend their judg ment until the action brought by him' agdinst ? the 'stewards ' is heard. It will also -be ' noticed' that the question was brought up at the annual meeting of the T. ;R. C: at Hobart on Monday evening last,' when it was decided that according to the rules of that Club the disqualification could not bo confirmed. , ;? , For the Ladies' Bracelet at Oaulfield a field of 'no less than 42 horaos came to the post — the largest field that ever'; started in Australia, and within ? three of the largest, number of ' horses that; ever started' for any race in the w6rld. '''This! was 45 for the Steward's Cup, Goodwood, of i 863, and won by Orbagh Patrick,sub sequently imported to Yiotoria, where haf became well known as a sire. The Ghost seems to' inheHt all 'the Wild iDayrell speed, and ' lie achieved a clever viatory. The Ladies' Trophy and the Gold Cup were 'presented ; by hfsjExcellency the Goyerhdr' to ; the winners, and the luoky nominator, of ' The Ghost was Mrs. San derson, a laundress, who received a diamond bracelet, valued' at 150 guineas. Included -in 'the list' of starters for the Bracelet was Flaah of Lightning, belonging to thesame'owner as Spread Eagle. ' The latest I notice by- one! of the Victorian weeklies is that Spread Eaglo; hails from Borneo, instead of the Cape ! ' ? ; ? ?

Both, says ;' Nemo,??. are doing ». good' steady preparation at' Warwick Farm, and are i in splendid condition for the 'time, as indeed are all the horses that are being trained by Mr. Forrester. The owners of HyacinthusSt.,Albans— Meander's dam,' and Captain Webster, St. Albans — Duke of Athol's dam; are so pleased with the colts, and the manner in, which they have shaped at Dunedin Sum mer and , Autumn Meetings, that' they, have sent a commission up to purchase' another Sti Albans, and negotiations are, I understand,' in progress' with- regard to the purchase of Meteor. ; - I trust, how ever, that1 this gentlemanly and 'good looking son of St. 'Albans and Deception, will not be allowed; to .leave En tally. Metbor is a great favourite with :TaB manians, and|they all^expecttoseehim the winner of a good race, and would there fore; regret to hear of his expatriation.

The 'son of Maribyrnong and Fawn ought to be: a good croBS for Mr. Bryant's mares.:. A few have always followed the fortunes' of Bosworth and clung to him to the last,' in the expectation of seeing him : win a big race. Like the game Richmond, he showed beat as a three-year-old, - but unlike his elder brother, he had a temper, andl never 'distinguished himself, after wards as Richmond. i !?'?'! . The Frenchman, who is now under the^ charge of Mr. H. Connolly at'Malvern, is' well liked in his new quarters, as' I thought he would' be. 'Sterling,' a w'ell-known Melbourne turf 'soribe/; thus speaks of this promising colt':— ' A'very' handsome yearling 'by Napoleon,'1 but' of the Kitten, was shown me. He is marked with a narrow white' blaze, and1 fa! white hind foot, but is otherwise1 a 'jet black. He 1b a nice colt, and- with his- compact and powerful frame has a lot of 'Navigator about him.'
