THE BOYS OF SHAKSPEARE That Shakspeare loved Children, no one can doubt who remembers the intensely pathetic words which he puts into the mouth of Queen Constance in the fourth act of King John," and remembers also that the dramatist lost his only son, Ilamnet, in the very year this Historical play was produced Only from the heart of a parent, touched to the quick by a bereavement of this kind, could such a passage as the following have issued Every word palpitate with emotion, and you feel as you read them that Shakspeare looked at his paper, while he was writing them, through a blinding mist of tears - 1 For since the birth of Cain, the first male child, To Bill that did but Saterday suspire, There was not such a gracious creature born But now will canker Borrow cat in) bud At d chase the native beauty from his client, And how ill look as hollow as a ghost, As dim and meagre as an ague s at And so he 11 dio and, rising so shall, When I shall meet him in the court of heaven I shall not know him therefore never, never stunt I behold my pretty Arthur more. I will You hold too heinous a respect of grief I ONST He talks to me that never had a son Iv like you are as fond of grief as of your child CONST Grief fills the room up of my absent child Lies in his bed walks up and down with me, Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words, Ileincuib rs me of all his gracious parts, bluff out his vacant garments with his form , Then have I reason to be fond of grief And the whole of the scene in which the little prince expostulated with Hubert, up to a certain point, that is to any, as far as the words, "Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold, is so full of exquisite tenderness, of the simple eloquence the sweet winsomeness of childhood, and of pure, ingenuous feeling, that none but it large hearted man, endowed with a nature SO sympathetic as to quality him to dive into the mind of a gracious creature like young Arthur of Brittany could, I think, by any possibility, have written it in the " Winter's Title" it is the father speaks again, when Leontes exclaims, with young Mamilius on his knee : " I looking on the lines Of mv boy's face, inuttiouvht I did report Front) three years and saw mvBotf unbrushed. In any green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled, best it should bite its master, and so prove, As ornaments o't do, too dangerous, How like- methought, I then was to this kernel, Tills squash this gentleman." And may it not be that Shakspeare has given us a reminiscence, of his own childhood in the dialogue between little Mamilius and his mother, where she asks the boy to tell her story, and he replies " A sad tale 's best for winter, I have one Of sprites and goblins " There was a man Du 1 till a church) amidst will tell It Softly; Youd'crlt leets shall not hear it" Many a time and oft, I suspect, had Master Willie Sliakaneare listened, in Henley-street, or by the fireside in his uncle's farmhouse at Snitterheld, to old-wives' stories of ghosts, witches, elves, and warlocks ; for a belief in these was universal in the reign of Elizabeth, and if the dramatist had not been familiar with the popular superstitions of his time, we might have lost the supernatural element in "Hamlet" and "Macbeth;" in "Julius Caesar" and "Richard the Third ; " in the " Midsummer Night's Dream " and in "The Tempest," In the two latter, more particularly, for there we find him, as one of his commentators has auld, "loyally accepting certain phases of the hereditary Stratford belief in supernaturalism, throwing them into poetical turn and making them beautiful Shakspeare's affection for bosabewroya itself, I think, in his portrait of the bright little fellow in "Henry the Fifth" He has served three us arrant rascals as ever trod shoe leather Ny and Bardolph, who are sworn brothers in filching, and drunkards to boot, and Pistol, who is a coward and a braggart They would fain have taught him to pick pockets, and would have educated him fathers own vices; but, young as he is the boy has read " these three washers" like it book, and after summing up their charge ters he arrives at the following conclusion. " I must leave them, and seek some better service. Their villany goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up." And so he vanishes from the scene, and probably becomes a good citizen, and possibly used to be Lord Mayor of London, which was the reward of good conduct in all fashioned story books unless, indeed, it has been suggested, he was killed in the wars Mrs. Rigg's son, William, is only introduced into in the comedy of the " Merry Wives of Windsor," and then chiefly for the purpose, I imagine, of rendering Sir Hugh Evans, the Welsh parson and schoolmaster, more ridiculous It is quite permissible to conjecture that little Willie Page was a reminiscence of little Willie Shakspeare, and that the sell important old pedagogue was also a sketch from memory of some Warwickshire teacher of the humanities ; perhaps of the very man from whom the dramatist acquired his "little Latin and less Greek." Moth, in " Love's Labour's Lost," as a pre territorially precocious little prig, who never opens his mouth but to utter a quip or a quibble, and no boy ever talked as he does since the human race began. Hut the comedy was written, as we all know, in Shakspeare's green and Bulletdiisa," and is, indeed, "an almost be) lah production." but we are once more brought into touch with human nature, and are reminded of the dramatist's kindly a) mp allies with boyhood in "Richard the Hurd," where tliesoungaon of George, Duke of Clarence, and the two young: Princes are brought up in the scene in the interview of the first with the aged Duchess of York, Shakspeare has contrived to exhibit the simple triHtiiilne'ss, the natural piety, and guileless thoiiL'liiH of the t In Id in a few brief sentences When he is told of his father's death, the boy exclaims " The hm.', my and, is to be for this it."! will nvLinro it whom I will Importuno M Till lull) Fire) c to all to that effect." And presently he relates how his uncle, Gloucester, had wept over him, and kindly kissed her du eel, and it iii! him he would have him dear I) as a child, and tina tyring from the duchess, mother though she be of the hs position! hunchback, a sudden outburst of ung rather sun's deceit, wherein the boy in- quires " Think Off my) uncle did dissemble, grandeur? ' To which she answers, "Ay, boy," and he rejoins, "I cannot think it" A beautiful touch of nature tins, and so characteristic of the generous faith of childhood, and of its incapacity to conceive of vices that are foreign to its own ingenuous innocence. And in the first scene of the third act, the natural curiosity and avidity for information which beset most of us in boyhood, are illustrated by the questions addressed to Glouces- ter by the young Prince; with respect to the truth of the legend which associates the name of Julius Caesar with the Tower of London and it is presently followed by a pretty outburst of childish ambition and princely patriotism " Au' If I live until I be a lunatic. (he says) 1 is win our ancient right in France rajah,, Ordiua soldier, as I lived a Iciiu " The whole of the succeeding dialogue, in which the younger of the Princes is somewhat manners to his hunchback uncle, and thoughtlessly reflects upon his mia simpen figure, is written with a consummate knowledge of the dangerous frankness, the unguarded. candour, and the saucy gaiety incidental to the period of life through which these boys are passing. As to the narrative of their murder in the Tower, as related by Terrell, when repeating the story of that piteous massacre," it may be confidently asserted that it could only have been written by one who loved children himself, and who must have experienced a heartache while be penned such words as these : "to, thus," quoted Dighton, 'las those tender babes,' . Times, thus," quoth I arrest, . tried lin j one another Within their innocent alabaster arms : Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, Which in their smiling beauty kissed each other.

In "Coriolanus" Shakspeare has sketched a picture of young Marcius in a few light touches ; but not complete the portrait is I Villius, who is a friend of Virgin, the boy's mother, asks after his health, and when she has answered the question of her visitor,' his grandmother remarks :--" He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look * Road before the Uullioiirnu Shakspeare Society at its intention. upon his schoolmaster ;" to which Valeria replies to' my word, the father's son. I'll swear 'tis a very pretty boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him on' Wednesday half an hour together; he has such a confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it be let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes and up again , caught it again and whether his fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it Oh I warrant how he mammocked it I" And the grandmother's comment on this is "One on a father's moods," wherein the visitor rejoins, Indeed, is, 'tis a noble child " Later on, when the great Roman matron visits the Volscian camp, with her grandson and his mother, as ambassador from Rome, to plead with the victorious general who had turned his arms against the Eternal City, all the father's heart speaks in the words he utters when he sees his son approaching him - "My young boy Hath an aspect of intercession which Great nature cries, 2 Pony not " And the mother of the hero exclaims, concerning little Marcius " This is a poor epitome of yours, VV high by the interpretation of full time May show like all yourself " The dramatist has put but a few words into the boy's mouth, but what an index they are to his resolute character. Volumnia has told the child's father that even if he should trample on his country he shall not tread on her, and young Marcius claimed in A shall not tread on me I II run away till I am bigger but then I II night In "Macbeth," the son of the Macduffs appears to be wise and witty beyond his years, and his remark that if liars and sweaters are to be hanged by honest men, the latter run a serious risk of being brought to the gallows themselves, because the former are so much more numerous, betokens a knowledge of the world which is scarcely to be looked for in one so young But there is a fine touch of natural affection in the last words he utters One of the murderers who have been suborned to put the family to death, speaks of the boy's father as a traitor," and the lad fires up immediately and exclaims, "Thou best, thou shag haired villain," whereupon the exasperated assassin stabs him to the heart, and the brave little fellow's only thought in that supreme moment is not of himself, but of his mother, for with his dying breath he cries out, "He has killed me, mother, run away, I pray you " And with this pathetic appeal to her to save herself The falls lifeless on the ground (other than hear his father traduced, the gallant young Scot did not shrink from provoking the dagger of the assassin, and his best efforts are directed to avert a similar calamity from the mother who bore him I pass over Young Lucius, in "Titua An dramas," because considerable doubts are entertained by those who are best qualified to speak authoritatively on the subject as to this repulsive play having been written, or even retouched, by Shakspeare. Certain it is, that it was produced by the Earl of Sussex's company on the 2 in) of January, 16tH, the dramatist being at that time according to Mr Eleay-a member of Lord strangeness pan) and therefore we may reasonably conclude-as all of us must wish that the creator of Imogen, Viola, Isabel, one Miranda, had no hand whatever in the drama referred to. It only remains to speak of that typical little urchin, whom we all know so well, and remember so vividly, " The wherein thee but, with his satchel And shlnlui'-tnorniug'raLe, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school I dare be sworn that, on many a bright spring morning, when Master Willy Slink speared lace had been soap. until it shone again, and when he crossed the threshold of the house in Henley-street and turned his face towards the Griiiiuntir-school, he did so with it reluctance well remembered in after years, and that when the summer and autumn came there was no more inveterate n truant than himself III the whole school I do not think he would have become so great it poet as he was, if he had not done so It was among the wooded hills of Welcome, in the green lanes of Bedford, Hampton, Lucy and Wilmecote, under the old yew tree in the church) and at Snitterlield, amidst the forest glades of Arden, III the punt at Charleston, and on the banks of the Abie and the Avon that Shakspeare received the inspiration which no creative genius drawn from books It was amidst the natural scenery of Warwickshire that the Muses found the truant schoolboy, and dropped into his receptive mind the souls of those exquisite ideas which werenlterwards to take shape and line their embodying pt in 'petunia and Miranda, in Ilernuu and Bosubud, in Imogen and Viola.
