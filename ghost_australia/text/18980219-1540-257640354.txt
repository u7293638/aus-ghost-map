Miss Blinker Scored. " That Blinker girl is hateful," said the girl with the sunburnt nose. " She is," assented the girl with the Alpine hat; "but how "— " How did I find it out ?" said the girl with the sunburnt nose, " Well, the way I came to grief with her was this : We decided to give a ghost party at our last birthday kickup." "Some old sheet-and-pillow case affair, I suppose V" " Nothing of the kind. You all sit in a dark room and tell ghost stories in turn. The person who tells the most blood-curdling one gets the prize. Of course, the incidents are all supposed to have happened to you personally," " Of course, I wanted to create a good impression, especially as Harry was there that week, and that Blinker girl was fairly haunting his footsteps. Somehow, I couldn't manage to think or even dream of a good one, though J ate a supper of Welsh rarebit on purpose. Finally, the very day of the part} 7 , I went to see my laundress about my dress—we were all to wear white, you know. To my joy, I found on her mantelpiece an old, dog-eared book of ghost stories. I borrowed it at once and took it home in triumph," " Well, you were in luck." " I thought so then. Well, that evening I told one of the stories—ofcourse, making myself the heroine. " It was a great success, and I felt that the prize was mine, when that Blinker girl stopped talking to Harry, and began to applaud. " Then she said—' Oh. how delightful. And did it really happen to you ?" " Of course it did," I said. " 'How perfectly charming,' she cried. ''My old nurse used to tell me that story when I was a very little girl, and I shall always enjoy it so much more now that 1 know that you are the heroine.' "
