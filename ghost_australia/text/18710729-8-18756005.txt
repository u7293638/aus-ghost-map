DISTRICT NEWS. [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENTS.] LOCHINVAR. A very interesting and somewhat amusing lecture was given in the Wesleyan Chapel, Lochinvar, on Thursday evening last, by the Rev. J A Nolan, Wesleyan Minister, West Maitland: subject "Ghosts." I need scarcely say that the lecture was a good one, and was listened to with marked attention by the audience -numbering about eighty, which may be considered very good indeed, for a country place like Lochinvar The proceeds,which would amount to nearly Â£4, -will go towards the circuit debt. Lochinvar, July 28.
