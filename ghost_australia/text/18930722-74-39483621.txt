A HAUNTED PALACE. The Stockholm correspondent of the Independence Belge tells this ghost story: For a long time it has been no secret that spirits haunt the royal palace in Stockholm. Years ago the King became so thoroughly convinced of the presence of ghosts that he had the big wing most frequented by them torn down and rebuilt. But the ghosts did not dis. appear when this alteration was made, and they still carry on their nightly carousals. A month ago the Danish Crown Prince and his wife, while visiting the Stockholm Court, lived in the haunted palace. On the first night there was an extraordinary manifestation. A chamberlain was lifted from his bed by invisible hands, and was laid on a table at the end of a bedroom furthest from the bed. On 'the follow ing morning Prince Tohann asked him if he had heard the uproar in his room. On the evening of the same day the Princess Louise was writing ina oom brilliantly lighted. Suddenly a woman appeared, and began extinguishing the hghts. The Princess Louise, who is cele brated for her courage, tried to lay hands on the woman, but the latter vanished as suddenly as she appeared. Prince Christian, the eldesb son of the Crown Prince, wished late one afternoon to fetch something from a dimlr.lighted room. He left his father and mother, only to retura a few moments later, empty-handed, white and trembling. He said that he had found the room filled with stranee figures, which barr d his way and made threatening gestures. The day before his departure the Danish Crown Prince was playing cards with the Crown Prince of Sweden, when Prince Gustav, turning white with fear, exclaimed that a giant was behind Prince Johann's chair, looking at his cards. Both princes ,prang to their feet, and the giant disappear.d. Nobody in the Swedish royal family doubts the presence of the ghosts, but the subject of their appearance is tabooed at Court.
