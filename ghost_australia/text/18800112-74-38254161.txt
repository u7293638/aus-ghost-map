FINGAL. (From a Correspocndenct.) The Christmas holidays, having passed away very successfully in the different parts of the colony, I must give you a short account of how the inhabitants of the Fingal district enjoyed themselves. Athletic sports were held at Man gana and Falmhnouth on Boxing- day, where all seemed to enjoy themselves. The horse-racing at Falmouth was very good, considering the heavy course.to run upon. One borses gave up the ghost whilst running in a race; a grave was dug, and it was buried within an hour. Fingal, after being quiet at Christmas time, roused herself for a grand gala on Boxing-day. The day was very hot, but no one seemed the worse fur liquor. The sports began about 10 o'clock. After some very bad starts the runners were got off. Miller seemed the favourite, which e afterwards proved. A cricket match also took place, which was played between the Fingal Eleven and twenty-two second-class, and was won by the former team. However, the greatest event of the day was the treat in connection with the Weoleyan Sunday-school, to which the children of Fingal look forward with much pleasure. The teachers-Mrs J. Oliver, Miss Reece, and Miss E. Clark-who worked vigourously on this occasion to make the event as great a success as possible, were at the chapel at It o'clock to meet the children,` whio marched up singing. After dinner they returned to the recreation grounds, where they enjoyed themselves in various games. They re turned to the chapel about 6 for tea, children, parents, etc., numbering about 300, soon making havoc amongst the pastry, etc. The Wesleyan Sunday'-school anniversary took place on Sunday last, the 4th inst. Taking into' consideration the short time given for practice, the children sang very well. The Rev. R. Thompson preached the anniversary sermon, and MBiss E. Clark presided at the organ.
