WALK UP! WALK WP! The latest London theatrical venture is to be found on a piece of waste land off the Whitechapel road, where, es chewing the giddy and rival delights of swings and shooting galleries, the dramatic student "walks up" the front flight of steps in the full golden glare of naphtha illumination, and, on pay ment of ld, gains admission to the most brilliant of travelling temples of tragedy. In the words of a Swiveller, "the contingent advantages are extraordi nary," for not only is the penny pit re-. markably roomy, but an orchestra stall costs but twopence, or, as ornate announcements on either side of the orchestra vividly put it, "front seats are a penny extra." The Whitechapel troupe displays pleasing versatility. The star trage diae. attends to the outside lamps, acts as chef d'orchestre at the barrel organ, or forcibly appeals to the public to pay entrance moneys promptly-all this in the robes of a Charlemagne. The leading lady, too, usefully com bines the parts of doorkeeper, medine val princess, money-taker, and sou brette. The programme includes a screaming farce and some ghost effects, the latter being calculated to make the beholder's flesh creep, and to deter him from the crime of hiding beneath the seats with a view to witnessing the performance again without paying for readmission. The first telephone was constructed in 1877, between Boston and Somer ville, ?Mass., a distance of three miles. The bitterness of a grain of strych nine can be tasted in 600,000gr. of water.
