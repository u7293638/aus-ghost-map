STOP THE MUSIC. THE Dean "has been "informed" by competent persons that Lady Godiva is the heroine in La Traviata. Quite true, and the " competent persons " are right for once. As the Dean reads no other paper but this, and as this is sure to meet his eye, we will give an outline of the opera. Lady Godiva is the only daughter of an English Baronet, and is frantically in love with Azucena, a dumb Castilian orange woman of the seventeen century. Now, Lady Godiva would fain marry the fair Castilian if she could find a clergyman willing to unite them, but one cannot be found until the end of the tenth act, when Mr. SPUEGEON is discovered beneath "the ruins of Pompeii playing WEBEB'S last waltz on a secular Jew's harp. At this moment Vesuvius breaks out again, and Lady,Godiva, who has been taking her siesta on a door mat, rushes into the street with nothing onâ€”but a a Dolly Varden costume and poxk pie hat. Leonora, who has lain hidden in the prompters-box up to this moment,^appears hand in hand with the Ghost of Hamlet's father, on the Trojan borse. Azucena , breaks into gaol, and is united to the Last Rose of Summer, as the 1 curtain falls. It is the tableau at the head of this article (where Azucena is having a set to with the Baronet) that has attracted theeagle eye of the Dean, on the walls.
