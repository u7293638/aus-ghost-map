DICK DOWNER'S DISENCHANT. MENT - Dick Downer was inclined to make a fool of himself about his pretty cousin, Mrs May. blossom. Notwithstanding that she had heartlessly jilted him, his devotion to her seemed rather to increase than diminish. He could. not, of course, ignore the fact that she had treated him most scandalously; 'but his mild resentment faded away to a vanishing point when it became apparent that his cousin's marriage was likely to prove an un. happy one. Captain Mayblossom seemed a good fellow enough in his way; but however a good fel low a man may be, if he is absolutely devoid \- of income and expectations, he is not'a desir able helpmate. No doubt when she eloped with him, Ada Mayblossoni had counted upon being;able to win back the indulgent affectionkof her adopted parent, Dick's father; but,-great as her influence had been over the old man, she soon found that he was vindictively implao able. Not only was this so, but old Job-Downer wa`s furious with his son for what he con sidered his want of spirit, proper pride in de fending his cousin after her treatment of him. Old Downer was never tired of denouncing his niece in terms in whick poor Dick could not; sit by and listen to without indignant remonstrance, whereby he not only irritated his father, but innocently helped to dissi pate the remotest chance of effecting a recon. ciliation between the two. In spite of his father's protestation, Dick was a frequent visitor at the trim little villa in which his fair cousin and her pauper husband resided. Being a simple-minded individual, he might have gone there fifty times without ever suspecting that Black Care was perched astride the gable. The house was daintily, even expensively, furnished; the living was excellent, for the Captain was particular about his food, and had the reputation of being one of the best iudges of claret in London; while the domes tic affairs generally were well ordered, and showed no signs of parsimony. Dick, however, was soon initiated by his cousin into the secret of impending trouble, and sympathetically shared with her the dis mal apprehensions which it involved. To most people--who, by the way, had a pretty shrewd suspicion of the extent of the Captain's income-little Mrs Mayblossom seemed entirely impervious to the worry of pecuniary embarrassments. She was always well-dressed, cheerful, ani mated and fascinating. But to Dick, in their confidential tfetd-t~tes, she confessed that her affected indifference was but a mask to conceal from the world the anguish which tortured her. She contrived to make Dick acutely sensible of the misery of a life of debt and false appearances, supplemented by worse than uncertainty regarding the future. Pretty Mrs Mayblossom had enemies, of eourse, and these did not hesitate to insinuate that she deliberately worked upon' her onusin's feelings for the sake of getting money out of him. It would have been nearer the trut-p Iaps, had they suggested that Mrs May blossom's motive was to touch indirectly, through Dick, the adamantine heart of her. uncle. At the same time it must be owned that she did get money out of Dick, and took it with a very faint show of scruple. Dick would willingly have parted with-the last farthing he possessed in the world to spare her a moment's uneasiness; but, unfor. tunately, the assistance he could render was of a merely temporary nature. Though nominally a partner in his father's business, his income was but that of a poorly paid clerk, and the old man, knowing, his son's simple habits, and no doubt suspecting the destination of his pocket-money, turned a deaf ear to all suggestions of a ' rise.' For his own part, old Downer refused emphatically to contribute a single farthing to the support of his erring niece and her husband, and manifested so unforgiving a a spirit that aft3r a time Dick abandoned, as absolutely hopeless, the ungrateful task of appealing to him. Meanwhile, naturally, things went' from had to worse in the Mayblossom menage ; creditors became clamorous, friends grew lukewarm and chary ; and the procuring of the commonest necessaries of life involved ingenious but humiliating subterfuges and manaeavres. To complicate matters, there appeared on the lowering, horizon of the future an ominous thundercloud which, when it hurst, would, as Dick feared, completely submerge his poor cousin in her sea of troubles. Dick had noticed of late that Captaini Mayblossom was very. seldom at, home; he gathered incidentally that the Captain dissappeared from time to time, rather mysteriously; and that his manner was changed towards his devoted wife. She, poor woman, made no complaint, on the subject; but the down-cast look, the half-suppressed sigh, the ill-concealed uneasiness when she referred to her husband's absences told the old sad story of neglect and faithlessness plainer than words could speak, Dick was less startled, therefore, 'than he otherwise might have been at receiving from his cousin, one day, a few blotted, incoherent lines, urging him to come to her at once as a terrible grief had befallen her, Without a moment's delay he hastened to' her side, and learnt that what he had foreseen had happened, and that his cousin's husband had deserted her. As he gaged sorrowfully upon her, seeking jn vain for 'words in which to convey, however feebly, his heartfelt sympaithy and devotion. Dick could not help being forcibly, struck by the peculiar villainy 'of the man who had thus wronged her. Poor Mrs Mayblossomn was attired'in a' bewitching teagown of some soft, creamy white material, decked with lace and bright coloured riblbon, and fitting admirably to her graceful form. Her abundant tresses, of aulburn hair fell in wild disorder about her fair neck and shoulders, her blue eyes, mois a with tears, loomed large and bright,' like l'nrs throuoh an evening mist, and her whole attitude Ietokened th:, most, pathetic, grief jud desp--. Dick w'a seized with an access of furious I icim .tiQou at this moving example of Captain Mayblossom's infamy,,and he rose abruptly 1 from his seat with a fierce exclamation.. ] ' What is the matter, Dick ?' exclaimed; his cousin, looking up quickly. ' ' The matter ! That--that -scou6idrel ' gasped Dick, almost beside himself.: ' Hush, Dick! after all he is-he is my husband,' sighed Mrs Mayblossom, gently. 'Yes, but---=. Well; I will- see him, at all events,' said- Dick, endeavouring to con- 1 trol himself. '-He cannot realise the wrong he has done. Besides, he cannot rean,-.-' ' No, Dick,' interposed his cousin, speaking. 1 in a low tone, but with clearness and decision. ' Do not go to him. I forbid it. After this,'she added, holding up the cruel letter her husband had written to her, 'he is? dead to me. But there, Dick, let us, not speak of him ! Only. promise, upon your word of hionour,'in case you should ever meet him, not to lay a fingerr upon him--for my sake!' 'He desernes to be shot,' growled' Dick, between his clenched teeth. : ' The greatest kindhess you can do to me, and my child is to avoid anything that may . lead to scandal. Will you promise, Dick, not to seek my husband !' said Mrs Mayblossom, appealingly. 'Of course, if you insist,' said:Dick, unable as usual, to resist her pleading glance. ' But -hut, what is to be .done ? 'For me and my darling little one, you mean l' Oh! If it were only I alone-if 'it were only I alone !' exclaimed Mrs Mayblos som, with a gesture of despair. 'There is the child, as yog say,' said Dick, gravely, rendered uneasy by, his cousin's ominous exclamation. For her sake, not to mention your own, we must think about.the future. In the first place, do yon intend to apply for a divorce ? ' For my child's sake, no r said Mrs May blossom, quietly, but emphatically. I have fully decided that, Dick.' Somehow this decision grated upon Dick's nerves; but he was too honestly affected about his cousin at the moment to spare a thought about himself. ' How do you propose to live T he next asked. ' What will dear uncle say, when he hears I' demanded little Mrs Mayblossom! abruptly, She looked at Dick so eagerly as she asked the question, that it went to his heart to crush the dawning hope which her glance expressed. But, knowing his father as-well as he did. Dick felt constrained to answer bluntly that even her present distress would" not purchase the old man's forgiveness. 'Poor little me 1.I feared it would-be so,' murmured the unlucky girl, applying her handkerchief to her. eyes. Ho'wever,' she added,'ihriskly, ' I- must not give way, -but remember my child I have made up my mind what to do, Dick.. Five. years ago, when poor dear papa died, 1 left some friends. behind me in Australia, when.I came over to live with uncle Job. Some- of these will, perhaps, put me in the way of earning my own living, if I return among them' ' What ! leave Englanid, Ada !' cried Dick, with a thrill of dismay. ' Yes, Dick.; it will. be.better for. many. reasons,' said Mrs Mayblossom, glancing for a mom'ent at Dick's pained expression, and thenfifxing her - gaze abstractedly, 'upon: the point of her little red morocco.,shoe, which peeped from heneath" her-diresÂ£ ' Besides,' she added, after rather an awkward pause, ' I have no particular reason to feel attached to the old country.', , . 'You will leave- one behind . you, Ada, who ---,' began Dibk,,witli flaming cheeks. 'You are aliways good, mnd kind, and noble, and generous,' interposed Mrs May blossom; hastily,; and I never, no, never ! Dick, shall forget all ..yor goodness. . But my mind is made up, Dickf-?quite madejip; and the only question is, how I am to get the money to carry outmy plans.' ' Money,' murmured Dick, -somewhat, so bered by the introduction of this prqgaio topic_ . . ? - 'Of course. I cannot go without money. SThere will be the passage topay anon tfit for me and pet; and, of course, I. should be un happy if I went without paying myj personal debts, and I should require to have some thing.in-my purse when I land over there, I shouldh't I; Dick Vsaid the practical little lady,'with great aimation, " ' I suppose so,' said Dick, rather faintly.

Mrs Mayhlossom began to checkoff, upon erdslender fingers, a numlber of items which soon reached a very us bstantial- total. Dick? was. considerably staggered- at the amount, and ruefully confessed that it* was far beyond his modest means. The conve;rsation thiereupon took ant, ex tremely prosaic and: practical turn, ..which renders unnecessary a detailed report of it.
