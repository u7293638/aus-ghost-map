Ho. has acc'omiilislied a success. scarcely exceeded by ', tlio London' 'Comedy .. Company, and ho bids fair to creatio a permaiieht taste amongst Mel-' .bourne audidh'ces for polite comedies and society ? .ym^a, \ymuu comume' so .. jnucn time .as nx jonco* refined and ; interesting. On Satu'r-^ day.:h]ght. h'e produced !Mr. ; F. C. Uur-i 'nivnd's .drama of The Turn of ? the.' Tide, which' '- has met with ' great :popu larity in the old country. It was placed ? upon, the stage with very complete accoesories.. ? ;Tho scenery, by Mr. Grist, was extremely offee-' tivp and realistic. Tho old chateau '. of Ker. 'saint oxhibitod a delightful landscapo in. Brit jtdny. Tlio grotto and caves of Morgano\ : afforded oxcollent scope for. tho skill of 'the (?. scene painter and mechanist. The scone' is V. highly sensational one after the stylo of the Colleen Bawn, but the goncral ?'surround-'-' ings are different, and tho scene1 as startlingly ciTective. The rising of the; water in tho cavo was particularly Well' managed, and the rescue of tho hero and the .young girl, who has just declared her love for 'the stranger, drew down repeated plaudits' ;froni the audience, which wcro duly recog nised by Mr.' Grist, who appeared before the footlights in response to a call, aud bowed hi.f acknowledgments. ? Several interiors, tlie ves tibule at tho opera hoiiso, and the scene iu 1 Switzerland, a mountain village near Intcr laehen, all reflected tho utmost credit upon all 'concerned in their preparation and arrange ment. Tho pieco is somewhat emotional. It bos a story of. great interest, which becomes quito intenso towards the close, the .denouement being all the more pleasing that it io unexpcctcd.; It drags somewhat iu the opening bcoucs, but no sooner has tho moral or rather the motive of tho piece become apparent, than the action increascu in rapidity, and each scene developes somo new and marked phase in the career of tho characters that itand out tho.moro prominently. The plot may be briefly described .is follows :— The piece treats with the. histories of two characters. Philip Earnsdiffe, a young author of celebritv and Marguerite Aahoton, the da\i'hter of an English _ gentleman, whose feeblo health neces sitated Jus lengthy residence in Brittany The ?foiiner, who was tho heir to tho fortunes of a wealthy undo, was inveigled into a marritvc with a Lady Clara Ttmplemore.
