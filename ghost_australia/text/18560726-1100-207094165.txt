LINDLEY MURRAY. To the Editor of the Times. Sir—Although I may lay myself open to the indig nation, not only of Government officers, but of some of our Legislative rulers, I must raise my small voice in favour of Lindley Murray and his Grammar. Allow me to quote a portion of the Immigration Agent's Report published in this week's Gazette ;—. "There is no doubt still considerable dulnessin busi ness generally, and that the fanners have not yet re covered from the deficient harvest of 1854, but there is every reason to believe that the dulness in trmd* it steadily improving." My bones absolutely ache when I think of the caning which the above sentence would have produced from my schoolmaster. It would not have been a simple page commencing "as in presenti," but a downright thrashing, accompanied by the contempt of the school boys, and the study of my father's legacy to the British nation. 1 am. Sir, THE GHOST OF THE SOX OF UHDLEY MUKRAY.
