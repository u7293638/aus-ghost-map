After our everjulay'.s f work, you may be sure we were tired enough ; but we were J cveiy night disturbed in our rest by the eliiik, clink, clink \ of a pick, about fifty yards from our canvas home. This f cqnfounded noise always commenced at midnight, and did ) not eeasc until the break of day. One night we were \ determined to see who it was ; so we sallied forth in the r bright moonlight, and saw a figure in a eoarse red flannel ) shirt, high boots, and slouehed hat, hard at work by an \ old claim which'had been deserted for many years. I was / chosen spokesman, to expostulate with this noisy digger; f but when I was within twenty yards of him, I stood still, . k transfixed with, horror,— for the wearer of the digger's ( clothes was nodiiiiiu/ eiaii, hut asltelotoii !" f " Ilnele Ned 1 " we aU'cried, " how fearful."
