CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOUR. TnE Newcastle District Christian Endeavour Union hold their first quarterly rally for the year on Thursday night, in the Baptist Church, Piattsburg. There was a large attendance of endeavourers from all parts of the district, and at the roll-call 15 societies stood and responded to their names. The first part of the meeting was devoted to a praise service, which was led by Rev. Chas. Whyte, ex-president. The Rev. R. M. Bowles ,then took the chair, and after sing ing and prayer, spoke a few words upon the subject of the Church. Rev. W. WALL, of Hamilton, gave an address on " The New Testament Conception of the Church." He said we have no hard or rigid definition of the Church, we have only a fundamental description. The Church is not a promiscuous gathering, it is not an association or body to which anybody can belong; it is an assembling together of people who have a character--a peoplewho have been called out of the world. There is a very close relationship between Christ and His.Church, and there the individual men tion are closely related to one another. Wherever youhave a gathering of HolyGhost filled people there you have the true Church of Christ. Rev. F. J. Moneues, of Stockton, gave an address on "My duty as a member of the Church." He said we must first realise the position, the nearness, and dearness of Christ. Just in proportion as we love Christ, shall we do our duty and be found faithful in the Church. We must find out what our work is, and when we have found it, set to work in right earnest to do it. We are divided into companies, but we ere all fighting for one King, and we should always have before us that one object. We also have a duty to the world, and however we shirk it now we cannot shirk it on the judg ment day. During the evening solos were very nicely rendered by Mr. Arthur Morrow, Mies 8. Davies, and Mr. Harvey. After having spent a very profitable and happy time, the Mizpsh benediction was repeated.
