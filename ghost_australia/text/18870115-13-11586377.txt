CU RUE NX LITERATURE. An autobiography has been facetiously defined as what a biography ought to be It honestly and simply executed, it is by far the best kind of memoir, being that account of himself by which every man íabestillus trated The SIdefies of My Life by the late Admiral Hobart Pasha (Longmans and Co ), has every essential of a good book It is the record of the life of an adventurous seaman told with admirable force, simplicity, and truthfulness, with that kind of panic which seems to belong especially to a sailor a book Hobart Pasha, who in his character and career bore considerable resemblance to that other great naval hero Lord Cochrane, was unfortunate in being born in a peaceful age, though he managed to crowd a good deal of fighting into his life The son of "respectable parents' in

his future professional troubles well as of his professional eminence After many adventures in foreign service including an amusing love experience at Buenos Ayres (where the whole ship's crew, captain in eluded, fell deeply in love and slave hunting on the coast of Brazil, the young Hobart was appointed, for good service, an officer on board the Queen's yacht Here on one occasion he nearly

From these preliminary exercises, which want nothing that the literary art can give them, the reader is led up to a mass of evidence of various degrees and kinds of importance and strangeness, which is in striking contrast to the calm philosophic in an 1 dispassionate tone of the preface in the synopsis the apparitions and phenomena are arranged according to a show of order and their various

refused to them we must be convinced that these phenomena of any of them are supernatural or extra natural and out of the way of science. but that is precisely the question in which the Psychical Society has failed to satisfy the public So for as the evidence goes it amounts to nothing but this-supposing that all the witnesses to the phenomena were not only trustworthy but capable that is to say that they do not lie and have exhausted all the resources of science that certain things were seen heard or done contrary to the usual experience of mankind But we protest that this is by no means enough and indeed a great deal too little seeing that one of the grounds on which our attention to this supposed extra natural power or influence is sought is that it may make probable much of the content of religious tradition Clearly it this is to be a matter of religion we are bound to inquire with special severity into not only the truth of the phenomena but into the credibility of the witnesses It is not enough to say that A and B who vouch for having, seen the up iantionsofCnndD are highly) respectable per sons who would scorn to deceive Iheargu ment of science comes in here with

men of intellect yielding" to such a childish superstition as that which forms the basis of this large and ponderous volume Colo tal France by Captain C L Norman (W li Allen and Co.) is a praiseworthy

the revival of the scheme of Colbert under Louis MV France at one time indeed had a larger purely colonial dominion than England and the process by which it has crumbled away in the shock of contest with her old rival is one of the most interesting topics which the Ins torian could have Captain Norman does not pretend to any such character He is a careless writer and a very poor hand at Natures Yet he has given us a valuable book which may be studied with advantage by all our colonial readers There are two or three striking things about the history of the French colonies The first is that
