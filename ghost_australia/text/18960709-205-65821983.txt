Burial in the Air. Under the influence of the mission aries the Indians of Montana are fast abandoning their old custom of placing their dead on platforms, or hanging them, wrapped in blankets, to the limbs of the big cottonwood trees which grow along the streams; but now and then the hunter or cowboy still finds one of their old platform cemeteries, or, it may be, only a tomb standing in the solitude of the vast, grassy plains. The original object of this odd way of disposing of corpses was undoubtedly to protect them from the wolves, which would speedily dig up any grave'such as the Indians could make without picks and shovels. In course of time the rude platform would be up turned by decay' and the winds, but the Crow or Black-i foot kinsmen of the deceased had done their duty in the way of sepulture as well as they could and were not re soonsible for such accidents. After all, the main thing was to satisfy the ghost of the departed so that he would go at Ace to the happy hunting grounds, content with the honors paid to his re mains, and not hang about to haunt his relatives.- ,
