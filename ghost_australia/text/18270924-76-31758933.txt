AN unusual sensation was momentarily excited on on Tuesday night in the House of Commons, upon the Speaker's pronouncing in a marked tone the name of " Lord Castlereagh,' during the presentation of pe- titions. All eyes were turned within the House to the quarter to which the Speaker directed their attention, and strangers in the gallery endeavoured, with eager curiosity, to catch a glance. 'The last time that name was pronounced from the chair, it was to call up the leading Minister from the Treasury Bench, and some members and strangers stared on this occasion, as if they expected to see his ghost. Their attention was, however, gratified by the appearance of his nephew, who bears his name; and who made a respectable maid- en speech in presenting a Catholic petition. BELOW the bar, under the gallery of the House of Commons, on Thursday night, there were many Peers; amongst them the Earl of Harrowby, the Marquis of Lansdown, Lord Clanricarde (Mr.. Canning's .son-in law), &c..; and in the side, or Members' Galleries, for the want of adequate accommodation below the bar, were the Marquis of Queensbury, Lord Kensington, &c.; The roof of the House of Commons was be- sieged, in the anxiety to hear Mr. Secretary Canning; there were several ladies accommodated with chairs there--but they could only hear through the ventilators; the sight of the Commoners being forbidden the fair. The Right Hon. Gentleman looked as well as usual on Thursday; but he delivered his speech (which was a much shorter one than had been anticipated), in the most cautious manner, never suddenly elevating his tones, nor indulging in any oratorical display that might have required extra energy of manner and action ; and yet the prespiration on his face was tolerably visible, and. afforded proof of the weakness resulting from his re- cent serious indisposition.
