W R E C K OF T H E T A R A R U A , WE8I1EYAK MEMORIAL SERVICES. Manorial services were heldun Sunday, May 8, ic all tha metropolitan Wesleyan Churches ia connection with the recent disaster ou the New Zealand coast, the ill-fated Tararua having amongst her passengers several prominent minis - terialj a&4 lay members of tbe Wesleyan denomination who were coming from Kew Zealand to attend tbe General Conference to be held ia Adelaide this week. Below , are reports of tha services at the more prominent churches. > PIRIK- STBBBT CHURCH. There were very large congregations at both morning' and evening service in this church, which was appropriately draped with black. Ia the morning, the Bev. J- B. Stephenson performed the opening ministrations, and while engaged ia prayer made special allusion to the loss sustained by the Church in the death of its members who were on hoard the Tararua. The organist, Mr. Ohinner, then played the " Dead March in Saul," and after thelessons had been read the Bev. J. Watsford, President of tbe General Conference, ascended the pulpit and '.founded an impressive sermon upon the following text—"Let your loins be girt about and your lights burning, and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord when He will return from the wedding, that when % cometh and knocketh they may opeti unto Him immediately" (Luke xiL 35-6). The rev. preacher opened his sermon by directly applying his text and dwelling forcibly upon the certainly of death, tbe uncertainty of its time of coming, its sudden advent or Its lingering approach; impressed upon the congregation how great was the necessity for personal preparation. Sketching with brevity the circumstances of the wreck of the Tararua, with all the heartrending scenes that must have taken place on board, he pointed to it as an instance of how swiftly man is overtaken by death when death seems fer away; and proceeded to refer more particularly to those among the drowned who were intimately connected with the "Wesleyan Church. The list of the perished contained the names of two laymen on their way to attend the General Conference, and although he hadnto personal knowledge of them they were andonbtedly, from the position they had been elected to, faithful men. The Bev. J. B. Richardson, the President of the New Zealand Conference was a minuter of great usefulness'and fidelity of character, and the Bev. 3. Armitage was another member of the same Conference of some seven years' standing, and held the position oC editor of the New Zealand Wesleyan. With these brethren he had but a small personal acquaintance, and could not refer to them mora fully as he could to the Bev. Joseph Waterhouse, with whom he had had a long and intimate friendship. The preacher then sketched his life, a snort history of which we subjoin .-— Joseph Waterhouse was born at Halifax, Yorkshire, in February 1828. At a youth he was thoughtful and well-behaved. At the age oE fourteen he was one of six brothers who wfth their .beloved mother and two sisters stood around the dying bed of the 'Rev. John Waterhonse, and < saw liis triumph in death. That death led to his passing from death unto life. Beferriisg to it four years after, in a letter written from Hindley-street, Adelaide, he says —"The 30th March passed before my memory. Oh what a sermon did our father then preach! Surely We that saw him die will have much ta give an' accountof. * Remember how I die/exclaimed the dying Christian. 'Remember in whose favour 1 die.

His own words, as given in a letter addressed, to his sister, are—"I arrived here last qvening. blgardless of tea l went tothe love £east, and there was deeply affected.

The Saturday afternoon when the wreck of the Tararua b&o;&me; known bis bereaved wife received a long letter from him, which proved the last he ever penned. Its dosing words are, " Pray for each child, one per day; your loving husband. Joseph Waterhouse." Like his father, he passed away in the 53rd year of his age and the 33rd of Jus ministry, leavisg a family of seven children. The preacher concluded his sermon with an earnest appeal to the congregation to aak that the Divine solace might he accorded to tbe bereaved families, and to pray at all times for those who travelled by the sea. In the evening the Bev. D. O'Donnell preached from the text 8t John xiii. 7— "Jesusanswered and said onto him, 'WhatI da thou knowest not, but thoa shalt know hereafter." Upon this text a sermon was based, in which the rev. preacher pointed oat how the Divine wisdom was displayed in fatuity being veiled, for, as be said, this mystery eneocrsfed tbe growth of perfect manhood, and while if we conld bnt see the tutors we would sot dare to face the calamities that lay before
