The Gift of the Holy Ghost. ? 11\. G. Pearse. lhis is the one thing, the only thing we want — the gift of the Holy Ghost. Without Him nothing is ours — with Him we have all. He is come to put us in possession of all that the love of God hath provided, of all that the life and death of J esus hath accomplished. He and He alone can impart to us the life of God. It is a new nature, a new being that we need. Theories, feelings, tears, agonies, beliefs — what are these if Christ saith ye must be born again . All that we' can possibly need is ours in the gift of the Holy Ghost. He creates the consciousness of sin ; the true repentance is ours only when He imparts His grace. He brings the mani festations of Christ as our Saviour, so that we just rest in Him with assured confidence that He loved us, and gave Himself for us. He brings the gracious sense of God's love to us so that we look up and cry Abba, Father, He becomes the earnest of an inheritance, the pledge and foretaste of heaven. Now begin to make it your' prayer, ' O God, give me Thy Holy Spirit for J esus Christ's sake.' Go on making it your prayer — morning, noon and night. If you can do nothing else you can do this. Every thing shall be yours in this gift — light, peace, joy, love, triumph, all are ours only in the Holy Ghost. Pledge your self to this prayer. ? Let it greet the dawn, let it close the day. O God, give j me Thy Holy Spirit for J esus Christ's sake.
