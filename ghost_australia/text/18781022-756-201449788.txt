WONDERFUL ESCAPE. A correspondent of the Ballarat Star records the wonderful escape from death of a little girl, about seven years of age, named Bessy, the daughter of Mr Thomas Watkin- son, after f ailing down the old Tom and Jerry shaft, sunk upon an almost perpen dicular underlie to the depth of 100 feet. It appears that the younger members of Mr W.'s f amity have a saying that if they walk round the shaft nine times, a ghost will appear, and on this occasion, having performed the fifth circle, little Bessy tottered, and fell into its open mouth. Her sister Lily, about nine years old,- clutched hold of her dress, but was too weak to re tain her hold for more than a few seconds, and the poor child went head foremost down the shaft. The children ran home crying, and told their mother, and she, never ex pecting to see her child alive again, sent off in the right direction for assistance. Soon the father and uncle of the child, accom panied by Mr C. Day, appeax-ed upon the scene, and a rope having been brought into requisition the father descended the shaft, and great was his thankfulness to discover that some houghs thrown in by boys ob structed its descent, and formed a temporary stage about fifty feet below the surface, and upon these, save fi'om the severe fright and a few comparatively slight bruises, the little gix'l lay uninjured. "What makes the escape the more providential is that the obstruction upon which she rested would not bear tbe weight of her father, and . both had to be hauled up to the surface together.
