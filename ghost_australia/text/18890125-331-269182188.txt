Cir.UTEn xrx.—We Take a View of tick l*or reven with the mile raged with un common violouco ; it then broke, and tliw brought. «s into the first week of August. The wind fell in the night, and I was awakened l.y the silence, which ycra will not think strange if you cconider how n-vtT were my ears to the fierce seething and strong tallowing of the blast. I lay listening, lielioving that it Jmd only veered, and that it would conic or* again in gusts and g\mB ;• b«t tlie stillness continued, in*d there wu,* no •oixud -whatever saving* the nefeos of the my v?lwch broke upon the air like Mow answers «*m batteries near and distan?,- half whose crnnsms have been Silenced. I slept a^ain, and when T aw<ke it was | half-post nine o'clock m the morn mg-. The Frenchman was snoring' lustily. T’ went on deck before entering* rbe ctx>k-hot**c, and had lik^ to have been blbided by thea.*»Conish biir brilliance of the aur.fthine upon ^he ice and snow. All the wind- was gone. The air was exquisitely frosty and sharp. Hut there wa? a heavy sound coming from* the sea which* gave inc to expect the sight cn a strong swell. The sky was » clear blue, and there was iw> cloud on as mush of its face as showed lietwfxt the brows of the slopes. The schooner wihii most woMerfal picture of drooping icw-les. A more beautiful and* radiant sightycu could notjfigurc*. From every rope, from the yards forward, from the rails, from whatever water could run hi a stream, bung glorious ice-pcndants of prismatic splendour. No*snow had fallen iv frost the surfaces, and every pendant was as pure and polished as cut-glass and reflected rv hundred brilliant colours. The water hurled over und on the schooner had frozen upon the masts, und dock*. and ns this. ice, like the the p<*tidnnte, was very sparklingly* bright, it guvu back all the lines of the sunbeam,* so that, stepping from; the darkness of the cabin into tins effulgent scene, you might easily have persuaded yourself that*l>efore you stood the fabric of a ship fashioned out of a rainbow. My attention, however, was quickly with - drawn from this shining spt*ctaole by the appeamucc of the starboard cliff over against our qiiratcr. The whole shoulder of it had broken away, and I could just catch a view of the horizon of the sea from the deck by Btiutvhlng my figure. The right of the ocean showed me that the breakage had been prwligious, for to have come to that prospect beforo, I should have had to climb hi the height of the main lower masthead.- No other marked or noteworthy change did I detect from tin* deck ; but on stepping to the lar Ixwutl side to peer over I spied a split in the ico that readied from the very margin of the ravine, I mean to that end of it where it terminated in a cliff, to pass the bows of the Pehooner by at least four times her own length, b I returned to the cook-room and went about the old business of lighting the fire and preparing the breakfast—this job, by au understanding between the Frenchman and me, fulling to him who was fir>t out of bed— and in ulsMit twenty minutes Tas**anl arrived. ‘ The* wind is gone/ said lie. * Ich,’ I replied, ‘ it is a bright, still morn ing. I, have been on deck. Tliere has been agreat full of ice close to.’ * Does it block us ?* 4 No, on the contrary, it clears the way tg th* sea:, the ocean is now visible from" tit* deck. Not that it mentis our case,’ I added. * But tliere is a great rent in the ice that puts a fancy* into my head ; I'll speak of it later after a closer look.* I he breakfast was ready, and we fell to in a hurry, tlie Frenchman gobbling like a hog in his eagerness to make au cud. When we were finished he wrapiuxl himself up in thiee or four coats and cloaks, warming the uuder ones before folding them nlxmt him, und completing Ins preparations for the excursion by swallowing half a pint of raw bnuidv. I bade him arm himself with a short- headed spear to save his neck ; aud thus equipped we went on deck. He stood stock-still until his eyes shut on emerging througli tlie hatch, crying out until a numluT of French oaths that he had been struck blind. This I did not believe, tliongh I readily supposed that the glare made his eye balls smart so as to cause him a gwd deal uf agony. Judged, all along I had been sur prises i that lie nhouhl have found Ills sight so easily after haring sat in blindness for forty-eight years, and it was not wonderful that tin* amazing brilliance on deck, smiting liis right on a sudden, should have caused him to cry out as if he had lost the use of his eyes for ever. I umited patiently, und in about ten minutes he was able to look about him, and then it was not long ln*fore hecould see with out pain. He st<nhl a minute gazing at the glories upon the rigging, and in that piercing light T noticed the unwholesome colour of Ids face. Ills cap hid the scar, and nothing of his countenance was to be seen but the checks, eye**, and nose; he was much more wrinkles! than I had supposed, and znctliought the spirit of cruelty lay visible in every line. ! had never seen cvex so full of cunning aud treachery—so expressive, I should say, of these qualities, yet they were no bigger than mere punctures. I was sensible of a momen tary fear of the nun—not, let me say, an emotion of cowardice, but a sort of mixture of alarm and awe, such as a ghost might inspire., This I put down to the searching light in which I watched him for a moment or two, an irradiation subtle enough to give the sharpest form to expression, to exquisitely define every meaning that was dis tinguishable in liis graveyard physiognomy. I left him to stare and judge for himself of the posture in which the long hard gale had put the schooner, aud stepped over to the two Unties. They were shrouded in ice from head to foot, as though they had each man been packed in a glis* case cunningly wrought to their shapes. Their faces were hidden by the crystal uutsks. Tnssurd joined me. * Small chance for your friends now,’ said I, * even if you were agreeable to my propo sal to attempt to revive them/ 4 Si)!’ cried he, touching the body of the mate with his foot ; ‘ and this Is the end of the irresistible Trenttmove ! for what con quests has IX*ath robbed him so bravely 1" .Set*, the colours shine in him like fifty kinds of ribbands. Poor follow ! he could not curl Ins moustaehios now, though the loveliest oses in .Europe won* fixed in passionate ndmiratiou on him. He’ll never.si it another throat, nor hiccup Petrarch over a goblet nor remonstrate with mo ou my humanity. Shall we toss the bodies over tlie ride ?* * They are your friends/ said I; * do as you please/ * But we mast empty their pockets first. Business before sentiment, Mr. Rodney/ Ho stirred the figure again with his foot. 1 Well, presently/ said he, * this armour will want tlie hatchet. Now, my friend, to view the work of the gale/ Tlie increased heel of the ship brought the larboard fore-channel low, and we stepped without difficulty from it on tlie ice. The rent or fissure that I have before spoken of went very deep ; it was nearly two feet wide in places, but, though the light poured brilliantly upon it, I could see no bottom. 4 If onlv such another split its this would happen Pother side/ said the Frenchman, 4 I believe this block would go adrift/ 4 Well/ said I, after musing a little whilst I ran my eye over^the hollows, 4 I’ll tell you what was in my mind just now. There is a great quantity of gunpowder in the hold ; ten or a dozen barrels. By dropping large parcels of it into the crevices on the right there, and firing it with slow-matches—’ He interrupted me with a cry : 4 By St. Puul, you have it 1 What crevices have We wulkod briskly round the vessel, and all about her beam und starboard quarter I found, in ndtlition to the seams I hud before noticed, many great cracks and fissures, caused no doubt by tlie fall of the shoulder of tlie slope. I pushed oil further yet, going down the ravine, ns I have called it, until I crime to the edge; and here I looked down from a; height of some twelve or fourteen foot—mi gtvatly luid the ice sunk or been j changed by the weather—upon the oceun. I called to Tbssard, Ho approached warily. I .believed he feared I might be tempted to give Hm a friendly shovo over the edge. ‘ Obscryo this hollow/ said I; * the split fiiyre jriiiv (lriwn to th&water;, and you may UfV<' it thut flic block. is wholly disconnected on fhfcfcsido. Now look xrf tho faco1 of the ice/ wiid I, ^pointing to f)w> starboard or TTght-lrrml side j * tilnt crock goes as far a.5? the vessels' cjuurtor, and 1 the ■weakness |«j carried on f<v past the Iowa by the other rent.-'. Mr. jassard, if we could burst, this IkkI v of iCi» \ry an explosion from it* moor lnjrs ahead of the bowsprit, where it is all too compact, thiif eriwlle with the schooner in it will go free of the parent body/ He answered promptly. ‘Yes; it is the^no amlonly plan. That <-ni/-k to starioad i-like telling us wlmt to do*. Ife is well you camo hm*. \U* should not have seen it from the toy. This valley run? steep.

I resp/yidcd with one of hip’jwn shrugs, and 'aid, ' Nothing Is certain. \Vl> have one of tsro court.* to cheese—to venture this launch, or stay till the ice breaks up, and tnl'o our ciamcc of floating-, or of beinir I smashed.’ i 4 Tou aro right/ he exclaimed, ‘ Here 19 an opportunity. If we wait,* berga .may gather al>out thw point and buildhw in. 4 As to this island dissolving, we are .yft to know which way *tis heading. Suppose it should he travelling- south, hoy V He struck the ice witli his spent/and wo toiled up the" slippery rucks with difficulty to the ship. Me walked past the bows to tho distance of the ve*~el\s length.- Here were numy deep holes and cruets, and, as if wo were to be taught how these, eamo about, even whilst we were viewing them, a» ear- splitting crash of nouie happened within t wenty fathoms of us, a rock many tons in weight rolledover, and left a black -*xulf .behind it. 0 T\\\\*} Frenchman* started, muttered, and crowed himself. 1 Jloly VirginV, he cri*d, rolling his eyes. ‘Let .us return to tho schooner. Me shall be swallowed.up here.’ I own I was not a little terrified myself by the sudden loud blast and the thunder of- tho uprooted* rock, and the sight of the- Hugo black rent;, but I meant to view the seeno from the top, find to con rider how best te dis jHise of the ]>o\vder in tlie cracks, and said, * 1 here is nothing to be done ou board; skulking below will not deliver us or preserve the treasure.'- Here are several fissures big enough to receive barrels o£ guupower, See, Mr. Tassard, - as they sfand they cover the whole width of the hollow/ Audi proceeded to give him. my. ideas as to lowering, fixing - the barrels, anil the like. Ho nodded his head, and- &akl;, ‘ YeV, yery gisid; ves, ^ it will do,’ and &o; on but wajj too soared in his heart, I believe, to see my fu1! nuaniug. He was perpetually moving, as if he feared the ioe would split under his feet, and his eyes tra veiled-over tho face of the rocks with every mamlesfatkm bf.ahxrm in their expression.-- I wondered; how. sopoor a creature should over have laid! tjtoxnkch enough to serve as a pirate; • lio'.clbujit *iiis spirit liud been enfeebled by_hU- loug sleep; but ^ then it is also true that the greatest bullies and most bloodthirsty, n*gue.s jirovo tlieni^lvcs despicable curs under conditions which nuko no demand upon their temper or their !u»t for plunder/ He would have rettirned to the ship had I encouraged him, but on seeing me start to climb to the brow ho followed. - The prospect disappointed me. I had ex pooled v to witness a variety of surprising changes,* but south ward the scene win scarce altered, It wa> a wonderfully fair morning, the sky-char from sea-line to sea-line, mid of a very. V'dY; blue, the ocean of a like hue, - with a - high swell running, that was a majestic undulation .even from the height at wliieh I surveyed-it. The sun stood over the ice in the north-east, and the dazzle kept me weeping, so, intolerable wus the effulgence. Half of the delicate architecture that had enriched the riojxs and surfaces that way was swept down, and icu lay piled in places to an elevation of many feet, where Ik.*fore it had been fiat or hollow. Ifowewr, there was no question but that tho gale had played havoc with the north ex tremity of the island. I eotinted no less than twenty bergs floating of the main, audit was quite likely the sea was crowded beyond, though lay sight could not travel so far." However, when I came to look close, and to recollect the features of the shore a* they snowee when i iu>l uuum. l found . vital changes near at hand. \\\ ftete uij i,,v«n had beett the ice hud givui way and left.a gap half a mile broad and a hundred feet deep, The fall on tho schooner's starboard cipalter was very heavy, ami the ice was split in all directions; ami in parts Was ?o loose that a point of elilf hard upon the sea rocked with the swell. AVlien Tassanl came to a. stand he looked alfoutliim nortii and south, shading his eves with hi.s baud, and then sweaviug very savagely in French, he cried out in English, freely employing oaths ashesixike— • Why, here’s as much ioc as there was before X fell asleep 1 See yonder 1’ pointing to the south. * It dies out in tho distauce. If it does not join the pole there, may. tho devil rise Ixrforo me as I -peak. Thunder and furv ! I had hoped to see it shrivelled to an. ordinary berg !* • M’hat! in a week'/ cried I, as if I be lievcd his stupor had not lasted longer. He returned no answer, and gaped about him full of consternation and passion.. * And are we to wait for o ir deliver.mco till this continent bre;iks up!’ he bawled. 4 The day of judgment will b_*a thmg..of tho past by that time. Travelling nortii ! ’stlwith he roared, his mouth full of. the ex pletives of his day, French and English* • Whu but a madman could suppose that this ice is not as fixed as the antarctic circle to which it is moored l Why, six months go it was no bigger than it is now !’ And he sent a furious, terrified gaze into the white soli tudes vanishing iu azure faintness in the south-west. It was not a thing to reason upon. I was as much disappointed as he by trilling changes the gale had made, and my heart.felt very heavy at the sight of tho great field di-ap pearing in the south. The bergs in the north signified little. It is true they indi cated demolition, but deni3Hti0u.su slow as to be worthless to us. It was not to be ques tioned that the island was proceeding north, but at wlmt rate ? Here, perhaps, might Ik* a frozen crescent of forty or fifty leagues; and at wlmt speed, appreciable enough to he of tho least cuusequence to our calculations, should, such a body travel ? I looked at the Frenchman., ‘ This must decide us !’ .-aid I. * MTe must fix on one of two courses—endeavour to lauuch the ship by blowing up the ice, or turn to aud rig up the best amuigmeut wo cun contrive and put to sea/ * Yes/ he answered, scowling as he ilarted. his enraged eyes over the ice. ‘ Better set a slow-match in the magazine and drink our selves senseless, and so. blow ourselves to hell, thau linger here in the liopo that thia continent wall dissolve and release us. Where’s Mendoza’s body :* I stared about me.niul then pointing to.tho huge gap the ice bad mule, answered, / It was there. M’iicre it is now t know not/ He shrugged his shouldero, took another view of the ic»? and tlio wt-an, and then,cried, impatiently, * Let us return! the powder barrels miLst have the first ehuuce/ And ho made fur the seho*)ner, savagely striking tho ice with his spear and grnvliug curses to himself as he ploughed an i climbed and jumped, his way aluug. vTO BK COST!’•CEO.)
