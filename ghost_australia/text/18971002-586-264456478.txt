heAlthy f»iiga», and"! Woal<l litrongiy '^v emphvise the necessity of taking as liitie Ineeage as possible. The firit trip I sh*il describe is one I took a few months a so thiougli (Jippn- I«nd. in company with an old triend, an En^lisb sea captain. We started from Melbourne at 7.50 a.m., and within an hour were passing through unfamiliar, varied and interesting country. At Berwick th~™ was a sense of comf<>rt and plenty in the welicnliiratei p*ddocks and herds of lazy— looking cattle, th«t scarcely deigned to heed the shriek nf the advancing train ; bat* a f-w miles on, the patches of cnlli T»tion became farther and farther ap«rr f »nd. except in the close vicinity of the railway stations, there are only occasional homesteads. At Bonyip one cliches a glimpse of the K»o-wee-rup Swamp, through the dismal thicket of ti-tree. Then tbe country for miles is covered with majestic fore«t trees, str-tching their protecting branches of dull green over a dense undergrowth of ferns, with their graceful, feathery fronds ; giasa trees of every height, and creepers with brillitt"t clusters of purple and white and yellow ; and thes* ngain shelter an infinite variety of smaller plants and fl-iwers, that mi^ht 'empt * botanist to go no farther. At W»rr»gul a feeliofr of sadne-s creep* over on", and an undefined consciousness of the inevitable change called D^itti. A few miles back, forest giant", the growth of centuries, stood in silent grandeur, protecting the children of en?h season. th- trees have been rinaVd, nnd stand >ha ghosts of a paat ; their bleached and n <ked limbs conjuring up all sorts of weird, f*nrMgiic forms. Ai;ain we enter a living forest, and at Yarragon are on the burders of th»* Moe Swamp. After passing Trafalgar view of ilountg Biw Bin, Mueller, Erica, and twenty minute* later we have reached Moe, the first stage of our jonrney. After lunch I *et about finding horsey for I may stat« th»t on mv holiday tiips I t<ke my saddle with m", as I gen rally find it cheaper nnd more convenient to buy a horse as sooo a<< my route le&vea; the railway line, and sell it again at the last s?age. I can thus turn off the coach road wh<?n I will, linger at places of interest to m*-, aud start whenever it suits m« without waiting f«»i mail day®, etc. I wag not long in securing a sturdy little nitre, with a long, swinging trot, which I find the ^asi'St pace for rough country riding d*v after d*y. £ gave £4 for her, nnd sold her some days later for £2 15s. Mv companion, being a heavier uuti, was not easily suited, but we were told that a few mile* on the road to Willow, grove a farmer bad the very mount we wanted. We had arranged to go from Moe to WalhslU by coach ; but, as we bad left ourselves a margin nf a couple of days, we decided to stay at Willow, grove* that night, and vidit the Taoj.'l gold-fields. Mr William*, the proprietor of the Willowgrove Hotel, was in Moe, so we drove out with bim, and for one night partook of his hospitality and good cheer. The next morning we rode across to the old Tanjil townxhip, catching some glimpses of pretty river scenery en route. A track ba* b«>en cnt by tbe Mines Department from thiR point to Mt Baw Biw, about twenty miles distant, from which may lie obtained a magnificent view of the Gipp-lind Ltees and plains, as well as the de»sely- wood<-d arei of South Gippsland, along the Callign -c and Strezlrcki ranges. We visited a number of nuiiiti? claims, ^ " ^ ^ ^ ^ po atoes, and billy tea in a fnend's hnt, and got back to Willowgrove about 2 p.m. After a rest we were again in tVe saddle. Tne captain was anxions to see the Morwell Colliery, as he had been interested in the manufacture of briquettes in Germany, so we rode along the Latrobe Valley, through the rich alluvial flats of the Moe Swamp, and arrived at the Morwell Company's mine, on the northern bank of the Latrobe. My companion was surprised and delighted at tbe enormons extent of the coat deposit opened up by the company. Th« face of solid fuel, nearly 100ft in thickness, waa being quarried out. The manager was most courteous, and explained that tbe briquettes were formed by pressure only, without any binding material being used ; that a pltnt capable of turning out 100 tons per day had been erected—the present ou'put being 30 tons per day, and tbat over 1000 tons had already been pot on the market and commanded a price of 17a fid per ton. Between the colliery and the township we passed the eights of several bores put down by the Mining Department, in which ooal-bedg of 276ft tn thidciMSS bad been piereed at different levels down to 1000ft„ making altogether an aggregate thickness af orer iews,™lo\ ^befeSs otif 1 Mro'were'gr^ti with the roar of the stamp-hesd* from the Long Tnnnel battery. Lying in a deep gorge, between steep ranges, the township resembles a Swiss village, and its natural beanty is even enhanced by the various tramway*, which bring timber to the mines from t' e ndjacent hills, and l>y the flumesof th • race*. One lone, natrow st eet consti u*e* the prittcip»l th<»r nshfareof the township. We inspected tbe cmplete i«intnj7 plant of the " Long Tunn*l," which, accor<li' g to the able and v-nenble manager (Mr Ramwy Thomson), has yielded over one nnd a h*lf millions of miney to itB fortunate «h»re|w>!><ers. WttW ret'ret that our atav could not be prolonged, we made an early Htact next morning for Mt. Lookout, and, rising rapidly from the vhlley by a sideling cutting, we had a splendid view nf ihe eastern slopes of the Ba» Baw, on the west, and of the Great Divining Range and Mr. Useful away t«» the north-e«s*. A few hours' sm<rt ridine brought inc T<> the summit «'f the range dividing the Aberfeldy »nd Thornpa«n livets, and kuown as Mt Lookmr, where a fine hotel and store h«s b"en erected by a*) entfrfirising trude^nian. We refreshed ourselves anil our i-t^ods, nnd enjoyed the ride down into the Thompson Vallev, and the exquisite vi»w of mountain sc j ne'y, changing at every step, bulb in form and color, «s the hazy pnrfde or the aitemoon gave {dace to the glorious 1 tint* of tunwe . and ti>e sound of the rushin? <>f the cle»r. spaikling w«ters <>f tnej.nda'i, a'd ihe ev--ni'g notes of " Imsh" completed the iiarinoov.

At Jamieson we sold our horse*, and took the c-ach to Mansfield. We crossed tlie Hoqna and Dclatite rivers, with their charming mountain and vallev scenery. As we approached Mansfield the country became more open and park-like. From Mansfield magnificent view* are obtained of tbe surrounding mountain-, bold, abrupt headlands and terraced hilts. Close by, to the east, the <• Buterv" risen from the plains, the " Haystack''and Blue Ranges lie to tbe north, and to the we-t a eaddle-back<-d eminence, upon which is situated two peaks, locally called the *' Paps," constitute a striking feature, while to tbe went rise Mt.

F'om Mansfield we travelled by train to Melbourne, passing through Bonnie Doon, Melton, Mo'esworth, and Ye*, all pleasantJy-»ituated townships. The undulating, rolling downs, which characterise tbe scenery around Doon. afford a striking contrast with the rueg^d outlines of tbe distant Strathb^gie Ranges.
