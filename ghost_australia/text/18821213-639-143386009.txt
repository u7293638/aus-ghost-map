LONG AGO. Sitting alone by the fireside, Watching the embers glow, A vision rises before me Of tbe happy long ago. I see myself a bilthesome boy, With heart so light and free, ? Who told my troubles great and small Beside a mother's knee. And rambling o'er a forest deep, Or in some loney dell, Apart from all the busy whirl Here's where I longed to dwell. Where I could see the flow'rs bloom, And tend them day by day, Could hear the birds' sweet melody, ?j And watch the brooklet play. The scene is changed : A vision drear Is now in memory. I can recall the very spot, E'en to the shady tree. The waters flowing calmly by, And rippling o'er tho stones, And her who sat beside that stream And sang in plaintive tones. Now I drew me near to listen To music soft and low, But sad the words which floated As they told of grief and woe. She sang of hopes now blighted, Of joys which might have been, Of hidden pain and sadness, Ah ! me ; a sad, sad scene. At last she rais'd her drooping head, And breath'd a lonely sigh. Oh, why she moaned ! must I now live When hopes and wishes die ? She gaz'd into the waters deep With look of grief and fear ; Then sank upon the mossy ground, And I drew slowly near. Sudden I start ; erect she stood, With hands now rais'd to Heaven, With look of dread upon her face, And pleads to be forgiven. And then, oh ! may I never hear Again that cry of doom ; She sank beneath the flowing stream ? Into a lonely tomb. With breathless terror gaze I now Into the waters deep ; But calm they ripple over one Who's closed her eyes in sleep. Her earthly paiu forgotten is, All grief and trials o'er. She has at last a resting-place, Whero naught shall vex her more. And as I muse and wonder If more I ought to say, A voice now speaks within mo, ' You too must pass away.' Now, alone I have been pond'ring Before the fire's glow, And visions rise before me there, As ghosts of long ago. Jules Yernon.
