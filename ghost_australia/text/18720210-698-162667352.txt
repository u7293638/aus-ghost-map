THE HORSE CIRCLE. CHARADE. | j-Owetmg lcebcrgB lift their heads m distant Arctic regions j bleak; j Man asserts dominion there e'en; but ah! I»« power is i ' .weak— | 'Weak as little infant prattling on the mother's ample ' knee; j There he sliows his puny power — there his truest strength we see. Ice in maefies, ice in mountains, tow'ring upwards to the fiky, j Sanone upon by Sol the glorious, blinding mortal s ieebie eye; Hurling him to darkened regions, shutting out the light of day, Weakening all his boasted glory, limiting his world-wide sway, ley realms for ever ghost-like, grim, unwelcome to the gaze: ,,s Jieakoe of dazzling greenish splendour, realms of biasing tinted rays. 'When the sun in all his glory shines upon the ice- fields white, Keep, poor mortal — keep him careful, lest for aye is lost his sight ! There my first holds boisterous revel, there 'tis eeeu eternal heaped, Lasting o'er that chilly region, where the ice hath vigil kept — Sept, aye kept a vigil, ages cannot tell its long ex tent ; Time began it, time will end it, then its kingdom will he rent, 'Whirling lasts of primal, forming total solid, white, and fair : Down deECfnd the fleecy snowflakes through the regisns of the air. Arctic zone, and icy realms, see the whole on every side; Cheerless prospects, quickly from thy chilly frozen tract I'll hide !
