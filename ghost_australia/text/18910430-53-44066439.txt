Christy Reamviis. THE shades of, the lato departed E. P. Christy, the founder or, it might he said, the discoverer * of the negro minstrel entertainment, are at last to he appeased. If Christy's ghost ever revisited the glimpses of the moon, it (the "spook) mast have been chagrined to find the olassio arena of sable minstrelsy deterio- rated to a mere " leg show." The com- pany which, under the^name* of " The AmericanMinstrels," opens at the Theatre Royal to-morrow night has reverted to the pristine practice, and in its circle the weaker vessel has no place. The company is a strong and capable one. The stage management is in the hands of Mr. John Gilmore, more familiarry known as "Johnny," and the business arrange- ments are in the hands of Mr. J. J: Cameron. As the idea of reverting to tfc uractice of a purely male organisation is\ old idea of Mr. P. J. Ryan's it is nattai to ascribe the present visit to his efforts._
