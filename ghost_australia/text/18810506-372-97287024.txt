?A SPEIG OF DAPHNE. S Ciiclnotspeak? Have I no voice To whisper softâ€”' Beware 1 ?When, rev*rent, to the bearded hps He lifts the leaf that touched her hair ? Must I no subtle warning give To save from pain, and wound, and scar, No ruddy signal wave, to tell Of toioh mistaken for a star ? To tell him, that a gilded palm Stretched sooner out, could take The bloBBom that she bid him ' wear And keep, tbo' faded, for her sake.' Ahl could I whisper in hU ear The cold decision I hare heard, To steal his heart, and fling it down ; Ala i ! I find nor sound, nor word. I hare no voice, I can but die The sooner, fall of bitter pain That o'er my fragrant tablet lies No written truth, no warning stain. Ay! fling me down I poor wounded heart } *I would have stved you, master, this. If speech had been vouchsafed to me Last night, beneath your raptured kiss. Your turn has come, the shaft was swift* Its poisoned errand to conclude ; Yet courage take ! it was Love's ghost, Not Love itself, you warmly wooed. A sprig of daphne, crushed and dim, A. bearded face more stem and set, That's all ; bring in fresh blosBoms cow. Who's next ? Smile on, Coquette.
