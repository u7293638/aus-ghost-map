THE KAISER'S PLAY HISSED.) An interesting account of tbe re ception accorded a play of which the Kaiser was part author is given in a Berlin cablegram in the San Francisoo 'Chronicle.' The first presentation of ' Der Isensahn' (the Iron Tooth) at the Royal Theatre was a notable event, socially ana artistically, ah the tickets had 'been sold nine days before and the house was packed. Emperor William appeared during the second act, and sat almost unobserved and quite alone in the royal orchestra bos, screened by tbe drapery from observation. After the first act there was completo silence. After the second and third there was rather vigorous applause, but from the par quet, wherq the critics and literary people s&t;, and frou; the seoond and third galleries there came a pieroing storm of hisses. The Emperor, whose collaboration with Captain Lauf in the - play is well known, was highly displeased. Captain Lauf took a cup of tea with his Majesty after the third aot, having twice answered calls from the boxes and elsewhere, and having come before the curtain as pale as a ghost. Then he, with the Emperor, left the theatre, whioh caused a sensa tion. Neither the Empress nor the Imperial Prince attended, quite con trary to the previous arrangement. The publio verdiot.of the play is that it is verbose, although containing fine dramatic passages, and too palpably glorifies the Hohtneollem hero who put down the Berlin rebellion in 1447 The acting wu axoelltat throughout.
