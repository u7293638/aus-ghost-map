WHEN FATHOMS DEEP. A sailor tells the story of a diver who saw two ghosts. He had gone down to the wreck of a large steamer and was crossing the main saloon when two gray shapes of enormous size came ambling towards him. He did not wait to make notes, but gave the danger signal and was pulled up. Told m tine eneeriui ngnt or tne aay,. seemed rather a lame story, so another diver went down to see what he could make of it. Towards him also came the ghostly gray shapes. He stood irresolute for a moment and then, going boldly forward, struck his hatchet through â€” a mirror ! The ghosts were only a dim reflection of his own legs, much enlarged, of course, as everything is that a diver sees through the frontal eye of his helmet.
