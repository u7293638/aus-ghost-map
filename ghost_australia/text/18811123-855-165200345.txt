(To the Editor of tlw I'vnora Star.) Sin, —Having been prevented by illness to ^ take uotice earlier of some peculiar decisions tC given in your WardeirV Court, I now Jieff leave to encroach upon your space in order to. draw attention to one portion- of tlie report of the proceedings in that Court, iu which tlio Warden is1 represented to have stated that ** men- were' liot bomid by such surveys,' meaiiih'- Wrereby surveys effected under instructions issued front Uie Mining Registrar's, office, A serious statement ot j so _grayc import Jinade 'froiii'gie' ju-]kji»enfc ,-, seatsliouia notlie passed1 mnioticed, as it -» ) entirely misleading. However nvach the j «nrveiwVTio- eTacitiBdl!iisrp4rtioulartiBurvey j may have liluiidered^Jiie ; survey represented ;-. | the claim held- by -tlie plaintiffs nut'U-such - ' ,; ? \ time as tlie latter 'had 'set' 'the. ne|e&ry; \\[ *j machinery in motion to set aside $ie'snrvey -?: j as erroneous ?; , aud it therefore certainly does J seem preposterous to fiuc anyone and mulct | him iu heavy eosbi, because- on the faith of \ this survey he applied for a piece ol^an'! j which apparently was unoccupied.

The BiicrroM FiTLMEff emitted by tnc Warden on a previous occasion, to the efiect v tliat on all future occasions lie. would impose J heavy fines whenever the ' jumper* ' l'a'' 'jumped' anything on Irivolous grounds, is highly amusing. ' Mr. Warden De Boos is very much in the .position of Frankenstein «- who had raised a ghost, but «-uld not Jay it. Jumpers are not very frequently f j endowed with vast wealth, and itfl'fflgeUaog ; thebreeksoffaHielandlnan.
