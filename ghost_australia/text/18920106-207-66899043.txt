An. Unfortunate Editor. " Are you the editor of the Brunswick newspapers ?" ssked a manunmuth female of a prominent press representative on Sydney-road on Tuesday. "Yes, my good lady, I amu," replied thelinoffensive scribe. "Then take that. you villain. 1'II teach you to write ine downl as an old wonlan feid of her beer." As the irate Wloitan spoke she made' a furious onl slaught on the surprised reporter, and being of heavy calibre she bore himn dotwn and proceeded to punmel hiln. This was more than even a ipress relire sentative could stand, anl the crushed man Ileait a retreat as loon as he could get rid of (lie incubus. He was flatteneid smut like a slab, and he appeared in court next day the ghost of his Former self. Ilis antagonist was brought Ibef,re tme enuch iand tined ou another charge of being dIrunk, and when the fline was annouIced she said, â€¢ .What about the Editor ?" but a general laugh was the oUily reply. TIhe ful of the little-or rather heavy incident, is that the wrong iltan was assaulted. The vile wretch who alccused Mr.. W\Vilkinsoi of being an "old woman," use,l to Ie employed on this newspaper, but lie died seven years ago, anld is now suffering hfr hlis misdeeds. Perhaps it is a good thing for him that he is ldead. '['o be jumped on by m lI stone female is calculated to make any man wish lie was dead.
