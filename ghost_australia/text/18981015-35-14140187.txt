LADY'S LETTER FROM LONDON. -. LONDON, Sept. 9. No-I decline to talk about the African war I want to got away from the African war The list of killed and wounded is a very cruel breakfast relish every day of our lives but I don't go along,,' with the Czar for all that and I don't believe a Czar in his senses expects us to seriously contemplate his decorative programme for universal peace while Russia herself is building away, as fast as a hive of bees at ironclads and Brown Besses Clever little Ccar ' Miss Mary Kingsley is one of the most charm- ing personalities I ever met No one who watches her face would require to read her books to know that she his a very strong, penetrating character, a rigid sense of probity, and all the courage of her opinions All that is written there in clear lines For clear, strong sense and judgment and accuracy of deduction I should think jury Mary ' takes the take and above and beyond all this there are the kindness and by sympathy beaming from her eyes which made her the most devoted of daughters, and still make her a devoted sister But her friends tell of many quaint quips and cranks, which only when her intensely hilarious laugh transforms her one can fit on to her grave and noble face An old friend made a weird mistake at her table Pouring out some whisky in a big tumbler, he filled it up from another decanter, thinking it was water-pure gin, or something equally potent Miss Kingsley watched the process, and watched the wild leap which followed a hearty draught " Why on earth did you not tell me-stop me- Mary t ' cried he, dancing madly "I did not wish to stop you " replied Miss Kingsley, with imperturbable cheerfulness " I thought perhaps it was your own especial mixture ' Miss Kingsley dresses with rigid plainness, the easiest skirt and blouse, and her fair hair bound down firmly in a black velvet bandeau, across which she pins a little point of hair, which some how looks very medieval She is slight and rather angular, like a mathematical figure inspired with life and fun if you can imagine that But she has always looked like a Holbein Madonna to me She told me she had seen the capture 01 110 think it was) said elephants in an African forest " The natives go into the enclosure and climb up trees, from which they lead the attack so I went in and climbed up a tree," is , all in a tone of peaceable matter of fact, as if it meant no more than crossing Oxford street The book she is preparing of "West African Studies " greatly interrupted by her serious illness from influenza in January, is coming out this autumn through Messrs Macmillan's good offices, and I hope will contain our opinions on Mohammedan missions, which she briefly explained to me, and which I should not like to forestall, surprising as they are This month she is to speak, much as she dislikes it, at the British Association at Bristol and speaking of her fresh, vigorous platform style, which I told her I liked and which I certainly do likewise looked regretfully at me, adding, " I never can write nor speak English So and-So asked if I spoke like my books and was told- yes worse" She said it with inimitable humour Before these lines reach you M Rougemont will have delivered his long, expected address at the above association He is still the subjects much scepticism , but few people acquainted with outlandish countries seem disposed to doubt his narrative It is needless to remind Australians that the lone white man isolated for years amid sai age horses is by no means a very rare ear 10 sity Civilised men have sought the wild tribes out of misanthropy by choice as well as by necessity, and many such besides M Rougemont are known to exist among the wild tribes who have never seen another white man They are usually accepted as beings of a superior world and acumen and if not worshipped are understood generally to be having a good Urao Why M Rouge- mont ever left the delights of such supremacy we have still to learn One thing is certain, that he never anticipated the extraordinary fame and fortune which have followed his escape, and placed him on a pedestal worthy of a Robinson Crusoe, a Mungo Park, not to say a Baron Munchausen rolled into one In the " Young Woman for September Mrs Ana, who writes the dress column in various periodicals, is interviewed, and "gives some very airy statistics concerning the proprieties and prices of women's dress , so much so that one's first idea is the is " retained " by the shops, and the next and more charitable that the interviewer has not understood they don't all under stand Mrs Ana states that 1500 a year for dress is not uncommon, and that " no great show is made for it " " A simple white muslin frock can cost 30 guineas " Asked what is the least amount per annum a woman-of course, Bho means a nice woman, a smart woman, and a woman in society or on its fringe can possibly dress upon Mrs Ana says " she might be able to get along on £50 a year, not a penny less, and she would have to be very economical then I think such a statement in such a paper framed for the middle classes, rather mischievious for whilst everyone knows that a woman can dress extremely well-that is, gracefully, economically, and with proper deference to quiet changes of fashion-on half £10, the impression given is that it is necessary to spend freely whatever the effect may be and many a woman who cannot afford it, and whose husband cannot afford it, will spend lavishly on Mrs Arms recommendation, and no one will gain but the shops In my own opinion, with all regard to the necessity of looking one's very best and doing one s very best, I consider the woman who actually spends every year on herself a sum which would buy a handsome life annuity or endow a hospital bed is a very thoughtless and irreligious member of so very To dress well is r virtue, but as to dress one can only have a good material, a good fit, and a good colour, and to pay preposterous prices for even these three in dispensable is a vice, because it directly encourages fraud Mrs Ana is quite right in saying that the most costly dress does not include the art of looking well in it, and I am thankful to hear she considers that no woman looks well dressed on a back clo Mrs Rentoul Esler, most charming of story writers, author of " A Way of Transgressors " and " A Maid of the Manse," is writing some fresh and graceful little stones, which will appear in a new volume soon " Miss Prihcilla's Tolly ' is one which will encourage many women to grow sw cot in hope who are gradually souring without it Mr Frith's picture of the " Derby Day " has made Epsom and all its works known throughout the world But it is not generally understood that the great home of racing for a few weeks every year is one of the most charming of health resorts in summer. The Epsom Wells, once so fashionable, are chiefly in private hands, and no longer frequented by the ohio , but the fresh breezes on the Downs, the old gardens and ancient houses of renown full of Gibbons's carving, ghosts, and even Italian and French art, still attract visitors, who take possession of them when the Ebbishamites (Epsomites) migrate to the Continent and the Partndgo moor The great bane of Epsom is the betting population, and the de- moralisation of boys and men is greatly deplored, and even resented, by the very large non-sporting section of the townspeople Holders of property go so far as to say that were the races banished from the Downs it would be better both for the trade and the morals of the town, as the pandemonium of race weeks deters prosperous residents from settling down But whilst the railway company scores £70,000 additional revenue in the race week it is not likely that the temperance vote or the land agent protest will be listened to
