CHILTERN. From our own Correspondent January 27th, 1864. West Chiltern Mining Company The prosecution and dismissal by the Bench at Chiltern of Charles Revel [Revell], lately treasurer to the above company; and who took a journey to Melbourne with the cash obtained from the Bank for gold, the property of the share- holders, should act as warning to all mining companies. There was not the slightest question but that the defen dant had appropriated the money to his own use, but on the technical ground that the West Chiltern Company were not legally registered, Mr Chas. Revel was necessarily allowed to go free. Suing him civilly might he more trouble than the money is worth, but this case will, we doubt not, open the eyes of others to the necessity of com- plying with the requirements of the law. I would wish to-call the attention of* your Chiltern'readers to an advertise ment in another column relative ta a lecture to be delivered in connection with the Young Mt o'sMu ual Improve ment Society, on Friday evening next, in the Wesleyan ' Chapel, ' by J. H„ Cuzr.er, Esq. The su;>jrct chos-n Cor the lecture is one, I have'.no doubt, that will bp appreciated by the Chil ternites, it being enfi'.led—* Ancient Eijypt, with original drawings and illustrations.' It will also be seen in the advertising columns of- your paper th&t; the ChiUern Oddfellows intend celebrating their first annive-sary with a grand banquet and ball. I believe if i8 their intention to lay the foundation stoue <\>f their new Hall on the stme day (Friday, February 19 h), with tb^ observation of the ceremonies usually adopted by the Order on these occa sions.

My L>rd,—T have- had the honor to lay before the Queen the loyal and dutiful address of .the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Freemasons of Victoria, in Australia, on the occasion of the marriage of His Royal Highness the Piince of Wales. And I have to inform your lordship that Her Majesty was pleased to ■receive the address very graciously.

Sovereigns to whom the destiny of nations is confided. Whenever ssvere shocks have shaken bases and displaced limits of states, solemn transactions have taken plaC9 to arrange new elements, and to conse crate by revision accomplished trans formations. Such was the object of the Treaty of Westphalia in the 17th cen tury, and the negotiations in Vienna in 1815\. On this latter foundation now re poses the political edifice ot Europe, and yet it is crumbling away on all aides. If the situation of different countries be attentively considered, it is impossible Dot to admit that the treaties of Vienna, upon almost all points, art' destroyed, modified, misunderstood, or menaced: hence duties without rule, rights without title, pretensions with out restraint. I therefore propose to regulate the present and secure the future in a cangxe=s. Therefore I am ready,without any preconceived system, to bring to «.n international council the spirit of moderation and justice. By taking the initiative in such an overture, I do not yield to an impulse of vanity; but as a Sovereign to whom ambitious projects are most frequently atiributed, I endeavour to prove by this frank and loyal step that my sole object is to arrive, without a shock, at the pacifica tion of Europe. I pray you to accept Paris as the place of meeting In c*se the princes, allies, and friends of France should think proper to heighten by their presence the authority of the deliberations, I shall be proud to offer them my cordial hospitality. Eutope would see, perhaps, some advantage in the capital from which the signal for war has so often been given, becoming the seat of conferences destined to lay bases of general pacification.
