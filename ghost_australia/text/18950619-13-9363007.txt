WEDNESDAY, JUNE 19, 1883. Mr. GRAHAM, the leader of the country party, has given notice of motion for the reduction of the duty on slops from 50 percent, to 35, and for the reduction of the duty on woollens from 40 to 25 per cent. This motion will fairly raise the issue of Tariff Reform, and it is to be given a right hearty welcome accordingly. The discussion and the vote taken together should go far to show to what extent hon. members are prepared to adopt the doctrine that the true way to obtain money for the Treasurer - YVIIO neill Yvants money surely the true way to relieve the producer, and the true way to give the colony its much-needed life, is to take some decisive but reasonable steps towards placing our duties upon a revenue basis. No doubt there are many Tariff' Reformer who would like to drop to 25 per cent, for slops and 20 per cent. for Yvoolloiis straight away, and the utmost sympathy may be expressed with those members, who are the fighting wing of the party. The 25 per cent, policy is undoubtedly the policy to be submitted to country for adop- tion as the opportunity offers. But so far as to-day is concerned Mr. GRAHAM has to consider which proposal will bring together the largest number of Tariff Reform votes in the House, and it may be concluded that he has chosen his ground accordingly. And if this motion be carried we may take it that the 25 percent, standard is not far off, and that after a rest there the position will be further intelligently reviewed by the people, as a whole in the interests of the country as a whole, with the additional experience which will then have been acquired. For our part, we want to unbuild the present Chinese wall with all legitimate despatch, and as it seems the House is not inclined to go further than Mr. GRAHAM proposes, the best course now is for the friends of the cause in the House and out of it to strengthen the hands of the member for Numurkah. The instalment of reform which he proposes is an acceptable one. It is for Tariff' Reform constituencies now to look after their members, YVIIO will be sub ' ject to every possible influence from a hostile Ministry and a ling infested lobby. As Mr. TucKEr. is the chairman of the Tariff Board his speech naturally attracted . much attention. It was weighty, full of matter, and deserves attentive consideration. The member for fitzroy thought it necessary to explain to the House that he remains the connived protationistho was of yore This was almost superfluous Every has of the report bears witness to this fact, and to the further fact mentioned by Mr TUCKER. that there was not a free-trader upon " the Tariff Board But these | circumstances undoubtedly give some of the statements of the report a special value, inasmuch as they may be taken as admissions wrung from unwilling witnesses whose constant effort is to mummie or to explain the ugly men dents away Mr TUCKER it's opening remarks contain two statements which challenge attention as coming from the hon. member 1 First of all, Mr Lucking admits that agriculture is the one national industry to which all the others should give way and it this is the case, which undoubtedly it is, that is the best of all reasons why artificial industries sho and be careful not to lay too heavy a load upon the parent and supporting shun "the one big fact before all men is that a Victorian agriculture has now to fight for its own against the world in the world's spaces with the handicap of distance against it 'Lho " sacrifices ' it is asked to make should be reasonable accordingly, for the simple reason that burdens too heavy may be in c it on its 1 noes Mr lucivLits second statement is "that the farmers have got hold of " the truism that a nation cannot sell unless it buys, and that when " they expect the return payment " is made in imports If they send " butter worth £1,000,000 goods to the " value of £1,000 000 must come in ' We can only hope that this is the case, for onto this truism is accepted the end is not far off If imports are paid for as they are with the exception of loan imports by the export of produce, then every million of imports of goods from abroad is an outlet for the ninth produce to be raised here, and instead of people screaming against an ports they should welcome them as giving the farmer what he most wants -namely, customers for his produce the less imports in the legitimate way of trade the less the outside demand for the commodities which the agriculturist produces Mr I ucKLlt went on to defend the Tariff Board argument that there are lings of importers and minds of manufacturers, and that the right check on both is to main tim a competition between the two So far as this is an argument against prohibitive duties, it is welcome, but at the game time the facts show that the one effective check against rings is freedom of intercourse But for the old and exaggerated story of that very special and exceptional article, the American reaper and binder, Mr Tucivi rt and his friends would not have a leg to stand upon As regards the great staples of iron, and cotton, and tea, and sugar, and timber, no allegation of a ung i>, made, while already there are abundant proofs of the high duties calling into existence here monopolies combinations, fungi, and steps' that may put America into the background But this may pass the present battle is against the pro- Inbitiomst, and Air looking declara- tion that prohibition means monopoly, and that monopoly means plunder may be accepted in good faith as a contribution to the common cause Air receiver is, in duty to his party, compelled to ridicule the idea of a 25 percent standard, but it is difficult to follow the gentlemen who use this argument Does not this standard exist in the sister state" and do not industries Hamish under it The woollen mill passages of Mr lucRtits speech deserve careful con situation in view of the resolution about to be dealt with in committee the hon. member is constrained to admit the failure of the high duties in this instance, and he says that but for his casting vote the land Board would have recommended a larger reduction than the one it actually proposes Air litiNWim treated the House to the High Tariff lecture which he has dear ered up hill and down dale throughout the colony), and doubtless by the diligent recital of a series of false urge ments and silk) statements he has come to believe in some of them himself MA as I not present at the Battle of Waterloo'' asked Greater the rain th of the Hon. Duke "I " have often heard Your Majesty) say so," was the diplomatic reply the hearer leaves Mr IKLXWIIII with the clear impression that Air GLADSTONE IS a fool for opposing protection in England, and that Mr CLLVJ LAND IS a rogue for initiating any reform in the United States and in which category the number plates the member for Richmond remains a matter of choice Mr By an having inquired into the cigarette monopoly which has been established here finds that it is a really shocking revenue steal for the benefit of a New York trust, which in the public interests demands to be promptly dealt with Mr IIU-WVITH fitly concluded with a passionate do some of the present system, and an announcement of his determination to oppose in this instance what he regards as a wavering Government " the " highest duty in the world, he avers, ' is the best duty in the world And at that height of fiscal philosophy we may Icav c the hon member At last New South Wales has got a Governor, but it has taken the Marquis of RIPON a good while to find one. Governorships are more easily filled up in works of fiction than in the world of real life. When the time arrived for Rawdon Crawley to disappear out of Vanity Fair, the author of that immortal York arranged for an announcement in the HoyatUt which was surprising alike to Hawdon and the roads-, The governorship of Coventry Island, it was stated, had been offered to a distinguished Waterloo officer. "We need " not only men of acknowledged " bravery," the police proceeded, " but " men of administrative talents, to " superintend the affairs of our colonies;" so KiiYvdon went from the card-table and the board of green cloth to the tropics, Yvhcnco in due time he sent home files of the Hwump Town Gazette, in which the new Governor was praised with enthusiasm, " whereas the Swamp " Tmtm Sentinel, whose wife was not " asked to Government-house, declared " that His Excellency was a tyrant " compared with whom None was " an enlightened philanthropist," The experienced man of the day, whose time is in the nineties, can decide for himself out of his own, observation what (degree of development governing and governorships have undergone since 1895-6, when Hawdon Cmwloy parted from Becky Sharp, or in TERMS, the year after Deau MACARTNEY'S coming to Melbourne, when TJIACKLR YAT completed Vanity Pair If the novelist had had Australia as vividly in his mind as SYT» LY SYIITII had Botany Bay when writing amusing essay, s for the / during the Review, we might have had some middle of the century lashes of satire at the expense of of society on the shores of Port Jackson as it was known to and moved in by ROBERT LOWE 'The Imperial authorities, in their eagerness to minister to Australian self respect and to countenance the pride which is proper to people who can manage their own affairs, have made difficulties for themselves For a long time we got along fairly well with the so called professional Governor-the Governor YY he rose by degrees from the charge of such tiny islets as Heligoland St Helena, or Hong Kong, where the representatives of the Orara is his own Prime Minister to the responsibility of watching over, but not interfering with, the affairs of peoples occupying territories as large as a European State of the first rank, and having the right to deal with such 1er stones pretty much as they please 'The routine Governor by training and experience-by contact with ad Y users on the spot and by cm i espondence with authority fat Remove, the Secretary of State and the min Korras -gradually became accomplished in the performance of duties requiring tict, reticence, and the forbearance which influences by appearing to let alone But in the early eighties when things were booming in Australia, and the eyes of the astonished British people had been opened to the almost incredible fact that an Australian eleven could meet the pick of English cricket (GRACI included) on even terms, the time was thought to demand a now de pasture to Sydney was sent a peer who, though he was seeking rest from the excitements of highly fashionable life, would, it was foreseen, by wars which to him should seem quiet and reposeful, communicate to Port Jackson society shocks and thrills as delightful as those experienced by the butterfly on first break ing forth from the old, salts, the ante natal tomb in which lepidoptera "dream " of the life to come " " When in the natural course of " human events, ' as they say in the Declaration of American Independence, a vacancy occurred in the governor ship of Victoria, by a circumstance fortunate for us the Conservative party was in office, and Lord SALES nor had no difficulty in sending us the Earl of IIOITTOUN to balance Baron CARRINGTON, whom Mr. Or MUSICAL had found for New South Wales and his worshipper, Sir H.EN.RY PYPIIS And by a stroke of fortune, which shows that our luck is still in, Baron BRASS.

The public exacts more from Governors and Parliament grants them smaller allowances than was the case ten years ago. " Will you vote for cut " ting down the Governor's salary ?" seems as an electioneering question to have elbowed out that one problem the state bank of issue. Popular sentiment on the subject is not easy to correctly measure. The last time there was a discussion in our Assembly Mr. DEAKIN said that the Democracy his Democracy, we presume - dislikes state display, and Sir HENRY WRIXON hinted that the fashionable world would fain have on excuse for curtailing the expenditures it had been led into in emulation of Government-house hospitality. Yet, though Lord Horraouis for several years running kept up an expenditure exceeding his allowance by £13,000 a year, the democratic spirit, as interpreted through Mr. W. M. CLARK, then member for Footscray, would not be satisfied, and each year when the Estimates came up indulged in its suspicions and its querulous doubts and fault-finding, The Governor who in any colony tries to follow the wise injunction to be found in books of proverbs by living on the safe side of his allowance finds his " parsimony " and his " meanness " promptly commented on in the Democratic press, When he gives reasons for not subscribing to a regatta almost every newspaper reader throughout Australasia is expected to raise his eyebrows and lift up his hands. Sydney possesses whether it is ashamed or proud of the possession we do not venture to asked literature which is largely made up of remarks about Government-house kitchen. The Governor's expenditure, so far as it can be guessed at or pried into, is scanned, discussed, and sneered at to the apparent delight of humorous citizens, in weekday and Sunday papers. The representative of the QUEEN is expected to manage his establishment so as to satisfy the criticisms of writers who got their ideas of hospitality by " Standing " drinks for each other in the Oxford bar, or by providing excursions on Sunday afternoons to Coogee by tram or to Manly by steamer when there happens to be an opera chorus in Sydney A Victorian Governor is exempted from much of the prying and commenting which makes life hardly worth living over the border; at the same time the position he has to fill is extremely taxing. We have provided him with a house so big that, leaving great functions out of notice, it takes most of his allowance to keep the place going from week to week. Were one of the old school of Governors to attempt to " run " Government-house in the old style on the new allowance he would have to finish up before Judge MOLESWORTH, unites Parliament found a way to make compounding on the quiet as easy for him as for its own members A remark commonly made is, "The President of " the United States only gets £10,000 " a year." " Pooh," exclaimed Polonius under similar circumstances, you speak like a green girl." The office of President may be only worth £10,000 to the person filling it, but it is worth millions to the party which elects him. * Schemes for persuading divided churches into unity too often sound to practical men as though they were fit only for the latitude of Laputa They are texts over which divines grow eloquent, but about which practical men despair Nothing can be more tenacious than the vitality of an ancient church quarrel It may have lost all sense and relevance , it may be as remote from the life of to day as, say, the quarrels of the Hoptarchy are from the last division in the House of Commons, and yet it will continue to splutter and burn, and affect the result of man- kind like some Chinese stink pot endowed somehow with immortal vitality Now and again, However a church quarrel does get itself healed, with infinite advantage to mankind The Presbyterian churches of this colony, for example wisely refused to acclimatise on Australian soil the divisions which flourish so rankly under Scottish skies, and so Australian Presbyterianism is a unit-with much benefit to Presbyterian pockets and much increase of public respect for the Presbyterian name A noteworthy meeting which is to be held this evening in Wesley Church, and over which His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of South Australia who comes from Adelaide for the purpose is to preside, seems to show that another triumph of common sense is about to be achieved in the ecclesiastical realm the Methodist churches throughout Australasia have been negotiating for union for some years past, they have agreed as to terms and methods, and these churches at the present moment resemble nothing so much as a chemical solution on the point of crystallisation The meeting this evening is to act as a beneficent precipitating shed , under which the long separated elements will rush together If there is any form of ecclesiastical union which ought to take place without difficulty, and with the utmost possible despatch, it is exactly that which the meeting over which Lieutenant GOY crnor WAR IS to preside is intended to serve We doubt whether anybody could tell Methodists themselves least of all-why this part ticular branch of Protestantism exists in these colonies under three or four different forms Certain quarrels, we know as a matter of history, rent the church of We sLi Y in England, and give rise to a succession of protesting churches Pul- these quarrelsome 12,000 miles off and they are all dead They are as remote from the life of to day as the conflicts of the blue and green factions that once filled the sheets of Constantinople with confusion and blood shed Yet here in Victoria to day we have the curious spectacle of three or four varieties of Methodism under tinguishable except beneath the microscope who still maintain separate organisation", build rival churches, and spend vast sums yearly in a competition which has absolutely no meaning Church differences when translated into exact terms are often found to be of very tiny scale The cause which rent the Greek and Latin churches asunder was the addition of a single Latin word of four syllables to the Nicene Creed The whole Auan heresy may be compressed into a Greek diphthong, mind, to quote GIBBON, " the profane of every age " have decided the furious contests " which the difference of a single diph " thong excited between the Home ' organs and the llomoiounans" But the theology of the different Methodist churches is not differentiated by so much as a single vowel Vi li} should ecclesiastical differences which have long ceased to possess any morning be preserved 1 The truth is that church div Unions are always costly luxuries, and when they are not justified by reason, or do not represent real differences of essential creed, they are both an offence and a disaster to religion It may be doubted whether, looked at from any point of view, the colony is not already over churches The church building impulse has beat strongly in the blood of all the denominations, and, as a result, we have, according to Haytet, in this colony alone no less than 4,760 churches of various scale, ranging from the city cathedral to the slab " meeting house in the mallee 'This is a large supply of churches for a young community numbering a little over a million. It gives an average of say one church or " build " ing devoted to public worship " for every 50 adults ; or, to be exact for every 107 " attendants on public " worship," counting the very babies The cost of these 476 churches is sufficient to set the mouth of Mr. TURNER. watering with envy. In scale it would equal a new loan in annual cost it would exceed the income tax. The amount the community devoted to the service of religion counts, of course, to its honour, but no one can doubt that even competition between the churches is one of the blots of colonial life. There is not a country township, from the Murray to the sea, which does not pro- sent the same spectacle of unnecessary churches, in which underpaid divines preach to tiny and overburdened flocks, The ecclesiastical landscape when thus contemplated does not wear a cheerful complexion. But where, as in the case of the Methodist household, churches which scarcely differ in name, and cor tainly differ in nothing else, you multiply rival buildings and maintain competing ministers, the offence against common sense is rank. Such churches represent a tragical waste of that by no means too large fund which constitutes the floating capital of the religious institutions. The Methodist churches are on the point of agreement, and so this particular form of unwise competition will come to an end, and sensible men of every school and creed will give their frankest suffrages to the policy the Methodist churches are now adopting. The worldgrowsimpatient with religious differences generally, but it has simply no charity for ecclesiastical divisions which represent nothing but the ghosts of dead quarrels, the echoes of far-off conflicts, waged under other skies than our own, and waged about points which to us have no meaning. Methodist union, if quickly accomplished, will prove that in the ecclesiastical realm common sense is still a regnant force. It will augment the resources and lighten the burdens of the churches directly concerned, but it will also remove one cluster of absurdities from the Christianity of the colony itself. The Legislative Assembly board only three speakers on the tariff, namely) Mr later Sir John McIntyre, and Mr 'Trenwith Anti, generally speaking the proceedings were entertaining, though not sparkling Before beginning Mr Graham ran up the reform colours to the truck by giving notice that he would later on move that the duty on woollen piece goods shoal The 25 per cent, and on apparel 35 per cent Una will bring the whole question of tariff reform to an issue, because the discussion we will come upon the fourth item on the hat which is apparel Mr tucker ought to have exchanged voices with his colleague Mr Best, who is always clear because iii (Mr Tucker) could scarcely be heard He mumbled occasion ally, and the drift of his argument was not always perceptible But the speech on the whole was an admirable contribution to the reform cause Sir John M Inf were did not require to disguise his opinions and the House had them in no uncertain way) Mr I Trenwith spoke at great length and was pugnacious to use Mr staughton description Of course, in breaking down the arguments against high duties he knocked down something which he had himself erected or rather, he put the arguments in a way to suit his replies and then cniahidthem At a quarter to 11 Mr Irvine moved the adjournment Mr Turner made a pretence of forcing the pace but considerately gave way at 11 oclocl,vvhen Mr Irvine was just getting well into hash ject He will continue his address this afternoon at half-past 3 o'clock the I Legislative Council held only a short sitting of half a hour yesterday, adjourning out of respect to the memory of the late Dr Dobson Sir William Zeal announced the event from the chair, and paid a touching tribute to the worth and the long Lurlie mentary career of the late Chairman of Committees Mr Cuthbert, who moved that the Council record its sense of the loss it had sustained and that a copy of the resolution be forwarded to Mrs. Dobson alluded to the wide knowledge of constitutional history and Parliamentary procedure possessed by Dr Dobson, and a few observations in the same strain were added by Sir Frederick Sargood Mr Fitzgerald, and Mr Balfour to-day the Council meets at halfpast 4 but at the request of the leader of the House a spread caucus of membershaabeen convened for 3 56 in order to consider the election of a clever man of Committees The dinner r ten more to the President by the members and officers of the house takes place at 7 o'clock this evening Mr Tuokcnsthe product of Fitzroy and that circumstance should be borne in mind in estimating the value of his tariff speech yesterday Mr Tucker of Fitzroy struggle with the real Mr 1 ucLcr, and the c} men in the Chamber could BCC how, while during (the settled policy, he was careful to Hess here and there, so as not to shed lit re J The balance was dead against high duties he was a member of the Tariff No end of 1883 the board of 1893 and chairman of the last And as chairman he had the happiness to make the acquaintance of farmers in all parts of Victoria an 1 be raised heart) cheers when he told the House that the farmers were 6th class to be proud of and that everything must be done to keep them on the land through a city member he confesses 1 at once that the true and paramount interest of the country was traced ture, and he told other city) members (Mr Hancock and Mr Trenwith listmin,, allen try c1) ) that the farmers scouted the idea that they could sell without buying. They are well grounded in the principles of exchange and he was delighted to find them reasoning on a very bound basis At the same time he was convinced that while farmers strongly objected to IULJI duties it was impracticable to fix a maximum of "> per cent Then he claimed that the tariff should be unaltered for five years because each tariff change cost the country £100,000 Without perhaps seeing that he was seen Biatent he first expressed regret that every item of the tariff was not before the no lie and then said that members constituted the worst possible tribunal for dealing with details of duties For instance, after all night a few years ago the House gleefully) and thoughtlessly increased thesis) on wine from 6s to 12s per gallon that step had cost the country £20,000 in revenue without benefiting the vignerons "Hut the) dont want the duty reduced, interjects 1 an hon. member ' lhatiBao replied Mr Butler but I don't know that the vignerons should 1 shape the policy of this country Pursuing the free trade lime in his argument Mr Tucker dwelt emphatically upon the fact that high duties reduced wages He declared that that proposition had been proved up to the hilt The amount of duty on piece goods really wrenched out of the wages of the poor creatures employed in making clothes Then for a moment he was a protect onist (april ing to 1 states) and declared that the boot industry was a trophy) of protection it had been so firmly) estate but that it could almost stands alone without duties indeed, one manufacturer had assured him of his willingness to B1 if a cargo of Victorian boots to London but (here again he was a freetrader) he was profoundly disappointed with the result of pro tecting the woollen mills and he gave some convincing testimony to prove how the people were sweated to support the nulla. It was a shame that textile fabrics about 1 be heavily taxed as they had been to bring out so poor a result. Next in the composite character of a free trade protect unionist, he showed that there were rings both among importers and manufacturers and he give knocks to both Afterwards he exposed the enormity of the spirit, tobacco and sugar subsidies, and then, throwing away all restraint and once more becoming the real Mr motor the intelligent well in formed, and convinced freetrader he spoke eloquently of the value of commerce to every nation The reprobated the sneering In Judge I'm at the expense of merchants who ought to be encouraged in every way he spoke from personal experience of the bustle of S) They life as compared with the dull streets of Melbourne, and, finally he begged the House before it was too late to get back the trade of the port and make Melbourne the emporium of Australia few members have been so heartily cheered as was Mr Tucker when he concluded after expressing Each doll) sent ments What struck Sir John McIntyre and struck every other member was that while Mr Tucker was a fervent advocate for removing trammils on commerce, he and the Marine Board were proposing to go such a, short this tance in the desired direction And Mr John, who is keen In debate, of course put this view to the House with such action He expressed the disappointment the people felt on seeing the report of the board and asked the House to consider the weight of opinion in favour of a reduction in duties 1 lily eight members were returned pledged to a substantial reduction, and for those left) eight upwards of 80,000 persons voted There was convincing proof of the widespread and very strong feeling in favour of fiscal reform. He was against the suggestion that once the tariff was altered it should not be touched for five years, because, in spite of the heavy vote cast for reductions, the Tariff Board proposed very slight changes, and they had been made daughter still by the Minister of Customs who, Solomon like always wanted to halve the baby The reductions wcrcsopaltr»,indeed that twould have been better had the tariff not been touched ' Hear hear from Mr Hancock Sir John (not Hancock hut Mintaro) went on to make an evil state calculation to prove that under the high duties policy Victoria had almost been standing still, whereas just before pro- action was introduced industries were spring ni? up naturally all over the country All legitimate enterprise was ham jeered when duties were imposed " YY hat about the stock tax" asked Mr Heat evidently with a view to dishing Sir John but the veteran countered quick!)

Of course he was most attentive to Mr Murray Smith, and his habitual attitude was a half turn to the right He told the member for Hawthorn that Adam Smith was not to be relied upon because he knew nothing of the conditions of Victoria in 1893 " that is an objection to the Ten Commandments interjected Mr Downes Carter Mr. I Trenwith then dived into economic ii history, and declared that England a greatness was a result of protection and that the abolition of the corn laws, was a step in the direction of protection But since the inauguration of free trade in 18 16 1 nglandhad steadily lost her supremacy) in manufactures Mr Murray) Smith was certainly being entertained And he was kept interested when Mr Trenwith, in a long and captandum argument, contended that protection not only widened the area of employment but really reduced prices The give examples in support of the thesis but every time he showed that prices had come down after duties were in creased he was met with the challenge ' Then the duty is not granted take it off No he would not agree to that, The dut) must be kept on in each case, lest the import! as the week end Importers, flooded the market and rome of the manufacturers ' Lil the old woman who lost on every Here she Bold and yet made a handsome profit remarked Mr Murray) Smith Agriculture was not forgotten Mr 1 Trenwith said he was the friend of the farmer, and proceeded to show that protection on wheat, oats and maize had led to a reduction of prices Ben the farmer must thank you for protection 1 commented Mr Carty; Salmon Mr Irvine had not time before the House rose to do more than briefly refer to portion of the remarks of Mr Trenwith The mern but for Lowan pointed out that the Trades hall leader had alluded to the depression which had been experienced in England during the last four or five years, and that he had omitted to state, the depression had been world wide since 1860, due entirely to other causes than protection or free trade Mr Irvine remarked that the Unit d States, with all its great natural resources, was not free from it, and that the rich in that country were growing richer and the poor poorer, the slums in Chicago and New "York equalling those of london which Mr Iron with had pictured in such dark colour" America he added, was the country of rings, trusts and intrigues both politically and commercial!) and all these ills were being rapidly reproduced in Victoria by the protective system of the colony Meru be in of the Assembly are not to be permitted to forget that they are pledged to reduce themselves Mr Graves is to be the Banting of the day, and to show how the re pose tissue may be got rid of the fore shallower the treatment he proposes in the following notice of motion given yesterday \- that the law now regulating the election of members of this House is unsatisfactory and that a revision thereof is necessary and that a more efficient and economical representation can be effected by altering the boundaries of electorates provi ling that majorities and not minorities shall return members, and that the number of members be reduced to 64 A return was laid on the table of the Legis- lative Assembly last night showing the material used and spirits made at each distillers in the colony during 1884 compiled from the n cords of the 1 Excise department.
