THE GOULBURN CATHEDRAL. £1000 REALIZED BVTIIR ART-UNION. FATHER DONOVAN CONGRATULATED. Father P. J. Donovan, the Administrator of S3. Peter and Paul's Cathedral, G oulburn, has been Avarraly congratulated on the success of the art union in aid of the Cathedral building fund. His Lordship the Right Rev. Dr. Lanigan, Bishop of Goulburn, who is so proud of his cathedral, was the leader in these congratulations. Father Donovan undertook, to raise £1000, and he succeeded— no mean feat these times. Very properly, the art-union was conducted on Federal lines, and it is gratifying to be able to state that ad the colonies, notably Queensland, helped to make up the £1000 which Father Donovan hvs had the happiness to hand over to the cathedral committee. The ' drawing' took place in the Academy of Music, Goulburn, on Mon day evening, in the presence of a very large audi ence, including Bishop Lanigan, the priests of the parish, and members of the Passionist Order. The butts of the tickets were rolled up and placed in a large barrel, and in a smaller one were the prizes mixed with a few blanks. The tickets were drawn from the barrels by Allen Armstrong and Kenneth M'Killop, two little lads. THE 1UUZES.

In connection Avith the draAving, there Avas a capital entertainment, to Avhich the best local singers, instrumentalists, and elocutionists con tributed. Then came a speech from the Bishop. TUB JlISHOr's «HO*T 8TOKY. The Right Rev. Dr. Lunigan went to the front of the platform to speak, but the flashing of the lightning and the rain falling heavily made it diffi cult to hear his Avords. He said : I have a task, and not a long one or a difficult one. It consists of expressions of thanks and of applause, and to me - the circumstances make it a very agreeable one. I thank sinccrly these ladies and gentlemen avIio have given us so admirable an entertainment, and all those avIio have contributed to make the art-union ' so Avondcrfully successful — a Avonderful success, indeed, to realize £1000 and to reduce the debt on our cathedral to about £2300. Fr. DonoA'aiiAvorkedit, and did it' well, and his work and the storm about us reminds me of a ghost story which happened .in my own cass in Ireland about 4G years ago. 1 was then curate in the mountains of Kilcummin, county Tipperary. On a very dark ni^hfc I got a sick call. My horse was got ready, and to my disappointment I found the messenger was gone, and 1 had to go alone. On the way ihad to pass over a bog, and at one side of this there was a terrible bridge. Near this bridge, one man driving a cart had teen thrown off and his leg broken ; another was thrown off his horse and his collarbone broken ; another thrown off his horse and his brains clashed out; and such like. When I came to a short distance after pass ing the bridge, my horse stood up, terribly frightened, and I. used the spurs with all force ; but, instead of -going forward, he turned round in spite of me, and galloped back. After some distance I turned him round, saying to myself, 'Ghost or no ghost, I must attend this dying man.' I came to the Bame point, and the horse retreated as on the iirst oc casion. I brought him again to the same point, and as I managed not to allow him to turn round, he moved Bideways into the bog, ana alter a Little got into a soft spot, and down he sank, and became lived in tfre bog. I got off, and in striving to make him ?work put of.it pulled off the bridle. I hud then to go to some house not very far away to get help. As 1 came it o the spot on the road where thc horse -vas frightened, I saw before me, or rather at ray feet, the. ghost that did so much mischief. As I moved th'e dust with my feet it became as burning ashes; and there was the ghost— natural phosphorescence. Now, I with many -others am surprised at Father Donovan being able to recognize £1000, and this barrel as it rolled out distant tickets showed us something of his work ; as the phosphorescence showed me the terrible ghost. He did no injury to any one, for the work was good, and we have to thank him specially, as also all those who generously and kindly contributed to give us such splendid results.
