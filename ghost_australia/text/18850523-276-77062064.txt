Round the Blvonac Fire. (Poem for Mediation.) Bound the bivouao fire, at midnight, lay the weary warrior-band; Bloody were their spears with slaughter! gory was eaoh hero's hand: For the ghastly fight was ended : from eaoh aoul a whisper came: " God ot Battles I we have triumphed: hal lowed be Thy Mighty Name 1" It was beautiful, at midnight, when the bloody war was done, When the battle olaBhed no longer, and no longer blazed the sun, Calmly, in the balmy starlight, to repose out* wearied limbs, Hot a sound to stir the stillness, save the sound of holy hymns: " Thou haat given ua the glory: Thou hast oast our foes to shame 1 God of Battles I we have triumphed: hal lowed be Thy mighty name I Thou haBt givon ua the glory: Thou hast bade our troubles cease: Thou art great as God of Battles: Thou art beat as God of Peace I" Peaceful was the world around them: in the peaoeful summer skies Watched the sentry stars above them, like tho host of angel-eyes: Shone tho sentinel stars in splendour on eaoh slumbering hero's head, And the moonliqht gleamed in glory on tho dying and the dead, Rosily wore the uight to morning; oheerilyi at their heart's desire, Sang the soldiers songs of triumph, round the ruddy bivouao fire: Flashed their faces were with glory: Btrong were they, and brave, and tall: j But the tender tears of childhood bathed the bravest faea of all 1 Pensive, by the gleaming firelight, mate the lonely warrior stood: i In his hand a paper grasped be, scrawled with letters, large and orudo: In his gory hands ho graaped it; and the ten* dor childly tear, | From his manly bosom welling, bathed the blood upon hia spear 1 Silent wore the night to morning: silent, at their heart's desire, Watching lay the weary warriors, ronnd the gleaminR bivouac fire: " What's the news from England, comrade I What's the sorry news for thee, From the friends wo left behind us, and our homo beyond the sea ? " Then the gory paper oped ho, scrawled with letters, otude and wild 1 Little news from England, comrades: 'tis a letjer from my ohild," " From our merry babes in England, welcome ia tho news 1" they Baid: I And the soldiers lay in eilenoe, while the war rior rose and read; 'Little brother died at Christmas; mother told mo not to tell j But I think it batter, father, lot you said, ' The dead are well,' He was buriod side o' Mary-mother Bince has never smiled Till we meet, good-bye, dear father-from your little loving child I " Silent wore tho night to morning; silent, at | their soul's desire. Lay the warriors, lost in dreaming, round the dying bivouao fire j Horaa wore they, once more, in England 1 fniloa wore thoy from war's alarms I Hark I the sudden bugle sounding 1 Hark! tho ory: " To arms 1 to arms 1" Out from ambush, out from thicket, oharged tho fosmen through the plain ; Â» Up, my warriors J arm, my heroes! Strike for God and home, again 1 For our homes, our babes, our country I" i And the ruddy morning light Flared on brandished falohiona bloody still with goro of yesternight! Purple grow the plain with slaughter-steed and rider, side by sido; And tho crimson day of carnage ia a orim Bon sunset died; Shuddering on tho Cold of battle glimpsed the starlight overhead, And the moonlight, ghost-like, glimmered on the dying and the dead 1 Faint and few, around the fire-light, were the ] etrotahod, outwearied limbs; Faint and few the hero-voices that uprose in holy hymnB: Few the warriors left to whisper, " ThotJ hast oast our foes to shame; j God of Battles 1 we havo triumphed; hal lowed be Thy mighty Name I" On the purple plain of slaughter, who is this that smiles ia rest, With a shred of gory paper lying on his j mangled breast ? Nought remaining, save a fragment, scrawled with letters, orudo and wild : I " Till we meet, good-by, dear father-from your little loving child 1" Kaiae him softly; lift him gently stanch his iife-blood, ebbing slow i He is breathing-ha ia whispering-what ia thia he murmurs low ? ! " Saved 1 my ohild-my home-my country I , Father, give my pangs release: Thou art great as God of Battles: Thou art beat as God ot Peace I" Sahoeii K. COWAN, M.A., in The Theatre, '
