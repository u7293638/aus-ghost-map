ON VALE. (ARGUS. THURSDAY.! Mr. Valo seemed to bo of opinion that the country and tho Houso were in a very fever of impatience to hear soma authoritative declaration of his sentiments concerning tbo bill belore tnc Mouse, ana was adjuring him, as Hamlet adjured his father's ghost, " Let mo not burst in ignorance." Accord ingly. ',H unburdenod himself, thus oarly in tho debalo, launching into that delicious confusion of motaphor which is at onco the temptatioo, the delight, and the poril of tho fluent "popular" orator; talking about the measure " meeting the basis whioh would \- actuate him," with a sublime unoonsoious- ness of the nonsense ho was uttering. Ho signified his worm approval of tho singlo soat system, and darkly hintod that under the |)r6BCuu clGCeOral uCw UUfcrJ Wu9 jUSb u UtliU possibility of his being "crushod out" of a return to that House â€” a calamity which, al though incapable of being contemplated with equanimity by Mr. W. M. IC. Yale, is ono whioh his brother membors looked as if they might possibly Burvivo, howsoever poignant their sorrow might ho under tho first rnde shock of tho affliction. Collins street is always unjust to Mr. Vale. It will not acknowledge that he has any meri'. It forgets the faot that ho has brain, and that when be addresses himself to a groat public question, he is always earnost. It would be well for tho coloDy if the " loading journal" was actuated by as honest motives as tho member maligned.
