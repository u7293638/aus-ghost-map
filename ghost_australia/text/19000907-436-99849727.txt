THE CHOST OF CORTACHY. Many months ago I mada allusion to the well-known ghost story of Cortachy O.istle. Such a story is certain to come back to many people's memories, now that Lord Airlie — who was, of course, the owner of Cortnchy Castle — has met with his death. The story is that in olden days there was a young drummer who used to play for the ' Bonny House of Airlio ;' that for some reason or other he incurred tho anger of his master; aud that he was punished after the savage fashion of those far-off barbarous days. Ho was tied up in ins dram and flung from the high tower — such is the story. As ho appealed iu vaiu for mercy he threatened thai if he wore killed his ghost woultl haunt tho family for ever, and that after he had souaded the last post the would always come a death in the family. Story after story ia told — cotno of them oven of modern d;ite — to prove fchafc the dtoid drnmmer has kepi; his word. In 1845, for instance, it is said that a lady, ono of tho guests at the Casllo, while ahe was dressing for iliartor, heard the tattoo beaten below her window. She listened in surprise, for she did not believe that there ' were any bandsmen at the CaBtle; and when she came downstairs — ignorant of the family legend' — she mentioned her ex« perience. ' Who is it,' she asked, who plays the drum so skilfully outside the . Castle.' Lord Airlie grew pale, and every Ogilvy at the table showed similar signs of horror. Within a week the Countess of Airlie was dead. Not many yet rs later a young Englishman who was shooting with Lord Ogilvy — the eldest son of the Hou3e — lost his way, and wandered over thederk moor for hours. Sud denly there came across the loneliness and silence the long roll of the drum. When ultimately he reached the shooting lodge, the young traveller told hid experience. Young Lord Ogilvy was greatly disturbed. Within a week, his father, Lord Airlie, was dead.
