Gleanings. j GATHERED PROM EVERYWHERE. I (BY "ILYME.") " C'can on and gather up," A Faded Rose. I took up a book in a twilight room, And from the leaves fell cut a red rose, Scentless and wither'd, in the dim grey gloom, Wrapp'd with its tales of lon,' vanish'd woes. Glowing with beauty it once bloom'd fair, Stately and proud, on a bending bou .h. Queen of the flowers in the summer air, Ah, what a wraith is left of it now ! Tbe room fades into an old garden fair, With winding alleys and leafy trees; Perf um'd breezes laden the slumbrous air, And the soft crooning of humming bees. " Be true, my sweetheart," a lover once said, " For true am I as the sky above !" But oh, he is gone, and the days are dead ; There is naught lett in the world to love! The roses bloom fair on the red rose tree, In scented wreaths hang the twining vine, And the ghost of a day has come back to me, In the faint pale sheen of whito moonshine. But ah! What is this ? 'Tis a voice, a call ! And love has come back from days of yore. Love, with his beauty, with his tales, with ali, But the rose said, *' He is here no more !" I awake from my dream in the dusk of day, With the faded rose in the twilight room, Dead as the past as the swallows own lay, ' A ad dark as my heart in its shrouded gloom. Never for me will the red rosea twine Around the tree in the sweet old way, Never the same droop the clusters of vine, For dead as this rose is my heart to-day.
