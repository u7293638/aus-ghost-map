The lady is in marble or the ivory of the classics, but whei kissed by the Cyprian - King the god dees of love and beauty grants his re quest, and' the beautiful statue i gradually changed into flesh and blood If alabaster sires could be so easil; metamorphased ! The "Buddigore surprise is not yet over. Graduate the dazzling-Galatea fades away inh a skull as polished as a billiard ball As wonders never cease akind of Lor< Lovel and Nancy Vegetation sprout from tbe skull in the form of tea rosei that smell sweet after this blossoming in the dust^—they are sold for tw< souBeach. Talk about Darwin auc evolution after that! Those houses on wheels have nov become veritable palaces, rivals of i Pullman car. The ordinary dwelleri on a flat in the city envy these vehicles Only think of such a residence having a piano, and a servant's room I Bui this luxury is nothing to such penny gaff millionaires as the wild beas showmen, Bidel and Pezon, and ii another line of catering for the publii Corvi and his learned monkies, anc Marcketti and his wooden horses— quite a superior race to their progeni tor of Troy. Every night Bidel, aftei doing the Daniel in the lion's dei business, is driven to his country seal outside Paris in bis carriage and pair; the others have also splendid private residences, and their Victorias: not j one of them but makes his 125,000 fr. a year! And to think _a man will de vote all his country .life to be a bishop, a general, aye; ■ a member of "Parlia ment, and even 'a newspaper man, fqr a tithe ! of such a revenue! It is enough to drive a fellow to join the socialists. \- The excitemeni^^ufc J;!ie Pranzini affair is getting cooler J indeed since Qeisdor has been found—and' want ing—people are^vexedrtand^di^gasted that there is no denouement for the triple tragedy. And to think Pran ziniknows all about it, has {been per haps the boss in the crime and will not confess. However, the desire to keep his head, on his shoulders ,may : -excuse his reticence. In the matter b£ general crime there 'have been a few precocious youths, who are -under bolts and bars. One attempted to murder' "his grandfather, and another hi? mother.... Wronged ladies .seem to be abandoning the revolver for vitriol, but the majority of the out raged prefer vitriol; when they den sire'te/bp revenged .on a sister who has outrrivalled them. ; Everyone would be happier could ■witenr make up Its mind to depart for gopd.

Spring trjed to look in upon us, but winter rudely slammed the door in; her fiiee, and the poor; creature seems to be sobbing - under the re buff. She scatters many of her flowers, but these look pinched and sickly. , Universal suffrage is' power less in, the matter, although Tories, Unionists, Home Holers, . and An archists would plump straight, for the" rule <>f the-gentle maiden. It 0a oustomary when a dear de-' parted is cremated, either in Germany or Italy, to place the vase full of the sacred ashes in its till-day-of-judgment cemetery-niche, and keep it garlanded by festoons of fresh foliage and flowers.: While on .matters necrologies! I may mention . there is coming , into fashion the custom of bequeathing a certain sum to the vicar of a pariah, to insert annually au in memoriain obituary notice in selected papers. " The Paris journals now habitually keep the anniversary of their birth as a Bank holiday. Every member of | the stef£; from "Hamlet himself to the cock that crows for the ghost to return ! to bed, have their - seats at the common < ! tiHe.
