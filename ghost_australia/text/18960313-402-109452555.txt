III. In a few minutes we were on our way to the haunted house. It was a terrible journey, for we were drenched to the skin, and at times bogged knee deep in ruts and soft places, while the lightning played around us in the wildest of fantastic forms. We found Tom at the house ; he had been practical enough to make a fire in one of the rooms ; and as he had reached the old house before the rain came on, he was quite comfortable. He was evidently both surprised and annoyed at us for following him, but said nothing. The room where the fire was made was a large room in fairly comfortable condition—proba- bly it had been the family dining-room. We found some logs, and all three sat by the fire. A painful silence prevailed for some time, when I caught sight of Tom's face as it was lit up by a darting flame from a log he had thrown on : it was ghastly. Joe observed it, too, and asked whether he had seen any- thing. No he had not, but the storm had upset him. This seemed strange, for Tom was not the sort of chap to be put out by a thunder storm. Joe tried what a little chaff would do, and he asked again, ' Whether the ghost was male or female, and who it was like ?' Tom raised his head at the last question, looked hard at Joe for a minute or two, and then relapsed into his unnatural mood—for we had never known him to act like this before. It was clear to me that he had seen some- thing—or thought he had and I was anxious to discover what I believed he would tell me if Joe were put of the way—for he feared that irrepressible young man's tongue : ' Joe, the moon's up, and the weather fine ; there should be some 'possums about here, and on our way back we might knock over one or two.' (To be concluded in our next.)
