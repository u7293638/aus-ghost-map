THE WARRAGUL GHOST. (From the Warragul Guardian.) There has been considerable excitement in Warrgul, Buln Buln and the neighbourhood lately owing to a ghost having made its appearance in a gully near the farm of Mr H. Rogers. The apparition having been seen by more than one person, a party of four started one night to hunt it, the leader being armed with a gun. Suddenly the spectre appeared, when the man with the gun dropped his weapon and fell down in a fit, while two of his companions ran away, and the third, after running some distance, returned and assisted his leader home. Such an effect was produced on this man that we hear that he has had more than one fit since, and that he will not now sleep in a hut by himself as was his wont before he saw the ghost. The young ladies in the neighbour- hood are disconsolate, we understand, be- cause their lovers will not dare to visit them after nightfall. We were informed on Saturday last that a large party had been made up to go and hunt the ghost, and that the members of the rifle club had been re- quested to join in, but as the riflemen subse- quently declined on the ground that as the price of ammunition had been raised, they could not afford to expend any on ghosts, the scheme fell through. For the sake of the young ladies whose distress we have referred to above, we think some of our gallant de- fenders might turn out and see what the ghost is made of. They can have the ???? of the devil from this office, if they promise to return him as safe and sound as the mem- bers of the party who actually started to hunt the spectre last Sunday night, and who would no doubt have succeeded had their courage not failed them just as they ap- proached the cemetery.
