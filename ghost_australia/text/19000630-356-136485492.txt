A PHANTOM HAND IN A PALACE. One of the ghosts that are said to haunt various parts of Hamilton Court Palace, London, has reappeared. The palace au thorities have been informed by an artist that while engaged in sketching old Flem- ish tapestry in the Guard Watching Cham- ber a spectre hand, white and delicate and richly jewelled, has persistently Intruded between him and the tapestry. On the last appearance of the phantom he made a hur- ried sketch of the hand, and also of a dia- mend ring on the forefinger. The phantom hand is believed to be that of Queen Cathe rine Howard, one of the wives of King Herry VIII: History states that Catherine one day escaped from a room to which she had been confined by order of the King. and on hastening across the Haunted Gal lery was seized by the Guards, and despite her shriek and protestations, removed to her room. Since then the scene has, it is said been reenacted repeatedly by a tall figure clad in white.
