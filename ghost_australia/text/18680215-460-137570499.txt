"And as to those instructions, you have absolutely made up your mind, Mr. Wilding ?" *' .Absolutelyi'decidedly, finally." "lt remains/' said the lawyer, with one shrug of bis shoulders, " to get them into technical and binding form, and to execute and attest. Now, does that press P I8 there any hurry about itP You are not going to flie yet, sir." < " Mr- Bintrey," answered Wilding, gravely, "when 1 going to die is within other knowledge than yours or mine. I shall be glad to have this matter off my mind, if you please." "We are lawyer and client again," rejoined Bintrey, who, for the nonce, had become almost sympathetic. " If this day week here, at the same'hour-will suit Mr. Vendale and yourself, I will enter in my Diary that I attend you accordingly." The appointment was made, and in due sequence kept. The will was formally signed, sealed, delivered, and witnessed, and was carried off "by Mr. Bintrey for' safe storage among the papers qf his clients, ranged in their respective iron boxes, with their respec tive ownera' names outside, on iron tiers, in his oor»nltiBg-K>ojmraa if that legal eanctuary wen a condensed Family Vault of Clients. With more heart than he had lately bad for former subjects of interest, Wilding then set about completing his patriarchal establishment, { being much assisted not only by Mrs. Gold- i straw but by Teodale too: who, perhaps, had j in hi* mind the giving of an Obenreirer dinner j as «oon as possible. Anyhow, the establish- ! ment being reported in sound working order, the Qbenrmersj, Guardian and Ward, were Mked to dinner, and Madame. Dor was ; included in the invitation. .

This proposition in Physiognomy being new to Wilding,-he was at first elow t6 admit it, until asking himself the question whether ! Mrs. Goldstraw kept silence well, and remem- | bering that her face in repose deoidedly invited trustfulness, he was as glad as men usually are to believe what they desire to 1 believe. But, as he was Tery slow to regain his spirits or bis health, bis partner, as another '1 means of setting him up-and perhaps also j with contingent. Obenreizfer views-reminded ' him of those musical schemes of his in con texion with his family, and how a tinging- I class was to be formed in the house, and a Choir in a neighbouring church. The class 1 was established speedijy, and, twb or three of the people having already some musical know- ! ledge* and tinging tolerably, the Choir Soon followed. The latter was led and chiefly taught, by Wilding himself: who had hopes of converting his dependents into so many Foundlings, in respect of their capacity to sing sacred choruses, Now, the Obenreirers being skilled inu ticians, it was easily brought to pass that they should be asked to join these musical unions. Guardian and Ward consenting, or Gfctardian consenting tor both, it was neeeesarily brought to pass that Vendale'e life became a life of ab solute thraldom and enchantment.

Then would the pretty bad ice, the docked : itocking, and the silver-buckled shoe be, - like he., broad forehead apd; the bright eyes, fraught , with the spring-of a very chamois, until the strain was over. tfot even over Vendale himself did these longs of hers cast a more potent spell than over Joey Ladle ih his different way.

Onthis first occasion he had been seen to sidle along tho wall, withhis left hand to his left ear, until he had sidled himself into a seat pretty near the singer, in which plaee and positiob he had re mained, until addresring to Us friends the ama teurs the compliment before mentioned. It was observed on the following Wednesday thrift Joey's action as a Peckiiyg ^fachine was paired at dinner, and it was rumoured about the table that this was ferplainaUs by his high-strung expectations of Misa Obenreizer's ringing, and his fears of not getting al plaoe where he could hear every note and syllable.
