HU. SU to VICE O.V Til a lil ISLE IN UTA TE SCHOOLS LEAGUE TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS, Sir -In common with thousands of other Victorian citizens I have read Mr Service s utterances on the education question with the keenest interest I am sure Mr Service will allow me to correct him in one or two details, and, these corrections being admitted, Mr Service ought to be glad to find that the platform of the Bible in State Schools League is substantially that he has laid down Like him we hold that " the | religion of dogma must not be taught in the State schools, and we demand that the religion of practice shall not be thrust out of them We are the declared friends of the act We are pledged to the lips against an) return to that long tied ghost-the depart national system We insist that the religious instruction to be given to the children must have no denominational taint, and we hold with Mr Service that the mischief which has wounded so deeply the Christian sentiment of the country has arisen from a misapprehension of the term ' eectil is In the act it was meant to stand for " non denominational, in the administration of the act it has been taken to mean " and Christian While Mr Service, it is plain, approves of substance, all the principles of the league he challenges its policy , but he does HUB only because he misapprehends it 'The league has refused to commit itself to any scheme for imparting religious instruction it de clines that is-to fight for either a scheme of lessons or for the whole Bible What method of effecting the proposed end is best is a question, it holds, which politicians may be left to determine The league will accept any method , or, when once the principles conceded, it will itself undertake to formu- late a satisfactory method if invited to do so if a scheme of lessons be determined upon, Mr Service asks " who is to draw it up ' He seems to think this is an impossible task, and that here the hopes of the league must be wrecked Let me remind Mr Service of a fact which is conveniently and persia tently ignored by those who assert the league. A scheme of Scripture lessons exists which would be accepted by all Protestant churches, and was once officially accepted by the Romish Church It has the sanction of long and wide use It finds a place at this moment in the State schools of New South Wales under a system as truly national and " secular as our own Nay, these lessons were used under our own act during the first three years of its existence, when its administration was in the hands of the statesmen who shaped it line was it is true, before the days of Pearson and purgation before the time when the department began to clip and mutilate the books for the purpose of effacing the last lingering taint of Christianity, and adapting the lesson to the doctrinal ideas of " our Chinese fellow citizens I undertake to say that these lessons which embody " the religion of practice and not the religion of dogma, would be accepted by all Protestant denominations t and in them what Mr. Service seems to think impossible, is actually done It is plain, in conclusion, that Mr Service is qualified by his views of the Education question for membership in the Bible in State Schools League, and I shall be very happy to receive his shilling and formally enlist so noble a recruit Meanwhile, as a practical statesman, honourably conspicuous for avoiding the unwisdom of extremes, Mr Service will, I venture to hope, accept the present compromise offered by the Bible league Let the question of introducing undenominational Scripture lessons into the state schools course, to be given only to children whose parents desire them to receive them be decided once for all by a vote of the 1 parents - I am, c W H.
