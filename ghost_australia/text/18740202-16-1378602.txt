A NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE. A CORRESPONDENT forwards the following horrible story The inebriated looking hands of my primitive Dutch clock pointed to the mystic hour of 1 (a.m.), and all Brisbane was locked in slumber. Not a sound echoed through the quiet streets as I sat in my verandah mentally inventing pleasing little the sons concerning the wealth of my relations for the delectation of my friends on the morrow. The muffled notes of my landlady's chores, which emanated from the next apartment, alone recalled me to a sense of the world's existence, otherwise my thoughts would have borne me soaring into an idealistic paradise where mosquitoes and bad liquor are unknown. The domestic pets belonging to the establishment had long ere this retired to their several apartments, with the exception of a precocious hen and a decrepit kitten, which over- come by the heat of the preceding day, had gone amicably to roost to either on the head of an upturned flour cask. As their line of conduct seemed more sensible than my own, 1 resolved to emulate it, and retire to my couch. Most people contract a habit of reading-be it ever so far lines- before composing themselves to slumber and I am one of the number. Shelley's Revolt of Islam -a poem the grandeur of whose language is only exceeded by the impossibility of hitting off the author's meaning under a lifetime, more especially when he " hunts a third metaphor" lay on my pillow, so I commenced the task of laboring through the 2nd cause. Having accomplished some ten or twelve stanzas without less of blood, I extinguished the light, and with «faîntanathomaoaapereovoring mosquito, which I had just before Been squeezing itself through . bola is the netting and perspiring freely in tat attempt, I tranquilly dropped into the extended arms of Morpheus How long my sleep lasted I know not, but a sudden shuffling of feet on the verandah awoke me to consciousness I opened my eyes-all was pitch dark It was only by straining my vision more than was good far it that I could distinguish the outlines of the French windows which I had left half open Suddenly the rain commenced to fill with a violence that threatened entirely to wash away my fragile abode and to my extreme horror the windows began slowly to open as though pushed fro ii without by a ghostly hand My position it will be seen was peculiarly unenviable I was rolled tightly up in the bed clothes, She was quite net was tucked in with a master hand, and would take a good two minutes to undo, mv waistcoat, with £1 Its Od lay on the dressing table together with I am letters, on epistle commencing ' My own ducky ' from no matter whom , a box of Hills IT'S pill", and the balance of an old French novel, inter mixed with toilette effects of re Hy ' a most superior description " and, with all this treasure lying about, an uninvited boy about to enter the room What to do? 6-1 out useless ! Rip Van Winkle, in point of sound sleeping, was a fool to my landlady Nothing for it but to he still and watch I mentally resolved at that awful moment that as far as lying still and watching went, and doing no thing, I would come up to the standard of a Government detective, and I think I did I therefore kept my gaze rivetted on the window, which still slowly continued to revolve on its hinges, until I could just perceive through the gloom that it was now wide open I then distinctly heard the sound of footsteps without just the tap, tap, men would make walking on tip too-when a crouching form glided into the apartment I felt it brush against the bed as it went slowly, but surely, in the direction of my waist coat, and I trembled for my one pound thirteen and nine How to give the alarm? I was in a detached house, standing BODJO distance from any other , I had no clothing on and it was pouring in torrents I felt that, unless the burglar would kindly give the alarm himself which I had a delicacy in asking him to do-I stood about as good a chance of success as a prisoner perdu in the old Bastile I therefore continued to watch with unabated energy MJ papers ruBtled "Goods thought I, " my poem in six cantos is accepted at last " The footsteps then approached the bed "Heavens'" I murmured to myself, "is it possible for such capacity to exist ? Can this villain, after satisfying, his taste for plunder with the contents of my vest, now thirst after my blood's who have wronged no man's con siding, tudor excepted ? ' Yet so did it seem nearer came the footsteps nearer, till the form reared itself up by the sine of the bed and went as far over me as the curtains would allow so that I was enabled to catch for the first time, a glimpse of my mysterious visitor One look sufficed me the portions of my intellect that were not paralysed with fear were perfectly satisfied, and the cold perspiration literally poured from off me, while my teeth battled with a violence that momentarily threatened to dislocate my jaw It was a very long face, seemingly of a mulatto cast, surmounted by a few straggling gray hairs, through which a pair of fiendish green eyes gleamed in a ghostly manner, while a long thin beard of snowy white completed the awful appearance of the phantom I hardly breathed, but lay there immov- enable -the apparition likewise maintained the same attitude A few minutes passed thus, when I felt my position was unbearable, and happen what might I resolved to make a bound for liberty not daring to raise my eyes, lost they would encounter those of the ghost, I commenced quietly to disentangle myself from my bed clothes This being successfully accomplished, I summoned the whole of my strength for one supreme effort, and bounded through the mosquito net With regard to what next occurred, I know nothing, my memory is a sterile blank I awoke the next morning to find myself extended full length on the verandah in a costume that would have brought a blush to the cheek of Adam, with a gash in my forehead, where that portion of my anatomy had evidently come into contract with some hard substance, and the debris of a dismantled bed lay niece dramatically strewn about the floor On my reporting the incident to Mrs O'Fl n g n, my landlady, she grasped the subject with a power that quite startled mn ' Arrah 1 " she cried, " are j o Shure ye wasn't drinking" last night, that to did not know the difference 'awaken (ghost and a nanny goat?' that was perfectly satisfactory , nothing could be more so I strolled out shortly afterwards to take the air, and now already two days have elapsed since I have revisited the scene of my ghost I beg pardon goat story _ SELIG.
