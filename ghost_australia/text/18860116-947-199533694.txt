Doubtless ? the, lumper's and ?.wharf ' labourers work .is of a labour's kind, ,l)rit it is of a class which every man with ;a .'?willingheart and a pair of strong arms can perform, requiring, neither ,, skill nor .lengthened' experience.' , The 'time selected; \- for compelling-capital to suocuuib to the demands of labour- is also; singularly inopportune. ' So small are the profits of steam colliers at the present time that sonie owner's find it more profitable to lay them J-iip thari keep them running, and in Ade laide, .Sydney, Newcastle and the chief New' Zealand ports, there are large numbers ''if willing hands without work to do, who. will,- gladly jump. at. the' chance, offered them.' Once in. victoria these new arrivals, ?will become ' competitors in the labour market with the men' already here, with the result that' tlie market; for unskilled labour .will b'econio glutted and employers' ' then have it all ' their ? own way. The ' 'sympathies of th-- public are inihis instance, entirely With', the . shipowners' ; ./when ' the seamstresses of rMelboiyrne 'struck/', every one who was not , a' tailor or a mil-, liner . wished ^thein success, in . their en deavour to' 6b' tain shorter hours and a fair ' day's wage for ' a fair day's work, and as;a ?' consequence the ' employes gained the Vic-, .' toryl . Every one now thinks, the action of th? coal lumpers and. wharf men ill-timed , and grasping, and their ultimate failure is certain. They have really no grievance, , and therefore no sympathisers, . .and' public '.feeling in their regard has certainly not ' 'l-eeri. improved by the fact that the plas ' terers' labourers, have also threatened, to cease work unless they obtain a reduction of four hours a week in their period of, toil. They, desire to give their, services during forty- four hours only each week, instead of forty-eight as at present. '. Thus does the appetite grow with what it feeds on.., 'Bight hours' labour '' was once the cry, now it' is 'seven and1 a half!' .Who knows but , if the demands of: the iorny handed is now acceded ., to, the day will soon come when pay wil be , required for nothing at all, and.

' i— iever.!b'e held, for it is ;felt that our xepreseritatives : at the first gathering of ' Federal ' representatives .will, , be. ' two .dead-heads. This is much to 'be' regretted,;' not '. only ' oh account of ' the failure .of a movement which promised at one ' time to inaugurate the laying of the foundation stone of a great southern 1 dominion, but because the sight of Mr. . Berry .'advocating ? free trade views and a reciprocity treaty would have been one of the revenges the whirligig of ; time oft brings round, and one at which both gods ' and ? men could- have ? enjoyed a hearty laugh. If Mr. Service really ? had the cause , ' of federation^ at heart, he would at once cede his place in the Council to some one. . who would act under a due sense of future, responsibility, and be able to render' to, -.. Parliament an account of' his stewardship. I.i'The1, present Premier, oan do neither ?? of these two, requisite '-things, or at least he . does riot intend to do so. ? ? J , ????'?? | ; D.es'pite the dictum of Rogers, the poet \- i 'banker, who was - wont to ?? say. that -it re 1 quired !no particular sagacity- and only; a : . . more than common fund of- ill-nature to be a critic; the! doings1 at the Melbourne. .. theatres during the' holiday - season ' can liardlybe passed over by the chronicler of current events without notice 'of some kind. Evidently the intelligence and taste , of Antipodeari audiences - are far ahead of .'. those of theatre-goers in the old country, ?ui-'.for it is now evident that pantomime ^ is -' doomed, and that' Harlequin, Columbine, ??. : and Pantaloon- must: relinquish the stage : ; or start in a new line of business to ? avoid : ; starvation. While 'genteel comedy ' arid, ???
