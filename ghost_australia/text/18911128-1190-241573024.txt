THE TRIBUTE OF UNFAVORABLE CRITICS. Thcao are only samples of tho hun dreds of pleAsantthincs that have been said of Rudyard Kipling. Tho unpleasant things I have uot quoted, but, as an examplo of his power to compel praise in splto of the pre- i'udico of the writer, hear what the "Detroit 'rco Press" %ynon some articles on America, as seen by Mr Kipling himself. " Wo will publish there articles of Mr Kipling, because they are about tho cleverest thing that havo been produced iu that line for years, and also because they are the very best examples of utter unfairness to a foreign country that could welt be imagined." 1 suppose, inUirao articles, Mr Kipling was just a little too candid to bo pleasant. The Americans, I (ako it, are pretty much like the rest of the world, Australians in cluded ; they entreat their critics lo bo candid, but they hat# thn csndid crit.i< Notwithstanding because Kiplinc is thus candid, and speaks as ne sees, I have heard it ubjcctod by even somo of his admirers that Kipling's books arc nut fit reading for the " young penon," that Incomprehensible creation ot nineteenth century drivchlom. As a matter of fact, the young person is a myth. Sho died long ago, but her ghost walk, and imttcls otherwise sensible tteanla to talk nonsense. Ono of Kipling's striking characteristics, to which, atraiitto to say, littlo allusion has been made, is his mienao sympathy with dumb animals. As su instance, I need ouly refer to the elephant story, Moti Guj, in Life's Handicap.
