Till twenty-fourth Annual Exhibition of the Dubbo Pastoral, Agricultural, aod Horticultural Association was held on the Show Grounds on Tuesday and Wednesday. Tho weather was very favourable and the attendauco fairy good. There was a large number of visitors from the neighbour ing districts, and It is needless to say that Dubbo and its immediate neighbourhood was very well represented. Coonamble, Warren, Wellington, Orange, and Bathurst sent their contingents and among thoso to bo soon on tho grouuds wero Dr. Warren, Sydney, Major Bartlett, Syduey, Mr. H. W. Larrance, Orange, Mr. E. J. Mathews, Wellington, Mr. J. Hundy, Coonamble, Mr. G. Bruce, Loombah, Mr. B. Loo, Lirraa Lake, Mr. J. Morgan, Sydney, Dr. Slate, Sydney, Mr. R. T. B. Uaden, Wellington, Mr. R. Rouse, Biriguibil, Mr. P. V. Ryan, Bathurst, Mr. G. H. Macdougall, Balhurst, W, T. Hives, Cobar, J, Clifford, Welling ton, G. Roberta, Orange, E. A. Smith, Gloumck, J. A. Gardiner, Wellington, W. P. Mylechuraoe, Sydney, and many others whose numea do not occur to ua. There ia no doubt that tho season as jwell as tho lumoutcd death of Mr. Albert Mack, who was a great worker io the Show Committee, interfered a good deal with the attendance. It must however under all circumstances, be considered satisfactory. The receipts at the gates and grand stand were quite up to expectation, and, in fact, the gathering was up to the ideas of the moat sanguine. Tho grounds wero in very good order. The track was perfect. Mr. C. H. Fitsgerald had taken it in ohargo aoino days before tho Show, and thaoks to bis attention and foresight, thero was little or no dust. The water carts had been unsparingly used, and tho result was there was a noticeable absence of that aunoyanco of which visitors to other western shows thisBOaaon complained. The ground arrangements generally were good. Increased accommodation was provided for poultry. The shed erected two years ago was found too small, and us addiog to it would interfere with tho view of tho rlog from tho graud stand, it was removed to a site more southerly, and mado doublo its original size. The want of a proper shed for buggies, &c.;, has always been complained of, but this year the grievance has been remedied. Thanks to Mr. X. Baird, protection from tho weather, &c.;, which in past years wus absent was provided. He supplied all the necessary timber material, and tho Society only had to erect aod obtain the tarpaulius for the roof, Tho want of rain, of course, was evident, hut as that unfortunately is a matter bcyoud tho control of the Ommitteo, tho management can hardly be blamed. If auy efforts of theirs could have sut tho heavens weeping, it may be cortuiu that thoy would not have beeu spared. There was more thuu tho ordinary number of "sideshows" to the fore, and though the rigidly inclined may not view them altogether as teuding to tbe improvement ef the miod or morals — though they may not, strictly speaking, be calculated to instruct, they are generally amusing, and this ia an element which after all cannot bo despised. Thero were educated monkeys, learned palmists, true uud correct gipsies, and many other attractions for those, who like to vary their admiration of fat bullocks, good huckneyi. seobational hunters, aud monster pumpkins. The various efficials were at their posts, and tho .Secretary (Mr. Muncktoo) and his assistant (Mr. A. Schoeffell) were kept busy from the openiug of their room in the early morning till long ufter the ciosiog hour. They had to answer all tnenuer of inquiries and satisfy all inquirers, and they did so thoroughly. Mr. Munckton was everywhere, attending to everything, and his assistant never left his post, and was always to be found when he wanted.

Io the blood'section thero whs a fair show, and | among the exhibitors wore Messrs. Mackinnou, Murtell, Suttor, Rutherford, Joncf, West, and Brown. In the aged stallion class, G'Naroo, hy St. Albans — winner -of a Caulfiold Cup— »ml Aureus, > also a good put former on tho turf, computed. The latter is by Grand Flaneur, aud he showed all the quality which marked that sire whon he was racing and which he invariably transmits to his progeny. Mr. Maekionuu'n horse is a bit light in the barrel, whilst Aureus, who has furnished into a ruully inagiiifiount horse, was vory eveu. Mr. Martell's horse got first in his class aud champion. A very fioe yearling by Aureus took the judge's eye. He is uamed Sunday, and out of Muid of the Hills. He is a pretty chestnut, aud if he does not race there is nothing in looks.. The mares and fillies I were ooly a moderate lot, and the tieat of them I was a bay bred by Mr. Martcll, by Aureus from : Rebus. Mr. Jones had a neat yearling filly, hy Lochiel, and Mr. J. G. Browu hud a vory useful looking inure, by Kingsborough from Hussey— a uame well known iu turf history. | In draught stock there was ro&lly; nothing of very great merit forward, and in stallions Mossrs. Smith, of Cornucopia, hud a very easy wiu with Marshal Chief 2nd. while iu mares a very roomy, I well-built animal, belonging to Mr. Joseph Druitt, of Bellurbigal, got the premier honours. Before tho judge could decide as to the boat mare, he hail to put the tape on Mr. Druitt's biy uud Mr. J. Hull's grey. The former outnica»ured the latter in all points except across the hips, wlwro both were equal. Mr. J. A. Buokbind's St. Louis was invincible among trotting stallions, una Dr. Slate's grey — Silver Cloud -was awarded tho prize iu the female class. Little Narragausett — a real gentium an, though he is only a dwarf— was the best p >oy Ltllion in the ring, und Mr. Muinford's pretty ua paint Stella was fur and awuy the best mute. Cattle. Mr. James Holmes hud muttcro pretty much to himself in the houHed and led shorthorns. He showed some very fiue cattlo— thoy were an exhiH tion in themselves, aud could not be otherwise than admired. The Holm wood herd is now acknowledged to be the first iu New South Wales, and it is plain from the quality which the stock poss«'8i Mr. Holmes mesne to not only maintain the standard ho has reached but guiu a higher oue. Mr. Booth, of Warlaby, had a very good yearling bull in this section — thick, soft, and showiug much quality. Mr. Holmes was successful in all ths classes in which he exhibited, and ho ulso took tho champion ptizi-s. In the grasnfed sectiuii, the | i-veilty of the Mfaftmi v.ut sh"»wi by the condition of tbe cattlo, but too quality wa« ull there, uud Messrs. Hay, of Mariaobone, Tink, of Binalong, Booth, of Wartuby, and Stevensoo, of Terra Bella, showed soino vory uoat cattlo, A yeurling heifer, which came from Warlaby, did Dot tako the fnooy of tho judges, who probably preferred condition to quality, but no neater or hotter animal was in tho yards. Mr. Hay's cattle showed oil the characteristics for which they were famed in tho Wagga district, where they were purchased by Mr. Montgomery, of Warren, who sold to Mr. Buy. Messrs. Stevenson and Tiok's steers were vary good, though it is ourtain that if the owners wcro asked, they would agree that the judges made a mistake. The fat cattle forward wero very fiao, and tho fat bullock shown by Mr, W. A. Gardiner, of Ellengerah, and tho threo fat bullocks which Mr. Ihomaa Baird sent from Duoduliiinal were so good that ono would hardly bolievo wo wero puesing though one of tho soverest seasons experionoed io these parts. The farmers' olass was but a shadow— only threo animals appearing in the pens. A calf, bred by Mr. Holmes aod shown by Mr. WUkie, was tho ouly ono worthy of even a passing look. Sqbzp, Whon ono thinks of the drought wo aro going through, tho show of sheep was marvellous. The entries wore numerous, aud the sheep ultogclher a good lot. Thero was, of course, some rubbish io, but there was also rare quality. Iu tho words of Mr. R. B. MoMartin, the judge, it is the best show of sheep I have seen here," and his opiuiou was endorsed by all the sheep-owners who were presout. In grassfed, the principal exhibitors were Messrs. Hay, Marianboue, J. Lee, Lirras Lake, A. E. Anderson, Yowi, W. A. Gardiner, Ettengerah, J. Rutherford, Murrumhidgerio, B. Veuch, Wellington aud G. Bruce, Loombah. Cl iss prizes were won by Messrs. W. Hay, B. Veech, A. E. Anderson, W. A. Gardiner, and J. Lee. Thero was some keen competition over champion ship houours. In tho champion ewe, the judge (who called iu the assistance of Mr. Mulliuson) was in doubt botwcco oxhibits of Mr. Aadersou and Mr. Gardiner. Eventuallv. the former izot the award. Mr. B. Veech got champion prize with his ram. Iu the housed section, Mr. J. Lee, of Larras Lake, aud Mr. G. Bruce, cf Looinhah, fought it out among themselves, with the result that at the eud honours wero easy." Tho coarse woolled section was very strong, and, in tho opinion of the judge, tho shcop showu would bo a credit to auy how in the colony. Prizes wero woo by Messrs. J. A. Brien, T. Richardson, aud J. Tink. The Utter carried off the fat lamb and tho fat wcthor awards with something very prime aud good. Dogs and Pias. Tho dog section was particularly strong in numbers if not in quality. There weie a few good dogs shown, but the majority were downright mongrels. Ooc of the most noticeable animuU wus the English setter shown bv Mr. E. 1. Mackenzie. He is a fine dog, doing credit to his ire, Ripple Shot, an imported dog, which won everything at shows, and cost 250 guineas. The pigs were fair, but the competition was very weak. Poultry. Thero was a large exhibition of poultry, some being of excellent quality, but it is only fair to say that there was also some very ordinary fowls in the coops. The most successful exhibitors were the Bonavcnture Poultry Farm, J. 8prutt, W. J. Bennett, II. M. Hamilton, W. F. Wecln'S, A. Attwood, T. L. Whipple, W. Tuuhy, R. Booth, and L. L. R unsay. This year our local poultry fanciers were right out of it. Iuueed, veryfew of them competed. Agricultural Produce, Vegetahleh, Fkuitj, &c.; The competition was not as good as ooo could wish. There were some nice samples of wheat shown, and Mr. J. A. Offner, of Wellington, got first and Mr. E. A. Gillie, of Ballimore, second. Mr. William Urowulow, of Eumulgu, hud a really good exhibit of luceruo wheat, uud Mr. S. McFetteridge, of Troy Gully, showed some excel'ent maize. Mr. C. B. Gadeu'v collection got first prize, nod deservedly so, for certainly this amateur farmer has given an object lesson to ugriculturiHts which ought to hu of vulue. He exhibited 200 different kinds of cereals, &c.;, grown at Apsley, aud his trophy is creditable to his own industry, as well us illustrative of tho capacity of the soil. A protest was entered by Mr. T. Bragg against the first prize for wheuteu chaff and the second for agricultural produce being uwurded to Mr. Johu Murray, ou the ground that being a produce merchaub he is not eligible to uompele, the condition being ull exhibits "are to he grown or produced hy exhibitor." The Goverumeut exhi bit, in ohurgu of Mr. Martin, is shown in a separate tnatquee, aud is —as it was last year — very instructive to tillers of the soil. There is a mugnificcub display of urticlcs, which the ground can give forth, under the influence of good and scientific husbandry. There was a nice lot of honey aud products of an apiary forward, and the sample of raisins, shown hy Mr. Alison of the Fresun Vineyard, Butler's Falls. Dubbo, was, iu the opiniou of experts equal to the best California!! or Spanish. Mrs. Links got the prize lor bread, and Mr. Wurth of Mudgeu, fur factory butter. The eastern and Lhu western civilisation — " the "heathen chincc" and the Europeau cunu into competition iu tliu vc-tiblo classes, and tiny fought each other to a finish, I'lic exhibits were all very good, uud the priz-s were pretty evenly distributed betweeu Ah Kong, of Dubho, — who showed a cauliflower, which was a perfect monster — Mr. George Girdiuor, of Dubho, uud Mr. C. Vaudermaal, of Co>t|li«ggtc. Mr. Gad«-u, of Apsley, got the award for the collection, grown by an amateur, and he deserved it. In fruits there was a much better show than the season would lead one to expect. Mrs. J. UiJman showed some excellent lemons and orange", an I fin r cooking apples than those sent in hy Mr. 8herwood, of Tunbribongio, it would be difficult to obtain. Mr. Vatidermuul, of Co.dbaggie, had sumo excu'lent eating apples, und the paers shown hy Mrs. lUird, and grown at Duudulliinal, were wlthuut doubt the best seen in Dubbo for some time. The Dundul- limal poaches were also fair to the eye und no doubt pleasing to the taste, while Mr. Sherwood's collection was in every senso worthy of the com mendation it received. Some grapes scut hy Mr. Bucholtz, of Mudgce, and Mrs. Tibbits, of Myton, were good, and Mrs. Baillie exhibited au excellent collection of crystuiised fruit. Flowers, Fine Arts, Fa soy Woric, Home Made, <ku. Tho pavilion this year was not us well filled uh could hu wished, aud there was nothing very striking about any of the exhibits. The display of flowers was ouly the ghost of whut used to he present. Mr. J. 11-ane, jun.. was the only exhibitor in chrysanthemums. The fancy work wus nice, hut there was not much of it. The home made section was fairly well filled, but it ought to have been better. The Schools, with handwriting, &c.;, were the strongest supporters of this side of the show, and in fine arts some very pretty pictures were exhibited. In llunon-competitivo side, the exquisite neutral-tinted work shown by Mr, E. N Bl.ickrt displayed rare merit, and among the competitive exhibits was a very nico little picture by Miss M. Brown. Industrial, &o.; Onn can hardly say much for tho industrial activity of Duhhn. If the show of saddlery and buggies were omitted there would hardly ho any oridence that there were was a mechanic in the town. Messrs. Wilkins and Kennedy saved the district from reproucli, for their exhibits covered a multitude of sins. In the opinion of good judges the buggies, sulkies, &c;, shown by that well-knowu firm were the best that have ever in-cn seen here, und equal to anything Jiawn at n iiietrnpoJit in exhibition. Tho vehicles were well finished, built of the very b.-st material, and in the opinion of Mr. William Mitchell, of Richmond— one of the oldest coach builders and Ix-st judges in New South Wales— they would have done credit to any establishment in Australia. The work hut) a finish which is characteristic of first-class etablishmenta, where only the most skilful and experienced hands are employed. The firm's show of saddlery was equally good— up to tho motto which has been their rule— "we lead, let others follow." Mr. Ilunkti, in the non-competitive class, showed his sanitary cart. Trotting Tho trotting events were not of nny groat interest. It was a case of Wonhnhhio first and tho rest nowhere. St. L «uis won the two mile event with great eaxo, beating Dr. Slate's Silver Cloud, and tho timo wus 5 min. 10 sees. The first mile was covered in 2 min. dlseca. Mr. Bucklaud's Vnco also woo the maiden trot. J t'MI'ISO, Eleven compe'il orn cnue « nt f.,r the (j miter' piizc, aud iu the jumping ou the first day ouly about threo woro roally in tho competition— 1 Shamrock, Zouave, and Receipt. Most of the others fenced well, but the c" water jump proved too much for them. The Coonamblo horse, Car- rington, is clover over timbor, but he would not faco tho water, aud when driven at it simply climbed on tho mound and walked out at tbe oaaterQ corncrthus avoiding the water. The Ring. Tho show of buggy hursct, hackneys, Ac., was not up to what wu hivo seen iu previous years. The heuvy weight hackneys were a sorry lot, and the light weights wore ouly moderate. Moat of the buggy pairs were ill matched. Mr. Bucklaud's four- in-hand was the beat exhibit in the ring. The horses wero well inalehod, they went nicely, and the appoiutmcuts were good. Second Day — Wednesday. The weathor was again perfect -too perfect in fact —and the uteudauco was very much butter than ou Tuesday. The ring parado commenced at 145 p.m., and than came tho various other items of the miscellane ous section,— ponies, trotters, <fcc. Thu hunters were put through, eud tho blue ribbon was awarded to \V. A. Gordon's Shamrock (A. Orrcll) L \V. Fiiiu's Louh Marie (Owner) ... 2 H. Derrick's Z »u ivu (Fmn) ... ... f B. Yates' SmU Cbius (Yates) ... f The jumping was very good, un 1 the judges could not separate Santa Cluus and Z uiave for third money. The lady's hacku.y prize fell to Mr. Luigley's horse, ridden by Miss Fletcher, while the blue ribbon for the best lady rider fell to Mrs. Davis, of Gumhigai. In the 15 stouc hackueys, Mr, Liugley was first und Mr, A. H. Fearou second, aud the prize for la-iy'e bugg\ horse was awarded to Mr. J. W. Sillur's Wtlgn, Mr. Busby's entry coming secoud. Miss Berth' Fitzgerald got tho cordon for heat lady driver. The tandems wero wit a very t.-king lot. Santu Cluus was first and Forester secoud for District Hunters. For the Time Handicap Trot of £40, two miles, there wero five contestants, namely — Mrs. J, A. Bucklaud's Viva, 40scc. behind (Bucklaud) ... ... ... ... ... 1 Dr. Slate's Silver Cloud, 20ccs. behind (Dr. Slate) ... 2 J. A. Bucklaud's Hark, IOsccs. behind (I'iper)... 3 J.

Silver Cloud led till the lust lap, when Viva caught him oppusitc 'he St-iod, and both broke, and when they commenced going agalu, Viva had a good lead Silver Cloud came again in the straight, and u regular ueuk aud neck racodowu the running took place, ending iu the judges placing Viva fiist by half a length. Both first aud sccuud were loudly applauded. Time. 5min. 40-iec. Tho Ladies' Hunters' 1'rize wus won hy Stella, ridden by Mrs. Diviu, uud Currington was secoud, ridden by Miss Fletcher. Tho Maiden Huntcm' contest caused a great deal of amusement, smite of the nags having evidently been got at, for tlo-y were uot "triurs," u bile others thought the best way over the jumps was rushing through tlieni. II. Smith's Brow uie was placed first, and Stcvcuauu'e Nyin second. GATE RLCEU'W, &O.; Tho following acre the gate receipts : — jikst day. £ S.
