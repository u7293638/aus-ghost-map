The night before Derby Day caused a lot of uneasiness to those who had travelled a distance to witness the race for tho Victoria blue ribbon. Du das) the afternoon cf Friday a dust storm of gre*» V violence cam* upi, which left every . appearance of rain behind it. This carno down during the night la force, the consequence being that iu and around Mel« bourne, and moro especially Flemington, was a perfect quagmiro on Saturday morning. After daybreak it cleared ' up somewhat, and everyone hoped that it would reniai» . Ano for tho day overhoad if it was dirty underfoot. Lons; ; before ll o'clook tho Flomington-road was lined with vehicles of ail descriptions, giving ample evidenoa that tho attendance would be a largo ona« , Half an hour later, however/ the rain again caine down, and thia no doubt caused many to stop ai home. Howovor, the attendance WM .far fro: 1 being s> bad ono, seeing that the railway officials issued 14,481 '. return tickets, besides 433 singles, making a revenue ol 422393 4s. Of course tho rain had a depressing effect upon . ovorything. Tho ladies were arrayed in waterproofs, ¿a* which covered up their elegant dresses, and the lawn pre- sented a very dismal appearance. Tho flat, however, was well patronised, and the ono solitary gun»... tree swarmed with boys all anxious . to view tba' whole proceedings. , Unfortunately the whole of , tho walks had been covered with fresh graveL whioh having been well rolled would hnve looked ana . answered well had the clay been a Ano one. Unfortunately' ^ it was just tho opposite, and thot© who walked uponifc,fr and it was impossiblo not to do so, sank ankle deep tra'4 it. After the wrotched starting of late, the crowd hailed! with delight the appearance of Mr. G. Watson when ha' went out to send away the field for tho Melbourna Stakes, for whioh thero were eight starters. Eingmoslej! was sent out . favorite,. though . a : host of peopbj put their dollars on Trenton. The backers of Trenton were the fortunate ones, os tho son of Musket and Frailty... waa landed a winner in exceFeat style by Robertson b* half a length in front of Sheet Anchor. This last-najnscj. * horse Bhowod a wonderful-amount of pace, as he waa1* almost last at the homo turn. Just a dozen came out fox the Hotham Handicap, for which Leshia was best favorita nt 5 to 1. Little M'Dowal had the mount, and, handling the mare in capital style, won by a length and a half frc-JA Mentmore, who ran somewhat unkindly. As a matter ol .., course The Agent was sent out first favorite for tho weight« ? for-age Hurdle Bace. The coutest between the favorite, and Gasalier was a very keen one all the way, but The Agent pos- sessed too much pace at the finish, and won with Borne« thing in hand by a length.and a half, Next came (¡ha.... Maribyrnong Plate, for which there was only sixteen' runners. When tho flag fell Acme was a very firm favorita at 2 to.l, while Blairgowrie had a host of friends at 4 to 1. * As usual ia a short race, when Weasel has a mount he is first away, and when the starter (rave the word to go, Mad« .' delina jumuod away in front, while Halcyon was the last to inore. When half the distance had boon rontheraoe was all over aa far as tho winner was concerned, and sh« ; fairly cantered homo three lengths in front of Maddelina/ ; who boat Blairgowrie, who tired vory much, by a length. ' '. The running of Maddelina was a genuine surprise to hep . party, who thought she had gone off completely, and * would not back her, as only two days bofore Trojan: ~ gavo her a great beating in a five furlongs spin up. the ^ straight. It is very doubtful if tho placing of a sellifig '? raco between tho Maribyrnong Plate and Derby was a good movo. In fact it is doubtful if seven raooa aro not.tod '. much to have on ono day's programme, the publio appear« M ing to be amply satisfied with six. This Selling Bace, how« - ever, provided au excellent finish between Albunusi'Scara- mouch, and Solo, who finished in the order given. Then cam ethe Derby.f or which Nordenfeldt retained tho position of favorite, even after tho public found that he would not bo pilotod .by Tom Holes, who waa put ut> on Uralla. Thunderbolt had a good many admirera, and the ' Adelaide people stuck well to Isonomy. ? First Chester and Winchester . were almost deserted,, and ; 20 to 1 conld be easily obtained. It is not necessary hore ': to describe the race, whioh waa eventually won by .the favorito after a great finish with First Chester by a head, ?.? 1 while tho other.outsider, Winchester, finished third, Th« viotory of tho favorito was well received, and a rreai amount of cheering waa indulged in. In the finish Firsl Chester greatly interfered with the winner, and young Kelso "was hooted by tho public. However, the stewards took no notico of the master, and never even once questioned tho boy's conduct, as no doubt lt was quite accidental. Had First Chester won, no doubt more would have been heard of the matter. The Bohemian party thought they had a (rood thing in the son of'Maribyrnong and riina fer the Coburg Stakes; and such proved the casa, aa ne won very comfortably by a length from Lantern at the finish, which concluded the day's racing. Tho ofliicials, With the exception of tho judge, well fulfilled their duties. The judge, how- ever, appears to be a novice at his business. In the Belling Jiace, Scaramouch, who finished second, was not given =a.place for>a long limo ; and in the Derby Uralla, who finished absolutely last, was 'placed as the winner ; aud those who are not acquainted with the horses, and wait for thc numbers to go up, sent her name away by wiro to their friends as the-actual winner. ïielbourne Stakes, a sweepstakes of 5 sovs each, 2 ft., with 800 added ¡ seeond horse -to receive 50 sovs out of the «take.
