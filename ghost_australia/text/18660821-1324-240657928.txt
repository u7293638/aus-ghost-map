MORE OF TBE WARRENHEIP GHOST. . . The Warrenheip correspondent of the Ballarat Star writes : - "The Fahey Ghost Story is not yet dead, and strange to say a large portion of the people. of cource those of the Fahey type only, believe it to be quite true. The stories that are now told are quite ridiculous. After a great deal of persuasion I visited the house on Thursday evening and found some ten or twelve persons sitting round the recep tion room in truly Irish fashion, amongst whom was a traveller from the adjacent brewery, who, probably asking a lesson from 'Sam Slick' was nursing the baby, much to the gratification of the delighted mother. Fahey narrated some of the wonders of the candles, and one wonder in particular, that of a candle which was lying on the table which gradually erected itself on end, was lighted without human aid and moved slowly to the edge of the table, dropped on to the floor still on end, thence travelled to the fire which Fahey Classically termed hob, and back with a flying leap to the table, for the truth of which one or two of those present vouched. Some of those present were then invited to adjourn to the Phœnix hotel, where a 'shout' all round being dis- posed of and Fahey having quaffed his pints of Mc'Gill and Coghlan's last brew, which from the smack of his lips I imagine he enjoyed, I ventured to request that I might be allowed to witness the wonderful candle performances. This request was not granted, for I was told—rather drily—to come to-morrow, as I should see better in daylight. With a hearty laugh at finding myself so ' dead sold' I wished Daniel good night, and ventured to make my way along that standing monument of misspent money, the North Melbourne road."
