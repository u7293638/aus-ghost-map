(Erirkeit STEVENSON CUP AND MEDALS. NOBWOOD V. ADELAIDE. The straggle for the valuable trophies offered by Messrs. btevenson Brothers was continued on the Adelaide Oval in delightful weather on Saturday afternoon. The Norwoods had to play the Adelaides, and both teams were fully represented. Winning the toss, Giffen sent his brother and Lyons to the wicketB, Delaney and Haldane bowling. Lyons soon had the measure of the bowling, and by fine all round hitting the score mounted rapidly, Walter Giffen doing his share, though at a more modest rate. The century was poBted after less than an hour's play. At 117 Giffen was snapped up at the wickets off Winnall, who had relieved Delaney, and was troubling the batsmen. George Giffen followed. He seemed in rare trim, and Boon had 16 np. Then he failed to get hold of one, and was caught at deep leg— 2 for 153. BLINM&n; was badly missed by Evan off Winnall, who seemed to trouble him considerably at first. Lyons also treated him with respect for a time, but afterwards hit ont and Bent two balls well over the chains, while the finest hit of all—one into the furthest corner—just fell short of the boundary. At last, with 195 on the board, Lyons was well caught at mid-oft He made his runs without giving the ghost of a chance. Although two or three of the fieldsmen made great efforts to get near some of his big hits. HU score, which was made in an hour and three-qaarters, inoluded four 5'S and nineteen 4'S. Gooden and Liston were quickly sent back, and 5 for 214 was the record. Woods and Blinman made a stand, both playing finefree cricket. MoKenzie and Hill also bit well, the fitter making six chainers. The Adelaides fielded fairly well; Richards and Tardiff—who each made a brilliant catch—outshining the others. Scores:— HORWOOD. J. J, LYONS, C. EVAN, B. WINNALL 133 W. F. GIFFEN, C. HEALEY, B.

Umpires—Messrs, Searcy and Pettit. HINDSTABSH V. ROBTH ADELAIDE. The first meeting between these clubs haa provided an interesting game notwithstanding the vagaries of an umpire who evidently did not know the rules of cricket. Going in first, the Hiodmarsh were all got rid of for 144\. JarviB and the youngest of the Chittleboroughs made a capital start, aud the first wicket produced 89, of which JarviB had played in MB best form for 57. Just bofore he wae got out Amos clean bowled him, but Mr. O'H&Uoran; did not see it. AmoB, who WAS unsuccessful with the ball in the earlier matcheB, was bowling well, and he soon eent Albert Chittleborough back. Then Fred Jatvis was foolishly run out. Groves tried an impossible run, Jarvis told him to go back, but Groves came straight ou, the wicket he had left was disarranged, aud for some incomprehensible reason Mr. O'Halloran gave J&rvis; out. There was some wrangling on the field, but Jarvis had to leave. Groves and LeBoben each batted well, and took the score to 135, when LeEchen left and 4 wickets down. Rogers thru cams on again, and he and Amos RATTLED down the last 6 wickets for 9 runs, Tfie feature of the North Adelaide fielding was the wicket-keeping of Brown The North Adelaides were confident that they .could make the runs, but King and Jarvis bowled so well and the field worked so hard that in a little more than an hour 7 wickets fell for 88 runs. Hill, who went in first, though the youngest member of the team, was the only player who offered any serious resistance, and he carried his bat without giving a cbanoe. His play all round was very neat and augured well for his future. Darling also showed fair form. Jarv is'A 3 wickets cost 55 runs, while King's 3 cost 32. Scores :— HIHDMAKSH. A. JEL JARVIS, C.
