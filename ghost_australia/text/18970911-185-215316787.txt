THE TOWN OF BABYVILLE. It’s the dearest town, the fairest town, the prettiest town to me, Of all the towns in all the lands, this side or cross the Bea; It’s sunshine there, and moonshine there, and starshine all the time, And it’s never cold and none get old, in its lovely summer dime; There’s never a ghost or a goblin there, and sin was never known, And no one ever had a pain, or heard a neigh bor groan, And the birds sing always night and day, in fact they’re never still, la this airy, fairy, darling plaoe, the town of Baby v ills. The shops are full of sweetmeats, and they’re Bold for a mere song, The hobby-horses in the streets are free the whole day long; The band plays every afternoon, there’re fireworks every night, And all the babies toddle out to see the glori ous sight. You kiss them as yon meet them, and they kiss you when they go, And clap their hands, and laugh with glee, to see you at their show; The doctor died last summer, and is resting o’er the hill, For none get ill—they haven’t time—in the town.of Babyville. The houses are of gingerbread, the fenceß are of cake; There's a river fall of lemon, and a lovely sherbert lake. Yon eat whenever hungry, and you drink whonover dry, And pay your board in kisses—that surely isn't high; But if yon want to live there you have to pay a toll. Some pay it very readily; some can’t to Bave their soul. It’s not in gold or Bilver, nor yet a paper bill; It’s just to bring a baby to the town of Baby ville. You oan live with ns for ever, if a baby comes along; We want another-Bunny face, another voioe in song, For we all sing in onr village from the book of Mother Goose, And it takes a babe to teach you how to let your voioe out loose. So if you think of coming, just send your name along, And tell ns when the baby came, and if it’s well and strong, And tell us when to meet you; we’ll be waiting by the mill, And the band will play a welcome to tbe town of Babyville.
