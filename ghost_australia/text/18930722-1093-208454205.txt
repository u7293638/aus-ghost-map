SELECTED POETEY. FARMER BROWN'S CONCLUSION. Well, the first I heard about 'em . Was through some boarders we had, That talked about microbes and Buch things . Till I own I was fairly scared. We've lived on a farm for thirty odd years, And bin middlin' healthy, too; We've raised eight good, smart children, Which's as well as most folks do. But last summer we took some professors, And they made my blood run cold, For ghosts and goblins warn't nowhere Compared to the yarns they told About microbes that swim in the water And fly on wings through the air, That have feet to walk about with And can stick to your skin and hair. They peeked over the edge of the well-curb To see if the bucket was clean, And analysed the pertaters To find the Paris green That I put on the tops in early spring Afore the pertaters was grOwed ; Then how they thought it could get inside Was more than ever I knowed. They wanted our Tom-cat kept to home Because one of 'em'd heard a case Where a cat brought home a disease in its fur. Though there warn't one to ketch in the place. They went up into the paster. To see if the cows eat weeds; For if they did the milk we used Would be full of colic seeds. Well, after they'd gone away in the fall Matilda she says to meâ€” " The best thing we can do, Caleb, Is to let the whole thing be." So we come to this conclusion, \- No matter what microbes might bring, A little bit of learning Is a mighty dangerous thing.
