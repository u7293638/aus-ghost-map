GHOST STORIES. There are heaps of people who believe they have seen apparitions, or, at any rate, have had a ghostly experience of some kind or other. To the writer of the best account of any such experience that reaches us before December 7 one guinea will be forwarded. The stories will be published, but names will be excluded where desired. Not Awake Yet. â€” The municipal autho- rities have not yet caused the removal of an obstruction in King-street, though attention was called to it some time ago. While they are crusading against street signs they should give a look to this one. On one side of the foot- path by the tram line in Elizabeth-street is a lamp and signal-post. On the other a tele graph-pole with an unsightly fire-alarm tele- phone box, and the crowded traffic at the spot has to pass between at considerable risk. Some day there will be an action for damages against the council. Readers in the country and in other colonies experiencing difficulty in obtaining the Sunday Times locally, should send direct to the office, 109 York-street, Sydney. Subscriptions may com- mence any time, 8s per annum.
