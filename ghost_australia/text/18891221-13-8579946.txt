THE NOVE SEER MAGAZINES. Three political articles are grouped together in the first 30 pages of the Nineteenth Century. Mr. 1 Frederic Harrison points out how the transfer of political power effected by the various Reform Acts, from 1832 downwards, has brought about a silent revolution, by making the workmen the depositaries of power, bow both capital and industry have been to a certain extent mobilised, and how sterile a thing Socialism has proved all these years that it has been rang out its fierce conundrums about the wicked- ness of private property The Duke of Marlborough states the case of a Tory democracy as against the liberalism of what he calls the " shopkeepers' party," and calls upon the former to fulfil the great work which has before it-the solution of the question of the relation of labour to capital, which it is alleged the Tory party is eminently capable of performing, because it has no personal interests to prevent it from identifying itself with the labour interest. Mr M'Crackanthorpe expounds the principles and nine of the new National party, which is being formed by the fusion of the Unionist Liberals with the Conservatives, and urges the imperative need of unity in action and in organisation as the precursor of victory at the next general election Sir Henry Elliot, who visited these colonies in 1830, and saw Melbourne about a year after it had been laid out, contributes some interesting reminiscences. of Tasmania more particularly, 60 years ago, and his account of the splendid courage and coolness displayed by Captain Booth, the commandant at Port Arthur, cannot be read without a thrill of emotion Lady C M. Gaskell writes it lively little essay on the multifarious duties which the woman of to day is expected to perform, the result being that she is generally over- worked, and is fortunate it she escapes nervous exhaustion Mr. J. N, Lockyer relates the history of a star, as established by spectroscopic observations, from the first curdling of meteoritic dust up to its con- densation as a solid mass That America is destined to become the strongest and biggest child of the Church of Rome appears to be tolerably clear from an article on the subject by Mr. J. E. C. Bodley, who argues that the installation of the Cardinal Archbishop of Baltimore whom he brackets with Sir John Macdonald as one of two great men of North America in the chair of St Peter would be the means of bringing back to the church the great democracies which are destined to govern the world None but Italians, however, have been elected to the Papal See for a period of 500 years The He v. Dr Jessop warns the high church clergy of the Establishment that if they insist upon proclaiming their grievances be loudly, they may force the last to discover that it is they and not the ecclesiastics who are really aggrieved. In reply to Professor Knight's paper on Criticism as n 'i rade,' Dean Church vindicates the critics of literature from the imputations of want of com- petence and want of conscience, and exposes the absurdity of the assumption that are viewed should not undertake to criticise a book which he is not qualified to write Modern gambling and gambling laws are discussed from a legal point of view by Mr. G H Stanfield, and the only conclusion which the general render can arrive at, after reading the article, is that the laws enacted for the repression of gaming are full of inconsisten- eyes and contradictions, and that many forms of gambling have not been legislated against at all, but enjoy the utmost immunity A " Problem in Money " is propounded by Mr. Robert Giffen. It isustollows Unity that way as the ratio of exchange fixed between the precious metals and other commodities " The solution offered is this "That tbe precious metals all through, whether used for monetary purposes or not, are merchandise, and the ratio at which they exchange with other articles is determined in precisely the same way as the ratio between any other commodities " There is, it is argued, no practical interchangeability between gold and silver and therefore Governments are impotent to fix a rate at which they will exchange with each other, and, therefore, Mr. Giffen finally concludes, "Bl metalled is a pure delusion, and nothing more " M Monod a paper on the French elections in the Contemporary J'tmiw is especially well timed and acceptable. It is also re- assuring to all who wish to see a stable Government ruling in France, The voice of the people, as expressed at the hustings, has pronounced in favour of the moderate, firm, and peaceable maintenance of the Republic and Boulnngisin is virtually dead. In fact, it committed suicide when the General turned tail and fled to Brussels. By substituting the one member ballot for the ac ulm de Lisle, the Republican majority in the last Chamber withdrew the mass of the electorate from the influence of political agitation, and almost compelled the constituencies to look for men of personal position, with connections and interests in the localities for which they presented them selves. The result is a much better Chamber, and it is gratifying to learn that on every side there seems to be a disposition to try and find common ground, to set aside big schemes of general reform, on which it is impossible to agree, and to co-operate for the solution of practical questions, economic, juridical, or social, where co-operation is possible. " Slave driving by Public Com- panies," in the somewhat sensational title of an article by a lady, who exposes the hard treatment to which tram and omnibus men are exposed in London, where, as indeed throughout the United Kingdom generally, they work on an average 16 hours a day for a very inadequate remuneration, besides being subject to a system of espionage and petty tyranny, which has to be met by cunning and this begets dishonesty. Sir W. W. Hunter commences a narrative in four chapters entitled "The Old Missionary," in which he portrays some aspects of East Indian life and character which will be new to the generality of readers Writing on the subject of the modern music ball, Mr. Clement Scott condemns, in unmeasured terms, the harshness, cruelty, and tyranny of Imperial legislation with respect to them, and asserts that " the better instincts of the people are being crushed and state for the want of a better, purer form of amusement They do not want what is bad, but what is good. We answer," he says, by hindering good and encouraging bad when we refuse to amend the amusement laws, which are a disgrace and a scandal to a civilised community." Principal Fairbairn prints the inaugural l address which he delivered at the opening of Mansfield College, an institution whose exclusive concern is theology, its course post-graduate and its students men already possessed of degrees, and who are intent on devoting themselves primarily to the ministry of the Congregational churches. The address is an eloquent one, broad and liberal in sentiment, and insists upon the close and harmonious relations which must subsist between the theology of the present day and the spirit and conscience of man, as also with his complex intellectual activities and social needs An anonymous review of Count Vitzthara'a latest memoirs, which have just been published in Germany, indicates that they form a most valuable contribution to contemporary history, dealing, as they do, with the great political events of 1804-06, when Prussia rose to the rank of a first-rate power, and Napoleon the Third was completely outwitted by the astute Bismarck. Curiously enough, Lord Palmerston was deceived in the character of the latter, who, on visiting England in lets, had disclosed his great plan to the British statesman " Ce n'est pas im homme threat" was Palmerston's estimate of the future man of blood and iron The French Emperor was much less complimentary When Bismarck paid him a visit at Biarritz, and developed his views with respect to the remodelling of the map of Europe, Louis Napoleon, turning to Prosper Marine, upon whose arm he was leaning, as they walked up and down the beach, muttered under his breath, "If eat you." The Dean of Wells contributes an essay on Christianity and Socialism, in which he defines the latter, and inquires how far the former can ally itself with it; the conclusions he has arrived at being that Christians may not rightly identify themselves with center, porary socialism, as such that they must recognise individualism as a factor in human progress which can neither be lightly ignored nor crushed, and that the attitude of Christians towards ideas and projects that hear the stamp of socialism should be one of intelligent and watchful sympathy But the dean anticipates an evolution of a socialist character, which will bring about a general elevation in the condition of the masses On the other hand, he remarks that " the cloud on the horizon, that which made the brightness of the opening dawn, is seen in the Luxor), the frivolity, the cynical pessimism, the gambling greed of gain, the systematized profligacy of no small portion of our wealthier classes, the intemperance which yet slays its tens of thousands Our so called upper and middle classes " he pointedly adds, surely need the evangelist ing work of the church as much as do the dockers and the dwellers in Whitechapel slums " the expansion of South Africa is the theme of an essay by the Rev. John Mackenzie, who looks at the question from a missionary point of view, and claims that the evangelistic efforts of the churches have not only been productive of spiritual blessings to the coloured races, but have been attended with great temporal and political advantage, and by commercial prosperity. He sketches the history of the South African colonies, and expresses an earnest hope that the Imperial Government will not hand over any part of Bechuanaland up to the Zambesi, either to a trading company or to the Cape Colony, but will send out In penal commissioners who will promote European immigration and agricultural settlement " There is no chance of peace lie and, " till this is done " Mr. Mackenzie thinks the High Commissionership which has been bestowed upon Sir Henry Loch should be separated from the Governorship of the Cape, so as to leave him unhampered " It is absolutely necessary" we are told, that Bechuanaland should now have its own separate Governor or Commissioner, holding his commission from the Queen, under whose auspices similar work may be done for its increasing population to that which was done for the Cape Colony) itself in its early days by the Imperial Government A map attached to Mr Mackenzie's paper shows that the territory covers an area, roughly speaking, of a thousand miles in length by a thousand miles in breadth The last number of the Centennial Magazine presents a judiciously varied table of contents, and several illustrations of more than ordinary merit One of these represents a stained glass window, designed by Mr Lucien Henry), and placed in the Centennial hail in Sydney and another accompanies some verses on the praying mantis, by Mrs. Meredith, written with undiminished freshness of feeling and with a quaintness of expression which recalls to mind some of the poems of Robert Herrick Equal!) good, in its way, is "Suspense, by Miss H Gill, one of the best compositions she has written Mr G Parker's three contributions, entitled "In Child Land, are uneven in character, but each contains verses which are poetical in thought and musical in utterance and the accompanying vignettes also challenge com mendatioiL in the way of faction, we have another chapter of " Nevermore," by " Rolf Boldrewood, a novelette, entitled "The Castaway,' b) Mr D G Falk, and three short stories by V A Heron, Mrs P R Meggy and Mr E M Brissenden respectively borne recollections of Melbourne, about five and thirty years ago, are being tried by views of the old wooden post office and Collins and Bourke street is, from engravings published shortly after that time. An essay on the "Church and Modern Thought," by Mr. H L Jackson, deals with the inadequacy of the former to modern needs, and the imperfection of its organisa- tion In the opinion of the writer of it, the time is ripe for discussing the practicability of founding an Australian Church Mr W O Hodgkinson introduces us to some Australian ghosts, one of these being the Royal ya This is described as an "Afreet, Djin, sorcerer in human guise, who can assume any form, and whose tracks are anxiously sought after burial upon the mound piled on a corpse No Australian block believes that death results from natural causes It must be the effect of magic, and so for some time after burial a close watch is kept upon the grave, and the first track of an animate creature-be it bird, insect, or beast points out the Bo) I ya, who has been the cause of death, and indicates the direction in which to look for him ' A joint contribution by Messrs. Lewers and Cowle proposes the institution of a college or training school in which the art of wooing may be systematically taught to men only, of course Lord Grimthorpe a essay on church restora- tion principles, in Murray's Magazine, will possess little interest for readers in a country which has no ecclesiastical antiquities, and it contains much that is sure to bring the Philistines of the architectural press down upon the writer Mrs Kendal continues to communicate her dramatic opinions with the same frankness as heretofore , as when, for example, she confesses that she cries too much while she is acting, and that there are some scenes which she acts with a painful pleasure on account of the poignant emotion which they occasion her Lord Brabourne, who is very much of a book worm, contributes a pleasant paper on English county histories and tells us that out of the forty counties of England, only twenty six have tolerably!) complete histories burne of these have become so scarce as to be worth from £20 to be) a volume The circumstances under which Murray's "Hard Books for Travellers " were projected, compiled, and published are narrated by the present head of the firm, who was himself the writer of them. The recent exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society in London has suggested to Mr Walter Crane to furnish some account of its origin and objects, and of what it has accomplished in the way of restoring the arts in their true relation and essential unity and ingivingfree scope to their refining and civilising influences Captain Shaw, taking some great sires for his text, enlarges upon the absolute necessity of having stringent building acts in all towns and cities, and of seeing that their provisions are rigorously enforced A paper on eels and elvers, by Professor L Morgan, deals with the natural history of the fish, and defines the differences between them and their con- general Some interesting particulars are given by Mr Acworth of two of the great railway lines of Scotland, upon one of which there is a steam break down crane, which can work from either end, lift a weight of 15 tons, and swing it round in a circle with a radius of Life, and can move itself, if necea sure, while at work from one place to an other It has been constructed for the purpose of clearing the line of carriages and trucks after an accident The old legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus supplies the theme for an impressive poem in blank verse, contributed by Mr Lewis Morris to the English Justi aUd Slava one. Its concluding lines are especially good. Mrs Oliphant, who is as much at home in Edinburgh as in Venice of Florence, has written a clever monograph on Margaret of Scotland, which is illustrated by Mr George Hem, H- A The saintly queen is presented to us under a most attractive BBpect-exemplary as a wife, mother, and Princess, "a great and influential personage in the front of everything, and also a woman in the fullest tide of life, to whom all human events were happening ; who lived by love and died of grief, and reigned und rejoiced, and triumphed, as well as suffered and prayed " Mr. Arthur Paterson's account of his journey to Texas takes the form of a sensational story, which leaves one in doubt how much is romance and how much is reality. The secretary of the Dock Labourers' Union, Mr E Millett, relates the history of the recent strike-its causes, objects, and consequence, the substantial grievances of the men, and the defeat sustained by the directors Owing to the system of sweating, he says, the pay of the men was sometimes reduced to hall an hour, and very precarious employment at that He also states that neither Socialism, creed, nor politics entered into the strike be little is known of the ancient city of Cracow, that Mr. Adam Giclguids description of its historical associations and the antiquities forms quite an acceptable feature in the present number, which contains two other topographical papers- somewhat too much of a good thing-one on Bombay, by Mr W V Lord, and the other on St Michaels, by Professor T' E Thorpe Among the illustrations calling for special mention are those which Mr Hugh 1 houison supplies to John Gay's song of "How Happy Could I be Either" dora the "Beggars' Opera,' which are full of humour, Mr G Reid's pictures of Edinburgh and Holyrood and the whole of the bend pieces, which are graceful in design and delicate in execution and the same praise may be justly bestowed upon Mr Heywood Summers decorated page representing the month of November.
