disquiet, however, is to be found in England While the war against tho law is being wage by force and stratagem, disturbances have broken out in London, and col lisions between tho mob and tho police have occurred almost ere tho sound of Lord Salisbury's optimistic eloquence at the Mansion house had time to die away It would be unwise to attach too much importance to the affair There have been worse riots before, and tho only proof of flabbiness on the present occa sion is tho fact that a journal is openly allowed to hound on tho mob to vio lence But it is not surprising that when speakers are found to deliver revolutionary harangues, nn unprin- cipled paper should throw itself on tho same side. Both the orators and the writers will probably have equally little influence.
