THE HOLY GHOST. What are we to expect that the Holy * Spirit will do for us ? I ask this question because ;I have noticed with anxiety men earnestly praying for the Baptism of the Holy Spirit as a spirit of power for their work. in the cnuron or tne Uonnthians the Spirit came as power in the gift of tongues, and in working of miracles, but they were very unsanctified, for Paul said, 'Ye are carnal, for there is strife among you.' They had the gifts of tongues and of knowledge and of wisdom, but pride and division and unlovingness marked many of them. It teaches us that a man may have a great gift of the Spirit for work, but little indwelling of the Spirit. God's word warns us we will be as sounding brass and tink ling oymbals if we have not love, and the very spirit of humility and self-sacrifice of Jesus. Don't let us seek in the first place for power : we might get it and very little blessing for our Bouls ; but seek the Holy Spirit to come to you as a revealer of the presence and power of God's holiness and the indwelling Jesus. Oh let us bow very low before God, in waiting for the Holy Ghost to fill and sanctify us. The first thing in waiting for the fulness of the Holy Ghost is this, to say, I don't want the power which God will allow me to use, while my own sinful nature is still unsanctified, but I want God to take full possession of myself. If you seek the baptism of power, seek first the baptism of holiness — then the power will . come to bless. — Rev. E. S. God&is.;
