It. would be un Ktieoegsary indeed to introduce at this particular period of our history, and almost on tfee eveof a general election, anything concerns***; the pstf&histoiry; of this business. V dotheynoi in.- ' terfene atthe present "A -Jie *pfe liticai life- off the colony of Queensland, and if they do not now stand with the most determined and insolent interfer ence by trying to grip politicians b# the throat, and so manacle the polit ical institutions of the country?-(hear hear)-4>y trying to manacle them and legiron them, and I know this because I am due of those oil whom Itoey have tried to put political manacles, to leg iron so to speak, and to bind me down bv their own peculiar principles, and their useless and utterly' incomprehen sible ways, for incomprehensible they are, at the present. (Hear, hear.) It Is as I have said, both painful and plea sant, and I will try to mingle both to gether. The A.L.F, stands forth as a band of political reformers. (Hear, hear). I contend that they are na such thing, and that there is not a real political reformer amongst them. (Hear, hear.) AH the political reform they" have done up to the - present is to bring about endless disturbances, to build up endless rivalries and create interminable lawsuits, and now at the cpresent saa^^ihi" rows, an embezzlement, and a mort gage on handandon the property, they are waiting for morefohds to give tham as many as they want. 1 ; have a fall programimeoa hand. {Hear hear.) The first fundamental prin ciple of reform that is wanted in this colony, according to the leader of trades Unions in Gceat Britain and elsewhere, is a reform in the drinking traffic. < Applause.) Every person who has travelled through t&ese; cfclon-^ ies, some highly edtfcated,and travel led in the cause of trade unionism, ail of these unhesitatingly preach the doc trine of temperance. Mr Tillefct, when he was here amongst his disciples and reformers, enjoined, adjured them,, and tried to press upon them, in every way the necessity to always fight against the drink traffic. Did they do it? (A voice: "Of course/'.) I admit they do it in their own persons. (A voice: "That Is good enough.") That . is a very good thing "indeed to keep- sober themselves, but they do that for themselves. (Applause.) They keep * sober themselves, for the simple rea son, because they have to, "because it seems to suit themselves, and not'for an example to other persons. They trv to make neonle believe that. that is so. They keep politically sober for the political billets. Their billots would be" so precarious if they gave way to drink, that they would not be worth an hour's pay (Hear, hear.) I have watched for many years how far those persons they call the bush unions carry out the principle of temperance. I have watched it carefully for yoara in its principal aspect, and I have fail ed to see any way they have urged it,. and now I find to my astonishment that they have gone right into the drink traffic, and I will show you how. (Applause,) On the front page of this paper ("Worker"), the sacred Koran, you will notice a figure of a maiden with a lighted torch in her hand. That is supposed to represent all that is good, and all that follow that torch will go from darkness into light, from the ways of the benighted into the ways of truth and the just. It is the sym bol of all that is good within thero. But what- do we find in the bible tit reform? We. find that in this very month of January, in the beginning of the new year, the "Worker" newspaper discards creditabI©^persons in the State, that it tries to force , its members to sign a paper, and tries its methods only known to the vile-to undermine and destroy the reputation of persons who are better in every respect than those who run this t blication. We find that it is allied with BO less* than 76 public- houses in this colony. (Ap plause.) The "Worker" newspaper is now what may be termed a guide for the ignorant. Instead of being a guifle to the country, to ass&E; them ia what to do from day to day, to instruct them how to behave, they open the back doors and invite them into the public houses. They would find 76 advertise ment? for publicans instead of any rec ommendations to the working class that might encourage settlement on the land as a means of providing hemes for their wives; it is. simply al lied with the . licensed victuallers. (Hear, hear.) I am grieved to see that within the last few weeks the persons who represent and publish it have ott ered the political support of the La bour party in. Brisbane to the keeper ot a public-house. If that is the result of tabor in polities; if that Is all you have been working for" these many years, then I say it is time that heaven interfered in some way with labor ia polities* or I am afraid the devil, will T-f botL. This business, I may tea you, is of my own. seejdng:; N<k one urges me "to do this. No one.hafc the power nor the influence to urge me to^do it, but I tkke this ogfK^ufcfty to retaliate in Brisbane as far asl can upon the miseries of theTrad^s Hall, who; have, done so much to dlscredit me in the p^t It; may lbs - thought that because Mr Thbn^> Sidney laember for Tpowong, and 4hat Mr Mai" Reid is the person* who is opposing him ^^-Mat ';'-i ileid, v isk^ ^cUhg as political f scavenger to the Trades Hall, and who.:. is still scav enging--*h at I try to do this to injure him. I certainly would do ; this to injure him", and will try all I scan to injure him, but will do it in an open and honourable way. (A Toice; T "You have got no hope.") It reklly isnot necessary for me to attempt t» " injure Mat' Reid in Toowong. When. . . you come to balance the two-Mr Fin-; ney of Toowong and Mat Reid of Toor : wong, the mind of any mtelligsent per son must be balanced In favor of Mr Finney. (A voice: "Howmuch did ke pajlyou.?") What has Mat Reid dona for the cause of labour, and what have I done for it, and I have tried as bawl, to do some good as ever Mr Mat Reid has dene. (A voice: "He is a man/') I daresay he is a man. no one ever said he was not. I never bad* an idea that |ie was an old woman. (Laughter and cheers.) What I say is, and I will aek all sensible peopla to put it to the test, that Mr Thomas Finney has done n?ore in the cause of labour since he ' set tip in Brisbane than the whole of the Labour party put together. (Hear, hegr.) I do not want to make these statements,but when a misery like-Mr Mat Reid chooses to put himself tor-" ward as a scavenger, and travels through the country trying to injure me, it is only fair that I should have the opportunity of speaking up for my self- I say that the efforts of the whole Labour Party have not been ot as much ssood as the efforts of Tom Finney-(applause)-during the years he has b&cn; established in Brisbane. What do you think is going to come to this country if such men as Mr Fin ney are tc be rejected in favour cf men like Mat Rsid? What have the Trades Hall people ever gained, and what are they ever likely to gain as compared with a man such as Mr Finney who, In the most laudable way, has built up a business which has been the means ol employing a large number of people? What have the Trades Hall people Hone In comparison? Let us search in the sacred Koran which issues from tha chapel of Labour, where the high, priests sit antdi deliver the gospel.' (Laughter.) But we will search in, Vain. They have done nothing. As against this I arfc you what has been the gain to the working classcs through the efforts of Mr Finney on behalf of the half-holiday and early closing movements. (Applause.) If we «an show anything in which Labour has sained by reason of our efforts, 1 would be only too glad; but we cannot show one iota. When I was, to my sorrow, connected with the Trades Hall, and long before I ever saw Mr Finney's face, I recognised the good he had done for the people, and I objected to his name being used with disrespect by the people xfl the Trades HalL (A voice: "Can't he speak for himself?") Of course he can speak for himself, but 1' intend to speak for him too, as I would for any man. who so well deserved it, (Applause.) I say Mr Finney's consis tent work in the interests of Labour is worthy of the honour of everyone. It is a shining example and I am glad to be able to say it here on the public platform. (A voice: "When are you going to start your speech?") Now, I ask you how can people he taken: seri ously, who, like the A.L.F., attempt to undertake the control of the destin ies of this country from end to end (hear, hear! and laughter)-when they cannot point to any one thing they have undertaken in which they have met with, the slightest measure of suc cess? During the whole nine years they have been in existence they can not point to one thing in which they have gained any measure of success? (A voice: "They have kept you in your seat.") I may say I got on my feet without them, and can keep on my feet without any assistance from them. (Applause.) But instead of assisting me they are trying ail 0311 to knock me off, and their blathering idiot, Mat Reid, is running aJl over the country downing this man and flatten ing ^everything,, while the Paddington crowd are keeping matters warm tor him. (Applause, and a voice: "He'll wipe the floor with you, anyhow.") Let r him do it. In reality, however, while he is running about like a blathering fool, he is being quietly tumbled him self. (Daughter.) I tell you that you had better look after Toowong, for I am going back to the-house of jaw (hear, hear)-and there is no man 1 desire to meet there more than Mr Mat. Reid, with his long jaw and blathering tongue, where there is no push to bar paick for either. These people talk a.b» out socialism, and aU I can say is that there is nothing for them to do but to come out arid triy it, but these people who "aspire to capture every industry end jrcia th© whole country thenaselves. \ cannot even manage to runthe wretch edconcern in which they take shelter from day to day-4ho Trades Hall. (Laughter.) Many years ago, when the Trades Hall were respectable, the Gov ernment granted them a valuable piecp of land-Now we want to see the busi mess practice of these Trades Hall people--to examine their busings hab its and to look at them from various points of view and in various lights to see what they are worth. As far as I aanconcerned it long ago dawned on me that they had no business methods and no business ability at all. I told them long ag> that they had not enough business tact to manage a goat house. (Laughter.) Well, anyway, the Gov ernment gave them this piece of land Very wisely. After a while troublous times came, and the business which these business-like persons took in hand failed.,< The few old bricks and mortar that hung together proved no thing but a monument of horror and incompetence-a thing to be jeered at, and to remain as. an. object lesson to alL The Trades Hall people then got the assistance of Mr Drake and Mr. Charles Powers to get an enlabling bill through Parliament so that they might be able to finish their splendid building. They contrived to get ths bill passed so that they might mort gage the land and so that the high priests, Mat Held or Seymour, when they went' up to offer their prayera might do so with a snug mortgage over their heads. (Laughter.) I will now read; am extract frocm the parliamen tary bible (the "Hansard"), a book which, never lies, and which Is held in great reverence. In 1893 Mr Mat Reid, the man who was running all over the country cutting political throats, the man who said recently, "I have cut the political throat of John Plumper Hoolan, and now I am going to Cler mont to cut the political throat ot John Michael Cross." Now 'if ,Mr Mat Reid will take my advice, he will stop at Home and file off the fetters from his own political ankles. In 1893 Mat Reid crawled to Sir Thomas M'llwraith to beg him not tQ oppose the enabling bill-he crawled, so to speak, to boodledum, so that they coulr! get the bill through and get the £2:709 on their mortgage. Now, persons who choose to lecture others, either public ly or privately, ought at any rate to be free from blot themselves. (Hear, hear.) Well, during the passage of the enabling bill through Parliament, in 1893, Mr Mat Redd used these words, "The unions are the _ proprietors, and the delegates are the agents to look af ter the business." He stated that the money, the £2,768 15/6-I do not know what the sixpence is for, but I suppose. it is necessary in the case of a trades union-(laughter)-that that sum was "a debt due to rthe unione which have lent the money unconditionally to the board ot management, and it will ha paid with interest added when all oth er debts are paid off." (Laughter.) Who would believe that those words had been .used if it were not that it is shown in the parliamentary volume wMch never lies that they were actu ally uttered by this political cut-throat; but I unhesitatingly say that it is true, because I was his leadfer at the time. I say it was only a piece of political bamboozle. The unions did not give the money at all,but it was given, by one of the mortgage companies in the city-and it remains there to- day. Mr Mat Reid when he used those words made a statement which was either wilfully deceptive or else he did not know what he was talking about The. Trades 'Hall was nothing but a dis graceful sham, and there is not a de cent workman's money there. (A voice: 'It's a lie.") The unions who had supported it had left, and the last had left it heavily in debt. "How the Interest on the mortgage is being paid is a matter of mystery, but I suppose it is being paid, or the mortgagciee would have taken it over. Quite: re cently they had paid off . £500 of the amount of the mortgage, but , the Trades Hall people have not had. the temerity to tell us where that money came from. Well, 111 teal you where it came from. They got it from the Government. <l*Hid laughter.) Where should any P~nQ be got to pay off a mortgage but from the Government? They got It, and It was this way. The Trades Hall is supposed to be on a tun nel, and the tunnel is supposed to be under the Trades Hall./. (Laughter.) Ft Is a great pity the Trades Hall is not In the tunnel-(laughter)-and that there is not a back and a Mde entrance, and an escage valve for superfluous gas. (Loud laughter.) Well, they got thiis £o00 from the Government because they were supposed to have propped up this^fcoaiiiel, and that is the only smart pieee of business I have wer known them to do. (Laughter.) These people who. want to control the meatworks, and to control the land, and to control the. whole people of the colony-who want to regulate what everyone should eat and what everyone should driiik. sgid lio^ long they should. work, and what money. they should receive-these people. ^negotiated this .£500 from the Government on the strength of a: £50 pill-that Is to say they spent £50 on mortar and got £500 on it. Now my plan is to turn the Trades Hall into a market hall! It Is worth a pound or two that they he got rid of. The unions are all out West, and why do not these people go out and follow them? The unions control the Labour Party, tmd if th* Labour Party -control the Government we should all be controlled by the Trades Hall. It is said that the camp ers-out who "doSS" in tho Sydney Do^ main control the Active Service Bri gade!, and that the Active Service Bri gade controls the Labour Party, that the Labour Party controls Mr G. H. Reid, who in turn controls the Gov ernment-so that, in rp.ji.Titv it |o th*> Domain dossers who control. 4iie, Gov ernment. Now let us look for a mo ment at the finances of the Trades Hall. Th'e annual revenue of this coil trolling body is something over £3,000. L»et us look how this is spent. I will not go into the disbursements for kero sene, stationelry, telegrams, and the like. We find that Curias, of Hugh endem, gets £200 a year and travelling expenses; Kewley, of Longtreach, gets £200,. Jand B. T. Brennanu late of Charleville, gets £200, all with travel ling expenses on a liberal scale. (Laughter.) "''Then we find that Mat Reid, the political cut-throat, gets £200 with travelling expenses-he's not do ing too bad-it's just as good as being member for Toowong if it was not for a matter of ambition. You see there is no necessity for him to buy tailor made clothes, as he will have to do if he gets in Parliament-it's Just a matter of spending 4/6 for a pair of blucher boots. 3/6 for a pair of mole skins, and sticking your heels into the ribs of an old house, away he goes. Then we find that Dave Bowman, gets £200, Mr Hinchcliffegets £300,Sey mour £200, and thegreat FTiggs, their man of brains, formerly got £200,- but now, in consequence of the alliance with the licensed victuallers, his salary has been raised to the munificent suim of £4/1-0/ per week. That is the re sult of the alliance with the publicans -the blending of grog and literature, swipes and sentiment. (Laughter.) The rest is made up of petty cash, sun dries, and office expenditure. Now you will ask: where does the bushman come in ?-the A.W.U. man who sometimes has not a tent to cover him, and whose sole possessions are a worn-out blank et and an eighteen-penny billy? Where does the W. P. O. and the Q, S.^S. come in ? Thev ccme in where they / ought to come in^ They get a ticket-a ticket for soup. (Laughter.) I say it is the duty of the people to rise up in arms against this dominant and domineering clique (Applause.) These persons want to run the whole country, though, they have shown themselves incapable of running their own little tin-pot show. These men who could not get a decent living 1>y their own labour, and can only live by getting it out of the sweat of others. They have abandon ed their temperance principles, and" their aole virtue now is their personal sobriety. (A. voice; "That's a good d :al.") T«s, it Is a great deal, but it ought to go further. Instead of their supporting temperance principles, we now find that they Have the ad\wtaee iments of 75 publifr- boxiees in their jour^ naL I eay againthey are not fit to run anything: I know that I myself am not fit-then how can people think that -these ignorant and incapable per sons can do it? (A voice: "How many hotel advertisements have you got in your paper?") I am not going to sub mit to having any manacles put. oa ma I was born in Australia, and I haver found. it free country-(applause) a"' country of boundless liberty, X have never quarrelled with anyone before la such a way that it could not he patched up-but X at any rate will not submit to the merciless tyrannical wretches who run theTra,des HalL Rather than that I would go out and perish in the trash! alone, and leave my jbones "un wept, unhonoured,and unsung." At the close of his address-Mr Hool an was accordedloud and prolonged applause. It was continued - until Mr Hqplan came forward and bowed tils acknowledgments. A voice from the audience asked Mr Hoolan why lie did not go to Toowong, whesreupon thdt gentleman replied, "I shall be in Too wong soon enough. Toowoog oor-taiiis a cemetery, and1 you Can . lce^ -that old walking ghost there" _(Laughter.) Ck®rge Baiiies then sang an Irish comic number, "Brannigau," after which "Mr St Glair" delivered .a skit on an address to the electors by the en dorsed Labour candidate for Carnar von, which appeared to highly amuse the audience. Mr George Baines then gave another topical tong which had reference to the result of the forthcoan ing election in Toowong and" the sup posed defeat of Mr Mai: Reid. Mr Bott ger brought the programme to a close by singing "The Old Brigade." ? .. Mr Hoolan announced that during the month political ? lectures would be given, and; a low price of admission charged. The lectures would-be enliv ened by illustrations off the candidates in the different stages of the contest On the return of the Premier business would commence in earnest, and as the electors of- Brisbane North had kept very quiet so far, he. advised them to wake up and not let the Trades Hall take the %ind out of their sails. (Ap plause) The gathering then broke up. 13iere Is another case of scarlet fever, (the third,]! this time aa adult, residing in Hackett Terrace. .He has been removed to thef house when© the other patients are, thus keepingall the «ases together.
