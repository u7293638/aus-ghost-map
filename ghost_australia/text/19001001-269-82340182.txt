The f^c^tftioii declared those assertions to be Ubsllbus in character, contrary to historical'#$cts, arid repug nant to a community enjoying the In estimable blessings Jfchat the Protestant Reformation had secured to our nation, and the* world. \ A great .number of speeches of a forcible character were. Imade in the course of the meeting, which was characterised by much en thusiasm. An oversow meeting was held in the Pij& Street Congregational Church,_ at which the same resolutions were adopted. The following is the portion of Arch bishop Redwood's written sermon, , which led to the holding of the meet ing:-'The leaders and founders of pro' testantism-Luther, Calvin, and Zwing li, etc.-were notorious for their yicee. n . .

I did ?i r not think it necessary to take it out of the proof, sheets which I handed to th? . :<pms. But, as I say, the words corn \- plainedof were not uttered by me in -; theCathe&raL; Referring to the Protestant dissent ~ to Archbishop Ttedvrood's remarks, Car dinal Moran, speaking at 'a meeting' of the-Catholic Guild in Sydney, said: 'Generally th«y desired to make known \- the Catholic principle^, and to remove |h© mist which had tor so. long coneeal 1 e& the teachings of the Church and her : ajspirsitions from their separated breth ren. During the last week some of . their separated brethren seemed to have taken offence at something which . ought not to hare offended them at all. This mninded him of an ajthlete who. \- referring to his antagonist, said-that he hit him high, and he "roared, and. he hit him low and he roared, and he was hard to . please. He thoughtit was so \- with someof" their crities. (Laughter.) No matter what:yotr jBaid, they niusC shew their biie and rancour, for they had little else to l^reu. Catholics could * nott help to ^hrow any light into these misguided minds,, but they desired to bring home to every man in this com munity the true features of Catholic' principles. . r (Applause.) , . .
