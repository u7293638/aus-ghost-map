TEAOHING OF THE APOSTLES Philotheos Brycnnois, Bishop of Nicomedis' has published a document, which dates from the first halfof the century. It is entitled the "Teaching of the Apostles," and is about the length of the Epistle to the Galatians. Its name has long been known to scholars, since it is quoted in several of the Church Fathers, by whom it is assigned a high rank, though not belonging to the Canon. "Tile peculiarity of the book is increased by the fact that it is the oldest book of Church order that is known." "It will have to be our guide in the future in our treatment of 'apostles,' 'prophets,' 'teachers,' bishops anti deacons." "It is a first class document for the history of thie constitution of the Cilurh and for the history of worship." One paragraph of this document, which relates to baptism, read as follows:-Bat as to baptism, baptise thus: Baptise after thou ]hast imparted all the above doctrines (the moral teachings of chapters i-vi), in the name of tihe Father and of the Son and of the iHoly Ghost, in flowing water. If, however, thou hast no flowing water, then baptise witlh other water ; if there be no cold at hand, with warm. But if thou hant neither, then sprinkle the Ihead three times with water in the name of the Father rind of the Son and of the Ioly Ghost. Bat before the baptism, the baptiser and the baptised are to fast. Thou shalt command the baptised to fast a day or two before huash
