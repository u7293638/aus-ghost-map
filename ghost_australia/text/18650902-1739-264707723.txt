CLABEKCE VERSUS CAMBRIDGE. To the Editor of the Advertiser. SIR,—I have read with much interest, and, I may aid, instruction, t lie rejoinder of the hon member for Cambridge to the hon member for Clarence, The political capacity and integrity of the former contrast strongly with those of the latter. In fact so severe is the cistigatioti which haB been inflicted on the member Jo* Clarence, that to refer to the subject must be rather galling to him. Nevertheless, as au elector of Cambridge. I must ask permission for the insertion of a few remarks on the correspondence referred to. It is apparent, in the first place, Mr Lewis thought he had caught a weasel asleep, and no doubt expected to make a rich politieai harvest out of the circumstance. In this he has been foiled by his longer headed compeer, anil for a time at lea9t visions of greatness and grandeur have been swept from the covete 1 grasp of the representative of Clarence. It is an Englishman's privilege to grumble at taxation, it matters not in what form it is exhibited whether direct or indirect—whether taken off or transferred from one article to another. It is like Macbeth's ghost, " it comes in such a questionable shape"—but anon. There is no doubt the time is coming when a tax on wool, a poor rate, and other rates will have to be imposed. But that particular moment has not yet arrived, Bnd therefore it is has been necessary to adopt other means of meeting the expenditure of tile Country. And here comes the enquiry—" What lias Clarence to complain of in the present arrangement f" L9000 for the Sorell Causeway, a id L2000 for the Cambridge Boad, will be an outlay very far more beneficial and important to Clarence ilian withholding from it one year's insignificant road contribution. Of coarse Mr Lewis knows this;Jand it is a pity, therefore, that, whilst lie would have his constitncncy believe he was straining at a gnat, he had actually swallowed a camel. OBJEBVAM,
