A Chinese Chost. THE ghost of a Chinaman is having lots of fun near the town of Prcslar, Washington. It is about 20 years since a Chinaman was murdered for his gold, and when his friends came from a distance to claim his boiy, with the intention of sending it to China for final burial, all that they could find was his bead. At that time there were a number of Mon golian miners in the neighborhood, and gold bad been found in paying quantities. The murdered miner, it was known, had 1,200 dollars in gold in his possession just before bis death. Records fail to show that there were any supernatural visitations until a few weeks ago; but lately, since the graders of the Spokane and northern railroad com menced grading the oli placer field, the headless chinaman has been seen by reliable men and by several parties. The first to meet him were two Swedes, who camped near the haunted spot by the old tumbled down China cabin. Their blanket was jerked off them during the night, when they saw the hideous object. They ran yelling from the spot. One of them ran up the mountain side, and has not been seen since. The other shoeless and hatless, with a white, scared face, dashed madly into Tom Bush's cabin, and nothing would induce him to return to the place whence be came. Since then, tools, carts and wheelbarrows are disturbed or thrown into the river. Groans and stuttering Chinese talk have been beard here by reliable witnesses. It is an even bet that the Chinese ghost will break up the camp. New York paper.
