Mr. Ladd made a second visit to jlafcelwood Heights, on the .;afternoon pf'tfc^;day'loUoiying his first call, and stated to Mrs.Plympton that1 he had had an important interview with the opposing counsel, and also 'with Mir. Basil Sltredith. , 'Mr. BasiJ Meredith !' Inez interposed, sharply. ' What has hetodo with this matter,?' ? ' Ah, pardon me.

After a moment she drew, herself haughtily erect. ' Really, Mr, Ladd, it almost seems that you are arguing in favour pf the interests of the opposing party,' she said in a tone of cold displeasure. ' I am not, madam, I assure you,' he returned, colouring deeply at the' slur ; '' I am arguing for your {interests alone; for, as I have already told you, I do riot see the ghost of a chance in this con test. If the case should come to trial, I am very much afraid ' that I could not save you from ex piating a crime; and' for* the, sake of your late husband, who was my friend as well as my client, I would save the nanic of Plymptoti from. that dis grace.' . ' ? . ; ' Very well,' Inez haughtily responded, ' since you' so 'strongly urge it, I will consider the matter of; settlement. ? .Upon what terms, will they settle/' Upon such terms as the law allows every widow — iright of dower.' ,' Really, Mrs. Ruth is. making a bold stroke for a bigstabp !'?' Inez interrupted, in a towering pas sion. , . .' I will pot consent to it,' shg crled, starting to- her'- feet ; ' I will not submit ' to anything - so monstrous. My husband intended that I should have the whole; of his property,; he utterly repu diated thiij girl and her child, and.it was understood 'when I married him that I should have every thing.' ?'That may^be very true, Mrp. Plympton,' said the lawyer ; ' but if such' was his' wish, he should havfc made a- will tP that effect.' '?fle did not think it necessary,' Inez said.' ' He was in perfect health until a' few hours, before he died, and was looMng for ward to the prospect of anlheir to saoceed to his property.'. ? ' ' All the same, it was a very unwise omission not to either settle a handsome sum upon you, or make a: will in .your .favour.

Apparently she was in the best of spirits. She was gracious; affable, blooming, and greeted her counsel as if she had never, known a ruffle of temper or the oocasion of an outbreak of passion. ? Yes,. she said, she. had. come to tell him that ' she would ' settle but she would like to propose ' that a stated sum be |given her, rather than what would be likely to accrue to her from her dowager right to one-third of the estate ;;for she was going abroad to live, and such an . aiTangement would be much more tonvsnrent for her. Besides, since doubtless there would always be an unpleasantness betvfeen the two branches of the- family, a final ' settlement would bb much mere agreeable than tp extend, their business relations indefinitely. She would 6-lso ^ke to ask, as a favor, that she be allowed, to reinein at Hazelwood Heights, until slie was ready to sail, which would not be until abort t the first of October, as something had oc curred !to ; interfere ? with her plans ; a change previous to that would necessitate u great deal pf trouble and expense to ner, while she would en ga^e to leave every thing about the mansion and place iu' the best possible order ,^aud pay whatever rent was deemed right for the few remaining weeks that she would occupy it. Mr. Ladd expressed himself as pleased with her decision,' and promised that, he would make the very best possible1 arrangements for' her, and let , her know the result at an early date. . So Iuez Plympton went her way, with a malic ' ious gleam in her treacherous eyes, and the old mocking smile on her lips. , Mr.'1 Meredith was inclined to insist that she be ordered to «ive up Hazelwood Heights immediate ly ; , but Ruth, . always kind and considerate, pleaded that she be allowed to occupy the_place , until October, : as 'she had requested. I do hot oare ''to go there r at present,' she ? said. ' I have all that I can attend to during the next few weeks, without haying the pare aud con fusion of moving'. ' So please, Basil let everything remain as it is, and when weTeturn from our trip, we will go and look the. hbuSe over to see what changes we would like made, before taking posses sion pf it next summer.' - So Basil yielded, and it was agreed' 'fh'it Mrs.' Anthony 'Plympton should remain mistressin the ' hopie where,- for more than a : ye^r, she had: queened it right royally, until Optc(J)er._ . ? .. . ,. ?
