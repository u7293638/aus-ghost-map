Author of' The Master of tie Ceremonies, ' 'Blade Blood, or, the Loss that Loved a Soldier,' ** Hard to 'Win, tc, &c.; {ALL EIGHTS RESERVED.] As dude rose toxroas the room she caught Bight of Glyddyr looking bade at the windows on leaving the home, and heard the etndy bell ring furiously* 'Quiok, Mary!'Bbe cried, as ohe rushed through the door, being under the impression that her lather had had another seizure. The relief was so great as she entered the study and found him standing in the middle of the room, that she threw herself in his arms. ** I thought you -were taken, ni again,' she gasped, as die clung to him, trembling. He was evidently in a fury, but fau child's words were like oil upon the tempestuous waves. ' ion, yon thought that?' be said, holding her to hie breast and patting her checks tenderly. 'Yon thought that, eh? And they eay in Danroonth that everybody hates me— that there isn't a soul here who wouldn't like to dance upon my grave.' ** Papa, dear, don't talk like that.** 'Why not? the ungrateful wretches ! Fve made Danmouth a prosperous place. I Bpend thousands a year in wages, and the dogs all torn upon me and are ready to rend the hand that feeds them. If they are not satisfied with their wages they wait till I have some important contract on the way and then they strike. I haven't patience with them.' ' Father !' died Claude, firmly, ' Doctor Asher said you were not to excite yourself in any way or you. woold be 31.' 'And a good thing, too. Better be 01, and die, and get out of the way. Hated— cursed by everyliving souL' Claude clung more tightly to him, laid her head npjon his breast, and placed her hand across his lips as if to keep him from speaking. A smile came across the grim face, but there was no smile in his words as he went on fiercely, after removing the hand and seeming about to kiss it, but keeping it in his hand without. ' Everything seems to go against me,' he cried. ??Mr. Glyddyr— just going— I was seeing him to the door, when, like a black ?ghost, np starts that -woman Sarah Woodham. What does she want?' 'IH tell yon, dear, if youwiltsit down and becalm.' '* How* the devil can I be calm ?** he raved, ** when I am cegnlarly persecuted by folk like this.' Bat he let Claude press him back into an easy chair, while, feeling that she was better away, Mary Dillon crept softly out of the room. 'Well, then,' he said, as if his child's touch was talismanic, and he lay back and closed his eyes. 'HI be calm. But yon don't know Claude, you can't tell bow I'm persecuted. Fm robbed right and left.' ' Papa ! My dear father, you are as rich as ever you on be, bo what does it matter ?' ' Who eays Tra rich ? Nonsense ! Absurd ! And then look at the worries I have. All the trouble and inquest over that man's death, and through bis sheer cross obstinacy.*1 *' Why bring that up again, father dear.' ' Don't say father. Call me papa. When ever you begin fathering me, it means that you are going to preach at me and bully me, and have your way,' 'Then, papa, dear, why bring that up again?' 'I didn't. It's brought np and thrust under my very nose. Why is that woman ' Papa ? M 'Now it's of no use Claude* that man regularly committed suicide out of opposition to me He destroyed a stone worth at least a hundred pounds by using that tearing dynamite which smashes everything to pieces, and then forsooth he charges me with his dying breath with mordering him, and the wretched pack under him take up the cry and bark as he did. Could anything be more unreasonable ?' ** No, dear, of course not. Bnt the poor fellow was mad with agony and despair. It was eo horrible for him, a hale strong man, to be cot down in a moment. 'He cot himself down. It would not have happened if he had done as t ordered,*1 ' You must forgive all that uotr. He knew no better ; and as for the workmen, you tnw how easily thfy are influenced one way or the other,' 'Oh, yes, I know them; and now this woman's here begging.' ** No, papa, dear.' '* I say ehe is. I could sec it in her servile Bhivcring way, as Boon as she caught my eye ; now look here, Claude, I shan't give her a shilling.' Claude clung a. little more closely to her father, nestling as it were in his breast. ?' Well,' he said, testily, ' why den't you 'My father is the leading man in this neighbourhood,' said Claude, in a soft, dreamy tone, **and the people don't know the good ness of his heart as I do. ' ' Now, Cbvndic, I won't have it. You are beginning to preach at me, and give me a dose of morals. My heart has grown as hard as granite' ' No, it has not,' said Claude, Visaing his veined hand. * ? It is as soft and good as ever; only you try to make it hard, and you ?ay tiling* you do sot mean: ' ' Ah, now?** he shouted, 'yon are going to talk about that lisle, and I will not have his cursed name mentioned in the ? ' **I was not going to talk about Christopher Lisle,' said Claude in the same gentle, murmuring voice, whose tones eeemed to soothe ana quiet him down, *' I was going on to say that I want the people — the weak, ignorant, easily-led people — about here to love and venerate my dear father's name. :I '.And they will not, do what you wOL The more you do for them, the less selfhelp ful they are, and the more they revile and curse. Why, if I was ruined to-morrow, after they've eaten my bread for years, I believe they'd light a bem-fire and have a ** No, do, no, no,' murmured Claude. ' You have done too much good for them.*1 ' I haven't. You did it all, you hussy, and pretended it wap, I' he said grimly, as he played with her glossy hair. ** I did it with your money, dear, and I am your child. I acted as I knew you would act if you thoroughly knew the circumstances, but you had no time. What is the use of having so much money if no good is done?' ' For ungrateful people. ' ' We are taught to do good for evil, dear.' ' What ! for a race of thieves who are always cursing and reviling ni? There, I'm busy and tired, Clandie. I've listened to your moral lesson very patiently, and now I want to be at rest. But I forbid you to help that wretched woman. She and her husband always bated me. Confound 'em, they were always insulting me How dare they — actually publicly insult me — in that miserable little chapel.' ' Insulted you ? What do you mean ?' ?* Why, they prayed for me, hang 'em !' 'Oh, father dear!' ' There you go again. Papa— papa— papa. Don't forget that we do belong to the aristocracy after alL Now go and send that dreadful woman away.' ' I cannot, dear.9* 'Cannot?' ' No, papa. She has come to stay.' 'Sarah Woodham? To stay? Here?*' 'Yes, dear. Poor thing: she is left penniless almost, for Woodham did not save.' 'No, of course, not. They none of them do.' ' He Bpent all he had to spare,' continued Claude in the same gentle murmuring tone, as she pressed her father's hand to her cheek. * ? Everything he could scrape together he gave to the poorer church people.1' ' Yes, I know, in his bigoted way to teach me whit to do. And donxkeepon rubbing your cheek against my hand. Anyone who saw you would think you were a cat.' ' So, papa dear, as we want a good, trust worthy woman in the house, and Sarah was with us so long* and knew our ways so well,, I arranged for her to come back to her old post^ -Claude!' ' Yea, dear, and these years of her married Life and the sad end will be to her like a mournful dream.** »I_' Norman Gartram made an angry gesture, but Claude's arm stole round Iitb neck, her Ups pressed hia as she half lay upon his breast, and with the tears gently falling and banging like pearls in his grisly beard, she said in a low, sweet voice : — 11 And some day, father dear, at the last, as she thinks of what an asylum this has been to her, she will go down to her grave praising your name for all the good that you have done, and t*hiw will make me very happy, dear, '-'-? eo it will you.' There was a long silence in the room, and Norman Gartram's face seemed to grow less rugged, and it was as if there was something of the same look as that in his child's when, with a tender kiss upon his hand, she felt his arms and half -playfully said : — ' Am I to go and and send Sarah Woodham away?' 'No,' he said, hastily, as his old look retained. ** Yon arc as bad as you're poor, dear mother, every bit No,' he cried, with an angry flush, * I won't do that tiiongb. Not a farthing of my money shall go towards paying for that man's funeral.' ' Father dear — ' 'Papa.' 'Then, papa dear,' said Claude quietly, ' I have paid everything connected with poor \Yoodham~s funeral ?' 'You have.' *' Yes, you are very generous to me with money, and I had plenty to do that. ' ' Yes, and stinted yourself in clothes. You don't dress half well enough. Well, there, it's done now, and we can't alter it. I sup pose these people will think it was my doing/' ' Yes, dear.' ** Of course. Well as to this woman, keep her and nurse and pamper her. and pay her the largest wages you can, and mart: my words, mv pet. shell turn round and worry us for what we have done.' 'I have no fear, dear. I know Sarah Woodham too well, and I can do anything 1 like with her.' ?* Yes, as you can with me, you hussy,' he cried. 'Puke — King — why Tin like water with you, Claude, lint,' he cried shaking a finger a.t her, ' there arc things though in which I mean to have my way. ' Claude flushed up, and a Lord look came into her eyes.
