KISS-iN-THE-BING BELMION. ? Strangest of iheste≱ sects are the 'True Believena'; of Southern jKAusas. The head of the Believers is Joab3forris, a horfte trader. Oue of his sons-in- law, Bohall, is the preaoher of the east; . Another, named Darling, is the master ; bf ? an 'unknown tongue/ with, which ' he^ impresses the1 credulous* Morris and~Dariing cannot read or write; Bohall can barely read. At night ! tne meetings are held tfheh the spirit moves. The men sit at one end of the Lovel, the women at the other. The grunting of pigs and the lowing of cows oome io the ear over the low partition. - . The serinon of Joseph Bohall is ma^e up of familiar phrases caught from frontier jtteadlters. fluddeialy -among the listening^ wotshippen James Darling jucijps to his feat--* Ki yi, how pooopesi, kiyi/ he said, as taken uown by a reporter, and then be sat down trembling i& every limb, and shuffling and patting his feet, upon the ground. 1 The Holy Ghost, speaking in tie unknown tongue,' was solemnly whis pered around and the. feeliug grew intense. Ihe audience swayed their bodies into unison as Bohall resumed his talk. The spirit had entered into the faithful, and all else was forgotten in this religious ecstacy. Then Darling rose again and interpreted for ; j those not blest with the gift of the unknown | tongue. ? Be faithful uid persevering and i you will succeed/ he said was the meaning j of what be had eaid betore in the new tongue, and the interpretation was accepted with prayers, amens, and utter belief. Then oame.a sevocn of experiences, and eaoh one in turn related how, ibe spirit had worked within him and caused him {o do this or that in the furiheranoe- of the faith of Trn-- Followers. 'The .faithful then formed Jn a circle. Two basins paf water were brought out of the tense. ' was handed .io|he side of ihe.ringF formal .

Tbat penoh in turn took the towel and girding upbis or bier loins washed the feet ofthe one who eat next. This' was kept hp until the feet of all the faithful had been washed. . -Then the holy sacrament wae par taken of. Pokeberry wine. and coarse bread were used. Daring al) thie time Darling broke out occasionally with speeches in the unknown tongue, which speeches he trans lated immediately. They were mostly ex hortations to the faithful to persevere, and proraidng future happiness for so doing. 1 Towards the end . of the meeting Darling would go into fits of teemUing and feet shuffling before he gpoke. ff»'a nervous sufferings seemed real and they affected the crowd sympathetically. Teen came the' ceremony or the holy . kiss. Hie faithful stood in a oircle, men and womem alternating, . Each preaoher kissed the woman on his right hand, then the man next to the woman, and everybody there. After the first got well under way in his fringing tour the next one ! , followed, and the foene ' soon resembled ah . c4d fashioned country dance in 'the figure of ?grand diainj* or,as the callers used to an nounce, '' Rfght hand to the lady, left hahd to tbe ^geitr; aU Mnds rounfl/ By this tfms the1 Snef^dlpweEs were neai^ in a' ,0%' jwbbe4, groaji&if; fi&S; Aper .q^iflthad been restored ?wHch ^rBS.'BDt for Mferal moments, Joib Mort^'teoee fm j/fliblfl ia his baud and -begtA'^'.j^M^ % cahnA but be MM abotft anyftiiH it It, Tbr thcie who cotild rea d only knew what they read, but as Christ sppke -throngh hlm he fatew its meaning.
