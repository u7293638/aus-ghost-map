TOtitmtttba]). To-day is the Festival of Humanity. It is the birthday of a restored race. For thirty-three years had the birth-pangs of this new birth from above been lasting, even throughout the incarnate and suffering life of the Divine Word. ? By His resurrection from the dead these birth-pangs are made to cease. Now after a brief period of anxious waiting, the sorrow is remembered no more for joy that mankind has been re-born by the power of the Holy Ghost. Whitsunday is the completion of the work which we have been following throughout tne succession oi unurcn seasons smoe Aavem unnuunueu me approach of the Eedeemer. On Whitsunday the life of God is communicated to man, and the dead bones of a fallen humanity begin to stand up on their feet, an exceeding great army. What theory of the dignity of humanity has approximated to so mighty a boast as that of this day, when we claim that man has been endowed with God's own Spirit? It is of this day that our Lord speaks when He says: 'At that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you.' That day is still present, for while Whitsunday is the commemoration of the first giving of the Holy Ghost, He comes not as a transient guest, but that He may abide with us for ever. He is still resting upon the Church, still finding an entrance into our hearts, still enabling us to speak with tongues of which by nature we know nothing, even the tongues of prayer and praise, of confession and thanksgiving. â€” Bev.
