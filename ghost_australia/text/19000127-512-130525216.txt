Federal Electorates. Next to the war, the little matter of federation takes up tho interebt of the ;people, and the dear o'd Herald comes out with a leader on the advisability of dividing the colony into electorates b: cause it would be a bod thing for the pouulouB centres to dominate the tone of the entire bunch of re presentatives irom our colony, oucn a re sult would naturally follow the electing our representatives by the colony as one elec torate, and the result would bo that tbe ?country districts wculd bo unrepresented in aB much as no candidate would have a ghost of a show who dared to tell the Sydney people anything about the evils of centralisation and the injustices under which ithe country laliois at the expense of the city. All this is sound argument and it applies with equal truth to the Senatorial Elections. Can we hope to have the Herald on the side of the country, when the time comeB for Par liament to make its own electoral arrange ineDta ? Clause 7 empowers the Federal Par liament to divide the rations States up into ': districts if it is considered advisable, and the . .country districts should see that such is ~~: 'done, unless they are willing to allow the -/ Sydney and Newcastle people to -elect Sena '.;.. =tors for tbe entire colony.
