(From the M. U. Oddfello ws' Christmas Annual.) I AM aware that in disclosing what follows I may incur censure. It is one of those rare, strange, dark circum stances in a man's life which are/.I suppose, as a rule, confined to his own breast. As a mystery and a secret I have hitherto wished to carry it with me to my grave. But constant brood ing over an event at once bewildering and shocking has so pained my thought and gloomed my imagination that I am at :last, forced to seek to relieve my', mind by unburthening it. . i To those who may feel inclined to blame me for revealing what I admit' is, perhaps, not much to my credit, I, can only say that, I hope they, may never know the horror of being in/a position so appalling. ' My poor Letitia was in liei* shroud. I was about retiring to rest, "l'was nearly midnight,-but I felt that I must linger yet a little longer, and,see her once again before I slept. The other inmates of the house were fast asleep. Candle in hand and shoeless to the chamber of the stone-like sleeper I stole and entered softly. The coffin was on tressels in the middle of the room-its feet towards the window. In that receptacle-black narrow, angular and horrid-was the ?whole that earth possessed of what had been my wife. Trembling, I glanced around. The empty, neat, white bed-the toilet table with its articles sepulchrally arranged-the formal placing of the chairs-the absence of all litter-the. solemn pureness of the snowy cloths, hung evenly about upon the furniture, and the neglected clock -stopped silent in the presence of the dead -r-made my blood creep. / .1 paused a while, recovering myself: -then-went toward the coffin. >- ./ ? The cold sheet hanging 'o'er" its foot, I pushed aside, and-as it slipped off -slowly.- slowly slowly-and fell upon the floor, I almost started; ; 1 ; 'i! r-TKen;-I took off the'lid-placed"it againstthe wall--listened to my breath ing-and ? gazed . upon'.' i the H moveless' features-;till, tenderness .and madness; gave me courage-arid I,wept. i.Then, I ceased weeping and. grew, savage-sayage' with: .life/and; death',; and1 earth!,, and K'eayefai^witht^estiny, and, man-witli.mau-for, havirig spoken of'her dying. ?'!; '???;?/ !

I went back to the coffin-and could not touch it. -Another dread half-hour. Oh! she could not be dead ! I'd try-I'd know! , Feeling a clammy sweat come over me, I, yet, was resolute. I raised the stark form just an inch or two,-then -lost my power-and laid it down again I sat upon the tressel's end a long, long while, and wondered at the some thing that thus held me from my pur pose, "Jtill-starting, desperately, up, I shrieked defiance to the powers of Death, and Hell, and seized the corpse and bore it to the bed. And now all fear vanished, and I spoke to it as though it heard me, condolingly, encouragingly, soothingly. At length-" Merciful Providence !" I cried-and listened with the listen ing; which is pain in its attention's hushed intensity. Was it her voice again ? or only my sick memory of her murmurs, s.weet and low, when she'd slept,.smiling, music-dreaming, by my lide?
