. CYCLORAMA. The visitors to tbe Cyclorama cannot complain of a paucity of entertainment, for there are provided for him not only the beautiful representation of Waterloo, but tbe. clever illusion of Napoleon's Ghost and "The Fountain of Laughing Waters." .As for the main attraction, the picture is fall of dramatic intensity, and from an artistic point of view the scene as depioted . on the endless canvas cannot be surpMsed for beauty and fidelity. Tbe latest addition—the fountain—has been the subject of a great deal of admiration, and the , patrons of the Cyclorama appear to thoroughly appreciate the enterprise of the management in catering so liberally for the public.
