OSSIAN. ' ;. . The ghost of Ossian has appeared at Onefl ! But, after the manner of ghosts, it made BO . .revelation. The farmer and his 'man' who were privileged to see the ghost bad sot even the courage of Hamlet to call on the ghost to wait till they came up- to it. They fled to Orieff to tell their experiences to the. wondering, crowd. It was in the 'Sma' Glen,' a favourite drrve from Orioff for the tin tors to the hvdnopathio, that the ghost appeared. The farmer and his man with . a fiock of shdep, and when near Ossian's a rare thev mw a HnrV oot of the pound and spread itself out into a cloud of smoke. And after that another dark . shaft shot out of ? the ground 'With a hissing sound, and the brare men oould stand , no more. They fled at their best speed to Crieff. What became of the sheep we are ' not told, and it is only to be hoped that none of them were missing after ihe terrible apparition had run its course. Ordinary people, who are not gifted with the rich imagination of the Celt, might wonder whether the two had been employing the long summer evenings in reading 1 The Arabian Nights/ for the way in which the dark shaft shot ont of the ground, .and then epread out in smoke, is precisely like the way in whioh genii used to spring out the ground in ancient Persia; and in that case it is plain that the farmer and his man have missed a fortune at-, .the very least by not waiting to see the development of the cloud of smoke. Bome people have been unkind' enough ;o suggest ^hat it was^irifirkk night when the ghost of Ossian appeared, but it is well blown that the ghost 'of Oseiian has long since -ceased-to observe any distinction between a market night and any other, besides^ market nights are, now periods not. of hilarity but .of teober sadnets for the Scotch farmers.
