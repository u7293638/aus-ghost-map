POLICE v;. CAMPBELL. TO TKE EDITOR. Bir,--Tn answer to a oneffusion of legal intelligence emanating from " Aurgus " re the deoision in the cease Police v. Campbell, I beg to state for his information that there was no evidence brought forward to prove the sale or purchase of racing tickets on which the prosecution was. or should have beoon founded, as the principal witness, like the "Kiacma ghost " could not be found; thore fore the police were unable to proceed with the caseer. This, no doubt, was a cruel blow to sertain pereone, for the imaginary profits accruing from a conviction were blosted to the winds. "Argeas" states that Campbell admitted certain facts in connection with the case which should have caused a verdict to be recorded against him; but, unfortunately for "Argue," the law says that the prosecutor must prove the truthfulnese of his charge. I am, &e.;, BIDL~Y.
