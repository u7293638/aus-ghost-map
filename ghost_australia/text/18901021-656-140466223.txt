Little Gray Ghosts. A big farmhouse in New Jereey long stood tcnantlcsa, and had the reputation of being haunted. At lauta young farmer_and hia wife moved in at a merely nominal rental. An unearthly clattering on tbo stairs i frightened the couple half out of their wits I the first night, and the wife tried topersande I cor consort to get up and investigate. For an hour ha argued desperately with her on the advisability of lyirg Elill. She declared that if be wouldn't investigate she mmit dio or gat up herself. Finally they fiff-.ctcd a compromise by creeping out cf bed together. Tbey lit tho lamp and looked oautiously out of the chamber door. The firet glacco solved tho mystery. Big gra? rquirrels literally swarmed up all tbe landing?, and every one of them has a big nut of como kind between his pawj. The main supply of nuts was stored in an ur.used garret, where some tenant had placed them long ago. Tho squirrels arranged themselves in gangs on each landing, and those at the top of the house carricd the nuts one by one out of tho garret and Bent them rolling down the stairs to the next landing, where they were met by tho gang waiting for them, ond pu&hod; down another flight. In tbiBway they reaohed an :ld ocllar, whioh was evi dently the nquirrela' storeroom, for it was well stocked with nuts. They wore moving â€”from attio to basement.
