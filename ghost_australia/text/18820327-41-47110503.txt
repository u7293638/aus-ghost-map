V.A.T.C. RACES. [By Telegraph.] Melbourne. Match 2S. The Victorian Amateur Turf Club meeting 'at Caulfield to-day was very enjoyable. The weather T\as fine, but the attendance only moderate, and not at all commensurate with the elm. ,racter of the sport. The loss arising to the Club from this source, however, was compensated for to some extent by the proceeds derived from selling races. Both Harp of Erin, the winner of the Selling Bace, and byndieate, winner of the Separa tion Stakes, were entered to be sold for nil; the Club in consequence netted £275. Mr. J. 'Wilson purchased both horses, giving £130 for Harp, and £145 for Syndicate, and during the afternoon the stewards fined an Indian horse-dealer named Weeks £10 for using violent and insulting language on the lawn.
