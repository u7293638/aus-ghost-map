[?] ~. . (Bt Lancelot B.) A notable figure at the old Victoria Theatre . was., f Dick .Hunt.' He was the janitor or cerberus of the Stage door in the day time, and at night ' chucfeer out ' of gallery boys, pit habitues, or of all and sundry if they were roirdy. And he ?was well adapted for -this, for he was an ex pugilist, and though slightly lame his heavy build was a match for any two strong men. I saw him haul a big fellow from the gallery once as a terrier would shake a rat. Dick was a staunch believer in Michael Jiushs aoility to snatch the aquatic cham pionship from Trickett 'or any other man. ? frickett had just returned from his historic trip to England, and brought to Australia the title of champion oirsman of the world, wrested from the played-out Sadler. Pitt-street on the night of iris arrival was a sight to fee seen, and \--- those princely ovations to aquatic 'heroes were initiated which culminated in the receptions of Beach and Searle in after year3. I saw *' Dick ' some little time ago, old and feeble, ring ing a bell in an auction room. Bat lie looked the shadow of his former self, old and feeble. Another figure we,H known then to actors in Melbourne and Sydney was Madame Croueher, , the costumier, the oldest in Australia. She too is living, but in indifferent circumstance*. Why are these old servants neglected? In all the years I was on the stage I never had but one attack of what is called in the profession ?'stage fright.' It is a sensation difficult to describe, and the actor never forfjets it. I was Biezed by the fiend on the boards of the 'Vic.and a cold feeling comes over me even now as I recall the experience. It is —-ell known that the best and most experienced actors are subject to fits of nervousness, even at times when the parts are familiar as household words to them; bntit is generally when a long new role is undertaken, William Oreswick, that grand old stager, * told me that he occasionally suffered tortures even in parts like King Lear or Virginius which he had played scores and scores of times. 'Depend upon it,' he said, 'every actor who has any pretension to talent suffers from nervousness, just as a crave soldier may turn pale at the outset of an engagement.' Thus the great tragedian consoled me when I related to him my own experience, and I have often since then noticed in others strong confirmation of his words. We were playing 'Hamlet' (Dam pier), and the writer vas 'doubling' the Ghost and the First Actor, which latter character delivers that fine speech commencing: Anon He finds him striding too short at Greeks, His antique sword rebellious to his strm, &c.; In narenthesis let me sav that there is a tradi tion that an actor once put the cart before the horse, and rendered the first line, ' Striking at two short (3keeks.' This, however, was not my trouble. J was as familiar with the speech as with the ten commanebnente, and commenced at ! Hamlet's desiie. Judge of my terror, when, after traversing the first three lines, a movement in the stalls, or something trivial, caused an abso lute loss of memory, or destroyed my continuity of thought. Had my life depended on it I could not think of the next line. I paused; I lost my head; the crowded theatre reeled almost round me, to my imagination. An old experienced actor (Mr. J. D. Marsh) was behind me (he was playing Second Actor), and endea vored to give me the line ; but I could not take it — the mischief was done — and the gallery boys began to make remarks, when Dampisr rose from ids chair. He saw and understood my case, and placing his hand upon my shoulder, came down to the lines, ' We'll hear thee speak this speech anon.' I was grateful, but my mortification 'was intense, for there are always ill-natured people, enviously inclined, who do not fail to sneer. ? But though Dervous on the ^following sight, no such unpleasant affair occurred, and I improved my reputation by, at a 'moment's notice, adding Osric in the last act to my share in the night's work, owing to the sud den illness of the lady who was cast for the part. Since the story is against myself I may be par doned referring to the after-incident. Speaking of 7. X-. Marsh (cue of the oldest actors and prompters in Australia, and a man of vast stage experience) causes me to think of his daughter, Miss Lily Marsh, who left the stage some years ago to become the wife of a well-known Sydney manufacturer. She was pretty and petite —almost doll-like. It seemed a pity that the stage should loso her, for she displayed remark able talent ; and in such parts as ' Joe' and 'Oliver Twist' she was quite the equal, if not superior, to Miss Jennie Lee. It would be a pleasant task to tell of all the actor3 and actresses I have been associated with, but it would be almost an interminable one, so I must fain pick them out, with such matters of interest surrounding them as may seem striking and serve as an indication of their personnel. At the Tic. I met once more Miss .flora Anstead,-' after a New Zealand tour, There are, perhaps, few actresses better known . in Australia than this lady is. She was one of .? the best 'all round' actresses it has been my good fortune to know— in farce, comedy, drama, '''-» tragedy or burlesque. As Mistress Malaprop she was delightful, as Mrs. WiUoughby (' Ticket of Leave Man') she was consistently garrulous, and in every part, leading, juvenile, or what not, she left nothing to be desired. Eecently, though ~' Tejuven— ted as it were, she, with a half- sad smile, remarked to me, ' Ah,ll must give the younger ones a chance now, and so I am dropping into ?old women.' ' She was a clashing horsewoman in her younger days, and perhaps it may be news to some of her many friends to hear that on more ' than one occasion she was under Hxe in the last Maori war, riding to the front with the forces from Wangan— u This fact — for I have had the interesting story from her .own lips — gives a fair proof of her pluck, high spirits, and vitality. The old ? Vic. . has echoed and re-echoed many a time to the stentorian tones, too, of 'Charlie Burford.' Who does not know him of old? And even to this day \- .? his powers seem unflagging. His memory is un impaired, and I feel sure that there are few Shaksperian parts (in those pieces usually staged) ? that he could not undertake at an hour's notice. Xhe«ame remark would apply to all legitimate old ,. comedies. The funny stories and quaint sayings -told of and attributed to Charlie are without end. Our first meeting twenty-five years ago was in Auckland (N.Z.) just as he was landing from the steamer. It was raining very hard, and the general surroundings at the wharf were depressing. - After our introduction he ktoked gloomily around, and with a sly twinkle in the «oraer of each eye he, in a deep tragic voice, \- . asked me 'Where the gaol was ?'? That, was his % first question. Of course it was a joke, t-ut I in wardly asked myself 'What sort of a customer have we here ?' Who again does _ot remember Joe Eaynor ?— a ? _ale man yet, and surely long past the three score : - and ten. I tried to get at it one day not long ??.?'?? ? ;- ago, '..but he fenced the question by .sajing / ' '.Tut,ituti, boy. I don't want to frighten you.' ? .; ' But shortly after he incidentally remarked (it ^ .,' was in Hyde Park nere in Sydney), 'Do you ,V [ see-that, splendid avenue of trees ?' meaning the 'il ?''[.'?'. Moreton Bay figs, &c;, that form the main walk vj^r * through ^fie length of the park.

The sedate and stately Joe was '£.%?}.' forgetting ^that _e was giving data to goby. Another popular man who has made the walls of the old Vic. resound with his sonorous deep bell-like voice was Edmund Holloway, playfully known in the profession- as *' Ned.' His special forte were the sailor heroes of the nautical drama, the Williams and the Tom Bowlings, iand the old old proverbial 'salts* of the once popular pieces ^?^:' ^?M;«^u|^stic^,nlntipckB, marlin spikes, and SS ° :;?.-? ; -; ''shiver my timbers' dialogue prevailed — where fr;: ?????- gunpowder, and red ? fire,,, and cutiass fights ^v:V - ' with emugglers and pirates abounded.
