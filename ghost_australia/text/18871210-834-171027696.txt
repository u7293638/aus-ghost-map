_j8E|£eTED POETRY. Keep Out of the Past. Kbep oat of tho past ! for \U highways Are damp with inalnrinl gloom, Its gardens aro acre, and its forests aro drear, And everywhere mouldors a tomb. ' Who seeks to rognin its lost pleasures Finds only a rose turned to dust, Aud its storehouse of wonderful treasures Is coverel and coated with dust. '??'. Keep out of the pn5t! it is haunted. .! . He who .in ita avoriuo gropes Shall find there the 'ghost of a joy prized the most, ? &&? And » skeleton throne; of dead hopei. ;y.ii3£l In placo of its beautiful rivers ?fiS£ , Lio pools that are stagnant with slime; y _ ' And taos9 graves gleaming bright in tho phosphorus light Cover dreams that were slain in thoir prime. Koop out of tho past ! it is lonely ,'? / And barren and bleak to tho view.,-/ Its fires hsvo grown cold and its stories aro.qld.'' Turn, turn to the present, tho new ! To«(lay loads you up to tho hill-tops, That arc kissed by tho radiant sun ; To-day shows no tomb — all life's hopo in bloom And to.duy holds a prism tob3 won. Ella. Wiikelee Wiloox, in Chicago Times.
