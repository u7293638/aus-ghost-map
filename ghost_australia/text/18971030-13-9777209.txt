THE ABUSE OF THE SUPER- NATURAL IN FICTION. By EDMUND GOSSE. The primary object of the story-teller is to attract our attention. He sits down by the fireside and begins to recount some- thing. If it seems to be amusing or thrill- ing, we listen; if not, we go away. But nowadays there are so many tellers and so many tales that the anxiety of the novelist becomes almost painfully apparent. He is so afraid that we shall not attend to him that he uses every subterfuge to excite us at the outset. If he is a realist, he puts in the squalid details on his first page; if he is a romanticist or a satirist, he tries to do the tricks of his business the very moment that he catches our eye. And, as the ground becomes more and more crowded, and the novel situation taken from real life more and more difficult to find, the writer of fiction is tempted to return to the congenial hunting- ground of his fore- fathers, and try to interest us in what never was and never could be. Within the last two or three years we have seen a re- vival amongst us of the supernatural in fic- tion; we have had quite a crop of noticeable books the plots of which run counter to all existing experience. There is no objection to this practice in principle, but some of the novelists do not seem to perceive what the rules and limitations of it are.
