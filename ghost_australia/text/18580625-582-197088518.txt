' NIGHT IS THE TIME; Night is the timo for rest : How sweet wbon labors oloso, To gather round an aohing broast : The ourtains of repose ; ' atretotj tuo tared limbs, and lay tne bead 1 V j Uppn our delightful bod. Night is the timo for dreams ; i The gay romanoo of life : The truth that is, and truth that seem?, r , ' .Mix in fantastio strifo ; . , i :Ab, visions loss beguiling far ! Than waking dreams of daylightare. -'' | Niaht is tho time to weep ; To wet with unsoon tears Thoso graves of momory, where sleep Tfie joys of othor years; Hopes that were angels at their birth, But died when young like things of earth. Night is the timo for toil ; ' j To plough the olassio fiold, - . Intent to find tho buriad-spoil - - Its wealthy furrows yield ; ' Till all is ours that sages taught, That poets sang, and heroes wrought. Night is tho time to rvatoh O'or ocean's dark expanoe, 4 To hail tho Pleiados, or oatoh The full moan's earliest glauoe, j That bring into the home siok mind 1 AU we Have loved aud left behind' Night is the timo for oare, ...... I : : Brooding o'er hours misspent, To sea the spootro of despair J , : Oomo to our lonely tout, : Like Brutus, 'midst, his slumbering host, ' Summoned to die by Oseiar.s ghost. Night is the timo to think ; ; - - Whon from tho eye, tho soul Takes flight and on the utmost brink . - Of yonder starry pole, : Discerns beyond the ubyss of night;; . . , Trie (laqrn of unareated light. Night is the tiipe to pray ; Our Saviour oft withdrew Tp desert monntaiBS far away ; So will his followers do, â€” Steal from the throng to haunts uptrod, Aud commune their alone with God; Night is the time for death ; When all around is pouoe, 1 Calmly to yield the parting breath, Erozn sin and sufferiug oease, \- Think of Heaven's bliss, and give the sign To parting friends srioh death be mine 1 J, Montgomery.
