i BEVIEW.

But upon none of these have the authors been able to bring to bear the careful research and intelligent personal observation plainly to be seen in the work e,f Mr Curr Hie illustration of the grain of mustard seed-the emallest of all seeds grow ing and expanding into a huge tree is brought to mind by the author s remarks in the introduction to his work J went} years ago he was invited to join some gentlemen then bus) ing themselves m compiling vocabu lanes ot the victorian languages. I or several reasons he excused himself, but a trille changed his views Talking with a black fellow of the Swan hill neighbourhood he heard a word used which belonged to a tribe on the Goulburn 150 miles away- a word not used by the natives of the intervening country ' Struck by a circumstance so peculiar, he collected for his own lntormatinn as occasion oil er ed a number of short vocabulines of the languages of the tribes whose territories sur rounded those of the several Bangerang Bepts. Prom these he learnt that the latter people were encircled b) a number of tribes which spoke related languages which differed materially from theirs. Hie result of this little discovery was not only to sweep away somo loosely formed ideas about the migra tiona of our tribes but to convince the writer that something positive micjit be learnt from language in connection with the past history of the Australian race Then came curiosity lins had to be satisfied for the subject exerted a certain power of fascination over the inquirer and he placed himself in communication with the several colonial Governments the press and a number of Btocl owners und asi ed their assistance in the collection of materials for the under taking which he had begun to contera plate lins undertaking is now completed It has been done by a man who though an enthusiast, has not allowed himself to bo influenced by the sickly sentimentality so common to those who write upon the ' noble savage He gives the blacks credit for every virtue and talent they possess but he does not seek to hide their vices by throwing over them it veil of romance He presents to us the Australian as he was now is and ever will be as long as he exists upon the continent.

It is pointed out that the Australian is not nearly so black (physically) as he is supposed to be. When his skin is cleansed of grease and dirt it proves to be of dark copper colour, some individuals being darker than others as with 1 uropeans '1 his light colour is cspeci ally noticeable in newl) bom infants, but m the course of a week or so they darken con sidcrably With regard to infants, by, the way, we should have been glad if Mr Curr had made reference to a peculiarity which we have ourselves noticed That is, on the fore head of the new horn copper coloured babe a smudge is to be seen, as though made by a dirty hand , and this gradually enlarges until the whole of the skin is tinged with it. It would be interesting to know if this is com mon, or whether the few cases we have seen were exceptional 'Hie physical appearance of the race is dwelt upon, and full justice is done to the exceptional powers of hearing, smell, taste, and sight, to tho ability to endure hunger, thirst, and cold, and the quickness with which blacks recover from wounds which would have proved fatal to Europeans Mr Curr gives a proof (vol I, p 41) of how great a degree ot cold blacks can endure In athletic sports they excel, especially in the running high jump, and their talent m tho matter of riding buck jumpers is well known But apart from that, they have no "hands,' and are certain in time to spoil a horses mouth Manual labour they cannot stand, and it is worthy of note that notwithstanding the ages that must have passed since the race first landed in Australia no attempt has ever been mode by them to till the ground With regard to their mental characteristics the author is of opinion that the black in his wild state " is quicker in the action of his mind, more observant, and more self reliant than the 1 nghsh peasant but less steady, persevering and calculating nts mind, in many respects is that ot a child On the question of secular and religious educa tion it is shown that the native child masters the art of reading and writing in less time than that required by an English child He will amuse himself with stones and with scribbling but b«omi that he never pro t,resse& It is doubtful even, if when he reaches middle age, he has retained the little knowledge he acquired as a child 'Hie writer considers it clear tiiat there can be no hope ot raising the native to our level of civilisation in a single generation At the same time he considers that there are ' no grounds for supposing that he would not con tmue to advance irom generation to genera tion with continuous cultivation ' Could an educated black sell his ability to read anil write he would certainly do so Having been associated tor some )ears in the control of the aboni-iuul stations with gentlemen who had known the fathers and mothers of the children then m charge in their wild state, Mi Curr and many others were of opinion that the ' schooled generation were not m improvement As for their Christianity he remarks, it seemc 1 to begin and end with singing psalms. W ith tnese opinions we cor diall) iL-ree. 1 he untutored savage is a better man than lie of the schools 1 he latter has simply gained cert un powers which render his natural cunning anil duplicity more subtle, the light of education has not chased from his mind the dark effects of ages of hereditary taint His acquired religion is simply a cloaic which he assumes in the presence of certain people in order that he may pose ns a re claimed natue, and thereby tain praise and material rewards Socially considered, Jlr Curr Btnps the blacks of many virtues usually ascribed to them by sentimental and ignorant people, but, on the otuer hand ho ascribes to them the possession ot moral feelings-a matter concerning which other writers have made but few remarks. He is convinced that they discriminate between acts ol right and wrong, though they are unable to formulate the difference These finer feelings have become blunted by constant repression Low spirits and remorse follow upon acts such as mas sacres and child murder but the feeling is not of long duration He is very doubtful whether they have any knowledge of a God, and it is certain that nothing in the nature of worship or prayer or sacri fice has been observed amongst them yet they have hazy and rudimentary ideas that man possesses both a body and spirit, and it is owing to these that they practice the custom of tying the limbs of a corpse, in order to prevent it from coming out of the grave in the shape of a ghost Hte same fear is experienced even when the body is burned to ashes The confusion of ideas respecting spirit and body is manifested by the fact that only the ghosts of men lately dead are feared They frequently carry the bones of a friend about with them, as though (the flesh having decayed) the spirit no longer existed But those of our readers who are interested m tins subject must read Mr Currs remarks for themselves A great motor power amongst tho Aus tralians is the belief in witchcraft, and upon this the author bases some strong arguments in favour of his contention respecting the origin of tho race Of this, however, we shall subsequently speak more fullv 'Htere can be no doubt, as Mr Curr ob serves, that "it is impossible to appreciate correctly the manners and customs of our tribes until the more salient features in con nection with their ideas about sorcery have been mastered, and though he has dealt largely with this subject there isyetawide field left for the researches of others The emeral edict of the blacks is that many important things can be effected by the power of the ' black art. In dillerent tribes tlie details of the ceremonies vary, but there is suflicicnt to show that all are derived from a common stock The author treats this subject at some length and gives details that will prove of great interest to the general reader no less than to the student of ethnology A name is given to every boy when a chi'd but w ncn he attains the age at which the initiation into the rights of man hood takes place that name is cast aside, and to mai e uso of it attcrwards in speaking to the man throws lum into a state of tear and alum The reason for this is curious Ibis custom U] plies to men only, women re taming their mimes from hirth onwards 1 he account ol some c1 tuo ceremonies-such, lor instance, as that in which a lock of hair, the n mains of food or other personal belongings of au enemy are secured and arc placed before the lira to waste-bring to mind some of the tricks of sorcery practised b) 1 uro pean nations not many centuries ugo It will be remembered that in those data u waxen image was mudo of the person whose death was desired and was placed neara fire so that it would gradually milt away, and, as it did so, the living man would pino und ultimately die So with the blacks, though the form is somewhat different I The "doctor' of the tribe is the mugicmn I in chief He is supposed to be able to care all diseases by sucking the afflicted parta of the patient's body, and he pretends to produce in this manner the most extraordinary objects from the bod) pieces of wood and other things, the presence of which has caused sickness. By the use of incantations he averts the effect of charms supposed to be exerted b) n member of a neighbouring tribe against some member of his own people. But if he fans in this, and the man dies, he frequently has to undergo the "ordeal ot spears " The lot of the Australian "doctor" is not a happy one, and his white brethren have no cause to envy him A most curious thing ia, that these " doctur3 " have'imphcit faith in each other, and if one falls sick he at once sends for the nearest friendly sorcerer. The profession has its rewards however, for the members are held in high honour, and generally manage to obtain more than their fair share of wives It may be thought that this last reward is of doubtful value, but it must be horne in mind that the black 13 master in his own house, and rules his wives with a club Sorcery, Mr Curr tells us, is the great bar to social progress amongst the tribes It makes them feur and note every man not of their own tribe, mid tends to keep them in small communities lie doubts, also, whether before the advent of the whites the blacks had ever heard of a beneficent Spirit, for, like the negroes, they are satanic in their ideas. On page 51 of the first volume another fal- lacy is exposed, name!), that the w ltd man ia as free to wander where he wills as are the winds ot heaven Hie ordinary observer of aboriginal life notes that the black 13 un- trammelled b) the conventionalities of civili- sation, and supposes him, therefore, to be a free mun But Mr Curr 13 not an ordinary observer, he has looked below.thesurface, and he tells us that, on the whole the Aus- tralian savage ' is much less free in a number of important particulars than the Pnglish man or the I renchninn ' And if our readers w ill turn to the page referred to and read on they will see to vv hut unpleasant fashions and customs the black has to submit, and they will thank their stars that they were horn beneath civilised rule There ia a great deal of nonsense talked about freedom by people who imagine that it exists only 111 savage life The statement modi» by Mr R Brough Sm)th, in his work The Aborigines of Tie lona, that, before the coming of the whites, the native tribes were under the government of the old men, is refuted, and Mr Curr shows conclusively that Buch a custom has not been known to exist among the blacks It is also pointed out that the same writer has made mail) errors in his chapter on " Encampment and Daily Life " A number of errors and misstatements appearing in Mr James Dawsons work, the Austi altan Aborigines, are also referred to Ins only right that 111 the interests 01 history this should be done, and Mr. Curr has performed his duty in a way that ought not to causo those writers to leel hurt, i hey have erred in accepting too readily the statements of the natives themselves, and of taking tor gospel notes furnished them by men who were not cureful and accurate observers
