The Last Man —There is one individual that we have always felt great sympathy for, atfd that is the last "man in the procession. He dbtsn't want to be the last man, of course, but implacable fate puts him there and there lie seems to stay." There's no way of getting out of it. ; Did you ever wait long enough to see the JaSt teanin a great street parade ? Of course fth^r^ inust a last "man in a procession as JtTrftre is alieSd' tfian to tead it. He is that thiite hnfbrtunate individual who closes up ^the reanr.
