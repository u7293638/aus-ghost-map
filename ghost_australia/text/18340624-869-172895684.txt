A GBOUP. There was « very Agreeable knot of ejoial felloes at tlie Annual Wt&tniinbUtr; Purity of Election dinner the other day 2—-Cohbelt, Huot O’Connell, and Lawless. Cobbett once said that O'toonell was a hypocrite and a liar, and called him a rrptile, and said if lie were near bim lie would knock him on llie head. O'Connell said that Cobbed was a savages a beast, and a monster, whose name was a pollution to his ears, Hunt challenged O’Coohelt's honesty | and O'Connell said be ought to be struck 00 the face with one oMii* own blanking brushes* Lawless quarrelled with them all, and abased them all, and they all returned the compliment in (kind. Notwithstanding, however, these trifling disagreements, th e; met the other day at dinner, and Lawless invited Cobbett to shake hands *witfi O'Connell, and O'Comiefl forgot and forgave, and they all shook bands, sod sat down together, and sp> nt an evening of cproarious festivity ; the two I£ng1ish‘iadicals being in no respect less jovial than ibetao Irish radicals. One oannot but admire this kipd obliviousaess of disposition, which drowns in a cup of gene* rous wine ail tbe pa^t animosities of fife* That man roast Indeed be amiable, who believing another to be a liar or a savage, can nevertheless lake him to his bp&nm; upon occasions.
