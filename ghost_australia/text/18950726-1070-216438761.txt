Our poor moke fanoying that he had at last discovered what, in all proba bility;., ;he bad- never seen, since ho -came out, one of his own- species, kept up the ooncert-for a long-while at a time, and moro than once it was joined- in by another strango .birk, who 'kept sho.nting more pork" ns, dearly ftk any humaci cduld pronounce the words. On all these accounts, we did not obtain a very good night's rest, and we had to get up betimes, to accomplish as much . -of our journey . us, , possible before tho great heat of the day set in ere which time we hoped to traverse twenty miles. We actually did little moro, only passing a single human residence on tbe-way, " a wattle and dab" hut with a native yeleman, or spear, sunk deep in ,t,he, closed . dpor and two more in .the" window shuttors. After a good deal of knocking and shoaling, a pale,- scarcil-looking man shbwed, himself, who told us ho had defended bis habitation . the night before against a number of 'furious savages, but. after be had killed two or three with an old gun, they had drawn off,- vowing, however, that they would come, back. before long. \- Ho seemed to be. frightened out of his wits!. but would not, loave his little homestead for all' that, and so wo con tinued ; our journey,, after, changing some tobacco, and two bottles of beer, for a piece of bacon-'and. somo. damper .bread; for our, pro visions,. _wera begin ning to'foll, short, ap'd the information i that we shouldn't paas the next white settler'a abode until we had ' done .another, prty. miles of. our. journey mada.ns apprehensive on Hud wore. . "I wish we'd :left Eookham'ptori alone, -or ,;else- -gone, to it by. water," growled- my; partner, when we were ,on?'e jnoio', on our, way. "You can sed now how reprisals work. A white -shepherd poppers some blaokfellows with swaUshotj beoause ho thinks they- iiitend to steal his sheep, and, rank ling under, their hurts, ,thoy sfey the shepherd. In return, the police are lHn5osFTand' think that all is satisfac torily. settled - when they have killed twp blacks ,;in .return for -one white. But, very natura'ly, ,the natives, don't see it in that light. Thoir blood is up, onddittleiwonder; and now, -very likely, they want to double the score also. The poor . .fellow we've just left is a gone coon, you inay. depend on it, and he is of the same opinion, or I'm muoh mistaken ; whilst, as for our selves, I shall bo uncommon glad when I tread ..the paving-stones of a civilised street ohee more." This way of talking made mo feel far from comfortablo myself, and I no -longer envied Bobinson Crusoe his lsiana Kingdom ajcer nis discovery inns savages visited it. (To be Continued,.').
