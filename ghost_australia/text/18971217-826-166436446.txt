The Red Mass. The "Bed Mass" or Mass of the Holy Ghost celebrated according to custom at the opening of the legal year, was attended at the Church of SS. Anselm and Cecilia, Lincoln's Inn Fields, by a large number of Catholic members of the Bench and Bar. It is called the Bed Mass because the vestments worn by the celebrating priest are red, the colour appropriate to Mass of the Holy Ghost. The Sardinia Chapel, as it; is generally called because it was formerly the chapel of the Sardinian Em bassy, is one of the few Catholic edifices in London in which the rites of the Catholic Church were allowed to be celebrated during the period the penal laws were enforced against the members of the Church. Amongst those present were Mr. Justice Mathew and HiB Honour Judge Bagshawe, Q.C. The Lord Chief Justice (Lord Bussell of Killowen) was prevented from attending by the results of an acci dent to his leg, but he was represented by his sons, the Hon. A. and F. Bussell.
