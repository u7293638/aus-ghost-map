MISCELLANY, A l!u»Ii iucldent. Ihj " F. in the Sydney Jxhe.) Since that incident of the lost chil dren in the Victoria Wimruera bush was beaten out so thin as to cover the whole ' world with a veneer of Australian inter est, many greater tragedies, more thril ling events, acts of nobler lieroisoi, worthier perseverance, and far higher quality of romance have been permitted to pass unnoticed. The iast of these and greatest in its appeal to the brood human interest comes us an item of most ordinary newa from Xumut. Dropped in the daily stream which con verges from all quarters, occupying nliout tho same space, and causing, ap parently, about the same concern as a publican's race meeting, a shearers' spree, a washing up of a battorv or siaicing claim, is a story whose horror nnd significance exceed the tragedy .of tho Mignonette as much as thccinolionB of any general human group exceed those of any individual. The story was told yesterday. It is very brief, A woman is left in a hut with fire small children. Her husband is shearing at a Elation six miles away. The nearest neighbor lives four miles across the ranges. The baby becomes sick and tho mother alarmed. She roust get s doctor ; alio must reach her neighbor's, and brIc tho good man to ride into Tumut, It is nearly evening as she 6tarts, the baby wrapped in her arras, Freddy tho capable bush lad for com pany, and tho cog for protection's sake. Poor dog 1 And now it is impossible to understand what follows unless you knew a little of the ranges. What pic ture does the word bring to you ? Great ; blue mountains, cut by gigantic cbosuis, ribbed and barred with iron rock 1 Jt jis not like that. Neither is it tiicmagnificcQt I ridge, forest-swathed and snow-croirncil, which Chevalier or Buvelot has shown to yon. You may see a scrap of it in ; Johnston's picture, "Off the Track," in the National Gallery ; just a scrap of it— you must imagine all the rest. Mite after mile of the same dreary monotony, mile-long wastes of box forests, all the ground beneath strewn with dead leaves and brokcu twjgs and whitened boughs ; occasionally a granite boulder protruding, and iu tho depth of each hollow a patch of flat with long brown grass and a watorhoio, black and : fretid before tlio rain, brown and turgid after ; tracks also without end, No doubt about tlio right track through the first hour. The ironbark ridge appears as it should, and beyond it the purple : head of Kosciusko, or the darkening mass of the Jvinndra mountains. Vcs, tliey are growing dark, and the sun is setting ; but it cannot bo far to the neighbour's. Tkcro are three tracks now — one to tho old sawyers cuinp, the other to tho deserted lead. Thie must be the one ; there is a fresb horse- track on it. Hurry along ! The dog bounds barking ahead and trees a 'jmssuui, Freddy would like to climb and chop him out. No timo now. Baby whines so piteously. Husli, baby I Hurry, hurry ! All ! there goes the sun. 'J'he mother can feci something like cortuiu hopo passing out of her soul as the last yellow glare rises from the tree tops, and like an actual blessed presence steals up the liilisido and away — ah, whither ? Whither, indeed 1 Here aro more tracks, inoro and moro. Where should the mountain bo, where tho ironbark ridge? There arc clouds rising, there is no mountain to be 6cen. The day is going; the night comes — so swift, so sad, so strange. Do you know iiow it comes? I will let another speak, for I know I myself can never speak so well : — " The grotesque nnd distorted trees, huddled here and thc-rc together in the gloom like whispering conspirators ; the little open flats cu- circied by boulders which seem the forgotton altars of some uuboly worship ; . tbo white, bare, and ghastly gums gleaming momentarily amid the deeper shados of the forest ; the lonely pools begirt with shivering reeds, and nauuted by the melancholy bittern only; the rifted and draggled creek bed, which seems violently gouged out of the lacerated earth hy some savage convul sion of nature ; the silent and solitary places where a few blasted trees crowd ' together liko withered witches, who, brooding on some deed of blood, hare been suddenly stricken horror-stiff, Riding through this nightmare land scape a whirr of wings and aharshiy disturb you from time to time ; hideous and mocking laughter peals above nud shout you ; and huge gray ghosts, with, little, rod a/as, ibftf sway ivi'dl1 but ncienlese ibomite few flltuteyiiw bridle, ithc ,timtc li'titgSlMtits hw swid'o; the d oe (trunks (tup iifttft ditto SHWOiltv; tbefi .iyes itUSkft (ft.KtHltSttfl ift dtSttdi'mWIf# nurts ' ;i, (the dtftrth ltsfiis dtitt lidiwtfOi1 yaw like ,» strip dtf my dM> spim1 liy a- .fiirio" dy flying home, ttlie a\v sfeiikdit your r.rce ifliuijifli;, (the tltutili, siWityt'gwiy' and > Mess, d'iwts lidfewyaw dfltfldl'dSd' bclfli'l you iiike & feg. feu iW'y«ttw> self ;i :ithe prormtipg M!fl!tsfWdtPdff sound1 nnd color, feu hiSSOIUP dViffiik with' the v '.iie,of itiie qiigltf, iOttfl,MugrySit\r iudiviluulify, swoop dtiwifwddWiftrtyiiig: phau'ou", » » littw dtf .fllrofew/' h;i not so (to (the WW itwrnttd1.'
