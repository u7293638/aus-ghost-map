B, OASTIEAU on the Hospitals for the In- sane will be fresh in the recollection of the public. In substance tho document was a statement that the asylums are not well managed from a business stand-point. Mr. CASTIEATJ declared that he saw evidence of a lack of personal energy and business know- ledge in tha everyday life of the establishments, and he expressed these views without reserve and in a plain manner. And plain speaking ia so much of a novelty in official reports, that the document made something of a sensation, both with the public and in the official world, and the Chief Secretary at once asked Mr. PALEY for a Teply. The counter report has been recoived, and is published in our columns to-day, and will no doubt be read with interest by all who perused the ori- ginal document. Some regret must be expressed at the tone adopted by Mr PALEY towards Mr CASTIEATJ, who, whether competent or not to report, waa only discharging his duty, and obeying orders in so doing If Mr PALEY had remembered this, his concluding in vectivo would, wo think, have been omitted Moreover, objection to Mr CASTII AU comes a little late m the day, for whereas it might have been urged when the appointment was made, it has been withheld until tho report proves to DO of au adverso duiacter The foundation of the sneers is that Mr CASTILAU IS a layman, aud doubtless if he had reported on the subject of insanity, or on tho treatment of the insane, his presumption would have been rightly checked But, as we pointed out at the time, the report does not touch upon these matters The committee of tho Vic tonan branch of tho Medical Association, who visited the asylums m November last, referred to this part of the subject, and condemned the Kow Asylum root and blanch, but the medical report and Mr Craiuus havo not one point in common Ike medical com mittee dealt with the tieatment of lunacy, and the layman confined his attention to tho management of the esta bhshments in which lunacy LS treated The distinction is clear About the matters of buying and selling, of chock mg waste, of improving grounds, and of maintaining discipluio among ser vants, most men can form an opinion And when diverse conclusions are arrived at by two ofiiciate on these points, the question ia not which is the most skilled in tho treatmont of insanity, but which has the better head for busi ness on his shoulders Tor the most part-and it is inevi table that it should bo so-Mr P \XEY meets Mr C\ si II VU S assertion of bad management with a counter declaration that the arrangements aio excellent Mr RAMSAY will havo to make other inquiries, and draw his own conclusions The specific points, how evei, which Mr CASTILAU touched upon may be noticed heie Mr CASTILAU says that tho cricket grounds, bowling alleys, billiard rooms, libraries, newspapers, cards, iLc , liberally provided by the Government, aro monopolised by the attendants, who make no efforts to induce the patients to avail thomselves of these advantages Hie reply is a bald statement that cricket is necessarily confined to tho at tendants, the patients playing the part of spectators, a necessity which is not apparent, and which, at any rate, does not apply to the other amusements specified In conncuon with the alleged wasto of goods, Mr CvsriEvu lemarl ed that some of the asylums used 501b of soap per head pei annum, and the Beechworth Asj lum used 251b The reply is that the largo e\pendi turo takes place in the asylums where dirty patients are confined, and the bedding and clothing has to be more frequently washed This would be a complete answer, but Mr P\XLY goes on to say that ho has directed that the Beechworth practice of storing and drjing the soap shall bo observed in future at all asylums Soap which has boen dried is found to go further than soap which is fiesh and moist, so that m point of fact there was, as Mr CVSTILUT SUS pected, an economical reason for the discrepancy Then, as to beer, Mr CASTII AU showed a loss on the Yarra Bend biewory, and Mr PVILY brings out a profit But the medical supenn tendent has to assume that he could not purchase colonial beer, wholesale-3,000 dozen at a time-at less than Gi 3d per do7en, and householders will be apt to arrive at the conclusion that this price is 50 per cent too much They will be fairly astonished by the as sumption, and will hope that all Mr PAU Y s quotations are not of a similar character Mr C LSTIEAU wrote I would Strongly recommend that the brewery bo either enlarged so as to ho made competent to supply the ivholo of the depart ment with malt liquor or that it be done away with altogether The brewers who are now employed could i£ they had but room enough make all the beer that ia required and so givovaluo for their salaries and allow oncea At present it would be far cheaper to purchase what ia neceasary at contract prices This recommendation, wo should ima gine, will be acted upon Mr CAS TIE AU deploied the want of management and skill shown in the condition of the farm lands Mr PALEY says ho is not a practical man, but he has done his best, but tho regret is that practical talent was not secured As to the alleged waste in food, Mr PALEY enters into a calculation to show that if salants are deducted, lunatics here cost a little less per head for keep than thoy do m Great Britain The question at once ames, is mero living, apart from salaries, more expen sive here than m Great Britain, where, moreover, the asylums have not tho advantages m the shape of largo ad jacent farm lands possessed by the institutions here 1 The comparison leaves the issue of whether there is or is not undue waste in our asylums un touched, and is therefore of little value, but, m passing, we may point out that Mr PALEY should not deduct from the local cost the contributions mado by the friends and relatives of the pationts, when ho makes no such deduction in the British accounts Calculations are rendered worthless by such errors The grand issue between Mr PALEY and Mr CASTIEATJ IS as to whether or not a lay director should be appointed, with a view to moro complete super vision and the better practice of economy Mr PALEY says that there is no in stance in the world of asylums being managed by laymen, and this is a strong point m his favour On the other hand, our circumstances are somewhat ex ceptional In England as a rule each institution is self contained, and is under the supervision of a board of guardians Here we bnvo n number of mstitutiona which form a department under the loose manage- ment of a political head If the pro pnety of placing each asylum under the charge of its medical officer is ad mitted, Mr CASTIEAU may still be right in saying that the exponditurp of the whole department, amounting to £100,000 per annum, should be under the supervision of a man of business, who should know the value of material, should be able to keep an eye to re- pairs, and to turn the farm lands to profitable account If the vast expendí ture and the vast property of the state are efficiently supervised, the time of the superintendent must bo entirely occupied, and his qualifications as an expert ni lunacy must necessarily remain m aboy ance On the other hand,., tho timo oí tho superintendent is engaged in work aa an expert in lunacy, there is tho ovi dent danger of business and of economy being neglected Successive Ministers Lavo promised to conaidei and to deal with the important question thus raised, and we certainly hope that Mr RAMSAY will mike a full investigation, and will arrive at a settlement m the light of I now ledge No colonial statesman had firmei faith m tho future of theso colonies than Sir JULIUS VOGLL, and ono of his chief aspirations during tho long period for which ho directed the destinies of Now Zealand was to bo allowed an opportunity of assisting Great Britain in the great national work of extending the British dominion throughout the unippro pnated islands of the South Pacific Ho Lad implicit confidence in the enterprise of the colonists, and constantly con tended that tho commerce of the Pacific was their inheritance, if only the mother couutrj, with their assistance, would undeitako the vvoik of reducing to civilisation tho fertile islands of the Oceanic Archipelago Ile even boldly asserted that rathei than see Polynesia abandoned to foreign nations, it would be better for Great Britain to entrust New Zealand, which possessed much experience in dealing with mixed races, with the task of extending the British sway in these remote regions This, however, was a durna tcssoit, for the pioject ho favoured most was one for the establishment of a trading company which ho hoped might secure a great part of the commerce of tho South Pacific, and m time lead to the erection of a Polynesian Dominion as ono of the British dependencies, but with New Zealand as the centre of government Iho idea was suggested to him by Mr COLEM \\.N PHILLII S, who considered that an organisation rosem Ming the East India Company might sue ceed in gaining a political and commercial ascendancy m the Pacific Islands, but Sir JULIUS VOGLL amplified the suggestion, which evoked much popular interest at the time, although nothing was done tow ards giv mg effect to it, owing to the discouraging attitude of the Home Government, and more particularly to the fact that New Zealand had just then embaiked on the prosecution of the policy of extensive public works which has dono so much to develope her im mense natural resources Tho announce ment recently made that a great national enterprise has been successfully started in Germany on a vory similar basis to that proposed by the New Zealand states man, and that its field of operations is the South Sea Islands, naturally arouses attention in these colonios, whose political and commercial interests must always be closely identified with the fortunes of tho great archipelago which so closely adjoins the British possessions m these waters We learn, then, that the objects of the Geiman Maritime Trading Company, which under Prince BISM UICK'S auspices has been recently successfully floated, are to obtain possession of " transatlantic " trade, for the purpose of the working " of factories, mills, and plantations, " particularly in the South Sea Islands " Although nominally intended to take over the assets of the Messrs GODE moy, who for many years have to a gi eat extent monopolised the trade of the Navigators' Group, yet as the capital subscnbed so far is m excess of what would bo required for such a pur pose, w o are justified in assuming that the company contemplate a more am bitious future The hints which havo been dropped respecting the colonising intentions of tho German empire also support this view Should this surmise be justified, and an extension ol Gorman influence in tho South Pacific be tho real aim of the company, it is easy to see how v.ry materially British interests may be aflected by the accomplishment of a design which admits a third power ful European competitor into the race for supremacy m Oceánica In a de spatch which Sir JULIUS VOGEL has ad dressed to the New Zealand Government on the subject of the German scheme, he recalls the efforts ho made in a similar direction some six years ago, and reiterates his opinion that he LS now more than ever convmced as to the soundness of his proposal It may be piofitable, therefore, to briefly describo the nature and aim of the company to which he alluded His idea, then, was to encourage the establishment of a powerful jomt-stock company, with a capital of £1,000,000, divided into 100,000 shares of £10 each, the Government of New Zealand consenting to guarantee 5 per cent interest on the share capital for a period of 50 years The object of the company would be to civilise and settle the South Sea Islands by opening up profitable production and trade in connexion with them, by establishing factories and plantations throughout the groups, and by the pur chase of any which had boen already established In return for the responsi bihty in the shape of the guarantee tho Government would stipulate that Now Zealand should enjoy any contingent advantages which might arise from its being made tho depot for the island trado, and by also insisting on the right to a controlling authority ove' what might be termed the rJl} i leal actions of the associa1^11 s quite true that sumo oooptical oppo nents of the Minister denounced this proposal as visionary, and as savouring too much of a South Sea Bubb'") mz when some years later we fiV«1 emP7 whose commercial ínteres" are remotely identified with the t~f °f the °TZ Seas as compare with those of Now Zealand stre^^y supporting a sum lar pro,-et, which must sooner or later end in the virtual, if not aotual, annexation of an undefined area of the Pacific, we cannot but admit that there may after all bo moio force in the theory of the far seeing statesman alluded to thau may at first sight have been thought Her geographical position seems naturally to suggest New Zealand as a chief centre of the Polynesian trade, for the pre vaihng winds are such as to render tue two places easy of access For this and other reasons the ex Premier, who bas given such a powerful impetus to tuo progress of the colony, contends that « New Zealand cannot afford to con "tmue indifferent to the destiny ot " Polynesia, and the longer she remains *( so the more onerous will bo the task " when sho awakens to the consciousness " that nations, and dependencies of " nations, cannot escape rospoiisibdities " entailed upon thom by geographical " and natural laws " It has been too much the practice of British dependencies m tina quarter of tho globe, whenever they consider it essential that some outlying territory should be annexed for their advantage, to petition tho Homo Govornmont to assume the responsibility, on the groand that Imperial interests aro involved The natural result is that they are pointedly told that it is quito impossible to convince the British taxpayer thatlio is equitably called upon to pay the cost of an undertaking of which all the directadvan tages would be enjoyed by tho colonies Sir JULIUS VOGLL'S proposal was of a more practical kind He boheves that an immense and lucrative trade with tho feitilc islands of tho Pacific can bo rapidly developed, and that the rela tions between them and the British possessions in Australasia will beoomo so mtiinato that a policy of annexation would ultimately bo rocognised as essential It is e\ ldent that the German empire LS proceeding on a similar assumption If Prince BISMARCK were to piopose that the empiro should sud denly assume a mighty and indefinite responsibility m connexion with tho unappropriated territory in tho Pacific, ho would probably meet with but little popular support, but tho stops he pro poses to take may nevertheless result ni the acquisition by Germany of many choice islands, which, if a broader and moro national policy influenced these colonies, would naturally have fallen to the lot of Great Brit un.
