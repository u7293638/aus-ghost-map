Icebergs. I The most formidable thing the ocean pilots liave to deal with in April and May are the icebergs coming down from Greenland and the polar regions. The approach of iv sailing vessel is' heralded by tho tooting of-' the; fog-horns, the steamer by the blowing of her whistles: Jlut tho iceberg comes without foghorn or whistle.; :-It' is silent as death; und' M colourless as the atmosphere. And these clear, colourless, silent bergs are the terror of sailors and the nightmare of the captain of the. vessel. To guard against them all ocean steamships' now go with a searchlight in their bows. This, light is an electric one and is kept di rected ahead for almost- every hour of the voyage. At night it is shining brilliantly and is manned by tlie sharp est lookout of .the crew ; and in foggy days it is just as carefully attended. It is only in the very clearest hour at noon day, when tho day is warmest, that the searchlight is' put out for a few hours. The approach of a berg is said to be un heralded. But to those who know, the ocean there is a premonition ? of it — the iceberg casts its chill before. If the air becomes nipping, and the thermometer falls phenomenally low, then all kiiow it is very close and watch for it-. The searchlight gets in its , fine, work now. With nuin carefully searching its rays it illumines tho ocean sometimes for miles ahead, and. always far enough , in the \- distance to permit the ship to turn and avoid a coining, berg. ; There is' not one passenger ' iii' ti thousand crossing 'the ocean who kiio»s there is a searchlight iu the how ahvnys alert for tho moving ghosts. The gleam is for ships, they think, but it is for the fatal berg, nor can they imagine how glad the ocean crew was when the first searchlight was put in a ship and found to be worthy of the sea's use. . These dreaded ocean ghosts are now being caught by a detec tive whose watch- for them 'is as sleep less as tho sky above. '
