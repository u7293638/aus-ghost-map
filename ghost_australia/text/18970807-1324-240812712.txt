She stopped short—still laughing; blashiag. and -nghasŁ "Łady CetSl Clire, I believe?" He took off his hat, ana stood bareheaded before her-tall, sohle, giaveiy smiling:, as Lady Cecil gave * him her hand. "Sir Arthur Tregenpa, I am sure. Did you not meet—Pansy, be quiet—"yon not meet papa? He left Sere to go to the station." "I did not meet him. Probably I passed him, for I left the station immediately." "Then permit me to welcome you in his stead. Ah, here is papa now and Major Frankland.'* "My dear boy—my dear Arthur!" The earl sprang out or the carriage, aad shook the young baronet's hand with effusion. "Such a contretemps—just a moment too iate. I saw yon drive off. and I returned with Prankland. Major rnudtland.of the —th Lancers—Sir Arthur Tregenna!" "Aw, my dear Lady Cecil, charmed to see you again, and looking so wtiL" said the major; "but then we all kn<nr to our cost, La Reine Blanche invariably looks her best on every occasion. ' And here comes our charming hostess. Aw, Lady Dangerfield. eo happy to meet yon once more.

"The sultan has come, and., his slave must wait «ntil ft pleases Łim to throw the handkerchief," Ehe murmured, bitterly. "He comes here to inspect me as he might a horse or a house he wanted to buy; and if I suit him I am to be .bought K I do not Oh, papal papa! howcould yon subject me to so shameful an ordeal?" A short while after this, there was a knock at Lady Cecil's door, and Lady Dangerfield appeared. My Jady was all summery muslin. Valenciennes lace, and yellow roses, her black eyes alight, her'-, cheeks glowing with pleasure and liquid 1 rouRe. "Come, Queenie, you ane to be on the opposite side; first <ied, and all that. Every, one has come, and Sir Arthur and the major are on the croquet ground. ReaUj-, Cecil, Sir Arthur isn't bad- looking —that is to say, if he were not beside Major Frankland- Comparisons are odious, and beside him " "Or course, beside him, the Angel Gabriel, if he- were to descend, would appear to disadvantage. Ginerra, Sir Arthur looks as if he had common-sense, at least—more than i can say for your pet military poodle. Poor little Bijou: If he only knew what a dangerous rival has come to oust him!" [ The two ladies descended together to the croquet ground—an admirable foil— blonde and brunette . The major and Lady Dangerseid played a vigorous game, sending their adversaries' balls to the farthest limits of space, and never missing a hoop. Lady Cecil Clive played abominably; her side was beaten ingloriously in every game. All the time Sir Arthur's eyes were upon the fair Cecil, and Sir Arthur was speculating as to whether or 110 she was fitted to be his wife. What a fair, eweet, prpud face it ivas, how much soul in the softly lustrous eyes, how much gentleness, goodness, about the perfect lips. Could any one who looked like that—who loved little children and played with them, a very child herself, be the coldblooded coqueU:e,ttie vain flirt włio trampled on hearts wholesale, for her selfish gratification? Ko, no, a hundred times so! Such a face must mirror a pure and spotless soul, eyes like these took their and their sweetness from a gentle and womanly heart. "Hk,r loveliness makes men her captives. How can she be blamed for that?" he thought. Sir Arthur was predisposed to be pleased. He wanted lo fuJSl a father's dying Irish and marry his old friend's daughter. The days went rapidly by. at Scarswood, and a week had passed since the afternoon of Sir Arthur Tregenna's and Major Frankland's arrival, and a very animated week it had been. Lady Itangerfield never grew weary in well-doing; ha- fertile brain originated pleasure party after pleasure party with an assiduity worthy a better cause. There had been boating parties, croquet, and drives and gallops to every Interesting spot for miles around. There had been Fortnum and Mason's hampers, ^łiifto^is and champagne, pates de foie gras, and claret cup; on land and sea. And now a genuine old fashioned pic-nic to the seashore was under way. ** A week had passed since Sir Arthur's arrival—seven long summer days and nights under the same roof with Lady Cecil, the greatest flirt of the season. What did he think of ber by this time? No one could have told, pot the young lady, certainly, to whom his manner was calm, friendly, and genial, but as Car removed from her experience of lovemaking as it was possible to fmaglnp. So far as Lady Cecii could see. all her beauty, and brightness, and fascinations were so many arrows that glanced oft his polished nbeln-majl armor. She was singularly free from vanity; in a calm way ehe «was conscious o[ her own great beauty, as she was of her proud old name, but tile smailness of personal -conceit she Had never fett. Sir Arthur could tell ber oE Australia, and its mmderftfi hidden wealth. _ of bright, bUEF, transatlantic cities—of Calitamia., where he had lived for monlhs among camps and mines and the recŁless men, tbe sweepings of the worid, who fly, them for Safety, or for gold. fie toM her of Algiers, where tie bad wintered last year, and of how narrowly bis lire bad been «aved.

Then, faint -and sick from loss of blood, he reeled from thesaddŁa, and opened his-eyes ln liiE Own quarters in Algiers. - ""And the gaHant EngiŁEiiman who sived j-ou"^* Lady Cecil breathlessly asked. "He was a capbain of Oiasseurs—Jus name, O'DonneB." Oddly enough lit his qnutos one day ttue across a book, a very handsome copy W ItttniH,' with your name on the By-leat Tonlud tent, ft io Mm, It appeared, and It had never] been returned."

They were not in ame. however, to escape tbe rain, and both got wet. , "I hope Ginevra ajid her party -were not out in that fairy bark of theirs when the squall arose." remarked Lady Ceca to the baronet as they n eared the beach. Thee presently site added: "Sir Arthur, look there! The boat has upset!" The boat had. Lady Dangerfield. excitedly aild eloquently, poured out the tale of their hairbreadth escape as thev approached. They were a mile and a half, of thereabouts, from the shore when the thunderstorm had so swiftly arisen, and they had turned and put back at once; łmt before they could almost realise the danger, the boat upset. - The MajcS- could swim-so could lHss EaUaff. -the Tector's daugiiter, who was ^tith them. Flinging one aim about Łady Bangerfield, the major struck out for -the shore, but an "awful panic had seized the baronet's wife; sudden death stared her in the face, and all presence of mind deserted her, She_śtruggłed ia the Major's clasp, dinging to Mm the while, and shrieking frantically.' In "v-ainj Lady Dangeifield screamed and struggled, and the picnic party was in a fair way of winding up with a tragedy, when a boat, skimming lifce a bird over the dancing waters, and skil- I fully bandied by one man, shot towards them, swift and straight as an arrow, "Bather a close finish," their deliverer laQ, said, coolly, after he had rescued her ladyship imr and the major. "Tou were doyour best to make for the bottom. Are you all right there, sir? Look after the lady, will you? I think she is going to faint" But Lady Dangerfield did not fainttoo much cold water, perhaps. She glanced at her preserver, and noticed, even in that moment, that he was one of the very handsomest men it had ever been her good fortune to heboid. But Lady Dangerfieid had not spoken One tvord; tears of shame and mortification were standing in her -eyes. "What a fright she inust look—hatiwx, comparatively complexionless. and her bright, gossamer summer skirts clinging about her like wet leeches? What must this remarkably good looking and self-possessed gentleman think of her? He was not thinking of her at all; he was watching, with an amused face, Miss Hallan calmly and deliberately swimming ashore, and all the other people standing like martyrs in the rain. Lady Cecil's dark eyes, full of suppressed fun, were lifted to the baronet's; there was a. grave smile even a* the corners of his sedate mouth. It was wonderful how they understood each other, and how much nearer they were then than they had been that morning. Of course the picnic broke up in most "admired disorder," and at once. The wet mermaids were packed, damp and dripping, into the carriages, and whirled away to Scars wood as fast as the horses could trot the distance. Lady Dangerfieid, bewailing her fate the while. "He had the air of a. military man," she said. "There was no mistaking it. And he was bronzed and bearded, and somewhat foreign looking. A gentleman beyond a shadow of a doubt, with the bow of a Lord Chesterfield or a court chamberlain, and . the whitest teeth I ever saw." It 'was evident Major Frankland had a rival. "1 wish I had asked his name and invited him to call." her ladyship went "I thought we had had all the officers from Castleford barracks, and if any of them are eminently distinguished looking I have hitherto failed to perceive it," remarked Lady Cecil. "We might have had him over for our theatricals to-morrow night, if X bad only had presence of mind enough to ask his name," said Lady Dangerfieid. "But bow can. one have presence of mind when one's drowning?" *T wish I had thought of asking him bis name," her ladyship remarked, over and over again, later on returning to the Unknown. "A gentleman, I am positive—there is no mistaking the air of society—and an officer; I should know a ' trooper in the pulpit or in his coffin, there is no mistaking their swing. And he had the most expressive eyes I think I ever saw " "Tour close observation does him much honor," said Major Frankland, with suppressed jealousy. "He is. in all probability, some wandering tourist or artist unknown -to tame and Trafalgar Square. It would be erueŁ I suppose, to hint at his bang a commercial traveller, down from the metropolis with his samples." "Gad! he looked like Eomeone I've met before," muttered the eari, glancing uneasily at bis daughter. "He was in London the night of the opera, and it is just possible he may have followed us down bene. Only that It would not be like him—proud as Lucifer he .used to be; ańd then I should think, too, be bad got ova- the old madness.
