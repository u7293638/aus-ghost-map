The EIGHT-HOUR DAY. ? 'What tliink ye, Tam, gin you and I ? : To solve the Labour question try ; Oor wit and widsdom baitb apply, And put oor heads thegither, man 1 Wi'h common senso ye aye agree, , Sae kindly cock yer lug a wee, ' Nor deem a rustic bard like me A Socialistic blether, man. I may be_ dubbed a pessimist, A stumping Rad, an' a* the rest ; ? But I've a stammock can digest Sio compliments wi' on'y man, S . ' I'm like the cynic wi' his lamp, When through the market place I tramp— I aye detest a polished scamp, And prize an honest cronie, man. It grieves me whiles to hear folk say, 'We can't afford an eight-how day ; They rant an' rave— faith ! weel they may, For changes queer are comin', man. The crafty rogues may slyly, wink, But, Tam, we'resmairter than they think ; Their quackery in oor noses stink, We canna thole their bummin', man. 'Twad nearly gar a body bock, To hear prophetic puddocks croak— ' We maun compete wi' ither folk,' The noodles aye keep ravin', man. 'Tis theirs to guard the nation's weal— Expose oor sins, their aim conceal, Bribe orators to soap us weel, While landlords dae the shavin', man. Economy's the latest shift, ' Ne'er dreaming that we see their drift, ' . The poor are tell't to practice thrift, # By legislatin' donkeys, man. Gi'e ilka prood presumptuous brat ; His wine, his sport, his baccarat, '? Oor bairns may starve, but what o' that ! We mannna starve oor monkeys, man. We're daily drubbed by tyrants base, Wha hound the poor frae place to place, Yet front the warl' wi' brazen face, An' justice still deny us, man. 'Tis they wha fill the sweatin' dens, Lea' destitute oor rural glens, They count their thousand's by the tens, An' pose aB saints fu' pious, man. This foreign competition cry May suit the drone, but we reply— Why sirculate the cunnin' lie, ? An' rob your luckless neighbour, man ! Why tax the nation to excess ! Why check and mar her guid progress ! Breed sin, corruption, an' distress, An' clog the wheels o' labour, man. 'Tis sad in an enlightered age Tae see oppression a' the rage — Poor lassies for a triflin' wage iiT *n an^ factory workin', man. We even see oor bits o' weens Compelled to rack their tender banes, An through oor alleys, streets, an' lanes - | iThe ghost o' Famine lurkin', man. Era men o' competition rave Let them release the; British slave Of mmin' royalties, and save _ 1 The nation frae sic plunder, man. The working class, why overtax — Why heap sic Burdens on their backs ! Though lawyers, lazy drones, an' quacks May blubber till they're bleerie, man. We sing, ' Britannia Rules the Waves 1 ' We re freemen — lod, we'll ne'er be slaves— Oor stirrin', patriotic staves We lit wi' tuneful measure, man. An yet when I reflect a while, There's no' a single foot o' soil Whereon a freeman's free to toil, ^ Save at the landlord's pleasure, man ! ' .We can't afford an eight hour day,' 'Tis crafty rogues who tell us sae ; They grind the poor relentlessly, : Spread misery an' starvation, man. ? They fain would gull the working class, The life and soul oot folk harass, ' When useful measures they could pass To benefit the nation, man. Wandering Willie. Glasgow Herald , Decembember 19, 1891.
