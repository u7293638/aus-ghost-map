"JRICHES TAKiE WINGS." (From the Boston Times.) It is not only individuals who have suddenly increased in prosperity, and as suddenly gone down into nothingness; there are cities of which the same can be said. Such a one is Pithole City, Pd."; W thin one month of the comple tion of e first house, this city had a telegrapl office, and a hotel costing the o?anei? 8p,000 dollars. In, one month there waa daily paper established, and in the ne a theatre ; in another month another eatre, and then an academy of music;: In six months there were seventy-fqur hotels and boarding-houses; in the seventh month the city had reached itt highest prosperity. It then had about 15,000 inhabitants, elaborate waterworks, a city hall, and an exten sive city government. Then odcurred the completion of a labour-saving enter prise-the so-called Miller Farm Pipe Line-by which the petroleum was sent off independent of the labouring popu lation. At once 4000 persons were thrown out of employment, while 2000 horses became useless; this was the death-blow to Pithole City. At once the hotels, theatres, and the telegraph office were closed, and the daily paper gave -up its'ghost, while,' almost' every ohe packed up his trunk and moved out. Only nine families remained out of a population. of 15,000 souls, while the railroad from Pithole and Oleopolis runs only one train a day, cohsisting of a locomotive 'and a single car, which is usually empty'; but the company is ob liged to keep, running, otherwise the charter for the road would be lost. They still hope against hope for that unfortunate city, which, in only seven: months, was borth, full grown, got sick, and died. Undoubtedly this is a case unparalleled in history, modern or ancient; neither Egypt nor Greece can give examples of such rapid changes.
