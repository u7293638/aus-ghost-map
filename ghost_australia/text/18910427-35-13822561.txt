AMUsEMENTS. Â» " THE CORSICAN BROTHERS" AT HER \- MAJESTY'S THEATRE. ivonciuaive evidence of the increasing popularity of Her Majesty's Theatre was once more given on Saturday evening The large and handsome pla) h use was filled in all parte, the stalls, family circle, and gallery being crowded almost to excess, while the attendance in the dress circle was unusually good This result was, doubtless, very greatly helped by the fact that a piece which has delighted thousands of play- goer', times out of number, from the year ISoU, was about to be presented Mr George Rignold's pro- ductions are always interesting and frequently admir- able " The Corsican Brothers," with its memories of 1 Rechter, kean, Brooke, and Irving, with a weird, fascinating theme its opportunities for acting and scenery), has always been a favourite subject with the managers who devote themselves to the serious drama. It is fit that such a play should be included in the repertory of this theatre " And, when the performance has gained more clearness and certainty) than is possible on a first night, Mr Rignold's production of " The Corsican Brothers " will be entitled to praise Mr Rignold is nothing if not ambitious He is ever striving to outstrip its predecessors Whether he RtatfCB Shak peace or B lucieault, tragedy or panto mime, he is constantly on the watch for lninrovetuont It may, however be questioned whether or no his laudable ambition has not led ht n astray on the present occasion It is difficult, of course, to play a sensational drama like " Al j Jack," with its attendant heavy scenery on one night, and then to produce, a few hours later, a romantic drama like .' The Corsican Brothers," which require a not only good acting, but absolute perfection in the management of scenes). Under such conditions it is not very surprising to find the thread of the story becoming lost Traps will not open at the proper time, lights become unmanageable, and, in consequence, visionary rendered worse than uhoIom. They confuse, whereas they should enlighten the mind of the spectator, it is hardly fair, perhaps, to judge an elaborate production here by a first performance which is in fact, little better than a dress rehearsal. In this respect the Parisian manager, with his "repctitiun-gcncralo," has the advantage over his English brother in art Defects then uctic d may be recital d, and errors of judgment satisfactorily adjusted So that a more accurate estimate of the first public performance of a new production may be formed than is possible with us there is no telling what a second performance of " The CorsicanBrothora" will show It remains to be seen sh them this revival of Dumas' romantic story can be added to the long list of Mr Rignold's previous and well-earned successes. There was much that was good in Saturday 's represent station, as it stood, but we fancy that the act manager's desire to give his patrons something new has led him into an error on this occasion. Unless we are mistaken, Mr Rignold will be wise in abolishing the collective glass and the modern treatment of the visions, and in restoring the accepted made of presenting them He must give us less of Professor Pepper and more of the approved ghost of yore The " creepy " music, known as the " Ghost Melody," and composed by M 'S arnev for the original production in Paris, must be more in evidence. there should be more decision, more distinctness, about the representation The changes of scene should be effected more rapidly, and the stage carpenters should do their work without so much noise Above all. the story should be told It must not be taken for granted that everyone is familiar with the drama in a play like this the spectators must be thoroughly informed of the plot, or the ghost and the visions go for nothing. conclusive proof of this was given on Saturday by the different reception of the first and second time the story of the deep, water lous sympathy existing between the twin brothers, Louis and 1 abler, dead ranchi, and ref used by the latter in his Corsican home to the French traveller, M Alfred Mcy nard, was listened to with profound attention The comic business of the reconciliation of the Colonna and the Orlando, with the pretty, introduced dance, pleased the spectators then came the ghost, the old- fashioned ghost of the Theatre Historique of Charles Kean and Henry Irving, which rises slowly and glides as it rises, inch by inch, until it has crossed theatre stage Old fashioned as it is, this ghost certain]) awed Saturday's audience, the vision of the duel which followed helped the situation, and the curtain fell on the first act of what looked like a pronounced success With the second act, however, came blunders in connection with the coming and of the now affects, the music the noise of the biddon dancers, and the working of the sago hands had already helped to render The alor) unintelligible how people understood what Cb iteHU Benaud or Madame de Lesparro had to do with the plot until towards the close of the act Then came the vision, which should have been clearness itself. On the contrary, it was so con- tended that no one unacquainted with the piece could tell what it mount, and the curtain fell in comparative silence borne amends were made for this want of understanding by the acting of Mr. Rignold and Mr li R Jowett in the rest of 1 obtainable , but here again that unfortunate sheet of glass spoiled the picturesqueness of the scene, and militated against the ultimate success of the production If Mr Rignold will give us the old illusions the revival of this interesting play will gain in morning The reflective glass is too small for a piece of this kind, its effects are extremely uncertain, and, moreover, it completely drown the voices of those performers who are compelled to speak behind it Mr Irving was condemned for producing the ghost of stage tradition It has been proved that the later way of dealing with the sp ctral illusion is now happy However, Mr Rignold has d in his best He has sufficient energy and strength of nun of a to let give intelligence to " The Corsican Brothers " It would be manifestly unfair to pronounce a hasty decision on a reduction which, with all its faults, has evidently occupied much time and care Mr Rignold is to be commended for the introduction of the peasants' dance in the first act It lightens the play and does not detract from the story Illa treatment of the masked ball in Paris is decidedly ingenious By the aid of handsome tableau curtains, he divides the stage and allows only a portion of the interior of the Opera House and its motley crowd of dancers there is plenty of colour in this animated scene But great care should be taken that it does not interfere with the actors the moment that the curtains are lowered the noise of the merry dancers should cease, and the music should be greatly, if not entirely, subdued Otherwise, the particulars of the wager made by M de Chateau Benaud-that he will bring Madame de Lesparro to supper at the house of a fast companion-are lost, and the relation of these characters to the play are not understood. Of Vic Rignold's importation of Louis and Fabien del Franchi, it is as yet too early to speak. decisively The efforts of the actor were apparently marred on Saturday by the anxiety of the manager Mr. Rignold's earlier scenes, in consequence, picked gaiety and spontaneity. He was too evident) concerned with the cares of the production to do himself justice His intention was good but the execution was faulty It was not until Mr Rignold reached the quiet of the last act that he impressed the audience there, however the actor rose to the occasion. He admirably conveyed the idea of the deadly calm and the belief in himself with which rabies is filled when he confronts his brother's murderer. Ino earnestness which is characteristic of Mr. Rignold's style has never Blood him in better stead than on this occasion He brings out very clearly the fatal, implacable feeling with which I abhor del Franchi la impregnated at this point I alien, in the rest of 1 obtainable, has not been better represented than by Mr Rignold When the works of a first night are over, when the actor manager is at case, Mr Rignold's por formulae, as a whole, will bear discussion The Corsican Brothers is essentially a man's play There is next to no female interest in it It is indeed, too often more by a vehicle for a " star " performer and the ghost Apart from the dual role of I our and I been dead ranch, there is, however, one other character in the piece worth actmr*-the libertine and skilled duellist M de Cb iten Renaud Mr Jowett is seen at his best in this part He is incisive cool, collected The sneer of villainy is Humped upon his face He suffered, on Saturday, from the noise surrounding him in the second act. He possesses the right idea of the character. He understands it especially in the last act where the guilt haunted murderer feels the presence of his death at the hand of the man whose brother he has killed no is a capital support and contrast to Mr ltipnotj The duel between these two actors is splendidly fought Hortense do Lesparro (Mr Rignold, it will be observed, has altered the Christian name of the cb tracker I hitherto known as Emilio de desparate) is acted with grace, intelligence, and dignity by Miss Edith Blanche the remaining part' do not call for special notice But a word of praise may be given to the Madame de Franchi of Miss Mabel Ira e), the Montgiron of Mr J W Hazlitt, the Meynard of Mr Henry Hoyt, and Ihn Martelli of Mr A. L Greenaway A synopsis of the theory would be a welcome addition to the printed programme
