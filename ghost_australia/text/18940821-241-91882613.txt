Essendon set the seal on their brilliant season on Saturday aternoon by defeating Melbourne by 10 goals 6 behinds to 3 goals 3 behinds, This gives them a lead of 14 points, so that they may be adjudged the premiers. Twenty thousand spectators witnessed the game. During the first half the contest was fairly even, but on the latter portion Melbourne were clean out of it, not having a "ghost of a show." It is not easy to account for Melbourne's defeat after their previous excellent record. The other metropolitan matches resulted as follows:-Col!ingwood, 5 goals 3 behinds. North Melbourne, *4 goals 11 behinds. Pott Melbourne, G goals; Richmond, 3 goals 8 behinds. Geelong, 8 goals 10 behinds; Fitzroy, 4 behinds. Williamstown, 7 goals 5 behinds; Footctray, G goals 6 behinds. It is supposed that Corangamite's leg was broken through the horse standing off too far and getting his leg between the top and second rails of the fence. The rails are so close together that an accident of this kind seems almost impossible. Mr Allan, who gathered up the fragments of the poor brute's chattered leg, says it was the worst fracture-or series of fractures-he has ever experienced. 'The owner of Writer, the horse Corrigan rode on Saturday, is, it seems, Mr J. Cohen, the bookmaker. Under the ciscumntances, it is only natural that Mr Cohen should feel the death of Corrigan very acutely. His sorrow for what has occurred has taken a very practical turn, as he intends to give Â£100 to the Corrianu fund, and also make Mrs Corrigan a present of the horses which her husband was training for him. James Hayes made another application to the V.t.C, for his jockey's license this week, but his request was refused. Mr W. , Carter tells his constituents: "I have seen the tears stream down the Premier's cheeks in sympathy with another's trouble." "He gave to misery all he had, a tear."
