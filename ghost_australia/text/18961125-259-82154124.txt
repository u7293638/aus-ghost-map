A SUGGESTION. (To the Editor of the Examiner £ Time*.) [ Sib,-I noticed in your issue ot last week a reference to the (act that cricket this year locally is exceedingly flat owing to the superiority ol the Zingari over the three other teams competing (or the premiership. Your wriler goes as to say that any local team has not the " ghost" o( a chance o( wresting the coveted honor (rom last year's premiers, and hence the apathy in cricket circles which is to I be deplored. The question naturally arises Is there no way out of the difficulty 1 It would be unfair to expect any of the Zingari to secede (rom their club to strengthen others. A. simi-1 lar coincidence happened in Briebane last year when the Graziers had things all their own way. This season, however, the difficulty has has been got over-by the the division of the clubs into A and B ts»ms. Could not the same be done, even now, in the case of the Zingari ? If the members of the latter took the matter up thej| wpuld bB showing a true sportsmanlike apirit, and the Union.would not continually be in' its present impecunious position.' This would be the means of bringing about closer j contests, and inducing otber probable players to oome out. As it is now the vast strength of the Zingari is injuring local cricket to the extent of almost killing it. Yours, <fco" CEICKETEB.
