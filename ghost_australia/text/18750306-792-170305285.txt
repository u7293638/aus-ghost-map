The pblitical principles of that illfistribiis ; Irish Inn,n were instilled iutb me in cafrly youth. He o'ccnpicB a foremost place amongst'the Champions of rational sihd' constitutional nationality ; ahdit is'peculiarly opportune to recall to yournlittdfi his imperishable claim to the'hWe, the-gratitude, the veneration of h'is bbpntryhieh, now that this nation has riMiew'edher demand tor the legislative fights' for which he strug-*' gled. It is useful to recaljto our minds' his glorious career; to fnllbw hith. through oveiy stage of his progress, from 1 his darlifiBt efforts to secure the freedom and prosperity bf h?s country to the dark hour when he vainly 1 battled against "the eneniies. ,'of Irlbh liberty ; and 'thence to liis efforts in. tlid foreign .Parliament to ob: tain emancipation for his Catholic countrymen. He was born ih Dublin in 174G. Iii his'childhood' he liad bedri frightened by tjie stories of. ghosts hobgoblins fcithwhichnursbBfrequehtlyarousethe votis fears of children. Grattail's spirited, defiant character displayed itself even atfthis early pbriod. In order to coiiquer the superstitious fears excited by tlioafe weird nartativeB, he resorted atViight to a grave' 1 yard,''near his father's house, where' he uri^d to sit bn the gravestones, " while thb petspiratioii," sayi his son.'' streamed down hiB face." By the habit of occasionally visiting the abodes of the dead while all around was dark and silent, the Courageous ' child effectually coh'qhered his nervous sensations. Sir' Walter 1 Scott tells lis that ho was in his early years appalled by the terrifying ghost Btbries of the nurserymaids who had charge of him.; they sat at the' fire, exchanging tales of Bpectral'horrors, afterhe was put tb bed. He protected himself "from the fpat-s then- tales' Were calculated to exoiti co verihg'ti p his head rathebedclothes. B'o; that h,e' ciMild not hear their ghastly gofisip'. Scott was a brave, spirited man ; but' his mode of escaping the paift 'of superstitious'feelings when a child -gave less ptomi'ae than Qrattan'p of aresblute, determined character. 'The first school to WniChG rattan was sent, was kbpt by'Mr. Biilj in Great Ship-street. . Bail roused t^biS-e of his pupil by an insult for.'which St'ia. )inp6s6it}le to discover any palliation. 1 Qtattan' s father,' who' was 'k gpod classical .scholar, had taught the hoy to translate; a certain passage in Ovid^s Metamorphoses differently from the translation adopted by the schoolmaster. B?ilHaxod lyoring Grattan with stupidity,, ordered hSitfxo go down on his knees m presence faf his school-fellows, and directed the Servant to tell himi that he wias a very idle boy. The servant refused to obey. Grattan'was sq indignant at the insolence of Mr. Ball, that he insuteil on 1 leaving the school. ^' His' 'father tlidn placed him at the academy of, Jfr.

A fluctuationof sentiment, a er-Mr. -Pity, in the letter- from which th above- is an extract^ also says that Grattan; "from earliest life, repudiated • with indignation the dependence of the Irish Parliament, and resolved to assert, even by arms,-if driven to them, the 1 liberties of Ireland." • • In truth, patriotism was hid predominant passion. When attending in the :gallery of the English House'of Gommons at die commencement 'of the disputes wi th America, he was much impressed' by a ; speech made^by Mr. George G^enville, in which that gentleman defended the right of England to tax Amftrica, and extended his doctrine to Ireland.- Grattan said that he" believed that it' waB owing to that speech of Grenyille's that he' afterwards became so very active in his opposition to the principles of British Government in Ireland, and that the .speech filled his mind with a'horror of 'the kluctrinu it advocated. Taxation by the British Parliament without being represented in that assembly 1 was the" American grievance. Of course, taxation witlwut repres6nta is indefensible ; this, I repeat, Was the grievau.ee of America. But is taxation against representation any "better? T latter is one of our Irish- -grievances. Seventy-two Irish member^ voted' against the Irish Income-tax-; 'a majority of more thfiu two- thii-ds of the whole number. Pilt .that majority was ^overborne by the Votes of Scotch-and English riiembere whom the Union thus enabled to subvert our fundamental consiitutiohal right of uot being taxed unless'by the consent of Our Own representatives. The 'Condition to which Ireland was "reduced- by English usurpation during the last Oentury aroused the indignation of Grattato, who devoted all his energies to Emancipate liis country from the pestikitat'influence of her' nnacrupnlous-^neighbour. ' Every; branch of Irish industry which' could be; supposed to interfere with Engiish maUu-! facturing interests had beeii ''crushed; and Swift complained that %h#< J>bople woi'e actUilly atarvint; from'the tyratinioal policy of which they werb the victims.

The Irish att of; .the ^29th. pf Xing -Henry.': the Sixth makes: the same declaration. Those acta: were cited by Grattan when moving the. Declaration of. IriBh,Rights on the 22ad February, 1782.. My next quotation is taken from Leland'S "History of Ireland;", in which the Teverehdi author icites the Irish act of the 38th year of Henry the Sixth' as declaring :— • ..••:.,-•• ' That Ireland is, and' always has been, incorporated within itself by ancient lawa and customs,' acid is only to be governed by Buch laws as by the Lords and Commons of the lan in parliament ussembled have been.adyised,.
