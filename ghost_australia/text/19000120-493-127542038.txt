LASKER v. JANOWSKI. The much discussed match between these' two players, for the championship of the world, has fallen through, aa neither of tbem would give way in his contention, Lasker that it Bhould be 8 games up, and Janowski that it must be 10 games up. The consensus of opinion seems to be that LaBfcer, as the challenged party, had the right to insist upon his terms being agreed to aa long aa they were not unreasonable, and that they certainly were not. Steinitz is reported to have recently expressed his opinion that JanowBki ' bad not the ghost of a chance' of winning suoh a match .with the present champion of the world.
