Givo glory, and honor, nnd pitiful tears To all who fail in tho deeds sublime Thoir ghosts nra ninny in tho van of yonrs ' Thoy woro born with Time in advance of Timo. Oh, groat iB tho hero who wins a namo, But grontor ninny nnd many n time Some pnlo-fnceil fellow who dies in shnmo And lots God finish tho thought sublimo. And groat is tho man with a sword undmwn, Anil good is tlio man who refrains from wino : But tho man who fails nnd still lights on, Lo, ho is tho twin- brothor of. mine.
