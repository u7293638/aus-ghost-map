Little Gray Ghosts. A big farmhouse in New Jersey long stood tenantless, and had the reputation of being haunted. At laot a young farmer and his wife moved in at a merely nominal rental. An unearthly clattering on the stairs frightened the couple half out of their wits the first night, and the wife tried to persande her consort to get up end investigate. For an hour he argued desperately with her on the advisability of lyirg still. She declared that it he wouldn't investigata ehe must die or get up herself. Finally they ff-.cted a compromise by creeping out of bed togethter. They lit the lamp and lookcd cautiously out of the chamber door. The first glance solved the mystery. Big gray rquirrels literally awarmed up all the landings, and every one of them hss a big nut of some kind between his ptws. The main supply of nuts was stored in an unused garret, where some tenant had placed them long ago. The equirrels arranged themeelves in gangs on each landing, and those at the top of the house carried the nuts one by one out of the garret and sent them rolling down the stairs to the next landing, where they were met by the gang waiting for them, and pushed down another flight. In this way they reached an :ld cellar, which was evi dently the Equirrels' storeroom, for it was well stocked with nuts. They were moving -from attic to basement.
