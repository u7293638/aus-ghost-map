Tbe Manning- River Times" is reponsible for tbe following gruesome ghpst/stpry:â€” " Tho r. apparition which caused a good deal of excitement afew montbs'ago at Bungay hns again made its appearance, so' wo learn from a creditable source. . An old aDd much respected resident at Bungay (Mr R. ..Cameron) was. riding home from Wingham a few.days ago, when a man dressed in black, wearing a. high hat and riding a black' horse, rode up to him and gave a groan: Mr Cameroii was a bit unnerved, and asked : ' Who is getting murdered ?' Tbe horseman is , .said .-to have - given a heavv moan, and disappeared, over aprecipice"of about 15ft. Mr Cameron's horse was fright ened,, and bolted through the bush. Three mights , later Mr J. Cameron (son of the former) was riding home by the same route, and met with a like ex perience, when his horse also bolted. The horses cannot be got to pass the haunted spot. Mr Cameron inspected the snot where the -strange being disappeared: over the precipice the next day, but no traces of a horse's hoofs were visible. This intelligence has been received with amazement by many on the Upper Manning, as Air Cameron is too well known io be sus pected of concocting a story like the above, and too sensible to bevfrightened by a will-o'-the-wisp."
