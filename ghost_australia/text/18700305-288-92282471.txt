The matter could not reBti One talked and another talked ; and before noon next day it was known all Over the place that David Garth had been put to sleep by himself in the empty cottage. Miss rimmens attacked . Hill with her strong tongue, and told him it was enough to Erlghten the child to death. Hill was 9ullen. He would answer nothing ; and all she could get out of him was, that it was no business of hers. In vain she de manded his grounds for saying the boy had gone to Worcester by the early train ; whether he sent him— whether he saw him off? Hill said David did go ; and then took refuge in dogged silence. The schoolmistress was not one to be played with. Of a tenacious turn, she Followed out things with a will. She called in the police; she harangued people outside her door ; she set the parish in a ferment. But David could not be heard of , high or lpw. .; Since the midnight' hour, when that call of bis awoke his .mother, . ; and ; . was fl^ain jepeatedj . he seemed to have vanished. ..','. . .'.' ' '; There afpse a .rumor that- Jim Batley could teU something. Miss Timmens pounced upon him as he; was going by the school-house, conveyed lam indoors, and ordered Mm to make a clean breast of it. it was. not : much that jtm. had to tell, but that little seemed of importance to Miss Timmens, and he told it readily. One thing Jim persisted in— that the boots he saw through! ;'ihe skylight must have been David's hoots. Hill had called them his, but they were not big enough, —not inen's :i-6ots Vat all. : Hill was looking '' ghashly' white,' as if he had got a fright, Jim added, when he said David was gone off to Worceater. Perhaps it was in ttiat moment that a fear ot something' worse than had been suspedted yet dawned upon Miss Tim mens. Tying on her bonnet, she came up to Crabb Cot and asked to see the Squire. : ' It is getting more serious,' she said, after old Thomas had shown her in. ' I think, sir, Hill should be forced to ex plain what he knows. I've come here to ask you to do it.' ' '' ; ' The question is, what does he know?' Tejoined the Squire. / ' . Xi More than he hias confessed,' said Miss; Timmens, in her positive manner. ' Jim Batley stands to it that those boots must, from the size, have been .David?s boots. Now; Squire Todhetley, if David's . boots were there,^ where was David.? That is what'fl lying on my mind, Sir.' -? - ; ' What did Jim Batley see besides the bbots?' asked the Squire. \ ' Nothing in particular,' she answered. ' He said the cupboard door stood open, and hid the best part of the room. David would not be likely to . run away and leave his boots 'behind him.' ' Unless . he was in too great a fright to stop and put them x-n. ',; ' I don't think that, Sir.' . f* What is it you wish to imply ?' asked the Squire,, not seeing the drift of the. argument. - I *'% wish I knew myself,' replied Miss Timmens, candidly. 'I'm certain Hill has not told all he could tell; he has been deceitful over it from the first, and he must be made to explain. Look here, Sir;, when he got to Willow Cottage that -morning, there's no doubt he thought .Dayidwas in. Very well. He goes in i» call him ; stays a bit, 'and then comes out and tells young Jim that David had gone to Worcester. ; How 'was he to know David had gone ?^-who told him ? The boy says, too, that Hill looked ghastly, as if he had been frightened.' ' David must have gone somewhere, or he would have been in therpom,' argued the Squire: ?' He'd, not be likely to, go back after quitting it, and his mother heard him call to her in the middle of the night.' ' Just so, Sir. But-r^if Hill did not And him, why should he come out and assert that David had started if or Wor cester ? :It'a the boots that come over me,' vowed Miss TinrmeiMi ; '1 can't come to the: bottom of :'fein.;vXinean to come to the bottom of Hjjjl, though, and make him disclose what he knows. : Yoii are his master, Sir] and perhaps he will tell you without troubig. pyotPll^be so good as question him. Jg'Jhte wbn't» ¥&? have him brought up before the Bench.'' . Away went M*«h Timmens/ with a parting remark that the; school; must be rampant by that tune. *Ehe Squire sst thinking a bit, and then put on his hat and great-coat, telling me I might come, with him and hear: what iffili had to say. Weeipectedto find Hill in the ploughed field petween his cottage and : North Crabb. T5ut Hill was in his own garden ; we saw him as we went along. Without ceremony the Squire opened the wooden gate and stepped in. Hill was raking the leaves together by the -shed at the erid'of the garden. : He threw down ihe rake when he saw us, as if startled, his red face turning to white. Coming forward, he began a con fused excuse for being at home at that hour of the day, saying there was so much to do when getting into a fresh place, and that he had not been well for two days, had 'had a sickness upon him.' The Squire, never hard with the .men, told him he was' welcome to be there, and began talking about 'the garden. ; 'It is as rich a bit of land, Hill, as any in the parish, and you may turn it to good account if you are industrious. Does your wife intend to keep chickens?' ' Well, Sir, I suppose she will. The town-bred, women don't understand far about 'em, though. It may be a'most as much loss as profit.' ' Nonsense,' said ihe! Squire, in his quick way. ' Loss ! 'when you have every convenience about you I This used to be the fowl-house in Hopton's time,' he added, rapping the side of the shed with his stick. 'Why! you've been putting a padlock on it, HiH I' For the door was fastened with a pad lock ; anew one, to judge by its bright ness. TTill made no comment. He had taken up the rake again, and was raking vigorously at the dead, leaves. I wondered what he was. shaking for. ' -., . ' Have you got any treasures here, that you should, lock it up ?' ' : - *' Only the watering-can, sir, and aiew o' my garden tools,' answered Hill. ' There's a heap of loose characters about, and nothing's safe from 'em.' Putting his back against the shed, the Squire suddenly called on Hill to face him, and entered on the business he had come upon. ' Where was David Garth ? Did he, Hill, know anythingabout him V Hill had looked pale before ; I said so ; but that was nothing to the frightful whiteness that took him now. Ears, lips, neck, all tured the hue of the dead. The rake shook in his grasp ; his teeth chat tered. ' Come, Hill,' said the Squire, ' I see you have got something to. say.' But Hill protested he had nothing to say, except that the boy's absence puzzled him. The Squire put some home questions upon the points spoken of by Mis Tim mens, showing Hill that we knew all. He then told him he might -take his choice — to answer or go before the Magis trates. . : - Apparently Hill saw the futility of holding out longer: Sis very aspect would have convicted him, as the Squire said : if he had committed murder, he ,cpuklTi not „ have loqked more, guilty. jGUmcing . shudderingly around on all flides, ;as though the air had phantoms in it, he whispered his Version of the morn ing'swprk. ???'.':.', It was true that he had gone to the house expecting to'find David in it ; and it was true that when he entered he found him flown. Not wishing alarm to get to the boy's mother, he told Jim Batley. that- David had gone by early train to Worcester : he told the mother so. As to the boots, Hill declared they were : his .own, not David's ; and ;that Jim's eyes must have been; deceived :nx the size. And he vowed and declared he knew no more than this, or where David could have got to. .'? : 'What fdo yout think you deserve for locking, the child in the house by him self V*- asked the Squire, sternly. 'Everything that'll corned upon me through it,' readily acknowledged Hill. *' I could cut my hands off now for having done it ; but I never thought he'd be really frightened. It's just as if his ghost had been haunting me ever since ; I see him a-followingof 'me' everywhere.' ' His ghost !' exclaimed the Squire. ' Do you suppose he's dead 1' ' I don't know,' said the man^passing his shaking hand across his damp fore head. ''/I wish to heaven I had let him go off to his grandmother's - that same blessednight;!' . - 'Then you wish me to understand, Hiil^ that you absolutely know nothing of where the boy -may be ?' ff Nothingat aU, Sir.' , ' Don't you think it might have been as well if you had told the truth from the first?' asked the Squire, rather sar castically.. ? 'Well, Sir, one's mind gets confused at times, and I thought of his mother. I couldn't be off seeing that if anything had happened it lay on my shoulders for having left him alone in there. ' 1 ; Whether the Squire believed Hill could tell more, I don't know. I did- As we went on to the schoolhouse he kept silent. Miss Timmens was frightfully - disap pointed at the result, and said Hill was a Bhifty scoundrel. ? 'I cannot tell what to think,' the Squire remarked to her. - 'His manner is the strangest 1 ever saw ; it's just as though he had something on his con science. He said the boy's ghost seemed to haunt him. Did you :- notice that, Johnny?' , ' Yesj sir. A queeridea.' j ''He— -he-^-never could iiave found David dead in the morning 1' cried Miss Timmens, in a low tone, turning, herself, a little pale. ' Dead of fright ?' : *f That could not be,' said the Squire. u -You forget that David had made -his escape' before midnight j and was at his iriother's, calling to her.'; :? - ' True', true,' assented Miss Timmens. ' Any-way^ I^m*iertain Hill isiomehow or- other ^deceiving us, and' he- is a ;born villain for it.' : ; ; j But Hill, deceiving us though he had been, could - not hold out. vita gomg back, we saw him leaning over the palings waiting for us. But that the -man is living yet, I should have said he was going to die there and then, for he Lboked exactly like it. ! , ^ ?; i lit seemed-that '-just after : We quitted him, a policeman . had ; made his ap pearance.. ^Nbt as a policeman, ¥ut as a friend ; for he arid TTill were cronies. He told; Hill confidentially that there was 'going, to be a1 row over. that there lost boy; that. folks were saying that he rnight have been murdered ; Qiat unless Hill could tell something satisfactory about him, he and others might be in custody before the day was. over.' Whether TT111 found himself : brought to a, point from which there was neither advance nor retreat, or that he saw inevitably the concealment could no longer be maintained, or that he was stricken to despair, and helpless, I don't know. There he stood, with his head aver the palings, saying he : would tell all. It was a sad tale to listen to. Miss rimmens's last supposition was right — FTill upon going up to release David Grarth, had found - him dead. And, so far as the man's experience of death went, he must have been dead for six or seven hours, 'I'd like you to come and see him, Sir.' Gingerly stepped the Squire in Hill's wake across the garden to the shed. Un locking the door, Hill stepped back 'for us to enter. On a. mattress on ' the ground was : David, laid straight in his Bvery-day clothes, arid covered. with, a' blanket, his pretty hair, which his mother tad loved so, smoothed 'carefully. Hill —rough, burly, cross-grained Hill— burst Into, tears and sobbed like a child. ' I'd give my life to undo it, and bring him to again, Squire ; I'd give my life twice over, Master Johnny ; but I de clare before Heaven, I. never thought to barm the boy. When I see him the next morning, lying dead, I'd not have minded if the Lord had struck me dead boo. I've been a'most mad ever since.' ' Johnny,' said the Squire, in a low tone, 'go you to South Crabb, and bring over Mr. Cole. Don't talk of this.' The surgeon was at home, : and came back with me. I did not quite under stand why the Squire sent for him, seeing he could do no good. And the boots were David's, after all ; the only things he had taken off. Hill iad brought him to this shed the next light ; with some vague idea of burying lim in the ground under the leaves. ?l But I couldn't do it,' he avowed ainid tiis sobs, ' I couldn't do it.' There was an examination, Cole and mother making it, and they gave evi ience at the inquest: One of them (it was Cole) thought the boy must have died from fright, the other from cold ; and a nice muff this last must have been. 'I did not from the first like that midnight call, or the apparently causeless terror the poor mother woke up in,' said Sirs. Todhetley to me. 'The child's spirit must have cried to her in his ieath-agony. I have known a case like this before.' 'But— — '... 'Hold your tongue, Johnny. You tiave not lived long enough to get expe rience of these things.' ^Andlheldit Johnny Ludlow.
