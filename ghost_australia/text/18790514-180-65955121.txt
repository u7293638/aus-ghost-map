Immmtr. KTJBBSrSTSfN* 8 PIANO PLAYING. jm- BRQwnre description THEREOF. '3m- they say yon heird Sabenstsin play when you were in New York. Well, tell us about it.' 'What, me? I might's well tell you about the creation of the world.' 'Come, now; bo mock modesty. -3o ahead.' ??well, sir, be bad the blamedest, biggest, cattycorneredest planner you ever laid eyes on. Somethim' like a dis tracted billiard table on three legs. The Ul was h'ieted, and mighty well it was. If it hadn't been, he'd a torn the intoe inside dean out, and scattered *em to tbe four winds of heaven.' 'Played well, did her ' You bet he did ; not don't intormp* me. When he fust set down he 'peared to keer mighty little 'boat play, aad wisht he hadn't come. He tweedie-ieedle'd a little on the treble, and twoodle-oodle le ondle'd some on the bass ; just foolin' and toxin* tbe tiling's jaws for bein' in bis waj. And I says to a man flittis' next to me, a' I, what sort of a fool pteyin'is that? And be says - Hee'sh 1' Bat preeeoUy bis hands commenced obaein' one 'notber up and down the keys, like a passel of rxte aoamperiu' through a garret very swift. Parts of it wss sweet, though, and reminded one of a eng*r Eqoirrel turning the wheel of a candy cage. ' ' Now,' I says to my neighbour, ' be*e showin' off. He thinks he's a doin' of it, bat he ain't got no idee, no plan of nothin*. If he'd play me tip a tone of some kind or other, rd— ' ' Bat my neighbour says * Hee'sh I* very impertinent.' 'I was just about to git up and go home, bein' tired of that foolishness, when I heard a little bird waking op away off in the woods, and calling sleepy-like to bis mate, and I looked np and I see Baben was be ginnin' to take some interest in his busi ness, and I set down again. It waa the peep o' day. The light come faint from the east. The breeze Mowed gentle and I fresh ; some more birds waked np in ihe I orchard, then some more in the trees near I the house, and all began singin* together. I People begun to star, and the gal opened the shatters. Jast then the first beam of the sun fell upon the blossoms, a little more and it techt the roses on the bashes, and tbe next tiling it was broad day ; the son fairly blazed, the birds sang like they'd split their little tiuoate ; all the leaves was { movin' and flimliiti* diamons of dew, and j tbe whole wide world was bright and happy I as a king. Seemed to me like there was a breakfast in every house in the land, and not a sick child or a woman anywhere. It was a fine mornin*. And I says to my neighbour, 'that's music, that is.* ' But he glar'd at me like he'd like to cut my throat.' ' Presently the wind turned ; it began to thicken np, and a kind of grey mist come over things; I got low-spirited d'rectly. Then a silver rain began to fall. I could see the drops touch the ground; some flashed np like long pearl earrings, and the rest rolled away like round rubies. Zt was pretty, but melancholy. Then tiie pearls gathered themselves into long strands and necklaces, and then they melted into thin silver streams conning between golden gravels, and then the streams joined each other at the bottom, and mad; a brook that flowed silent except tiiat you could kinder see the music, 'specially wben the music went along down the valley. I could smell the flowers in the meadow. But the sun didn't shine* nor the birds sins; it was a foggy day, but not cold. The most curious thing was the little white angel boy, like you see in pictures, that ran ahead of the mnsic brook, and led it on, away oat of die world, where no man ever was — I never was, certain ; I could eee that just as plain as I see yoo. Then the moonlight came, without any sunset* and shone on the grave yards, where some few ghosts lifted their hands and went over the wall, and between the black sharp-top trees splendid marble houses rose np, with fine ladies in the lit-up windows, and men that loved 'em, but could never get anigh 'em, and played on guitars under the trees, and made me that miserable I could a-cried, because I wanted to love somebody, I don't know who, better than the men with the guitars did- Then the sun went down, It got dark. The wind moaned and wept like a lost child for its dead mother, and I could a-got np then and there and preached a better sermon than any I ever listened to. There wasn't a thing in the world left to live for, not a blame thing, and yet I didn't want the mnsic to stop one bit. It was happier to be miserable than to be nappy -without being miserable. I couldn't understand it. I hong my head and polled out my hand kerchief and blowed my nose load to keep from cryin*. My eyes is weak anyway. I didn't want anybody to be a-gazin' at me a-snivilin', and if s nobody* e business what I do with my nose. It's mine. But some several glared at me, mad as Tucker. Then, all of a-sudden, old Beuben changed his tune. He ripped and he rar'd, he tipped and ta'rd, he pranced and he charged like the grand entry at a circus. Peered to me that all the gas in the house was turned on at once, things got so bright, and I hilt up my head, ready to look any man in the face, and not afeared of nothin'. It was a circus and a brass band, and a big ball, all goin' on at the same time. He lit into them keys like a thousand of brick ; he giv 'em no rest day or night ; he set every liven joint in me agoin', and not bein' able to stand it no longer, I jnmpt, sprang onto my seat, and just hollered, * Go it, my Kube ! ' 'Every blamed man, woman and child in the bouse stared at me, and shouted, ' Pat him oat ! put him oat ! ' 'Pat your great-grand-mother's grizzly, grey, green ish cat into the middle of next month ! * I Bays, 'Tetch me if you dare! I paid my money, and you just come a-nigh me.* *' With tbat some several p'ueemen run up, aad I bad to simmer down. Bat I would a fit any fool that laid bands on me, for I was bound to hear Baby oat or die. He bad changed his tone agin. He hopt, like ladies, and tip-toed fine from eend to eend of tbe key board. He played soft and iowandeol-mn. I heard the church belle over the bills. Tbe candles in heaven was lit one by one ; I eaw the stars rite ; the grea'er organ of eternity began to play from the world's end to tbe world's end, and all the angels went to prayer*. Then tbe mueic changed to water, full of feelin' tbat couldn't be thought, and began to drop, drip, drop, drip, drop, clear and sweet like tears ot joy fallin' into a lake of glory. It was sweeter than that, it was as sweet as a sweetheart sweetenin' sweetness with while sugar, mixt with powdered silver and seed diamonds. It wss too eweet. I tell yon tbe audience cheered. Baben be kinder bowed, like he wanted to say, * Much obleeged, bat I'd rather you wouldn't interrupt me.' He stopped a minute or two to fetch breath. Then he got mad ; he ran his fingers through bis hair, he shoved op bis sleeves, be opened his coat-tails a leetle farther, be drag op his etool, he leaned over, and, sir, he just went for tbat old pianoer. He slapped her face, he boxed her jaws, he pulled her nose, he pinched her cars and scratched her cheeks till she fairly yelled. He knocked her down and stamped on her ebamefal. She belJowod like a bull, ebe bleated like a calf, ebe howled like a hound, ebe squealed like a pig, she shrieked like a rat, and then be wouldn't let her up.
