Lathoin Browne in Land and Water A CONSTANT reader of the Tenement, writing from Lugo, reports a tragic duel in that town The " Constant Reader " says that at a local cafe two Prussian officers entered and called for refreshment The place was very full, and their " orders" were not immediately complied with, whereon one of the Prussian officers exclaimed, "Are there no French officers here to serve us ? " Two Belgian officers, Routed at an adjoining table, went up to the Prussians, and observing that there were no Trench officers present, added that they would take up the cudgels for Ihmneur Francois, and challenged them. The duel was to be fought next morning. The " Constant Reader " adds, that one of the Prussians did not make his appearance on the ground. The comrade kept the appointment, and was shot dead. last Japan Herald tells the story of a friendly meeting between two worthies of the Satsuma clan and a foreigner, who, when menaced in the street by them, invited his enemies to a neighbouring tea house In the course of conversation, the guests informed their boats that their opinions of foreigners hitherto had been very unfavorable to the latter, " they had rather regarded them as a scourge to the country than anything ache, but now," rubbing their stomachs, " they felt reason to change these opinions Nations who catered for the delectation of their fellow men by concocting such divine drinks as Does' beer and Modes claret, and who sent men to distant countries to stand ' these liberally to whomsoever they might meet, could not mean harm to Japan ' They therefore intimated that eternal friend- ship and regard were the only feelings they would henceforth entertain for foreigners.
