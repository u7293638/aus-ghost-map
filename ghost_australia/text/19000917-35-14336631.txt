ST. JAMES' CHURCH. At St. James', Church, King-street, yesterday morning, the Rev. W. I. Carr Smith made reference during the course of his sermon, to utterances which had recently been made concerning Protestantism. He pointed out the trials which beset the church, and said that one of the greatest was the quarrels amongst Christian people, and instanced the remarks or rather, intended remarks-of a Romish tecle elastic on the previous Sunday. These remarks did not concern them very much. They could hardly be interested in the ideas of history of a religious body when a prominent teacher had declared that an appeal to tutor? was treason against the Holy Ghost. It would be most unworthy behaviour to try to answer the violent invectives of the preacher with the same spirit that he had displayed. The attack was undeniably an attempt to foster the works of the flesh of which St. Paul spoke in the Epistle for the day, namely, " Envy, i 'rite, rivalry, anger, and division." They might pray that the attempt which had been made to arouse (notion might be forgiven, and a better spirit allowed to prevail.
