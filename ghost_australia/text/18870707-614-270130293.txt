THE RAMBLER. That the child is father to the man is exemplified in the hogwash of Bolli var Anerel Mick’s deceased parent Bol livar Pere. It is surprising how true the theory comes at tim is, that like pro duces like, and in tliis instance the child is certainly worthy of his sire. From the babbling ignorance of Sookies’ latest it is refreshing to turn to his consumable impudence, for the former is but a repetition of his life in 'I'anga mah whereas the latter is unique and apparently, of later growth. In this gentle spirit the custom iry forms of etiqutte and good breeding are minus quantities, for in ordinary society when a person receives alook without recogni tion it is a gentle hint tliat that persons’ company is not required. Sookie how ever is like the proverbial duck, and again and again he remarks that the day is fine, without recognition; When will the offensive civility ceas° and he retire to the odour of his dearly lieloved! kitchen. . i * * * • How was it composed? how: put to gether and what is it—this production of B >livars’ fatlfer ?
