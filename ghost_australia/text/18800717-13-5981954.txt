CURRENT LITERATURE. Mr P W. Clayden, who has written England under Lord Beaconsfield (C Kegan Paul and Co. ) would probably resent being included in the tribe of political lam- sooners whom the recent political crisis in England has brought forth, but though his book is a stout octavo volume of over 100 pages and calls itself The Poh heal History of Aix Years it is nothing more than a pamphlet written to suit a passing occasion. The author in his preface ventures to hope that the careful contemporary study which he has been able to give to the events will do something to facilitate the fuller understanding of the political characteristics of the time and expects that thoughtful people on all sides will take their impressions of those events from him lins professions of fairness is scarcely carried out in the body of Mr Clayden s work, which is one long bitter diatribe against the Beaconsfield Administration in which, while every means tency hesitation, and failure is care fully noted, not a single word is said by which the student of history in the future will gather a hint of the extraordinary and unparalleled difficulties of the position As a specimen of Mr Claydon a mode of writing history we may take his account of the transactions which led up to and were followed by the resignation of Lord Derby) In this while the important part played by Lord Derby) is passed over without a single word of comment or animadversion, of any allusion to the fact that the Foreign Secretary of Lord Beaconsfield s Administra- tion down to the close of 1877 shared in, and was chiefly responsible for the policy of the Government, the whole responsibility of that policy is by imph cation, if not by direct charge, laid upon Lord Beaconsfield Yet posterity will hardly fail to be reminded from other and more impartial sources that it was Lord Derby who rejected the Berlin memorandum ; Lord Derby), who wrote that famous despatch of the 6th of May, 1877, defining British interests , Lord Derby who agreed to the Bend, mg of the British fleet first to Boaika Bay and then to the Dardanelles for " the protection of British life and property , Lord Derby who, as late as December 13, 1877, three weeks after the fall of Plevna, wrote to St Petersburg to say that "the Queen's Government must hold themselves free to take whatever course might appear to them necessary for the protection of British interests, ' Lord Derby who made that pertinacious resistance to the entrance of England into the Berlin Congress unless the whole of the treaty of San Stefano were submitted for discussion According to his own account, given in the House of Lords, Lord Derby resigned his seat in the Cabinet because the Queen's Government, in fulfilment of his own threat made to Russia only a few weeks before, did take the measures which they deemed necessary for the protection of British interests those measures being the calling out of the reserves, the despatch of the Indian troops to Malta, the occupation of Cyprus, with the further design of an embarkation on the Syrian coa it which was afterwards abandoned We do not pretend to anticipate what the verdict of posterity may be on these transactions, but it is impossible to accept Mr Clay don's work as anything else than a speech on behalf of the prosecution Captain Lovett Cameron's book entitled Out Pacific Highway to India (Macmillan and Co ) bears on its title page at least a political complexion, but in the body of it is nothing more than a record of travels from the Syrian coast to Bagdad, through Mesopotamia Captain Cameron, who is the African traveller distinguished as the first who traversed that continent from east to west, seems to have undertaken IMB journey in connexion with a scheme, of which the Duke of Sutherland is one of the promoters, of a railway from Tripoli, in the Mediterranean, to Bushire, in the Persian Gulf, through Aleppo, Mosul, and Bagdad This route, which he has thoroughly explored, he contends to be the best of all those which have been proposed for our future highway to India, offering the minimum of engineering difficulties and the maximum of commercial advantages " In no part of the world, our traveller assures us would a railway have such important political and commercial results as the Indo Mediterranean in scarcely any would a line of such length and importance meet with so few physical difficulties to be overcome, and be constructed at so small a coat and with so great a prospect of financial success With the first of these propositions we shall all agree Captain Cameron has amply demonstrated in these pages that as to the physical difficulties there are none which could not be easily overcome by science As to the political advantages of such a railway, so far as the two countries are concerned whose interests are most nearly affected, namely England and India, there can also be little doubt It is only those who have raised the cry of "Peach India, who believe that it is no part of our national policy to maintain an Eastern Empire and to strengthen and multiply our communications with the same, who can refuse to admit the immense value of the proposed third route to India by way of the Euphrates At the same time we must not forget that almost as soon as Captain Cameron s book has appeared there has taken place a great change in the political mind of the English people , a change of which it is impossible for us at present to gauge the extent but which seems to indicate a reaction in favour of parochialism as against imperialism and what may be called centrifugaham as against centripetaliBtn in regard to the British colonies and possessions To the school of poll teams represented by Mr Gladstone and Mr Lowe the former of whom once told us that we did not want the Suez Canal because we could always go round the Cape of Good Hope, and the latter of whom wrote an C39av to prove that India was of no value and that the sooner we were rid of it the better Such a scheme as that of the Euphrates Valley railway is not likely to commend itself he cause of its political advantages As to the commercial port of the project, we are not so confident as Captain Cameron seems to be There is no doubt that a railway could be con- structed at something much less than the Suez Canal has cost but where is the money to come from The Suez Canal was a scheme in which all Western Europe was interested, which the rulers of 1 got, for their own alike, were bound to support But a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf would be of little use to any one else than to England. The Turkish Government even if it were able to do so, could scarcely be expected of their own in resources to construct and keep up such a railway Granted that a considerable internal traffic would be created it would certainly not be sufficient in such a poor and thinly) populated legion to pay any considerable portion of the expenses of such a work The feeling of the native population on the subject may be gathered from a conversation which Captain Cameron had with a shrewd old Arab of Harsh, who make 1 him whether, if the railway were constructed he would be able to go to Bagdad for nothing. " When told that he would have to pay he said he did not see much good in it, as all he would have to do now would be to load Boyne camels with provisions for the road, mount his mare, and start This he said, would cost him nothing, and he could not understand that the railway could be cheaper, though the fare would be less than the cost of the corn and other things he would have to take, as they were all his own A railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, to be commercially successful, needs as the first con dition preliminary a strong Government in Turkey) If it is to be constructed by British capital, as it must be if it is constructed at all, the investors must have some security that their money will not be thrown away Such a security can only be given when British IWthorityiB not only in name, but in fact, paramount in Asiatic Turkey Avers the convention of June, 1878, to be carried out thoroughly, it should be fronts own justification such a guarantee, no doubt would exist But what hope is there that under the Government which has now come into power that this engagement will he anything east than a dead letter ' Apart from the question of the Euphrates railway, there is a good deal in Captain Cameron a book to make it very interesting to the general reader He is an experienced traveller and has an easy plea 45 sant style in the narration of his adventures though on such a route it is not his fault that he has little to tell us that a new or striking of the people or the countries through which he passed Among the many volumes of poetry which have been recently published, one of the worst perhaps, among the many bad, as Mr J M Ashley a Battle of Senate, and one of the best among the few good is Mr Stedman's lyrics and Idylls (C Kegan Paul and Co) The Battle of sense is an astonishing piece of work, which compels us to acknowledge how infinite are the depths of dullness and self conceit The imagination can hardly l conceive a man making a greater loss of him r self than to publish-we may excuse him for writing a long poem in such a strain as A this - s On snow white charger Odo Bat, Tile cavalry with him, W alter? the Great Duke s coming, that The fight might then begin ' Here is a man whose head Charles Lamb would have liked to feel in a different vein IS ylrnl-i√≠io/is Dream (Griffith and Farran) by an author who has discreetly chosen to be anon) mous which might have been inspired by the ghost of the late Mr Whalley in a poetical frenzy Mr John Payne, who has issued New Poems (Newman and Co), is a more considerable pretender to the gift of poesy, who calls himself of the French school, which means that he is a devout admirer of Baudelaire, and shares Mr Sinn burnes enthusiasm for the author of Made moisellede Mauptn. As to the rest Mr Payne is as musical-melancholy as most of his tribe His specialty is that he does upon death, a passion which is all the more disinterested seeing that he looks not for " heavens and a new life beyond ' He only wants to hide his weary face within her breast. He has loved her (that is, Death) for many years " She is dear to him, though reviled by men, as " the angel of the end of tears ' In fact, Mr Pa) ne may be said to be the Mrs Gammidge of modern poetry, from whose dolorousness the reader will be glad to escape into the company of Mr E C Stedman, an American poet, who has nothing in him of the fleshly or deathly, but who is all life, ease, grace, and good company We have seldom in these latter days, when Walt Whitman has been ex- sailed into the highest place by critics like Mr Ruskin and Mr Rosetti, come across a volume of poems so fresh, genial, and spirited so rich with the true glow of nature, so full of faculty and vision of that old school which is still the newest and truest-as this of Mr Stedman's, and it is surprising to think that, having written for some years past, his name should not have been earlier made known to the English public The extracts from the journals of Count Moltke, which have been given to the world under the head of Notes of Travel (C Kegan Paul and Co ), are scarcely of sufficient interest to justify their publication They contain the records of journeys made in the Roman Campagna, in Spain, and through France, at various dates, full of shrewd observation, bat insufferably dry and dull There is scarcely any trace in them of the quality which the world has since recognised as genius in the famous Prussian strategist The Spanish part of Count Moltke's travels is disfigured, through the carelessness or ignorance of his editor, by ludicrous blunders The hero who claims that he " knows how to he silent in seven languages, has unquestionably good reasons for reticence in Spanish, Seeing that he is ignorant of it, though, like all travellers, fond of using Spanish phrases His version of the famous proverb about Seville is thus given "Che. non ha vista Sevilla no he visits made, which is calculated to puzzle a Spaniard not a little being a blunder in substance and absurd in its geography The saying about Seville is -"Que no ha visto Sevilla no he was to Mara villa," which the people of Granada have capped by saying-" Que no he was to Granada nohavistonada she who has not been Granada has seen nothing) Perhaps the most interesting portion of this little book is that which describes a visit paid to the Emperor Napoleon in 1850, the author being them in the suite of the Crown Prince of Prussia In that character he was lodged in the Tuileries, and partook of the hospitalities of the Imperial Court, little dreaming of the time when it would be his lot to direct the I armies of Germany against the capital which he then admired It is curious to note Count Moltke a remark after a review of the Imperial Guard in the Place du Carrousel, that their march past was so badly done that "our officers would have sent them all back to drill of Napoleon III , he observes that he has none of the gloomy earnestness of his great uncle, he has not the same Imperial bearing nor the manner adopted by the first Napoleon to impose upon others He is rather small, of simple manners, and Ina countenance, always in repose, gives the decided impression of genial benevolence He has evinced prudence daring firmness, and self confidence, and, at the same time, moderation and gentle ness, all veiled by outward composure of manner It is only in the saddle that he looks like an emperor How much of this character was true we know now-after Sedan In the series of The New Pluto,) ch has been published a life of Joan of Arc, by Miss Janet Tuckey (Marcus Ward and Co which, though written with much spirit and elegance, has not much pretension to rank as history Miss Tuckey is one who be here not only in the punt and goodness of the Maid of Orleans, but in the genuineness of her inspiration It is refreshing to come across so simple and perfect a faith in these unbelieving days Miss Tuckey writes, not only that Joan he lieved that she heard voices from heaven but that she actually did hear them as well as see St Catherine and St Margaret and some of the hierarchy, who fought on the side of France during the war If this is true, the exploits of the maid lose much of their marvellousness no have no more interest in reading them than in residing of those favoured heroes of the dead who were whisked away by tod resides out of clouds whenever they were getting the worst of it St Catherine or Venus it is ill one The intercession of the supernatural, which MISS Tuckey tells us its ally took place in France to help Charles VII against the English, deputes the war nora on the French side of much of their glory) and lessens the wonder of Joan of Arc There is no doubt that the English soldiers under talbot were thoroughly persuaded that they were fighting against other than mortal enemies and hence the sudden panic and Btrmifce defeats which they experienced at the Inn also those whom they had been accustomed to thrash easily and when they pleased. The execution of the Maid of Orleans however bomb crops it may appear in our eyes was an act quite consonant with the spirit of the age nor must the burden of it be laid, as Wits Tuckey seems to think, upon the HLJIBII France equally with nglind shares in the responsibility of the deed, the truth being that Joan was burnt because she was a witch, and not because she delivered France from the English, the Church being the promoter of the burning One of the queerest books of travel it has ever been my lot to attempt to read is Desert Life, by B Solymos, civil engineer (AWU Allen and Co ) written in a jargon of German Oriental 1 English most fearful and wonderful B Solymos was sent into the Soudan he tells us on an engineering expedition and the idea has seized Turn to describe his life there in what he imagines to be a series of word pictures But the result is a kaleidoscope looked through the wrong end an arrangement of colours without harmony or proportion-a blurred, misty, dull effect, out of which we gather no coherent, lack whatever of what life in the deceit may be
