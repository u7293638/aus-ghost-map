as IDG AL COMEDY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir, Perhaps many of your readers have experienced certain serio-comic al sensations at meetings when listening to speeches proposing votes of thanks learned, of course, by acclamation-to chairmen and others who are receiving salaries or stipends, more or less large, for performing just such duties or similar lines as those they happen to have discharged on the occasion. I suppose it is a pleasant and polite finish to the proceedings, and unless the gentleman charged with " the very pleasing duty, which he wishes had fallen into abler hands ' become seized with a sudden fit of garrulity, and in spite of his assurance that he will not detain the meeting," dove lops his " few words " into a long speech, the only result is that the meeting disperses a few minutes later than otherwise. The custom, if not altogether harmless, is pardonable enough , but is it likely to be so if it creeps into our courts of law ?
