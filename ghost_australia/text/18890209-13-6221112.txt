OUR GREAT GUM FORESTS. BY TELEMACHUS. III. There has been a good deal of practical forestry in the laying out and adornment of Echuca. The streets are better planted, perhaps, than those of any other town in Victoria. The bluegum craze has been avoided, and therefore the plantations now well matured are not becoming scraggy and ragged. The pines, constantly taking root downwards and sending shoots upward, will increase in size and in beauty for a hundred years to come. The elms are making trunks and crowns which to the next generation will show forms as noble as the elm avenues of the Stuarts in England displayed to the later kings of the house of Brunswick. Grevilleas seem almost to have completed their growth, and to rank with the pepper plant and the crotons as great ornamental rather shrubs than permanent shade trees. And there is one tree very beautiful, and amiable tor street planting, which is not conspicuous in Echuca. It is the white blossoming thorny acacia, whose fragrant blossoms make true Maytide of our November in the streets, and whose foliage increases and deepens through all the heat of summer. But how strange it is that while all this care is bestowed on the trees of the streets and the parks, nobody seems to have had a thought for the great gum forest which once covered all the town common and the waste lands adjoining, and is now represented by countless stumps and saplings growing in no order and to no profit. A little labour and care would make a noble forest there—a park and a forest at once, in- creasing in beauty and value with every year. And the commonage need not be destroyed by such work as this. Only the goats would have to be exterminated, and goats are un- clean beasts, and destructive, and provocative of bad temper, and, indeed, amongst neigh- bours. It would be scant loss if they were utterly killed out of the land. Echuca looks best when bathed in the morning dew, as we saw it making a day- light start for the Barmah and Yielima forests. No dust m the streets, a refreshing coolness in the air. The still, deep foliage casting long shadows, and the horse trough running over with clear cool water, making a rivulet in the roadside channel. As seen thus, its broad verandahs and balconies all embowered in foliage, its green blinds down, and the red geranium burning amongst the leaves, I thought the old Palace Hotel seemed about as well planned and restful a place as a weary traveller could desire, and yet we were not loth to depart, for once out- side in the early morning of summer, there is no desire to re-enter any abode, particularly when a pair of well groomed and fast-looking horses are yoked up to a comfortable buggy, and the programme is a 20 mile spin before breakfast, with 50 more, probably, to be got over later on. Mr Little, livery stable keeper, of Echuca, supplied us with our pair that day, and between 6 in the morning and half past 3 in the afternoon they took us over between 60 and 70 miles of fast travelling on moderate roads, and still had a spurt left in them for the avenue which led up to their own stable door. We made for Barmah, along the northern, New South Wales bank of the river, and round a bend of this, only seen from the bridge approaches, were some tremendous stacks of sawmill logs, enough, it would appear, to serve the mills at Echuca for six months to come, and to render absurd that cry about the stoppage of the mills which was raised against the new regulations. Doubtless, however, the millers had a reason, and if not the agitators amongst the towns- folk would find one for them. Once over the bridge and through the old Moama town there is little to induce one to linger on the way. Sixteen months ago I had travelled the same road when the floods were out, and a milky-looking sheet of water was rippling through the trees half-way to Deniliquin. No water now ex- cept in the deep lagoons and the river. The road is dusty, the floor of the melancholy box forest bare of anything that would tempt any living creature to linger, save perhaps snakes, and lizards and flies , and how the flies may live I wot not, but the fly-catching birds should certainly be fat. In a few places by the track the water has been held in some deep pools of the billabongs, and here the red gums grow green and umbrageous, spreading broad arms over the pools where a rich red weed or a carpet of tiny water lily leaves makes coolness for the fish below, and food for the duck and teal, who rise in thousands. If an Australian gentleman would en- close one of these pools in his pleasure grounds, and carpet all the ground beneath the gums with close green grass, he would have something beautiful and new to show to Knglish visitors, particularly if be put up a few " no shooting" boards, and encouraged the white cockatoos and pink galahs to scream about the tree tops, and the gorgeous parrots to flit unmolested through the shade. But the Australian gen- tleman spends too much time and money in Toorak and Belgravia to think about such matters as these, and the only traces of de- velopment or civilisation we see on our fifteen miles drive to the punt are a few miles of fencing, some acres of rung trees, the gradual destruction of the pines and beautiful scrub growth on the sand ridge, the straight cleared road, and the single tele- graph wire. We drift across the fast-falling water in the crazy old punt, and halt for a moment at the shanty, whose exterior would scare appetite away from any but a desperately hungry man, and three miles down the creek reach the ranger's house. A half dozen settlers' houses are passed on the way, some bare of any signs of civilised occu- pition as blackfellows' huts, others with splendid green hedges about very negligently- kept gardens It is a matter of much surprise to me that none ol our big freehold squatters look with a careful regard to possibilities at these bright green hedge-rows, which in times of severe drought flash like bands of emerald on the bare grey plains. They might have been noticed from our railway lines through all that fierce drought which made the tail of the old year on actual firebrand. The stranger imagined what they might be - green reed growth by a water pool, perhaps, or irrigation patches carefully tended. Nothing of the sort. They were simply old whitethorn or boxthorn fences, or de- ciduous trees, whose roots were deep down in the subsoil, which felt not the scorching of the drought, and possibly derived a little genial influence from the subterranean water stores. Far out on our hot north-eastern plains in December last, whitethorns were sending out fresh green shoots 2ft. long, though close beside even the kangaroo grass was dried up, and clover bobs and leaves crumbled into dust when touched. Might not some other plants - edible, nutritious, and not sensitive to close cropping - be found, which would, saved through a good season, supply a store of teed lor the most severe and prolonged drought? Some of the surplus revenues of our great squattages might very well be devoted to the answering of such questions as this, but that they are so fre- quentlv wanted for experiments of another sort - to discover, that is, if it is possible, to plant human trees of Australian bourgeois growth in the higher social circles of the old world. So amid the parched pastures the parable of the green shrub is preached in vain. How, indeed, should we expect it to be otherwise! Is it reasonable to suppose that the generation which has killed out millions of acres of magnificent fodder plants should be disposed to seriously regard the work of planting those of a new order? As well expect the selectors who have been accustomed to kill out a tree as they would kill a kangaroo or an emu to look kindly on a tree-preserver or tree-planter.. This is the great difficulty in the way of introducing a new and intelligent system of forestry. You must utterly change the sentiment of the people. The great majority of the selectors who have done any earnest work in cultivation remember the time when they were killing out the "cussed" timber, as the hardest in their lives, and killing timber in any way, either ringing or grubbing is about as hard work as a white man cares to do. One might get at the selectors in this way if it were possible to quote any instances of men who had made money out of their timber, but, unluckily, that in Australia is just what you cannot do. There is the example of South Australia clearing £5,000 a year after paying a large and costly staff of officers, but that is too big for a selector's understanding, and really is not apt to his circumstances. He knows what he can make by running 30 head ot cattle. It is not more than he would get out of a quarter of an acre of tomatoes, but it is something that comes without pain- ful labour, two or three days a year muster- ing and branding, an occasional trip to market, and his money is bagged. The selector on Barmah and Yielima and the reserves further up the river will fight harder than those below for their common rights, and, indeed, they have already made their voices heard. Seventeen thousand acres on the lower end of the reserve was granted as commonage, and is managed by trustees ap- pointed by the commoners, while the larger portion of the reserve is subject to the direct control of the Forestry department. There are between 1,500 and 2,000 head of stock running on the reserve now, and Mr Forest, the ranger, works as hard as any station overseer in their management. It is ridiculous to call him a forester, in the modern acceptation of the term. His days are divided between receiving and delivering stock, hunting up and prosecuting trespas- sers, and performtng all the other duties which appertain to the position of Crown lands bailiff. If he had all the knowledge of a complete corps of German yagd- meisters, it would be of no service to him He has scarcely time to plant a cabbage in his garden, not to speak of a tree in the forest. He can keep an occasional eye on the sawmillers, but they do not frequently trespass against the law, their great present interest being to maintain it as it is. But Mr Forest hass been a good servant of the state. He has advocated forest reser- vation here for many a year, and has been the chief instrument in preventing the forest fringe of the Murray from Echuca upwards from falling wholly into the hands ot selectors, and so to utter destruction. And this domain which he has managed so long will some day be a marvellous possession to the state. As on the Gunbower, nature has provided abundantly for the work of re- forestation. There has been seed enough shed probably to plant the whole of Aus- tralia, and enough has been germinated by the floods to plant Victoria. We ride through miles and miles ot the now familiar groves and seedling beds, and understand that the work of making the cultivated forest here will be simple as it is urgent. Only the whole territory must be handed over abso- lutely to the foresters, and the foresters must study the interests of saw-millers, splitters, and selectors as best they can. So we con- cluded on the first day of our journey - so we are now more firmly resolved than ever. And we arrive at the Moira lakes which are, and probably will ever remain, a sportsman's paradise in Victoria. I had seen them before, when the term lake was no misnomer, when the tall gums fringed a great shining sheet of water, and the duck hunters paddled their canoes over miles and miles of shallows, beneath which the green grass could be distinctly seen, like the green weed which sometimes covers the sea floor , but now the water had all flowed away, the river was down, the lakes were drained, and we looked across a great green oasis bright as a cornfield before the tall stalk has put out a tassel, little points rising out from the mainland of the gums, and islands standing out in the centre, each with a noble growth of timber which has never been thinned. It is a beautiful and characteristic bit of Australia, having all the largeness and breadth which we get on the downs, or the great plain, but a freshness and pleasant contrast and harmony in colour such as the Australian traveller is rarely privileged to enjoy. The sky is intense, unclouded blue , the gums in the near foreground dark but shining, fading away in the distance to a cobalt, which meets the sky line in grey. Nor is there any lack of life or colour in the picture. Two or three hundred kine are visi- ble in the shade of the trees, dotting in reds and browns and whites, with all the intermediate grades known in the colours of the cow kind, with as charming an irregularity as an artist could desire. Immediately over our heads the great white cockatoos spread their saffiron crests and scream in defiance or consternation, while the flocks of galahs display their rose pink under feathers as they rise to higher boughs. Out amongst the reeds ibis and crane are feeding in flocks, native companions idle in the sunshine or waltz on a patch of short grass beneath some big tree's shade. Swans are seen in tens of thousands, and duck, with all manner of the lesser sort of waterfowl, are innumer- able, though till disturbed invisible, by reason of the tall grass growth covering their feed- ing grounds. But look! far away yonder is a puff of blue smoke, and before the report is heard across the lake, a cloud is seen to rise like locusts from a cornfield. They break into many flights, and for a minute or two fairly fleck the sky, but in a little while some have come down again, and are cowering on the grassy cover. Others are winging a wild flight across the gums to the river, or more distant feeding grounds, and while the little smoke wreath creeps like a wraith through the tree topa, a wedge shaped flock of ibis comes driving down with clamourous flight, and there is peace and stillness again till another report. A good many ducks may have been killed and wounded by that single shot, for though law and proclamation are against the use ot swivel guns, cunning devices are used to evade the law. Guns are common enough about the river, which a man can bardly carry to his shoulder, with great bell mouths such as projected from embrasures of mediæval fortresses. They spread their charges over a whole flight, and bring scores of birds down wounded and dead - the dead, doubtless, to be generally gathered and bagged, but the wounded too frequently to creep away to cover and die in misery.
