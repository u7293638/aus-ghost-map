CHAPTER XXIII. Cut on the streets they paused. A theatre or any place of amusement was out of the question, for Cicely dared not stay out any later than half-past 9. Then a luminous ■idea came ito Douglas.. . ','. ".Why on earth shouldn't you come to-nij .rooms ?" he asked. "I can give you some decent coffee and read you 'the first chapter o.f any novel." She hesitated, Unit ibarely for a'moment. " It sounds deligh!t'ful ( "^she admitted. "V\\\ come. Glad to. Isn't it lovely to/be in this great o'lty, and to know what freedom is ? ■to do ivihat seems well, and hear nothing of that, everlasting 'other people say.'

"It is our extreme youUh," she murmured, •gently ibut firmly withdrawing them. "In a year's time all this will seem crude; to you." " ln: a year'is time," he answered, looking down at 'her, suddenly thoughtful, "I will remind-y ; ou of fahalt speech." . . She sighed, Ibut '(her gravity -was only for a moment. . JShe was chattering again gaily by the 'til'me .Uhey reached the. street whero Douglas's rooms were. He Qed her up the stairs, ill-carpeted and. narrow. His room" •hOxA never 'seemed so small and;shabby.;as when at last 'tihey reached lit, and he threw the door open. ... She walked at once to the window. The Houses 'Ot Parliament, Westoninster, the. tthames.were all visible. A. hundred lights flashed upon tlie emibankmeats. and across the bridges; away, opposite, a revolving series of • illuminations proclaimed the sur passing quality fff a •well- known.whisky.. Westwards, a .-glow, of fire Tiung over the -oity from (Leicester Square and the theatres. She gazed at it all fascinated. . ; * " Wliat a wonderful view, Douglas," she ; exclaimed. .. -. He rose up hot from his struggles with a refractory lamp and came to her side. !A sound of bubbling and.a pleasant smell of coffee proclaimed .the result of his labours. "I have never yet tired of looking at it," he answered. "<l have no blind, as you see, and at night I have had my writing table, here and the window open. 'Listen." He threw up the sash. A deep, monoton ous roar, almost like the incoming tide* of the sea, fell upon their ears. " You hear it," he said. " That is life, that rolling of wheels, the falling of a thou sand footsteps upon the"pavement, men and women going to their pleasures, the out casts and the parasites bearing them c6m pany. •It is like the sea. 'It is always there. It is the ever-beating pulse of humanity.'.' IH"e closed the window and led her to an easy chaif. "Cissy," he said, "do you know, this is what we always talked of, that I should write a story and read it first to you? Do you remember?" "Yes," she answered softly. " I remem ber." , "We didn't anticipate this," he looked around. "Don't judge.me altogether by my surroundings. To tell you the truth, when I started I went too much to the other ex- trcme. t discovered I had made a mistake, so I sold up and found myself in debt. I am earning plenty of money, but I have to economise to get clear. This novel-is going to set me. straight." iHetook come loose pages up In his hand. She looked over Ms shoulder. "You haven't improved a bit in your writ- Ing," she exclaimed. "Do_let me., type it ifor you." ' > # . .. - "You; shall, with pleasure,'.' he answered. "I.believe you're the only person -who could rea.d it.'.' ..,, . . • She laughed, and took her coffee from hl W. . - .-. . . ' '■"Please light a cigarette," ehe beggsd. " I loathe the taste, but the perfume is 'dV lightful." ' iHe obeyed her, and ehe arranged the lamp so that the light fell iinon the sheets which -he had gathered, up too his hand.Then Bhe leaned back in her chair and listened. . "Well?" ' ' She sat up and faced him, her face flushed with excitement, her eyes flashing soft fires. 1 There is nothing I can say beyond this," she cried. "It is,the sort of book which I always hoped and believed that one day you would write." " "You like it ?" " Like Is no word. It is magnificent." * He laughed at her, , .' ! .. ""If all my critics were'like you.""' She sigfhed; ~ " ■ ■ . ' ; "I 'am only afraid of one thiiig," she .said. ,-- " When-it is fihishecTand published you will be a-great"man. "■': You' will be so far off.- I think I wish that "it-were not quite so clever. It makes me feel lonely." He came over and sat upon the ann of her chair. She -ivas very sweety* very dainty, very pretty. He was'sure he loved her. "Cissy," he said, "you need never be afraid of that. Whatever might happen in the future, I shall never enjoy an evening more than this one. It rests with you to say whether we may not have many more." "With me?" She looked up at "him quickly. From where she sat he could sco her" bosom rising and falling quickly. Then he started suddenly away—--Cicely sat up in terror grasping the sides of her : chair. There was a sharp knock at the closed door. "Is Mr. lesson in ?" a soft voice asked; "Who is it?" Douglas cried, in blank amazement. . : . ' .;. ; , . ' The door opened, and a woman in a long opera'cloak and rustling skirt,gathered. up in her hands, glided in. It was the Countess de Reuss." She stood in a little halo of lamplight, a diamond star flashing in her hair, and her neck ablaze with gems.' She was dressed to make her bow presently in the honour 6t Rdyalty, her dress .decol'eitte, her figure superb, her jewels famous' throughout the world.. Cicely looked at her and gasped— Douglas was speechless. She herself main tained a magnificent composure, although she had, as a matter of faot, received a shock. .. • ' ' " I admit, my, friend," she said, holdin& out her hand to. Douglas, " that my visit is unusual, but I can assure you that I am not a ghost. Try my fingers ; they are very real." Douglas recovered himself, and drew a long breath. .. ; -< "I am very'gladto gee you," ne said,-"but if I had had any idea that you really wished to see me, I would have spared you the • trouble of coming. to such ah outlandish place." .■■'•■ , ' "Oh, believe me, I have rather enjoyed it,", she answered him. "My coachman is con vinced that I -am mad; and my maid is eu're. of it. Won't you introduce me to your friend—your sister, perhaps'?" . . ';'•' Dotiglas preserved his composure. 1 :"This is my cousin,- Cicely Strong;''. .he, said 1—" the Countess de (Reuss.

T 'Cicely was timid and nervous, nor did she 'at all understand the situation. The Oountees nodded to her ikindly. " You have a very clever relation," she said. "We are all expecting great things from him. Now: let me tell you, 'Douglas, why I have come. There are two men'com ing'to see me to-morrow whom you posi tively must meet—one is IMr. Anderson, who owns .the great Provincial - Syndicate of.

I've asked them purposely for you, ana you see I've taken some pains to make sure of your coming." • "It is very good pf you," iDouglas replied. "I will come'bf cbviree with pleasure." " At 8 o'clock," she said, gathering up her pkirts in_to-her hand. "Now good-bye, .young people." . ' ' ' ' "•' 'She nodded- pleasantly and turned away; Douglas took the lamp and hurried to the door.

" Bourgeois." " Maybe. I believe my ancestors ivere ■ shopkeepers." ' " And the little cousin ?" she eaid, look ing at him sideways. "She is the dearest little girl in the world," he answered heartily. " I am not sure that I approve of her, though," the Countess said gaily, "not, at any rate, if_ it has been she who has kept you away from me all this time." There was a more personal note in her conversation—the touch of her fingers upon his arm was warm and firm. Thinking of these things, Dougla? didn't hear the rustle ■of a skirt behind them as they stepped out upon £he (pavement. The Countess saw it and kept him (talking there lightly for a moment. When at last .she let him go, and he ran upstairs, he nearly dropped the lamp ihe was carrying in surprise. For his little room was empty. . Cicely was gone;
