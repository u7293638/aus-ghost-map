THE SYDNEY '.' GHOST. (by teleqbaph.) , . ,, . Si-JWEr, Tuoeday. In reforenco to tho ghost etory at Strawberry Hille, it appears that a widow and two children had previously occupied the house for throe months, aud receutly vacated it. Sho utterly discredits the story told by the police. As an explanation, sho states that a email fox-terrier, her property, has been very fond of climbing to a small actic at the foot ? of the ; stairs, which are very steep, and when she removed to , her . present residence the dog would sometimes go back to his old house if the door was open, bo as he.could resume pos session of his former lair. One day previous to the eventful night, a lady who lives in the vicinity, and ; has possession of tho keys, lent them to some intending tenants to inspect the house, and on their return the back door ? had been left open. Most pro bably tho dog was sitting on tho step, aud wbon the constables hove in sigbt.be went upstair?. In their en deavour to approach him on their final retirement he probably followed thorn down again. At any. rate tho dog was away from home that night and re turned again on the following day.
