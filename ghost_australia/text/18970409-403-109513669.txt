. » MINE -OWN MAl/rEE," By A MlLbOVBNE Gibl. Continued froiti last issue. That evening when I went home I ^as loud with ,prfti^a^Mr. Eeiix. _ ^Really, tgptljer, I would jikt j^ou IfoMipwJiiiKI j3uperipjr^man, and I saw two books in his boat—his, I; 8npposei~i^se|^Vs«iei9is and Rusr grin's -4t &even; Lamps or Architecture.' ^Wha^cio you..t^^..^£,(thaji ?" ;.. i /^ps^^i^ijaUy.t " The last,passenger left them in the boat," said she. " He has a lovely forehead -anda beautiful voice too," I went on. "I don't suppose the latt passenger left ;tbem behind." " Mary, Mary," said mother, ^ don't argue, Sybil, dear, don't tease Mary. Did you find the young man civil?" " As civil as an orange," sai<l I. " Tell Mary, mother, not to mention our name to this boatman. One never knows who these people are." (Sybil cannot forgive Mr. F«Iix for not sitting tor her.) ' Oh, very well," I'replied, "I won't." We,went out everv day ; it oame to. he the only thing 1 cared about. I found iriyself impatient [or liie time we should start, and spent, a fearful time dressing oiyself, taking infinite pains in waving and ceiling up my hair, I wore iny freshest print frocks and my pretty sunburnt straw hat with the wreath of scarlet poppies that suited me beautifully, and my besi shoes, that didn't feel half so pretty as they.looked. Every day we stayed out till the sun was low. Mother and Sybil asked ine " bow on earth 1 c suld be bothered goingout in tbat everlast ing dingy." The more I w. nt the better T liked it and the better I liked Mr/Felix. Sometimes I used to catch him Ipoking at me, and he would im mediately be busy baiting hooks. 1 had a feeling that, although I was nearly eighteen and a half, and a well brought up young person, 1 was begin ang-to lilte Mr. Felix and that Mr. Felix was beginning to like me, and .tbffctjt he a very good thin*, indeed .ii; Fate should decree h t h fishing excursions be stopped. Bu I was happy, and the world looked bright- just then, bo I went bliidiyon. l One afternoon Mr.! Felix and I were, talking; Emma was asleep. _W«j. ' were drifting; towards the sunset,' ^)Je|^s of when I looked up iand lCw.tJiat it was getting dark fast. ■ 6h,™ I gasped/ ""Mr.,Felix, it is so late; it will lie dark before we gei: jtd ^^ihe pjer. £. Myv- mother will be ,anx^us.|J^)b,;row:!quick]y back." j ■ 7®^ $6u need 'not be lightened, Miss i iMary.X will tak^ good care of you." ' He looked-jat ane, aud my heart \yenji now ihatiilSis inaij loved me;anj ,'what wfts^npte', that I I j. |ool fot hiy pains. Ibegantoery. My hat | [fell pjE^ki^pneofthe poppi^slfeU out. Mr. /Felix handed ine my hat, and our hands touched. "I'll never be allowed to come out in ypurin&t; a^iti, Mr. J^elix,' ftkiiow* I will not. What a pity it's solatel'i Felix took up the poppy. " May I keep this, Miss Mary ?" " Yes. if you like, Mr. Felix,'' I answered. " Thank you, little Miss Eary," and he took my hand. Idid not withdraw it, but 1 said, " Please don't, Mr. Felix." But h(B~di<3\. 1 "Did you ever hear the story of King Cophetua and the beggar uiaid ? Do you,like that story? Can you imagine anyono could love, so inferior to thcmsvlves in rank ? Do you think love lewis all ranks ? "Yes," I said crying. "I do, Mr. Felix. But why do you ask me ?" I was thinking, little . Miss Mary— you won't be angry with me if I say—" " No," I said. "Little Miss Mary, could you—" I, began to cry. ' | "Ma-ry, Ma-ry," called an agonised voice from the pier, and I saw a figure ; standing there. As we touched the landing steps Sybil advanced with a tragic air. " Mary," said she, "a fine nail you've put in joui mother's coffin this day." I ran up the steps, Emma aud Mr. Felix following. " Coire homo, Mary, at once; its positively disgraceful « f yon staying out tili this hour," said Sybil, indig nantly. I don't blame the boatman a bit. Come, Emma," and sbe walked off. ! I stood where I was. ■ " G-.)od night, Mr. Felix." " Good night, little Miss Mary." I putoutu.y hand. lie took both my hands in his one, and he looked straight in 10 my ejes; it seemed to thrill me. " Good night, good night," And I ran off afinr Svbil. I had a very bad quarter of-an hour ind got a fine all-round scolding. First* iiother began and then Sybil .took up« i,be running. ' "What would Thomas say?" said Sybil. ' ; I retired to my room. Sybils/and ■nother talked and talked till late next' norning. Sybil bade me pack up,-fo£ we were going home that day-; arid as [ wouldn't require any more boating/ I was to leave a sovereign with' Mrs. A.ntbiue for the boatman. " It was^a little too much, of course.but_p£op]&. >f that sort expect it." She really lid iiot know what Thomas lyould say; \- " Thomas can go to Hong Kong," [ answered. / I packed my clothes recklessly bade good bye to the AnMnes, and we were soon on board the ateainer. ^ " Oli, I've forgotten my spectacles," ; wailed" poor mother. "-Ran, Mary,; run back and get them." ' j I went back and found Mrs. Anfcoine in tears,... -.7 '• ' J'w' ' j ; r< What is the ^atcer,'' -said why are youcryingi*'" . . J t ^JChat'j the.tForrj|ji of lettin'rooms'! ^thyr^^Qmes and they J goes, and ye loike, so '-'ye'' 'VAre you so sorry after us, then?" " I am that," said Mrs. Antoine. " Oh, Miss Mary, that chap Felix came to see your mother. He turned as white as a ghost when 1 told him yez had gone. And whin i gave hiin the soverign, he said—' Give it to the children and 1" Shriek went the steamers warning whistle, and I bad to rusb my hardest to be in time. The last thing I saw as we stea'ned away was someone at the end of the pier, who wore a fez cap.; I stood upon a seat and waved my handkerchief to him furiously. I did, I did and just gloried in it, too. After Sybil's marriage we went to live in the backblocks. It was very lonely for a while. Then 1 cauie out in society. Brother Jim took mother and me to the University commemoration. The students began to sing " Out on the Deep," and my thoughts went back to Felix. Mary, Mary, look dear," said mother, as she plucked my sleeve. " Look at that student there; I seem to know bis face." My heart seemed to hound, for it was Felix. He came near ; I put my fan to my face, and he passed without seeing me. Jim came up. " Say, Mary, did you see that fellow that passed just now ?" -1 npddedi, " Well he's the coming man. He's got whips of money and the brains of a dozen men. Mary, you look white— not going to faint, eh ! are yoii ?" /' Who, are" you talking about ?" asked my liio'tber. " Telling Miary about John Felix . Latiyon, a'fcharacter. He goes off by st&frjng; every year to some Jotf|;pf-ttie%ay hole—Portarlington. I kbink. ' Gr^ts»hiiuself up like a fislier "^an, aiicliiiveS aboard an old yacht for ! .Quietness, and burns the midnight oil. JE£ere be comes. I'll introduce him. "I say, Mary, you're blushing like a rose. Lanyon, let me introducs you to my mother. What! you've all met before,, . You might have told a fel low." We shook hands like old acquain tances. He kept my hand just a little longer than was absolutely necessary. I felt as if the world had got brighter | to me. " Come away, Lanyon," said Jim. "the fellows are tearing Ihe pi nee down for you," and off they went. " Pear, dear," said mother, " lo think that we should never have guessed that be was a gentleman. Mr. Felix came often to see us .after that. . J& SHE END.
