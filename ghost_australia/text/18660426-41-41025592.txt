NEGLECT OF PROPEKTY AT PORT ADE LAIDE. TO THE LDITOII. Sir— Shipowners are much annoyed 'by; claims made upon their ships for c-utfo being short de livered, and for a loss in weight and deficiency ia contents of Dackaires. Thcv are unable to trace cue causes 01 sucn claims anu losses, and have accordingly to pay. I was witness to a Blight scene at Port Adelaide this afternoon which may to some extent explain the matter. I saw a railway truck which had brought potatoes standing near the wharf; the bags were on the wharf and were in bad order, bo that their contents were loose on the ground. There were five or six labuurers-oue in the truck— amusing themselves by pelting each other with' tha potatoes, and a man at some distance off was collecting those which came in his way, and put ting them into a smail bag. No doubt, with the honesty which is the characteristic of people who handle other persona* property freely, he intended to put them on board the ihip whjen was destined to carry them away. But those who were throw ing them about clearly could have had no such intention, and if the small bag does not make iti appearance to fill up the orthodox weight we can only thank a paternal Government which does not in broad day give even the ghost of a blue uniform to protect the property of those who have te pay in some shape for such protection, and are obliged to 8ufier in pocket because such a thing as robbery is supposed not to exist-all the penal Statutes to the contrary notwithstanding. 1 am, Sir, &c;, J.
