Calm and smiling mechancally, while awato ng the aCcuratoly-timed clockwork in thn breach to discharge the piece, Tigrerasurveyed the multitude around her and beneath her in verted eyes. The stillness was oppressive to all but the heroine of the occasion. Suddenly, in the grand mirror behind the bar of the first tier, tuclining like the plate glass of a Pepper. Ghost Illusion, and, hence, reflecting what took place at a lower level, the gymnast espied the stalwart Mavis on the fge, into whose babboan face, pite of its buenlarged mouth, eyes sidewise prolonged w black, ang tthree-branched wig, a yormg, thin and infatuate ballet girl (ready to come on in the next item of the programme, but witheno business there) was gazng enthragwed.r "The traitor," she gasped. Her teeth, therefore, panted, and, just as the cannon belched forth fire and thunder, with the wish that the wad wodld remove Monas' Son forever, and maken the danseuse afreritable corps de ballyn(as they say)--down the gun fell ! A long outcry of horror resounded. Every body rose a-tiptoe to behold the gory smash. On the edge of the balconieswthey were jammed ten deep. sai. Luckily, as is pretty usual, the people directly below the net, marking the line ofgthe trapeze flight, had retired uto the sides froT prudence and to haveda better view. lSo the ordnance simply cut through the meshes like a bee through a web, andi rashedeinto the floor. Out of the gap arose a second seriesw of scream and many oaths, and Tigrera saw from her perch, tanig b cr, hiig or-ondr in this hole lit up by gas, a black figure appar ently smashed flat as a silhouette in paper. Alas !! the cannon released might have killed. a dozen Mavises, and, eke, Boaston's, or even one or two diamond dealers. But the victim was a veritable phoenix, the ultra-wealthy and unco' pious Mr. Cowley, whose London land investments alone outbalance the Queen's at Coutt's. The proprietor had expended a fund of scheming to get that immaculate magnate to enter secretly that abode of glitter and-gaiety. And now that hanged woman had squelched the capitalist, all but ensnared; with her hanged cannon! Nevertheless, the incident did not get out with destructive details in the press. In fact, Boaston had been induced by the diamond mer chant to "put it to Miss Bold straight." If she, in person appealing, could not witch the unfortunate Mr. Cowley to forgive them his smashed toe, the Tyburnia Fantasias was doomed. Tigrera put on black, her seal mantle of in calculable price, carried her lace handkerchief (an imperial Austrian present) to her eyes, wore very little but solid jewelry, and bribed her way into Mr. Cowley's presence. She came to be seen and conquer. They were married by special license, and were soon on a continental tour. As for Tom Mavis, he inspired no feel ing but scorn and hatred. And as for Uncle Zach, he is looking around for another model of female perfection, to train up in the way it should go.
