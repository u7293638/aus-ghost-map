HAMLET RE-CREATED. And the man that did it was Beerbolnn Tree, the most impersonal and versatile of all our actors. Hamlet, the unspeakable Dane, lias of late years been done to death by ambitious artists who successively have replied to the " To be" with "not to be." The sight of "Wilson Barrett disporting his cumbrous length on tlie stens of the throne, and soliloonisinir before a Princess's audience was not one to forget easily. Poor bested Dane, he has indeed suffered the " slings and arrows of outrageous" â€” actors. But Mr. Beerbohm Tree has bid tho dead bones live, and the manes of Shakespeare are appeased. There was a splendid first night audience in the Hayinarket on the Thursday the play opened. Mr. Tree grasps the subtlety of the rSIe adinirablj-. Hamlet's underlying love for Ophelia is beautifully accentuated by tone and glance. The house was moved en masse at the end of the second act, when bending over his tablets by the red fire, Hamlet cries, " The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." In the fifth act the churchyard is a spring parterre of blooms, a new rendering, and thithen Hamlet returns to Ophelia's grave. The fencing scene with Laertes is a magnificent piece of intellectual grasp, shown in the actor's expression and acting when he looks Laertes in the eye and reads his treachery. Then again, Mr. Tree's subtlety shows its power. Mrs. Tree makes a charming Ophelia, delicately as well as strongly given. Mr- Arthur Dacre, as Horatio, also secured a triumph, and Mr. Fernandez, as Ghost, and Mr. Fred Teriy as Laertes were generally successful. Shakespeare this season at the: Haymarket will not spell ruin.
