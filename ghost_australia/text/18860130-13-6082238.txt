SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1886. The departure of the Premier and of the Chief Secretary for Hobart, after they have taken an affecting farewell of Victorian politics, evidently places a good many people in a false position. Mr. GILLIES is the principal sufferer, though the situation of Ministers ex- pectant is also to be deplored. The member for Rodney had to say some- thing at Echuca in order to keep him- self en evidence, and yet he cannot say much, because, excepting Mr. DEAKIN, he has no colleague to consult with. " Ghosts " occupy nearly every de- partment of the state at the pre- sent time. The portly Mr. LANGRIDGE is a ghost, so is Mr. LEVIEN, and the reality is doubted of the Minis- terial presence both of Mr. TUCKER and Colonel SARGOOD. These gentlemen must be anxious to shuffle off the scene, just as Mr. GILLIES must be desirous of taking the community into his confidence, and we must hope, for the public wel- fare, that the suspense will be termi- nated as early as possible. At Echuca Mr. GILLIES took refuge in talking principally about the past. Most of us know all about the Mallee Act and the Railway Administration Act already, or, at anyrate, we want to hear some- thing different from Mr. GILLIES, and so, skipping all that in the Echuca address, the public will be apt to come to the future. The most important point in the ad- dress is the reference to the finances of the colony. In the hope of a deficiency, the favourite occupation of the typical radical just now is to devise ta\es which shall produce the minimum amount of revenue and the maximum amount of " scare " and of class lnitation. Now, though one cannot speak with certainty of -what is to happen sit months hence, Mi Gurus argues that a credit balance is much mole pro bable than a deficit He expects to have a surplus to spend rather than a deficiency to be made good Mi PAHIRSON fell into a particular enor in the first instant e, and following Ins lead one cutic after another has tui ned a somersault into the pit 'I heir mistake is that the returns foi the fast half of the year have been taken as giving the absolute receipts for the second half The total irsenuo pxnprtPfl bv the Treasurer is -66,280,000 The first halt of the 3ear has given mulei ¿£1,000,000, and the alarmists seo a deficit looming near at hand Ali GiLLiLS may be a little opli mistic, but financial prospects me bettci at the end of the month than theyneie at the beginning, when the half >early íe.cnuo ictuins made then appearance Tiade is keeping up, and at the late that wheat is pouring down fiom the count.), a diflerence of .S100 000 will soon bo made m the railway returns 'Hie selectois' rents, Mi Gurus a\ers, «ill come 111 after harvest time 'Hie last lev ernie accounts did not ciedit the Government with tho interest to bo received fiom the ban] s on account of loan do posits-the bookkeeping transfei not aim} s being made on the ilst Decem bet, while a postponement to the lot Jinuaiy thiows the amount into tho _i»asuiy account foi the succeeding half yeal In this item, tho second half jeal will be better off by £ >0,000 than its predecessor Manj other such con sideiations have to bo dealt with It is not ti ue, «ays Sir GILLUS, that " Mi "bulwer has inn away to avoid a " deficiencj, ' which lcllection, so very cieditable to its authoio, has been ficelj made the unexpected may happen, bul the j ear, accoidin¿ to the incoming Piemiei should close with a suiplus, and consequentlj, if Mi GuriFS is to bo ti usted, the liameis of piogrammes need no longer pur/le then brains with considerations of national finance Most of the people who aro engaged in the exeid'o would be much better em plojcd 111 amnging foi a suiplus in then own households 1 hey have been as happy hading upon their deficit as SINE ID was on his whale, and now they find the ground go from under them unless they are to aigue, not foi neces =arj but for penal taxes As to the charge that the Coalition C oveminent was ex travagant, the replj made is, that no new taxation has been levied, except, of course, a small increase in the spmt dutv All debts have been cleared oil, and for the rest the money contributed bj existing taxes has been spent, not withextia vaganee, but wisely and well Thestato, it must be remembered, also, is a great trading institution, and an increaso in the revenue and expenditure may mean no new burdens, but only a larger business In three j ears the íailwavs have increased their receipts and ex penditure by -SoU0,000, and so tho public account is swollen all down the line The pa«age about tho Fducation Act will not bo skipped bj any one Jil Gurus is not prepaiecl, nor is his colleague, Mr D_.\\-.i\ to accopt the Canadian system, which in this countrj, he argues would mean denominationalism pure and simple As to anj saving being possible, the educational vote is made upof _S">00 000 for teachers «alanés and £"0,000 for ííianagement, and the teachers, he con tends, are worl ed sulhcientlj hard, and aio not ov el paid Possiblj Mr Gil rus was thus emphatic because of the expectation that Mr HAPPFr will join tho new Government and because in that case it would bo duo to both parties that there should be no misconception as to tho terms of tho alliance It innj be said that Mr HARPI-R would scaicely bo lustihed in standing aloof from tho JMinistiy if tho education question is the only bar to his co opeiation, inasmuch ns tho education question as a whole is not one which the Ministry will have to talo up in its coipoiate capacity A pioposal to set aside laige ie°er\es as an educational endos mont is to be made, but we think.
