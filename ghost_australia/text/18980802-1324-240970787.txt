Ladies and childfen are in consequence afraid to cross the reserve at night time. Stilts arc evidently used, as the figure towers something like 7ft. high. A number of young^ men from tlie fire brigade went out on Friday night looking for the uncanny individual and were prepared to give him a great reception had they come across him.
