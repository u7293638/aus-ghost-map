"The Old Daugerreotypes. > - — ' v ' ' i If p in the attic l found tliem, locked in the . cedar chest, "Where the flowered gowns lie folded -which once; were brave as the best ; ' . " And, like the queer old jaekets. and the ' - waistcoats gay with stripes. They tell of a worn-out fashion— these old ' . daguerreotypes. / ,v Quaint little folding cases, fastened with tiny hook,.
