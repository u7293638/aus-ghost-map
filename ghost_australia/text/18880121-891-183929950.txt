fAK 0P0SSU31 IN A FIRE-BELL. The local fire-bella (fays the Wagga Adver tiser of Thursday) have been called upon to do a fair share of duty lately, hut the central instrument in Htzmaurice street was prt to a decidedly novel use one afternoon, when it be came a* temporary "abiding place" for a festive young opossum, which was observed to be perched on the tongue of the bell, doing a gentle swing. Had it been night, and had the 'possum succeeded in raising a note or two out of the bell, Wagga might have been in a position to work up a little ghost story of its own about (6ay) "the haunted bell," for at the first sound*of the dread note that 'possum would have fled for the nearest gum tree, and then the mystery would have been how the bell came to speak.
