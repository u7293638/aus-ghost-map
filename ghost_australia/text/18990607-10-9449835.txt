THE DERELICT. I am rolled and swung, I am rocked and line, I am hammered and heaved and hurled, , linn tossed and wheeled um brown and 1 reeled, And battered about the world. On the pushing Udo T rule and ride, Or tell er and loaf at ouse ; With never a cure, MIOIIRII foul or fair, I follow the foamy seas. Men come not nigh when they pass me by, For they fear me, every one. As I leave the gray of the dawning day, Or disease In the summer sun. Past unknown isles, for miles and miles, I wander away to where The Iceberg lifts and the salt spray drifts In the freezing Arctic may. I steal by the bars when the flame winged . stars Have swarmed in the upper blue, And the glow and shine of the drenching brine Like white fire burns me through. I haunt us a ghost the rock-girt coast Where the bell buoy loudly rings, And the breakers lead to the mighty sweep . Of the night wind's sable wings. I shake and moan, I creak and groan, in the wrathful tempest when The old sea raves and digs deep graves For the jolly sailor men. What matters time or, what the crime To a vagrant of the sea? To live or die, oh, naught care I ! There is no port For me. IIKRIIURT BAsnronn in "Songs from Puget Sea."
