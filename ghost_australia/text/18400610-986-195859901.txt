THE STORM DEMON. ──── Load roars the blast—o’er the foam-crested ocean The mad waves are dancing in harried commotion : The waterspout bursts — its dark column uprearing Like a spirit of death—o’er the billows careering ! The heavens are all flame—the black clouds rent asunder— The Storm Demon comes in his chariot of thunder. Spirits—dark spirits—his summons obeying, Now crowding around him—their homage are Paying : Hark ! hark ! now they laugh, as the tempest is telling His triumphs aloft to the wild music swelling ! “ Up spirits — away !—o’er the flame-crested ocean”— The Storm Demon cries ;—“ Wake your wildest commotion ! ” Now shrouded in weeds—from their watery pillows— Ghosts of drowned mariners float o’er the billows ; The phantom-ship bounds, the wild tempest defying, Crowding sail and away—o’er the wild waters flying ! The pale ghastly crew—how their eyes roll with wonder ; And loud is their shriek as they plunge ’mid the thunder !
