The Bin of Omission. It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leaeo undone, Which givee you a bit of a heartache, At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The lotteryou did not write, Tho flower you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of hartsome council You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone, That you had no time nor thought for, With troublce enough of your own. Theso little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, These chances to be angels Which even mortals find They come in night and silence, Each chinll, reproachful wraith, When hope I faint and flagging, And ao bUght has droope on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too greet, To suffer our slow compassLon That tarries until too late, And lt'enotthe thingyou do, dar, It's the thing yeu eIet undone, Which gives you the hitter heartache At the setting of the sun. -M .eosnrr e.
