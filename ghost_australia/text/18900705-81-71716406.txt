' But now tho door of the bath-room opened suddenly, and a slender, white robed figure stole swiftly into'the ball; as; If pursued, and glided like a beam of light along the ball to the rear intersecting corridor. It waa Bernice.' Monk flew after her in bis list slippers as silently aa she. She ran fleetly down the long hall and turned aside into the corridor, Monk behind her. They had scarcely passed beyond the great hall when Bord Chetwynd opened the door of the bath-room, and came out in: wild pursuit. But Bernice and Monk were both beyond thc range of his vision. ?. The seeming spectro was flying along the dim corridor toward an unused portion*of the extensive mansion, not stopping or looking back. She gained another ball, from whioh a flight ol stairs ascended, and went up . tho stairs with still rapidity. . Monk .came swiftly a littlo way behind.her. .She muBt' have been coneclous of tho pursuit; but.still: abo did not east a backward look over her shoulder. Up one flight, then another, and Bernice bad gained a region of unused attics in the more ancient portion of the dwelling. She ran across a dim passage into a little, bare and empty room, ht up by thc moon light that streamed in at the dormer win dows. She had run into a trap, and seemed to realise the fact, for BUB ran about the room wildly, and then1 retreated to a farther corner, uttering a low, strange cry, and covering her face with hor \- hands. Monk entered tho roora, and closed 'the . door. "." .'?.'?'."'' vv^'.v.' ->';?' '?: Bernice, in her moonlit corner, panted \- and trembled. Monk pushed tho bolt- borne in its socket, and approached her. . v "Bernice J" ho said, softly. Tho girl started, with a ringing cry, and looked up at bim ' with : distended eyes. " Gilbertl" she ejaculated. " I-I thought it was Boy." " Ko, it is I. I heard from Mrs. Growl that you had strangely disappeared. from Mawr Castle, and I knew you would come here. 1 arrived myself only to- night." ' "With Roy? Oh, how ho is. changed, Gilbertl My poor darling I -How grave and stern he has grown I And how his soul leaped out at me from his eyes! He is looking fer me now. Hark I Is ho coming this way?" . . ."? "No, Bernice, Thcs9 -rooms have hot been used in years. Ho will not find you." " I must go to him," cried the girl, in her sweet, impetuous voice, v j " Now- now-. this minute! I knew you were at tho Park, and I went to your old room, Gilbert, but you were not there. Rolenso me from my oath. I must go to my husband." " ? ' " Bernice, listen to me. I have something to say to you first-" "Not a word. Why, bo's looking for me now. He thinks me a ghost. Bclcaso rae from my oath. I t/tust go to bim. Is ho calling? Let mo go, Gilbert. In God's name, let me go to my husband 1", . "Not yet, Bernice-not until you listen to what I have to say," said' Monk, firmly. " Chetwynd thinks you a spectre, as you Bay. Ho will go back to biB room presently. There's time enough ; but you must listen to inq." . 1 ' "Then speak: quickly. How can I wait? He thinks me doad-ho wants mo-" "How do you know that ho wants you?" nBked Monk, in crisp, hard tones. '.>? Bernice scarcely seemed to understand, Monk repeated tho question. " How do I know ? Why, because I want him. Oh, Hove him BO ! I must go to him. Release mo from my oath, Gilbert-" . . " Hoar mo first.' Bernice, I have thought you tho bravest, tho noblest, the most gener ous of women, but you are. selfish li ko thc rest. You are not capable of self-sacri fice." " What self-sacrifice ?" asked the girl, in a sharp whisper. .. ;,,k". "Aro you capable of a sublime self-abne gation?" demanded nCcviK, his black eyes all aflame.

In that interview all was made straight be tween them. Chetwynd thought it best to spend the year of his mourning abroad, and he went. He would not expose his future wife to malicious comment. He returned to day. This very evening Chetwynd and Sylvia renewed their former engagement. Yonr day is past-it is another's now 1 Your Çlace is filled. You aro not wanted here, he revelation that you live will only bring dismay and honor. Bernice, from my soul I pity you 1 My heart bleeds for you 1" The girl drooped silently on ber knees in the wido stream of moonlight, and bowed her head low on her breast. " There have been women," said Monk, after a long silence, "so self-abnegating that upon such a return to life they would go away in silence, without revealing the blasting secret of their continued life. Are there each women now ?" There was a long and terrible pause. Monk waited in breathless suspense for her response, but he had long to wait. At last her low and broken voice cut sharply through tho stillness, with tho words : \- " But I am his wife, yon know. We said, ' until death do us part :' and I'm not dead, Gilbert. His second marriage while I live, would be illegal." "Not so. Death annuls all ties. You seemed to die, .And were buried. Yon aro supposed to bc dead-you are dead, in the ! eyes of the law," said the villain, with an j air of reluctant sincerity. . ' If you were to [ reappear, it is possible that your marriage ceremony might have to bo performed again to make you Ohetwynd's wife. I repeat, that in tho eyes of the law you are dead. Ohetwynd's second marriage wonld be legal and valid." Tho girl, brought up in a far island of the sea, knowing notbingabout law, profoundly ignorant upon many points on which an English school-girl is well Informed, having implicit reliance npon and faith in the man j who had rescued ber from the tomb, believed him! . "I will go away," she said, in a voice so strange that Monk hardly recognised it. ''lamacad in the eyes of the law. It will be no crime for them to murry. I heard him call her his 'promised wife;' I saw bira kiss ber. They shall be happy. I love him so well that I will die even for his sake I" "And you will go back to Mawr Castlo?" The girl nodded dumbly. ? " I'll find Flack. He shall hire a carriage, and drive you to some station beyond East bourne. It would not be well for you to be seen even in Eastbourne. Flack will ac company you back to tho castle. You have done a brave, grand, and noble thing in giv ing np/.Boy, Bernice. I admire you for your sublime self-sacrifice. I will make your future my charge. I will be your brother, will watch over you, ond try to make you happy. Walt {jere, Bernice, while I go to find Flack and Bend him for the car riage; I will return and see you safely out and on your way with him." Bernice again nodded assent, and he went .outi leaving ber alone in the boro, cold room, in the pale stream of moonlight. He made his way down to the edge of the park, and readily found Flack, who waB smoking a pipe in the shadow bf the trees. Monk communicated the fact of his SUCCCBS, «nd sent his ally to the little inn At Chct wynd-by-Seo 'for the / required " carriage.
