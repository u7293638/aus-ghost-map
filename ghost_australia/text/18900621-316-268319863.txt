A TEEEIBLE EIDE. I bought my ticket throu&i; to Venice of Blank and Son,^n London. '"You will see our agent jn-enery. station; and lie will save.youall trouble with your luggage, finding your train, and so on,?'said, with a bland smile, the head mail of Blank and Son, as.he.handed me my little book :pf coupons and bowed me out into the chill fog- ' of tho ISovomber day. I went next day to Pans, andspent the day after in the gay shops and: stieets of-that, heedless, haiipy, eare-for- ,getting town. I was to leave for Turin • from the Gare de.Lyonat 7.1o-mthe evening.- When ,the dusk,fell the clouds gathered, and I drove alone through the pouring ram to the station. ,My, frienas.had .brought me floweTS and.fruits, and,they would have- gono to see me off, but I refused., -They-were women—why could not I dp as, well -as they? And then -there was. the agent of .Blank and Son. He was sure to be - there. "What could I want more ? - ,. I reached the statiou. : The rain "beat on my , unsheltered:head as I paia the driver twice hie fee, for tho truly feminine reason that hedemauded'it. ..I wentin. No agent of Blank and -Son. was to bo seen.. I had.my ticket dated,.my truuk registercd, and . then I followed-a porter .- laden with my hand luggage to tlio train. All the lensth of the tram for Turin we: wandered—there-was "but one first-class carriage to be found. .1 had my fii-st-class ticket m nay -hand. ,and . I- went- up - to this one carnage and - would fam have entered it. A stolid-lookmg - old priest sat there -m . sohtary state, and as I was about to cilmb up lie said grimly thatit .was - nd taken; -. I pleaded for one little corner, but m yam.: ,.I said—, But-monsieur, my-ticket is first-class, .and there is uo ,first-class cai-nage,but this;" : - , ,. "-'-It-is all taken, madame," came • Ins -reply,' •inexorable as fate. I turned away m despair- .Clearlylmustieithergo second- class or give up my-jouiney forthat night. I could not do the latter-, ior the friend of.my heart was waiting for me in Yenice, irnd her plans depended on uune.i At that moment I caught sight, for tlio firsttune,. of a linip.man wearing the livery of .Blank .-aud -Son.'- .He was the most knock-" kneed, weak-looking creature.yoa could imagine —still ,.-• he.. was.. -Messrs. . Blank's agent. Expiring hope was rekindled in my breast. : I cried out to him. I showed lum my little book lvith. my fiist-class ticket-. Slowly, as if ho were' going to execution, he .-went up -to the surly .priest m the single first-clasB carriage, and slowly he came back tome. - . f He says it'sall taken, ma'am." ' Yes, but can't you speak to the chief of the .station?.". . :• "There's no time," and ho pointed to the clock, just on the quarter past seven. He-.was so utterly helpless, so pitiably weak, I turned from him desperately. • Even the second-class camageshad.been filling fast. I saw a "vacancy m only .one.- . I.plungea into it and the porter nanded in my -baggage. -I glanced then at my companions—two beetle-browed, black-looking men, evidently Italians, smoking fiercely. Terror took hold on me. I uttered a last cry of despair, and a, kindly voice speaking JSnglish with a French accent, said: . " Madame, can I be of any. service ?" • and .at the moment the speaker sprang into the carriage. took his seat m. the comer opposite me, the door, .was shut .with a bang, and the tram moved away. . I told my tale, and the young Frenchman— who was after all more English than French, smce he had lived m England almost from Ins boyhood—-tried to comfort me. At that momentlrealised that. I had - drawn off my gloves, tlie more- readily, to get out my tickets, and .the small change for my-porter, and that on one hand a ruby ring was catching the lamplight, and on-the other,a duller glitter betrayed a large sappTnre. I had worn the rings for safe-keeping, but my maid misgave me as I sawliow earnestly the smoking. Italians were- regarding, them... I settled "bade m my corner and drew on my gloves, but now some evil attraction compelled me to look steadfastly at-'my . companions and try . to - take . their measure. - ' • . . . It was a task beyond me. I had never seen such men. The head and face of the younger were"" exactly the image , of. the murderer in- Mdme. Tussaud's .Chamber of Horrors. Happily for the world that murderer .had been hanged ; but could -it be that his . uneasy ghost was reincarnated in this man, and had come to . torment the -world, again ? . -I had .just read • Esoteric:Buddhism," and this idea seemed.- most reasonable.- -There was. a sort of evil fas cmation for. me 111 -the study of these two: ruffians.-: It seem.ed to me-they looked -behind, 'then-tobacco smoke like, demons seen through - <theisulphurous clouds.of the Inferno. Suddenly • < ;my:- French-Enghshmau • leaned: forwai'd and:, bpoke.to,aie.- - - : ,:-'.'-•- i!!s.":Madi£me, I have fcar of those Italians.' • I; ;5Wcestlieir.looks- yery.ill." = - r -, - '."
