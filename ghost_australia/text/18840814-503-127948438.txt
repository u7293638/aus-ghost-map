Australian Belief. All the tribes believe that the earth is flat, and that the -sky is propped up on poles. Beyond the sky is the gum-treo country, tho' home of spirits and ghosts. Every man lias within him a Yambo, or spirit, which can leave his body and wander even to the gum tree country and talk with the spirits there, or converse with the wandering ghosts of other sleepers. The state of departed souls and their doings after leaving tho human body fill a great part of Australian mythology. The dead aro buried doubled up, the body lying on the side, and the usual deposit ia made of tho personal effects of tho deoeased. Mr. Howitt, in the Journal of the Anthropo logical Institute.
