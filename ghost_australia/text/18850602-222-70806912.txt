Yet, there were persons that day who were voluntarily rejecting the sanctifying grace offered' them, A person might have grown gray in the service of theLord, and yet if he com mitted one sin all his works are for gotton-if a just man turned from his' justice all his ustices would be for gotten, He did not wish to be under stood tosay that'the good works of the past would heouseless; fortheyprocured compassion for the sinner's weakness, as in the case of St..

A mis take was capable by diligence in prayer of being repaired, and that day they had an opportunity of preparing them. solves for God. In conclusion, his lordehip exhorted parents to see to their children, and'educatothemn well in the doctrines of their holy religion. At the termination of the sermon the children were ,presented for con firmation.

In examining the children he was pleased to find them very well prepared. They had a good school in Benalla,' which was conducted ad. mirably, and parents should attach great importance to the instillation of the Christian doctrines into their children. The confirmation was then proceeded with, Father COrolan as. sisting, and Mr O'Connell and Miss Hanlon acting as eponsors, after which his " lordship congratulated the children, and counselled them to pray assiduously, mornitng and eveningand be better boys and girls, a S'Mr D.
