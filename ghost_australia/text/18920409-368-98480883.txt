THE EIGHT-HOUR DAY. WIrAT think ye, Tam, gin you an' I To solve. the Labour question try; Oor wit and wisdom baith apply, An' put oar holeids thegither, man! Wi' common-aosnse ye aye agree, Sae kindly cook yer lug a weeoo, Nor dooeem a rustic bard like me A Socialistic blethor, man. Inmay be dubbed a pessimist, A stumping Rad, an' a' the rest; But I've a etammoek can digest Sic compliments wi' ony man. I'm like the cynic wi' his lamp, When through the market.place I tramp I sye detest a poliehed scamp, And prize an honest cronie, man. It grieves me whiles to hoar folk say, "We can't afford an eight- hour day; " They rant an' rave-faith! weol they may, F?or obhanges queer are oomin', man. The crafty rogues may slyly wink, But, Tam, we're smairter than they think; S Their quackery in oar noses stink, We canna thole their bummin', man. 'Twad nearly gar a body bock, To hear prophetic puddoaes croark "We moan compete wi' ither folk," The noodles aye keep ravin', man. 'Tia theirs to guard the nation's weal Expose oor sins, their ain conceal, Bribe orators to soap us weool, While landlords due the shavin', man. Economy's the latest shift, No'or droamin' that we see their drift, The poor are tell't to practise thrift, By legielatin' donkseys, man. Gi'oilka prood presumptuous brat His wine, hie'sport, his baccarat, Oar bairns may starve, but what o' that! We maunna stave oer monkeye, man. We're daily drubbed by tyrants base, Wha hound the poor frac place to place, Yet front theb warl' wi' brazaen face, An',justie still deny as, man. 'Tis they who fill the ewoatin' dens, Lea'. destitute oer rural glene, They codunt their thousands by the tone, An' poseo as saints fu' pious, man. This foreign comnetition ory May suit the drone, but we reply Why eirastilat te l ounnin' lie, S An' rob your luckless neighbour, man ! Why tax the nation to excess! Why abock an' mar her giold progress! Breed sin, corruption, an' distress, An' clog the wheels o' labour, man. 'Tis sad in an enlightened ago Tao saee oppression a' the rago? Poor larsies fora trifiia' wage In field an' factory worekin', man. We even nee ocar bits oa' weans Compelled to rask their tender bases, An' through oor alloys, streets, an' lanes The ghost o' Famine lurhkin', man. Ero men o' competition rave Let them roleaosea the British slave O' miain' royalties, and save .a : The nation frao sio plunder, man. The workin' class, why overtax W, hy heap els burdens on their backe! Though lawyers, lazy dronese, an' quakse May blubber till they're bloerloe, man.' We sing, "Britannia Rules the Wavos;" We're frameanu- lod we'll ne'or be slaves Oar stirrin', patriotic sletaves We lilt wi' tuneful measure, man. An'.yet when I reflect a while, There's no' a single foot o' soil * Whereon a freeman's free to tail, Basve at the landlord's pleasure, man. " We can't afford an eight-hour day," 'Tie crafty rogues who tell us ao e; They grind the poor trelentlessly, , Spread niisery on' starvation, man. They fain would gull the workin' alass, The life and soul oat folk harass, When ueful measures they could pass To benefit the nation, man. WAnDEsa?N WaIL9 E. Glasgow Ptersld, 19th Dee., 1891.
