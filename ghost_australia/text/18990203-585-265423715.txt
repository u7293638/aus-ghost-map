The p» >ple of the village regarded a wreck as their own eppecial prrp^rty, and they had no qualms of conscience regarding the appropriation of anything that came within their reach from such a source. Ja«per and his sons were enpnged examining a mass of floating wreckage when they were somewhat startled by the sound of a human roice to seaward. It was bat a faint cry, bat to the practised ears of the men it told its tale. It mast be a survivor's cry to come from •ach a direction the men instinctively knew, and loosing the wreckage they had hooked the.boat was instantly turned towards the spot the sound came from. In a few moments a second feeble cry was heari, fainter than the first, bat in the thick darkness nothing could be discerneJ save the white crested wares thai broke against the rocks. They bad almost leached the mouth of the Cove, and Jasper, who bad ignited an lamp and was holding it above his head another pile of wreckage sweep by.

Impelled with the desire to cave life the men palled perilously near to the boiling cauldron of the entrance, and as they did so • sheet of the broken timber swept by the frail craft and a gleam of something white •n it caught the old man's eye. Stretching oat his band be caught the cbject, which seemed to be a bundle of clothes, and as it was of little weight he lifted it into the boat. Examining it with the aid of the light ^ey were astounded to And that it contained a child, and in a few moments Jasqer was convinced that it lived. The boat bad by this tine been drifting back into the Cove and knowing how necessary it was to provide warmth for the almost inanimate infant the men at once palled bank to the beach and landed amongst the wondering few who remained there. Mrs. Trenoweth was the first woman that Michael Jasper saw, and when ebe took the waif eo miraculously preserved her motherly tenderness was aroused and sbe claimed the care of the child. This wai at onoe conceded, for there were so women-folk in the Jasper household, and the care of as infant would have been awkward, By.aint of care the child was brongbt found, .and at daylight seemed little the worse for the awful experience of the night. Qnt of all on board the ship the child was the- only soul sired, and the woodeitag people of fit.- Oolamb regarded her—for it wa*' a female—u specially under Divine ore.

THE WUEAL HEBLIK. One of the most ancient mines In venerable Cornwall was the Wheal Merlin. Its underground workings extended for miles and formed a perfect labyrinth likely to prove fatal to the uninitiated explorer. Having been worked tor hundreds of years nearly every spot was hallowed or cursed by tbo memory of a fatal dissster. The awe-struck miner woald show the visitor places wliere human self-sacrifice had reached sublime heights, or majhap where personal malice in vengeful mood had invukt.l aid of death to remove a hated rival orli<Kain ® !"ttle wealth. Every sublerrautMi gallery was filled with unwritten uud unpainted legends, but to the superstitious minors and residents of the district they were infinitely more real and enduring than if wrought in marble or bronze. Considering th?! primitive manner in which the mine had for ages been worked it was a msrvel that the accidents had not been more numerous and more serious. Even with simple appliances In upe a great depth had been attained, and the work <>f ages bad caused the district around St. Co:uuib's Cove to be honeycombed with underground drives. lr. olden times the mine was noted for its rich yields and miniatnre battles had been fought for its possession. An ancient representative of the Trenoweth family, who bad been worsted above ground at the outpost from which be defeuded his property, took refuge below, and for several days fought the enemy in its drives. His better knowledge of these ramifications enabled him to triamph, but the viotory was a hard one. A vil'ager named Penlold, who worked in the mine, was eituer bribed or forced into hawing the enemy underground, and this msn paid dear for his treachery. Having been captured, the enraged lineis took him to the surface and then ropped bim seven hundred feet to the bottom «>f the main shaft. s one of the ghosts that was sAid to walk by the credulous people, and whtnthe phautom appeared it was looked upon as an omen of fast approaching evil to the people of the bamlef. Sijoh superstition as this may appear childish to the matter-of-fact people of to- Australia. It should not be forgotten, however, that even at this latter end of the nineteenth century there still lingers v parts ol Cornwall superstitious be* litis t-iat cease.I to obtain followers in other pattB about the middle agee. Mining is essentially a precarious and dangerous calling, and in Buch a remote spot a* St. Ooiomb's Oove—almost cut off from communication with the busy world, and in a locality where nature herself con. spired to overawe man—there was nothing strange in the fact that the miners employed the Wheal Merlin should etill cherish the legends of their forefather*. Indeed, they had some ground for the strange beliefs tbey held, Od more than one occasion weird predictions had been verified in a strange asd remarkable way. Omens that could only have been of toper, natural origin bad, through the key of certain prior prophecies been interpreted, and they had been fulfilled. More than one hundred years before the date on which this atory opens an ancestor of Edward Trenoweth bad met the phantom of Penfold in one ol tbe drives of the Wheal Merlin. The spectre—eo Trenoweth saiil—pointed menacingly in * northerly direction, and then, like the usual orthodox ghost, vanished. This Trenoweth was a man more than ordinarily sceptical for a Cornishman, and he refused ts listen to the appeals made to bim by certain of tbe villagers when he told them ol tbe apparition. They urged that be should not work in tbe mine for * week and a day or harm would befall bim. The period of a week and a day was universally considered ms Ike longest in which a spirit conld exercise a malign influence. Even Mrs. Trenoweth urged her husband to take heed of the warning given, but be was obdurate. He pointed onl, like a ehrewd, sensible man that be was, that be could not *ee how working the mine w-juld precipitate his fate Any sooner than remaining above ground for a few days and perhaps having an encounter with aome straggling smugglers *>r pirates who-might drop, i nto the Core. If hit hour bad come his bolt would fall w equally aura above gronsd as * few hundred feel below tbe surface. This is the view that the-practical man.ot to- day meld Sake ia inch matter*, bat the. equel showed that Tranoweth ^should have taken the kindly advice. Men morning be descended the shift In jmpany with nine men who weft ernbued ith the conrage of thtli matter, bttt -none of. them ever came <to the surface again alive.- • Shortly .afternoon an outbunt of airlroi the jnain chift told the,*l|roned villagers that aome calastropbe bad bappened, and tbey Socked to. tbe mouth of the mine, Some-of tbe- eiperienosd mlntrs when they beard the nab ol plr knew but too well the nature of toe fatality.

When, therefore, Trenoweth put th« wcpI cro shaft down » hundred foot and mmle « purvey, lie calculated that he could drive * lotig distance uuder tbe Gove without fear of a buret. TIub he set to work to do with encrp; eat! his enterprise was soon rewarded. He bared a cnneUUTabk' portion of 1)1 lode an>i the returns it pare wore riclu than the oldest miner in the Wheal Merlin could remember. In fact, it almost seemed bb if fortune wero shout to &mile; once upain upon the Trenoweth family, and Edward felt proud to think that ere long be would be in a posiiicu tooff^r I net & borne worthy of the girl bo idolized. It should be SAid that theie two younL' people, growing up together, had come t' lore each other, And the rilUgert regarded it as & matter of coursc that %urac day thuy wuuld marry. The choice for either Edward or Inei in such a place as St. Coiuub'6 Oove, ww, it is almost needless to say, extremely limited, and to aome extent this fact may account for the mutus 1 affection which bad grown up between them. Aa the lode turned out 00 well Edward put as many men to work as could do eo conrementiy, and tbe drives were soon considerably extended. As the upper workings approached the sea they were abandoned and all tbe o^era tioo& were cottfined to tbe lowett level. tionth after month successful work -was expended on tbie drive, and it eo well re warded tbe owner that tbe almost extinct hamlet of St. Columb began (0 prosper. A mild sort of boom had set in,-and ii only needed a few colonial •• syndicates and speculators to have established a fleeiingcityin the venerable place. In ISrt'J tbe prosperity of the mine was nt its heichi, and the Trenoweth family wenconsidered to be on the high road to wealth. In November of that year E-lward roiHv a survey of tbe lower n-estern drive, sn'i fie calculated that it extended fully one bun* dred yards under the Cove. His intention was to oontinue tbe wurk» inga to tnc outex edge ol the Oove-and tben discontinue. Prudence dictated to him that once the open ocean was reached it would notjbe safe to drive, although tbe level might 4>e far below the sea bottom. He knew tbe Cove sufficiently to uwfef-' 6tand that tbe oeaseless beating of the. Atlantic rollers on the iron-bound coast could not fail, after aees of effort, to honeycomb the cliffs. lu places where soft strata existed fi«snrrp would thus be worn to a great depth, and v drive in such a place woi'Id be to invite disaster. lustde the Cove tbe case was, of course, different. , Sheltered from the fary and force V)f I be eroding waves tbe weight of the water rUov* the drive was the main point to be considered. At least that was the view which Gdwarl. Trenoweth took, and ft was one winch would be shared by most experts. M Christmas time approached Trenoweth decided to celebrate the merry festival in o way worthy of bis name. . He bad reason to bless the fort dying ye*r» for wealth and happiness had placed :their. benediction on bim since the prvioc*. Christmas, Intc Jaeper promised to to'hii wife,'and. the WheAl Merlin bad given op some of it? buried treasore toblm. He was bappy and he desired that tbe good villagers should share' hie joy in some measure. On the 20th of December VorriB Jonc. the underground boss—«s the position i^ colonially termed—met Bdward near the main shaft, and spoke to him— " There is agood deal of water coming ap from tbe bottom of the west drive, sir, near' the enfl." From tbe bottom?" .Edward queried in surprise* " Yes, sir/* I wiii go down .and -have « Jook Yoq mnst haveatroek a spring,sorely I" It is a spring of salt water, then, sir," Jones replied.
