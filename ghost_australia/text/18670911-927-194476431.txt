Nor does tbe conciliatory tone ^EiU'd by His Excellency in his recent com ^Eication to the Upper Houso appear to have ^Ko without a good effect upon the metobtrs of ^Kt branch of the Legislature, as, had a ines ^Hcof tbe Darling stamp been received by ^Brn, at so important and critical a conjunction, ^He very probable that the Supply Bill would ^?have been passed. ^?imougft those quietly disposed people here, ^Bo would much rather not see the peace of tbe ^^frld UrOKen uy liuu iuud tuaruja ui hui, a ^|d deal of satisfaction has been felt to day, ^Kt the extraordinary paragraph comprised in ^m news received last week via Pan ^K as to tbe printed circular of tbe ^Esian Em|-eror inviting the governments Hithe United States and of Fance to con ^?npon the subject of Ireland— that this most ^?Msterous piece of intelligence, at which, if ^K, one might have expected to hear that all ^Kotic Britons would nave roused asoneman, ^?rather as the English lion — is nothing more ^Blcis than a weak invention of some Yankee ^Brafacturer of sensational telegrams.

So much the better, both ^?the British lion and RuBBian bear. ^Hhere has not been much stirring here in the ??of general news during the last week, and ^K barrenness of local items of intelligence K/, perhaps, account for the fact that the Hfbourne correspondent of the Ballarat Star H,ted the readers of that journal to a'ghost Hy the other day, communicated to him, he Hi by an 'apparently sane' individual, Hut a house, where, in the dead of night are Hrd heavy bodies bunting about, footsteps Hig pit-a-pat on the stairs, and bells ringing Hnswer to the tugs of invisible agents. The Hy concludes by stating that the bell- handle Hununicating with the said bell has been seen Hjove backwards and forwards when there H Dot a ' soul' near it So we have a most Hderful. ghost indeed, and one quite worthy ^B place in the next edition of Mrs. Crow s flight Side of Nature,' as a lunu naturae, ^?i in tlie spirit-world, seeing that this Hiing' has, according to its historian, neither ^Hy nor 'soul 1' So far as I have heard from H other quarter, the story itself is like the Hst, there seems to be nothing in it — body, Ht, and spirit are all wanting. .
