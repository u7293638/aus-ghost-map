DRAMATIC AND MUSICAL NOTES. ? We have heard by cable of the success of Gilbert and Collier's opera " The Mountebanks " but in London up till its production at the Lyne Theatre a good deal of secrecy was observed, and public curiosity was excited It appears that even the name was not known with any certainty One writer says -"The title of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera is always kept with almost religious secrecy, and the same clever mysticism is being employed, not, of course, as some think, to increase the popular expectation, with regard to the Gilbert and Collier opera which is to be produced at the Lyne Theatre as near to Boxing Night as possible The Mountebank and Topsy Jury oydom have been given as probable titles, and a third is now added in the form of The Musical Clock Probably All Gilbert is as undecided as to the ultimate nomenclature as the rest of the public, for, such), only a secret that is unknown could be kept so close One thing quite certain is that an automaton will figure largely in the plot, and by putting this into work some delightful consequences arise in the approved and entertaining Gilbortian fashion " At the last minute, says another authority, an important part was written in " The circumstance is so unusual as to deserve special mention, for Mr I Gilbert is little addicted to making alterations at the last moment in the general scheme of a piece On this occasion he has liovertholossgracofulfy acceded to the request of Mr Ledger, who is naturally anxious to utilise the full strength of his staff A prominent rule has accordingly been provided for the white donkey which throughout the entire run of " La Cigale," both in Paris and London, sustained his own character with such natural ease and elegance Mr George Dance will, in all probability, write the book for Sir Arthur Sullivan's next light opera SignorToli will leave England in March for an Australian tour of 10 concerts, lasting till August at last Miss Nellie Stewart is definitely announced to appear in London sales will appear in the title rule in Messrs G H Sims and Henry Pettitt a burlesque " Black eyed Susan," which is to be produced at the Prince of Wales Theatre on the 23rd instant In Melbourne " The Merry Monarch," the operatic extravaganza at the Princess Theatre, grows in public favour, Mr Elton making a great hit as KingAnso IV At the Alexandra the pantomime "Jack the Giant-killer " continues and " Much Ado About Nothing," with brilliant setting, is still being played at the Bijou " Dick Whittington " holds the boards at the Theatre Royal in Brisbane the two pantomimes "Jack and the Beanstalk and Robinson Crusoe " are being played The Darrells open at the Theatre Royal, Adelaide, on the 18th January, in " The N nightmare " Bland not t's company are play - mg " I taken from Life in Hobart Mr H M Stanley opened in Wellington, New Zealand, on the 6th January with his lecture " Through the Dark Continent " In Auckland a series of Know asks concerts has been got out.

Dowlah, the town of Hyderabad has been presented with a theatre, which was opened on the 10th November, with unusual eclat The piece chosen for the auspicious occasion was " Dandy Dick," which was produced under the management of Major Leach, and was well received by a crowded and fashionable audience The theatre is one of the finest that India can boast of, and a special feature of the house is that it possesses boxes for Zenana ladies, who can see and hear everything that is going on without being observed them selves Mr Osmand Toarlo, whilst recently fulfilling an engagement at the Victoria Opera House, Buridoy, received a telegram from Melbourne, accepting his terms for a twelve or eighteen months' eng Egremont in the Antipodes Mr Earle will in all probability says an English journal) make the tour, setting out immediately the present tour finishes London has soon a new pianist, sMile Sramowska, whose appearance at the popular concert on the 28th November so much interested London musical circles She is the only recognised part of M Paderewski, and is described as a young Polish lady of striking personal appearance, quite young, who was originally educated by her parents for the medical profession She has been for three years under her distinguished teacher, and Mr Padorowski recognises no other pupil Her style it is said very nearly approaches that of Mr Padorowski himself, although it is more restrained Her playing of Chopin's Ballade in G minor, op 23, impressed the audience and showed her powers She also gave Schumann's "Papillons" At a second concert she played Chopin's pianoforte sonata in D minor, op. 58, again giving a highly interesting reading of the work On this occasion Mr Ysayo made his last appearance during the season, leading Schubert's posthumous quartet in D minor, and playing Beethoven's romance in F, besides a movement from one of Spohr's concertos for an encore piece, and taking part with Mdlle Malinowski in Beethoven's sonata in C minor, op 19, No 2 It is clearly too late (says " G B S ," in the ICnrul) to hark back to Padorowski, who has had time to make what they call a colossal success in New York since he played here I am reminded of him chiefly by the fact that, after an interval during which nobody ventured to play the pianoforte, Stavonhagon has come and measured himself against his supplanter, challenging comparison in every line of his pro- grammes, which are full of Boo the von, Chopin. Liszt, and so on This was only to be expected, for Slaven - hagon is not deficient in person orange, and he was first favourite among the young lions until Paderewski came He had the advantage of coming from trio school of Liszt, a much nobler, if a loss muscle hardening, one than that of Paderewski's master Leschetizky, some of whose superficialities and vul- gaities cling to his most famous pupil to this day, as you may hear in his reading, for instance, of the " Appassionata " sonata however, when Pado- rew ski'spupiluffo came to an end, andLlsrt died, the more Padorowski forgot his master the latter player he became, whilst the more stave hagon forgot his the worse player he became. When Stav-iihagon came over last year he was positively silly Instead' of his old stable victories over Liszt's sonatas, "Todtentuu_cs." and the like, he was showing off famous little cypresses and neatness of execution with childish exultation, poor Beethoven's earlier concertos serving as hobby horses for the occasion It was amazing to see a young man's musical soul shrunk that much in 50 short a time The following description is given of the famous comic opera, by Peter Cornelius, '"Leo Barber of Bagdad," which was to be produced for the first time in England by the students of the Royal College of Music early in December -The opera, offer an elaborate prelude, opens at day break in the house of Nuroddin, a wealthy inhabitant of Bagdad The master of the house is lying on his couch in, the table being strewn with modicum bottles, while the story ants are singing a soothing lullaby. As he wakes, Nureddin sings a song to Morgiana, his lady love 0 Morgiana is the daughter of Baba Mustaptui, the Cash. Nureddin has been her from afar, watering flowers from her window sill their eyes have met, and he has fallen in love with her Being left alone, and now indulges in a passionate solo, in which he op- presses his affection. He is visited by his elderly lady friend BoBtana, who brings him words of comfort in a duet which ensues he learns for the first time that his passion is reciprocated, and that when the call to prayer sounds from the mare and the Czar visits the Mosque for his devotions. the maiden will receive him in her own home has good news at once effects a cure, and Nureddin, taking leave of Bostaun, calls for the Barber, who is the principal parsonage of the piece The Barber does almost everything except his duty of shaving. He shows his master a horoscope, talks wildly about various arts and sciences, and will not progress with his work until the chorus of retainers is called in to show him the door. Finding that coercion will not succeed, Nureddin, however, takes the Barber into his confidence, and while the busy - body is preparing the lather, again sings a song in praise or Morgiana Still the shaving does not proceed for the Barber takes up the song in whimsical manner, and leaving Nureddin half shaved, he comes forward holding his razor and basin, and entirely absorbed in his comrades. There is a mock solo, in which, half kneeling before the Barber, Nuioddm entreats him to shave him at once, a song in which the Barrier expresses his distrust of womankind, and, lastly, as Nuroddin prepares to leave the house, a solemn warning from the Barber that harm will occur. Nurrodin, however, escapes by c illing in the chorus of retainers, who throw the Barber on the couch, and pile cushions upon him, playing him all sorts of mad pranks while the curtain falls The scene then shifts to the Gadd's house, where Morgiana, after a solo, receiv 03 Bostaua, and afterwards her father, the Cadi Bostaua brings news of the approach of her lover, while the Cadi tells her that he has promised her in marriage to the wealthy Soltoi, who has sent her for a gut a handsome chest piled with Silks, satins, and 109 ellery. The call, however, is heard from the maid, and the Cudi goes out to prime. Nureddin thou enters, and a love duct ensues It is interrupted by the officious Barber, who outside the house sings to his master that there is no cause to fear, and that he is on guard before the window. The love duet again proceeds until is once more interrupted by the rude ci RICH of a slave who, when the pions B iba has returned from prayer, is being bastinadoed by the Cadi's order Hereupon the Barber exclaims that they are murdering his friend, and calls the guard Morgiana lies just time to throw out the silks and jewellery and conceal her lover in the chest, when the hue and cry built into the room, followed by the Barber and the Cadi. A procession of mourning w. omen breaks the score, after which a general struggle takes place over the chest, the Barber declaring that it contains the dead body of his friend, while the Call not unnaturally exclaims that the whole business is a robbery The Caliph enters to stop the uproar, and listens to each of the parties. Again does the Barber, by a capital patter song in which he proceeds to give an account of his ancestry and family, declare that in the chest is a dead body, while the C idi still avers that it contains his daughter's " treasure " The chest is opened, and Nureddin, to the astonishment of the Call, is soon in a swoon He, however, Rev iv es on the rang the magic name of Morgiana, and the Caliph, remarking that the maiden could have no better " treasure " than a husband, unites the young couple, giving a few parting words to the Barber as the curtain falls Senor Sarasate and Madame Berthe Marx are the recipients of a diamond scarfpin and diamond and sapphire ring, accompanied by complimentary letters from the Queen, in recognition of thou- services at Balmoral.
