THE LAST EUSE. . A. MEDLEY. Dedicated by the ghost of an Irish -poet to the, mortal remains of an Irish Patriot. 'Tis the last ruse of Duffy, The worst he has shown— All his former companions Have faded and gone. But the knight that once to Tara's halls From politics had fled, Now seeks again th' Assembly's walls, To show he's not yet dead. Sir John the Big again awakes, And cheering promise gives, That though the spinal backbone breaks, One Irishman still lives! Where, Duffy, wilt bury thy shame ? Where—in what desolate place, Hide the last wreck of a name, Broken and stained by disgrace ? In the brow-beaten Speaker's soft chair Shall thy once fiery eloquence rust ? This the end, after scheming and care, Of the hero whom no one dared trust. When you remember all The patriots link'd together, You've seen around you fall Like leaves in wintry weather. Thou art like one who walks alone, The ghost of times departed, Thy lights have fled— Thy garlands dead, Thou art by all deserted ! Who fearless speaks of forty-eight, Still blushes at thy name, The Speaker scorns a patriot's fate, Nor hides his head for shame. The others of thy former band Have found a diffrent fate, But a true man, like you man, May rule the Queen's debate !
