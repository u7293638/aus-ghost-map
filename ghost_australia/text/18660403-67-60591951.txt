SONG. Ah! the solace in the sitting, Sitting by the fire, When the wind without is calling, And the three-fold clouds are falling, With the rain-racks intermitting, Over slope and spire, Ah! the solace in the sitting, Sitting by the fire. Then and then a man may ponder, Sitting by the fire, Over fair far days, and faces Shining in sweet-coloured places Ere the thunder broke asunder, Life and dear Desire. Thus and thus a man may ponder, Sitting by the fire. Waifs of song pursue, perplex me Sitting by the fire; Just a note and lo! the change then; Like a child I turn and range then Till a shadow starts to vex me-- Passions wasted pyre. So do songs pursue, perplex me Sitting by the fire. Night by night--the old old story-- Sitting by the fire-- Night by night the dead leaves grieve me: Ah! the touch when youth shall leave me, Like my fathers, shrunken hoary, With the years that tire, Night by night! that old old story Sitting by the fire. In the green glen--O my brother Sitting by the fire-- I could hide my face and sleep now, Far from those who laugh and weep now-- Far away from any other, 'Neath yon mountain-spire: Even in the glen--my brother Sitting by the fire. Ah! the solace in the sitting, Sitting by the fire, When the rainy Autumn cometh Where the ghost-wind roameth, roameth-- While the ruined woods are splitting In the thunder's ire. Ah! the solace in the sitting, Sitting by the fire. H. KENDALL.
