I 'l, C OURIOUS WILL. rThosill, dated March 20, 1874,:of:the Rov. Wllliam Bill, late of Landedown Villas, Springfield Road, Cotham," Bristol, Baptist'.minister, who, died on 11th 'November last, hbe been proved at the district registry, Bristol, by Emerson, Gerrish, and Thomas iowbecr, the executors; osOer £8900. After tho.dath'of his'.wife he gives to he Society for the Rolief of Aged' and Infl:m' Baptist Ministers, instituted in Bath; .1816, and to the Baptist Foreign MIissionary Society, each' £100l "The testator directes " the payment of allsmy just debts, funeral and testaienhtary expenses, as soon as conveniently may be after my doparturoto heaven;. bhot, as this is to be my final public document, I shall hear record my detestation of all State establishments of religion, believing them to ;be anti- soriptural' and.soul.ruining. I have for years 'prayed the King of Zion to overthrow the politico-eccle. siastical .Establishment of the:British Empire, and I leavo the world with a full conviction that such prayer mu?st ere long be answered. ' I thirst to see the Church brought down, the Church by man'set up, 'for millions .by it are led on to drinkan'lhtter cup. I desiro all pose terity to know that William Hill was a conscientious Trinitarian Baptist Minister, and that he believed infant sprinkling to be from his Satonic Majesty, the keystone of Popery, therefore the parent of unnumbered terrible Ievils; this delusion muestalso' pass away at the divinely appointedtime, and the immersoioi of believers as plainly I taught by the great Teacher, the Holy Ghost, and the Apostles, shall one day universall trumph. Man says some water in the face, and that before the child han grace, is what is meant in Jesas'e weord,' by being'buried in the Lord. The deadly drinking customs of professors and non-professors are likewise doomed. Heavyet dash all error, sin, and the devil from the earth, and cause trutb, holiness, andOhrist'everywhrea toprevail. Amen."
