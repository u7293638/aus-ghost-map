ONLY FORTY OUT iOF FIFTY BOOKS to ttH jfirrrroNT Tothb Editor. — Sir. — Scene opens with ghosts of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Zeno and Pericles— five Greeks of renown. Plato assumes the presidency, and begins thus : — ' We have read and digested all literature qf fact within the Roman, Assyrian and Egypt ian world, and unless other mental pabulum be forthcoming our reasoning faculty may well vacate its seat.' ' Stop,' gasps Socrates, 'since our time great changes have over taken the terrestrial sphere, and perad venture Modern Athens — Gawler — could amply supply our needs in this respect.' 'No! no!' cried Aristotle, ''tis certain tliey have no literature t)f facts capable of supplying our wants, nor should I judge that they possess men with mental acumen sufficient even to appreciate such informa tion. Since our day the human family in all matters pertaining to the faculty of mind have sadly ^deteriorated ; for I noticed that at a meeting of what no doubt represented the very cream of our Modern Athenians, they proposed seeing tjiey had nothing of history science or art worth reading, to furnish their shelves with trashy rubbish up to the extent of 8-10 of their purchases.' ' No ! No ! don't send tliare.'' Now uprose the* conclave bitterly disappointed at the sublime depth to which their descendants had sunk, and grieved that men gifted -with in telligence bad created such a vicious, depraved taste since the days of Pebicles.
