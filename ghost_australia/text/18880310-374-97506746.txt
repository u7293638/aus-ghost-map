' All her life Margaret Hunter had lived alone with her grandfather in a gray stone house in the midst of a garden; which hid it from the road. They had few visitors. Old Mr. Morely would have nothing to do with neighbours, and those who came to the house were principally old friends from a distance. And, thinking of the cold, stern man, w had never once caressed her, it did not seem her parents. He was not unkind to her fond of her, but sh stitious ; and p strange one - a woman no l dently a hard-working person, yet as ev had, now and again, crossed her path in some lonely place, and talked to her as no one else did. She had asked her name once, and the woman had said: "Call me Martha." "Martha was my mother's name" said the child-"she died before I ever knew her."
