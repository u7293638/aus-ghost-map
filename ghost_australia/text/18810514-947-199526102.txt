That's my opinion of it.' Mrs Bellamy was quite right. Itwas not a laughing matter. .;' Mr Callow; spent many hours riding in a hansom cab to and from Clarges-street arid Great Grasshopper; House, making inquiries 'concerning- Mr Milbourno.' It was taken for granted that he would pre sent himseir in the course of the day \- dither at 'the'' office' or at his residence; But time passed; he did not appear, and no tidings of himwere forthcoming. .: \ It is to be pixplained, however, that Mr Milbourne wasnot in the, habit of taking away this key with him, for it^was an in strument of substantial size and weight, . yet by no means suited for deposit in a gentleman's pocket. ~,\ He was usually con tent to place the key in his writing desk, which was secured by a patent. lock. Arriving at his office, it' had been his wont to unlock his desk and release the key of the safe, which was riot, it will.be understood, a mere strong box, but 'ah iron-cased chamber of some size, contain ing all the more important books, papers, and writings of the firm. ' _ .'.'! ' ? Mr Kimber was surprised to find that Mr , Milbourne's desk had been left un locked ; the key. of the safe was riot within it, however. 'A-jcesB(to the safe was very necessary for the carrying on of the busi ?riess of the firm. ' Certain of the clerks 'found some difficulty in sufficiently occu pying themselves in the absence of the key and of Mr. Milbourne. ... ..A duplicate key, as Mr Kimber knew, was in the hands of Mr Netherston, at Torquay. It might become necessary to appriso Mr Netherston of Mr Melbourne's non-appearance, and' apply for the dupli cate key. But this was not o step to be taken without deliberation: ?? -It was very desirable that in his state of health Mr Netherston should not be troubled. But, of course, he would have to be troubled in the event of Mr Milbourne'u absence continuing. ??.;?; ; ...-?. -.-,-.-:--.- . The day passed. To Mr Kimber^s great distress nothing was seen or heard of Mr Milbourne. Mr Kimbor resolved that he would -defer action in the matter till the 'following .morning.

An hour later and his room was empty. He had gone forth; and nothing more was known of him. No one had seen.him.; ??:?'?./;'.? .'-. .'.\\.-.i .?? ' ?' -\ '; ; ?? To be precise, it waB on the night of Tuesday, the 14th March, that Mr Mil bourne disappeared. It was on the morn ing of the 15th that Mr Callow; called' in Glafges-street -.; on the :l6tth he was sent down to Mr Netherston, at Torquay, who forthwith telegraphed that. he' would him self arrive .in London on the 17th, bring .'ing:' with' him his duplicate key of the ?iron safe. ; . .Inspector Farraby confessed to himself that, he eras puzzled. He was careful not to confess as much to anybodyelse, how over, indeed, he did not hesitate to maintain- that he possessed a clue to the mystery, the while, he assumed an aspect of shrewd reserve and calm vigilance. He had fairly taken up his abode in Great Grasshopper House. : ' i ? With the presence of Mr Netherston upon the scene, and the productioa of his duplicate key, the mystery of the disap pearance of Mr Milbourne was,solved, but in the most painful arid even appalling manner. The' strong ropm haying' been opened, the body of the missing solicitor was discovered in a huddled attitude upon the iron floor. Apparently the poor man had been thrust into the room with some violence. 'Theie was a wound upon his scalp where his head had struck against one of the iron shelves of the safe. He had, perhaps, already taken up his hat and umbrella when the murderous assault was made upon him ; at any rate, these rested beside hisbody.' It was. possible,, of course, that they had been flung into the safe after him.' ' '?'?'?'? ' * ' . '. ? ' Murder,' observed Mr Ferraby, in a low tone,' if there' ever'was a murder;' ; Mr Netherston. was deeply affected. Ha staggered back in a fainting state, and but for the support of Mr Kimber would have fallen , heavily. ^Presently he / rer covered himself, however, and said with great solemnity , and force : 'My poor partner ! ' I have lost the best and truest friend man ever had., One more true hearted and right minded, more just and honourable in his dealings, more . kind and tender andamiable in all the relation's of life than/ my , poor partner,. Daniel Milbourne, never trod the earth. But our duty is clear. .' A _foul and , cruel murder has been committed. Justice must -be vindicated. God will help us to discover the criminal and avenge the crime. In spector you will understand that no ex pense will be spared. 'There will be. an inquest, of course. No doubtthe Govern ment will offer a reward for the .discovery of the murderer. I shall myself offer a like reward or a larger. I will spare no pains or money in dragging to justice the murderer of Daniel Milbourne.' A doctor was sent for, but rather as a matter of form than for any other reason. He pronounced, what all knew beforehand, that Mr Milbourne had been dead some days ; that he had died from suffocation. Excepting the wound upon his, head his body showed no marks of violence. His dress was not torn or disordered in any way. There was no evidence of his haying been engaged in any conflict / with his murderer. A forcible push into the strong room, and then the quick turning ? of the key upon him, and the murder of Daniel Milbourne seemed to , have ,, been , accom plished. :?- :-.---.-.:'-''. j'..a!.-:':%-,i!.'.'}'i--:'1'.'

As Mr Netherston spoke he glanced round *iio room, seek ing, as it seemed, a means of illustrating his remarks. ' Those gloves for instance.' He pointed to a pair of light tan coloured gloves resting upon Mr Milbourne's writ ing table, and about half-hidden by the inkstand. 'Whose gloves' are they,] by the way ?', They're not inine.' ' i ' Nor mine,' said the Inspector. ' ' No, nor poor Melbourne's. He never wore gloves that colour, and he could hot have squeezed his hands into gloves; of that size.'' '. '' ' , ' : '' Inspector Farraby pFomptly took pos session of the gloves, and; with an' assump- tion of a careless air, he sought their ? wner. He .'ascertained thai they did not belong,; to Mr Kimber, to Mr Callo*r',5or any of the other clerks in the office. .They were\ a man's gloves, of small size. They had been worn, but were not much 'soiled. To whom did they belong ? Were they, indeed, to be considered as a clue ; to the discovery of poor Mr.Milbourn'e's murderer? The Inspector examined them closely. Did they present any marks by whioh their owner might be traced? The Inspector smelt them. Was there not a faint odour about them, as of sulphur and turpentine, betraying that thpy.had been cleaned ?, Were these signs initials This was certainly the name of the maker or the trader who had vended them ; and the figures denoting the size were plainly visibley' 7^.'- A stranger's , 'gloves found in the mur dered man's room ! The inspector wrapped the ? glpveB in paper, and deposited them ini his pocket.,: He made an entry of some length in his, note book, and then' took- to brooding, a- good deal over the matter of ,the murder, as though discovery could be arrived at by a sort of incubative, process; '?' f; -. ;, -':'''.; v. ?-.- '?? - '? ;;i' \ ''? There v?a.9,: of course, an; inquest. The coroner's jury'viewed the body, the strong .'room, arid generally the premises occupied by.the firm of Netherston and Milbourne. The facts, of which' the reader has already been1 informed, were duly stated in evi dence by MrNetherston, Mr Eamber,:Mr. Callow, arid others. There had been;* post-mortem ' examination of the body. Inspector Farraby waa called. In the course of his testimony, he produced the gloves found in Mr. Milbourno's, rooiri.. He was obliged to confess, however, that he had not , succeeded in ^ traoing 'the gloves to their owner. The ' case was enveloped in mystery. It was' proposed that there . should be an open verdict; : Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown. : Suddenly a voice was heard, in the court. 'Mr Coroner, I request that my evidence may.be heard: 'Those gloves are mine. I identify them.' . J The ownerjof the voice's name,it appeared, was Charles Delmar. H e was .not in, busi ness. He possessed some* means, of his own,' land he confessed that . he made money1 on the - turf. A bill, of exchange accepted by him had come into , the possession of a client of the firm of Neth erston and Milbourne. He had failed to honour his acceptance. He had been threatened, therefore, with legal proceed-, ings, that produced the letter ho hud received from the firm. It informed' him that a writ would bo issued against him cib'the 15th of March. To avoid this, he hurried up froni- Newmarket on the after noon of the 14th. B* was late in calling at the office of Messrs. Netherston' arid Milbourne, for his train had been consider ably behind its time. He brought with, him money to satisfy the claim made }-y the lawyers on behalf of their client. J,t was later, than 6 o'clock when he reached the office* of the firm, but he could not Bay how much' later. It might have been; halfTpast;6. - The clerks had left appar-~ ently, -but the. doors were not closed, arid the gas, was burning in the office. A gentle man who stated himself to be Mr Mil bourne came from an innerroom. The wit-: ness had-never seen him before^had never^ befbre;entere'd:Great Grasshopper House. ?He explained, to Mr Milbourne the ob-1 ' jeo.t;of. his visit'; His interview scarcely'.-' lastedvifive, 'minutes. He handed the1 solicitor bank notes for £80,- with one' sovereign :and some odd silver— he could notistate .the precise amount— in , settle-' menti of the claim for interest , and legal expenses.-, ]n return he receired the dis honoured- bill^, which he produced. He didnotask-for a formal receipt ; he -w'as content to obtain possessiori'~of.:ithe\,bill. Whydidhe pay iu bank, notes? He, hud received bank-notes upon 'Newmarket racecourse, arid had naturally applied these to satisfy the demand made upon, him. Mr]Milbourne would probably have demurred to accepting his cheque in ex change. The interview over, the matter of business concluded,; he: had: left Mrr Milbourne at ' his desk. Could: not say whether he had or not, 'in going out, closed the door of the office, behind him He had. noticed the large iron safe ; it was open, and the key stood in the lock, he thought, but he was not sure. Had not observed anyone lurking about the entrance to the office. All was very quiet. Did not remember meeting' anyone in the passage. Did not miss the' gloves immediately ; thought, at first, he must have left them in the cab which con veyed him from the station to Great Grasshopper House. Recollected after wards that he had them on when he entered the lawyer's office ; but it was too late then to go back for them. He had left London the following morning. Had not seen the newspaper for some days. Directly he heard of the murder he hurried back to the town to give evidence before the coroner. He had only arrived! in town lhat morning, and now told the Court all he knew. In reply to the Cor oner's inquiry as to the numbers of the bank notes he had pud to Mr Milbourno, he replied that he did not know the numbers. Many bank notes passed through his hands, but he never kept account , of their numbers. The notes came to him from strangers, for whom he had made bets on commission. . The notes had probably been obtained from the local banks about Newmarket. He under stood, however, that country banks did not record the numbers of ths Bank; of England riotesthey received or paid out. '-Itr-wa8 'judged that Mr Delmar had $$? given his evidence very fairly. He had answered promptly every question put to ? j i him. An adjournment of the inquiry was proposed, but the Coroner thought that 'upon the whole, they might as well termi- ''* nate^ their labours and leave further pror ceedingsto the police. So. the jury ' returned an open verdict. ? ? V General opinion accounted for the mur- \ dur in this manner : Some evil-disposed^ j person, lurking : about in the deserted ' passage of Great Grasshopper House had watched Mr;Delmar enter! the.solicitor's office, and seen him transfer bank notes to.Mr Milbourne in exchange f&r; the dis honoured bill. Mr Delmar haying taken his departure, it was easy for this evil- I disposed person to steal behind 'Mr I Milbourne, snatch' the '?nots's' from him^i. I and -suddenly., thrust him. into his own I safe.' The' bank1 notes,'' o!f 'course, were I missing,, without; auy .chance ''of their I being traced. : The key of 'the safe was I also missing. ,.,?,.;?:..,;-.-,., ,^'-:'.'_., .?'./,.-.,.
