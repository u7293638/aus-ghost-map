WHEN THE WIND BLOWS. When the wind blows—wind of the north ; Wind of the wild, dark, raging sea, Lashing its foam to a furious froth Where never a star in the heavens be, Shut from a world of ceaseless snows, Somewhere, safe when the north wind blows, Gold Hair doth sleep ! When the wind blows —wind of the east, Wind of a dawn that is chill and gray ; Of a driving rain when the day hath ceased And boats steal up like ghosts from the bay ; Nose to the mist that looms and grows, Somewhere, safe, when the east wind blows, Blue Eyes doth sleep ! When the wind blows—wind of the west, Wind from the way of the reddening sun ; Rocking the great, wide world to rest, Greeting the young stars one by one ; Where tho scent of the pine tree comes and goes, Somewhere, far, where the west wind blows, Gray Eyes doth sleep ! When the wind blows—wind of the south, Wind of a bloom and a nightingale's thrill : Stealing the smile of her red rose mouth. Breathing a kiss over forest and hill ; Hushed, while the silvery river flows. Somewhere, O sweet, when the south wind blows— Dark Eyes doth sleep ! — Viginia Woodward Cloud.
