Honeysuckle Point Fire Brigade. THE annual benefit to the Honeysuckle Point Volunteer Fire Brigade took place last evening, at the Victoria Theatre, and was, financially, a great success. Previous to the doors being opened at the theatre, a torchlight prosession took place, com- mencing from the Cottage Bridge, and ending in Hunter~street. The Lambton Brigade had the premier position ; the City Fire Brigade was next ; and the Honey- suckle Point Volunteers followed with their engines, "The Invincible" and "Little Wonder," beautitfully decorated. The latter has been newly done up under the supervision of the energetic secretary (Mr. William Hillier) and some members of the brigade. The procession eventually marched around to the theatre, where the entertainment, tendered by the members of the recently formed Mohawk Ministrels took place. The performance was of the usual character ; Mr. Alfred Boyd, in the first part, being particularly applauded for his ballad " Mother's with the Angels." In the second part the specialities were J. Huntsdale, in his stamp orations, Joe Harman in his lightning changes, and C. Harding in his clog and song and dance manouvres. The farce "Grandmother's Ghost" concluded the performance. Prior to the rising of the curtain in the third part, the whole of the firemen appeared before the audience, and Mr. Hillier, the secretary, returned thanks to those present, and also to the members of the Artisan's Band for their gratuitous attendance ; to Mr. James Gow for plants ; to Messrs. Beale and Co. for use of piano ; to Messrs. John Ash and Son for loan of horses ; to Mr. Joseph Creer for a donation of Â£5 ; and to the members of both brigades for their attendance.
