HAMLET RE-CREATED. j And the man that did it was Beerbohm Tree, the most impersonal and versatile of all our actors. I Hamlet, the unspeakable Dane, has of late years been done to death by ambitious artists- who successively ! have replied to the 'To be' with 'not to be.' Tho sight of Wilson Barrett disporting his cumbrous length 011 the steps of the throne, and soliloquising before a Princess's audience was not, one to forget fiiisilv. 'Pnnr linsfnil. llsmo lin Iimq imloml cnftnwwl the ' slings and arrows of outrageous' â€” actors. But Mr. Beerbohm Tree has bid the dead bones live, and the. manes of Shakespeare are appeased. There was a splendid first night audience in the Ilayniarket on the Thursday the play opened. Mr. Tree grasps the subtlety of the l-Ole admirably. Hamlet's underlying lovo for Ophelia is beautifully accentuated by tone \- 1 and glance. Tho house \vas moved en masse at tin/ end of the second act, when bending ovor his tablets by the red fire, Hamlet cries, 'The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch tho conscience of the king.' In tlio fifth act the churchyard is a spring parterre of blooms, a new rendering, and thither Hamlet returns to Ophelia's grave. Tho fencing scene with Laertes is a magnificent piece of intellectual grasp, shown iu the actor's expression and acting when he looks Laertes in the eye and reads his treacheiy. Then again, Mr. Tree's subtlety shows its power. Mrs. Tree makes a charming Ophelia, delicately as well as strongly given. JIr. Arthur fiacre, as Horatio, also secured a triumph, and Mr. Fernandez, as Ghost, and Mr. Fred Terry as Laertes were generally successful, fhakespenrc this season at the Hay market will not well ruin.
