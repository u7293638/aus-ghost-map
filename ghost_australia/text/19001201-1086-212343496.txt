A Sprig of Shamrock. Just a little sprig of shamrock, in a letter where the tears Which have blotted words together have been dried these many years. Loving lines, yet sadly cheerful — how 'twas' lonesome here to-day. Then a pause, a little tearful. " Dear, you 1 are so far away !" Every sentence has its token of a love that could not fail, Throbbing with a faith unspoken, though the ink is growing pale. Faded are the lines, dim-lettered, like sad ghosts upon the page '; Ah ! that poor love should be fettered with the rusty chains of age ! Then that line, "I picked the shamrock from that spot, dear, you well know — Where we walked and talked together — oh, it seems so long ago !" And at last, " Love, how much better it will be when, by-and-by. We'll not need to write a letter to each other, you and I." If you knew liow I have needed some new token thro' the years You have slept away, unheeding, it must move your soul to tears ! If you still knew how I love you, how I miss you day by day, Since the shamrock grew above you, you could never stay away ! Take all treasures, Time, I cherish, fame and hope and love at last, Flitting things which needs must perish — spare this memory of the past, Lying with a sprig of shamrock in a" letter where the tears Which have blotted words together have been dried these many years ! — J. D. Arons.
