Over a Million Sterling Lost. KEEP THE MONEY IN THE COUNTRY. A shocking bad piece of news for^the Shadow Party has been telegraphed from Melbourne to the efiect that in the previous nine months .Â£1,600,000, in gold coin had been sent out from Victoria. Now, this piece of news is a perfect blizzard to the party, because, in and out of 6eason, they have been shrieking m the public ear the statement that it was only under free trade that gold was sent out of the colony. Had the fact not been officially stated by the Victorian authorities themselves, it would have been placarded as a freetrade invention. Now, how ever, the world knows it, including the working people, and so another ghost of the Shadow Party is laid low. What a sacrilege ! Over H millions of gold sent out of the country, and protection there high and strong. Why didn't the Vic torians keep the money in the country, and then they would have had the money and the goods, too. Eh, Mr. Garvan ?
