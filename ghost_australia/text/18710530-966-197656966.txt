TO THE EDITOR. Sir— " The quality of mercy is not strained; It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath; it is twice bless'd— It blesseth him that gives and him that takes, 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown; His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings. But mercy is above the sceptre sway; It is enthroned in the hearts of kings; It is an attribute to God himself. And earthly power doth then shew likest God's When mercy seasons justice." _ But for the letter in your issae of to-day signed "Samuel Tomkinson," I would not have said one word on thispainful case; bat it appears to me that Mr. TomkinBon is very fond of poking his nose into all unpleasant matters, and often shows a very vindictive spirit. I suppose he would like to hang Douglas, who, if he'did perpetrate the murder for which he is convicted, did so when he was hardly responsible for his own acts. If I was in such an unfortunate position as Douglas, I would rather suffer tne extreme penalty of the law than be imprisoned for life, and in the former case perhaps Mr. Tomkinson would perform the office of hangman. Mr. Tomkinson's remarks about the Bev. Mr. Parsons are very rude and uncalled for; and as one of the public of Adelaide, I would recommend him to be somewhat more charitable, and not to meddle so much with public affaire, and confine himself to his business as a Bank Manager. I am, Sir, &c.;, SHAKSPEARE'S GHOST.
