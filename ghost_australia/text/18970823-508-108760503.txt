ANlii&liii-; BY EDWARD P. ROE, ' :7. ??';? CHA^ISg :yL ''?? : '-. ' ? .Marian waited fofr;heE.fatliet'« return,; Lav ing been much too deeply excited for the speedy advent of guiet Bleep. When at last he came she told aim 'everything. As she described the first part of the Interview his brow darkened, but his face, softened as she drew towards the close. When she ceased lie said— 'Don't you eee I w.as right in saying that your own tact would guide you better than my treason? 'If 1, instead of your own nature. had directed -you, we should have made an awful mess of it. Now let me think a mo ment. This young fellow has suggested an idea to me — a general Hue of action which I think yon can carry out. There is nothing like a good definite plan— not. cast-iron, you know, but flexible and modified by circum stances as you go along, yet so clear and' de fined as to give you something to aim' at. Con found it, that's what *s the matter with our military authorities. If M'Clellan is a ditch digger let them put a general hi command; or, if he is a general, give him what he wants arid let him alone. * There is no head, no plan. I confess, however, that just now I am chiefly interested in your campaigns, 'which, after all, stand the best chance of bringing about union, in spite of your negative, mood manifested to night. Nature will prove too strong for you, and some day— soon probably— you will con quer, only to surrpnder yourself. Be that as it may. the plan I suggest need not be inter fered with. Be patient. I'm only following the tactics in vogue — taking the longest way round to the point to be attacked. Lane said that if yon carried out your present principle of action you would have a power possessed by few. I think he is right. I'm not flat tering you. Little power of any kind can co exist with vanity. The secret of your fasci nation is chiefly in your individuality. There are other girls more beautiful and accomplish ed who have not a'tithe of it. Now and then a woman is peculiarly gifted with the power to influence men— strong men, too. You had this potency in no slight degree when neither your heart nor your brain was very active. You will find that it will be greater when you are sixty than at present. If you avoid the Scylla of vanity on the one hand, and the Cha rybdis of selfishness on the other, and if the sympathies of your heart keep pace with a cultivated mind, you will steadily grow an so cial influence. I believe it for ibis reason: A weak girl would have been sentimental with Lane, would have yielded temporarily, either ?to his entreaty or to his anger, only to disap » point him in the end. or else would have been conventional in her refusal, and so sent him to the bad/ probably. You recognised just wbat you could be to him. and had the skill nature, rather, for all was unpremeditated— to obtain an influence by which you can incite him to a boteir manhood and a greater suc cess, perhaps, than if he were your accepted lover. Forgive this long preamble. I am thinking aloud and feeling my way, as it were. What did you ask him to promise? Why, to make tbe most and best of hhnself. Why not. let this sentence suggest the social scheme of your life? Drop fellows who have neither brains nor heart— no good mettle in them — and ; so far as you have influence strive to inspire the others to make the most and best of them selves. You would not find the kitchen-maid a rival on this plan of life: nor, indeed, I ro gret to say, many of your natural associates. Outwardly your life will appear much the same, but your motive will change everything, and flow through all your action like a moun tain spring, rendering it impossible for you to poison any lifo.' 'Oh, papa, the very possibilty of what you suggest makes life appear beautiful. The idea of a convent!' 'Convents are the final triumphs of idiocy. If, bad women could be shut up and^nade to say prayers most of the time, no harnr at least would be done— the good, problematical; but to immure a^ woman of sweet, natural, God-bestowed impulses is the devil's worst' practical joke in this vpbrld. Come, little girl, it's late. Think over the scheme; try it as you have a chance; use your power to incite . men to make the most and best of themselves. This is better than levying your little tribute of flattery and attention, like other belles— a phase of life as. common 'as cobble-stones and as old as vanity. For instance, you have an artist. among your friends. Possibly you can make him a better artirt 'and. a better fellow in every way. De&R; all muffs and sticks; don't waste yonrssfifiuea them. Have con siderable charity JKrtseme of the wild fellows, none for their folly, and from the start tolerate no tendencies toward sentimentality. You will find that the men who admire girls bent on making eyes rather than making men will 6oon disappear. Sensible fellows won't mis understand you, even though prompted to more than friendship; and you 'will have a circle of friends of which any woman might be proud. Of course you will find, at times that unspoken negatives will not satisfy; out if a woman has tact, good sense, and sinceri ty, her position is impregnable. As long as she is not inclined to love a man herself, she can, by a mere glance, not only define her po sition, but. defend it. By simple dignity and reserve she. can say to all, 'Thus far and no farther.' If, without encouragement, any one seeks to, break through this barrier, he meets a quiet negative, which he must .respect, and hi nis heart -does respect. Now, little girl, to sum up your visit, with -its long talks and their dramatic and unexpected illustration, I see no thing to prevent you from going forward and' making the best and most of your life accord ing to1 nature and. truth. You have a good start, and a jather better chance than falls to the lot of the majority.' . - ? 'Truly,' said .jfarian, thoughtfully, 'we don't appear to grow old and -change by time i so much as by what happens— by what we think and f eeL Everything appears changed, including you and myself.*' 'It's more hi appearance than in reality. You will find, the impetus ,of your old life so strong that it will be hard even to change the . direction of the current ''-? ITou will he much the same outwardly, as r'«aid;before.v The stream^wiU flow through the same -channel of characteristic traits and habits. The .vital change must be In the stream itself — the mo tive from which life springs.' ' ' . . How true her father's words seemed on the following evening after her return! ? Her mother, .as she sat down, to their dainty little dinner, looked as if her serenity had been un disturbed by a single perplexing thought. dur- ing the past few days. There was the same elegant, yet rather youthful costume for a lady of her years; the same smiling face, not yet so full in' its outline as- to have .lost all its girlish beauty. It was marred' by few evidences of care and trouble, nor was it spiritualised by; thought or deep experience. Marian observed her closely, not with any disposition towards cold or conscious criticism, but in drderthat she. might better understand the' conditions of heroin life. She also had a wakening ; curiosity 7?to know just what- her mother w4# to her fath^ and. tie. to her.

'You are right* mamma. It seems to me that neither of us half appreciates papa. He works right on so quietly arid steadily, and yet he is not a -machine, but a man.' . 'Oh, I appreciate him.' Nine out of ten that' he might have married . would have made him no end. of trouble. I don't make him any. Well, after talking about, the people we used to know. Mr. Lanniere begau a tirade against the times and the war, which he says have cost him a hundred thousand dollars; but hie took care in a quiet way to let me know that he has a good many hundred thousand left. I declare, Marian, you might do a great deal worse.' s 'Do you not think I migbf do a great Seal better?' the young girl asked, with a frown. 'I have no doubt ffou- think so. Girls will be romantic. I was, myself; but as one goes on. in life one finds that a million, more or less, is a very comfortable fact. Mr. Lan niere has a fine house in town, but he's a great traveller, and an habitue of the best hotels of this country and Europe. You could see the world with him on its golden side.' 'Well, mamma, I want a man— not an. ha bitue. What's more, I must be in love with the man, or he won't stand the ghost of a chance. So you see the prospects are that you will have me on your hands indefinitely. Mr. Lanniere, indeed! What should I be but a part of his possessions — another expensive luxury in his luxurious life? I want a man like papa— earnest, large-brained, and large hearted — who, instead of inveighing ? against the times, is absorbed in the vital questions of the day, and is doing his part to solve them rightly. I would like to take Mr. Lanniere into a military hospital or cemetery, and show him what the war has cost other men.' 'Why, Marian, how you talk!' 'I wish I could make you know how I feel. It seems to me that one has only to think a little and look around in order to feel deeply. I read of an awful battle while coming up in the cars. We have been promised, all the spring; that Richmond would be taken, the jyar ended, and all go on serenely again: but it doesn't look like it.' 'What's the use of women distressing them selves with such things?' said Mrs. Vosburgh, irritably. 'I can't bear to think of war and its horrors, except as they give spice to a story. Our whole trouble is a big political squabble, and you know I detest politics. It is just as Mr. Lanniere says — if our people had only let slavery alone all would have gone on well.-,. The leaders on both sides will find out before the summer is over that they have gone too far and fast, and they had better set tle their differences with words rather than blows. We shall all be shaking hands and making up before Christmas.' 'Papa, doesn't think so.' 'Your father is a German at heart. He has the sense to be practical about every-day af fairs and enjoy a good dinner, but he amuses himselii with' cloudy speculations and ideals and vast questions about the welfare of the world, or the 'trend of the centuries,' as he said one day to me. . I always try to laugh him out of such vague nonsense. Has he been talking to you about the- 'trend of the cen turies' ?' 'Nor mainma, he has not,' replied Marian, gravely; 'but if he does I shall try to under stand, what he means and be interested. I know that papa feels deeply about the war, aud means to take the most effective part in it that he can, and that he does not think it will end so easily as you believe. These facts make me feel anxious, for I know how resolute papa is.' 'He has no right to take any risks,' said the lady, emphatically. 'He surely has the same right that other men have.' 'Oh, well,'- continued Mrs. Vosburgh, with a shrug, 'there is no use in Borrowing trouble. When it comes to acting, instead of dreaming and speculating on vast, misty questions, I *can always talk your father into good sense. That is the best thing about him— he is well balanced, m spite of his tendency to theories. When I show him that a thing is quixotic he .laughs, shrugs his shoulders, and good naturedly goes on in the even tenor of his way. It was the luckiest thing in the world for him when he married me, for I soon learn ed his weak points, and have ever guarded him against them. As a result he has,bad a quiet, prosperous career. If he wishes to serve the government in some eiviliaa ca pacity, and is well-paid for it, why shouldn't he? But I 'would never hear of his going to the front, fighting, and marching in Virginia mud and swamps. If he ever breathes such a thought to you, I hope you will aid me 5n« showing him how cruel and preposterous,, it is.' Marian sighed, as she thought: 'I now be gin to see how well papa understands mamma, but has she any gauge by which to measure him? I fear 'he has found his home lonely, in spite of good dinners.' 'Come, my dear,' resumed Mrs. Vosburgh, 'we are lingering too long. Some of your friends may be calling soon, although I said I diu not know whether you would be at home to-night or not Mr. Lanniere will be very likely to come, for I am satisfied that he has serious intentions.' Whafs more, you might do worse — a great deal worse.' 'Three times you have said that, mamma, and I don't like it,' said Marian, a little in .dignantly. 'Of 'course I might do worse; I might kill him, and I should be tempted to if I married him. You know that I do not care for. him1, and he knows it, too. Indeed, I scarcely respect huh. , You don't realise wbat you are* saying, for you would not have me act from purely mercenary motives?' 'Oh, certainly not; but Mi*. Iiaimiere is not a monster or a decrepit centenarian. He-» still in his prime, and is a very' agreeable and accomplished inan of the world. He is well-* connected, moves in the best society,- and could give his wife everything.' 'He couldn't give me happiness, and he would spoil my life.' 'Oh, Well, if you feel' fid/ .^there is nothing more to be said. Leah teTtiypii, though, that multitudes -of girls wdniQJ °be glad of your chance; but,, like eo - many ;^oung people, yop have Tomantic ideas, : aJid^o not appreciate the fact that happiness i ^results chiefly .
