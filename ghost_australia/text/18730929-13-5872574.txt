Ho remarked that when our Blessed Lord was asked, "Which is tho great commandment in the law?" he answered, "Thou shall love tho Loid thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is tho first and great commandant, and the second is like unto it, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself." In those two commandments wos comprehended the whole moral law; and they were inseparably connected with each other. Tho man who truly loved God could not but love his neighbour also ; and no man could love his neighbour unless ho loved God. But man did not naturally lovo cither God or his neighbour. Unaided by re- velation ho was wholly ignorant of God. The history of the world proved that all nations, both ancient and modern, which had been loft to exorcise their own unassisted reason had substituted as objects of worship, in tho placo of the ono living and truo God, who created tho heavens and the earth, either creations ,of his hand, as tho sun and moon, or a multitude of imaginary beings, such as Baal and Ashtaroth of the Zidonians and Bel of the Babylonians, or such as the fabulous gods and goddesses of tho Greeks and Romans. Of these it was impossible to conceive that any should bo loved by their worshippers. Tho qualities with which thoy were supposed to be endowod woto calculated to impress, with tenor, not to inspire with affection, those who believed in theuf. Nor did mall, when he acquired bj revelation a knowledge of the Divine Being and attri- butes, naturally love God lu order todo that he must be assured of God's love to him. Nor did man naturally lov e his neighbour. Ho natuiallj loved his father and mother, his wife and child, and othor near relatives Ho naturally loved his personal fnends, and those who had shown him kindness But ho did not natuiallj love his neighbour in tho comprehensive sense in whuh Our Lord had taught us by tho parable of the good Sama- ritan to understand the tenn. Ho did not lov c, did not manifest ,i compassionate re- gard for cvei j one, known or unknown, who vv as ni distress and needed his assistance.

ST. MARY'S, HOTHAM. The Rev. Canon Vance preached in the morning at St Mar) s Episcopalian Church, Hotham, to a laige congiegation. The rev. gentleman's text, taken from Matthew xvi 10, was as follows -"If any man will come aftei me, let him deny himself,'and take up lus cioss and follow me." In in- quiring what was the burden of which Christ spoke in the vv ords of the text, he argued that it was not only the death Chnst suffered on the cross, but also the great soirovv and allliction caused to him during his lifetime in this woild by the wickedness of mankind, which it was his mission toiemove Christ not only assuaged sulleimg by healing the sick and maimed, but s)inpathised with

ANDREW'S CHURCH There vu s a v eiy large congregation at the morning sen ice at St Andrew's (Presby- terian), Cailton The officiating minister was the Rev. D S M'Eachran, who chose for his text James i, 21 -"Pure religion and unde filed before God and the father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world " James, he said, gavo no countenance to the too w Kiely prevalent idea that works are everj thing una that faith is nothing, and that it matters not what a man believes, oiwhetliei he believes or not, pro- vided only he lives a good, honest life James guaided against any such idea m tw o wajs, m the iirat place, he assumed that faith is the loot of all religion, and las argument was directed to show, not that the fnut is evcrj thing and that the root is nothing, but that if there be no fruit m the branch theie can be no life in the root In the second place, the standaid of religion he Bet up was manifestly lnghei than that which they who magnifj works at the expense of faith set up 'J hose who made light of faith alwa)s had alow standaid of faith , and what they meant by goodworks genei.illj amounted to no more than this kindness to the needy and honesty in their bubincss tiansactions But what the Bible meant by good works was manifestly more than that 'Hie textsuggested four obseiva tions, the fast of which was, that no amount of religions knowledge or religious profession will compcnsite for the want of religious pioedce In eveiy age men had shown a great tendenej to lest content with religious knowledge, or the outvvaid observances of religion, to the neglect of its practical duties Tins evil still prevailed exceedingly Many men thought it enough if they knew w hat was light, even if they did not do it The second observation suggested by the text was, th.it no profession of lov e to God is true and real unless it bo accompanied with love to man But at the same time, love to man was not the sum of religion, nor was moiahty religion Religion implied feal of God 'lhere could be no due religion or true w01 ship of God, whero God was for- gotten, and the creature was put before tlie Cieator It was our duty to love our ncighl om as omselves but the fust and gieat coinuiaiidment was to love Cod with all our hcaits Iheio could be no

continually repiesentcd kindness to the poor and needy as a great pal t of true reIi_ion The fouith observation suggested was that while it is a great part of tme lehgion to visit the widow and

not intended that Christians should withdraw themselv es altogether from the world or immure themselves in monas tenes and convents, but that they should m their inner life detach then minda from the vanities of the world, and act up to the standard of their Christian calling Too many, far too many, however, of the pro- fessed believers in Christianity disregarded the injunction of their master,

failure in consequence of the inclemency of the vv eather A strong detachment of the Naval Brigade, under the command of Cap tam Fullarton and Lieutenant Bland, about 100 of the Sandridge Artillery under the command of Captain Swallow Lieutenant J M Eves and Acting Lieutenant Cowing and a few members of the Metropolitan Rifles, assembled about 3 o clock in tho railway station reserve A considerable number of tho inhabitants of Sandridge was also there including a large proportion of ladies A platform for the officiating minis ter was roughly extemporised with tho aid of a lorry and tlio serv ice began but the rain soon made it necessary to curtail it A few hjmns were sung the music being supplied by the band of the Sandridge Artillery The Rev Charles Clark intimated that ho had intended to have delivered an address but as las audience was not entirely confined to military men-who were at home in all weathers-but also included a good many ladies ho considered it best to postpone aiivthmgho had to say for a more suit ii le occasion It was subse quently intimated that should the weather 1 e fine a special voluntcei service would be held at Sandridge on tlie afternoon of next Sunday week The Rev C Clark stated that he would be there at f o clock sharp not military time which seemed to be about 20 minutes later than ordinaiy time A col lection was made by the non commissioned officers of the volunteer corps represented nnd ¿27 12s w as obtained A second col lection in aid of the Hospital Sunday move ment will be made when the postponed service takes place After the collection the volunteer force maichcd down the pier headed by the band then returned to the orderly room and dismissed ST P vUL S 1 he congregation at this church m the morn lung was rather larger than usual Hie Rev S L Chase preached from Galatians u 10 Only they would that we should re member the poor the same which I also was forwaid to do Hie rev gentleman re marked upon the various waj s of giving and impressed upon his hearers that gifts to the Lord were not acceptable unless made m a right spmt Hie gold silver and copper should be refined by grace Seveial things met together in good giving-power, willing- ness, and painstaking in the manner of giving. In this colony the Lord had be- stowed on his people great power to give, and few could Bay they were altogether shut out from giving for lack of means. The question for a man to consider was not "howlittle I may give' but "how much I may give," for as for giving hurting anyone, people might as well try and hurt themselves with healthy exercise. The more good aman did to others, the more good he did to him- self, for "it is moro blessed to gix'e than to receive." Good giving was giving in the way which most honoured God. The preacher then appealed to his hearers to consider the power of giving: God had given them, as the stewaids of his goods for a time on this earth, and besought them to consecrate what they had to the living God. The collec- tion at the close of the services amounted to £33 lGs. 7d. Theie were about 400 people present, inclusive of the military and the Industrial School children, who customarily attend this church. In the evening the services were conducted by the. Rev. C. S. Peiry, and the collection amounted to £11, making in all £4414s. 7d. ALL SAINTS' CHURCH, ST. KILDA. There was nothing special in the services at this church yesterday, with the exception of the offertory hymn, " Holy angels, rich and rare," copies of which, with the music, had been lithographed for St. Peter's and All Saints' churches, and were placed in every seat. The Rev. J. H. Gregory, the incum- bent, preached upon the subject of to-day's festival (St. Michael and All Angels), but without any special allusion to the charities for which the collection was made. The con- gregation was considerably below the average, there not being COO in the church. The sum of £5214s. lOd. was collected. A gold ring, valued at about £8, was placed in one of the bowls. Tlio collection at this church in the evening amounted to £23, making a total of £78. KEW CHURCH. The morning services at the Episcopalian I Chuich, Kew, were conducted by the Rev Robert Potter The church was well attended The vv ords of the text were as follows, from Matthewxxv , 40 -"The King shall answer and say-Venly I say unto you, inasmuch as je have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me " The rev gentleman said that by those words Christ identified himself with tlie sick and poor The King Himself asked of men food, and shelter, and sympathy, for ne assured them that what was done to His brethren was done to nun Ho Himself, indeed, was far above all wants and sorrows now, though He once, for their sakes, boro them all But His brethren still were often hungry, and naked, and sick and all man kind were His brethren He was their elder brother, of the same nature with them, it being written, "Ho took not on Him tlie nature of angels but He tookonnim the seed of Abraham " Amongst mankind, whilst the world lasted, there vv ould alw aj s be the sick and poor and needy, and of those Chnst the King said-"They are my brethren, my bones and my flesh Surely that was good news for them, for thereby they weie delivered from a condition which was very painful to every generous and honourable spirit To such a person there could scarcely be anj thing more pain- ful than to be utterly unable to give practical expression to his gratitude for enormous benefits received He said "practical ex- pression, ' because words no matter how eloquent were, after all but a poor way of expressing earnest feeling, and most fre auently, if they could not be accompanied by eeds had better be left unsaid And so, if their benefactor were far abov e all apparent possibility of receiv mg benefits m turn from them, he could not do them a more touching and thoughtful kindness than to come to them and sa)-"I know jou wish to prove youi lojalty, you can do so thus " Now that was exactly what Christ the King did for them that daj, for ne said to them-" If you love me-then these sufferers are my brethren, help them They must try and concentrate their minds on the thought that He WHO caine down fiom the heaven of beavens to cast m las lot with them-He who made Himself one with them in suffei mg that He might make them one with Him in tloij-asked then!

It was often blessed in leading the sufferers to look for their solid and everlasting happiness to the privi- leges and prospects of the Gospel, while it afforded the noblest opportunities to the more favoured portion of the community for manifesting that sympathy and aid which the great poet so happily describes as being twice blessed, '* in him that gives and in him that receives." Among otherthings, through having the poor always with them, compre- hending the sick, the blind, the halt, and the dumb, they had conatantly in their midst what was fitted to remind men of how the Saviour was graciously employed upon earth-healing all manner of diseases among the people-and at the same time presenting them with the remembrances of His power, as well as of nis mercy, causing the blind to see, the lame to leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb to sing aloud for joy : while, probably, if they had not the poor and the afflicted always with them, they would not only remain in a great measure ignorant of the precise nature of the miracles which Christ wrought, but might be disposed to doubt or deny them altogether, as being works which never were required and had never been performed. In closing his dis- course, he pointedly referred to that inimit- ably touching picture which Christ gave of the manner m which, at the last, He would recognise every act of kindness shown to the poor and the distressed, as having been virtually done unto himself. Although Christ was not now bodily present with them, they had always with thom those whom he had impressively and tenderly taught them to regard as in one senae the perpetual representatives of himself. The pulpit was also occupied in the evening hy- the Rev. Mr. Robertson. There was col- lected in the morning, £3115a. ; and in the evening, £1110s. ; total, £43 5s. WESLEY CHURCH, LONSDALE STREET.

'The Rev. James Martin conducted the services at this church both morning and . evening. In the morning he preached a sermon from the following text :-2nd Corin- thians ix. 2-"Your zeal bath provoked verj' many." He remarked that collections in aid of the hospitals had frequently been made before in the church, but this was the first occasion on which the different churches throughout the city had simultaneously j'oined in the movement. Hospital Sun- day had first been started in Birmingham, but the movement had since extended with success to other great towns in the kingdom, and finally to the metropolis. In a few years probably every village and hamlet in the country would have its Hospital Sunday. In this colony ho tmsted that the movement would prove equally successful, no pro- ceeded to show that in the early Christian church and amongst the Jewish nation special provision had always been made for the poor, and ho exhorted his hearers to follow the good example and give liberally. In the evening ho preached from Luke ix. 50-?" Tlie Son of Man is not como to destroy men's lives, but to save them." The collection for the morning .and evening amounted to £07 15s.

The rev. gentleman scarcely alluded to tho Hospital Sunday movement, bej'ond intimating that the theme of his sermon, to bo deli- vered in the evening at the Theatre Royal would be "The Humanity of Chris- tianity,'' and have special reference to the desirability of assisting the medical charities ?of the city in the manner proposed. The collection that was made is included in the amount collected at the Theatre Royal, as, in consequence of the special service held there, the Albert-Btreet Church was closed in the .evening.

He considered the bonevolert in- stitutions existing in our midst a crecit to the colony, and far nobler with their simple unpretending exteriors than all tho grandest structures of ancient Greece and Rome. _ A collection was made at the end of the service, when the sum of £50 was contributed. It is expected this sum will bo increased by con- tributions from tiloso members of the con- j f'içregation who were unable to attend. I SYNAGOGUE, ST. KILDA. A collection in aid of tho hospital charities ?was made at this synagogue on Monday last (the Hebrew new year), when the sum of £30 was contributed. Tho services were con- ducted by Mr. A. M.

Moses Rintel, senior minister, .preached a sermon from Ecclesiastes xii. 14, "For God shall bring every work into judg- ment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil."

In the even- ing Miss Turner took the subject of tlie man at the pool of Bethesda-John v. 7. She said that there were two foes to the well being of God's fair creation, ignorance and disease. We are fellow-labourers with God for their extirpation. A French physician said he could put a stop to crime were he allowed to regulate the public diet. We were intended to have aU the happiness in thiB life, and to miss it was to bo ungrateful to God. Tho happiness and contentment which accompanied a healthy and well-dis- ciplined body were the chief elements of good temper, and good temper had well been called nine-tenths of Christianity, and sound health was nine-tenths of good temper. The total collection was £10. THE SERVICE OF SONG. The Children's Service of Song, which was to have been given in the Royal-park by the AVcst Melbourne Baptist Sunday-school chil- dren, did not take place in consequence of the threatening and tempestuous weather. It was, however, only postponed until next Sunday, when it will bo given in tho Royal park it the weather bo favourable, and if it be not it will be rendered in the West Melbourne Baptist church. I HEIDELBERG. At the Church of England the Rev. T. B. Garlick preached in the morning from Luke xix. 8, and in the evening from Mat. xxv. 35 to 40.

Finn, tho pastor, having to officiate at Lillydale. Collections for the hospitals are to be made at this church on October 5. At the Presbyterian Church the Rev. Duncan Fraser preached in the morning from Luke xvii. 17. Tlie amount of collection was about £2. The Rev. A. Glasson held no service, the letter from the Hospital Com- mittee having miscarried. Mr. Glasson, however, made arrangements for collections at Heidelberg, Eltham, Nillumbik, and Bulleen. HAWTHORN. At the Roman Catholic Chapel mass was celebrated by the Rev. Mr. Mulhall, of Rich- mond, who preached a forcible sermon on the duty of Charit)-. The amount of the collec- tion was not ascertained. At the Wesleyan Church the service was performed by the Rev. Henry Bath, of Richmond, who took for the text of his sermon 1st Corinthians xiiL 13-" And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three : but the greatest of these IB charity."

LUTHERAN CHURCH, EASTERN-HILL. The Rev. H. Herlitz took for his text Luke vii., 11-17, the gospel of the Sunday.
