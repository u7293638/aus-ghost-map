CARDINAL MORAN AND THE CD7ÃœR0E OF ENGLAND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-It is with no ordinary feelings of gratitude that the Cardinal should look, upon those who have replied to his strictures upon the Church of England, for there is undoubted truth in the assertion that " to be for ever abusing people and institutions and never to provoke retort is one of the states of life that tend to untimely death " For my own part I am rejoiced to note that so many earnest members of the Church will not permit the Cardinal unchal- lenged to make such unprovoked assaults, but are both able and willing to stand forward in her defence During my absence from the colony no less than three valuable and instructive letters have appeared in your columns completely dispelling the cloud of words by means of which his Eminence endeavoured to obscure and thus avoid replying to the main points in my letter I fully reciprocate the " kindly feeling " which he says has prompted his reply, which is all the more satisfactory as upwards of twenty letters have passed between us (that Cardinal hardly does justice to himself in using the term " few letters," especially as some of them were not remarkable for brevity) J but that is no reason why friendly feelings should cease to exist The Cardinal, however, at once proceeds to take up another DOaition, out of charitable consideration " for me, viz that of teacher, and this, whilst I still retain the friendly feelings, I can by no means recognise unless that teaching is to be in the future what it has not been in the post based upon historical facts and not upon mere romance and conjecture, for I notice this applies to the Cardinal's recent illustration, taken evidently from the great Spanish romance, indicating that he has thoroughly imbibed its spirit, for, instead of adhering to the text of the original, he arms his knight with a " catapult " in order to attack the windmills In another part of the same romance we read, " Her name was Aldous Lorenzo, and he resolved to call her Dulcinea del Toboso, and this principle of romancing he applies with equal impartiality to his assertion regarding others, for he writes on December 22 in reference to my letter, ' He does not deal with any statements of mine, but discharges his catapult against some windmills of his own imagining " How far this is due to these romancing tendencies on the part of the Cardinal we shall quickly see In his address, published in your paper of December 19, he states that the Church of England derived its authority from Henry VIII, who " licensed the bishops to teach " How any one could calmly write such a table is not easy to understand no history of any kind gives the slightest authority for it. The Reforma- tion, as everyone knows who has given attention to the subject, was a movement 'hiefly within the Church which had been long in progress It was the final outcome of pi otests again and again made against the errors, superstitions, and usurpation of medieval Home, and was simply precipitated by the quarrel which arose between two inveterate foes of the Church of England, viz ; the Pope and Henry VIII Surely it must be the ghost of the wicked king, who appears to the Cardinal at particular times, especially when he is meditating about an attack upon the Church of England, and compels him to make statements which can only emanate from ghost land, for King Henry VIII had as much to do with founding the Church of England as the Popes of Rome had to do with the building of the ark The next point the Cardinal raised-I quote again from his address-was that the Anglican Church " had not preserved the truth as taught by the apostles" and in order to prove this he referred to certain unorthodox persons within the Church of England, and gravely assured his hearers that for this reason she had lost the right to apostolic authority for her teachings When I pointed out that there were certain Popes perhaps it would be more correct to describe them at that period Jas bishops of Rome-who were unquestionably unorthodox, I fully expected that he would seek to show that they were not so bad as authentic history represented them to be, not instead of doing this he proceeds to heap further abuse upon the Anglican Church, apparently quite forgetful of the fact that unless he can remain of the stigma of unorthodoxy attaching itself to certain bishops of Rome, the Church of Rome (if he is prepared to deal impartially with the question must come under exactly the same sweeping condemnation at his own hands as that which he would mete out to the Anglican Church only The whole of his argument, based upon individual unorthodoxy, is simply absurd The Bishop of Bristol was well ' within the mark when he wrote " We hold the Catholic faith, and where we differ from others who say that we do not hold it, we hold just what they do up to the right point We part from them exactly where they make it base, gross, contradictory ' Then there is another " windmill," and this, like its predecessors, is found in the Cardinal's address, viz that " the Anglican Church has from its very origin rejected the authority of St Peter " The Church of England fully recognises the authority of St Peter as an Apostle, na Church more clearly so, but she does not go beyond this When the Cardinal can give no absolute proof St Peter was sole Bishop [of Borne (Bishop Lightfoot says " I can- not find that any writers of the first two centuries and more speak of St. Peter as Bishop of Rome The language of St Irouous (in, J, J) is explicit He describes the Church of Rome as founded by the Apostles St Peter and St Paul, were appointed Linus Bishop"), and that he had special jurisdiction over the whole Apostolic Church there is no act or word of St Peter recorded in Holy Scripture showing that he ever exercised such jurisdiction and that St Peter had, in addition, power to transmit this to those who claim to be his particular successors (I have purposely omitted all preliminary stages) then it will be time enough to consider the Roman claims, but until the Cardinal has performed what appears to me an impossible feat, we utterly and entirely reject all authority of the Pops proceeding from the so-called chair of St. Peter The very expression from St Matthew, even if we were prepared to accept it in the sense he attaches to it, yet falls short of the actual Papal requirements in one essential particular, for the " profession of faith" enforced by the bull of Pius IV in 1564 pledges the person who makes that profession never to take or interpret Scripture otherwise than according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers and yet " there is not a text in the whole of the New Testament upon which the opinion of the Fathers is so divided " Thus, according to strict Roman requirements, it is of no real value to the Cardinal a claim I recollect some years ago a friend of my own making the following statement of the Roman claims and their results, which, as it has not before appeared in print, may interest some of your readers " The Roman Pontiff is the solo For she is the bishop of all the world, other bishops have only districts in his diocese they derive their authority by commission from him " With this Canon Bright is in accord for he says as the result of his own examination of the subject the Pope is " practically a universal bishop, holding direct power in and over every single diocese, so that the various dioceses are no more than his vicars and commissaries " We may, therefore, accept this as a fair statement which was thus worked out: "These Bishops claim to be the successors of the original Twelve The Pope is the successor of St Peters If this be so St Peter was the solo apostle the others were deputies of hup, derived their authority from him, and acted under commissions from him Grant this then the Papal position is intelligible and logically sound But if otherwise, the Pupal position claims more for St Peter's successor than is admitted for St Peter, and that difference is not merely in degree, but no kind " It would seem requisite to show how St Peter's successor could have more spiritual power that St. Peter " But my object in writing is not defiance, but defence, and hence I say no more on this interesting subject The Cardinal has, in no measured terms, attacked the Church of England I trust he has done so for the last time, since even his concluding remark loses all its point when carefully considered His words are The Church of England cannot pretend to have even the remotest claim to be the one true Church of our blessed Lord " Here the Cardinal has once more got into the region of romance and imagination The Church of England makes no such claim If she did she would be as presumptuous as the Church of Rome But she does claim, and rightly so, to be a true branch and a pure branch of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, built " upon the foundation of the Apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being The head corner stone, and never has there been a time in her history when she has ceased to profess that faith which is the Catholic faith, or to be guided and governed by those Sacraments which are the Catholic Sacraments The promise was given to her as part of the Catholic Church, " So I am with you al way " That promise she has never forfeited, and by God's good help she never will Possibly by this time some, at any rate, among your numerous readers will have come to the conclusion that the Bishop of Bathurst has not been assaulting " windmills of his own imaging " with a " catapult," but even may consider that the Cardinal has been trying conclusions, " couching his lance" with real and veritable windmills, with the result so graphically described in the same Spanish romance from which he drew his original illustra- tion It is in all kindly feeling " and with the utmost " charitable consideration " that I had the to him in connection with his Advent address and letter, only recalling for his careful consideration the words of the faithful squire (having also in view previous controversies), ? Did I not tell you they were windmills, and that nobody could think otherwise unless he had windmills in his head s " Bishop's Court I am, etc CHARLES E. BATHURST. . January 14.
