Flotsam and Jetsam. That Wondrous Elixir. F.H. CURTIS in N.Y. Sun. The years of her life numbered four score and ten, Her memory long ago failed her. Her health was so feeble that medical men Could not guess what the thing was that ailed her. She was blind aa a bat, as deaf aa a post, And everything seemed to confuse her, We daily expected she'd give up the ghost, And yet we all dreaded to lose her. A short time ago, as a dernier ressort, In hopes that it somehow might fix her, We gave her in moderate doses a quart Of Dr. Brown-Sequard's elixir. It acted like magic; much younger ahe grew, Her hair showed no silvery shade in, And then in the course of a fortnight or two, She changed to a charming young m iiden. Yet still the elixir continued to act, To childhood we saw her returning, And fiction was not half so wondrous as fact, For dolls sho was found to be yearnin?. Sho shortly became her greatrgrandchildren'a pride, With pWythings and innocent prattle, TJntil as a baby of ninety she died. Choked to death having swallowed her ratll'!.
