' ' ... *I don'fc believe in them,' tiie yonrig .maiftie plied. ? -?. -'? ' The ojd men of Suinmerdnlo shook their headV. and looked at each other, and then looked ;afc Frank, not reproachfully, but with a feeling 'of pHy for his ignorance. ' ? ? A 'm- ; ?Brought up in a large city, perhap6,':*aid-Jttr., Evans, ? where you have so much ;to do with the realities of life, that you have not time to.think of omens which are noticed by us '.quiet -country^ people?' ? .j. ' I have been brought up in a large city, . 6^d Frank, ' and am not superstitious ; ^jutjl can're spect the feelings and opinions pf' those -who are older than myself, and who have more leisure to notice the manifestations of coming -events, .which nature may make, for aught I know, ana.parncu-. larly in quiet old places like this, which seem al most to belong to a past oge.' ? ? ? 'ton think, then, that intelligencdV.of disaster and death is sometimes coimnunieatea to man by means altogether unexplainable by ordinary human rules Y inquired Mr. Evans. ' ' I think of course with Horatio,' said Fras'k, *that there is more in heaven and earth than oi-u?. philosophy dreams of ; I think that between tw. o souls bound together by some strong tie of lovt ? there may be an intensity of sympathy, almost electrical, which, at the moment of dissolution, may be sufficiently active to communicate to the living one the awful message of death.' Frank spoke so fluently and so well that the old men were astonished. They had not heard ? any one speak better, except the parson, and a lecturer who, some years ago, had found his way to the platform in the old school- house. The theme which was thus started, on that cold December night, before the warm tavern fire, was intensely interesting to the company, and soon entered the ghost-story phase. There had been many ghosts in Suinmerdale ; and even Mr. Evans conf eased to having thought he had once seen one in an Australian cainp, at_ the diggings, but ho wished it to be; distinctly understood that lie proved it to be mere imagination. The landlady* was a firm believer in hobgoblins of all'sorts, and the ghost which had been seen at various times 'in Bummerdalc had been identified beyond all doubt r-r contradiction. It was late when the company buttoned'up their coats, lighted their lanterns, and went to their adjacent homes. They all' shook haiads with Frank, notwithstanding his disbelief in Uieir par ticular illustration of liis vague theory; and Mr. Evans, who looked at him frequently, as ft trying to remember where he had seen the face before, said, ' I am very glad to have met you, sir:; and I hope you will promise not to leave Summerdale without seeing me again.' ' -* -' Thank you,' said ? Frank, taking the - hand which -n-as so heartily offered to In'm^ ?You have helped us to spend a longpnight pleasantly — nights are long at SumuierdaliSi' So the father and son parted, mutually ignorant 6f their relationship, yet mutually interested in each other, and both feeling desirous to meet again; and they met, on the morrow. . The next morning Frank presented himself at Oak House. He -was shown into the library. Mr. Uttassey and'his wife were both there. The husband was lolling in au easy-chair with a book, and the ?wife rose (as Fraaik. entered) ironi an ottoman close by his feet. i After some few complimentary inquiries, Frank said : ' I received your letter 'safely, and beg to thank you very much, for it.* .. Paul watched Frank, with a -wondering look. 'Yes,' said Mrs. Massey, 'we. thought it our dnity to write to you, as soon as... we were s&tisfled.;' ? ' ? .? 1 'I had the news»two days before,' said Frank, please read that.* ' . ' ' '?

Hues, returned it to Mb adfp vKth a sigh.and aisk'ed her to read it— he ..was not equal to the task. Sirs.

' I begin to b'elieve-it,' said Frank sadly. * If we hod. only, come to Summerdale to aid in tiniting 'again these poor bruised hearts,' said Mrs. Mfcssey to her husband, ' wejghould have no cause to regret Denby.' ' ' Baul jras about to reply,, when ;Kate came into the room ; and then suddenly appearing about to withdraw, Mrs. Massey said:1' 'Come in, n ly dear — come in, This is my daughter, Ijlr.
