' ''. ;.'J:. In a( neatly f urnished;cpttage in 'a'quiet ! side street;' a little' life; was' slowly, passing-/ away. A night lamp' still burned ' in the : darkened room, 'and: by it's ' subdued^ light the outlinesof '. a tiny form|'.sl;retcned at j length in its narrow'- bed,- were' -easily ''' discernable. Poor babe, .only two years have passed since her parents thanked God for their firstborn, since their hearts were stirred with a new born joy, as they gazed into the sweet unconscious face. And now the father hastening on his way, was torturing himself with the dread thought that his little one, his precious babe, bo weak tha nichfc befnre. wnnlil have fled to the shadowy land! ere he could breathe forth his love and his blessing above her as she lay. With a breaking-heart he had penned paragraphs of fun and sarcasm, with deep drawn sighs ground out jokes, and in vented conundrums, for the world must laugh, the paper's popularity must be maintained. So he had written on hour after hour, and in his grief and despair composed more drolleries than usual. The ghastlinoas of his work only impart ing a tinge, perhaps, of, bitterness to his sarcasm, a greater force to his ebullitions of humour, and thus it came about that his readers pronounced the columns to be unusually good. . i . ?,. , Softly he opened the- cottage door, more softly still he stole on tiptoe to the darkened room. All was still there, and for. a moment his breath quickened as he turned his questioning gaze in the direc tion of the little bed. Somebody rose from the shadow of the curtains and came towards him. It was the nurse, and she whispered that the dear baby still lived, but was ' terrible low. ' It's poor mother was lying, down for a little, but she.. had promised .to; call her! should any- change . take place. , : .,?-?./. The father leaned over his dyingrohild and looked ;yearingly! f or rsomo- 'sign of I ? ' ? ? s :?;-:. so.'.. '.:'?..????'-.'] recognition, but baby did not stir. Lovingly he gazed upon the tiny wasted features, the anguish of hia stricken soul filling hi3 eyes with a pathos beyond des cription. /- i \ ..-:.??? .-??. -? Oh !, My/Gpd; ! My God ! ' l.o mur mured, ci aucha little while isuch a little while with us ! Must You take her now V The sound of his voice perhaps, low as it was, . roached the little sufferer's ear. She moved slightly, and a faint sigh left tho parted lips. Eagerly he watched her, and presently the blue veined lids lifted, and baby's eyes no longer dull and languid, looked brightly into her father's face. 'Baby, darling, don't you know Dada ?' he asked gently. She held out her painfully fragile looking arms, and oh ! how longingly he bent hia head for that precious embrace. They touched hia neck, and then fell limp and nerveless by her side. Then a faint smile passed over baby's face ; ' dada,' she faltered, ' baby sho seepy.' An exquisite calm. fell upon the wax-like little form, a heavenly peace whioh smoothed away all lines of pain, and set its sacred seal thereon. .Baby was at rest. Few perhaps, but those who have Buffered a like sorrow, can quite realise the desolation of that little home, can perfectly comprehend the ' terrible void in me lives or Warner ana ma wite, when their little 'one was taken from them. Spring lost Itself in the richer, fuller beauty of summer, flowers gave, place to fruits, and the festive, sea- - soh' 'in- connection -with- our Saviour's natal day. was rapidly approaching, when. Warner, sad and weary after a hard day's work in his office, sat by -his fireside, his face buried in his hands. He often, sat HK6 tnat tnen .w.nen alone. tie was thinking of the mockeries in life,; .of the tragedy of breaking hearts, of the many' who in;their firsfTgrief at the loss of those most/dear, were: 'compelled to carry on the -burden of life just the ? same^-to attend office, shop, or factory^ mix with ! their fellow creatures, attend to business : aa closely as. when with haarf, and hrnin unfettered with care; ; they, waited .on irritable customers,, listened to the length ened rigmaroloa of r. prosy clients, or patiently -, groped their r way through the' blotted, badly punctuated, wordy com munications of : illiterate correspondents.

Advancing to the editor, he wrung-his'-hand'^with a few kindly words of sympathy, and passed on. Unnoticed by the grief stricken' mun, Warner noted the working features, the broken sentence^ expressive of gratitude, the usually keen eyes, now filmy with unBhed tears. And they thought this man possessed np heart. Oh,the cruelin justice of it all ! Involuntarily he clenched hia.fist, bb he mentally rehearsed the scene. As he did so, there was a slight sound behind him, the soft ruBtle of a dress, and two loving ?:. arms' stole round his neck. ? 'Ned dear, 'whispered his' wife, for it was she, ' try not to grieve quite so much.

': ?'?'. ;v Warner told her of what he was think' ing, and her eyes dimmed as she listened, but when he had finished/ she soothed and comforted him as she alone could, Bkilfully seasoning her caresses witt sage advice regarding the present, and hopeful anticipations for the future. Later on they occupied themaelveB with books :byr. 'the. fireside, as was their wont when , , : alpne.; .--, Despite ? the . advanced .BeMon. ;:*?»!? night ,was, icpld'' and , windy. %e^]nowIandJithen,a violent gust .would rattle rtho windows,^ and: . 'oar ; ?, in the chimney, and Mrs Warner shivered as she mended the fire. Suddenly they were startled ns they, read, by a peal from the door bell, fol lowed by a low growl of thunder. - ; ' Who can it be ?'-W»rner said, hasten ing to open tho door. When he did bo, there was no one to be seen, and feeling apprehensive of mischief, he speedily adjusted the chain, thereby preventing the door being opened more than a few inches. But no one essayed to force an entrance, and somewhat puzzled, he was aoout to slip the bolt, and return to hiB book, when a faint wailing sound, some thing between the distant howl of a dog, «nd the cry of a sick child, struck his ear. He listened attentively, and the wail was repeated. It seemed to come from the region of his feet. He opened the door again, and peered cautiously out. A stray gleam from a neighbouring lamp fell upon a little bundle which lay on his door step. From this little bundle came the curioua cry he had heard. He raised it in his arms, and at the move ment, the poor little occupant burst into a loud declaration of infantile woes. He carried it into the sitting room, where upon the little stranger no longer wept, but regarded the bright light with blink ing eyes of wonder and surprise. ?,.

'A stone's throw from where their cottage Btood, was a large house, the property of a widower, said to bo in affluent circumstances,, who was in the habit of making periodical visits to a warmer climate in the month ot April, winter. Being of a somewhat eccentric nature, he had through some trifling disagreement, dismissed the old couple, who had hitherto acted bb faithful and efficient caretakers of his property during his absence, and in an equally illogical manner, engaged a strange man and woman, accepting as references the recommendation of someone entirely un known to bim. About two months sub sequent to the departure of the widower. it came to pass that strange atorlea were set afloat in the city respecting his mansion.

Early next morning he rose.and rellinir Mrs Warner he would be back to break fast, set out for the police station. When he returned from thence the plan of pro ceeding was fully arranged. That night he and three officers of the law would take up their station in the garden as near the house. aa was possible, to be free from observation. His companions would call for him at half-past nine. In order to save his wife anxiety, he would plead business at the office as a reason for hia enforced absence.
