"i fortnight ago I was at Brags* Before starting I had left Gipser. at ur uncle's house in Regent's Park, and it seemed that during my absence thcdog had been ia the habit of ruitmg Hamp- stead once a week, where he spent most of the day sitting on the doorstep of ,«ny shut-up atudio ; he always turned upsgsîn at night a little dejected and very hungry. The night before I w|nrbed from Bruges, so my uncle told me after-. warda, the dog had escaped from'the stable-yard and presumably gone on his usual detective errand to the studio. This time he did not come back. A week went by, but Gipsey never returned.. 1 visited the sarrounding police- stations, and paid a couple visits to the Dogs4* Home at Battersea, but no Gipsey , ever greeted me ; lost, stolen, or killed, I gave. him np., ! .* liste one dark night, as I was enter- ing my door, something brushedTiurriedly past, and {then tornea, on me--a étrange gaunt dog, that I at ones kicked out of the place aud cl-»Sc*d to the door upeii thenjl heard à whine.

Somehow I did not fool at all sleepy ; there wa« a watery moon straggling through drifting chotis, sometimos miking tivug* dimly visible, sometimes plunging all in mirzy black- ness. At the foot of the bel was this great picture of Vauijyck's. lu a few minutes I became, conscious that there was a tiny light gleaming qu the canvas soménighlight où the armour, I imagined : ànd Ï thought; «Well, if that fellow Yandyek could paint bis high lights like that, there was not much chance for modern men to ever beat him.* Then all at once the moon wis hidden behind a blacker veil than' usual and the. room became quito dark. I then experienced a mos}; unpleasant senstion. The ligut in ¡the picture had not moved.. At the same Hms my hand, which' lay outside jibs geriet, was touched ljy something clammy and cold. *' For one brief moment I was horror struck, and then-what do you think P well, I knew what it was-the doga nose'*? * "Issy, Paul, excuse sse interrupting you, but I want to ask if-" But' my friend waved aside the interruption, and continued : "Putting my hand outside the coverlet again, I found Gipsey with his forepaws resting on the bed and trembling violently. I patted him and soothed him, but how can I explain to you that I had au instinc- tive feeling that there was something in the room beside our two selves, an unseen presence by the great picture-you know it was quite dose to me just at the foot of t he bed-and there as 1 gased was the; Strange little light grown brighter, actually fluttering into a blue plume of name; and as I still looked it grew longer and lighter, and I give yon my word ot honour. George, that there waa a hand .holding it-a long delicate hand, the innot of which seemed merged ia the«sritos«o<tbe papi^r Instared ia a fsaciaating way, waiting, T sup pose, for what might happen next; all thia time I had my .liana on the dog's collar, then I attempted to lift him on the bed,aadcuriously enough I could not; strangest of all the animal seemed to be making strenuous efforts to get nearer to me. It was horrible to tuink I was «outending with some force that chained Gipse/ to the floor; anyway, I was obliged to desist, and when ( took my hand away it .seemed as if he slunk under the bed, though it sounded as if he was mouing ronud the roora-so much so that at last I angrily called out "lie down," after which be was quiet. .'Then I saw the baud was fading, the light grew gradually les« tilt nothiug wa« left, and the grey blackness filled the room again. For a whole hour I lay speculating on that mysterious light, half believing, half in doubt, till I fell asleep again; for when I awoke the sun W'at ehining brightly and the servaut knocking at the door. I got up at once intending to seud tim dog down. I called and whistled when there-oh. George-all lying huddled up in the farthest corner of the room lay my poor dbg dead-dead, aud stiff sud staring, with a horrified look in his faithful eyes, and hie tongue black and bitten through. j "The coachman came upstairs and bathed Gipse/ with warra water, but what was the ase? My Uncle Stewart came, and after breakfast I told him my strange experience of tbs night. He went rather pale, I thought, and finally asked me not to tell bis wife, as be said there was some idle legend in the Stuart family, and it might upset her. He bas bad the picture taken down and the roora searched and locked up. "That ia my story of tho#ho»t and tho dog, and it all happened yesterday.

Then prefacing my extract with a few explanatory^aiuark*, I read tabfollowing : f TiieKufg tUst night lay nt Oiford with hts courtiers abon^ hun, bis body, guard and pages in1 the aute chamber, 'wjien towards, the middle b£ the night there cornea fnrions ringing sud a calling which awoke his secretary, !Mr. Ashburn- ham, ^Juid^m page, who forthwith east themtelirSf late thé chamber.

In the morning before they took horse for York it was found in tbs king's room a dead dog lay which iras considered, an omen by some. \ Wea I had finish^ Western naked to see 'the book, 'ana! perused the tole himself. " That," he said, decisively, aUnded to: I never beard ot it before." f^Wall do ysu think there ls anything In ur "What eau I say? Are there not strange instincts, strange presentiments and warnings in this world of ours to tbOM that heed them. Is it not a strange commence that my cousin Charlie Stuart gave me that deiid dog'before he joined the regiment in India r Now I under- stand my uncle's uneasiness lest I should tell the story to the mother who idolises bim. Do you remember reading in one of the London papers some few years ago, when the question of ghostly warnings was mooted, the story of a Scotch family to wham a black dog always appeared when death threatened a member of the family, or the more famous legend of the 'drummer^ tattoo^ and h»W a lady, a, stranger 'newly, arrived iat the casUe, nftnHoûed to the' hostess lt dinner the étrange music she had heard playing beneath her window as she dressed, the consternation of those guests that knew the family legend, the swooning of the hostess, ettfith^ tidings of aeon's death in a foreign landP I believe there are warninga to those that heed them, in how eveVatftaugeagô^ be, brought to us," and then Paul Western got up, and after lighting his pipe, sailed out into tbs night, and I was left alone iu my chambers, round which of a night the rats raced, and tbs faces of dead men looked at me from the walls, for I could not all at once direst myself of th« story I had heard when my eyes fell on the pictured por- traits with which my room was filled.
