Puritan! was treated with delicacy b y th e wood instruments, the clarionets playing the difficult passages with clearnOsB, whilst the cornet and horn duet was well phrased. “ Tbe Dreigesprach” fot clarionettea was the piece de retisUtnu of the evening. ’ L ast night the clariouotista opened nervously, b n t wanned to their difficult undertaking with p erfect. ease, and special mention must be made of the rondo movement, which was dexterously manipulated.

Picrcey, the newly-appointed minister, yesterday morning, took for bis subject “ The Christian’s Bank,” and in a very clear and convincing manner proved from Genesis xv., 1 , th at th e Christian’s interest was- best seryed by a complete surrender to God and by an acceptance of the gift of the Holy Ghost. I n uie evening tee church was comfortably filled, and Mr Piercey preached a practical sermon from tbe words found in Jerem iah vi., 10, 17\. Ho said the memories of the past would cause ns-to turn to Jehovah with grateful h e a rtq a o r in gazing down upon the dark and tranDlouB scene of human history the everlasting God seems to contemplate man as standing in the midst of a vast labyrinth surrounded by a maze of p erplexing paths—for it is true, to a certain extent, tb at sin is an error as well as offence against God—and m an from a very oarly age may be said to have lost his way, but God calls him to stand and enquire and ask fdr the good old way. God is more interested in ottr £>olitical, m oral, and spiritual welfare thflM ~&ny; representative ever appointed by man. God calls us to enquire and use our powers of observation, to make our investigation conscientiously t we were not to compare one m an with another; we we nbt to begin tp ^allm g the Gospel a lie and no reality, it was wrong and dishonest to act like that. B ut begin with an honest heart andaskoorselves does the religion of God make men worse or better P And if they fonnd th at it leaves men practically and to all intents ii same condition, then reject it. If the Gospel of Christ was not the power of God unto salvation, then let os h ave done with it and go back to the philosophy of Socrates. Either the Gospel is a power •lseadeception. God calls us to stand in this age of deception and enquire. But tru th will prevail, and though men are not all they profess, yet Christianity stands the same mighty power of God.
