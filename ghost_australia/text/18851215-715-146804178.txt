Erew. and French, Guatav Altraann was charged; on the information, of John McNamee with, having assaulted his son Owen. The information was. dismissed as the evi dence. was very contradictory-. Samuel Henry Hill, an habitual drunkard, was fined 5s for drunkenness. j . As I announced in your last issue per telegram^ our erickefora. made a very respectable draw wifchthe Wanr. d«rers. In their second innings our fednwa. batted in a remarkable, manner, and it vu a great treat to see them, put on. the wood. Geo. Alexander and T; C. Ellis, were the drat ta. ga in, and after putting 19 together forgoed. Btyle,. George retired. Allan Lawson then partnered T.. C., and runs. cam.e almost as. freely as before.. Aft*? adding 16. to, the total in good form the. padthaway trundler was hoisted with his own petard, as Young clean bowled him with, a grubber. H. Wilson took hia place, and he. and T. C.. made a deter mined stand. Both played the bowling with ease, although Ellis was hardly at home with Young's underhand. At 99 Ellis put his fog where his. hat should have been, and had to retire! He was two hours at the wickets and made 36 in his old form. Lister joined Wilson and a long stand was made. The Wanderers were now on their beam ends as the situation, was. becoming serious. The number of runs required to avert a one mningsdefeathand been wiped off, and a considerably balance was in band, Ail their bowlers were | put on, but mns came freely, and at last Mann dismissed'lias ter for a well played 27- , Wilson was now firmly - set, and had-Apparently taken a lease of the wicket. PhflUps replaced the last player, but only put op nine, JJ, I<avrson took his place agd added 14 funs in goad form, when, he retired in favor of Stick. A change camAo'efXhe scene as Stick joined -Wilson. The former went in to door-die,.and(ft only fair to say toaotpe tone. Ife at ogee set to work, and puniBhed the bowling unmercifully, seoring threes and fours with, wonderful rapidity.. J-U '3B minutes, he had Pit on dO. rftps, andi fieldmgoftbe ^and.eres/was getn ting loose: in consequence, Wilwn'A timebadcanie/andhe retired, caught, after ajddjng^ 59a without giying the. ghost of- a, chance.
