THE PRINCESS OF WALES AND THE GHOST. Mr Jo quin Miller, tho American poe^, when on a n cent vibil to Newetad Abbey was curious about the famous ghost in tho tower — tl e appari tion ' ia cowls and sandals' whom Byron grave y claimed to have seen a short time befoie his ill i-tar red marriage. .So, it appeals, are m st pil griu s to this ' home and haunt' of an J£ng ish po t— tbe Princess of Wales not excepted. Mrs. Webb, wife of Colonel Webb, fcr e present pro prietor of the Ibbey, is Mr. Millei's authority for ihe ' cimic little incidait' which bepell the Princess on the occasion of her icsent visit. The three rooms in the tower — in which, by the way, Mr. Miller ccntuved to pass a night, without, however, seeing anything supernatural — arc reached by ascending a narrow Bpiral stairjase, and have no other ingress or egres-=. It happened that two servant maids were ia the e rooms when the Princeps, at the head of her par;y, ascended, and laughiog at the idea of meeting a ghost, entered unheralded. Passing through the dress ing-room, and tl en the spacious bedroom, fur nished as far as possible with the appointments used by the poet, she passed on to the page's room and here 6he poked her parasol into a deep, dark, our&ained; alcove, spying to the party pressing af te r her, 'But 1 want to see the ghost ' Horro) a ! the point of her parasol struck a s 'lid. body. There was a screech and a scream, and the Prin cess sank into the arms of the Piince of Wilee, while a pretty rosy maid fell forward before the Prince s, piteonsly begging her pardon.
