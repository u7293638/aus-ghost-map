Ad be said, be dare J give no serious warning. A nervous patient might Üe~a'i very-well,- but no governess would, stay with a live lunat-c loose about the house. F o "Dr.-Ho'.ford was- fain to let- mattera- lake -their. d îarae, trnstiag to the chapter of accidents, and to Misa 8mart's good sense to set her right in time. After dil; he thought, there could be no gréât risk.

What, did ensue we . «hill presently Fee. A? day or two. after, his codversition with ;\Ir. Bailey, the docter happened to look out from bi3 surgery window' on the little plot of ground'at the bick of hù house, which he was [leased to dignify wi h the name of a garden. Dr. Holford worked in it a good deal himself, .and took great interest io the one or two flower bed?, and the border rich with , bright colours, in tho arrangement of which he fla te red hhn. self MC Joseph Paxton could not hold a candle, '0 himl ;Tha air waa scented with * the* breath ot lilaos and hyacinth?, and the; perfume of t wo gnarled, old hawthorns. coverad, one wi h whi'e,. and'tbe other' with pink b'ossom, tba' stood oh the'grass plot .by the side ol the path, and that' were the pride pf the doctor's hear'. That ¿arden ,was a kingdom , for bees and but erfiies, and ¡hey hummed and danced metrily in the sunshine.' On thia peculiar May afternon, a fresh l'ttle human flower moved quickly to and fro among the .butterflies, clad ja a soft-grey, staff gown,'with pink rib'ons at the throat and wrist. It was the young governess, ' Lizzie Stuart. , She ivas'a pretty t»irl bf about twenty,'-with large grey .eyes and fair shmy' hàir.'. Á sprig of pink may was.st.ucb, in; .¡tbe waistband that girded, 'a 'Small' iróuod waist, and they were ver j lit,ije feet that tapped, impst.iently upon the gravel walk. The doctor , 'could not help wa ching her: from the window as* he .smoked ;h!B pipe; she made such a pretty foreground; to bis favourite, flowers as she I went and came under the hawthorns. Presently a young man came oat and walked across the g'ajf-p'ot .toward» her. She .met him with an outstretched ' hand, and. they 'strolled along trie path' 'together.
