In a secluded eonscr near tno ssove appeased tneiounge-oea which hia partner had mat vacated. A simi-; lar lair in the opposite corner invited the I. doctor's weary bones after a thirty-mile jolt across the sweep of prairie wind. j "It argues well lor our decency that we ! retain a little bit of it when we bunk about BO like dogy, don't it E tieh ?" ha observed with a laugh, using a vdlago diminutive for Horatio which Hamlot in all his musinga never hit upon. You're just back from thorn flesh-pots of luxury the preacher tnlka about," responded the druggiat " You'd turn up your nose now on oyskra cooked in tho can and e't out of the white mortar." "No, I wouldn't," declared Bcotherton, promptly. " So if you've got some in the digging and want a single bite yourself, put on two cans to simmer."' " Now, listen to that for extravagance," observed the partner, tekiug up the candle and going forward in the store. Then ha knocked sawdust from a tin oblong, cut the top open with his pocket-knife, and reached behind tho ipecac jar for a bundle of crackers. The crackers he brought and spread open for Brotherton to munch at, while the can of oysters thawed and thun began to leak and sputter upon the stove. " Pepper and salt and a hank of butter right up there in the -white mortar," he suggested. Brotherton himself lifted the white mortar down and blew a lifctla dust off its rim. " Don't be so particular," urged SecrisS. " I thought it might ba tartar emetic," explained the docsor. " Bus you're too good a housekeeper to serve mo that way, Secrist. Just as I come back, too." "Well, now, Doc., tell the truth," urged the fat man, stretching himself in a chair at the other side oi the stove and glimmering at hia friend through half shut eyes. " When you oome back from civil-i-z&tion; to a godforsaken plaoa like tbia, don't you think you're making a fool of yourself ?" " No, I don't," rejoined Brotherton. He was sitting on the counter beside his garments, and his long, strong legs dangled well toward the floor. " This is experience* I like experience, and I don't like banging by the eyelids. A man can be hardening himself here while he would collapse to nothing waiting for practice in a city. It ia'nfc such a god-forsaken place, either," " A row down at Peg.leg's whisky shop every Saturday night. Mud and alush up to your eyes in winter. Ague all fall." " That suits me," said' Brotherton. Sacrist sneered on: " Preaching only once a month in the echool-houso at early e,n,ndle- lighting." " There isn't a Christian in town that bears that privation better than you do," laughed the doctor. " O, I ain't eayiog the ruffianly gang in this neighborhood ifin'E good enough for me," chuckled t'na druardstli I'm only wondering how a fallow 1 c a iijap can stand it." "What's ho , ow?"

" You're not goiug to hunk down without tolling ma all the ne ws ? " " No, 5 ' said the mt man, slowly. " What news c^»uld wa scare up, do you reckon, though, in ihe two weeks you've been gone?" "But yoa were gnashing about ruffianly gangs. There haven't been any horse thieves through ? " Secret uttered a negative grunt, sitting on *he side of his couch. " I was only thinking oi old Hiram Dixon." " No one has killed him 1" " No, responded Secrist, with a dissatisfied 0nuffle. " I know it's yon? silent, ceaseless petition that somebody will kill him," chuckled the doctor, dipping up his oysters from the white mostar with a broken-handled pswier spoon.

And by the tirno that boy is 21 yoart! old, if Hiram Dixon barn's the rest of Stirling'^ property beaidea wbti'a diaappeared wlieu Stirling died, then I ain't acquainted with Hiram Dixon. It'a most all in land, and easy to trustee out of the hands of a minor heir. I'll go up with you, Doe." " No, you go to bed and sleep," replied the doctor, who having muffled himself, v/as changing medicinea m his pill bags for others on the shelves. " I' 11 go «P with you," said the fat man, bringing forth his own garments. 4 1 You'll have a tussle with old Hiram. If he's dug her B^ve and she isn't dead he'll bury her anybow." The wind blew ou| of the north like mobile and invisible ice. Sicrist tied hia red woollen comforter in sa other Is not under his chin. Before some ho deed I»y a narrow, frosty board as causeway, and actosa this they walked singly to avoid the rough, frozen mud. A hut of logs, opening by a h»ich-!.4sing, and a weather-bo&ided; domiedo, with tho door at the rear, were clone r.eighfcoars. 1'bere were two or throe brick housed ci some pretensions, inclosed by paling*, and a barred acd silent general store, which in daylight divided patronage with one feis other end of the village. Oa riainr,, ground stood the tavern; a halting place where the traveller might brsce himself for the bleak rida aorthward. How many a cutting day had Brotherton taken to that narrow road in his jumper, hia horse breaking an unstirred ocean oi enow. Then, however, ha carried cosy, warm thoughts within his wraps and furs, whioh kept him exhilarated. To- night the north isoad was the bleakest fesfsok he had ever seen. Wanderers on the prairie would bo sure so perish; or, should they escape, what comfort could they find in to-morrow, anyhow ? Opposite the tavern, across a small ravine, and upon a hill stood the largest house in ths town. A road curved around it and crawled down into the dark woods. It was, however, the meanest looking bouse in the town, its size only emphasizing its dilapidation. Ths hoar frost tried vainly to ornament with silver plating certain ancient garments bulging through broken panes, ths crazy ashe rattled, and loose, unplan ted weather-boarding clapped retponsively. Secrist and the doctor, waiting for admission before steps on which they dare not stand both &i; oneo, heard the wiod howling through this hollow rmmeion as if its vacant chambers were built only for that purpose. Brotherton's chief wish bad been to take Ruby out of this placa into a home of hia own making. She, was etili so much a little girl that he neves realized her widowhood on her maturity. Her child seemed a young brother whom he would adopt for love of her, It forever puzzled him that a creature like Ruby, DEiiuraby refined and alive to everything beautiful, should be cast ia her lot and bound to the people who held ber. The heredity which gave dark-eyed daughters with childish hands and feet and living souls to Mrs. Dixon'a like could not be accounted for by mec1ie ;i! Beienc?. Mrs. Dixon was still afoot and lot the young men into hor unfurnished hall. Naked stair-steps and gaunt bannisters, against which their shadows were thrown by the moon, seemed to welcome them as congenial ghosts. Oae discouraged candle burned in the square room where roost of the living was done, and where dyieg was to be ccnsummated ; for there in the corner efcood the marble-like oblong oi sheets sketched ever the tops of chairs, concealing what was held henesth them upon the cooling board. Nop by, also upheld by two chairs, waited a black coffin, bulging near the head, but narrowing towards the foot. A strong shudder darted through the doctor at this eight, which muss have been eu common to him. Two other women vvesa watching with Baby. One of them, the landlady of tho tavern, came forward to meet her two boarders, and shook hands with tho doctor. She waa capable and portly, talked in a hoarse whisper. Being ths dead girl's Aunt Hnby Asm, she was there to command. Mrs. Dixon eat down in a remote corner with her gun-bonnet over her eyes. She was a very thin creature, having calico garments ! whieh hung upon he-r. The contemporary world seldom caught fcer features on account of this immovab's sunbonaet, and it was believed she would die wUbous Raving over fully shown her lace. She was not deaf, yet when she made one of her scant remarks she shouted it, and people shouted to her in return. The major psrfc of her time was evidently spent in meditation, and Having Hiram Dixon for her second husband was deemed a sufficient excuse lor this.

" Aud I fenowed ycu couldn't tell n dcud woman from a live one." He came forward in his usual stooped and dtillcued posture, and Nate, with one arm around the doctor's neck, watched him fearfully.
