THE TEMPLE BUILT. OCTOBEE 26.—AFTERNOON. Reading, I Kings vi. 1-5. Golden Text—Isa. lvi. 7, NOTE—Teachers of junior classes will do well to make the Golden Text the starting point in their lesson and they may work out the following ideas :— I.—THE PLACE SET APABT FOB THE WOESNIP OF GOD IS CALLED THE HOUSE OF GOD. To do this, commence with their homes. The place where they and their parents live is called their house; so the place where God makes Himself known to man is called His house, whether the place is a building or not, Read Gen. xxviii. 17, and compare it with 2 Sam. vii. 7 and Isa. lvi. 7. II . THE USE TO WHICH THE HOUSE OF GOD SHOULD BE PUT. Seen in the words, " Mine house shall be called an bouse of prayer." That is the place where the worship of God is conducted, which worship consists of praise, singing hymns, suppUcations, offering up of prayer, and reading the Word of God. ILL—AS GOD'S HOUSE IS THE PLACE WHEBE GOD IS ESPECIALLY FOUND. It is the duty of all persons to assemble in it if they ar e not prevented by sickness. Apply this:—Children should not neglect the worship of God on the Sabbath, many do. This duty is taught in Scripture. Ps. lxv. and c.; also Isa. ii. 3. IY THE BEHAVIOUB PHOPEB FOB THE HOUSE OF GOD. Read the account of our Lord's rebuke to those who used the Temple for improper purposes. (Matt. xxi. 12), and apply the subject. All careless and rude acts, all •worldly and loose conversation are unbecoming. Children should enter and leave the House of God quietly and reverently, and while in it should try to keep their minds in the service. Refer to Solomon's advice in Eccl. v. I. Press home this important duty. Teachers of senior classes might take up the subject of the building of the Temple by Solomon, and work out the following points 1\. The Division of the building. Show plan, and compare with tabernacle in the wilderness; Holy of Holies ; where the Ark of Covenant. In this the High Priest 'alone was allowed to enter. This a type of Heaven, in which Christ, our Great High Priest, has entered. Holy place, where the ordinary priest performed the offices of religion. See Heb. ix. 2\. The Magnificence of the building. Read account and apply .—Nothing too good for the service of God. We should give of our best. 3\. The Typical Character of the Temple. John u. 21, and Heb. viii. 2. 4 The Church of Christ in her Members called the Temple of God, 1 Tim. iii. 15; Heb. x. 21; 1 Peter iv. 17. Y.—GENERAL APPLICATION. 1\. The House of God a sacred place, so all done there should be done with reverence. 2\. As the body of a believer is the Temple of God, care should be taken to keep it from defilement. Sinful words, impure thoughts, defile it. Hence all should pray for the presence of the Holy Ghost.
