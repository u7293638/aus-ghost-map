FASHIONED GENTLEMAN, ' An old-fashioned gentleman' — that's what they Baid ; ' Tbe last of bis race'— like a ghoBt from the dead He seemed to the many ; among tbem he passed In honcur — a gentleman boru, to tbe last ! It (tbb seen by tbe way that be carried hia head — By his dignified mien and hiB soldierly tread ; Bv hiB Bcorn of all offers of wealth and of fame — . By fcis robe— never Boiled in tbe shadows ot shime. ' An old-fashioned gentleman' — that's what they said— ' The last of his race' — like a ghost from the dead I 'An old-fashioned gpntleman I' . Woll for the ways Where we walk in these thorny and wearisome dayp, Tbat such nre beside np, with bouIb that are white | As they drift with tlie dreams down 'the VAlleys of Night. Tbey speak from the past; they aro true to the last; Like the oaks ef the forest they brave every blaBt ; The same in misfortune as in the bright gleam Of years tbat wero music and passed like a dream I 'An old-fashioned gentleman' — that's what tbey I said — 'The last of his race' — like a ghost from the dead;
