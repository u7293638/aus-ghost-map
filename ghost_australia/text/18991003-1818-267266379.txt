THE TRANSVAAL. The struggle in South Africa is a war of races. On the one side there is the desire of Biitain for a South African empire to comprise all South Africa. On the other side the Boers, despite their faults, are struggling ta maintain their independence. Since President Rruger offered the five years' franchise in a form to suit Eng- land if England would abandon her position of suzerain, the question has been one not? of the franchise but of the independence of the Transvaal England's might is arrayed against the Boer's righteous cause. All but the most prejudiced must admire the Boers who are determined to have liberty or risk death. The " S. M. Herald " draws a splendid picture of Kruger,—the valient, stubborn, lib erty-loving old Boer, going down to his grave perhaps with the country he lived and would die for. It would be a pathetic picture if the rough but kindly old Boer—if the Transvaal shall be defeated—goes forth, though too old to figbf, to take his last stand on the battle field for his country. Te him may be applied Emerson's beautiful lines :— Justive conquers evermore. Justice after as befuie. And he who battles on her side God, though he were ten times slum, Crowns him victor glorified, Victor over death and pain For ever. - Blooms the laurel which belongs To the valient chief who fiyhts ; I see the wreath, I'hear the songs LauJing the eternal rights. and, to alter Emerson's wordB slightly, Fate's grass grows rank on A trie's veld's, And raufcly oh the b^ood-red ground, Speak it fitmly : He's the God." "All are ghosts beside." F.H.S.
