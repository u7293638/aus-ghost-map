THE PRODUCE MAnKET8.-TtJiaDAT. I THE REDFERN SALES. At the Redfern Terminus market this morning 48 truck loads of forage were submitted to a moderate attendance of buyers Owing to the wet weather and the fact that among the retail men at least to-day was kept as a partial holiday, the sales dangered very much, especially at their termination As usual a commencement was made on the potatoes Those were, however, in short supply, the rain having interfered with carting, and only one truck load was disposed of The auctioneers then took ad- vantage) of the petrol time at their disposal to get rid of some of the "staff" tracks which they had left on their hands Chaff was plentiful and dull of sale, prime realising to 3s 11d per cwt Inferior quality was extremely quiet Oaten hay was again knocked down at a very low range of values Very little prime lucerne was available Straw continued dull, and prices low Other lines were unaltered Appended are the proportions of the various descriptions actually submitted at to-day's date -Chaff, 24 trucks, Oaten hay, in bundles 4, lucerne, derrick pressed, 4-m bales 3, straw, bundled wheaten, 5 derrick pressed, 3, muire, 1, potatoes, 2, and turnips, 2 The following were among the consignees -Messrs George Wells, 1 Bridge and To, Dent and Perry, Ellis and Co v Inglis and Son, and Brunker and Wolfe to-day the number of trucks manifested sms 48, which were apportioned as follows Chair, 10, hay and lucerne, 11 rat does, 0, strow, 8, and roRtze, 1 The above Supplies were disposed of on follows - Chair - Worn W iron;, Spring Hill (7080), 1s Od , Parris Culcairn (915), 6s 7d, C 6i herwood, Borneo (074) Si Bd, Robt Dunn (10-0) passed, (1812), 11s 1d ; W.

TRADE-IN «DBBllZ-BTBIST. The Inclement Tastier, coupled with the fact that the Darling Harbour station in cloud to-day, had the effect of curtailing the Simei-«t««t business beyond the ordinary limits of a quiet day. In no line was there any movement of importance, and so far the new month has not come up to expectations Opening, as it did, with a partial holiday, however, no accurate forecast can be taken as to the pi enable projects of the next few weeks. Agents and merchants continue hopeful that the present month will be a satisfactory one In feed grains a better feeling has already made itself manifest, but in other lines, such as chaff, hay, lucerne, straw, to, it is to be feared that no improvement can possibly take place nulli the supplies begin to show a more appreciable falling off. All the above-mentioned lines have been very plentiful locally, while the wharfs are stocked with a superabundance of Vi- terian chaff which cannot improve lying unmoved for weeks together in large stacks, as it has been now for some time. The 800 bales of New Zealand meadow hay which arrived by the Wakatipu has not yet been placed on the market, but the very fact that it may at any moment be offered cannot tend to strengthen an already dull market. Oats continued firm and unchanged. Maize ruled very firm at 3s 2d for prime dry samples. A lot of inferior grain is on the market, and is selling at correspond ing rates The general opinion seems to be that supplies from the Northern men will be short this week owing to the heavy weather. Bran was dull and unchanged, and pollard very seal co Onions continued firm. The potato market is still the only one in which anything likuabuovant tone prevails.

The Metropolitan Fruit Markets were rather bare this morning owing to the wet weather effectually putting a stop to picking, and to the delay in the arrival of supplies from Hobart The Tambo is expected to- morrow with about 500 lines of apples Although this supply will meet an almost entirely bare, market, was anticipated that prices will become, OH the demand it pie eat is not very great Oranges are slow of sale at very low rates. (Some inferior, frost-bitten lots came under notice at as low as 9d per case For prime varieties, however, prices were a shade firmer. Advices from Melbourne report that 0 little hardening tendency has occurred in the orange market in the Southern evil). This is good news for local shippers, who have of late been facing a TOTHILL nearly all their own Mgnmctiti New Zealand, however continues dull There'll demand for mandarins continues fairly) good, of specially for the better quality. Bananas were very plentiful from both Fiji and Queensland, and prices were low. Scarcely) any demand was experienced for pineapples, and agents have the greatest difficult is to get purchasers at very low rates. This is due to the fact that the fruit is turning out very bad). The supplies were cut during the cold weather before the fruit Wash thoroughly matured, and coming to a colder climes they turned back in the centre Qua vas and other lines of small fruits are daily becoming more scarce.

The Belmore Market still continues to be over-supplied with all varieties of vegetables. Prices in consequence I ruled weak, and it was with consent ruble difficult; that stocks were cleared out. Both cabbage and cauliflower, which are at present the staple lines, were in abundant supply from the western districts as well as the local gardens.
