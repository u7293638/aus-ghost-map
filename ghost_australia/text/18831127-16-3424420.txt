DONAL GRANT.* BY GEORGE MACDONALD. Author of " Alec Forbes," "Malcolm," &c;, &c.; CHAPTER XL. As the clock upon the schoolroom chimney- piece was striking the hour for lessons, Arctura entered, and, as if she had been a pupil from the first, sat down at the table with Davie. Donal set before her a copy of Euclid, and appointed her a task as he might any other pupil, and she began at once to learn it. After a while, so brief that Davie stared incredulous, she said, " If you please, Mr. Grant, I think I could be questioned upon it now ;" and a very few moments sufficed to show Donal that she thoroughly understood what she had been learning. He set her then a little more, and so the afternoon went-much to the delight of Davie, who thought it delightful to have cousin Arkie for a fellow pupil. That suchlike intellectual occupation must greatly subserve Lady Arctura's health, both of body and mind, Donal, before the afternoon was over, had not a doubt left. It was enough to see with what entire devotion she gave herself to the work set her ; and he was glad at heart for her sake, believing that all knowledge helps to the know- ing of God by one who already knows Him, inasmuch as there is nothing to be known but has its being in Him. But he could not help thinking also what a superior nature hers must be, seeing that, after the strange and dreadful things she had been going through that very morning, she was yet able to work so calmly at matters of the mere intellect ; not many women, and just as few men, he thought, would have been capable of it. . School over, and Davie gone to his rabbits. " Mrs. Brookes invites us to take supper with her," said Lady Arctura. "I begged her to ask us. So if you do not mind, Mr. Grant, you had bettor make a good tea, and we shall not have dinner to-day. You see I want to shorten the hours of the night as much as I can, and not go to bed till I am quite sleepy. You don't mind, do you?" "I am very glad, and you are very wise, my lady," responded Donal. "I quite approve of the plan, and shall be delighted to spend as much of the night in Mrs. Brookes's parlour as you please." "Don't you think we had better tell her all about it?" "As you judge fit, my lady. The secret is in no sense mine; it is only yours, and the sooner it ceases to be a secret tho better for all of us, I venture to think." " I have but one reason for delay," she re- turned. "I need hardly tell you what that is!" " You would avoid any risk of annoying your uncle, I presume ?" " Yes ; I cannot quite tell how he might take it, but I know he would not like it. It is perhaps natural that a man like him should think of himself as having the first and real authority in the house, but there are many reasons why I should not give way to that." " There are indeed!" assented Donal "Still, I should be sorry to offend him more than I can help. If he were a man like my father, I should never dream of going against his liking in anything ; I should in fact leave everything to him as long as he pleased to take interest in what was going on. But you know, being the man he is, that would be absurd. I must not, I dare not, let him mange my affairs for me much longer. I must understand for myself-for surely that was my father's design -how things are going with my tenants!" " You will not, I hope, do anything without the advice, I should say the presence, of a lawyer," said Donal-" I mean in conference with your uncle !" " Do you say so ?" " I do indeed. I think it would be very un- desirable. I fear I have less confidence in your uncle than you have !" Arctura made no reply, and Donal grew afraid she did not like his having ventured an opinion about her uncle; but the next moment she looked up with a sad smile, and said : " Well, poor man ! we must not begin com- paring our opinions about him; he is my father's brother after all, and I shall be glad if I get through without offending him. But I know my father would be far from satisfied if I left everything to him just as if he had not left everything to me. I cannot help thinking that if he had been another sort of man my father would have left the estate to him. I wonder they got on together so well as they did." Donal did not care to say what he thought about this-which was that very likely the earl had been cunning enough to present at least a modified character to his brother. He must have blinded him somehow ; for how else could those things of which Mrs. Brookes had spoken to him have gone on in the house? while doubtless the state of the late earl's health had rendered the thing easier. At 9 o'clock they were in the housekeeper's room-a low-ceiled, but rather large room, lined almost all around with oak presses, which were Mrs. Brookes's delight, for she had more than usual nowadays of the old-fashioned housekeeper about her. She welcomed them as if she had been in her own house, and made an excellent hostess, presiding over a Scotch supper of minced collops and mashed potatoes, to which she had added some splendid coffee, on the making of which she prided herself. Nor were her guests loth to partake of it, for neither of them had any desire to shorten their time together, or feared being kept awake. Upon the coffee waited scones of the true sort, just such as Donal's mother would occasionally make for the greatest land of treat they ever had; and he thought it the nicest meal he had had since leaving home. Mrs. Brookes would have had him, after old, or at least time-honoured, custom, mix himself a glass of toddy, in which she would have liked to share in a modest fashion, but Donal would not ; his mother was prevalent still ; and for his own part he never liked his higher to be operated upon from his lower. He felt then as if possessed by a false or at least not quite real self, and, as I say, did not like it. But the root of his dislike lay in the teaching of his mother. Unlike not a few young men, and women too, he was proud to have learned this or that from his father or mother ; it was to him a patent of nobility, a voucher that he was honourably descended ; of his birth he was as proud as any man. And this night, arising from his refusal to make himself a tumbler of toddy, the conversation took such a turn that, to Arctura's delight, he was led on to talk about his father and mother, and the surroundings of his childhood. He told her all about the life he had led ; how at one time he kept cattle in the fields, at another sheep on tho mountains ; he told her how he had come to be sent to college, and then came all the story about Sir Arthur Galbraith ; and the night wore on, and Arctura was en- chanted. For himself Donal found it a greater pleasure than he had dared hope for to call back the history which already seemed so far behind him ; for he found that he could more easily than he had expected leave out the part concerning himself which he could not tell ; though it had seemed to him all his life latterly, and inextricabily mingled with that of his friends, he found as he told that it was nowise necessary to the understanding of the rest. But indeed it surprised him to find also how calmly he could now contemplate what had seemed at one time to threaten an everlasting winter of the soul. Nor was the discovery a pain, as he certainly would have found it had it come of his ceasing to care for Lady Galbraith ; she was his truest friend, whom he could trust with anything ; the dearest of sisters, whom he would rather now, so true and lovely was the relation between them, have for a sister than for a wife. It was far the better thing that she should be Gibbie's wife and Donal's sister. When they got to heaven, she would give him the kiss she had refused him down in the granite quarry. He had fallon into a brief brown study over these things, when all at once a sound of knock- ing fell on his ear. He started. There was something in it that affected him strangely. Neither of his companions took any notice of it. Yet it was now past 1 o'clock. It was like a knocking, three or four times, with the knuckles of the hand against the other side of the wall of the room. "What can that be?" he said, listening for more. " Hard yo never that afore, Maister Grant"? said the housekeeper. " I hae grown sae used til' 't that my ears hardly tak notice o' 't !" " What is it ?" asked Donal. " Ay, what is't ? Tell ye me that, gien ye can," she returned. " It's jist a chappin', an' God's trowth that's a' I ken aboot the same ! It comes, I believe I'm safe to say, ilka nicht ; but I couldna tak my aith upo' 't, 'cause I hae sae entirely ceased to pay attention til 't. There's queer things aboot mony an auld hoose, Mr. Grant, that'll tak the day o' judg- ment to explain. But they comma nearer me nor the ither side o' the wa', sae far as I ken ; an' sae lang as they keep to their ain side o' that I dinna see that I need trible my heid aboot them. Mony nichts I couldna say I h'ard them at a' ; yet I dinna doobt they hae been, a' the same. Efter the experience I had * The sole right of publication in Queensland of Donal Grant" has been purchased by the -Brisbane Newspaper Company, Limited. as a yoong lass, awa' doon in Englan' yon'er, at a place my auntie got me intil-for she kenned a heap o' grand fowk throu bein' her sel' sae near conncekit wi' them as hoosekeeper i' this same castel-efter that, I'm sayin, I wadna need to be that easy scaret !" " Do tell us about it," said Lady Arctura. " I don't think you ever told me." " No, my dear lady, I wad never hae thocht o' tellin' ye ony sic story, sae lang as ye was ower yoong no to be frightit at it, for deed I think they're muckle to blame that tells bairns the varra things they're no fit to hear, an' sae the dreid gets tixt afore the sense comes. But I s' tell ye the noo, gin ye wad like to hear 't. It's maybe a some awsome story, but there's something unco fulish like intil 't as weel. I canna say I think muckle o' craturs that trible their heids aboot their heids-but that's tellin' aforehan'." Here the good woman paused thoughtfully. "I am longing to hear your story, Mrs Brookes," said Donal, thinking she waited for some encouragement. " I'm but thinkin' boo tobegin," she returned, " sae as to gie ye the rieht haud o' the thing at ance-I'm thinkin' I canna do better nor jist tell 't as it cam to mysel' !-Weel, ye see, I was but a yoong lass, aboot-weel I micht hae been twenty or sac, mair or less-whan I gaed till the place I speak o'. It was awa' upo' the borders o' Wales, like as gien folk ower there i' Perth war doobtfu' whether sic or sic a place was i' tho hielan's or lowlan's. The maister o' the hoose was a yoong man awa' upo' 's travels, I kenna whaur-some upo' the continent, but thar's a muckle word ; an' as he had the intention o' bein' awa' for some time to come, no carin' that muckle to settle doon an' luik efter his ain, there was but ao gey auld woman to hoosekeep, an' me to help her, an' a man or twa aboot the place to luik efter the garden-an' that was a'. The place was to let, an' was put intil tho han's o' ano o' thae agents, as they ca' them, for that same purpose-to be let, that is, for a term o' years. Weel, ae day there cam a gentleman to luik at the place, an' he was sae weel pleased wi' 't, as weel he micht, for, eh, it was a bonny place-ave lauchin' like, whaur this place is aye i' the sulks! -Na, no aye, I dinna mean that, my lady, forgottin' 'at it's yours ! But ye mann own it taks a heap o' sunlicht to gar this auld hoose here luik anything but some dour-an' I beg yer pardon, my lady." " You are quite right, Mistress Brookes !" said Arctura, with a smile. "If it were not for you in it, it would be dour, dour," But with that she cast a look at Donal, as much as to say, " I did not mean not to include you !" "You do not know how much-I don't believe Mistress Brookes herself knows how much-I owe to her, Mr. Grant ! I must have gone out of my mind for very dreariness if it had not been for her." " That I could easily imagine," said Donal ; and Mrs. Brookes began again. "The short an'the lang o' 't was that the place was let an' tacn, muckle to the satisfac- tion o' baith parties, I mak mae doobt ; and it was arranged that not only should the auld housekeeper, she bein' a fixtur like, bide, but that I should bide as weel, and, as afore, under the housekeeper, an' haein' naething to do wi' the stranger's servants. An' sae they cam. There was a gentleman o' a middle age, wi' his leddy some yoonger nor himsel', han'some, but not bonnie-only that has naothing to do wi' my talc, and I needna tak up yer time, for it's growin' some late." "Never mind the time, Mistress Brookes," said Arctura ; " we can do just as we please with that. One time is as good as another isn't it, Mr. Grant?" " One who has often stayed out on the hill all night," said Donal, " is not likely to fancy it a duty to go to bed at a certain hour. I sometimes sit up half the night myself." "It's sair upsettin' to the wark, though," said the housekeeper. "I wonder what the house would be like if I was to do that, and sleep in the next mornin' !" ' Of course we must all mind what is required of us, if we would take any freedoms with a good conscience," said Donal. " But this will never do for our story ! Do go on, please, Mrs. Brookes." " Well, sir, an' my lady, I'm ready to sit up till the cocks hae dune crawin', an' the day has dune dawin', gien it be to please the ane or the twa o' ye ! sae' for my true tale !-They war verra dacent weel-behavet fowk, wi' a fine faimily, some grown an' some growin', aboot them. It was jist a fawvour to see sic a hale- some clan-frae auchteen or thereawa' doon to a wee toddlin' lassie, was the verra apple o' the e'e to a' the e'en aboot the place. But that's neither here nor yet there ! A' gaed on jist as it should gang on whaur the servan's are no ower gran' for their ain wark, nor ower meddle- some wi' the work o' their neibours ; naething was negleckit, nor onything girned aboot; an' a' was pence an' hermony, as it gangs i' the auld sang about bonny Kilmeny-that is, till ae nicht.-Yo see I'm tellin' ye as it cam' to mysel' an' no til anithor ! "As I lay i' my bed that nicht-an' ye may be sure at my age I lay nae langer nor jist to turn mo ower ance, an' in gineral no that ance-jist as I was fa'in' asleep, up gat sic a romago i' the servan's' ha', jist aneth whaur I was lyin,' that I thoeht wi' mysel', what upo' earth's come to the place ? * Gien it bena the day o' judgment, troth, it's no the day o' sma things !' I said. It was as gien a' the cheers and tables thegither war bein' routit oot o' the places, an' syne set back again, an' the tables turnt heels owerheid, an' a the glaiss an' a' the plate for the denner knockit aboot as gien they had been sae mony hailstanes that warna wantit ony mair, but micht jist lie whaur they fell. I couldna for the life o' me think what it micht betoken, save an' excep' a general frenzy had seized upo' every man an' woman i' the hoose ! I got up in a hurry ; whatever was gaen' on, I wadna wi'lingly gang withoot my share ! An' jist as I opened my door I heard tho maister cry : ' What i' the name o' a' that's holy,' says he, 'is the meanin' o' this?' An' I ran til him oot o' the passage an' through the swing- door into the great corridor, an' says I, ' 'Deed sir, I was jist won'crin' ! an' wi' yer leave, sir, I'll gang an' see,' I said, gatherin' my shawl aboot me as weel as I could to hide what was aneth it, or rather what wasna aneth it, for I hadna that muckle on. But, says he, ' No, no you must not go ; who knows what it may be I'II go myself. They may be robbers, and the men fighting them. You stop where you are.' Sayin' that, he was half-way down the stair. I followed him as far as the top, and stood there, looking down and hearkening, and the noise still going on. But he could hardly have won the len'th o' tho hall whan it stoppit a' at ance an' a'thegither. Ye may think what a din it mann hae been, whan I tell ye tho quaiet that cam upo' tho heels o't jist seemed to sting my twa lugs. The same moment'I h'ard the maister cryin' til mo to como doon. I ran, an' whan I reached the servan's' lia' wliaur ho stood jist inside the door, I glowered, for, wad yo believe me ? the place was as daccnt and quiet as ony lcirkyard i' the muinlicht ! There wasna a thing oot o' its place, nor an air o' dust, nor the sroa'cst disorder to be seen ! A' the things luikit as gien they had sattlet them scl's to sleep as usual, an' had sleepit till we cam an' waukit thom. The maister glowert at me, an' I glowert at the maister. But a' ho said was : A false alarm, yo seo, Rose!' An' what he thocht I canna tell, but wi'oot anither word we turn't, an' gaed up the stair again thegither. " Whan we war at the tap o' the stair, whaur a long passage ran awa' intil the dark afore's they ca'd it the corridor-for the can'le the maister carried flang na licht half way to the en' o' it, frac oot o' the mirk on a -suddent cam to meet 's a rampaugin' an' a ratlin' like o' a score o' nowt rinnin' awa' wi' their iron tethers aboot their necks-sic a rattlin' o' iron chains as ye never h'ard! an' a groanin' and a gruntin' jist fearsome. Again we stood an' luikit at ano anither; an my word, but noo the maister's face was enough to fricht a body o' itscl', lat alane the thing we h'ard an' saw naething to accoont for ! 'Gang awa' back to yer bed. Rose' he said; 'this'll never do.' 'And hoo are ye to help it, sir?' said I. ' That I cannot tell, answered he; 'but I wouldn't for the world your mistress heard it. I left her fast asleep, and I hope she'll sleep through it. Did you ever hear anything strange about the house before we came?' 'Never, sir,'said I, 'as sure as I stan' hereshiverin' '-for the nicht was i' the simmer, an' warm to that degree ! an' yet I was shiverin' as gien I was i' the cauld fit o' a fever, an' my moo' wad hardly consent to male the words I soucht to frame. " We stood that way for a minute or twa, an' there was naething mair, an' by degrees we grew a kin' o' ashamet, like as gien we war dootfu' we had h'ard onything ; an' when he said to me gang to my bed a second time, I gaed to my bed, an' wasna lang upo' the road, for fear I wad hear something mair, an' intil my bed, an' my heid 'aneth the claes, an' lay trim'lin'. But there was nae mair o' 't that nicht, an' I wasna ower muckle owercome to fa' asleep. "I' the mornin' I teilt the housekeeper a' aboot it ; but she hid her tongue in a mainner that was, to say the least o''t, varra strange to me. She didná laugh, nor yet say the thing was nonsense, but she jist h'ard an' h'ard an' saidna a word. I thocht wi' mysel', ia't possible she disna believe me? but I couldna mak that oot aithet. Sae, as she heild her tongue, I ]ist pu'd the bridle o' mine, an voocd there should be never another word said by me till she spak hersel'. An I wad sune hae had eneuch o' haudin' my tongue, but I hadna to haud it to onybody but her; an' I cam to the conclusion that she was feart o' bein speirt questions by them that had a richt to speir them, for that she had h'ard o' something afore, an' kenned mair nor she was it liberty to speak aboot. " But that was only the beginnin', an' little to what followed ! for frae that nicht there was na ae nicht passed but some ane or twa dis- turbit; an' whiles wi' some it was past a bidin'. The noises, an' the rum'lins, an abune a' the clankin' o' chains, that gaed on i' that boose, an' the groans, au' the cries, an' whiles the whustlin', an', what was maist waur not a', the lauchin', was something dieidfu', a' ayont believin' to ony but them that was intil 't. I sometimes think that maybe the terror o' 't maks it luik waur i' the recollection not it was; but I canna keep my senses an' doobt there waana something a'thegither by ord'nar i'the affair. An whan, or lang, it cam to the know- ledge o' the lady, an' she waukit up at nicht, an' h'ard the thing, whatever it was that made it a', an' sync whan the bairns was waukit up, an' aye the romage, noo i' this room, noo i' that, sae that the leevin' wad be cryin' as lood as the deid, though they could ill mak sie a din it was beyond beirn', and the maister made up his min' to hide mae langer, but to flit at ance, come o' 't what micht ! " For, as I oucht to hae telit ye, he had written to the owner o' the hoose, that was my ain maister, for it was mae use sayin' onything mair to the agent, wha only leucht an' declaret it maun be some o' his ain folk that was playin' tricks on him- which it angert him to hear, bein' as impossible as it was fause-sae wrote straucht awa' to his landlord, as I say ; but, as he was travellin' aboot on the Continent, he supposed either that the letter had not reached him, and never would reach him, or that he was shelterin' himsel' under the idea that they would think he had never had it, no wantin' to move in tho matter. But the verra day he had made up his min' that nothing should make him spend another week in the hoose, for Monday nights were always the waur, there did come a letter from the gentleman, sayin' that only that same hoor that he was writtin' had he received the maister's letter ; and he was sorry he had not had it before, but prayed him to put up with things till he got to him, and he would start, at the furthest, in two days more, and would set the thing right in less time than it would take to tell him what was amiss. A strange enough letter to be sure ! Harper, that was their butler, told me he had read every word of it-as strange as anything else in the business! Perhaps we,in the ser- vants hall, would never have h'ard onything o' a' this, but that the servan's themsel's were a' declarin that, if the family did not move, they must ; for, not to mention the terrors o' the nicht, the want o' rest was like to ruin them altogether ; so when the master got a gleam of comfort he felt bound by necessity to share it with the rest o' the hoosehold ; and that was hoo we were a' on the lookoot for the appearance o' oor promised deliverer, wha was sae cock- sure o' settin' things richt again. " Weel, at last, and that was in a verra few days, though they luikit lang to some i' that hoose, he appearit-a nice luikin gentleman, wi' sae sweet a smile that it wasna hard to believe whatever he telit ye. An' he had a licht airy way wi' him that was, to us oppress't craturs, strangely comfortin' , only it was ill to believe that he could really ken what had been a' this time goin' on i' the hoose, and treat it in that easy fashion! Hoover, - an' noo, Mr. Grant, an' my lady, I hae to tell ye what the butler told me, for I wasna present to hear for mysel'. Maybe he wouldna ha' told me, but that he wasn't an old man, though twice my age, and seemt to have taken a likin' to me though it never came to any thing ; and as I was always ceevil to any person that was ceevil to me, and never went further than was becomin', he made me the return on that occasion of tellin' me what he knew. "The young gentleman, the landlord, I mean, was to stop to lunch with the master, and in the meantime would have a glass of wine and a biscuit, and pullin' a bunch of keys out of his pocket he told Mr. Harper to take a certain one and go to his wine cellar and bring up a bottle from a certain bin. Harper took the key, and was just going out of the room, when he heard the visitor -though in truth he was more at home there than any of us-heard d him say, 'I'II tell you what you've been doing, sir, and you'll tell me whether I'm not right!' Hearin' that, the butler drew the door to, but made no haste to leave it and so heard the rest of the conversation between the two gentle- men-'I'll tell you what you've been doin',' says he. Didn't you find a man's head- a skull I mean,' upon the premises?' 'Well, yes, I believe we did, when I think of it,' says the master ; 'for my butler'-and there was the butler outside a listenin' to the whole tale!-'my butler came to me sayin', "Look here, sir, this is what I found in a little box in the ceilar, close by the door of the wine cellar ! It's a skull !" Oh, said I'--it was the master that was speakin',-' it'll be some medical student in the family has brought it to the house! So ho asked mo «hat he had better do with it.' 'And you told him, interrupted the gentleman, 'to bury it!' 'I did ; it seemed tho propel thing to do 'I hadn't a doubt of it,' said the gentleman , ' that is the cause of all the disturbance.' ' That?' says the master. 'That, and nothing else ! answers the gentle- man. And with that, as Harper confessed when he told me, there came over him such a horror that he daured nae langer stan' at the door, but for goin' down to the cellar to fetch the bottle of wine that was merely beyond his human faculty. I met him on the stair as white as a sheet, an' ready to drop. 'What's the matter, Mr. Harper?' said I ; and he told me all about it. 'Come along,' I said ; 'we'll go to the cellar together ! It's broad daylight, and there's nothing to hurt us.' So we went down. 'There, that's the box the horrid thing was lyin' in!' said he, as we came oot o' the wine cellar. An' wi' that there cam a groan like oot o' the ground it our feet, and we both h'ard it, and stood shakin' and dumb for a while, grippin' one another. 'I'm sure I don't know what in the name o' heaven it can all mean!' said he, but that was after he had got the wine, and we were on the way up again. 'Did ye show't ony disrespec' ?' said I ' No,' said he, ' I buried it, as I would anything else that had to be putten out of sight ' And so we was talkin' together, when there cam a great ringin' at the bell, and said he , 'They're won'erin' what's come o' me an' their wine, an' well they may! I maun run.' As soon as he entered the room, ' Whaur did ye bury the heid ye tuik frae the cellar'' said his master to him, and saidna a word as to hoo he had been sae lang gane for the wine. 'I buried it in the garden,' said he 'I hope you know tho spot,' said the strange gentleman. ' Yes, sir, I do,' said Harper ' Then come and show me,' said he. So all three of them went together, and got a spade, as they went, from the tool-house. Luckily the pool man was able to show them at once the very spot, and the gentleman dug up the skull with his own hands, careful not to touch it with the spade, and brought it back with him in his hand to the house, knocking the earth off it with his rough travelling glove. But when Harper looked to be told to take it back to the place where he found it, and trembled at the thought, and wondered how he was to get hold of me again and nobody the wiser, for he did not want to show frightened in the day time, to his surprise an' no sma' pleesur' the gentleman set the skull on the chimney piece, and as lunch had been laid i' the meantime, Mr Heywood haein' need to catch the neist train, an he waitit upo' them, he h'ard the whole story. I suppose they thocht it better he should hear, an' tell, the rest, sae the sooner to forget the terrors we had come throu'. Said the gentleman, 'Now, you'll have no more trouble. If you do, write to me, to the care o' so an' so, an' I'll release you from your obligation. But allow me to remark that you brought it on yourselves by interfering, I can't exactly say with my property, but with the property of another who knows how to defend his own without appeal to any law. It was the burying of that skull that caused all your annoyance ' 'But I always thought,' said the master, 'that the dead preferred and desired to have their bones buried. The ghosts of the dead, according to Cocker, would refuse to he quiet until their bodies were properly buried ' ' You may say what you please,' answered Mr Hey- wood, 'and I cannot pretend to explain the thing; I only know that when that head is buried these disagreeables always begin ' 'Then the head is in the way of being buried and dug up again?' said the master. 'I will tell you the whole story, if you like,'answered his land- lord. 'I would gladly hear it,' says he. I should like to see the daylight o' common sense cast upon the affair. ' ' That I cannot promise you,' he answered; 'but the story, as it has been handed down in our family, you shall hear.' You may be sure, my leddy, Harper was wide awake to hear all he could, that he might tell it again to the hall. 'Somewhere about a hundred-and-fifty years ago or so,' he began, ' one cold stormy night there came to the hall door a poor peddler with his pack on his back, and would fain have parted with some of his goods to the folk of the hall. The butler, who must have been rather a rough sort of man, told him they wanted nothing he could give them, and he might go about his business. But the man, who had something obstinate in him, I daur say, an' was, it may weel be, as anxious to get uneder shelter, hopin' it might be for the nicht, keepit on beggin'- in would he no see whether some o' tho women-folk micht na be weel wullin to buy o' him? At last the butler, oot o' a' patience wi' the man, ga'e him a great shove awa frae the door, so that the poor man fell down the steps, an' bangt the door to, nor ever lookit to see whether the man got up again or no. I' the mornin' the peddler was found lyin' deid in a little wood or shaw, no far frae the hoose. An' up got the cry, an what did they say but that the butler had murdert him, an' he was ta'en up and tried for't Whether the man w as not like in the neigh- bourhood I cannot tell,' said tin gentlemen, 'but the cry was against him, and things went the wrong way for him, though no one about the house believed he had done the deed, more than he might have caused his death by pushing him down the steps. But even that he could hardly have intended, and very likely the man may have been weak or ill, an' yet it would not have fallen but for the weicht o his pack on his back.' Still, efter an' a'- in' it's mysel' that's sayin' this, no the gentleman, my lady - in a part o' the country like that, gey an' lanely, it was not a nicht to turn a fellow creature oot in. The butler was at the same time in old and trusty servant, and his master was greatly concernt aboot the thing ' It is impossible at this time o' day,' said the gentle- man, ' to unerstan' boo such a thing could be- in the total abstinence o' diree' evidence-but the short and the weary lang o''t was that the man was hangt, an' hung in irons, for the deed. An' noo ye may be thinkin' the ghost o' the pair peddler began to haunt the hoose; but naething o' the kin'! There was nae disturb- ance o' that or o' ony ither sort. The man was deid and buried, whaever did or didna kill him, an' the body o' him that was said to hae killed him hung danglin' i' the win'. But, whatever the hoosehold may hae thocht or had i' their herts about it, the bert o' the man's maister was sair, an' he couldna help aye thinkin' that maybe he was to blame, an' micht hae done something mair nor he thocht o' at the time, to get the puir man aff ; for he was absolutely sure that, hooever rough he micht hae been, an' hooever he micht hae been the cause o' death to tho trouble- some man, he hadna meant to kill him ; it was, in pairt at least, an accident, an' he thoucht it hard lines. His maistei was an auld man, near han' auchty, an tuik things the mair seriously, I daursay, that he wasna that far frae the grave they had sent the puir butler til afore his time-gien that could be said o' ane wha's only grave was that o' the weathercock. An' aye he tuik himsel' to task as to whether he ouchtna to hae done some- thing mair- gane to the king maybe, for he couldna bide the thoucht o' the puir man, that had waitit upon him sae lang an' faithfu', hingin' an' swingin' up there, an' the flesh drappin' aff the banes o 'im, an still the banes hingin' there, an' swingin', an creakin', an' cryin', was sair upo' the old man. But the time passed, an' I kenna hoo lang or hoo short it may tak for a body in sic a position to come asunder, but at last the bancs began to drap, an, is they drappit, there they lay at the fut o' the gallows, for naebody unit to meddle wi' them; an' whan that cam to the know- ledge o' the auld gentleman he sent his fowk to gather them up an' bury them oot o'sieht. An' what was left o' the body, the upper pairt, hauden thegither wi' the irons, maybe-I keena weel hoo- hung an' swung there still, in every win' that blew. But it last, oot o' sorrow an' respec' for the deid, hoover he dee'd, his auld maister sent quaietly ae dark nicht, an' had the lave o' the banes taen doon an' laid i' the earth. An' frae that moment- would ye think it? - there was no peace i' the hoose! A clankin' o' chains got up, an' a' howlin, an' a compleein', a creakin' like i' the win'-an' sic a stramash a'thegither that the hoose was not fit to be leevit in whiles, though it was sometimes waur nor ither times, an' some thocht it had to do wi' the airt the win' blew ; aboot that I ken naething. But it gaed on like that for months, maybe year'- Mr. Harper wasna sure hoo long, the gentleman said-'till the auld man maist wished himsel' in o'the grave an' oot o'the trouble. But at last ae day cam anither auld man to see him -no so auld as himsel', but ane he kenned whan they war at the college thegither ; an' this was a man that had travelled greatly, an' was weel learnt in a heap o'things ordinary fowk, that gics themsel's a to the lan' an' the growin' o' corn an' beasts, are no likely to ken mackle aboot. He saw his auld freen was in trouble, and didna carry his age calm-like as was nat'ral, an sae speirt him what was the matter ;, and he told him the whole story, for it was nae won'er, whan the din gat up, especially wi' the clankin' o' chains intil 't, an' i' the dark days o'superstition, that they should connec' the tane wi' the tither-the haugin' wi' the the bungin'. "Wool," said the learnit' man, when he had h'ard a', "gien ye'll take my advice, ye'll jist sen' an' howk up that heid again, an' tak' it intil the hoose wi' ye, and hit it bide there whaur it was used sae lang to be ; do that, an' it's my opinion ye'll hear nae mair o' sic unruly gangin's on. " The auld gentleman tuik the advice, kenin' no better, an' but it was the richt advice, for frae that moment the romour was ower, an' they had nae mair o' 't. They laid the heid in a decent bit box i' the cellar, and there 't remaint, well content there to abide the day o' that jeedgment that'll set mony anither jeedgment to the richt-aboot, though what pleesur could be intil that cellar mair nor a hole i' the earth is a thing no for me to say! So wi' that generation there was nae mair trouble. But i' the coorse o' time there cam first ane an' syne anither wha forgot, maybe, leuch at the haill affair, an' didna believe a word o' the same. But they're but fules that gang again' the experience o' their forbears! What wad ye hae but they wad bury the heid? An' what wad come o' that but an auld dismay het up again? Up gat the din, the rampaugin, the clankin', an' a', jist as ill as ever! But whan, frichtet at the consequence o' their folly, they acknowled the property o' the ghaist in his ain heid, an' tuik it oot o' the earth an' intil the hoose again, a' was quaiet directly-quaiet as hert could desire.' Sae that was the story! An' when the lunch was ower, an' Mr. Harper was thinkin' the moment come whan they would order him to tak the heid, him that was maist trimlin' at the thoucht o' touchin' 't, an' lay t whaur it sae afton was whan it had a bowl intil 't, the gentleman got up, an' says he till him, 'Be so good,' says he, 'as fetch me my hatbox from the hall ' The butler went and got it is desired, and the gentleman took and unlocked it. But never a hat was there intil 't!. an' roon' he turnt whaur he stood, an' up he tuik the skull, neither as gien he lo'ed it nor feared it, as what reason had he to do either' An' he han'let it neither rouchly nor with that muckle care, but until the hatbox it gaed, willy, nilly, au' the lid was shutten doon upo' 't, an' the key was turnt i' the lock o' the same ; an' as gien he wad mak the thing richt sure o' no bein' puttin' ony mair whaur it had sic an objection to gang, up he tuik in his han' the hatbox an' the contrairy heid i' the inside o' t, an' awa' wi' him on his travels, here an' there ower the face o' the warl : he was on his w'y to Spain ony gait ! an' we saw nae mair o' him nor the held, nor h'ard ever a soun' mair o' clankin' nor ony ither unholy din. An' that's trowth, mak o' 't what ye like ! ' Mrs. Brookes was silent, and for some time not a word was spoken by either of the listeners. At last Donal spoke : "It is a strange story, Mistress Brookes," he said, " and the stranger that it would make us believe some of the inhabitants of the other world remain at least as silly as when they left this one. That is a terribly dreary thought with regard to a large proportion of the human race." " I canna say aething anent that, sir," answered Mrs. Brookes ; "I'm no accountable for what's to be drawn frae my ower true tale; an' doobtless, sir, ye ken far better nor me- but whaur ye see sae mony folk draw oot a lang life here, and never ae sensible thing, that they could help, done or said, what for should ye won'er that noo an' than ane i' the ither warl shaws himsel siclike. Whan ye consider the heap o' folk that dees, and how many more there must be in the other world than in this, I confess for my part I wonder more that we are left at peace at all, and that they comena swarmin' aboot us i' the nicht like black doos. Ye'll maybe say they canna, an' ye'll maybe say they come, but sae lang as they plague me nae waur nor oor freen' upo' the tither side o' the wa' I canna say I care that muckle. But I think whiles hoo thae ghaists maun lauch at them that lauchs as gien there war nae sic craturs i' the warl'! For my pairt I neither fear them nor seek till them ; I'll be ane mysel' afore lang' only I wad wuss to gang in amo' better behavet anes nor them that gangs aboot plaguin' folk " "You speak the best of sense," said Donal ; " but I should like to understand why the poor hanged fellow should have such an objection to having his skull laid in the ground! Why has he such a fancy after his old bones? Could he have been so closely associated with them still that he could not do without the plenty of fresh an they got him used to as they hung on the gallows? And then it was only his head he cared about having above groun! ! It is quite bewildering ! We can't believe that oar very bones rise again - even if St. Paul hadn't told us the contrary! Why should the dead haunt their bones as it to make suit of having their own again?" "But," said Mrs. Brookes, "be'gin' yer pardon, sir, hoo do ye ken what they ken? Ye may ken better, but maybe they dinna ; for haena ye jist allboed that sic condue' as I hae been describin' to ye can be nacthing but foolish, wither done i' the streets by rowdy laddies, or i' the hoose by craturs ye canna see. They may think they'll want their banes by- an'by, though ya ken better ; , an', whatever you wise folk may think the noo, ye ken it's no that lang sin' a' body-ay, tho best o' folk- thocht the same ; an' there's no a doobt they a' did at the time that man was hangt." " But why his head more than the rest of his bones?'' " Weel, sir, I'm thinking a ghaist, ghaist though he be, cuma surely be i' twa places at ance ; sae he couldna weel luik efter a' his banes when they war dividit an' seperate ; but, konnin' that, when he was nine, the heid seemed somehoo o' the first consqeuence, he micht weel think he and stick by that, an" diree' a' his energy to keep at least an e'e upo' 't. An', stickin' by't sae lang, he was the less wuilin'' to lose sicht o' 't. Ye see it canna be sae mony ghaists that hae the chance o' seein' sae muckle o' their banes efter they're deid, as this ane had ; it's nae so mony o' them hae the preevilege o' luiking upo' the body bolongin' to them as it swings an'sways, infeckin' the air, an' sayin' to themsels, ' Yon's mine !' An' this same ghaist that was sae fonl o' his ain auld eareass, an' sae sorry for't, heukit up there in disgrace an' him free, micht weel hae a cat- like nature for stickin' to places too, an' sae maybe likit the cellar whaur lay the wine, as in ither cases we hae h'ard o' ghasits hauntin' the places whaur used to be their gowd, an' ithers the places whaur their warst sins war committit. Mony's the story l could tell you that hoosekeeper, honest womar, telled to me ; for what had come an' gane set her openin' oot her pack, an' I believe I could hand ye there a' the nicht tellin' ye ane after anither o' them. But it's time to gang to oor beds ' "Well, I won't ask you for any more to- night," said Lady Arctura ; " but we must now tell you something ! Only you must tell nobody just yet ; there are reasons. Mr. Grant has found the lost room!" For a few moments Mrs Brookes said nothing. She neither paled nor looked in- credulous ; her face was simply fixed and still, as if she were thinking of something to put alongside of what was now told her. At last "Then there aye was sic a place!" she said. "I was aye o' the min', an' mony a time thoeht I would luik for 't to please mysel'; but the richt time never cam. Sic a place bein', it's sma' won'er we should hear soon's raps an' siclike aboot the hoose !" "You will not think differently when we tell you what found in it," said Arctura. " That was why I asked you to let us come to supper with you ; I was afraid to go to bed for thinking about it." " You've been into it, my lady! -And what did you see?" asked Mrs. Brookes, with grow- ing eyes. "It is the old chapel of the house! I have heard there is mention made of it in some of the old papers in the iron chest. No one, I suppose, evere dreamed that the room they told such stories of could be the chapel ! Yet what should we find there but a bed! And in the bed not the skeleton but the dust of a woman ! and on the altar lay another dust, that of a very little child !" "The Lord be aboot us ! an' atween 's an' harm ! cried the housekeeper, her well-sea- soned composure giving way at last ; "ye saw that wi' yer ain e'en, my lady ! Mr. Grant ! hoo could ye lat her leddyship see sic things? I thoucht ye wad hae had mair sense !" " My lady has more sense than you seem to think, Mrs Biookes!" returned Donal laugh- ing a little, but almost wishing she had not been with him. "I had no right to go without her ladyship if she wanted to go." "That's verra true ; but, eh, my bonny bairn, sic sights is no for you !" " I ought to know what is in my own house!" said Arctura, with a little involuntary shudder. "But I shall feel more comfortable now you know too. Mr. Grant would like to have your advice as to what we ought to do with the-the remains. You'll come and see the place, Mrs. Brookes?'' " Yes, surely ; when you please, my lady- but not to-night-you do not mean to- night ?" "No, certainly! Not to-night. I wonder if any of the noises we hear in this house are made by ghosts wanting to let you know their bodies are not buried yet! There are some that want to be buried, I suppose, though here and there one may not!" "I wouldna wonder !"answered Mrs. Brookes thoughtfully. " What would you have us do with the dust?" asked Donal. "I would have you bury it as soon as possible " "That is certainly the natural thing ! The human body is not any case to be treated as loss than sacred," said Donal. "I'll turn the thing ower in my min', sir. I wadna willini'ly hae a heap o' clash i' the country-side about it. Efter an' a' they war yer ain forbears, my leddy ; an' sic things are as weel forgotten ; for ye ken, my leddy, there's a gay look o' ill stones aboot the hoose i' the auld time! Au' syne what would the earl say ? It micht upset him mair nor a bit. But, as I say, I'll consider o''t. " So the thing was left for the meantime. Donal accompanied the two to the door of their chamber, and then betook himself to the high places of the castle, where more than once, in what remained of the night, he woke fancying he heard the sounds of the ghost music sounding its coronach over the strange bier down below.
