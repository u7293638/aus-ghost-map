Under The Roof-Tree. ' From grave to gay — -from lively to severe.' (By Dl'jjqeah.) Prince Edward of York stands in a very unusual relationship, rboth :to -lya . . , ^t^er ':^hd':r^^^r3 ^r hel^iat the ^ same time tbira vdt 7 York, and second cousiri twice removed to tlie Duchess of York. Tlie Duke of Kent, and the Duke of Cambridge were sons of George the Third. Their respective children, Her Majesty the Queen and the Duchess of Teck are therefore first cousins, and thus the Prince of Wales and tlie Duchess of York are second cousins, which brings i the Duke of York and his son into the relationship of third cousins. On the , other hand the Duchess of York is second scousin once removed to the , Duke, and therefore is second cousin i twice removed to her own son. The selection of the fourth finger of the left hand as the wedding-ring linger both in Pagan and Christian times, is accounted for by several reasons. Iu an ancient ritual of mar riage, the husband placed the ring 011 the top of the thumb of the left hand whilst he said — ' In the Name of the Father ; ' lie then removed it to the forefinger, saying ' And of the Son,' and then to the middle finger with tlie | words, ' And of the Holy Ghost,' and with the final word 'Amen ' he placed j the ring 011 the fourth finger where it 1 remained.
