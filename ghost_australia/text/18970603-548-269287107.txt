TAkLAKteATTA. From Our Own Correspondent. Monclay. The annual Oddfellows Hall takes place on Friday, 11th prox. The arrangements are being carried out on an elaborate scale, and a very brilliant turnout is anticipated. A slight break in the drought was experienced here last week, when about twenty points of rain was regis tered. The Tallaugattaites apparently do not intend to do anything in connec tion with the Diamond Jubilee. Some people consider that some movement should be taken by the Towong Shire, and various suggestions have been made as to what form the movement should take. One suggestion is that the Shire should have a row of trees planted in front of the Shire Hail. The Shire has already some trees in the local streets, which though few in number are more than it can attend to. When the trees were planted a few year3 ago, they were enclosed by guards encased with wire netting, and from that day to this they have appa rently been forgotten. A number of the trees, after a vain struggle for the supremacy with thistles, weeds, etc., yielded up the ghost, while most of the remainder, when the guards be came broken, fell a prey to the arbo reous tastes of nomadic horses and cattlo. Of course, we all know that the financial position of the Shire has not of late been very encouraging, but as the dead trees could have been re placed, and the guards repaired at a nominal cost, the neglect is inexcus able. Now that we have a man per manently employed about the town, the streets will no doubt look a little more presentable, and if the Shire attends to the old trees, and gets a row planted in front of the Shire Hall, as was suggested, they will be doing a little in commemoration of Her Majestyâ€™s auspicious reign.
