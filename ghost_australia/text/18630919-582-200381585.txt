In 1861 he resigned his appointment; the Government then owed him arrears of salary amounting to "a large sum," (we quote from the insolvent's declaration, made on oath). He had not received any salary for four months ; the Government refused to pay such arrears during about six months. Owing to this and to ill- health, together with other misfortunes, Mr Foster has been at length obliged to declare himself insol vent'. Mr Foster gained the esteem of the in habitants of this district while he was on duty here, and they will read of his misfortunes with very sincere regret, . .
