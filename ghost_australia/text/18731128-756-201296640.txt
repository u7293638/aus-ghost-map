THE OLD LADY AND THE ROBBERS. Whether this story is !true or false we do not know ; but it is said, here that recently in the. parish' of St.; Martin' Iberia, or soraewhere down that w.ay, ari old widow ladv, whose children had all. married off and left; her," had been persuaded to sell ber little place and live with them. She. sold her land, buildings, and improvements one day for- 2000 -dollars, and received the money in cash on the spot, in her own house, where the act of sale was passed before two witnesses, the number required by the law, and who witnessed also the payment of the money. In a short time she was to give possession, but she remained in the house the night following . the sale ajl. alone, or with no masculine adult inmates, as was her custom. That night two negro burglars broke into the house, and demanded her money or her life. She gave it to, them, but begged them to let her have 100 dollars, of it as she owed that amount, and wanted to pay the debt, when she would be satisfied. They finally agreed to let her have the 100 dollars. They then ordered her to make some coffee for. them to drink. In doing so she bethought herself of some strychnine she had in the house, and quietly dropped it in the pot of steaming coffee, and placed it on the table with cups, spoons, and sugar for them to pour out and sweeten to their ; taste. This they did, and drank ia a jolly mood, each one having 950 dollars in his pocket. But in a short time the tables were turned. One gave up the ghost where he sat at the tahle in his chair, and the other got up, staggered off a few feet, and tumbled over, into eternity. The good old lady recovered her money, and on examining the per sons of the black burglarious robbers, they turned out to be the two witnesses to the act of sale, both white men, blackened for the occasion — both her neighbors, and one was her cousin.— 'New Orleans.
