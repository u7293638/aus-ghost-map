A ISidsSstit SEStFHdep, A certain Sydney business man went to Newcastle the other day for a trip, and took a room in a hotel there. He went to bed in good time, and took the precaution to place near the head of tbe bed a bottle jf spirits for medicinal purposes in the night, if he was taken ill. He also placed his sword stick srithin arm's length of the bed; in case he might require it curing the night. There not beiner a lock 6n the door, he fatstened it with a piece of strintr, and he afterward retired to rest. At about midnigl t, the time at which it ie said that ghosts walk, he was awakened by, as he im agined, someone BDOTmg. He sat up in bed, and felt that his hair was standing oil end, eo great was his terror. He managed to reach the bottle containing the spirits, and took1, a long draught of it, which gave him courage enough to hold tlie sword stick. Having removed the case from the s word, he slowly stepped out of bed, and his foot came in contact with something soft. Having partaken the second time of the contents of the bottle, he struck a match aud lighted the candle, when lo ! he saw that the intruder was ? a pig ! which was sleeping by the side of the bed. The language he used is common enough, but no* polite. Havingwell thrashed the animal with a stick and terped it out and properly fastened the door, he again retired to rest.
