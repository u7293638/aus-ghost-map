THE ANSWER. I'm the very odd thing which is found in the rhyme Of the whimsical bard, in his changeable chime; Without me, his Rhodomondates would not flow, And they gather much strength from my Ah ! and my Oh ! I assist with my whimper, and aid with my chime, — No trophies without me, or metaphors, shine. I am harsh, hot, and heavy, rhapsodical, rough— But I happily end, if you stop at enough. In his childhood he found me and kept me at school, Thro' thick and thro' thin, he has followed my rule.— With heresy opening, I end at the Church ; And leading gay Hymen, I put out his torch. In courtship I'm seen, and so great is my power That I end in a month, what began in an hour. In hymns from the Hebrew, my melodies sound, And in Nathan, the Jew, am certainly found. I swim in the Hellespont, and I have store For poetical champions and strong Hellebore. The house too I lead, and the Sylph I attend ; In hypocrisy start, and in balderdash end. In chaos I'm wrapt; and the charnel house holds me, The shade of Misanthropy closely enfolds me ; I wander with ghosts, with hermits I dwell; In sulphur I stew, and I riot in hell. Yet always in fashion, I commonly teach The learned physician to turn to a leech. While in hieroglyphics I doubly am seen ; And the rays of the sun I display in a sheen. The sailor still follows my course in his ship, And with bachelors always I die of the hip. — With qualifications, good people, like, these, No wonder my presence his Lordship should please: — I'm the fam'd letter H — and 'egad ;if you doubt me, Pray try, how " Childe Harold" would manage without me.
