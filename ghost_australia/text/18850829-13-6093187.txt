To the Bishop of Melbourne must be awarded the piaise due to one ' not " weary in well doing," 'lhe cures of the churches nie upon lura, but withal he finds time foi much wilting aud much speaking His winter lectuies in Melbourne have come to bo regaidedas events m our social histor-, Ihey com mand crowded attendances, and that thej provoke thought is show n by the animated controveisies to which they givo use And the public is probably bettei mlormed by discussion than it ia b3 direct teaching Wo may well con gratúlate ourselvesupon having this \ ital torce in oin midst It is natural that 111 his addresses the Bishop should be atti acted by the gi eat Apostle of tho Gentiles, for it may bo claimed that he is an inheritor ot the Pauline spa it, and that, in common with the broad and genorous minds of all ages, he is to be lound fighting the Pauline fight 'Jheie are those in every generation who, like the man of Anhoch, are diawn to Judaism, who aie inclined to bo rigid m observances, to favour set foims, and to wssfc upon special austerity on particular days , and with such there is alvvajs a conflict to be maintained 'ihough PAUL was scourged nud bulieted, and was thrown into the aieua to contend with wild beasts, his real conflict was with the Judaismg apostles and the Judaismg spirit, and the good fight which he commenced has to be fought to its end Qhus the church men of the Moorhouse type aie both fascinated by '.t P .TIL'S example, and aie fed by the Pauline woids -heir hearts go forth to the preacher who addressed to Christians the injune tion-" Let no man, therefore, judge " j ou in meat or in dunk, or in respect " of hohda} s, or of new moons, or of ' the sabbith davs" Piobablv the public would have been deprived of a contioveisy m oui columns this time if the Bishops critics had not treated him very much as St PAUÍ is usually wiongly dealt with Taiticulai passages are taken and are commented upon, and no man c m less bear tins detachment than St PALL, who indulged 111 the tine rhetoucal practice ot stating the one tiutli with all las 101 ce, even if the statement had to be qualified further on And tbo Apostle s elucidators naturallvoitcn occupy the same position The complaint and the charge of Aratt deacon S-J-TTKRY were in effect, that the Bishop had treated as "the whole counsel " of GOD " the vehement charge of the Apostle as to the value and the necessity of faith i-ddrc-oed to a particular people "upon whom .Tuda " ising brethren had »ought to " engraft the moribund Mosaical law." But it-waa no more fair to say this of the Bishop titan it would be to say it of St. PAUL. Tho Apostlo wrote at one time, " Wo reckon, therefore, that a " man is justified by faith apart from " the works of the law :" and at an- other time, no one moie exalted than ha good woiks in the name and form of charity. Pauline sentences quoted by themselves can be placed in as sharp a contrast as that which apparently exist between the text quoted from the Epistle to the Homans and the verse of St. JAMES. "What does it profit though "a man say lie hath faith and ha\e " not works 1 Can faith save him I ' Theologians have found no difficulty in reconciling these utterances, mid an finding that they harmonise when viewed from a distance, and the impulse « Archdeacon certainly paid Bishop MOOR- HOUSE a poor compliment when life sup- posed that because it was his lot to speak one day of the part, ho was igno- rant of tlio whole. The Archdeacon is a wiser man to-day, though it is neither necessary nor desirable to assume that he is any way s>idder. Whenever occa- sion requires, the polemical sword, «e may be .sure, will be found to be as freu as of yore, and to be Hashed in the oki joyful spirit. It wis anui-inp, cer- tainly, that the . rev. gentleman should accuse the Bishop of dark- ening counsel by relying upon text«, and should then have founded his charge upon a particular passage in the address of his adversary. Thei e is really no overcoming the penchant of ecclesiastics for assuming that a para- graph or a chapter is the book lor attaching tho sanctity of the temple to the stones, and for deal- ing with the bricks instead of the building. One great discussion has been avoided. Archdeacon SLA-TKRY referred to the dictum of St. ÁoüU-Ti-i-.. "that " he would not believo the Gospel " unless the authority of the Catholic " Church moved him thereto," and the Bishop retorted with the averment that " if the Dean can give me Scriptural " proofs of the infallibility of __.ePr.__, I " will turn l'oman Catholic." The controversy whether the Scriptui-3 are subordinate to the Church, or whether the Church has authority over the Scriptures, has endured for 300 years in the past, and seems secureiof another temi of 300 years in the future, and we may be grateful that the com- batants have not joined diiect issue. The discussion terminates happily, as it should, with an admission from Arch- deacon i_".-TTK-Y that he recognises in his brother theologian something of the spirit of " love " which he thought was missing from his doctrine. is'oi would the public, it seems, havo heard fioni the Jtev A GOSMATN, but foi a misunderstanding The rev gen- tleman supposed the Bishop to haie contended that continuous moral pio gic-s is impossible outsido of the Cliustian faith whereas the statement of the Bishop is, tint as a mattei o. lnstoiy no such pioirrcss lias taken place Vi ith the heathen wc see fit i development, and then decaj fun li is the Bishops position And tims explained, ho would be a very aulent ev olutionist who would challenge tho contention Help, again, we stop on the threshold of an issue of gteatcc mteiest thin the one nituall) íalsed Ts moral progre=s duo to rite 01 to reli- gion 01 to both í 'luir-, tilt- rlindoi is no letter than he was t-enentions back, and the Olnnese, despite then stole of moral precepts, aie piobably woise, but then vie so nations who in turn mo unailecteil by Christianity The Ab> ssmian chun h is ancient amongst the ancient, but GORDON* prefoi red the Moslem to the debased tribes undei King IOIIN Clnis tendom had its da) m Noithun A.-HJ, and did not regenerate the pooping and the saddest possible accounts come fiom tin» freed Cliustian neeroes ot J lbf.iu and Un) ti Would the Teuton hive flourished ns he does without Clins tiamt) ' 1 he problem, hovuvet nindi it may be argued, is insoluble We maj' be content to see a Divine ouli nance in the nuangement which faio to the conquering race of the woilcl the one iehgion which checks its faults i id stimulates its vu tues, and we have the comfortable assurance that the faith and the people aie destined to overspread the globe thus linked togethei 'lhanks to the labouis of our cpn> tubutoi "Marrellus," tho public has obtained an inside knowledge of Hie "medical clan voj ant," who still llouushes in Melbourne 'lins indi vidual is almost the last relic of the spiritualistic maze which at one time was i foice heie It was at its height when 1'osiEi, the American medium, visited the colon), and when that trans parent cheat netted from X100 to ¿£200 per day by his impudent pei.oumnces The guinea .¡.cwic. was then an in«titu tion in the land It was harve->t time with the medium That " little s) sfeni," however, hits ceased to be, and stances no longer nftordmg an income, the piofe'sional medium has in many cases tiausfouned lum oi herself into the " clairvoyant healer," and as busi ness is good, there have been additions to theso îanks leihaps the e\posuie made in our columns of the tnckeiy of the piecious fiaternity will assist in duvmg them out ot their piesent com f oi table resort It is in nccoi dance with the nature of things that the stionghold of the charlatan should be the quasi prac tice of medicine.

" occur " It is an old story that when the patient ha« lost confidence in his physician ' the timo for a, change has come. The treatment may not be altered, and yet the sufferer will improve. Again, it is as easy for a patient to imagine himself cm ed as it is to imagine himself ill. Sir HENRY HOLAND took guineas from a whole circle of invalid dowagers, for whom bo prescribed , nothing, but who were cheered and im- proved by live minutes' agreeable con- versation. There are deeper mysteries than this. KicrrA-DS, F.vYnxit, and other Indian authorities, record cases in which Hindoos who believed them selves poisoned died after reproducing the phenomena of snakebite, though they had either not been bitten, or had suffered from a reptile of the non venomous kind. There is tli3 authonti ? ciited stor}' of the French criminal, who died because he believed that he was being bled to death, while in reality his arms were only pricked, and a sound of trickling water made to imitate tho noise of flowing blood. Tho "evil " eye " of the Middle Ages of Europe was practised with effect amongst the Maories of the last genera- tion. Strong men, warned that . they would die, would waste away, and would expire on or before the ap- pointed time. CHARLES II. in his reign touched 100,000 people for the euro of " king's 'evil," as scrofula was called, and 'doubtless if the Sovereign had continued the practice, hundreds of testimonials of eurea would bo forth- coming for Her Majesty the QUEEN. The enthusiasm about tar water i as a spécifie has become historic because of Bishop Br.RKEi._Y's eloquent work in defence of the cure. The rage seems to have-been abated, if not killed, by .ham testimonials of some wag, ayer ring'tlmt his broken leg liad been put right by applications, the shattered limb proving to be a wooden one. Ûf modern miracles, the most extra- ordinary, perhaps, is that of the cure, at Port Boyal, of a hopeless case of blindness, by the application of tho " Holy Thorn " to,the obscured eye. It is attested by the " divine PASCAL." "Whet-tec the mental eye was blinded, or the bodily eye opened, faith was at work there. Facts and considerations such as these point to the credulity of society, and the propriety, if not the necessity, of'protecting tho weak. The mind enfeebled by disaa«e is readily duped. The sufferer, conscious only of his pain, look's anywhere and everywhere for re- lief. The law, it should bo under- stood, does not prescribe any particular uiodo of cure, but it insists that the medical practitioner shall be properly ? qualified for his work--just as it re- quires the locomotive driver who is in charge of life to know his business, and demands that masters of sea-going vessels shall hold certificates. . The legally-qualified medical practitioner can " heal by faith" as much aa he picases ; and indeed, ? in a con- siderable percentage of the cases brought to him, the modern physician relies moro upon inducing a cheerful spirit-upon raising tho patient from despondency and shaking off. gloom than ho does upon the mechanical action of drugs. But the medical clairvoyant is an ignoramus. Ile or she claims the 2'ossession of a non-natural power of inspecting the interior organs of a patient (who lins not been seen) to conceal his or her non-possession of the outside knowledge which can bo ac- quired, at the medical schools. If the logue had. the ppwer of supernatural , insight, he would not know the meaning of what he saw. If ho had the know- ledge which could turn insight to-good account ho would not mako the claim. But words aro wasted in oxposing the .sham aftor our contributor's record of his experiences, his relations of the con- tradictory tales told by the paroo clair- voyants about the same subject, their iguoranco of the organ's they talked about, and their amusing jargon in imitation of medical lore. Tho fraud stands properly pictured in the columns in question. The practical point is whether the offenders should go un- win pped of justice, and we submit that tho law ought to interfere. It is diffi- cult, as Mr. SKI-VICE says, to prevent fools parting with their money to rogues, but in this instance, the state, recognising the danger of the community being preyed upon, has undertaken to see to it that unless men havo received a medical education they shall not practise medicine, and this wholesome, rule is now being flagrantly violated. It is not for tis to indicate the'mode of procedure, but, if the Medical Practitioners Act does not meet1 tho case, there is a useful elas- ticity about the provisions of tho law relating to rogues and vagabonds. The statute lins been used before now, and may be used again, to include all sorts nnd conditions of harpies and prowlers. It should bo quite possible in some ' way to put ono of the " medical clair " voyant " brotherhood in gaol, for the encouragement of the others. A man ma}' do worse than " go to " the dogs"-especially to such a re- markable assemblage of thoso noblo . animals as that which has been gathered together for the last few days under the roof of the Exhibition-building. A i'rolich writer has said that " In the " beginning GOD created man, nnd per " ceiving his weakness, gave him the " dpg, charging the latter to see, hear, " smell, and run for his master." .'e'rtninly no other quadruped ap- proaches thisone in intelligence, docility, loyalty! unselfish affection, and life-long devotion. Was it not ADDISON who re- marked that the dog had been asso- ciated with man for six thousand years, and had acquired only one of his vices-that of fawning on his superior- ? Without the dog, civilisation would havo been impossible ; and no student of history who approaches the investigation of the subject with the qualifications of a naturalist, will dis- pute the dictum, that " the clog is the ?' first, elemont in tho progress of " humanity." Por the transition of mnn from the lowest grade of savagery -in which he grubbed up roots with hi_,claw-like lingers, or snared the tish in the pools, and fed upon insects and reptiles--to that of a hunter, and after-, wards of a shepherd, could not have >i-en effected without tho dog. And it is an impressive fact, as pointed out by I'IOTET in his Lex üríf/ines Indo-Huro Y'í'.mu.i, that wo must look for the birthplace of the European dog in the cradle of Aryan civilisation, that is tosny, on the table-lands of Central Asia.

The Public Service Act received the Royal assent on November 1, 1883 and the public school teachers contended that as the act provided for the payment of the first increment on the first day of July next ensuing after the passing of the act, they should receive the addition to their salaries from July 1, 1884. The depart ment, however, submitted that the act was not proclaimed to be in operation until January 1, 1885 and that the first increment was not payable until after July 1, 1885. The matter was referred to the law officers of the Crown and yesterday considered by the Cabinet, ith the result mentioned. Since the Premier announced in the Assembly that he would be prepared to consider the cases of any public servants who had suffered personal injustice through the operation of the Public Service Act, he has received between 25 and 30 letters from gen tlemen in the service of the Government claiming the fulfilment of his promise. A number of the complaints of injustice are based on what is alleged to be the improper classification either of the Public Service Commissioners or of the School Teachers' Classification Board. Mr. Service wishes it to be distinctly understood that he is not in a position to interfere with the classification in any way. As far as school teachers are concerned, the classifi cation is performed by the board of classi fiers, the teachers having the right of appeal to the Public Service Commissioners. The classification of officers of the public service generally rests solely with the Public Service Commissioners. The act directs that the commissioners shall value the work attaching to the various offices which have to be classified and they have no power to deal with cases of personal injustice.
