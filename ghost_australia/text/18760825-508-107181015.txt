Oaptaiu Johnson so 111 found ont that Orton was t very useful eciyant. and a man likely to oa of eerrios, both at tbe Tasmanlan place of landing and the Btation of Ueneurn Pirk, so tho captain toek him over in his own eraft, ills rreol'rarler, to Port Albert. After a time. In the year 1(C(,, I met Orton, aud then be was enraged an etockunn on the1 Hewburn Park station. At the euil of 1899 Uitoa went 10 Boisdals station, under eueagement -o Ur. PosUr, and in the year U57 he was. cent to ibe Uar/to. 1 know thut, lit 'INI, Ortba to 011 a station o*nw by Mr. P)«ter, but the place was 'called by soine absrlgliul name, which I do not remember.

Brown hair; stoat build j very little board ; pale complexion j a tooth mlsslag In tbe upper jaw.' This pe'sbaal description tallies to a nioety with that given of the ??Claimant.' Little does Artbar Orton suspect that the man ha left for dead with a hola In bis skull, is Uving yet! littU 4oes he know-, that there i- a man living who *in produoe his faoimile portrait, taken by the law, and tell that which will destroy him After] the Gippi land murder no «ne :, heirs of Arthur Or ton. ; Why} The answer is easy, ts it not natural that a 'man suspected of a murder, am* known to be fhorm stesier, should think a. change of nura dt^irab^e; ubd is then anything moienat ami than that he thould a-io|..t tiie nuns of Jils former S.inlU Ainorlwacy.liilntaucw.
