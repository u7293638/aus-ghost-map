V.R.C. WINTER MEETING. fMELBOURNE, July 21. The V.R.O. Steeplechase Meeting was hold at Flemington to-day. 'The weather was charming, and there was a good. attendance.. The racing was good, but a gloom was cast over the proceedings of the day by a fatal accident: which occurred during the running for the Grand National Steeplechase. Chrysalis fell at the stone wall in front of the grand stand and fatally injured her rider, Archie M'Innes, who was picked up insensible, and taken to the casualty room in the saddling paddock. The unfortunate jockey, however, died shortly afterwards. His chest was completely crushed by the fall, and he was greatly disfigured. A field of six in each instance faced the starter for the Maiden Hurdle and Maiden Steeplechase, and the former was won by The Joker, and the latter by Shamrock.' Prospect was a very warm favourite for the Grand National Hurdle, for which there were eight runners, but he did not succeed in gaining a place, and Batty on Dizzy scored a somewhat easy- victory. ilatador's nomination for this race .was declared informal, and therefore the horse did not start. For the Grand National Steeplechase eleven horses came to the post, and Sartor occupied the position of first favourite,while Australian Countand Lizetto were next fancied. The outsider Blackthorn, however, won easily, with the favourite occupying second place, while Australian Court did not secure a situation. Sunlight came in first for the Selling Hurdle Race, but as the jockoy was short of weight, the race was awarded to Wild Harry, by Manuka, out of the Tasmanian-bred mare Deception, formerly owned by the late MIr. H. D. Parr. Wild Harry was bought in at 50gs. The Flat Race brought out a large field, and was won, after a capital race, by Virago, in excellent time.
