r SBYDNEY SUMM1AltY, (From ,as & N. lHereld. TalS statement of the consolidated revenue of the colony of New South ?Yales, and of the special funds paid into the treasry,. at Sydney, during the, quarters ended 31st March, 1867, and iet March, 1888, respectively, published as a sup plement to the Government Gazette'of Friday, shows a comparative increase in the receipts of revenue proper for the past three months of £12,674 I2s. 6d.; the' amount collected being £467 ,00 10s. 7d., as against £455,025 18s. 2d. received dar in? the same period last year.' Loans account re ceipts last quarter were £709,781 2s. 9d., an increase of £433,004 iis 6d. Special receipts, £45,639 165\. 3d., a decrease of £6658 3s. 8d. Under the head of customs we find that last quarter's receipts exhibit a decrease of £4900 16s. 8d., attributable to the abolition of package duties, which during the first quarter of last year yielded £12,037 18B. Spirits show a decrease of nearly £9000, sugar and moles bee of £2140 17'. 9d... Vine,' coffee, opium, malt; rice, and the ad valorem duties also show a slight falling off. Against these there is an increase on tea of £16,180 Os. 8d.; tobacco, £3102 149. 9d.; Murray River customs, £1883190. 3d.; and on dried fruits, beer, and hops, of about £1500. The other heads of revenue showing a decrease are-Refined sugar and molasses, of £1768 13s. 4d.; gold, £582 s. 8d. ; mint receipts, £633 Os. 3d.; assessment on sheep, £93 8S. 94. inspection fees, £15 14s.; Cattle Disease Act contributions, £253 12s. 84.; registra tion of brands fees, £3162 19s. 3d. ;. postage, £1578 Its. 3d.; commission on money orders, £565 s.; fees of office, £755 Os. 3d.; rents, £91 1s. 1ld.; stamps, £900 2s. 6d.; telegraphs, £1199 14s. 6d.; pilotage and harbour dues, £665 29. 3d.; tonnage dues, £207 .14s. and rates under. Chinese Act, £20. Colonial distilled spirits show an Increase of revenue amounting to £1001 12s. Id., and the land revenue of £4930 4s. The latter is owing to a large amount being realised by sales. Interest paid by conditional purchase amounted to £3688 18s. 7d. more than was reoeived during the first quarter of 1887' but it almost balanced by the decrease in rentals of runs In the first-class settled districts; while, on the other hand, the receipts from the other districts show an increase of £1207 7s. 4d. Miners' rights have fallen off very much, and yielded only £2401, a decrease of £1621. Licenses show an increase of £651 13s. 3d., and railway receipts of £10,873 4s. Thus far the falling off in some departments almost balances the increase In the others. Miscellaneous receipts for the quarter amounted to £18,692 1l. 2d., and show an increase of £12,155 los. Id., of which £11,105 17s. lid. was repayments to credit of votes, £600 assessment on sugar-refining, and £4125 18s. d. bank interest on deposits; the balance consists of parliamentary and registration fees, surcharges re covered, and other miscellaneous receipts.

Payments from loans account amounted to £172,597 8s. 6d., making a gross expenditure for the quarter of £1,075,350 8s. 65.. 1 'he members of the Sydney rater commission, a few days ago. returned from a visit to the Valley of the GroTe. They started from the head of the valley at Darling's Causeway, and followed the river down to a point below its junction with the creek, from Govett's Leap. . Thi part of the country Is famed for its rugged Intricacles, and the commisioners of course found It extremely, difficult of access. , The railway surveylog party formed a track some years ago, but that is now nearly destroyed. i From the bead of the valley the commiusioners descended two thousand three hundred feet In the course of ten miles. -,Near the Junction of Govett's Leap they found an extensive allvial flat, where a lare store a reservoir might poisbly be formed, and they made the necessary observations 'and measurements ,to determine the dimenslons of such an embankment as -ould be required to throw the water back over the liat. It not thought that this would be an appro. priate place for a service reservoir, the distance being not.less than seventy miles from the city, but it might probably be well adapted for a storage lake from which, water might be conducted as required along the bed of the river to some suitable spot where a service reservoir might be formed, from which the water might be made to flow by its own gravitatlon Into Sydney. In that part of the valley which has been thought worthy of consideration In connection with the formation of a reservoir, the rocks on each side are of considerable height. They belong to the coal measures, and are surmounted by sandstone. ,, i o?The ra of discount in.the Bank of New South Wales have been reduced to elt, seven, and eight per cent.; for three, four, and over four months bills, and the leading colonial bank has acted wisely in setting this example to the rest. We have hereto. fore seen with regret too much disposition amongst the banks to combine for the purpose of keeping up discount rates, and shall view it as the commence. ment of a better system, if the bank first among the colonial banking institutions in wealth' and power take upon itself the leadership in a more liberal and enlightened policy for the future. r.Unquestionably the rates of discount ought to govern the rates of interest allowed for deposit money, and the former ought not to be kept up when the latter are reduced; The banks can always secure a proper margin of profit by lowering the deposit rates simultaneously with a reduction of rates of diecounti and this is the natural and proper course to pursue, and we hope for a further early reduction of both. The present slackened demand for bank money should have the effect of making discount rates easier, for it indiotes restricted business and reduced profits in the mar. cantile community and' at such a time discount rates naturally and reasonably fall.' This principle we are glad to see now recognised by the Bank of New South Wales. Money lacks full employment at present, because trade Is dull and confidence nar. rowed to a small circle 1 but with easter money, trade will revive and confidence extend, and the whole community derive benefit so far for the pressure and losses of the past, and they are entitled to the altired circumstances of the times to look for this turn in their favour. ' ur The Flaneur writes -Wisdom .crieth n in the street and no one regardeth her. I. can't help thinking to when I reflect upon the fate of an unhappy young man, who recently sought to 'earn his living by, selling newspapers and, other cheep literature in my part of the town. .Had4 he known as much of human nature a' an ordinary politician, he would as soon have thought of Italian plaster. casts or copies of the old masters as a means of attracting customers to his counter. - IRahly alon. lating on a demand for the belles lettres, he first established himself ln a handsome shop, and filled hisrindows with t yory brilliant display indeed, I watched the experiment with some Interest from day to day, being cuarious to suoertain the exact amount of literary taste in my rather populous neighbour. hood. Misgivings seised me on observing that no customer ever seemed to make his appearance. The Heralds and the Jackasses looke awfully fy marked, while the Freeman's Journal seemed to 6e rapidly qualifying itself for brawn paper. Nothing seemed to go off. comic songs of all deslcriptlons from A Norrible Tale to Paddle your own ba0oe were apparently as unsaleable as old Iron I; while the most bloodthirsty llustrations of popular weeklies had no more effect on the) passing publlo than Christian Pleaders. The natural result soon fol. lowed-the shutters were up and my friend wasone. Not altogether. ilHe tried another street, taking a much humbler establishment than the firsts but the effect was much the same. The poor fellow looked miserable enough as he stood behind his oounter-so mierable that I fancied at times he was consumin hisbwn stock like a desperate wine-merchant, nd hopelessly ruining his digestIon by devouring musty periodicals. I felt (slut at the thought that thls unwholesome diet. might be tried on the children, and their terrible paleness did indeed look as it it proceeded from a paper regimen. Again the shut ters were up, and this, time the unfortunate fellow had disappeared..: Heaven knows where he is now.

' I don't think much of "our village" after this Iatellectually speaking but comfort is drawn from the thought that t s much the same all over the town, and country too. There is more than one among us who could tell a very similar tale to that of my friend the newspaper man. There is more than one among us who ha tried to make a living by the tale of much higher atock than mere news. apers, and has failed as miserably as the poor fellow have spoken of. Ghosts of rained bookseller and publishers rise up before me as I write-ghosts of men who lived within the last ten or fifteen years, but who have taken themselves of one after another, to the shades below.: As I look over my sheres now, many a volume speaks to me of one or other of these poor fellows, from whose hands it came Into my possession. One of the old familiar faces was buried In a country churchyard only the other day, after what wanderings and what ufferings Apollo only can tell. I feel too sure now that every ven. ture of this enterprising publisher, and there were many, must have made a large hole in his till; and Idon't wonder, therefore, that publishers now-a-days require money down before they will even look at a manuscript. More than one author, or rather in tending author, has asked me how he was to get the roll of paper n his hand set up In type. By simply wrItiig'a cheque for £160, sirli-Thefun of the' hing s that the quality of the goods seems to make no difference as regards their potentiality of a sale, to use a Johnsonian phrase. Some fellows tried religious literature very bard, Investing hundreds of pounds in gorgeously bound Dibles and Prayer.Books of all shapes and sies others went in with equal zeal for fiction, and tired the pnblio with all the editions of our novelleti, from thirteen and six a volume down to eighteenpeuce; while others again aimed at the school-going par of the population, making sure of a market in that direction. ., Bt the result was nit.' form.
