COROWA. v. , 20th August. : lho first- of a,, series of popular- readings, announced; -to take place at, Corowa, was held on Wednesday night, having been postponed from the previous evening, on account- of the heavy rain, and proved a complete success, the building being so crowded that manv ladies were unable to procure seats. The whole of the performers, being local, and well known, comment is needless, excepting in the case of Captain Pierce, of the s.s. Corowa, who made his debut on this occasion, and of him anything I conld say would fall short of his merits. The fact of the audience encoring him four times on each occasion speaks for itself: The proceeds are to be devoted to the funds of the Corowa School. By spectal request the readings will be re peated on Saturday evening, when the entire programme will be changed,- and " The Ghost," who had been delayed by- the eclippe, v/Hl positively make, .his appearance.
