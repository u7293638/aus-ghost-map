TOc. Sjrjïyncj!! craft. TUESDAY, MAY 3, US, -9st 5 Sworn to no Matter, of no Sect am I." THE BANK ABSTRACTS. The last Government Gazette ghost, and I we republish in another column, the usual I quarterly *. General Abstract of the sworn Returns of the average Assets and Liabilities, and of the capital and profits of the several Colonial Banks, for the quarter ended 31st March, 1842. We propose to examine the Bank Abstracts for the last twelve months, that we may see to what extent they illustrate the progres- se state of our monetary affairs. And, first, as to the Abstract for the first quarter of the present year : we ar- range the Banks, under each head of the returns, in the order of their respective amounts, beginning with the highest.

It should not pass without special remark, that the Bank of Australia, concerning which there have been some very unfavourable rumours, here presents in regard to solvency, a most satisfactory aspect, its circulation being only 83 per cent, upon its capital, while * As we omit the shillings and pence, the turns total will slightly vary from the idea that of the Commercial is 218; its discounts only 154- per cent, upon its capital, while those of the Bank of New South Wales are 1906; and its assets 280] to every 100 of its liabilities, while those of the Bank of New South Wales are only 181 J. We now revert to the abstracts of the last four quarters, taking the grand total of the six Sydney Banks and the Bank at Port Phillip. CIRCULATION. 1841\. June 30_£223,008..

May we not flatter ourselves that these are symptoms of convalescing in our bod)' pecuniary ? We see that in the third quarter of last year the deposits decreased by £31, 239, and in the fourth quarter by the immense sum of 261 22,48 while in the first quarter of the present year they have in creased by the respectable sum of £628, 460. This is the first increase that has taken place since the climactic year 1840. Throughout the whole of last year the deposits rapidly diminished. In the first quarter, they were¿61,123,636 and in the fourth, as we have seen only 2694 7,350 ; being a decrease of no less thanes 176,286. We may therefore hope, that their increase in the first quarter of the current year, coupled with the increase of coin, and with the large decrease of discounts, are symptomatic of a more healthy condition of our money market. The diminution of discounts does not result from a less accommodating spirit at the Banks, but from a positive falling off in the demand for such accommodation. This arises from two causes- the total subsidence of the fever of speculation, and a growing conviction, forced upon the public mind by the stern lessons of experience, that neither the profits of trade nor those of farming and grazing will admit of the high rate of 11 per cent, interest for the use of capital to invest therein. This conviction is forcing its way into the minds of the Bank authorities, and they will soon have no alternative but to reduce their rates of discount, or to sacrifice their dividends. -
