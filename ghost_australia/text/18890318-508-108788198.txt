PABEAMATTA. The usual fortnightly meeting of the Parra matta Borough Council was held on Wednesday evening- last, the Mayor (Alderman F. Beames) presiding. The report of the works committee was received. It recommended that a crane be erected on the Queen's Wharf for the convenience of those receiving heavy goods by water. The lighting committee, in view of the important matters to be considered, stated that it required extension oi time betore bringing up its report. Alderman Taylor gave notice of a motion to the effect that he would move that the baths be leased, granting power to the lessee to lay down a floor for skating purposes. Two deputations were appointed, one to visit the Minister of Works with a view to getting the river dredged and deepened from the town wharf to the tram wharf; the other with a view^to urging on the matter of the sewerage works for the town. Alderman Taylor moved â€” That the Board of Health be re quested to make a careful analysis of the water supplied to the inhabitants, with a view to deter termvnrng whether it really was fit to drink. After a heated discussion the resolution was car ried. Some of the aldermen contended that Alderman. Taylor had raised all sorts of imaginary ghosts concerning the water supply. However, by the majority of the aldermen voting for the resolution, it can be taken that the water is not the crystal spring- some of the benighted aldermen would have the people believe. Mr. Henry Hud son was appointed arbiter for the council in the matter of a dispute about the ironwork in the baths and Market buildings. The nightcarts, whieh have been an intolerable nuisance, were ordered to be removed to the utmost limits of the town.
