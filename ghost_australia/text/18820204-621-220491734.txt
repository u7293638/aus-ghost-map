Australian Cap and Newmarket Handicap. By " Newmarket." The Wrights for the Australian Cup and Newmarket Handicap made their appearance on Monday last. Of course, there has been tbe usual amount of grumbling on the part of some owners of horses; but, on the whole, % consider that Mr. Barnard has been pretty successful. I have made a hasty glance at 6he«bances of the horses engaged, and at present will content myself by giving generally my idea of those best in, and whose (shances I fyncy most. Later on, when I have ascertained how the horses have stood their preparation!!, I will do my best to "tip" the winners. AUSTRALIAN £UP. Beginning with the top weight, Progress, gfc$at 41b, as be has been under a cloud for twiwi fiaiB. I, do not think be will put an appearance hut sb&xdd; he do so, and fit the day, there is eo asca aion to look any I further down the list. Swiveller, a rare I good horse, Is handicapped out of it, as I he has to give Wellington 61b, which he I cannot do. Courtenay has done remarkably I well since Mr. Fisher bronght him here from I Sydney. He curried 8st 51b in New Year's 1 Gift (one mile and a quarter), and 8st 91b in I Geriong Handicap (one mile and a half), and j appropriated both. He is by Yattendon — Mandragora, so for breeding . cannot be 1 beaten. He now has 8st 101b to carry the | two miles and a quarter. The question is, I Can he do it ? First Water proved what a I good animal he was by'winning this race last I year under 7st 61b in the fast time of 4min. j lsee. — fastest time on record — so I do not j see he is severely treated at 8st 81b. Martin- | dale cannot complain at his 8st 71b, and I I believe he is now all right again. Savanaka, I I think, has seen bis test day even with 8st 61b. Bathursfc and Creswick are fairly treated, and so is Hesperian. Guinea at 7st 6lb won the Geelong Gold Cup (two miles) easily, but 8st 31b — lllb more— and a quarter of a . mile further, will, I think, find the end of his tether. Still, he being by Fireworks from Rose of Denmark, speaks volumes in his favoor. Belladrum is not half a bad one, but the company too good, with his 8st 21b. ' Suwarrow was a brilliant three-year-old, and ran in front nearly all the way for the Melbourne Cup in Darriwell's year. Odd Trick was always a favourite of mine, and if shape goes for anything, staying is his forte, as well &b; weight- carrying, therefore 7st 131b ought not to trouble him ; besides his breed ing is first-class — by King of Clubs — Whirli gig. Waterloo and Royal Consort at 7st 121b each are badly treated. Bosworth, at the same weight, if at anything approaching his old j form, ought to have a show in ; but I am j afraid his day has gone by. Commotion has I had the screw put on him at only 2ib under weight for age ; but he is a Panic, ,and there I is no telling how long they can stay, as j witness Strop, Melbourne, Wellington, etc. Diamond is a good horse, but at 41b less would j feel better. The Czar has 1st lib more than j he had in the Melbourne Cup ; this with a j quarto: of a mile further, will not improve his j chance.. Chatterer, at 7st 91b, I do not deem good enough. Napper Tandy comes at the right end sometimes ; I do not think it will be this time with 7st 81b ; nor Falmouth either. The Champion winner, Coriolanus, if fit, and receiving 41b from Commotion, ought to be there or thereabouts. Sauntoer (7st%ib) ought to be in it up to his neck. Somerset, at the same weight, is leniently enough treated. He has been going to do great things I for some time ; perhaps this may be his time, but I do not fancy so. ?Fhe same may be | said of Monmouth and Albyn. Royal Maid is a stayer and of staying blood, so 7st 41b ought not to interfere with her. Santa Glaus, at the same weight, is a speedy one ; but can he compass the distance ? Crystal brings a good reputation with him. Warlock, at 7st, if all right and in his former form, ought to be somewhere handy. Koh-i-noor, i , at the same weight, reads well, but I have been much disappointed in him. He may shine bright some day ; no telling. From Turret- field downwards, including Sweet William, my idea is, the qualify is not good enough ; and the next on the lust, Sir Peter, at 6st 91b, is all there at the jumping business, but I cannot have him for the Cup. Gloucester, at 6st 61b, and Ween, at 6st 51b, are fairly treated, considering the latter carried 6st 21b in the Geelong Cup, two miles, and ran second to Guinea. Pollio, 5 yrs, at 6st 51b, is In the same stable as Commotion and Pell Mell, so I presume he has something in him. Narrabri was a fair colt. I do not think those below him are of sufficient quality to pass tbe judge's eye first, except it may be the renowned Duchess, of Melbourne and Geelong Cup fame (?). My selections are -r-First Water, Suwarrow, Saunterer, Creswick, Odd Trick, Waterloo, Koh-i-noor, Coriolanus, Royal Maid, Glou cester, Hesperian, and Ween. newmarket handicap.
