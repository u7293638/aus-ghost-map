TALES AM) SKETCHES J ? tAU Rights Reserved.] CHATEAUX EJJ ESPA6NE. By E. VARB.IK (Author of **TUe Better Man, &.c) I wish I could tell ' a story as I once heard it told by ray old friend, Crionel Chevenhc, at his beautiful place in \V ? shire. We were on. tie lawn— the whole house party— grouped under the shade of some great trees. The gentlemen were a little apart from us. and had &een; warmlv discussing some wonderful shooting feat of earlier in the day,. Presently someone spoke of a fair neighbour of our host* s who had figured prominently in the hunt ing field during1 the past season. AJJ chimed . in enthusiastically in praise of her beauty and pluck, but I noticed the Colonel said nothing either in praise or blame. One of them rallied him, sir-king if he did not admire his beautiful neighbour. ' Very much,** was his warm reply. 'But,' said his friend, laughingly, 'there is a * but ' you know. Colonel : what is it ? The Colonel Sdge'tted, j&d; looked across at his wife, while we aH waited, faintlv interested. 'She has blue eyes,' he said reluctantlv at 4ength. There was a shout of laughter, then a naUble of chaff, in which neither Che Colo nrf nor hie wife seemed to enter. Finally, one sharper than the rest nad an in=pira tion. **A story! — a storv!' be shouted. 't-Tuin-* Chair r The cry was taken up, there was a rush for seats — we were included willy-nilly in a circle with the Colonel in the centre* looking far more perturbed than the occa sion seemed to warrant. ' I think I must go in,' said Mrs. Che venix, hurriedly. But there was a storm of protestation, during which her husband looked at her imploringly. . ' I — I can't ; there U no etorr,* he said at length. Again the storm came. ** Must I, dear ?- he said to his wife She was bending over some light work in her liands and only nodded her head — almost imperceptibly. . The Colonel rugged at his long snousU thios uneasily. ** I do not 'like to speak of it quite,'7 he said presently, **S-nt you were right ; there is a story, and some of you may remember it — or the onlv version of it that was ever made public' And then he told us. I repeat 1 wish 1 could tell it as lie did, with the shades of meaning- and expression in voice and face. That is impossible ; bm the little recita) remained indelibly fixed in my memory, and if I wander from the tert slightly now and then, no one will cavil, for H impivsfed ane far loo much *t Uie time to allow of erring greatly as to the *nfljn details. * Many years ago my wife and I u&ed; to. spend six months in every year travelling on the Continent. You may have noticed that we no longer do so ; our taste for Continental travel ended with our visit to the Pyrenees in '62 'Few people know hour beautiful these mountains really are. but those who do do not hesitate to proclaim their knowledge, and it was from one of these enthusiast* we first had the idea of making a month or six. week.sT tour in the neighbourhood. I ? ]i~ed our most sanguine expeeLitioiis a* to ilioroui^li enjoyment : I cannot speak loo IiijrWy of iheJMMuiy of the scenery : €h«* facilities for ti-jvi-I I the many plaue» of histoik^ and 1or.il interest tre visiiti) and above all the equable and frequently bracing climate. We started for Pju iu the spring, an! met at the hotel tlicr* a party of three : too sister- and a brother of the nanic of Kenned v. who were pursuing the .?same route as ourselves, and with whom we fra ternised and travelled until— until the «..! of our tour. They were of Scotch extrac tion .and pleasant comnanv, uud we con gratulated' ourselves on the addition of their socielv- Tie two girts were typical &-otch lassies ; healthful, fresh as their out. breezy moors. Though we have ncvev mct ?bicE — why. you will £iit's« later on — we h«ard from * tinie to time of them, until iu fact they both were married. Th?y wcre good sifters, and honest friends, anil there i**n*t a doubt are happy wives as they doaened to be. Their brother, poor young feMow, died some years tack out in India. He was a *renera4 favourite, clever too ; n hit of an inventor. I 'liked the toy very much, and used to listen with interest to the many schemes he unfolded for inyj benefit, How enthusiastic he was!— poor,! poor young fellow. How Hltle we know ! ? —how little we ' know ! ~' ' From Pdu we visited Kanx-Bonncs. Cautereu. Luz, and many other places I have forgotten the names cf for the mo ment, coming finally to IbyneredeBi gorre. This, as you know, is one of the most fasUionaljle and thriving tovens iu the . Pvrenees, and we met a great many En#] Ush visitors at the hole! at which wej stayed. There was a. popular young couple there — Mr. and Mrs. Allington Rees, in whom my wife became very interested. They were Americans, and were travelling for pleasure like ourselves. They had been married three years, and had visited nearly the whole of Europe. Mrs. AHington^Ree^ was an orphan ; had absolutely no kith or kin ; perhaps that U why the affection between her and her husband was so great f — certain it is that the English-speaking visitors made their attachment to each other a peg on which to tiayig endless mild . jokes and little pleasantries — all of which ! were taken in good part by the young i couple themselves, and the vagaries of ; * the honeymooners * settled down into a i sort of stock joke, j ''Allington-Rees was the most itnnerturb abiy good-humoured man I ever met. No thing ruffled or put him out of temper ; his l-ig form and jolly sounding laugh were hailed everywhere with acclaim ; no party or gathering of any kind was complete without him, nor was his pretty wife less popular. She was a little thing, with a bright, happy temperament, and absolutely worshipped 'John.1 We were sdl in love with her ; she had her regular little circle of admirers and attendants ; the group on the verandah that counted her as member was always the merriest, and, truth to tell, the noisest. Xo one grudged her her popularity — with some to be popular is to be hated.* out t do not think she had A single enemy — I for one never heard an unkind word said a'boat her. I used to watch from a distance — it did one pood to see her so young, and bright, and gay ; more often than not her husband would be with me, and she would look across at him, and nod happily, and lie would nod back with a single, perfectly contest la see her so admired and courted. ** \Te3I, the time came for us to move on ; L ? n*as to be the nest stopping place, and when we heard that we could count on 'the honeymooners/ company not only to L ? , out further to Tculouse, and from t&ehce; to Paris, 1 don't knoir who was the most delighted. * We thoroughly, enjoyed our stav at L ? , and ' did' all the chief excursions in the neighbourhood : all. that in but one which, as it was most arduous, we had nut off and put off until out of very sham* we could do so no longer. This excursion was to a * port ' or pass, runhing from the Freucli side of the range into Spain. It was rather a iomr journey, obliging us to -tan quite early. We finally fixed a day for ft, though with more thVn one secret hope the weather would prove unpropt tious. Our hopes were not to be 'realised, however, and the morning — tbe very early morning by the way — tamed out bright and dear. . ** Early as it was a t-rowd . of fcegpars awaited to accompany us to the very csteps of the carriages witii whining appeals for help And charity. They -say the fceggus of the Pyrenees are not so numerous as in other placed of continental travel :' we alwars found a «reat number even-where. One, with a peculiarly iudeoua -complaint, was especiaH* tenacious ; we could not shake him off. Mr. Allington-Rees stooped and placed a piece of silver in his band : she tried to speak to him too. a -n-ord or two she bad picked up. The feidow state! up at the pretty lace bent pityingly over him t I fancy he was not used to such a sight — lie even seemed to forget the usual voluble expressions of thanks. Juet asshi got in the carriage ^e catied out to us. ''What doe-3 he sari' she asked cur iously. *' *Oh. the usual thing,* I answered, 'long life, and every bleeding.' *' tie went on tatlkSn?. however — ex-cn the drivcre turned to listen, and then glanced back at us.

The path ascended in one long wind against £be side of tike rode, and as we cjunfacd friguer sre began to fed a breeze. This became stronger, Mrs. Allington-Rees could no longer hold tip her pamsol, ojlI me aH had to cling on to our hats vith might and main. 'Then the real difficulty oT the ascent commenced ; the track vas steep and nar row, and covered with looee pieces of stone tiiat had a nasty knack of turning one's ankle if you did not take care how you placed your feet. 'We straggled lira rely on, Allington Iices helping his wife and one of the JUS Kennedys in front, bat vhen we came to a shelving plateau of cock by tbe side cf a little m/iqn»pin take (unconunon enoogh in ttese parts) 4here was a unanimous call for a halt. *~ We cast ourselves down with audible pants in as unexposed {KJsitions as we coidd find, for the wind was keen at this gnat attitude. What ne got- our breaths again, pjpes were lit, ajtd -the talk became gcufral. We admired the magnificent view, u'hioa was of a severer type than we had been accustomed Us of late— the vegetation nYis *{Muser, And of « hardier growth, and theic were even patches of snow here and there on the mountain side.' lfer down beloiv we could see the HcMpiee that af forded rough accommodation for travelers en route Sor Spain or France, £s the case might be : above us the mountain rose pre cipitously ; from where we eat at seemed impossible for anything to find foottiold on ils rock}' front. **Soon the convecsallon drifted into more intimate channels. We agreed as to the thorough pleasure ourJtra.rel in each others society had given, and arranged tat it to continue zs long as possible. I asked the Kranedvis to visit us here in the autumn, which tftev haif promised to do ?; about the AHit^rtcn-Bee; 1 was not so sure— I kneff they had planned going home for a month or -uto 'before the end of the year, however. 1 tfkrd tiieai, and my wife seconded the invitation. Mrs. Allington-Rees accepted at. once ; she had grown very fond of my wife, but her husband joked fter in bis good hu moured ivay : -'Sow, Tina.' he said, 'you will get youiself in a. mess, my dear, if you go on at this rate. This makes the third invita tion for September I- have myself heard you accept — and aU in different parts of the clobe.7 -?I don't care!' she returned stoutly, \- this is the only one I mean to keep ; I want to see an old English borne at dose quarters, and Mrs. Ghevenix is a dear!1 ^ We all laughed, and began -to epeak «f EnjrIMi country houses and castles. Mrs. Allington-Rees said she would take plans of our home for the purpose of reduplicat ing it in America, and Kennedy and I told weird tales of family ghosts and hauntt-1 granges, that only served to heighten her interest in the proposed visit. We went more carefully into the details of this, at Ringing innumerable excursions and plea snte parties, and generally talked ourselves into l2ie comfortable frame of mind that coiucs to people when they discuss a. fu ture to tie spent in each other's society. \- - Why do you not settle down in Eng land ?* ! asked tlie voung couple — ?' there is a litnle place near us that would just suit you. You do nSt seem so \~ery attached t-- your native land — try ours for a change, we should be delighted to have you as rM^fliboilT*.' -?Wlul ;.- i: called r— i* it pretiy !— !iou bi« is it V a-ked ^Irs.

Would you be haj^'J' in one place for long. I wonder, little one ?' ~ She was sitting by his side under the £ee of a great boulder. I saw her slip her hand through hi* aim and lean her face against his 6houldcr caressingly. * ?Cot without you, John,' s*e said softly, '?»?« should be happy together anywhere;' then to mo. ? Shall' we settle i( on our visit in the autumn ? — would tbat be too late ?' \- - Oil. no,' 1 reassured her. ' but we shall regnrd it as settled from now.' *' - We sUall see V nodding tw head sagely — 'ire shall see ! ' Suddenly she nude a discovery. * WTiy, she said, * if we had kept our talk about --a--~tli-s and things for a little higher up, it would have been a literal case of -chateaux en Sspagne!' ** We all laughed again — somehow one foil into the way of laughing at her re marks, and she got up, and said she would just have a look to see if the {lath were as bad as it had been. ** Sbe came back pre^entiy for one of the -Miss Kennedys, saying she had some thing to show her. '?-ie, too!' taid her husband lazilr. but she only laughed, and told him he mi»Blt inanted.

' Presently Allington-Rees began to fid get. I Affected not to notice. . ''Don't let us detain' you,1 1 said po litely at length, for noone likes to air one's views on matters jwtiticaj to perfectly in attentive hearers.

'It was blown backwards and forwards ; the wind seemed to' some from aB points at once ; we laoghea at iu erratic career, and cheered on the yur suer.
