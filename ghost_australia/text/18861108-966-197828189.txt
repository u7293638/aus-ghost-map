SPORTING. THE V.R.C. SPRING MEETING. FOURTH DAY. Melbourne, November 7. [By Telegraph. | [From our own Reporter.l The V.RC. were favoured with beautiful weather again on Saturday, and the attendance must have been quite equal to that on Derby Day. The Governors were again present. The racing was first-class, the meeting of Trenton and Trident in the Canterbury Plate being quite the most interesting leature of the four days. Game's defeat in the Steeplechase was a great disappointment, and altogether the favourites were unlucky, Britisher's defeat in the V.R.G. Handicap being brought about by the jockey of Brown-and Rose hitting him over the head with a whip, while the crack Game fell in the Steeplechase when looking a certain winner. The opening event was a mere canter for Volcano, whom Hales could not hold back to his opponents. The Fiemington Stakes proved a good thing for Casuist, who got all the best of a straggling start, and led the whole way. Silver Mine and Ben Bolt were scratched for the V.R.C. Handicap on the course, and favouritism rested with Brown-and-Rose and Britisher. The Ballarat horse should have won, but as he was mahiDg his running in the straight the rider of Brown-and-Rose accidentally nit him over the head with his whip, and Britisher throwing up his head and stopping Bravo was able to get away and score a lucky win by a length. The owner of Britisher protested against Bravo for cauBing the interference, but as it was clear that the rider of Brown-and-Rose was the sinner the objection was dismissed. The withdrawal of Contingent made the Steeplechase look a real good thing for Game, and odds were laid on the top weight. Lady Aehton made the running at a great pace from the fall of the flag, and falls began early, Lady Carrington coming to grief at the first fence. Mr. Pearson's mare held a long lead until near the turn for home when Game got on easy terms with her, but just as it looked as though he would win easily the top weight struck the fence, and after staggering for a moment he rolled over. Native waB nearly down ' at the same fence, and Curiosity falling at the last Lady Ashton was able to scramble home from Native, but the mare was terribly distressed at the finish, and had Game stood up he would probably have won easily. The great match between Trenton and Tridentfollowed. Both sides were very confident, but Trenton was slightly the better favourite of the two, despite the fact that owing to the hard state of the ground his trainer was forced to run him in thin plates while Trident was barefooted. Trident looked all the better for his Cup gallop, and directly the flag fell it became evident that the race was to be a very severe one. Tamarisk cut out the work at her top speed, and Hales kept Trident at the head of the others, while Trenton was last. In this order they ran for half the distance, when Cyclops took second place, but going round the hack Trident went after the mare, and Trenton headed Cyclops. A mile from home Tamarisk and Cyclops ceased to have any interest in the race, and Hales kept forcing Trident along, with Trenton in pursuit. Rounding the home turn Trenton was drawing up, and his friends thonght he would win, as Hales was hard at work upon the colt, but when Robertson challenged he found his horse unequal to catching Trident, who kept his advantage np the straight, and finally won rather easily in the fastest time on record in Australia. In the last few strides both horseB were eased off, or the time would have been even faster. There was some heavy betting on the last race, Lord Wilton and Kitawa being the favourites, whilst several others were heavily backed. Lord Wilton, who was kept in a very forward position considering his weight, had all the other favourites safe some distance from home, but at the distance HaleB brought up Hogmanay on the inside, and the favonrite being pretty well spnn out he was beaten very' easily by a length. Hogmanay was not backed much by the stable, and his victory wound up a very good day for the bookmakers. The following are the results:— THE MARES' PRODUCE STAKES, Of 100 sovs., with a sweepstakes of 10 so vs. each added. The second horse to receive 100 sovs. and the third 50 sovs. out of the stakes.

Casuist, Aberden, and Oceana, 8 to 1 Bedouin, 10 to 1 each Sumatra and Glentworth, 12 to 1 each Harridan and Yetman, 14 to 1 Esperance. Owing to the fractiousness of Esperance at the post the start was delayed some time, and when the flag fell the lot were scattered all over the course. Casuist obtained a great advantage, and came over the tan pursued by Liedertafel, Yetman, and Oceana. Entering the course proper Casuist was still in front, and although Oceana took second dace at the distance she could never catch Casuist, who won easily by a length and a half. Albert Loddon and Sumatra ran a dead heat for third place, with Nectarine and Liedertafel next. Time, 52J sec. THE V.B C. HANDICAP, ZOf 5 sovs. each, 1 ft., with 250 added.

The firBt to show as thev settled into their places were Brown-and-Rose, Ringmaster, 1 Jlaptrap, and theBe three were prominent at the distance, where Yellow Hammer went to the front and led past the stand, First Prince, Ringmaster, and Brown-and-Rose being next, with Sardius and Bravo at the head of the others, the last three being Grace Darling, Monte Christo, and Meteor. At the turn the positions were the same, but at the bridge Impulse headed Yellow Hammer, with Brown-and-Rose, First Prince, and Ringmaster Btill at the heels of the leaders. At the 7 - furlongs post Impulse was leading, First Prince with Grace Darling just clear of Ringmaster and Bravo, the next lot being headed by Lesbia and Brown-and-Rose, with Meteor still last. Grace Darling took command at the abattoirs, and led past the sbeds and along the bend, with First Prince, Impulse, JLcsbia, and Bravo close handy, and Brown- and-Rose, Britisher, and Monte Christo in (rood placcs. Entering the straight Grace Darling waB just clear of Bravo and First Prince, with Brown-and-Rose coming fast in the centre. Bravo quickly drew out, and Brown-and-Rose next, and at the distance Britisher challenged, but after getting t-j Brown-and-Rose he stopped, and though quickly set going again he failed to catch Bravo, who won by a length. Brown-andlloHe was a good third, with Claptrap, ttiusiriaster, and First Prince next, and Yelios* Hammer last. Time. 3 min. 13£ sec.

Betting—5 to 4 on Game, 5 to 1 agst. Native, 6 to 1 Lady Ashton, 8 to 1 Havelock, 10 to 1 Curiosity. Directly the word was given Lady Ashton went to the fiont and led Curiosity and Game past the Stand, and the mare drew away some distance at the first fence, over which she was followed by Curiosity, Game, Wicklifij Havelock, Native, and Moonlight in the order named, Lady Carrington falling. Lady Ashton increased her lead at the next fence, Curiosity going on second and Game third, the others all up with the exception of Moonlight, who was outpaced from the start. Passing the abattoirs Lady Ashton was followed by Curiosity at an interval of six lengths, the favonrite being double this dis tance away, with Wiekliff, Havelock, and Native running together. At the next fence Moonlight fell, and coming through the gap Lady Ashton had a long lead of Curiosity, with Game next. These positions were pretty well maintained over the fences in the straight, but jumping the logs Lady Ashton's lead had been somewhat reduced, and Curiosity, Game, Native, and Havelock were well together, but Wiekliff was beaten off. At the river the order was much the fiame, but the next fence brought down Havelock, and Game took second place, while Lady Ashton reduced her lead at the back through striking hard, and Native here headed Curiosity, and went on just behind Game. PasGing the abattoirs and sheds Game was gradually drawing up to Lady Ashton, but at the second fence from home he strack very hard, and after blundering along the ground rolled over, and got rid of Corrigan. Native also struck this fence, and Curiosity came down at the last. The accidents left Lady Ashton with good lead, and although she was terribly leg-weary in the straight, she managed to struggle home four lengths in front of the equally exhausted Native, Time, 6 min. sec. CANTERBURY PLATE, Of 10 sovs. each, 2 ft., with 400 added second, 100 sovs. Weight for age. Three miles. Hon. J. White's ch.c. Trident, by Robinson Crusoe—Cocoanut, 3 yrs., 7 st 3 lb. (Hales) Mr. W. C. Cooper's b.h. Trenton, 5 yrs.I 9 st. 61b. (Robertson) ... Mr. F. Henty's b.c. Cyclops, 4 vrs., 9 st. (Williamson) ...- ..;• ...— ~ Hon. J. White's b.f. Tamarisk, 3yrs.,6st. 21b. (Huxley). Betting—6 to 4 on Trenton, even money Trident, 10 to 1 agst. Cyclops, 30 to 1 Tama risk. Directly the flag fell Tamarisk shot to the front and led Trident and Cyclops past the Stand, Trenton lying last. The leader made the pace very fastrouading theturn and along the river she led Trident six length with Cyclops and Trenton following at intervals of two lengths. Tamarisk continued to force the pace from Trident, and there was no change in the positions until they entered the straight a second time, when Cyclops took second place, and was only two lengths behind Tamarisk at the Stand, with Trident and Trenton separated by the same distance. Tamarisk increased her lead again as they rounded the torn, and Trident joined Cyclops, The two favourites were now steadily making their way to the front, Trenton heading Cyclops at the bridge! and 7 furlongs from home Trident cut down Tamarisk, and almoBt simul taneously Trenton took second place. Tamarisk and Cyclops dropped further and further behind now, while the cracks were travelling at a tremendous pace. Hales kept driving Trident along at the abattoirs, and at the sheds he. had an advantage of two lengths, but racing along the bend Trenton appeared to be creeping np. Rounding the turn Hales was still forcing Trident along, ana as Robertson appeared to be sitting still, Trenton was maintained the favonrite when they entered the straight. For a few strides ,up the running Trenton looked like catching the leader at any time, but before tbey got to the distance Robertson pulled out his whip, and it was soon seen that Trident was to be tbe hero of the occasion, as despite the game efforts of the big horse he could never quite reach his younger rival, and Robertson easing off 100 yards from home Hales followed suit, and Trident cantered paBt the post a length in front. Cyclops was 150 yards off third, and Tamarisk cantered in last. Time, 5 min. 2oQ sec. FREE HANDICAP, Of 5 sovs. each, 1 ft., with 150 added.
