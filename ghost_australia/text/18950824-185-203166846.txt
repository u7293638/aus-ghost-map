ON THE FIELD. (BY SENTINEL.) The first of the extra V.R.C. meetings will take place at Flemington this afternoon. It has long been contended that, if more meetings were held at Flemington and Caul- field, and fewer on the proprietary courses, the best interests of racing would be greatly served. With fine weather, to-day’s fixture will decide matters, and I am distinctly of opinion that the result will be satisfactory. Visiting horses have been very unsuc cessful this winter. We have had them from Sydney, Ade laide, New Zealand, and Tasmania, but their luck has been dead out. Gold, Mitre, and Hermit, from Sydney, have gone back without a win. Several Tasmanians have come, and gone back ns they came. Nothing from Adelaide has won for a long time; but the performance of The Actress was a bit of a surprise when viewed through her win on returning home. After tailing off for two miles in the Caulfield National and pulling up, she did not appear to have a ghost of a chance in the Adelaide National. Such is the inconsistency of the turf, that exactly eight days after her inglorious defeat she wins the Adelaide National in the beat possible manner. Yes, there is a' difference between Caul field company and Adelaide. Just so, but not quite as much as the two performances would indicate. I suppose when her pilot saw Daimio, Medicine,'. Highborn, Romsdal, and Go. going so well he reckoned he had no chance, and that to pull up would give the owner a better chance with the machine and the mare a better chance in the race. Good judge; and sure enough it came out the way I have supposed it. With a run to-day, I give the Hurdle Race to Ro«“atem or Miller’s best. The Two Year-Old to Raak, with no reser vations. August Handicap to Eirisfo'rde or'Portsea. Steeplechase to Knebsworth or Floater. Handicap Plat Race to Hughie or Maluma.
