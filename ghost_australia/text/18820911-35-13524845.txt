THIRD DAY. Yesterday morning Pontifical Hill Mass was celebrated in the presence of an immense congregation, ever part of the cathedral being den etc packed, so that even standing room was with difficulty s cured The celebrant was the Rev Dr Cani (Bishop of Rockhampton), and his assistants were Rev Archpriest "Sheehy, assistant priest, Rev Father Collins deacon, and Rev Father Dunne, sub deacon the masters of ceremonies were the Rev Dean Divjerandtho Roy Father 1 Icmmg The Right Rev Dr Murray (Bishop of Maitland) preached a sermon based on the 15th and 10th verses of St Luke He dealt with the subject in three aspects- first, the mission of charity and mercy exhibited in the Catholic Church in the erection or shun lies throughout the world to the honour and glory of God secondly, the mission of charity and mercy of the Catholic Church as considered in the variety of her institutions throughout the world and thirdly, the consideration of the same mission offhand and meet j in the colleges and scheme Is which in all ages and at all times, and never more than in the present age, the C bul eh had made it her business to erect mull parts of the world In referring to the latter portion of his subject, the preacher said that he did not desire to utter a single word that could be offensive to any man, or to any church of any other denomination, At the end of this year all State aid would be withdrawn from the Catholic schools The Archbishop hid on sever ii occasions spoken on the education question in connection with the building, and on one occasion in particular he said - My dear people, no have a great work before us we o have this church to build but I tell you when we have done with this church, we have a far greater and more important work before us He (Dr Murray) was not afraid, and would not hesitate to say what he had to say in the Archbishop a pro ease He knew he was repressing his Grace's sentiments, and he knew that the temporal arr inDcmcnts had been made in c consequence of the more important issues at stake on-the education question they had been told over by people within the Church, of the great rum that would come upon them in consequence of this change which was to take place at the end of the year ago, he for one, and he know every prelate who was there shared the same view as he did, looked upon it as in act of revenue, but by no means as a calamity as a rum to the Church The Catholic Church had her power still Of our she had erected institutions for the benefit of all classes of "men and women, and she would be able in this emergency to meet all the exigencies The Catholic prelates, the Catholic clergy, and the Catholic 1 city of tin-, t colony, and indeed 1 of Australia would become one united body determined to carry on the schools and determined I > sat alice everything rather thin abandon them An appeal had never been made in any c justly, much less to lead Catholics, in the ground and of faith that had not be n generously responded to There was a time when State and was withdrawn from the clergy of this country, and by many that were regarded as a fatal blow struck. it Cithohatj Had the Catholic Church in this country suffered from the ashtrays al of State aid to the clergy of At one time State and was given for the purpose of electing churches He believed there were many churches in this colony erected partly by the genesis of the public and pal ty by Government aid, for at one time, he believed, the Government "five pound for pound and had all disappeared but bid the Catholic churches dis- appeared Ã­ Had they not multiplied and increased a hundredfold 1 Was it not true that Catholic churches and institutions had sprung up everywhere. He would say to those who, being of little faith, had said, " What will become of our schools-how will we sip portthein'r"-he would say to such that if the Church exercised her. power she could support all her children. Let them have two years, or it might be three years, and this would not be a town in all the colony of New South Wales that would not have its Catholic schools. They would have Catholic books, and religious brothers, and religious sisters established every where, and all the fire they would be doing the work of the Church. He hoped that not a bishop, priest, or layman would ever say a word of abuse either of any Government or of those of any other denomination who might be abusing the UnUiulic Church. There was a remarkable passage in the Book of Ecclesiastes which he would specially bring before this vast congregation, viz., " Strive for justice for thy soul, even unto death; fight for justice and the laird will overthrow thy enemies for thee." God called upon the Church to strive for justice, but did not call upon the Church to destroy her enemies, or to indulge in abuse. God said, " Leave that to me, and I will overthrow thy enemies." Let the Catholics erect their schools and go" on with their churches peacefully and quietly, but with great firmness and Zeal, and with great moderation, and all their difficulties would be overcome, and all these enemies against whom they had to contend would be overthrown by the Lord. He was very glad that he had an opportunity of bringing that text before this vast congregation, and which he trusted would serve as a guide to prelates, priests, and people with. great struggle in which they would have to engage in the coming year. He would add a few words in reference to this important occasion. Speaking for himself and he believed he spoke for his brother prelates and for the Catholic clergymen and the Catholic congregations he had to express his appreciation of the unbounded zeal of the Archbishop in the cause of this church. The grandeur and splendour of these ceremonials which he (Dr. Murray) had witnessed here, and the like of which can never before been witnessed in the Southern hemisphere, had been very impressive. He had great knowledge of those ceremonies, having spent his life among them, and witnessed their performance in the greatest grandeur. He could, therefore, say with authority that the majesty of the ceremonies performed on this occasion reflected the greatest credit upon the very rev gentleman who had c h use of them. He had never witnessed any where outside Louie, i ceremony carried out with such dignity and such order He, in common with others had been delight d he vinci measure with the music He did not claim an iiiqiimntuwo with music and therefore he could not speak with any author on the subject, but he had made his duty before he went into the pulpit to ascertain from others c superior to form an opinion, that the music was perfect in most respects, and reflected the greatest credit upon those who had the management As far as he could judge there were some portions of the music played there that day and the din before better than which he never heard either in St I events of the Sistine Chapel at home The eccles! street procession poured in trout the principal western entrance while the " Induum " m arch was being I performed by the orchestra and when the difference had taken their places on the sanctuary the familiar opening strains of Mozarts I Twelfth Mass were heard the beautiful and grandly impressive " Kyrie' was sung by the ' clKiiusviftli treat power and yet with exquisite deficit) of expression, and the chorus parts in The ' Gloria " more nearly approached absolute grandeur and technical perfection than anything ever heard previously in the Roman Catholic churches of Sydney in the triumphant opening, '. Gloria in excelsis Deo, the voices of the full chorus united youth strings, reeds, and grasses of the orches- I tra, and strengthened by the powerful tones of the organ, produced a dense and splendid volume of sound that rolled like a stately pine through and through the vast building, filling nave, males, and transepts with bright hair morn). And again, in the glorious fugue, "Cum into Spintu the singing and playing were marvellously corrected expressive This ponderous and difficult movement is full of fire, and when it is performed as it was at St Mary's by a large and well-trained chorus and a thoroughly) efficient orchestra, both directed by a competent musician, its majestic beauty not only delights the ear, but touches the heart and moves the soul in the ' Credo" and the remaining portions in the mass the chorus sang with great vigour precision, and expression, and it would be difficult to speak too highly of the quality of the work done by the orchestra, and by the organist, Mr I Banks Miss E A Moon, Mrs Banks, Miss Hunt, Miss _s I Nowlan, and Messrs Innes Ilmchv, 1 O'Sullivan F J Hallen til, M.

Immediately before the Credo was commenced Mr. Hallewell s ins in noble style Neukcomn's' Confirma Hen Dens," and the musical performances of the morning service in every respect a triumph terminated with the Hallelujah'' chorus, vigorously given. The music of this service was the best performed during the Triduum, and all engaged in it merit high praise no one more so than Mr. Te none), the able and zealous industry to whose skill and judgment must be mainly attributed the pronounced and gratifying . sun i ess achieved by the united Roman Catholic choirs The members of the committee, too-Messrs J A dread, L.

When we asked ourselves whether that precept, "Abide in my love," was obeyed, we were met by the lamentable fact that it was disobeyed and treated with cold at ss and contempt But that very fact impelled those who already loved Ulm to love him with twofold depth and two-fold greatness The children of the Catholic Church had been taught from their childho d to love the sacred heart of Jesus ships would this evening have an opportunity of show and that desire to love r Jesus is with redoubled strength for the Ar< bishop was about to dedicate himself and his people in this arch June n to the sat led heart of Jesus. increased in to the Ble<=Â»e<l \ train M try in whose name this cathedral hall 1 au considered and by who o bl wng it would be completed, and who had even Jmus his human heart, because she had given him his humanity, would dm v down from the Holy Ghost renewed blessings on this -great work and this diocese In contemplating the humanity of Jesus they adored him even as the wine men and the angels adored the in in Christ Jesus. 1 hire was a peculiar lines in choosing the sacred heart of Jesus for adoption, because the heart was the dwelling place of the affections through that heart goodness was roy sealed, and when Jesus showered by sings on his loved ones all the of blessings came from his heart His love, His mercy, His company n resided in His heart, and hence it was that we found in the sacred heart of our Lord an object of loving adoration But, unhappily, Jesus was not universally loved for he had been warred against from the very beginning * Those enemies might be grouped in four classes-corruptera of doctrine, the persecutors, who in- fill ted paper mill de iib civil powers who, by hampering the action of the Church, prevented the progress of the kingdom of grace, and withdrew south from God, and finally, Catii dies win 12 1 loved in God but did not love Him There had been corrupted of doctrine from the very first century, and they had continued to the present day, until the list of the sects was ludicrous in its character and extraordin- ary length One of the great causes of regret in connection with this perversion of doctrine was that there were so many good men unions the pery cried, There were among the Protestant denominations those who were s i good and so virtuous that it was in matter of deep relict that they did not share with the Catholics the grace of being members of the Church - that they did not brisk, as the Catholic people did, in the full effulgence which came from the divine heart of Jesus Christ in every country in Europe there were impious legislators, who scoffed at the name of Jesus. One method of striking a blow at the Church was through the education of the children They knew that Christ and, " butler little children to come unto me," and they on dear your ed to repel those children They knew that if the children were brought to the feet of Jesus they would learn to love His name, hence they endeavoured by legislation to draw the childicuawaj from grace, and drive them to infidelity, This was an act of persecutor, an act of war which the Catholics would resist with their lives if it should be necessary It sometimes happened that, unhappily, weak Catholics went over to the other side, and aided such legislation this, more than anything, else, afflicted and pained the heart of Jesus, and of those who loved and those enemies of the Catholic Church, who thus made war up in the Church merely imitated the tactics of warners in all ages by her over the en tia attacked a Lit) the) know that there was an element within the city upon which they could depend for iss tune that there were a few who were weak and prepared to betray their citizens the buying over of such renegades was one of the tactics of those who made war, and hence the enemies of the Catholic Church calculated on the assistance of similar renegades in the very bosom of the Church Such renegades were found amongst the members of the legislature, and resisting the voice of conscience, and despising the voice of the head of the Church and the voices of their own immediate sisters, they sold them eh as to the enemy What was their reward I PromaLun of some kind, some temporal advantages, and the smiles and favour of the enemies of the list) C ilhohc Chur li W hat a position for a Catholic to hold he rev gentleman concluded with an exhortation to Catholics to be true to the Church and strong in their ian- the \itcinilMiui then advanced to the steps of the sanc- tuary and requested The congi legation to join him in reading (he Act of Concur Union He suggested that in doing so they should point this contention by some distinct di ter lunatics. They were all aware that the principal reason of by how is J nest of this diocese and had been so earnest in endeavouring to roof this building and pay for it, was that they would have to meet a very heavy difficulty, to which the Hisblip of Maitland returned that morning in such splendid language, and which they were determined by God's grace to meet with all the courage which they possessed He begged this in order that they might show their led eunestiie-,3 in the consecration of the Church of the decade to Christ, and that they would promise and, whilst making this act of consecration that they would do all that lav in their power by the influen got their words and by the influence of their lives, to assist in the great work that the Church would engage in at the | end of this year, when they would lose the sum of Â£5000, which was at present paid to the Catholic schools in order a trifle might show them his sincerity he would tell them what he had determined to do, and what he had determined to do when he first began, with the help of the people-to roof in this great cathedral It ought to be the case that this great cathedral would bring in a large income He promised them that when the place has been kept in repair posy ten and c thedral and the pi tests had I once had their stipends, the whole of the income of this cathedral us long as they were in this difficulty, would be handed over by him to the schools of this city died, to Jesus) to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ that these were not mere words and that he was not going to rest with the mere expression of the determination that he had within him of sp riding himself and J being spent in doing what lay in his power i to print in the hints of the young the blossom of hope, and 1 that the i might be brought up to know and love and seize God in this world, and be happy with him for ever in the next. He had not the slightest doubt that according to their means or measure he clergy of this diocese would follow his example, and he believed that the laity, seeing that the bishops and priests were in earnest, would follow their example, and thus, whether helped by the State or not, they would present the world that though money was very power 1 as, there was something which was higher and stronger than money, and that was principle Ilia love by which they were animated would animate the in with still greater earnestness in the future, when they had made this course of action to the sailed heart of Jesus He begged of them to determine to use all their influence and all the means they possessed, as far us they could do so fails to advance, when the time came, the interests of Catholic education in this ercil- done so The ceremony of the dedication of the archdiocese to the sacred heart of Jesus was then performed by the Archbishop In the list of the committee published on Saturday the name of W P M McMahon, J P was misprinted Monohan At the evening service the Gregorian vespers and Roman litany were again used. Humtnel's " Alma Virgo " was sung by Miss Sherwin and the chorus, the solo voice being for the first few bars rather flat, but subsequently perfectly managed. The dignified finale was a musical treat. Mr. Brewer sang an " O Salutaris," composed by the conductor, Mr. J. A. Delaney- chastely beautiful work which displayed to full advantage the range and power of the singer's voice. Mrs. Flynn, who seemed to be suffering from cold, was ineffective in the "Tantum Ergo," (Pacini.) As the ecclesiastical procession left the sanctuary, Mr. Hinchy and the chorus sang Zin-rarolli's "Laudate" in capital style, and the last service of the Iriduiim closed, as the first had commenced, with Mr. Delaney's stately march. It may be noticed that the Bishop of Maitland, in his sermon during morning service, paid all concerned a high compliment for the manner in which the music had been performed during the triduum.
