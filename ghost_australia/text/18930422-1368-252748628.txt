A. Ghost Episode. . ' A ghost appeared on the Baulkham Hills TObda few evenings ago to a love- sink pair returning from Parramatta. . Tbe girl attempted to faint and was only revived on -the assurance that it was a pumpkin vnth a candle in! it. l : Then ahe put it'down to jealousy on the part of other male friends.—Not bad. Tbe waits between the Tableaux at the Chrysanthemum Show were rather too long. It was a pity, too, that a steady light was not kept, during the whole time the tableau was exposed, on the Angel group. Tbe stall under tbe gallery was generally voted the best bower—at the Show. Mrs. Burns' address was as graceful as appropriate to the occasion. Mr. Purchase (Somerset Nursery) had sent along some Chrysanthemums, worth going hundreds of miles to sec. In reply to the Smithfield and Fairfield Council the Association states, that an owner of tenanted prpperty can pay the rates thereon and|hua deprive- the occupier of bis vote.
