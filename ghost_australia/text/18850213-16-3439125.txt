BOWEN. [FROM OUR OWN LOItllSSl'ONDIi.XT J FEbruary by 9 THE disappointment experienced in regard to railways has not quite broke the spirit of the Bowen people jet A number of gentlemen have subscribed £200 for the purpose of prospecting for gold and other minerals in the Bowen district This sum was to be subsidised by the GCA ei nment to the extent of two to one, making a total of £000, which was deemed sufficient to fully test some favoured spots The directors were elected, and a manager appointed Everything was in apple pie order for a start But a difficulty sprung up before a start was made (always a difficulty with the Government as far as Bowen is concerned) The money would only be paid as the work proceeded, and reports sent in, and a lot of irritating delays and bother which could be easily done without, and which were not insisted upon in the case of Maryborough There the money was subscribed, and the Government handed over their share without any trouble Why should any difference be- made ' That's what we want to know If the thing is to be done in a certain way treat all alike, but to give it to one and withhold from another, or impose vexatious conditions, is not even handed justice as we understand the word Nor is it the way to I encourage people to develop the resources of the colony The diamond drill has been shifted from its position at the immigration barracks, where it has lain idle for the I last six months, and is now fairly on its way to the coal field We protest against anything happening which may cause a hitch in its mission, and against any other stupid blunder to give a pretext for de- laying the tabling of the plans of our railway immediately the House meets The stupid blundering that caused railways to be started from or en roadsteads, when good harbours were available, Ins caused the country enormous loss of public money in the past, and will ever remain a tax for the future Mr Nisbet's report should be enough to open the eyes of any Government. To compare the money the Townsville that bom has cost, and the money yet required, with the insignificant amount requisite to dredge alongside our pier head, so as to give a depth of 15ft. or 17ft. of water at low water, is to show plainly that there has been a fearful blunder made in choosing a port for the trade of the district Instead of taking a lesson and trying to reform, it appeals as though matters are to go on, and whatever the cost the country must bleed and no attempt be made to apply a remedy for the cup At the nomination for seats in the Wanga latta Divisional Board, no candidate care for it and for No 3 subdivision, which is the fin thesticmoved from the seat of Government Mr Isbell, a tin of ty and energetic citizen, who combines the remunerative calling of butcher to that of France, was returned unopposed for No 2 For No 1, the liner subdivision, there are two aspirants for the honour of representing the electors Mr Strickland, an old resident publican, and Mr Stinbiough, who is a storekeeper, and appeals to be pushing ahead fast on the road to become one of our local merchants by and by The municipal elections passed off very quietly, Mr Isbell, one of the retiring aldermen being re elected, and Mr Field an old and respected townsman, albeit somewhat peculiar in his notions, but nevertheless esteemed for his desire to do justly according to his lights was returned unopposed Mr Field has occupied a seat in the council before, so that he may bring a certain amount of export fence to assist in the deliberations of that august boil) A meeting was held on Friday evening in the town hall for the purpose of forming a separation league for this district. There was a good attend mee and over forty new noun tinted as members twenty of whom are to be elected In order that the re- ague should be as representative is possible twelve me to be elected for the town and eight for the country, and the candidates are to be balloted for Out of those nominated it will be easy to pick out twenty good men and tine who are space unionists to the backbone, in fact ninety tune per cent. no score unionists in this district "It is in the mud the it blows nobody any good " is a very old saying an I perfectly true At any tale the gardeners and funnels of the Bowen district have a right to be thankful to the cyclone of twelve of months ago for having ltd them of a terrible scorn go Before that senior able storm which made such havoc everywhere, the flying foxes net e m myriads, and used to do? the sky for miles of an ox owing in going in quest of food Since the stone there is not the ghost of one to be seen, and it is believed they were totally dispel used by being blown out to sea, as they made their way to their home amongst the mangroves on the coast on the morning of the cyclone The weather is everything to be wished for for garden and farm operations there has been no very heavy rain yet, only light showers just sufficient to keep the soil in a good work able state
