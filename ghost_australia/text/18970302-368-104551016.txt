"A Christmas Carol in Prose." An interesting recital of Dickens' " Christmin Carol" was given by the Rev. G. C. Proriyal, of Albury, in the Wesleyan Lecteroe.hal oi Monday evening. There was t \'et: lo go attendance, and Mr. . IoLoo,+ prvic'ted. '?tio proceeds are to be dlevoted tlio i esleyais circuit fund. The rov. y.editleman gave a remarkably clever pourtraynal of the various characters in the Carol, and as an elocutionist it would be hard to find his equal. He possesses a voice of line quality, and his ~opora of mimicry are perfect. His roeioqetatwip of querulous old Scrooge was cr ollcit, tihe reciter never once, in depictitg the many other characters which intervened, diverting from the voice, the oet;one, aund gcicral demeanour of the old skinfliat. 1isn eo, eptions' of Marloy's Ghost, old SerOogo's nephew, Bob Cratchit, old Fezziwig, and others were good. Perhaps one of the best scenes which the reciter gave was that where old Scroogo is con duated to the graveoyard and is shown his own te"obstone, and his subsequent awakening to find that it was nothing butt a dream. In this lr. Percival showed to advantago, his interpretation being of the most vivid and lucid description imaginable. Bob. Craithit's Christmas feast, at wvhich the goOse was devoured, was amusinr,;y dealt with, and much appreciated by the atelience. During the evening a short musical programme was given, the following persons contributing :-Song, "The Gift," Maiss . Pitinoy ; song, "The Kerry Dance," Hiss E. Warnio; song, "Listening," Miss I. Oliver ; fluto solo, " Andanto and Polacca," eov. G. O. Percival; song, "The Outpost," Mr. i'. Lake. Hiss Pain acted as accompanist. On the nmtion of Mr. H. O. Cox, seconded by Mr. J. Lurasdon, a hearty vote of thanks was accorded the reciter.
