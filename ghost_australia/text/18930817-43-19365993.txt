I awaited, and he conducted me to a crazy, old, balf-tiaibercd house. Ions; since • pulled down, in the Fnufcourg St. Germain.

This, being on the nine s ido ns tho window, was barely distinguishable in thtt deep shadow, and presented a strange, sp;ct:e-lil;e appear ance. Tho other coraer, on the tamo side, was occupied by the nrt:*t"<? ca-'cl and canvas, behind which was a lay figure drcc.cd in a complete suit of armour, ut:d prasp injj in iUi extended Sst a truncheon, reminding me of the ghost of Hamlet's father. In the remaining corner" stood anclher figure.' which was cotered with a Lirce mass of crimson iircprry. apparently tojjrotect it from the dust. .AH about the room, wherever space permitted, were piled fragments of old armour, with swords, pistols, halber.s, and other weapons in picturesque disarray. After showing me several of his paintings, whicb were not indeed works of very high merit, M. Vcnier asked me if I would take a cup of coffee.

A thrill of de!i^.i..ul surprise ran through me as I recognised in her the unknown one whose beauty bsd to profoundly impressed me on that memor able morning. ■ '.'Permit n, Cj " « a ; ( i he—" Monsieur Clayton, my daughter Mademoiselle Annette Terrier." I bowed, m;d the young lady returned my jbeifance with consummate grace, blushing •lightly as fhe did so. Then sho with irtw, after handing us our coffee and cigar sties. I prolonged my stay rather inordinately, In the hops that Mdlle. VenU-r would reappear, but she did not, and I took ay leave at length, resolved to use every means for becoming better acijuninted with her. Ono day i met SI. Vcrricr in the taf as before, and our conversation happened to torn upon games. I mentioned that I was fond of ecarte, and asked him if he ever played. " "Alas! not now, monsieur," replied fee. "Foryou see I hare'to be at work every hour of the daylight; and my physician does not permit that I go out in the evening, on account of my asthma, so I am obliged to give up my game." "But surely, monsieur," said I, "your friends might play with me in your own rooms}" "I have no friends," said he, "who care to spend their time in amnsing an old man. Ah, no! most persons can find more lively diversions than that. No matter; I must not complain, for I have a treasure indeed in the society of my beloved daughter." I hinted pretty strongly that I at least would be only too happy to play with him. " Well then, monsieur," said he, " since you are so good as to say so, if you will name any evening that shall be agreeable to you. it will give me great pleasure to take a band with yon." I raggested the same evening, at any hour he pleased. ■ "Shall we say nine o'clock then," said he. " And if you will do me the honour to sup With me " I accepted gladly, and overwhelmed him with a profusion of thanks. What happiness ! I should see Annette—should converse with her, and should be able to strengthen the favourable impression I already believed toyseli to have made. . 11. Verrier rose to leave the tafi, mutter ing in a half-audible tone as he did so : "I must remember to pet some cards, for I have not a pack—so Ion; since I have played!" ,' " Pray do not trouble yourself, monsieur," I exclaimed, " for, as it happens, I have two new packs at my hotel." He thanked me, and walked out. Just then the proprietor of the cafi, a fat, jovial fellow, who bad been removing some glasses near v* during our conversation, turned to me with a smilo— ; " ilonsieur must b» rich," he remarked, "topUy with M. Verrier." "Indeed!" "Ay. For it is his humour to play high. Also it is his humour to win." What did I care for that! Even if I lost a few louis, the interview with Annette would more than repay the sacrifice. I resolved to humour M. Verrier for one even ing at least. The time came, and on my arrival I wai ushered by my host into a small and barely furnuhed room, where a table was hud for two. Our supper was very simple; it consisted of bread, cheese, and salad, with red wine. Annette attended upon v«, mixing our salad and pouring out our wine. She wiu pnler than usual, and the absence of colour in her cheek rather served to heighten the indescribable air of uoblcut that pervaded all her movements. I dow had to submit to a disappointment lor which I had been wholly unprepared. Holding out her hand to me, she wished me ion coir. She was going to retire for tho rest of the evening. ' It might have been partly owing to the wine, but I felt unusually bold, aud as I took the Illy hand in my own I pressed it to my lips. "So kind of you," she murmured, softly. : "She is an angel!" I roia to myself, •' an angel of gentleness and filial affection. She has no thought—no care for herself; aha only studies her father's happiness." She turned to co, and—l hardly knew bow I nerved myself to ray it—l wondered at my own temerity afterwards: " You are quitting my sight, mademoi selle," I exclaimed. In impassioned tones, " but yonr image will remain enshrined in my heart for ever." An interval of silence then ensued. My companion did not invite conversation, and I was not disposed to talk. I wan thinking of Annette. I now told myself that I loved tier—yes, this feeling mmt be love, for i' "Come, thoi, monsieur, said M. Vtnf^f at length j "ehall we play?" I a<<cnleri, and he led the way to th* »tudio. Everything there was precisely «} I had ftrn it on the previous .occasion. hi. Vtrricr motljtir-'l me to n chair, where. I seated myself facing the easel, which wai covered * with a Urgo white wrapper. Behind it loomed the mysterious figure in armour, while the Appolto was oo myjijrht and the skeleton on my left .M. Verrier now removed tho wrapper from the easel, disclosing to my viowan unfinished sketch, in oil?, of his daughter Annette. As I gazed at tho portrait, a few me» herent expressions of admiration broke from ma M. Verrier smiled, and drawing up a smnll table towards me, placed wine and glasses upon it, and took his seat facing lac. The game commenced ; we played high, and I seemed to lose about three hundred fmnrji in no time. I was a good player, but I did not pay sufficient attention to th« c:ird«, partly from a (ici-ire to indulge my opponent in his humour, but chiefly because my'thoughts were running upon Annette, and my vvc.i continually wandering to b«r L , ;< triut upon tho <M«cl. .M. Verrier jnuhcred up my stake with tha cool indifference of the veteran game ster. "It is better to piny thus than in com pany, where they, bet upon the cards and advise you what to p!ny, is it not, monsieur !" said, he. I expressed concurrence; but there wa» something in his tone tliat.l did not like. 1* seemed to convey n covert sneer at my want of skill, and I determined to play my very best. I now won a few games, and SI. Verrier for the first tiiuo challenged me to bet. £ dill so, and lost heavily. The artist played n» if he hnd known every card in my hand— n specie* of knowledge that is of transcen-* ! dent value at icttrti. I began to saspect that I wn? being made the victim of some trickery, though of what nature I could not gae!>*.

I resclveJ to watch him, and, if possible,' find out. My hand consisted of the qncen, eight and' seven of clubs, and the knave and nine of. diamonds. In taking up tlieoe cards 1 had scarcely made v movement of tho elbow, and yet I could see, in the spectacle glasses of M. Vcrricr, the reflection of something in brisk motion behind my chair. Angry and eusgjicious, and almost for« getting for the moment that tho man before me ra the futiier of Annette, I turnfd sharply round, ami was jujt in time to catch sight uf n human hind, holding five carda spread fan-wise, rapidly disappear:.!;; under the foids tif the criircsM drapery that coven-d the figure in the corner behind me.
