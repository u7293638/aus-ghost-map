Cn.\i ii u XXX. — A Hose of Medicine fou Clare. ' Is the pirl mad 'r*' exclaimed Lady 'Oenver. ' What does she inean r'' **J iiu an, ninmina,' cried Clare, with spirit, ' that 1 will nut — 1 cannot marry Sir Ui'iiiitloy Wjiters.' ** Ctare, you'll break my heart,*' cried her ladyship. '. 'Tom, this is your fault for blinking tbat wicked young mail to the ho»;w?.' ' What— \N liters :-' said Tom, sneer ingly. '''^o, no, no, my boy,*1 said L-rd AntLony, rubbing his leg. ' Your mamma means John iiuish, and I — I — I — damme, I can't understand it all about him. I'm sure I — 1 — 1 — don't think he's such a block devil as he's being painted.' Clare darted a look of gratitude towards him, and then one of reproach at her brother, who stood biticg his nails. 'Anthony, will you leave that leg alone,*' cried her ladyship. ' You give me the creeps ; and if you cannot talk sensibly, hold your tongue. Everybody knows, even Tom, if he would only speak, that this man — Pah ! I cannot utter his name — is de graded to the utmost degree ; but he has managed to play upon a foolish girl's heart, and she is blind to his wickedness.** *' Mamma/' cried Clare, ' I am not blh:u ; and I trill not believe these calumnies.' 'ttelievo them or not, my word and jour papa's are pawed to Sir Urantley Wiltere. Your trosseau is ordered, and jou will be his wife in less than a fortnight now.' Clare turned pale, and glanced at Tom, who stood biting his nails, and then at her father, who grew more wrinkled and rubbed his leg. She then turned to Tryphie who^e look was sympathising but meant no help. She felt that she was alone, and, even in these nineteenth century days, being as helplessly driven into marriage with a man she detested as if in the days of old chivalry when knights and barons patronised ironmongery for costume, and carried off captive maidens to their castles to espouse them before thaveu friar, or else dispense with his services. ' Clare, said her ladyship then, ' 1 wished to spare your feelings, and if you had been lees recalcitrant' — that was a word that her ladyship had beeu hoarding up for the occasion, and it rather jarred against her second best set of teeth as she used it ; it was such a hard, stony word, and co threatening to the enamel — ' 1 should have have kept this back, but now I must toll you uiai i or your papas and my own satis faction, we have hud enquiries made as to tliie— this— Mr. lluish's character, by an ia partial person, and you shall hear from lis lips how misguided you have been.' - Clare turned pale, but setting her teeth, *he threw her head up and remained defiant and proud. -attiB 'After hearing this, I trust that your cense of duty to your parents will teach you to behave to Sir Grantley Witters more in accordance with your relative positions, tie does not complain, but I can often see that lie is wounded by your studied coldness.** ' Not be ; d — -d sight too hard.' ' Tom,' said her ladyship, ' I bad hoped that your visit to purer atmospheres taken at the expense of your papa, would hav# had a more refining influence upon you.' ' So it has,' said Tom, sharply ; ' but if you keep on making use of that worn out cad's name, I oiiut swear, so there.' Her ladyship did not reply, but pointed to the bell, and Lord Anthony dropped the hand with which he was about to caress his leg, and toddled across the room and rang, *iureptiiioufc]y feeling in one of his pockets directly after, to sec if something was safe. Tryphie Wilder crossed to her cousin and took her band, whispering a few consola tory words, while her ladyship played the Leaving billow a little as she settled herself in Lor chair in a most magisterial manner. ' I'obins,*' said her ladyship, as the butler entered, ' has that gentleman arrived '?' ?' lfeen here five minutes, my lady. He is in his lordship's study.' ' Show him up, Robins, and we are at home to no one until he is gone.' The butler bowed, went out, and re turned with a tall, rather ungainly man in black, who had something of the appear ance of a country carpenter who had taken to preaching. He had a habit of buttoning his black coat up tightly, with the conse quence that it made a great many wrinkles round bis body, and though he was fully six feet high, you felt that these wrinkled were caused by a kind of contraction, bin body being of the nature of a concertina bel lows, and tbat you might pull him out to a most amazing extent. lie favored this conceit, too, by bein£ very cartillagiuous in the spiue, and sofcly pressing his hands to his breast, and biw* ing and undulating gently in different directions to the party assembled in the room. '* Hang him !** muttered Torn, scowlinj at the new comer. ' lie looks as if he were in training for a serpent. Who the deuce is he r' 'Tom,** whispered his lordehip, 'that man makes me feel queer ; get some brandy ar.d soda in your room after he is gone.*' Tom favored his father with a peculiar wink, and the old gentleman felt in his pockets once more to be sure that he had not flung something out with bis handker chief. ' Mr. Irkle, I think r' said her ladyship, blandly. ?* llurkle, my lady,*' said the new arrival, bowing; *' llurkle & Slant, Murley-court, Strand.' ' 1 think we need no preliminaries, Mr. llurkle,1' said her ladyship. ' Perhaps you will favor me by reading a few notes from your diary .'* ' Thank you, my lady ; yea, certainly,' said the new arrival, taking out a large Hut pocket-book, and then getting into dOticul ties with his gloves and hat, setting the latter down upon a chair and putting the former in his pocket, then altering his mind and taking the gloves out of his pocket, dropping one and putting the other in his hat, which he took up and placed under the chair instead of upon it. Then lie had to pick up the stray glove and put it in his pocket, evidently feeling uneasy directly after because he had not put it in his hat, but not liking to make a fresh alteration. lie now coughed behind the pocket-book very respectfully, opened it, turned over a few leaves, drew out a pencil, and laid it across, so as not to lose the placet coughed again and said — ♦' Your ladyship would like me to begin at the bt'-giuning K' «' Certainly, Mr. Hurtle,' said her lady Bbip with dignity; and then with Cl.irc fitting with her eyes half closed, Tom walk ing up and down the room, and Lord Anthony looking very much troubled and caressing his leg, the visitor coughed again and began in a low subdued tone indicative of the eecrefcy of his mission. ?' Thursday, twelft. Called into Lady Denver's, Portland-place. Private enquiry. Ho expense to be spared.' '* i think you may omit all that part, Mr. llurkle,' said her ladybhip, graciously. ' Thank you, my lady. Hem T said the vititor, going on reading. ' Decided to take up case myself, Mr. Slant being in Paris. That is the end of that entry my lady.' 'Thank you,' said her ladyship, bowin/, and Tom began to whittle softly and to wonder what the man would say if he kicked his hat across the room like a foot ball. ' Friday, thirteent,' continued the visitor, turning over a leaf. ' Hem !' His cough seemed to be brought on by the fact that he was in the presence of the nobility, and it troubled him slightly as he went on — ' Huish, John, Esquire, ISO, Duke-street, St. James's. Went out with bulldog, lO.oO, Burlington Arcade, Gardens, Vigo-street, Regent-street, Portland-place, Upper Gimp ttreet. Must have got into house there. Missed. Took up due in Duke-street 2.30. Came back. Admiration Club. Back home at 11.30. — That is the second entry my lady.' *? Thank you Mr. Hurkle. Proceed,' said be ladyship; and Lord Anthony yawned so loudly that her ladyship turned upon him with a portentous frown. ' Saturday, fourteenth Ilena !' said Mr. nurkle. ' Met him in Strand. Followed to Raddle-lane, '27 % Thames-street. Stopped two hours. Came out with dark la.ly. Shop iu Cheapside. Back to Raddle-lane, 27\. Stopped half an hour. Came out. Cab to Jennyn-street, Barker's— Barker's is a noted gaming-house, my lady. Hem !' said Mr. llurkle, with a bow. ' Came oat at 3.40, S.C. Cab to -j olden Cross Hotel.' 'That is the next entry, my lady.' 'Thank you ; go on,' said her ladyship. 'Sunday, Fifteent. Went to iiadJie lane at 3.30. Joined by James Thickbroo:u, alias the Major, alias Nutty Jemmy, alins the Heavy, and Samuel fiilass, alias 'Porter, alias the Lawyer, both known to the police, and served various terms of P.8.' ' May I ask what P.S. is,' said her lady ship, interrupting. 'Does it mean Post Scriptum ?' 'Penal servitude, my lady,*' said Mr. Hurkle, bowing, and seeming to work hU bellows so up and down that if his head had suddenly touched the ceiling, no one would have been surprised. 'To continue — Hem! These three went to the liarley Mow in Hunter-ttreet, stopped drinking and play ing cards till 9.30. J. Huish cab to Jennyn-etreet. Barkers. Left there.*' 'And on* Sunday!' sighed her lady ship. 'That is the fourt entry, my lady. Hem !'sai« Mr. Hurkle. ** And cheap at the monev,' said Tom, scornfully. 'I say, do you know where I wan on Sunday, jou sir !'* 44 Beg pardon, sir,' said Mr. Hurkle, un dulating. ' You are not a client, and I have no client making enquiries about you.' ** That's a blessing said Tom, ' for them and for you.' 41 Piay go on, Mr. Hurkle,' said her lady ship. ' Mr. Hetley, I must beg that you do not interrupt.'* To address her eon as Mr. Hetley was in her Ladyship's estimation crushing, but Tom did not seem crushed. 'Monday, eixteent — Hem!' said Mr. Hurkle. ' Saw Sergeant Smart. Told me they were watching J. nuisb. Member of swell mob. Well bred, but no money. Able to get in good society. B*-en turned out of three dubs for cheating at cards. Snspoctel of being in a robbury, but couldn't be brought home.*' 'Good heavens!' cried her ladyship, ex citedly ' Benue's jewels 1' 'Hey? I beg your pardon, my lady,' cried JAr. Hurkle, pricking up his ears. u Get out,' cried Tom, savagely. ?* Mam ma, are you mad ! Here, 1 say, you sin get on and finish. This grows interesting.*' He glanced across at his sister, who was holding Trypbie's hand, her head erect, lip curling, and a warm flush in her cheeks, as she listened to this diary of her lover's doings. ' That is the fift entry,7* said Mr. Hurkle, glancing from one to the other ; and then, as a dead silence reigned, he went on. 'Tuesday, seventeent. Blank. J. II. did not go out.— That is the sixt entry, my lady. ' Wednesday, eightecnt. Blank. J. H. did not go out. — Tuat is the eevent entry, my lady. '?* Thursday, nineteenth WatchedatDuke sircet. Found J.

' 1 say,' said Tom, grinning savagely. 'You Mr. Hurkle. Thcde ladies are u.l a little fast eh ':' ?? Ob, yes, sir, they ? ** ??Mr. llurkle, Mr. Hetley,*' cried lur ladyship, indigiuuilly. *' You forget your selves.' 41 All right,' said Tom. 4- Go on.' 'J. Hui«h and F. Morrison quarrelled about dark lady — said sharp things to each other. J. Huish wrote on card— 1 have tlie card,' said Mr. llurkle, picking out a menu that had been crumpled up but was iij.v smoothed out, and he read aloud — ' Garland thought your little ictfe lien e tcoitltl be «/«//, ami has gone to hep lu-r (?ompatiy.' There was a dead silence now, which Mr. Hurkle interpreted that he was to go on. ' Card given to F. Morrison, who tunic 1 white and left the table. Got coat and h^t. Dropping card on stairs.

' Yes — yes — yes,' cried Lord Anthony, rising in great excitement; 'and — and— and it's, damme, it's£oo much. Tom, Tom, my son, if you don't kick that fellow out of the house, damme, I will ; for it's all a piece of —of confounded humbug. I won't have it — I didn't order this to be done — it's— it':? — it's a confounded, damme, it's a cruel in sult to me and my family, and I won't — I won't — Tom, my boy, send that fellow away, or I shall — damme, I shall — kill him!' ' Yes, yes, go now,' moaned her lady ship. ' 1 will write to you, Mr. Hurkle.' The private enquirer bowed very low, took up his hat and gloves, and, replacing his pocket-book without unbuttoning him self, backed out of the room, as Tom stood with his hands in his pockets, his little waxed moustache sticking out in two sharp points, and grinding his teeth, while poor Lord Anthony limped about the room trem bling with excitement. 44 Oh 1' moaned her ladyship. My salts — my drops. Tryphie, this will be the death of me. ' Serve you right,*' said Tom, savagely. You brought it on yourself.*' ' But 1 don't believe a word of it,' cried his lordship. ' I — damme — I — damme ? What'sthisabout Frank too, and my Rdnou r I — damme — I — 1 — I — won't believe John Huish is such a blackguard. Will you, Tom?' ' 1 don't know, father,' said Tom, bit terly. I've heard strange things of him of late, but I can't take in all thisi' ' There, there, my dear,' said the old gentleman to Clare. ' Be silent, Anthony, be silent. Tryphie, ring for Justine to help me to my 'room. My heart is nearly broken now,' she added in a tone of voice that seemed to indicate that it web only holding together by a little bit of ligament which was ready to go at any moment. 4- Clare, ungrateful girl, you lave heard now, and you believe.' 'I have heard, mamma,' said Clare proudly ; ' but I do not believe this about Mr. Huish. While if it were true about Frank, Rene'e would have been here to tell us, and ? *' She paused, for a carriage had stopped at the door, and soon after steps were heard ascending. ' No, no,' cried ber ladyship. ' Not at home — not at home.' Just then the door opened, and Rent5e, dosely veiled, tottered into the room, to sink with a moan of anguish inta her sister s arms. Chaitbb XXXL — Maternal Sympathy. Ihere was so much excitement and trouble at Portland Place that Clare's hair had to go unattended on one occasion, and Monsieur Hector and bis assistant waited in vain for the lady's coming. Short as was the distance, Mademoiselle Justine was unable to run round and say that they need not wait. itenee made no confidant of her mother, but clung to her sister, from whom Lady Denver heard a portion of the trouble that had fallen upon her child. ' There, 1 can't help it,' aud her lady ship. ' I do everything I can for you children, and if matters go wrong through your own imprudence, you must put up with the consequences. There, there, it u aeilly young married couple's piece of quar relling, and they must make it up as fast as they can.' ' iiut, mamma P said Clare. 'Don't argue with me, Clare. Rente must have teen imprudent, and she must take the consequences. She had no busi ness to encourage Captain Garland to visit her, and 1 trust that this will be a warning to you when you are married.' ' Mamma r 'Ob, yes, I understand you, Clare,' said her ladyship, ' but I know your obstinacy, and I maintain that it would be utter mid ness for you to see that man after your marriage. ' But, mamma, you would not think of pressing on that affair now that Ren-Se is in such trouble.' 'What has that to do with it, child? What has llende's trouble to do with your marriage? Dear Sir Grantley has been put off long enough, and he shall be made to wait no longer.' Clare vieited the coiffeur's next day, feeling less and leas compunction each time. Then, leaving Justine at home, she was driven to her sister's and left ther« by Lady Dtnvor, who had to attend to some shopping. 'Not been back?'' said Clare, eagerly, as she ga^ed in her sister's pale sweet face., '?fo, C]»jre, not yet,' replied Renoe ' but be will come soon, I hope,' she con tinued with a sigh full of resignation. ' I am waiting. And now about your trou bles, Clare. Is this wedding to take place r' ' So mmnma says,' replied Clare, with a bitter smile. ' Like you I am to have an establishment.' 'Oh, Clnre— sister,' whispered llenee, kissing her. ' Hut it makes it less bitter now that Mr. Huish has proved to be' ? Clare laid her hand upon her lips. ' Hush, lltfii.ie,' she cried. ' I do not know what you may have heard, and I will not listen to it. Neither will I bit and hear a word nuainet Mr. Huieh.' ' I will not speak against him, dear,*' faid Renee sadly ; and she gazed piteously in her sister's eyes. 'And you, Renee? My poor darling! Your position gives me the heartache.' ' I shall wait, Clare. Some day he wu* Hud out my innocence and return to ask my pardon. I can wait till then. You see, dear, that like you I have faith, and can abide my time.' Clare thought of the scene slie had heard described by the private enquirer, and afcked herself whether ehe should tell her tister. 41 Why should I f ' she thought at last. ' I did not, and do not believe the part which related to me ; wiiy should I believe what relates to her ?' In place of returning home, Clare per suaded her sister to accompany her to her uncle's, where Vidler admitted them both directly, and showed them up to the darkened drawing-room. It was a strange change, from the bright sunshine of the street to the gloom within, but it seemed to accord well with the sad ness in the sisters' breasts, and they sat and talked hour after hour to the old man, playing to him as well, till it drew near the time for them to return to their respec tive hoixes. All this time the pale, almost ghostly looking hand, was playing abaut in the little opening, and indicating by its nervous action that something was passing in the ordinarily calm mind of its owner. ' Hence, my child,' he said at last, ' I can hear that you are in trouble.' There was no reply for a few momenta, and then she said softly — ' Yes, dear uncle.' ' I do not ask you for your confidence, my child,' he said, 'for if it ia some trouble between your husband and yourself it should be sacred to you both. I dreaded this,' he muttered to himself. 'Clare, mv child, I would not, if I could help it, do anything to encourage you to act in dis obedience to your parent's wishes, but be careful how you enter on this proposed alliance. I like it not ; I like it not.' Clare did not 'answer, only stole to the opening, and pressed her warm fresh lips to the cold and withered hand. Then the young people took their leave, and the yellow-looking house in Wimpole-street re sumed its wonted aspect of gloom. Sir Grantley WUtera was to dine at Portland-place that evening, but Renee re fused to stay, preferring the solitude of her own home, and to nurse the faint hope that her husband might return. The baronet was quite bright in spirits and youthful in appearance, having got the better of his late ailment, and Lady Denver smiled penuvely at him, when she was not watching Lord Anthony and seeing that he was not surreptitiously supplied with wine. Tom diced at home, and was morosely civil, being puzzled how to act towards his future brother-in-law. Sir Grantley knew of the trouble between Renee and her husband, but religiously avoided all allusion thereto ; he, however, found time and opportunity to mention to Lady Denver the last scandal that he had heard concerning John Huish. ' No 1' ' exclaimed her ladyship, laying her plump hand upon his arm. ' \ aas ; fact I assure you,' he said. ' I hod it from three fellows at the club, and they were present. It was at a place in Jermyn-street.' ' How dreadful .'' exclaimed her ladyship in a low tone. ' They are retailing scandal about poor old Jack Huiflb, Clary,' eaid Tom, leaning over the back of her chair in the drawing room. ' You think he's quite square, ehl-' 41 If you mean by tbat, Tom, tbat I think him an honorable gentleman — yes, I do,' said Clare, quietly, ' don't you P* 'Clary, old girl,' he whispered back, ' I don't know what to say. Time back I'd have stuck up for John Kuieh against the whole world ; but now I have heard so many things against him that ? ' 44 Heard, Tom ? Have you ever known John Huish do a disbon arable act ?' ?'Well; no,' said Tom. Clare did not reply, but ber face flushed, and she sat looking' proud and content in ber faith. Meantime her ladyship had been fur nished with the last new piece of gossip regarding the young man who had gofte to the bad, and was supremely happy. In spite of her ladyship's watchfulness Tom managed tbat hi* father should have a little wine, and the consequence was that he became very garrulous, making same personal remarks to Sir Grantley- about matters of the past which the baronet wished to be considered too youthful to remember, and suffering at last from such decided twinges of his old complaint that he had to leave the table. Clare at once seized the excuse to be freed from a pre j&a;*.. flab o^m Ma .^^. —^ _ _ ? sence phe detested, and went to atten 1 upon herfather, \rhile Tom went off to have a quiet cigar, and a jrarae of billiards, le.ivhjy hi-r Jadjsbip and Sir Grantley toprethur *?'» ili=~ cuss a few more of the preliminaries --f th-» wedding; Sir Grantley going so far when he left as to say that 'this was ab.mt the pleasantest evening ho had had at the house in Portland-place, ' don't you know.' Chaptkb XXXIL— 11k is Goxk. j June loved, feared, and hated her hus band, and yet she felt that it was in his power to mould her like so much wax. As they were living now, she dreaded his returns and yet feared his departures, for her life was to her a riddle, and she could not understand his way. ' Going ! Away ?' said June anxiously, as ehe clung to her husband's arm one evening. * But you will not be long ?** 41 Don't know — perhaps a week ; perhaps a month ; perhaps two. June's eyes flashed, and she gazed angrily at the young man as he sat with his heela neon the table, smoking, and reading a French novel. ' But, John, dear,** ehe said, going up to him to place one soft arm round his neck, and lay her cheek against his forehead, ' can you not take me with you ?' ' JSo ; impossible.' ' It is so dull hero, pleaded June, in a sad tone of voice. ' I shall be here alone with that poor girl, Midge, and she is so strange at times, 6he frightens me.' ' Bah !*' was the contemptuous Tcply. 'And there is something about this gloomy old house,'' said June, going on her knees by his chair, resting her elbows ou his knees, and her chin upon her hands, that troubles me.' He lowered his book, and gazed at her tlrsmpely. ' £ven that poor dog of yours is uneasy here,' she said. 44 What ?— What do you mean?' he cried, frowning. 'Don't look crossly at me, John, dear,' ehe ?whispered fondly. ' I don't know ; enly tbat lie sniffs about, and keeps getting up and barking, and will not settle.' ??What foolery you talk,' he cried, 6avagely, and resumed his reading. 44 1 feel troubled, too, like the poor dumb beast/' she continued, ' and so does the Midge. John, there is a something about this house that frightens us all.' 'Fools!' he exclaimed, angrily. Then, dropping his book on the table, he said with a brutal laugh, ' You see ghosts, I suppose, tall white ones, in winding-sheets; and they come and pull you out of bed at night.*1 ' I hinted at nothing of the kind,' said June, quietly, as a strange melancholy look stole over her face. ' I only told you, dear John, tbat this place is oppressive to me, and troubles me. I thought perhaps you would take me away.' ' What stuff !' he exclaimed. « Don't be a fool, June. There — confound it all ! let me read in peace.' He shook her off roughly, aud a strange menacing look came into her flashing dark eyes, but something stronger quenched their fire, and, smiling tenderly, she rose, bent over him, kissed him softly on the forehead, and then stole to the window and began to work. She knew that the fire of his love had gone down, and was not even smouldering now; but her own was burning still. She loved him very dearly, she told herself,andao unkiuduese on his part could turn her from him. Certainly there was a spirit roused within her at times which made her blooi course rapidly through her veins, aud her eyes to flash ; but it passed away as rapidly as it came, and she had a loving smile for him the next moment. The Midge came in a few minutes later to tell him that he was wanted, and as he left the room she lingered behind to look gloomily at J une. For though there was ho open enmity displayed towards her the Midge had shown vary little friendly feeling; looking upon her as an interloper and rival, and watching1, with a satisfaction she could sot quell, the increasing coldness of the man she worshipped from a distance. There was something of malice than in ler smile, as she stayed in the room and listened to the Gentleman's descending footsteps, and then said — ' He is going away.** 'Yes,' said June with a smile, 'I know.' ' Are you glad T said the Midge, ' or sorry f 'I am always sorry when my husband leaves me,' said June, quietly. 'Husband! Ha— ha— ha!' cried the Midge, laughing. June started to her feet with her eves flashing, and caught the Midge so tigh'tlv by the shoulder that the girl winced and cowered upon the ground. 44 If you mock at me like that, girl,' she hissed, ' I shall kill you.' The Midge crept away from her and reached the door, while June, whose whirl wind of passion had passed as quickly as it came, returned to her seat. 'Get up, Midge,' she said quietly. ' You should not anger me like that?* 41 1 didn't mean — I didn't want to,' said the girl, humbly. ' But did he tell jou when he was coming back ?' 'No,' said June, eagerly. 'Do jou Inow.** 44 Yes,' said the girl, standing now with ber hand upon the door; and her eyes twinkled as she saw the effect of her words. ' He is going for three months.' 'Three months !' cried June. 44 Yes, I heard him eay so.' ' No, no,' cried June—** it is impossible.' 'And perhaps longer,' said the Midge, maliciously. ??But why— why is he going f' cried June. ' 'Bliged to,' said the girl. 'Getting too hot for him,' she said. u People been about watching the house, and he don't want to be took.' ' Took !' cried June, with dilating eyes. 'Yes; you're very innocent,' said the Nidge. ' Ye#, took. It must come to it some day. Father's been took lots of times. You*won't mind if he is,' after the first time.' The room seemed to swim round before the eves of the poor young wife, and she laid her hand upon the table to try and steady herself, and master the emotion that troubled her. 'Do you know where he is going, Midge ?' she said at last. ' Whatl hasn't your husband told you P» said the girl ; and a look of menace once more flashed to June's eyes. 'No,' she replied quietly enough, 'he has not.' ^_ _— — — — — — — ?»— 'Cross the water, then, if jon mast know,' said the Midge, sulkily, ':,_- tha gaming tables and places abroad. T.ii all the better for you; he'll m;i!« lota of money, as he did before, and then com© tack and epend it like water. II* did last time. Arn't you glad he's going I-'' June did not reply, but sat thinking, with a curious look of resentment ia her eyes. The Midge stood watchimr ber, but she paid no more heed to her presence than if she had been the insect whose name sha bore. But no ; she would not, couH no* te::eve it. He must love her too well to be so heartless as to go away like that. lie bad been very cool of late, she owned, bat still that might be due to his troubles ; some thing had worried him, and besides he had been ill. He had had a terrible lit, conse quent upon some strange dor flying1 at hii, and that had charged him a little. She would and could make all allow ances ; she loved him too passionately and well not to do that; and as to the stings of this girl — for she was but a girl — what of them f She spoke as she did because she loved her lord, and she could forgive the poor child for that, since 6he was so repul sive that it was impossible to feel a mo ment's jealousy of such a one as she. So she smiled once more, and turnel t- the Mi- lge, who was still by the door. 44 Why do you eay such cruel things t- me, Midge ?' she asked. 41 Because I hate you,' was the uncoir promising reply. ' Have I not seen hin kiss and fondle and love you, and is not that enough ? But not lately,' she cried, with a low laugh, ' not lately. I have not seen him hies you for weeks.' Her words stun? June again so that eh* could hardly contain hereself, but she mas tered her anger, and the girl went on. 'Why shouldn't you feel pain, too?** she cried. ' It hurts me to see him go ; why shouldn't it hurt you ?' June pressed ber hand to her side. 44 It does,' cried the Midge, chipping her hands, 'and I am glad of it. Someday, perhaps, you will be plain and ugly too, and then you can feel for such as me more than you do row.' June looked at ber curiously, and then turned her face away, for the girl's words had started up a train of rejections, Yes, she would perhaps grew plain some day, and then ? Would he be able to retain' his love for her, when even now— — She started back to the present, for the Midge had run suddenly to the window which was wide open, and was gazing ex citedly down into the street, evidently for getful of the presence of June. ' ' June's heart began to beat just then, in a strangely rapid way as a flood of ideas darted to her brain. Was something wrong P Was he in danger P She knew now that he engaged in pursuits that set the law at defiance, and her bands began to tremble, and her cheek to pale, for there were voices below; then theie was the slamming of the rpron of a Hansom ca% and the sound of -wheels, when the Midjre turned from the wiiu'ow with a ]-i:eo' s cry, throwing up her hands frantically. ' He's gone, he is gone,' she sad ; -i sv A without one kind look, without on «? d word.' The girl threw herself upon tb« !'-.i.*, wailing loudly in her misery. n« .'.

And then in a burst of rage which made her eyes flash with excitement she eried, hoarsely : — ' Why should he ? What does he care for me P' ' Get up,' she cried then* with her eyes angry as those of some savage animal. 'Get up. Leave me; I cannot bear you here. And listen, girl,** she hissed in the Midge's ear—41 He is mine— my husband in the s'gbt of God. Speak again to me as you did just now, and' — She rafeed her band with its fingers clenched, and the llidge crept away back wards, trembling before the angry woman, who followed her slowly to the door, looked it after her, and then alone* made one bound into the inner room, and cast herself upon the bed, and bit at tlie pillow in her efforts to keep down tbs aaddening cries of rage and despair that foaght hard to escape from herhpa. For there, ever Wore her was the idea, each moment growing stronger, that her reign was over, that he* short spell of joy was at an end, and that bitterness bail come in all its force to her deserted breast.
