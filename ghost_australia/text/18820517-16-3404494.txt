NEW SOUTH WALES. FROM OUR OWN t'OlHICSI'ONUENT.] Sydney, 11th May. In the events of the past week the sensation is element has largely predominated, and in a general way it may be said that the public mind has been to a certain extent thrown off its balance by the contemplation of the somewhat tragic incidents that have transpired within the past few days First of all, there was the shock experienced by the news of that abominable double assassination in Dublin, which has naturally) aroused The detestation, is it has excited the horror, of the whole civilised vi 01 Id All matters of local concern n- mci these have been far from iininleicstnig-wcie over shadow ed this week by the horrible deed of Saturday morning last there has not been any public may enient horse is in Melbourne, to elicit an expression of the feelings entertained by people on the subject, but that seems seem every necessary 'He states that the deed has left on li el md is naturally felt most acutely hereby Irishmen, who are not slow to leahscwhita deadly blow it is to then most cherished hopes for the reclamation and improvement of the condition of their country men at home, and they seek refuge, as drowning men would catch at straws, in the wild and preposterous theory that the murder b were committed by enemies of the Irish Land League, and. not by persons who s) as]) those with the proceedings of the leaders of that organisation That is the view held 01 at all events avowed, by Iiislnncn here, and they will listen to no other theory) One Ilibciiiiui gentleman with whom I am well acquainted, avows his conviction that the murder ci s of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr Bin ko are no other than his cling onus series of the Irish landlords and he is not more sure of this thin Ian Johnson was of the truth of the Cock lane ghost story Outside Hibernian circles here, howey ci, it is the unit ci s ii opinion that the vile deed was the work of German land Leaguers of the O Donovan Rossa school, and that the culprits aicpiobably lush Americans Coming to local concerns I find on assizes yielding their quota to the sum of sensation ahem, for already ankle Innes has passed the death sentence on these wretched beings since Monday One of these was the French woman Marie Laye, the author of the Flagstaff Hill tragedy), which sent a tin full of honor through the contract) a couple of months ago A fine little boy, about 4 years of age, was found but illy murdered early one morning in the reserve near the Government Observatory and the crime was clearly brought home to its mother The absence of any rational motive for the diabolical act was the most incomprehensible feature in tins str ungo and melancholy case, and the only theory that could be advanced to sue the wretched woman from the legal consequences of her offence was that she was insane, but this plea has not been established There was nothing in the woman's conduct since her and est and committal to support the pi assumption that she was mad She had, indeed, committed cold blooded mm der- strangled her own child, for which she had entertained a stir ong affection , but this fact, per se was not sufficient to exempt her on the score of insanity), is known to the law, from her responsibility to society The Judge, in passing sentence, could not take upon himself to hold out for the murder ess any hope of mercy , but nevertheless, the circumstances of the case are of such a peculiar nature that it may be taken for granted she will not be hanged by the two other cases, the parties one of whom is little more than a boy, were found guilty of an unnatural crime, but the Judge, after passing sentence of death, intimated to the parents that the extreme penalty of the law would not be carried out Another tragic incident of the past week was the sad fatal accident to the telegraph messenger boy Robson, who was crushed to death by a falling bale of wool at a store on the Circular Quay The tramway, too has made its ton to button to the deplorable incidents of the week b) smashing the legs of one of the guards while engaged at his ordinary (and dangerous work) of collecting fares The victim, a young man named Price, had to have both limbs amputated And, as if the tramways are not killing people fast enough, some miscreant must needs place a number of logs her loss one of the lines, with the playful object, of course, of causing a smash Fortunately, in this case, the villainous purpose was not effected The Gov ci nment are off ei ing a i cw aid of £200 for the com- action of the guilty party What motive could have prompted such a wanton and foolish piece of scoundrelism it is difficult to imagine, The sentence of death passed upon the culprit John Plomer has been commuted to life im- prisonment, the first three years in lions has exercised clemency is, at all events to a good many people, a surprise The crime for which Plomer was cast for death was one of specu haily revolting character, without a single extenuating circumstance to be urged in the guilty man's favour, He was convicted of rape upon a young girl attending a school of which he was the master, and the decision of the Executive may, therefore he accepted as tantamount to a determination that in future of the death penalty for the ci line of ripe will not be enforced If that be so it would be as well to have the fact known for after the decision in Ploiuei s case, the Crown could not, without laying itself open to the charge of inconsistency exact the extreme 1 chatty many cause of this kind in future t The subject of the old English style held in the Garden Palace
