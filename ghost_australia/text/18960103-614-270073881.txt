Common Sense and Courage. Two young Americans, it is said, recently settled a quarrel iu a fashion which woidd have made the hair of a Parisian fencing master bristle with horror, but which nevertheless had an inspiration of common sense in it. They were both in love with the same lady, and it became necessary to their feelings that they should fight for possession of her. One of the two must clearly be put out of the way. Yet why should they kill each other ? They bore each other no malice; each merely wished to be left in sole possession of the lady in dispute. The question resolved itself into a simple issueâ€”which was the better shot ? And they determined to settle this ques tion by shooting, not at each other, but at a tree. The tree was shot at; the inferior marksman perforce admitted that he would have been annihilated by his rival and agreed to vanish, not by giving up the ghost, but by leaving the country. Hero were all the results of a duel obtained without its mock heroics, and without moro tragedy than belongs to all renunciation.
