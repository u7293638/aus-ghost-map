CAULFIELD TRAINING NOTES. (By Telegraph.) Melbourne, October 12. Ben Bolt started on a mile and a half journey, old Chuckster bringing him along the last seven furlongs. The son of Newbold moved free and well, but the time made was oot extra good. SQvermine traversed a round on the course proper in a very taking style, The Chanter acting as schoolmaster for the first part of the journey, and Sirocco at the latter end. Bonnie J>oon put in a strong circle on the grass alone. Milktream negotiated a long gallop, having The Crane and The Ghost to assist him. The Eon of The Diver, having Gorry in the saddle, with whin and spurs on, sweated rather freely at the finish. Gadfly seemed as if she could bave ran over Grace Darling in a milespin, but she bad apparently a lot tfae best of the weights. Ijmberto trotted and cantered. New York and Bohemian were dispatched for a gcod useful gallop of a mile and a half, the pair, with light weights up, finishing together, Naboclish was treated to a round over the schooling fences, hitting one or two of them ratlitr hard.
