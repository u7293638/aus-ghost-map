The fact of bur engagement to George .A Inlander bad given Joan's mother endless hubjoct matter to refleot on. George wase sort of connection of their own. He had knocked about in Australia several years, and had come back at twenty-eight with an affectation of indifference toward bis native Irind—the rasult of thirsting for it every day of his absence. He had returned in late summer when the barley harvest was in full swing. George had sanoterod into the field. Joan wae among'the. gathereis. Her birr w:is gathered np into a knot tightly twisted up behind, ffw sun-bonnet bad fallen cff. Her sleeves were turned up; £>lio looked a strong, capable woman.. She stood tpart, resting for a moment. The sun sbone in ite full force; the hoary 'swish* of the ripe yellow barley as it fell tormed a framework to her as she stood there. George stood looking at the reapers; they threw jests to him, and laughed as they moved down tile fi 'll. Joan .alone said nothing. She smiled at Um as she passed. Her smile set iiin thinking. He still stood there, for a momentary glimpse of an ideal had come to liim. It was one of those moments come at least once in a man's life. It was the touch of a home atmosphere, the simple labor,,the suushine and a woman's smile that proinptedjt It did not last long, but onl ot it «iew an idea ihat dominated three liws. . .. .v ; ; • " ' ' 'They're.goy ahin' the times here,* was: what lie stud, and he sauntered off the field. ,Hiort«ult of the idea was that, several: •woeks Hftcr, 'Geoige had asked Joan .to marry him.

Ye micht get him bark. Tho mull is worth his whilo. Tbat wad aye ooont tigeimt you las chance*.' Joan needed none of it. She outwardly pursued her placid way. Inwardly sbe was consumed by a fire of jealousy. Janet McLaren admitted that G*orge had not said anything about the wedding day. 4 But I'm nae carin',' ehfl said, gaily,' I'm no prood to come after you, Joan, and I'll hae mair sense to keep him.* 4 'ITiere's nae body blamin' yon for that/ said lire.

Once die broke through lier re* serve. 4 His George tell't you in words he lo'ce youf she asked Janet. : Janet blushed and frowned. ' I dinna ken,' she stud. ' But ihe's aye oomin 1 and oomin', and he kens fat a folk ate eayinV Joan sighed. She looked out one night as she was going to bed. She shivered as a gust swept round the houBe. Then a eilenco came. < ' I's a fearful night,* die said hastily. ' I hope nae one is out in the storm.* ohe was shutting the door when a sound struck ber ear. It seemed a wail. She staid still 4 to listen, but it did not come again. Joan!' it had seemed to her to come floating through the storm. For a long while she stood waiting apprehensively. Her heart beat at the unexpeoted feeling of suspense and fear. ' if it wis a human voioe it '11 cry again,' die said, to still ber own fears. Nothing oame. The wind swept round the gables with shrill moans and cries. * It was the wind,' she said, and she shut the door. In the night she woke. Tho same sense of apprehension seized her, and a feeling of dull reality came to her. 4 Joan !' the voiee seemed to wail. It bad a human ring about it, to her excited mind. 4 God forgive me if it was a voice,* she murmured, 4 for noo its*s a spirit's voice that's crying. I couldna hear any one in this storm. 1 She got op and dressed. He room was upstairs, her mother slept in the box-bed built into tho wall in the little kitohen. Softly and qnietly she groped her way down and got the lanthom. She opened the door softly and stepped out. Her teeth chattered and her heart sank. 4 I'm too late,' she kept saying. Still she kept on. The conviction was forced upon her that she had not been dreaming that some one had sought her aid. She tramped np and down the path; the wind met her aud nearly whirled her off her feet. There was no sign of anything. 'The bridge has gone,' she said, suddenly, as a gleam of light showed her a dark mass of woodwork which had floated down tho river. ' They aye said it wad the last five or sax winters, and noo it's fairly gone.' She lifted her voice and shouted. No answer c&xne.; Gradually her fears subsided. She oven laughed at her own exaggerated fears. 'I winna tell ony soul fat I hae deen this nioht,' she said, us she shut the door and crept back to hex room. She woke in the. morning with a strange feeling of dread. .By degrees the.night's ooourxenoe oame back. .Ontside all was still and bright. Shefeltthe same'instinctive'feeling that a tragedy had happened whioh she had had it in her power to avert. She went about all day with a foreboding at her heart. . That afternoon she realized the truth. Xhere was a tramp of feet past the window. 'Pat's yonf' asked Mrs. MacLeod, eagerly. 'Sin oot and Bee, Joan.* . Joan satBtttlandfixed. Her breath came In short little gasps. ' * I canna, mither. Bide ia wee.' i 'The old woman hobbled to the door and opened it. \- Tat'a the stir? she called shrilly..

The sun had begun to go down behind (he firtrees. John gave a little shiver. It was not many weeks after riiia that George 4 and she met again. I'm off to Australia, Joan,* he said, sullenly. Nothing had happened in the interval to shake the moral force of Joan's arguments. She started. 4 Must ye gang, George!' die asked, softly. George was still angry with her foolish woman s insistence, but his wrath suddenly melted. He looked at her downcast eyes and trembling month. ' Not if ye bid me stay, Joan.' The river still flowed on -in its oldcourae. Hie firtrees stood straight and dark at the top of the brae; but the brae was ploughed up and grew in golden com and the old mill dam was filled "with--water instead of the tangle of roods and flowers, and all day the mill wheel splashed cheerfully round. The ghost of Joan's past was hud, merged into the happinness of her life. 'I aye_ said' things were in the Lord's hands,' said Mrs. AfcLeodpiously, 'andnoo the mull is started ainoe mair I ken it.'
