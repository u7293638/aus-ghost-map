WIT AND HUMOR. CARL DUNDER. THE STORY OP A BOX WHO BELIEVED IN DREAMS. Shildren, I shall now tell you der shtory of der poy who pelieves in some dreams und signs. His name vhas Hans Dunderwetter, und he life mit bis folks sbust at der foot of a big hill in Sbermany. I haf seen dot hill myself, und so I know dot shtory vhas pooty true. Vbell, vhen dis poy vhas aboudt 8 years old he goes oafer to shtay all day mit an old womans, und she tells him all aboudt bears und ghosts und dreams und signs. Ijjrom dot time he vhas a shpoiled poy. If his fadder like him to go down cellar he vhas afraidt of :s. If his mother like him to go oop shtairs he vhas afraidt of bears. I like to say to you right off dot no ghosts vhas eater known in any country. A ghost vhas a white sheet hanging on der pack of a shair, or some bed-spread left out on der fence in der night. Deie was same bears aroundt, but dey doan' come in der house to pite you. In soach a place like Detroit you may all go oafer und you doan' see one bear—not one. He vhas afraidt to come here. If he does he vhas dead in two minutes. Und so Hans he always peliefs in signs und dreams too. If he dreams dot he fall down a shteep hill he doan' get oudt of bed until 10 o'clock. If he dreams dot he vhas a fish, he vhas scart und hides in der barn all day. If he sees a crow fly to der north dot vhas a pad sign, und Hans don't shop any wood dot day. If he sees a white cow go along mit a red horse after her, dot vbas a sign of money, und he goes out and walks 10 miles for to look for some pocketbooks in der roadt. He vhas no goot to his parents, and eferypody else makes fun of him und says he vas soft mit der headt. Vhell, sbildrens, Hans vhas growing oop in a badt way. If der moon vhas oafer his left shoulder he doan' hoe out some cabbages nor work mit der potatoes. If der sun goes down oafer his right elbow dot means he shall go to town und get a letter in der post office. Between dreams und signs be vnas no goot for work, und he goes aboudt in rags like ne vhas a beggar. His fadder lick him more as fife hoonered times, and his mother cry more ash two barrels of tears, but it vhas no use. Vhell, all dis goes on until Hans vhas 16 years old. Den one day he sees two hens on der fence, while two crows fly oater. At der same time somepody shnores in his schleep, und der bucket fall down der well. He took dot ash some awful sign dot he must go out in der woods nnd get some bark from a tree dot vash hit mit lightning, und if he make some tea from dot bark he lif to be 90 years old. Away he goes, and purty queek he meets a wolf, who Bays :— " Ah !—yum !— how pleased I vhas ! Der wind blows my tail to der left side last night, und dot vhas a sign dot I eat a poy for supper ! I meet you on top of a hill, -and dot vhas a sign two more wolves come oop !" Veil, shildren, all dot vhas true. Dey find dot poy's bones in der forest, und shust vhen dey pick 'em oop a coon runs oop a tree back end first. Dot vhas a sign dot somepody's horse vbas in danger, and der peoples runs home und find dot Herr Dederwetter's pig white horse vhas shoked mit an apple. Dot vbas all my shtory. I like you pelief some of him. If you pelief dot anybody who sees ghosts—dot anybody who peliefs in dreams— dot any person who vhas guided by signs vhaB soft on der head, like pumpkin pie, you hit her right und needn't be afraid. I can put all der ghosts und shpooks in my ear, und ash for signs und dreams you vhas more apt to full und preak your nose dan to pecome rich.
