ORIGINAL RHYMES. START FROM SQUATTERLAND FOR THE DIGGINGS. 'Twas even the sheep were m the feld, And hoarsely bleating with catarrh, Tne night wind whistled harsh and cold, And faintly wink'd each drowsy star : The price of wool and fat was down- The Squatter felt himself "done brown." He sought his bed, and tried to sleep, But dismal spectres cross'd his sight, And ever, in the darkness deep, Throughout the vigils of that night, Lank mutton-ghosts, with harrowing dread, Disturb'd his squatocratic bed. What needs it that the bard should say The goblin fotms that Squatter saw; It b√≥oteth not: at dawn of day He left his palliasse of straw Fill'd his black pipe-pass'd through the door And swore he ne'er would enter more. He paused a moment ere he fled, And turn'd to take a last long gaze At umpie, stockyard, fold, and shed, Memorials of disastrous days, Where long he tried, by fat and fleece, With noisy duns to make his peace. He thought of all the Courier told (Alas, his bill was there unpaid) Of Californian beds of gold, Where fortunes in a week were made, He thought (that was not very nice) His own cash drafts were rather "chise" He thought of sugar canes and cotton, Of Dr. Lang and emigration ; He thought how half his sheep were rotten, And him without a single ration. His tin was done-his credit down- Twas time, he thought, that he was gone ! He went to California fled, Left friends, and sheep, and debts behind; The last things troubled least his head, To name them now was quite unkind. He went: what belter,could he do- May all his golden dreams be true ! FREDERIC.
