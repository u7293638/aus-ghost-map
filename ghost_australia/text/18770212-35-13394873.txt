\- -' MR. DAMPIER AS HAMLET. MR ALFRED DAMPIER appeared for the first time before a Sydney audience, at the "Victoria Theatre, on Saturday evening Although still a comparatively young man, he has achieved eminence in his profession, and has had the rare good fortune of making himself a favourite with the public in every place he has visited He commenced the study of his profession at the early age of it), and has devoted himself to it with real earnestness His success is due to perseverance and hard study Nature has gifted him with a fine presence and a magnificent voice, and he has availed himself of these advantages As an author of plays he has distinguished himself, and his dramatized version of Victor Hugo's "Les Miserables" was satisfactory even to the author of the novel-which, in the case of Victor Hugo is saying a great deal Mr Dampier's last appearance in England was in May 1873, when he accepted a three years' engagement for Australia from Messrs Coppin and Harwood of the Theatre Royal, Melbourne where, his success was most pronounced, and his visit to New Zealand since, lines, to judge from the notices that have appeared, given the greatest pleasure to the lovers of dramatic art in that colony On Saturday night the Victoria Theatre was packed from floor to ceiling, and numbers of people had to leave, being unable to obtain admission Mr Dampier's reception was most enthusiastic His appearance was the signal for con- tinued cheers, and throughout the performance he was applauded finish and, as a matter of course, called before the curtain at the conclusion of t nil act of the play with regard to his impersonation of Hamlet opinions will naval ally differ, and indeed the difficulties of obtain- ing an opportunity for reilly careful observation of his acting (consequent partly upon the crowded state of the theatre and partly upon the noisy interruptions of some occupants of pit and gallery) presented the possibility of arriving at a just judgment About one matter and the chief one, how ever there can be no quest >n Mr Dampier s " Hamlet " is a thoroughly artistic pen farmers were well, gesture, and tone of voice has been most carefully studied Whether his conception of the many sided and complex character is the true one or not, is a point on which I there will be naturally many differences of opinion as there alway s are, whoever may be the m tor But that his performance was equal, deeply studied, and finch expressed will admit of no doubt those who value, as every lover of true art must do an adequate representation of Hamlet the Dane will however take another opportunity of seeing Mr Dampier before pronounced.' a decided opinion upon his performance He had a good many obstacles, it must be remembered, to overcome on Saturday night The theatre was strive. to him the accessories were far from being as good as they should have been and he had, to say the least of it, an indifferent company to support him to Mr Bartlett as the Ghost, or Miss Adelaide B wins as the Queen, little objection can be taken nor v as Al- Bland Holt as the first Gravedigger w intmar in the room honour of the part, but what can be said of the echoing Air Sengrave certainly did not fall into the usual mistake of making Polonius a buffoon, but then he failed in giving him any character at all Miss Annie Pixley no doubt did her best as Ophelia, but the part was evidently not in her line of business As to the rest, it may be presumed that they did their best and there is nothing to be gantry remarking on deficiencies which cannot be remedied even though they have greater and unfair work upon the leading parts However, Air Dampier is the attraction, and the object of this notice, brief as it nece sadly is from the reasons already mentioned, is sufficient to show that he is a genuine artist, and that his engagement will give to those who admire true dramatic art an opportunity of enjoyment superior to any presented in Sydney for a very long time
