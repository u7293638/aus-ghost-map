THE ORIGIN OF THE CON Fimsioy OF FAITH. By All\4MÂ»R STIll ULA Ml, MA.

But how could they light ' Neither party was prepared, and each us yet scrupled to seem in the wrong" by openly beginning to levy war and drill recruits But there, at Newcastle, lay an army of 20 000 beats the only formid- able force the island as yet contained tough lowlanders many of them bronzed by the Fifty 'Years War in Germany and led by Alexander Leslie, in whose misshapen body there lay whatever of military genius was known to exist in Great Britain at that time Whichever party could secure the aid of these veterans would begin the game with an opening move of the utmost importance and it was with that piece that the Pnrba ment resolved to start the conflict which should end with checkmate to the King But the Scots were resolute Nothing would bribe them nothing content them but an assurance that 1 Presbyterianism should be the religion, and the only religion of the land in the English Parliament the recent ex- perience of J piscopul tyranny under Land and W rcn had rendered bishops for a time at least distasteful to the majority and to aeertaiuextentthey were sincerely inclined to a 1 leabyteium form of government, they were easily persuaded to conform to the lfcccssiticsof the tone, and in TOLD a resolution was passed that an assembly of divines should meet and advise the Parliament as to the teaching of Scripture with reference to church gave rnment Two clergymen were to be chosen from each county except Durham and two from each university Hut nothing was done for a time The war of words as to Sir John Hotham and Hull and the Irish Rebellion the raising" of money, and the formation of a militia kept the House busy and besides the Scots were so far, s wishful three months later on the 22nd August, 1913 the knight marshal carried forth the Royal banner from the castle of Nottingham and sunk in" the state in the c irth called for the proclamation of the cabin was the ciuiHon holds flapper 1 noisily as the bringing" her in 1 struGGled tim u li the crook ed hand writing J w t months later J Essex and Charles stumbled in" mist each other it I death, and nine could tell which party could claim the d in Roth hides retired to winter quarters the King at Uvlotd and flic Parliamentary party at london When seen" cure each side felt more vividly than ever its state of unprtp induces Useless and indecisive el matches cost many lives, and Ghulgrove field was reddened by the noble blood of Hampden till it length oiiAthirstou Moor the last fight was fully won, and it was the boy dist cause that won it Affairs were decidedly a "looney aspect for the Parliament when, on this 1st of July, the Assembly of divines is meeting in this noble chapel to inaugurate the work which is to make the Scots in earnest alliance with the Parliamentary party No wonder they look solemn and that on every face lies the shadow of disastrous strike Less than 30 miles away is the cannon are thundering, and ill between Oxford and Bristol is ablaze. Bristol itself, the second city in the Kingdom, and next to London, the strongest hold of the Parliamentary cause is in danger from the fiery Rupert who, indeed, is to storm and sack it only three weeks later Such were the surroundings when the assembly commenced its labours It consisted of 121 divines 10 members of the House of Lords, and 20 of the House of Commons After it had sat for a few weeks, there arrived from Scotland five clergymen and three laymen to assist in the delibera- tion and let the assembly understand how they m headed thus in Scotland-one ban dred and fifty nine altogether, and yet of that number they rarely had much more than a half, and often considerably less 1 or from the beginning it was plain that freedom of discussion was to be allowed within only the narrowest limits About twenty of the number were Church of England clergymen, with no leaning to I'rcsby terrorism Only a few of these ever took their seats and these few almost imme- p i diately abandoned their places. They could have done no service by staying. Towards the end of August the Scots called on the members as a preliminary to swear to and sign the Solemn League and Covenant, which Parliament instructed them to do In the second section of that document appear the words, " We shall endeavour the extirpation of popery, prelacy, superstition, heresy, and schism ' line was a sweeping oath to be taken by a deliberative body before it should commence its deliberations, and a warm discussion arose in which the good and learned Dr Burgess argued strongly against the we d " extirpation as having an unchristian ring in it. But he lost his point after much heat on both sides, and the worthy Dr Lightfoot (whose dear) is for some of these proceedings my chief authority) tells us that Dr Luigisa is a wretch that ought to be branded to nil postent), who seeks for some devilish ends, either of his own or other or both, to hinder so great a good of the two nations Dr Burgess stuck to his point, and was finally sequestered and suspended, the majority having business on hand, and being resolved to tolerate no nonsense In the following month Dr Gouge, of Black friars, raised the same point, and tried to soften the expression extirpation of prelacy, ' out found reason to repent his rashness and surrendered Subsequently Dr Burgess was restored to his place, and being eminent for learning and pick), was made chairman in the absence of Dr '! worse, for in future discussions he had not the misfortune to be to any serious extent a dissentient There were in the assembly about a dozen men of the greatest learning, who then passed by the name of Lrowmsta, though we should now call them Independents of Congregationalists , divines peculiarly respected in England, but much feared and suspected in the assembly) they formed a small minority, but their learning made this formidable and their claim was no less than that of toleration for all Christian sects , a chum which the majority emphatically asserted that they detested and abhorred To these were joined DIV, who called them selves Drasliuns, and held that religion is an affair between a man and his Maker, and that ecclesiastical organisations and author ties were only so much tyranny These and the Independents remained firmly in their posts, but the J piscopahans felt that the animus against him was too strong, and attempted no further light 1 or six years this assembly met five days a week in the Jerusalem Chamber, beginning their discussion at fl in the morning and continuing till late in the afternoon. The first thing relegated to them by Parliament was the consideration of the thirty nine Articles, over which there was much dissension Then came the general question of church polity, on which the assembly worked till April, 1914 'Their debates were marred by excessively long speeches, which generally consisted in the piecing together, with in genius care, of multitudes of little scraps from the Bible, very few making any effort to catch the general spirit of scriptural teaching A long light took place over the keys of the kingdom, which at that time implied a complete ecclesiastical dominion, the "power of the keys signifying the right to cancel moments, that right curbing with it not only spiritual but also temporal penalties of a severe description There are three views entertained by members first, that the " keys of the kingdom ' were the keys of heaven , second, that they implied the power of admission to or exclusion from the church, and third, that they merely meant the preach one; of the gospel to the heathen The last view found little support, and the two former were eventually compromised, as in deed, according to the views of those dm a, they came to much the same thing For the majority held that there was at the National Covenant explicitly said, no way of marching heaven except through one church, that church being the Presbyterian , hence, if a man was excluded from that church he was necessarily excluded from heaven, though the converse was rarely assorted, that if he were admitted to the church he would be of necessity admitted to heaven However, as the times were Innes of strife, and Parliament was impatient at the long winded delays of the worthy divines, the pla use was at last inserted as it stood in the Bible in Christ s charge to Peter, and everybody could interpret it for himself While they wrangled at length, There were great events going forward In September the news had reached London of the battle of Newbury), when the assembly returned thanks as though for a victory, though we now know that neither side is id much and v untag the veteran leader 1 in had passed away from the scene of conflict, and the gloom is deepening, while the Scotch fire.) is not yet upon the seem No wonder Parliament grows impatient, and sends down so that peremptory messages to the divines to hurry on with their work in February), 1911 a number of commissioners aired from Scotland to see that the scheme of church government was such as the Scots expected, and generally to keep an eye on the business In April the system was finally drawn up and forwarded to the House of Commons and on its being accepted a Scotch army of 30,000 men at one marlbed our the border, for pending a, settlement they had returned to their homes 1 Parliament was now satisfied, and lift the assembly) to its own devices It spent all the rest of the year Kilt in discussions of such prolixity) as not only to wear) the people at large, but also to disgust a great number of their own body On May 4 If II It began to be seditious to raise a quorum of 40 out of 111 that a resolution was passed to fine all members I of every time they were later than half-past 8 in applause, but in no) avoided the line by not appearing at ill and it often occurred that no quorum was formed while there were rarely ever so mean) as GO In November strong words were used about the want of zeal of a large proportion of the members Now began the "great conflict V as there to be toleration of other needs Or must all count in to tin ore pattern I he Scotch commissioners with him on that point to tell rate any other sect but the Irish) League was according to them, to crucify the Lord afresh and the general opinion of the assembly was that truth was one, that God could be suitably) worshipped only with truth and that therefore all religions but the true religion should be sternly) repre side The few friends of bert) fought h uel, but it was a useless light and us Milton s 9s (interior I nihil, book HE the issue of) ' taught compulsion without commencement which not long before they complained, of it executed unchristian) against themselves these intents are eli n to have been no better than put christian setting up a spiritual turn) of their own authority above the magistrate whom they would have made their executioner, to punish church debt quencies Milton and no very high opinion of them In his sixteenth sought he calls them Illrelln;

It was then that Milton wrote his Ateopaijiltca or, Speech for the Liberal ii of l/nlicaibcil Ptuilniff, a noble contribution to English literature, and, according to modem taste of singular moderation The Assembly utterly condemned it, tried to bring Milton to punishment for printing it and, failing in that passed resolutions which practically demanded for the church a complete and inquisitorial power over the press. Long and weary were the discussions for a year, and very sick grew the good people of London when at lost in July, 1945, the assembly sent up their scheme of church polity in a detailed shape. There were to be congregational assemblies to meet once a week, classical assemblies to meet once a month, provincial assemblies to meet half yearly, and national assemblies to meet as occasion required. These assemblies were to have power to pry into all sorts of heresies, and to see that the people obeyed the moral law, and to have full control over the press On being presented to Parliament, it was hotly discussed, and the power claimed by the presbyteries much curtailed They were to have no jurisdiction in capital offences, or offences involving ownership of property, and in this modified form the system became law in August, 1945 These alterations excited the indignation of the div men who petitioned for an extension of the church powers but were promptly snubbed by Parliament A year before this in August, 164!, a committee had been appointed to draw up a confession of faith and about this time it finished its labours The document was laid before the general body for ratification, and it is not a matter of surprise if in these stormy times and with such a temper, then devout divines forgot what Dean Stanley calls the Eleventh Commandment " that ye love one another that is the very essence of Christianity, and that essence, in the midst of their polemics they forgot Not only did they not insert a phrase that could wash the feeling that this was an integral part of their faith, but they set an example that showed how little they esteemed that commandment themselves As the good and pious Lnxter says of them in his notable "reply, "they would not have those tolerated who were not only tolerable but worthy in struments and members in the churches, and that those who pleaded for charity could never be heard Meantime the Civil A\ ar is deepening and the issue is slowly evolving Cromwell and Burford have built up that new model army, which is to be a counterpoise to the Scotch and eventually overthrow them With it he has won the battle of Naseby, and the King has taken refuge with the Scotch Army at Kcwail indulging the hope that by submissions still more abject than those of the Parliament, he may yet obtain Scottish and 1 the Presbyterian faction in the House of Commons attempts to disband the new model HI my, which refuses to be dig handed, and on the contrary states the King while he is being handed over by the Scots to the English Parliament Now Cromwell and the Independents are in the ascendant Their motto, though not strictly adhered to, 13 " 1 deration for all and so in a month or two the W Westminster Assembly shrinks to a shadow of its former importance Still it has sent its Confession of Faith to the two Parliaments That in 1 linburgh receives it rather coolly, but pronounces it on the whole in accordance with the W ord of God and it is there passed into law At London it is still more coldly received and two years elapse before it passes its final reading" even then several parts are struck out. Chapters xx - Of Christian liberty and liberty of conscience and chapter Exit \- of marriage and divorce are greatly modified while chapter xxx-' Of church censures containing the passage about the ' keys of the Kingdom of Heaven an I chapter xxxi - Of synods and councils - are expunged altogether In this mutilated form it becomes law under the title of Articles of Robson but it had no long Sway Cromwell would not sit still and see a Presbyterian faction tyrannise over men's consciences Milton tells him (sixteenth Bonnet) Peace bath her victories Tv of Ices reno v no 1 than war no 1 foes arise TherE tear i, to I and our souls with secular 1 dins," Those foes Cromwell dispelled, first by defeating the Scots at Preston and Wigan, and then of Colonel Pride a Purge, when all the lrcaturteiiun members were ignoring ously ejected from the House of Commons Then began the reign of the autocratic Oliver, and the glory of the Assembly of Divines was for ever gone From 1946 to 1953 it continued to hold occasional sittings but only for the trial and licensing of preachers and at last it informally dropped out of existence and no one marked its absence, except where hatred inflamed to 111010 than usual notice of its proceed in" the vast body of the English people had never been in sympathy with it and saw it expire without the smallest sentiment of pity And yet in some respects indeed in many respects it was a body of remarkable vigour and ability Its one great fault was an intolerant arrogance which set the peel pie more in opposition to it than they had over been against Land and his creatures in the days when courtly favour smiled most sweetly upon them Cromwell may have been despotic in his actions but he was rarely unjust, and the autocracy he established was at least better relished by the J English people than the ecclesiastical tyranny of the Presbyterian fiction to BLOW of what manner of men this faction was composed let us look at what Green calls the terrible statute for the suppression of blasphemies an 1 heresies a statute which was devised by the assembly of divines, if not actually shape 1 by them and at their instigation passed into law in 1917 by the Presbyterian majority of the House of Commons in spite of the strong opposition of Cromwell and Vane and the tolerant party According to this dred Uni emanation horn a Christian body any in who denied (1) that there is a God or (2) that food is omniscient or (father the father is God or (I that the hon 13 C on or f) that the Holy Ghost is God, is to be punished with death Any one Denying that (0) these three are one for or (7) that Christ 13 equal with God or (8) that Christ was really an I truly a man or (that Christs Godhead and 111111 hood are two several nature or (10) that his manhood 13 unspotted by sill was to suffer death Any one asserting that (11) Christ did not die (12) Christ did not see, (13) Christ did not ascend in the body into heaven (11) His death is not meritorious for believers, about 1 suffer death Any one assert in,, (1) that the Scriptures are not the work of God or (10) that the bodies of men will not rise again or that (17 there will be no day of judgment was to be put to death and this act passed at the instigation of a Christian assembly enacted that such heretics should suffer death without benefit of clergy no pastor should go near the unholy wretch who was carried out to execution for denying anyone of these doctrines Any one declaring (18) that man hath by nature free will to turn to God or (11 that there is a purgatory or (20) that images are lawful 01 (21) that infant baptism is unlawful orv'-OthntthcJ ord a Day must be observed like a Jewish b ibb ith or (IM) that church "government by press; tench is unchristian or but why prolong the detail any one of these reprobates was to be imprisoned (doubtless among felons and foul smelling running) until he renounced his error And all this at the instigation of a body chosen to draw up a compendium of the ( Christian religion ' Did they comprehen 1 in the faintest degree the very root of that are hon the principle of love and mecktiessnnd brotherhood That all this was seriously meant was shown by the case of 1 ml Best who in that very year 1917 was denounced by the as sembly of divines for denying the doctrine of the 1 ninety and condemned by the Presbyterian majority in the House of Commons to be hanged But Cromwell and the new model army were at hand The House did not dare to go too far for thoughts Cromwell had no sympathy with the area ments and texts of Jicst, he would not tolerate intolerance, and so after two months of wrangling, the man was set at liberty The secret of the national tranquility under Cromwell's yoke was mainly satisfaction at the deliverance from a tyranny of dogmatists. The people largely shared in Milton a view that Presbyter is but priest w at large and witnessed the downfall of the elabor- ite BJ Stem with general delight And when some 10 years later Cromwell joined the King in the stem embrace of death, nww Charles the Second reigned in peace no one wished for any return of the presby tends the Church of England was restored, though not to the full glory of her days of intolerant pride, and the Confession of 1 aim is well as the Statute of BlaspbenueB and Heresies disappeared for ever from the statute book of 1 world but they both con- tinued 111 force in Scotland for a long time It must have been nearly CO years ere the latter died out 111 that kingdom and the former is still as we know, the grim foundation of the Scottish faith
