Thi fjlly of individuals commonly displays itself in extravagancies of love, jeai'JU3} r , ambition, vanity, or revenge; that ox niissei in some absurd faith ; and that of nations in the cravings for Avar without aa object. War for the mere sake of war is ths desire of a lunatic people. The fit seem3 tj have set in upon France and Britain and the United States. Throughout these countries at this moment every body is talking of war, and nobody can tell why. Some millions of people tax their ingenuity is vaia to discover any reason for cutting each others'threats; and yet tliey espscta. dreadful conflict, and are preparing for it as if It were.inevitable. INay, marc—and this is the grand symptom of the frantic'state—taey seem bent on provoking themselves and each other to auger, bv ths display of a jealous spirit, by extravagant pretensions, by raking up old grievances, and by strutting and crowing as if for the mera purpase of picking a quarrel. They like Irish peasants at a fhtr daring e tch other to begin the p:m*y fight. Their only apparent nu'.i.v is thai they are sick «».' p.Mce and prosperii v.

The affairs of nat ions are settled by the men of from thirty to ilfty years of' age. Now of these, whether in i'nmec. or in our own country, or in the United Stnk\s very few have lived as men in time of war, hare indulged in the intoxication of glory, Neither hare they any personal experience ikA K of the miseries of protracted w ar. port ion to their longing* excitement la pro- j for the unLasted j is their indifference to the pe unity of disgust which they have never felt. » The}" are tired of the stale peace, anl going tj battle for the novelty of the treat are j No otherwise can one account for the plain j tendency to war among nations which haveyet to make a quarrel to fight about.
