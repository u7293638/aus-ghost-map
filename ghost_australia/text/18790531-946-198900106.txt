Fairnhougb was 'blown: ?' up ibv means of a tin of gunpowder :thrown; . .through one - ; of, the -.windows ; ..This seemed 'to1, .1)6 ' the signal; 'for a series : of outrages ; of .a 'similar,. .description, ': which; lasted so W and was productive 'of such, fatal effects that' Government at last felt ? itself called upon'to take' the matter in 'hand. ? A Boy at Commission was ap : oointed to investigate it, with power to grant certificates of - indemnity to all who made a full confession 'of their crimes. Broadheadhad foryearsbeen 'Wecretary.'of the gawgrinders' Union, in : connection with which most of the out ' Maes had been committed, but no one '/?uS more vehemently denounced them ' on the platform and in the Press than he had Witnesses having implicated 'him, he nn» called to give evidence, and made onecof the most astounding ? ?'Btetements evSr heard. He confessed £ving employed men to blowup the '//ptemisesof a man named Linley, and lfIfterwards to murder him ; to having 'rSoyed men to shoot John. Helhwell '!fnd 1 Elisha Parker; to blow, up the 'premises of Messrs ^Wheatman fand, °Imlth of Mr Joseph -Wilson,. of/Mr |Sny;ofJo7epbHeLen,andofother people, and of haviDg written threaten- . ing letters, arid of instigated a series of - rattening.' He had probably spent £150 for the commission of these acts, the money having been embeezled from the funds of the Union. The scoundrel received his certificate, but subsequently became an outcast from society, and died from ; softening of the brain. Unfortunately his works live after him We hardly seem to have quite got rid of Peace. He would seem to exer cise, a strange fascination over the minds of young and the illiterate. It will hardly be credited that since his execu tion' no fewer than five cases have oc curred of boys hanging themselves,: or being hanged by ' their comrades, in ^acting the execution, scene at Leeds. ,The i last case was that of , a ! boy. ; of twelve. The father on making the painful discovery . is ? -said V to havo gone ?; but ;; of ''his 'mind. 'Verily, 'the man's; memory .seems to hang about like'the' odour 'of' ati ' uncommonly' vile ' cigar,on,,a, foggy morning. The pnly thought. of ,a- satisfactory nature . con- : nected with the. rascal is that his confes-; sion of having shot tho policeman Cocks i the night before the Bannercross murder \ has proved the ' innocence of : young i Hebron,.. who has been consequently set at liberty..- He is, it seems, to have a ! present of '£1000 — quite a fortune for a man ; in , his ? station, though it: must; be confessed it has been dearly earned.! ! ?
