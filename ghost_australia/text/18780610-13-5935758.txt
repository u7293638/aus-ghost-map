MISSION SUNDAY. In accordance with the recommendation of the Church Assembly, yesterday (Whit Sunday was observed as the Mission Sunday of the diocese of Melbourne, and sermons were preached and collections made in the churches and Sunday schools in aid of the Church of England missions, particularly (as suggested by the assembly) those to the aborigines and Chinese in Victoria. The Bishop of MELBOURNE in the morning preached at Christ Church, St Kilda, to a crowded congregation, taking as his text Acts u . 83, " Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear The first question, he said, was what was that which had been Shed forth, and which all had seen and heard, and the reply was that it was the gift of the Holy Spirit, which was bestowed by Christ, and was a gift above all other gifts What was the object of that gift ÃŽ It was to sanctify the whole human race and prepare them for being with God Two questions might arise, nay, had arisen, and were being asked in our midst viz , if this gift was BO efficacious, why had it not been given sooner in the history of the world and again, why had it not affected the hearts and lives of men more than it appeared to have done? He admitted that these were very natural questions to be asked, and questions which required to be replied to, but he promised first of all that these objectors always seemed to have an unphilosophical notion of humanity God would not compel a man to be good, because compulsion was contradictory to all the ways and works of God If He did SO man would be come as a beast because he would be good because he could not help it, and all free will would be gone Then, again, as to why the gift had not been given before the reason, he said, was that the world was not ready to profit by it, and the reason it had not prevailed more was because God would not force the will of man But what great state or great work had ever been built up in a day, and so it was with Christianity But, some would say, while the world was getting ready to fully receive the gift, what would become of all the souls who died ignorant of the truth ' He must say he thought it was one of the saddest mistakes ever made by any Christian man to think that there was no salvation but through Christ or unless they had heard His name In his early days he had been pained to hear good men plead the cause of heathen missions on the ground that all heathens were in danger of being damned He looked upon that doctrine as not sustained by Scripture Paul had said the times of this ignorance God winked at, and he had also said that on that day God would judge the world that was man-and by the Lord God that was written in their hearts of John again had said that" the More meaning Christ-" was the light that lighted all men that came into the world, and not only that, but he (the bishop) said that God's moral law was wider than the New Testament and he believed that the heathen probation would extend longer than this life He wished not to be misunderstood in what he said he only stated what he found in the Scripture, and therefore he believed it St Peter in his epistle said that Christ " went and preached to the spirits in prison, and during the time of the probation and discipline of these spirits God would deal with them as a just and holy God But he would be told that BUth teaching would paralyse the efforts of the friends of missions Men would say, what is the necessity for them ' God will do His work in His own time. But he (the bishop) said, God forgive all that would act from such a selfish view It was our duty to try and banish all sin and misery out of the world What, he would ask, would be thought of any ministers who would say, " Let the king do his own work * but that was what such a Christian would say who, finding God was just and merciful, said Let him do his own work ' At our own doors, the bishop remarked, in conclusion, there were thousands and myriads of heathens who needed to have the Gospel preached to them, and therefore it was necessary for us all to be up and doing so that, if sin and misery still prevailed, it would not be through our supineness or neglect In the evening, the Bishop preached at St John s, Melbourne, from Luke ix 35 The church was crowded
