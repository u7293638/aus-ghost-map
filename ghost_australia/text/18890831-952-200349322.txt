' 'Did you go into the nursery before wo left, Adelaide !'? ?Yes,' she answered, briefly, hurt a little at his calm ignoring of her appeal. ' Bertie was all right, 1 suppose ?' 1 ' ' Yes, all right.' ! 'You can trust Foster? I hope sho ?will look after the child as faithfully in your absence as when you' are at home.' 'Why, of course. What extraordin ary questions you are asking, Hubert. You alarm me very much.' Her voice shook, and he saw with what an effort she kept her self-control. 'I cannot help myself, Adelaide. I feel as if there were a sword hanging over my head. Whenever you or the child are out of my sight I am in tor -mnnt.' ' ' ' Then you must be ill, Hubert, when such strange fancies' possess you,1 said the young wife, turning her wondering eyes on his face. In the dini light of the carriage lamp she could see how pale and haggard he was, and.what a restless light gleamed in his eye.- She laid her hand on his arm, seeking to soothe Mia ?with, her gentle touch. ? ?- ' I think we must go away sombwhere for a time, Hubert ; to the sunny South, .where- you .wjll forget all your gloomy fancies. .

' Ho smiled, and. slightly shook his head. , :Then thoy relapsea into' silence, which Adelaido Westray felt no inclination to break. She was glad to be still for a little, to try' and think over this trouble which had- come into her- life.

' Adelaide,' Sir Hubert's voice broke tho long silence, '.if you were to learn that I was unworthy, 'would you change towards me ? Should I lose your lovo ?' ? ' I am your wife, Hubert — and there is Bertie,' she answored simply, yet with 'a, strange pathos of wistfulness. 'You try me very hard. If you 'would, only trust me .entirely, and toll me what is .troubling you, it would be better for us both. Here- wo are at homo ! I never ?was. so thankful to seo home, I think, in all my, life before.' ' ' ' The carriago drew, up to tho pillared entrance to West Court, and Sir Hubert, jumping out, helped his wife to alight with his usual careful tenderness. It was a 'dark, starloss night, .'tho nir unseasonably ,,warm and oppres sively still. It.; was almost as if ;'a strongo hush of expectancy hung over tho dark and silent earth. ' How hot it . is !' exclaimed Lady Westray, pushing her hood back from hor golden head and , throwing her cloak off her bare her arms.' ?'

Lady Westray swept past the girl aiid sped downstairs to the kitchen.' '-SirrHubert,: after removing his hat and coat, had gone as usual '.to tho library.

He did nqt hear the light, swift footfall pass his door ; he was.sitting moodily over the fire, his head burned in Tiis hands, a prey to his own gloomy thoughts. In tho kitchen a bevy of 'terrified servants were gathered aborit the nurse, who was rock ing herself to'and fro in her chair, wring in her hands and bemoaning herfnte, for it was to her carelessness that West Court oyred the-1 loss of its heir. When Lady Westray, 'still m hor white: dinner ress, .with ther'spring blossoms, now crushed and:witheredi at' her throat and belt, entered -the kitchen, the group si lently fell apart ; then some of them burst into audible sobs. ' ' Foster, what have you done with my child?' asked her ladyship, in a calm, clear, perfectly passionless voice. At the sight of her mistress tho woman went off into hysterics ; then Lady Westray turned inquiringly to tho others. : ' There is very littlo to toll, my lady,' said the cook, more self-possessed than any of tho rest.

Hubert Westray sprang to his feet, his tall figure quivering with. excitement, the voins on his forehead standing out like knotted cords. ? That was her errand,' he said.in a low thick whisper, oblivious of his wife s un natural calm. 'I ought to have known that revenge brought her here.
