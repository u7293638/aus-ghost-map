Gloucester. [BY TELEGRAPH.] BULAHDELAH, Saturday.-Mr. R. Atkin- son Price has addressed large meetings of the electors at Upper Myall and Crawford. Unanimous votes of confidence in both places were accorded him, and his return is con- sidered certain An Adamstown correspondent writes:- "Great interest was taken in the city election, and the result was received with general satisfaction in this portion of the county. The county election is causing very little excitement. The election of the Pro- fectionists is considered certain, and all that is required is the declaration of the poll. A large majority of electors disapprove of Mr. Wright demanding a poll when he has not a ghost of a show. The Protectionist com- mittee will not be caught napping. Every elector will be brought to the poll, and if Wright's Â£40 goes towards reducing the deflect, the election will be considered all the more satisfactory."
