If, farther, they wish to encourage the sub stitution of modern for ancient languages, they should not handicap the former. A definite principle should be established 'with regard to the official estimate of ancient and modern languages as educa tional factors. If the University look upon Latin as the beat educational agent they are quite right in encouraging its study, and are not justi fied in allowing another to be substituted for it A. University, if it is to be the supreme authority on matters of educa tion, must not allow itself to be swayed 'by popular sentiment. The rulers of it simply say to the public, 'We believe that Latin is the best educational agent of all languages 5 if you want to gain the honours and prizes we have to be3tow and to take advantage of the higher education you must learn Latin.' With such a plain statement of the case as this the public would have to be content, and the result would be that Latin would be learned. And -we fail to Bee how this would militate against the chanee3 of girls to gain high honours. Latin would be a branch of their studies just a3 it is a branch of boya' atudiea, and the mental capacities of girls are fully equal to the study. But if the Univeraity says, ' We do not require you to know Latin ; all we want is that you know som9 other language than English,' they, in abdicating the position followed from time immemorial make it incumbent upon themselves to value proficiency in all languages at the same rate. There can, logically, bs no half -measures. There are two plain courses open to the Univeraity — either to proclaim the equal value of ancient and modem languages as educational factors, or, with the older Universities, to pro claim the greater advantage of Latin. la either case there can be no misunderstand ing, though there are bound to be objec tions. And in the same way girls should either be given an equal chance with boys or their candidature should be dis couraged. That the present system .is unsatisfactory is plain from the numerous complaints which have been made public, as well as from the weighty remark* made yesterday by Mr. Hartley. We have his assurance that the matter will be enquired into, and a3 he is a membar of the Council of the University, we may hope with him that it will be adjusted. When such aa enquiry is held, it should be considered whether French may be substituted fcr Latin, not only at the matriculation bu also in the course for Arts. At present a girl may not take up Latin on entrance, but, if she wants to graduate, she mast pass in both Latin and Greek in the very first year. This means that she ha3 to begin her study of these languages after matriculation. If, instead of Mr. Hartley trying to make the University conform to the standard of the Advanced School, he were to raise that standard, he would come very near to adjusting the difficulty. Girls can learn Latin just a3 well as boya — perhaps better. For the re3t, we may congratulate the school upon its success. There is, of course, every reason why it should be successful. The pupils enjoy the advantage of being taught by the pick of the State school teachers, and by specialists in the various branches of learning. Dr. Cockbum's analysis of the modes of the male and female minds is very interesting, and we are quite at one with him in thinking 'that knowledge generally had lost much in the past from the ex clusion from our academical walks of that Bex which possessed in the most marked degree the intuitional method' of learning. The only subject of extraordinary in terest which ha3 as yet come up for treatment at other speech-days is the question as to whether or not matricu lated students are justified in again pre senting themselves for the matriculation examination. Three of the boys who gained high places in the recent list had passed before, and complaints were made that their second candidature was an injustice to other competitors. They were certainly strictly within their rights in so doing. There i3 a? , yet no regulation forbidding matricu lated students matriculating again, and nothing to render impossible the pleasing picture drawn by one of our corre spondents of grey beards sitting round the tables year after year. The Heaa Master of Prince Alfred College, from which school these three boys went up, thinks there is much to be approved in the proceeding. We fully agree with him as far as one of the boys i3 con cerned, because it was necessary in this case that a pass should be secured in a subject which had not been presented on the occasion of his passing before. The other two simply wanted, as Mr. Chappie puts it, 'to compete for a better position, and for a certificate of adequate acquaintance with more advanced studies.' It is to be observed that the boys did not want to know more, but to have credit for knowing more. If they had desired really to enlarge their knowledge they ought to have been encouraged to proceed ?with their Univeraity course. If Pro fesaor Kelly was right on Wednesday when he said that matriculation was, as it were, but the vestibule to the halls of learn ing, the folly of entering a vestibule again and again without wishing to go further is self-evident. Boys who go on learning instead of falling back to grind the old bones over again may not have as high certificates to show and may not reflect so much - honour on their schools, but they will be doing much better for themselves. We trust that the University will see their way to pre vent matriculated students presenting themselves a second time, and thus make some advance towards emphasizing the true value of matriculation. It is merely a. beginning, and should in no wise be re garded as an end. ] -Tire Aiieged Baby-farmdtg Case. — The enquiry into the cause of the death of the infant known as Maria Robinson came yesterday to a most lame and impo tent conclusion. At one time it was thought that the child's death was due to ill- usage, and the tone of the examination suggested that the Coroner shared thi3 opinion. It is a mistake for anybody occupying such a position to even appear to prejudge in so important a matter. The verdict which follows the medical evidence runs — 'That the deceased died from irritation of the brain, caused by teething. ' The Coroner hereupon thought fit to address Mra. Peters and to express the hope that the case would be a caution to her. If this meant anything it was tantamount to saying — ' The Jury have decided that you didn't kill the baby. I still think you did, and it would be to your own advantage not to kill anybody else ;' or, to put it more tersely — ' The Jury have acquitted you. Don't do it again.' This, to say the least of it, was not respectful to the Jury ; but Mrs. Peters evidently thought the remark deserved and was becomingly penitent. There are other respects in which exception might be taken to the conduct of the case. The investigation should have been ex tended further, and strict enquiry should have been made as to whether sections 100 and 101 of the Destitute Persons Act, 1881, had been complied with, and, if bo, in what respects they had proved Inadequate to meet such a case as the present. Section 100 provides for granting licences to 'fit and proper persons to be foster-mothers or wetnursesj' while the next section imposes a penalty o? £20 on any person 'who not being in an establishment under the control of the Board, or not being licensed by the Board, shall with or without fee or reward, act as foster-mother or wetnurse, or take the sole care of any child, whether legitimate or illegitimate,' without a certificate from a duly qualified medical man. Had Mrs. Peters such a licence or certificate ? The Destitute Commission found thatthe above provisions have proved beneficial, but 'we fear that they have been frequently evaded. The fear of the penalties may have largely diminished baby-farming of a not very serious character j but where there is 'no well-considered scheme for enforcing' the ilaw the persona who most require supervision may evade it. As it is admitted on all hands that the Act is notoriously evaded, while the mortality of illegitimate children is very large, something should ba done to make the law respected. It would afford a further protection to life if a penalty was imposed on those who place out infants with unlicensed or uncertificated women. In this connection the conduct of Mr. J. L. Sinclair, who entrusted the child to the care of a woman whose name even he did not know, is open to censure. It is to be presumed that the Destitute Board will take action in so flagrant a case as Mrs. Peters's and prosecute her for under taking the ? case of a child without being licensed under the Act. The way in which she prevaricated and contradicted herself in giving evidence was strangely inconsistent with the idea of innocence, and in her conduct some justification is to be found for the Coroner's novel censure upon her after she had been practically pronounced not guilty. ' ? ^^ The Govebsoe's Visit to Poet Pibie.— His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by the Minister of Education (Hon. Dr. Cockburn), the Aide-de-camp (Lieutenant Williams) and Private Secretary (Mr. Hafcton Bichards), left Adelaide by special train for Jamestown on Thursday evening, en route to Port Pirie, where His Excellency is to open the new local Institute this afternoon. The party stayed at Dr. Cockburn's residence on Thursday night. This morning a Besond party of gentlemenleave town by special train for the scene of the festivities. They will join the vice-regal party at Jamestown and proceed without delay to Port Pirie, which place will be reached early in the afternoon. To-night will he spent in Port Pirie, and the whole of the visitors will return to the city by special train to-morrow evening. It may be mentioned that only a portion of the handsome block of buildings shown on the plans of the Institute have been erected, the necessary funds for the completion of the work not being forthcoming. The contract for this portion was let to Mr. J. Cleave for £2,494. It consists of a large hall 75 feet long by 45 feet wide and 28 feet high, lighted on one side by five large slim-headed windows with enclosed pilasters and archi traves round them, to which there are blank openings opposite to correspond. This hall will afford accommodation for 450 persons, and will be ventilated, together with the remainder of the building, on the Tobin system. Corinthian pilasters divide the walls of the room into five bays, and snp pott an enriched Corinthian entablature with cove, and doubly enriched soffit mouldings on the cornice. The stage arch is handsomely finished, and is 20 feet wide by 16$ feet high The stage 13 2 feet above the floor of the hall, acd 20 feet wide by 15 feet in depth. There is a platform in the front 45 feet long and 15 feet in depth. On one side of the stage there is a dressing-room 15 feet by 12 feet, and on the other side a reading-room 16 feet by 15 feet. A'Corporation-room, 18 feet by 15 feet, completes thi3 portion of the building, which will be entered by fourdoora, all opening outwards. The height of all the rooms is the same— 17 feet. The building has teen erected of white freestone fromNapper ty, with cement dressings, and foundations ?f jarrah timber. The additions to be added n future comprise on the first floor an mtrance-hall, 27 feet by 12 feet ; a reading ?com and library, 27 feet by 27 feet; a unseam, 27 feet by 18 feet— all 14 feet in height. A staircase will lead to the first Boor, on which there will be a meeting-room, 27 feet by 27 feet; two offices, 27 feet by 18 feet and 18 feet by 12 feet respectively —all 13 feet high. This erection will be finished externally with cement dressings, and the centre will be broken by a pediment. The ground floor will be lighted with square headed windows, and the first floor with semi-headed windows. All the windows will have cornices and enriched blocks above. The main entrance will be approached by a flight of four steps. When the plans are carried out the Institute will be one of the largest and most complete the colony con tains. . The [architects are Messrs. English and Soward, of Adelaide. The foundation stone was laid by the then Chief Secretary (Hon. J. Colton) on December 12, 1S84. TheCheistmas 'Obssevee.'— The Christ mas number of the Adelaide Observer, which is obtainable to-day, is as usual specially attractive. Additional to the ordinary forty-eight-page paper are two supplements. One is a spirited picture representing a sailor saving from a wrecked Bhip a mother and her little child. The other consists of sixteen pases of seasonable literature. The first noticeable feature therein is a pathetic poem, 'Christmas Guests,' by Lindsay Duncan ; and the next ' Chill December : the Christ mas Story of a Dartmoor Storm,' written especially for this number of the Observer by the well-known novelist G. Manville Fenn. The author writes in his most effective style. The tale throughout is graphically told and intensely interesting. The 'Ne'er -Do -Well' contributes 'The Haunted Bungalow : A Teaplanters' Story,' which has all the characteristics of a ghost yarn of the good old fashion, which caused onr forerunners to draw close together as they listened, eagerly but fearsomely, in the cosy nurseries at home. ' The Plumpndding Party' is an amusing little morsel for the Australian lasses of to-day, and the little lads will read with delight Lindsay Duncan's rhythmical ' Tale of a Tailor,' while children generally will be pleased with the same author's narrative of the adventures of 'Lottie and the Wombat.' 'My First Buahranger' is distinctively an Australian sketch. The author of ' In Sackcloth and Ashes' gives an additional attraction to an already attractive story by the pre fatory note concerning one of bis characters. ' It may possibly be remarked that Squire Pecheridse bears a strong resemblance to Mr. Mopes in *Tom Tiddler's Ground,' by Charles Dickens. I remember that Charles Dickens, in company, I believe, with the late Lord Lytton, paid a visit to the hermit, whom I have introduced under the above mentioned names, and I afterwards heard it frequently stated that the latter was highly indignant at the way io which, as he con sidered, the great novelist held him ud to ridicule and contempt, and misrepresented his motives in the story referred to.' This budget of Christmas literature contains other poetical pieces besides those specially noted. Chief of these is the story of ' How Bob Found Out Who He Wa3,' by a valued regular contributor. The ' JRiddler' gives a special collection of serious, entertaining, and brain-puzzling conundrums, and caps the lot with a big ' Mince-Pie,' made up of all sorts of odds and ends, which even the mental dis peptic may indulge in freely without the faintest fear of resulting biliousness. RESIGNATION OF THE REV. W. F. TURTON. —At a meeting of the members of the Con- gregational Church, Hindmarsh, a few days ago, the Rev. W. F. Turton, pastor of the Church, tendered his resignation, which was accepted. Mr. Turton's connection with the Church has been very brief, he having suc- ceeded the Rev. John McEwin a few months ago. The members expressed deep regret when his proposed withdrawal was announced, and requested him to recon- sider his decision, but to no purpose. Mr. Turton is now in Melbourne, where he will preach as a candidate for the pastorate of a new Church at North Fitzroy. BISHOP REYNOLDS'S TWELFTH ANNIVERSARY IN ADELAIDE.— At St. Francis Xavier's Hall on Thursday evening, December 17, a hearty greeting was recorded to the Roman Catholic Bishop of Adelaide on his return from the Plenary Council at Sydney, and two addresses were presented to him in con nection with the twelfth anniver sary of his appointment as Bishop of the Diocese. Dr. Reynolds alluded, in reply, to the fresh efforts towards the exten tension and consolidation of the Church in this colony which he intended to make shortly, and dwelt upon the indefatigable zeal shown by the delegates at the Plenary Council. He also announced his intention of carrying on his work in South Australia until death or infirmity removed him. Gawlee Public School.— The annual entertainment in connection with the Gawler Public School was held at the Institute Hall on Wednesday evening, December 16. Major Plummer, the Head Master, said the high standard fixed this year accounted for the seemingly small results as compared with former occasions. A long and varied pro gramme, consisting of solos, choruses, and recitations, was gone through, and the children acquitted themselves in a highly creditable manner. The exhibition of calis thenics was remarkably good. In the solos Master A. Cheek, in 'He was such a Nigger,' was decidedly the best, the encore being genuine and hearty. Miss V. Plummer was the best reciter, her rendering of ' Trusty and True' being very good. The choruses weie given with much spirit, that entitled 'See Saw' being particularly interesting. During the evening Mr. W. F. Wincey, J.P., distributed some very nice books as prizes to the successful scholars in the higher division, and a hearty vote of thanks— proposed and seconded by two boys— was accorded the Board of Advice for the interest manifested in them. Major Plummer and Mr. J. W. Cole are to be congratulated upon the efficiency and ability shown by their scholars. South Australian Association,— At a meeting of this Association— Mr. A. W, Meeks in the chair— held on Tuesday, December 15, the auestion of establishing Civil Service Board was again discussed, and the following resolution was submitted :— 'That, in the opinion of this Association, a better regulation of the Civil Service is necessary, and that to bring this about a measure on the lines of the Victorian Public Service Act should be introduced into the Legislature at the earliest possible opportu nity.' It was stated that Mr. Service's estimate of the saving to be immediately effected by the Public Service Board was £25,000 per annum, and this saving would be further increased in years to come ; that one of the advantages derived had been in trans ferring officers from one department to another, and in thus keeping all the officers of the service fully engaged from 9 in the morning to 4.30 in the afternoon ; that each one of them in coming into the office in the morning had to sign a timebook, which was removed at live minutes past 9 o'clock, and this rendered a personal explanation to the head of the depaitment necessary in the event of an officer arriving after that time ; that each officer had to make a weekly report of the work he had been engaged at, and the length of time occupied by various portions of it; that once a quarter the head of the department had to report to the Board any unsatisfactory or careless condust on the part of his officers. Various other improve ments effected by the Board were mentioned, and it was agreed that the subject was of so much importance that it was better to defer the passing of a resolution until after the recess. The meeting then adjourned till the beginning of March. The Arcade Baths— The hot and Turkish baths established in the Arcade by Messrs. Bastard & Needham being now ready for use were open for inspection on Thursday. The entrance is through a shop, where an atten dant will direct the bather to the ladies' or gentleman's department, which are arranged to secure complete privacy. The walls being tiled and the baths enamelled facilities for cleanliness are ensured. The general fittings are neat and conveniently arranged, A sulphur bath will alBO be available in connec tion with the hot batb.3, a chamber being pre pared specially for the purpose. Aflight of stairs leads to the apartment devoted to the Turkish bath. On the landing an attendant is in waiting to take charge of any valuables bathers may wish to leave in his care. Here a suite of dressing-rooms afford accommodation for preparing to enter the hot chamber. Inside this there are appliances for the preliminary warm shower before proceeding to the sweat ing-room, which is filled up with wooden couches, on which bathers rest until they are prepared to place themselves under the treat ment of a powerful West Indian, whose duty it is to perform the shampooing. The next process, cooling, is carried on inside a metal cylinder, from the sides of which the water, graduated in temperature from hot to cold, is forced on the bather in fine jets until the pores are closed, and the bather is ready to enter the adjoining room— the saloon. This apartment is comfortably fitted up, and a reBt in it will provide an agreeable termination to the bath. Arrangements are made for serv ing visitors with refreshments. The hot water and air are supplied by a furnace at the rear of the premises, pipes and flues beinz so constructed as to facilitate the regulation of the temperature of both elements, as well as to secure proper ventilation. The estab lishment being conveniently situated should, under the management of the present proprie tors, become popular. The Paekside Lunatic Asylum.— The inmates of this institution, thanks to the Resident Medical Officer (Dr. Cleland), are not forgotten at Christmas time. As the close of each year approaches the doctor arranges for certain festivities which are shared in by the inmates of the Adelaide Lunatic Asylum. Thursday, December 17, was the day fixed this year, and a better afternoon could hardly have' been desired. Shortly after 4 o'clock the men and women of both Asylums, to the number of over £?0, assembled on the lawn at the Parkside institution and tripped the light fantastic to the stirring music of the Police Band, the members of which had kindly placed their services at the dis posal of Dr. Cleland. Games of all kinds were indulged in, and the afflicted ones thoroughly enjoyed themselves. After full justice had been done to the refreshments an adjournment was made to the chapel, where a medley entitled 'Maid Marion' was performed by lady and gentle man amateurs. The building had been taste fully decorated for the occasion and was crammed, the audience including several leading citizens and ladiea who had accepted invitations to be present A stage was erected, and fully answered the requirements. Mr. G. M. Evan read a suitablo prologue ex plaining the medley, of which Dr. Cleland and Mr.E. Cleland wewtheauthors. Thepiecewas sparkling, funny, well localized, and alto gether was admirably suited for the occasion. It was also placed in competent hands, the company appearing to great advantage. They have for some time past carefully rehearsed it, and their efforts were attended with suc cess. The inmates were thoroughly pleased with the performance and did not neglect to how their appreciation of it, At the close Sir Samuel Davenport, in a complimentary speech, proposed a vote of thanks to the authors, which was acknowledged by Dr. Cleland. A similar compliment was also paid to the ladies and gentlemen who took part, on the motion of Mr. G. Glen, Mr. Evan replying. Refreshments were again handed round, and previous to dispersing the inmates availed themselves of an opportunity to try their fortune in lucky bags. The whole affair was a success and thoroughly enjoyable Shortly after 10 o'clock 'Good-night' was said, and the inmates of the Adelaide insti tution, were conveyed home. It should be mentioned that Messrs. Rosenhain, Panerochs, and others acting as musicians gave their services gratuitously. Dr. Cleland acknowledges, among other gifts, the receipt of a box of sweetmeats from Mr. D. Bell, of Strathalbyn, and a box of pipes from Messrs. Dnngey, Ralph, & Co. ; The Alleged Baby-faemtng Case.— The Coroner's enquiry into the cause of death of the infant exhumed at the Woodville Cemetery, and about which Home very ugly rumours were cir culated, terminated on Thursday after noon, when the Jury returned a verdict that the deceased died from irritation of the brain, caused by teething. The only additional evi dence called was that of Dr. Corbin and Pro fessor Rennie, who respectively madethepost mortem examination, and analysed the con tents of the stomach. Dr. Corbin thought the deceased had been well cared for, but the remains were too decomposed to allow him to state the cause of death. He could find no trace of poison, neither did Professor Rennie. The Coroner remarked strongly upon the behaviour of the woman Peters, charac terizing her as the most untruthful witness he ever examined. He also referred to the loose nature of Mr. Sinclair's transaction with her in disposing of the child. Hindmaesh Volunteer Fiee Brigade.— TheJ anniversary of the above brigade was observed on Thursday evening, December 17-Lat the Institute Hall, Hindmarsh (the free use of which was granted by the Institute Committee). The brigade had announced that ladder exercise and general practice would take place outside the Institute building, but six to seven hours' active work at the Adelaide fire on Wednesday night and Thursday morning had incapacitated the men for ' fancy' work. However, the reel was brought out, and the smartness of the men in fixing the hydrant and obtaining water from the main was witnessed by a large number of persons, The Mayor of Hindmarsh (Dr. J. Rees, J.P.) presided at the public meeting. Captain John Reid read the annual report, which stated that shortly after the brigade was organized the residents subscribed over £100, and with a donation of £20 from the Corpora tion over £134 had been obtained. The brigade had been in training during the past year, and had made themselves acquainted with the water-valves iu the town. The ex pansion of the town would necessitate another reel being stationed in the northern portion of the district. Captain Reid men tioned that to keep up the efficient state of the reel appliances costing about £30 would be required during the ensuingyear, and he had no doubt the amount would be forthcoming. The Mayor mentioned that a short time since an alarm of fire was given, which turned out to be about half a mile (Croydon) from the reel station, but within ten minutes of the alarm the brigade were on the spot with the reel, and the water turned on to the fire. (Cheers.) He felt sure that the residents would show their sympathy with the brigade. The .financial statement was read by the Honorary Treasurer (Fireman A. Burnell), which showed that the expenditure had exceeded the income by a trifle under £2. Mr. Joseph Ashton proposed the reappoint ment of the officers as follows :— Patrons— Dr. John Rees (Mayor), Messrs. F. E. Buck nail, M.P., A. Harvey, M.P., and Caleb Peacock, J.P. President— The Mayor of Hindmarsh, and eighty Vice-Presidents. On the motion of Mr. James Laurence, seconded by Councillor Brooker, a vote ot thanks was accorded to the brigade for their past services. Taken Home.— The disinterment of the remains of a Chinaman, after being buried for twenty years, has just been effected at the old cemetery, Ballarat, accompanied by certain mystic Chinese ceremonies. The Courier says:— 'In 1865 a Chinaman, named Yen Lem, hung himself in the Chinese camp, owing to heavy gambling losses. Recently a cousin of the deceased, named Wee Too, who is going to China, applied to the Solicitor-General for permission to take the bones of his rela tive out of the cemetery, in order to take them to China with him, where they will be placed in the family burying ground. Permission was granted, and on Thursday the grave was opened in the presence of the sexton. The bones of the Chinaman were not decayed, and a Chinese cook undertook the task of descend ing and gathering up the remains. He acci dentally fell in, but did not sustain any injury. Addressing the skull in his own language he informed it that he was going to take it to China, where it would be happier. The bones were then got out and placed in their proper positions on the ground, there being a fear on the part of the Chinese that if the legs or arms got mixed that the journey could not be comfortably performed. Around each bone was placed a piece of paper denoting its position and name, and the whole of the bones were then put in a bag, together with some coins and cards. A large quantity of gold and silver paper was burned, in order that the late Yen Lem might not run short of money during the voyage. Wee Too, who is to travel to China with the remains, then seized the bag, and for about half an hour wandered about the ceme tery, breathing words of affection into the bag containing the remains. This was con tinued from the cemetery to the camp where the cousin resides.' RThe Unemployed. — On Thursday 31 additional names of men out of work were re ceived at the Government Labour Bureau. There were 20 married men, 9 single men, and 2 widowers. Of the 31 25 were labourers, 2 masons, 1 ganger, 1 blocker, 1 stonecutter, and 1 blacksmith. With the exception of 7 all the men have chosen work, and received passes where necessary. Twelve have elected to break atones in North Adelaide, 2 to do similar work in Port Adelaide, 9 go to Hergttt, and 1 to Beetaloo. . The Rev. A. Turnbull and a committee have banded together and opened an enquiry office in the Crusadera' Hall, Gouger street. The object is to ascertain the reason so comparatively few men have applied to the Government for work, and the reason such a large proportion who accept work do not fulfil the engagements entered into. Visit of the Chamber or Manufactures to Seppeltsjteld.—Oii Thursday morning Messrs. D. Adamson (Vice-President), J. J. Green, D. Gall, T. Hardy, F. Forwood, J. Duncan, McDonald, and J. F. Conigrave (Secretary), representing the Chamber of Manufactures, left Adelaide by the first train for Freeling, with a view of inspecting the Seppeltefield vineyards. Arrived at Freeling vehicles were found waiting to take the party to their destination, the drive through Greenock being a very enjoyable one. On arriving at Seppeltsfield they were met by Mr. B. Seppelt, who hospitably entertained the visitors. After refreshments had been partaken of the party was shown over the beautiful Seppeltsfield estate, which was found to be in first-class condition. While going through the establishment the extensive cellarage ac commodation showed the enterprise of the owner, who is compelled to in crease hifl accommodation, despite the fact that ha can now store many thousand gallons of liquor, The wine cellars having received due attention the vinegar storerooms were entered, and the importance of this trade, which is growing rapidly through the character of Seppeltafield vinegar having been so favourably commented on, was testified to by the large storage capa city. Mr. Seppelt then took his guest? through his distillery, where the whole processes adopted in the manufac ture of wine and vinegar were explained, and the advantageous labour-saving appliances were pointed out. This part of the establish muni vAAAina^ AAnaii1aMi)\1a o4+«*»*-£r\\*» f«Atn the visitors, who were also delighted with the completeness of Mr. Seppelfs labora tory. Other interesting items having been inspected, the party, after again enjoying the hospitality of Mr. Seppelt, were driven to Freeling, where they caught; the train, reach ing Adelaide at twenty minutes past 7 o'clock, rhe visit throughout was a most enjoyable Dne. Precautions against Cholera. — The Sovernment officially intimate in the Qaztite of Thursday that all Queensland, Sumatra, and Java ports must be regarded is infected, so that all vessels coming from them to South Australia shall be placed in quarantine.

Dr. Cockburn) presided and de livered an interesting address on the subjeot }f the admission of women to the Universi ties. Mr. Hartley (the Inspector-General of Schools) also spoke, and referred to the dis advantages under which girls labour in the matriculation examinations. The girls were becoming disheartened; but an enquiry would be made into the matter, and he boped it would be satisfactorily adjusted, rhere was a large attendance, Novembee Land Sales. — The amount paid into the Treasury during November on account of land sales was £8,715 2s. 9d.

City Improvement.— A contract has been taken for the erection of a new building for the Bank of Australasia, the tender of Mr. J, Jude having been accepted. The demolition cf the old structure, which was, we believe, designed and erected under the superinten dence of the late Sir George Kingston some thing like a generation ago, will be begun at once, and the new work will follow as speedily as circumstances will permit.

The number of passengers carried on the various lines was 319,598, and the weight of goods 49,823Jtons. Chinamen's Speech-day,— Not the least important of the work connected with the City Mission is the education of the Chinese. About three years ago an evening school was commenced, and by persistent and patient labour the teaching has been very successful. There are thirty-four scholars on the roll, and twenty-four teachers are under the con ductorship of Miss Green, Mr. J. Jarvis, und Mr. Stace, who take an evening each in the week, The teachers ask for more jjassis tance because their attendance is neces earily irregular, and the scholars have to be taught singly, for the most part not having advanced sufficiently to go into classes. The instruction principally is reading and writing ; the copybooks are admirably clean and well written, such as would shame many an Aus tralian boy. On Wednesday evening the teachers provided a tea for their scholars, and afterwards a meeting was held, presided over by Mr. J. J. Green in the unavoidable absence of the Re^. F. W. Cox. Speeches were delivered by Mr. J. Jarvis and Mr. Stace addressed to the Chinamen. Lung War addressed his fellow- countrymen with some amount of enthusiasm and in very creditable English, Ahymnwassungby SueShingChung and Yoob Kee with some amount of musical tone and fair enunciation. Sue War (com monly known as Way Lee, of the firm of Way Lee & Co.), on behalf of the Chiuese, thanked the teachers for their great kind ness, and also the good number of friends who attended that evening. At the close of the meeting the Chinese presented each teacher with some handsome presents and a Christmas greeting, written by themselves, and are thus continually showing their appreciation of the efforts put forth on the'r behalf. The school will now be in recess until the middle of January. Embezzlement.— On Wednesday night the police arrested George John Clode, at the Berkshire Hotel, Glenelg, on a charge of em bezzlement. Clode was acting in the capacity of collector for Mr. W. Filgate, of Tattersall's Club, who was acting as trustee for Mr. J. Madden. He had been gathering money about a fortnight, but some few days ago it was discovered that £12 was missing. A warrant was issued without delay, and Clode will pro bably appear at the Court this morning, charged with embezzling £12. HospitalItems.— On Wednesday nighttwo men were admitted into the Adelaide Hospital suffering from wounds sustained through acci dentB. Their names were Philip Cunningham and William Townsend. The former had a broken leg, and the latter, who fell from a roof in the neighbourhood of the fire at Coombe's timber-yard, was otherwise injured. South Atjstraiian Representatives at Sir P. Scratchley's Funeral.— By mistake it was announced in Wednesday's Register that Brigadier-General Owen was at Sir Peter Scratchley's funeral. The General is in Ade laide. South Australia was officially repre sented at the funeral by His Honor Mr. Justice Boucaut, but Captain Mitchell and Lieutenant Owen were also present in uni form. Ensilage in me North.— Mr. Lattimer, Manager of the Booyoolie Station, has shown us C Areas Express) some ensilage from the silos at Booyoolie. The underground one has but recently been filled. Its holding capacity is about SO tons, and two pits of 40 tons each have just been opened. The ensilage is in capital order, not the slightest sign of mouldi ness, although this was feared. The fodder is beautifully fresh, and has a remarkably wholesome smell. It cuts almost like cheese, and is sweet and moist. The sheet) and pigs eat this with great relish, as also do the stock. Drayloads of the ensilage are carted from the silo and distributed about the run. It has also another worthy recommendation, and that is that not a single straw is wasted. The samples brought to our office are perhaps the finest specimens of cured fodder that can be obtained from any other silo in this colony. There are two stacks on the run which con tain ensilage, well pressed by heavy logs of timber. This is lucerne in excellent condi tion, The only difficulty they have at the station is in keeping the stock away from the stacks when they happen to be in the lucerne paddocks. The crop of lucerne is now looking remarkably well, and to look at it no one would imagine that already this season had this paddock been twice cut. Farmers would do well to inspect these stacks, as no doubt it means a wonderful saving, besides being of immense value to sheep and cattle. We hope to see the second pit opened at Booyoolie with the same satisfactory results as that which at tends the pit now being cut. The Geographical Society's Exhi bition.— The Hon. Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Geographical Society of Australasia (says the Argus) has re ceivei from the Council of the New South WaleB Branch the following informa tion in reference to the collection of speci mens brought back from New Guinea by the Society's exploiing expedition :— ' The collec tions are now being unpacked for exhibition in the late Art Gallery. We are all agree ably surprised at the number of specimens acquired, and the sketches, scientific obaerva ions, &c;, appear to be very good. We shall le able to «how the public that the expedi ion has done really good work. After ex ibition here your share will be sent to Melbourne, and most of the botanical pecimens (of which there are about 1,000 n all) will be forwarded to Baron von dueller for classification. Captain Everill's cap of the Fly River— from Kewai to ta junction with the Strickland and the oune of the latter river from its junc ion with the Fly to the highest point cached (about lat. 5° 20* S.)? and thejonctioa i the Service River with the Strickland— is a hand for the lithographer. The nature of he soil, description of vegetation, geological ormation, &c;, of the country traversed by he expedition will be indicated, and the aap will be as complete a record as possible f the work done by Captain Everill and the cientific staff under his leadership.' Drought and Floods.— A correspondent 1 the Sydney Morning Herald, in a letter inder the heading of 'The Drought and Hoods,' mentions some curious anticipations ehich are said to prevail among the blacks oncerning the weather. He aava : — 'Amongst the many strange things told is lately in connection with the Ironght are the extraordinary efforts put orth by the blacks in various parts of Australia to prepare for a wet season. At oar itation Dumble, on the Bokairaarul Biree Jivers, the whole of the males are busy sngagefl in constructing canoes, and as far aa hey can possibly do are laying in stocks of irovbions. When asked what is meant by hese preparations, they say, ? Big fellow flood ome along directly, swim everywhere.' I see »y telegraph this morning that the blaek3 at Jourke are making similar preparations. But me of the most remarkable things, telling us here muBt be some widespread belief in heavy veather coming to us soon, is, a3 our Manager at Townsville informs us, that all he native tribes around there have removed heir mia-mias (dwellings) from the low round up on to the hills, and the whole of hem are especially industrious in collecting ood, half-roasting the same, and preserving t for times of scarcity. When questioned iy our Manager there as to their reasons, bey explained, * Very, very big water come long soon.' When asked why they thought o, some of the more intelligent of them -ointed to the clouds and sky, saying, ' See, ee.' But like the bare foot on the naked ock which the blackfellow can discern, bat vhich no white man's eye can follow, our Manager was unable to discern any signs of ?he impending change. What is the reason if these instinctive preparations amongst our videspread aboriginal races? Over 1,500 niles of our continent they are known to us jersonally. Have they bo attentively observed ihe appearance of the heavenB by day and by light, and transmitted their knowledge fiom ;eneration to generation, a3 to see atmos )heric changes pending long before the white nan, with all his scientific appliances? We ;hink so. I shall be glad to furnish yon vith any further information coming to me -n this subject. I am now making enquiries is to the habits of the blacks in Northern Queensland, on the Diamantina and further ioutb, as far as the Murrumbidgee, ilthough I anticipate nearly every true iboriginal on the Murrumbidgee will have ost that keen perceptiveness so marked tmong races where the white man's influence 8 less felt.' With regard to the apprehea lions of the Townsville blacks, it is note vorthy that since these were mentioned parts -f Northern Queensland have experienced ixtraordinarily destructive hurricanes and looda. Incompetency of Regimental Comaun 3EBS. — The Times, mentioning some of tha esults of our recent experiences of warfare n the Soudan, says that one grave fact forced tself upon the attention of the authorities in rhe shape ot the incompetence of some of the -egimental commanding officers. Lord SVblseley (the Times says) wrote a dis patch upon this subject to the late Secre ;ary of State for War, who, af:er le left office, put a motion for i&3 production upon the Notice-paper of tha Eouse of Commons. But, in consequence, as is mderstood, of the usual professional military abjections, it has never been made public, [ts general purport, however, is an open 3esret, and we have good reason for believing that Lord Wolseley went so far as to say that the incompetence of some — and no!; * small proportion too— of tha command ing officers was such that, although the regiments were composed of good materials, he did not feel justified in sending them to the front, out of regard to the safety of the men and the efficient execution )f the public service. The state of things thus disclosed may not surprise those ac quainted with the personnel of the army. But when it is officially recorded by the [!ommander - in - Chief of an expedition that the lives of the men ani the honour of the country are endangered by the incompetence of those who command regiments and who exercise the greatest influence upon efficiency, it is manifest that no Secretary for War can Buffer the continu ance of the system under which, these oBbera are permitted to attain the position. Seni ority as the qualification for command must promptly disappear. Kensington Oval. — The Kensington Association intend holding the second of a series of moonlight concerts on Kensington Oval on Monday, 21st inst.
