VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB. [Abridged from the Daily Telegraph.] Bboomd Day—Satubday, OcrobBB 15. ] The magnlfioent weather on Saturday, com bined with the very attractive programme iaaned by the Olnb, induced an immense orowd of persons to visit the charming raoecourse at Oaulfield, which, after the recent rains, looked deligbtfnL The trains were orowded to excess; in many of the carriages there was scarcely standing room., the railway authorities allowing as many persons as liked to enter the different compartments, perfectly regardless of the number a carriage was supposed to hold. Had anything gone wrong the conaequenoes would have been fearful. A slight aooident did ooour to the train whioh left at 12.26 p.m. Shortly after leaving the Brighton line the train was bronght to a standstill, in oonseqnenoe of something having gone wrong with one of the coupling irons. This created some uneasi ness amongst the passengers, bat, fortanstely, it was soon pat right, and the train prooeeded on its journey. A considerable number of ladies were present at the r&oes;, and the Grand Stand, lawn, and saddling pad dock presented a orowded appearance. Bia excellency the Governor, aooom panied by Lord Hervey Phipps, drove to the course in bis Stanhope phaeton, and remained daring the day. The raoing was most interest ing and exciting, and everything passed off pleasantly, with one exception, and that was the incompetency of the Jndge in negleoting to plsoe a third horse in the O&ulfield; Oop. Many persons were of opinion that the race was given to the wrong horse, bat the finish was so close that it was quite impossible for any odo but the Judge to decide this point;there was noexonie, however, for bis not placing a third horse. Woodlands, who, in the opinion of many, won, was either second or third; we think he occu pied the second position. Master Avenel jnst managed to get hie head in front opposite the winning-post. Woodlands (who by-the-by was our .sporting reporter's "tip" directly the weights came ont) was baeked for a heap ef money to get a place; therefore there is every excuse for persons grumbling and. being dis satisfied wben they will have to pay ioatead of xeoeive. Mr. Smith, the Jndge, no doabt did his beat, but we edvise the Olnb in futnre to place b gentleman in the box who understands the important duty. The raoe for the Findon Harriers Gold Onp was most interesting, and created any amount of amass ment, and the Olnb will find it a " fine draw" if it is on the programme again next year. It was a pretty and exciting sight to see a field of twenty horses tidden by gentlemen in orthodox hunting costume, aBd the numeroos baulks and spills added to the fan. Many of the riders were evidently novices at pnblio raoiog, for they bad their whips and spurs at work before they had gone half a mile, and made the pace anoh a cracker that it led to so many coming to grief. The finish of the Oanlfield Gap was one of the best ever seen in Viotoria. At the torn for borne more than balf the field were fairly in the race, and it was quite impossible at that jnnotnre to say what would win, although Pirate, on the inaide, had just the beat of it. Woodlands, who bad been disappointed once or twice, managed to get through his horses at this point, and Master Avenel and Sardonyx, who were in a good position, entered the straight almost together, and one of the most desperate races home ever witnessed took place between the four horses. Piggot on Mister Avenel, and King on Woodlands, both displayed rare skill as horsemen, and rode like artists, whilst Sardonyx was well handled by Nicholson. Both Wood lands and Master Avenel came on stride by stride, and, oatcbiDg Pirate jnst inside the winning post, Master Avenel landed the race by a short beBd amidst the wildest excitement. No one caold tell what bad won nntil the numbers were np. Sardonyx was close alongside the winner, and several horses together close behind. Canary was never once dangerous in the raoe. I Respite tail well until the tnrn for home, and then, when the reel plnoh came, he collapsed. The pace was made by Gonzago, Santa Olaus (who ran mnch better tban he did in the Guineas), Mercnry, and Snwarrow. The rider of Pirate tried to main* every post a winning poet after he had gone lialf a mile, whioh most have interfered with hie horse, who ran most determinedly throughout. The Nursery Handi cap and the Findon Harriers Gold Onp both produced exciting finishes, and altogether the day's racing was of the most interesting charac ter. Many of the horses were in splendid con dition. Nothing looked better than Wood lands, and Jones, his trainer, deserves every credit. If there was a fanlt in him he was perhaps just a trifle above himself. Pirate snd Master Avenel were both very fit, bnt Bardooyx looked a little overdone; still he ran a good game colt. The following are the results:— SECOND HANDICAP HDBDLI BACK. A. sweepstakes of 8 aovs. each, with 75 sova. added. One mile and a half. Mr. M. Nejion'a b g. Van Tromp, 5 yrs., 9 st. 7 lb.

Marie rushed to the front, and led put the stand and up the hill, followed by Van Tromp and Black Prinoe, the hurdle at the top bringing Pathfinder down, and as he did not move for some minotes, it was pretty generally thought that he had broken his neck. The mare oon tinned the lead, none of the others beiDg able to get np to her, Batty, who was riding Van Tromp all the way, beirg second, twenty lengths behind her. At the second-last hurdle, near the turn into the straight, Marie bolted, and ran into the fence, which left Van Tromp in front, and going at his leisure he beat .Zanga as he liked, Bportsman a bad third.
