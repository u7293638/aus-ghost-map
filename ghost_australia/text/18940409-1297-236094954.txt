THE SCHOOL OF ARTS. The attendance at tho lantern lecture in tho School of Arts on Saturday evening must have been gratifying to the promoters of these entertainments, as it was much larger than at any of the preceding exhibitions of the course. The subject of the lecture was " A Visit to tho Land of the Rising Sun — Great Japan," and the photographs which illustrated it were very beautiful indeed. Mr. P. J. Gaudon officiated as lecturer. Quito a gratifying instance of "valuable services " being substantially recognised comes from the Criterion Theatre, and pre sents Mr. A. S. Mayne, the business manager, as the enviable object. Mr. Mayne 011 Saturday received a tiny note from Messrs. Thornton and Arnold, begging him to accept tho enclosed in token of such services during the firm's long season here. " Tho enclosed," to the recipient's extreme surprise, proved to be a cheque for the very handsome sum of £50.
