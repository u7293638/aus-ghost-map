¶ The Chain-maker´s Daughter. · ¶ A ROMANCE OF THE BLACK COUNTRY. · ¶ BY HILTON HILL. · ¶ IN TWO CHAPTERS. · ¶ CHAPTER I. · ¶ Bob Hibden, and Dan Helm, his ‘ helper, ’ were members of a night-shift, a few years before mechanical invention had stripped cable-chain making of some of its manual labour. The chain-shop was a long, low, narrow, irregular build- ing ; down each side were ten rows of glowing forges ; here and there one flashed forth meteoric sparks, as clink- ing hammers welded link to link. Dense clouds of smoke floated up and about the black dust-laden rafters, and out through the imperfectly tiled roof, into the cool September air. Stand- ing at one end of the shop, one man could scarcely see another, so foul was it with gaseous vapours. · ¶ Dan Helm, the ‘ helper, ’ was a tall, muscular young fellow of twenty-four, with deep blue eyes, and regular features, framed in a well-proportioned dark- brown beard. As he straightened him- self, one naturally speculated on how well he would look in the habiliments of a Guardsman. As the brawny smiths paused to rest, they deftly scraped the trickling perspiration from their brows and dashed it to the floor. · ¶ ‘ This is the tenth link, bain`t it, Dan ? ’ asked Hibden. · ¶ ‘ Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. This is the twelfth link, Mr. Hibden, ’ replied the ‘ helper, ’ counting up the night´s work. · ¶ ‘ Then, by my empty feeling an` the number o` heats, it mun be near supper- time, lad. ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes ; it`s getting on for it, ’ Dan assented. · ¶ ‘ It`s a middling night´s work, twelve links, ’ observed Hibden reflectively, looking at the glowing coil at his feet. · ¶ ‘ Yes, it is, Mr. Hibden, ’ replied his helper. · ¶ ‘ “ Mister ” Hibden, ’ repeated the older man. ‘ That be two or three times to-night you`n called me “ Mister. ” — Come now, what bin yo` wanting ? There`s somethink, I can see. Is it more wage ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh no — nothing of the kind, ’ re- plied the young fellow, smiling, but not without an evasive downward glance as he picked out the clinkers from the forge. · ¶ ‘ There`s somethink wanted, ’ I know, continued Hibden. ‘ The parson doesna come wi` his sleek perliteness o` calling me “ Mister ” every other word, except when he wants some o` my hard- earned brass for a new organ, or somethink o` t` kind. Them as don`t want anything o` me calls me Hibden — Bob Hibden, or Gaffer, as you`n bin calling me afore to-night. ’ · ¶ Dan did not reply ; he was thought- fully replenishing the fire. He knew he was guilty of unconsciously using the objectionable prefix in a conciliatory sense. He did want something ; but he felt it were better asked for later, when, after a large night´s work, Hibden would be in a more pleasing frame of mind. · ¶ A thick-set, undersized man was Hibden, with brick-red hair and beard, big hairy hands, and long sinewy arms, a short muscular neck, surmounted by a square, close-cropped head, and a grotesque little turn-up nose. He wore a gray flannel sleeveless shirt, open at the breast, revealing a well-developed chest. · ¶ It was said ‘ Bob ’ Hibden in his younger days came from Lancashire, where he had a local reputation as a sagacious dog-fancier and a pugilist of no mean ability. For years his habitual Sunday recreation was a dog or a cock fight or attending a secret fistic encounter among his chain-making pals. · ¶ The gentle, patient woman he had espoused in Warwick, strove to reform,° him, with discouraging results. He was skilful at his trade, and earned a large wage ; but until his child Janet was born, nothing was put by, though he generally had twenty or thirty pounds ready to wager on some local sporting event. · ¶ It was after the birth of her child, and during what seemed a fatal illness, that his wife, by tearful pleading, induced him to buy — for the child´s sake — what was now the first cottage in ‘ Hibden´s Row. ’ For fifteen years the devoted woman struggled on until ‘ No. 8. ’ was built ; then, as Hibden had begun to take a pride in considering himself a man of property, the good wife passed away, worn out in the battle with such a barbarous nature. · ¶ After resting a few minutes, Hibden said : ‘ Janet`s late wi` my supper to- night, bain`t her ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Perhaps a little, ’ replied his helper. · ¶ ‘ Ow ! here her comes, ’ cried Hibden, as the figure of a pale young woman about twenty approached, and became more distinct through the murky air. When the blazing forges lit up her features, she was seen to be a comely girl, with large brown eyes, and darker hair, brushed smoothly over her temples, which gave her a mature look, as if she had felt many of the cares of life, but few of its joys. She wore a quilted print bonnet and a plaid shawl, and carried in her hand a bowl tied up in a red hand- kerchief, which contained her father´s supper. · ¶ ‘ You`re a bit late, Janet, lass, ’ said Hibden as she drew near. · ¶ ‘ Yes, daddie, ’ she replied ; ‘ the fire was a bit contrary to-night. ’ · ¶ She drew from her pocket a spoon, knife, and fork ; and her father eagerly began to dispose of the savoury contents of the bowl. · ¶ Dan had seated himself a little aside, on a pile of chain, and was eating his supper. The girl cast an inquiring glance at him, and as she passed on her way out, he said in a low voice : ‘ I haven`t asked him yet, Janet, but I will before morning. ’ · ¶ They were lovers, and Dan had promised to tell Hibden of his attach- ment for his daughter. · ¶ One Sunday in August, a few weeks after Dan Helm had come to work for Hibden, he was sitting on the stile in his workaday clothes, when Janet passed through the fields on her way to the parish church. · ¶ ‘ Good-morning, ’ she had said cheer- fully. · ¶ ‘ Good-morning, ’ returned Dan, hastily removing his black clay pipe, as unfit for the presence of such lovely company. ‘ Going to church, Miss Hibden ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes, Mr. Helm. Aren`t you going ? ’ · ¶ ‘ I ain`t been since my mother died, ’ replied Dan, with a lump in his throat at the recollection. · ¶ ‘ But wouldn`t you feel better for it ? ’ asked the girl sympathetically. · ¶ ‘ I might, ’ he replied. ‘ But look at my hands, scarred, and burnt, and blistered, and as cracked as the back of a turtle ; they`re out of place in such company. ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh, that would make no difference ; it comes from honest work. I really think you would like it, after a bit. ’ · ¶ Little more was said then ; but Dan´s eyes followed the comely girl with a look of admiration. The next Sunday he was at the stile dressed in his best, waiting for her. · ¶ ‘ I think I`ll go to church, Miss Hibden, ’ he said as she came up. ‘ Can I walk along with you ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes. Why not ? as we`re both going there, ’ she answered with a blush at his hidden meaning. · ¶ ‘ I — I didn`t know whether you`d like to be seen leading a black-sheep. ’ · ¶ ‘ Don`t say ‘ black-sheep ; ’ you`re only a neglected one, I`m sure, Mr. Helm. ’ · ¶ These Sabbath walks to and from church opened a new life for this young couple, and it was not long before tender words took the place of sympathetic counsel. · ¶ As the gray streaks of the morning light were struggling through the begrimed windows of the chain-works, Dan found courage to say : ‘ It`s not a bad night´s work, Gaffer. ’ · ¶ ‘ Now, it`s not, ’ replied Hibden, re- garding the heap of chain with a calculating look. ‘ Best we`en ever done, I think, by t` look. ’ · ¶ ‘ Best in my time, and I`ve been with you now going on three months. ’ · ¶ ‘ Ay, it will be three month come Michlemus. — But what o` that ? ’ — with a keen inquiring glance at his helper. · ¶ ‘ You`ve found me steady, reliable, and not afraid of hard work, Mis — Gaffer ? ’ · ¶ ‘ That I`ll none deny. Well ? ’ · ¶ ‘ When I came here, I told you I was a moulder by trade. Our lads at Sheffield had seen fit to go out on a strike — and we`d been out two months, and I was jolly well sick of it, and cut away to find something to do — I didn`t care what. You gave me a job, at a wage nothing like what I`d been used to — you promised me more, to be sure — but —— ’ · ¶ ‘ I knew — I knew ! ’ cried Hibden. ‘ All that ‘ Mistering ’ last night meant more wage. ’ · ¶ ‘ You`re wrong, Gaffer ; I`ve not asked you for more wage, nor am I going to, for I`m intending to leave you. ’ · ¶ ‘ What ! leave me — leave me ! ’ gasped Hibden. ‘ Then what in blazes is it yo` want wi` o` this ‘ Mistering ? ’ · ¶ ‘ I want, ’ said Dan, looking Hibden resolutely in the eye, ‘ to marry your daughter Janet. ’ · ¶ For a moment the Gaffer was struck dumb ; then, looking the young fellow over with a sinister smile, relieved him- self with an oath. ‘ Hum ! that`s the game, be it ? ’ · ¶ Dan nodded a firm assent. · ¶ Then, as usual when baffled, Hibden fell back on a snarling ironical tone. ‘ Ho ! ho ! Yo` only want my daughter ? An` belike yo` wouldn`t mind me chuck- ing in a cottage, an` a hundred pound to furnish it wi` ? An` a pony an` trap to ride round during th` honeymoon. ’ · ¶ ‘ Come, come — this is nonsense, Hibden, ’ said Dan. ‘ Janet has promised to marry me with your consent. ’ · ¶ ‘ Ho, ho ! her has, has her ! ’ — fiercely ironical. · ¶ ‘ Many a young chap hereabouts would have run away with her first and asked your consent after. I`ve been open and fair with you, I ’ —— · ¶ ‘ Ho ay ; yo` `n been open an` fair ! ’° Open an` fair as a weasel as collars little tender chicks at night w`en th` old watch-dog is dozing. I`m th` old watch- dog ; I`ve been dozing ; but yo` `ll find I`m waken in time. Yo` hav`na got my chick, nor yo` won`t. ’ · ¶ ‘ You refuse me, then ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Ay, I refuse you ’ — doggedly. · ¶ ‘ For what reason ? ’ · ¶ ‘ I doesna need much reason. My helper works for me two months ; he finds out as I`ve a row o` ten houses, that brings me in forth° shillin` a week, an` a handsome thrifty lass. Ho ! he says, this shop will just do for me ; an` so he slyly makes love to my daughter. He`s a tramp when he comes to me ’ —— · ¶ ‘ That`s not true, and you know it ! I only tramped from Birmingham, reduced to that by a loyalty to a long hopeless strike, in which I had no sympathy. ’ Dan was fast losing control of that diplomatic calmness which he had intended to maintain for Janet´s sake. · ¶ ‘ I say yer wer` a tramp. ’ · ¶ ‘ And I say you lie ! ’ flashed back the young fellow, his blue eyes blazing forth the indignation he could no longer subdue. · ¶ ‘ There`s nobbut one thing for that, ’ exclaimed Hibden, deliberately taking off his waistcoat ; ‘ an` that`s a good drubbing for one on us. No man calls me a liar wi`out paying for`t. ’ · ¶ ‘ Keep off, Hibden ! ’ warned Dan, as he parried a blow savagely aimed at his ear. ‘ It don`t become me to fight a man of your age, and I don`t want to, but ’ · ¶ Hibden lunged at him again. The other mates came rushing up to see the bout. Finally, after a brief tussle, Hibden had, for the first time in a long pugnacious career, to see himself humi- liated before his shopmates. Gradually, Hibden became winded, and Dan at length held him pinned against the brick forge. · ¶ ‘ You`m beat, Hibden ! you`m beat ! ’° you`m getting too old for`t now, ’ cried one of his men as Dan released him, gasping for breath. · ¶ ‘ If you ever cross my path again, ’ cried Hibden, in helpless rage, ‘ I`ll do for you. ’ · ¶ ‘ Tut, tut ! ’° scornfully retorted Dan, as he leisurely left the shop with some of the younger men. · ¶ Hibden, raged about for some time, and then trudged off by himself in a turbulent frame of mind. · ¶ It was early morning when he reached home. Janet was sleeping soundly. He went into the scullery, and thoroughly douched himself with cold water, as usual, and then went to bed ; but he could not sleep. · ¶ At eight, he heard his daughter busy with her morning duties ; usually, she brought his substantial breakfast to his bedside ; but on this occasion he was too restless to wait, so dressed, and planted himself before the kitchen fire, lit his pipe, and contemplated the girl in sullen silence. · ¶ Plainer than words, his actions told Janet the worst had happened. As she flitted about laying the table, his eyes followed her, and though avoiding his glance, she was fully conscious of its purport. Never before had he noticed how quietly and methodically she worked — how comely and tidy she looked — how scrupulously clean and white the hearth — how brightly polished the fire- irons, the bits of brass about the kitchener, and the burnished copper kettle given to her mother as a wedding present by Aunt Janet. · ¶ ‘ Her`s a lass to be proud on, ’ Hibden said to himself ; ‘ but her shan`t throw hersel` away on a tramp helper. ’ · ¶ His bull-pup, Bendigo, lay blinking at him in a corner of the room, well out of reach of his master´s hobnailed boot, for he instinctively divined his savage mood. · ¶ Placing the bacon on the table and pouring out his coffee, Janet timidly said : ‘ Breakfast is ready, daddie. ’ She had never called him anything but daddie from the day she could first lisp his name. · ¶ Mechancially° he seated himself before his plate. She helped him as usual to two substantial rashers, cut the bread, sweetened his coffee, and then sat down opposite him. · ¶ He took one mouthful, then pushed back his plate, and exclaimed : ‘ I can`t eat ony breakfast ; tak` it away ! ’ · ¶ ‘ Are you ill, daddie ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yo` know blessed well I`m none ill ’ —— · ¶ ‘ What has happened ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yo` know blessed well what`s hap- pened ; yo` know what underhand games has been goin` on between yon helper o` mine an` yo`. ’ · ¶ ‘ Daddie, daddie ! don`t say that. Don`t say underhand. Oh, don`t ! I`ve never been underhand with you in all my life. ’ · ¶ ‘ Then why didna yo° tell me he wer` follerin` yo` ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Because I did not know that he — that he liked me till last Wednesday night. And I — I feared you ’ —— · ¶ ‘ An` rightly yo` should fear — an` rightly yo` should hang yer head i` shame, for takin` up wi` such a whelp o` a tramp as this. ’ · ¶ ‘ He`s not a tramp ! ’ For the first time this gentle girl´s eyes flashed defiance at her father. · ¶ ‘ What ! Do yo` tak` sides wi` him again me ? — me, as has clothed an` fed yo`, and saved for yo` for over twenty year ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Daddie, daddie ! I`m truly grateful for all you have done for me ; but I must side with him. I love him. ’ · ¶ ‘ Bah ! Love him or not, yo` shan`t wed him. ’ · ¶ ‘ Daddie, I — I love him. — I must ’ —— · ¶ ‘ Must ? ’ he echoed ; and in his rage he used a term of insult towards his daughter. · ¶ ‘ Father, father ! how dare you use such a word to me. ’ All the belligerent blood she had inherited from him was now boiling over with uncontrollable passion. The word ‘ Father ’ struck his ear much as ‘ that fellow ’ would sound to a prelate. He felt the child, the pet, was gone, and an outraged, angry woman asserted herself before him with the dignity of innocence. · ¶ ‘ Don`t talk to me o` darin`, yo` hussy. He`s bewitched yo`° — he`s got yo` in his power. ’° · ¶ ‘ You`re my father ; but if you don`t withdraw that shameful word, I`ll not stay with you another day. ’ · ¶ ‘ I`ll withdraw nowt ! An` yo` will stay ! ’ · ¶ ‘ I won`t ! I`ll go this minute. ’ · ¶ She moved toward the little parlour, to get her hat and jacket. He caught the girl savagely by the arm, and, in his blind fury, was about to strike her, when Bendigo, with a growl and a bound, seized him by the coat sleeve. He spurned the dog from him with a vicious kick, saying : ‘ So yo` `r again me too, are yo`, yo` whelp ! ’ · ¶ Janet escaped into the parlour. Hib- den kicked the dog out into the scullery, and returning, locked the girl in, saying as he did so : ‘ Yo` `ll stay there until yo` come to yer senses, yo` unthankful brat. ’ · ¶ For a long time he sat sullenly smoking his pipe before the kitchen fire, now and again going to the parlour door to listen for a sob or other signs of submission. Finally, he flung open the door. The room was empty. She had escaped by the window, which opened into fields at the back of the house. This, in his rage, he had forgotten. He rushed out, through,° his little garden, into the fields, but could see nothing of her. He returned to the kitchen fire, and began to think, and to marvel at her defiant spirit, which he had never suspected ; and as he grew calmer, regret pierced his dormant conscience at the shameful words he had used. He waited half penitently about the house all day, but she did not return. · ¶ CHAPTER II. · ¶ CONCLUSION. · ¶ Finding herself free, Janet decided to go to her mother´s sister, Aunt Janet, who lived at the church-end of the town. As she approached the church, she was surprised to see the figure of Dan seated on the stile, smoking, in deep meditation. · ¶ Janet´s first impulse was to turn back ; but at that moment Dan looked up, and hastened to meet her. ‘ Janet ! ’ he cried, in tender rapture. · ¶ ‘ Dan ! Oh Dan ! ’ In a moment she was in his arms ; tears and sobs came thick and fast, to the relief of her swelling heart. · ¶ ‘ What`s happened, Janet ? ’ · ¶ ‘ I`ve quarrelled with daddie, ’ she sobbed. · ¶ ‘ About me ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes, yes, Dan.° He abused you shamefully. ’ · ¶ ‘ Never mind, lass ; words don`t harm. ’ · ¶ ‘ And — and — called me names that —— Oh Dan ! I thought he loved me. I`ve been dutiful ; and he`s been so — so steady, and careful and tender to me since mother died — I — I — could never think it —— Oh, such words ! I couldn`t stay with him after them. ’ · ¶ ‘ Then you`ve left him ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes, yes — I couldn`t stay. ’ · ¶ ‘ What are you going to do ? ’ · ¶ ‘ I don`t know ; but I won`t go back. ’ · ¶ ‘ Then come with me to Sheffield. ’ · ¶ ‘ No, no, Dan ; that would look as if we`d run away. ’ · ¶ ‘ But to my Aunt Betsy. She`ll give you a home ; and I`ll soon get a job ; the strike`s ended ; and I`ll have a cot of my own for you before long. ’ · ¶ ‘ Nay. I`ll go to my Aunt Janet ; she`ll tell me what`s best. She has a large family of her own ; but she`s always a kind and motherly word for me. ’ · ¶ ‘ It`s hard to leave you, sweet one ; but I shall come over often — every week- end. ’ · ¶ So, with prolonged caresses, they parted, and Janet hurried on to her aunt´s. · ¶ That large-hearted woman was hold- ing the youngest of six in her lap, and rocking with her foot another in the cradle, while she combed the hair of a wriggling boy of five. ‘ Dear o` me ! what`s happened ? ’ she asked, as Janet seated herself with a face plainly be- traying her distress. · ¶ Her niece quickly told her what had taken place, and of her father´s abusive language. · ¶ ‘ An` you`ve left him ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes, aunt. ’ · ¶ ‘ An` I glory in your pluck. Serves him right. He`s been a bully o` his life. He lorded it over our Jane, until he ground all t` spirit out o` her. But her would have him, spite o` all we`d say ; an` now, poor lass, her`s dead an` buried. If he`d had me, I`d ’ —— · ¶ ‘ Don`t talk of that, Aunt Janet. Tell me what I must do. ’ · ¶ ‘ What yo` must do ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes. Can I stay here ? I fear you have no room to spare. ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh, yo` can stay here, an` welcome, lass. We`n room enough. Yo` can sleep wi` little Jim here. — But stop a bit ; let me think. If yo` stop here, Hibden `ull be coming for yo` ; an` that`ll never do. Our Jim `ud order him out o`t` house ; an` then there`d be a row. An` tho` he`s a bigger mon nor Jim, our Jim `ud never give in while he could raise a arm. He`s a little un, but he`s a rare plucky un, is Jim. ’ · ¶ ‘ Then what can I do aunt ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Go ter° yer Uncle George at Sheffield. Our George has neither chick nor child, an` his wife was allus fond o` yo`. ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes ; I think that is best. ’ · ¶ ‘ Have yo` any brass, Janet ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes, aunt, a little. ’ · ¶ Janet, after listening to her aunt´s directions, and motherly admonitions to have nothing to say to fellow-travellers, man or woman, set out for her Uncle George´s at Sheffield. · ¶ This was Janet´s first railway journey alone ; her nerves were at full tension ; she clung tenaciously to her third-class ticket, and looked eagerly at every station sign, lest she should pass her destination, to the great amusement of more experienced travellers. · ¶ While in a deep reverie, in which Dan figured, she suddenly remembered that Dan´s home was in Sheffield. What if he was on the train ? Then her thoughts drifted off to her father ; and she was picturing his storming at her aunt´s, when the train dashed into a great black, smoky station, and she realised she was in Sheffield. · ¶ A good-natured old porter advised her to take a cab to her uncle´s, as it was fully two miles, and the road confusing. This she did ; and after many windings and turnings — which convinced her she could never have found the house alone — she was put down at the door. She discharged the cabby, and was about to knock at the door, when she found, to her dismay, the house was empty : a ‘ To Let ’° card in the window directed applicants to No. 19. To that number, she went and knocked. · ¶ A cheerful, tidy, old woman, and a wholesome odour of hot muffins, came to the cottage door. · ¶ ‘ Can you tell me where George Her- lock has gone ? ’ asked Janet. · ¶ ‘ George Herlock, lass ! Why, bless you, he`s been gone to America these three months. ’ · ¶ ‘ Uncle George gone ! Oh dear, what must I do ? ’ she cried with a look of consternation. · ¶ ‘ Did you expect to find him, lass ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes, yes. He never wrote ; but — but ’ —— · ¶ ‘ Have you come far ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Yes ; from {near} Birmingham. ’ · ¶ ‘ Then come in and rest a bit, and have a cup o` tea ; you`ll be tired, ’ said the tidy old woman, with that kindly hospitality which is the first impulse of Midland housewives. She saw that the girl was in genuine trouble, and her heart went out to her in sympathy. · ¶ ‘ I`ve known your Uncle George this many a year, ’ continued the good woman, after she had induced Janet to take off her hat. ‘ Your father´s brother, belike ? ’ · ¶ ‘ No ; my mother´s. She was a Herlock. ’ · ¶ ‘ Ay, ay ; I remember he told Dave, my good man. He`s a night watchman, my dear. He`s just getting up. You will have a cup o` tea wi` us — there`s only us two. ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh, it`s very kind of you ; but I ought to go — go — home ; it will be very late. ’ · ¶ ‘ You can stay all night, lass, an` Dave shall see you off in t`morning. ’ · ¶ When her husband came down stairs, the childless mother told him where the girl had come from. · ¶ ‘ Why, ’ said Dave, ‘ that`s just like Geordie ! I told him to write ; but he kept a-putting it off until he forgot it, belike. ’ · ¶ Presently, as Janet was seated before the hot muffins, feeling perfectly secure with this wholesouled Yorkshire couple, there came a knock at the door. · ¶ ‘ Well, who can that be ? ’ asked the wife, going to the cottage door. · ¶ As she opened it, Janet heard her exclaim : ‘ Well, well, well — it`s my lad, ’ and the sound of a smothered hug and kiss. · ¶ Then the tones of a manly voice that sent the blood surging from her heart into her cheeks, as she rose from the table and reeled with giddy delight. · ¶ ‘ Dave, it`s Dan come home, ’ cried the old woman. · ¶ Dan strode into the room, and was reaching out his hand to his uncle, when he caught sight of Janet. In a moment she was locked in his arms, to the astonishment of Uncle Dave and Aunt Betsy. · ¶ ‘ It strikes me you`ve been at that game afore, Dan, ’ said Uncle Dave as Dan released Janet. · ¶ ‘ She`s my sweetheart, uncle. ’ · ¶ ‘ Ow, ow ! You sent her on before, then ? ’ · ¶ ‘ No. I don`t know how she got here. — What train did you come by, Janet ? ’ · ¶ ‘ The train from Dudley Junction. ’ · ¶ ‘ Ah ! that`s it. I came on the North- western, from Birmingham. ’ · ¶ Janet did not return the next morning, or the next month, for the childless Betsy, with the motherly heart, would not hear of it. · ¶ . . . . . · ¶ The morning after Janet´s flight, when Hidben° rose, he was confronted with a desolate home. The fireless grate with the accumulated ashes smearing the generally snowy hearthstone ; the rashers of cold bacon looked ghastly ; the unwashed dishes still littered the table, as they had been left the day before. A sense of his helplessness came over him, for never in the course of his life had this domestic tyrant lifted a hand to help himself. After several trials, and many imprecations at its persistent smoking, he managed to light the kitchen fire. He warmed up the coffee left from the day before, and with some bread and butter made a far from hearty breakfast. Then lighting his pipe, he sat before the fire, contemplating the dismal scene. At noon, he set out for Aunt Janet´s, for he had come to the conclusion that was his daughter´s only place of refuge. · ¶ ‘ Well, ’ said that muscular woman, as Hibden presented himself at the door, ‘ what do yo` want here ? ’ · ¶ ‘ I want Janet. ’° · ¶ ‘ Her`° none here. ’ · ¶ ‘ Her has been, then ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Ay, her has been, ’ said Mrs. Jim tartly. · ¶ ‘ Where is her now ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Her`s none here ’ — with a grim smile. · ¶ ‘ Her`s run away fro` home ; her`s none o` age, an` onybody as harbours her, I`ll ha` up afore magistrates. ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh ! yo` `ll have um up, will yo` Bob Hibden ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Ah, I will. ’ · ¶ ‘ Yo` `ll find um first. ’ · ¶ ‘ I`m none so far off finding um now. Will yo` tell me where her is ? ’ · ¶ ‘ No !° I won`t. There ! you have it flat, Bob Hibden. ’ · ¶ ‘ An` why ? ’° · ¶ ‘ Because yo` `n ill-used her. Yo` `n made a slave o` her, an` yo` `d bully her into her grave, as yo` did her poor mother. ’° · ¶ ‘ I don`t want none o` your slandering tongue — nor I ’ —— · ¶ Her husband came up for his dinner at this juncture. ‘ Now, Bob Hibden, I`ll none ha` you bulling° my wife, ’ said ‘ Bantam Jim, ’ bristling up. · ¶ ‘ Get thee in t` t` house, ’° said his wife ; ‘ this is none o` thy business ; ’ and Jim suddenly found himself pushed into the kitchen with one jerk of his wife´s muscular arm. — ‘ An` as for yo`, Bob Hibden, yo` `ll never know fro` me where her is. ’ Then she banged the door in Hibden´s face, and barred it, to further emphasise her determination. · ¶ Hibden went home fuming with rage. · ¶ The next day, he reluctantly called in old Granny Crip, of No. 6, to tidy up his house and provide his meals. · ¶ He returned to his work with a new helper ; but the loss of his daughter was never out of his mind. · ¶ After Granny´s advent, all the gossips in ‘ Hibden´s Row ’ knew of his misfor- tune. Some pitied him, and some did not ; the general opinion was that in his disgrace he would turn to drink. Some one told him of seeing Dan and Janet together in the fields on the morning of her disappearance, and this convinced him and the gossips that they had eloped. · ¶ Weeks passed, and no tidings came of her. The bull-pup Bendigo whined from room to room, seeking her with piteous cries, which caused his master in his own acute sorrow to lament : ‘ Ay, lad ; we `n both lost a friend, one as we `n never get the like on again. ’ Hibden had cherished his daughter while she was with him much as he had loved his dog ; but now that she was lost to him, he suffered with all the pangs of paternal bereavement, for he considered her lost. He often pictured her wandering about the streets an outcast, for he had no faith in Dan´s honesty of purpose. As month fol- lowed month, and no tidings came of her, his once florid face grew sallow and haggard ; his appetite failed ; and he gave up his job at the chain-works, a physically broken man. Then he moped about the house or the meadows, with Bendigo always at his heels. He shunned the public-house and drink, to the surprise of his neighbours, and gradually there settled upon him a determination to find the man who had desolated his home, and if they met, to destroy him. He carried a heavy oaken stick for the purpose. · ¶ It was reported in the chain-works that Dan had gone to America. At first, Hibden believed this report ; but finally remembering Dan had come from Sheffield, he decided to go there and make inquiries. His first two visits to the great struggling town were fruitless — no one seemed to know of such a man. Still, he kept up his search for many months, until one night he encounted° Uncle Dave on his way to work. After they had exchanged the usual observa- tions of the night, Hibden asked : ‘ Do yo` happen to know a man named Helm, Dan Helm ? ’ · ¶ Uncle Dave was about to answer, ‘ Ay, he`s my nevvie, ’ when something in the haggard visage of the stranger caused him to modify his reply. ‘ Ay, I do, ’ he said. · ¶ ‘ He`s gone to America, they say ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Ay, he has. Did you know him ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Ay. He ran away with my daughter. ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh ! Then you want him, belike ! ’ · ¶ ‘ I want to get this stick on his skull, ’ said Hibden, swinging the oaken stick threateningly. · ¶ ‘ You would kill him ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Ay, I would, if I swung for `t, ’ cried Hibden, his face livid with anger. Then he told Uncle Dave the months of agony he had suffered at the loss of his beloved child. · ¶ The Yorkshireman listened to his tale, deeply pitied him, and finally said : ‘ Happen it`s na as bad as you think. I`ll make some inquiries, an` I`ll write an` let you know when I`ve any news. ’° With this they parted. · ¶ Uncle Dave thought it prudent not to reveal at that time all he knew without consulting his wife. Dan and Janet had been married soon after they joined the old couple ; and later, at the urgent request of a relation, Dan had gone to the States to a good situation. He wrote home that he was prospering, and that he would come and fetch his wife in the August following. · ¶ When Uncle Dave told Aunt Betsy of his meeting with Hibden and the threat, she would not consent to Janet being told of it in her present delicate condition. · ¶ But in July, something occurred which decided Uncle Dave to attempt a little diplomacy of his own. He wrote to Hibden to come over the next Sunday, as he had some news for him. When Sunday came, and Uncle Dave met him at the station, Hibden eagerly asked : ‘ What is the news ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Come to the parish church and you shall see. ’ · ¶ At the church he showed Hibden the register, and read to him the record of the marriage on October 10, 187-, of Janet Hibden, spinster, and Daniel Helm, bachelor. · ¶ When the chain-maker heard this, the muscles of his face twitched con- vulsively, and he cried with a husky voice : ‘ Thank God, it`s none so bad as I thought. ’ · ¶ ‘ I told you it mightn`t be, ’ said Uncle Dave. · ¶ ‘ I can`t tell yo` what a comfort that is to me, for I feel as if I`m none for long i` this world ; an` it`s lifted a load fro` my mind to find as — as — he did the honest thing by her. God bless her ! wherever her is. I`ve made my will, an` left all I have to her an` her childer, if her has ony. ’ · ¶ ‘ I`m fain to hear you`n come to that sensible conclusion, Mr. Hibden. ’ · ¶ ‘ I don`t know how to thank yo`, master, as I`d like ; I`m beholden to yo` — I ’ —— · ¶ ‘ Don`t mention it, Hibden. — But you can do me a good turn to-day, ’ said Uncle Dave as they left the church. · ¶ ‘ Mention it, an` I`ll do it willingly. ’ · ¶ ‘ We`re i` trouble at our house. ’ · ¶ ‘ What`s up ? ’ · ¶ ‘ There`s to be a christening to-day. Rather sudden ; child`s weakly, an` mother main`t live. ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh ! yer child ? ’ · ¶ ‘ No ; it`s a niece o` mine. She`s had a bit o` bad news, an` — an` it brought her down sudden-like. ’ · ¶ ‘ What`s happened ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Her husband`s away from home, an` she`s got word he`s nearly killed in a explosion in t` foundry. Well, it`s a question if she`ll live ; an` she`s anxious to have the child christened afore she dies. Parson`s coming this afternoon. ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh, I see. ’ · ¶ ‘ My missis is to be t`godmother ; an` I`ll be one godfather ’ —— · ¶ ‘ An` yo` want me to be t`tother ? ’ asked Hibden. · ¶ ‘ Ay. You`ve neither chick nor child, an` — an` this little lad will — may soon be without father or mother. I thought it would do yer heart good to do some- thing like this. ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh, it will. I`ll do it willingly. ’ · ¶ When they arrived at Uncle Dave´s, they found the curate waiting. He had been into the back room, where a bed had been placed, to comfort and en- courage the helpless little mother, and now he was seated by the fire-place, while Aunt Betsy was nursing Janet´s child. · ¶ When the two godfathers came in, the parlour door was closed ; but as the curate began the baptismal prayer, Janet softly asked the nurse to open it a little, so that she could hear the curate´s supplication. · ¶ Bob Hibden knelt to his Maker for the first time since the death of his wife ; as he did so, he experienced an indescribable feeling of consolation and contentment. · ¶ Then the minister sprinkled the child, and concluded, said : ‘ David Hibden Helm, I baptise thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. ’ As the curate handed the child back to Aunt Betsy, Hibden grasped Uncle Dave´s arm and exclaimed : ‘ Is yer name Helm ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Ay. And It`s my nevvie´s name. ’ · ¶ ‘ Whose child is this ? ’ · ¶ ‘ Your grandchild. ’ · ¶ ‘ Mine ! An` — an` — is — my lass — my Janet dead ? ’ and great scalding tears trickled down his cheeks. · ¶ Just then, there came from the little backroom a long quivering, wailing cry , which shaped itself into the words : ‘ Daddie, daddie ! oh daddie ! ’ Janet had heard him, and her shattered heart could not suppress the appeal. · ¶ In a moment he had burst into the room and held her in his arms. ‘ Ah, Janet, my lass, my lass ! ’ · ¶ ‘ Oh daddie, daddie ! thank God He`s sent you to me. ’ · ¶ ‘ Amen, lass — amen ; an` He`s saved yo` for me. ’ · ¶ And when, soon after, Aunt Betsy brought in the baby to them, their reconciliation was complete. · ¶ A few days later Uncle Dave received a letter from his brother in America saying Dan´s injuries were not so dangerous as at first reported, and that he was in a fair way to complete re- covery. This cheered the little mother. She began to improve so that, within a month, she was nursing her baby by the fireside at Hibden´s Row. · ¶ In the autumn, Dan returned strong and well. When he presented himself at the cottage door, Hibden met him on the threshold and said : ‘ Come in, lad — come in, an` welcome. There was a blind owd donkey lived here a year ago as refused yo` his daughter ; yo` mun reckon him as dead an` gone, an` forget o`his hard words, an` the trouble he`s caused yo`. Here`s yer wife an` baby well an` hearty ; an` theer`s mi hand ; an` if yo` `ll let bygones be bygones, an` always be kind to Janet — for, God knows, she`s nearly died for the love o` yo` — yo` `ll find no better friend nor Bob Hibden. ’ — Chambers´s Miscellany. ·
