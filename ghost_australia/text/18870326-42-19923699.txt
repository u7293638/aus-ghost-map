Warrego brought yesterday week a handsome brown trotting stallion whiohhas been purchased in New South Wales for Mr. Poole, of Cooktown. This hone, Acorn, is by Ajax, who was by Rysdale'sHambletonian, dam Ada by Statesman (imp.). Acorn was bred by Mr. Miller, of Chatabury, Goulburn, New South Wales, as a long low horse, standing about 16 hands, and showing a good deal of quality. He has a handsome head and neck, good barrel and splendid quarten. He must measure well round the girth, while he has plenty of bone and his legs look of the best. Altogether he is a very taking horse, and should do good service towards improving the breed of horses in the Cooktown district.
