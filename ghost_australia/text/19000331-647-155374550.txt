Correspondence. A Serious Fact. TO THE EDITOB. Sir, — Attention has been called very frequently of late to the serious annual deficiency of the income of our Foreign Missionary Society, and measures have been adopted to reduce the expenditure on the mission field bv cutting down allow ances, and to increase the income in the colonies by appeals and organisation. I wish to call attention to one serious fact which proves to my mind that there is something lacking in our methods. Let it be first understood that I am not criticising onr Mission Board but sympathising sin cerely with that Committee. Our income for Foreign Missions from the Australian colonies for 1S98 was £9275 12s 8d, while the mission districts contributed £4168 93 lid. Notu, the serious fact is that the Board was compelled to spend in the year 1898 for official, deputa tion and printing expenses no less a sum than £2323 4s 2d. All out circuits demand deputations, fresh from the field if possible, hence a large sum of money has to be spent which ought to go towards extension on the field itself. I dp not think for a moment that the Board of Missions is to blame in this matter. Their hands are xorced by the constant cry for deputations, printed in formation, raaps, etc. Our methods of raising money will have to be revolutionized if we are to wipe off this debt and meet the cries for help. Instead of depending upon the visitB of deputations we need more dependence on the influence of the Holy Ghost. If we cannot carry on our work without this sad spectacle of accumulating and overcoming debt, let us withdraw our agents from one or more of our present fields and hand the work God has given us to do to some other branch of the Christian Church. I am, yours, etc., A Missionary from his Youth op.
