A Singapore Snake Story. A Snake for a Bedfellow. How they Killed It. Tho Shcnpao, a vernacular newspaper published in North China, givoseurreucy to tho following snake story A Singapore Chinaman, with an assis tant, kept a grocery store in one' of tho Straits Settlements. Lately, after a Heavy night s rain, the Ulnnaman, hnd- ing tho morning air to bo damp and cold, attempted to pull the hod covering ovor him, but felt it to be unusually weighty. Tugging at it with much force it did not yield, and on taking a look at it to his groat horror ho per ceived a great snake coiled on it at the foot of the quilt. Tho reptile did not stir, and in a loud whisper tho assistant was summoned, aud togethor.thoy made a running nooso with a piece of pliant rattan and safoly slipped it around the snake's ;ncck. Then attaching two stout ropes to tho two ends of tho noose the two began to haul away, tightening tho nooso at every pull. Tho struggle, though unequal, was a severe one. Crockery uteusils, packagos of teas, gingor prosorves, barrels of flour, nnd all othor articles within reach of the snake's tail wero smashed or sent flying about tho room ; but tho snake gave up tho ghost. Tho monster measured 12ft in length and over 2ft in circumference. Tho Chinaman, as far ns his store is concerned, is utterly bankrupt, and the last wo have heard of him wns his in tention to go into tho snako-cfttclnng businoss.
