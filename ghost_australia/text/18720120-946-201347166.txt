Night is on the city ? night in all ; it's : glorious loveliness, shadowing alike ; the rich and poor, the happy arid; the wretched, bringing rest alike' to high and low.' ' ??? ? ; ? ' ' '??' . '?'[ '' / ; 'Night with its countless ' myriads ' of stars and its cold pale moon looking down upon busy, toiling, scheming, bustling London. 1 London, who3e thousand voices are silent now, arid whoso mighty heart of wealth'andlaboris as one liuge grave. No -watchers are abroad save here and there a policeman on his beat-; no step is heard to break the stillness, there is no sound amid the summer silence to tell of misery and wrong. No sound! yes; hark! ringing out tip on the silent air comes the sharp shrill cry of murder! again and again, in a woman's voice, and long shrill shrieks follow which rouse sleepers from their 'beds in startled fear, and make the blooil curdle and the heart leap with «udden and unconquerable terror. The street was a ?quiet one, and rarely risited by policemen or idlers, for it was one of the class termed ' respectable' (too often a sad misnomer), in one of the suburbs of London, far removed from 1 he fashionable world, and mostly occupied by lodging-house keepers, teachers of music and dancing, and manufacturers ?of small goods, who required neither *hops nor large 'warehouses. The house from which the fearful ?sounds proceeded, was one of the most aristocratic in the street, tenanted by a widow, who let the whole of it out in apartments, residing in the kitchen her self, with -a little maid of all work to wait upon the entire household. j It was from the topmost story that ' 'the cries «ame, and soon a crowd of ] ?every sort of people , were congregated : in front of the house ; and as soon as! the door was opened for the admission i of -3ie police, a white figure rushed down ' ?the darkened staircase, and would have Teached the -street but for the arm of the inspector, who stopped its headlong ?course, and with his men gained the in- ; ?side of the house and barred the door to | exclude the prying eyes and busy fingers i of the motly crowd -without. ! So few moments :had elapsed between '? -the first fearful shriek and the entrance of the police that the inmates of the house were hardly awakened, but they ?were soon aroused, and swarmed- in frightened curiosity about the staircase, where a strange and terrible scene pre - *ented itself. Ih the hands of the police officer and jbis mem was e small, -slight girl, ap parently about seventeen years of age, and seemingly unconscious-of all around her. ? '...?'. She wasjdressed in a loose white wrapper, which was stained from top to bottom with large splashes -of blood; her face, which in its classical contour and faultless beauty might have fasci nated all beholders, was disfigured with smears, as if struck with a bloody hand ; her very hair was dabbled— and every step set by her bare foot on the staircase ihad left its traoe. In one of her bands (the left as those ?present remembered afterwards) was tightly clenched a razor, .strong and ?sharp, but dimmed by the same fearful -steias. The spectators looked at each other in wonder— even the police, used as they ?wereta scenes of crime and danger, fihranic and shuddered as they gazed on that fair girlj so young, so ehild- like, ' ?with the evidences of such a terrible \- crime before her. 'Look to her, Brown, and come along,' said the inspector to his men, as he led the way upstairs, carefully avoiding, as did those who. followed, treading on any of the marks made by the feet of the young girl in her hurried .descent feeling they would be needed in evidence. The door of a back room on the second floor stood open, and thither the foot prints ted them. On a bed in one corner lay extended a man of about fifty years of age, with a fearful gash in his throat, from which the blood flowed with frightful rapidity ; and at his head, vainly endeavouring to check its flow, was a young man only partially dressed, and with, that half .bewildered air which betokens one just roused from heavy sleep. The room bore evidence of a violent struggle, the bed especially being en tirely disarranged, and everything about it marked with blood. ' .-,.;? Thin young man looked up as the men entered. . ' Is there a surgeon with you,' said ;he. 'fHe is not dead.' ,One gentleman stepped forward from the group and approached the bed, and, raising the head of. the ghastly figure 'upon it, confirmed the .statement, but added that his remedies would be of no avail, as life was ebbing fast. He, however, with true professional skill and tact, proceeded to uso his best appliances to stop the bleeding and strap up the wound. He succeeded so far that the wounded man opened his eyes and looked around him. ??? ' Do not move or speak,'' said. the doctor, in quiet tones, ' it is your only chance for life.' ..?-:?; He looked at the speaker for a mo ment, and, catching sight'of the young girl, who was murmuring, as to herself, ' Oh, father, father! '' fixed upon, her a look of terrible reproach, and, with a menacing jesture, fell back upon ;,the pillow. ? ?; , '..?-,? ,; ' I can do no more,' said the doctor;' 'some one must watch beside him. It will not be for long. Where is tho landlady?', Mrs; Wilkins was summoned, and with difficulty persuaded to take up her' quarters for the night in a chamber bo full of horrors, but the promiso of a liberal recompense from the officer, and the sight of some gin then and there provided, as she said, to keep her heart up, together with the company of a neighbouring landlady, overcame her scruples, and she consented, though, as she said, 'it was the most hawfulest thing to sit by a man who was going out of the world, nobody knows how. She expected his ghost would haunt her all her life.'. ,.'?'.''?,' She was somewhat comforted by the .society of her bosom friend from next .door, Mrs Thornton, who was engaged, as she termed it ' perfeshunrally, 'and who was anticipating, in truly profes sional style, the performance of. her duties about the dead. ' It is a thousand pities my dear,' said she, addressing her companion, ' thatthepoordear hadn't a been pisined, if he was to die afore his time, instead of being disfigured in that fashion. Why, we can't make a hansome corpse of him nohow, and I have got silver shillings in my pocket which have closed many. a lady and gentleman, too. But, my dear, tell us all about it.' ? ? , . ' 'I aint nothing to tell,' replied the other. ' I was just having a drop afore I went to bed, and we heard a scuffle, and Maxy says, says she, ? There's Sim's (that's the third floor back, you know) 'a beating of his wife again.* ' * That's not Sim's,' says I, and with that Miss de Cresscy screeches out, { Oh father, father!' and then, she screams 'Murder !' and runs down stairs, and then I was took in the 'sterics, and didn't hear nothing more. I wonder what they're doing down stairs?' she. con- tinued. '[Miss de Cressey don't seem to know much .about anything. Let's have another drop of gin, my dear.' Down stairs, in the front parlour, were assembled the whole of the inmates of the house and one or two persons who had slipped in with the police. The inspector was making all sorts of inquiries to try and throw some light upon what seemed shrouded in impene trable mystery. . No one, however, had heard anything until aroused by .those thrilling shrieks except the lodgers on the same floor, a widow lady and her son (the young man found in the room where the crime was committed) who went by the name of Audley. ? ? They could tell but little, they had been roused from sleep by the noise of scuffling in the apartment of the : De Cressey's; had heard the father rush violently, to his bedroom, followed by his daughter; the door was slammed, and after the lapse of about a minute, again flung open, and with fearful screams, Miss de Cressey rushed down stairs. , . They had never heard of any dis agreement between the : father and daughter; considered them to be much attached to one .another; knew that they were poor ; believed that Miss De Ores eey taught music for a living; that they received no visitors ; and this was all — all— and hew little'. ? ? Was there no ono could throw a light upon the dark events of that liight; none to save that fragile girl from being dragged through tho streets as a mur deress. No, it ' seemed not,' and the officer said gently- — 'It is a painful task, but I must ar rest Miss — (he looked about for the name which some one in the room sup plied) — Miss Pauline De CressoyJ on a charge of wilful murder. Watts, call a cab.' .'. 'i ''''?? ' Pardon me,' said the gentle Voice of the widow who had borne such1 ifn portant testimony, 'she cannot ;go' but' like that; she must be dressed.' ' ' I cannot let her out of my sight, madam,'1 said the kind hearted man; ' but I should not like my daughters to go out so. Fetch her some clothes ma'am, and we will go outside , while you dress her.' ? The widow left' the room, ' and while she was gone, a gentleman said to' the inspector — ' ? . . .? ' If any bail can be taken for this poor, young lady^ I will be bound to any amount.1' ! !' There was a peculier expression in his face as he looked at ' the prostrate girl, and the officer noticed it.-'. ',.Are you not aware, sityihat no bail can be accepted in cases of murder?', he said,, bending a searching glance upon the author of so strange a proposal. . ?'.,' ' lam a Frenchman,' was the reply, 'and not long in England, or I should have been better acquainted with your .laws,' and the speaker turned away. Mrs Audley 's entrance with clothing for Pauline stopped' the reply that rose to the lips of the officer, and with a hu manity not common to his class, he re moved his men from the apartment, re maining himself behind a large screen which completely hid^' the door from the interior of the roomi ./ V:^ ;':.' , The hapless girl was soon divesied- of all. traces of the dreadful tragedy in which she had played' so mysterious a part, though she seemed quite uncon scious of the gentle efforts made by her kind friend to rouse her. It was evident from tho manner of the men who conveyed her to the cab that they did not believe her guilty, but they knew that all that must be left to time to prove; and though they did their duty, they' did it gently, and with a quiet mournfulness it was tonching to see. Mrs' Audley pleaded hard to be al lowed to go with ' her, but to no pur pose ; and the cab rolled away, bearing the still insensible Pauline De Cressey —young, lovely, and tenderly nurtured — to pass the night in a felon's cell. 'CHArTEn II. . ? : ? THE 'POLICE OFFICE — THE SECOND ? , AliAlVM— THE BETOHN TO LIFE— - THE TRIAL. '.-?'?,. The surgeon re-ascended the stairs as the cab moved from the doorj and carefully stepping over the hideous traces of the night's tragedy, which still marked every step, sought the room where the crime had been committed, and where the old women crouched in shivering terror over a hastily kindled fire, with their comforting bottle of gin and the kettle to give them courage during their solitary watch. He approached the bed and looked for a while at its deathlike occupant, then placing his hand upon the heart said to himself — ' Ah, I thought so; gone off quietly. He is dead, ' he added aloud to the old women, who started up with loud excla mations of surprise, and many protesta tions of having watched their patient most carefully. Mrs Thornton declar ing that 'the poor dear was a sleeping like any infant no time ago. ' ' No doubt, no doubt, ' the doctor replied, with a slight smile, knowing how careful such watches often are ; and with another look at the body he left the room. As he did so he was met by Mr Audley, who requested him to come and see his mother, who was suffering, from a heart disease, which was seriously ag gravated by the excitement and agita tion she had just endured. The kind hearted man complied, and on seeing the suffering lady, dispatched her son to his surgery for the necessary remedies, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing her greatly relieved. Night was by this time Wearing awayyandthe widow remarking that Mr Simmons must be greatly fatigued,' busied herself in preparing coffee, of which she begged him to partake. Tho refreshment was really accept able to him, and he remained, hoping that the conversation might turn on tho events of the night, and that ho might learn something of tho De Cresseys. He, was not disappointed, for they were, oyidently a favourite theme with Mrs Andley and her son, and though they had only known them a few weeks, they had learned their whole history. The facts, as far as he could. learn, were these — ???:??; ; Hugh de Cressey was a French emi gre, bearing the title of count, till the .Revolution stripped him of it. .: The mother of Pauline died while yet she was an infant, and her father, fled to England with his child, and the wreck of his fortunes.. ? Here he wooed and won a ; young English girl, who only lived to welcome .to the world a little daughter, and; left him once more. a. widower.. ;.: 7 What the young wife passed through in the brief year of her married life, or what she imagined her child might have to endure was a secret in her own heart, but she extracted a solemn promise from her husband that her child if. it lived, should be sent to her mother, who resided in a 6mall country town , on the borders of Wales. ,. ? . Hugh de Cressey, though passion ately attached to his young wife,, would have refused her request, had he not been assured by her physicians that, the only way to save her life was to comply with her request. .. ; No human skill could save her, and when her mother returned home, after consigning her darling child to a prema ture grave, she carried with her all that was left of her cherished treasure— the little Blanche. . Years rolled on, and Pauline grew up into as lovely a child as ever painter drew, or poet sung, and was the joy of . her father's;heart, and tho life andspirit of his home. „ ,:, , - Small of, her age, yefc exquisitely .pro portioned, there was in her. every move ment a witching grace that: cannot be described.' She had the rare perfection of a small hand and matchless foot, which marks noble blood ; and her face was of match less beauty. She had flashing black eyes, and luxuriant raven hair, which rolled in clusters of curls to her waist. Her little. sister was rarely seen at home, for her mother's relations fulfilled . their trust to the very letter, and only permitted very brief and rare visits. These, howevei', were sufficient to show that the child bid fair to be as great a beauty as her sister, though totally un like her. The little Blanche was as fair as Paul ine was dark — her golden hair and blue eyes plainly showing her Saxon origin ; and in those points, and in gentleness of disposition, she resembled her mother. Some two years before the opening of this story, and when Pauline and Blanche were severally fifteen and ten years old, a change, imperceptible at first, but not less surely felt, came over the home of the De Cresseys. Pauline noticed that her father's brow was clouded by day and that he was often absent by night— then by degrees that their usual visitors dropped off, and their places in the parties which Hugh De Cressey was fond of giving were supplied by men only — men whose flashy appearance and slang conversa tion plainly showed that' they belonged toaclass who subsist by whatis commonly termed ' living by their wits.' ' ' First one article of luxury was dis pensed with, then another ; their neces saries followed, till the crash came— the furniture was seized for rent, and the father and daughter were turned out of their comfortable home to seek a living as they could. Pauline, though helpless as most people are who are reared in affluence, had a strong will and more energy than often' falls to the lot of her class. She plainly saw that the chief if not the whole maintenance of their little household must come from her, and she set herself resolutely to think how best to earn their daily bread. ? She had received . but a superficial education, but she possessed more than ordinary talent for music and singing, , and she resolved to try to get pupils. She succeeded rather poorly at first ; but her great talent and lady-like bearing procured her by. degrees, the entree into many families, and at the time of. he ncquaintanco with the Audleys sbe we doing well. They had been in tho same &M35;& with them about three months,, and were much attached to Pauline, though titey both owned to a dislike to the fatSaer, which they could neither understand bet explain. They said the old man was moody saasB irritable ; not often visible till late am the afternoon, and always ? out . in U*& evening; never returning before ibmI night, and sometimes not till . memiajig: — his daughter being always on ibe watch, to let hiin in. , 'I wonder you have never fallen la love with this paragon,' said *Mr Sim mons with a smile to Henry &aiil;$jI when his mother had finished her narra tive. , .'? A good , daughter gencrsJIjr makes a good wife, you know.' ; '? So they say,' replied the yccngr man;, 'and yet I would not ioarry Pauline de Cressey were she ever so willing. ; There - is an indeseriba&Ie; something about her which will nufe her the most loveable or the most hate ful of her sex. I should . not like t» trust my happiness to her keeping.' He left the room as he. spoke, azs2 ' his mother looking after him, said-— , ' She is a dear girl, and I wish he could take a fancy to her. I ofieo think she is fond of my, son by. the way she speaks . of him ; though she , -nroaStB be too proud to own a love unless bJjb was sure it was returned.' . ? 'Poor girl, I am afraid she w3Q! never own to any love in this woriiV replied Mr Simmons, 'unless sozqjj thing unforeseen occurs. The circum stantial evidence is so strong ;, hut, ]E will go and inquire at the station how she is, and bring yon word, and uojp you must go to bed and take a loosj rest — there is nothing to hope or, tratob for in yonder room now.' . And bidding Mrs Audley.good moana ihg, the kind doctor took his hat sz*3 loft the .house. .. ? , ?
