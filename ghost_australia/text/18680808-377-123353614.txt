SKIPPING. Tihers has been quite a revivalill the shipping trade of the colony during the past month, especially in arrivals, three of which have been from lEngland, viz. \--the Englet, with passengers and cargo, thle Abbots ford, with cargo only, and thle Young Australin, with a large number of passengers, and a cargo of general merchandise. Tile steamer trallic from the Southern colouies has been greatly increased by the rush to our gold-lields, boata hasing been laid on especially for thle conveyance of passengers. Other intercoloiall arrivals hIave been above tile average, and may be summarisod as follows :--Sir schloouners from Sydney and other parts of Ncw South Wales with farm pro duce and general stores, four from Melbourne with somewhlat similar cargoes, two from Adelaide with breadstulrs, and one from thle South Sea Islands withl native passengers and produce. There has been only one departure for England, the Buyswater, withll passengers a:ld a cargo of cotton and station and other produce. Thile othlerdcparturel Ihave been confined to the ordinary steamer trade, and a few coasters in ballast for various ports. Thie weather on thle coast has been very rough occa sionally, but the casualties hare fortunately been very rare. Tie total loss of the slchooner Willing Lass on Mast-head Reef ou the 9th ultimo, wiheu on her passage from Rockhampton to Sydney, in ballast, is thle only accident of note which has occurred during thse monthl. The crew were saved. Further particulars are to hand respecting tlhe crew of tihe brig Rebecca. AtRIVALS FROM EINGLAsD. July 13.-Esglet, barque, 392 tons, Captain Wtn. sughes, from London.
