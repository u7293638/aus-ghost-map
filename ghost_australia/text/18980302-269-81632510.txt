The Mystery of Sea cliff Towers. (ALL EIGHTS RESERVED.) BY J. D. HENNESSEY. Author of "The {Dfe-HorioraUe,** "Wyamim," "An Australian Bush Track," "Gunnery of Church "Con sett," etc,. & «: GHAPTEB XX. .w: Detective Seymours Story. It "Waft Hot Until Melbourne was reached, however, and Seth Rosedale safely lodged in the gaol, that the detective's story was told. Seth Rose dale had exhibited an entirely differ ent demeanour after the appearance of Seymour. He evidently regretted the admission he had made to Bruce, and in reply to any questions put to him toy the detectives expressed him self as personally entirely ignorant of anything connected with the events which bad transpired at the Towers. "We shall have to secure Mrs. Dal bert," said Seymour. "Yes," replied Bruce, " her evidence seems absolutely necessary to secure a conviction against Rosedale; he is a <clever scoundrel that; I never knew the trail of a crime to <be more artful ly covered over. Let us hear, how ever, off your adventure down below ?' "It was my bull's-eye lantern that saved me down there," said Seymour. "How came Dr. Strong to escape *i" asked Bruce. " I don't .know, unless by a miracle, or the timely interposition of a friend ly hand. But it will be best for me to begin at the 'beginning, and then we can form our plans for future ac tion." "I must have been asleep, when I descended into the underground room,' continued Seymour. "I had been watching for something like six hours, and was afraid that I might doze off, or that the lift might be so quietly worked that in the dark I might be unaware of it; so I lay down uuon the lift with my head on a 'cushion, just In the (position in which they found the doctor." "I ata inclined1 to think that the cushion was tempered with in some way, either drugged, or made of hops, or something put -upon it to induce sleep, for I can account for it in no other way." " Oh I you were clean -done up, and when you put your head on the pil low what <was more natural than that you should go- to sleep." said Bruce. "Well, we won't discuss1 that," re plied Seymour, "although I am not eure myself that I ever slept, for that lift has been constructed by a me chanical genius, and works perfectly smoothly, and wdthout iioise of any kind. I may have been lying there for an hour or two When I started to consciousness. I felt. that there was a change in the \ atmosphere, mid was conscious of a slight draught which I had not noticed in the room before. .My lantern was covered, but was still alight, so I turned it up and uncovered it. You may guess that I got a start." " I was still lying upon the fire place, but Instead of being in the bed zoom I could see a kind of shaft or Dffgjl above aajJ around there a large underground cave or cham ber. I sat up at once and drew my ^revolver, for within a yard of me sat a stout man fastened in a chair, seem Ingly asleep. I looked at him again. The face was partly -turned away from me; but my blood almost ran cold. It was the corpse or ghost pf Raymond Balia&tyne.; X " I jumped up and stepped cautio^^ ly on to the floor, and -with -my bull's eye took a good look at the appari tion, to be quite sure that my senses .were not deceiving me ; then I threw the light cautiously into other parts of the place ; but a moment afteraw* I got another shock, iffor tmraiiag <rtcniud I ifound tiha't «tlhe lift, reli-eved <c*f my .weight, was steadily ascending to its foumer position, It to fact -was too higjh up for me -then 'to catfcrfh !hold of it, and a minute afterwards had pass ed up the well 'to its plaice in the bed room. 'For a feiw minutes I felt myself regularly trapped ; bait I was imtost ap preihenisive as to_who inigfot »be iwith me in ifSbie vault., in .addition to the corpse of cM< Mr Ballamityme.

TSiis was a great thing for Bruce to say, for he rarely expressed ap proval of anything which his col league did ; ibut he was evidently fav ourably impressed and interested. Seymour chuckled to -himself 'There * is notMng succeeds like success,' he tihought as he looked across to iiis senior. 'I went over and had a good look at the coryse of the late proprietor of the Towers, and when you see it you will think with me that it is a ghastly spectacle. The body has evidently been preserved in some way, for ft has ft mummy-like abearance, trat ^ Whip it has been done is a mystery which I can suggest no explanation 'Did you exa-inine *he *body closed/ asked Bruce. .

' 'Well, man, whait was it?' said Bruce, at last, somewhat' impatiently.. TU tell you in a minute,' said Sey Ui-owr, evidently enjoying Ms senior's exesited state of mind.
