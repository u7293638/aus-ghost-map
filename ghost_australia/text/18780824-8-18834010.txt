POETRY. THE FORSAKEN GARDEN. {Stanzas from Swinburne's JTew Volume) ïnaooignof the olid between lowland and highland, S» At the Bca-ilown'a edee between wind ward and lee, Walled round with roete« na an inland Island, The ghost ora garden fronts the sea. AjrirdJe ot brushwood and tborn incloses The steep square slope ol the bloesomlees bed "Where the weeds that grow green from the grave -of 41« roses Now Ile dead. Hot a flower to be pressed of the Toot that falls cot ; '. Aa the heart of a dead man the seed riots are -dry.; J'rom the thicket of thoras whence tua nightingale calls not, ;? «Could she rall, there were never a rose to reply. Over the meadows that blossom and wither Binga but a note of the seabird'» song; Only the sun and the rain come hithgr All year long. The sun burns sere and the ruin diBhevclä One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless bi ettth. Only tbe wind here hovers and revels In a round where Hie seems ns barren as death; Sere there was laughing of old, there was weeping, Haply, of lovers none ever will know, "Whoso eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping Yea« ago. All are at one now, roses and lover«, Kot known of the cliffs and the (leída and the sea, Kot a breath of the time that has been hovers In the air now roft with a summer to be. Kot a breath shall there sweeten tho seasons hereafter Of the flowers or tho lovers that laugh now or weep, ' When as they that are freo now ot weeping and laugmer We shall sleep. Till the slow sea rise and the Bhecr elia crumble. Till the terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink. Till the strength of the waves of Hie high tides humble The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink. Here now in lils triumph where all tlilrrgs fa'ter. Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread. As a god Bell-slain on his own strange altar, Death lies dead.
