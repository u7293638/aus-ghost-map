The individuals involved may be counted by hundreds-their crimes' ana offences^ W thousands; and the first arrests tookptojf as far hack as 1860.

On saying this, the ex fining magistrate threw a rope round Bai lor's neck, and ordered him to be taken back to prison. At midnight John Bajdor, who had slept soundly, notwithstanding his 59 crimes, jumped up affrighted, and rushed towards the door of his prison, crying for help. This was the moment the examining magistrate' Lad anxiously awaited; he made his way into the cell, when Bajdor confessed not only to having murdered Bodri and his son, but also to having committed a number of other. heinous crimes. In.consequence of these .disclosures the two bodies of his victims, with the ropes still round their necks, were discovered. Acting on Bajdor's advice, a number of other prisonera have made nee confession of the crimes they had com mitted : all the malefactors arrested, it must not be forgotten, are kept in the utmost ignorance as to the. charges which weigh against them. On their first examination they were not questioned as to the perpetra tion of such or such a crime; they were simply asked to give an account of any offence of which they might acknowledge themselves guilt)-. By this means a number of crimes hare been brought to light hitherto totally un inspected. An idea of how desirable a.place .Szegedin must have been to live in may be foimed from the following enumeration of the cases which are now being tried before a specially appointed court. When the Royal commissioner first arrived at Szegedin there were 1,506 criminal charges to be heard; a little later 500 more charges were made; and when the Royal commission had terminated its duties 950 fresh cases were brought to light, making in all nearly 3,000 crimes of the gravest character. Of this total. 1,000 judgments have already been given, and Marly all these judgments have been con finned on appeal. The crimes and offences discovered by the Royal commission amount to 8,000. The principal charges are those of Mrder, jobbery, pillage, incendiarism, &c.;, wcases of robbery alone exceeding 4,000.
