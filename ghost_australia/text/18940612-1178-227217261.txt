EDUOA.TINGTHE VOTEES Sir Charles Dilke has lately proposed some exceedingly advanced ideas regarding the franchise, which, like most of that States man's utterances, cannot bo passed idlv bv. The most important is a proposal to grant the franchise only to those who can demon strate their fitness to bo entrusted with eo great an appanage of free citizenship. What inoaiie Sir Charles proposes to adopt for satisfactorily ascertaining such fitness, or the contrary, aro not as yet quite' clear ; but perhaps he may contemplate sorno form of competitive examination, with the granting of certificates, and so forth. Then we might expect to sec the establishment of a staff of State lecturers on political economy, whose addresses would be highly interesting, in structive, and even amusing, if they were . to treat of certain incidents of past Australian politics, such for instance as the Kiama Ghost episode. But there is a good deal in Sir C. Dilkc's suggestion, after all, for thero can be no doubt that much of our bungled and delayed legislation is directly attributable to want of general knowledge and political iniclligouco on tho part of electors ; but tho difficulty is how to devise a ready and easily applicable method of oducation. The Leger Proprietary edu cate the public up to the use of good tobacco by offering £100 iu 12 cash prizes, of from £25 to £1 each, for the 12 largest collections of tags taken from cakes of Leger Tobacco, and forwarded to their chief agent, Mick Simmons, oi the Haymarltot, on or before June 16, and they intend continuing their instruction by following up this hand some offer with another sum of £100, to be divided into 12 prizes, and competed for under novel and. attractive conditions; but this kind of enterprise could hardly bo adopted for State educational purposes.
