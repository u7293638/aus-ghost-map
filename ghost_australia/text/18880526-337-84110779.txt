Maccabe as a Poet* I Frederic Maccabe is a great musician, he com poses most of the songs he> sings and is also the author of many a pretty set of verses. I give one specimen, here:â€” The New Year. We mark the milestones on a lonely way, And pause to note what in the road appears That we have past. So, in the flight of years, As we look backward on our lives to-day, What painful and what pleasant memories flow From out the cloudlarid of the long ago. The bygone, like a sky, seems overcast With all the shadows of our. wasted hours. The ghosts of our unconsummated powers Reproach us from the irrevocable past. High hopes and great intents will fade away, As this old year into the past dissolves. The New year comes! oh, brothers! let us pray For strength of mind to keep our good resolveB. F. Maccabe.
