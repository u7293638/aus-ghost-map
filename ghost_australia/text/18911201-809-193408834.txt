A., one of the professors at the Holy Ghost College, who died from heart disease on Satur- day morning, took place to-day, and was very largely attended. Tho remains having been removed from the college to St. Patrick's Cathedral, a requiem mass was celebrated at 10.30, Father Croagh and three other priests officiating. Dr. Moore, Bishop of Ballarat, occupied the throne, and around the high altar stood 20 clergymen, including Dr. Graber and other priests from the archdiocese of Mel- bourne; several of the professors in the Holy Ghost College, and representatives from the Redemptorist Monastery. The Office was recited by the whole of the clergymen in attendance. Bishop Moore having given the last absolution, the remains were taken from the catafalque and conveyed to the new cemetery, the cathedral bell tolling as the cortege passed through the streets of the city. The bishop, in full canonicals, read the service at the grave, and he was assisted by Dean Hoyne, vicar-general, and Dr. Delaney, private secretary.
