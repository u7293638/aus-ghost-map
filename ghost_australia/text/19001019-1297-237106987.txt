UNIVERSITY AMATEUR DRAMATIC SOCIETY. Tho University amateur players may bo con gratulated upon their ambition to present an Ibsen drama; and upon the reasonable success which attended It. "The Enemy of tho Peonle" Is not a play for tho average theatre-goer, who would mise from it tbo strong love interest, which must, ultimately prosper, and the picturesque or strenuous criminality, which never survives the last act. Hero villainy, such as it Is, wins, and the honest, hot-hea'ded reformer fares as he very often does In real life. There is noiio.of the obscurity of intention about it all that has allured and mystified readers of Ibsen's later work; it was written whiio tho author still valued per spicuity, and conveys as plaiu a message as "Pillars of Society" or "Ghosts." Eminently a healthy deliverance, it is good to read, but for lack of the usual dramatic interest will hardly ever succeed on tho stage. But a good audience oviuced satisfaction last night at what was at least an intelligent reading of the play. Mr. Norman Gough. appeared somewhat too juvenile as Dr. Stockmann, and luurdly showed a natural intensity of feeling In his speech to the meeting, which was distinctly an angry one. Miss Ruth Bowmalcer and Miss M. Fry filled the parts of Mrs. Stockman and Petra, the enthusiasm of the latter being well pourtrayed. The most striking personation — too pronounced in its Uriah Heap suggestiveness, perhaps — was that of Aslaksen, ; by Mr. -W. J. Curtis, while Mr. J. A. Browne very efficiently filled the rolo of Hoostad. Mr. Charle6 Arnold's English Comedy Company concluded a successful season at the Palaco Theatre last ovenlng. Thoy left for Launceston early this morning by tho steamer Wakatipu. Tho comedy, "War to tho Knife" and "Turn Him Out" — a farce — were performed by the Glebe Amateur Dramatic Club at the Record Roigu- hall, Glebe, on Wednesday evening, in aid of the Indian Famine Fuud.
