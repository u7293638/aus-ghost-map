THE colony of Vietoria commemorates to day the national acceptance of the principle of dnving the day equally between work, recreation, and repose Th it ancient Butish monaieli, King Alfiecl, a thousand yeais ago, both piactised and pt cached the eight houis doefcune Its application to laboieis piobably never occuiicd to the stiudy Saxon Ling, foi in his day, and foi many long centimes aftet it, the liboiei Mas a slue in ever} thing but the name Civ 1117 ition vv is a long time discoveung the lights, and jet lougei in recognising the dignity of liboi, and perhaps neithei the one 1101 the othei would be admitted today, only that the voice of the wotkusgiew too povveiful to be ignoied At 1 ist, howevei, as Di Jiffries put it to an audience in Sjdney the other daj', “the lights of laboi and the duties of wealth areas cleaily established as the lights of wealth and the duties of laboi ’ Seeing how insipid and unset able a thing is life w ithout occupation, the wonder is that the wotld went on so long legal ding laboi as in some way an accuised thing In the old countnes philanthropists have long been earnestly and success fully w 01 king to secuie to laboi its natuial and equitable lights Butish judicial piocess claims to be entirely irapaitial as between the nch and the pooi Laws have been flamed to pio tect the emplojed against tyianny on the put of the employ ei Both on land and sea the social lefoimer has been taking notes vv ith a v lew of abat ing abuses and exchanging intelligent co opeiation foi stolid setfdom and on the whole veiy much has been done in this w ay But the piocess of ennobling manual laboi found more congenial sunoundings in our joung free colonies than wcie possible in the associations and tiaditions of the Butish Islands Cow per said of slaves, “They touch om countiy and their shackles fall,” and vv e may say of those vv ho landed as nee adventuieis in the Sunny South, that they dropped the shackles of false social distinctions, and w lule stuidilj T maintaining the lights of laboi, they developed its dignity also Something is due, of couise, to the [ vastly improved mechanical appliances | which leheve the aitizan from ineie monotonous diudgeiy and ineiease manifold tne lesults of Ins personal laboi The inventor is in no small degree also a social lefounei, and to him attaches the credit of smooth ing the way for shorter houis, and making then adoption easy For the custom of requiring a day’s woik to contain 10 01 12 houis outlived any excuse for such a requnement, and was long persisted in, not because it was necessaiy 01 piudent, but be cause it was habitual And, like many othei evil things, this custom dies liaid Even in this fiee colony the ghost of the same logic of unlimited houis of laboi, made its appearance and had to be laid The Austiahan colonist, while admitting and exempli fying the dignity and the excellence of manual laboi, at the same time saw cleaily enough that woik becomes an accuised thing when it is allowed to banish the light, and sometimes the living from the overtaxed vvoiker It was this feeling which lay at the bottom of the whole eight houis movement, and not, as some slanderers have said, a mere lazy dis inclination to woik for its own sake The histoiy of the eight hours campaign need not be repeated here "We all know that it might be said to have 01 igi nated in at the one time reviled trades’ unions, how first one trade and then another declaied foi the principle, how the miners were from first to last loyal adheients to it, and how when the eight hours system had become an institution, the Legislature calmly stepped in and confirmed that which it could neither alter nor abrogate The 1 dignity of labor was never better shown than in thjs eight hours agitation Theie aveie no inflammatory appeals to the w oiking man, and no whining to the lawmakeis of the colony The ■various tiades, seeing that it was their light, quietly but fiimly demanded that they should be put in possession of it, and the thing was done The associated tiades unions of Ballaiat and district foira a body of which any community might well be pioud They will shortly pioceed to lay the founda tion stone of a central hall, which will foim an impoitint addition to the in stitutions of om City and Town It is small wonder that the annual pioces sion glows inoie imposing and elaborate year by }ear It reflects the progress of a movement which is likewise glow ing in the sympathy and respect of all who wish well to the colony.
