BRANCHES FROM THE MAIL ROUTES. LAND OF THE CROSS AND CURE. BY J. H. To the double title of Cross and Curse thus given to the land of Palestine I might have added the Crescent that so little in it, and is as the outcome of the Curse To travel in this ghostly country the dragoman provides in a way that savours both of bar borous and of Puritan times Tents, a can teen, mules and musketeers have to be taken as also firearms that are we on during the day a ride, and hung up in the tents by night The other Puritan resemblance, beyond the boot, saddle, and pistol, is the Bible, which is carried as the guide book to this land -a land that is holy in name, thought, and theory only In other aspects it is now the shortest country, and BO provocative of additional curses as to account enough for its wretched condition Leaving Alexandria, in the early morning Joppa should, all things favourable, be reached on the day after, if the steamer did not stay a wearisome day at Port Said, so protracting the landing to the third morning It is almost an insult to a Holy Land pilgrim to detain him a day at such an unholy place as that port. Anyone who has been reading,, up for the Holy Land out of its one and only proper guide book feels in Port Said something as unhappy as Christian and Faithful must have felt in Vanity Fair The sight of Joppa from its seaward side is very picturesque indeed The stone houses stand close together, and tower up one above another on the side of a cliff or hill, in a castellated way that has an impressive effect when linked to the thought that one is looking at the second oldest city in the world The landing is difficult. The half sunken rocks form a sort of breakwater, and there is but one passage between them In rough weather it is not to be attempted Through that way I have, however, to go in a passenger boat, and have a rough time of it over the bar. The water dashing over the side disturbs my thoughts of Jonah, who passed through the very passage on his famous whaling adventure They call the town Jaffa and Yatla now, but it is Joppa to everybody who thinks of its history, call it what they may At Cairo I had agreed with three genial Americans who were bound to this Palestine port, and then to go up country to Jerusalem, Jericho, and the Jordan, and thence across to Damascus and Baalbek, and so away over the hills of Lebanon, down to Beyrout, there to take ship again Such a journey promised a sight of most of the wonders that Syria has to show I begged to be added to the party, and so economise expense, and obtain company in a journey Vi here such are essential, and that for many reasons Palestine, I found, by the way, was that half of Syria that is nearest to Egypt-the southern half-" from Dan to Beersheba A dragoman had been engaged, who was to supply tents and mules and a canteen and be guide and providore for thirty seven day a certain, and longer if necessary He had been recommended by our consul at Cairo, and was but just returned from a Nile trip in a calabash, with a party of English gentry, whom he had been for three months piloting to the second cataract and back We interviewed him finding him to be a very desirable guide and learnt 1st That the land of Syn that no hotels in its towns and villages 2nd That it had no roads 3rd That it was impossible to take wheeled vehicles through it HE that the modes of conveyance were camels mules and horses 3th That miles were not mentioned there, but that distances were measured by hours and minutes 6th that it was best to travel on horseback 7th That where not safe to travel unguarded, a Bedouin sheik would be engaged belonging to the district and the tribe through which we had to pass Sth Tint every traveller must carry conspicuous aide anna as otherwise backsheesh would be no one times demanded and enforced instead of merely solicited 6th That we should want green lined umbrellas and green spectacles much of the journey being over barren rocks and sandy country til it reflected the noon day glare of the hot sun 10th That we must tale but a small bag of luggage each All this did not look very encourage, but then no good thing was ever got without trouble and difficulty The good things to be got out of the proposed trip were that henceforth the lands of the Bible would be familiar to us as our own village and its surroundings that we should see the city of the Great King -Jerusalem itself-and journey onwards through places whose names and characteristics were through the ear and by the minds eye more faint larised to us than those of our brothers and sisters, should see the oldest city of this world, the ever green Damascus, and the ruined Baalbek and so pass downwards over Lebanon to the sea gate of Beyrout and have thus seen Syria That was something worth taking trouble about, but that was as nothing to the stupendous other attractions that Pale tine presented We should face the holy places the shrines to which countless thousands of pilgrims had journeyed and worshipped Amongst such were the manger at Bethlehem, the village of Nazareth, the baptismal Jordan, the Mount of Olives, the Garden of Gethsemane, house of the Last Supper the Via Dolorosa, Calvary, and the Holy Sepulchre that was worth trouble It seemed almost a pity that anything should be accounted trouble in connexion with such sights as these and the thoughts they engendered Having agreed on the journey the next step was to agree on our agreement That was now put into writing, helped by the draft form of such a contract borrowed from the consul As this agreement with a Syrian dragoman for a Holy Land journey may be of interest and its information useful, I gue ltB terms -

J C KOBINIOV, VC The list of the places to be I visited which includes Scriptural names from Genesis to Revelations, was kindly supplied by an American staying at Shepherds, who had lately returned from that journey, on which he wished us a good deliv France Our dragoman whom we were to know by his first name of Hassan, Wished. the choice of the route to be an open part of the contract As that was not readily agreed to the following addition had to be made to the articles " The route aboY e indicated is only to be varied on the written consent of all parties hereto As all necessaries for the whole journey will have at once to be provided, the cost of it is to be paid as before mentioned, whether done as intended or varied by consent, or abandoned at any part of it, by all or any of the parties hereto of the first part Any of such parties desiring to retire at any stage, or incapacitated by illness or otherwise from proceeding shall, in that case, be bound to pay up the balance in full of his proportion of contribution, as if he had gone through with the intended journey There was great need on Hassan's part of that proviso, as was afterwards discovered It did not appear so likely at Cairo as it did nearly daily afterwards, how necessary it was to hold people to the agreements into which they rush That truth as to all contracts was especially true in ours, in which we had agreed to something in fancy that proved very different in fact Our thoughts were on a pleasure excursion, and on travelling as we had been travelling, or something like it We had, however, really undertaken a task of arduous toil, that lengthened each day most intolerable) Vi did not know that Holy Land travelling was hard work and purgatorial punishment The agreement however, looked like business YY hen I signed it before the vice consul, and paid my £23 proportion of deposit, I felt quite in for better or worse, and much as if I had got married and was going on a honeymoon months tour with a wife and all her relations One thing entirely dashed one s spirits Iso newspapers could now be seen for full five weeks I had seen the Ilonf Years and Cial and Mail throughout India, and even found copies in Egypt, but to Syria such things came not The dragoman looked aghast when we asked about news papers in Syria AA e might as well have asked about railwayS So for thirty seven and perhaps more days we were to be almost cut off from the world ' An) post offices ' "Only Turn iah ones that are not connected with the En 1131 post You leave letters with the consuls to be sent on by them when occasion offers and never put them in the Turkish post offices ' A pretty state of things ' We might as well have gone to prison for thirty seven days YY hat a number of events happen in that time Could we ever possibly) pull up those lost 1 ages of history by after reading ' However it was done, settled and signed, and we four crossed the sea, and were at Joppa, in Palestine Our dragoman had got there a day before us, and now escorted us from the landing through the old town, and up and down its seven feet wide streets to where four vv white tents stood in a green enclosure hedged round with casing " Why this is a graveyard, we said 1 1 as a grey eye and of the Greek church , we shall encamp in many graveyards 111 our journey-good places they are, too, being always chosen for best position I had not thought of sleeping in a grave yard whilst alive, and it seemed a sort of desecration, until one reflected that the whole of the land must necessarily be but a large cemetery I sat down therefore, on a tomb stone, and took stock of the situation Twenty four years had gone by like to a dream since I had day felt in a tent at I r) ers Creek Diggings, in Australia Thatwa3inl8'J2 It lasted five months then, and I thought thereafter that I had done with tent life for ever It came then after the finish of ones Voyage to Australia, and was occurring here now at the middle of a journey to England to which, as an Australian absentee, I was returning after that life long time These tents here seemed so familiar a sight to one's Austral eyes that I UIY voluntarily looked about for the digger spick, shovel, frying pan, and pannikin Ona calculation of the sort of life I was going into I had also gone back to something like the divers dress-a blouse, belt, and riding trousers of no fine quality Breakfast, how ever undeceived one. There was nothing of diggings character about that No ' post and rail tea damper bread, or greasy frying pan chops It was a better breakfast than any provided by the P. and O. steamers or at the Egyptian hotels The dinner was ditto Antoine, our French cook, was, it was clear, to be the so face of our journey , so we proceeded to his tent and saw the cheery little paid pated man, and made great friends with him as if we had been London policemen and his son had been female Our turnout, or caravan, comprised fifteen animals horses mules and donkeys The attendants muleteers cook and other helps made nine in number It all looked a decent little village when the tents were up, and things spread about for the evening The worst thing was that we were so short of language, Hassan, our dragoman, was the only one of the nine with whom we could that AA c go out of camp and into the town and look and loaf about Joppa, from which the start was not to be made until next morning The men we see about wear white and brown striped I ponchos drawers that reach to the knee, and nothing thereafter until the red slippers are reached al way sworn down at heel The women wear a yashmak, or face covering, of different shape and material to the Egyptians Theirs is of one colour, and leave the eyes exposed It is here a cotton print thing, and quite COY era the eyes The w wearer can see through it no doubt, but to me it looks as completely blind folding I in Yoluntanl) get out of the wearer's way, as I do elsewhere out of that of a blind man and his dog in the market place are troops of camels and mules standing about The owners are in the coffee sheds all around, seated cross legged Araba, Turks, Egyptians, and Syrians -a Yet) eastern looking scene, reminding one of a point out of on old Bible The coffee 13 'back black stuff, drank without milk, and not palatable to us The oranges of Joppa are Y enable Yvondera for size-the biggest oranges ever seen in this world, and of the size of the largest turnips They are unexpectedly found to be very good, but one of them, similar to the egg of an emu or ostrich, is quite enough at a time Here, too, are the Syrian sheep, descendants of those of whom Scriptural readers know so much They are of the heavy tailed sort, and none the better for it in appearance or condition No Eastern sheep that I saw would get favour in a cattle show, yet I looked at these here in Joppa with more respect than I ever looked on sheep before-these Bible sheep ' As a suburb to Poppa is to be seen all that remains of a village founded some years back by religious fanatics from America, of all places in the world They actually got it into their heads that the Jews were about to return to Palestine with the Messiah, and that it would be a good thing to get eaten Imbed at the chief gateway of the country, now that the Canal had cut off the overland route from Egypt They came hither, and built a wooden village, and waited about and starved Dwelling, as they did, amongst a strange people who lived upon next to nothing, it was just what was to be expected. The Messiah came not, and the Jews kept, wisely enough, in better lands Save for charitable assistance and ultimate reshipment by one of their countrymen, then on a visit here, they would have made a sad tragedy of their migration father Their deluding prophets fate I could not learn, but he had, no doubt, some way of explaining his mistakes, after the style of Dr Cumming with his prophecies of the ending of all things periodically made, and of Baxter, in his selection of the late Napoleon as " the destined monarch of the world Joppa belongs to history of all kinds ancient and modern In addition to its Old Testament connexion with Jonah is the New Testament one with Peters visit here and his strange vision Here handy to me, in one of the narrow and steep streets, is shown the house of Simon the tanner, in which Peter lodged Here he slept, and heard in his dreams that thrice repeated command as to" things el son and unclean that opened up to him a sort of free trade in food that Levitical laws had too much protected When I came to see afterwards what a museum Home had made of itself by acquisition of notable things from all lands, the omission to get this house removed to a city sacred to Peter himself seems to be in some sort an oversight I draw Hassan's attention to that as I do to other things that I don't understand, the which are sadly numerous He says that the removal would be all the more justified inasmuch as Holy Rome has already got a house, that of the Virgin down at Loretto, and called there the Santa Casa, that was removed from its foundations and taken supernaturally in one night from this land I shall see the spot whence the removal took place when I get up to Nazareth I watch his features when he tells me this, but there is no twinkle discernible in his eyes He repeats such matters part of his business and as a man of business his face is a blank Historians give to this Joppa a date that carries its existence back long before the Hood That is quite content able 1 The flood would not have hurt these solid stone houses, but only have washed them out and cleaned the streets of the dirty old place Another Hood is much wanted here just now To one of those rocks in the roadstead Strabo says that Andromeda was chained for exposure to the sea monster The chain was said to be visible here in Pliny s time, but its gone now 1 heRe Joppa people take no care of anything like all Eastern folk In modern history Joppa is like Acre further up the coast, memorable for Bonaparte s siege of it in 1700 It stood three sieges in that century from Mamelukes Arabs, and Frenchmen Bonaparte failed at Vere but succeeded here, and mercilessly massacred ! 000 of the "allan albanian defenders of the place. It is one of the many blots on the butcher blackguard 1 part of his history to massacre a lot of people for heroically defending their lives and belongings is of the vilest of deeds Here is the house where Dorcas lived, the good woman who made clothes for the needy and got her neighbours to help her, and left her name as lady patroness of all such charitable co-operative movements down to our time I go into the house of Dorcas and into that of Simon the tanner, and see how strangely they are neglected There is no charge for admission as there should be to such shrines and as there would be if another faith had power here I draw up and drink water out of the ancient well of old Simons house, and go up to its flat roof and look out to sea, and go inside and see the chamber where Peter slept and dreamed When Turkey a dominions are divided this land should be put up to auction, and Rome and holy Russia have chances of bidding for it. It is full of places out of which any quantity of saintly shrines might be made, all nominated by the heedless Synana Our camp, in the graveyard, is situated on a hill side, and we sit in the door of our tent and look out at the blue waters of the Medes terranean, and the pretty craft afloat thereon, at the troops of camels and mules departing on their up country journeys and returning thence, and at stings of travel stained pilgrims coming in from their Easter pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and their baptism in the Jordan beyond Our attention is distracted from these to a funeral that comes to the very side of our tents, where during our presence in the town a gray has been dug It is very awkward having a newly made grave by one s bedside and being only separated by canvas from a corpse ' We see now the manner of a funeral of the Greek Church, and have our tents BO thronged around by the mourners that we begin properly to feel ourselves out of place here, and that our party, dragoman and all, ought to be kicked off the ground as intruders The Greek priest wears a European shaped chimney pot hat, destitute of rim and reads over the grave a long and broad printed sheet having woodcuts at the four corners When finished with the reading he tears this sheet at each of the four sides, and deposits it on the breast of the corpse No coffin was used Only thin, white, cambric like wrappings enveloped the body, which was then let down into the ground, and the earth sprinkled upon it by the priest and the rest five ea of the deceased woman The grave was then filled up An oblong monument of rudely squared stones, about two feet in height, will be soon erected, like to those seen around Vic- feel none the happier with this newly made grave of the encoffined corpse in our midst but travellers, especially pilgrims, must be content in this graveyard may repose, for aught we know, Simon the tanner himself, with Dorcas also, who is the same as that Tabitha whom Peter came successfully hither to raise from the dead She must have died at last, and been buried somewhere, and in place most likely Peter came to do that miracle across the plains from Lydda, a days distance off, that we shall see on the up country journey We are reminded by the mention of the day B journey that ours of the next day is to be of ten hours' length The horses that we are to bestride for many days and weeks are brought round for inspection They look dismally unpromising, but quite in keeping with all surroundings Decent animals and saddles would be out of place in poor looking antiquated Joppa. We go for a ride around the neighbouring orange (grove es, and make all sorts of discoveries of our ignorance of Syrian horses We wonder at their continually throwing their heads back, and their unlimited stoppages Getting off to look into the matter and their mouths we find that they are ridden with a curb bit that has but one rein to it that rein has to be held quite slack on one finger, and used only for stopping progress A slap on the side of the neck in the approved way of turning a horse's head here The stirrups have plates to them like to the pans of old fashioned fire shot dead The edges of these stirrups do spur duty, and Ime plenty to dom that way It is careless looking riding to have such slack reins, and that over such stumbling roads as I find here I want another bit than this curb one, but it is not to be had, and I must do as others do and adopt the fashions of the country Y e therefore bitch the useless rein to the handle of the more useful umbrella about the carrying of which no in struction is needed-so everlastingly at it with one as a sun Binda The orchards to the landward side of Jopp i ire worth and well worth a visit Fish news) taken from the water and cooked at its side, or in the fisherman a boat, have a dif firent andbetterUavourtoinythingl ever got into fishmonger stands So have or rages when picked from the tree, and the same may be noted of other fruits To take a lot of these delicious small cannon ball sized oranges back to our camp would have needed a porter, or that arrangement of swinging them on a stick between two bearers, that we all remember to have seen in old Bible prints adopted by the men who were bringing back the big bunch of grapes as a specimen of the good things of this land-or the part of it then called " The Land of Promise The tents of our camp are guarded at night by a watch, changed as on shipboard every four hours a matter that I discover by wandering out of the tent during the night to look at our encampment by moonlight Sleep is not of long duration in this locality There is too much of the barking of dogs and bra) ing of donkeys for that The horses, stallion like fight and bite each other as often as they get a loose leg In these scrimmages they interfere with the tent ropes in a way that helps to make one The sight of the camp by moon light is a novel! one, and I look at it admir inga) from my seat on the edge of a grave stone In one corner is the little Greek church, with its large porch of three arches, through which glisten the near Mediterraneans moonlit waters The white tombstones are all round the white tents, which look but larger tombs seen at a little distance The Arab musketeers are sleeping about on the bogs of forage A stillness broken only by the sighing, soughing sea reigns around, and there is that newly made grave with its scarcely cold tenant in it to give solemnity to the quaint and somewhat weird like scene I had thought only to sleep in a church yard for the long sleep that ends the story, and so got troubled dreams here, and no wonder In these I find that Andromeda had got loose, and was running off with her chain, as like wise with Jonah His whale having disgorged him, had swallowed her monster, whom she called her " wretch, in his place Simon the tanner, and not Peter, had come here to raise a dead woman, who appeared not to be Tabitha, but the one whom we had that afternoon assisted to bury On being raised she came to the door of the tent to ask, strangely enough, not for covering, but for a coffin, in which to hide from the rest less ghosts of the Bonaparte massacred thousands That awoke me only to find that little snails were crawling in companies over the pillow and counterpane Our caps, boots, and clothing were covered with their trails The tent-pole had a score or more sticking to it They) were shaken out of the umbrellas like peas-pretty white shelled things, that could only be out of place in a bedroom and in the lining of one's hat, which they particularly favoured The heavy de- had made the canvas of the tents quite wet, and damped our boots to an extent that made them troublesome to get into The experience of that cold night in Joppa churchyard led to the purchase of an over, eoatnextdny Ero in its antiquated cut and queer fit it was generally) supposed to be a remand of the undistributed stock of the late Dorcas, made up by her for charitable distribution It got the name of Dorcas for thereat of the journey useful it proved for many purposes sometimes as a coat often as a counterpane, and when a horse getting and his girth loose it served for pal ding as a saddlecloth As often as not it was put on to keep the fierce scorching midd 14 ton from roasting one s backbone Among our four footed companions were two donkeys by no means the dullest of our company The propensity that one of them had for vocalisation got for him the name of Balaam He was possibly a de-, on last of that worthy a famous ass Half a dozen times during the day, and as often dunn the might be raised his voice There was a loud and clear discordance about it that was not the least of our night troubles YY then he bedad he seemed to be in no hurry to finish His look and attitude during these orations were most comical, and especially so the cure of his tail A d) sceptic member of our company was seen to smile on no other occasion When we came to know our troubles more intimately and found out what a toil it was that we had rashly undertaken, we looked upon this animal as a good fifth member of our little band, and as its fitting" representative Vie regarded him then with respect, and his vocal efforts as those of our herald or trumpeter He was generally in fullest force when he saw company approaching My horse fell lame on one occasion, and balaam had to be his substitute I encased in Dorcas, and mounted on that braying Balaam, I journeyed all day He stopped every now and again to hold forth-he always came to a dead stop for that purpose and then even the apathetic Arabs turned then to look at the pair of us with much 111 terest _
