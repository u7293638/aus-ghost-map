Mrs. Browne, too, went forward delightedly, and kissed him, and Belle knew that this was Mr. Archer. He finally readied the waiting room, end was introduced by hie sister to Mies Ford, but could only see a tall, elegant figure clad in navy blue coat and skirt and face enveloped in a thick blue gossamer, and though polite and gentlemanly, took but little interest in the young lady, whose praises he had read in every letter from his sister and his bairnies. 1 They 'were delayed slightly on their way home, and it was dinner time when they finally reached Bocantwong, with the bright . lights twinkling a welcome from the win uvne, duu Lite; upcii iiau uwi nu«t« 4ix&« Browne was standing waiting for them. A hearty greeting passed between the new comer and him, for they were much attached. The ladies hurried over their toilettes, and soon the noisy gong an nounced the welcome tidings of dinner. When Belle entered the dining room with Mrs. Browne they found the three gentlemen discussing the latest Adelaide news, and all turned as the ladies came in. Mr. Archer gave a very perceptible start as he looked at Belle, who was in a flimsy black dress, with 'neck slightly turned back, showing her shapely throat to advan tage. Some deep crimson roses amongst the lace ruffling of neck and et her belt gave just the touch -of colour needed. Fred Walton thought he had never seen a prettier picture, the more so because of the perfect albsenoe of self-consciousness. There was much animated conversation darn* dinner, whieh, however, was con ,4aSbuted chiefly by the masculine portion (of ' the company. (After dinner the gentle aftn adjourned to the wide verandah over locking, the wide, swiftly-running river, WJUOSeipeY watere where at the present momejlFturned into strips and glints of the brightest silver. ?jAfter a time Mr. Browne left to give ttjittnictions to the mem as to their duties ,(!$£ following day and to do some preying %erkl i» the office. Mrs. Browne went wot -on to the verandah, and Mr. Walton Tnurmnred something about ' Mr. Archer liking a chat with her.'.' Mrs. Browne, with a 'lfind ifttfe smile, asked him to join Miss ¥ortlr*n the drawing room and request her Ito Might them with some music and sing ing, rand to give her hie usual assistance therein/ Slothing loth, he turned into the drawing room, .and soon lovely strains came floating out into the still, perfect wiifrHt1 anil t\TV%+VtA^ onr? cia+AT1 caf lictfaninor talking at intervals in low subdued tones. AsMme air succeeded another Mr. Archer grew very quiet, smoking and thinking thinking of days which were almost for gotten, j»r at least, buried away in a corner -of hisTieart so deeply as to seem forgotten. The eight of Belle had roused the first of these ghosts of the past, though he hardly realised its resurrection ; but now in this perfect moonlight, with the masses of willow foliage waving gently and the swish ing ajnging eound of the river, and the old familiar airs' of welljknown operatic duetts, brought with a rush scenes and memories ef a far distant home in England, and a girl tall and slender and dark -wh& was all the world to him. Matter-of-fact and prosai«, he .mentally pooh-poohed such absurd memories, and tried to «rusb them back into their long occupied prison, and started ta.-oig to Mrs. jtrowne of his children and of mutual' friendB in the di&. Presently, after a pause in the music and audible en treaty from Mr. Walton, a few notes of symphony were struck; and -Belle's voice rang out in all its sweetness, which was intensified -by the perfectly played violin obligate. - \- Oh, have you, forgoten me quite, dear, Or eay do you sometimes dream What life might have been had we wandered Together by wood and stream f Do '-you think ol the days vim my lore was til The world could *give or take, - Or say with a wgt .they were happy days i Just for the old love'e sake, Just (or the old love's «&«, sweetheart, Just for. the old lore's cake. 'Thank you, Miss Ford,' said Mrs. ♦Browne. ' I think that is one of the prettiest of your many pretty songs,' and turning to her brother she asked if he did 'not tfcffik it so. To her surprise he gave her bo -answer, and -she asked if he were tired ; .if so he should retire, as he was not quite well yet. With a ehort laugh he beggv. ber pardon for his inattention* said he was afraid bis wits had -gone .wool gathering, and thought he would go to bed. He retired to his room, and getting a com fortable chair, lose coat and slippers, ' -he threw the window up, and patting* out his light, sat blowing rings of smoke out into the night, air, «nd lefting alfcthe memories of a Bweet past come trooping out, till he fsrgot he was' half a century old, that eityer enreads were plainly to be seen amongst ,his raven coloured locks, ' now, alas ! thinner a great deal than of yore, forgot he was a practical Australian squatter, »vho ' delighted in conning the price of wool and what sheep a&Q; 'horses *were worth, and what the rainfall had been- on thelbaek run. \--ld Sqae stood still «ad let him go back twenty-nine years, and he flaw an old grey mansipn, with -willows growing in .the brook which ran in front of it, and a wide garden full of roses, W&c;, and laburnum, and flitting amongst them all the tall slender ghost ' of '* this ev«hing's resurrection, so strangely like Miss Ford, his children's govemees. And as he eat the mingling voices came from the room below him in tbe juett, 'Are Saactassuna.' Strange, strange, indeed ! Shis slander gjrl irf his youthful dpeams had eung this^ doe^t with,, him so often, and fc« 4i^ 4«rn«l'the inusic of ' Jurt -for the Old Love's Sake' so many times in those nappy days of yore. There must be something more than mere chance resemblance. He would question his sister' in the morning as to who Miss Ford really was, and if only he found she was related to, the only real love of his life, she could peAaps tell him how it had fared with her. hrail these long years. ' Just then he beard a tap upon his bed room door, and coming beck to the present with a start, he went across and opened it, and fosnd his little daughter Ida in dress ing gowa and slippers standing on the mat. He etooped 4*4 kfted her -in Jus arms, and went back to hie chair, and wrapping her. in his coat, asked her why she was out oi bed at that hour. Two little anas went round his neck, and he was kiaeed on cheeks and lips and brow, after a fashkn ol her own ; then she settled against him and told him she couldn't sleep, jthatsBhe? heard him come up early,' and ihfvH^iJfced to kiss him again, because it vas«ufch a long-time since she had «eea 4fii£ tefore^ Mtadie was asleep, and wouldn't speak.tojbCT, and Miss Ford wfLB in the drawing room singing, and she, Ida, wa» 'lonely. ' Her father kissed the little face near his own, and reproached himseU for nob having seen more of his children. -Still, with the newiy-aiwafeened memories in his heart, he thought as he looked' 'into the little face with the large dark eyes of another as sweet and inno cent looking, and .sighed for the lost years otlq/ve.
