Bungawalbin. (From a Coruesvondent.) Septemiieh 30.— Tho prospocts for tho present aro oncouraging. Hoavy rain foil hero on tho 21st, which was badly wautod to roplonish our tanks. Tho farmers have boen very bus}* ovor since cano arid maize planting. A largo area of both crops will bo planted this season. Through tho grub post thoso that plantod maize in August havo found it necessary to re- plant'. Grass seoms vory slo«r of growth, owing, it is believed, to the soddonod stato of the land after so much rain. Tho cattlo aro vory poor, and now the spring has sot iu many of them are affected with what is believed to bo scour, and the weaker onos succumb to its effects. I notico the Tuckurimba Progress Asso ciation is drawing the attention of owners to tho nuisance created by dead stock in tho vicinity of roads, and also tho river, with a view of comcolling them to burn or dostroy thom, which is a move in tho right direc tion, for many unscrupulous pooplo make the river a cesspool for thoir filth. Vory roceutly some of the residents of Bungawalbin wero treated to unpleasant ness in this direction by a porson who posos beforo tho public as a Christian, ho having on his occupied land a dead beast which he refused to burn until the services of Mr. Daniel Hogau were sought. Mr._ E. 'W. Blakeney, of the Harbours and Rivors Department, has mado a final survoy for the wharf hero, much to the satisfaction of the neighbourhood. A madman, or a man mad drunk— perhaps tho person himself knows which — on Saturday night, 20th September, about tho time peoplo wero retiring to rest, signalised his appoarance by his demon like yolls, much to the horror of women and children. Perhaps it would be woll to advise the would-be ghost, when he wishes to perform another of his fronks, to havo the manliness not to take advantage of a lone woman and little childron.
