POETRY. COM SCIENCE AND FUTURE JUDGMENT. (PEOM THX SPECTATOR.) I nt atone with my conscience, In place where lime toad ceased. And we talked of our former living ID the land where the years increased. And I felt that I should have to answer The questions it put to me, A*d to face the answer Â»nd questions Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my Bight, And things that 1 thought were deid things Wtre alive with a-terrible might. And the vision of alt my past life Was an awful thing to face Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far-away warning, Of a Borrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future, But now is the present time. And I thought of mj former thinking, Of the judgment day t > be, But sitting atone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough tor me. And I wondered if (here was a future To this land beyond the grave; But no one gave me answer, And no one came to save. Then I felt that tbe future was present, Arid the present would never go by.' For it was but the thought of my past life Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming. And the vision passed away, And I know tbe far-away warning Was a warning of yesterday And I pray that I may not forget it In this land before tbe grave, That I may not cry in tbe future, And no one come to save. And so I had Teamed a 'esson Which I ought to have learned before, And which, tbongh I learned it dreaming, I hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with my conscience In the place wbere the years increase, And I try to remember tne future In tbe land wbere timi shall cease. And I know of tbe future judgment, How dreadful soe'er it hie, That to sit alone with my conscience Will be judgment enough for me.
