Attchison. 129\. Syllabic Charade. —Selected by JUVENTUS. To lend you my first is considered polite, Though none but a rogue ever parts with it quite; To offer my second is quite an abuse; Though to cover my first it is often of use; Of all plagues and vexations 'tis one of the worst, "When my whole through my second gets into my first. 130\.

H. 138\. In 1837 an amiable gentleman left Mr. S.'s hut in Wakefield-street to walk to his iffint near Trinity Church. He said that after walking straight for a short time he should see the tent fires, and then he would have no difficulty. Kufc being very short sighted, the night cloudy?, and the track very much' obstructed by fallen timber, he wandered the following very strange course: —N.W. 225 feet, N.N.W. 183 feet, N.N.E. 84 feet, N.E. 172 feet, E. 105 feet, S.E. 216 feet, S. 155 feet, S.W. 268 feet, and 31 feet 53° E. of S.

Solutions of Problems Published Sept. 12. 106\. Edwin's, legacy £3,400; Henry's £3,100; William's £3,500. 107\. Amount of Edwin's capital, £3,900. 108\. Henry's capital, £4,500 109\. William's capital, £2,400. 110\. Edwin's capital, £4,940; Henry's £5,600. 111\. William's capital, £4,200. 112\. Edwin's share, £4,200; Henry's, £5,250; William's, £3,150. 113\. Edwin's capital, £4,515; Henry's, £4,515; William's, £2,709. 114\. Edwin's share, £5,922; Henry's, £4,935; William's £3,948. 115\. Edwin received £6,560, and gained i £1,296 ; Henry received £4,920, and gained £972; William received £3,280, and gained £64S. 116\. Edwin now possessed £3,400, Henry £3,100, and William £3,500. Total £10,000 as at the first. In reference to the above series of pro blems which we named an "Arithmetical Labyrinth," we have received only five absolutely correct replies—namely, from Eledon, T. More, Cynic, Francis Don nelly, and Nemo. John Holt, Jun., gives £2,700 instead of £4,200 as the answer to Problem HI. As all his sub sequent answers are perfectly correct the error was probably made in transcribing bis rough notes. The same remark applies to A. Monks, who is wrong in No. 114, but right in the remaining answers. 0. Tepper miscalculates the amount of the proceeds of the sale of land in Problem 114, hat dex terously puts himself right again by assuming that there was an error or misprint in the statement of the question. Francis Duffield, who is generally very accurate in his com putations of even the most abstruse problems, makes a slight error in No. 112, which vitiates his subsequent calculations. Dusky Farm is correct till he arrives at the sixth question of the series. He then goes astray and abandons the task. H. B. W. is sin gularly erratic, yet he contrives to rectify his own errors in a manner which argues greater ingenuity than was required to go right. His answers to Nos. 106 and 107 are correct, and to 103 incorrect; in the next two prob lems he is again right; he then leaps over No. 112 at a bound, and gives correct answers to two of the four remaining questions ; but misapplies the numbers in all cases after Ho. 111\. P. O. Hutchinson (aged. 11) answers the first six questions correctly, and does nob venture further. J. Aitchison gives correct answers to questions 106 to 112 inclusive. Ulodhopper hops off the track after working the first three questions, and at the fifth of the series fairly gives in. James Boyd says— "I have wandered through the Labyrinth till 112 and can't get further." He does not send the result. Some of our correspondents intimate that the series of questions involved the necessity of unreasonably long processes of calculation, whilst others express a hope that another Labyrinth will soon be con structed. Memo suggests " something of the hind in trigonometry;" and A. R. R. recommends that the questions should be more complex but fewer in number." We shall endeavour to meet the wishes of all parties in succession; but they must not get impatient. Correspondence. The new problems sent by the following eontributorsare acknowledged with thanks :— Dunlop, J. H., Jun., J. and L. Barrett, Jas. Boyd, Y. B. H., J. Aitchison. Multiplication of Roman Numerals.— " Anaxagoras,"'in reference to this subject, writes as follows. "I have been considering the curious question of Y. B. H. as to how the Romans would multiply XXVII by XIX. I really don't know, perhaps by means of some modified form of the Abacus. I think however that the following will show at least how they migltt have proceeded though possibly they were not so stupid in these matters as many of us may suppose. My plan is this. Arrange a number of vertical columns for the collection of the several classes of numbers, as units, tens, fifties, hundreds, &c.;, with a separate column on the right for negative numbers. Place the fractions in the nume rator and denominator respectively in the columns appropriated to each. Multiply each term of the multiplier into each of the multiplicand, and add up the totals. . Sub tract the negative from the positive numbers, and when necessaiy cany the lesser terms forward into the greater. The result will be the answer, thus Multiply XXVTI by XEX (27 X 19)=513. 5 hiin- Hun- Fif-T_na tt Nega dreds.dreds. ties.iens-Urats- tives. xx vxi x ix 9X7 = 9 X 20 = cc 10 X 7 = 10 X 20 = cc First total ... ccec ll xxx iii xx.

Answer 12o&aH;^3ocx—9c£c—HAabxy —§&cxy-;\\-\2dxy. By-the-by, can any of your readers divide by Roman numerals—say DXTTI by XXVII? 1 have tried, but without success." J. Aitchison.—We regrot that we cannot publish your geometrical -theorems, but the answers would necessitate the insertion of Magic Squares.—Mr. C. Todd, Superin tendent of Telegraphs, has kindly consented to examine the magic squares of high num bers furnished by Mr. Catlow and Mr. Bassett, with a view to deciding upon their relative merits.
