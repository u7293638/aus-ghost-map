s POETRY, I... THE PURPLE EAST. m i. You in Mgh places ; you that drive the steeds Of Empire ; you that say unto our hosts, 'Go Blither,' and they go; and from our coasts . Bid sail the squadrons, and they sail, their ; deeds .... ' j Shaking the world : lo ! from a lana tnat | pleads . j- For mercy where no mercy is, the ghosts j Look in upon you faltering at your posts— j! Upbraid you parleying while a People bleeds . I' To death. What stays the thunder in your- ' hand? i A fear for England P Can her pillared : Only on faith forsworn securely stand, ' On faith forsworn that murders babes and men? £ Are such the terms of Glory's tenure? j Then I Fall her accursed greatness, in God's name ! ! n. ' '" ) Heaped in their ghastly graves they lie, the j breeze ; Sickening o'er fields where others vainly j wait i For burial : and the butchers keep Mgh I state i In silken palaces of perfumed ease. - - The pantiier of -the desert,- -matched- with ' these, I' Is pitiful ; besido their lust and hate, _ ' Fire and the plague-wind are compassionate, j Ar.d soft the deadliest fangs of ravening seas. !v How long shall they be borne ? Is not the cup Of crime yet full? Doth devildom still lack Some i consummating crown, that we hold back The scourge, and in Christ's borders give them room? How long shall it he borne, O England ? Up, Tempest of God, and sweep' them to their doom ! — William Watson. i
