INTERCOLONIAL NEWS. NEW SOUTH WALES. TERRIBLE AFFLICTION -The Wagga Wagga Advertiser, in noticing the fact that an unhappy individual named Rush has gone out of his mind, and has been sent to gaol for medical treatment, gives a i estate of his unfortunate case, premising that Rush was a man of considerable intelligence and some education, and evidently much attached to his wife It on poorE that Mrs Rush died suddenly at Mitta I gong, some thirty -five miles from Wagga Wagga, I and the coronor was sent for He refused to attend, but sent out a trooper with an order to Rush to hung in the body to Wagga Wagga so that on inquest might be held in the mean time preparations had been made for the decent interment of the body in the graveyard at Mit ' tagong. Rush, however, was compelled to bring or send the body of his dead wife to Wagga Wagga As no one volunteered for the soil duty, he had to undertake it himself, and hero too have the creditable spectacle in a Christian country of a husband driving the dead body of his wife, a distance of thirty five miles, mostly in the dark, along a di ear y bush-road, for the purpose of relieving n poid coroner of a positive duty. The inquest was held the husband, so great was his mental excitement after his fearful journey, I hardly know how or where and practice having been satisfied, to Rush was left the duty of, burying his wife, or to see it performed by the some heartless authority which had already so grievously insulted both her and himself. He was a stranger and friendless, and once more had to resume his lonely journey with the dead unable to afford a proper funeral, he had to take the body in a cart to the cemetery himself, getting the vehicle bogged by the way, and being almost compelled to abandon the corpse on the roadside for the night. The case is a most mournful one, and whether the w reached man's present condition be due to intemperance or not,, the public, we are sure, will agree that it reflects seriously on the person whose neglect of his palpable duty subjected poor Rush to a trial too heavy for him to bear It only remains to add, to complete the full horror of the case, that RUSH is now a lunatic under the medical charge of the man to whom, if to any one, is to be attributed his temble of action CHARLES STEWART, a culprit, who is not four teen years of age, and a younger lad he had persuaded to accompany him, left the stations some time ago, where they were employed to look after sheep, with the intention of taking to the road They stole two horses from a paddock near Murrumburrah, one of which Now art afterwards exchanged for a gun, and having robbed a little boy of his boots, at Coolac, were pursued by the lad's father, who obtained the assistance of the police at Gundagai, and they were captured near Nangus. The younger culprit was returned to his parents, but his associate and leader was committed for trial, and was sentenced last week to eighteen months' imprisonment, with hard labor, in Goulburn gaol Goulburn Herald AN ENORMOUS KANGAROO-Mr. Thomas M'Donald, of Duramana, killed on Sunday last, on the road at the book of Mount Ranken, about six miles from Bathurst, one of the largest kangaroos that has ever been seen in this district According to the Bathurst Times, Mr M Donald was accompanied by two dogs, and shortly after being sighted, the " old man " was brought to say there was no heavy timber in the immediate vicinity of the spot, so that the t veteran of the forest was unable to obtain any back support in the shape of a large tree, and was placed rather at a disadvantage when attacked by his canine opponents He defended himself with great obstinacy, however, and it was not until he had been brought to earth twelve times that he " gave up the ghost" During the attack, Mr. M'Donald stood close at hand with a loaded gun ready to dispatch the kangaroo in the event of either of the dogs being seized , but owing to the wideness with which they fought, they did not sustain a single scratch. Upon being measured, the animal was found to be over seven feet in length, and it is estimated that it weighed upwards of two out The tail alone, when cut off, measured four feet three inches in length, by twenty-four inches in circumference, at the thickest putt, and its weight was 21 lbs. AN OLD CLAIM The petition recently pro- sented to Parliament by Hugh Maguire, at present of Sydney, shepherd, alleges that, while Sir 1 Thomas Brisbane was governor and vice admiral of the colony of New South Wales, Petitioner was appointed (having previously held the office of superintendent and inspector of roads and clearing parties of upwards of 3000 men from eighty to ninety gongs between Liverpool, Cowpasture Myrtle Creek, and Parramatta that the records of that period of the Sydney police court will show petitioner's services to the Government, and also the chief engineer's office (Major Ovens for the monthly estimates of labor performed by the men over whom your petitioner was in charge that in consequence of the valuable services rendered to the then Government of this country by petitioner, a grant of 500 acres of land, situate in or near the district of Liverpool or the Cowpasture, which, although repeated applications have been made therefor, have never yet been issued to petitioner, who conceives he is fairly entitled thereto by virtue of such promise at the time, and having reference to the said services and the then condition of the colony that grants were issued under similar promises by the same Go- vernment amongst others, to Mr. Joseph Peters of Emu Plains, who was only overseer of one farm there and petitioner, therefore, prays such relief as the justice of the case shall require. -Sydney Empire. THE Albury Banner calls attention to the way in which runs suffer from Hooks of travelling sheep. " There are two or three favorite resorts by which communication is kept up between the hill country and the plains, and one of these lines of travel is the frontage to the Billabong Creek. Along the whole length of this great feeder of the Murray and Edward the country lying within a mile or so of the road is now the very picture of bore, Btorilo desolation, not a blade of grass shows its head above the brown and dusty ground, and in the timbered districts the bare surface is only relieved by fallen trees and firo-bluckonod limbs The tract of country which has thus been eaten bare and trodden down forms the most valuable part of each run along the Billabong frontage " " It seems to be only reasonable," Boys the Ronner, " that the Crown lesBoesBhoiild be entitled to levy a slight toll of some kind upon travelling sheep, and especially upon flocks that travel only because the runs to which they belong are habitually and knowingly overstocked, so as to make travelling, rather preying, upon other runs, a necessity of existence " THE WEATHER AT WAGGA WAGGA-The Advertiser says -"The waters of the Murrumbidgee attained their greatest rise on Sunday morning, 27th ultimo, when they stood at 16 feet 9 inches above summer level.
