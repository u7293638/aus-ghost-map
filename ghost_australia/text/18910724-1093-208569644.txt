' The" chaplain stood forward- and read- the^ usual prayers.

And JFeiafy j stared at him stolidly. ; '' Sheriff,' he began at last, alter aTery long. ?pause, bracing himself up for an effort, "Tva done my duty aHmylifetill this, and Fll do it nowi;; There airi't going to be no execution at aU here this morning!'.' ? ' The sheriff-gazed at him astonished. _ ? " What do you .-.mean, Stokes _he asked, taken aback at this sudden turn. "No reprieve has come. Theprisoner is to be hanged with out fail to-day in accordance with his sentence. It says so in the warrant-: ' wherein fail not at your peril.'" - . ; . , . . Jerry- looked round him with an air of expectation. " No reprieve.hasn't coma, yet," lie-answered, in a stolid- way ; "but Fm ex-: pecting one presently.; I've done my duty all my life, sheriff, I tell you, and Til do: it now. I ain't a-agoing to hang: this man :at all-ba-. cause I know he's innocent." The prisoner gasped, and turned round to him in amaze.. " Yes, I'm innocent ?" he said slowly looking him over from, head to foot : " but you-how do you know it ?" . -'I know it hy. your face,".Jerry answered sturdily, " and I know by the other one's. face it was him that.did it." , The sheriff looked on' in puzzled wonder ment. This was a hitch in the proceedings he had never expected. "Your conduct is most irregular, Stokes," he said at last - stroking his chinin his embarrassment; "most irregular and disconcerting. If you had a conscientious scruple against hangingthe prisoner you should have told us before. Then we might have arranged for some other executioner to serve in your place. As it. is, the delay is most un seemly and painful-especially for the prisoner. Your action can only cause him unnecessary \- suspense. Sooner or later this morning, some-, body must hang him." But Jerry only looked back at him with an approving nod. The sheriff had supplied him, all- inarticidate that he "was; with - suitable ? speech. " Ah, thafs just it, don't you see," he made answer promptly, ' 'it's a conscientious scruple. < That's why I won't hang him. No man can't be 'expected to go agin his con science. I never hanged an innocent man yet. -leastways not to my knowledge ; and s'help me heaven, I won't hang one now, not for the Queen nor for nobody ^ , The sheriff paused. The sheriff deliberated. *' What on earth am I to do?" he exclaimed, in-, despair. " If you won't hang him, how on earth at this hour can I secure a substitute?' Jerry stared at him stolidly once more, after his wont. " If J don't hang him, he answered, .with the air of one who knows his ground well, " it's vour business to do it with; ^our own hands." 4 Wherein fail not at your peril.' And I give you warning beforehand; sheriff, if you doliang him-why, you'll have to remember all your life long'that you helped to get rid of an innocent man, when the common hangman refused to execute him!" To such a pitch of indignation was he roused by events that he said it plump.out,;just so, "the common hangman." Rather than let his last appeal lack aught of effectiveness in the cause of justice, he.consented so to endorse the public condemnation of his own respec table, useful, and necessary calling. There was a pause of a few minutes, during which the sheriff once more halted and hesitated; the prisoner looked around with a pale and terrified air; and Jerry kept his eye fixed hard on the gate, like one who really ex pects a reprieve or a pardon. "Thenyou absolutely refuse?" the sheriff: asked at last; in a despairing sort of way. "Iabsolutely refuse," Jerry answered, in a very t decided: tone. But it was blear he was beginning to grow anxious and nervous. " In that case," the sheriff replied;: turning round to the jailor, "I must put toff this execution for half an hour, till I*can get some one else to come in'and assist me." ; Hardly had he spoken the words, ./however, v-aen a policeman appeared at the door; of the courtyard and in a very hurried voice asked eagerly to be admitted. ; His mannerwas that of a man who brings important _ news. " The execution's not over, sir ?' he said,- turning to the sheriff-with .a very, scared face. =-?" Well, thank heaven for that! Dr. Wade's outside, and he says, for God's sake, he must speak at once with you." 1 ? The sheriff hesitated.. He hardly. knew what to do. " Bring him in," he said at last, after a solemn pause. "He may have something to tell us that will help us out of this difficulty. " The condemned man, thus " momentarily re-: suited on the very brink of the grave, stood by with a terrible look of awed suspense upon his bloodless-face. But Jerry Stokes's lips bore an expression of quiet. triumph. He had suc ceeded in his attempt, then. He had brought his man to book. Tnat was something to be proud of. Alone he had done it ! He had saved, the innocent and exposed the guilty! As they stood there and pondered, each man in silence, on his own private thoughts, the Soliceman returned,: bringing .with him the octor-whose evidence had weighed . most against Ogilvy at the trial. Jeiry Stokes started to see the marvellous alteration in the fellow's face. ';He was pale and haggard ; his lips were parched, and his eyes" had a sunken"" and hollow look with remorse and horror. . Cold sweat stood on his brow,' His mouth twitched horribly.. It was dear that he had just passed through a terrible crisis. . : He turned first to Jerry. His lips were bloodless, and trembled as he spoke; his throat was dry j but in a husky voice he still managed to deliver himself of the speech that haunted him. ''Your letter did it," he said . slowly fixing his eyes on the hangman; "I couldn't stand that. It broke me down utterly. All night long I lay awake and knew I had sent him to the gallows in my place.. It was terrible-terrible! But I wouldn't give way; I'd made up my mind, and I meant to pull through ^with it. Then the morning came tlie morning of the execution, and with it your letter. Till that moment I thought nobody. knew but myself. I wasn't even suspected. When I saw you knew I could stand it no longer. You said-' If you let this innocent man swing in your place I, the common hangman, will refuse to execute him. If he dies 111 avenge him. I'll hound .you to your, grave. ITI follow up clues till I've brought your crime home to .you. Don't commit two murders instead of one. It'll do you no good and be worse in the "end for you.' When I read those words-those terrible words '.-from the common hangman, "' Ah, heaven,' I "thought, 'I need try to conceal it no longer.' All's up now. I've come to confess. Thank heaven I'm in time. Sheriff, let this man go. It was I who poisoned her." There was a dead silence again for several seconds. Jerry Stokes was the first of them all to break it. "I knew it," he said solemnly. "I was sure of it. I could have sworn to it." " And l am sure of it, too," .the condemned man put in with tremulous lips. "I was sure it-was he; but how on earth was I to prove it?" The sheriff looked about him at all three in turn. " Well,"-he said deliberately, with a sigh of relief, "I must telegraph for instruc tions to Ottawa immediately. Prisoner, you are not reprieved; but under these peculiar circumstances, as Dr. Wade makes a volun tary confession of having committed the crime himself, I defer the execution for the present' on my own responsibility. Jailer, I remit Mr. Ogilvy to the cells till further instructions arrive from the Viceroy. Policeman, take charge of Dr. Wade, who gives himself into custody for the murder of Mrs. Ogilvy. Stokes, perhaps you did right after all. Ten minute delay made all the difference. If you'd consented to hang the prisoner at first this confession might only have come after all was over." . - - ' The doctor turned to Jerry with the wan ghost of a grim smile upon his worn and pallid face. The marks of "a great struggle were still visible in. every line. "And you won't be baulked of your fee, after all," he added, with a ghastly effort at cynical raininess, " for you'll have me to hang before you have seen the end of this business." But Jerry shook his head. "I ain't so sure about that,", he said, scratching his thick, bullet poll, and holding his great square neck a little on one side. -1 ain't so sure of my trade as I used to be once, sheriff and gentle men. I always used to hold it was a useful," a respectable, and a necessary trade, and of benefit to the community. But I've began to doubt it. If the law can string up an inno cent man like this, and no appeal, except for the exertions of the public executioner, why, I've began to doubt the expediency, so to speak, of capital punishment. 1 ain't so certain as I was about the usefulness of hanging. Dr. Wade, I think somebody else may* have the turning of you off. Mr. Ogilvy, I'm glad, sir, it was me that had the hanging of you. An unscrupulous man might ha? gone for his fee. . I couldn't do thatj I gone for justice. Give me your hand, Bir. Thank you. You needn't be ashamed of shaking hands once in a way with a public functionary-especially when it's for the last time in hisofficial career. "Sheriff, I've had enough of this 'ere work for life. I go back to the lumbering trade. I resign my appointment." It was a great speech for Jerry-an oratorical effort. But a prouder or happier man there wasn't in Kingston that day than Jeremiah Stokes, late public executioner.-The Strand, Magazine. '? ? ' ' ? Mr. H. M.
