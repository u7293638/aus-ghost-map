The earl's daughter^kad openly quitted' Hampton Court, oh an^os tensible visit to friends in the country; and had'tnadahor way, by a circuitous ' route, to iLimely.f where she had found the pony ?carriage and faithful old coachman frpm, Tho'Eveigrcen's 'in waiting for'1 her.1 As suring herself that she was not- watched i or foljpwed from' the '? station, she rhad'sot out 'directly for- the hidden home. -'? '? '? As the carriage neared its destination, and the old.coaphman prepared to feet down from his box, the wide gate of The Evergreens swung- open on its well-oiled hinges, aud, as they ? passed through,, it closed noiselessly behind them. . ??? . :The hour was between sunset and dusk. Jt had'; been light out in :the pleasant street; but a soft, obscure twilight reigned here under the thick-spreading 'firs, larches',' and pines. The Lady1 Beatrice bont'- a quick, -searching glance iuto the brooding shadow.*, and ? at the same moment a gay, childish laugh rang out, a!nd her youngest darling bpunded fpr . ward | ''climbing into the carriage, which had -halted. : . -: 'My'bpy!

'You received my letter, then, that! should be ?home to-night to spbnd a week with you ? Are they all well — papa, Rupert, and ?Meggy r'. ? A.t the mention of his name, before Pay 'had' time to reply.' Rupert emerged' from thei shadows, andapproaohed the carriage. In a mpment mpre he too was seated, dn the.vohiclo, clasped in a warm embrace, and thenthe whole party moved on up the shadowed winding drive toward the house., ?;Tlie, Lady Beatrice had been at home but once since the departure from it of Giralda, and that was ion . the night of the Hampton ball, when she had passed out ,as one pf. the guosts. She had deemed it best since, knowing, the vigilance of her enemy,- Lord. Adlowe, to remain away from The Evergreens entirely, lost she should bring discovery and trouble upon hor husband.. Her .anxieties and lior affections rhad, at last conquered her dis cretion, as we have seen. :: The house was lighted, and tho self stylod count, beaming with happiness, was on the steps, to give his wife wel come. He . lifted her out of the carriage as she drove up, and half carridd, her into the drawing-room, the two boys following. .- 'A whole week of bliss, before us!' said the husband, drawing the Lady Beatrice upon a ,sofa beside .him, and gently removing hor wrappings.
