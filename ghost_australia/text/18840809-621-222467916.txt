Moonrlse in Australia. A trackless forest all around Of lof by gums that from the ground As saplings sprang in ages past ; The short sweet twilight fadeth fast. And from the forest depths I hear The locust's whirling noise, the clear, Soft magpie song, the sudden scream Where cockatoos like wild ghosts gleam Among the melancholy boughs ; The wild dog's bark from where there browse Stray herds of kangaroos, the cry Of something death-struckâ€” as I lie And listen to these sounds I see Long moonbeams pierce a lofty tree, Like random lances thrust to kill Some fiend who baffles all their skill ; And even as with sleepy eyes I watch, the full moon through the skies Sails with a seeming moveless motion, A globe of fire in a purple ocean.
