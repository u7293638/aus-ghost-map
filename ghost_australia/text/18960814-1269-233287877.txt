Ghosts. The Hobart ghost seems to have taken himself away to the land of spooks again. As for the Launceston spectre, we doubt very much if he ever really existed. The Hobart ghost was at least a gentleman. On one occasion a young lady was frightened into a swoon by a phosphorescent glare surrounding a gigantic figure in black. When she came to, standing over her was a gentleman clad in a long black macintosh, who assisted her to rise, and politely suggested that perhaps he might have the pleasure of seeing her home. The maiden was glad of the offer, for the street was lonely and she did not wish to again have a private interview with his ghostship. They walked to the lady's home, the gentleman expressing the greatest concern and sympathy for his fair charge, and discussed the enormity of the offence of the individual who played the ghost and frightened women and children almost to death. With grateful words she thanked him at the gate. Then as he turned to go he suddenly threw out his arms and was transformed into the semblance of a huge bat, with wings all alight with sulphurous flames. It was the ghost, but he was gone in a moment and hasn't since been seen.
