ELSTERNWICKPARK MEETING, I SATOEDAT, FIB. 21 The one o'clock special (run to the mil appointed and pictnresque course of the V T.C. was well patronised to-day, and the attendance altogether wm a considerable im provement on aome former occasions, Thi weather, also, was delightful, if we excepttha dust, which the breeze from the bay stirred np now and again rather disagreeably. Sharp to time the three starters tor the Mtidm ' Trot were on the track, and it ia eatiBfactorj to record that the committee are at laet determined to make examples of (bott drivers who persistently delay the start Tbe notices issued, in fact, state " that seren paniehment will be inflicted on all who cauBe delay in starting- the new at iai time." Then riders ot drivera failing to score up at tbe appointed time " will be sun marily dealt with," whilst the 11 jadcu will fine any rider or driver who, at or after tin time appointed for starting the raoe, takes hie horse sway round the track for ezetciaa." ThiB is aa it should be, for trotting is, titer all, a very monotonous sport, and the bill must needs be kept steadily rolling in order to keep np the interest. Tbe afternoon's sport began aa uaaat with the Maiden Trot, for whiobDickGoldtbronih was made a warm favourite, and be ampfr compensated for the unpleasantneta cream a former occasion by winning with * ridiculous ease. Tbe winner has a i _ style of going, and, were he trotting brino1 self, would give an off-band idea that he wu nntuaally slow; bat he is a useful howl® all that, and will pay his way well.
