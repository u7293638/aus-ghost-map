PLAYING THE GHOST. Some creature with a diabolical disposi- tion and a stock of sulphur has been ap- pcaring at unexpected corners of suburban streets lately and scaring the wits out of solitary pedestrians with very mundane tricks in the guise of a ghost. "It" has appeared at Collingwood, and after des- troying the halcyon bliss which the con- nubially inclined have hitherto found in the shaded seclusion of Victoria Park after sundown, has ventured into the open streets. The local police, says the Age, have received reports of three scares in Victoria Park on Sunday night, and one in Hotham-street, at the corner of Blanche- street, on Monday night. A lad named Robt. Wm. Brown, aged 12 years, of 32 Mater-street, was on his way home from night school at 9.30, and was suddenly con- fronted by a man whose "breastplate" revealed, with a phosphorescent glow, the appalling words, "Prepare to meet thy doom," while a sepulchral voice announced a malign intent to cut off the poor shaking boy's head "in two shakes." This threat caused the boy to race home, screaming as he ran and followed by what he has described as "the object." Several persons were attracted by by his cries, and the "ghost's" materialised feet clattered with most unghostly noise across the footway and over a vacant piece of land out of sight. The Acting-Governor, when speaking at Fitzroy a week ago, told his audience that he knew of no better remedy for peregrin- ating vagabonds than the horse pond, where available. It was old fashioned, but effectual. A course of such treatment would doultless put this perturbed spirit to rest.
