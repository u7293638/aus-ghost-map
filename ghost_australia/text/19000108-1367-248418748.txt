A MIRAGE. THE Queanbeyan Age says:â€”Travellers tell queer tales of the deceptive mirages in the centre of Australia, and even in the northern parts of New South Wales, but it seems odd to bear of them in the southern and cooler parts. Mirages are delusive reflections which appear suspended in the hot air. They mostly take the form of water and sometimes of sand. A mirage is reported by Messrs. G. J. Lesmond and J. Patterson, two Qiieatibeyan cyclists. On Sunday morning these two rode to Yass. It was whilst riding from Yass to Tangmaoearoo that they met with the mirage. They were riding along on a perfectly level road, when they suddenly noticed what they thought was a pool of water, some 20 yards square, lying across the road. They rode on and passed it, and were astonished tq,find that the water they saw,; which was glistening with the sun's reflection, disappeared as they approached. [Must have been " Chook's" ghost].
