J THE PEOPLE OF CYPRUS. I I (Flt-H ST. JAMES'S BUDGET, NOV. 12 ) j No good census of the whole island has yet be.-, completed. The clerks of the land registry offices of Cyprus, who go round at the commencement of the year to note new properties and improvements, record at the same time the births and deaths of males during the previous twelve months, in order to establish the numbers between 18 and 60 years of age who should pay batt a crown a year as the military exemption tax. Concealments are common, in order to cheat the tax gatherer, and one of the strongest arguments against this impost is that it encourages falsification in the very basis of the statistical information of the island The Mussulmans also dislike any prying into the harem portion of their households, and an indiscretion on the part of a clerk in taking such a census in one of the Turkish provinces not long since was the cause of his murder 'this year an endeavour is being made to obtain more accurate information , but some of the returns showed clearly that they were quite untrustworthy In some districts in previous years attempts have been made to get at rough and approximate figures, and the results were that in Limassol in November, 1878, there was returned a total population of 23,000, living in 10,000 houses in Larnaca 10,700 persons inhabited 8 100 houses and in Kyrema Â£1,000 inhabitants and 3,100 houses were returned, this gives for Kyrema nearly four persons to each house, and for Limaaol and Larnaca only a little over two persons, which is an absurdly small proportion, and at once shows the statistics to be erroneous In Famagusta district, the commissioner estimates, the triangles are equal in number to the males In situated district only 11,100 females are tabulated, as against 12,200 males in the town of Limassol we are asked to believe that there are only "ill Moslem females to 50 males, while 1436 Christian females are returned in the same town out of a total population of 2 825 As to the proportion of Moslems, Kyrema district gives 20 per cent, Larnaca town 23. percent, LimaBol town 25 per cent, and Larnaca and Papho district 32. percent each, which instances are sufficient to show that nearly three fourths of the native population is Christian Thirteen villages in Larnaca and 22 in Kyrema are purely Christian, while four in Larnaca and eight in Kyrema are entirely Moslem , but in the majority of villages the population is mixed and lives' amicably and harmoniously In these mixed villages there is generally both a Christian and a Moslem mukhtar or headman, and a recent ordinance for the election of councils in the towns gives proportionate representation to both creeds In the village of Knlebournou, in areas, which is entirely Moslem, the villagers are said to speak nothing but Greek The Greek men almost every where in the island, but especially in higher K areas, are fine, straight, well built fellows while in their prime, it is quite a sight to see when the idle youngsters from the far villages swagger in their fine clothes through the Friday bazaar of Nicosia, the chief market of the week They move about on the roads and tracks generally upon donkeys, without stirrups, urging the animal by constantly swinging their pendant legs to and fro Distressed by the bad harvest of last year, hundreds, both of men and women, took to work on the Government roads, and, though disposed to laziness, proved, under energetic superintendence to be hardy, docile, and enduring When they got used to English picks and shovels they did a good day's work of nine hours , living on nothing but black bread, onions, olives, melons, and other fruit, and drinking water he contrast between the men and the women, who are generally squat and dowdy figures, is so remarkable that they do not seem to belong to the same race The old vvomenwhositin the weekly bazaar to sell their home woven stuffs are hideous in a degree and variety which must be seen to be believed the inferiority of the female type described by some medical theorists to poor food, early child bearing and long nursing of children, house drudgery, and field work, but she causes do not operate in Cyprus alone, and although they may explain a large number of cases, they cannot be considered to account for all that we see amongst the Cypriots The people are conscious of the fact, and when a remark was made to a wealthy native about the dearth of pretty faces, he said as a sort of excuse that the Turks about 20 years ago had taken away all the hand somest girls to Constantinople Occasionally very occasionally one sees a maiden graceful, tall, and lithe, whose purely Grecian head is adorned with a pair of Eastern eyes The children of both sexes are, when healthy, charmingly pretty from the age of four or five to eight or ten, but the vast majority are puny, pale, and unhealthy They are nursed too long my their mothers, and are then crammed with all sorts of unfit food, such as olives, cheese, be ins, Le , never getting milk or a farinaceous diet They suffer more than adults from malarious fever, and almost all are afflicted more or less with disease of the spleen It is difficult to understand how boys so weakly grow up to be such fine men, but no doubt the less fit do not survive They have no idea of personal cleanliness, so much that doctors find their patients so extremely dirty that they are obliged to make it a rule to give them no advice until they are washed The mode of life of the people is eminently conducive to fever and ague They live mostly on the ground, the children sit, lie, and play on it, the women squat to their work or open air cooking with the dog, cat, fowls, and donkey, on the court or enclosure which adjoins the house and serves as garden also 1 he earthen floor of the house is shared by the animals and insects, and is merely a portion of the enclosure in which it stands at the same time the ground is saturated with all the water that can be got from well or aqueduct, brought in by gutters which wind through the lane before the door It is difficult to imagine anything more drearily comfortlcBBS than this kind of existence, and the best that can be said is that in the torrid heat in which he passes most of the year the Cypriot craves for the shade and fruit of his few trees, and finds the damp ground grateful and cool Thus he has a green garden and ague with a rickety and fever stricken progeny When wet and winter come, chattering and shivering with cold he hides in the house or towers over a brazier On one of those bitter days when the whistling, snow laden Bora tears across from the Black Range of KIranian, the bazaar shuts up, and all the shopkeepers go to bed he Cypriot hath no music in his soul All his little remaining desire for rhythm seems to have settled into his feet and he dances furiously until exhausted a sort of jig to the endless repetition of a few nondescript monotonous bars of rapid notes He takes his recreation in companies, and as he jumps gives short excited yells of satisfaction He will dance and drink wine or mastic all night, and go away making the morn hideous with his howling The noise of music to which he jumps is chiefly produced by scraping one-the treble-string of a little fiddle with great rapidity, and has to all appearances been learned from the mosquito, which it mimics with considerable accuracy The fiddle is generally accompanied by the bom don of a zither, which copies well the wearing screech of the deal when the native Greek breaks into song be produceR a brief nasal drone, whose melancholy sound is often repeated The boys never whistle , but the children, chiefly the girls, from time to time, with a voice from the head and nose, produce a short time which never exceeded two or three bars With all this they have a wondrous lungs The men will send their dear voices ringing through the pure dry air,acrossacountryaide,inthoatreots London the roads they converse, preferably, it would almost seem, from a distance in loud tones When on fine evenings-and all evenings are fine in Cyprus for months together whole families are in the lanes outside their doors, they do not take the trouble to move in order to visit their neighbours, but shout to them with shrill distinctness as they Bit The result is a babel of noise, for all about together four or five women meeting in the street all talk to each other at the top of their voices at the same time, the parties to a case in court, no matter how many they are all talk together, and it is impossible to silence them But perhaps the worst plague is a quiet street with two or three parties of boys playing games in the dust , they every one well continuously at the full pitch of their lungs, until the brain wanders and deafness would be a welcomed relief The conduct and habits of the Turkish portion of the population are different in almost every respect. Even about the youngest TurkiSh Days there is an air of gravity as they play in the streets, and when, about the age of 10, they quit the harem and assume the ambush or as?, they become even more staid. The closely shut aspect of the Turkish houses makes their quarter of the town more secluded and quiet than the Greek. The house door gently opens, and a grave Turk, beads in hand, comes forth with measured steps to prayers at the mosque, or a small bevy of Turkish women, wrapped in the white sheets which give them the appearance of ghosts, glide in to pay visits Apart from these disturbance. there is scarcely anything to break the repose, unless it be a beggar who loudly reports at the gate some verses of the Koran until he gets his arms of food The Turks are always well, if not richly dressed, and their type and gait are dignified and stately compared to the more rapid Greeks and besides they are clean, and in this contrast even more strikingly with. them. a
