THE YANYARRIE GHOST. [By Matilda H. Berryman, Mallee Vale, Port Lincoln.! Thou unwelcome visitant of ghostly form, S ast thou mistook thy way ? Why travel here ? Bow dare thou wonder forth and give alarm ? Thou knoweBt well this world is not thy sphere. Ah, no, it is not thus, but man's weak brain, Deluded by a sinful heart within, Bath conjured up thy presence and retained, As in the days of old, a lore for ghostly things. I would not own for friend the man who thinks That spirits severed from the mortal clay Can e'er return to visit us again. The gulf is fixed, and they have passed away. Are they not kept by one who holds the etars, the moon, The land, the seas, and tempest in His hand, Who rules the spirit world, makeB morn and noon Obedient to his omnipotent command 1 And shall He not departed Hpirits guide Unto their final resting-place, where they Henceforth in safety sleep, nor e'er awake . Until all earthly things are passed away 1 There let them rest, no mortal can explore The spirit's region, nor Its movements trace; Nor should we wish to do, but evermore Heep each our own appointed time and place.
