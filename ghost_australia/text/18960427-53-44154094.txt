: J;BÍHi A; Ti C. KACÉS. Tlic Club's Inaugural Meeting. ^BÉinks'wmbhw.cqnid hardly be conceived than that.: which at from midday to 2.30 o'clock induced a very fair crowd to proceed to the: Recreation Association's ground for the purpose of taking part in the inaugural meeting of the Broken Hill Amateur Turf Club.

Mr. J. Souter was judge, Mr. Bromley starter, Mr. Player clerk of the course, and Mr. Megaw clerk of the scales ; while as secretary Mr. "Tom" Tait was an exceedingly hard worker, both before and during the meeting.
