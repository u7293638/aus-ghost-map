THE SHIFTING SCENE. A NIGHT IN- BOHEMIA. By WAMBA. What a magic is there not in the word ' what a host of mosnorioR come trooping unbidden at its Tory utterance ' how easily the congenial spirit conjures from the familiar shades "'hosts of the dead gumlu who at one time trod the enchanted pavements of Bohemia, making Olympian laughter or (Eulong from the deep heart of Tragedy no loss god like tears Policmin ' Who does not rest intly think of the bright things *' done at the Mermaid," of " souls of poets dead and gone " of Johnson when he cried to Benuclerk, " "Who's for a frolic i ' of tim Cider Cellar of a hundred cherished reminiscences when the wine still glowed red in the goblet, and was dom and wit fell in such glittering showers from the lips of departed heroes that their words here how can one forbear to quote '2 Master Francis Beaumont" - So nimble and so full of subtle fl ime AH if that even out from whence they came, JTn I meant to put his whole wit in a jest, And had he owed to Ino a fool the rest Of his dull lift Something like this I endeavoured to propound to Stubbs when he said to me one oxtmug-wo had just left the, music hall-" Why don't you go in for a Bohemian life * " He listened a little impatiently I thought, to my rhapsody, and did not allow me to quite finish " Oh that's all right," he said, "about the "Mermaid-a very good sort of put of it's kind, Ive no doubt, though a bit before my time we meet at the Golden Bottle now Do you like follows of genius 2 Because, if so he went on without giving me a chance to answer, "I can introduce you to as eley or a set of professional men as can be found my where Moreover," he went on there is no side about 'em and if an outsider like you comes along, they'll boas fine and pleasant with by 011 as they would be with myself AU you've got to be is a good fellow." I found time here to say that I simply lived to meet men of genius It was true that I had only met one man of genius (besides Stubbs) in my life, and he had borrowed money from me I did not mention the, fact to Stubbs besides, he broke inhere " I say, just give me a couple of half crowns will you, till to morrow I must be off to the office of To morrow night, at the Golden Bottle, then, at 11 " "A little late," I ventured to suggest," but I could have kicked myself in mediately afterwards "Late," he exclaimed indignantly, "you don't expect us to keep the hours of shop boys or clerks, do you?" and he turned on his heel haughtily As I yy one home I kicked myself again "You couldn't expect them to be like shop boys or clerks," I kept saying to myself Fancy Shakespeare rushing ploughing street to catch his tram, or Byron leaving congenial company because it was 11 o'clock How Stubbs must despise me, I thought I was there punctually at 11 o'clock the next evening. The Golden Bottle seemed a sin little hotel in a shy little street but then, I reflected, it is one of the most priceless gifts of the artistic temperament that it can so easily soar above its environments The prince in his palace is often miserably with his dull round of sordid and meaningless responsibilities, but the man of ideas is a world unto himself I mentioned this to Stubbs, who e line up at this moment but he only said quickly Lets get in now, I holley 0 Olcogrnphtui will be here to night " I really did not care to all who Olcograplnui was, but Stubbs saved me the trouble " I don't care much about those artist chaps as a rule," he said butOlco orphan s an exception He can tell you stones in half a dozen languages, and has probably the best painter of Roads living ' By this time we had reached a dim room at the end of the passage which cut through the bar As M 0 M cut along a mottled see men in shirt sleeves had returned Stubbs's greeting with a " Hulloa, Wire " a saint ion I thought a little too familiar from 11 host even to a Bohemian But when we were seated Stubbs explained this he seemed to dry mo me in) 0 my thoughts "We treat Chuckster," he said, as one of ourselves 3 you've no idea what a thorough Bohemian he is Oh, by the way, Wamba," ns Chuckster appeared in the doorway), "I think you had better order something till the boys come along It's usual " I ordered, and presently two pewter pots were placed before us As Chuckster left the room he said, " I suppose some of the others are coming along, because it not good enough to burn gas for nothing OF " and Stubbs confidently, " they'll be along directly " I found that he was as good as his word in this respect at least Within a quarter of an hour there must have been at least 20 men present As they came in they mostly bestow ed familiar greetings on Stubbs, and that gifted Bohemian was good enough to say come very id little character sketches of each But before he could give me a complete summary of the eminent persons present I put my foot in it again The first man who came Stubbs whispered was " Cutter, the sculptor Stubbs hadnyyavof putting the before his friends' names in a manner that shut out all other sculptors, artists poets, writers It was infinitely impressive at first, though I found out afterwards that Cutter was a drunken stone mason chronically out of work Well, when Cutter came up Stubbs waited his hand in a lofty manner and said, " Tom us ' Cutter accepted the invitation with extreme alacrity and I paid Then Ulligy the painter came in and " joined " us-and little Sqmrb the flageolet player and Mobbs the famous singer and several more they all joined at once It was this that led to the little rupture before referred to I said to Stubbs, "Look here, old man, lay o got to go through the week (it was only Tuesday) on about 15s, and Sqmrb and Mobbs have just ordered cigars with theirs and-' He grew quite nasty at once " Oh, of course," he said, "if you want to do it like one of those confounded bagmen I'll say) no more It's the rule here that the man who first calls for drink pays for the round, but if you're so economical as oil that-" "Well," I put it hotel), " why couldn't you have told me that or called yourself ? " " And you want to see Bohemia," he retorted in a withering tone I felt a little crestfallen at tins, and murmured apologetic all), " Well, you know "Wnxoy and Stiokit "-this is the name of the eminent firm for which I work as clerk " don't do it too fat " " All right, old boy," he replied, " I understand But here comes Oloo graphing , no) word, we are in luck " oleographs "joined" us without a protest (or invitation) from me " Old Glory," chuckled Stubbs, " does it all like me Emperor "I don't know what he meant uni) I wished that em- perors would pay for their own beer Also, home how, I did not "feel" that profound v veneration for Stubbs that had originally possessed me It seemed to be slipping away in spite of myself But by this time the " joining " process was over and we were split up in groups oleographs had taken possession of an armchair and with his legs sprawled on a table in front of him was talk- ing in a very loud voice to Cutter They had filled upon their own account it seemed that you only " joined " at the first go off-and with a stranger Both Olcographim and Cutter were talking very fast and loud, though the great painter seemed to carry the heavier metal I listened with all my might " Millais ' " he said, in tones of scathing contempt, " a fraud A pretty manager and a brush like a navvy's tread And the man was making soon a year if he was making a penny) " " By Jove," whispered Stubbs to me, he trees t spare them A big name is nothing to Oleographini But this is good business Chrenco Meggs is going to taken hand ' As he spoke a long disjointed man strode across the room He seemed to convey the general impression of a bitter antagonist to Reap I said to Stubbs, " Who a Meggs ? " What he unclaimed incredulously, " don't you know Meggs ?" " No, I answered, feeling a secret exultation, J. do not know Meggs " Stubbs cart his eyes up to the ceiling as he had met with a freak of nature Then he said, " Well, Meggs is only the first journalist living, that's all " My interest revived at once I take a great interest in journalism, and have once or twice Bttomptod some little things of my own " Which of the papers does he is ripe for ?" I asked " My word," said Stubbs, bitterly, " you are green and no mistake Meggs don't write for any of the local papers , you don't think he's a penny a liner for rags, do you ?" As I have said I have a great respect for journalism , besides, I got my billet at Waxey and Sticlcot's through an advertisement, and once when I sent in an article the editor returned it, saying that it was " full of promise, but more suitable to one of the English quarterlies " So I answered satirically), "Oh, I suppose Meggs is too good for Sydney " " Too good for S) dney," echoed Stubbs "Why, look here, old man, when Meggs was in London the lance offered him the salary of an ambassador to go on its staff and write decorator stuff , but not Meggs, Moggs isn't made to be tied to the wheel of mi) daily rag, no matter what it's circulation But just hear him talk, then you'll realise what Meggs is " I listened to Moggs It was something like this "Well, chaps, whose shout is tiresome ou, Cutter now, none of your shilling Mil less, did I hear you talk of Millais ? Whew ' there's a rotter for You When I was in London I said to Buckleboo running that Times rag, you know I Bald, ' Look here, Buckle, why don't you have your art work done properly) - independent and slashing ? ' " " And what did he say ? " interposed Cutter " Oh, shut up, Cutter, do," was Moggs's reply Then he went on " The fact is, there are only two or three follows living who know anything about art and chain, or and for that matter " "Except yourself," said Cutter, and Oleographim sniggered They didn't seem to hold Meggs in the same esteem a s Stubbs But Stubbs was invincible in his resource "Let's look round the room, and I'll tell you somothînÇ-nbout the others By the way, I think it's about time we had a tiddly " Indeed, it seemed time, for at this moment huckster appeared in the doorway, and shouted, " Now, then, boorers, give, it a name "I think," said Stubbs, v I'll go across and join Prig, the poet, and his set " As we stood up to go, I had a look round the room Itwnsheavv with tobacco fumes, and everyone seemed to be talking and smoking, and lifting power posts as fast as possible I began to feel very giddy and confused, too I had treated Stubbs several times on the disjointed principle, and, moreover, n resentment was growing in my heart towards the company generally I said to Stubbs a little menacingly, " Is he a real poet ?" " What are you giving us 9 " responded Stubbs, and led the way across the room I found myself next to Prig, who w vi with three others They all "joined" at once, after which Prig said to me, " Lverdononuything in my way I " This mollified me-it was no window lodgment of equality, and I said, " Once to the Dimboola Manner I sent a sonnet " Prig uumolhfkd me at once " The Duntloola Jiaimrr," he repeated "What do you think of this " And he began - seraph of Heaven too gentle to be human, % ceiling beneath that radiant form of woman All that IN insupportable in thee Of light and lev e and immortality I He paused here, and I said, with forced calmness "You wrote those lines F" "Wrote them?" he said, " of course I did Thoywcre on the death of an aunt of mine, a woman we all thought a lot of and" I did not give him time to finish I stood up I was excited, though apparently self-controlled I said, Brig, on are an abominable liar, the lines are Shelley's " and as a silence fell on the room I turned on Oleographim and continued, " As for that greasy humbug-" but here there was a great hubbub and Cutter's voice was heard exclaiming, " Punch his head," although he did not make the slightest effort to carry out that benevolent effort in sculpture I was about to go on when a BOAC grip was placed under my armpit, at the same time it seemed to lift and bear me away It was Chuckster, who said, " We can't have no rows hero, sir I think you've and enough " As I left Stubbs said, " Cid, you've disgraced my " I turned on him furiously and cried out, "You pay me that 37s 6d you owe me-" but Chuckflter gold) here no envy yards and outwards On the pavement outside I soon recovered in) soil, and presently a man issued from the hotel I recognised him as one of the Bohemians who had attracted my attention when first I entered the room. He had kept almost entirely to himself, and had never " joined " " Pretty sick of those pretenders," be sold "Oh," lend sneeringly, I suppose you re the greatest artist or journalist or something in the world " " Not at all," he returned , " I expect I'm like yourself just attracted there by curiosity " " Curiosity)," I retorted, " I wanted to see some men of genius in Bohemia " " Oh, Bohemia," he laughed back, Bohemia, you'll find what we've just seen in every great city Clay masquerading as gold incompetent boo?) pretentiousness affecting to be talent hopeless failures, deservedly so, ageing and attacking their betters-" "Well," I interrupted, sulkily, "I don't want a sermon I suppose there is a Bohemia " "Yes," he said, " there is but it's not the sort of place ) you and I am be free of in an evening now Stubbs and his friends, with their shouts, In a blue moon When men of real i meat and kindred tastes find each other out they make a Bohemia for themselves, but the most confirmed Bohemian may be sober and the most gifted artist or author clean Good night " » . . * . When I went into Wnxoy and Stiokit's in the morning I felt extremely seedy, and I elamang looked it, for a young fellow called Babbage said to me at lunch hour, " Halloa, Wimba, not going out to grub I suppose you've o been keeping it up with your literary friends "-I had mentioned something about the company I was to meet to my fellow clerks " Well, old follow, he went on, " I can sympathise with you, for we had a pretty yy arm time at the rowing social ourselves last evening But, of course, if a chap's a good cook" and hero he smacked his chest, which is very fine and prominent and sounded like a big bass drum-" he can soon quill himself together, and I've got a twist on me like a horse," and he clattered out It was no use being sarcastic with Babbage, he was one of those fellows who laughed and worked if you spoke to him about part of the return, and would probably answer, " That was a good bit in Funny Folks ' " But in the evening, when the time came for us to leave off, I went up to him and said, " Look here, Babbage, how much does it cost to join that rowing club of yours r" He grows enthusiastic at once " I know you'd get sick," he cried delightedly, of all that rot you are always talking about criticism and the higher culture You haven't got much of a chest now and he began to prod me alloy or, not knowing how much he hurt me, for Babbage has an arm on him like a blacksmith but we'll soon back you into shape Come down a to the shed now " * . a a I've given up Bohemianism I pulled No 3 in the junior fours The 37s 6d with Stubbs had to be Written off
