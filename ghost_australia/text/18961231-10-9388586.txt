KINGBOROUGH ELECTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HEBODET. 8min see by your paper some time ago that Dr. E. L. Crowther announced himself as a candidate for the Kingborough district. Now, if the doctor would take a friend's advice he will not come here as a candidate, for his past' career has not advance him in the estimation of the electors, and the combat is so well defined between the little Captain and R. J. Lucas that any other man that may come now will not be likely to got ten votes in this part of the district. I would advise the doctor to go for that part of Hobart where the hospital is to be seen to or where there may be a ghost to I be caught yours, etc., ELECtOR. Port Cygnet, December 29.
