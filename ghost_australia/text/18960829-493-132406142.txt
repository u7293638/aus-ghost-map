' POETRY. WHITBY ABBEY. Is this the ancient ' Beacon Bay . Whence twelve dim centuries ago, O'er wintry sea and moor and snow, The Abbey shod its guiding ray ? Is this the spot, tho hallowed site, Where Hilda ruled and righted wrong, Poorlmnn nn.ni? his heavenly BOW!. Born of a vision of tho night ? Amid the change mere living brings, Amid theBO ruins of the years, Here surely one can feel the tearsâ€” _ Tho slow, dumb tears of mortal thing?; Oh, scone of beauty, wrecked, undone, Small wonder men should still declare That Hilda's presence lingers there, A Borrowing ghost in mist and sun.
