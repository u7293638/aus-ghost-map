The country has had much experience of the latter as Attorney-General and manipulator of Crown lands prosecutions, and it is so entirely satisfied of his cleverness, that it does not want any more of him. With these gentlemen are associated some others who have made the grave mistake of getting into such very undesirable company, and who must take the conse- quences. The policy of the Ministry, as declared by themselves in the first in- stance, is deemed bad and insufficient. They have been trying to add to and amend it at every opportunity, and have only succeeded in making it vague and unintelligible to everybody, except those who understand that for so much support so much will be given, and on this basis they are a Liberal Ministry indeed. Eut this perpetuation of a system of buying and bribing, so ably exposed and de- nounced by the lion, member for the Kennedy last night, is precisely what the supporters of the vote of want of confi- dence desire to put an end to. Xobod}' doubts that, were their oppo- sition to be withdrawn, a majority at least of the present holders of office would be found impressionable as wax and scpieezable as a sponge; but it is the weakness and corruption which these very characteristics imply which consti- tute tile most fatal objection to them. They had no policy worthy the name to begin with, they merely took up the soiled and tattered garments of their predecessors ; tried to put on a patch here and to rub off a smudge there, and then strut as if fresh elad from heel to headpiece. Now they have a policy, or will take a piece to make up one from whoever insists on their compliance, and can help them to a vote at the same time. But this is neither honest nor able administration. In both qualities it is so lamentably defi- cient that to tolerate it on any pretence would be a political mistake, so the sooner hon. members like Mr. TVREL understand that as being neither capable nor trustworthy it must go, and help to clear it out of the road, the better it will be for that progress of the public business which they so much desire, but at present are doing so little to expedite. IT was known some time ago that Mr. HEKEY STANLEY, Chief Engineer on our Southern and Western Railway, had, at the request of the Tasmanian Government, been permitted to act as one of a board, composed of engineers from the different Australian colonies, to examine and report upon the condition of the Main Line Railway. This line, which connects Hobart Town with Launceston, has been constructed for the Tasmanian Govern- ment by an English company under a lump sura contract, and the matter in dispute is whether the company have satisfactorily performed their part and can claim payment. In the performance of the duty for which he was appointed, Mr. STANLEY was associated with Mr. MAIS, the Chief Engineer of South Australia, and Mr. MASON, the Assistant-Engineer in-Chief of New South Wales. The report of these gentlemen now lies before us, and the revelations contained in it are of a most striking and sensa- tional character, and calculated to astonish the Tasmanians if they ever supposed that their railway enterprises were likely to be carried out more successfully and economically than those of their sister colonies. The Board of Enquiry in this case had no such matters submitted to them as Mr. WATSOX'S opinion was asked upon when he paid us a visit. There was no question as to whether the proper route had been chosen, as to whether the cost of construction was excessive or not, the only question they had to decide was whether the works had been properly carried out, whether what could be considered a railway had been constructed or not. The report, there- fore, is simply a record of the finding of the engineers on this question. They examine all the separate details of con- struction one by one, and in nearly every case their decision is against the contractor. We cannot afford space for a recapitulation of the faults found to exist in all the minor details, such as clearing, fencing, drain- age, «fcc. We pass them over as of small account, and come to more im- portant works. Under the head of " Viaducts and Bridges," the report says : " Tt appeara to us in many cases that the foundations are of a doubtful nature, not being of sufficient depth, especially in places subject to high floods. Several of the abutments, wings, ifcc, are cracked, but not of a very serious kind, except tho south stone abutment to the viaduct over the river Derwent, which has sunk bodily towards the embankment about 1 in 30, causing a short incline at end of viaduct. " Where timber piles have been used, thoy are in many cases insufficiently braced, and in some cases not braced at al!. For instance, the whole of the land openings in tho Clarendon viaduct, which is about 30 feet high, have no braces to the piles, and, therefore, nothing to resist the lateral pressure except the rigidity of the piles, which is, we con- sider, very insufficient. " The whole of the timber in the super- structures is of an inferior kind, and un snited to the purposes to which it is applied ; and although there is at present an abundance of strength, owing to the large scantling and quantity of the timber used, the structures cannot be considered as sound and permanent, as the timber has, in nearly every instance, split both vertically and horizontally in a very serious way, calculated to considerably reduce Ux strength, especially when we take into consideration the inferior workmanship throughout and the neglected state of re- pair in which we found these viaducts. The majority of the bolts in all the bridges and viaducts required 'screwing up,' and a very large proportion of them had the appearance of never having been touched since they were originally put in. At the date of our inspection we found thom, in this respect, in a most deplorable condition of disrepair and neglect. "The ¡ron ' swing bridge1 in the viaduct over tho river Derwent requires special notice. The lattice tension bars are too small in sectional area, consequently have becoino ' buckled ' with tho weights pass mg o\ er the bridge , the top and bottom booms »eera strong enough, but owing to the light bracing the bridge has been ' crippled ' The insecure manner in which the pile abutments are formed foi the support of the budge, and the way in which it rests-or rather on one side does not lest at all-upon the abutment plate, is much to be condemned, the incoii ?renient wa) of hauug to take off the n\h plate-» and put them on again erny time the budge îequires to be opened is, in our opinion, \erj uusatisfactoi) , in fact, the conjunction of the bridge abutments is of auch a natuie as to requne îeconstruc tion nid w e doubt v> hethei any officer of the Boaid of Ti ade would attempt to examine it in its present state, much less pi-«-, it foi public tnfhc Luder the head of cuheits, both the quality of the matenal used and the mannei m winch it has been used are condemned, and several defects requiring attention aie mentioned, onie of the le^el closings aie mfeuor and of a temporaiy kind, and some ?station buildings are unsubstantial and not of a permanent character The ballast is of all kind» of material, c'a), sand, m ul, gravel, loam, and stone, the stone broken to no regular gauge, and the good and bad mateml in some places so mixed together as to render useless e\ en that which m itself wa-, good Some of the sleepers are of " doubtful character and not in accordance w ith the contract Some of the rails, " those branded IbR, aie infeiioi, ' and judging fiom the in stances mentioned bj the engineers, must much resemble those which weie shipped to us for our northern line, and condemned by Mr BA.LH.RD It is satisfactory to learn that English manufacturers ha\e other markets for their îefuse besides Queensland In laj ing the rails, greater carelessness seems to have been show n than in an) other portion of the work, they were laid to any gauge that came hand), in some of the curves the gauge being ueaily two inches wide »Straight rails weie laid in cur\es without having been previously bent, and the engineers found it impossible to decide what amount of superele\ation had originally been given to the outside rail in curves, at the time of their inspec tion they found m some curves none, and in others nearly three inches and a half In consequence of all these defects, they report that the road is m a \ erj " crippled state, full of " slacks," and m consequence ?\ery knott), numerous joints reqiure " screw ing up' -being allow ed to go slack they have occasioned abrupt joints in the rails-" These, together with the bulged and broken rails, which we found in the road, render the hue unfit to tra\ el over at the time table speeds " There are three classes of engines used on the line, of which two arc condemned as too heavy for the 40 lb rails used, and the springs of the passenger carnages are also found faulty The pnnision foi cairjmg off flood waters is declared m many places to be insufficient, and that the hue is therefore hable to destruction or damage in those place«, and it is stated that at one place, " Antill Ponds Creek," the line has been formed foi some distance dow n the bed of the creek, the w aters of w Inch are dn erted on each side of the embankment, and have airead) commenced to wash it aw a) Finally, the) sa\, "We aie of opinion that the speed stated in the time table, at which the expiess trains aie mu, is ier) excessi\e, and in the pieoent condition of the permanent w îy dangerous "It may be stated, in iepl) to tim opinion, that the speed of the time table is actually accomplished daily This fact c innot be denied, but the wisdom of ti y ing such a duigeious expeiiment m the piesent condition of the linois, m oin opinion, \er) questionable ' " After a full and careful examination and consideration of the whole subject in all its beal nigs, we are unanimously of opinion that the general conditions of the contract, as far as the constiuction and maintenance of the line is concei ned, hi\e not been complied with It would be difficult to frame a more complete condemnation of an) piece of work than this report, and coming from com potent men unconnected w ith the people or the colon) interested, it must carry with it the com îctioji that the Tasmanian» ha\e bfen shaniefull)
