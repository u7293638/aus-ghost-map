! ' M.T.C. Rabc Meeting. , Attbr the sudden, and very copious downfall of rain which visited this district on^'Monday and Tuesday last, Weduesday morning ibroke bright, and clear,- A south- westerly wind; and a' clear sky proclaimed it a racing morning. At the same time, those whose anxiety abont the weather, brought them from 'their beds at ah uniisnalljr early j]our were compelled to acknowledge/ with many a shiver, and ;much tooth chattering, that- it was confoundedly cold. Various hotelkeepers who do not open at six o'clock camo in for some remarks- which were certainly, not blessings. Those who were op. early on account of having business oh the course were inclined to I feel rather annoyed at the unwonted amoont of early patronage; they received, which interfered with their prepara tions. At a very early hour tho exodus of the lessees and -.those engaged in their service commenced, and about half past | ' six Old Knrr was heard proclaiming the sale of thev 14 Correct card of (races.' Then caino a cfowd of men 'carrying mysterious (look ing burdens . of boxes,' tables, and bandies, which might assume many shapes, bat which' it required nd wizard to pronounce to be sundry kinds of Implements for swindlingltho would be clever members ofl the community. | 'We have seldom 'seen the | members of the! card sharping' confraternity , muster in larger num bers than they diil oh the present occasion, although their devices for money making presented no features .of especial ''novelty. Gradually, after breakfast every conceivable kind of vehicle in town, even to drays and springcarts, were pat into requisition to enable all Mackay and his wife to go to the races, besides which every, sort of horse was being ridden. Some idex'ofithe number, of people whoj visited the' race course may be learnt frem the fact that the lessee of the gates paid £14Iforthe lease and realised a haodsomeprofit on his veiitnro. This lis evidence , of thoifact thatabout 2,890peeplc, if not more, must have attended.! They can't beaLthat insome towns twice the size of Mackay, . Lessees of booths also iexpresa- themselves ' as being mo'st1 uncommonly- well phased with the busi ness'; they have done,' and yet we never saw in the colony a more ordprly meeting/ We did not notice moro th'an one or two cases of [downright drunkenness/ and people showing eveq incipient signs of -intoxication were rare. There was not the ghost of a fight or a row to bo. seen all the time. The arrangements made by the Stewards were ;very -complete. The Grand Stand is a most commodious one, land was ivery well patronised. „ We have a vory distinct recollection of some grand stands in the colony, showing but a beggarly array of empty benches. The scene on the conrso, and inside the sacred enclosure was very gav. There - were an nnuBually large number of ladies and children present, . and their bright dresses added light and color to the scejie, while, under the supervision of the officers of tho Club, not the slightest' 'approach to an accident occurred. The course was in splendid orper, and the arrangement of the booths was such ns to permit a consider able assemblage of people in a placo favorable fijr seeing the races. Even the conventional dog seemed to be seen afar off by the ubiquitous Clerk of the Course, and his splendidly mani pulated stockwhip soon cleared him out. ; In. short, so far as the' conduct of mattors on the' race, conrso' was concerned,, nothing conld be more perfect. A small force of police under Senior Sergeant Brannelly rendered efficiont service in keeping the course, although, fortunately their task in the tnaintouanco of law aim oruar .was a uinecure.
