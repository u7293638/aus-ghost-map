It is so light, so gentle, so escaping from the idea of death, that with the lock of hair belonging to a child or friend, we may almost look up to heaven, and compare notes with the angelic nature; may almost say, "I have a piece of thee here, not unworthy of thy being now." \--Leigh Hunt.

"Last night," replied the man, "I was pass ing the church, and up against the wall of it did I behold the spectre l" "In what shape did it appear '" asked the priest.
