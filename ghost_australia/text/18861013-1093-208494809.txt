CAULFIELD TRAINING NOTES. [By Telegraph ] Melbourne, October 12. Ken Bolt started on a mile and a half journey, old Chuckster bringing him along the last seven furloDgs. The son of Newbold moved free and well, but the time made was not extra good. Silvermine traversed a round on the course proper in a very taking style, The Chanter acting as schoolmaster for the first part of the journey, and Sirocco at the latter end. Bonnie Doon put in a strong circle on the grass alone. Millstream negotiated a loDg gallop, having The .Crane and The Ghost to assist him. Tie son of The Diver, having Gorry in the saddle, with whip and spurs on, sweated rather freely at the finish. Gadfly seemed as if she could have ran over Grace Darling in a milespin, but she bad apparently a lot the best of the weights. Umberto trotted and cantered. .New York and Bohemian were dispatched for a good useful gallop of a mile and a half, the pair, with light weights up, finishing together, Naboclish was treated to a round over the schooling fences, hitting one or two of them, rather hard.
