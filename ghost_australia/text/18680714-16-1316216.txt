PRUSSIAN CONSULATE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. Sir-My attention having been drawn to an advertisement appearing in your issue of the 3rd and It is instant, referring to claims against " Count Von Attems, or his schooner Hamlet's Ghost," I should like to know in what way the Count Von Attems, or Hamlet's Ghost, are connected with the Prussian Consulate ? Taking it for granted that this novel basement originated from the Prussian Consul, not having seen it contradicted, I naturally come to the conclusion that the Prussian Consulate is acting as agent for a party (not a Prussian) for tho purpose of checking his accounts for groceries, butcher's meat, and such like really see no other motive, and having always considers of the duties of a Consul to be of a quite different nature, I publish those lines, hoping somebody will be able to solve the question at issue satisfactory By inserting this you will oblige A PRUSSIAN.
