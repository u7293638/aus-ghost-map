My senses deserted me, and they, took; me to my desolate home unconscious. There! opened my eyes upon the faces of iimy'' sister-in-law and her two brothers — they horrified me. In their expression I read no real grief— only affectation of it. They had descended on the place like harpies, hoping to profit by their brother's death. They began their attack at once. On the morning before the funeral, the elder of the men, William, came to me as my servant was. clothing me in my black garments, and .without waiting to dismiss the girl, stood be fore me, his fingers interlaced and his thumbs pressed together in a fashion all his own, and enquired : — 'Well, now, what are you going to doP ?To do?1 said I., ?I, don'k know what you mean.' -' *? ?You've got to go somewhere you know,' said my brother-iu-law, \ ? you night as well think of it.' \- This is no time to talk to me,' said I. ' I hope I shall go into my grave. How can I live without my husband ? Oh, Charles my darling 1 Oh, Charles my darling 1 ? Anyhow/ said Willliam, 'you can't come downstairs ; the men folks will be enough. . Sister Ann will stay with you, not to be too pointed — but considering you can't appear.' 'I will make an effort,' said I, thinking that after all he had only expressed consideration for my health in an awkward manner. ? 'We can't disgrace the family at such a time,' said William. 'We've always beeii respectable.; ; The kind, of relation there* has been 'between you and him were his affairs while he lived, how they're Our.' / ,.-'{! ' What do'yoU; mean 7 I gasped.

And with these words he tendered' me a large roll of bank-notes. As he ceased, I rose in my wrath and flung the money back into his face r i. ? Man.'

Oh, my husband— my husband — where are you 1 — where are you? Oh, my love, can you not come back to me?' And to this wild cry — ticry that mournnrs utter so often in the madness ' of their despair — an answer came — -a ringing ' I am here I' in a voice we all' knew. A tall figure dashed through the open door of the great hall and stood before us — Charles Chester and no other,. ? ? ...„ ? . He stood motionless — one arm up-' lifted and drawn back, and the other' pointing towards his brother William. And at the presence of the man they believed to be lying in his grave — of. of she ghost evoked by my prayer— abjeot terror fell upon them. Wil liam stink upon his knees ; James, in ' his flight, fall over him and sprawled upon the carpat ; Ann went into' hysterics, but the little children at my side knew no fear. They rushed to wards him ; clasping him by the arms crying gleefully: 'Papa is not dead any longer. Papa has come back!' And as his arms encircled me I felt that he had come Pbdck indeed — whence and how I staroely asked my self. ,£ He was there. I, his beloved wife, wai in his anus. My woe had changed tojoy. This was what he told me (after wards. While I was from home a telegram reached him whieh rendered his pre sence in a mining district at a great distance imperative. He could not await my return, but wrote a letter to me explaining the matter, which he laid upon my desk. Meanwhile cer tain work remained unfinished in the laboratory, and the only man he knew in whose charge he dared to leave it was ad eccentric, old chemist of the, neighbourhood, who Jived by himself in an outof-the-way cottage, and was 'supposed to be endeavouring to in vent an elixir of life. To this man he ' sent, put matters in his charge, advised him to exchange his well-saved suit for the one which was, upon the body when discovered, and led to the bB- ] lief that it was that of Mr. Chester. In my utter misery I had not read any of my letters. That which he had left me, and those he had sent from the. mines, lay on my desk among the , unopened condolences *vhioh -I had ordered my servant to place there,- and only' when he arrived in his native town did he hear of the events which1 , had occurred there. ? . .. His wrath1 was .great, and his ven geance' might have -been terrible, for ^amongst them, his J relatives had de- : 'stroyed a will which he had made on the very day our first child was born.
