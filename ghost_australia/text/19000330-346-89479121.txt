MR. KIPLING AS A SPEAKER. It we may believe one o{ the audience at the Navy League meeting at Rottingdean whereat Mr. Kipling made a speech, that, author i-i not built t'ur an orator. "When," vtites his hearer, "lie showed face in the schoolroom-it was crowded - his Rottingdean neighbor? cheered him mightily, and he blushed like a great kid. When he got up on the platform to speak he was as white as a ghost. lie had evidently learned his little speech off by heart, and spun it out at a territic rate. Of course that was nervousness. It struck me thar he felt if he were to hesitate he would he lost. The Big J'.uglanders will never get Kipling as a platform sprinter. He'd collapse at the end of his third meeting. After he had done speaking he jumped off the platform, and for live minutes or so sat tidgeting in a chair; then suddenly he picked up his overcoat, slung it on his arm, and bolted from the schoolroom as if somebody had yelled 'The roofs giving way ! ' So he never hrard the professional Navy League lecturer and he didn't miss much. 1 should mention that, while making his speech, Kipling g-u'.ed fixedly over the heads of the audience at, a lantern stuck on the wall, and never moved either his head or hir hands. He spent'the afternoon decorating tho schoolroom with f:, bunting, etc., but I can't say much for- his decorative taste : tho stuff was strung acrois and across 111 the. crudest way- The Rotting dean folk seem to be very fond of him."
