POLITICAL. b Tunnew Miuldtry are fully itn poiver, and.; " have to uchiu`ve. their own reputation. ti Whilel-lere it every desire that' a'n op-' t (,portnity lshobld:: b h v'enit'the fredih'r'ds ' mministration t o:'carry but 'retrlnclinent' t and to restore the finm;nuced to a sbdInd basis, yet codfidence is withheld. This i0 In be attributed partly to tihe men and inrtly to the Nctslthut promises.mhve been C so frequently falsified and failure so often experienced. The'temper of the public wna manifested in very properly peuit ting every member of the Government that had to appeal to his constituents to be retirned without the ghost of opposi timn. Two Commissions have been appointed for, the north and south to enquire into the public departments and to see what can be done in the way of consoli daionri and reduction. This inquisition may prove a sham or a reality. On for mer occasions increased cost has been the result. The practical way to reduce departments is to estimate what the work shmotid be done for, and leave the respon sible head of the office to decide what shall be the number and salary of his subordinates. Parliament will meet on the 24th, but the session will be short. A ministerial statement will no doubt be made, in which it is to be hIoled tile principles of action will be distinctly stated, and the policy to be pursued outlined. A few unimportant `ills will probably be passed and thle Ministers will ask, not unreason ably, 'that the two houses should pass the estimates MAr six months from lst January. Parliament will then be pro rogued till May, which will give tihe Exe r cutive time to mrature their measures.
