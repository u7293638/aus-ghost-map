Adding to the Solemnity. Some local amateurs gave a performance of " Hamlet" one day last week. Gus De Smith was Hamlet. The day after the per formance Kosciusko Murphy met Gus and asked " How did the performance come off last night ?" "Everybody did well except old Dr. Pennybunker. I'll be dashed if hlie goes on the stagd with me any more. I'll take him and tie him on a railway line and let the train run over him before he shall play Ghost to my Hamlet any more." "Was he the Ghost ?'' "Yes, and the blooming old idiot stalked across the stage with his spectacle on. He made a circus of the whole show. If ever there was a melancholy Dane I was one. I haven't got over it. And the old graven image says he put on his specs to add to the solemnity of the scene,"
