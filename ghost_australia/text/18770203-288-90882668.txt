T The reader who has so patiently accom panied me thus far will have a pretty good guess as to what position I am likely to take up in regard to the so- called ' Spiri tualism.' Even at the time when the f ol krwino; incidents occurred, I had seen far too much of the 'behind-the-scenes' of life to feel even a moment's concern -or awe for this trumpery piece of quackery. Now, I am glad to say, the side -I take is to a great extent the popular one ; then, it was different. The thing was new — the rage — and every one was 'daft 'about it. Now, the woras 'spiritualistic medium,' with most people, are but another name for loafer, hungry trickster, juggler, or maniac; then, the most sacred names were heaped upon them with a cool blasphemy that was per fectly horrifying. One word more. This may meet the eye of a ' believer,' and he may scan the whole affair with a smile of pity, and account for the various hitches with that surprising ingenuity which has from the very first characterised his sect. Let him not sup pose — if his belief is sincere and disin terested — than I am laughing at him. We are not all. -made alike , in this world. I would hit the truth closer if I said, we are all made different ; and it is natural that many persons of a gentle, nervous disposi-* tion,~ who have had less knocking about thatr I, should take up different views and stick to them. Must. they,. 'therefore, ;be. called idiots and f ppls ?,..!. think not. We . are ' all rsuflieiently foolish . at times, without ^ making matters worse by heaping -names on/ e each other. ? ... Another thing let me remark to any one in doubt. Go to see any skilled conjurer perform; and then, after beholding how. eyes and ears may be deceived in the open blaze of light, do not -wonder at anything that can be done in the dark; ''','' Sometime after spirit rapping had been ; brought to this country,- and had spread rapidly — as popular manias generally do— the following telegram came in from Liver pool : — u David Fenier, alias the Rev. Brydohe Stone, calling himself a spiritualistic medium, has absconded from this city, after stabbing in three places a young man named Guthbert, wild lies in a critical state. Ferrier is a native of Edinburgh, and is believed to have gone northwards. Keeps sharp look-out for him. Description : of Ferrier — Age, about 45 ; height, 5 feet 10*, hair, sandy colored; fprehead,heayy, square, and broad; eyes, light blue/' with l the ileft squinting inwards. Desperate and reckless when enraged ; caution required rin his capture.' : This telegram set me a-thinldng. I had known a certain Da vie Ferrier some years., before — a man of slightly unsettled intet lect, having a religious turn, and also un- - fortunately, when irritated, . a turn for kmfeing. The man had given us trouble more than once, and rsmiled at' the thought of him perhaps turning up in this new guise. The description certeioly fitted Kim ' ?; toa hair4-of it were realty hJe, the Liver pool £taff showed' both acuteness ;^ and ; experience in. supposing that he had anade. for Ms native place. ? y. .?:??*,. \\- Nothing can be relied on with ''greater - certainty in the hunting of criminals:' If -a ; man has committed a desperate crime, and - has a native place at some distance, a hun-' : dred fiances to one he will turn his nose in . iliat ? direction. If an 1_ ^ctuiburgh /man : committed a murder in \ 'Australia'' -.-and t escaped, after a proper interval I jshould . look for him m^di^buigh. ' NotMng jcame- of it tilla week or two ; : after, when, os?er at the New Town I met a friend, who among bifter things spoke of spirit-rapping. . . ':? _?'? '? .

'^Indeed f Have you heard his name f^— ? wa& it anything like 'Brydone Stone f ', '! : ^Np; thatfs not' it.' I have it here, mitten do^^ThefBeT;^bs.?adley?-? ' What is he like in appearance ?— have you heard ?' My interest in spirit- rapping had increased wonderfully within a few moments. 'I have not heard decidedly — he is a venerable old man, with silky white hair and beard — that is all I know.' ' Do you pay anything to attend his mi nistrations?' 'Nothing, 11111688 you like. But there is a box, I believe, into which you may drop anything above a shilling, or less than half a-crown.' ' Could I go with you — I mean, without being known as a detective ? ' ' Certainly — there is nothing I would like better. ? This note of introduction will admit any number.' I looked at the note — a lithographed ircular— and then said, quietly — ' I will come, and perhaps, bring another with me. But, as the greatest favor you can confer on me, do not_ say a word of it to any one. He promised secresy, and we parted. I thought I would have some trouble to prime up McSweeny to accompany me'; but I 'was agreeably surprised to find that he treated the new spirit- rapping business as a wretched hoax. He believed as firmly as ever in spirits, apparitions, and ghouls — for which he had a dozen Irish names that were unintelligible to me — but he was firmly of opinion that they always came without ask ing, and generally when they were not wanted. The street lamps were already lit, and eight o'clock had rung in when we reached Duke Street. McSweeny's sister, Honor, who kept house. for him,' accompanied him, and iny friend of the morning accompanied me — perfectly unconscious, of course, that I had a doiible object in view in visitingthe medium. McSweeny and myself each carried a dark lantern, with prepared wicks, which could be lighted with, a touch without the noisy crackling of a match, and ourplan of action was fully laid down and understood. Our main object, of : course, was to discover whether the 'American clergyman' was not David Ferrier ; but as this might not be tasily managed, and any slip might end in our expulsion, we were both carefully dis guised, and it was- agreed that McSweeny was to be the simpleton, greedily believing everything, while I was to be merely an impartial enquirer, seeking to know more of the ' spirits' 'and their powers. As there was a chance of us being separated in 'the circle,' we had also agreed on a system of telegraphy— ^and thus 'I would like more light -m tfie subject,' and a number of other coninionplace phrases, had a meaning known only to ourselves. The house was a main-door one — a first class lodging-house of the kind, ticketed 'Apartments.' - . ; We rang, and enquired for the Rev. Thos. Padley, and were shown into a richlyfur nished parlor, along with a number of other visitors, to await the time and pleasure of the great oracle. It seemed to be the fashion with those present to converse in awe-stricken and subdued whispers, but McSweeny at once broke through 'the rule, and excited .some - undisguised . horror by... remarking, in his - loudest tones— - ' Arrah, sowl, but this place must cost Lini a purty penny in the week. All them pictur's an' curtains an' this beautiful soft carpet wasn't got fornothin'. See, Judy,. darlin'!'iie said, addressing his sister by.\ the name we had agreed on, 'he's got a kind of pobrs'-box'on the inahtelpieee ;' let's put in something- for luck,' and he :coolly strode forward and noisily dropped in a penny of the ' .'cart-wheel ' description, dear ?to schoolboys. j . : ; ; ! . Horror on the faces round him was now giving way, and a titter of amusement ran round the room. Watching the visitors ;closely, it gave me some relief to see that' lione seemed to take him for aught but the fussy and antiquated oldman he was made up for. He had determinedly refused to give up the great white ' ^at he -wore, and the heavy umbrella he carried under Ms arm, and nowhis apparent simplicity and openness were not fhe least effectual /parts of his disguise, Heiremoved the hat, and then concernedly began to tug at the white hair on his head. r Judy, darlin', is ine wig straight ? ;he asked, in the saine noisy tones, 'Sure the spirits 'ud take; offence if I went in afore them untidy. Me boots aren't the clanestj either ; but *twas them slasterirf roads that' did it. If yeVe a bit o' paiper Pll give them a nib down. WhateVjer will I do ?' he added, addressing; the7 company generally. 'Ye've mostly got. white gloves on, but sorry a pair 'ud ever go on my big fingers/' ~- Some one hastened to assure him that the' oversight was of no consequence whatever, and ;he appeared comforted. - : 'I ,' s'pose the r spirits don't wear them , themselves,' he : said, conclusively, 'an' they're soft wid other people. Saint Patrick ! there's a bell ringm* — what's that for ? It's a drop of whisky I could . take this minit, f or I'm. all over a twitteration, ', like the pig when his^ master, told ; him he .

' *' '.]..-. j '''/'. -'; ''^ ^'; 'S.,~'\,--: I was disappointed. .1 hadjhopei; hej! would speak., ., To me the Edinburgh accent.: ,is music, and I have -often astonished people* ;byf detecting- it, even when modified and /almost dissipated by time and change. ' - I seated/myself as yearly asfpbssible 6p ;posite the -^medium,' and by-and-bye, as my eyes; got accustomed -to the -dim' li^ht, I made ;out that he was dressed in clerical blacks, had Rowing' white hair arid beard, ? and wore a green shade over his eyes. He spoke at last, with a Yankee sneevle and drawl that was either veiy strong, or affected, and very much overdone. His, speech was pretty longj and not over intel ligijblej so ,1 have forgotten it, hut the»bulk of it lies; in these w'ords-r: ' .: 'We Americans, air a. tall people^-^we air sharp as the little end of nothing, and '^liek : as tlhe greased «nd of- lightning. The s^iritsTiave put their foot down on us, and 'gone the: big figure to show it. Sceptics;— miserable, ??. deeded, jsceptics^ — had tried, to crush tiie sacred doctrine,, but they found they iad; wbkeup the wrong passenger. ? If Siere were any sich present he'd advise .them ^d wake the back track, and not disturb the circle with their all-fired unbe lief. It would be better for 'em, if they did, 'cause the sjiirits were apt to get riled when crossed — right- down savage as a meat axe: He'd kno-wn a big loo-table, half a ton weight, lifted right up and brought ker-flop down on the heads of sich.' He paused, and a terrified murmur ran round the room to the effect that every one present believed firmly in the doctrine he represented and expounded. McSweeney even went the length of assuring him that he believed not only in the 'spirits,' but in everything else. I remained silent. I was trying to determine whether the cleverly disguised voice of the 'medium' had not an Edinburgh accent. The speaker resumed, more cheerfully— 'P'raps some here are still on the fence, and don't know which side to take. These air honest, and may keep a stiff upper lip. The spirits air nuts on sich, and show 'em wonders. I hope they'll do so to-night.' 'I hope so, too/' volunteered McSweeny, with a face as long as Leith Walk. The ' circle ' tittered ; but a fierce ges ture from the wearer of the green shade instantly silenced them. McSweeny's face might have been made of -cast-iron, so im movable did every line of simplicity and gravity remain. ' The spirits don't like laffture,' said the 'Medium,' rather snappishly. ^People -who come here for that -will find it a blue fizzle,' and he looked searchingly across at McSweeny. 'That's true,' acquiesced McSweeny, with a grave nod. 'I don't know what a blue fizzle means, but I lmbw it's true.' I was keenly on the alert, and beginning to get excited. In the momentary impa tience the ' Medium' had slightly forgotten himself, and dropped the nasal twang. He glared for a moment at McSweeny ; but, like hundreds before him, made nothing of the simple face ; and abruptly resumed his discourse. ;'I guess we'll begin now,' he said, ' but if there's any ter- aitor here let ine warn him once more to look out for fits. In the fust place we'll turn down the light, 'cause the spirits don't like light.' The light was accordingly turned down, till we were in all but complete darkness. After ; manipulating our hands on the table according to his direction. we waited impatiently for some minutes, when sud denly the table gave a lurch, drawing forth a short scream from one of the more timid of the visitors. There was nothing very.; wonderful in it. The table was of medium^ weight, resting on three central claws, and = might have been lifted by a strong foot or pair of feet, supposing a confederate was present. ? . '.[?'.'?'?'.. ?'? Presently, when tiie confusion had sub- r sided, we heard ., spine ; distinct tapping, ? suchas the back of the nail pr;the:point:of a finger might make on a Stable, and the Medium announced that the. departed friends of ' the circle' were present in' great number. At the same time ' fie: invited any of us to question the spirits and her would interpret to us their answers; .There was a moment's silence, and then M'S weeny en- - quired aloud— ' : ''Is my dear friend James Maclustey here?' ? , ,; A running battery of minute knocks on the table, and the interpreter's answer, 'Yes,' told us that the spirit of the noted forger and thief, who has already figured in .these sketches, was supposed to be in our presence. .. ''-.,-? '??'..... 'How are ye ?' continued McSweeny. - Eat-tat-tat, and the.answer— . : ? -o . . .:, V :; 'In a state of joyful happiness.' ; ; .

This question elicited no reply, so I tried another. « When will it 'be done again ?' An answer came now — ' Very soon — when the faith of the be liever is greater.'

Thomas' was a great liar. One thing struck me as singular. WJien «ever the Medium was excited or irritated, and often when he was interpreting the raps of the spirits, he lost his Yankee drawl and svtoke very fair English. I had even fancied that occasionally I could detect traces of the Scotch accent, though it seemed -tobeverv rigorously watched and disguised. .Ferrier had spoken good Euglish for an Edinburgh man, but then he had been away for three years and more, and I was now asking myself whether he might not in that interval have gicked up a smatter -in£r of Yankee phrases, adopted the new ?*' notion/' and 'boldly given himself out for .an American ; whether, in a word, the Uev. Thos. Padley before me was not Davie in person. Why did he wear a green shade ?even in the dark, if it was oiot to hide some defect ? — a squint, for instance ? ' I must have that' shade off, though I .should tear it from Ms face/' I said to my .self. ' But first I will try him on another tack. I niight be mistaken, and it would :get me into trouble if I used unseemly violence.' These thoughts had occupied a very slight -pause, and' Thomas' was still in waiting, ? '*?- so I resumed — u Can the spirits aid in the discovery of ^a criminal?' Bap-rap-rap. The answer caine with joyful alacrity. Criminal-hunting was evi dently the thing which the 'spirits ' prided themselves they were good at. *' Then can you tell me where a man dialling himself Brydone Stone, but whose k— real name is David Ferrier, is at this nio r 3ient ?' A dead -stillness followed the question, and I could hear the breath of the Medium 'Coming in a uick gasps. At last there came a flutter of taps, which in shaky and husky tones were interpreted — ' Yes.' ' Then where is he ?' '''' Another awkward pause, and then the Answer came — ' In the middle of mighty Atlantic, on Jiis way to America.' 'I think you're wrong,' I said, very quietly, and touching McSweeny at the .same moment. The ' spirit' vouchsafed no reply. ' At least,' I slowly continued, getting uiy implements ready. -{ I would like a little more light on the subject.' There was light, and plenty of it, almost instantly. Our two lanterns, slides back, were raised above the table, and their rays sent straight into the face of the medium. Then I saw that hair and beard alike were false, sprang round the table, collared him, tore the shade from his eyes, bringing the wig with it, and the squint eyes and bulky -lorow of David Ferrier stood revealed. A simultaneous scream and shout of sur prise burst from the astonished circle at, our w unexpected movements and the wonderful results. ' Caught again, Davie ?' I cried. ' You'd .better give in.' Had he not been so completely unmasked, \- I daresay he niight have brazened the thing out ; but, as it was, such a plan was not to be thought of . Still, he had no intention of giving in. I had always known him to foe headstrong. With a lounge, a wrench, .and a push— for he was a very powerful man — he had shaken us both off, and ?crashed through every obstacle, straight ? out of the room. We.were after him with a rush, and got -up to him 3-efore he could unfasten the outer door. But when he turned he had a knife in bis hand ; and, knowing his profi ciency I started'. 'back, not a great deal too soon. ; . . . \- ' Let m&igo;, or FJ1 run you through !' he hoarsely cried, with his eyes glaring with the fury of - a maniac, and liis -disengaged band uponthe latch.
