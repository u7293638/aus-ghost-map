LITERATURE Selected Poetry. The Voices of the Winds. EDWIN ARNOLD in " The Light of Asia." We are the voices of the wandering wind, Which moan for rest and rest can never find; [?]o I as the wind is, so is mortal life, A moan, a sigh, a sob, a storm, a strife. Wherefore and whence we are ye cannot know. Nor where life spring* nor whither life doth go; We are aa ye are, ghosts from the inane; What pleaaare have we of our changeful pain ? What pleasure hart thou of thy changeless bliss? Nay, if love lasted, there were joy in thia; But life's wav is the wind's way ; all these things Are but brief voices breathed on shifting string*. O Maya's son I because we roam the earth Moon we upon these string*; we make no mirth, So many woes we see in many lands, So many streaming eyes and wringing hands. Tet mock we while we wail, for, could they know This life they cling to is but empty show ; Twere alt as well to bid a oloud to stand, Or bold a running river with the hand. But thou that art to save, thine hour is nigh I The sad world waiteth in itÂ« misery, The blind world stumbleth on its round of paia ; Rise, Maya's child I wake I slumber not again! We are the voices of the wandering wind I Wander thou. too, O Prince, thy rest to find ; Leave love for love of lovers, for woe's sake Quit state for sorrow, and deliverance make. So sigh we, pasting o'er the silver strings, To thee who know st not yet of earthly things So say we; mocking, aa we pass away, These lovely shadows wherewith thou dost play.
