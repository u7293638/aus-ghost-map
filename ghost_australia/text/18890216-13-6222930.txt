How often do we hear people say, " I daresay I shall like it when I get used to it 'Then for Heavens sake let us not used as soon as possible to good writing and pure English ' But with all its faults, the Smiling Shocker does not sin alone The press has much to answer her, and, I believe, does the literary taste of the public more harm than is done by anything else line can only be because it has not realized its responsibilities in the matter. It is true that it does not undertake to educate the people in literature, but only to give them the news of the day, and to keep electors posted up in the political opinions at depart whose label they wear A ii w year s ago a little French friend of mine was sent to an English school Soon after his arrival the general elections came on, and great excitement prevailed among the boys "Iroggio,' as he was wittily called by his merry companions, wrote home to his mother in tile queer mixture of English and French that distinguished his school letters "Qu'cht ce que je suis, Mumman" Il me semble que je suis Cousin utive N'est ce pas' Write me, then, He then price a long letter pour in dire quest on qu in fact penser pour fire Conservative ' His mother responded to the appeal, and what she did for him the newspapers do for that large body of intelligent people who get their clothes and their ominous ready made, and don't care much whether the) fit and match or not But while the papers eerie out daily news and politics to the public, they should remember that just because they do this so well just because they supply the universal need they have the responsibilities of success forced upon them In numerous instances the newspaper has taken the place of the book, and is the only literature read in many an Australian home Perhaps this should not be so, but it is After hav tug read (as we will hope every) one does first the European telegrams, the nell written leaders, and perhaps some brilliant in tide on the politics of the (law, or lecture by an eminent professor, that I complain that the devout newspaper reader, instead of having his taste insensible) raised by paragraphs, anecdotes, and social "items couched in English undefiled," becomes the helpless and unconscious prey of the pictorial liner I suppose this kind of writer is generally) what one of the characters in " L Immortel" calls a "strugtorllfeur" (struggle for life) which can) excuse him much!!), but does not render him less dangerous to the public taste We all know that he can never n rite of a fire without calling it "the devouring element, ' but, after all this is not so very bad, for fire does devour, and it is an element But u that can be said for the expression ' hit, snake ship," which occurs invariably in a newspaper snake alor)'' Of all cant phrases is not this the most unnatural) imbecile' Flies Again, why will not be was given done well as he became the recipient of ' Who is a doctor so often called in medico and wh), oh why), should the words man and woman" be renounced in favour of ' lad) and gentleman v These questions I know have often been asked but I never remember The wing-tips satisfactory) answer Indeed, it is very plain that the paragraphs has no originality) He is content to give to every) occasion the time honoured, in all), forms of words which belongs to it, and does not, like the shilling novelist, seek to enrich the language with such expressions as her Great laughter It is 11 Mr I Fergus Hume that we are indebted for till phrase, and I think he should be allowed to patent it I do not remember whether the young woman in question (who was of a nervous tt nicer nure ) uttered these silver) sounds of merriment when sitting on the luxurious grass but all these examples of! English as she is written ' may be found in Madame Multi and though charity might suggest that the second nm is attributable to the wicked printer and in view at the other two, suspicion must rest up in the author But it is not only in words and phrases that some writers sin against taste Imagine a news paper (not a Victorian one) publishing on article such as 1 trodden under foot or My Chiropodist This interesting paper begins by setting forth the symptoms which led the writer to seek the assistance of one Cornelius O'Shea. The reader accompanied her for this is the experience of a " lady of with breathless interest to the door of the professor. "Aflera few moments, the click of the latch proclaims the advent of the smart footman in livery, who admits me with a supercilious, and unsympathetic dignity." (Did Bhurti Broughton invent the present tense Y At any rate she can manage it But oh ! what one has suffered at the hands of her imitators I) He shows me into a. dark; room, with the blinds down, which he noisily pulls up. I sink into a chair, and try to rally my fleeting courage. Heregirda me, I think, diadninfully-perhaps it is imagination. ' Will I wait a few minutes';' I will. He comes. I take up a Granitic. All is silent. The door opens. He returns. ' Mr. Cornelius O line is unfortunately out. Would I like to see his partner, Mr. Cutter, instead?' I would not like; but I will V-and so the narrative continues until we have assisted at the operation, and con- ducted the faint, but now confess, patient to her own home, where we thankfully leave her.- Against such an article in the name of the rising generation, who are being com- pulsorily taught to read-I solemnly protest. It is enough to neutralise tile elevating in finance of a whole picture gallery of Holman Hunt's with the explanations attached. Popular taste is much more affected by constant daily influences than by rare exhibitions of all that is best in art, or by the occasional reading of some standard work, and, having this truism in mind, it is easy to gauge the immense literary power, and consequent responsibility, of the press. It is an old remark that the Bible has borne a great part in forming the taste of the English and Scottish mittens, and. putting the religious question cattle, it would be curious to inquire what will be the literary effect on the future of its ceasing to be the book in most familiar use among the people. To return to our Shilling Shocker?. That the "average person " does not prefer the worse to the better because it is worse is shown by the great success of failed Buck, 'Vic Vera, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hilde, All these have that interest of sensational' incident and imaginative treatment winch the public legitimately demand in books of recreation. People are not to be reproached if for their amusement they do not care for "studies" even of character. If Killer Hngcnrd is sometimes preferred to George Eliot it is not for his inferiority that the former is closes, but because no mental' strain is required to follow his story, which fulfils the object of taking the reader pleasantly and easily " out of himself." So as it seems we must, and ought to have news and light reading, let us appeal to the Press in the names of Literature and Humanity, to novelists in the names of Literature and Self- interest, to give these things to us in as pure a form as possible, so that our ears may become attuned to all that is best in the English language, and that we may no longer say, after an hour spent with the newspaper or the railway novel " Aral in that hour, my lord, they did not blend in with one happy word."
