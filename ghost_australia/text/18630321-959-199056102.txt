If this be true, ond in the factf ''-??'' of tho betting market no one can doubt it, Iho ton os Mew minister and the Slave muBt bo n most dangerou customer; atill, there always is mill always will bo a party who go on the ' off chance,' and who point significantly to Old Calabar, Marquis nnd Dundee; or if I , Tory old Blnrjerr, to Lnuneelot, Idas, and Coldrsnick; and , as they point — il not digitically with their mind's-eye — they quielly lay 12 tn 2 against Lord St. Vincent's crack Never Mind, now vcrrons when tho Ides of May me '.'. corns. In tho mwiniuie, the second io public estimation, | ! lord Strtitbmorc'a .Sicciiarcineter, has nd !iPPn £i- fi/m in tho; market cf.kt; n- Lii Iticndj could have wished; Indeed, at one ,',ma his aspect misbecoming almost ussy, niia ico fact of his ' base of operatiens' hnvine -^ been changed from Newmarket Heath to tho moro «»-*? ? elastic and moss-tlid Ilsley Djwns, tends to tho belief that Snccharoraeter's understandings will nof. allow of ? any liberties beinp; taken with them; Tho knowing ' '. -ones insist that ho will positively, and under any cir-i cumstances, bo stripped for iho Two Thousand, and his ?.::. position in the* Derby Market is prejucll nally affected thereby.

I havo always, as your / :. leaders know, had a great penchant for Wuemcntlc, c ? . a horse who looks far better now, if wo may judgo by I . tlie rronkd inflciencip, thin l.ed.da rconth or two back ; bntoo calm reflection 1 cannotget over rhiso twoiiffeats \-- - ? -which he sustained in the July and Chesterfield on any ,-? . other (rrounds than that in i-accbaronieier ho met a better horse; nor can I 6ee any reason for supposing that if b'th couio equally well and fit to tho post, that supe ? ?

IiCBidea tbo three fa Touritts who monopolize the lion's Bhuro of public interest, there are a va»t. number of horses now to be found in i -the Tatter-Kill's price current, whose chance?, when gauged by public running, would appear but very outside ones, nuce-unrtju uwi;er3, lllte muiiucrt*, uru, uu»cki, ? . . blinc{ to the faults of thoso they love, and lucky it is ? that this maternal ins'inct does prodomiuateEO decidedly A or how would our poor chevaliers d'indvJtric ever 'get round?'

Tho greatest excitement i9 manifested in all sporting quarters ns to tho fott\ieomlng championship slrupglo, caused no dnubt piircipally by tho mystery attaching to his uudivulged antagonist.

Belt's Life in Lon don nriiuos that the match between Chambers and Eversnn cannot be regarded as one for the Champion 1 ship oi tho Thames in consequence of tho £20 being allowed for expenses. This I need hnrdly add is '^uukum' A tcod friend fc yachting and all aquatic amusements bus 'one the w»v \r' mu5t nil go. I alludo to Mr Bielunt Gr.fn, tha eminent ship owner aud builder. He di«d on tho 17th IllSf, , , Mill*, of Bcthnal Grefn, having on two previous occa Eions dtftatcd the rtdoububle Deerfoot in a sis miles lace, a niatjh was made for theso two men to run for an hour, which cams off on iho 12th inst., at Hackney Wick, 'in the presence of nu immense number of specmto'a somo e»y five thousind. Tho backers of both men wero extremely sweet, and then! was a Eood iU-bI of betting on the affair; but the race itself wes a very hollow uno, Mills nover having a ghost of a chance with the untiring Indian, who did eleven miles 700 yards in iho hour. It was said by some' of the disappointed one:) that Mills had not taken caro o/ nimseif, and that want of condition caused bis defeat. I don't believe tht, but think Deerfoot won on his merits, nor do I think a niMi could'bs fonnd in England able to beat Deerfoot in a raco far an hour. Ueerfont nnd Mills are matched to rnn six miles on the Dthof March, for £100 aside, at Brorapton, MillB if belli aro will, hut I fancy the Englishman can just win. .
