Something like a Ghost. " Professor Pepper's illustration of the celebrated Penryth apparition of the murdered farmer, Fischer, is well worth seeing-. All intelligent children should be taken to behold the wo id ;rs of the microscope. Of spiritualistic shams, of spirit messages and crams, We've had enough : Baldwin exposed the clumsy tricks, and Knaggs knocked Slade to fiddlesticks, And proved it stuff : Walker, the "trancist" — so he hailed, before a public challenge quailed, And called a halt ; In fact (leave Bright out) all the clan, proved themselves tricksters to a man, Not worth their salt. Now, Pepper comes — prepare to sneeze, he'll show you ghosts, sirs, if you please, And how to make 'em : He'll mix you spirits, white and grey, and leave you nothing more to say, Than how you'll take 'em.
