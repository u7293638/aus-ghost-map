PARLIAMENT. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. WEDNESDAY, MAY 25. The PRESIDENT took the chair at 17 minutes to 5 o'clock LAND TAX AMENDMENT BILL Mr WALLACE asked the representative of the Government whether he intended to go on with the Land Tax Bill tonight He thought it would be a great blunder to do so , or in fact to say or do anything which could ncLravate hon members in another place he knew perfectly that a number of hon. members had a down on the bill He voted for the original land tax, and had his own opinion about it. The PILL SIDENT said that there was no i Union before the House Mr WALLACE then simply asked Mr Hudd whether he would postpone the second reading of the bill till the Reform Bill came back of 'or the Assembly ' Mr REID said that he had met the wishes of hon. members in every way, and had already consented to several postponements He believed that a large number of hon members wished him to go on with the bill now hear, hear-and therefore he should proceed with it whatever the result might be The order of the day for the second reading of the Land Tax Amendment Bill was then called on Mr REID said he should not detain the House long,, or discuss the bill at any length Mr MACBAIN-Wby' An HOUR McHUGH -Because he does not believe in it Mr REID -It was a very dry affair, and there was very little in it. The third clause was the first of any importance, and it provided that every estate above the value of 22 500, and if of the first class above 170 acres in extent should be taxed Estates of the second class must be of the minimum area of 640 acres, and of the third, fourth, or other classes, down to the eighth, of the minimum area of uW acres The classification was set forth in the sixth clause, and was to be based on the grazing capabilities of the land, and the seventh clause stated how fat, store, and other sheep were to be reckoned He supposed that the mode of estimate adopted had been obtained from experts The eighth clause provided what value land should be assessed at in each class at L 6s 8d In class 1, £1 13s 4d in class 2, and 21 in class C Le By clause 9 it was provided that lands now in the first class should be retained in that class that second class lands should be put either in the second or third under this bill, third class under the fourth or fifth, and fourth class in the sixth, seventh, or eighth Small areas within five miles of each other were to be counted as one estate where they amounted in the aggregate to more than £2,JOQ in value J lands hereafter required by any landowner were to be considered added to his estate, and made subject to the tax Appeals must be made within a month of the time the classification was gazetted and the costs of appeal would be allowed to the appellant if he was successful Any person who bought land after the bill came into operation and did not give notice of his purchase to the Government would be liable to a fine of £50 'J heRe were the principal clauses of the bill, and lion members must know pretty well whether the measure would be beneficial to the country or not the House could not amend the bill, but must either accept or reject it On the motion of Mr M\cBuv the petition presented to the House against the bill on a previous day was read Mr MACBAIN said that Mr I ell had read the marginal notes of the clauses to the House but abstained from saying"' whether he a] proved or disapproved of the bill (Hear, hear ) His reticence could only be accounted for by the fact that he did not believe the tax to be just They were entitled to take notice of the circumstance that the hon. member in charge of the bill had not had the courage to a heap] proved of it Mr REID -I don t see that it was required Mr MACBAIN believed that the authors of the bill were very much in the same post lion as the hon. member, and had only brought it forward as a matter of policy The petition just read was signed by 1800 large and small landowners, who prayed the House to reject the bill He held in his Inland letters from 220 of the persons who had signed the petition He supposed seven eighths of them were small holders exempted from the present act but likely to come under the amended tax They showed that great injustice would be done if the bill was passed On the grounds set forth in the petition alone the House would do well to reject the. bill, in order to give the other Chamber an opportunity to reconsider the measure Of course it would be said that they had no right to interfere with the functions of the other Chamber in matters of finance It had been his aim and desire since he had become a member of the Coun- and to promote harmony between the two Houses but this was a penal bill-a bill of a class nature, and not an ordinary money bill It was a bill of a vindictive character Not only would it injure a particular class, but the amount of revenue which it would produce if carried, would be of no benefit to the country compared with the amount of harm that it would indict One of the greatest evils under which we suffered was the uncertainty which had been produced in the last three years by taxation of this character and by the intimation of the Government that they would extend! it The effect of the uncertainty was that land was not now marketable at the price which formerly obtained Even if a landowner wished to carry out the views of the Government and breakup his estate, he could not do it except at a great BaeriGce For 30 years money had not been so plentiful as it was now The banks were full of money, and the rates of interest very low No one would invest in land in Victoria on account of the uncertainty caused by this taxation, and capitalists and others who could command money were giving high prices for pastoral property in New South Wales and Queensland They had ceased to invest in Victoria in consequence of the land tax and gone to the other colonies because they believed they would be exempt from penal taxation there Perhaps the House thought he used language that was too strong when he spoke of penal taxation This was what Mr Berry said of the bill - "I repeat that the land tax was not primarily a tax to raise money but was distinctly aimed as a protest against the increase of large estates This opened up the wide question how large ought an estate to be The Attorney General said - It must be borne in mind that the tax was not a tax for revenue but one of public policy Suppose it were granted that the House should not alter a revenue bill, but might deal with one which involved a matter of public policy, the Attorney- General told them that this was not a revenue bill The House had a clear right to express an opinion on this measure Is of one was entitled to say that the rights of the Assembly in finance were involved the Attorney General further said That ) inch To might be right or it might be wrong, but it had been accepted by the country "for the time came to put on a land tax for purely revenue purposes So would I be prepared to discuss the question in a proper si felt If there had been any doubt as to what was the object of this bill, ttiCBO quotations should remove it The House was entitled to regard it not as a revenue bill, but a matter of policy The whole question of the alienation of public lands must be reviewed to ascertain whether there was any justification for a penal tax, and whether the Government of the day and the party they represented were entitled to regard an important section as criminals From the earliest times, it had been the policy of the state to alienate land in order to raise revenue If large estates had been formed, they were the result of the policy of alienation pursued by the State 'the Government of the day induced capitalists to buy Crown lands and acquire large estates, and now the cry was raised, Large estates are a bad thing let us put on a penal tax to burst them up. He wished to expose the injustice of this outcry Under imperial acts there were sold by auction town and country and to the amount of v, nine acres UP to 1860 the tenants of the Crown were expected by their purchases of land at auction to furnish the Crown with the means to carry on the Government in the ice of a large and rapid inflow of population i in c'nBB once be relied on to purchase and The tenants of the Crown were settled colonists, and it was believed that they were willing to acquire freehold property The Government of the day required money, and lands were sold by public competition The Crown tenants acquired freeholds under the jaws of the country, and it was now most un- ran for any party to say that they acquired them under circumstances which were detrimental to the State If there was any de recherche laws under which the land was alienated it was not the fault of the men who purchased at auction, and whose money was used by the Government for the purposes warn Snl'S'S Under the Nicholson act of life, o08,8t)2 acres of town and country lands near i, by "action, and the quantity sold under the act of 1862 an act which had rms much «lticised-was 422,010 acres of country lands, 2,800 of town lands, and 31,255 of suburban lands, or in all 456,705 acres'. The men who obtained land under the act of 1852 had been slandered for political purposes. He was not a member of Parliament at the time this act was passed, but it was a most unjust measure, and contrary to every principle of equity. It was made possible to run an arbitrary line over the map, and declare that every acre in the line should be surveyed. It was made possible to deprive the Crown tenants of every blade of grass the day after the act passed. Would not any man-tradesman, banker, or merchant: thus threatened with the loss of everything, feel perfectly at liberty to take advantage of the law, if allowed to do so, to protect his own interests That was what the Grown tenants did. A good many of our liberal politicians came from Ireland, and the cry in that country now was for tenant right. In Scotland the cry was not heard, because tenant right already existed there, and a more prosperous yeomanry or more intelligent class of farmers did not exist elsewhere in the world. If tenant right was good for Ireland, must it not be good for Victoria' The rights of the hardy pioneers were not to be overthrown by trading politicians. Men who had asked their lives and their money were not to be absolutely ruined, and deprived of their properties without compensation. If compensa- tion had been provided for in the land acts, a great deal of evil might have been avoided, and the state would not have had to part with its beBtlandsatanommalvaluc.but retained them until they could be turned to good account Then, under the Land Act of lbs J there were 680 607 acres of country land sold by auction Both the present Attorney-General and Mr J M. Grant were members of the M'Culloch Government during the time that act was in operation, and were therefore responsible for the alienation of those lands, and the people of the country should remember that when those gentlemen said the land tax was not a revenue tax, but one of policy, they assisted the large landowners to acquire their estates by putting up the land to auction. In 1875 and 1870 there were sold by auction 83,305 and I LO.COS acres respectively, and Mr Berry and Mr Longmore were Ministers of the Crown during part of that period of time In 1877 there were 76 000 acres Hold in 1878, 47o7C acres, and in 187'!, 50,110, both Mr Berry and Mr. Longmore being then Ministers The men who now by their own statements said the land tax was framed for purely political purposes, were therefore instruments in the aggregation of the large estates by selling the land. Mr Longmore, in another place, had said the estates were obtained by grossly unlawful means, and if that were so Mr Long- more must have used those means to enable them to get the land, but he (Mr. MacBain) must say they were bought fairly, and consistently with the law of the country From the way some gentlemen talked in another place, it would really appear as if they had assisted, others to steal the horse out of the stable and had then locked the stable door, and afterwards, rather than convict them selves, had tried to turn Queen's evidence, with the view of helping to punish those whom they had previously assisted. When the existing land tax. was passed in the other House, the Government were remonstrated with, and it was pointed out to them that the machinery and construction of the act were bad, but they would not submit to the slightest alteration, and forced it on 'J he existing act had worked injuriously to the best interests of the country, and why should hon. members therefore think for a moment of passing into law an amending act which would not only increase the injustice, but perpetuate it A petition against the present bill had been presented to that House signed by many persons who were not landowners, showing that the tax had in- juriously affected others as well as mere landowners The small landowners had been as injuriously affected by the tax as the large holders, and even more so, because in consequence of the decreased value of their land and the security they had to offer, they had been unable to borrow money for improvements at a fair rate of interest from ordinary lenders, and had been obliged to get it from other persons who charged them ruinous rates The large estate holders had also been forced to buy their lands, and he might just mention his own case in passing He bought two stations for 2,000, there being 10,000 acres of freehold land on them, but he had after wards to increase his freehold land to £1,000 acres, and over 100 families came and settled on his stations He did not refer to his own case merely to show the unfairness of the tax, as he could pay it, but there were many other men to whom the existing tax was almost ruinous, and the new tax would be 10 times worse He might mention one case An old settler died in the Western district, leaving a family, and in consequence of the tax and the rabbits and other circumstances, they were only just able to live comfortably on the estate, but if this new tax were levied, it would double what they paid at present, and they would not have a shilling left for themselves In another case, where the estate was mortgaged to two thirds of its value, the new tax would actually destroy all the share the owners had in the estate through the depreciation there would be in the value of it. There was no doubt, indeed, that unless the principles of the land tax were abolished, it would act most injuriously to the best interests of the country. It had been said that the effect of the tax would be to make the better class of lands pay a little more, but that it would take lesS from the poorer lands, and if that were a fact he did not suppose hon. members of that House would object to the passing of the bill, but the fact was it would affect small estates and the poorer lands most seriously. To illustrate his argument the hon. member read the two following table of the values, extent, and classes of the lands which came under the operation of the existing Land Tax Act, and similar values, extent, and classes of the lands which would come under the operation of the present bill if it were agreed to - ORIGINAL ACT V value. 1,319,518 2 415 771 1,001,002 8,207,402 11,074,170 2,070,000 Area Acres 337,3 305,2 2,100,831 3,207,102 0,350,003 823 exemptions at £2,500, nearly 18 percent 15 per cent tax=£123,S0ül9a per AMENDING BILL 1,700,307 0 3,489,451 0 7,50, C2 0 0,000,702 0 201,518 13 5,722 0 Area Acres 337 337 80J,2J3 2,500,811 3,048,331 153 330 6,722 0,80 003 2,O70,C00 0 0 17 027 513 0 8 U pcrconttax=£212 843 13s 4d The hon. member then said that to the amount of £212,813 16s. Id. of duty liable to be paid on the estates already under the act, would have to be added a very large area which had hitherto escaped Under the 4th class in the original act, 2,500 acres was the area exempted, and the land in that class being valued at 20s per acre, a large number of properties escaped which would have to pay under the amending bill with its additional classes. There was a large number of holdings of say 2,000 acres hitherto exempt, which would now be liable to duty, and the same remark applied to all the classes. The area exempted under the first class of the amending Ml was 470 acres instead of 640 under the existing act, under the second class 510 acres, under the third 623, under the fourth 750, under the fifth 938, under the sixth 1,250, under the seventh 1,875, and under the eighth 2 500 as at present. There was also another source of income under the amending bill. The third clause of it aggregated all hands were Spective of distance, but under the existing act a man might hold 100 parcels of land of the value of £2,499 each, providing they were more than five miles apart, without paying one farthing of duty. The effect of that clause would therefore be to materially increase the amount of duty receivable by the Crown. The effect of the new classification would be to increase the value of the land for duty-paying purposes 00 per cent, namely, from £11,974,170 to £19,097,513, and the duty from £123,805 to £212,843. The hon. member quoted from speeches made in the other House by Mr. Berry and Mr. Richard Son to show that the original intention was only to tax the natural value of the land, and then said that although that was the original intention, improvements had been taxed, and under the new bill would be still further taxed He read from a statement which had been prepared showing the effect of the present bill if it were passed as compared with the existing act. From that statement it appeared that an estate of £3,374 value in the fourth class under the act now paid on 874 acres, the amount left after the exemption of 2500 acres was made, £10 18s. 6d.; but it would, if placed in the sixth class under the present bill, pay £53 2s. 7d. An estate of £2,995 in the same class which paid £6 3s. 9d., would, if placed in the sixth CLUBS under the new act, pay £43 12s, 6d.; one of 3,191 acres, which paid 98 12s 6d , would pay £48 10s 3d and one of 2 WO acres, which paid £1 2s 6d , would pay 320a If on estate of 3,000 acres, now in the fourth class, were placed in the seventh class under this bill, the duty would be raised from £0 5s to £18158 , or 200 per cent, while one of 5,000 acres would be raised from £31 5s to £52 1s 8d ; or 60, percent, one of 10,000 acres from £93 15s to £135 8s 4d , or 44\. percent one of 20,000 acres from £218 10s to £302 le Sd , or 38 per cent, and one of 30,000 acres from £343 15s to £408 158 , or 364 per cent. The same areas as he had just mentioned would, if raised from the fourth class to the seventh have to pay additions as follows -3 900 acres, from £6 55 to £4 i 15s or 60 per cent 5,000 acres from £31 55 to 59 15s , or 200 per cent 10 000 area from £93 15s to £218 15s or 138 per cent, 20,000 acres from £218 15s to 463 15s, or 114 per cent and 30,000 acres from £313 loss to £718 17s, or 100 per cent He was quite sure that no fair minded man who would investigate the effects of the proposed new taxation would ever lend himself to legislate so far from the spirit of equity and fair play as the bill proposed to do. The hon. member then argued against the UIJUB tice of having classes made in such a way as they were now, so that while a man having 5,000 acres which would only carry 1919 sheep had to pay only £31 5s , another with the same quantity of land which would carry 5 000 sheep, or only one sheep more, would have to pay 93 15s , or a difference for the one sheep of £0210s InLngland, the income tax was raised by means of Id in the £ and to carry out a proper principle of taxation here it would be better to have classes rising 1d each and then there would not be such a jump as there was in the present act and the proposed new one He had been a colo man here since 1853 and had represented a farming district in the other House, and he was sure the general opinion of the farming class was that there was no necessity for a land tax unless there was a general taxation i of other classes of property The effect of the land tax had indeed been to destroy the property of the farmers The landowners had no objection to pay their fair share of taxation but they objected to being singled out and unjustly taxed as they were under the land tax The increase of the tax now proposed was so very unjust that he was sure the country would confirm the decision of the Council if they rejected this bill 'they could not amend the bill, and must therefore reject it for the purpose of enabling the other House to consider it again at another time On account of the effects the bill would have not on himself but on the general community he must vote against it even if it were the last act of his life Dr HI ARN moved the adjournment of the debate Mr BROM] LI moved that the debate be a0 turned. to the following Tuesday Mr REID asked the house to go on with the bill now they had begun with it After some further remarks it was agreed that the debate should be adjourned to the following Tuesday ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE Mr BROMELL moved that the House at its rising adjourn to Tuesday Mr ROBERTSON seconded the motion Mr WALLACE hoped the motion would be agreed to It would be a most unfortunate think for the country if the Reform Bill was lost From the way hon. members talked he feared that they desired to see the Reform Bill thrown out Let the land tax stand over until reform was decided Mr ROSS thought that if they adjourned the debate till Tuesday they would play into the hands of the members in another place who wished to back reform It was the clear duty of the House to deal with this bill apart from the question of reform They would have it said that they wished to shirk the question The House divided as follows - Contents 8 Non contents 7 Majority for adjournment The following is the division that - CONTENTS Mr Bromell Mr Hamilton Mr Simson \- Bud man - MacBain - Wallace \- li str - Robertson NON CONTENTS Mr Campbell Mr Jenner Mr Ross \- Chrkc - Lorimer SirC Sladen Dr Board The House adjourned at a quarter to 7 until Tuesday _ LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WEDNESDAY, MAY 25 The SrEAju.ii took the chair at half-past 4 o'clock STATE SCHOOL TEACHERS Mr COOPER asked the Minister of Edie cation whether state school teachers by the rules of the department were allowed to act as local correspondents and reporters for the press Major SMITH -They are not Till HAMILTON TRAINS Mr TOOIII V asked the Commissioner of i Railways if he would have the passenger trains to and from Hamilton delayed for 10 minutes at Dunkeld for the convenience of passengers and also whether he would enable them to obtain some refreshments there Mr PATTERSON replied that he believed the passengers for or from Hamilton would object to any delay at Dunkeld STATUARY In reply to Mr Zox, Mr RICHARDSON said there would be no objection to place the names of the statues in the public gardens upon their pedestals SP] CIAL GRAIN DRESSING MACHINE Mr LANGDON called attention once more to the heavy duties and freight charges made on a special grain dressing machine imported by Mr E Jewell of Bridgewater on Loddon, and asked the Commissioner of Customs if he would refund the duty, or allow any rebate Mr A T CLARK again replied that the department had nothing to do with the freight charges, that the legal duty had been paid, and that the law did not allow him to make any rebate MR BRINSMEAD S CASE Mr GAUNSON asked the Commissioner of Customs if, in view of certain statements made as to the method adopted by the Customs officers to induce a settlement of Mr Brinsmead s case, he would consent to the immediate appointment of a select committee to investigate all the circumstances connected therewith The statements made reflected very seriously upon some of the Customs officers, and, as the case was one of great importance, he would lay them before the House If necessary he would move the adjournment of the House. Mr. MASON Can the Chairman of Committees move the adjournment of the House (Laughter) The SPEAKER -Am I to understand that the hon. member will conclude with a motion Mr GAUNSON replied in the affirmation Mr GILLIES asked if it really and proper thing, for the Chairman of Committees on the evening of private business to move the adjournment of the House He appealed to the hon. member to refrain from doing so Mr BERRY also appealed to the hon member for Ararat, and said it was utterly impossible to conduct the business of the country when debateable matters were continually brought forward under motions for adjournment Mr GAUNSON said he would rather resign his position as Chairman of Committees than have his mouth shut Mr GILLIES That is the best thing you can do Mr GAUNSON -The hon member, who sat in that House by virtue of a special return might think so, but he (Mr Gaunson) was not there to please him The case of Mr Brinsmead was of great importance, and of the statements made with regard to it were true, there ought to be an alteration in the Customs law The following statements had been made by Mr Brinsmead, and by Mr Samuel, a disinterested witness - " Melbourne, May 17, 1831 "The reasons why I paid £250 to the Customs department to settle action they were taking against "On the hon the Commissioner of Trade and Customs asking me to abide by his decision in the first instance of refused, informing him I considered it most unfair and unreasonable to expect me to do so when I did not know what his decision was and moreover as the transaction was perfectly straight forward, It he would giving particulars of what he required explaining, I could give every satisfaction He professed himself very friendly, and I asked him to have the case brought on at once, explaining that I had urgent business engagements in the neighbour- ing colonies which demanded my immediate attention and presence and, moreover, I desired to got to England without delay he promised me I should be obliged in this, but although I continually applied to him and the Crown law officers I got no Information as to how or when they would take proceedings until the 6th of the present month, when a summons was issued for the 13th Inst at the City Police Court, My counsel having an engagement at Deniliquin That day, wished the case postponed, my solicitor called on the Crown prosecutor, who said he was willing to postpone the case to allow my counsel to be present, provided we could arrange with the Crown Law offices. I accordingly went with my solicitor, and we saw Mr. Poole, to whom we explained the case, stating that as they had kept me waiting (or six weeks, and given such short notice, unfortunately hitting on the very day which my counsel could not appear, they should not object to alter the day Mr Poole agreed, and promised that none of their witnesses should be called, and that the case should be postponed: but, greatly to my surprise, on Thursday the 13th (nat, my solicitor came to me, and stated that he had that morning seen Mr Poole, who had in formed him that they had determined to take evidence the following day, despite his promise to the contrary, they having thus put me into the Ox, knowing my counsel was away, and rendering it impossible for me to bring the evidence I otherwise should have been able had I received tlnHy notice to refute the statements I knew would he made I may also mention that owing to the Customs having postponed the case so long, I had lost three of my most valuable witnesses, they having been compelled to leave for England and America respectively "Very strong arguments were used by Messrs Oxenbould and Dawson, Customs officers, to got me to square the case, but up to this day (the day preceding that on which they insisted on starting the cast) I had told them I certainly would not be imposed upon by the style they were at tempting, but on coin over the instruments with an expert (Mr Anderson), they again started their arguments Mr Dawson professing to be actuate J by nothing but a friendly spirit towards me, pressed me very hard to come to a settlement, stating that unless I did I would not be able to leave the colony for at least twelve months, as they had divided the case into three, and intended settling them one at a time, so that should they be defeated on the first they would appeal, and If then defeated would proceed in a similar manner with each of the others He also asserted that they would ruin me with law costs, 66 and that, although I might gain the case, they would not give up my goods, but would then take the case to the Privy Council sooner than be done They also threatened to expose the whole of my business, at?, prices asked by retailers for these instruments and the prices they were invoiced to me at, making a strong point of the injury this would do my business here Similar strong threats were used, and they eventually persuaded mc to accede to their unjust demands, and I declare that it was only owing to their threats, and knowing that it would be impos- Bible for me to remain in Melbourne so long, that I was eventually induced to accede to their unjust demands as I am convinced, as was everyone who had the case explained to them, that if I had succeeded in obtaining a fair trial previous to my witnesses leaving for Europe and America, I could have lost the case "HOIIACBQ BRISISIEAO " There was corroborative evidence of this statement " Melbourne, May 17, 1861 On the 11th of this month Mr Oxenbould, Customs officer, called at my office, inquiring for Mr Brinsmead As he was not in at the time, I asked him to state his business, and he informed me that he had called with reference to a requisition made by Mr Brinsmead to have his pianos, which had been seized by the Commissioner of Customs removed from the cellars of the Queen's warehouse to be more suitable place I told him it would not be just to keep the Instruments thus exposed, and in reply to this he said they were willing, for their own likes to have them removed, as they did not think Mr Erina head would ever get his instruments back again, or, house IilBown words, It is not often we part with goods. we once get into our hands' This led to an argument on the merits of the case in general, which became rather heated, and, no doubt, under these circumstances he made statements that he otherwise would not have done His remarks were almost I" the? words,-' That the Customs know how to work the times, that they had divided the case Into three charges, and intended to reserve a point in each case, and if beaten in the first court, go on appealing,' laying particular stress on the fact ' they intended keeping Mr Brinsmead here for at least 10 or 12 months,' further remarking that it did not matter to them, as they had what he called " cheap law " ' He also laid particular stress on the fact that Mr Brinsmead would not like his business known and would consent to anything rather than have his prices made public I remonstrated with him, and told him that was how they worried people they got into their clutches, and cited the case of lingered, where the defendant, after having won his case, was unable to obtain possession of his goods that had been seized until the matter had been brought before Parliament There was a great deal more said concerning the exact, which further tended to convince me that the Customs department intended to terrorise Mr Brinsmead into accepting any terms that they chose to dictate, know him perfectly well that being only a visitor to the colony he could not possibly stop to fight out the case with them no matter how unjust were their demands I related to Mr Brinsmead the principal points of my conversation with Mr Oxenbould and he told me that this fully confirmed the opinion that he had arrived at from his interviews with both the Crown how old era and the Customs officials, and 1 mi (Firmly convinced that it was only the fear of them carrying out the threats above enumerated that he consented to accede to the Commissioner a unjustifiable demands "Pintn P SAMUPI. The case assumed more importance when it was remembered that the officer who seized the goods had a direct personal monetary intereSt. When there was no informer, they got half the fine, and when there was an informer they got a third Moreover, whatever their motives in seizing might be, they were bound on having made the seizure to bring forward evidence to fortify their conclusions. The Minister, however, had no such interest, and he should see that the officers were equally as free from in- centives to bribery such as were given by the present law. He (Mr. Gaunson) believed Mr Brinsmead was able to prove that he was entirely innocent, and had therefore to urge the appointment of a select committee on the case If the Commissioner failed to propose a committee, he (Mr. Gaunson) would move for one himself. He moved the adjourn- ment of the House, Mr COOPER seconded the motion for the purpose of explaining that his reason for asking the Minister of Education whether school teachers were allowed to act as correspondents for the press was that a young man who was employed as a teacher in the state school at North Creswick acted as local correspondent and reporter for the Ballarat Corner Some time ago the head teacher of another state school there asked permis- sion of a board of inquiry to attend their meetings as a reporter for one of the persons interested, and on being refused asked permission to attend as a reporter for the press The second request was referred to the Minister. The motion for adjournment was negatived without further discussion. The SPEAKER remarked that they had now been sitting for almost two years, and it was becoming quite wearisome to have the whole business of the House interrupted by means of those motions of which no notice was given, and which yielded no results (Hear, hear ) TRACINGS Or ELECTORAL DISTRICTS Mr C. YOUNG asked the Chief Secretary if he would direct that the municipal officers who compile the ratepayers roll be furnished with tracings of their electoral districts on the parish plans prepared by the Lands department Mr BERRY replied that the estimated cost of this work was only £150 or £200, and that if on inquiry he found that it would have a beneficial result he would give instructions to have it done. PAPERS. The following papers were laid on the table Reports of mining surveyors for the quarter ended 31st March last, return of correspondence relative to tenders for railway refreshment rooms, and return of correspondence relative to appointment of Mr O'Connor as inspector of police, THE IRON HAND. Mr GRAVES asked if it were true, as stated in a morning newspaper which supported the Government, that the Opposition had proposed a united measure to silence the small section of the House impeding the Reform Bill, and that it would be carried out. Mr BERRY regretted that time should be wasted in putting such questions The hon member must know that nothing of the sort could be done except by action in the House, and that being so the hon. member would have earlier notice of it than anyone else Mr MURRAY SMITH remarked that as the newspaper in question seemed to be on the side of the Government and yet in the confidence of the Opposition, he would assure the hon. member that the Opposition had made no such proposal. (Laughter ) OFFENSIVE CONDITION OF THE YARRA. In reply to Mr M'COLL, Mr BERRY said a reply had not yet been received from the City Council to the minute of His Excellency the Governor with regard to the offensive condition of the River Yarra BULLARTO STATION. In answer to Mr. WilEELEit, Mr. PATTERSON said that after the present works had been carried out, if the traffic would justify it, goods shed and other station accommodation would be proceeded with at Bullarto. BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE. Mr. BERRY said that as the work of the session ought now to be brought to a close, he would ask hon. members to consent to all the private business being struck off the notice-paper. He moved a motion to that Mr. R. CLARK-What about the reserves ? Mr. BERRY.-The Minister of Lands will make a statement. Mr L. L. SMITH He said he would not sell any reserves without Consulting the House. Mr. BERRY.-That was so, but a statement would be made, in order that the House might he placed in possession of the real facts of the case. He was so anxious to have the session brought to an end that he would say the reserves should not be dealt with until the House met again. Mr. TUCKER.-When will the Chief Secretary appoint the tariff commission? Mr. BERRY.-The pressure of business is so great that I cannot give my attention to that question As soon as the House rises I will deal with it. Mr RAMSAY thought the Pensions Abolition Bill ought to be allowed to pass The second reading was carried unanimously, and the bill had as much support from the Government side as from the other side of the House. Mr. BOWMAN objected to the private members business being struck off the notice paper until the reserve question had been dealt with. Mr. BERRY said no action would be taken with reserves pending the result of the hon. member a motion Mr BOWMAN-Action has been taken since my motion was before the House. Mr. BERRY -As far as I know the case remains exactly as before Mr BOWMAN-Will the Minister of Lands give the same assurance ? Mr BERRY -Certainly Mr L L SMITH -The let us hear him Mr RICHARDSON -If the hon member asks me to say that no reserves are being dealt with I cannot say that (Hear, hear ) There are reserves which the Minister of Public Instruction has asked me to deal with for his schools, but no reserves such as are included in the motion of the hon member for Maryborough are being dealt with Mr BOWMAN -It refers to all reserves Mr RICHARDSON-Since I have under stood it refers to all reserves no action has been taken Mr /0\ thought a promise should be given that no further action should be taken until Parliament had had an opportunity of expressing an opinion on the matter Mr RICHARDSON said he had not disposed of any reserves since the hon member for Marlborough placed his motion on the paper and it was not his intention to dispose of any Reserve for School purposes how ever had been made and changed for the Minister of Education Mr QUICK said that in deference to the appeal of the Chief Secretary he would give up his Chinese Voters Bill for the session Mr MUNRO supported the motion of the Chief Secretary but intimated that next session he would insist upon larger facilities being (given to private members Mr BARR submitted that if the questions on the paper were put without discussion they might all be disposed of that afternoon Mr COOPER desired to mention that in addition to the question of reserves there was the matter of the timbered land in the Daylesford district which a deputation has! asked should not be selected if the Chief Secretary wished this question adjourned until next session he should give a promise that neither the timber land nor the reserves should be dealt with in the meantime The reserves were important to the town members but the timber land was of greater importance to the country and mining members Mr MASON thought that if all the private members' business was to be struck off the notice paper the Chief Secretary should also strike off the 13 or li Government orders of the day and simply leave the Reform Bill and Sup ply to be dealt with Mr BERRY -We are going to do that Mr MURRAY SMITH said that he had no personal objection to the proposal of the Chief Secretary but he thought the question of the reserves and the timber land should be dealt with at once Both were of national importance and the whole question with regard to them should be settled before the House rose for the recess (Hear hear ) Mr BFNTsaid that he would not consent to the Chief Secretary a proposal The question of the reserves was of minutely greater mail offence than the Reform Bill and be trusted that the country members would not allow the subject to be postponed until next session He knew that some of the reserves were being dealt with now Mr A ALLAN here' Mr BENT -1 know it is a fact that s enough Would the hon. member for emerald bill (Mr Nimmo) also consent to his Harbour Trust Bill being wiped out Mr MASON - Why you stonewalled that bill Mr BENT said that he had always been a warm supporter of the Harbour Trust Bill on fair j principles The question of the reserves was one which should be settled if the House sat for another 12 months The Minister of Lands and the Attorney General had gone allotting the police reserve at Richmond like two amateur Surveyors and had made a mess of the work Then there was the abolition of 1 casions Bill introduced by the hon member for I aBt Bourke (Mr Ramsay) which would have been passed before now but for the stonewalling of the Minister of Railways and the Attorney-General I Ina was another matter of more importance than reform and one which nearly every hon member had promised to support The hon. member for Sandhurst (Mr Quick) had taken considerable credit to himself for his Chinese Bill but the hon. member for East Melbourne (Mr Zox) was the first to take action against the Chinese He headed a deputation of cabinetmakers to protest against Chinese competition and he won his point The Attorney General would have done better if instead of cutting up the police reserve into allotments he had knocked down some of the shanties in Little Bourke street Mr VALE -You must knock over 1 it? gibbon first Mr Bl NT thought that such an active Attorney-General would have managed to introduce a bill to knock FitzGibbon over there were places in this town let at high rents and filled with Chinamen, and worse than Chinamen which ought to be knocked down He (Mr Bent) noticed however, that when Chinamen went to Sandhurst the hon. member (Mr Quick) met them at the railway station with several local town councillors and trotted them round to see the sights The Chief Secretary did the same Mr QUICK They were Japanese only met them in the may or s room Mr BENT explained that he had seen his version of the matter in the newspapers He thought it would be better for the country if the Berry Government were allowed 12 months leave of absence and their Balance during that time He certainly should oppose the motion of the Chief Secretary Sir BRi AN 0 LOGHLrN suggested that the motion should be withdrawn stating that the Chief Secretary evidently mistook the temper of the House (Laughter ) The House had not the slightest intention to pass the motion, to which there were many and serious objections The Chief Secretary laboured under the idea that the House only wanted to deal with one or two particular questions this session but there were a few other matters that hon members were very anxious to consider He intended when going into Committee of Supply, after the passage of the Reform Bill to submit a motion declaring that according to the Chief secretary the time had arrived for taking into consideration the cases of those gentlemen dismissed from the public service in January 1878 (Cheers ) That was a very important question and the Chief Secretary had several times declared it should be considered after a Reform Bill had been passed in the cases of some public officers more recently dismissed the system of giving six weeks "gratuity to them had been adopted and he would ask the Government to consider the I previous cases he had referred to All feel nga of party had now quieted down and the Government ought to propose on the East makes a vote covering six weeks gratuity to the gentlemen suddenly dismissed in January 1879 as soon as ever the time of peace and happiness which would follow the passing of the Reform Bill had arrived Another question for the consideration of the House was the general departmental administration of the Government Many hon. members were dissatisfied with the administration of various departments and wished to consult the House. It was a large question, and might occupy two or three evenings Other important questions he observed on the notice paper, one being a motion for an inquiry into the Beaufort and other railway accidents Facts had recently been brought before him which led him to attach great importance to that subject. At the Stations on the single lines sufficient rails or sidings were not as a rule laid down five ral hon members were also interested in the matter of the Alma Console Company, which had been before the House over and over again V hy should that matter be postponed It would be better for the Chief Secretary to at all events allow private mem- bers the little time they had for private busi- ness than to propose to expunge all such business from the notice paper With the Pensions Abolition Bill he had not the slightest sympathy in its present shape, but still Borne hon members wished to have it discussed Then, again there were two motions relating to the canal At the in mitigation of the hon member representing the canal, members had been kept in the House until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning two or three times, in order that his canal vote of £500 might be urged He had not the , slightest objection to that vote, but he did object to being kept there until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning for it Then there were the Harbour Trust and Reserves questions As to the latter, he would ask the Minister of Lands to stay his hand in connexion with the timber reserves in his (Sir Bryan 0 Loghlon a) district, as well as with the other reserves that had been more particularly referred to The bill relating to the legal profession was also one that several members were anxious to see passed into law It would be accept- able to a great many of the legal profession Mr DUFFY -No Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN And it would be most beneficial to the public interests Mr DUFFY -You are entirely mistaken Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN was informed that a similar provision had worked beneficially in New Zealand and South Australia As to the present motion these short cuts were not short cuts at all, and he saw no necessity for hurrying on the recess Mr VALE observed that if the hon and learned member who last spoke had, as some seemed to think likely in the event of there being a majority against the Government, to manage the new team, he would find a recess very necessary In reply to Mr BOSISTO, Mr RICHARDSON said he included the Powlett street reserve in the promise he had made Mr GAUNSON opposed the motion on the ground that it would extinguish the bill to amalgamate the two branches of the legal profession, which measure, from a public point of view, he considered, a very important one The hon. member was advocating this bill, when The time arrived for closing the discussion, in consequence of the termination of the hour allotted to private members HARBOUR TRUST BILL On the motion of Mr NIMMO, it was resolved I That the promoters of the bill intituled A Bill to Amend the Harbour Trust Act 1876 and for other Purposes, which was brought into this House during the present session 1880 1, have leave to suspend any further proceedings thereupon, and to proceed with the some bill in the next session of Parliament 2 That not later than four clear days after the next meeting of Parliament the bill shall be deposited with the clerk of the Assembly, with a declaration signed by the agent annexed thereto, stating that the bill is the same in every respect as the bill with respect to which j proceedings have been so suspended at the last stages the proceedings in thlsllousc iii the present ses area 3 That the bill, endorsed by the clerk as having been duly deposited with him, shall be laid by him forthwith on the table of the House in the next session of Parliament 4 That the bill so laid on the table, and the order of leave to bring in the same in the session of 1860 81, shall be lead, and thereupon such bill shall be read a first time, a second time and committee to a committee of the whole for consideration That the above be adopted as standing orders of this House QUEENSLAND TRACKERS On the motion of Mr BENT, it was resolved - " That there be laid before this House a return of the total cost of the party of Queensland police who were sent to this colony to join in the pursuit of the outlaws, including all expenses whatever in coming to Victoria and returning, to Queensland THE REFORM BILL The House resumed consideration of the amendments made by the Legal active Council in the Reform Bill Amendments Nos 16 and 17, leaving out claviBes 0 and 10 were agreed to and Is of 18 -the following new clause was submitted for approval - for the purposes of this act the yearly value of my such lands and tenements Shall be taken to be the yearly value at which they are rated to Bouio munt eli at district or municipal districts Mr MIRAMS moved the adjournment of the House. He regretted that he had to take this course, because it had the appearance of what was technically called stonewalling, but he was compelled to do so in order that he might be enabled to address himself to the whole question he was not responsible for this state of matters If any persons were responsible, they were the Government, be cause they allowed the first motion to be a warned before hon members had a sufficient time to discuss the question Before address ing himself to the main features of the question he desired to put the Attorney-General and Chief Secretary right on one point These Ministers had said that the gentlemen sitting in the Corner who pressed the Government to deal with the reform question this session were in some way responsible for the present position of the Reform Bill that they were re- sponsible for the action taken by the Council, for the amendments that Chamber had made, and for the necessity the Liberal party were said to be under of accepting the terms offered He however, could not see how the Corner party could be held responsible They felt that they were bound to urge on the reform question before going into recess, and in protesting against its being shelved until next session they but performed their duty to their constituents They never supposed however, that the Government would accept such terms as those offered and that they would make the fact that they were compelled to go on with the bill this session an ex pense for their conduct The Chief Secretary had raised another side issue by attempting in some mysterious way to make the gentlemen in the Corner responsible for the action of the other Chamber in relation to the Land Tax Bill, but he (Mr Mirams) again failed to see any connexion at all be tween the Corner and the Council in regard to that measure, and he maintained that the attempt to saddle the blame on the gentlemen in the Corner was unfair and uncalled for He for one at all events disclaimed any responsibility in the matter Having disposed of these side issues he now I desired to address himself to the main question A fortnight ago the country never anticipated that it would be called upon to discuss it in its present phase hon. members ought not therefore to be anxious to hurry the matter through without due consideration they had been asked to accept the bill as it came from the Council ( Certainly not ) He was aware that they were supposed to be considering certain amendments on the Council s amendments to be proposed by the Chief Secretary The Chief Secretary, it was true, intended to ask the House to disagree with the Council on three points, and they were now forced into this position, that they had to discuss the question prematurely They did not know for a certainty as to whether the Government was sincere or not in asking the House to agree to modifications They had no assurance from the Government that if their alterations were agreed to by the Assembly they would be adhered to, and that it was not all a sham Indeed, one of the newspapers, which appeared to be in the confidence of the Government had stated that evening that " Mr. Berry knew very well that the Council would not modify their amendments one iota Major SMITH -M that paper Mr MIRAMS- The Heard (Laughter) That being the case, and in the absence of an assurance from the Government that they would adhere to their proposed alterations he was under the necessity of discussing the bill as it had been received from the Council If, however, the Chief Secretary would take his stand on those amendments, he would find no heartier supporter than himself Now what were the facts of the case The Chief Secretary defended the proposals of the Council on two grounds The first was the merits of the measure He thought now that there was some good in the proposals of the other Chamber-that something would come out of them favourable to the Liberal party We cannot do better he told them, "and when we get this measure we shall be on a van togo ground for securing further measures of reform afterwards As one of those who had given the Chief Secretary a firm and consistent support for every long time, he (Mr Mirams) very much regretted that he could not agree with him in this matter If the hon. gentleman had discovered any grounds which would justify the alteration in his opinion, and for turning his back upon himself, he ought, at any rate, to communicate them to his followers, so that it might be seen if they would be sufficient to warrant also a change of opinion on their part for four years he had assured his followers that a measure of reform such as they were now asked to accept, unless accompanied by two provisions it did not contain, would not only be useless, but worse than useless He asked the other night whether it would not be more modest for the eight or nine gentlemen who did not agree with him to consider and reconsider the position, and ask them selves whether there might not be elements n connexion with the reform question which, although they could not understand, were perfectly plain to the 38 members who followed the Government This, however, was not a question of modesty, but of consistency, and all that he (Mr Mirams) desired to say had been already said for him and with him by the Chief Secretary himself over and over again both in that House and throughout the country The hon. gentleman, when introducing his first Reform Bill, said Unless we can first secure Borne legislative enactment which will give us finality in ordinary legislation and that will settle the position of the two Chambers in relation to finances, any measure of reform based merely on the enlargement of representation would not only be useless but worse than use less Further on he argued against a bill on such lines as the present by referring to the mea sure passed in 1868, which he said made the House worse than it was before. His words were " In 1868 a bill for the reform of the Upper House was introduced, but I don believe any earnest man expected that it would do any good Most thinkers imagined that it would do a great deal of harm It I enlarged the electoral basis of the other Chamber I It reduced the qualification for members and also for electors, but it did not reduce the term for which members were elected or give the power of dissolu- tion. However, It passed into law, and it was supposed that such an alteration was made in the constitution of the Council that we would have no more deadlocks, no more conflicts between the two Chambers, but that legislation would be carried on in an orderly, proper, and satisfactory manner ' Still further on, he read - "I am stating the history of the case, and I am confining myself to facts, in order to place before hon members and the country the hopelessness of expecting any change for the better from the Legislative Council even by such a reform as that of abos I am drawing a distinction between the Legislative Council previous to the reform of 1883 and the Coun- end of last year, and I say that for all practical pur- poses the Council of last year was worse than its predecessors Consequently, having had aÍJrcla«tcof what would be brought about by a reform such as that proposed new by the Legislative Council, we can realise the effect which any such reform would have had upon the crisis of last J car Whj, among the present members of the Legislative Council there is at least one who. in 1866 and 1867, being the i a leading member of this House, was one of the foremost in protesting for the principle that this House had the toll control of the public purse Subsequently after the reform, or rather the alteration, of 1803 he be came a member of the Legislative Council, and last session there was no one member of that body more determined than he was, at all risks. altogether careless of what danger might fall upon the colony, to do the very thing in the Council that he protested against when a member of the Assembly T) at being so, IS it not clear that the evil will not be remedied merely by a change of men \- by a change of representatives? The constitution of the Council Is radically wrong, it makes good men bad as soon as they are placed in that Chamber with out responsibility Under these circumstances, I Dunk hon members will admit the uselessness, indeed the worse than uselessness, of attempting to amend the Council in the direction adopted in 1868, which experience has shown to be radically bad ' Mr. BERRY Quite correct Mr. MIRAMS continued quoting Mr. Berry's speech from Hansard, as follows " VY hat I wish to impress on my hearers is that the whole composition of the Upper House under the Constitution Act as at present interpreted as fraught with danger, and that no improvement of the goals of its representative power could possibly influence it for good It is so totally opposed to the spirit of the age that in my opinion there is no other way of bring ing It into harmony with the rest of the community than laying down the clear exposition of Its (ion ors and functions which is contained in the present measure ' In the same speech the hon. gentleman made use of this remarkable expression - "I want hon. members to put before themselves the fact that this bill is no mere stalking horse It is not something to be talked over for a few nights, and then cast into the waste paper basket I challenge every hon. member to have clear views on the subject, and to know whither he 1B Long For myself, I know exactly whither I am going ' Now did the hon. gentleman really know then that, after four years of hard fighting, he was going to give up all he had been fighting for, and to take from his opponents just what they liked to offer, or were his words mere Duncombe' If he did know where he was going to, and at the same time assured his followers that he would bring them through in safety, his supporters and the country had been most beautifully befooled, He (Mr. Mirams), however, did not think the hon. gentleman did know then that, at the end of four years, he would have to ask his followers to accept whatever their opponents liked to offer, or else to go without anything at all. During the debate on the first series of resolutions which Mr Service moved, the Chief Secretary asked the House HUB question - "Are not hon. members struck with a sense of the indignity that is involved in the conduct of the Legislative Council towards their? Bu', in fact, we have become accustomed to almost any thing I will undertake to show do not mean to night that there is not another Legislative Assembly in the world, holding a position like our own that would not blush with shame at the thought that any members of the English lace hair put up with the indignities we have had to endure tie (Mr Mirams) would ask whether there ever was an indignity placed upon the members of the Assembly equal to the one they were now asked to submit to, when they were told that they must take what the other Chamber was willing to give or else go without any thing ' Was it possible for members sitting behind the Government to conceive themselves in a more humiliating position On the motion to postpone the consideration of the Council s resolutions, and in the debate which ensued, the Chief Secretary, in reply to Mr Mackay, said "I think the last speaker, as well as most hon. members, must know that the conflicts which have arisen between the Houses in the past are due in great measure to the strength of the Legislative Council being in excess of what is usual with respect to a Be could Chamber They must see, therefore that, looking to the best interests of the Assembly, it would not do to aggrandise the (lower that Is In opposition to us - that the whole force of public opinion ought to be directed not to strengthen but to we keep it "Mr M Intyre How can harm be done by allow Jug the public voice to govern the Council elections? "Mr Mackay -Would not making the Council amenable to public opinion be a reform in the right direction? Mr Berry If hon. members will consider the subJect fully, they will see that the reform embodied in the Commits bill would not alter the political character of that body at all Without proposing to discuss the matter hillside not desire to do so on the present occasion I ask hon members to look at the last reform the Upper House effects 1 In their constitution All the arguments we hear now about popularising the Council, and brilliant. It more under the control of public opinion, were brought forward then Well, the electoral basis of the House was in creased, and what toil resulted? ItBitnplv became a more or attractive House that it was before it was worse than treating hon. members like children, having led his party on the strength of these reasons for three years to turn round and ask the party to change their opinions without telling them vi li it ground he had for the change The hon. gentleman went on further to any - 1 But we know what the effect upon the Council of the fact reform, with respect to its lists of represent tion, has been We know that the two Chambers are as antagonistic is ever, and that the result of idol ling the bill now before us would be that, instead of a contest between two HOUSES, we would have a contest between two electorates I don't think that, unless we wish the Council to be able to speak with ..rclterauthorit), and to gradually become so strongly to overshadow the Assembly, we could possibly desire to see a constitutional change of that character Unless we wish to place them in a position trebly trouser than that they now hold, we could not agree o pass their bill until we have secured finality of legislation, and broken down their power of absolute intuition sm Where was there in this bill any proposal to give finality or break down the power of absolute antagonism ' It might be said theRe quotations were four years old, and that things had changed There might be reasons of policy now why we should accept a bill which we could not accept then, but first of all he wanted the question of fact made a lear Did the Chief Secretary believe now all he had said against the bill, and simply ask the House to accept it on the ground of policy ' If the Chief secretary would state that, he had not a word more to Bay on the question of fact. But if the hon. gentleman stated that he spoke what was wrong four years ago, and that he had altered his opinion now, he ought to give hon. members his reasons, and not ask them to follow in the dark Mr LONGMORE Hear, hear A conspiracy. Mr MIRAMS -When the Chief Secretary addressed his constituents at Geelong in February last he said - " It is now a question as to whether or not the matter of constitutional reform would be settled by kee) '"Is to £10 "nM III down b> "l0 Liberal party loptfromtbo days of Mr Iliginhuthim-or whether It should be settled according to the lines laid down by the LcgWatlv Council (Orders of " No, no ) " He also said " If they could not got the BERT clause, it would be better by far to let the constitution alone ' Mr BERRY -What did the country say to the sixth clause ? Mr LONGMORE-Does that justify a change of opinion' Mr. MIRAMS contended now as the Chief Secretary did then, that if we could not get a measure of reform to make the Liberal party more powerful, it would be better to let the matter of reform alone altogether During the time the Service bill was being discussed in the Assembly, Mr. Berry went to a public meeting at Emerald hill with Mr Nimmo, and criticised the measure. He said " He regarded the measure before the House as the outcome of the hopes and fears raised in the members of the Council by the longstanding agitation for reform, and believed that it would enable the Council to more effectually oppose the will of the people, for It would no longer be in the power of any one to say that Chamber represented a small section of the people it would represent one half of the community, and in that half would be vested the supreme power The part of the Service bill be was criticising was that dealing with the franchise That bill offered far more to the country, by his own admission the other day, than the mea sure now before the House If that bill placed the supreme power in the hands of half the people, the present one placed it in the hands of less. Mr. Berry further said on this occasion - "So weary was he of the struggle that he would gladly have supported the measure had he not thought that it would be disastrous in its operation But he felt that it would be better to set the question aside than settle it in such a manner " He (Mr. Mirams) was of the same opinion now. (Hear, hear ) But not two liberals would have believed this statement of the Chief Secretary. Mr. WOODS -Not one in 100. Mr. MIRAMS -On that same measure, when Mr Service introduced it in the Assembly, Mr. Vale spoke as follows - II Does he not know that the whole policy of the bill he seeks to introduce is to deprive one half of the manhood of the colony of their legitimate influence and power in the government of the country ! The plan is crafty, and worked out craftily, but assuredly the whole arrangement will stamp its author more than ever with the title of Scotch Jesuits gave him during the general election That des (nation is amply justified by the way in which, by cutting and deceiving, he has disappointed the fair and reasonable expectations of the hon. member for Belfast What is his bill t One fact in connexion J W Uli It is sufficent to show its utter weakness The present Legislative Council representing 30,000 electors, the argument of Sham liberalism is-' We will give the Council in stead 110,000 electors, and then it will represent the whole colony ' But the hon. member failed to tell the country and fact which it will soon enough And Out for itself, namely, that to centre the power of the colony in llu,000 electors for the- Council will deprive those not represented there of their legitimate force in the management of the country s affairs ' Was this the sham liberalism we were to have forced upon the country now ' Mr. Vale was not talking about the elimination clause, but the franchise only. He proceeded " Virtually, Indeed, the result will be to bring us back to what the colony believes it long ago discarded, and to utterly defeat the principle so strongly laid down by the advocates of liberal statesmanship in Great Britain, that the prime consideration in every country should be Its manhood, and not merely its accumulated wealth Where would the accumulated wealth of the colony be if Its manhood ceased to exist t It appears to me that when the Premier told us that the pith of his proposals was to enormously increase the power of the Council, while adding only 80,000 electors to its franchise, he, at the same time, afforded these proposals the most conclusive and effective answer of an inimical character they are capable of receiving " Were they in the same Assembly dealing with the same proposals Were these the same men who only a few months ago told these broad truths, and who now asked the House to take a worse bill' Those gentlemen who had so completely turned round were bound, in justification of themselves, to give the country the reasons upon which they changed their front Did the Attorney-General mean to stand to the £10' Mr. VALE.-I have always gone in for the £10. Mr. MIRAMS -If the Chief Secretary or the Attorney-General would clearly and honestly tell the House that they were in earnest in making these proposed amendments, and that they meant to abide by them he had not one more word to say. But he was not going to be befooled into a belief that there was any intention to go for these amendments if the hon gentleman would not say so If they would not pledge themselves to stand by the amendments, he was bound to deal with the bill as it existed When moving the second reading of the Reform Bill in February last, Mr Berry said - "We have now come to a proposal by which we pro pose that practically the second Chamber shall represent the whole people of the colony I shall be surprised to hear in this House any a very strong opposition to such a proposition It is a totally different pro poses from that which has emanated from the other Chamber itself Diving the white people a vote for the Council, and letting that Chamber represent the whole people, is an entirely different thing from allowing the Council to maintain its present except Moral character, simply extending the franchise to a few thousands more i Therefore if there is to be reform in the direction of widening the basis of the Council there is DO safety unless we go to the full extent, and lctitrepresent all the ratepayers of the colony If we do that, whether we get what we want our selves or not, at all events we shall have given to the majority of the whole people the control of their own attain, and I think that is the great claim which this measure has to the support of this House and the country " " This measure is essentially a compromise It is not one man's particular ideas, but it appears to be, from the exhaustive process, the course the country desires to adopt. We have a right to recognise that, and I believe that if we pass this bill quickly, and in its entirety, we will earn that credit from the country which it ought to be our ambition to acquire This was the Chief Secretary's utterance in February last, so that we had followed him now for four years, giving utterance to the same sentiments. The hon gentleman's utterances at the conference, the last before he changed his mind, were the strongest in opposition to the course he was now taking Mr Berry said at the conference - "Any reform worth having must be in the repre- sentation of the country in the House. The House must cease to be a sectional House, and must be a representative of the country, otherwise, under the care of reform, we get no reform at all If you still keep the House only representing a loss or even classes, it may come in conflict with the House repre sorting the nation in the future, as it has done in the past, and therefore while there is no wish to haggle with the Council and say, ' Our proposition is better than yours,' our desire is to bring about a reform that shall be permanent, and effect in purpose to bring the two Homes Rule harmony Our proposition is that the Council shall cease to be a sectional House, and become a national House, and then all other things will be changed by the House being national " Did this bill in any way come up to the standard there laid down by the Chief Secretary only three or four weeks ago' When Sir Charles Sladen was asked to state to the conference what he was prepared to submit as a point of compromise, and as a something that might be accepted by the Assembly, there was a long discussion upon the question of including the provisions for plural voting After Sir Charles Sladen had argued for 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour for the power to continue the law for manufacturing plural votes, he said " Of course, subject to that and to keeping the professional vote and the educational vote, the e- funds are worth g to accept as the freehold ratepayers roll so low as Ale and the leasehold of £20 He (Mr Mirams) asked hon. members to give their attention to the reply of the Chief Secretary, He said " I would not undertake the responsibility of proposing that to the Assembly, Mr Charles ' Sir Char es Maden -Very well, we have done our best to tell you what we have arrived it, and our reasons "Mr berry -Ulsan addition or plural voting Sir Charles bidden It's no addition of plural voting , we keep it just as it Is Mr Leiry-1 speak of our bill as it left the Assembly mix cup end the Assembly will enact, with its known objection to the plural voting, a new system, to put into the bill, and then send up to you, a new principle altogether, which will multiply the votes of any one individual He can have voted in any constituency where he chooses to have pro- perty, thus giving one man three times, five times, or even ten times the electoral power of any other man They will add that, and at the same time disfranchise one half of those whom we propo et) enfranchise in the other by 1 I cannot see, after all that has gone past, how, va reasonable men, you can expect the Assembly to consider that bill-it is considerable beyond any thing that the conservative Government put to the country and were beaten us on A little further on the Chief Secretary replied upon the same point He said "It is trying to keep up a class Umso It neutralises too whole object of reform The whole object of this Reform bill is to leave the Council from being a mere sectional class House a id to make it a House of the entire country, trusting to the good sense, the practical sense, of the Two Houses of Par- liament to carry on public business, and to steer clear of any difficulty If we cannot do this, we had better leave things as they are-this is only a proposition to strike, then the hands of the Council as against all the rest of the colony. We should have simply repeated in the future, what we have had in the past, with this difference that the Council would have recruited itself, and brought in all the forces that they think would make them supreme, and make them strong to fight the Assembly We had infinitely better leave things as they are That was the last utterance of the hon. gentleman before he entered the Assembly, and told them that he had altered his mind, that it was not infinitely better to leave things as they are," but that it was infinitely better to take the bill which he had denounced only three weeks before In doing this he had not even the courtesy to tell his followers the grounds upon which he had changed his opinions during those three weeks. The only reasons he assigned for his change of front were grounds of expediency There were three expedients, so far as he (Mr Mirams) could gather, which, either separately or unitedly, were considered sufficient in the judgment of the leader to warrant his chance of opinions, his change of purpose, and to ask his followers in the House and in the country to do so also What were they The first was, " We want peace, the country is tired of the Reform Bill, and we want peace " (Cheers ) The second reason was, " We want to get on with practical legislation " (Renewed cheering ) The third was, "That the Government is not safe unless this bill is passed." This was the reason which probably had most weight and influence with those who sat on the liberal side. A little while ago this word "peace,' coupled with prosperity, was in all the journals of the day, and on every platform where the conservatives had a footing This "peace and prosperity ' were like the Siamese twins, supposed to go together, but now the word " prosperity " had dropped out. Mr. VALE.-We have got it. Mr. MIRAMS -And we would have peace in the same way. Prosperity came without the Liberal party stultifying themselves and of its own accord, and so would peace Had the hon. gentlemen endeavoured to prove to the House and to the country wherein that peace-if he meant by that political peace-was more likely to he gained by accepting this bill than by rejecting it' Because those were the two alternatives before him either to accept the bill as the Council offered it to him, or to give it up altogether. It was the duty of the Ministry to show their followers if they were to take this bill for the sake of peace that they would have peace after this bill had been taken. If they could not do this, they were asking their supporters to follow them in the dark without rhyme or reason At the meeting of the National Reform League the other evening, a resolution in favour of the proposals of the Government was carried by a majority of 2 out of 32 votes That very amendment contained a war cry, a rallying cry, for the party to unite together more earnestly, and to reorganise, and not to be satisfied with this instalment of reform, but to go on until they had got all that they wanted Where was the peace in that? Where was the promise of peace if they accepted the bill on those terms' The Chief Secretary knew that this measure could never secure peace to this country, but that it would lead to more bitter war than we have hitherto had only with this unfortunate difference, that the Liberal party would be fighting denuded of half their weapons, weapons which they had been fools enough to hand over to their opponents in the arena, f Hear, hear ) With respect to practical legislation, he asked the Chief Secretary or anyone on the Treasury benches how they could get practical legislation, after this bill had passed, any more readily or easily, or certainly than they could now, with the present House opposed to them. Bad the Chief Secretary not told the party for four years that they were only strengthen- ing the other House against themselves in proposing to accept such a measure as this If that were the case, how could they wring from the other Chamber measures of reform more readily and easily than from the present Legislative Council' It was the duty of the hon gentleman to explain that to the party and to the country The Age that morning asked the hon members for Avoca and for Ripon and Hampden what they would do, with the present Home in existence, if they threw out the Land Tax Bill Mr GRANT.-Which they will Mr MIRAMS Of course they would But the Age did not show a way out of the difficulty, even with the present House in existence But supposing the new House was in existence, and that the liberals had a dozen out of the 18 new men-which was a very wild supposition-and that the Government sent up a bill to tax not land but property Mr COOPER -And a very good tax too Mr MIRAMS -Yea, but a very unlikely one for the new House to pass when they were going to be directly elected to represent property and to prevent it from being taxed What would the Ministry do then' Had they got any machinery in this bill to force that property tax upon the reformed House any more than they had now to force the land tax upon the present House ("No ) He thought he might fairly say, on the part of the Government, that silence gave consent They knew very well that there was not a single pro v 181011 in this bill for anything of the sort The Chief Secretary the other evening mentioned indirectly the grounds upon which he based his belief of being able to pass measures of practical legislation Were they sufficent to warrant him taking the responsibility and the risk of accepting this measure The only ground upon which he based his prospect was this-not that he would get a majority of liberals in the other House, for lie, in common with himself (Mr Mirams), looked upon that as hopeless, but that he would get six or eight or 10 such clever, earnest, eloquent members that they would be able to talk down the opposition of those opposed to them (Laughter ) They had bad Borne illustration of the talking ability of the hon gentleman in the Assembly, and it was rumoured that he feeling his seat for Geelong not very secure Opposition cheers) was going to retire to the other Chamber to be one of those gentlemen who were to talk down the opposition there He (Mr Mírame) repeated that they had had some illustration, some evidence, of the hon gentleman's power of talking in the Assembly, but he had never yet found been able to talk down oppose" all Tt"' 'Mr Mirams ) experience was that the hon. gentleman had talked away his friends, and had talked the Opposition into power His experience was that the Liberal party was much weaker now than when they started under the hon gentleman four years ago The result of that four years talking had been to weaken the Liberal party to such an extent that the hon. gentleman was now obliged to tell them-' If you don't take this bill, which you detest, we shall have to go out of oûVe is as it not childishness, folly, and worse to ask the country to accept a bill of this sort, based upon the suppose tion, not that they would get their friends into the other House many numbers at all, but that they would get half a dozen in who by their superior power of talking would be able to talk down all opposition That was the sum total of the grounds upon which the hon. gentleman had based his claim to support of his party to this measure If the Government thought it was necessary for the sake of the Government, that this bill should be passed, they, at any rate ought to show their followers that the Government would be saved by passing it. It was rather too much for the Government to expect the party to pass the measure in the hope of saving their existence, if, after it had been passed, they would be still destroyed, because the party would then be paying the price without getting the reward At the meeting of the Reform League to which he had already referred, there was not one person who founded any argument on the ground of the bill being suitable, or such a one as was desired , but they all urged that the fate of the Ministry was involved and that they could not afford to let the Liberal Government go out of power The result was that 17 votes out of 32 were secured for the sake of saving the Government Was it not, therefore, incumbent upon the Government to show that it would be safer after the bill had passed than before ' They, however, could not do anything of the sort Itoppearedto him (Mr Mirams) that they were taking the very course to make them selves insecure So far as he know, the Government would be far safer in rejecting the bill than in passing it That, however, was too low aground to place the question upon But there was another side to consider If the Government raised that issue the party, as intelligent men, and as men who had the destiny of the colony in their keeping, was bound to ask themselves whether the Government was worth saving at such a price (Ironical cheers ) Mr. BENT No, not at any price Mr VALE- It is not Mr MIRAMS -There was one question which every hon member sitting behind the Government ought to consider for himself They were asked to accept a measure of reform which was no reform at all, which the Chief Secretary had denounced more than any other man in the community, and which he had given no reasons for now adopting In fact, he did not think one member on that side had accepted the bill on its merits , they accepted it because they desired to leave the Government. It was the duty of every hon member who had a charge to his constituents on his conscience to ask himself whether the Government were worth saving at such cost (Cheers of various descriptions ) What had been the career of the Government * When using that term, he spoke not only of the gentlemen now occupying the Treasury benches, but of those who had sat there before under the present leader Using the term in that sense, the Ministry had been in office during the past four years Mr VALE-No Mr MIRAMS -If the Attorney-General liked, he would apply Ina strictures to the leaders only Mr VA II Your strictures . Mr MIRAMS would ask hon. members to look at what the Government had done in relation to this question of reform, and then to state whether such leadership was worthy to be continued at the price the party was asked to pay for it, viz ; the acceptance of this bill, which they all thoroughly de- tested Mr NIMMO-We may get a worse leader and a worse bill Mr MIRAMS -Not very well What was the year first thing the leader of the Government did in relation to this question ' In May, 1877, i House was elected to pass a Land Tax Bill and a Reform Bill But the first thing the leader of the party did was to delay the reform question for 12 months allowing public enthusiasm to cool That was the first mistake the hon. mem- <r made An HON MEMBER -YOU approved of it Mr MIRAMS did not know that but at a events, he did not disapprove of it. He desired to shirk no responsibility The party was never asked, so far as he knew, to delay the consideration of the question for 12 months That was done purely at the instance of the leader The next mistake made, judging by results, was the embasSy (Cheers, and a little dissent ) The result had proved that the embassy was a mistake (Cheers from all sides ) Mr. NIMMO No, it was the greatest success Mr MIRAMS According to a leading article in that days Age the embassy was a mistake, and he was now satisfied, judging by results that that view was the correct one He was prepared to take his share of responsibility in connexion with that, because that proposal was submitted to and adopted by the party But the chief blame rested on the leader, because had it been a success, he would have taken the chief credit It was only necessary to put it that way to see that, whatever blame attached to the party, the principal share belonged to the gentleman who led it, and recommended the step The third mistake was committed when the hon gentleman came back from England He then did not bring in his own Reform Bill over again, but a different bill, thereby affording hon members who, after two years work there, were anxious for changes Mr. VALE -A good phrase (Laughter ) Mr. MIRAMS was prepared to be miss represented, and most by those gentlemen with whom he had been most associated (Cheers.) He would not be diverted from his remarks by any interjection from the At torney General The next mistake was to throw up the first bill and bring in a new one Two mistakes were involved in that. In the first place, the leader of the party, who had had some 18 or 20 years Parliamentary experience, ought to have known that it afforded certain members of the party a good and plausible ground for going against him and the new bill, seeing they had all voted for the previous bilL That was a great mistake, and it was due to that that the question was not settled years ago Mr COOPER -We told you that at the time, and you did not believe it Mr MIRAMS -The organ of the party, which was now backing up the hon. gentleman, said in June, 1886 " That the amendment (of the constitution has not been already successfully carried out, we are afraid we must put down to Air Berry himself Had he adhered to the first measure of reform which he pro rented to Parliament, and which Parliament endorsed by such an unprecedented majority there was abso lutely nothing that could have prevented it from bo comlngtholawof the land except the forcible tutor section of the Imperial authorities The mistake of throwing over the first bill was made without consulting the party which was not responsible for it, and some members of which followed the hon gentleman against their judgment rather than break up the party but there was a proposal in the new in which was a great mistake, under the circumstances He referred to the proposal for a nominee House (Cheers ) He was not going to say that the nominee system was not the best he believed it was (Dis sent ) But the leader of the party put that proposal in the bill, although it had never been submitted to the party or the country, and some of the members of the party supported it against their will That was in the last session of that Parliament, and hon. members had to go to their constituents in mediately afterwards But after the party had agreed to accept the proposal, the hon. gentleman had not the courage to put it to the country, and dropped it out of his scheme The members of the party had to turn themselves twice over within six months in relation to reform, in order to keep with the party and secure some measure of reform (Laughter ) Was that leadership to be enamoured of, or that, in order to retain it, they should swallow that detestable abor tion the present Reform Bill' An HON MEMBER Why did you not object before Mr MIRAMS could not allow the challenge of the Chief Secretary to pass unanswered If the members of the party were asked to take this bill for the purpose of keeping the chief in office, they should ask themselves whether they were prepared to pay such a price for it. The price was too high (Cheers ) At a meeting of the Reform League the other night, 15 out of 32 members said the same thing In other words, 13 voted that it was better the Government should go out than that the Reform Bill should be adopted Mr R CLARK That is good news Mr MIRAMS Was it possible for the party to be in a worse position than at present, after four years of the hon gentleman's leadership during which they had worked hard and earnestly, and stood by the chief and followed him through measures they did not like' That position was that they must either accept this abortion of a bill or get money at all Under any circumstances It causes us a serious question, is Zita interests of the party, whether such leader- ship was worthy to be followed any longer , but when the retention of the leadership was coupled with the acceptance of such a bill, there could scarcely be two different opinions about it. On the question of reform, they had utterly and miserably failed, and the worst failure of all would be the acceptance of this bill As to general legislation, what had the Government done in the four years to warrant their retention in office at such a price' The Age of that morning said the party exhausted itself in passing a Land Tax Bill That was the only measure of public policy secured by the party under the four years leadership of the Chief Secretary Mr M'KEAN-Move a vote of want of confidence, and go at it straight (Cheers from all sides ) Mr. MIRAMS -There was a time for all things, and no vote of want of confidence was likely to succeed before the Reform Bill was passed Mr PATTERSON On Mr MIRAMS Hon. members opposite have set their minds on this Reform Bill which, of itself, would have removed any doubt he might have entertained as to the desirability of opposing it Mr Vv OODS -It a their bill Mr MIRAMS -The desirability of moving a vote of want of confidence was not now being diseased When the Reform Bill was passed, and hon members opposite had kept the present leaders of the Ministerial party long enough in office to accomplish their object, then they might be quite willing to join in a vote of want of confidence, but perhaps then they would not find him quite so willing to join with them He had shown that the leadership was a failure as regarded reform and as to general legisla- tion what had been done' four or five years ago, they told the working classes they should have a free breakfast table (Cheers ) Instead of keeping that promise, the Government had increased the duties on beer and tobacco The Government had promised the country over and over again to pass a bill to abolish plural voting but the acceptance of the Reform Bill would extend that principle indefinitely The leaders of the party now asked the House to accept a bill which contained three or four clauses multiplying the plural vote indefinitely The Chief Secretary, when he said the other evening how much of the bill he was going to object to, did not say that the plural voting clauses were part of it The hon gentleman was quite willing to accept them and allow every man in the Conserva- five ranks to get a vote in any province by acquiring property rated at £10 per annum The Council Lad altered that part of the bill which provided that all the elections should take place on one day, and had distributed them over five days, so that the plural voters could have an opportunity to record all their votes Mr M KEAN-Shame ' Mr L L SMITH -That was the bargain with the Opposition Mr MIRAMS Under the present law, if a house was rated at £100 per annum and there were joint owners, two could have a vote , but, under the bill, such a house would carry 10 votes These joint ownership clauses were dangerous enough at present, but they would he five timesasdangerous under the new law "What chance would there be of passing a bill to abolish plural voting with a Council elected by plural votes a How could the Chief Secretary compel the Council to pass such a bill ' V here did the Chief Secretary suppose he was going to get the eight or 10 liberal men in the new House when the election of 18 took place in two years. The hon gentleman calculated on securing from six to nine of those Beats First where was he to get the candidates' Under the bill candidates must have an income from real property of atleast£150 per annum clear of all en cumbrance But there were only 1 080 owners of real property rated at £150 and upwards now many of the 4 089 had £150 worth of freehold property clear of encumbrance about half ' That would leave them 2,000 to select representatives from, and very few of them would be liberals Of these few, scarcely any would care to enter election costs But suppose they did persuade some to stand, how were they to be elected' At the July elections for the Assembly the liberals only beat the conservatives by 8,000 or 9,000 votes If the elections had been held under the Council rolls e , if 76,00 ratepayers and the 30,000 on the general roll had been 1 Cocked-hat conserv natives would have won and the liberals would not have the ghost of a chance Vi would the Chief Secretary have been returned for Geelong if all occupiers below 220 and all freeholders below £10 had beenetruckoff the rolls' PheAttorney General defeated Mr Blackett at Fitzroy by 50 votes If the election had taken place under the proposed Council roll he would never have entered the Assembly Mr VALE -I should have come to Collingwood Mr MIRAMS-The hon. member was welcome to come there He (Mr Mirams) did not want to hold the seat one day longer than he enjoyed the confidence of his constituents. He would not be a party to saddling the country with a bill which would be an utter failure as a measure of reform, and if his constituency withdrew its confidence from him because he was true to his pledges, the sooner he went out of Parliament the better (Hear, hear.) He had never heard of a case in which a constituency had rejected a member because he was true to his pledges Mr MCINTYRE I was (Laughter) Mr MIRAMS said he would support the Government if they could show that there was any hope that the Liberal party would be represented in the new Council On the one side they had facts, and on the other mere fancies Could they expect to have more overwhelming expressions of public opinion in the future than they had had in the past If they could not over awo a Council elected by 30,000 voters only how could they hope to overawe one elected by half the population He had been challenged by the Ministerial press to say what he would do under the circumstances of the present hour. It was not incumbent on him to say what he would do All he was called upon to deal with was the bill now before them. He was returned to support a particular measure, and he had not been absolved from his pledges The meeting in Collingwood told him as distinctly as possible to vote against the proposals of the Council He asked for a clear and distinct vote, and the furthest that any one dare to go in the way of compromise was to propose that our representative be asked to accept a measure of progressive reform. There was no progressive measure under consideration The question was, the Council bill or the. Government bill, and the temporiBiiig resolution was withdrawn in favour of one which directed him to follow his own judgment The meeting did not act in ignorance, for he stated what his judgment was viz., not to accept the Council proposal He accepted the resolution as a distinct in struction to vote against the proposal of the Council If the Government did not stand by their amendments he hoped the bill would be thrown out He should support the amendments to be moved by the Government, and when the amendments came back he should vote straight against the Government if they let them drop and wished to accept the Council s proposal (Hear, hear.) Mr. BERRY, who seconded the motion for the adjournment pro forma said that the hon. member had rendered the success of the amendments less probable, by his speech, than it was 24 hours ago An impartial spectator who heard the hon member complain about the bushels of mistakes made by the leader of the party in the last four years would almost imagine that he belonged to the Opposition Yet there was not one of the acts the hon member characterised as mistakes which he would not have been prepared to justify, at the time, as acts of wisdom The impartial observer would not wonder at his (Mr Berry a) want of success as leader of the party, if told to regard the hon. member for Collingwood as a fair specimen of the party by whom he was supported If the on member had confined his remarks to the question now before the House whether they should accept or reject this must lated Reform Bill he would have been listened to with patience and respect but he went back over the history of the last four years, and heaped abuse on him (Mr Berry ) as leader of the Liberal Party, because " he had made mistake after mistake "and all those years he had no Morgenthau siastic supporter than the hon. member throughout every one of the actions which the hon. member now condemned How did they know he was sincere now How did they know that the hon. member would not turn round two years hence and say " You should not have believed me' Might be not Eaj, You ought to have understood that I spoke by contraries When I know you were wrong I told you you were right, so when I told you you were wrong you ought to have known that I thought you were right I meant just the opposite of what I said Not only had the hon. member challenged the wisdom of the actions of the Liberal Government during the last four years, but he had been cheered by members who were in his (Mr Berry's) Government, and shared with him the responsibility of the actions now condemned The lion mern her had been cheered by some of his (Mr Berry s) late colleagues, and in this matter they stood alone No one expressed the views they held except the avowed oppo rents of the Government. The attitude of the leader of this present movement was to nimaltogetherinexplicable The hon member here referred to was lately his colleague, and more than that, in the recent conference he counselled the Government to adopt this concession (Hear, hear) How could they hope to win if he did not receive loyal support ' Mr GRANT -You want to give up the rights of the House. Mr. BERRY What rights do we give up' If passed to morrow it won't affect one of our rights He did not object to the narrative the hon member for Collingwood had given of the events of the past four years He was glad to bear his own opinions quoted, because he had not changed them one iota The hon member said it was a mistake not to deal with reform in 1877-8 instead of in 1878-9 The party was pledged to secure payment of members in 1877-8 The hon. member should be the last to say they should have taken reform first and payment of members afterwards Was he not as eager as any one that the latter question should be fought first? Did he ever whisper that he should prefer reform ' It was by abstain ing from forcing on reform in the first session that he (Mr Berry) carried payment of members, and not only did he carry it, but be successfully maintained the privileges of the Assembly as they had never been maintained before Now that he had enjoyed the proceeds of victory for three years the hon. member turned round and told him that as leader of the party he had made a mistake he did not know that anything could be more contemptible than for a man to stand by the party for four years, to attend every caucus, to support every action, and now to bring forward a hash of all the objections put forward by the Opposition at the time. There was nothing new in the hon. member a speech They had heard it all from the OrpoBilion long ago He thought that if the hon member, who had been prominent in the party had chosen to be fair, he might have stated the case very differently In spite of many disadvantages-a bad harvest, commercial depression, the attacks of the propertied classes, which were of an uni recedented character-for three years the party kept their colours nailed to the mast As long as they were custodians of the country a privileges they never flinched It was not until the general election of February 1886, when they were defeated, that they ever thought of changing their policy The bill they then submitted to the country contained all the essential features of the first hill and it was rejected on account of the 6th clause be great was the danger to which the defeat of February, 1880, exposed the liberal party that if reasonable wisdom and tact had been shown by the Conservative Government which followed them, they would not only have had a reform bill carried like the present one, but a provision which would have destroyed the financial powers of the Assembly- theelnni nation clause, which was to allow the Council to dictate to the Assembly what items should appear in the Appropriation Bill It was only by the merest good luck-by circumstances almostprovidential-that this country escaped a settlement of reform which would have amounted to a complete surrender of all that the liberals had ever contended for If the hon member had wished to be consistent and just he should not have failed to point out that between this bill, however bad, and the bill of the Service Government there was this difference that it did not touch the I Constitution Act in one particular as regarded the rights of the Assembly But the hon member said that it was worse than the ber vice Bill Mr MIRAMS -I quoted your own words Mr BERRY would have accepted the Service bill without the elimination clause, for the sake of peace and that was all he said. The elimination clause was the bribe by which the Council was to be induced to accept the bill Even if reform was not settled as they all would like this bill would give them more substantial reform than they could hope for in any other way Why was it that the conservatives put their plausible programme before the country in February, 1886 a programme collected bit by bit out of discussions in the House ' Their object was to outbid the Liberal party that was where their great danger was, and they were beaten, but the other side had offered their measure in order to destroy that of the Liberal party, which was more thorough in the matter of reform The Service party picked out bits from various previous measures, which had been before the country and thought they had a scheme which would defeat the other side at the ballot box, and they succeeded in that view, but they would never have offered such terms to the country but for the much more thorough reform the Liberal party were attempting to get Then in July the country escaped almost providentially the in action of the Service scheme upon them (Laughter and ironical cheers ). The Liberal party then had to consider what programme they should go to the country upon and very naturally desired to have the most liberal one ! they could dense It was fortunate for him (Mr Berry) that a gentleman who was a member of that House, in his desire to injure the Government had disclosed a secret which he (Mr Berry) would not otherwise have mentioned, and he thanked that hon member (Mr M'Kean) for having told the House that at the caucus he (Mr Berry) did not go for the present Reform Bill, but would have preferred going to the country on the old Reform Bill he submitted in the previous February (Mr M KEAN -"Or without any reform ) He almost stood alone in this view then, but he thought the country should know that he endeavoured as far as he could to influence the party and the country in the direction of the reform he thought necessary He was then overruled, but he did not think it necessary to stand up for any particular crotchet of his own, and he did what he asked hon. members the other night to do-he considered whether the party were not more likely to be right than he was Well, in July they were returned, and their measure was brought into the House. If there was anything wrong with it, why did not the hon member for Collingwood abuse it then, for two-thirds of his speech this present night had been levelled at the bill' The hon member had said the bill, with the Councils amendments, would make the Council stronger, but as first introduced into the Assembly it would make it stronger still, for it would broaden the franchise most materially, and make it much more national He had endeavoured to do the best he could to carry out the lines of the bill, and until the conference he had not the slightest intention of accepting the proposals then made. Did the hon. member for Collingwood want him to stand there like week and a stone, and not look around him' Did he want him to sacrifice the party in an insane attempt to do something he could not do Why did not the hon member tell the House what he would do himself I If the hon. member would tell him he could pass a more thorough reform bill he would resign next day, and for the Governor send for the hon member ( Hear hear and laughter ) Let the hon member give some guarantee he could do something better than he (Mr Berry) could do he had no jealousy and would sit behind the hon member if he could show he could bring forward a better reform bill He was indifferent to the denouncement of the hon. member but why should the hon member denounced the 38 members forming the Government party' And what was the hon. member going to Bay to the popular party and the liberal press ' No member knew better than the hon. member for Collingwood that there was not a single journal that had supported the Government for the past four years which had not now advanced the view that the concession should be made Had those journals been wrong in their past conduct and were they hypocrites ' Did they denounce the action which be (Mr Berry) had taken in the past ' Did the hon. member for Collingwood think all the party united under the Government had not as much judgment as he had himself ' (Laughter ) He would ask the hon. member to consider the meeting the other night at Collingwood the hotbed of democracy Would there not have been binding resolutions and amendments passed there if the majority of the persons present had not thought that on the whole the party had done all they could in a long and weary fight and that it was wise and politic to take this at the present moment not because they or he believed in it or were satisfied with it but as an instalment and with the view that they should never cease their agitation until they placed the constitution of the country on a fair and proper basis The new member for Collingwood was not present at the gathering at North Melbourne c but if he 1 ud been he might have noticed the feeling which greeted the announcement he (Mr I Lerry) made when he said that he thought it I better to take this as the stepping stone to something better There was not a murmur when be said that and he never received a grander ovation than he received that night it with the exception of only one or two branch leagues all the party had expressed their con under ce in the Government desiring at the same time that they should secure the amendments which the Government intended to make on the amendments of the Council He maintained that if the party in the House, were united they could now get the £10 all 1 round franchise, and if they did not secure that the real reason would be that there were men sitting on the Government side pre tender g to support them who were in their hearts as much opposed to them as the members on the Opposition side were How could the Government dictate terms when they were not sure they could depend on a majority to support them' Mr M KEAN -You should haveaonethat when you had 00 at your back (Hear hear) AN Holy MEMBER -He never wanted to do it Mr Bl RRY desired simply to state what all the Liberal press and almost all the Liberal party in the House and the country desired them to consent to They were now to get the provinces divided and the term of office reduced and were not both these gains ' Mr LONGMORE-They were offered four years ago Mr BERRY -Nothing of the kind of this bill was ever offered before The franchise was never cut down lower than £10 lease holders and £20 freeholders Mr MURRAY SMITH -TheCouncilthem selves came down to fly freeholders Mr BERRY- No it was £20 freeholder and £40 leaseholders Now it was £10 free holders and £25 occupiers if no better terms were offered They could now get 11 provinces instead of six six years tenure of office instead of 10, and £10 freeholders and he would say again that if the party were united and to be depended upon they could get £10 occupiers and certainly he would vote for that to the last Mr M KEAN -V c will stick to you if you do (Hear hear ) Mr Bl RRY said he would vote for the £10 all round franchise He would give no other vote He believed that everyone of his colleagues would say the same ( Hear hear from the Corner and won by did you not say that long ago ) Mr. M KEAN -It is a pity you did not say that a week ago Mr BERRY said he did not think it necessary to protest When he said they would he left the amendments all but two or three he understood what those amendments were aid the Government would vote for what they had intimated If they could secure that and be believed they could secure it the bill would be a reasonable settlement but he agreed at once that anything short of £10 would not be a reasonable settlement and would only leave on the Liberal party the i security of attempting a further reform at no distant date inking the whole matter he believed that this was better than the old thing or to having to start again detail with reform in wherever there were now 1 000 electors for the Council the bill as amended by the Council would add 2 COO Would hon. members say that that was a misfortune' Were they likely to have more obstructive Council if they had three voters to every one they had now supposing the amendments the Government intended to propose were accepted Even if there were to be only three voters where there was one now, he would venture to say the results of the elections would be more favourable to the Liberal party than they had been in the past They had had four years experience of the strength of the South end and when they considered the actual strength of the Council how could it be s l roi ger than it was now (Hear hear) What had the Government left undone and how could anything more have been done than had been done ' If anyone could point out to him how he could get a more satisfactory Reform Bill than this he would take his advice and go for it at once if any hon members blamed the Government for taking a IB measure as it was he would tell them it at no men were more largely responsible for that action than the gentlemen now opposing the course the Government were taking Those gentlemen forced the Government at Christmas, without a recess to go on unprepared with this reform They were now at a disadvantage in having to consider reform only one month before the close of the financial year Could any Government or der that circumstance give such careful consideration to the question before them as they could if they had been allowed to meet in June of this year and had the time between then and Christmas to ded with it' (Laughter ) Hon members must not blow hot and cold They could not tell the Government at Christmas that they ought to settle reform and then tell them at mid-winter it was not necessary to settle it If those hon. members he was referring to had given support to the Government and followed the lead of the party as they should have done reform would not have been touched this season but would have been dealt with next session with a far better prospect of being satisfactorily settled Mr M K AN -All the Reform Leagues wanted it settled Mr BERRY was very much afraid what ever the Reform Leagues desired that the wish of some hon members to have it settled without a recess arose not so much from a desire to have it settled as from the desire to keep the Government in a position of Geo I army and danger to see what might happen from it (Hear hear) If the Government failed in achieving what the party really desired the responsibility would largely rest on those hon. members who would not grant a recess to a Government who had been 18 months constantly before the House or the country and who never had the proper time to mature their policy He would not say more except that he desired to have the qualification of members of the other House fixed at £100 and an all round franchise of £10 for voters he desired the latter chiefly because he did not want to see any distinction introduced between two classes of voters He would rather have taken £15 all round than £10 and £25 for he did not like the principle of saying that a man with a freehold was better than a man with out one That was why he appealed to the Opposition the other night and asked them, in consideration of all the circumstances of the case, to stand firm to the Government in the interests of the Assembly and of a true settlement of the question and give their votes for an all round £10 franchise, be cause if they could have secured that unanimously in the Assembly he had no doubt they would have secured it elsewhere He could only say that he took the course with perhaps as much pain as any man could experience who desired and hoped four years ago to obtain a much more thorough measure of reform He was not discouraged, however If they did not gain much, they gave up nothing If they could use the constitution now, they could use it hereafter A solid majority of the Assembly could use the same power against the new Chamber that they could exercise at present if ever that new chamber attempted to usurp their power Mr M'KEAN What about the two Mmia term for the Council ? Mr BERRY -He would ask the House to put that question to the one side for the present, but would bring in a separate measure next session, which would provide for giving two Ministers to the Council, whilst the Ministry would not be compelled to fill up these offices At the same time, that bill would not take away from the number of the Assembly a Ministers, and the amount provided by the Constitution Act for the payment of the members of the Government would not be increased Hitherto there had always been more departments than Ministers There had scarcely been a Government that had not given two or more to one of their number With regard to the other two points, he hoped that, as the Assembly had already conceded as much in the interests of peace, they would receive a solid vote for them from the Opposition, and that the Government would be met in the same spirit by hon. members on their own side Mr GRANT said the Chief Secretary had laid stress on the fact that he (Mr Grant) was deposed at the conference for a compromise Circumstances, however, had occurred since then which had altered the aspect of the question There had been a usurpation on the part of the Upper House in asserting their right to reject the Land Tax Bill by postponing it until Tuesday Mr MURRAY SMITH said he mentioned during the remarks of the Chief Secretary that a tin J freehold franchise had been once covered by the Council, but he had since found that he was wrong The bill of 1874 fixed it at £20 but the proposal originally submitted by Sir Charles bidden, the leader of the other Chamber, was for a kVi freehold franchise and it was altered during, its pas gate through the Council Mr 'WRl.N.OIe. did not think much can betterment was to be derived from the speeches of the hon. member for Collin" wood and the Chief Secretary They threw however a great deal of light on the way in which parties were formed and broken up in this colony. The hon. member for Collingwood had made a most explicit statement that time after time he was giving his consent to that which he really condemned and disbelieved IhiBnaa only eclipsed by the Chief Secretary when he assured both sides of the House that he as a leader, did not believe in the propositions he placed before the House. Mr. BERRY -Do you believe in them Mr \\\1 IXOî*,-I believe they are the best we can get Mr BURRÏ So do I (Hear hear ) Mr. 'WRIXON -The position of a private member who said that a proposition made was the best he could feet was iridelydilfereut from that of a leader of a party who made to the country a proposal in which he did not believe I Then, again, did the hon. member for Collingwood really mean to say that he had only now discovered for the first time the fact that the party who claimed the name of 1 social had been inconsistent with the principles of liberalism ' He had himself reminded the House of two instances one being the embassy to England, which mf ringed the very first principles of intelligent liberalism as it amounted to an appeal to the Secretary of State to interfere with the Government of this colony, and the other, the permission given to the Council to alter a money bill to divide the measure for the payment of members so that they made it apply only to the Lower Chamber He (Mr W Dixon) whilst agree ing with the Liberal party in protesting against the class character of the other Chamber, had also a B maintained that during the last three or four years the liberal party had been led in the wrong direction Their leaders had made it more a class cry than an intelligent principle The inevitable consequence was that in con latencies occurred Hon members however had not to consider at present whether or not the liberal party had been inconsistent, but whether the proposal made by the Council was a good one or not He failed to see any reason why they should not accept it they had to deal, they should remember with a powerful House which already existed in the constitution of the country, and which had successfully re- visited the attempt to reform it of a Government backed up by 50 or 60 supporters. The question, then they had to answer was Are we justified in rejecting a proposal to liberalise the Council to the extent of enabling it to represent a majority of the ratepayers' What other suggestion had we, in practice been able to find out If the new Chamber worked well with its 12 000 electors, he would leave it as it was An IION MtMuhit-How long will it take to find out the effect Mr WRIXON-Nine years and that was not long for the settlement of such a question As soon as defects were found out they would beableto jet from constituencies representing a majority of rate payers any reform wanted It must be remembered that although nominally the constituent body was only 105 000 it BJ in utilised largely with the great mass, who were not immediately ei franchised He should be sorry to think the position of the Liberal I art was such that it could not get any ice reset tam es 11 there were a member B [qualified man but he would prefer to see the qualification altogether abolished Ison the House had something,, practical to Í,rc8p for the first time the open ortunity ought not to be allowed to slip Notwithstanding the vaticinations of the hon. member for Avoca the powers of this House as regarded finance and the appointment of Ministers would remain untouched The hon member for Avoca had expressed his views too late for he had previously conceded the ratepayers roll and he was a Minister in the M'Culloch Government, which proposed to reduce the franchise of the Upper House The motion for the adjournment of the House was then negatived Mr BERRY proposed to proceed with the Council s amendments Mr LONGMORE asked for an adjourn- ment until next day Had he not been taken by surprise he would have said a few words before the motion was negatived Mr L L SMITH also objected to the bill being, proceeded with Mr Bl RRY was willing to adjourn on the understanding that the amendments were dealt with on the following evening Mr BENT -I will not consent for one I Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY asked the Chief Secretary whether there was any possibility of going into committee of supply on the next night? Mr BERRY thought not as the discussion on the Reform Bill would probably not be over until after the clock It the bill passed through on the next evening there would, however be plenty of time to take supply next Tuesday when the Council were considering the amendments made to the Reform Bill Mr MUNRO suggested that the Government should if in earnest, go on with the measure, and let the House sit until it was settled Mr FRANCIS said that the majority of members on the Opposition side would supPort the Government in getting the bill through Mr BENT explained that he would not stay all the next night to help the Chief Secretary through with his reform abortion 'The debate was then adjourned BILLS DISCHARGE D The following bills were discharged - Salaries Reduction Bill, Supreme Court Jurisdiction and Procedure Bill, Mining Boards Abolition Bill, Plural Voting Abolition Bill Management of Towns Act Amendment Bill, telephonic Communication Lill, Miners Rights Title Bill, Bankers Books Evidence Law Amendment Bill Game Act Amendment Bill Plural Voting at Election of the Council Abolition Bill, and Judges Salaries Reduction Bill ADJOURNMENT The House adjourned at 5 minutes past 11 until half-past 4 p in to day
