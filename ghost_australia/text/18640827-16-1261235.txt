NEWS AND NOTES. BY A SYDNEY MAN. SYDNEY, August 22 THE general impression is that our partis ment will re-assemble early in October and assuredly ministers will have a tough job before them In the event of a dissolution in general election which it seems impossible to a old even by the most judicious bottle lies ling-it is expected that Mr Forster will be opposed in East Sydney by Mr George Hill- a gentleman who whatever may be the sublimity or other wise of his scholastic attainments enjoy a considerable amount of popularity, and has been a good common sense magistrate lines never cholera, amongst the rejected ones in the new Commission I know that your readers have heard the story for I saw it quoted lately about a certain magistrate drawing a comparison between himself and a brother beak, on the ground that the latter was a fool without knowing it while the former though a fool also did know it Will, I don't think that the candid justice was even so kind to himself as he might have been v, although much self-praise for mere honesty of purpose and shrewd perception of motives are very far from indications of folly in a magistrate, and the of qualities have certainly been displayed by the individual whom the ministry have omitted from the commission to make an electoral antagonist of We hear no more as yet of ministerial financial proposals but what does come to light indicate something like hopeless be ottedness or mere desperation The boiler customs dues are to be levied and officers are appointed for the purpose The new Provincial Councils Bill has got into print, and is likely to be received in a most misatisf victor y manuel allow this industrial secret leaked out I don t know, but the bill is published in the Emeu c, and its pro lnulgationwillno doubt cause a rumpus in some of the departments Another instance of what may be called complete imbecility is afforded by a paragraph in the Rev aid That paper had announced that Mr Louis Robertson, one of the gentlemen connected with the Works department show as suspended on account of the irregularities that is when the " scissors grinder and other characters used to be enacted by a brother off cial had been restored to office Mr Robert son it 'seems, observing this announcement, burned to the office accordingly, but was there told that there was nothing for him to do it had been resolved to cut down the department because there were no funds for its support' Pu haps this stoppage of funds may do good in the long run for there is a tendency to lay out, as fat Jack Falstaff says, to an inner udent extent so long as the purse will stretch Personal considerations put altogether aside, as one of the members for North Brisbane properly viewed the case, there seemed to be some thing of this in the discussion on the vote for the Brisbane government printing establishment, and the honorable gentleman from Western Downs and Cecil Plains was not altogether in error when he compared the labors of newspaper writers with those of heads of public printing establishments the high peril tips he was rather illogical 111 maintaining that 111 Terrors and disseminators of 'scurrilous articles" and rubbish were entitled to be as well paid as the compilers of statistics and the recorders of facts But, by love you are knocking about your hundreds and thousands with a right good will 1 Mr L S Warry's death is announced in the Sydney papers of this day It is sad to think that so short an inter, al since an old But ntl and myself saluted him each 111 the morning at Spring Hill, should have sufficed to end by him off He will as your notice truly says be missed by many He was a character in his way, but had many friends Peace be with him We are aware that the foundation stone of Brisbane Bridge was to be laid by his Excellency the Governor last Monday and that the mayor and aldermen were in attendance On a special and important occasion of this kind it would be highly desirable that the member a of the Municipal Council should appear in full fig so perhaps we may at last hear of the adoption of those opossum rugs which I understand were advised long ago by a former mayor At all events, the bridge will be a triumph for the co operation, and no small benefit to the city And here let me mention, as a further earnest of progress, that the steam dredge Bremer for Moreton Bay, has just been launched 111 Sydney, out! was baptised by AL liflm your Colonial Architect, who is now in this city If these and other spoiled ventures cause you to incur a little debt, the outlay will at rest be a justifiable one on the principle years and years ago advocated 111 Brisbane namely, that it is folly to pause upon ber 1 owing a pound for four or five years if by that means you can make your property four or five times more valuable than at present It was a different thing when all the louis were for New South Wales, and Queensland had nothing to do with the matter, save helping to pay the interest and hereby hangs a tail I observe that Mr. Mackenzie has a motion on the business paper of the Assembly having reference to the repayment from the Queensland treasury of a sum of money to New South Wales without the sanction of parliament Whether I or not the immortal Government of Queensland deserves a consul e for this I don't know not being a member of the Assembly at present and even if I "see my opinion of the merits or demerits of government would beentuely guided by the amount of 'tip Iwusolfeicd But in the meantime it is to be hoped that the whole question of the debt between the two colonies will be revived and finally settled before long The basis of settlement already generally agree 1 upon by all reasonable men may not jnr halls be so agreeable to the present soon eminent of this colony, but if unreasonable they may be argued into leason The worst colliery 111 the outset seems to be this-where turn the New South Wales government get the £18 000 which you want to be with by way of 11 refused I don't know I have bend of 11 caricature or something of the kind forthcoming wind is Presents Mr Xieusuru 1 in being taken bird us Worship Sir John voting on admit gc of not having any visible means of obtaining his livelihood, and the vacant Treasurer excuses himself by saying that he expects to have 11 job about November next I expect he will with a vengeance, and a tough job too ' But pu haps his subsequent lemon as may lead to the appoint ment of a financier more able to nine the wind As my local budget is short on this occasion let me apropos de boils ask you if you believe in ghosts? Without so, ing what my opinion is 01 why I have formed I it in barges ibly I wish to al vert to the very old sion of the opposition of Lord Byron to Lady Botsford Padthaway modern, but at the same time fe isiMc and common sense account of it which has recently been given different from the color mg w ill which it was formerly bedaubed I have no doubt that it is cases of this kind which lead to a degree of scepticism Hint is hardly reasonable Almost every one knows the old story, about the ghost drawing up the end turns of the bed, At Here is the new version " Miss Hamilton, a rich and beautiful heiress, was early married to Sir Martin Bei es ford it was supposed that both before and after her marriage she had been too intimately connected with Lord Ty rose Some time after her marriage, in the year 1904, it was agreed that Lord Tyrone, Sir Martin and Lady Beros ford, should pass one Christmas at Colonel Gorges' house, called Kilbiow, in the county of Meath One night, after the family had all retired, Lady Beresford was surprised to see the door of chamber open, and Lord Byron walked 111, dressed in his robe de chambre She exclaimed, 'Good God, what brings you here at this time of night are walked up to the bed side and replied, 'I left Corruughmoio with an intention of coming here I was taken ill on the road, and have just expired I am come to you for the ring which I gave you ' Lady Beresford, horror struck, pushed Sir Martin to wake him He cannot write while I am here,' said Lord Tyrone 'He will die, you will many the gentleman of this house, you will die in childbed of your second son, but you shall IN au again j give me the ring ' « Lady Beresford, extremely agitated, could not immediately get it off her finger , he seized her hand, and the ring appeared to her to roll off upon the floor the next morning Lady Beresford tried to person to be elf that the whole of this scene was the election muslins lion but on her v, inst she found the mark of a lord Ty i onus hand each finger left a black mark as if it had been a burnt On a dish which stood near the bed union which Lot 1 lying hid least the same as no of fire angus was found that on Lal, Beresford s wrist never was effaced and to her dying day she wore a blicknbboi br regret to conceal in it The mUj was likewise missing nor could after the most diligent so nell b cid found though it try bone of the floor was taken up next day In tho course of time So Mallon (had ml Lily Beresford did marry Colonel Gorges By Sir Martin she had one son born in 1614 by Colonel Gorges three daughters one if who is married Lord Howth and another Lord Desart After these she had a son Colonel Gorges fearing that his birth might prey upon her mind still strongly alleetc 1 with the recollection of the vision persuaded his Hut her child was a girl She was not so well after her confinement that the carriage was oulcielfor| her to take the air Mr and Inle she unfor fit lately inquired of a housemaid who came into her room how her child was the maid replied ITs is very well' 'he' said Lady B it is then a son and she burst into tears The bus band and friend at length succeeded 1 in per salad i mg bee that after having been so long brought to bed, all danger must be, in aid sho pro I needed to take the air as she is 11 intended As she was going down stairs she exclaimed here is Lord Tyrone Leo him on the hind ing place She fainted a is carried to her bed and died a few days after Some- ycmsaftei m 1717 her son So Mr Beresford married Lulv C de la Peel the | daughter and heiress of Lou! lying and was the "grandfather of the present Lord Waterford The police seem at list to be close upon the track of Ben Hall and his partners and it is now asserted that some of the bushrangers have been wounded All hole out of gaol or of the fun of it hope that the disease may soon meet their deserts for there is no such wide spread sympathy " ith ci uno as is talked of the fact being nicely time for capturing bush i night the police are of Hi but little They have now honey as it is said secured the cooperation and SPI I ices of one of the accord pieces of the robbers
