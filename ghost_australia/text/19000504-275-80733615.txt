Perhaps he knows : or Mr. Fhipps. Do- you know where fie lives?'*1 'Phipps V repeated the major slowly. 'Look here, Chester, it is none of my business ; but if you take my adyice, you will have ro dealings with that Mr. Phipps. There is something altogether wrong about the fellow. It seemed to me tnat lie was a man playing a part, . don't you know.' 'No, I don't. What do you mean?' , asked Gerald. ''Well, it struck me— and I think so now — that Mr. Phipps was not what he pretended to be. To .speak frankly arid plainly, Ibelisv* ifae man is a-B'&i;»aped criminal, or something of the sort, hid ing tinder a false name! I was really extraordinary the jmins he took yester day, on our aiTiva& -tt Bristol; ; 'to ''escape 'observation.

'It was my life against yoars and those whom you had with you. You did quite right— the only think pos sible. And now, if you will Isten to me, I will tell you my stoiy— tell you some thing that may,-perhaps, astonish you.' /To Quaritch Gerald was frank. He told him everything— of, poor Sybil's story of the hand with the ringed finger, arid how, he himself had found the door of her statet-room locked on the outside. Quaritoh listened in. amazemeht and indignation top. great for words. '- ''Whyi it is' murder— ai cold-blooded, ?fiendish murder i' he cried, when Ger ald had finished. ', ' ?';' ??''' '?:????' .

' - :. 'Mr. Phipps — -' '., , \ 'Bloomfieldj' con'ected Phipps, ad vancing into the room and closing the door behind him. , 'My dear Mr. Ches^ ter, allow me to congratulate, you on your marvellous escape!' 'And you on yours,' responded Ger ald. 'But what the deuce— — ' Sudr denly the memory of Major Hammers-, leign s warning orossea nis mina, ana his manner at once grew frigid.

' Phipps not longer' ? exists. il& was but a creature, created for my convenience. Mr. Phipps, of the For ests and Woods Department, is defunct. Have I your permission to sit down.?' 'By all means !' said Gerald ; but he remained standing, while his ? strange visitor comfortably settled vhim'self in the easiest chair infthe room. 'I owe you an explanation, Mi'. Ches ter,' said Phipps— or Bloomfield, after a pause. 'But, to tell the truth, the ex planation is such ai1 long one' that I scarcely know where' to begin.' 'I can hardly] make a suggestion,' said Gerald, 'That is so; but excuse the liberty I take, especially a»s it is your own room. Won't you sit down?' Half smiling, half angry at the man's coolness, Gerald dipped into a chair. .Liierewas sueuce lor as lew moments, and. then Bloomfield wav.ed his hand im pressively. 'I have made up1 my mind,' he said. 'I will begin in Brazil.' 'Mad— evidently mad !?- thought Ger ald.. .

'I am, speaking the truth, Mr. Ches ter, 'and' I must beg you not to inter rupt. Now, to continue : Unfortunately, for himself, Baron Vasca one day made the acquaintance ot' ait American— or, at lease, so he called himself. '?? Though the fellow had a mixture of blood inhis veins, this man, who called himself Pro fessor Byw&ter;, was a quasi-scientist— a man who dabbled in bacteriology, astro nomy, geology, and numerous other pur suits of the kind 1 but his principal forte was- hypnotism-. 'Ah! I see a look of interest .onj your face, Mr. Chester. Well, as I say,NVasca made Bjnvater's acquaintance, and took an interest in the man, and invited him to come to his place. He went, and took his son with him^-a' ' powerful, | broad-sihouldered, young f elloiw, with a i spice of the demon in him. 'Whether By water practised his black art on. the- unfortunate Vasca, or whether it was sheer infatuation on the baron's part, will probably never be. known ; but very soon after the Amerioan had taken up his residence in Vasoa's house, a strange ?change came over the baron. He followed ? BjTVAter about like a dog, gave way tohim in everything — in short, was completely subjugated to his'will. 'By Bywater'e advice, Vasca convert ed the greater part of his large estates into money, and then quietly announced his intention of going to England. He went, acd arrived in England with his son. Now, listen, for here comes the extraordinary part of the 'story. When Vasca left Brazil he had no sou. He had never been married. 'When-he ar rived. in England, he had ai fully-grown son— a you nc; fellow of two or three amid twenty — ancf Professor Bywater had miraculously disappeared !' . 'Good heavens !'?/ cried Geraldv ''I see if. now. Vasca— the real Vasca— never reached England at all. ? It was that rascal Bywater, masqueiading im der Vasca.'s name !' To be Continued.^
