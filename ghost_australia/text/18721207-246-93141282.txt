THE CONSCIENCE AND FUTURE JUDG MENT, I sat alone with my conscience, In a place where time had ceased, And we talked of my former living In the land where the years increased. And I felt I should have to answer The question if put to no, And to face the answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, And things that I thought wore dead things Were alive with a terrible might. And the vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to face Along with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that theon was the future, But now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking Of the judgment day to be, But sitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a futuro To this land beyond the grave; But no one gave me an answer, And no one came to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would nover go by, For it was but the thought of my past life Grown into eternity. Then I awoke from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I knew the far.away warning Was a warning of yesterday. And I pray that I may not forget it, In this land before the grave, That I may not cry in the future, And no one come to save. And so I have learnt a lesson Which I ought to have known before, And which, though I learn it dreaming I hope to forget no more., So I sit alone with my conscience In the place where the years increase, And I try to remember the future In the land where Time will cease. And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful soo'er it be, That to sit alone with my conscience Will be judgment enough for me.
