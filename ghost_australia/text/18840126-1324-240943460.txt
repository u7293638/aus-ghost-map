Ibutnour. The Latest Important News- Foreign DENKJLKE.—A terrible tragedy has been enacted at Elsimore. It seems that the widow of the late Thomas P. Hamlet married her husband's brother, James Q. Hamlet. This so annoyed her son, Colonel Hamlet, that he took to hard drink, and, in a fit of delirium tremens, declared he saw the ghost of his father, the late Thomas P., an i that the ghost informed him that his father had been murdered by James Q. Colonel Hamlet had been affianced for some time to Miss Ophelia Polonius, daughter of Judge Polonins, of the Supreme Court of Denmark. Colonel Hamlet imagined he had heard a mouse behind a Bcreen, and, seizing a carving-knife from the dinner-table, plunged it into the screen, behind which Judge Polonius was concealed, to keep Colonel Hamlet from mischief. Judge Polonius was killed by the knife. An evening or so afterward, at some private theatricals, Colonel Hamlet behaved so ruddy that his mother, uncle, and Miss Ophelia Polonius were compelled to leave the room. Colonel Hamlefs conduot eo preyed upon Miss Ophelia that she drowned herself. At her burial Colonel fiamlet jumped into the grave, and her brother following him, a most unseemly fight took place, resulting in the two drawing knives and stabbing each other, and, just before dropping, Colonel Hamlet stabbing his nncje, James Q. Hamlet. All three died. — Puch.
