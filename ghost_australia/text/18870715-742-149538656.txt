ALBERTON. To the Editor. am, — Under the present existing circum stances here I think a few words from a disin terested party on tbe Btrange delusion that seems to have entered the cranium of a certain individual re tampering with a certain battery, which for the present shall be nameless, will be or service. Tins 'craze, tor 1 can call it by no other name, seems to be leading to rather a serious matter now. although at €rst it was laughed at. In the first place it is hardly safe for any person to pass the place at night, but not for want of light, as it is highly illuminated I believe, and it ib rattier a calumny on the place in general, as I am sure from what I can see of the inhabitants they are incapable of such actions. But I would advise tbe party to stop such nonsense, or else some of these days he will be letting a word slip that will cost him more than his battery did. Trusting to hear no more of this humbug, and thanking you in anticipation. — Yours, etc., Panic's Ghost.
