Unlike Derl)3R day, tho weather on Tuesday was bright and hot-too warm, in fact. Day had hardly brokcnbeforo the people bogan to roll out to Flemington. Shortly after breakfast time,!and from that until <J o'clock, every road to the course was crowded with visitors, while thousands made the journey on foot from the -surrouuding suburbs. Tho railways were very heavily taxed. Tho returns from the Spencer-street station show that 28,000 people were conveyed to tho course, against 26,010 last .'year. From Footsci ay there were 6600 ; so that tho rail- ways conveyed;about 85,000 people, tho receipts for which aro £9416 Gs, against £8515 8s last year. This goes to show that the attendance wan far larder than on any previous occasion. Tho wind and hot sun during tho morning dried the ground up, putting a hard surface on it, thus making it very fast, as shown in the time returned for eaöh race. Tho various events on the card did not, with the exception of the Cup, produce good finiehse. The first two races wore " inoráis," and Ruby won thc hurdle oveut very easily, though had nothing happened it is just possible she would have had a hard fight. Tho Cup wus a keen coiftcst all the way. First Chester fairly wore his rider out, and made the pace a cracker as long as he could stay, then St. John, Minerva, Cerise and Blue, and Metal eaoh had a turu at it, and at tho homo turn Minorra and Sheat Anchor hold command. The finish was a groat oue, and according to tho judge Sheet Anchor only got home a he;id iu front of the Caulfield Cup winner, Who iu turn beat Trenton'half a head, and he defeated Norderifeldt thc samo distance for third, while Minerva was right up alongside. Lord .Exeter had to be led in, having put his fetlock out in tho journey. The Nursery Handicap proved a soft thing for Yellow Jacket, and Merrimu showed such different form in'the Yan Yean to what'he did in the Coburg Stakes ou Saturday, that it was a matter for geuerel remark in the paddock.

First Prince and Isonomy jumped away in front, followed by Baron Neckar, and Parwan last. Along tho river stretch i the leaders kept well together, and at tho end of a couplo of furlongs Baron Nectar had joined Isonomy, Porchanco being third. Thetbres got on terms when.passing the abattoirs, but a few yards farther on Pare'-umco fell back.

They enme on nil in one solid line,.' with Trenton slightly in advance na they entered the , course, attended by Thunderbolt, Arsenal, Lord Exeter, ' Prometheus, with Yellow Hammer thus early hi : tho roar. The paco was very merry up to-tho distance, ut which point Prometheus had forged to the front, attended . by Lord Exeter and " First Cheater, forming the front rank. Nearing tho stand First Chester went to 'tho front, and at that point was lead« iug Prometheus, who was closely followed-by Thunderbolt, Nordenfeldt, Trenton, Minerva," Velocipede,'Blink Bonny, Dunlop, with LorcLlVilton and Yellow -Hammer bringing np the rour. BJö'ünd tho river turn First Chester waa , going along at a tcreat paco in front of Thunderbolt, a .couple of lengths lu'froutof Prometheus, attended by Tren«. ton, Nordenfeldt, Minerva, Volocipcdo, and Plausible With ' the oxception that "Warwick got up amongst tho first half dozen, there was little alteration as they ran past the milo quarter post, aud-at tho bridgo Nordenfeldt had worked up to second place in front of Prometheus and Velocipede, (hen came Thunderbolt and Trenton. First Chester wai done with six furlongs from home, and Metal, who had been running up to his place in front for a few strides, but ho, in turn, was tackled by Velocipede,, Cerise and Blue, St. John, and Minerva, which were all well together at the sheds, whero Norden« ; feldt had fallen back. At tho half milo Minerva had dis« , posed of tho leader, and led round tito bond in front of Velocipede, Sheet Anchor, Nordenfeldt, Trenton, and Grace Darling, with Brown and Boso coming fast. Sheet Anchor and Minerva were first into tho straight, attended by Minerva, Nordenfeldt, : Grace Darling, Brown and Bose, Velocipede, and St. John. A terrific battlo now ensued. Ellis tried on . the inside; but was blocked by Shoet Anchor, and had to come on the outside. At tho distance Sheet Anchor had it won easily to appearances, but he died away, and only got home a head in front of Graoe Darling, with Trenton half a length away third. Then the same distance Nordonfeldt, Minerva, St. Lawrence, Lesbia, Acolyte, St. John, Velocipede, Motal, the last four being Yellow Hammer, Bosworth, Dunlop, and Thunderbolt, Time, Smin 29iscc. Tho Winnens a tug bay horse of great power and BUD«. stance, and looks more like a hurdle racer than a Gnp ' .winner. He was bred by Mr. John Field, of Tasmania. Ab threo years ho ransccond in tho Carrick Plate (2 miles and a distance), 7sh 91b, won by Stockdale, 7s191b ; was nowhere in the Launceston Cup and T.C. Handicap. At four years ho was second in tho Campania Plato (1J- mile), fist Gib, won by Barb, 7ST llb; third in Launceston Cup (1} mile), 7st 101b, won by Rhesus, Cst 121b; nowhere in Hobart Cup; third in Dorwent Plate (1{ mile), 6st 101b., won by Tho Assyrian, list ; second in Consolation Slakes (1 mile), Sst 101b, won by Don Quixote; second iu Deloraine Handicap (1J- mile), 8st 91b, won by Pride of tho Hills, 7st 21b; second in Flying Handicap (í mil«) 8st 101b, won by Bonny Scotland, 7st. At Syrs ho was third in tho Colebrook Plate, won by First Light; nowhere in Hobart Cup (If mile), 7st 01b, won by King of tho Vale, 7sfc 181b; second iu Goodwood Stakes, 7et 71b, won byQueeu.fist 71b; won President's Cup, list, wou Free Handicap 7BV 121b; Won Launceston Cup (1¿ milo) 7s141b, King of th» Tale, 9st 21b second, Blink Bonny, 7st third ; nowhere in T.

Newnn-.rket Handicap (î mile), 7st 71b, won by Coronet, 7st ; waa second in Aus- tralian Cup (2J miles), 7st 51b, won by Ring- wood, 7st 131b. At the A. J.C. Autumn Meeting was no- where in Doncaster Handicap (1 mile), Dst, won Dy St. Lawrence, 7st 71b ; nowhere in Sydney Cup (2 miles), Sst 8)b, won by Normanby, 6st 101b ; nowhere in City Handi oap (U mile), Est 51b, won by Merlin, Sst 121b; and nowhere in Placo Handicap (1J mile), Sst 31b, won by Moonsbee, 7st 101b. Prom the foregoing it will be seen that un;il Tuesday Sheet Anchor had never given public proof that he possessed great speed or staying power, save with one excoption, last autumn's Austra- lian Cup. Thus thc " Man in the Ring " of tho Melbourne ARGUS : It was a lively place just after tho tbirty-fivo riders caine in from the Cup raco. The janitor, however, would not have it that I was a jockey,and so tho retina of mymemory only presents tho play of " Confusion," from à hurried glimpse, in a stroll up and down. Thc winning jockey, O'Brien, in hi s green stripes, was surrounded by a myriad : of congratulating frieudF. Ho was " cool as a cucumber," J »ind did not amicav to think that ho had rloim an-.-fhinn- mi. expected, while all around tho hum of conversation I was loud nnd excited. I never saw euch a rush after a j .rinneras there was to see Sheet Anchor. Fully 200 spec- tators were around, in a broad ring, as he was rubbed down. Ho was not in the least exhausted, and indeed ho kept dancing about in a mauner which was in entire con- . trast to his reserved demeanor befc.ro accomplishing this tremendous feat of winning tho Melbourne Cup in unpre- ' cedented time. "Tako care of his beeWI" shouted tho rroom, as Sheet Anchor wheeled and created fresh rings for himself-new orbits as ono mny say. This is the third Sheet Anchor that has made a namo of some kind or another on tho ' Victorian turf. One was a flat rncsr, and another tho well-known gray steeplechaser. What a feeble cheer it was, '? whata ghost of a cheer, wheu Sheet Anchor passed Iho lawn aa tho winner. I heard it said that ho drank a bottle of wino before starting, as Proctor swallowed a bottle of whisky beforo he won tho Sandhurst Cup. Sbeet Anchor ls a stout-looking brown horse, with a lengthy tail, in defiance of John Osborne's dictum. Ho shows his teeth liberally when angered by such a crowd as the angry one which surrouuded him Tuesday afternoon.
