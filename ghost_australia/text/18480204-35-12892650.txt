ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. INCREASE OF WAGES BEYOND THE BOUNDARY. To the Editors of the Sydney Morning Herald. GENTLEMEN,' - There are various causes in operation why many grazing stations beyond the boundaries are so unprofitable to non-resi- dent proprietors, which would be otherwise if properly managed. these causes I will endeavour, from time to time, to point out, in the hope of their being remedied. The one I now beg to notice, is the practice which prevails in the greater part of the Liverpool Plains and Gwydir River districts, of feeding and lodging every man who says he is looking for work ; these men are every where supplied with beef and flour, the property of the proprietors of the stations, while the men there employed draw from the stores for them extra tea and sugar. It is astonishing with what hearty welcome these men are received into the huts ; wherever they go they are treated like mechanics on the " frame " in England standing out for an advance of wages ; all the employed contribute to assist them to them every door is open, and they may remain idle as long as they choose at many stations, on the pretence of sickness or blistered feet, (should their staying happen to be taken notice of by the party in charge), and then they have over some such excuse, generally a false one with those who really want employment, the understanding seems to be, never to accept of any offer of employment unless it be at higher wages than any one receives on the station, or at any rate, never under the highest ; the consequence is, wages are continually on the increase. Those men again, who scarcely ever work, who want no employment at all (since they can live nearly all the year at the stations in idleness), always demand more wages than they expect will be offered them at their leisure they walk off to the next station, assuring all the men on the one they have left, that their wages are too low, that they would be better paid in some other remote quarter, where they say they are bound for. In consequence of these representations, the men in time leave their employment, unless an advance of wages is submitted to, and as persons in charge have seldom any consideration about money matters, these extravagant demands are readily complied with. Another evil result arising out of this liberality (prodigality rather) with other men's goods is, these travellers, as already mentioned, being supplied with beef and flour as valueless, at least beef is considered so, as bullock drivers may take away what they choose, the men on the station are, as a matter of course, to supply them with tea and sugar ; this expense presses heavily on their wages in consequence they are compelled, and with justice, to demand high wages, and they are paid too, and thus it appears that in the end, the stockholder-the proprietor of the station, has to pay the piper, and at every turn, no matter what shape it may assume, he must pay-in fact his candles are all lighted at both ends he is drawn on to a large amount to pay wages rendered high by his own absurd conduct, in allowing his provisions to be prodigally given away to support a system of idleness and waste. It is the interest of every one who has property beyond the boundary, individually to make every effort to put a stop to it, otherwise this waste and idleness will increase, and wages from that cause alone will become higher and higher until the stations of non-residents in many cases will have to be given up, and the stock sold to those who will live on them and manage their own affairs ; with them the remedy is in their own hands, but to non-residents it is a more difficult matter ; but now since houses for the accommodation of travellers are being erected all over the country beyond the boundary, I think it only requires the proprietors of stations not on any pretext whatever to allow actions to be served out beyond what are just near Diary for the people in their employment to those interested in grafting stations it will be gratifying to know that one of the largest stockholders in the colony has made a decided stand against this waste of provisions for the support of travellers, being well aware of the evil consequence of rendering so many men as are continually prowling about independent of any employment, The following notice is posted up at the station huts On the Manila River : " NOTICE TO TRAVELLERS. " It is requested that travellers will understand that no extra rations of any kind are allowed by --, on his cattle station on the Manila, for the accommodation of the public. Superintendent." This notice also applies to another sort of travellers, (I mean gentlemen and persons above the labourer) who also cause a very great extra expenditure of stores, besides taking up the time of the men, and attention of the supervisor of the station, all of which the non-resident has to pay for it will be my task on another occasion to bring that class under special notice. I am, c, ONE OF YOUR SUBSCRIBERS, A WOMAN BURIED ALIVE.-Two or three weeks ago, the daughter of an old soldier, who resides in Miller-street, Glasgow, was seized with fever, and conveyed to one of the hospitals. The old man, of course, made frequent inquiries at the hospital as to the progress of the disease, and was pained to learn on every visit that his daughter was getting worse. At last he received the melancholy information that she was dead. The necessary arrangements were made for the funeral, and the body was interred in Sighthill Cemetery, on Thursday of last week. On Tuesday last, while the mother of the buried woman was engaged in her usual household avocations, the door slowly opened, and lo ! there entered, pale and emaciated, the figure of her dead daughter, which uttered the word " Mother." " You canna get in here-ye canna get in here !" exclaimed the affrighted mother, " your father buried you last week " And having thus endeavoured to lay the ghost, fainted On coming to her senses, and observing the unwelcome visitor sitting in the house, silt rushed down stairs to the workshop of her husband, exclaiming, in the same source of extreme terror, " Oh, the daughter ye buried last week is sitting up stairs ' and went off in another life When the old couple had recovered a little self possession, neighbours were called 111, the haunted house was entered, and there sat, not an in tensive, ill-bred ghost, but the veritable daughter, pale and thin, but as truly in life as ever she was Here was a mystery not easily to be solved at the moment, but subsequent inquiries showed that the daughter and an Irishwoman of nearly a similar name lay in the hospital next bed to each other Hence the mistake of the father, being misinformed as to the state of the daughter s health, and when the Irishwoman died, her body was given to the supposed father, who is, we learn, a Scotch man, and from the circumstance of the virulence of the disease, interred without identification We have been informed that the father of the recovered daughter is about to institute legal proceedings against the manager of the hospital for the expense incurred by him in the interment of a stranger -Glasgow Examiner
