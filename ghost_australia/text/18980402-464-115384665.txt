NEW CATHOLIC CHURCH AT QUIRTNDI. On Sunday week the foundation-atone of a new Catholic Church was laid at Quirindi, by the Right Rev. Dr. Torreggiani, Bishop of Armidale. At 11 o'clock Mass in the old wooden church there was a crowded congregation, and a splendid dedication sermon was preached by Father Patrick, Superior of the Passionists, Sydney. At the conclusion of Mass a procession of the school-children and Chil dren of Mary took place, and the Bishop read the prayers, assisted Fathers Patrick, Paul, and O'Con nor. The stone was then laid by the Bishop, and after another procession around the foundation, his Lordship addressed the congregation, briefly stating ! that he had no need to doubt their generosity, tor j they had been tried over and over again, He would have liked to build the church out of his own pocket — but his means were limited, and his only resources were the generous feelings of his faithful people. If the people helped in the external work, God Him self would attend to the spiritual work and look after the welfare of the church. He blessed them all in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Mr. William Britton, at the request of Dr. Torreggiani, announced that the sum of about £200 had been placed on the stone, and with the amount collected, the half of the total building sum was in hand. At evening Vespers the church was again crowded, and Father Patrick preached a grand sermon, taking his text from the Gospel John viii. 1, 15. A great many people of different denominations attended.
