VICTORIA. [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] MiibHOURNU, January 22. For the time being in imitation upon the New (defence question is suspended, in fact', it has reached a st ago it which Uni o is nothing for us to do but he on our oars and bide the course of negotiation From Mel boin no to the Murray, from Gippsland to the South Australian border, the public voice of Victoria has been hired during the last four night, expressing an vat j ing tones indigo ition at the conduct of Loi J Derby and the Home Government, and at the same time approbation of the position taken up by the 'revue Ministry But ill that having been done, 1 outside aHaus me again quietly speeding in very nearly their ordinary course Not could The programme be much altered were Parliament at sitting, because, what at the present strike local Parliament do, even if it had the chance to act' Never before were the Ministry at the head of affairs in Victoria so powerfully supported by the general tom mutiny Hut putting the annexation question in abeyance has in no way diverted the Victorian mind is on the federation business In fact, the attention of our body politic is just now turned towards our neighbours more than over, and we are for the nonce almost up to our eyes in intercolonial affairs Between Victoria and each of the four other Australian colonies New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasniuua-at least one great quest sun is gradually more and more thrusting itself namely, their respective commer of relations, 01 lather, not what those relations are so much us what they ought to b" The topic is no new one with us Ever since the Australian colonies were severally empowered by the Impel ml Legislature to come to separate commercial arrangements with each other, the matter has been pushing its way to the front, and it seems just now as though it could be let alone no longer Possibly it will not be seriously taken in hand next session, but there are ever so many signs abroad fast, that there will soon be hot do bites on the subject, and secondly, that when next year our Lower House expires by dHuxion of time, the Assam- will be made a main one with the country Not the least among the forecasting of the times is the circumstance that our two principal commercial representative bodies-the Chamber of Commerce, which means free trade, and the Chamber of Manufactures which means protection-have joined hands so far as to mutually agree, in solemn conclave, to the following momentous result tion -" That, as a prelude to federation, the Government be urged to try and arrange for Intercolonial free trade in colonial goods th it is, that all the natural products and manuring factories of Victoria be allowed free admission into the other colonies, and that all their natural productions and manufactures come to us free, each colony being allowed to impose whatever duty it may deem necessary upon goods from any other part of the world ' All this has been brought into special prominence by the events of the past week or two which go to show, particularly with respect to the commercial relations of Queensland and "Tas mania, that if the campaign has not yet been fair 19 entered upon, at all events skirmishing has begun, and, as sure is fate, the more the question is handled the more will it expand With your colony we have before us at present only Mr Andrew Kowan'ssugai proposal which will probably be advanced a stage when Mr Griffith returns to Melbourne, but it is scarcely likely to stand long alone For one thing, it has yet to be regarded from the give and lake aspect As the Argus says, it will possibly be soon almost lost sight of in the multi to be of larger issues to which its consideration is bound to give use In connection with las making such issues have already given, for negotiations with that colony with a view to a commercial treaty between it and Viet us have reached quite an advanced stage Dui length, past fortnight our Chief Secretary and UniiMCr of Customs have been in Hobart sitting in conference with the leading numbers of the local Government, and striving to stab ha-ha 1 a>is of recipients in trade between the two communities It is, indeed, high time some effort was made in that direction for although Victoria and the island' seemed fair and for commercial intercommunication, they have for years been drifting further and final of apart In 1873 Tasmania sent us £2 worth of goods for every £1 worth she sent to New South Wales, whereas in 1882 the tables were so far turned that she was then sending to New South Wales 10 per- cent more goods than -she did to Victoria On the other hand, what wonder is it that such is the case seeing that the Tasmanian import duties range from 3 to 10 per cent while Victorian Customs charges run from 10 to 20 percent. What has passed at the conference is not yet known in fact, it is not certain whether any agreement at all has been or will be come to Kinnoul states that the plan most favoured is that the two colonies should interchange articles of local produce and local manufacture, but what does that mean ' As the newspaper critics say, ' What is an article of lee of manufacture'" Is sugar grown in Mauritius or Queensland and refined on the banks of the Yuin an article of local manufacture ' And what about slops' flannel comes from England and is made into shirts here Is another colony foreseeing the article as free' Nevertheless, the fact that such negotiations are being entered into at all is agreeably significant One comfort is that all through them the greatest politeness and cor finality has prevailed From the Governor of Tasmania downwards everyone those who could do so has made the occasion a pretext for splendid intercolonial junketings His term ' intercolonial is e-qieciiilly appropriate, because the list of guests includes not only on Mr Berry and air Langridge, but also the Premiers of Queensland and New South Wales lions interior of a fire tin to the only topic between us and our neighbours With respect to South Australia, we have a revival of the old disputed boundary question.

The Presbyterians and next after them the AnghutH, are all behindhand The arrival upon Victorian abodes of Mr James Anthony 11 once, the history 1 m, and undoubtedly the most illustrious man of letters who has yet visited Australia, has been made quite an event Happily such a reception could hardly take him by surprise, for the Press of the colony united to assure him before c hand that he was most heartily welcome to this part of the world He 13 accompanied by his son, Mr. Ashley li oude, who has just to pleted his university career and then avowed object is to "look round' Victoria, Tasmania New Zealand, and New South Wales, and to return to England met San Francisco So you will not have the honour of a visit the tour is to be one purely of pleasure for Mr Froude declares that the question of his will Ring a book about his t au is is an open one, a 11, which is not nearly so pleasant to hear, that he has determined not to deliver any lectures At nugent both gentlemen are guests of Sir H B Loch, bit we may suppose that something will be seen and heard of them outside Government House One effect of the visit has been the adoption of the leading Victorian newspapers of the price the of ' into 1 sewing, and certainly the plan has been so far benefits for before Mr 1 He had been twenty four hours in the co on his views on the present position of the at 11 A vi in question, and a war city of other topics 11 1 laid before the public in a very aged calle fashion It cannot be without interest thing that he believes that a feet tion of the L pire will render it irresistible, that it is permit me for the colonies to federate, that Australia should be better represented 1 in a pond Councils and, lastly, that the to ones should "give up defining themselves, and simply pay the Home Government for doing the work Another ray of light albeit a little broken has been thrown upon the actual and comparative condition of our colony by the publication by the Customs Department of what it calls an advance statement of our imports and exports during the past year It is admitted that a portion of the rectum as are approximate ; but, on the other hand it is asset ted that if he in the figures are complete the total cannot be attend one way or the other by more than £1000 Upon the whole the result sh J IS that the com- mineral progress we are making is although far from unsatisfactory by no means very shilling The grand totals are -Imports, £19,171011 exports, £lb,0ü0,7G2, but these amounts have to be taken a little to pieces for exams k we should subtract from each sum the amount of gold and specie imported and exported, as the case may be It must be understood that owing" partly to reasons connected with the Mint, the exports of gold and specie during a given year by no means represent the yield of our fjOldhtlds during the same period With this deduction made our imports stand at £17,iiO«jGlL 01 £9 he 223 more than we imported in 1854, while our exports stand at iliOiOOOO at £1 old 190 more than we exported in 1885 But even this statement does not afford a complete view of the facts of the cac, because the figures are greatly swollen by the value of the wool sent down from Riverina Without an allowance in that regard we would have to swallow whole such an anomaly as Geelong importing Í.21",0Í>4 worth of "goods "and export 11g £l,lol,110 worth, and Echuca importing £1 811,209 worth and exporting only £200 964 worth Indeed the in crease in the value of the goods sent across the Murray from New South Wales during 1887 is almost equal to the total increase of £909,201 previously mentioned The overland" (which might be more properly called over liver ) imports for the year were ii 200,2 showing an increase of £911,2)b over 1851 and the corresponding exports were £1,121571 or an increase of £220 911 over 1884 The latter figures also present peculiar fe still es For instance, at the two great Riverina ports the imports were at Echuca, £.l,bll,209 antagonist exports £200 901, and at Wahgunyah ' 1 tUO, fcS, as against exports to 1915 but when we come to Wodonga, the Victorian port of exchange as between Melbourne and Sydney, the returns tell a very different tale, for the imports are put down at £725 986 and the exports at no less than £125 732 In 1882 the corresponding figures were imports, £ IJJ 901, exports, £2.17 771 At last we have some definite information respecting the peculiar and far of cattle disease that made its appeal mee in the You Yangs district towards the end of last year Mr A J Kendall, a member of the Royal Hotel near by College was deputed to inquire into the subject, and his open it is not at all comfortable in the high price he tells us that the disease has been in the colony some time, and that about 300 deaths have resulted from it.
