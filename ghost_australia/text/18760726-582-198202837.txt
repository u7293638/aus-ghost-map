' . ..i! -k (Solentitio Amerienn.);' During the early stages of diraeniia in duced by mental anxiety, Dr Richardson' tells us in his "Diseases of Modern:!Lifr," there .is nothing more than an increased; teqj, sioa of the minute vessels which supply the braiu. In luter stages, the substances of the nervous tissue itself undergoes b mouino-ition by which ite activity is permanently-- Iobi. These are the physiological consequences, most briefly summed up. The first Bympiooi is a want of full bodily vigour ; then follows craving for more woik, disturbed sleep, qciile sensitiveness to external impressions, and, finally, strange figures and souuds tno seen and beard. This condition iuay coiitiiiue' for years,. and the sufferer in tiu.e may ..begin . to accept abnormal oreations as natural. . Dr JSionacdson cites a case of a ..meteban(f,;stwbo. for weeks retained in his vision the speotia of three lights, oval in shape, of, the size of an egg, and so clearly defiued to ihe pbserver that.he would watch them half coiiaciously its they floated before him ou the wall/the ceil ing, or in apaoe. In this stagAot- the disease lies the foundation of all hypotheses of ghost- seeing, of ebstaiio viuiins, and'everi of 'poetic frenzy.
