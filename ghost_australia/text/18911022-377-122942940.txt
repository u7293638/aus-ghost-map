WAS IT A MIRAGE. To fte Editor of tlhe Queensland Timrs. Sir,-I have witneseed, in the North, at oer tein timeCs of the year, a whole island (a great distance from the mainland), with fishbing boats anchored close by, transferred to the sky; but, last Sunday evening, in tile Queen's Park with a beautiful moon overhpad-I be held one of the strangest sights it has been my lot to look upon, and I was not alone. My coonpauion lirst drew attention to what he timidly termed "ea ghost." On looking around, we noticed that there were numbers of others watching this wonderful tran?eforma tione, which occurred in close proximity to a group of bamboos, in full view of any passers by. Briefly, it appeared like a beautiful white swan, the attitude being quite posey, then, suddenly (octopus-like), something of a sleck nature would entwi e the whole fors and, again, the white vision would asuone like a weeping position. No one could appar ently, state the cause of such a curious trans formation affair, and now I would like to know was it a mirage? Anyway, whatever it was, I hope to notice less of such scenes, so close to a public roadway. Yours, &e;, LOVE ME NOT.
