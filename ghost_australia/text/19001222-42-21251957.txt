CHITCHAT. Mr. Joel Chandler Harris, who has de-<*> lighted so many thousands with his quaint tales of Brer Fox, Brer Rabbit, and the rest, has resigned his place as editorial ..Writer on,!' The Constitution,1 1: Atlanta, GW, .and iwiill devote his entire time to literary work. His new ■work; "On the Wing of Occasions," will shortly 'be 'published. • Tfto stories in this, volume all deal with Civil War times. ..Mr..Harris has created a* now character, "Mr. Billy Saunders," who, it is said, wHI toe a serious rival to "/Uncle Remus." . '"" ' - - , ■ Henry. Lawson's, first ibool< of verse, "In the ?ays When-the World .was Wide," has been repufolished In England, and has, on the whole found praise lor ifcts matter, and a .trifle of blame for its manner among Eng lish literary journals. The "Academy" characterises it as full of "(bone, sinow, and go; 1' tout takes exception to the roughness of his language and his inaiblWty to deal with i description" and sentiment. He is vivid, iploturesque, and breezy in his treats inent, ibut in the higher flights he is want ing. The "Athenaeum" finds it genuine, but thinks that Law«on lacks'" the rieces- sary 'training that the production of great ;work demands." The " Literary World. ;says that "an hour with his volume enables any imaginative, reader to get a gdod".ldea 1 61 .what rough life mean3.•■in1 Australia."- Hi? .is " a man writing ifbr nieri." Altogether • Henry iLawson T bns reason -to be very well satisfied-with his English reception. He is the pioneer of the. new Australian school, and■ he has .been, welcomed—an earnest of (appreciation to ib'.e ex-tended to those tfolr •low. 'America has lost one of her most famous literary men in the person of Charlea Oud-. ■ ley Warner, novelist and essayist, iwlip'died at the" end of October last in his ,72nd year. "Mr. Warner's death was very sudden, and ,'was due .primarily to hear.t disease. At the ■beginning of his career he "studied for the law, and for some 'Dime' practised iir Chi cago.

Ido not say that he invariably adopts the method which I have described when he is writing a story for a child such as "The Pled Piper of Hamlin" he does not.
