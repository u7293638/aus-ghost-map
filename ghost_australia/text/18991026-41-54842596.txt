MAJUBA AND IMPATI. When the wild Boar faced tbe lion On red Impati's height. Be showed bis tusks to terrorize Th» Lion in the flffht. . His tusks vrrc loots, M* tusks were strong— Tbe Mauser tasks— tnd they Were sent to him to rend and limb The Lion in the fray. Right valiantly the vril'd Boar (ought— Behind his native will— Tbe rocks ind ranges of the land; Bnt when our bugle call Sent the Fusilien and LeceUtenhircs With teeth tnit nerer f»u— Tbe tay'nets keen— tbe Boar was seen To show not tuaks, but Uil. For when our soldiers donned the ridge That nurks Impati's crown, Tbe Boar in traitor terror turned Tbe btil hillside down. Bat bis hont had sped from the Taller1! Dm, And be turned him once again; In his headlong flight be taroM to fight, Like a wild beaat in Us pain. Then echoed from the nunding* hill The battle- bugle's blast Charge! Cavalry ot England, charge! And forioni and fatt, v Like a flash of flame to tbe nller came The British mounted men, And tb-y painted red their nrordt,, tnd fed Mijutu'i mem'rjr then. The Boar who'd used a bully's boact— ' - He'd make tbe Lion flee Like an eland frighted in bis night. And drive him to tbe sea— Formed a rabble host, despite the boast Ot the wiih that tuned tbe will; He was driven then by tbe breed of men TftDDed on Haiuba hilL The swords flashed in, and the swords flashed out, Nor guard nor parry rang; It was cut-and-thrust till they bit the dust, . While tbe hot blood teethed and sang. Our men were glad with a joy made mad By a long-remembered vow; Tbey could sec tbe bone* wbow grer tombstones Jut from Ibjuba's brow. Tbe call of kindred filled their ears. And red ghosts lined the height. While fancy beard the dead men's cheers Xerring then) on to Cght. And no living men— so they tell our pen— ' Could call up such lust to kill At Majuba's dead dad in bloodstained red On dread Inipati Hill. , CEORGE MATSOX. Port Adelaide, October H.
