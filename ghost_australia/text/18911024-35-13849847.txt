\A VISIT TO "LES CHARMITTBS." (From the Speaker.) It was tho season of the y ear most loved by Boas Beau himself, when snow Bhll lingers on the hills though flowers aro blooming in tho hedoo, that Î Btorted from Chumben for " Les Charmettee" Half an hour s clamber up a fairly good mouitain path brought me to tho orchard, with the htlo house standing above it, and behand tho house the vineyard -all precisely as Jean Jacques pained it so many years ago Those who know when to look for it may find on one of the trees of tho orchard a board bearing the inscription, "Ici fut l'habitation de Jean Jacques Rousseau "-but this infrrmotiou is neither necessary nor correct Readers of tho " Con- fessions" will recognise Les Charmettei at once and it was Madame de Warens who rented the littla farmhouse for some 11 years, whilst Jean Jacques passed with her hero, at most, three happy summers. But this house amongst the hills was not tho "habitation " of either of these two troubled lives it was tho home of tho love story that gave to one of them, at least, on interval o' perfect joy and tho inspiration of romantic love he was to com municate to a world that had forgotten love's extst ence These memories came crowding upon mo as I entered the simple, and almost »or, abodo and thoy helped mo to think moro kudl} than I had dono before of the heroine of Jcnn .ñeques' romance " All her favours were lavished on Uio unfortunate fine and brilbont personages har their pains for notlung if Uio> courted her.

Tho old spinot has fallon dumb long ago- not the ghost of a sound como from tho yielding keys as I «in my finger« over thom In at the curtainlosa wincowa streamed tho Bunshino and outside towered tho snow. crowned mountains , bounding the hutcscape beyond the terraco garden, where the trees vero putting out now leaves as green and yomg a» those when it wa« spring ono hundred and fiftr-thrco yean ago Horo, in the scono I looked out linon, I had, then, the Nature that once spoke to Kouiseau ' For ovon at Los Chnrmeltcs, ma happiest hours were no1 epont within walls, and during these jetas when hu thought« took form and colour the influence of Madamo do Warens waa ontnvollod by the influences of the mountains Something of these influences I could feel and understand now that I myself stood amongst his hills, and saw o new earth, is it were bathed in tho magical atmosphere that at these heights bftB the heart and lenda brilliancy te all around How magnificent a spectado spreul out for eyes hidden from the world ana contented to hvo with Nature m these solitudes ' Behind Cltanbcn the mountains wera veiled m a purplo haze now and ogain torn by Uio sun , ond thon showing dirk pine forests, fields of snow, ond tho deep furrows of old water- courBos Tho near lulls woro a shining green, with patches of snow where tito hedges or trees cast shadows, the elms and beeches were leafless still, but red with swollen buds, the poplars vero hie thin yellow plumes and the willows fcatbe-y with yonng greou, whilst amongst thom stood soao tufts of small fruit trees, powdered over with white blossoms, as though tho mountains had tossoJ down on thom somo snow Tho au- was lull of the long of buds and tho murna of waters-and such waters' From the window I could coo tho cascado described by Rousseau-a stream of sapphires ona omeralds ruBhing down a rock of pearl It was amidst such BceneB as these that Jean Jacqc.es' genius was nourished It is not enough to say that he had grown up wnth Nature-ho had grown up with Nature amongst the mountains. " Never,' ho says, "could a flat country satisfy him with its beauty. Ho needed mountains und torrents and black pino forests, and steep, crooked paths that climb and descend, and precipices tint inspire terror." He needed theso things aud when thor foiled him, no luxury or easy living could console him for the spoctaclo of natural beauty loft behind him with his mountains And, smco it is the pro- perty of the human spirit to transform outward im- pressions into spiritual foots, tho effort towards moro dignity, simplicity, and freedom of hfo became the result of Jean Jacques' unqiicnchstlo longings for his lost mountains One hundred and fifty-three years ago ' How short a time it seemed as 1 tamed my back on Uio mountains and lookoc mund the empty talon that had once beon made bright hy the presence of tho fascinating, still beautiful woman, with her "caressing au* and angehe snub"-the amiable hostess of Les Channettes whc*c only fault ivns her too close imitation of tho conduct of the householder in the parable who called in his guests from tiio highways ond hedges Sudi behaviour on tho part of a daughter of "fou noble Jean Bnptisto do Ia Tour" and tho wife of tho Chevalier do Loys, Baronda Warons, was of course unbecoming and indiscreet. Yet wo oro bound to recognise that amongst tho vaga- bond guests was a certain runawn} apprentice from Geneva who might have beon left to die under the hodge if Madame do Warens hod been less kind, er hove been, at most, fed wtUi chantablo scraps in the kitchoti had sho been more nice-and then the whole course of Rousseau's hfo, and of the age whoso history is bound up with his, would havo been different As I sat before tho old spinet, passing my fingers over tho silent koys, it scorned to mo that Madame de Warons was pleading hor own cause, and protesting against the short-sighted method of measuring tho ovonts of a century and a half ago hy the standard good only for the guidance of the personal life " Why " she seomed to ask, " regret te day that I was not loss compassionate or moro constant and discreet » It would, no doubt, havo been better for me in my generation bad I possessed less sen sibiht}, and it might havo been better for Joan Jacques, in his generation, if I had shown more con- stancy in lov a but what then ' If I hud boen wiso, and Jean-Jacques happy, would the eighteenth century havo had its social prophet and roionncr? You reproach me, because with mv mischievous phUoBophy and my misused talents I helped to form his belief that women cultivate Uicir brutus at tho expense of their hearts, and thut, therefore, an ignorant, unintelligent woman is moro trustworthy than an intellectual ono Again, what then ' Jean Jacques' unsonndness upon the question of tho higher education of women is now really not of the slightest consequence, although it offonds }ou so mortnhV What was really of importance, and what helped him to render to the highly cnlbvated and intellectual women of his day precisely the ser- vice thoy nocded, was his strong faith that no social graces con compensate for tho neglect of natural duties-no gifts of the spirit count against poverty of heart no patronage of art, no encourage- ments of intellectual pursuits, consolo human society for the loss of wifely constancy and maternal love. But it was I who, b} my betrayal of him, threw Joan-Jacques into the power of Thirêso Levasseur ? If you had made this complaint against me 149 }cors ago, you wonld have boen in tiio right But now-of what consequence is it f The woman Lovassour is Heaven bo praised ' safely dead so am I, with mymfidehties, BO is Jean-Jacques, with his woes. When you, li» living, croas the borders of our world, and como amongst us who havo hved, common sonso, as well os good manners, should teach you that}ou must take us as wo aro without fault-finding, becausowe cannot chango ourselv es to please you And there oro othor reasons besides tiio changolessness of our state that demand silonco before our errors, and compassions for tito sufferings those errors brought us, from yon who inhabit an age that destiny com polled us to build for you You may Bayficrhaps that whilBt doatui} may have utilised Jean-Jacques, it found no help in mo to servo m budding the new ago P But aro you sure of this ?
