WHERE ARE WE ? ECHO answers, where ? The government has beer) very badly beaten and that upon a side issue. There are many persons w!io believe the party just defeated has unrighteously held the reins of power for the whole time its members have been in office. There are not a few \vho will de clare they have misused their position all along and ought to have been out long ago. Probably many will rejoice that an ignoble elevation to povver has been folkwad by an ignominious end. Whea all these parties have had their say we are still confronted with the question with which we started. Who is Lee ? It is the courtesy of past usage for the Governor to send for the man who has been instrumental in throwing a govern ment out and ask him- to form a new one. Is there the ghost of a chance that Lee will be able to command a party though, he has created a panic ? The defeat is worthless to the country as far as its policy is concerned; indeed' there was no question of policy involved, A certain offence had been given by what looks like a money grabbing- propensity on. the part of certain high officials. They promptly gave up the game as soon as brought to book. They are not mono polists.in the propensity to get money., by any means perhaps Lee himself would not object to.turn in a penny by means which to the conscience of his neighbour would not be- admissable. What will be the next step,? It has. been, known for several weeks that the premature repeal of the old electoral act has put thg coun try into a peculiar and unprecedented position. Probably Mr. McMillan's sug gestion will be acted upon, and supply provided to carry on, till a. general election can- take place.
