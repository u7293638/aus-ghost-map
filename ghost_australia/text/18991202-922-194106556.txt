POETRY. THE NEW Js.P. The Government has added 600 (six hundred!!!) names to the Com- mission of the Peace:— To Fitz and Festive's swell hotel, In Nineteen-Naughty-Naught, The gentleman from Inverell By Cabman Smith was brought. He gave his name in gentle tones, Enquired the time for tea. The clerk repeated "Silas Jones, Of Inverell, J, P." "No, not J.P.!" the stranger said; The clerk he stood aghast, And scratched his curly auburn head, But found his wits at last. "You're not a Justice of the Peace! What yarn is this you tell? Good Lord! Will wonders never cease? And you from Inverell!" "I am no Justice," said the man, "I sit not on the bench!" Then said the clerk "Great Cæsar! can The name of Jones be French? Are you a Russian or a Swede, A Spaniard or a Boer, That Lyne and Party have agreed To thusly pass you o'er?" "I am no foreigner," he said, "But British to the core! Please tell me where I'll find my bed, And let me know the score!" And here the waiting maids came round, All anxious for to see, For they had heard a man was found Who wasn't a J.P. And Fitz and Festive came along. Said he: "Great Cæsar's ghost! Don't charge this man; it would be wrong And sinful!" said mine host. "He is the only country swell That ever I did see From Booligal or Inverell Who wasn't a J.P.!'' They gave him board for fourteen weeks; His drinks were always free, And hundreds of suburban beaks They called around to see! And thousands crowded that hotel From curiositee To see the swell from Inverell Who wasn't a J.P.! —"Orange Leader." Last Saturday's "S.M. Herald "con tained nn Australian's description of one. of the battles near Lndysmith. The men who left Dnndee for Ladysinith were three days marching 50 miles. One night they were tramping with a tiopical rain falling. The wearied infantry hung on to the stirrups of the cavalry.
