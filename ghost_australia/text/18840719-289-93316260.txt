[?] THK WAY OF TFTHj WORLD. There sate a crow on aloity tree. Watching the world go byi Be saw a throng that swept along With laughter loud and bigh. f In and out throngs the motley »nt ' CUe ghosts stole on unseen ; Ihelr hearts were longing for one sweet word Of the lore that once bad baen, But never a lip theieapoke their names, Never a tear was abed: Xhe crow looked down from his lofty tree, «f rDs the way of the world,' be slid. A singer stood in the market-place, Singing a tender lay, But no one needed biB sorrowful face, T&o; one bad time to stay. He turned away ; be sang no more ; How could he sing in vain? And then the world came to fata door, Bidding him sing again. But be recked not whether they came or went, He in his garret dead. Ihe crow looked down from bis lofty tree, ' 11a the way ot the world,' be said. There sate a Queen by a cottage bed, Spoke to the widow there ; Did she not know the same bard blow Ihe peasant bad to bear? And she kissed that humble peasant's brow. And then she bent her knee: ' God of the widow, help her now, As thou hast helped me.'1 'NowGodbethanBed,'saIdtheoldioldcro'ff As he sped from bis lofty bough ; ' The times are HI, but there's much goo 3 still In the way of the world, I trow.'
