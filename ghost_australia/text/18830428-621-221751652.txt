Victoria Amateur Turf Club. The weather on Saturday morning was disagreeably wet, and fears were entertained that the V.A.T.C. meeting would have to be postponed. Fortunately, however, about noon the dark clouds moved away, tne sxy cleared, and the afternoon gave promise of being a fine one. The .usual facilities were afforded to visitors to reach the course, and special trains left Prince's-bridge station for Ganlfield until a late hoar in the afternoon. Owing,' doubtless, to the uncertain state of the weather, and the fact of the Eight-hours Association holding a counter demonstration, the attendance on the course was only moderate. The racing commenced with the Selling Race, which fell to Anagram, who defeated the favourite, Kit Nubbles, by half a length, Nymph being third. Buzza scored a very easy win in the Hurdle Race, and Wizard had no diffi culty in' appropriating the Glen Huntly Handicap, Contessina beating Kathleen Ma vourneen for second place. The Interest in this event was to some extent marred through L'Africaine falling at the turn when holding a very prominent position. Vaulter was mdeh fancied for the Steeplechase, and was well «i»mnrtari rinwn to 6 to 4. Governor made the running to the tarn, where he retired in favour of the Ballarat horse, who won easily. Forlorn was served up very warm for the Armadale Handicap, but he was never dangerous at any parfc ot the race, victory frllinpr to Contessina, with Castaway second, and Idddington third.
