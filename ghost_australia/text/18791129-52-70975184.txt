THE MYSTERY OF BERKELEY SQUARE. Tho following is a cutting from MAYFAIR of May 10,1879. What is the mystery oonnocted with tho house in Borkeloy Square ? "The mystery of Berkeley Square still romains a mystery. We wero in hopos that during tho last fortnight a full, final, and satisfactory answer would have been given to our question ; but we havo boon disappointed. Tho story of tho haunted house in tho heart of Mayfair is so far acquiesced in by tho silence of those who alone know tho wholo truth, and whoso interest it is that the wholo truth should be known. That story can be recapitulated in a few words. Tho house in Borkolcy Square contains at least ono roor of which tho atmosphere is supernaturally fatal t body and mind. A girl saw, heard, or felt sud horror in it that sho went mad, and never recovere< sanity enough to toll how or why. A gentleman, ยก disbeliever in ghosts, dared to sleep in it, and wai found a corpse in the middle of the floor, niter franti cally ringing for help in vain. Rumour suggeste other cases of tho same kind, all ending in death, madness, or both, as tho result of sleeping, or trying to sleep in that room. The vory party walls of the house, whon touched, aro found saturated with electric horror. It is uninhabited save by an elderly man and woman, who act as caretakers ; but even these have no access to the room. That is kept looked, tho key being iu the hands of a mysterious and seemingly nameless person, who comes to tho houso onco ovory six months, locks up thc elderly couple in the basement, and then unlocks Ilia room, and occupies himself in it for hours. Finally, and most wonderful of all, the house, though iu Berkeley Square, is neither to be let nor to be sold, Its mere outside shows it to ho given up to ghosts and decay. Beadors who foel eurious about tho matter are referred to our issuo of a fortnight ago for tho details, of which tho above aooount is a resume." W. E. HOWLETT.
