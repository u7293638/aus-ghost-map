SPORTING. Now that the May meeting of the Queensland Turf Club is ranked among the events of the past, perhaps a few words, briefly reviewing the racing, may not be inappropriate. While the meeting could not be considered a great success, it was not by any means a decided failure. Indeed, under the circumstances, and considering the disadvantages under which it was got up, it was, on the whole, better than could have been expected. From pecuniary reasons, the club had to curtail its usual liberality in the matter of prizes, and this, of course, to some extent, militated against the number of entrances, which, however, were pretty numerous, and the quality of some of the horses was rather above than below the average of those usually attending the meet. The racing itself was throughout very uninteresting, there being no close finishes or exciting contests ; but, never the loss, those who went to the races appeared to spend a pleasant time, and were not particular to a length as to the distance the second horse was behind the first when passing the post The absence of a professional bookmaker was not a matter of general regret, and did not prevent a considerable amount of speculation on the different events. The losers had no reason to complain of being done by the artifices of those with whom they made their wagers, as every horse which started ran to win, and there was no pulling or low tricking exhibited. It is to be hoped that the funds at the command of the club will, before the next meeting, be sufficient to enable the committee to make the arrangements about the stand a little more complete than they are at present. The sooner a proper paling fence surrounds the saddling paddock the better, for something is necessary to keep the roughs outside. The want of a saddling shed is much felt. Although I am an advocate for strict economy, and consider that the club are acting wisely in refraining from all unnecessary expenditure, yet it might be a question for them to consider whether it would not be advisable to raise funds by issuing debentures, and so got the course fenced in, like it is at Randwick and elsewhere. At present, the lessee of the gate cannot collect the fees for admission to the ground, and in consequence of the club lose considerably every year, as, of course, they cannot expect to dispose of the gate to advantage, if they do not take proper precautions to enable the lessee to obtain the fees he is authorised to levy. A few words with reference to the race itself and I shall then have disposed of the metropolitan annual for the present at least. The Maiden Plate was looked upon by the exceedingly clever touts as a certainty for Norman, but, as your readers have been already informed, the race resulted in an easy victory for Pandora, who won it with at least 7lbs- in hand. The favorite came in second, being severely punished when he had not the least ghost of a chance. Some jockeys, who could be named, from the persistency with which they continue to flog their horses after they have lost all chance of winning, appear to admire this mode of procedure, but lookers-on can generally see when the race is won, and the losing jockeys do not rise in the estimation of the public by punish- ing their horses needlessly, either from ignorance or temper. The two cocktails engaged in this race did not distinguish themselves, and the time in which the mile and at all was done was not just by any means. The Corinthian Cup brought by very good horses and riders to the post, and resulted, as I predicted in my last communication. Hermit coming in first, with Killarney, who was well steered, second. The Prince of Wales Stakes was a mere canter, for Canute, a horse not mentioned in the betting, with Boonoke, a mere pony, second. The Hack Race was well filled, and the winner was found in a bay horse named Barney, 4 years old, by Battler, the sire of Hermit, the winner of the Corinthian. The second day's sport commenced with the Hurdle Race, of which he much has been written. Killarney was made a warm favorite for this race, but his backers were to a man disgusted at the way he was ridden, or rather attempted to be ridden His rider fell at the first hurdle, and through a similar accident happening to the rider of many of the third leap the race was a more canter for Nun lad, who was beautifully ridden by an amateur The Ladies'' Purse is easily described Why Not, a grey horse, bred by Mr I one of Bathurst, the breeder of more good horses than any other three men in Australia, faced the starter in company with Chancellor, who was bred by the same gentleman, and lot of moderates The Bathurst bred pair had it all to themselves, and Why Not proved too good for the other and won with any amount in hand. The Brisbane Cup Race was ducted of much of its interest through the scratching of Pandora, who over reached herself in the Maiden Plate, and was too lame to run Pronnei was backed against the field at odds, and the winner was scarcely mentioned Though the start Sydney and Forrester went away with the lead, while the favorite and Centipede kept a long way in the road After the first mile and a quarter old forester cried ago ' 'the black horse was too far behind to take her place, and when Pro miner tried to go up he found the weight began img to tell on him. During the last quarter of a mile he made another attempt, and considerably improved his position, but not sufficiently to win the 130 BOioroigns The fact of Sydney winning this race must be put down to the rider of Premier having committed an on or of judgment in allowing him to steal a match at the commencement of the race Some two thousand pounds in bets must have changed hands on the result of this race However, betting was not confined to a few and no plunging took place. For the Optional Handicap there were five entries, and the weighting of the horses engaged gave great dissatisfaction Canute, aged, 9st clubs , Eoauoko, 9st 2lbs , Centipede aged, Sat lOlbs , COtherstone, years, 8st 12lbs and Slyboots, aged, 8st 7lbs The publication of the weights is sufficient to show any persons who are at all acquainted with the running of the horses, that three of them were handicapped clear out of the race, and unfortunately all of them were strangers This is not the way to encourage country people to bring their horses to the metropolitan meetings Of course, Centipede won Several prix ate matches came off a day or so after the races Why Not, the w inner of the Ladies Purse, defeated old Torestor easily enough in a two mile race for £20 aside, and two days afterwards he scored another easy victory by beating Sydney into fits in a three miles race for £100 aside Before the horses started Why Not was backed to him, as his superior quality was very perceptible to good judges The result of the race showed that breeding will always toll The northern men were very confident about Sydney, and the result of the match was a great blow for them, for some appeared to think the Peak Downs pot reducible Most of the houses are now located at Ipswich I was glad to see that the settling was generally satisfactory, and I hope that gentlemen who had little books on the meeting, and who have not yet squared up, will soon get them properly balanced There should be no crying out about being hit hard as an excuse for time to pay off any little hilling amounts which may be due I hear that both the Tattersalls Clubs are prospering Both have noted liberally towards the QIC, one having thrown in a fiver and the other a tenner in aid of the funds of the club If such prosperity continues, a New Year's Meet is inevitable The South Australian Race Meeting, which will commence on Wednesday next at Ipswich, is attracting considerable attention For the first race the Ladies' Purse Six very good horses are cntorcd-Piomioi, Tifllor, Jack, Why Not, Proserpine, and Centipede The distance suits the lot, and the weight for age Pioneer and Why Not to a nicety The others, with the exception of Centipede, are out of place when weight for age in the order of the day I hear Why Not is drawn but I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the rumor It is at any into a fact that he was backed very recently, and I trust there has been no ' milking" going on For thowinnerlBhould eolectPromior, and lfWhyNot is out of it, Centipede second The North Australian Grand Handicap of 100 sovereigns will be computed for by four very moderate horses-Forester, Sydney, Chancellor, and Czar Of the latter I know very little, but if he has got any pretention to be a lace boree, he ought to win, with Chancellor second for the Maldon Plate only two are likely to come to the post Norman and Lady Bird Pandora, the other entry is, I hear, not sufficiently recovered to warrant the owner in sending her for any thing before the Gayndah meeting If Lady Bird is what she is said to be this ought to be an easy opportunity for her to lose her maiden honors For the Queensland Welter, five are onteiod-Tamoilano, Killarney, Barobonos, Volunteer, and Why Not The latter is not likely to go, and even if he does Barebones, can beat him I shall look to the 'Boers to win The second day's racing is to be limited to two hurdle races, and any private matches which can be got up This arrangement will have a prejudicial effect upon the whole meeting Many persons will leave town after the first day and will not return, when, if the second day's sport had been made more attractive, they would, no doubt, have remained during the meet I fancy Nimrod will win the Hurdle Race, bar accidents The third day's racing begins with the Corinthian Stakes, for which the very poor entry of three is made Tamerlane, Killarney, and Centipede The latter is my pick with Killarney in front of Lady Bird a sire The Flying Handicap should be a grand race, and, out of the seven horses entered, I fancy the Chancellor is the safest to back The great event of the meeting is the Queensland Handicap Sweepstakes of 100 sovereigns, for which Premier, Nonsuch, Sydney, Barebones, Czar, Tamerlane, Norman, and Pandora, are entered Notwithstanding the victory of the northern borne last week, I have come to the conclusion that Premier will come in first and Barebones second in this race
