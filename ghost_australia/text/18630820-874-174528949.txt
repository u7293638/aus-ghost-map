THE ROYAL GHOST. BY A DEVOTED ADMIRER OF THE SUPERNATURAL. I'VE seen the famous talking fish, I've Been thick snow in June, I've seen a modest actor, and A mouse that sang a tune. I've seen the big Niagara, And dabbled in its fall, I've gone down Etna's crater, And I've climbed the China wall. I've met with most things marvellous Of which the world can boast, I've seen a great sea-serpent, But—I never saw a ghost. So, on Satiirday I went, As it was a leisure night, To the house of entertainment Which belongs to Mr. KYTK. I entered soon, and sat In trembling happy fear, Delightfully expectant That a ghost would soon appear. I saw a lot of fellows Attired in sock and buskin, And landscapes that would gratify The taste of Mr. RUSICIN. I heard a deal of cliaff, That sickened me almost, And saw a lot of mummers, But I didn't see a ghost. I cared no single button For any thing that's real, But I yearned to see the people Of the world that's called ideal. And there I sat impatient, But valiant as a HECTOR, Expecting the appearance Of the new imported spectre. But not a ghost appeared, Or ghostly voice was heard, Or spectral act sensational In any way occurred. And so I left, in high disgust, The house of Mr. KYTE— Compelled to think that Mr. K. Had not quite used me right. I'd paid my cash to see No thing of flesh and bone, A gliost was all my longing, A ghost, and ghost alone. Homeward I went at ten o'clock, From such depressing sight, And never have I seen a ghost Before or since that night. I felt just like that wretched dog, In history well known, Who grasping an attractive shade Just Bimply lost Ms bone.
