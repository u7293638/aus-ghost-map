Our Contemporary at the Theatre. The theatrical reports and critiques of our ancient contemporary are refreshing at times from their sim plicity, and are equally- remarkable for their incor rectness. On Friday night our venerable friend was represented at tho Victoria when '- Hamlet' was played. Tho performance was only briefly noticed in HAtnrdav's issnd. i-nt wa obflfirvA therein tfiin 'at. traordinary criticism: — 'Mr. Harwpod niade a tolerably good ghost, thongh he did not perhaps throw, so much fire info the character as hemighthavo done.' Did any one ever hear of 'fire' in a ghost? *Ihe very essence of a perfect representation of the Ghost in ''Hamlet' is that the aotor should assume a spectre-like and almost motionless demeanour ; that he should glide almost imperceptibly en and off tho stage, and should preserve an air of statuesque so lemnity. This idea was ably carried ont by Mr. Har wood, than whom a better Ghost (with the single cx oeption, perhaps, of Mr. Henry M&rston;, whose GBoBt has always been looked on as tho best in the modern style) could not well have been found. The Hekald's report is as palpably absurd as it is unfair to. the actor. But this is not all. In to-day's issue tho Heeald has a report of tho performance of this burlesque of ' Fra Diavolo,' on Saturday night, at Mr. Bennett's benefit. Will it be believed that the burlesque, thonprh on the bills, was never played, at all on Satur day night P What becomes of. tho Herald's report P Our venerable contemporary is really eclipsing all previous blunders and absurdities.— Communicated.
