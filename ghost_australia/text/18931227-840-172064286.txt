Emmofc The Boarding-Mouse Joint. Eaoh weary guest is worn to a ghost. ; Ob, list to our tale of woe I How we long or a root Irom our landlady's roast, But how she makes it go. Oh, eing me a hymn of tbo luooious ham That never our table eeoa 1 But only tbo limb of tho anoiant lamb ' Whoso eequouoos aro thoso : Ono day hot, and tho noxt day cold,- And tha third day " otow" is its nsm'l J ' And the fourth day hash, bat the simn old ioint It gets thero, just the same. The markets groan with the fatted gronsa Tho stalls o'erflow with fowl; . I somotimes mosn for a Chinese mouse Or a alias of toasted awl. Bnt evor the ehapo of tho aged sheep On the table lies alone, And like funeral crape despair doth creep ' '. . Aa tho same old rulo goes on ; One day hot, and the next day cold, .

If tho tariff tax would aomplote its triplet, And tbe priae to heaven should soar, Suoh a otsto of foots would our landlady fix-' And wo never would grumble more ; ' Ono day hot, and the noxt day oold. And tbe third day greasily stewM And tha fourth day hashâ€” Will it ivdl- ' roach Innocaoue desuetude?
