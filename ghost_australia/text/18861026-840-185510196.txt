Freethought Association The usual weekly meeting of the lyceum in connection with the above took place on Sunday morning in the Eagle street hall. Several visitors were present, and about 40 children. The usual programme was gone through, and Mr. Wishart addressed the children at consider- able length. He advised them to train them- selves in good habits now while they were young, so that when they were men and had to take their share in the responsibilities of life, their lives should be a pattern to those around them. He urged them to do good for good- ness's sake, and not in fear of any punishment or in the hope of any reward. Mr. O. Leslie also addressed the children. The thanks and well wishes of the class were tendered to Mrs. J. L. York, who was present, for the valuable assistance she had rendered the class by her voice and presence. Mrs. York responded in a few well-chosen remarks. The usual Sun- day evening lecture was delivered in the Gaiety Theatre. The building was well filled in every part. This last lecture of Dr. York's course wos entitled "What I know about ghosts," and was principally the ex- plaining and expounding of his ideas upon spiritualism. He did not ask them to to believe it or accept it as truth, but to think over it and to be respectful to those who said and felt that they could accepte it.
