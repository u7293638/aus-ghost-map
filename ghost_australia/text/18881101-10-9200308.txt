SPORTING HOBART TROTTING AND RACING CLUB. The inaugural meeting of the newly formed Trotting and Racing Club took place at the Victoria Sports Ground, New Town, yesterday. The club only came into being about three Weeks ago, but no time was lost in bringing out a programme, and the result of the first meeting has been so successful that it may fairly be expected that many a good afternoon's sport will be provided by the committee. Yesterday the racing was enjoyable, and a deal of interest appeared to be centred in the various events, all of which were got off in fairly good time and with little trouble, although the facilities for conducting a race meeting were very primitive If the racing continues to receive public patronage, no doubt the committee will deal! liberally with its supporters,' and take care to have every thing as were not as port ble, but until they see how the ghost walks it cannot be expected that any large expenditure will be incurred to secure the necessary appointments Se/eralapcrtÂ« were heard to remark yesterday that what Mr. Cox had! done at Kensington Park in Victoria might be done at New Town, and there it really no reason why something of a similar nature cannot be done, even though the different i circumstances may render the scale of opera ' tions much smaller. It had been anticipated that the sharp corners of the course would prove very awkward for horses going at full speed, but the committee very wisely improved them, and thus removed the liability to accident. The racing, although interesting, was not exciting, as the whole of the raoealwereWon easily The back and hack hurdle races were both carried off by a neat little horse named Beach, a hope that has figured at minor country meetings on previous occasions Beach was bred by Mr. R S. Steele, of Studley Park, Forcett, and it by Wild Dayrell from a half bred mare named Beauty The starting was in the hands of Mr W Webster , Mr. A N. Lord and Dr. Weaver divided the duties of judging, and the secretary (Mr. T. Arnott), with hit committee, attended to everything else.
