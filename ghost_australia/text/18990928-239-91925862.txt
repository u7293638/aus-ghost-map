The Flight of the Years. When one by one the silent stately years Glide like pale ghosts beyond our yearn. ing sight, Vainly we stretch our arms to stay their flight, So soon, so ewift, they pass to endlessC night I We hardly learn to name them, To praise them or to blame them, To know their shadowy faces, Ere we see their empty Iplaces i Only once the glad sprin, greets them, Only once fair summer meets them, Only once the autumn glory Tels for themn its mystic story. Only :onc the winter hoary \Wers for them its robes of light! Years leave their work half done; like lmen, alas ! With sheaves unrgathered to their graves they pzass, AiMd are forgotten. \VWhat they strive te do Lirves for a while is meumory of a few, Then over all Oblivion's waters flow The years are buried In the long ago,
