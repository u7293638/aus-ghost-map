Tbe Loan Estimates ware considered fareoae mittes,and* large number ot Btaaa wanpaaesA Tbe committee obtained leave to- ait again on Tuesday nest The Estimates were carried through com mittee mtd finally passed. The SappLemvntory Estimates were con \- sid«rad to committee. Tfae House adjoaraed at 1085 p_m. tfil Toes day next. Tab annual report of the South Australian Institute, submitted to the meeting of members held last evemng, is on the wbole very satisfactory. Then is apparently ao | diminution of the interest taken in what should be regarded aa ate of the most valuable of onr city institutions. Within the limited space to which it ia atill con- < fined quite as much as can be reasonably expected is done in die way of promoting J popular instruction' and affording facilities i for self-improvement and intelligent recrea tion to dl classes of the community. Where, indeed, ao many counter attrao ions enter into competitiauras they gone rally do in metropolitan- centres, the uses and advantages of aa institute HEeTthe one on North-terrace are perhaps not so fully recognised as they would be in less populous places. In comparison, for instance, with the country institutes it cannot be said that the Adelaide establish ment draws to itself a proportioaate num ber of members j nevertheless it would be somewhat invidious to insist on> such a relative measurement of their eaecess. In the esse of the Adebide fintifeite the reading-room is free to all comer-) aad thoee who frequent it are precisely &a; .sort t of people who swell out the mftrqfwrffip_,' in country districts. This eectionpfjhe: community has little leisure or inclination ; for the study of ponderous tomes and dusty folios, or in fact for anything- beyond ephemeral and current publications. News papers are inordinary literary food, variety -n-hen sought being found injw?ekty periodi cals and'monfhly~'m__ga_nneg_ In {he report before us no attempt is made to offer an approximate estimate of tfae numbers who use the reading- room, but it may be as sumed that these are very largely in excess of those who avail themselves either of the free reference Bhra^y or of the escalating libnuy. For them,., consequently it *■ decidedly needful that ample accommoda tion ahould be provided whether the reading-room and reference librtryare made one, or are kept apart. ' At all events, tiie prominence hitherto accorded to the circu lating department must begot rid of should appear that this branch of the national Institute seriously interferes with the reedom and usefulness <rf the rooms as ttmctive resorts to those for whom they were primarily intended. In short, it is. > beurd to apeak of a public library wherein are not to be found the books catalogued . because they are dispersed throughout the country in tiie hands of subscribers to the circulating branch. It is high tine that he system underwent a change that would not leave the requirements of the com munity at large subservient to the Claims of those whose wants might as a rule bens amply satisfied by private Utnrifcns. - It is gratifying to learn .that country institutes continue to increase, and to justify by their position the aid extended to them b£Government. tfbtabb), too, is the experiment ventured on at Wallaroo of opening a needing and recreation room for youths, whoeeem to cooperate for the praise worthy attainment of the object eo?teoa plated. | This novelty is reoommended to other localities as being worthy of imita tion, and where nothing akin to our Young Hen's Christian Association exists the Wallaroo initiative might prudently be fol lowed. Few wiU gmdge the Royal Society of South Austalia a portion of tbe funds liberally diatritaced by ma State in the form of grants in aid to institutes, yet the expediency of mixing it up with tiie country societies affiliated ' to the lastitnte is open to question. | The Boyal Society, as well as tiie South Australian Society of Arts, is certainly allied to tha Institute, still it is none the leas independent of it as regards its formation, scope, and mode ot working. There is aesurediy greater affinity between the School of. Arts and the Institute, and it would be a source of regret did the School of Design not receive every pjssiMe e/acour&gement.; From Mr. Hill's report it appears that the classes in that school are flourishing, while the awards gained by hi? pupil? at tbe recent exhibition furnish gfround for congratulation. Herr Noot cagel's German and French classes are like wise reported to be prosperous. Diet gen tleman again feels called upon to urge tbe necessity of German especially being Uueht In this colony, where that language is largely spokes, and he .appeals to the success of his plan in en counting conversation with hia pupils, wbo are for t^6 most put young men who find the class home at the Institute highly convenient. The Curator of the Museum has also a flattering tale to tell. His col lection of specimens is constantly growing! and he is thankfpl to the many generous donors named for their contributions illus trative of natural history, geology, and mineralogy. Mr. Waterhouee refers to "some Very valuable exchanges obtained from tha Maasnmat Paris, comprising an extensive {collection of reptilia, besides many nwijsls, and a great variety of ethnological specimens.'' After these have been exhibited in Melbourne they will be returned here and placed ia- conceal ment, we enppoee, until the Curator's ati-Oety as to apace for ths display of the i interesting objects in Mb btuuege is relieved. We aro glad to see from the report that the new building is ao for advanced that a portion at least of it will in all likelihood be j available for use within the next twelve | months. TUe?oardofGovernorsrecordtheir thanks to His Excellency Sir William : Jervois for laying the foundation-stone in | November last, as also for his address on tbat occasion. They likewise express their I obligations to the Hon. Thomas King, who as Minister of Education took a prominent part in that proceeding, not merely for his assistance on that day, but whenever the board have required to consult him ou In stitute business. Wuatkvbb may lie in the womb of the future with regard to the oeming year, and whether or no it is to be as prophetesses and sibyls have foretold—one which will stand out from among others jn coming ages as a cataelasmic period replete with dire events, there can be no doubt Ate year of grace 1880 baa been in many respects an annus mbraWiM. It has sees the overthrow after a long tenure of office of tiie Conservative ; Government ia England, a change which ! seems not unE&eiy; to leai to important '. results to Europe generally; it haa seen the ; celebration of the tercentenary of Gamoens, one ot the world's greatest poete; st has seen the inauguration of another grand antipodes! world's show; and last but not least it has witnessed the completion of the great Cathedral at Cologne, perhaps- the most magnificent Gothic ecclesiastical edifice in the world; one which bas had a moet ex traordinary history, and around which haa gathered quite a halo of legendary romance: Many of the groat cathedrals of Europe have been centuries in building, and' scarcely a city of any renown, can ; boast of suali a monument of tbe^rietyrlhe wealth, and-the pride of long ■deceased in habitants. Glorious, however, aa these fanes are in the richness of their earring and the beauties of groinedtoof and storied window which-have been added during the lapse of generations, that of Cologne ex ceeds them all. Few of them can at most boast of a growth of more than two cen turies, bnt that of Cologne has had 'an adolescence of mm hundred years. It has loag been accounted one of the wonders of tiie world of Europe; battles have been fought within aonadpf its bells; treaties have cop?erved ita existence; and slowly as the years sped on has the great structure approache<rcon_pletion, jantil on August 14 of tide year the top atones %ero pieced npon its towaor,. aad die vast church,' which perhaps mere" than any othpr is tjjricaf of the ilehes aad the, po*?£ • Konyn Gatbolicasm,.-waa completed. Murii-intemt in itself attaches to the ancient city of Ootogne, now facetiously, if somewbat irreverently, spoken of as that of thousands of martyrs and innumerable stinks, which latter even Jhe perfume long associated with the city is unable to render bearable to unaccustomed nostrils. So far back as' the' twelfth century, when . the mighty cathedral was begun, Cologne was a city poss?Gshg a free constitution of very ancient date, of which its inhabitants'wer c -mightily -tenacious. Important even in the days' when Boaian governors lield. court and revel on the banks of the Rhine in the middle ages, Cologne had become a great centre of German commerce, and flourished like tbe famous Hanse free towns with which it was-solemnly recognised to rank in enjoyment at iwimnmties by successive Ger man Emperors. Without its walls King or Emperor might bold sway, but within the burgbera owed allegiance ~to none but their own Prince Archbishop, of whose grandeur and power tbe groat cathedral was designed to be emblematical. Before be twelfth oeMtaiy there was of course an episcopal cfanmh, bat the then Prince Arch bishop, Conrad of Hbefastedien, and his faithful burghers, deemed it all too mean for his dignity and their wealth. There fore a new building was projected, and a design of wondrous beauty prepared by an architect whose name is now unknown, but wheat legend saith wrested the pjans-f torn no lebs a personage than His Satanic Majesty by means of pious fraud, .thereby ineaniag the hellish curse that the-strucr taw, torn design of which had been con ceived by no mortal brains and drawn by no aaertal hands, would never be aomploted. Tbe first stone of the church was laid in 124Q, and according to tiie original plan it was to be 600 feet in length* 300 feet in breadth, aad having two towers each 500 feet in height. For tm handled and fifty years the erection of the hniMtng went on steadily, and then came- the days of Dr. Martin] Lather, and tie fall of medira ▼alism. For a time the burghers of the old vitj wavered between the ancient opinions and the new, finally clinging to the former. Years passed on, and the building atill grew on the old fines and in the old style. The Prince Archbishops of Cologne ceased to be political entities, and the once free city became an appanage of the Prussian Crown; but greatly be it to their credit the successive rulers of Pro testant Prussia subscribed largely to the funds of the gnat scheme which all Ger many had by that time come to regard as a national undertaking. They looked upon its completion, not as a glory to Oolognei but as a glory to the Fatherland. At length in 1848 the body of the magnificent cathedral was opened in the presence of the Archduke John of Austria and the King of Prussia on the 600 th fanmvereary of its foundation. It has re mained, however, for an Emperor of I Germany to see the completion of the ! trtructurs, F?r thirty-two years the towers [ dowly rose from the height of" 250 feet, to which in 1848 they had been completed Y?t .although s4 many centuries hare | elapsed since its foundation-atone irw laid 1 titers has not been a single variation from the original plan, and Cologne Cathedral stands to-day a unique gem of Gothic art, in the completion of which all Europe cannot but join in rejoicing with Germany. The great church has, however, a unique ness apart from its architectural beauty. While no doubt it is a marvel that to-day the cathedral stands completed as the hand that six centuries ago mouldered into dust designed it, it is atill more wonderful that it has been throughout a link as it were in history.- Begun in the days of feudalism it is completed in those of socialism, and yet there seems no incongruity that it should be so. It is a unique case of the past and the present being joined together by the carrying out of an idea, a wonderful example of the persistency in the national life of a people, of the adtus of an object of national pride. The returns of the Registrar-General of the births and deaths in the province during the quarter ended September 30 are published in the Government Gazette. A total of 2,821 births and 951 deaths was recorded. Of the whole number of births, 1,468 were those of males and 1,3-36 of females; and of the 951 deaths, 536 were of males and 415 of females. The excess of births over deaths was 1,873. The birth-rate per 1,000 of the population was 42-60, and the births exceeded the quin quennial average by 409. Although less in number than, during the second quarter of the year, an event which has only hap pened twice in the preceding ten years, they notwithstanding exceeded in number those registered in the September quarter o" any year since 1875. The number o deaths, however, was unwontedly high. It exceeded the quinquennial average by 177, hut it was less by 146 than ! that registered m the first quarter-mf [ the year, and 64 under that registered in the second quarter. The death-rate par , 1,000 of the population for tbe quarter waa : 1432, which is tiie highest for the cony j sponding quarter ef any. yew stbcb 1876. [ The principal increase in tbe number of births was in the district of Actehmfe, in which 890 occurred during the quarter. This is the highest number yet registered in tfae district during any previous three months. IJindmareb shows an increase of S6 r Glare, 22; and Frame of 38. _En some districts, especially Pert Adelaide, DUy, and 6ray there was ? decrease. Ot the whole number of deaths about 50> per cent, were due to local diseases: tiie principal cause of the high rate In this class being bronchitis, tne deaths from which readied 16& Of these 115 were of children under one year <f age. Mr. Cleland points out tbat the moftilitT from this dieease Bas been very- remarkable, and it exceeds- that of the corresponding quarter of last year by 125. Ibe £xet marked fatality from bronchitis began, Mr. Cleland states, ia June, during which 79 deaths were due to this cause. 'In July the recorded deaths were 70; in Aagust, C 4; in September, 34; thro making a total for those four months .-of £47. This mortality and that._ fnm phtiiisis—to which cause no less than 81 deaths were nttritratetl-^-ifl'-ttnddubtedly to be accounted for by the unusual incle mency of the weather. In* zymotic deeases the deaths from scarlatina were 31, being 21 higher m number than in tfae corresponding quarter of last.year;,but no increase is shown under the headings of diphtheria, dysenteiy/or diarrhoea. Pneu monia, among diseases of the .respiratory organs, was very .fatal, no less-than 46 deaths having resulted from tbat disease. Then was a" decrease in the number.of fatal cases of constitutional diseases,- dae4p the less frequency of atrophy jjuid debility.

In the Assembly on Thursday Mr. Bray asked if Que Treasurer was aware that a report of the Boothby enquiry iiad appeared is one of the morning papers, and what explanation tits Government had to offer respecting the paper being handed to the press before it was laid oa the table of the House. It seemed to him that such a document should be laid before the Hoose before it was published fa the way it had tttD. It ought to be a well understood rule that while Parliament was sitting reports should be laid on the table of the House before they were published in the papers. The Hon. J. Golton also said it was only fair to the House and the country that the report should be laid on the table. The Treasurer said no one was more utterly surprised than be was when he raw the report in thelteputer that morning. It was the first time he had seen it, as witu the exception of the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-General none of his colleagues had seen the document. The publieatiab. of the report was utterly wrong, and the Government was in no way responsible far its appearance, ncr were any of its officers impli cated The affair bad oesurred la thfr «_ One of the board, Mr. Goode, showed the report. as he considered in confidence, to aaasmherof the Register staff..
