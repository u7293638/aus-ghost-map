Gbon joekeyship and good training are coming more and more to the front every year in Aus tralian racing matters. The abundant supply of good colts weU-bred and weU-perf ormed, as weU as of four and five-year-old horses, makes every event to be keenly contested, and many a good animal never gets a prise at aIL Joekeyship (aa that of Teomans on Mountaineer at Albury) carries the day now in conjunction with perfect oondition, and the question now before a big race is not, Whom is the candidate bred from T or, What has he done 1 but, It he or the the best conditioned horse in the race t The publio go piling their money on "so and bo," either because he is by Maribyrnong or Yattendon, or because he won suoh and suoh a handicap or produce stakes, ignorant of the fact that he was then in tip-top fettle, and is possibly 60 per oent below concert pitch now. The knowing ones who get the correct tip about a horse's condition, or who are judges enough to see it with their eyes when it stands before them, are the men to puU off good things in future in the Une of bets, for it must be seen by anyone of common sense that breeding is now carried to such a pitch of perfection, and the merits of tbe horses (apart from training and aUotment of weights) are so evenly balanced, that nothing but condition on the day and artistic joekeyship of the rider can turn the scale in favor of one 01 the other. This is found to be the case in Eng land, where nearly aU owners train their horses well, where all the horses are pretty equaUy wett bred, and stand much alike in their untrained merits, snd so people at home now back the jockeys rather than the horses. And until people get to be judges of condition the bookmakers wiU " have " tbem. How many people, I wonder, took the double of Thyra and Melbourne at Glen Innes ? It must have been a clean " skinner " for the Ring. At latest advices from home the racing season was fully over, frost hod set in, and the usual annual "BpeU" was being enjoyed by book makers, horse-owners, and the rest of the oi pollox that go to make up the turf oirole. They all need a rest badly, for the season in England is one continual rush per rail from place to place, in order to put in an appearance at aU the numerous and endless meetings that have to be gone through by those who want to turn an honest or dishonest penny by the deeds of horse flesh. To parody Tupper's " Proverbial Philosophy"— Dodgy and various in kind are the methods of working tne oracle, ..*. j. And the cove who is not up to snuff in llfes handicap race will bo distanced : •Tis worse than unlimited 100 for to seek the small pea 'neath the thimble, And early nmat he quit his oouoh who would capture the weasel that sleepeth. And it iB a moot point with myself whether the English or Australian bookmaker leads the harder life of it "Kb true there are not bo many meetings crushing on one onother out here as at home; but then, on the other hand, there is really no recess in the Australian turf season, as there is in the old country ill winter. The climate is more fervid here, and the travelling rougher; and if there be not more of night royatering to go through in Australia than there is in England in the season, I fancy that the pace is faster out here, and the "Uquoring up" heavier, and tbe poor Australian bookmaker seldom gets a spelL His blue Uns often teU a tale of heart disease that the sturdy limbs avail not to oontradict in the eye of a physiologist Yet, for sll that, the constant healthful change of air and scene, and the excitement of travel, must tend to counteract much of the evil effects of late hours, for when one reads of the death of any prominent turfite, either in Australia or at home, be he trainer, horse-owner, bookmaker, or what not, he has geperaUy attained a good round age, and in some cases extreme longevity, before he makes up his mnid to turn up his toes tb the daisies. Horsey men, jockeyß excepted, seem to have far better and longer Uvea than professional cricketers, who, perhaps from want of early rising, are old men at forty. And apropos of jockeyß* healths and the way they suffer from over-wasting, I may mention that Colonel Forrester, at home, went so far as to propose, at a recent meeting of the Jockey Club at Newmarket, that 4 st fibs, should be carried in some races, an idea that was at onoe and very properly " sat upon," aa scarce any boy could reduce, even at the loss of health, to this standard, and would be perfectly useless to ride a winning race at suoh a weight. Great efforts have been made by Buch bigwigs as Admiral Rous and Lord Falmouth to persuade the French to reciprocate and allow Engliah horses to run for prizes all over France, the same as French horses are allowed to do all over Eng land, but" mounseer " don't seem to Bee it. He says that horse racing and rearing is but a " baby" art aa yet in France, and that its country patrons would withdraw their money support v* foreign English horses were allowed to compete. This is "very rich," when one remembers Gladiateur, Fille de Lair, Flageolet, Boiard, Chamant, Verneuil, and others, nice sort of " babies I " And yet they have been allowed without grudging to carry off the plums of the English pudding. But Jean Crupaud won't reciprocate, and so John Bull must grumble, grin, and bear it aU as best be may. The races at Warwick, the midland county of England, were favored by soft ground at the start, and by frost on the last day of the three. Ten events per day were hard work to get through when dayUght is only eight hours er so ont of the twenty-four; and the Union Hunt Cup waa won by Sans Peur, who oost his owner 880 guineas to buy him in, and was sold'to Captain MacheU for 700. The close of the season haa brought on a perfect plethora of horse sales, comprising Arab hunters and others; and at TatteraaU's, Lowlander was started at 2000 guineas, and bought in at 2900. The Ghost was bought in at 1100 guineas. Talisman, a French bred horse, by Le Sarancin, from La Fortune, fetched 900 guineas, as did also Concha, a brown colt, by Asteroid from ArapeUe, sister to Per© Gomez, by Beadsman. There was great sensation at Liverpool when Congress, with the unmistakable welter impost of 12 Bt 7 lbs., won the Grand Sefton Steeple chase, and the Grand National Handicap Hurdle Race at Croydon was a most exciting event, comprising Whitebait, Regal, Foudre de Guerre, Woodoock, WM Duck, Jupiter, Melrose, Ac. Woodcock, a son of Marsyas and Typhoon, a horse with a game leg, but magnificently bred, who can do anything on soft ground, proved the winner. The great MetropoUtan Steeplechase was a granddish, whole bags of backing sovereigns being behind many a horse in it, pressing him on to the front of the betting; it was won by an Irish mare called Pride of Kildare, who started at 10 to 1, the shortest priced favorites being Zero and Congress. The wind-up after a splendid race, with varying fortunes over hurdles and water jump, saw two Irish horses and one Frenoh one fiUing the first three places, to the discomfiture of the Saxon oppressor, or Perfidious Albion, whichever you may please to caU him. I have frequently quoted in my notes the high prioes realised by first-class stock at sales. Let me now, by way of contrast, mention some oheap lots. What does the reader say to Flying Dutch* man, by Voltigeur, from BoreaUs by Newminster, for fifty guineas, or Carolua, by Melbourne from Carine, by StockweU, for fifty-one guineas. Why don't they send them to Australia in place of Belling them at Tattersall's on November 27! Nearly as great a job lot was Alexandra, a three* year.old, by Macaroni out of Juanita, by St Albans, for ninety-five guineas. The weights for the St. George Handicap com mence pretty high. The speedy Garryowen heads them with 9 st 7 lbs., and the pony Dirk wul groan under 9 at 5 lbs.; the strong, if not swift^ galloper, Blaxeaway, must hump 9 st 2 lbs., but without going through the Ust, which appears elsewhere at fuU length, I cannot help thinking that Joshua, with 7 st 10 lbs., and Gaylad, at 9 at 2 lbs., don't look to be the worst in it Some gentleman, under the signature of " Rough," in The Courier ot February 5, wonders why I did not before this take stock of the liberal Warwick programme. When a man is not asked to an evening party he sometimes says that he has been " invited to Btop away " from it. There are townships in Queensland which ignore themetropoUtanPreßßonraoingandother matters. The Turf Clubß at these placeß never send me (aB others do) a programme of their races, and when I do not get a programme per post I usually take it as an invitation not toanalysethe merits and demerits of their bill of fare. This ia why I, not having—at least that I con remem ber—received such a document from their secre tary, have not bo far gone extensively into the description of Warwick races. If it be that I Itave received suoh a one and forgotten it, I can only apologise, and hope tbat their handi caps, as they fully deaerve to, wiU fiU weU, and be deftly handled by the weight-odjuster, so aa to secure the maximum percentage of accept ances, fixed, I beUeve, by Admiral Rous at obout 60 per cent as the very lowest minimum in a weU-made handicap. But nou* verrons very shortly, so I will say no more now on this head. The Warrego Racing Club has again issued a neat little annual programme, with £360 of added money, at CharleviUe, full particulars of which wiU be found in the advertising VENISON. columns and calendar. My friend "Rough,", before mentioned, says that I forgot—in wishing the Brisbane Cup course to be 1} mile only— how nearly level the course is. Not a bit of it, and I think the Ipswich two-mile race might just as weU be made If mile as well, hiUornohilL Every quarter of a mile taken off the distance wfll increase the number of horses likely to enter in any ordinary handicap in Queensland, or the colonies in general, and it is muoh better to see a dozen or fifteen weU handi capped horses struggle over a mile and a-half than three or four only of them over two miles, as is often the case. Of course such great events and heavy prizes as the Melbourne Cup are ex ceptional, and form no rule for minor handicap races ; but even in the Melbourne Cup I should Uke to know how many there are, out of the aver*. age ninety entries, that could race out to the end of two miles in anything under three minutes and fifty seconds, even with a feather on tiieir backß ? Two mile handicaps are grand events, and the last quarter of a mile is generally a sight to see and a real pulse maddener; but you must, as a rule, go south and get the teeming southern stables to iurnish a full field, and southern handicappen to put them together, if you want plenty of starters and plenty of competition. We in Queensland had better try shorter dis tances for hardioaps meantime, and reserve the two miles for Weight-for-age. I must admit that Quack, 1.L., and Zanoo made a fine finish of it over two nulet in 1872, but not one bit less exciting were fenco, Erin, and Vioeroy over a mUe and a-half b 1874. I have received a programme of the Roma races, to be held under the auspices of the Western Queensland Racing Club on 9th and 10th May next, Vir. M'llwraith, M.P., being the President, and Mr. Jonathan M'Lean a "Vice" thereof. £530 are distributed over a dozen events, the biggest cake in the lottery being the W. Q. Racing Club Handicap of 200 sovereigns, with a sweep of five, half forfeit - sweep to go to the second horse, and third horse to save his stake; the course being two miles and a dis tance ; nominations for handicaps must be mode by the 15th March, and weights wiU be deolared at Roma on the 20th April. The nominations fee is only a guinea, there it no qualification fee required, and altogether the programme, which appears in the advertising columns of this paper, and which I cannot here, for want of space, more fully go into the merits of, is a great credit to Roma and the denizens of the Bur rounding district, and it puts to shame, as re gards sound ÜberaUty, the style of business which obtains in some more pretentious locali ties. Acceptances and 'sweeps mnst "tumble in" on the Brd of May, and the general entry wiU take place on the Bth of the same month, dosing at eight p.m.
