Although there, were seven girls at the neighbouring school where Twae a day boarder; and although they called me little Esther Summefson, I knew none of them at home.. All of them were older than I, to he sure, -(I was the youngest there by a good deal), but there seemed to be some, other separation between us besides that, and besides their being far more clever than I was, and knowing much more than I did. Onepf them, in the first week of my going to: school (I remember it very well), invited me home to a little party, to my great joy; But my godmother wrote u stiff letter declining for me, and I never went.

This opening passage puts a reader of ordinary perceptions and with average imaginative power, in thorough rapport with the heroine. He loses the actual author in the. assumed authoress. The traits of development which succeed in this early portion I of the story expand the first idea of Esther Sum- ; merson; hut neither add to nor alter it. All. (and there is an unusually-great progress of story in this first jnumber) she says andidoes, and everything that happens to her you expect from her, and of her, just as Partridge expected Hamlet to be frightened wheh he saw the Ghost. The circumstances, for in stance, attending her leave taking at school are so natural, that no others than those; actually narrated codli, apparently, have taken1 place. • : Of course, in a novel in , which a strong interest is necessary, scenes must be pourtrayed which a woman couljl neither witness nor . describe; consequently, although the story will, we infer, be strung upon the delicate thread of a woman's autobiography, the author occasionally steps in and asserts himself in the third person.. The book opens with a description eertainlv not elsewhere equalled inward-painting. It is that of:— j A BOG—IS CHANCERY.
