Bubbles. Another men is now going to try his hand and month at blowing a centennial bubble. The fact is everybody wants the honour of blowing it. Even Sir H. Paries may yet take a turn at the soap and pipe. He is an expert in the bnbble business, and the ghohl business too. It is some years since he raised theKiama ghost, and to this day that restless ghost has never been laid. If Henry were in power—h • is not, may heaven forefend—it would be tw to one if he did not get H.B.H. to come to see his crony Oairington. Bnt Sir Patrick, great aa he is at Exhibitions, is going to wash his hands after blowing the babble now burst. Maybe they need it. Well, Mr. Harold Stephen is going to try. The 8tephens can do many things. Was it not Harold's father who usod to cure by miracle ? Any way they are related, since there was only one Stephen at the first. He strikes for an International Exhibition. No doubt that would have been a good thing if the business were not already over done. That great white elephant which half filled the inner domain, was an exhibition pilt which Hew South Wales will never forget. In short, it was a draught, and a black one too. But now, would it not bo a good thing to fetch over Taylor Barnum to run it for them '■ Barnum is a host in himself, and hundreds of folk would pay simply to see him. He has, too, a good knowledge of the sort of thing to show. He would put up a complete scries of colonists from the oldest inhabitant to the youngest, capable of being put on view. Barnum would show not fat cattle, but fat squatters, and not fat sheep, bnt the monetary institutions which have fieeced them in these jjard times. Yes, by all means have a show; all one's neighbours oonld join and let Barnum to run it at a percentage on the takings.
