LEPROSY IN THE NORTHFRN TERRITORY. Thc opin√Æou which wc have BO frequently expressed as to thc existence of leprosy among the blacks of thc Alligator River district (says the yorf/imi Territory Timen of tho 31st December), has al last beeu verified beyond the ghost of a doubt. An aboriginal native of that district who came into Palmerston on Saturday last at thc suggestion of Mr. P. Cahill (who was buffalo htmtme for a couple of years ut the Alligator) has been examined by Dr. O'Fluherly und fouud to be suffering from true leprosy. Mr. Cahill had a shrewd suspicion that thc man was u leper, and by a little judicious deceit managed to entice him j to come herc to bc "cured" by thc doctor. After thc medical o nicer had satisfied himself as lo the nature of the diseuse thc native was conveyed across to thc leper camp, to break thc monotony and lonesomeness of thc solitary C hinamun's existence hore. It is now common gossip that when thu Government Resident's ]iarty was at the Alligator River recently, Mr. Cahill pointed out several natives who bore outward und visible signs of leprosy morn or loss advanced in its terrible progress, und it is expected that the Resident's next report will contain references to the matter. It is thu belief of Mr. Cahill and others well acquainted with thc blades of thu Alligator district that a hundred ut leust could be found suffering from leprosy developed to such an extent that there could I ? no mistaking it in some coses more pronouuised than the poor wretch who has just been transported to thu leper camp.
