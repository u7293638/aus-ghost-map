Black Perry the Pugilist. THE conclusion of an article (the last he wrote) by " Augur " in: the Australasian, gives the following particulars of "Black" Perry, a figure known to most old colonists :- "Another darkey, who would probably have been cham- pion of England had he not committed a serious breach of the law just previous to being matched against the best men in England, was Black Perry. He came to New South Wales, and of course his fame as a bruiser quickly became noticed abroad, with the result that he was not long in being matched against the champion of Australia, a New South Wales ' giant named George Hough, who had been carrying all before him. In those days pugilism was a very popular sport in the sister colony. The "cornstalks" were very confident of their man's ability to win, but he hadn't the ghost of a show with Perry, who won in three rounds. Success settled Perry. He made plenty of money giving sparring exhi- bitions, and used to parade the town got up in a broad-brimmed white beaver hat, immense white muslin cravat with a jewelled pin to cor- respond, green Newmarket-cut coat with large steel buttons, white knee-cords, with top boots surrounded by white satin ribbons ; and as he came down the street with his heavy hunting whip under his arm he certainly looked a mag- nificent specimen of the human animal. He spent his money freely in drink and other pleas- ures and some years afterwards found his way to Victoria, but his constitution had been thor- oughly undermined. Tom Curran took him in hand, bought him new outfits, and tried to patch him up, but it was no use; and, retiring to New South Wales, I think he died there in one of the country asylums."
