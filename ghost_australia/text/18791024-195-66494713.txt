LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. The House went into committee to con sider the Constitution of Council Bill. Mr Sargood said the general wish was that the bill should be proceeded with, and the only question was as to who should take charge of it. Mr Cuthibert said he accepted the posi tion. He thought it a pity that the hill should be lost. Most of the important clauses had been dealt with. He then moved that clause 40, which provided ma chinery for carrying out clause 30, which was repealed last night, might be stuck out. This was agreed to. Clauses 41 and 52 were passed. In clause 43 the word person was struck out, and " candidate or agent of his" was inserted. The remain-. ing claus's were ag:ecd to. The HIon. R. D. Reid said unless sotle provision was made in his bill for a disso lution, it Ihad not a ghost of a show of passing. In the event of these clauses providing for a dissolution of tihe Council being rejected, hie would abandon the other clauses. The Council, after refreshments, pro ceeded with the Reform Bill, makling n number of amendments, and then reported progress. The third reading was tmade an order of the day for Tuesday.
