.Hi§ POET'S PAGE. . THE NEW MESSAGE. BY MAY R. SMITH. If ghosts of women dead a century Steal back to earth, Then verily to-night one talked to me Upon my hearth ; And the pathetic minor of her tones, ~_ Liquid with tears, Wasjlike a plaintive murmur from far zones And distant years. "Think not that I am come to you," she said, "This hallowed night, To gossip of the secrets of the dead, Or tell their plight. "I could not sleep ; for lo ! the Christmas bells A new tune rang : New birth to woman, loud the pasan swells In rythmiç clang. " 'New birth to woman !' Once no right had she To choose her place ; Nor place had she save a man's courtesy Did grant her grace. "Sometimes, by beauty, trick, or accident, Grim fate she crossed ; But when from her obeisance she unbent. Her power was lost. "O woman ! to be robed at last and crowned With dignity, Walking with uplift head your chosen round, Unfettered, free ; "The barbarous traditions of the past Loosed from your feet, Life's richest goblet held to you at last, Brimming and sweet ; "Forget not those for whom too late, alas ! Dawn flashed the sky, And to their spirits drain a silent glass ; Of such am I. "Hark to the Christmas bells ! 'Good will to ward me», Peace on the earth !' 'And unto women !'-chime they forth again 'New birth 1 New birth !' " If ghosts of women dead a century Steal back to earth, Then this same hour one came and talked to me Beside my hearth.
