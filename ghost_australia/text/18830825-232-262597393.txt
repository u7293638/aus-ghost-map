DEATH IN TBE SKY. Who tbit looks upward to tbe'sky In some transparent summer night. When mystic stars are burning bright, When there is nothing wide and high t>nve what enchants the sight— Who that looks upward to the life "We call eternal, and which seems Qaiescecfc as tbe Row of streams; Thinks that, within the caltny vast World-natare rolling overhead, ciicVe which are cold and. dead. And spheres which blazed >n ages past Are lifeless globes, that shed Ko glimmer through the lucent -air. Yet whirl upon their unseen ways lake ghosts of other sines and dayp, like ehadnws lingering d&rkiy; where Tue undent splendor stays 7 As radiant earth is but the tomb Wfiere cteaih awoits behind its bars Hearts tam with many wands and scars, The fcby is as mifathoined'gloom— A sepulchre of stars. — 41 Harper's n f<or June.
