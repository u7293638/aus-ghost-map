WHY WEDDINGS IN MAY ARE UNLUCKY. It has been considered unlucky to be married in May ever since the dayfc -of Ovid. In ancient Rome there was held in May a festival called the Lemuria, or feast of the Lemures, which was a ceremony in honour of th« speeches of departed souls. It became w®0h the Romans what we should call "bad form" to have matrimo nial feasts at the season of a solemn ritual, being, no doubt, thought to be an insult to the dead to marry at such a time. From this a number of stories grew of the re venge made by the outraged ghosts upon those who dared to disregard them, and if anything unfortunate happened to a couple who had been married in May it would, of course, have been put down to retribu tion. So the tradition of ill-luclc arose, and its influence has lasted ever since, even to our time.
