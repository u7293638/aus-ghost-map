Da Horn's green . lacqueys were . conspicuous among tnem ; xneyeamea. wanas in ineir hands, and wore 'huge nosegays. The park was lighted by torches, lamps were hanging along the avenues that led to the housp. A/cTOwd-Btood outside the iron gates^f cheering occasionally as the long names and the splendors and persons be longing to each came driving up. I think people were less blase than they ace now, and thought more seriously upon certain subjects. Dancing, for instance, and powdering, and postures took up a 'great deal of time*; so did conversation and coiresnondence-^-of all of which iexercises our own generation seems somewhat im patient, as it hurries on its way curtailing with smaU, ceremony. \ Miss Angel started in her grand equi page to take her part in all the State cere monies, and rher father put on his old cloak and prepared to follow into the V crowd to. nave the glory of seeing his child pass into the paradise of lords. ' The Princess of Brunswick was to be there and other great personages. Little Rosa begged so hard to be allowed to go too, that as it was a fine November night shining with many stars and crossed by no chill winds, the old man consented to it, and the little girl started clinging to his hand and dancing with delight along the pavement. . I suppose to .one or, two people present, or the crowd.. within or ^ without, every ball is delightful ; certainly 1 little Rosa in her outer darkness was as happy as any of the 3plendid and lighted ?up ladies within — far happier than Angel herself, who had come in a strange and depressed state of mind- ., r By degrees(it often iappens after de pression) her spirits rose wildly. If 'a new gown, plenty1 of music/ smooth polished floors, admiration, and half a dozen .persons at her elbow, could make \- her happy,. these elements were not want ing. Antonio was gone, Mr. Reynolds' \- 'bad left her. but all these vanities re-i maihea. ' Pebpleitalk of fleeting worldli ness ; it seemed to be the one thing that she could count upon. Friendship left her in a fury ; love made a speech and walked out of the room; but here wias faithful frivolity, and vanities unchang ing; here were partners and compli ments, iere was De Horn unremitting in courteous attention. Since other, things w^re not ;for; herj': she would take what, she^could hold. tyWErrvolity a divine, 1 goddess after all?. Was this t^'Vbe the ^ experience of her life, rto find' divinity in one thing -after another.! At- times during - 4,hat- -eventful ^evening Miss . Angei's laughter., and ^.spirits were ^almost wild, but '? *' ?&£ v others she ; ?dcoopedi There was anxiety inihe air ; 'the secret feelings of the last few .months '.seemed mingling with the sdane before iher. Almost the first person she saw as tehe came into the room-was Mr. Reynolds talking to one of the beautiful I-adies Waldegrave.- He came up to her, held -out his hand with a gentle deprecating look. She hardly knew how to respond ; there was a dazzle of lights : before her ?eyes, of music in her ears. She turned :away quickly, and just realised the fact '.:that lady JUiana, who. was in crimson :an'd looking greatly bored, was beckoning ito her. to come and stand by 'her side. : f jKjkkji :tbeir corner the two ladies could \--see into the great dining-room,, which had been decorated and turned into a dancing hall.

There is a picture by btothard of a court -:' ball in those days, delicately and charm ingly indicated.

When dancing, he seemed quite different :' from the somewhat conscious person he 7 appeared under ordinary circumstances. ?. V- i. His ear for music must havo been re markable ; and the whole glittering set of : -'; eountrjr dancers soemed to bo inspirited and kept t*. Jie measure by this one man's '';.'_'' parformsnoe. They swayed and bowed, and stamped their lush heels ; the swords :, j sorting; the gentlemen's gold embroideries, :':J whisk they ahared with their lacqueys, . r, twinkled; the stately lady figures rose ?'??'? and sank, and pointed their satin toes. .Dt Horn, among them all, in his black i sad silver, seemed to beat his own time \\. :': and keep the music itself in measure. Angelica made no secret of her pleasure i ia hit performance. When excellence : ';; mofcas a certain point, even dancing ' 1 k^tftm a fine art, aud ceases to be a par -: '.. sooal display to real artistic natures, i IWiapi this may have been a small fine . ?! ait, but it was all in all for the moment ; .:-: tad when De Horn's glance sought t' angelica's after one of their complicated . evolutions, she gave a bright and un :: qualified look of approval and interest. * '''' Mr. Reynolds was still standing not far ? :?: of, and he saw her glance, and then he ? looked cum at his shoe buckh s, ft-elm;* to if ho bad uu rif^ltt to watch Angelica^ expressions - . .or., . movements any more; - That look seemed lotell him he had been.,right^to_ absolve his con science. She was a ghost to him — that beaxilifai.tivMgJwQmSni =ffith'*hejigh^of youth in her eyes,, of interest and fine in teUigence. Wien the.danGe was over, De Horn conducted her back to her place by Lady Pi. He remained by her side, not talking exactlyiffor he was a -penspn-\ naxje-m.vj(£i and depended more upon iis . legs than his wite for the favor he-received ; from -Qip world. ~ He stopd listening to; Angelica's talk with everybody else* and; putting in a word every now,*nd then; 'more or lesB to the purpose. ; 'What a ; Ahipid man De .Horn is f\ said tiady Di once whent he .SacLjrio.ved' away, called off by some acquaintance. ; ' Do you think so 1' 'said iihe^JCwaff mann u I think the mau is a very good, specimen of a human; being.' She.spqfee, lightly, but she felt anything but gay and unconcerned. ? ? : [ ???-?_ -.-'?'? Was it magnetism and force of wifl ,b'y; which JDe Horn . made his^way?; It .was flome curious i power he had ,af making others half interested, halfaf*aid; An gelica dimly felt that she was in danger. He stUl seemed with her, even when she. was talking to others. -5oethe tells Eckermann about attractive and repul sive powers belonging to human beings as they walk in mysteries. It must have been some magnetic powers in De Horn which imposed upon so many. 'As the handsome couple stood side by side they commanded a view of the 'bril liant company in the blazing hall and on the staircase drawn up io receive the Princess of Brunswick and the Duke of Cumberland, who ^had rarrived in- state. The heads bend in. long line, the cour tesies vie in depth and sweep ; the pro cession sweeps on, the buzz of voices rises afresh. Two people began talking in the crowd of the Daily Courant, a -newspaper which had just come out. ' ?''__: '* Its news is not of the latest/' says one of the speakers, turning to De Horn ; ' it announces Count Da' Horn's expected arrival in London via Paris and Dover. It is three months after date in its intelli-' gence.' .-?...,. \- ' Is he coming V said De Horn, with a start. 'He^who?' said the other, and De Horn seemed suddenly to remember to burst «ut laughing. ' \- Angelica, preoccupied as she was,- could not help wondering at the agitation this little! incident seemed to produce1 in her 'parfcherJl. He, presently asked lier if ''she; did not feel the heat. Would she not: come nearer an open window ? . '. : 'Are you ill f - 'Pray do not think of me,' she said, for she saw that lie .was ,deadly 'pale,, But he would^nofc leave her. .He seemed to detain her, by mere tol?ceof will to keep her apart from the rest of the company; ''?* ' - . \- He be^an talking 'asjfce had never ^do^e before. . , ' Ah^j that yojirWere in iny own rank of life!' he said once j..

Here is Oouut de Horn, who will, I am sure, supply your place.' She was gone, and once more Angelica found her angers in the grasp of the very hand she was trying to avoid. His fingers held hers so strangely, closing with a nrm light pressure, that she seemed unable to resist. ' Here is a seat by the window,' ♦he said, trying to avoid him, and with a sort of smile she withdrew her hand in an unooncerned way, talking of something else all the while ; but agiin she hap pened to meet the look of his strange penetrating eyes as she glanced up ; it seemed to her as if his glance hold her as firmly as his closing lingers. Old John Joseph was in the crowd out side, and had managed to creep with little Rosa through the barriers. As they stood on the terrace of the garden, they saw, to their delight, Angelica go by in her bril liance, escurted hy this magnificent squire. ' How white ehe looks, grandpapa !' said little ltosa ; ' is she frightened all alone if' 'She is not all alone; that great Signor is talking to her,' said John Joseph. ' Praised be heaven that I see my child honored as she deserves; all are acknowledging her rights. See, Rosa, they are looking for her, she receives a message, she is led across. Rosa ! It is one of the Frinceu's pages who has been sent for her,' eriod old John Joseph, ' creeping up closer and closer to the win i dow, aud trampling the flower-bed, to . behold the apotheosis of his Angel as she ' is conducted to the gnat chair where the I Prineess is sitting in State. j ' People are coming this way.

Her dress gleamed' white among the shadows. Some silver cloud. was drifting ^overhead. Some one saw her go from the room, : and came pursuing ;her steps.
