ACADEMY OF MUSIC. The Juvenile Troubadours continue to attract large audiences at the Academy of Music, and on Saturday there was again a crowded house. 'Conrad and Lizette' was repeated aud passed off as successfully as on previous occasions, bui the performance was commenced with an ad dition to the bill in a piece of pleasantry called ' Patchwork, or JELamlet onja String.' This, it will be remembered, was presented at White's Rooms some time ago by the adult troupe of *' Troubadours,' and this fact rather enhances the fun '.of .the sketch, because comparison can be draws between the juveniles and their predeces sors. The plot of ' Patoh work ' is that a wealthy gentleman indulges an eccentricity by giving a ianey drees ball, and while the guests are at supper the servants of the house taking advan tage of the occasion dress themselves according to their several tastes, and indulge in song and dances as their inclinings suggest. Among the principal ircideats may be mentioned: â€” Master Sammy McLean's life-like imitation of Joseph Jefferson as Kip Van Winkle ; Miss Nina Tulloeh in a grand operatic scena, ' II Trova tore ;' Master J. Salvador Parlato's motto song, ' All that glitters is not gold ;' Miss Erne line Fox in ' Pretty as a picture ;' Master Sal vador Parlato as 'Gaily the troubadour;' also tbe TroufcadoHTfe' grand mock tragedy, slightly altered from Shakespeare's 'Hamlet,' intro ducing the melancholy prince, the gravedigger, the queen, the ghost, Polonions, &c;, &c.; ; ' A kiDg of shreds and patches :' 'Put down that light ;' *' Oh ! I've got Hamlet on a string.' As a finale the company sing ' Gaily as a trouba dour.' The piece was very well received, the laughter and applause being most frequent and hearty, and the leading performers were several times encored.
