Why this is called the Chinese town no one knows Possibly for a reason similar to that for which in most Russian provincial towns the chief club where there are no English is, nevertheless called the English Club Outside the pure white walls of the Kital Good you see the newer parts of the city, squares and circles of streets outside each other like the rings of growth of an oak.

'I he comparison may be objected to was too fanciful Fanciful or not, this is about the only illustration which will compel people who have not seen the city to realise the wild wealth of colour it displays, or, perhaps, we should say, Haunts lora circuit of miles and miles around the roofs of the houses, covered thick with woolly looking spotless snow, form an immense uneven white bed Out of this white plot shoot up singly or in clusters, to varying heights, the hundreds of spangled domes 'I They are of all tints blue as cornflowers, red as poppies, green as grass. Then the gold plated domes shine out in all imaginable shades of yellow, according to the degree of light falling on them They vary from a dark copper or ingot like marigolds, or a brilliant buttercup yellow, to a pale primrose hue Here and there, out of this brilliant carpet formed by the (round of while roofs studded over with these blossoming domes, rise up tall stems of minarets, towers, and steeples Many of them have a roof to sleep for the snow to rest on, and their red and silver or green and white tiles glare or shimmer in the air like the petals of a gigantic variegated flower. Every where all round the streets worm their way in winding white lines through the mass of houses, and the immensely broad boulevards clear a greater space for themselves, taking slow, long curves, like the course of a river. It is strange to see trains going on busily all round beneath us without any sound or rattle and rumble of wheels rising up from it. The swift sledges below move about noiselessly , with their long, clumsy, hook shaped Bhaftg, they look like great black beetles with two feelers , they seem to run so easily, and the horse's motion is so free and untrammelled, that you would think the sledge pushed the horse along instead of the horse pulling the sledge The fronts of the houses, where we can see them, are painted very often a rich brownish red, which seems the favourite colour ; some are orange, some even violet The Shutter boards of a chemists shop opposite, which for some reason is dosed this afternoon, urn alternated) green and yellow I should here remark that it is a comforting "sign to see it (heiresses shop shut in Moscow I have liner sun a place with such an enormous number of drug ships the) me more plentiful than barbers of country shops in Paris and, unfortunately, the) are telling witnesses of the great unhealthiness of Alua low This uiiliciiltluncsa is not to be wondered at UiJinuge is utmost unknown here 1 The work of the ss avenger is done for many months of the year by the snow and King I root The nasal organ is not sensitive during Moscow winter it is kind enough work to prevent its being lost altogether b) frostbite But when the time comes for the melting of the snow is ill of the rabl who said garland of Moscow is disclosed in the sheets in an excellent state of preservation All this ill Lil makes up for lost time by doing its work in a vein!) epidemic of diplomat no mind to plead, MURIE now and (then In attire al clio lei i As we look out on the city now it seems am I to conceive that tin starts uni ground are ever mi) lung but white, and that you could ever see Moscow without snow But the hint k white blanket does not five) about April, and that is the time that all Russians advise you to avoid and live away from the country) tHan for about three weeks all Russia i in Europe, Moscow included, is no th me, last a more or less pestiferous swamp or mud) sludge In summer Moa now is It dreadful place to live in, and all the families who am afford it leave it for their country villas in the environs the summer heat is intense, and fierce winds au up along the streets, raising clouds of dust worthy of a Central Asian desert In summer the infant mortality in the city is at its height, this point) arises from the large quantities of fruit and vegetables which are then sold at a really cheap price Looking away to the north we can see the extraordinary Siihareff tower, painted a bluish purple Both in itself and the name it bears this tower is extremely interesting Next to the Kremlin it is the building in the whole of Moscow most loved by the people. The towel was erected by Peter the Great in honour of Colonel SuharelT, who, with his regiment, remained faithful to his sovereign at the time of the Streets. revolt It was Silbaren who gave Peter the escort which enabled him to save his life by taking refuge in the Trott's Monastery), where he remained till the danger was over If it had not been for 'shares s protection, Peter would almost certainly have been put to death by the reckless leaders of the revolt 'The Czar would have perished before he had nellie veil any of the exploits which gave him his title, and which brought his country forward by leaps and bounds in the race for power among other Western nations When we weigh the indifferent abilities of most of the Romanoffs, Peter s successors, it is not too much to say that the man whose name is preserved in this eccentric monument did the greatest service judged by its effects that any Russian ever did for his country If it had not been for him, and his rescue of Peter, it is very likely that to day the rest of the world, instead of having certain) to consider, and perhaps fear, the Emperor of All the Russias, and it may be of Central Asia as well, would merely be conscious that in a semi barbarous country there existed a Prince called the " Czar of Muscovy " Tho^uliarell tower itself is an.oblongtwo stone. structure It has great verandahs running round the second story, and a high octagonal tower rising from the middle of the roof I mention this merely because the tradition is that Peter built the tower, and had it fitted up to resemble a ship us nearly as possible. It must have been before his knowledge of naval architecture was as complete as it afterwards became At one time an unfortunate Scotchman was imported to found a school of artillery in the tower, and to lecture on mathematics and chemistry in one of its rooms For these innocent purposes he naturally had compasses, and phials for his chemicals This was enough, or rather too much, for Moscow intellect at the time Like wildfire the belief spread through the city that if the practical Scot professed anything, it was the black art, and that he was a special emissary from and in unholy alliance with the devil Besides, he dressed in European clothes, even now in Russia they are represented as the garb of the Evil One It must be remembered that to day even ladies of the highest social standing in St Petersburg and officers of the army often consult witches Superstition is dear now, as it always has been, to the untaught Russian mind In Una year of grace 1885, if you were to interrogate a Moscow peasant about the SuharelT 'lower, he would tell you that books which contain the recipe for immortality) are to be found in its recesses. In the some way any old crone in Moscow has stones of the sights seen in the tower in the long winter nights goblins, fiendish creatures with big black wings, flit across the windows in a pole white light, sounds are heard like the distant baying of wolves over the snow, As If this is believed- and it is b) thousands-in a large city, I leave readers to imagine (if they can what superstition can rise to in remote lonely country villages Those in search of the horrible will see they cannot do better than take the hint, and read Russian ghost stones. They are, I think, the most blood curdling folk lore in existence, and I am sorry space forbids my giving a few specimens But the noises heard in the Suhurelf lower can be explained without recourse to supernatural agencies The building is now used as a reservoir connected with the Moscow water supply As residents in Moscow fell on the word " supply ' here is merely a bit of pleasantry on the part of the authorities, but steps are being taken to have the town better served in this matter I ookuiL, past the lower towards the outskirts of the city you see forests which are rccedinrevery year as the city advances The trees are used to build the houses which stand in their place but still there is tim bore 1 cauntryatretchiii"bickn8faruB}ou can see The trees are of course bare now, but they grew so thick that the woods in their winter dress do not look gaunt or scraggy towards the right (the east) is the Sokolniki park lins IS a of unions resort of the people the Hcgcntspark or 1 Fitzroy gardens of Moscow It is here that Muscovite parents g ) with their children for mi article, on Sun d ii afternoons It is a queer sight on a fine Sunday afternoon to see the swarms of of children here They are rolled up and swathed in furs like little mummies The runabout as best they can in their hampered condition they cannot advance themselves by their arms for their hands are pact e 1 into tiny mules They were cheerful and happy in the brisk free" air with their little head like eyes shining out of their funny flat fat faces The it is a perfectly thick with smaller balloons striped in different colours you Moscow club I a 1 illoon seems the favourite toy- what a wooden horse is to me I ucJish one On the other side of the town you can see the 1 ire 1 ctrolTsl y park and just distill gush rising above the trees the great cemented round dome of one of the number less palaces of His Imperial Majesty who never uses them shut up as he in most of the year in the comparative security of Gatchini Nearer us beside the Smolensk railway line is the elliptical shape I racecourse A racing man accustomed to 1 pain I onf, champs or Flemington would smile at its smallness and there is not even a shed on it which would answer to the description of grandstand But here they only (o in for trotting races and the horses run round and round the course a ridiculous number of times Last trotting seems to be natural to every Russian horse but it was the only good pace of any horses I saw in Russia Walk they will not gallop they cannot and canter on the slippery winter roads they dare not Before coming down we take a last general look round The most extraordinary thing in the view of Moscow is the extent of country seen in the middle of a great city Land and room seem to be of no consequence 'Those who laid out Moscow thoroughly realised the fact that Russia is a big, wide stretching place, and that there was no necessity for cramping a favourite at.

We can Sinn up our impressions of this view easily enough for beauty it is unrivalled, for architectural style Moscow is extraordinary; for extent it is surprising, for interest unsurpassed Granting all this, the plan of Moscow might be described in the same way as snakes in Ireland or kangaroos in Russia If Moscow ever had any regular geometrical plan, that plan is now where the snows fire which covered the great city this time last year.
