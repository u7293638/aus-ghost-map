The two elderly ? sisters diB-L coursed together with this object for the public* benefit, and were satisfied that I atleast under*r stood them. They were inclined to patronise me, till they found that I talked with the fat farmer : on the other side. He was a good kind of man, and I was glad to converse with both him and his. intelligent companion, who appeared to be a , tradesman. Tho remaining occu- - pant of the compartment was : a silent man; in; the corner, .-about, whom I should. ; not have troubled myself,; had not his jproceed-!. ings been somewhat, eccentric. For, at least tw .: hours he did not address a single word to, his; HV1AV IT IUUI V1AUAO) I/MV, UlllU^UUJ V l^aU, UXlU ' - XjiKj VTO™ paper. When, he had; exhausted .the contents of; the journal, he pulled a, carpet-bag, from, undor, the .seat, unlocked it, and took from its recesses: a small. bottle carefully wrapped in a red silk' handkerchief. The bottle, I should - say, held, about eight, ounces of; what was apparently, clear L- waten /The silent, man replaced ithe; carpet-bag,- and then leaning back, in his seat, held: tho' bottle horizontally before him, at the distance of ? about six inches from his eyes. : ?'.,...-.. : If a man, is reduced, to read the advertise ment sheet of the Times, is absorbed in the: trashiest ypllow-backed : novel, or even proceeds, to cat his sandwiches like a bp.nr. vnn Vlnn'fc scrutinise, his mipyements. But when a person, observed to , be peculiarly , taciturn ; in manner,' continues; for half an hour gazing fixedly through.- : a bottle , placed at a peculiar angle, and never moves a muscle of his face, you begin to specu-, late on his mental state— think, what next? and then remember the approaching Box-tunnel. . The old ladies looked at the silent man with, unfeigned astonishment, and made dumb mprt tifos at each other, and got very . uneasy. '..,'. I noticed thaj the man of the bottje .had con-, tracted a most sinister squint in the course b£ his singular . act of investigation. Unable any longer to restrain my curiosity, I said, leaning towards him, 'Excusq me, sir, but do you sea anything remarkable in that bottle that you. look at it so attentively ?' ' ' No answer came from the silent man, and. every one looked up and cleared their throats. Every momont the squint became more fright ful, and the mystery moro incomprehensible.' ' Do 'co nudge him, sir,' said tho farmer to' me. 'It misgives me he isn't i' his right mind omehow.'^ ' Sister,' cried tho eldor ot thetwo ladies, 'what shall we' do ? I can't stand'this tuij iunjjoi. mole io uu Bojiug wuai no may do next.' 'What' 'ave ye got in' that eer bottle, sir?' said the farmer, emboldened by increasing- curiosity; 'Us in our parts would consider it : a bit queer to go glowering at a bottle in that fashion.' No answer. Tniswas not to be endured rso I tappe'd the shouldor of the silent-man, andrepeateamy question about the ' bottle in sufiiciontly loud tones. 'You have interrupted me most unfortunately,' said! the owner of the bottle. ' '?

He then goodnaturcdly exv - plained 'to' 'me that the, bottle contained mes merised water; and added that it; was given to him by a friend who was. a great believer : who told him. that if' ho .would; look- at the bottle ?steadily for; a certain time, keeping his mind entirely abstracted, 'that ho would be able toisee past events which .. had occurred to himself and others.
