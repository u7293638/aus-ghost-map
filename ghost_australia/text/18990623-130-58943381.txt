Original Poetry. THE FLOATING EXEMPTION. A peaceful spot is Reedy Creek. the folks that live .rnund They keep themselves (when they've a show) by working underground, And when once a miner strikes the Creek, a hard tax on his brain Is to raise the needful capital to take him off again. But they've lately heard a rumor, which has filled their hearts with hope, Of comipg English capital for which there's plenty scope; And the men who've worked and waited till they scarcely have a coat Now are building their ambitions on the mine that's going to float. Butalasl I'm very sceptical, 'tis my most glaring fault, But to swallow things (gone stale for years) requires a lot of alt ; I have heard the yarn so often, you'll excuse me if I doubt, For the only time this mine did float ('twas cured by baling out). If you patronize the racecourse and you lose your bit of tin, Then religions folks will tell you gambling is a deadly sin; But your winning chance is greater if you patronize the tote Than by backing your opinion that thismine is going to float. Unbelievers number many, but there are a faithful few Who will tell you confidentially there was eight.ounce stone in view When the mine suspended working and im. poverished Reedy Creek, But if asked what caused the stoppage their excuse is very weak. That the mine is good and solid all the Reedy Creekers know, But the way that vendors fence it in gives honest men no show; And when this generation's dead and crossed in Charon's boat, A broker's ghost, no doubt, will boom the mine that's going to float. A.M.C., Reedy Creek.
