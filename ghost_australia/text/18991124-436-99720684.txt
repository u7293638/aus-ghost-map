FRIGHTENED TO DEATH. STARTLING EXPERIENCES OP SALVATION ARMY LASSES. A correspondent sends the London Daily Ohronicle the following startling narrative: — The peace of a select circle in Oxford isjuofc now considerably disturbed by the tact having leaked out concerning a very thrilling ghostly visitation which hap pened a lew weeks ago in sd old house, re puted for a long time past to be haunted. No tenant had been found sufficiently bold to hire it nnti! lately, when some young ladieo connected with tbe Salvation Army, under the lead of Misa W ? a well-kaown worker among the poor, ventured to take it off the landlord's hands for a small ren tal. The first night they slept there they were much disturbed by uncanny noises and by strange sounds of the moving of furniture. Determined to discover the truth, they sei to work in a very methodical way by flouring tbe staircase, so as to detect footsteps, and by pasting up the fireplaces. They, moreover, induced the policeman to watch the house, so as to prevent any knavish attempts upon their credulity. The result was highly unsatis factory, for on the second night of their stay they all saw the figure of a woman apparently issue from the wall, and pass up the staircase and vanish. Miss W— — declares that the apparition actually ' passed through her own person, as through a door.' On tbe folllowiDg nighfc Miss W ? was upstairs, the other two ladies remaining in the parlor. Suddenly Miss W ? heard an awful scream, and rashed down to see what had happened. .On the stairs she was mat by the ghost, . which occo more ' passed through her.' Nothing daunted, the brave lady pro ceeded to look f r her ooinpanions. She found one of them in strong convulsions, and the other io a dead faint. The sad part of the Btory is that one young lady has since gone raving mad from the effeots of tbe fright, and the other died a few days ago from the same cause. The ghost is that of a tall female in a long grey drees or robe.
