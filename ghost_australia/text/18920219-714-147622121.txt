LEFT UNDONE. £By .Mabqaret\ J2. It isn't the thing you do, dear; It's the thing you've left undone Which gives you a bit of headache At the setting of the sun—' The tender- word forgotten, The letter yon did not write, THe flower you might ltaye sent, dear, ATe your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of heartsome counsel. Yon were hurried too much to say. Tl e loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That you had no time or thought foi With tronbles enongh of your owi. The little act of kindness, So easily out of mind ; - >' Those chances to be angels . j Which all-we mortals find ; j They come-in night and silencer Each chill, reproachful wraith— ; When hope ib faint and flagging And a blight has dropped on faith For life is all too short, dear, 1 And sorrow is all too great - To suffer our slow compassion ( That tarries until too late. .. V ■ And it's not the thing you do, deaj; It's the thing you leave undone Which giveB yon the bit of headache At the setting of-the sun. -
