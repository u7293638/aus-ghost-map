W ' indwi*tllisflaU6rinSas8uraaceringin6 I 'n &r; e**8 * found myself alone in the 1 Looted room at Warnef ord Abbey. ? I looked curiously around it. A charm M jog room certainly, bat haunted, the haunted wa^HowtbeI*antfid room at Waraeford ^toey, ?P^Ui about %b well known as the iiBt2nted ^P^aMin Berkeley square, and ioryesre ii H had been closely lofted against all possible ^B . intruders. m'1 K was an understood fact that the late Sir ? Ciurlea Warnef ord did not like any mention 8 oJ the Warneford ghost to be made in his I presence. ? There bad been a charming mystery about 8 the Warneford haunted room. Everyone 8 told & different story about it, and everyone me quite sure that his version of it was the true one. Some people swore it was a man ; gome people knew {or a fact it was a women -, others were sure it was a monBtcr, too dread ful in its hideou&neEB; to b9 described, and others had been told, on reliable authority, that it had a tail and cloven feet, end its form altogether was the reverse to heavenly. Bat when Mary's husband, the present baronet, came into the property, which he did very shortly before the time this story begins, he took quite an original view of the cue, and proolaimed for and wide that there was no ghost at all, much less a monster. Mary backed him up about it. They un locked the room, had it thoroughly done up and refurnished, and gave it to be understood ihat they conld cot tinderetacd how anyone in his senses could possibly have believed that there conld have been a word of truth in any of those old, foolish, superstitious etoiies. And it was thus Mary coolly introduced the. first guest into that haunted room. Did I quite like it when I found myself slone there ? 0! course it in nice to be told that you possess plenty of common eense, and that your nerves are good ; and Equally, of course, to proclaim yourself no wi*cr than your neighbors, and your nerves only indif ferent, in the tsce of such high praise, is a moral impossibility ; bet there is a great deal of difference between proclaiming a thing and thioking it. My duty to my hostess had foroed me to ireat the matter in a conventionally light manner; but no sooner did I find myself alone than I began to think that there is an unnecessary amount of conventionality in the world, and that if one might sometimes indulge in an outbreak of sincerity it would be an infinite relief to one's feelings. But I had not indulged in one, and there I was in the haunted room, feeling very much aethe man who once jumped a big fence by accident, and ever afterward had to keep up his oharaoter ae a hard rider, muet have felt. I gazed around the room in an awestruck I manner, and came quickly to the conclusion that the thing I liked the least in it wae the bed. A heavy, dark, old bedstead, on which was carved innumerable extremely unattrac tive objects. Heads of murderous-looking men and women, interwoven among horrible, open-mouthed animals, which had never been copied from any of the species supposed to have csmo out of lbs ark, and were not the 1«eb ghaEtly becauEc their proportions were a phyEieal impossibility. No. I certainly aid not like the bed in which 1 was doomed to sleep that night at all. However, lucky for my peace of mind, I had sot much time to spare in meditation. We had arrived just in time to dreea for dinner— paps, Molly and I — and when Mary left me I had only half an hour in which to unpack my dressing-case, rummage in my box for Bome evening clothes, and dre&s; my EeU for dinner. Molly waB the beauty of our family, and, therefore, of course, monopolised the almost undivided attention of our maid. We spent a pleasant enough evening. Mmj understood thoroughly how to keep things going, and it was long after twelve o'clock when we ladies trooped upstairs to bed, Molly came into my room for a few 1 moments, and commented oondesoendingly ? opon the fact that it was a nioe room. I ? fancied she was rather annoyed to find it ? much larger and more elaborately furnished ? than her own. ? Molly was a capital girl in some ways, but I !?' * *'^e ePoilt *n others, and she used to ? jike to be thought a very important young ? »fly, and to get the beet of everything.

Just as she was getting into bed her atten tion waa attracted by my friend, the bed stead, and ehe peered curiously at it fcr several minutes in her nesr-sighted way. ' i call that distinctly nasty,' she re marked with would-be gsiety. ?? I wonder if one can sleep comfortably in that bed ?' 'Shall we try?' I returned, euiUQg my tone to hers ; and before long we both had our heads on the piliowe, and silence reigned in the haunted room. So complete was the Bilence that I believed Molly to have gone to sleep almost im mediately. I was rather restless myself, but was just dozing of! at last, when alolly turned over so violently two or three timeB that Ehe left me absolutely without bed clothes. I was obliged to remonstrate, al though reluctant to do so because of her good-nature in coming into my haunted room with me. *' You pulled all the bedclothes off when you turned over the last time, dear,' I pro tested gently. '-I really should not have disturbed yon about it if you had left the sheet, but — ' ' Pray take them all,' she replied shortly, Molly's temper was rather shore sometimes. ' Thib is a most uncomfortable arrange ment.' ' Do not be cross,' I suggested calmly. ' Let us go to sleep,' ehe agreed. This time nothing happened to disturb as, and we both did go to sleep, and slept for several hours, When 1 next awoks 1 did so with a start, and trembling all over sat bolt upright in bed. My breath camo in quick, spasmodic gasps, mj heart beat wildly, and my eyes be came fixed in a horrid stare upon the curtain which covered the secret door. Undeniably there were footsteps coming e lowly and stealthily down the hidden stair case ! The fire burnt dimly in the grate, casting an unnatural, ghostly light over the scene, and horribly weird did that large, oak pannelled room look by that feeble, flickering light. Utterly powerless to move or speak, I sat there in a waking nightmare as those foot steps come nearer and nearer, until at last they stopped juet outside the door. I tried to close mj eyes; but no, some etrange, uncanny influence seemed to hold them riveted upon the curtain, which pre sently was slowly drawn aside. Very stealthily the emaciated figure of a very tall woman entered the rocm. Slowly and noiselessly this black-robed figure crossed over io one cf the windows, pulled back the curtains with a long blut- white hand, and siood gazing outward in the soft brilliant light of the full moon. Still unable to stir a ficger or utter even a 6icgle word, I seemed to live a lifetime, while that shrouded figure stood there in that weird light with its back toward me. Suddenly it moved, turned toward me, and began to rapidly move across the room toward the bed in which 1 lay. Murder and insanity were plainly visible upon tbe face of the woman who approached me. Her long cloak was thrown back, and in her right hand Bbe held a large and extremely awkward looking knife. But, ah, Heaven, the relief of it ! It. waa a living woman with whoarl had to deal ! Another second and I had roused Molly, and was out of bed, struggling with my foe, whom I bo much surprised by the quickness of my movements that, with only the matter of two unpleasant gashes:, one on my band and another on bers, I succeding in wreBting the knife from her and throwing it far away out of the open window. Then it merely became a case of physical strength ; and, as I waa luckily a Btrongly built woman, I held my own very satisfac torily against her, nntil Molly brought every one in the house into the haunted room by her screams in the corridor outBide it. It proved to be the housekeeper, who had lived at Warnefold for nearly fifty years, and whom no one 'had ever connected with the ghost in the haunted room, although the (servants declared that they had always known that she suffered from fits of insanity, ' hot that (hey had never cared to mention it, knowing thatebe was a favorite and a valu able old rervant.
