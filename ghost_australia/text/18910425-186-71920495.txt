One of tbosesoft, kmg-oontiniied summer rains which ponr down from morning to night without any hope of change, refreshing and restoring everything that had began to droop in the too fervid son, bat shutting the doors of the bonBeagauut the all-pervading moisture, and m-Mimd! rambles impossible. Few thingsare more depressing to a heart already deeply weighted than this persistent rain. The grey of the sky, the patter on the leaves, the monotony of the long hoars increases every burden. Even in the happiest circumstances the prisoners indoors long {or something to happen, for somebody to come. And it may be believed that to Agnes in the fever of her anxiety every hoar seemed a year long. This night or to morrow might be the decisive tune. The secrets of life or death were in those alowly psaang moments, the balance alowly moving to one aide or another. She vent through all her so-called duties, the UtUe domestic things she had to do, the little nothings that seemed, oh, so unimportant, so futile, in face of the great thing that was about to be decided. She asked herself how could she endure to do *j|^rn) to order the little dinner, to superintend the little economies while Mar. lay dying. Bot had she been -with Mar. what could she have done! Sat and looked on in the most desperate suspense, still able to do nothing for him, to do nothing for anybody, to wait only till the end should come. There came a moment, however, when the courage of Agnes failed, and she conld bear it no tnOECL ^£e told her w?.f»»* again that she had a beadacfae, & pretence which Uaiy seemed to understand f Tfritir no Questions ? and vonld go early to bed. But she did not go to bed. It seemed something to ait up, to mt im-»iiaiiv the tuzU of the nurse, the pratt* bQtty of the change with the intensity of feeling if not of presence. When Agnes closed her eyes she seemed to see the whole scene— the room with its shaded light, the . wasted form scarcely visible in the bed ; the nurse— asuentfigure— watchingtlielongahoure through. She did not know that the nurse who was theif .with die boy waa one who did not hope — which was a thing which would have added heaviness to the vigfl had she known it. Shehadnottiieheaittogotobed. It waned somehow as if she were duing something for him to sit up and count the hoars and spend her sonl in broken breaths of prayer. Oh, how broken, how interrupted wits a hundred fantastic uncontrollable imaginations! Still it was something to join herself to the vigu, if no more. She was so absorbed in her own deep anxiety and draughts that ahe did not hear any move ment in the house, and thought nothing bat that the household was asleep and hushed at ita usual early hoar. And when she heard a. stealthy step come to her door after midnight, Agnes's mind was so confused from reality by that vigil that she sprang op with a breathless terror lest it might be the nurse coming to call her to tell her the change had come, and that Mar's life was fading away. She made a swift step to the door and opened it, nuable to speak : but only found lady Frogman:'* maid outside with an anxious face. ' Oh, Mi« Wll, I'm so glad you're up, 'she said; 'I wish you would come to my lady she is not herself at aJL I can't tell what is the matter with her.' 'Hasn't she gone to bed, Eonl?' 'I got her to bed, ma'am, quite comfortable I thought ; but I stopped about doing little things, for I saw ahe was wakeful ; and then all at once she got up and called me and caught me by the aim. 'Ford,' she says, looking in my face very seriously, 'who was it that said. May he grow up an idiot and kill yon!' Who was it, who was it!' 'Oh, my lady, I don't know,' I Baid ; ' I never heard the words before.' ' It was a dreadful thing to say,* ahe cries, always looking at me. 'Ford, do you think words like that ever come true ?' Perhaps I was too bold. Miss HOI, but I spoke op and said, ' No, my lady, I'm sure they don't : for if they did «od Almighty would be putting us in the power of the worst and dnadrullest— and He would never do that.' ? No, Ford, He would never do thsx,'she said, with the tears iu her dear eyes. Oh, Miss HOI, there's sane change coming. I don't know what it is. And now she's tryinc all her keys upon that box we brought from the Fferk. 'We've not been, able to find one that would open it ; but I got another bunch just now, and while she was busy I thought Td come and call you. Don't be frightened. Miss Hill. I don't think it's a change far tire worse.' 'Oh, Ford,' said Agnes, 'it is just the bitterness of life. It's* change that tnUcome too hue. On, my boy ! it must be his dear spirit that is moving his mother's heart.' ?' Lot's hope it's something better than that. Let's nope it means good news,' said *e woman, who knew a great deal of die family in her long service, and nearly if not all, its mysteries. But Agnes, whose heart was very heavy, only shook her head. When she went into her sisters room Mary was standing against the light, a white figure wrapped in a white dressing-gown. Her partial confusion of mind, the subdued and quite life she had ed, her exemption from strong emotions, had cent an air of comparative youth about her. Her hair was partially grey, but it care no appearance of age to the face, which had the appearance of one purified and refined from earthliness by long misfortune and trouble. She had lighted a number of candles, which encircled her with light, and was standing looking down into the box which was open on the table, with a strange air of tremulous discovery, indecision, terror, and* joy, like one who has found out some astonishing thing which she cannot believe yet knows to be brae. She turned half round with a warning movement, as if begging not to be disturbed, then suddenly putting out her ^°'^ drew Agnes close to her. 'What is that ! Do you know what it is?' she said. The only answer Agnes made' was with a burst of tears: 'Oh, Mary I Oh, my dear! my dear !' she cried. A smile was on Mary's face — a strange, tender smile, full of all the softness of her veiled and gentle soul. She took out «™™»- thing tenderly and reverently, as if it had been a sacred thing. The curious nurse, peering behind these two absorbed women, expecting to see some mystery, felt herself come down from imaginative poetic heights to the commonest familiar ground when she saw what it was. Ford almost laughed with the surprise, but dared not, so strong was the sensation of passionate feeling that Beemed to £11 the air. What Iddy Frogmore took from the box was the first little garment that is ever put npon a chad. A little film of lawn, not much more ;' the most delicate and softest of fabrics made to fold over the delicate body, in exquisite softness and whiteness, as if the finest faiiy web of earth had been chosen to wrap the little thing newborn, come from among the angels. It was unfinished — a narrow line of very fine lace only half sewn round the little sleeves. Mary took it up and held it in her hands, spread out upon them. Oh, what soft suggestions of trembling happiness, of wondeexut anticipation of tender mystery, and dreams were in it ! ' What is this !' she said, in a whisper ; ' tell me what it is.' Agnes bad pat her arms round her sister, leaning upon her — she who was usually the strong one, the supporter and prop ? and s*'«1 her head on Mary's shoulder. The sight of the little tender relic, so familiar, so full of angtreetion on this night of fate, overcame her altogether. Oh, to tiiinV of the infant for whom that little wrapper of softness had been made ; whom hie mother, who had made it with such holy and tender thoughts, had never known ; who was lying now between life and death* perhaps having crossed the awful boundary lingering near them, breathing into her longcloaed and etupified heart. Agnes could mate no answer. She sobbed convul sively upon her sister's shoulder. 'Oh, my baby, my boy, my little Mar., my little Mar * ' ahe cried, with a poignant tone of anguish which pierced the soft air, the soft silence of the night, like nometiiiog keen and terrible, a sharp blade and point of passionate human feeling, Mary held np the stronger womati with a tally of her own strength, bat did not move otherwise. Her eyes were full of tears, but there was no anguish in them. She said in a low voice, like the coo of a dove, *' No one need tell me. I know. It was I who made it for my baby — my baby ! And he was born. £ remember everything now. The old mother was there — my mother — don't you know — and so proud- And my old lord, my dear old lord— with his heir ? Agnes. Agnes V she cried, suddenly, ** what have you done to me, to keep me eo long from my boy V Agnes sank down upon her knees on the floor. She held up her clasped hands as if she were praying to the white figure that stood over her. 'It c^-n do no harm now,' Bhe cried. 'What does it matter if ve all go mad ? I think I shall : to see her remember him, to see her rind out the truth too late — too late ! Ok, God, that I should have my answer now when it isaflover. It would have been better if then* iiatl been no answer — uo answer now.' 'Agnes, said Mar}', gently layiugahand upon her head. She held the precious littlegaruieot in her other hand, and kissed it, pressing it to her lips and her cheek. ** Agnes,' she taitl iu her soft voice, pitying her slater '& emotion, ** I do not blame you, dear. I have been kept in the dark, I don't know why ; I have done many strange things not knowing. Perhaps toy — my baby — my boy has been injured. God forbid. But I don1! blame you, deux. If he has been injured we can put it right. All can be put right now we know. You meant it, I aui sure, for the best. Agues, I never, never, will blame you, dear. Oh, rise up now and tell me, till we all you have kept from me ; teli me everything about my boy.' ' I think tiod lias Ukcu him,' cried Agnes on her knees. 'This was the night — I think he must be here to have found his way to his mother** heart. Oh Mar., Mar ! if you arc dead, if you hear, say something, let us see you one niouicn , one m u o jo go to heaven. Une moment, one moment, Mar!' The maid who was standing by, and whom these words froze witli terror, thought to her dying day that she had board — something, she knew not what, like tlie passing of a soft foot step, like a subdued breath, and would have turned and fled had she nut thought herself safer in the romn with the lights than in the dark passages outside. This impulse of terror was stopped in Ford's mind by the look her mistress gave her— -which was a look which Ford had exchanged with many persons over Lady Frogmore1* own head — a look of piiy and appeal, consulting her what was Co be done for die distracted woman mt their feet, 'ibis carious turning of tables stupefied Ford. It was as if an infant from its cradle bad turned and bid its nurse care for its mother. *' All thus has been too much for her,' said Lady Frogmore. ' Help me to put her in my bed, Ford. She and I have always been together. We slept together when were two little girls in the old Vicarage, Agnes, let me lift you, dear; don't strain yourself or take any trouble. Well stay together this wonderful night. And when you're able you tell me : let me lift you first ? ' *' You *' cried Agnes, stumbling somehow to her leet. She added in a humble tone. coming to herself, ' I have forgotten my duty, Mary. Don't think any more of me It was more than I could bear, just for a moment.*1 *' Yes, I Baw it was too much. Ford, do you fr-Mnlr you could deep on the sofa, just to be at hand if we wanted anytHing ? I am not easy about her. Well stay together to night, lie down and I will sit by you, and when you are able you will tell me ? ' ' My lady, it would l»e much better for you to get your natural rest.' ** Mary, you must not sit up wilJi me ?' ?'And why not, I ahonld like to know,' said Mary. 'Don't you know I'm very happy to-night. Don't you know I've found out what has been on my mind bo long. I knew there was something. I have1 never said any thing to you, but it has l-een, oh, so heavy on my mind 1 Something, something that bad gone away from me that I could not get back, and when I dreamt of my old lord he was always frowning, always angry. Agues J I was making this, and mother was sitting there, and you pouring oat tea, when — w« were all vesy happy — I remember iny thread breaking just there, when I had nearly finished And I turned to take another, and — then there was something that happened before ? before lie was born.' ** He was born that night,' cried Agnes, 'God bless him.' She was very pale, and her eyes had become dry and shone as if with fever. In her mind there was a deep wonder whether Mar. heard her, whether it would please him, though he was dead, to have the story of his infancy told to his mother. And with this half distracted thought came one that was quite real, quite rational ; the anrioos determination to shut out all reference to Letitia's visit from the still wavering inind of her sister ; to keep that which was the key of all that followed from her recollection if '* He was born that night— Cod bless him !n said Mary slowly. Then she added, 'I remember a cluster of people bending over him, and the light on father *d bald bead, and my dear old lord with his face down quite dose, and the doctor standing saving some thing about the child. And then — and then — what happened ? I remember no more.' ' You were very ill, oh very ill ; so ill that — Oh,' said Agues, 'don't make tne think of that terrible time.' 'Ah!' said Mary, a quiet seriousness coming over her face, though her line still smiled, ' you thought I was going to die.'1 Agues made no reply. 'Bat even that,'1 said Lady Frugmore, ' was not enough to make you all deceive me so cruelly. Xo, no, my dear, I did not mean cruelly. You vrast have thonght it for the best. One can but do what one thinks is for the best. Was there ever such a thing before that a woman Bhonld live and never know. Do you remember what the Bible says, 'Can a woman forget her child, that she should not ?* Ob,' cried the poor soul, ' what you have taken from me ! How much you have robbed me of?' She paused a moment with her hands clasped, with the consciousness of wrong on her face. Then that sterner mood died away in the old sweet way of wmsItimj* the best of it, which Agnes remembered with a melting of her heart had always been Mary1* way. ' Never mind,' she «aj^. ** Sever mind. I know now, and yon meant it all for the best' CllAPTEK XLJX Mary sat by the bed in which Agues lay for nearly half the night. She was so determined on this strange arrangement that her sister had to yield, aud as long as the darkness lasted, which iu July moves slowly, much more thaii in June, the conversation went on. Ford lay on the sofa, in a distant corner and slept soundly, but neither of the ladies had any inclination to slee^. It distracted the thoughts of Agnes from the possible awful Importance of this nigbr in Mar's life to tell Mar.'s mother everything that had hapi-cned, dwelling as briefly as possible upon the illness which hail separated Mary from her child, anil endeavouring to blur over us best she o-uld the blank which that illness luul left heuinil in Mary's miud. It was indeed il very broken would have seen tbe most bcfxihis gap*3 and deficitiMces. But to Mary the interest of the details hi which Agues took refuge to avoid the more serious questions wm so great tli&l; it was always possible to oarry her past a dangerous point, and the murmurs of tut two voices going ou all tlirouglt tW night., low, breathed into each other's cars, was more like the whisperings of two girls over their little secrets of love than the clearing up of what was almost a tragedy, the revelaciouof die strangest, troublous, story. Mary herself was Lost iu a still vague and tremulous y*\\\ all innoceut and soft as the little garment that had been the liappy cause of it, pusset&iu;^ as yet no coniplicatiouu, reulisiu^ nothing but that she I tail been proved to have tliu dearest (jf all possessions to a woman ? a child, a. baby, who to her thoughts was n liaby still, and at present linked himself but diiuly to any idea of further development*. To l-e told that lie was Mar. still gave little enlightenment to her mind, which di-l not kimvr Mar. Ooniti thing that could be wrapped still iu that little film of innermost appan-1 — aitlinugh it was at the same time something which could cousctously respond to her affection, reflect his father's image as Agnes said he did— something that was at once a loving human creature and on infant entirely her own. Tais was Mary's conception of the child whom she had discovered as if it bad been a jewel that was lost. She was not shaken by her dis covery as had been feared. She took it sweetly, quietly, as was natural to her gentle bouL Happily it had come without any harsh discovery, in the gentlest way, and as yet there seemed nothing but hftppjm»g* in the lifting of the veil, the opening up of the old life. Mary cried as sat and listened, shedding many soft tears. Her eyes shone behind them with joy and peace. She bad found what ahe bad lost No more would her old lord frown upon her in her dream ; no more would ahe feel that imperfection, that some thing which ahe conld not understand, the mystery which had haunted her life, though ahe did not know what it was. She could not, perhaps would not, for even in thi* feeble state there is some moral control, allow her self to think further. It was enoogh that ahe had come out of the ^*rfc^w^. and ?***?* the light was sweet. When the daylight began to come in at the window jtm^ mftkf the candles pale. Lady Frogmore rose, u light and serviceable as if it had not been she who had been surrounded with such anxious cares for go many years, *»tm^ placed npon such a platform of weakness and disadvantage. She was not weak nor at any disadvantage now. Her maid slept. Her sister, who had minis tered to her all these years lay silent, looking on while she pnt out the *-«^i-i)«?fl and dosed the shutter on the window. ** I am «?**»'?» ir|g to bed,' she said, ** if you will make room for me, Agnes : not because I am tired, for I could sit and hear of him for ever, but be cause we must be early astir to-morrow, and I suppose rest is necessary, I don't feel any need of it,' she said, with a soft laugh. ' Kone at alL I feel young and strong as if I could do anything. I feel about twenty, Agnes. But make a little room and I think I shall sleep. It is like old times,' she said as she took her place by her Bister's side, ** like old, old times, when the little girls were always together. 'Do you remember th* time when we two were the little girls.** They H1'1^ *rh other Itmghing And crying over that old recollection. Ho» long, how long B£o ? And all life had passed hip*^ frhpn, and here they were, two sisters growing old, with wrinkles upon the faces which the early light revealed, despisinc a^ tine tender fictions of the night. Alary soon slept as ahe had said, fearing nothing, innocent in the discovery she had «n^-*. She fell asleep HItp a rfipd with the light of the summer morning growing on her fwy. But Agnes could not sleep. When her sister's regular breathing showed the deep repose in which the was wrapped, Agnes stole out of bed and went to the furthest window where there was a glimmer of the rising sun, and knelt down there in the dawning ray turning her fare* towards th* east. Why she could not have told. To turn her face towards the east was no spell, there was nothing in t-Tmfr to secure that her prayers should be heard. And it could not be BiU-l that she prayed. Her soul and body were both worn oat. She knelt there silent, her head bowed in her hands. The new day was bringing life or death to Mar.— which was it bringing, life or death? She knelt on silent, like an image of devotion. It was something at Least to avail that crLda, when it should come, upon her knees. Lady Frogmore slept till it was late, long after Agnes had dressed and came upstairs again to await at her bedside her sister's awakening with a little anxiety after all the excitement of the night. Mary had lain very etill ; she had not moved for hours, and was sleeping like a child. But when she began to give signs of waking, her appearance changed. She moved about uneasily, her face contracted as if with pain ; she put out her hands as if appealing to some one. Suddenly she sprang up broad awake in her bed. ' Ford I she cried, and then ' Agnes !' as ehe perceived her sister. Her breath came quick, a look of terror came over her face. ** Who was it?' she cried, 'Who was it— that said * May he crow up an idiot, and kill you ? ' Who «-a£ it, Agnes ?' ' Oh, my lady, my lady?' cried Ford from the other side of the bed. ' Mary I don't think of that, for God's sake.' ' Who was it I' she cried. ' It was to me it was said.' 'Oh. my lady/' said Ford, 'don't think of such dreadful things.' *- May hegrow up an idiot — and kill yon— ' It waa said to me — it was a curse upon my Itady — my child i Who said it Agues * — -you 'Oh. Mary, what dots it matter now? What harm could such wicked words do to any one. Yes — yes, it is true. Mar}-. I ought iwt to tell you, it was Letitia. Oh what -loes it matter now ?*' Miixv pu^ied her away, flinging herself out of iierbeu. ' Not matler 3 Ford, let me dress at ouee. Order the carnage. Tell int- what is the first train. We luust go at ouce by the first, train.' ?* Where, Mary* Oh, my dear, where?' '* She asks lae where*' cried Lady Frog more, appealing in her excitement to the maid. ** She &$k.s me where, aud £he knows my boy is in lIulL woman '& handd — my child, in that woman's tip mis : She said, may be grow up ou idiot — uiyj child, my babv ! and he is in her hands. Ou, quick, quick, give me my thingK ! Order the carriage '. There is a train, early, that we went by before. Oh, the slow, horrible train it is, I remember, stopping everywhere : but at least don't let -Is it to the Park, you are going, Mary*' ' Where else T' cried Lady Frogmore ; 'isuotiny child there ? anil iu her hands.' She was too impatient to accept the '*nM services of her maid, but dressed herself in wild haste, her trembling lmn-fo lyinjr strings aud fastening buttons all wrong, tier two attendants could do little but look on as in her agitation she snatched at everything. The gentle Mary, always so tranquil and mild, was transtigured with passion and eagerness. When she heard that it was too late, for the morning train it was a shriek rather than a cry which burst from her breast. 'Oh, why did you let me sleep? Why did I sleep ?' «he cried bitterly. There was no possibility of ?**! tiring her, no nra-ffn* of ex plaining bow they had arranged w»v*jjyiliint*' for her comfort that die might rest after her rmngTml Vyfi tfrri m * miri exhaustion. She, rest ! Mary, who had been the object of un ceasing care for years, whose every mood had been considered, and from whom everybody near warded and kept off any possible shade of annoyance, forgot all tbat in a moment. She became the Mary of old, she who was Letitia's right hand, she who spared no trouble, who drought of everybody but her self. Mary was as much surprised at being the first to be thought of, at having her rest cared for, as if that long time of care and observance had never been. ?* Best for me,' she cried, ' Yon should have known better, Agnes — you might have known I should not rest tiQ I had seen my boy.' She woke with out a cloud upon her memory of that fact, bat with this new dread sprung up in her mind which could not becalmed down. They set off in time for a later train after a weary interral of waitinc, an interval that seemed to both, be if it would never end. Mary hax been seized in the new sense of motherhood with a panic and fear of alarm which nothing could quench. She who had forgiven every thing to Letiria, who had thought of nothing either in her m'dp«« or her recovery but the interests of her former friend, now feared her as if she were a criminal, and felt that every moment the heir remained in her hands was a moment of danger. 'She will do him no harm,' Agnes tried to say. 'She is not kind. She does not love him, but she will do him no harm.' Mary would not listen to this voice of reason. The woman who had wished that the unborn child should grow np an idiot and kill his parents appeared in no light but that of a possible murderess to her who had newly discovered his existence and that she was his mother. She waved off her sister's soothing words. She put Agnes herself — Agues who had loved him always, who haxi been his first guardian, all the mother he had ever known — in a secondary place as one who could not divine the passion of the mother love. ' It is easy for you to speak,' she said, crying out in her impatience, that the horses crept, that they would be toe late for the train, 'and then mat train itself was like a country cart, and would not go. Then there came those long waitings at the junction, the interval between one little country con veyance and another. The rain of yesterday had all passed away. The day was bright, IHnBiininating'ihe face of the country, mock ing at the heaviness of the travellers. Lady Progmore ' was flushed and cdfKt3 full of inquiry, walking about during the times of waiting, explaining to everybody that she was going to her son, to bring him home, to the great confusion of those who knew her story, and knew too that Mar. lay dying. Her acquaintances looked at her with trouble and suspicion, looked anxiously aside at Ford, who followed her mistress abont as she walked up and down. Had poor Lady Frogmore's brain given way again, was what they asked each other with their eyes * But it was none of their business, and there was no one impor tant enough to interfere. As for Agnes, she was incapable of any activity. When she was permitted to be quiet' for a moment there fell upon her heart the other dreadful bnrden which Mary had not understood, which Agnes shrank from insisting upon. Was it all too bite, too late, a terrible irony of Providence which some tames seem to keep the word of promise to the ear, « well as the pagan fates to give when the gift is no loncer of any use t Was his mother hurrying in all the new passion of her love and trust to find no child, no eon, but only what was mortal, the poor cast-off garment of flesh that had once been her boy ? Was it all over t£at struggle? or had it per haps ended, as the nurse hoped, in life and not in death? As she approached the time when she should know, Agnes's mind began to play with this hope: tremulous gleams of happiness and possibility flashing before her eyes, which she dared not receive or dwell upon, but which came to her without any will of hers, flaming through the dark, lighting up fbe skies, then ainlrfni* into greater gloom than ever. While Mary walked about in the intervals of waiting, Agnes sat out of Right in the most retired corner she could find, dumb and faint with the awful suspense. She could not communicate to bur sister what she feared, yet feared dnnl-ly for the conse quence to Mary.il in the beat of her newly awakened feeling she should come suddenly against that thick 'blank of loss,. Oh, to forestall the wrong turn, to know what a few hours might bring forth — happiness, the perfection being, a new life, a brighter world —or nv *fapas1 misery, and death ? Thus the one sister sat dumb and incapable of speech, her throat dry and her lips parched, while the other all energy and eagerness soothed her impatience by movement aud eager com munication of her purpose — goin^ to tind her .boy. The railways have almost annihilated ?distance everybody says — and it is true. Bnt «nss lines have to be gone through, with many pauses, stoppages, and changes, there is nothing which gives the san.c impression of delay and miserable tardihood. To haste for a Httle time toiranls yonr end, and then to stop and spend an long a time or longer in aimless waiting, repeating the same again and again, in an afternoon's journey ' Ji't- waggon on the country road seems to be so low, so lingering, so impossible to quicken. It was dark when they arri vied at the nearest station to the Park, and then a long interval followed before they could obtain the broken-down rattling, clattering country fly which drove them six miles further to the Park. It was all that Agncs's lips could do to utter an inquiry 'How in Lord Frogmore*' when the keeper of the lodge awoke up out of his first :Sleep, stumbled forth to open the gate, half reluctant to admit visitcis at such an hour. ' I think I heard as the young lord's a bit better,' said the yawning lodge- keeper. Her heart leapt up, almost choking her in her sudden relief. But how did Ae dare to trust this indiflerent outsider, who cared nothing ? At least, at least, he lived still, which was i much. Mary had grown quite silent in the excitement of the arrival. She put her hand into her sister'E, and grasped it as if to keep herself up, but said nothing. They dis mounted out of the noisy fly at the end of the avenue, Mary obeying the impulse of Agnes, asking no reason. There were still lights about the upper windows, and a glimmer in the hall, the door of which was opened to them by a servant who was in waiting, qt^ who at tim looked as if he would refuse them admittance, but gave way at the sight of the two ladies. He gave Agnes in a subdued whisper the bulletin, 'A iitde better— fever diminished,' which in the insfaintitf'1'1'* and unspeakable relief, took all strength and power to more from her.after all her Bufferings. She leaned back upon Ford, nearly faintaig, her eyes closing, her limbs refusing to support her. In that moment Lady Frogmore drew her hand from her sister's. She asked no ques tions. No weakness or sinking of heart or courage was in her. She neither looked nor spoke to any one round her, but swiftly de taching herself, throwing ? off her cloak, disappeared up the great, partially-lighted staircase as swift and as noiseless as a ghost. {To be continued.)
