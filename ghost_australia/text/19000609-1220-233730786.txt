ChUrcH of England Harvest Festival On Sunday last (Whit Sunday), the Harvest Thanksgiving services were held at All Saints' Church of England, West Kempsey, and were well at- tended, especially in the evening, when every available seat in the large church was occupied. Fruits ' and flowers, farm produce, ferns and evergreens, festoons and floral designs, appropriate and well-executed texts all in tertwined with threaded golden grain were most tastefully arranged singly, or in happy groups, in every part of the- church. The effect in the evening when the lamps were lighted was most beauti ful. At the morning service the Vicar preached from the 26ih verse of the Gospel for the day, " The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost," and dwelt upon the ofiices of the Third Person of the Trinity and His influence in nature, in the affairs of the world, in church and in the hearts and lives of men. At 3 o'clock a Children's Service, well attended by parents and friends, was held, when the choir stalls were quite filled by a juvenile choir under the management of Mr. G. E. Thomp son, Miss Sutherland presiding at the organ. The Vicar first catcehised the children on the seasons of the church, especially . that of ' Whitsuntide and then addressed then on the 1st Com mandment. In the evening the Vicar preached a very thoughtful and appropriate ser mon from the 9th verse lxv Psalm, " Thou preparest them corn." Miss L. Lancaster presided at the organ and the large choir sang well together and very sweetly suitable hymns were selected. Bennets Service together with the Anthem " Ye shall dwell in the land" were rendered.
