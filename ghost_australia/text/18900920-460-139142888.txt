The letter in as follows' (lith regard to the liona-Gde ru es I oan only express my regret that the formation of such a code should have become neoeusary. J he colours of the leading Australian schools ought to be an ample iniarantte-of the good faith of their wearers. The fact, however, that the bead masters have deemed it neoessary to draw up speciBo regulations is a sufficient proof that there have been violations of that unwritten'oode which should b.- binding. It is idle to anrae that there have been hitherto no definite regulations. There is a rery simple rule the application of which would bare saved all the bitterness which has arisen on this quej. tion ; it is to treat others as you woala yourself he treated, to put no one in a team or orew about whom you feci your o; ponents would be diesatisQed, and in ease of doubt to write to your antagonists statin; all the circumstances of the case and asking for their opinion. What ponible cooi pan come from gamp; when one side feel that the other has strain d a point to win the victory 7 What is requisite is not a code ol rules but that chivalrous spirit, that love of faonout and fair play, which renders dispute impossible. Nevertheless, I trust the rules may be of tomi service." October 3, will most probably be the day on whicl the Public Schools second crews race will be rowed, Already the d Sprint coacbcs are getting the ran material into shape. At Geelong ihe most tucceestui of 1'ublic School coaches has (rot a four out, cf whoa he ea>s " I'liey promise ti be rather a difficult to; to get together owiwr to the fact thit the three (or. ward oars hurry the latter p.irtof the forward swing and do not hold the water with stroke. But the] have only bad two rows toirelil'-r so far, and I dan say the tub-pair will do a good deal for th mi." Ttai crew at present isStroke. B. James; 3, J. Bowler; 2, II. Whrtiucham; baw, U. V. Wetteuhali Weslcv Col'egc are hard at it at Albert-park undei the watchful i-ye of their mentor, Mr. K. A. Derrick. The crew is not finally chosen yet, bit will firobibli be as followsS roKe, It. U.

However, I trust tbe coach will 6end me news ol their ptegress. **» At the Melbourne Grammar'School triaMdnre have just been Itrli. Several very exciting races took p ace in th£ several rounds, and some taleqt .bas keen unearthed. The first round resulted In Singleton's crew healing Prell's bv one length and a quarter, M'I'herson's crew beat Payne's by two feet, and Par ton's boat was three feet Bbead of White's at tbe fi:ii-h. Pringlc had th: bye. In the second round M'Phersen'a crew beat Sinfrleton's easily, and Priugie'a four beat Paxton's ss they liked, Ihs final between ll'Phcrson's and Prlngle's crcwB waaafreat race, the former alter numerous misfortune* being beaten somewhat easily at tbe finish. Prihcletorew, which Wis thnnjht to have very little chance, showed good form, th* stroke showing himself to have the makings of a good o»r. Tbe winning crew are) Pringie (ttroke), Wood house (3),* liay (2), Olereland (bow). The pick of thc-se arc, I am informed, Prinze sna Paxton, who should make good men for the second crt\v. The next best nre Spence, Payne, Vert lloJ^'e. Woodhoufe, and Anderson. From this lot ilr. Bolcroft ought to tie able to turn out a good four to uphold the honour of 'he school. Last week, In speaking abou? the Geelonfc Gram mar School v. Wesley Col egc inatoh, I said of Wesley that "they made not even a feeble resistance. A correspondent writep to tay that " it is rather hard on the We»'}ey team \A eay this, as they played u thMr best form from tUltio finish." , I have been asked to remlr^ old Wesley collegians that the annual sports are fixed lor Slst October, when there will be tne n -ual Old boys' taccs for a cup at tlisunces 100, 300. and 408 yards.
