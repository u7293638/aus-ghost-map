POETRY AND TRIFLES. w THE DEKEL1CT. I am rolled and swung, £ am rocked and flung, 1 am hammered and heaved and hurled. I am tossed and wheeled, I am blown and reeled, And battered about the world. Or the pushing tide I rise and tide, Or loiter and loaf at ease ; With never a care, though foul or fair, I follow the foamy seas. Men come not nigh when they pass me by, For they fear me, every one, As I cleave the gsay of the dawning day. Or drowse in the summer sun. Past unknown isles, for miles and miles, I wander away to where The iceberg lifts and the salt spray drif is In the freezing Arctic air. I steal by the bars when the flame-winged stars .- ' - Have swarmed in the upper blue, And the glow and shine of the drenching like white fire burns me through. I haunt as a ghost the rock-girt coast, Where the bell-buoy loudly rings, And the breakers leap 'to the nughry sweep Of the night wind's sable wings. I shake and moan, I creak and groan, In the wrathful tempest when The old sea raves, and digs deep graves, For the jolly sailor men. What matters time or what the dime To a vagrant of the sea » To live or die, oh, naught care I ! There is no port for me. Herbert Bashford, in ' Songs from Puget Sea.**
