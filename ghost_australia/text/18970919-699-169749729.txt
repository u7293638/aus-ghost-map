After name No. '2 : the strenuons efforts every race writer has made to explain away with, ease aod agility Poniiano's delightful performance and the trouble each has taken not to hint eron one millionth part of what tbey wonld have said bed tbe same thing happened ifith a puny owner. Understand, right here, this psper don't aocnse anybody of anything, only ft matt to know it tome low, vulgar p~orman's horse had displayed such erratic form, would there hare been any explanations required to acooant for the reversal of form.? Doubtless every thing coold be explained all right, but as to our query — well, ask yourself the qnestion ? One writer suggested that Poeitaso was ' taken off his feet ' ia the early part of the taoe, which argument applies as well at any rate to Holbrook, end to a certain extent to OoiL Another scribe opinet that Positano 'may te a little unoertain in temptr,' or that being ,*a trifle short (like his baotom after wards) of work hit efiort on SMnrday told agalttt him.' By the aainted ghost of Win deyer and' £ ranker's best halo, mixed 1 and we seldom 8 wear that oath — effort;' Why he won easily. What ipn't said, and may be it the truett explanation, is tbat likely enough, theriden having so much weight in hand, reckoned he could rua over the field at any time, and to to keep bis mount from wolfing others, ran him along a bit wide. . Anyway all the ' ariskets ' agree unanimously in saying things will be different . about ths Oup tkit. Which provts two great facts — No, 1, that clrcamstanoss alter cites ; ' No, 2, that the rude etpftttlbn ' Rats I ' U still niefuL On Thursdty, in (he Graven, Fosituio tan a lot better. It was rumored he hsd a leg, and 'tia trne lua off fore fetlock on the inside might be a teeny bit puffy; on the other hand (not lag) it might hart besa the white being more Contpicuousa W* aren't otrtsin, for nobody suggested we should f*al * the spot.

Hi was kept in the rear nearly all the journey, and than made his ran from the tipn. The effort was well sustained biit it was too big an order and he succumbed to Delaware who was in front all tbe time. Again, of course, the w.£,e. form upset the bandioap ditto; in the Uetrop Coil gave Positano 17ib and a eheol of a doing, in the Oraven Positano gives Coil lib and turns th* tables. Whereby it teems that w.f.a. form itn't wotth it twopenny damn; ? » o I Ambsrits hat won two raws, tha secohd with a elonepenalty up. Therefore the many 1 headed Worshippers of the rising sun hart { made a little tin' god of him. Beaton for j whioh we can't exactly tee, Amberite is very i well and may b% ' is ? bit better than tha balance just now, but the balance an nothing wondsrful at prasenU Altogtther, the three year old'a torn ia sot majetlio, not half at impreauv* at John Lnoaa'- ohestor Harry Foran'a eheek. Not by a jog full. Consider the first three days now : Amberite beat Clarion with, Bay, a atone in hand in the Derby time 2min 4s$B6Ci Nor East adminia ters about th* aatne dose to Clarion in the Maiden, in 2min SB^sae. The time here it O^teo falter, but the weights were 161b less, For th* eake of argument let the timedif fertnoe even tbe wught differenoe, and it looks as if Amberite iaa't much better than NorSast, Aad we prefer theiatter's breed ing. Oome along to Bhymtr, who beatt Metford, By uttle it ia true, bnt had there been farther to go the heating would ! have been more pronoonoed, Khymet | it eaid to be better than Nor' East in pritau. So whefO ire you I At for Holbrook, in receipt Of lfilb turn Ambtrite, this eoa of* Loohiel in the Metrop gave the l)erby winner a dsuoe of a trouhoing ; but in the . Duff 1 Memorial milt at 9-10 and 8-10 respectively, Amberite beat- Holbrook after a muddling race by two lengths, in lmin 44£se-i and ve reckon had things been lively all the way, in lien of a quarter mile tpriht horns, Auibsrite wouldn't hare had thing* to Saitoh' hit own Way. He evidently like* tbingt to be eaty- gouig at ths bommtaoenlsnt. , doing oh to the Wyoombe, Snrvivo^ ooaesding 201^ beat Qlarion xather easier than when eonceding 251b he beat Holbrook, the comparative time being slower — i.&, tnilsb -2mia 3Sseo; lm | 3^ Smln £6^a»— and they coaldn't have run j another furloag -in lOsea So this makes altogethtx Holbrook read bttttr than Clarion, ! width Imtt-aamedi w* fUuly, waatt time^ ftitd U Ufcal? hi be mnoh more dangirodt at the book end, ot th* season.
