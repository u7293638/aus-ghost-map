Throughout the whole of the' S''ssion he has proved his prinoiplos, viL., to holp thoso who are unable to help thoemsolves, The masterly mannor in which lhe piloted the Hall case shows that his knowledge 'as well as his Sympathies were directed on the job; and ,we all know that when thb Doqtor has sot his mind upon anl objoot he will, fight to. the last to carry it out. The help hoe has boon to Railway omployods' nooeeds no fulsomo eulogy, for I would defoy any man in the Railway service to be able to stand forw trd and say that ovoi' a ro4ucst was refused, I am riot sending this as an aldvertisomont, for hoe does not nooeed it, but I fool that if' lie should, by any chaneo, lose the lday, the shame would rast upon the working non of the oommunity who did not help him through, as he has many times helped thom, at, I may say, ploronal expenso, At any rate I can speak 'on bellhalf of my own Union, and the unanimous opinion is, that ift' it rested with ,ie various membefrs no one lso would have it Ghost of a Show, Hoping that when the numlors go up we shall soO an ovorwholwinng majority in the g?l!al, Uilt ring, and over obliging, :)ot;ort's favor, I am, Sir, 18 No/aon Strooeet , ,A NELRON, Balaolaua, Gonoral SeoretarU, Oolober RIth, 1000, Vi UI.P, ,,U
