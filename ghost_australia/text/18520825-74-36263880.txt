LAUNCESTON EXAMINEi Wednesday, iAugust 25, 1852. EFFECTS OF CORN LAW REPEAL AN FREE TRADE. A LONDON journal has promptly respond to the appeal of Lord Derby, that t " country should. consider its position and cleverly exhibited .'he' consequences the enlightened policy- recently adopte In 1850 the paupers in England and Wal numbered 795,000: in 1851 they we reduced to 767,000. The value of artid of British and Irish produce exported 1850 amounted to £65,7356,447 ; in 18 it h ad increased.to. £68,492,659. It w confidently asserted that domestic indust ,would suffer by importations from abroa but the shoemakers of Stafford and Nortl ampton are informed, that while in 18I 22,330 pairs of boots and shoes were i ported, in 1851 only 19,900 pairs were fu nished by foreigners: So,'tbo, the Bethna green and Spitalfields weavers are reassured the import: of .foreign manufactured sil goods arhounted in 1850 to 1;026,636lbs, in 1851 it had fallen. to.632;7801bs. It wa also attempted to alarmr.the Coventry folk but their fears have been dispelled by th fact, thatwhile in 1850 324 5491bs, of sil and gauze ribbons were introduced, in 185 only 189,8791bs. were landed in England As for 'the Worcester glove manufaicturer they were said.to be doomed : the Freed would supersede them. But the oficm returns give a different account. In 185 3,260,000 pairs of foreign gloves were im ported; but in 1851 only 2,842,000 pair reached the British shores. The same tal is told of embroidery and needlework, camT brics and French.lawns, damasks and dia pers, plain and figured linens. The" fallace and folly of the protectionist cry that tihe country would be inundated with foreig goods,", and ..that honest manufacturer would be beaten in their own markets, - thus disposed 'of-laid like a ghost at th' "short wee hour ayont the twal." B there is another aspect of the question There' are articles which England can1ltl produce, and can only be obtainei exchange' for her manufactures. The im portation or tea increased from 50,512,000 lis. in 1850, to 71,466,0001bs. in 1851. Sugar,'to sweeten the ten, increased from 6,290,000'owts. in 1850, to 7,940,000 owts. in 1851. Coffee increased from 50,800,000 Ibs. in. 1850, to .53,000,0001bs. in .1851. Cocoa increased from 4,480,0001bs. in 1850, to 6,770,O00lbs. in 1851. We conclude this' brief summary' in the' words of the writer in the. Daily News, 'to rwhom we' are indebted for 'the figures :-" Every ounce of this tea and sugar, every pound of this coffee and cocoa, was, therefore, by so much added to the material comforts of our population without in the smallest de gree affecting .injuriously any individual within these realms. It we'measure the increase of those comforts by the quantity added to the imporiaiiori, how. pleasurable is the contemplation. Every teapot in the kingdom had its extria spooniful last year, and the Sunday pudding of every poor family had its extra sweetening. ,.'A St. James's-square protectionist may think this as nothing, and may even ridicule it, but those who know the poor, and pay some attention to their wants and.the modes of satisfying them, feel thoroughly. the bless ings that free trade thus' brings home to every Briton's fireside. And now,, incon clusion, as to the most important article of allthlie prodiution which .GOD. has given to man for his food,.. and :without which he can0not sustain' life. The importation' of wheat ii 'in'. steaidy' pop'ortion to the in crease' o',f population, it havin' been 3,739,000 quarters in 1850, and 3',833,000 quarters.in' 1851.', The corn: imported last year cost 'the nationri about £"r1,500,000y paid for. in British manu'factured goods. The sarme quantity of corn,, if imported' before the repeal of the. food tax, would have cost nearly £20,000,;00', which must have been. paid in imoney,. for if we could have pro duced,' iit reasonable prices, manufactured articles lof that value, it is. doubtful' if foreigners could have found means to con sume an excess so far above the average. It was said, indeed,.by those who originally battled for protection, that foreigners never' would:take our goods, but would invariably demand' our money in return for corn. 'Yet whatni? tlie fact?,;The exports' of England never were so large, and the coffers of the, Bank 'never were 'so full, as. under the system of, free trade. Such are some 'of' the blessings free-trade has produced to, all of us...
