Sending the Money out of the Country. One of the catch-cries of the Protectionist party to unthinking people is, ' Let us have Protection and stop the money from going out of the country.'* In future the advocates of monopoly will be obliged to leave this delusion alone. The public have now the published returns from two Protected countries — the United States and Victoria. The American lrea sury returns show that with all her greatness as a manufacturing nation under Protection, she last year imported £100,000,000 worth more than she exported. This is, according to the Protectionists, a hundred million sterling was sent out of the country, coming nearer home, tho Victorian trade returns just issued show that for every £1 worth exported Victoria paid £2 away for imports. Here is a horrible Protectionist ghost badly broken up. Why should not the Protection Union in Sydney agitate to arouse their Protectionist colony to stop the money going out of the country. — Evening News.
