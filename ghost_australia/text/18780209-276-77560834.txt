LOST IN THE SIERRAS. SCENE I. How silent are the Sierras in their top most heights, where the grey peaks stand about in groups, holding up between them the little platter-like valleys ! We must go and stand on the border of one of these valleys. Now we feel the silence of the place resting upon us-are awed by the tall, frowning peaks. See! a gloomy mist in the west has risen up and reddened and almost hidden the after noon sun. "What! in this drear place a lone man and his horse. How tired are both ; how slowly drag their steps! Now they halt. The man, bewildered, lost, turns and looks about hiT ; the tired beast hangs its head and stands motionless, glad of a moment's rest. Before them, darkly frowning, is a grey-walled canyon. It is deep-how deep we cannot see, for in the bottom squats gloomy Dark. Unsmiling as the lost soul, she grimly sits hovering over her brood of terrors, as a hen spreads her wings over her young. The lost stand perplexed and irresolute. They know, and only know, that they are lost in. the high Sierras. Their knees betray their weariness and their fears. How great is the silence here ? No sound from the lower world can reach this height. The tall grey peaks stand about like voice less ghosts. Along the narrow flats and upon the steep, unsafe slopes, are grouped the white bones of lifeless grove3 of juniper and stunted pine-they are bleached as stag horns bleach on a plain, or the bones of dead soldiers on a battlefield. Did they die of the great silence?
