THE MYSTBRV OF AN OPAL RING. A NEW YEAR'S EVE GHOST STORY. JSjBgfiT WAS NEW YEAR'S EVE, and gilí j we were sitting round the smoking älSÄj roomfireatH--Hall, and when the hands of the clock showed us that ^Í-V' a brief half-hour was all that was left of the Old Year, ; there came a pause, every one preferring his own thoughts to conversa tion. . : Not everyone, though, for Charlie Selwyn sat for five minutes with a very depressed countenance, and then burst forth with : - \- '1 wish some bf you fellows would talk, .and not sit staring,into the fire like a set of corpses. If I put out the lights perhaps this wottld'nt be a bad time for a ghost talk,' arid .suiting the action to the words, he jumped up and extinguished all the candles, and then ¡ went on : 'I'm sure some of you are think ing about them now, especially Gordon, who .might have lived among .them all his life by the look of his face ; and, besides, he has on that horrid opal ring, which I hate, and which is glittering now as if it sheltered within it a devil or a ghost ' :?>/'-' Would you like to .hear, its . story ?' said 'Clifford Gordon, looking up with a faint smile; 'it includes a ghost, so perhaps it won't be too tame even for Charlie.' 'Let's light some brandy and make a green iight, said Selwyn, Tm sure it would add greatly to the effect.' ?? . f'.No, no, Selwyn,' put in Captain Russell, ' I think we can dispense with' the brandy, "and I'm sure Gordon's story will be ghastly , enough without that.' ? 'Well, then, begin" answered Charlie, and if you don't make everyone's flesh creep, I'll , tell you a ghost tale myself afterwards, and ¡.then. I shall insist on having the green light.' , - . ?? ' I daresay you know,' began Gordon, .'that I am a relation of« Sir Gordon," at least our fathers, were cousins, but he has always been much more like a brother to me.' 1 ' Never heard of it before,'put in Charlie. ' It has sent you up ever so much in my esti mation, now, to think that yon are third cousin and like a brother to a. Sir, and I should'nt mind . lending you five pounds any day ; that is to say if I'd got it.' . . 'Selwyn,'said Major Roberts, 'if you in terrupt any more, I shall be compelled to put you out of the room,-which had the effect of silencing Charlie, and Gordon . went jan- . . . ,.; . MI'; « GeorgeiGordon, has. always been exceed 'iHgly^kind to me, and up to this time I have always spent Christmas with him,, but that is all over now and he is living in England. v'.-iM.You don't mean to say you've quarreled with',him¿ .have you ?' said Selwyn: :'I'd' .never quarrel with my third cousin if he were ia. Sir, and if you have done such a foolish thing as that you will go down in -my estima tion directly.' ¿'..liThé Major held up a warning finger and Charlie let Gordon continue. Í . .1 'Last Ghristmas I visited "The Elms" for thc first time, my cousin'having always spent his Christmas up till then rft his city villa, andras this was his .first Christmas lhere,; he. . - nadean immense houseful, of guests; When I.arrived, his sister Clarice-for I forgot to . say that George is.a'bachelor- met me in the . halb and with an'-anxious''countenance told :me';that as all ¿the other rooms were full, I ''1,a'nÜ(a,.few others' would -have lo sleep in the ..iiofthi.wing.' ,' I'ut'as, there wilt be several.of 'j;youy»/l daresay yoWwill not. bc afraid,' she *'said;"and I assurëdyher-that"! had not the ' least objection tb-thé north wing, and that in I factlthat I preferred it--- which. sent her off to greet some lresh<arrivals looking a good deal eased.' 3 , ; ^ " An old map servant -showed me upstairs, and after traversing about a good many stair-, cases.and passages . we^arrived at "the north .wing, which was, as I knew before, nothing more nor less than the original building, and said to be very old.
