SUMMONING THEI DEAD. A strange custom, described by early Spanish and Portuguese explorers, still lingers ill the region of the head waters of the Amazon. It is the custom for certals sorcerers, who profess to foresee the fu ture by the aid of ghosts, to invoke the ghosts by swnllowing toxic herb decoctions. which throw them into a state of temporary madness. In this condition, the spirits of the departed come to guide them in their decisions by superhuman wisdom. Tribal feuds, silits at law,. the treatment of disease, migrations, the treatment of crops, and other questions, are submitted to thle spirits of departed sages, warriors, andi medicine men. It is a weird scene. By night. in the gloom of the deepest forest. the rltes begin. lighted by the fitful glare of open fires. Thie sorcerers drinkt the nanu seous steepings of thle poison plants, amid a silence broken only by the heat of the drum. The drlugs take immediate effer:t. Their eyes open wide and their pupils di late. They utter nnlntelliglble cries which are taken to be words of deepest meaning. Flnally, the sorcerers fall down in utter exhaustlon to sleep off the effects of their medicine.
