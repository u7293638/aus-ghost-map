SANDHURST MUNICIPALITY. (From the Bendigo Advertiser.) Considerable interest is excited by the ques- tion of establishing a municipality in Sand- hurst, now brought once more before the pub- lic, after having been condemned to oblivion for six months by the stormy public meeting in last June. The ghost thus exorciscd has been duly laid for the appointed time, and it now walks the earth again, to tho horror of a few of our residents with superstitious ten- dencies. It is to be presumed that during these six months the utmost pains have been taken by all parties to make themselves ac- quainted with the merits of the question. Delay was asked foi in oidei to dehbeintc lrI he gentlemen who opposed the establishment of a municipality only did so btcniibi they ?wcio not piepaicd foi its iiception-because the) wanted timo foi consideiatlon-not be (cause they w ci e absolutely opposed to mu ni icipahties in gcncinl 01 to n Sandhurst muni* cipnhty in pai ticului At all ev ents such was ¡then plea they wanted time-time to study the question to estimate the cost of local self government and whethei Mi Wolfes 'famous statistics vtcie coiroct oi not Well, .they have had six months to do so-six months ol incubation upon the question of a municipalitj and wo shall now see what will 'be brought loi th or whethei tho eggs mc all (addled AVe hopo that Mi A\ olfe hnnbolf has given the said statistics an overhauling and Ithnt be is piepaicd to discuss this gieat Ipublie question upon tho broadest giounds j We will do lum the justice to say that he showed hnnbolf as well acquainted with the subject na any one and wo behove that his objections to a municipalitj vvoiolj no means to the piinciple but to ceitain details in which the dlsti let seemed at a disadvan tige 'Ihcgicat majonty of its opponontb however weic stimulated to opposition by thebiceehes pocketconsideiation -ntnlltnnes astion0 one 1 hej hteially felt tho nnpoi tance of the question in then pockets and though abstnictcdly as fond of w eil lighted, well paved and well channel sticots as auy .one else pincticallj tluyvveie fonder of the pi esentwietched state of discomfoitm the 'township seeing that it wah assoontcd with an appaient s iv int. of monej We sit) appa tent loi in leabty any of oin stoiekeepois in Pall Mall will bl end as much foi the mipiovc ment of his piemisis chuing the cnsuin" twelve months without a municipalitj is Ivvithit without obtaining the snine adían ¡tn-,e Without making a bugbeni of the idea of a ¡fire in the township we should be wanting in lOiu dut) did wo not commend this Biibjcct to the attention of the citi/ens I he recent cntastiophe on another told field bungs home so foicibly to the mind the impoitance of this subject that theio is no necessit) foi any labored remniks lins fact howevei it would be well foi the holders of valuable piopeity in the ciowded poitionsof the town- ship to lemerabei that it is no ti3o plaoin" nllthiu dependence in the exoi dons of th?
