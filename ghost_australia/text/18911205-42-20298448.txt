The Philadelphian.â€  This interesting and eminently readable novel (pp.311) takes its title from one of its characters, who is a typical Yankee carrying on business in Philadelphia. It might have been almost as reasonably called the Shenandoan or the Welshman, or the Stepson, or the Colonel's Daughter, or the University Coach; for these individuals occupy nearly, if not quite, equal prominence in the story. But letting the title go, the book presents an admirable study of character, the plot is suffi ciently exciting without being morbidly sensa tional, and the villain, of the pieoe meets with his due reward. In some parts of the story we are reminded of Wilkie Collins, the Philadelphia!! and the general enemy plotting and counter- plotting as in that writer's novels, but we are spared the monotony of painful tension which Collins inflicts. For an author of some experience we confess to a little disappointment over the ghost scene. In these sceptioal days that is always a ticklish thing to manage, and there is next to no management at all. Besides, the ghost is made so impotent. Instead of appearing to warn the squire against impending but indescribable danger, why did.he not appear to the mur derer, and so afford effectual protection ? That would have been common-sense, but it would not have suited the story. I Maemillan's Colonial Library: "The Phila delphlan." By Louis John Jennings, M.P., author of "The Millionaire." Ac.
