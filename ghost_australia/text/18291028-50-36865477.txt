I'M NOT A LOVER NOW. A LIVERPOOL LYRIC. When I was in my little teens, When I was half a man, When I was always making love, But never made a plan— When I admired Anacreon Moore, And never rose till ten, I rhym'd to every eye I knew-- I was a--"lover" then. The Rhyming Dictionary then My Vade Mecum was, And women to my fancy were Aeriel as gas-- I could have kiss'd a satin shoe, Or challenged twenty men, Or turned crusader—for a look— I was a—"lover" then. I used to wear Macassar Oil, And murderous tight shoes, And hunt for tender epithets In tender hours to use; I bought a razor and began To shave when I was ten, And mounted gills and quizzing glass,— I was a—"lover" then. But I am changed—my pocket book My Vade Mecum is, And woman weighs so many pounds, And Cupid's but a quiz; I never stand up to be shot, I seldom make a bow, "A look" is not worth looking for— I'm not a--"lover" now. My life in short, is perfect prose, I tie cravats behind, I wear a pair of overshoes, And keep a quiet mind— I know a gravestone from a ghost, A woman from a cow I go to bed at ten o'clock— I'm not a—"lover" now. Ambergris (the Examiner says) is an intestinal concretion in some species of the whale; it is picked up in masses upon the sea, and valued on account of odour, and for the property it has of increasing the power of other odours, which it certainly does. It is probably a biliary concretion of the whale, and is sometimes found in large quantities in the intestines of that animal. It is found to contain forty or fifty per cent. of a pecu- liar fatty matter.
