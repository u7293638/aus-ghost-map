spiritua li stic ma teriali- sation. the conjuror's spook produc tions. SYDNEY. Wednesday. Mr. Hoiking, the expoaer of apiritualistia materialisation, gave his third exhibition before a crowded audienco at the Opera House this evening. On Monday he leaveu Sydney for Melbourne, under engagement to Messrs, Williamson and Musgrove, at tbe Princess's Theatre. On Wednesday and Thursday ovenings of ' next week, after tbe ciosn of the prcsont opera season, Messrs. Williamson and Musgrove have arranged with Mr. Ernest Hosking 1 to give two spiritualistic seances at - tho Princess's Theatre, when ho will endoavor to "materialise" the spirits of "Josephine," "Geordie" and "Cissy," re nowned in connection with Mrs. Mellor's mediumiatic materialisations. Sydney U still seething with controversy as to tho "test" i conditions under which Mrs. Mellon produced Iter spiritualistic eifoot, and as to how Mr. Hoiking manages to eclipse Iter under conditions which are certainly not in favor of deception. How ever, Mr. Hosking lays no claim to medinmistic powers, and his exhibitions are simply those of a clever illusionist conjurer, who has made a specialty of tlio cabinet and spook production business. The Melbourne publio probably will be pleased at being afforded an opportunity of seeing for themselves what can bo done io these days of depression and deception in tho way of making the ghost walk.
