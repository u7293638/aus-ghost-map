SPECIAL EDITION. LATE CABLES. . ? « ? (From the Evening News Correspondents.) Amy Kobsart's Ghost. SAUE OF CUMNOR PLA.CE. THE PURCHASER DISCONTENTED. ALLEGED UNHISTORIC CLAIMS. London, April 17. — Mr. Hall, a gentle man who purchased Cnmnor Place from the Earl of Abingdon, believing it to be the Cumnor Place celebrated for the murder of Amy Robsart, and reported to be haunted by her ghost, is now suing for a rescinding of the purchase, owing to the unhistoric nature of the Place's claim to be considered the scene of the occurrence. ?[Cumnor, about three miles west of Oxford, has an old manor house, formerly belonging to the Abbots, of Abingdon, and after the Eefonnation granted, to Anthony Forster, believed to be one of the murderers of Amy or Anne, first -wife of Lord Robert Dudley, afterwards Earl of Leicester. This lady is known to lovers of romance as Amy Robsart, and her story is best told by Sir Walter Scott in 'Keniiworth.' The general theoryis that Leicester, .as he is best known, being of belief that if single again he would be able to espouse Queen Elisabeth, get Anthony Forster and Sir Bichard Varney to put her out of the way. They got her to Cumnor Place and she never left it -alive, being found at the foot of the stairs with her neck broken. It has, of course, been part of the story that her ghost walks at certain times, and this it appears added a charm to the many others possessed by a building purchased by Mr. Hall as the genuine old manor house, but the claims of which to be so considered he is now more than doubtful about.
