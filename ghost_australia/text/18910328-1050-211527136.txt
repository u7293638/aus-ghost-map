SOLEMN ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL CHORISTERS AT ST. MARY'S, SOUTHAMPTON. Canon Wilberforce, son of the late Bishop of Oxford, preached as follows in December last: " They ought to maintain the musical beauty of their service at its highest pitch, and especially at the loftiest and most symholic act of Christian Worship, the celebration of the Holy Eucharist. Architec- ture, someone said, was petrified music. If so, music, the queen of sciences, was archi- tecture etberealized and winged. . . Two members of the first choir were present. He desired to claim their intercession on behalf of their choir— organist, men, and boys — that they might never forget the importance of their Ministry ; that they might be pure and devout and prayerful, as became men who anticipated on earth the occupation of the shining hosts of God by being the mouthpiece of the Church's wor- ship.'' After Evensong the Rector proceeded to the Table, and the candidates were brought before him. There was a short form of service, inolnding the latter part of the Litany, whilst "Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire," was sung kneeling. A few simple questions was then pat to the candi- dates by the Rector, who afterwards formally admitted them into the choir, and, assisted by the Rev. H. J. Trueman, vested them with the surplice, while the 150th Psalm was being chanted. They then received the Blessing after which the Te Deum was sung. Subsequently some members of the choir sang solos. We may one day expect an imposing function on similar lines when a chorister dies. This lauding of the choir is very undesirable.
