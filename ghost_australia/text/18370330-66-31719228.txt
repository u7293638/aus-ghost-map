THE FATE OF THE OAK. BY BARRY CORNWALL. Tʜᴇ Owl to her mate is calling; The River his hoarse song sings; But the Oak is mark’d for falling, That has stood for a hundred springs. Hark! a blow—and a dull sound follows; A second,—he bows his head; A third,—and the wood’s dark hollows Now know that their king is dead. His arms from their trunks are riven, His body all bark’d and squared; And he’s now, like a felon, driven, In chains to the strong dock yard, He’s sawn through the middle and turn’d For the ribs of a frigate free; And he’s caulk’d, and pitch’d, and burn’d, And now—he’s ﬁt for the sea. Oh! 𝑛𝑜𝑤, with his wings out spread, Like a ghost (if a ghost may be), He will triumph again, though dead And be dreaded in every sea. The lightning will blaze about, And wrap him in ﬂaming pride; And the thunder‐loud cannon will shout In the ﬁght, from his bold broad side. And when he has fought—and won, And been honour’d from shore to shore, And his journey on earth is done, Why, what can he ask for more? There is nought that a king can claim, Or a poet, or warrior bold, Save a rhyme, and a short‐lived name, And to mix with the common mould.
