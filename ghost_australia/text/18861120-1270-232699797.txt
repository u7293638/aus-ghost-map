THOMAS CARLYLE. A contemporary in a recent issue says that Carlyle .is like FalstaSE, with a difference. . He was not only quarrelsome himself when livings but since his death he has been the cause of much quarrelsomeness in others. His biographer is, of course, not entirely irresponsible for this. The sacrifice he made to "friendship" over that Timon's tomb was little likely to satisfy the world, any more than likely tc appease the moody ghost of Timon. At any rate, there are obviously a great many people who think Carlyle's life has yet to be ^written, and have proposed to themselves to write it. The most recent of this good-natured folk is Mr. Andrew James Symington, who had produced some " Personal Reminiscences of Carlyle". (Gardner). As these reminiscences were at first hand indited for an American newspaper, it will be understood that they form no' supremely important contribution on the subject. Mr. Symington holds Mrs. Carlyle to have been really responsible for those unlovely freaks of her hufband's temper which seem unfortunately likely to form the most substantial memories posterity will have of him, at any rate for many a generation to come. He also holds that Carlyle was a thorough and constant believer, in the Bible, despite all appearances to the contraryâ€”and they are cerfcainly,many. The pook is well-meaning and harmless, but not at all neeessaiy. Mr. Symington's reasons for writing appear to have been that he had read Mr. Froude's volumes " with mingled feelings of agreement atid difference." It would be interesting to feel the head of the man who had not so read those volumes. But if that is to be accepted as a reason for writing thereon, not all the type in all the printing establishments in the world will suffice for what is to come.
