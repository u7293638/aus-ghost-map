A STINGY GHOST. Dr. Boyd(" A.K.H.B.") tells us in his Re tmniscenoss that at Glamis Oastle, the seat of the Earl of Sfcrathmore, there is a haunted room. Some years ago an excellent dignitary, who was always oollooting moneyfor Church build ing', had jnst gone to bed, when on a sudden the ghost appeared- apparently a Strathmore of some centuries back. With great presence of mind the clergyman took the first word. Addressing the ghost he said he was moBt anxious to raise money for a Church he was ereoting; that he bad a bad oold and could not well get out of bed; but that his oolleofcing-book was on his dressing table, and he would be extremely obliged if hiB -visitor would give him a subscription. Upon thiB the ('host voashed, and haB never come back rinoe.
