Taking the Poll. It wa3 eirlj d»wu oa the -th of November when I rolled »p my dormitorial swag on the mud floor of tho humpy that was to do duty as balloting booth dunug that eventful day, on which the fortuuea of two out of half adoben aspirants to legiahtne honors were to bo decided The polling place, which by the patronage of my old Behool chum, the returning officer for Bul luncowa, had fallen to my charge, with a two guinea fee in prospect, besides other pickings, waa really a charming spot 1 o reach it an arm of the aei had to be crosaed, and the atormy weather of the previoU8 eveuiug, followed by a rather leugthy tramp under the guidauce of a blackfellow, had so wearied me that on arrival I had hardly unstrapped my blankets and lain down, regardless of snakes and cockroaches, on mother earth before I waa fast asleep Iho aspect of the scene next morning came to me, therefore, with all the novelty of a surprise In front, at a couple of hundred yards distince, Bpreid the waters of the Pacific, gleaming with that inde finable opalescence winch inveat8 the surface of the calmly slumbering deep in the still soft hour that precedes the too rapid sunrise of an Auatra Inn summer morning Ihe tide was running out, and aa its recediug waveleta creamed along the white sands thoy disclosed, little by little, the amuous outlet of the tiny creek, on whose bank my rude Bleeping place of the past night stood, whimpering along over ita pebbly bed, more than half hidden by tree ferns and myrtles, ita low converse miugled pleasantly with the soughing of the morning breeze in the gaunt gum tree tops, with the orisons of the awakening cicad», and the subdued trumpeting of the in- quisitive magpie na he eyed my outdoor prepara- tion foi a hasty breakfast with a curious eye The hut that is to witness the solemn and de- liberate choice of the free and independent of the district has done duty in its time as a native police station. Time has dealt gently with its slab walls and rugged roof, and, although the doors and windows have long since rotted off their raw hide ties, the interior still posseaaes every convenience for complying with the re- quirements of "the Act". There are two apart ments—an outer one, still boasting the rudely rigged bushman's bunk that serves me for an office table ; and an inner, where, at a triangular shelf behind the partition, the voter can select his men and obliterate hw political adversaries in perfect concealment. Breakfast over, and the fragments consigned to my swarthy guide, I re enter the hut ind prepare for the duties of the day An impromptu whiBk of toa tree, deftly wielded by that royal personage (his name w ia King Jimmy) sends the duBs of half a gene- ration flying, aud cauaea fearful havoc among tarantulas, centipedes, and other live occupants ol the polling booth, who have yet a long course of evolution to undergo before they become fat for the franchiae A blue blanket, spread on tho uneven boards of the sleeping bunk-I always, on principle, avoid using one of these snake traps for ita legitimate purpose, especially in i long uninhabited hut-gives that piece of furniture quite a business and office like appearance , md when the bran new ballot box, still clammy with varnish, ib displayed thereon, and my pipers, pens, inkstand, and other paraphernalia are all neatly laid out, I begin to realise with îutenso satiBfuction the immense importance of the func- tions of a presiding officer as high priest of the free and glorious b lllot, which for one day only gives all true born Queenslander a voice in the administration of their magnificent country Half past 8 o clock one short half hour and my íeaponsibihties will begin Those reaponsi bihtiea include the maintenance of order during the polling, and the arrest of any peraon attempt ing to disturb the proceedings bo say the " In- structions to Returning officers, &c;, which I have lead over so often during the laet day or two that it would be a relief to feel oneaelf a composer, so as to be able to set thom to muaic Waa it altogether prudent, without aecunng police assistance, to undeitake functioua so onerous m this wild place' lia and thit, foi all it aeema so pe iceful and solitary, the popula tion round about, mostly lumberers, are a rough and ready lot, much given to the secreting of kegs of undutied rum cast up by the waves, and as little likely to reaped the halo that eneirclos a preBiding officer as thoy would to leave untapped any items of spirituous jetaam that fell in then way I picture to myaolf with some trepidation the possibility of having to arrest, Bingle handed, in virtue of my office, four or five of these giants, with limbs steeled by constant familt inty with maul and wedges, and am soon lo3t in contem plation of the meana for diapoaing of my pu soners-when caught However, there ia no help for it Mattera have proceeded too far to recede now , besidea, there remains the chance of one or more scrutineers arriving who would help to keep me in countenance Niue o clock , time to open the poll In de fault of any other witneBS I summon King Jimmy, and in bia presence formally unlock the ballot box, and turning it upside down, «. la Robert Houdin, to bIiow that ' there ia no de ception, relock it, and eliding the key into the innermost penetralia of my pantaloons, with in attitude implying that only death shall wrest it from me, replace the fatal caaket in position Now coiFe one, come all, they will find me equal to either fortune 1 ive, ten, twenty minutes paBS , but n iry voter Theae timber getting gentry are doubt lesstnikiug holiday and on Buch occiaions bed and bi e ikf tot have Circe an cb iruis for the lurd handed toiler Ridiculous to expect i eoul before 10 o clock Still I feel a vague BcuBation of reat leasucBB and discontent o\ erpower me " Come in, King Jimmy, and be sworn m aa a bpeciul constable , there b no peace to keep, uufortu nately, or rather there s more than I can aw ly with, but any pretext will serve for the Bight of a human face Alas . the poor devil has slunk away out of sight That ceremonial manipula tion of the ballot box-too suggestive of au infern ii machine-haa perturbed hie Bpint, and he deems it prudent to keep a e ife interval be- tween himself md the uncanny thing Would that the d ly a work were done, never thelesa Thia solitary confinement ia getting confoundedly alow, aud I d give all the seraphic visions that fancy ever called up for a long drink of cool shandygaffand one of Ouida « novels Ha . the very thought excites thirst In the haunts of men it ia 12 o clock not the ghost of u human being, much Isbs a voter li ia ahown up yet If ehandyg iff ib unattunable, the babbhug streamlet telle of cool water cloi,e by, and there is a flask in my valise that will aerve to " medí cate the animalculo What a noble pretext, by the way, are Bald annnalculai !

Idle Quill. A correspondent asked recently for infor- mation regarding the prize farina of England We presume the farms and system of farming for which theprizeaof the Royal Agricultural Society are awarded are referred to. In looking up the records of that institution it is curious to note that the prize winnora for three years past are ladies I The competition is divided into eight classes-1, Arable farms of over 150 acres ; 2. Farms of from 80 to 150 acres ; 3. From 40 to aerea ; 4. Dairy and grazing farms over 200 acres ; 5. Same from 100 to 200 acres ; 6. Same from 50 to 100 aerea ; the 7th and 8thclasaca are confined to the Isle of Man. Well, Mra. Ellen Birch, of Aintree farm (242 aerea all arable), near Liverpool, won the first prize at the last com- petition of the Royal Society ! Mrs. Birch is a model farmer, bcyoud doubt. The soil, aa stated, ia all arable ; it is sandy, light, and dry. The land ia level and divided into fields of 30 acres each, surrounded by live hedges, that the report Bays are neatly kept The farm ia worked for the supply of the markots of Liverpool, with the following rotation :-1. Potatoea ; 2. wheat ; 3. barley or oats, sown with grass ; 1. hay ; 5. hay again ; after which the land ia broken up for the firat rotation. Only a few cattlo are kept but aheep are graaed, and there is abundance of manure available by meana of a canal from Liver- pool. Fifteen mon and boya make up the work- ing force, at wages averaging 17a. per week mid cottage. The rent paid for the farm ¡b £5 per acre per annum. The report of the judgea re- garding the condition of the crops on Aintree farm almoat make one wish ho could go there and Bee. The potatoeB aro described as " simply splendid," the oats and barley aa extra fine, and the hay very heavy. The farm has been worked by thu same family for over 30 yeara, the whole of the management being now canied. on, by' Mrs. Birch and her two young sons.
