SPOKIWG. TURF TOMUS. [l>Y MEKTOK.] The Spring Racing Carnival under the auspices of the V.R.C. was brought to a most successful con all l'our days. The arrangements were carried out on the same perfect system for which Mr. H. Byron Moore has become so famous. The meeting will long be remembered if for nothing else but Carbine's sensational win in the Cup. The way the old chap came away from his field as they swept into the straightwas a treat to witness, and one never to be iorgotten by those who had the pleasure OJ: being present on that memorable day. There are surroundings connected with Car bine's win which I don't, think we will ever see again. Carbine carried the biggest weight ever carried to the front, beat the biggest field that ever started for the race, and ran the distance in the quickest time on record, wearing bar shoes, in the phenomenal time of smin. 28isec., and. curious enough he was the first horse on the card, and the firstbacked for the race. He kept firstfavourite right through, and he wasfirst out in the straight to do Jnsi preliminary,... and, .. as everybody know s, lie wa first pa t the po t; IP.lact, everything connected with the lioise-ana race "iva " fir t cla " When you come to consider tlie" lunmngof tho e w ofini hedbelimd him 311 the Cup it 011I3 make Car - bine out a greater wonder.

He has started eleven times 111 Sydney, won ten times, ran second the other, and his wins included two Sydney Gold Cups. You mark what I say 'right here,' that the horse that beats Carbine in the Melbourne Cup will win it. There are no 'flies on him.' He gets there ' with both feet' all the time. I think everyone will admit he has proved himself a lolb. better horse than Malua, and that is all he is asked to carry more than he won the Cup with. He is now the same age as Malua was when he scored his brilliant victory, and I fully expect him to repeat Malua's performance, because a good horse ls always at its best as a three : and five year old, and I say now we have never seen this horse at his best ' ' . ' " -— v„" ^ t tllink lie will go through his live year old engagements unbeaten, as Abercorn did, and I feel certain he will nqn thr • leel .Jl ne AMU wm tbe three evens he will | start tor m Sydney, after which I expect to see him win the Caulfield stakes, Melbourne Stakes, and crown all his previous victories by winning the biggest handicap ever run for in best of good luck go with him." While giving a word of praise to Carbine,, f in ust not forget that sterling bit of horseflesh (if he is only a galloway he is a good one) and that is Crown Jewel, his two wins at Flemmgton being of greatmerit. He beat Megaphone in the Coburg Stakes, and followed it up by winning the Spring Handicap on Oaks Day, beating Don Giovan, who has since won the Williamstown Cup, and cut out the distance in 2imn. Sj-sec., which is rattling good time considering his inches. ° Corythus is another who has put up a record for a mile and a half at Flemmgton, he having run it in 2111111\. 36sec. No wonder lie can wm hurdle races with i 3st. up. lie must be as fast as a ghost. A curious coincidence in connection with, the winners of the different races at "Flemington. durnig- tlie-fout days. There was The Serf, The Admiral, The Baron, and The Spot, all won laces at the meeting, and -he majority of races were .won by horses having a double name, such a Crown Jewel, Sir Wilfred, Lord Hopetoun, &c.; Megaphone began to get back to lu old foini during tlie la ttwo da} s of the meeting, and from what I can see of him I donttluuk D S Wallace will regret lii purcha e, in fact- I don't think a Melbourne Cup is^ quite out of in reach, o watch and : wait" ye punters.
