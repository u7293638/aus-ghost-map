Towards Pekin. The war in the East still goes on, as we are apprised through the restoration of the cable service. There has been another fight, and, as usual, another defeat for the Chinese. The Chinese ? officials in Pelrin are, however, said to be regaining confidence, owing to the sufferings of the Japanese in Manchuria. Besides there is a report— a somewhat vague one, so far— of the Chinese having repulsed their enemies in a still later en counter. It has been predicted all along that the Japanese operations in Man churia would be seriously interfered with by the setting in of the winter, and that an advance en. Felon in euch a season. would be exceedingly difficult for the invaders, however creditably they may have hitherto figured as scientific soldiers. The prediction is one of the few in favor of the Chinese which seem to have been even partially ful filled. The cold winter in that region is described as intense, and the Japanese are very susceptibe to cold. But if they actually should manage to get over the intervening ground and* make a dash at Pekin, it is not at all improbable that the defenders of it would experience a sudden collapse of theirnewly restored confidence. That mere ghost of a chance, which is all that experts will admit the Chinese now to have of escaping utter humiliation, will vanish if Pektn should fall.
