I THE CONFESSION OF FAITH. I I 10 THE 1ÎDIT0B OF THE ABaffl, bir,-Now that yon have given tho laymen of the Preabyterlan Church in this colony an opportunity of knowing what tho West mmater Confession ia they will |bo able tj judge of the value of a]document to the adhesion to the articles of which some of the mimatera of the Melbourne Presbytery attacti more importance than to tho cultivation of practical religion-I Bay to the cultivation of Eradical religion for though it could not o denied that the minister of tho Scots Churcli had since bia arrival in the colony gathered round him a very largo con gregation of all classes of people, had acknowledged the obligations his toach ing of practical Christianity had laid on them by a cheerful and liberal sup port of every good and charitable object which carno under their notice , who had de voted a great deal of his time to guiding and fostering the moral and religious energies of the young members of hia llock, and that in such a way that his teaching and presence are a delight to them, their faces brightening at the sound of his name and that he has got up a powerful organisation for reclaiming thoBe outcasts of society the (¡utter children and, through them their families also not one particle of credit was given to Ina un wearied efforts to make those who are committed to his spiritual charge better men, women, and children, during the debate on his conduct in the Mel bourne Presbytery No, ho was supposed to disbelieve in some of the dogmas of the Westminster Confession, and all the good he bas done was butas a grain of dust in the balance, when weighed against that intolerable offence By your well timed pub lication of the Confession, you have enabled all the inhabitants of this colony to judge how far that mfallable document represents the religion of Jesus Christ, in what amiable lights it exhibits to us the love of God the Tather And yet to uphold this burlesque on the teaching of the lowly and loving Je3us, the moBt eloquent and successful preacher in the Presbyterian Church m this colony, the most devoted and energetic promoter of every thing which conduces to the moral and physical limprovemcnt of the human race, is to be driven from hia post, and branded aa a heretic, and the moat intelligent congregation in Melbourno scattered to the winds and their efforts to do good paralysed for ever And ia thia what PreBbytenanism has come to' The stern strong men who wrested Scotland from tho yoke of Rome, nnd in after time3 from the tyranny of Charles and Laud, who were ready to shed their blood for the precious boon of a freedom to worship God in their own min ner, what would they Bay to their degenerate descendants becoming tyrants in their turn, and excluding from the Ministry all who did not subscribe the strictest adherence to a creed, some of the formulas of which aro abhorrent to humanity ? These foun dera of the Presbyterian Church directed their energies to the free worship of God, to the education of the congre gâtions and fostering true religion in them, to the earnest study of the Scriptures at the fountainhead itself, by no moana to auch an infallible interpretation of it as the West minster Confession bas attempted to bind men Assemblies in those days were not to set np as an idol the formal dogmas of sinful men like themselves, adhesion to which waa necessary to salvation, and the breach of which insured exclusion from the church here and damnation hereafter The second book of diBcipline, the first standard drawn up by the church, required no subscription to its articles, and matead of binding men down to the Btrict observances of antiquated for mulas, they foresaw the neceaaary progress of thought m church mattera, as ia clearly shown in the 8th article of the 7th chapter where it is atated with regard to assemblies " They have power also to abrogate and abolish all statutes and ordinancea concern mg ecclesiastical matters that are found noysome and unprofitable, and agree not with the time or are abusit by the people The Presbyterian Church in this colony does not, as it ought to do, consist of the whole of the people, but ia virtually subject to the clergy only, the assemblies, which are com posed mainly of ministers, ruling the church with an iron rule which excludea all free dom of thought and speech in any individual minister or office bearer The office bearera of the church are obliged to subscribe to all the standards, and but few men, with auy con science, can swallow the terrible dogmas of the Confession of Faith The consequence is that the laity are virtually excluded from taking any part m the government of the church The Scots Church congregation the largest in the colony, ia almost without an oidor Is this state of things to be allowed to continue' It ia quite plain that no change for the better ia to be expected from the Presbytery of Mel bourne It is driving the minister of the Scots Church from the colony, and depriving the congregation of the services of a man who ia in entire accord with it More over, when he goes, tho congregation will not be at liberty to choose aa his auccessor anyone whose thoughts and views are not bound down by the Confession of Faith Thero is nothing left for the congregation but tj " gape and swallow whoever the Melbourne Presbytery will licence for it There is but one remedy for all this, and that is for the Presbyterian laity to arouse from their apathy form themselves into organised bodies throughout the colony and claim from the General Assembly that toleration in thought and speech which ia the right of every Chria turn freeman Since this letter waa com menced, I perceive by The Argus that Mr Stewart, the able exponent of the views of the Scots Church congregation, has got notice that he is to be brought before the Melbourno Presbytery for misrepresenting the teachings of the church, and imputing dishonesty to its ministers , and Mr Strong is also to appear before this Star Chamber for listening to these accusations, and not protesting against them The high handed proceedings of theao lorda over God a heritage aro culminating to a point and it ia high time some action waa taken by thoae who have any regard for freedom of thought and speech, and who are not in clined to lay down their necks under tina car of Juggernaut The recent discussion m your columns shows there is no lack of free Presbyterians in the colony, who only want union to make their power felt in the preaent crisis Therefore, by way of a beginning, I hereby invite such men to com mumcate with me for the purpoae of forming auch a union, the object of which shall be to promote tho toleration of free thought and free speech in the Presbyterian Church of this colony.-I am, &c;, Hawthorn, Aug. 29. W. M'CREA. TO THE EDITOB. OF TUB ARGUS Sir,-The thank8 of a whole community, and especially of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, are due to you for having published in your widely circulated paper the West minster Confession of Faith, thus giving to many who may have never read it an oppor tunity of judging of its close adherence to the teaching of the Holy Scriptures Much, however, is lost in tho omission of the proofs attached to each clause, on which alone the duitrmes of the Confession are grounded, and, therefore, inseparable from, in authority Allow me to quote the proofs annexed to section 3, chap x, "On elect infants dying in infancy -Luke xvm 15,16 - " And tbc} brought unto Him also infants (bal)OB) that lio ttould touch thom, but whoa His disciplos Baw it thoy rebuked thom Out Jesus cillod thcui unto Him and Bald, ' Sutler littlo children to com3 unto D10 and forbid thom not, for of such la tho king dom ol God ' The next proof we find in Acts 11 38, 39 - ' Thcu said Peter unto thora, 'Repont and ho baptised ever} onoof you lu tho namo of Jesus Christ for the remission of Bins and } c shall recclvo the II A¡ Ghost lor Hie promlso is unto you and your chil dren and to all that are afar off, etea as many as tho Lord our God shall call Now, Sir, the Scripture just quoted not enly substantiates Mr MLachruus state mont that the PreBbj terian Church believes n infant eahition, but that tho Confession of Taith distinctly teaches the same "Ot auch' (of children dying m nifincj) 13 the kingdom of heaven And, concerning the creation of tho world in tho space of SK days you will please to notice that the Confession f Faith refers ua to " the wholo of the first chapter of Genesis ' Ii Ù-'""rHat consent tho church recoivßä I OB truo"the wide intern:?1^10"3 ot Su engthened periods ages in exteu , öjr What | authority can wo impufe to the compilers of | the Confession of JTaith, who have but foi 1 lowed the diction of Scripture, the literal acceptation of a day embracing the space of 21 houtB'-I am, i-c , Aug. 20. TO THE EDITOR OP THE AltQUS Sir-1 he Scots Church controversy is dis tinctly pregnant with issues of great interest to a circle wider far than the Presbyterian Church of Victoria I venture to think, how ever, that the controversialists aro wildly Btra}ing from the main point, and heating themselves in useless skirmishes upon auch outworks os " the days of the creation, and " the doctrine of predestination That to insist upon the uniform pronuncia tion of certain shibboloths, and absolute agreement in non essentials, would secure only " the dead unity of the churchyard rather than the living unity of the church, will be conceded by most thoughtful mea But it the acceptance or rejection of a belief in the atoning life, death, and resurrection of Christ is asserted to be of no moment-and this is the question really at issue in the Scots Church-then it may well be asked what article of creed is essential' Norman Maclood will not ba gonerally dubbed "narrow minded, and therefore I offer no apology for quoting these words of his that just recur to one a memory - "I have been astounded by a most Influential member of tho church saying to me ' What is it to me whether Christ worked miracles or rose from tho dead? we have got the right idea of God through Him it is enough, that can never perish ' Good Lord, do liter me from such conclusions If the battle has come, let It, but before God I will fight It with those only, be they few or many, who believe in a risen living Saviour This revelation of tho influence of surface criticism has thrown me back immensely upon all who hold fast by an objective revelation Nothing can possibly move me from Jesus Christ, the Living Saviour, tho Divine Saviour, tho Atoning Saviour, whatever be tho philosophy of that atonement ' " Nineteenth century culture," " advanced thought and other fascinating terms are dangled before men, and they are told that all catechisms and Confessions of Faith are effete, and should be cast aside by a world that has now learnt its letters and is free But that theso " advanced thoughts "-ex- pressed though they be in the polished lines of rhetoricians, or bathed m the glamour of German scepticism-are at least 10 centuries old, and that they were mot and answered by the Fathers of the Christian Chnrch in her infancy is known by none better than by Borne who yet herald their re appearance as of a fresh revelation from the eternal, through the media of " the glories of the 19th century."-Yours, _c , HABITANS IN RURE.
