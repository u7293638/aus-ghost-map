THE EASTER MANOEUVRES. i THE MILITIA AT LANGWARRIN. MARCHING OUT. . . Bl OUR SPECIAL REPORTER.) r "It was too good to Inst" 'The words formed a sort of countersign at Langwarrin on TSfeflduy night. The persistent, Bopping -gin was a dismal contrast to the bright days and crisp, clear nights. But it is better to have been going out of camp than coming into it in the one case mud and discomfort ore carried right through the week, in the other they cause with the end of the railway ride, save only in the case of the Mounted Rifles With many of the brown coated riflemen a SO miles' ride through a dripping, Bonglung bush is a some what dismal prospect. And the mounted riflemen have quite enough to discourage them without the rain intervening, Every man who comes to camp is under a personal mons lary loss, for free carriage of a kind-to Langwarrin, free rations, and a Government tent to live in by no means cover the cost to the individual of the Easter camp Every year's experience at Langwarrin makes it more certain that the Mounted Rifles will, before very long, be placed on a militia, establishment But the grievance of the Mounted Rifles yesterday was not a matter of pay but a matter of trains The alternative to marching to Mordialloc and taking tram there, was to wait at Langwarrin until 6 o clock yesterday evening, 'The alternative was not a particular > pleasant one Without raising any question of town v country, the latter should always be conceded first place in entrainments and metropolitans are sufficiently fair minded to admit the fairness of the contention More especially is this necessary when as in the case of the Mounted Rifles each man has a horse to look after Even as it is no complete arrangements had been made for the return of the regiment, A great many men were required to remain for the night at a wayside station, unless the Defence department choose to pay the Railway department for the special trains provided In effect, of course, it meant taking Government money out of the left pocket and putting it into the right, but all the same the specials were not forthcoming So damp and dispirited, the riflemen-black riflemen now in their long greatcoats marched away through rain and mud on their route to Mordialloc A couple of years ago, the military authorities hit upon an ingenious scheme for improving the railway transport arrangements this was the formation of a railway transport corps of which Mr Speight should be Lieutenant Colonel but the chief of the Railway Commissioners was a bit too clever to be caught in this attractive trap. 'The nor argument would have made him an officer of the defence forces under military discipline Ulio major general would have been able to command and not to supplicate And indures m transport would have been followed hyde mania for official explanations Mr Speight would appear to have noted this point and decided to remain a civilian There was really no striking camp vented this In fine weather a bugle call would have been given from headquarters, and instantly the tents would have sunk down as if the earth had swallowed them Anyone seeing it say, from Observatory Peak would have deemed himself the victim of some strange illusion But striking wet tents IS as unpleasant and difficult a task, comparatively, as taking a reef in a halt frozen Bail when a vessel is cutting through the billows off Cape Horn It was decided that the rents should remain where they were until thoroughly dry and then be struck and packed away by fatigue parties of the Permanent Forces Yesterday afternoon, there fore. Langwarrin appeared only the ghost of a military camp the appearance without the substance Of course, with troops on active service, the tests would have been struck and packed, rain or no rain It is a question not of inability but of inexpediency 'The rain cannot dump the spirits, though it may the great coats of soldiers on the eve of breaking camp Round the camp fires there was the customary merry groups on Tuesday evening, for the last night in camp is always a time of jollity All the leading officer of the force were guests for the of v ing of the Second Hat tallon these (ALL things have a good effect Socially) they help to smooth over differences which chum lights have created Amongst the stories told at mess was that of the regimental dog An officer of one of the scores in camp-winch particular corps does not much matter-on going to his tent at lunch time found a vagrant dog comfortably coiled on his blankets. He kicked the air registered one out promptly, but he came back at intervals during the day, to be kicked and re kicked and treated with opprobrious epithets Next the too affectionate dog was taken outside the camp lines and lost. But nothing would dishearten him in the morning he was sharing the officer's bed " Prussic acid was the sentence this time, and for the first time the over persistent animal was invited to take something He took it, and was buried But some one who appreciated the animal s devotion determined to see the matter further When the officer returned from drill at midday there was a black edged box in front of his door, and inside at the same old dog, with the solemn inscription, "Back from the Grave, pathetically pinned upon its chest. The last stage of the story was an ordinary meat pie. left careless!] upon the officers table. It said nothing, but implied much
