The very floor Of one tomb, we read, was thick with gold dust-the heavy Sliding fallen from some perished knightly vestment In. another was a downfall of golden leaves and flowers and amid this profusion of thin fine fragments, rings, bracelets, smaller crowns, as if for children, dainty butterflies, for ornaments of dresses, and that golden flower on a silver Balkwill of pure soft gold, unhardened by alloy, the delicate films of which one must touch but lightly, yet twisted and beaten by hammer and hand into wavy, spiral relief ' In an article on Irish needs and Irish remedies, Mr H M Hyndman asserts that if an Irish Parliament could be summoned without occasioning a rupture of the Union, and if it would really benefit Ireland, without injuring Imperial interests, Englishmen would cheer- fully assent to it, but he holds that it is impracticable, and could have no other result than that of bringing about a deadlock of the most anarchical description At the same time he is of opinion that, in order " to ensure that Ireland shall be, in future, a source of strength rather than weakness and annoyance, she will have to be governed more in accordance with the views of the majority of her population, and lead on the lines of any preconceived policy, however apparently sound ' Every reader of the Letters of Pliny the Younger will find his recollection? of them agreeably refreshed by the paper in which Mr H P Pelham has related the principal incidents in the life of this admirable speed men of the squirearchy of ancient Italy. Mr S C Buxton offers some practical suggestions for the reduction of those heavy election expenses, which he says, are tending more and more towards a plutocratic and " Theocratic ' representation of the people of the United Kingdom in the House of Commons But a reform of this kind appeals very improbable Mr Simcox's review of Mr Hutha " Life and Writings of Henry Thomas Buckle ' will give the general reader a very fair idea of the book itself, as well as of its subject Mr Charles Dawson advocated a wide extension of the franchise in Ireland as a condition precedent to the Legislative redress of the grievances, and Mr Frederic Harrison expounds the religion and morality of Positivism in a vaguely eloquent address delivered at the Positivist Commemoration of New Years Day Sentence Months' 8 the title of a magazine devoted to the interests of all pastimes by field and water, and issued from the establishment of the well known news agents in Union square, New York, the Galignani s Library of that city Considerable attention is devoted in it to yachting and ice yachting, and the speed attained by vessels which skim the surface of frozen rivers, is almost incredible As many as nine miles have been run in eight minutes and it has been found that with a strong wind, and with the ice in good condition, an ice yacht can distance an ordinary railway iron On the 19th of January 1871, the Zephyr and Icicle, both Poughkeepsie ice yachts, raced for two miles with the Chicago Express, the fastest train of the Hudson River railroad, and at the end of two miles had to wait for the train to come up In fact, an ice- yacht runs faster than the wind, because she invariably Bails at an angle to it. We find in this mage line a description, with detailed drawings, of an ingenious method of propelling boats, called after the inventor, the Fetherston Propeller It consists of a screw in the stern, with a double cr ml shaft, which can either he worked by the feet or by one or more pairs of hand levers and one of the special merits of the invention is that one person can both proper and steer The machine is so simple that it c to be managed by the merest novice No noise or jar is per ceptible, and Mr Fetherston is introducing important improvements in the construction of his propeller, by which he confidently expects to be able to attain a speed of eight miles an hour.

professor contends for is the making direct experiments upon the living social organism, the adoption of a tentative line of action, and the relinquishment by the Legislature of its pretensions to create certain social institutions by mere enactment With respect to the liquor trade, for example, he would hand over the matter to a strong executive commission, which should have the power of authorising schemes proposed by local authorities, and should supervise the working of such schemes and collect minute information as to the results Then again with regard to the Irish land question, Professor Jevons suggests that the proper thing to do would be to try peasant proprietorship not byBomevast revolution in the land now ning of Ireland, as proposed by the late Mr. Mill-a measure which, in the first place would never pass Parliament, and, if it did, would cost an enormous sum of money, and probably result in failure-but by a Bread' and progressive experiment ' A dialogue on

prospects of England, Canada, and the United States As to the first of these countries he asserts it to be certain that the land will never go out of cultivation, as some have foreboded "With its fertile soil, rich pasturage, dense population and a climate which permits of probably a greater amount of energetic outdoor labour than that of any other country, the cultivation of the soil, he observes, can never prove unprofitable But it must be remembered that rent is, after all, only the surplus profit, after taxation, cost of cultiva- tion and a satisfactory return to the cultivator for his talent and capital have been paid, and that, in the long run, it is the landowner who will have to bear the entire net loss resulting from increased competition That rents must fall seems therefore inevitable, but to what extent will depend upon the wisdom with which the landowners prepare to meet the threatening competition As far as other classes of the population are concerned, the advent of cheap food cannot but be beneficial If, as is possible, we may see bread at 4d per quarters, and meat at an average of 6d to 8d per it , this will only place the workmen of England in a better position than now to- compete for the custom of the world The farmers of this colony will find in the following extract from Mr Peck, article a confirmation of what has already been repeatedly pointed out in our leading columns -" Our colonies should be shown that when they thus (f e by protective tariffs) compel the ships which fetch their products to return empty, they simply burden the producers with double freight, which comes out of their profits, and that trade follows where nations exchange goods, and diminishes where one party requires payment in gold, involving a heavy loss in exchange If Canada could be persuaded so to modify her tariffs as to encourage the import of those goods with which we can best supply her she might almost monopolise the English grain trade, receiving in return not only cheap manufactures and implements of agriculture, but a splendid revenue, which she now sacrifices for the sake of protecting a few manufacturing interests, and of enabling scheming tradesmen to wax rich at the expense of the whole community Lieutenant Colonel Osborn returns to the subject of the Indian famine of 1877 78, and brings some serious charges against Lord Lytton s administration of that branch of the empire Mr Henry Holbeach offers a critical estimate of the modern novel, selecting as his exemplars the works of a dozen writers who stand in the front ranks as authors of fiction M 1 Lenormant the eminent Oriental scholar contributes a learned essay on the first murder and the founding of the first city in which he traces the connexion of the two from Cain's fratricide, through many countries and epochs, down to the foundation of Rome by Romulus in the blood of his brother Remus After allowing the existence of the ancient tradition of the first fratricide he i proceeds to maintain that this tradition by virtue of a calendars system, was connected with the third month of the year, and that in assigning, a protecting duty to each month the nations of antiquity those that deity whose mythical history approached neareattothetradition which was thenceforth connected with the month and its zodiacal sign Professor Mivart gives us a further instalment of his work on natural history and the Rev Malcolm Maccoll rei ives some forgotten aspects of the Irish question His exposure of the cruelty and injustice in flicted nion Ireland by the protectionist policy of England in the 17th and 18th cen- turies is a very painful one and forcibly illus to ites the iniquity of the principles and the malignity of its operation Under the rule of the Stuarts, the woollen manufactures of Ireland were literally 1 filled by the fiscal policy of the sister island And it was the same with silk cotton, sugar so iii and candles Then as now the
