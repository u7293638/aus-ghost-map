Bobert Louis Stevenson. Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson-the author of "Hyde and Jekyll"-says he will live and die in his Samoan paradise. It is a veritable dreamland where the novelist lives. His home is two miles from Apia, on the island of Upolu ; and the site of the house was, when he bought it, a virgin forest, through whioh the foot had never trod... The house faces on the sea; about it are the great leaves of the cocoanut, palm, and bread fruit trees ; within it is all that civilisation can furnish to minister to creature comfort. One who visited Stevenson there two months ago says: " He is still very thin and fragile ; his shoulders are bent, and his chest seems hollow. But his voice ia strong and hearty, and hiB grasp firm. His com plexion has lost its deathly whiteness, and is now a healthy bronze. .He still wears his hair long, and. his delicate effeminate mouth is shaded by a drooping moustache. His eyes, too, seem to be half closed and dreamy, and he talks with a slow, languid drawl." He believer he has found a safe haven from consumption at the island of Upolu, and hopes to live to a ripe old age. He has no thought or care for affairs on the other side of the globe. If there should be a massacre of Europeans at Samoa because of the heavy taxes imposed on the natives, he has no fear of personal injury, for he believes that the natives re spect and trust him. He may use his spare time in writing another book. In fact he has already a deal of manuscript ready for the printer. But he has no desire ever to change his locus, and with his wife and mother he will dream away existence amid the ghosts with whioh his fancy has peopled his house and its surroundings.
