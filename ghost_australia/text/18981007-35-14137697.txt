SWEDISH CUSTOMS. " The Latin race," says a celebrated author, " u feminine, even in its men and the Anglo-Saxon race is masculine, even in its women " In fact, the men of the Latin race are as nervous, impression- able, changeable, and bright is women Their manners also are as insinuating as woman's, and they can talk brightly even when they have nothing to talk about But as a strange contrast to these peculiarities, the Latin is a materialist, and the Anglo Saxon an idealist The Latin considers life as a passage of material pleasures , the Anglo Saxon considers it as a school, with duty for school- master There are exceptions to these rules, we know (says " Le Journal des Modes "), but these are the rules which distinguish the characteristics of both races The Swedes, though not of pure Anglo Saxon race, may be included within its limits, and some of their customs deserve mention For instance, when there is a wedding the bridegroom carries a whip in his hand as a sign of his authority in the domestic circle If there is even a whisper of scandal against the bride she cannot wear the vir- ginal wreath of orange blossoms The way a peasant bride is adorned in Sweden is curious, all her friends lend her jewels, Le , which they hang on her head, neck, arms, hands, bodice, shoes, etc Then a silver ring is placed in one shoe, and this becomes the proper ty of the boy who is allowed the honour of taking off the bride's shoes at night before the guests separate, and then a perfect fight takes place between the married guests and those who are not married, who surround the bride to prevent the bridegroom taking the bride, which, of course, he eventually does, and then runs away with her like the " conquering here that he is " A Swedish wedding usually lasts several days, and among the many ceremonies is the planting of a fir tree in memory of the day A Swedish pe isant rarely marries a girl not of his own place The Swedish peasant is simple, affectionate, courteous, hospitable, and cheerful The women's dress consists usually of a yellow woollen skirt, and an over gown of white cloth, fastened at the back with black. A black collar encircles the neck, and a red apron covers the front of the skirt, A white cloth fichu is draped on the head The gast dress is richer in colours, and a red embroidered belt is worn round the waist Married and Single women dress alike A Swedish peasant s house consists of two rooms and a kitchen and a baking oven, and the whole made of trunks of trees. The roof is made of branches of trees covered with mud There are no belts or knockers to the door, everyone gossip freely, without asking permission The first room that is entered is the sitting-room and dining-room, and sometimes it is also used as a bedroom The furniture consists of a large wooden table, chairs, and several little sofas, which, joined together, serve as beds when needed A large clock is always to be found in the room, and a chest of drawers The floor is covered with branches of fir trees There is also large fire-place, and when the fire is alight no candles are used N oxt to this room is a second room, used only for sleeping and for hanging up the family's wearing apparel Nearly every peas ant's house has a little garden in which to grow cabbages, carrots, apples, so Trees, however, are rare in Sweden, especially in the north O pou fields are considered more beautiful than forests Swedish peasants live on brown bread, cheese, butter, and salt beef and mutton They do not like fresh meat or vegetables or potatoes Their drink is light, home-made beer. They sometimes drink coffee, but only fashionable people drink tea As In Ireland, the family pig often shares the bedroom with his master Doors and windows are rarely opened, even in summertime, and the people rarely address on going to bed Thor wash only once a week, on Saturday night. Like all ignorant people of every country, the Swedish poor are very superstitious, especially in illness. For instance, corns are cured by someone telling the] sufferer that someone is dead The friend says, " So-and-so is dead " " And my corns are dead'" says the sufferer lies must be repeated three times If any one complains of any pain, and someone says, " It is a lia the pain disappears at once Spitting is supposed to keep away evil spirits, witchcraft, and ghosts The first time an unmarried man stands godfather to a baby it must be a girl, and the first time a girl stands godmother to a child it must be a boy, otherwise she will never marry The water which serves for the baptism is carefully kept, to be used in several lllnesBos No- where in the world is the love for children so great as in Sweden and Norway, especially in Norway. In fact, the monotony of existence is relieved only by this love Very little difference exists between the Swedes and Norwegians in their customs-so little that it need not be mentioned.
