Park gave chase and came up with the fellow, who was dressed in a white smock, with a coffin lid 6ft long on his back, and his face smeared with phosphorus. The old miner grappled with him, and both fell to the ground, Park getting * firm hold of bis leg and calling for help. Finding he could not get away the ghost drew a knife and stabbed Park in the arm, cutting through the coat and drawing blood. He then escaped. Park reported the matter to the police and showed the wounds- He described the ghost as being about 35 years old, and a power ful roan. Mrs Westlaw, wife of the city missionary, and other residents of the neighbourhood confirm his story so far as hearing his wife screaming for help, bat they all appear to hare been afraid to go to her rescue. re* BMttf fcaatt** Kftttw Â»??
