THE OPEN COLUMN. 2 rax HEDimm. Dear our — Hi do think Bar as ow hi wood rite jiat a lyne or 2 abent hour eity hof Mai lahlah, hand hif ypa like too print mi scribble hi will aend yon another 1 anmday. For mi part hi dont hold with that Ghost man what rites 3 yonr paper, cose there are many ynng femaUa what are werry nervous and they doo really think as ow there are a live Ghost in our town. One lady said 2 me that all her bens were stole, and ahe thinks it must be & ghost what steals em. Hand he ahonld not aay anything agin them preachers, which is werry1 unbecoming on his part. Wen I read tne paper last week with that nice piece of potery in it, aez i 2 ini old man, why, Billy, if we aint pot a really poet in our town, sez i to him, Billy, if I can spare the money. I'll get him to rite a piece on our Diamond Wed ding day which aint far off, eez he, all right old gal save up yer money. Well sur, Billy and me went to the concert last Wednesday, whan all them ladies and gentlemen was a ?ktf11?,?' Pri»s. I w«» w«rry surprised, sir, to hear those people a laughing and talk ing wen them gentlemen was reciting ; why, wen hi was a gal they naed 2 be very quiet, and if any body made a noise the chairman would take off his glasses and stand ud and aay a word Z em about bit. I think as ow me and my old man will go 2 the gold mine* At Teetotal, where they are finding so many big nuggets, hi wish hi could only feel that big nugget what weighs nearly 3 lb.t snm gentlemen what went from here only stopped ? week, but they are going back to another try as the saying is. That there man what found'the big nugget on October 22, ought to be thanked for a keeping of it quiet, cos if he had not, a lot moie folks would are gome tew the diggings. I ham, Yours truly, MARGARET LOUISA.
