A Singapore Snake Story. Tlio Shtnpoo, a vernacular , newspaper pub lished in North China, gives currency to the following snake, story:-"A Singapore China. ,i man, with an assistant, kept a grocery store ,^0 in one of die Straits Settlements. Lately, afteiu.' a heavy night's rain, fee Chinaman, finfflng .tha __ morning air to be damp and cold, aUempte$4pvJ& pull the bed covering over him, hat felt it to be*^^^ unusually weighty. Tugging at it with maoh force it did not yield, ana on taking a look at it to his great horror he perceived a great snake coiled on it at the foot of the quilt. The reptile did not stir, and in a lond whisper the assistant was summonod, and together they mode a running noose with a pieoe of .pliant rattan and safely slipped it round the snake's neck. Then attaching two stout ropes to the two ends of the noose the two began to haul away, tightening the noose at ever; pull.. The straggle, though unequal, was a severe one. Crockery utensils, packages of tea, ginger -preserves, barrels of flour, and all other articles within reaoh of the snake's tail weft smashed or sent flying about the room; but the snake gave up the ghost. The monster measured 12ft. in length and over 2ft. in circumference. The China man, so far as his store is concerned, is utterly bankrupt, and the last we have heard of him was his intention to go into the snake-catching business.
