Sleeping Scandals AFTERMATH OF THE BOOM VI.—SOME NOTABLE INSOLVENCIES OF 1802. The list given below of 1892 insolvencies is the first instalment of a group of failures which, when completed, will comprise all the important Victorian bankruptcies from January, 1892, up to date. As in the case of the Secret Compositions these disturbed ghosts of dead fortunes, and in some cases slaughtered reputations, are made " to walk " through these columns " without prejudice " to the persons by whose names they are distinguished. There are instances in which the insolvents entirely succumbed beneath their disasters ; others there are in which they set to work bravely to earn the wherewithal to pay 20s. in the £ ; while there are others again who took full advantage of all legal forms, and, after having failed, never gave their creditors another thought. Necessarily it is not possible for a newspaper to sort these varieties of insolvents out. It can onlv give the facts as it finds them, and leave qualifications, extenuations, and condemnations to be distributed by those who can say best in wluit direction they are deserved. The year 1S92 was about the first in which the disastrous' efi'ect of the collapsed Doom commenced to be felt. During it there were 1,024 regular insolvencies with liabilities aggregating £2,GHH,i»:W. If compositions, etc., are added to these there were ],)25 insolvents, among whom there were IK lawyers, 63 publicans, !)!) farmers, and 50 contractors, while the total liabilities of nil the bankrupts amounted to 25-1,251. The stupenilousncss of that total is better appreciated when compared with the figures for the same year of England and Wales, in which countries there were 4,057 insolvencies with liabilities totalling 1'8,892,1G2 ; or only about half a million more than Victoria's enormous bill.

As time rolls on, the material for the story is becoming deeper and deeper buried beneath the records of subsequent events. If not dug out now, it will be iu danger for being ever lost, so that the Champion considers it a duty to keep on digging while the job is comparatively easy. The future historian will then find some of his matter in a handy shape. We must repeal that, we cannot guarantee the completeness of the compositions list in our last issue until the authorities give access to the ollicia! records. As wc stilted before publishing any of it, we do not doubt that many who arc on it were driven to make a composition through no fault of their own, nor that some of them were being greatly wronged by inaccurate statements about them appearing on the list? being handed about more or less surreptitiously. Another instance of this latter evil efl'ect of the serresy supposed to be observed in this matter has come to light. It is stjiU'd that Mr. Geo. Witheiis set aside i'luo to be divided amongst all his creditors, whereas the sum was £1,00(1. We have mude enquiries, and find that not only was ten times the reported amount paid over, hut that Mr. Witiikks actually paid some hundreds of pounds iu excess of the larger sum. Our regret that the mistake should have been repeated in these columns is only tempered by the knowledge that the publicity now given to this correction will prevent the lnistutement being circulated any longer in private.
