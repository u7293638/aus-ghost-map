RE-APPEARANCE OF THE KING'S PLAINS GHOST. To the Editor of the Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal. Sir,â€”Having been informed that a large blazing light was constantly appearing at night in a large paddock belonging to Messrs Costello, Flood and Cullen, at King's Plains, I was curious to know if such was the case. On Wednesday night I watched on purpose, and I saw a large blazing light, six or seven times, remaining for about one minute, and appearing again in a different distant spot. To the best of my belief, there appeared in the middle of the said blazing light, the shape and figure of a black man. The distance at which I inspected these appearances, as near as I can judge, was about two thousand yards. The above are facts. Meantime be good enough to publish in your valuable paper, the above statement. I remain. Sir, Your very obedient servant, JOHN WELSH. October 12th, 1855.
