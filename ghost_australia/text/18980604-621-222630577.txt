[?] I THE CONSCIENCE AND FUTURE JUDGMENT. I eat alone with my conscience In a place where time had ceased, And we talked of my former living -a In a land where the years increased. . And I felt I should have to answer ' The question it put to me,. - . And to face the answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, And things that I thought were dead things Were alive with a terrible might. And the vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to face. Alone with, my conscience, sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far away warning Of a sorrow that was to be mine. In a land that then was the .future, But now Is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking Of the judgment day to be, But kitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there were a future To this land beyond the grave; But no one gave me answer. And no one came to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by, For it was but the thought of my past llfe Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming. And tbo vision passed away, ' And I knew the far-away warning Was a warning of yesterday. And 1 pray that I may not forget it In this laud before the grave; That I may not cry in the future. And no one come to save. -. ' And so I have learned a lesson. Which 1 ought to have known before. And which, though I learnt it dreaming, 1 hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with my conscience. In the place where the years incrcass, And I try to remember the future In the land where time will cease. And I know of the future judgment. How dreadful soe'er it be. That to sit alone with my conscience Will be judgment enough for me. â€”London "Spectator. .
