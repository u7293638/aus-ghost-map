PHCEBE. Ebb pales in Heaven the morning star, A bird, the loneliest of its kind, Hears Dawn's faint footfall from afar While all its mates are dumb and blind. It is a wee sad-coloured thing, As shy and secret as a maid, That, ere.in choir the robins sing, Pipes its own name like one afraid. It seems pain- prompted to repeat, The story of some ancient ill, But Phxbe ! Phabe ! sadly sweet Is all it says, and then is stilL It calls and listens : Earth and sky, Hushed by the pathos of its fate, Listen; no whisper of reply Ck-mes from ite doom-dissevered mate. Phabe ! it calls and calls again, And Ovid, could he but have heard, Had hung a legendary pain About the memory o£ the bird i A pain articulate so long In penance of some mouldered crime Whose ghost still flies the Furie&' throng Down the waste solitudes of Time ; Waif of the young World's wonder hour, When gods found mortal maidens fair. And will malign was joined with power, Love's kindly laws to overbear, Like Procue, did it feel the stress And coil of the prevailing words Close round its being and compress Man's ampler nature to a bird's ? One only memory left of all The motley crowd of vanished scenes, Hers— and vain impulse to recall By repetition what it means. Pheebe! is all it has to say In painful cadence o'er and o'er, Like children that have lost their way And know their names but nothing more. It is a type, since Nature's lyre Vibrates to every uole in moo. Of that insatiable desire, Meant to be so, since life began ? I, in strange lands at grey of dawn, Vakeful have heard that fruitless plaint Through Memory's chambers deep with drawn Renew its iterations faint. So nigh! yet from remotest years [t seems to draw its magic, rife With longings unappeased«nd tears Orawn from the very source of life. -jakks fivsar* fcr/vBi&v; \n tfo Gtmry Vfgqmt. - ' J
