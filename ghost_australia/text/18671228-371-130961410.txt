After the tables were cleared away and order was restored, -which was not till -taite the time when it was advertised the ^fgPtoshouJcL have been taken, the company-! %-eg$n toassemblefor the evening'? entertain ments and the lecture bythe Rev. Canon Rassell, which had been advertised Jhe take place- It was nnfortunate, though perhaps unavoidable, that all arrangements forthe entertainment were not in rather a more for ward state than they were, for it was mere than half an hoqr after the propertime before tbe business of the evening could be com menced. The evening was very warm, and the schoolroom being filled partly with a young and rather impatient audience, the heat and the delay began to be rather trying. This was of course placing th^lecturer under | a disadyantage.as it mugfe ^^-been evident, j from the. uneasy movements pervading the j zoom, to him and all others on the platform that a supply of patience is limited. How- j «ver, in time thie. was rectified, and the Rev Canons Russell and Coombs went on to the platform ; also the teachers of^the school, and the portion of the choir which it had been arranged should at internals sing several pieces of music during the evening. -The Rev. Canon Russell was received with some applause, and Mr. T. O. Jones proposed that j the Rev. Canon Coombs take the chair, which was duly' carried. The Ciwbman opened the proceedings by alluding to the delay which had unavoidably taken place, and then expressed himself happy to see so nwoeroua an! assembly present. It showed the interest that was taken in the ?object ofthe meeting, and also that it was felt possible to intertwine religion in social gather ings, thereby divesting it of some of tb* gloom which it was sometimes contended was Attached to it. He regretted the s«ul calamity whieh had befallen a large partion of the colo nists, and to its heavy nature heiregietted that he eould bear testimony, for having travelled far lately, he had seen sadly -too much of it. However, he trusted this dark cloud might haYe its silver lining. It was his duty to say that apologies bad been received from the Rev. R. Reid (of Adelaide), the Rev.Mr. Read (of Lyndooh YaUey),and from the Rev. J. Jasper.Smyth {of Kapunda),all of whom ex pressed their regret that circumstances pre vented them attending. The choir then sang— Mrs. Coombs kindly presiding at the piano— with great taste, sweetness, and ability, a piece of musie, which was received with considerable applause. Mr. Mansom, the Secretaryof the school, then read the report, vWch set forth ,that there were 222 children (124 of whom were boys a»d 9». giri») on the books of the school, and. showed Sthat ife had been steadily increas ing for some years past, Additions had been made to the library and a harmonium par chased for the use of the school, which ren deved an appeal necessary to the liberality of the oongregationand f HendflL Mr. T. O. Jokes said the meeting was called together -to support the claims of the Sunday School, and as it was six or seven years since the last tea meeting was held, tt impossible to say tnat such meetings bad been held too frequently. If anything, he thought they should come round a little oftener. There was a want of lady teachers in the school, and if their number -could be increased* he thought: the school also would be augmented in num-v berg. He was happy to be abletobear his5 testimony that there was already a noble band of teasherg employed, whose exemplary lives, it was impossible to doobt,would have a mast beneficial influence around them. He would conclude his few remarks by cordially seconding the adoption of the report. Mr. ItaxMi said it was a pleasing, although unexpected, duty which he had been called upon to perform^ and whilst he iras much gratified with the fiourishing repoit read by the Secretary there was one point in Suliday sehool teaching which he had noticed else where, darinj- the 21 years he had been a teacher, as well as at St. George's, that, he, should like first; . to allude tol -Siia was the exceediagly small resnlts that were -^8&eii; considering the great efforts that were put forth. These results were wofullv small - alj the teacheis seemed to d° was tc ^ive a KunuusfiLKlA Cftrt nf t/UUk t/h fTia nnnilo ? «. r.n_L of moral tingei to thtgr characters,' whereby they grew up resectable. ch,urch-gbing.peopJa.

To this he imparted a peculiar ' interest by biioglng in and slightly treating upon aeanees' here and ejsewhere, and showing that whilst ;it^ waa ; impj*Kible to account for much thai jtfmost' everyone had, witnessed, it was equally diffloult to say how or -why the wiwawls aod con jurors were able apparently to violate several well- kno\ro natural laws ?' j-twi pare of tas ieeture. was iisconea to with marked Interest; W- at its dose an interval :took place of about . half an hour, which was taken advantage of by the ^ndience.to gtun a breath or two of cool air, partake of a glass of water, &c.; ?I,1'' ? ^ ; ; Master Frkdbiuck Harris was then called upon to favor the -eompahy with ' The Spanish Chaaipion,' giving the martial portions in a spirited manner, whil exhibiting much feeline in tJig^ ifiorfepathetSe parts.'' ^ ' ?** The Choir eaog a piece of music, which elicited : much- approbation;- and the learned Canon resumed his lecture. The second nortion was devoted to the ^xtfaordinary eoia'cidences which have occurred^ and which Jbave obtained the not unfitting appellation of «isecoad sight.' From these, well attested as they were, the lecture^ reasoned that ia tibe ipte$ent 'lyuitefl 4 state of our knowledge of the laws .of either^ mind or matter, It was all too sooii to afflnh utf- '? hesitatingly that there'' were not times - during which we were not made- conscious of strange and startling things in ;a manner that was utterly beyond human comprehension. At the iclose of the lecture, which had seemed to 'grow ai interest the longer the C^non dilated, he was greeted with loud: and prolonged applause. The Chairman moved' a vote of -thanks tx the lecturer, who had, he said, treated that which savored of the inexplicable in a reveren ? ial and not thoughtless manner. He oonsidered that it was useless to attempt to laugh or sneer away these things, as the' extraordinary dis covery of a murder by a dream was detailed in law book9, whieh were as little, likely as any to go astray into the regious of romance. : Mr. T. O Jokes seconded the motion, which was put to the meeting and carried unani mously. The Rev. Canon Kusskix had great pleasure in accepting the vote of that^k^A^ unanimously accorded, although he bads&m;^gfts thought it was but a wr ffitan ^ for the trouble he h^n&t1ce;«^ hrmade to look foolish ffliabout 8?e minutes.' X ? The Choir tlwai' Tend^eil the b^antiful and popular air, ^just J^fore tt^v^a^l^taiother,' which was gffee!ted rwith. la»d-.^pplfcusc and yooiferous^x^eni^ed^' ; Mr. TavLor, juh.^ proposed aTdfeof'thanks to the ladies for the kind £tnd hearty manner in wnicn tney naa lent their aid on the occasion. He was pux?led to think what would haveibeen done without them, r- Mr. D. Baldjck seconded the resolution,, as' the ladies were: always ready to come forward in every good word and work. The 'vote was carried by acclamation, after which the choir sang 'Now -pray we for our eouhtay. The Eev. Canon Rcsskix said that at the solicitation of the (Chairman he 'was- about to say something that would not seem very logical. A little time ago he had said that the reception of a vote of . thanks made one,; look 'foolish for' about five minutes, but circumstances altered eases. It was his pleasing taste to propose a vote of thanks to the choir, who had so ably Assisted at the evening's entertainment, and it was well known that ladles never could look foolish under any circumstances. He did not wish to flatter, the vanity of. the Gawler people, but he was sure they had a choir which would bear favorable comparison : with iuiyone else where. ; On the part of Ihk' Choir Mr. Wright returned thanks, saying they were always happy to ren der any assistanoe'they -«3|uld effl such occasions. Mr. Snkll proposed, - and Master Harris seconded ; a vote of thanks to the trustees; and, - master of the schoolroom for lending it on' the? occasion, j : The Mayor ov Gawxkr (Mr. J. Martin) had great pleasure in rising to propose a vote of thanks to the Chairman. He had listened with . some astonishment to the speeeh of one of the teachers, who, after teaching 21 years, lamented the little that he had been' able to accomplish. He (the Mayor.) thought that being thecase, he could not by thistitne have much faith in his work j Whilst listening to the lecture he could not help : uiw «w rev. lecturer naa sown some seed from which it was to be hoped there would not be a very plentiful harvest. He had hoped they had left all about ghosts and hobgoblins behind them in the old country. To complete the subject it was his (the Mayor's) opinion .it should have beeu told how the ghosts were dealt with. Parsons and ministers were called, in to lay them for doing which, they always looked but for their fees. He hoped the Canon had not sown the seed. with the idea that he should gain a pleutifnl harvest at; fees (which -parsons -and ministers were so fond of) by so doing. : Canon BtftreU. s^id that the Mayor of ?Gawler, with that happy selection of topics for a speech with which he seamed to be endowed,, had again tried to do what he had succeeded in ' on a foriaer ooeasion^- vi^ getting ail Gawler together by the ears. The Mayor had -thought ! proper to criticise lnsXthe lecturer^) treatment ! of hia subject, wh«a it was only expected of. him j to move a vote of thanks to the Chairman* : It I was cert^n that the manner in which the sub- j ject had been treated had not been immaculate j or teywd orvtieisin, hot it was unnecessary, un- ! V^iucu^w, OI4U ifttuvufc V«C for the Ma^or to hint that he (the Canon) had been trying to call up ghosts in order to receive fees far laying them. He, was, in bis vocation, quite aa disinterested s& the Meyror could he, and if the .Mayor would coasent . to labor for notbiag, he (the Ca»on) was vjuite ready to do so also ;? and if the Mayor thought ; that he. had l^tt hehind him aUMs niwrrowness $ feeling. aU his tht-A^rant small^ninde?! . . notions, he r (the Canon) coidd as^uo'hvm t^at be would require a great deal of s^-mlture befoare he was worthy of the advantages by whi^w In this new, iw-bie made a'i|^ec» before which w;as not vorthy of him pr of Ins positi-»i, and this time he, had hut l^p^tedthe offence, Mr. T, G.
