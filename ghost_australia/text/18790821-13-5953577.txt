ST. PAUL'S WRITINGS. The Bishop of Melbourne gave the third of his series of lectures on 'The Development of Doctrine m the AArritmga of St Paul in St, Paul s Church j esterday afternoon, before a veij large congregation The Bisiioi said -In my last lecture I endeavoured to give j ou n general sketch of the spiritual doctrine as to the law, and the means of ita fulfilment, with which the church was endowed by its Divine Master and Pounder In mai mg that sketch I incorpor vtcd, as I was entitled to do, the teaching of St John with that of thosjnop tical evangellsts '1 he Lord Jesus Christ bid taught all which St John reported Lut if the disciples had heard they had by no means understood or appropriated it Some things thej had forgotten other things their Master had as jet been unable to îeveal to them I have many things to saj unto j ou, saul He, but je cannot bear them now How would it fine with them, then, in the future m respect to tins lost or un impnrted 1 nowledge ' lhe I ord promised to send to them the Holy Spirit who should bring back to their memory whit they had forgotten and should besides le id them into all the truth which it was neeessaiy for them to know Ihej were not secular thin0s which the Spirit should rev e ii but the things of Christ He shall take of mine, said Our Lord and shall show it unto jon, inter yretmg eiuitual things as bt 1 vul teaches to spiritual men But how then, should this revel ition be made' Su Idenly or ¡,raduallj bj one miraculous act at Ponte cost, oi slowlj, as circunist mees prepare 1 tho vvnj and the minds ol the disciples were (,raduallj prepared to recall or ap prebend the tiut li \\.\as the bpint to show to the apostles the deep things of Cod by the method of instantineoua illumination or bj that of development I believe that in general people aboiime that all this was done at once, by the mstin taneous flash of the light of Pentecost so that then atonte the ai ostles went forward to the founding of the Kingdom of God fully equipped with all the spiritual knowledge thej should ever need or acquire lhe dead enini, influence of this supposition on all the Btudj of the subsequent apoatolic literatiuc it is almost impossible to conceive It re luces everjthine, to i dead level There is no plaj of thought no growth of knowledge, no progress of iction 1 he matured thought of the lattht 1 auline 1 pistles is assumed to exist m the first of St Peter s sermons nnd in the history of one of the greatest crises throu"h which the church of Christ ever passed we see instead of a drain i full of p issionate feehne, glow in" thought and gradu illj accu initiating interest a great burst of spiritual light and love gradually sinking into the tameness of comparatively commonplace life One nnsle idinj, assumption freezes the vv aters of early church history as efleetually as the frost of a northern winter coi)L,ealn the rivers and s¡ rint,a And this assumption is ifter all not only baseless, but opposed to a great weight of the clearest evidence The very phraseoloy of Our Sav îour s principal promise discredits it (lohnwi 13) The word here is u iyi;eT£i-Ile shall lead jon in the waj as a guide does A treat journej lay before the a. ostles on their waj to the highest truth All indeed had been sketched before for them in principle and outline by their Alastei But there were some things which they could not receive There were other thura which thev had forLOtten 'lo re cover what they had lost and to win what thej had not been ready for, was the object, conaeiously or unconscioualj lo themselves, of their mental journej And the Holy Ghost should go before them as their guide, warning them what turnings to avoid what paths to follow, till at length He brou"ht them to the destined goal. Alford's comment here is excellent. "The Lord had taught them the truth, and nothing but the truth, but He had not taught them the whole truth, because they were not able to bear it. This He should lead them into, open the way to and unfold it by degrees." That again, which Our Lord's language suggests (viz. that the method of the divine teaching was the method of development) our knowledge of the history and literature of the primitive age conclu- sively proves. Consider first the evidence furnished by the literature. It is quite true that one may discern in the synoptic gospels the germs of all those great truths which are so fully developed in the Gospel according to St. John. But still it must be confessed that of the deepest truths of Our Lord's theology the synoptists give us only the outlines, while in St. John we have the completed picture. What does this mean? Have we here an instance of development? I think it cannot be doubted. No one can read the account given Alford, Godet, or Davidson of the literary phenomena pre- scnted in the first three gospels without ngreeing m their conclusion that we havo in them a repoit bj three persona of that recital of Our Lords life which was found most o_ i lar and useful in the pnmitive churches these atones and lessons are those which bud most impressed the minda of apostles, which they moat delighted to tell and their catechumens to heir Gnduallj thesestones and lessons gathered themselves into groupa and clusters , arrangements so well known, and so de uly loved that thej became at last well nigh sacred It would have been nn possible to separate them without outraging most solemn and precious associations And so the rvangelists reported them as they were current in the chinches which they beat knew, with all their substantial identity, and detailed diversity Here, then, wehavc the earliest and most popular and most vvulelj useful form of the Gospel nar rative St John wrote at a later time -near the end of the centurj Hie f.reat battle of the filth had been fou"ht the victorj of spiritual religion had been substantially won But some echoea of the great conflict still lingeied in corners among obscure sects I ut the church and more csncciallj the last aurviv ing apostle, h id been lea into the wholo truth 'those vehement conllicts-that mighty stirring and striving of mind and heart-had atunulated both thouüit and inemorj Truth waa needed to solve the churchs difficulties, and so the Spirit brojght back to this-the deepest souled of the apostles- words of the Lord well nigh lost, because at first so imperfectly understood Compare the account of the multiplication of the loaves in the thrce sj noptists-where it is Bimply an account of the miracle-with that of St John, where the miracle onlj aeries aa a text for the pi o found diecourae on the Bread of Life and jon will see at once what I mean And just a3 the exigencies of the church became an in Btrument to stimulate the memory of St lohn, they were made to perform the same oilice for the thoughts of St Paul Itvvasthe S¡ mt of God no doubt which quickened tlic memore or strengthened the thought, but not the less was it the conlhct the difliculty which furnished the outward occasion for this result lhe proof of this fact is written quito as clearly and frequently on the pac.es of early church history ÎSotlinig could be plainer than Our Saviours te iclunc, that His Gospel was tobo for all the world and jet how Blowly and with whit surprising diflicultv the post Pentecostal church discovered the pinn puiport of His teaching Our T ord li id told His disciples that He had other sheep who were not of tins fold (the fold of Isiael) and that manj should come from the 1 vst and Weat and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom while the children of the Kingdom should be cast out Aul as if this was not enough He bade thom m Ills palting commission to go forth and make disciples of all nations Ihe3e state ments seemed to be plain enough, especially the last but how far were the disciples able to receive and undcistand them ' Aftei the Lord s death and resurrection tnd after those post resurrection discourses in which Ile lind explained all things in the law and the Paulina and the prophets concerning Himself one would nt least have expected some alteration in their point of view But we are told that their one question was, not how 13 the Kingdom of God to he extended through out the world but "wilt thou at tins time restore the kingdom to Israel' lheir tbou"bts are running upon the things which they learnt 111 their early d lys in the Syna gofcue-upon the glory of Messiah s Kingdom and the grandeur it Bhould bring to Israel I heir ono new thought was this-that the résurrection had proved Jesus to be the Messiah and that His death had fulfilled certain predictions of the prophets But aa to the Kingdom, it was to belone, to Israel, and to bo substantially, 111 form and natuie y hat they "had been taught to expect it to be AA eil but surely their views will be changed °{ter the day of Pentecost I hey certainly Bhould be The very form of the celestial ellusion coming as tongues of flamo, and enabling them to speak m divers languages, cmphaticiscd their Masters direction that they should 1,0 forth and speak to all man kind And much more did the substantial fact vv Inch that form betokened Tor what had happened to them ' According to His promise, the Christ after the flesh had now drawn nigh to them as tho ChriBt after the spirit Through tho mediation of the Holy GhoBt, the Lord whom they had once only known through bodily moans-by His looks, His geBtures, His works, His word-had now come into their hearts He spoke to them directly bb Bpint to spirit, Ho poured into their languid heart and will the full force of His divine life And that it was the very life of Jesus was proved at once. It gave them their Master's mind and heart They felt the redeeming impulse that has been called Christ's enthusiasm of humanity so strongly, that it drove them forth at once from their cowering seclusion to proclaim the advent of Gods Balvation, and to invite all men to partake of it Their love for man and enthusiasm for God made them forget thcmselv es Danger was nothing to them , duty was a joj They got a grand senso of power and ascendancy, which went forward rejomnglj to tempt conthct and to court hoBtihtj.

life had been transferred from tho ritual to the spiritual sphere-to that sphere in which they had a gift for all men, and where all men must be brethren, they would call to mind their Lord s commission, under stand it, and proceed to execute it m all its largeness Iso such thing As to their out ward life and public activity, thej still acted as Jews Thev still attended all the religious

disputes had arisen be tween the Jewish and Hellenistic Christians Stephen had been appointed one of the deacons to aettle the dispute and administer the common funds He w as a powerful preacher, and bv his preaching produced the fiistpopultr movement against the church At firvt ihe church lind been rather populir than otherwise with the mass of the people It was the vvorldlj minded and unnopular

this-for the assertion that theie was 80methino in Christ grander than Law or lemjle- Stephen died Hie wild beast having drunk of blood thirsted for more And so the mob fell upon the church to which

Ghost;-had failed so egregious!) to understand the Lord s words, Mai e disciplea of all nations ' That they had failed-that they were only able to rise to the heightof this great thought gradually under the stimulus of conlhct and through the teaching of miracle is clear But how could it be Very easi'y my brethren, it only we recognise the fact that tho Spirit taught by the method of development Assume that the Apostles were taught all truth at a bound-by tho Bingle Hash of Pen tecosti- and tho history of tho Acts is not only incomprehensible but mcredi ble But assume, what is the fact that the Spirit led them as a guide leads through and by means of the dimculties of the way, and then all is plain They understood their Master s words at first only bo far as their strong Jewish prcpoBsessions permitted Hale we never known truly converted men who were bo blinded by their predestinarían prejudices as to interpret " all " m ScriDture to mean all the elect ' And if so, ib it so very wonderful that tho Apostles interpreted "all nations' to mean "the Tews in all nationB, 'as their whole education had pre- pared them to do' They were under the m iluencc of the Spirit-they wore being led and educated by the Spirit-but if you ask how, I reply that both the literature and history of the primitiv echurch answer-Gradually bj the method of development, bj a graduel open mg of the
