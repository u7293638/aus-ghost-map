A BAILWAY BOMAnCR , \ From the window of a carriage on the North London Railway, as the train rum bles over stifling little City streets, and rushes past the back-gardens of suburban terraces, you often catch curious glimpses of house-interiors ; and within the carnage you may sometimes catch anakgous glimpses of heart interiors, partial revela tions of life-histories, that make you angry because they are so partial, and pique your curiosity. ' The best bribe,' writes Emer son, 'which London offers to-day to the imagination is, that in such a vast variety of people and conditions one can believe there is room for persons of romantic. cha- plenty of room in London for romantic in cidents ; and, maugre the prosaic tendency absurdly imputed to railways, such incidents as I have Baid, may ever and anon be wit nessed on the metropolitan 'omnibus lines.' Here is my latest case in point ^ The other evening I turned into the squeezed-up passage which gives ingress to the Highbury Railway Station. My imme diate predecessors 'were an elderly woman, in neat but rusty widow's weeds, and a younger woman in bonnet, shawl, and dress of modish shape, but very common- mate- rial. She did not look ridiculous, how ever, in her cheap finery. Her figure and her walk were both so good, that only for creature richer robes. The imitation-lace that fell over her chignon was yellow enough to be real, but one's eyes soon glanced from that to the genuine silky dark-brown hair it checkered. She half turned to pre vent the swing-door from banging in my face, and I had a chance of stealing a iook at her's. It did not exactly answer to her figure, being very pale, and having no strikingly beautiful feature except the large liquid eyes ; but in these, and indeed in the whole of her face there was an expression that puzzled me. A good many faces are mere masks, except to a physiognomist who can read little lines that cannot be smoothed away when the bland or self satisfied look for public inspection is put on ; but hers could not help speaking all over, though what it said I could not in the least make out Its meaning was like a secret.told in Sanscrit It bothered me like a riddle one is to) proud of one's acuteness to give up, or a name or a quota tion that flits in the misty memory, ever and anon giving a flap with its flying Bkirte, but obstinately refusing to be cap tured. Although not more than two or three and twenty, she had a weary look ; but there was no resignation in her face, which, in spite of its despondency, gave Z you the impreasion of one that still be- fi lieved in happiness, and was hungry after -; it ; and her deep, iuacrutable eyes eeemed, -1 almost simultaneously, roguishly innocent | and remorsefully penitent, affectionately be- \ seeching, and scornfully defiant. Perhaps ? I did not see all this at the first glance ; J perhaps, when I did see it, it was all my j fancy. But at anyrate, tile face puzzled j me as eood as I saw it, and continued to j puzzle me. !' ' Two second returns to Hackney,' said 1 the old lady laying down her shilling. My )] journey chanced to be a similar one, and I ';| determined if possible to get into the same i] carriage with my psychological curiosity, ji Tbe clerk, who was taking his tea very \ much as dogs are said to lap the mite, ap- ; peared at his pigeon-hole with his mouth i full of bread and' batter, and mapped oar i blue-nud-pink tickets in and out' of his j stamper as if he wished they Were our 1 noses. We descended the stairs that are | almost as gloomy and grimy as a, coal-pit ; shaft, and when we reached the worn f platform bricks, fonnd a strain, had jrist i gone, and that we had therefore nearly: a - quarter of an hour to wait Waiting at j Highbury Station is, as a rule, one oFthe \ most depressing modes of passing time. , The station buildings are black with -the ' deposits of innumerable funnel-fames. The yellow-faced clock looks afflicted : with jaundice, and heartily sick of the; teBk trf telling the time.

The Poplar train was watting ; and hurrying across the platform, , my (tnnle, her companion, and myself, once jnore.got, into the same compartment, an end one with a single seat ? There «?«)» jjuiggpc, already in it on the off-side— ftwinbrimfid,, handsome, but stem-looking tnan, whose , glossy blue broadcloth, h^_ satin -«fst; coat, and massive, Albert .cbiai, comtanedi with his pAj»tj^ se^ed .to' jndicato'a*^, he was a shipmaster m^his ehoregwig togs. In &e; hurry of entering the taniage,, neither of the women noticed him; but . when the train had started, the ypnrjsgetf chanced to glance *t him, as he sat ou'ihe . other side of her frieaoV-Stwing abeenlly, peony red, and then more than relapsed in '?~\ a chalk-like pallor : the perspiration burst oat in cold big beads upon her fore bead ; her -white lips twitched The rary ing expression of her mobile face chased uiic auuwcr uj^c me 'rv1 w ouu iiw-i|j n c va an April day ; but the shame was deeper, aid the defiance more angry, and the sup plication, I fancied, both more pleading and ' more hopeless. She made a little start . from her seat, as if she would have gone to the man, and then she Ehrank back again, as if she wanted to hide from him. Directly afterwards, she pulled her friend's deere, and directed her attention to the gloomy mariner. Ko sooner did the old lady see him, than she sprang op, and fairly hogged him. '? ' O Harry,' she said sobbing, ' why J3!*!..'* *»An tall we rnnTJ A.^ma li#\ni0 T' ' Why, mother,' shouted the man, Jook- 1 ing as astonished as herself, ' I've just been up to the old piece, aud they told me you'd gone to Americky. I only got into ! the river last night, and was going back to the ship just now. Why didn't yoa leave , vonr address I Where are you off to now f ' ? ' Oh, only to your aunt's, at Homerton ; and yon must some along with us.' an swered the tremulous old lady, clutching his big broajHiand. as if she feared that her jest-found son would fiy off into vagce space again, if she didn't bold liitn tight. For the first time he noticed who was ?with his mother. All the eheeriness in stantly mushed from his face. He first gave a savage growl, and then a cold stare at the poor young creature, who trembled so, as she looked at him from under her eyelids, that the beads of her vulcanite bracelets tinkled. j ' Whatfs *fce doing here V he growled. 'Hnsb, hash;' the terrified mother; -wlnspered, at last remembering tnat sue , wasn't alone -with her son. ' Til tell yoa , all about it by-andby.' j By this time the hoary tower of old j Hackney Church rose on the left, and the j bain was pulling op for the station. Be- j fore it had stopped, the sailor rudely { pushed his way to the door, and almost i dragged his mother out after him on j to the platform. I handed out her j companion, who had been bo ronghly ' slighted, and then dropped behind, specn- j lating as to what it all might mean. A j suspicion flitted across my mind that per- ! haps the sailor might have good reason for I his anger ; bat one is slow to credit evil of j a graceful figure and a fascinating face, and I apt to side with their owner, whatever ap Tteaianees mar be against her. Mv nnsdincr fellow-traveller followed the two others at a distance down the station steps and up the street When they tamed into the * churchyard she stood for a second or two looking timidly after them, font again followed them. Her red-and-black shawl flitted over the white flagstones, and then was lost in the dimly gas- lit gloom, in „ which the white tombstones glimmered like ghosts. As I walked on through old fashioned Claptoa, meeting almost as few people in the peacemlly quiet streets as if it had been midnight, and watching the bright blotches of light in the great dim houses standing back in their dusky gardens — lights that told of happy family gather ings after the bnstiing day in the city — I amid not help thinking very regretfully of my poor little fellow-traveller, left out so cheerlessly in the dark. I could not help fchinVing of hex either, «s X went back to the station at night, and wondering whether X might chance to travel with her and the old lady again, and whether the sailor would be with them. I bad no time to look about me in the station however ; I was. late, and had to race up the steps to catch the hist train. At Dalstos, also, I had no time to spare, the Chalk Farm train was just about to start) land there was that general scamper up and down the stairs which makes changing tfrpSages there one of the longest «M most:wearisome stages of the journey. Bat when I had got out at Highbury, I saw the red-and-black shawl going up the steps before me. Neither the widow nor bet sob was there. The gas shone on my feUow-tEKveuVs face as she tamed to give op her ticket, and showed that her eyes were red and swollen with weeping. It ?was a most drear/, lonely-looking few. She seemed to recognise me as one who had witnessed the scene in the carriage, and harried out of the passage. I watched her run across the street, diving recklessly nader tin noses t-f the 'bos-horses Chat were being pulled up at the station- door; I :bsw. her turn the dark comer of the CMionbury-road; and thatisalllcanteU iof my. enigma. Bat I think I cannot be -wrong in fencying that I had had a mo mentary glimpse of one of the myriads of dark dramas that are being played out, ? 'with so little heed from any bat the actors, is fins hnge London, in which three millions of souls live, and move, and have their troublous being.
