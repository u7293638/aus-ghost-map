LAST LINES. Added by Percy Fairbank. Tried for the murder of Francis Raven, Joseph Rigoberfc was found not guilty, the papers of the assassinated man pre senting ample evidence of the deadly ani mosity felt towards him by his wife. The investigations pursued on the morning when the crime was committed showed that the murderess, after leaving the stable, had taken the footpath which led to the river. The river was dragged — without result. It remains doubtful to this day whether she died by drowning or not. The one thing certain is — that Alicia Warlock was never seen again. So — beginning in mystery, ending in mystery — the Dream- Woman passes from your view. Ghost ; demon ; or living human creature — say for yourselves which she is. Or, knowing what un fathomed wonders are around you, what unfathomed wonders are in you, let the wise words of the greatest of all poets be explanation enough — ' We axe such stuff As dreams are made of, and our little life Ib rounded with a sleep.' THE END.
