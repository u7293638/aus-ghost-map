Mr John Thomas South at the same time invited tendera for the erection ot a new theatre in Queen street, ior which a license was granted on the 20th ot May lu the month of August Mr. und Mrs Knowles arrived from Launceston, with some little llouriBh of trumpets, and th" 1th of Septem- ber, 184o, was rendered memorable by the lilac peí formalice in Melbourne of one of Shnkspeare'a plays The tragedy ot "Othello" was selected, and the pnncipil characters were thus allotted -lhe Moor, Knowles, lago, Bojd, Brabantio, Capper, Cásalo, an amateur, Rodengo, Howard , Desdemona, Mrs Knowles 1 milla, Mrs Arabin. Theatrical criticism 111 those dava was rough and ready, and the representative of Rodengo must have experienced a bad quarter ot an hour when ne took np the morning paper at breal fast time und read the following flattering references to himself -"Mr Howard made nn ass of himself, as usual He ought to be smothered if ever he attempts to appear upon the stage again " Unwilling to run the risk of Buch uti unplen siiut mode of death, and meekly acquiescing 111 the verdict of the imperious critic, Mr Howard, who appears to have been the proprietor of a rival journal, withdrew from the theatrical proleaston, and m t«ie words of Ins cuatigntor "cut the stage for ever." "Othello" waa plujcd on one even ing only, and a fortnight afterwards the management ventured upon '"Ihe Merchant of Venice, ' which waa therefore the firat ShakBpeunan comedy performed in Mel bourne. Mr Knowles sustained the character of Shj lock, Boyd waa Baasanto, Wilson Old Gobho, Winter Young Gobbo, Mra. Knowles was Portia, and Mrs Av ins-I believe tbc old ladj IB still among UB-was Jessica. There were no more bhakspearian performances that year, and the inierence is that they were not popular enough to he profitable to the manage ment Knowles seems to have been a very capable actor and an accomplished gentleman. He was the son of a Wesleyan clergyman in the old country, and emigrated, with a small capital, to Swan River in the year 1831 or 1832\. He lost all his money there, and repaired to Van Diemen's Land, where he supported himself by giving lessons in Greek , Latin, French, and drawing. In consequence of some untoward love affair he proceeded from Hobart to Sydney where he accepted an engagement in a theatrical company which was being organised by a Mr Barnett Levy.
