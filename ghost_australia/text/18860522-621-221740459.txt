OIIPOESyT5 TheForaken Farahom Against the wo >ded hills it stands » dead homestaring through Its brhktn lights on wasted lands WherS old Mine harvests grew. ' Unploughed, unsowo, by scythe unshorn The poor forsaken farm-fields lie, 1 Once rich and rife with golden corn And pal» green breadths of rye. Of healthful herb and flower bereft Toe garden plot no housewife keeps Through weed and ta. gle onlv left 1 The snake, its tenant, cr< epe. A lilac spray, once blossom clad, Sways bare before the empty rooms Besidejthe roofless porch a sad, ' Pathetic red rose blooms. His track, in mould of dust and drouth On floor and hearth the squirrel leaves, And in the firelees chimney's mouth His web the spider weaves. Tbe leaning barn about to fall Resounds no more on husking eves : No cattle low in yard or SLall, No thresher beats hie -heaves. So sad, so drear ! It seems almost Some haunting Presence makes its rign That down yon shadowy lane some ghost Might drive his spectral kine 1 J. G. Whittibr, in the ' Atlantic.'
