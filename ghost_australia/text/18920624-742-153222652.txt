SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. The well-known thoroughbred horse Co.umbus, by Smuggler from Alice Drew, by Athos, and » inner of tbe Australian Cup, V.R.C. Town Plate aud oth-r races, is to be sold by auction by Meagre. W. T. Bell and Co., at their yards to-morro *? (Saturday). ' The Tramp ' writes : — It was only tliis week that I had a good square look at tbe weights for the V.R.C. Grand National Hurdle and 8t«cplc, and I think the winner in the former race will come from Satyr ('.let 121b), Eilacd (n*t..';b), or Dillon (10etl2lb), and in the Steeple 1 like Busaco (I2st 1010); Freeman (12st 61b), and Beggar Boy (list 91b). No one, bar these in terested, would be more pleased than I would to see one of the Tasmanian trin win the big evenr; but to write honestly and candidly— aB a man should write if he writes at all — J do&'c think any one o / ihe three has the -ghost of a show. If Medicine is as good a horse as Maybe was, then he should have a big say in it ; but is he as good as Maybe ? Well, when he has met Busaco over the Flemington course we shall have had an opportunity of judging. Ouida is a fair mare, and Joe Powell will turn her out as fit as any of the Victorian trainers will their respective charges, but she is not fast enough. Wellington is a good horse, and the hopes of 7aemania must rest on him this time, but list 51b is too muoh for him. That wonder of wonders, Coral, the South Australian pony steeplechaser, has 31b less than him.
