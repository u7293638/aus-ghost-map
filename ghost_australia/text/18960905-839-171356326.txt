And ah able lot o' chaiks they was, too, although half on 'ein was pretty well three sheets' in ' the wind. But I knew well enough it wouldn't, be long afore the rotgut as they'd been takin' in would lose itseffect The sea air. plenty o' graft, an* -a dose; or two o* salts would soon set 'em on their pins. Woll, sir. while the towline \ya§ cpmin* in I noticed the Poriugee. a short, thick set little chap, with black ?vvh^sieijs, aji' a. pair o' earrin'gts in his ears, weajrln' a. yeller juniper an' canvas p.ants. He 'was hauliii* away all he knew, when his'hdutf ' happened to slip along the wet towr'ojje'; an' he goes back'ards againpt' the Spaniard, who was just astern of him. strikin' him with the back of hie head full on the mouth an' nose, an' tappm' the claret with the force o' the blow. It was a nasty bat. but quite accidental. The Spaniard starts a cursin' In Spanish, while all the men was laffin, an' the little Portugee laffs too. That was o.ver muci. for the Spaniard's temper, an' his knife was out in a minute. But I was too quick for him. I caught his knife hand by the wrist, an' stopped him from priekin' the Portugee. He struggled an' fought a bit. so the mate an! me claps a pair o' bracelets on .his wrists, an'- put him away safe till the captain nad time ?to a I tend to him. A day or two after, as he told the cap lain lie was very sorry an' wouldn't do the like again, he was set at liberty, and things jogged along comfortable, 'yeller jumper' and 11 im seemin' to 'ave cot iijned on all right siuce the rumpus. We'd light, fair winds an' line weather till about a week after leaving the laud, when one afternoon the wind chopped round to the sou'-west an' down went the glass. Before dark we snugged her down to upper topsails, foretopmast staysail, maiu staysail, and sntmker. The weather got worse, an' about six bells in the first watch the order come .-?.long. ' All hands shorten sail !' I soon, had the watch below up. an' it- wasn't long a fore we was up the riggin'.a.u' out along the yards handing the upper top sails. The night was pitch dark, with, heavy squalls of wind an* rain. We was noon on deck again, an' all fhe gear coiled up snug, an* the watch went be low. At S o'clock the next inornin', when the watch on deck was relieved, the little l'ortugee was missin'. Nobody didn't know anything about him. We' searched the ship fore an* aft. opened the door of the booby-hatch, and went all over the holds on top o' the cargo: \- lint not. a sign of him. He must a* gone overboard when we was shortenin' sail during the night, an* nobody missed him in the darkness. That was the way of it, as plain as a. pikestaff. A week after the captain sold his duds an' other be longin's by auction to the crew, 'and. he' was entered in the log as '' lost oveir Jboard.' ? ' From that day till we dropped anchor in Jlangoon Kiver there was iio more peace- or' comfort aboard the ship. She was JuMinted ! You're siuilin'. sir. Yon don't believe in ghosts' an' such like. No more olid I till then, but tseein's believin'. an* I've seen one. There's the captain— an edjicjWed, level-headed man with no nonsense a*K-ut him— he's seen the same.; But you win jtsk him about it yourself. I/»-i.'s* see.' where was I V' Oil. yes IvThe night of 'the. day his things was sold the ship wa* goin' along with square yards, before a. light breeze, juakin' about two or three knots an liour. The moon was nearly at the full an' the stars was sprinkled like a lot of diamonds over a cloudless sky. It was just one o' therii nights when a sailor feels a bit senti . .mental, an' starts to tliinkln' of his ?wife br; sister, or some one else * in the old home away. who; ' likely- enough, hasn't heard' from' liim for years, and inebbe liever- will. :- Well.1 it was in the middle watch, about ten. minutes after' midnight. The lookout ? man on the'foreeastle'utfadliad jnst be.eir relieved by a chap we called Scottie.

There, by fhe light o' the iiioon, he sees the little I'ortugee' standin' on the stay, his right arm round- the martingale, liis other hand liolilitfVbperi.'the breast of his yeller jumper, exposin' his hairy chest, with a homiiaudled knife~ buried to the hilt in 1 \vitb a yell that brought the watch \- ?*, \nUw tximblius out of tVslr bunks, \ ' » ' ' :-'?:.'?

The skipper laughed 'at tlie wh'bl6 thing, an' told him to keep riVovin' when on' the lookout, and not fall asleep an' scare nil hands with his silly dreams. But Scottie wouldn't have if. noliow.fbut what he'd seen the Portu gee' himself or his ghost. After that the lookout, generally had a chum with nim for. company. , Aijothjir-.J'prtijight passed, and the .work, of' the ship went on in the ordinary ,vyay.

Well,' sir, as 1 siiid;; ab'ottt a fortnight passed. :One' morning tlie cook turned out as usual at 4 o'clock, an' went to the galley toiliglit Ms tire an' get the coffee ready.

Now this was queer, to say the least of it for T remembefed that when I caught liis wrist the first day out- when lie tried, to' prick the Portugee.- his knife had a h6rn; .handle- to it. But that was far from proyiu' -as he had murdered his ship mate.

He said as held; los.t it overboard. while doin' some job aloft. . ' You see. bbVuh.' the captain sa.vs to' me after. ' you can't 'verji.-yell chargj; a man with murder, because two of the crew say they have seen a, ghost with a horn-handled knife iti its breast, and because another happened to own suclia' knife. I don't suppose we shall see or hear 'of tlie ghost again, so let the matter drop.'' ??- ? : ??'.- -????? But it was seen again. - . We rounded the Cape all right,' but not before the Portugee'sr giiost had been seen in different parts of; the. ship by the biggest part of the crew, the chief mate, among the nuinbe,r..,..Xow: Mr. Kich wasn't a man to be easily fooled at any-, thing, an' I don't believe, as he knew ,what fear was. The .men '-vere always talkin' among themselves ; about .'the' ghost, but if tlie iniite happ'eiied to hear one of 'eiri he'd call' 'ehi ''all the lubbers, old women, an' fools he could ]ay his tongue toJ But he saw it one night as lie told me himself. He was walkin' the weatlier side- o' the poop, -wheir lie saw it down to leeward. between thelanyards of the *two - foremost, .shrouds of -the; tiiizzeu rigglnV It had the knife stuck in its breast just as others, had seen it. Quick as a flash the mate sprang down to; -leeward, an' just as he was goin' .to grip holdo' the thing it vanished. in the;iiight -air*. ; ? '.-?.?';.? ' ' ;,. In the Bay of Bengal one of ..the ap; prentices \vas sent aloft one night to loose the inizzen-to'gallaii' sail. .He'd, loosed the sail and come; down' into the top. an' was ' lighting' up the clewlines while the' men was hoistin*1 the yard:' 'Suddenly lie gave a scream, an' fell to' the poop deck. It's a woiidpr he wasn't killed;1 'but fe got off with a broken leg. The Skipper had hiin carried to his own stateroom- an' set-- hisMeg'. 'When-'the ?little chap was able to-speak he told the; captain as ' he'd seen-the mau- in. the yello\v -jtimper in. the mizzen . top,' an' in his fright he leaped to. the deck. , Now- comes the rummiest part of my yarn, ah' it's near the' end. too. sir. We was 'off Diamond Island on Glrristmas 'Eve There was no ftm goin* on, an' no prospects of a merry ( Hiristmas, as every one wasscared of-his own shadder. an' loiigih' to get. into .port. There was hardly any- wind, an' tlie courses were hauled up. Four bells had just gone— ?10 o'clock-ran' I was talkiu' to the mate .on the fore end of the poop about. the work, when the captain conies up an* ?joins ua. He was looking worried an' vexed. 'An' no wonder! The Spaniard was on tlie lookout, an' we could see him plainly from where we stood. This set us talkin' about the 'ghost.' After awhile the mate says. ' Who's that going up the ladder on to the forecastle head ?' The captain an' me looks for'ard. The Kpanlard was leanin' against the cap stan with his face for'nrd an' his buck to us. Oreepln' up the ladder an' along the deck until he gets right behind the Spaniard, w« sew*, as plainly as I see you jioi'r, eij*, the&gnxe; at the Portugee ; ;T^e.,iknew him by his yellow jumper.. 'While we looked, hardly believin' our own eyes, the Spaniard turned round face to face with his visitor ! A hideous yell, a run an' a mad leap, an' he had plunged into the sea, over the ship's: bows, the ghost of the Portugee follow;-; Ing him. At the shout 'Mjiu oyer.^ board !' the ship was soon all alive. :The. mainyard was backed, an' the .quarter' boat wus out in. a jiffy. ? No, eir, we didn't pick him up, al though we searched about for. a. good hour, and then we hois.ted the boat up, trimmed the yards, an* stood on'. ''That1 was the last we saw of the little Pbrtti gee's ghost. That all V No, sir, not quite. The day we commenced dischargin' In Itangoon the coolies come tumblin' up' out o*. the afterhold in a deuce of a fright. They'd come across the dead body of a man covered over with about, a foot o' salt. When we went down there lay the little. Portugee in his yello-y jumper an' can vas pants, the Spaniard's h'orn-haiidled knife through life heart. Very much impressed' by the ' old bo'sun's yarn, but rather sceptical,' 1 took the first opportunity of sounding tlie captain. ''' ' ? ? ?''' '?'-'-?' 'l'Yi»f said he, 'the boatswain^' story : is .sqbStaritlally correct. ' '1 do*! not' pi^e-1 tend to acrcourit for It, but theappiirltioii actually did appear in the way described) : My owner, who is also the owner of the Hyacinth, knows the story, and has the knife hung up above his library mantel piece.
