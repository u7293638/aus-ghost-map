OOLONEL NORTH'S FULLERTON. Fcllebton, by Greentick — Bit of Fashion, has now proved himself incootestably the very best greyhound of all times, for he has now won the Waterloo Cup right ont three years in succession, and as a puppy he divided with his kennel companion, Tronghend. Three times out of four attempts did Master M'Grath prove successful, and since the Waterloo Cup has been for sixty-four dogs Fullerton and Master M'Grath have alone been successful tonce. And ruUerton has beaten &U; records by winning three and a half times. Truly he is the most wonderful dog that ever left slips, for he has only once during the four years of his running been beaten, and that was when be w&s; a puppy. This is certainly a wonderful performance, and, as « farther evidence of the value of tbe strain of blood produced by toe mating of Greentick with Bit of Fashion, we may mention that a youoger brother of Fullerton's, named Simonion, last year won the Waterloo Purse, his victor being his elder brother,, but only after a very tight tight between the pair, whilst this year Simonian was successful in tbe Plate. Harking back, we may remark that Colonel North, the Nitrate King, who owes Fullerton, purchased him as a puppy at auction, together with Tronghend, Fullerton's co-divider of that year. A coursing friend from England tells us that FullertoD is a really awkward dog in slips, and is constantly looking around at the slipper, as much as to say, " Why the d 1 don't you let me go ?" and byhis action several hares are lost ; but, when he is let go, although actually a slow dog from slips, then Fullerton gathers each p&ce; and smothers his hare so thoroughly that nothing has a ghost of a chance with him. The Dog of the Century.
