Tears , for the Toast List. The sub-comruittee met last niglit Tu make Hie first arrangement To shove the coming turkey light Ahead, of all estrangement ; But why — yes, why — was all the skilo Left to the oratorio might Of 1'reetradc men of fancy's llitrht, Which seems to show derangement. ?\Vhy should it wholly be in hands Of men. who trade with foreign lands. The toast list seems to be a roast For every ' health ' is handrd Unto freetraders who will most — Ly strive to have it stranded Upon the grave where Kucry's ghost Was lately put by Dibbs' on toutit And with its lost and fallen host ; Was buried deep and branded. O, why should ghosts get up and walk And talk of things we fain would baulk, . There's three who never would bo iniss'd, Who now will do the splutter, They now will on this little list, Spread out their freetrade butter. And get us all on toast to hist . Our whist, whilst they bring down their fist Opposed to things protection — ist, Kmphatie'ly on Suttor. O, why should they be manifest, And all our own good folks non cst. [Focus'em makes a mistake in the divine interest of rhymes, in saying that the whole of the toast list has been given to freetraders since Mr. James Eutherf ord and another have beeuincluded.Perhapsitis because Mr Ruther ford is a host in himself, that he has been considered a match for the other gentleman to ' propose' and 'support,' andall whom are, so Focus'em. hears freetraders to the very narrow of the backbone.]
