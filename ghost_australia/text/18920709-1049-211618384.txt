THE POISONING OF GIRLS. DEEMING OUT-DONE. The police have discovered some remarkable details as to the career of the man Thomas Neil, the American who is in custody with poisoning girls in London, and with attempting to extort blackmail from several gentlemen by writing and threatening to accuse them of the murders unless certain specific sums of money were paid to him. It has transpired that Neill's real name is Cream, and that he graduated as a physician at the Montreal University, Canada. It is alleged that after he obtained his degree he was found to be connected with the deaths with of two women caused by the performances of illegal operations. He was placed upon his trial for the wilful murder of these women but the evidence produced was insufficient to warrant a conviction and he was acquitted. In 1887 Neill, or Cream, was residing in Chicago, where he was charged and convicted of performing an illegal operation. On this occasion he was sentenced to imprisonment for life, but after serving ten years in gaol he was liberated, owing to ill health. Subse- quently he appeared at Ontaria, where he was forced into a marriage, but he abandoned his bride at the altar. ONE DOWN, ANOTHER COME UP. GHOST OF DEEMING (soliloquising): "Well, I thought I was a ripper, but this one takes the bun yet."
