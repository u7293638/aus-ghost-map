Definition. — (From Tail's Edinburgh Magazine.) — ?? We pity a man for being a Tory in these times. He is a poor creature that the march of events .lias left behind — a due* -legged drummer-boy who cannot keep up with his regi ment. He is * being- of a by-gone oge, singing an old song-r-telling a forgotten tale : his mind a hung with cob-webs ; he is the prelprpluferfect tense of politics; an extiacl from the lumb r room, where we have our ghosts, witches and alchy mists. American Conversation.— My visi tor was a milkman. ?? Well now so you be from the old counlrj ? Ay — you'll see sights here, I guess.''! hope I shall see many.' ?? That's a' fact. I expect your little place of an island 'don't grow such dreadful, fine corn us you sees here f' 'It ri&ws; no corn at all, sir;' 'Possible! no wonderLthen, that we reads such awful, stories in the pap'eis of your poor people being starved to death.' ' We have wheut, however.' *« Ay, foi you rich folks; but I calcu'are the poor seldom gets bellyful.' 'You have certainly much greater abundance here.' ?* I expect so. Why they do say, that if a poor body contrives to be smart enough to scrape together a few 'dbjflars, that your King George always comes down upon 'em and tukesit all away. Doii'Mn.?' ' I do not -remember hearing of such a transaction. 'I guess they be pretty close about it. Your papers ben't like ourn, I reckon ? Now; we says and prints just what likes. ' ' You spend a good deal of time in reading the newspapers.' 'And I'd like you to tell me, how we can spend it better. How Ehpu'd freemen spend Iheirtitne but looking after tbtir Govern ment, and watching that them fellers as we give offices to, doos their duty, and gives themselves no airs?' ' But I sometimes think, sir, that your fences might be in more thorough repair, and your roads in better order, if less time was spoilt in politics' ' The Lord! to see how little you knows of a free country! Whj, what's the smoo thness of a road, put against the freedom oi a free born American ? And what does a broken zig-zHy signify, comparable to knowing that the men vvlu.i we have been pleased lo send up to Congress speaks handsome and straight, as we chooses they should ?
