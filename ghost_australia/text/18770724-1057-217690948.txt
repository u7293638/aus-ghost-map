THE ENGLISH CHAMPION BOAT RACK. The race lictwccn Bovd and Higgins was rowed in tempests of wind and rain, and tho river was lashed luto angry roar, As Boyd was known to bo suffering from an attack of' boils, tlio betting was strongly in favor of 4 Higgins. A clear lead of two lengths was gained at the dtart by Boyd, who from that nfomcnt held tho race socure, Higgins not. having a ghost of .a chauco against him. Altogether it wns a hollow affair. Tho Daily 'JUegraph commenting on tho rnco says there wns a space of at least 200 yards between - tho men as Bnyd went under Barnes' Bridge ; nud tliat he could hnvu won by a tpuirter , of n mile Is undeniable, hnd he not judiciously slackened his poco; as it was Higgius, who showed nn utter inability to con tend with rough water,; was about 20 lengths behind at the finish. Boyd won in 28 minute 24 seconds, by Benson's chrono meter wutcli.' With the stakos of Â£400 und the scullers championship, Boyd also, took as a challenge trophy, tliohnndsomo eup given by tbe proprietors of a Newcastle jmper. It is very likely tluit Boyd or Itiackmnn will go to Australia ami there com/mtu with 'i'rlckutti who last Juue easily defeated Joseph Sadler for tho Thames championship, but declined beforo leaving England, to row with Wggina.
