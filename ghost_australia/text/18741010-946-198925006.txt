It was addressed to her: sister Ellen. Part of it ? ;ran tints :— -';Oh ) Ellen— I with ,you would tell ine.it mother and. father will let you come to Earlhani. Oh ! Ellen— Not for niy sake, but for Mrs Cotton's sake ; but as for me, I hope that I ' w6n't want no help from no one; all the help I want, it will'be froui God alone.'for when my time .comes on L will not trouble no one but God alone.; I -will leave myself to God. Oh ! .Ellen— Do come; if you can, Ellen — Mrs Cotton told me to tell you not to speak about the Bibles in any of your letters, for John Cotton is nearly mad. She told me'to tell' you not to say any more about it forhersake. She snid she had not told Him about the Bibles or the letters. OK! Ellen ?? — He isgrieved'for what ho has done, for he can see it all now ; he never sleeps one hour together. Mr Cotton says he is heart bro- . ken over it. she told me to tell you, that she could not tell you:herse!f, for he would read . her letters.' The ' deceased had been en gaged to be married to a. young man iiamed . J?red Hume, and- left with him to get married in June lust at Orford, but Mr Dobson re fused to marry them and they returneflto, ~Mr Cotton's^ She was taken in labor, at 1 o'clock on the morning: of Friday, the 18th September,- and' was attended by Mrs Arnold, MrCottoii,an(l MrFrancis Allison, who hap-' pened to be at Mr Cotton's pluco at. the time. Mr Cotton called Mr Allison upand; asked him to come and see her. She eon-; tinued in labor.until 5 o'clock, when she be came sleepy. Mr Cotton aiid Mr Allison, consulted, and decided to allow her to.sle-!p.( She remained in that state all clay and up:to 9 o'clock on Sunday morning, when she' complained again of pain. Evetilually the girl was delivered of a dead child, she lin gered to 7 o'clock on Saturday evening, when she died. A bottle was produced at. ' the huincst marked 'poison.' Seme of- it had been Kiven. as medicine to. the girl. Mr. Allison said it was a dangerous . medicine in , the hands of any one, .even in the hmuls qt\ medical men, as it was a deadly poison, but '. he concurred with Mr Cotton in giving some of it to the girl to ease her from the' severity of the pains. Mr Cotton had toltl Constable Connolly when she returned ? to - Earlham that he was greatly afraid sh pi would not get over her confinement. The' Coroner in summing ; up drew at ten'-', dangerous medicine by Mr Cotton,- and asked the jury to consider that had been given to procure abortion. Dr. Turner believed that, the girl died in consequence of severe labor caused by the child being dead. The jury delivered a verdict to that effect, and : added the following rider. 'The jury are, of opinion that Mr Cotton's conduct .in not: attempthifrto procure a medical man is highly reprehensible, as had there been one iii nM.en dance, in all probability the life of Mary' Connolly would have been saved.' When' the girl died Mrs Cotton went into hysteries and great indignation is expressed at Sorell against Mr Cotton for his extraordinary con duct throughout. The funeral P. of Mary' Connolly was the largest ever seen iii that part of the colony for some. time. It was attended by all the respectable people «s well as the funning population.
