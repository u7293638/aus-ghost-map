REV. JOHN OSBORNli. The Wesleyan District Meeting, specially convened to deal with the alleged Osborne horesy case, concluded its business on Friday by adopting the following resolutions : â€” 'That, after hearing Mr. Osborne's frank declaration ? if his belief in tho Deity of tho Lord Jeaus Christ, in his atonement for sin It v His death, in tho Deity of tho Holy Ghost, in tho plenary inspiration of tho Holy Scriptures, and in the efficacy of prayer, having heard also his declar ation of sincero attachment to Methodist doctrine gonerally as embodied iu our acknow ledged standards, we cordially accept Ilia statements as full and satisfactory. At the same time we regret that his method ol pre senting these truths is at times so inexact as to produce the impression on thu minds of some that- he is erroneous in doctrine. 2 Tn reference lo the sermon delivered in tho YorK.street Church on Sunday evening, April 22, 18S3, on Roman Catholicism, wt- are convinced that Mr. Osborne is sound iu the doctrines of Protestant ism as held by tho Methodist Church. Yet from the evidence we aro satisfied that in the former part, of his discourse he was so unguarded in his statements as to appear to advance docl,riues not in harmony with our standard. 3\. That tho president communicate the fore going resolutions to Mr. Osborne.'
