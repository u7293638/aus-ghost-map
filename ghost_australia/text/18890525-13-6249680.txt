THE UNEMPLOYED A REPLY. TO me in row of tiny ARGUS Sir,-I crave a little space in your valuable columns for the purpose of reply beg to the letter which appeared in your issue of yesterday over the worn tie plume at "Ballarat." It is pervaded by such an evidently india criminating animus against all classes of labourers, that its fallacious assertions will assuredly fail to produce the effect intended, at least as far as your well informed readers are concerned. "Ballarat' has not taken the trouble to quote our appeal correctly We did not ask: them, and do not ask now, for provisions, c for the unemployed as it body, but for thntBt'ition of them who are in actual need of the necessaries of life If "Ballarat" were many position for one day, and were compelled to listen to the harrowing titles of suffering poured into my ears, he too would concede that it is high time that something should be done to secure the wherewith to alleviate part, at least, of the physical suffering now being endured by a large number of our fellow-men and their families When he asserts that "it is positively known that there is plenty of work in that "1 Fiddler's Green" for the working man, the country, I will be excused it I assert just as positively that the facts in one possession are not in accordance with his assertion The only works the Government care to pass men to arc the railway construction works now proceeding in the neighbourhood of Mirboo, and as we have received information that Mirboo itself is swarming with idle men, and as we are almost daily informed that employ meat in that almost mare Billie locality is difficult attainment, it will cause no surprise when I state that I am unwilling to recommend men to leave town for Mirboo, but if with a knowledge of the facts they persist in their desert, 1 throw no obstacles in the way of their availing themselves of the pass is so kindly granted by the Govt ru- ment I As to the colony generally, we have already issued circulars, addressed to the principal city, town, borough, and shire councils out side the metropolitan area, for the purpose of ascertaining the exact condition of the labour market within their respective jurisdictions 'He replies (10) we have already received from widely separated localities in the colony (with a promptitude calling for our heartiest thanks are uniformly discouraging, and not such as would warrant us in hoping that the country is likely to absorb the unemployed labourers of this mitre police. As for the bulk of " Ballarat s " letter, it is unanswerable, because there is nothing dull ing for reply in the farrago of hymenal impertinence which constitutes the staple of Inn argument. Let me adv we "Ballarat" to cultivate the art of composition, so that he may be enabled to convey his thoughts to others in a style not calculated to cause the ghosts of burke and Swift in just indignation from their Hcuulchrea -1 tun As , W.
