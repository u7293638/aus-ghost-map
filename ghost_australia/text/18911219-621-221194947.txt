Th« Old Stage Coach. 'Ivsath the shed of a wayside inn it Stands, a -elic of by-gone days; GhosU of a buried past hide in it — Deadheads all. not a one that pays. Sba ies of the fares that once it carried Ere the da> s of the iron r als ; Spfc'rai forms of the knights who tarried, Arm. d to rifle defenceless mails. Broken now is the brake that grated On the wheels when the way was steep ; Gone are the steeds so closely mated, Nightmares now in the land of sleep. Lone en.ee gone is the skilful driver ; Sikut now is the guard's clear horn. Stands it there as a srle survivor, J Wrecked, dismantled, and all forlorn. Tews ago grown decayed and musty ; Frayed its trappings by winter's blast; Chains once bright, now with old age rusty, Link to-day to the days long past. Glistening once, now marred by scratches, Gone is the gloss it one time wore, While a hinge or a broken latch is All that remains now of a door. Many a long- forgotten story Told of scenes that it moved among, Many a plot of Whig and Tory Formed when the old stage coach was young. It hides away in silence jealous, Spite of the roof which is proue to leak ; Much of the past it well might tell as, If but its tongue could only speak. — Fbkd. H. Cubtis.
