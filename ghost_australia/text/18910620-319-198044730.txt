The other gathering referred to is the Tic toria Amateur Turf Club's Grand : National Steeplechase Meeting, whicli although. it takes, place in the 15th of August (a fortnight after the opening of the ensuing racing- y;flar) is essen tially a winter mcefciug, and, moreover, one of the very best of them. The Saving, Stakes/ of 100 sovs., for youngsters whose racing lives will then have been but of two weeks duratiop is (in consideration of that fact) over a distance of only three furlongs. The Hurdle Race, of 400 sovs., added to a sweepstakes of 5 sovs. each for starters, about two miles and a quarter, should comtnaud a great entry, included in which will doubtless be not only the winner at Flemington but numbers of those who have been disappointed by missing the mark at head quarters. Followirkg this comes the Selling Bace, of 156 sovs., seven furlongs, and then the all important event of the meeting, the Caul- field Grand National Steeplechase, of 1000s»;b., distanco about tour miles, which ever since its inauguration (and despite prognostications to the contrary), lias proved on unqualified bucccss and an immense annual draw. Too first horse rcoolves .700 sovs., second 200 sovs. and'third 100 sovs., conditions wliioh will doubtless again' induce a good 1 struggle' . for places.'

"When The Ghost won this race in 1883, there wero forty iiro starters, but at that time thero was nothing like the present amount of racing about Melbourne all the week through.

The, Mentone stewards met again on Monday: to consider the protest lodged against Bosebud .beingdeolared the winncroftheMarins Handicap, run at Mentone on the 26th ult. The grounds of the protest were that Rosebud had been des cribed as 5 years instead of as 6 years old. After further consideration the protest was upheld and the stakes awarded to Grey Girl, who ran second to Bosebud.

The owner of Spud, L. Abrahams, appealed against his own disqualification for the same period, and his appeal was allowed, the disqualification of Abrahams beiug accord ingly removed.
