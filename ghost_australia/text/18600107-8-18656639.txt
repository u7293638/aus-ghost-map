SYDNEY NEWS. ROCKHAMPTON. (From the Empire's Correspondent.) The Eagle, steamet, nrnv ed hero yesterday, with a full general cargo, and is now taking in a cargool wool She is to sail heneo on Monday 'Hie I mily liort not having arrived caused great anxiety in the town, as Captain lake, of the Uncle Tom, reported having seen her in a heavy gale. The news of her having returned to Syd ney, gave relief to many minds. The supposed loss of the Tom Tough is causing a sensation The blacks are not now troublesome, nor is it very likely they will be, as the native police officers are very vigilant. The shearing progresses very fast, many of the men have arrived within the last two or three days to spend their Christmas in town. The weather is very fine, with some rain that does much good. Altliou 'li we were aware separation was nbout taking place, we'did not know it had actually occnired, till tho arrival of the Eagle. It is now useless to regret it, but we of Kookliampton are, politically speaking, placed at a greater distance from the capital of the new colonv than we are from Sydney, as there is no communication be- tween this and Brisbane.

Braidwood-Tup Weatiiir and the Crops- On Monday last ram commenced in earnest in all parts of the district Tho storm which raged on that uttcrnoon had the cftoct of swelling tho Shoalhaven uiver to u fearful extent in a very short time, nnd to render it îm passablo, without great danger and difficulty , indeed, as related claowbere, one unfortunate young man lost his life in attempting to cross it, and the gentleman who was with lum had a very narrow oscape All through tho valley of tho Araluen, and down to the coast of Moruya, the ram fell in torrents. K10 diggers will non have what they have been so long and anxiously waiting for-a copious supply of water. Tho ram lins come too late to assist tho buy, which has alrcadv been mown 111 several places, but it will leuovate tho alter glass, and cause tlio winter foed in tho paddocks to ho more plentiful It will, however, do a deal of mischtet to the wheat at Moruya, where harvesting has begun in eirne.st, and where the shocks of wheat may bo seen standing in the fields awaiting dry weather to onable the farmers to carry tbcm to their barns.

This combination of troublos was too muoh for the poor wife's intellect to stand, nnd «lie became deranged In this condition, and taking with her the infant she had at tho breast, the poor woman wandered forth, a fortnight or three weeks ago-from a station known as Sim's Old Station, and now bolonging to Mr Macnamara, about 10 milos to tho west»aid ot Mr Burness' on tho Merool-into tho scrub, followed bv her dog After four or fiv 0 day s tho do,j returned alone, and when it had received something to ent, sot out again in the direction of the sorub Day al ter dav tho dog d id tho same, returning and setting out again at full speed as soon as he had been tod.

plan was not, under oxisting cir- cumstances, a desirable mode of effecting that pin poso Dr Bland moved tho first resolution "That, in the opinion of this meeting, it is essential to the political stability and social advnncement of tho colony that the advantages ot primary education should bo universally diffused Ho said that it vins useless foi ii country to possess a froo constitution whilst the people were nimble to understand its meaning Civil liberty was et( nndmg beforo them, nnd they ought to proparo themselves and their «luldren for its enjoy ment Adequate preparation bad not been made hitheito and without an increase in the funds devoted to educition, the country would rotio grodo rather than ndvnnco f ho bestwny to obtain these funds was by deriving them from a tax that would como imperceptibly from tho pockets of those who would be most benehted Such a schome ho looked upon as tem poiary, however for he bolievod that othor ways of raising tho money in a more legitimate mannor would be lound In tho meantime, nothing bottei occurred to lum thoy could not expect ministers to imposo a new tax amounting to £110 000 a year for the purposo of educ ition and there would be this advantage, that those who derived benefit would not bo in the position of piupors, but woul 1 feel that thoy were receiving b ick what they had themselves contributed in the form of a light tnx fho Kov Dr fullerton seconded tho rosolu tion Ho remarked that it was ii patent lact that not moie than one foui th of the community lind the moans of giving a proper education lo their children, and that the 1 ulk of the community had to depend upon the means provided by the State Ho therefore rejoiced ex- ceedingly at the thought that had occurred to one gon tletnnn, and had by lum boen so persevenngl» brought lorn ard, vi/ that it was the duty of the State to mnke education univeisal All must bo convinced of the ne- cessity of the universal diffusion of education, nnd minor differences of opinion ought not to prevent their uniting to secure that object Under the present sys- tem 34,000 childi en bottvecn the ages of lour und four- teen, were _iowmgup in utter ignorance He expressed bis approval of the plan of retaining the taxes on tea and sii0ur, and appiopnating them to tho purposes of education Mr Douglas moved, as an amondment, that the word "public' bo substituted for the word ' universal He maintained that the people acknowledged the neceasitv of education, and knev that they could not have it without submitting, to taxation But he contended against the imposition of a special tax for the purpose Ho held that the duties on tea and sugai were felt, and folt severely and that no tax for educational purposes could be moro just than a tav upon property, the protection of which was most cftcctuully promoted by the promotion of education The amendment was not seconded Mr Moriarty held that it was the duty of the State to see that all tho children in the colony were pioiierly educated So fur ho supported the resolution But lie argued that it was a roliogression m politics to propose the levying of a tax for a particulai purpobo All taxes should go to the general revenue, from which all necessary provi- sions for tho welfare of the people should be made The resolution was then put and carried unanimously Tho líe» foseph Bon/ley moved the second resolution "That in tho opinion of this meeting a large Lducation 1 und must bo provided to furnish tho means of successfully canning out such measures as will secure to the colony miners ii education ' He expressed the pleasure which be felt at seeing so much earnestness shown upon the sol jeet of education Tho principle upon which he con- cón ed Mr Jenkins bad based his scheme was a correct ono-tho principle of the inherent right of all to educa tiou He upprov ed of bis proposal to abolish school fees, the pa» mont of w bich under the presen t sy stem frequontly led to the detention of children from school for a week at a tinto when tho first day of the week was unfavourable Ho also approved of the schemo because it would tend to placo teachers in a better position The great benefits that bo anticipated from the establish- ment of a system of universal education «ero not the rise of mon of genius, but that the children of the colony when thov gi on to man's estate would bo enabled totako their pi ice as citizens, and exorcise their vote and mteiest on all public questions and that tho people everywhere would be furnished with such assistance as would onablo them to form correct opinions upon evcrv sut |cct I rought beloro thom fho Very Kov De m 0 Connell seconded the resolution Ho remarked upon the miserable vvav tn which teachers were paid in the colonv, and upon the dofcctivoness of tho present system of education °»\ lthout more primary schools the walls of tho Uuivorsifv -»nil the affiliated colleges would be desolate Ho agreed »vii li tho remark of tho last speaker about the ill elf cts of tho fee system It converted public schools into private onos, and led to diOerences in tho treatment of tho children Mr Jenkins s idea was a bold ono and though ho did not know whether » special tax oiiLht to bo applied to o special purpose this bo know, that if fees were abolished, and pirents could educate their children nt 2*>d porweol, this would bo a happy communitv Tho resolution was earned by acclamation Sir Alfred Stephen moved the third reso lution-" That in tho opinion of this meeting, the retention of tho toi and sugar duties would lie an oxcellent method to rinso the necessary funds, and that such duties, if dovotod exclusively to the promotion of education-thus rendering the payment of lees to jinmarv Bohools unnecessary-would be cheor lnlly paid by all classes of the community ' He repu- diated tho notion of his having como to impose Ins opinions upon others in any way as ono speaking by authority After some preliminary observations, and a quotation from the Edinburgh Review on the subject of the importanco of education as the foundation of tbo real sccuntv of n community, he proceeded to tho ques- tion of political economy involved in the resolution Ono great question to bo decided was whether tea and sugar wero luxuries or necessaries A previous speaker had mentioned tho ciso of ono family paying £5 a year in the taxes on thoso articles but on the supposition that the fimilv consisted of twelvo adults, tho amount per head would bo scarcely 8s per annum Mr Farkess cvlculation also gave 8s per hoad pot annum But in tint cilculntion the amount of sugai that was not con siimed, but was distilled into rum, was forgotten Ho quoted from M'Cullooli passages to some extent bearing upon the subicct, and then argued that if it woro main- tained that these duties should not bo paid in I'ugland, it did not therefore follow thnt they ought to bo reduced hore If their amount was only 8b per annum upon each adult, they were not likely to press heavily Moreover, those who paid them here possessed electoral privileges, whilst in England tho mass of the people had none He hold that these taxes were just and equitable, and, if applied to education, politic He grantod that it would bo letter ii tho legislntiiio would give ample funds for education not from particular taxes but ho hoped thev would not cast away the means of this magnificent education, when they had them ready to their hands in taxes from which they had not sufferod, and which would not be genorally felt Sir W M Manning seconde! tho motion Ho maintained that it was ot vital importance that tho education of tho country should keep pace with tho progress of political freedom and power He held that education should be universal, and also free To have it so, their funds must be large The present grant of £40 000 was miserably insufhoient Ile would ha»o education looked upon as tho primary thing, and the police 09 comparatively sooondary Ho approved of tho proposition of Mr Jenkins, on various grounds If, when the legislature gavo only £40,000 for educition, it »ins di (boult to reponl thoso duties, tho voting £110,000 would qutto piovont then ropenl fhero «»oro nlieady district taxos for spooiol purposes and in America there was n spool »1 tn\ on lund He did not approve of a ohss tax for education As the education should
