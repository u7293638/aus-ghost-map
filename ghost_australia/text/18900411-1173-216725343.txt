An Ocean Tragedy. BY W. CLARK RUSSELL. CHAPTER XXYL VILFBID'S DELUSION. _ • IT was pleasant to learn next morning that the breeze which had been dipping; Ufa nimbly through it since ire had. trimmed sail for oar homeward-bound ran had not only blown steadily all night, giving us an average of some seven knots an hoar, but had gathered a little increase of weight *t.sunrise, so that I awoke to as much life in the Vessel in the resonant bumming from aloft, the cjciick wash and eager seething of recoilr ing seas, the straining noises -of strong fastenings to the sloping of the Apars as though the north-east trades were pouring lull upon the starboard bow and we were buzzing through the cool At.hmtfr parallels within a distance of soundings that would lender talk about Southampton «qd arriving home reasonable. Tor my part ever since we had penetrated these "doldrums," as they are called, I was'dreading the long dead calms of the frizzling belt where a catspaw is hailed in Gotrs name and where the roasting eye of the sun sucks out the very blue of the atmosphere till the heavens go down in a brassy [ dazzle to the ocean confines as.though . one were shut up in a huge, burnishied bell with a white-hot clapper for light. spirits were good as I sprang out -of- my bunk and made for the/lnt|irxoom. It was not only that the fresh wind whistling hot through tlw open scuttle of my berth caused nie'to think of'ltome as lying at last fairly over the bow instead of over the stein & it had been for. weeks ; the object of this trip, such.asit was, had been achieved; there was nothing more to keep ' a look-out for; nothing more to hold one's expectations tautened.to cracking point. Everything thatwas material had happened on the preceding morning, and the toss of the colonel's body last night over the gangway by lantern light with Lady Monson looking on was like the drop of the blackcurtain: it was the end of Qie tragedy ; the orchestra - had filed out, the lights were extinguished, and we couldnow pass intoheaven's iimgorating air . and live again the oM easy life of commonplaces. So ran my thoughts asl emerged from my berth with a 'very good appetite and maftemy wayto the sparkling breakfasttable. I aeated myself on a couch wait- ing for Wilfrid and MIBS Laura; the stewards hung about ready to serve -the meaL • I called thehead one to me and said,Is there any chance of Lady Monson joining us at table,, do you know ?" , £ think not, sir," ie answered. Who attends to her—J mean as regards hermeals?" . V Miss Jennings 7 maid, sir. She told me this morning her ladyships'* orders are that a seperate tray should be propped for her for breakfast, lunch and; dinner. Her breakfast was taken to her about ten minutes ago." "So I may presume," said I, " that she finds herself pretty well this morning? Andmycousin, steward?" " Iwas to tellyou, sir," he answered, "that. Sir Wilfrid will not come to table." "How is he?" "He didn't complain, sir; just said " I'll breakfast in my cabin tins mornmg!" "All right," said I,And the man retired. There was nothing unusual in Wilfrid breakfasting in his cabin. I was glad to hear that he did not complain; as a rule he was very candid if in suffering; owned ireely to whatever troubled him, however trifling, and made much of it. In a few minutes Miss Laura came from her berth. Her face had the" delicacy of look that in her at all events I took to express a troubled or sleepless night. Her eyelids were a little heavy; her lips wanted their dewy freshness of hue. Yet no woman, I thought, could ever show sweeter than she as she advanced and took my hand smiling up at' me and subtly incensing the atmosphere with a flower-like fragrance that had nothing whatever to do with the scent bottle. I told her that Wilfrid would not breakfast with us and we seated ourselves. "Heiswell, I hope?" "Oh, I should think so, if I may judge from, what the steward tells me. Til look in upon him after breakfast. Have you seen Lady Moiuon this morning?" " No," she answered,,*' Isent my maid with a message and the reply was that Lady Monson wishes to be alone." "Now, Miss Jennings," said I gently but with-some emphasis, "you "must let nothing -that Lady Momon does vex you. You have done your duty; she is on board this yacht; I shall grow fretful if I think you intend to waste a single breath of the sweetness of your heart upon the arid air of Madam Henrietta's desert nature. I dare.say you have scarcely closed your eyes all night through thinking abouther." "Abouther and other things." "Why tease yourself? A sister is a sister only so long as die chooses to act and feel as one. It is indeed a tender word—a sweet relationship. But if a womancooHy cutsallfamily ties—" She shook her head, smiling. " Your views are too hard, Mr. Monson. You would *xgue of a aster as you would of a wife. Wemust bear with the shame, the degradation,the wickedness of those we nave loved, of those we still love spite of bitter repulse. There is no one, I am . sure, woulddarekneel.downinprayer if it was believed that God's mercy depended upon our own actions. All of us would feel cut .off," \- Not all, I thought, looking at her, but sat silent awhile, feeling rebuked? I was a young man then; J can turn back now, scarred as I am by many, years of life's warfare, and see that I was hard, too hard in those thoughtless days of mine * that knowing little or nothing of suffering myself, I knew little or nothing of the deep and wondrous vitality of human sympathy. You find many corridors in human mature when you enter, but sympathy is the only way in; and to miss that door is merely to go on walking round the edifice. I ate for a little in silence, a&d; then said, " I .suppose, as you have seen almost nothing of your sister, you are unable to form an opinion of her state of mind?" "She is naturally of a cold nature," Ene answered; "dispositions such La hers, 1 think, do not greatly vary, let what will happen to them. Though one knows not wluit passion, feeling, emotion may hive its fangs buried in such hearts yet suffering has to pass through too many wraps to find expression." j smiled. "Yes," said I, "I know what you mean. . She is like a person who $68 buried in half-a-dozen coffins; a shell, then lead then oak, and so on. Nothing but the last trumpet could influence the ashes inside." " But why did you ask that question, Mr. Monson?" "Well." said I, "you know that we buried the colonel last night ? " She started. " I did not know !" she exclaimed. "Yes," I continued. "We slung couple of lanterns, and Finn read the service. Just before the body was launched your sister arrived, rising like a ghost amongst us." Sh^ looked greatly shocked. "Was Henrietta really present ? " she exclaimed. " How could she have known—what could the .men have thought of her ? What madness of bad taste 1" "Tie forefinger follows the thumb," said I, " and when you come to the little finger you must begin again. All's one with some people when they make a start. Am I too hard on human nature in savins this?" But she merely exclaimed, as though to herself, "How could she be present? How could she be present ? " " Well, now, mark what follows, Miss Jennings," said I;" when the body had vanished, your sister walked right aft, kneeled upon the. gristing, and in that posture of supplication continued to watch the. dark waters for upwards of ten minutes. Meanwhile I was gazing at her from the gangway, where I stood in the dusk fidgeting exceedingly. For what was in my mind? Suppose she should fling herself overboard!" Her violet eyes rested thoughtfully upon my face. " I should not have been afraid," she exclaimed with a faint touch of scorn which made wonderfully sapid her voice that was low and colourless. '' Of course you know your own sister," said L " Finn took your'view. I mentioned my misgiving, and his long head waggled most prosaically in the, moonlight." "Women who behave as my sister has, Mr. _ Monson," she exclaimed, with the gravity of a young philosopher, " are too selfish, too cowardly, too much in love with themselves and with life to act as you seem to fear my sister might. They pay go mad, and then, to be sure, there is an end .of all reasoning about them; but whilst they have their senses they may be trusted so far as they themselves are ^concerned. In perfectly sane people many noble . qualities go to impulses or resolutions which are deemed rash and impious by persons who falter overthe mere telling of such deeds. My sister has not a single noble quality in her. She may poison the lives of others, but she will "be extremely careful to preserve her own." Now if I had said that—" said I. Oh," she answered, ;with the little colour that had come into her cheeks fading out of them, " 1 Will never reproach you for teUing the truth. " After ; breakfast I went to Wilfrid's cabin, and found him up and dreBsed, sitting in an easy-chair, reading bis diary, which I took the book to be. He held the volume close to his face; Us legs were crossed, his feet in slippers, his right hand grasped his. big meerschaum pipe, which was filled .with yellow tobacco not yet lighted. The cabin window was open, and the draperies of the handsome little apartment stirred to the pouring of the rich, hot, ocean breeze through the orifice. • "Youlook vastly comfortable, Wilf," said I. "Glad to find you well. But.it must be a bit dull here though ? " - "Not at all, "said he, putting down the book and lighting his pipe. "Sit and smoke with me." " Why not on deck ? " I answered, sitting nevertheless. " A wide view in hot weat&er; takes the place of a < cool atmosphere. The sight is sensible of the heat as well as other organs. It may be cooler down here in reality than it is under the awning, above, but these cribbed and coffined bulkheads make it very hot to the eye spite of that pleasant gushing of wind there." He quietly sucked at his pipe, looking at me through the wreaths of tobacco smoke which went up from his bowl. I lighted a cigar, furtively observing his face as I did so. He was pale; there was nothing novel in that, but I noticed an expression of anxiety in his eyes that was new to inB; a look of sane concern as though some difficulty novel and surprising, yet not of a character to/strike deep, had befallen him. I glanced at the breakfast tray that was upon the table near which he was seated, and easily guessed by what remained that he had made a good meal. His manner was quiet, even subdued ; no symptoms of the old jerkiness, of the odd probing gestures of head with a thrust of his mind, as it were, into one's face as if his intellect were as short-sighted as his eyes. He was airily clothed in white, a coloured shirt wide open at the collar, and a small silk cap of a jockey pattern was perched upon his head. "Has Finn removed the five-guinea piece from the mainmast ? " said he. "I don't know, Wilf." "I must send word to him to take charge of it, and to tell the men that the money will be distributed among them on our arrival. I shall be glad to get home." " And so shall I, upon my word." "The ceaseless motion of the sea," he continued, talking' quietly -and with a more sensible look in his face than I had witnessed in him since the hour of our start, "grows sodistractinglymonotonous aftera tame, that I can readily believe it affects weak heads. This trip has about exhausted my love of seafaring. I «T»a.ll sell the Bride. I nodded. "How long should the run home occupy us ? " he asked.. " Let us call it a month, or five weeks at the outside, for everybody's sake," I answered. He smoked for a minute in silence with a thoughtful face and then said, "Five weeks in one's cabin is a long imprisonmnent." I imagined he referred to his wife, and that he was feeling his way in this roundabout fashion to talk about her." '' There is no necessity to be imprisoned for five weeks," said I. "Your yacht is not an ocean liner full of passengers whose stares and whispers might indeed prove embarrassing. So far as I am concerned I am quite willing to promise very honestly never even to look. Miss Jennings is all tenderness and sweetness and sympathy; there could be nothing to found a plea for seclusion upon in her presence. As to the sailors," I continued, noticing without comprehending an air of bewilderment that was growing upon his face as I talked, "Jack meets with so many astonishments in his vocation that surprise and curiosity are almost lost arts with hiny The crew will take one long thirsty stare; then turn their quids and give what passes aft no further need whatever." "Idon't follow you," he exclaimed, posing his pipe, with his' eyes intently fixed on me; "what are you talking about?." ^ " You were speaking of the tediousness of a five weeks' imprisonment! " " Quite right," said be, " and tedious it is if it's to last five weeks." ''But, my dear Wilfrid, I was endeavouring to point out that the imprisonment to which you refer is unnecessary; in fact, after last night—" But here I suddenly bit my lip to the perception that it would be rash and unwise on my part to let him know that his wife had been present at Colonel Hope-Kennedy's burial. "What I mean is," I continued, talking rapidly, "if it's a mere question of sensitiveness or pride recoiling from observation, why not imitate the great Mokanna: "O'erbie features hung The Yen, the Silver Veil -which he had flung Tn mercy there to hide from human sight His derating brow till men could bear its light." In our case we have no dazzling brow and consequently require no silver veils ; but in Miss Laura's wardrobe there should be—" He was now gaping at me, and cried oat, "Your brain wanders this morning, Charles. Do you- mean that J should go veiled?" "You ! " I exclaimed ; "certainly not. I am not feJlring of you." " But I am talking of myself, though," he cried. I looked at him with amazement. '' You do not mean to Bay that you intend to imprison yourself in this cabin till we get home?" He shook his head. " I don't imprison myself,"heanswered, "I am imprisoned." " By whom, pray ? " " Can't you see ? " I ran my eyes round the cabin. " No, no! " he shouted, " look at me. Don't you perceive that I can't get out ? How am I to pass through that door ? " "How are you to pass through that door?" I exclaimed, "why, by walking, through it, of course. How else ? " Ay, and that's just what I can't do," said he, with a melancholy shake of the head. But why not, Wilfrid?" I cried, scarcely yet understanding how it was with him. Because," he answered, petulantly, looking down himself, then at his arms and legs, "I aia too big." I perceived now what had come to him, and felt so dismayed, so grieved, so pained, I may say, to the very heart, that for some moments I was unable, to speak.' However, with a violent effort I pulled myself together, and lighting my cigar afresh in a demonstrative way, for the mere sake of obtaining what concealment I could get out of my gestures and my puffing of the tobacco clouds, I said, "Big you always were, Wilfrid; but never so big—and not now so big—as not to be able to pass through that door. See ! let me go first put your two hands just above my hips and you'll follow me through as easily as reeving a rope's end through the sheave hole it belongs to." I rose, but he waved me off with an almost frantic gesture. " My God, man !" he shonted, " what is the use of talking ? I could no more get through that door than I could pass through that porthole. "But don't you think we might manage to hard you through?" said I. " You'd tear me to pieces," he answered. Sit down, my dearfellow,"he continued, speaking with an almost cheerful note in his voice, "itisaverygrave inconvenience, but it must be met. This cabin is commodious, and with you and Laura to come and keep me company, and with the further solace of my pipe and books, why I shall be very nearly as well off as if I could get on deck. Besides," he added, lifting his finger and addressing me with that old air of cunning I have again and again referred to, made boyish and pathetic by the quivering of his eyelids and the knowing look his mouth pus on," even if I was not too much swelled to pass through that door," he glanced at it as if it were a living thing that demanded respectful speech from him, " I should never be able to get through the companion hatch." "Well," said I, "it, no doubt, is as you say. A little patience and you wiH find yourself equal, I am sure, to leaving your cabin. If not, and you fear the idea of a squeeze, there is always your carpenter at hand. A few blows dealt at yonder bulkhead would make room for an elephant." • Ay, that would be all very well," said he,'•" so fat as this cabin is concerned. But would you have me order the carpenter to rip up the deck with leagues of Atlantic weather rightahead of us*?" I feigned to agree. No useful result could possibly follow any sort of reasoning with him whilst this extraordinary fancy possessed his brain. I watched Hm attentively to remark if he moved or acted as if his hallucination involved physical conditions, as if in short he was sensible of the weight and unwieldiness of excessive growth in his body and limbs: for I remembered the case of a man I once heard of, who, believing himself to have grown enormously corpulent in a single night, acted the part of an immensely fat man by breathing pursily and with labour, by grasping his stomach as though it stood out a considerable distance ahead of him, and by other samples of behaviour which in his madness he might imagine properly belonged to the obese. But I could detect no conduct of this sort in Wilfrid outside that inspection of himself which 1 mentioned when he first told me that he had grown too big to -quit his cabin. 1 changed the subject and sat talking with him for a long half-hour. He asked no questions about his wife, nor as to the disposal of the colonel's bedy, nor reverted to the extent of the faintest implication to the incidents of the preceding day. Yet he conversed with perfect rationality; his manners were bland, with something of dignity in them; it seemed indeed as if the poor fellow's craziness had localised itself in this new and astounding fancy of his being unable to squeeze liis way through on deck, leaving his mind in all other directions clear and serene; yet mad as was the notion that had now seized him, I' could not but secretly feel that there was more madness yet in his insensibility to what had happened, as though indeed the light of memory in him had been extinguished and he was conscious of nothing but what was actually passing before his eyes. I held my peace on this new and astonishing craze, fancying that at any hour I might find him on deck and his delusion gone. At dinner, however, that day Miss Laura noticed his absence. My silence, I suppose, convinced her that there was something wrong with him. She questioned me and I told her the truth. Her cj es filled with sadness. " He grows worse," she said. " I fear he will never recover." "This marriage," I answered, "on top of what was congenital in liim, Las proved too much. Have you seen your sister to-day ? " "No." "Does she intend to keep her cabin until we reach England 1" "I cannot say. She declines to see me." ' Yet she has turned you out of your berth, and does not scruple, I suppose, to use everything that you possess. Well, we are a queer little ship, I must say the husband self-imprisoned by fancy on one side, and a wife self-imprisoned by heaven knows what emotions on the other side ; and both doors within kick of a foot from either threshold. It iB picture to encourage an ingenious mind fired with matrimonial resolutions 1" " Men are fools to get married!" she exclaimed piquantly. " And women ? " said I. "Oh, it is the business of women to make men fools," she answered. Her clear eye rested serenely on mine, and she spoke without archness or sarcasm. " I don't think," said 1, "that women make fools of men, but that it is men who make fools of themselves. Yet this _ vow before all the gods: if I had married^ a woman like your sister and she had served me as she has served her husband, I should wish to be mad as Wilfrid is. He does not ask after her, seems to have utterly forgotten her and the fellow who was seht„to his rest yesterday. Oh,*how delightful! Why you hear of women like Lady Monson driving their spouses into hideous courses of life, forcing them to search for oblivion in drink, gambling, and so on, until they end as penniless miscreants, as broken-down purple-nosed rogues, and all for love, forsooth! But how is Wilfrid served ? Some wild-eyed imagination slips into his brain, turns all the paintings to the wall, and with nimble hands falls to work to garnish the galleries inside his skull with tapestry hangings which engage his mind to the forgetting of all things else." ' ' "But, Mr. Monson," cried die, "surely with some little trouble one might succeed in persuading him, whilst feigning to admit he has increased in size, that he is not too big to pass through his door. " Let us pay him a visit," said L She at once rose. We had finished dinner some time. I had been chatting with her over such slender dessert as a yacht's stores in those days supplied—figs, nuta, raisins, biscuits, and the like. The westering sun coloured the cabin with a ruby atmosphere amid which tie wines on the table glowed in rich contrast with the snow-white damask and the icy sparkle of crystal, whilst red stars trembled in the silver lamps, with a soft crimson lustre flaking, as it seemed, upon the eye out of the mirrors. The humming wind gushed pleasantly through the open skylight arid down the hatchway, and set the leaves of the plants dancing and the ferns gracefully nodding. To think of the woman for whom all this show was designed, for whom all these elegancies were .heaped together, the mistress, indeed, of the gallant and beautiful little fabric that was bearing us with a pretty sauciness over this sea of sapphire and under this reddening equinootial heaven, sulking in her cabin, a disgraced, a degraded, a socially ruined creature, imprisoned by her own hand, and pride acting the part of turnkey to her 2 But Miss Jennings was ma-Ving her way to Wilfrid's, cabin, and there was no leisure now for moralising. We entered. The remains of the dinner my cousin had been served with were still upon his table, and I gathered that he had done exceedingly well. This did not look as though he suspected that eating had anything to do with his sudden astonishing growth. He had emptied one pint bottle of champagne, and another about a quarter full stood at his elbow with a bumper just poured out, apparently, alongside it. He had attired himself in dress clothes again, and sat with an air of state arid dignity in his arm- chair, toying with a large cigar not yet lighted. "How d'ye do, Laura, my dear? Sit down. Sit, Charles. There is plenty of room for slender people like you." I placed a chair for Miss Jennings and vaulted into Wilfrid's bunk, for though the cabin was roomy in proportion to the burthen of the yacht, the accommodation was by no 'means ample, owing to the furniture that crowded the deck. His high cheek bones were flushed, a sort of glassiness coated his eyes, but this I readily ascribed to the champagne; the interior was hot, and Miss Laura cooled her sweet face with a black fan that hung at her waist. My cousin watched her uneasily, as if he feared she would see something in him to divert her. Do you feel now, Wilfrid," said I," as if you could get on deck ? " Oh, certainly not," he answered warmly, " I wonder that you should ask such a question. Compare my figure with that door." He looked at Miss Laura with a shrug of his shoulders as though he pitied me. "Surely, Wilfrid," she exclaimed, you could pass through quite easily, and without hurting yourself at all." "Quite easily! Yes, in pieces! "he cried scornfully. " But it is not that you are both blind. Your wish is to humour me. Please do nothing of the sort. What I can see, you can see. Look at this bulk." He put down his cigar to grasp his breast with both hands. "Look at theBe," he continued, slapping first an arm, then a leg. "It is a most fortunate thing that I should have broadened only. Had I increased correspondingly in height, I should not have been able to stand upright in this cabin," and he directed a glance at the upper deck or ceiling, whilst a shiver ran through him. I thought now I would sound his mind in fresh directions, for though whilst his present craze hung strong in bjm it was not likely he would quit his cabin, yet if his intellect had failed in other ways to the extent I found in this particular hallucination he would certainly have to be watched, not for his own security only, but for that of all others on board. Why, as you may suppose, his craziness took the wildest and most tragic accentuation when one . thought of where one was—in the very heart of the vast Atlantic, a goodly company of us on board, a little ship that was as easily to be made a bonfire of as an empty tar barrel, with gunpowder enough stowed somewhere away down forward to complete in a jiffy the work that, the flames might be dallying with. You do not inquire after Lady Monson, Wilfrid," said I. Miss Jennings started and stared at me. " Why should I ?•" he answered coldly and deliberately, producing his little tinder box, at which he began to chip. " I'll venture to say she doesn't inquire after me." I was astonished by the rationality of this answer and the air of intelligence that accompanied its deliveiy. " No, I fear not," said I, much embarrassed. " As she only came on board yesterday—" " Well ?" he exclaimed, finding that I paused. Oh," said I with a bit of a stammer, " It just occurred to me you might have forgotten that she was now one of us, journeying home." " Tut, tut!" said he,- waving his hand at me .butwithout turning his head. "Laura, you are looking after her, my dear? " "My maid sees that she has all she 1 requires," answered the girL' " She de clinesto have anything to say to me—to meet me—to hear of me. " He nodded his head slowly and gravely at ler, and lowering his voice said, " Can shfthear us, do you think ?" "No," I exclaimed, "not through the two (bulkheads with, the width of passage between." He smoked leisurely whilst he kept his eyeSj thoughtfully bent on Miss Laura. " My cousin," said he, addressing her as though I were absent, " has on more than one occasion said to me, - ' Suppose you recover your wife what are you going to do with her ? * I have recovered her and now; I will tell you my intentions, Laura, you know I adored her." She in clined her head. "What term would youiapply to a woraan," he proceeded, " who should abandon a devoted husband that worshipped the ground she walked upon ? who should desert the sweetest little infant 1 '—I thought his voice would falter here, but it was as steady as the fixed regard of his eyes—" that ever came from heaven to fill a mother's heart with love'? who should forfeit a position of distinction and opulence—who should stealthily creep like a thief in the night from a home of beauty, of elegance, and of splendour; who should do all this for an end-of such depravity that it must-be nameless? " his forefinger shot up with a jerk and his eyes glowed under the trembling of the lids. "What is the term you would apply to such a woman? " he continued, now scowling and with an imperious note in his voice. I guessed the word that was in his mind and tried, "Why, 'uiad of course." , "Mad !" he thundered violently, slapping his knee and breaking into a short, semi-delirious laugh. He leaned forward as though he would take Miss Laura into his strictest confidence, and putting his hand to the side of his moutbhewhispered, "She is mad. We none of us knew it, Laura. My first act then when we reach home will be" to confine her. But not a word, mind !" He held his finger to his lira, and in that posture slowly leaned back in his chair again with a face painful with its smile of winning and triumph, -I saw that the girl was getting scared ; BO without ado I dropped out of the bunk oii to my feet. "An excellent scheme, Wilfrid," said I, " in fact the only thing to be done. But my dear fellow, d'ye know the atmosphere here is just roasting. I'll take Miss Jennings on deck for a turn, and when I am coioled down a bit I'll look in upon •you for another yarn for half-an-hour before turning in," "All right," he exclaimed. "Laura looks as if she wants some fresh' air. Send one of the stewards to me, will you, as yQU pass through the cabin ? But mind, both of you—hush! Not a word, you understand?" Trust us," said I, and sick.at heart I took Miss Laura's hand and led her out of the cabin. As I closed the door she reeled and would have fallen but for the arm I passed round her. I conducted her to a couch and procured a glass of water. This atmosphere here was comparatively cool with the evening air breezing down through the wide skylight, and she quickly recovered. It is terrible !" she exclaimed, pressing -her fingers to her eyes and shaking her head. VI should fall crazy myself Were J much With him. TTia sneers, his smiles, his looks, the boyish air of his face, too! The thought of his misery, his injury, the irreparable wrong done him—poor , Wilf, poor Wilf! " Her tender. heart gave way and she wept piteously. When she was somewhat composed she fetched. a hat and accompanied me on deck. The dusk down to the horizon was dear and fine, richly spangled to where the hard black line of the ocean ruled the firmament. On high sailed many meteors like flying fish sparkling out of the dark velvet; some of them scoring under the trembling constellations a silver wake that lingered long on the eye and resembled a length of moon-coloured steam slowly settling away before the breath of a soft air. There were many shooting stars, too, without the comet-like grace of the meteoric flights; sharp, bounding sparkles that made one think of the flashing of muskets levelled at the ocean by visionary bands in the hovering star-laden gloom. The wind was failing; the yacht was sailing with erect masts with a rhythmic swinging of the hollows of her canvas to the light weather rolls of the vessel on the tender undulations. It was like the regular breathing of each great white breast. The dew was heavy and cooled the draught as a fountain the atmosphere round about it. A little sleepy noise of purring froth came from the bows. AIT was hushed along the decks, though as the yacht lifted forward I could make out some figures pacing the forecastle apparently with naked feet, for no footfall reached the ear. Alas," said I, the wind is failing. I dread the stagnation of these waters. I have heard of ships lying becalmed here for two and three months at a stretch ; in all those hideous days of frying suns and steaming nights scarce traversing twenty "We were becalmed a fortnight on the Line," said Miss Laura, "on our passage to England. It seemed a year. Everybody grew quarrelsome, and I believe there was a mutiny amongst the crew." "Oh, I hate the dead calm at sea!" I cried. " Yet I fear we are booked. Look straight up, Miss Jennings, you will behold a veiy storm of shooting stars. When I was in these waters, but much more West and east than where we now are, I took notice that whenever the sky shed meteors in any abundance a calm followed, and the duration of the stagnant time was in proportion to the abundance of the silver discharge. But who is that standing aft by the wheel there ? " ^My question was heard and answered, "it's me—Capt'n Finn, sir." " We're in for a calm, I fear, Finn." "I fear so, sir," he answered, slowly coming over to us. " Great pity, though. I was calculating upon the little breeze today lasting to draw us out of this here belt. Them shooting stars, too, ain't wholesome. Some says they signifies wind, and so they may to the norrards, but not down here. Beg pardon, Mr. Monson, but how is Sir Wilfrid, sir? Han't seen him on deck all day. I hope his honour's pretty well ? " "Come this way, Finn," said I. The three of us stepped to the weather rail, somewhat forward, clear of the ears of the helmsman. Captain," said I, " my cousin's very bad, and I desire to talk to you about him." Sorry to hear it, sir," he answered, in a voice of concern ; " the heat's atrying him, may be." " He refuses to leave his cabin," said I, and why, think you ? Because be has got it.into his head that he has grown too broad;to pass tljrough the door, or^even to squeeze through that hatch,there." . " Gor bless me !" he exclaimed, " what a notion to take on. And yet it ain't the i first time I've heard of sach whims, was once shipmate with a man who believed his nose to be a knife. I've seen him atrying to cut up tobacco with it. There's "no arguing with people when they gets them tempers." " But don't you think, Captain Finn," said Miss Jennings, "that with some trouble Sir Wilfrid might be coaxed into coming on deck ? If he could be induced to pass through his door he would find the hatch easy. Then, when on deck, confidence would return to him and his crazy notion leave him." "Won't he make the heffort, miss? inquired Finn. I answered "No. He says that it would tear him to pieces to be dragged through." "Then, sir," exclaimed the skipper with energy, "if he says it you may depend upon it he believes it, sir, and if he believes it then I dora't doubt that physical force by way of getting him out of his cabin would be the most dangerous thing that could be tried. It's all the narves, sir. Them's an arrangement fit to bust a man open by acting upon his imagination. Mr. Monson, sir, I'll tell'ee what once happened to me. I had a fever, and when I recovered, my narves was pretty, nigh all gone. I'd cry one moment like a baby, then laugh ready to split my sides over nothen at alL I took on a notion that I may lay wiolent hands on myself if the opportunity offered. It wasn't that I wanted to hurt myself, but that I was afeered I would. I recollect being in my little parlour one day. There was a bit of a sideboard agin the wall with a drawer in which my missus kep' the table knives we ate with. The thought of them knives gave me a fright. I wanted to leave the room, but to get to the door I should have to pasB the drawer where them .knives were and 1 couldn't stir. Your honour,, such was the state of my narves that the agony of being dragged past that door would have been as bad as wrenching me in halves. So 1 got out through the window, and it was a fortnight afore I had the courage to look into that parlour again." " My father knew a rich gentleman in Melbourne," said Miss Jennings, " who lost his mind. He believed that he had been changed into a cat, and all day long he would sit beside a little crevice in the wainscot of. his dining-room waiting for a mouse to appear." "But when it comes to imaginations of this kind," said I, "one is never to know what is going to follow. Captain Finn, my cousin may mend—1 pray God he will do so and soon—" "Amen," quoth Finn in his deepest note—"meanwhile," I continued, "I am of opinion that he should be watched." " You think so, sir?" he exclaimed. "Why, man, consider where we are. Send your eye into that mightydistance," I cried, pointing to the black junction of scintillant gloom and the spread of ocean coming to us thence in ink. " Think of our loneliness here and the condition that a madman's act might reduce us to. That is not alL Lady Monson, this young lady and her maid sleep close to his cabin. Who shall conjecture the resolution that may possess a diseased brain on a sudden ? Sir Wilfrid must be watched, Finn." I agree with you, sir," he answered .; thoughtfully, "but—but who's to have; the ordering of it ? " Tain't for the likes of me, sir—" he paused, then added, He's master here 'ee know, sir." " I'll make myself responsible," I exclaimed ; " the trouble is to have him watched with the delicacy that defy the detection of his most suspicious liumour should he put his head out of his berth or quit it—which he is not likely to do. get. Of course an eye would have to be kept upon him from without. Name me two or three of your trustiest seamen. " "Why, sir, there's Cutbill, a first-class man; and there's two others, Jonathan Furlong and William GrincUing, that you may put your fullest confidence in." "Then," said I, "1 propose that these men should take a spell of keeping a look out turn and turn about. The stewards would have been fit persons, but they are wanting in muscle. Let the man who keeps watch in the cabin so post himself that he may command the passage where Sir Wilfrid's berth is. You or Crimp, according as your watch comes round, will see that the fellow below, whoever he may be, keeps awake. Pray attend to this, Finn. I am satisfied that it is a necessary measure." I Bhall have to tell old Jacob the truth, sir, and the men likewise," said he, "and also acquaint the stewards with what's wrong, otherwise they'll be for turning the sailor that's sent below out of the cabin." By all means," said I, "I'll stand your lookout, whilst you are making the necessary arrangements. But see that you provide your men with some ready and quite reasonable excuse for being in the cabin should Sir Wilfrid chance to come out during the night and find one of his seamen sitting at the table." "Ay, ay, sir; that's to be managed with a little thinking," answered Finn, and forthwith he marched towards the forecastle into the darkness there. It is fortunate," I said to Miss Jennings; " that I am Wilfrid's cousin. If I were simply a guest on board I question if Finn would do what I want." We fell to pacing the deck. Even as we walked the light breeze weakened yet, till here and there you'd catch sight of the gleam of a star in some short fold of black swell running with a burnished brow. The dew to the fluttering of the canvas aloft fell to the deck with the pattering sound of raindrops. " Oh," groaned I to Miss Laura, " for a pair of paddle-wheels ! " We stepped to the open skylight to observe if aught were stirring below, but gladly recoiled from the gush of hot air there rising with a fiery breath stale with the smell of the dinner table spite of the sweetness put into it by the flowers. Heavens, how my very heart sickened to the slopping sounds of water alongside lifting stagnantly and sulkily melting out into black ungleaming oil! We seated ourselves under the fanning spread of mainsail, talking of Wilfrid, of his wife, of features of the voyage, until little by little 1 found myself sloivly sliding into a sentimental mood. My companion's sweet face, glimmering tender and placid to the starlight, came very near into courting me into a confession of love. The helmsman was hidden from us, we seemed to be floating alone upon the mighty shadow that stretched around. A sense of inexpressible remoteness was inspired by the trembling of the luminaries and the sharp shooting of the silver meteors as though all the life of this vast hushed universe of gloom were up there, and we had' come to a pause upon the very verge of creation, with no other vitality in the mis.ty confines save what the beating of our two hearts put into them. On a sudden she started and said, ' See ! there is my sister." The figure of Lady Monson rose, pple and veiled, out of the companion hatch. She did not observe us, and approached the part of the deck where we were seated, courted haply by the deeper dye the shadow of the mftinwail put into the atmosphere about it. I was struck by the majesty of her gait, by the tragic dignity of her Carriage as she advanced, taking the planks with A subtlety of movement that made her form look to glide wraith-like. The sweet heart at my side shrank with so clear a suggestion of alarm in her manner that I took her hand and held it. - Lady Monson drew close—so close without seeing us that I believed she was walking in her sleep, but she caught sight of us then and instantly flung with an expressible 'demeanour of temper and aversion to the other jside of the deck, which site paced, going afterwards to, the rail and overhanging it, motionless as the quarterboat that hung a little past her. " She frightens me I" whispered Laura ; " ought I to join her ? Oh, cruel, cruel, that she should hate me so bitterly for her own acts!" Why should you join her ? She does not want you. The heat has driven her on deck, and she wishes to muse and perhaps moralise over the colonel's grave. Why are you afraid of her ? " . " Because I am a coward." Just then Finn came along. He went up to Lady Monson and I saw his figure stagger against the starlight when he discovered his mistake. He peered about and then came over to us, breathing hard and polishing his forehead. "Nigh took.the breath out of my body, he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper; "actually thought it was your honour, so tall she be. Well, I've arranged eveiything, sir, and a lookout '11 be established soon artor the cabin light's turned down." Laura suddenly rose and wished me good-night. I could see that Lady Monson's presence rendered her too uneasy to remain on deck, so I did not press her to stay, though I remember heartily wishing that her ladyship was still - on board the 'Lisa Bobbins. She continued to hold her starless posture at the bulwark rail as though she were steadily thinking herself into stone. But for her contemptuous and insolent manner of turning from us I believe. I should have found spirit enough to attempt a conversation with her. It was not until four beUs-that she rose suddenly from her inclined attitude as though; startled by the 'cle^r echoing chimes. Past her tiie sky -was dimly reddening to the moon whose diisc still floated below the horizon, and against the delicate, almost dream-like flush, I.; perceived her toss up her veil and press her hands to her face. She then veiled herself afresh, came to the companion and disappeared. Was it remorse'working in her, or grief for her foundered colonel, or some anguish born of tho thought of her child ? Easier, I thought, to fathom with the sight" the mysteries of the ooze of the black, vaporous-looking surface that our keel was scarce now wrinkling than to penetrate the secrets of a heart as dark as hers ! Half-an-hour later I. quitted the "deck, and as I passed through the cabin nodded to Cutbill, who sat awkwardly, and with a highly embarrassed air with his back upon the cabin table, commanding the after cabins—a huge , salt, all whiskers, wrinkles, and muscle. CHAPTER XXVIL A DEAD CAIM. I WAS up and about a great deal during the night. It was not only that the heat murdered sleep ; there was something so ominous in the profound stillness which fell upon our little ship that the mind found itself weighed down ds with a sense of misgiving, a dull, incommunicable dread of approachable calamity. Of the dead calm at sea I was by no means ignorant; in African and West Indian waters Ihad tasted of the delights of this species of stagnation over and over again. One calm, I remember, came very cloBe to realising Coleridge's description or rather the description that the poet borrowed from the narrative of old Sir Richard Hawkins preserved in the foxed and faded pages of the Bev. Samuel Purchas. The water looked to be full of wriggling fiery creatures burning in s multitude of colours' till the surface of the .sea resembled a vast, ghastly prism reflecting the lights of some hellish principality, deep sunk in the dark brine.. But I never recollect the ocean until this night as with- •out some faint heave of swell; yet, after the weak draught of air had utterly died out, somewhere about midnight, the yacht slept upon a bosom as starless as the surface of a Bummer lake. There was not the lightest movement to awaken an echo in her frame, to run a tremor through her canvas, to nudge the rudder into the dimmest clanking of its tiller chains. The effect of such a hush as this at sea is indescribable. On shore, deep in the country, far distant from all hum of life, the stillness of night is a desired and familiar condition of darkness ; it soothes to rest; whatever vexes it is a violence; the sweeping of a gale through hissing and roaring trees, the thunder of wind in the chimney, the lashing of the windows with hail and rain, the red bolt of lightning to whose hue the bedroom glances in blood to the eye of its disturbed occupant; all this brings with it an element of fear, of something unusual, out of keeping, out of nature almost. But at sea it is the other way about. 'Tis the dead calm that is unnatural. It is as though the mighty forces of heaven and ocean had portentously sucked in their breach in anticipation of the shock of conflict, as a warrior fills his lungs to the full, and then holds his wind whilst he waits the cry of charge. I tried to sleep, but could not, and hearing one o'clock struck on the forecastle, dropped out of my bunk for ten minutes of fresh air on deck. Cutbill sat with his back against the table; the small flame of the lamp that hung without the least vibration from the cabin coiling gleamed in the sweat-drops that coated liis face as though oil had been thrown upon liim. I said softly, pausing a moment to address him: " A wonderfully still night, Cutbill." " Never remember the like of it, sir," he answered in a whisper that had a note of strangling in it, with his effort to subdue his natural tempestuous utterance "Allquiet aft?" " As a graveyard, sir." " In case Sir Wilfrid Monson should look" out and see you, what excuse for being here has Captain Finn provided you with ?" "I'm supposed to be watching the bayrometer, sir. If Sir Wilfrid steps out I'm to seem to be peering hard at that there mercury, then to go on deck as if I'd got something to report." " Oh, that'll do, I dare Bay," 1 exclaimed. "He may wonder, but that must not signify. Heaven, grant, Cutbill, that I am unnecessarily"'nervous; but were a middling full ship ; it is the'right sort of night, too, to make one feel the hugeness of the occ-w anil thp ljelplcss- iiess; o!

That we've gone to the bottom V' "It would be all one for me," he answered with a deep -sigh, and then applying himself to his pipe again with a sort of avidity that made one think of a hungry baby sucking at a feeding bottle. He clouded the air with tobacco smoke and said : "I am heartily weary of life!" "And why? " cried I: " because we are in a dead calm with the equator close aboard. The very deep is rotting! A calm of this kind penetrates "through the pores of the skin, enters the 'soul and creates a thirsty yearning for extinction. Being younger than you, Wilf, I give my self another twelve hours, and then, if no breeze blows, 1 shall, like you, be weary of life and desire to die." " It is easOy managed," said he. "Yes," cried I, startled, "no doubt. But the weather may change, you know," and not at all relishing his remark nor the looks that accompanied it I seized my hat and fell to fanning the atmosphere with the notion of expelling some of the tobacco smoke through the open porthole. "I am of opinion," said he, pi and dropping his words alternately wii the clouds he expelled whilst be kept his eyes fixed upon his watch, " that, sjrtfce of the arguments of the divines; life is a free gift to us to be disposed of as we may decide. Nature is invariably compensative. We are brought into this world without our knowledge and therefore, of course, without our consent, d'ye see, Charles," and here he rolled his eyes upon me, " and by way of balancing this distracting obligation of compulsory being, nature says you may do what you like with existence : keep it or part ifith it" "Isay, Wilfrid," said I, "there are surely more cheerful topics for an equi- noctial dog-day than this you have lighted on. Don't speculate, my dear fellow; leave poor old nature alone. Take short views, and let the puzzling distance unfold and determine itself to your approach. It is the wayfarers who decline to look ahead, who whistle as they trudge along the -road of life. The melataeholy. faces are those whose eyes are' endeavouring to see beyond the horizon towards which they are advancing. Tell me now—about this cabin door of yours. My dear fellow, it must be big enough this morning to enable you to pass through; eo come along on deck, will you, Wilfrid ? " "Damn it, how blind you are'!" he exclaimed. No, I'm not," said I. "D'ye mean to say that you can't, see what's happened to me since we last met?" "What now, Wilfrid ? " "What now?" he shouted. "Why, man, I can't stand upright." " Why not ?" I asked. " Because I'm too tall for this cabin," he answered in a voice of passion and grief. "Pray when did you find that out?" saidl. "On rising to dress myself this morning,"he answered,"! was obliged tbclothe myself in my bunk. What a dreadful blow to befall a maii ? I can't even quit my bed now, and everything I want must be handed to me." Well, well! thought I; God mend him soon. 3EJ<A as it was, a chill ran through me to the crazy, wistful, despairful look he directed at me, and I was oppressed for a moment with the same sickness of heart that had visited me dpring my interview with him oh the preceding day. "I had resplved to sell the Bride," said he mournfully, putting his pipe into a shelf at the back of him and' folding his hands, which seemed to me to have grown thin and white during the past few days, upon his breast, but I shan't be able to -do so how." ' I was silent. "She will have to be broken up," he added. " Nonsense !" I exclaimed. " But I say yes f" he suddenly roared ; " how the devil else am I to get out of her!" " Oh, I see !" I answered soothingly, " I forgot that. But, Wilf, since you're too Hg to use this cabin for the present only, for I am eertain you will dwindle 'bo your old proportions before long, don't you think you ought to have an attendant constantly with Jpou, some one at hand sitting here to wait upon you ? " " Why, yes," said he, " no doubt of it. Iam almost helpless now. But Fll not liaVe that rasoal Muffin." "No, no," said L "Nor would the stewards mtike the sort of servants you want. If I were in your place I Should like to be waited on by a douple of jolly hearty sailors, fellows to take' turn and turn about in looking after me, chaps with their memories full of long yarns, unconventional, sympathetic, no ihatter how rough their manners, agile, strong as horses with lively limbs, used to springing about, (hie or two such men are to be met forward amongst your crew." "A good "idea, he cried. "Gad I after my experiences of Muffin I'd rather be waited upon by the tarriest of tarry tarpaulins than one of your sleek, softstepping, trained rogues who come and ask you for a situation with ab excellent character in one pocket from their late master, and in the other the contents of his dresBing-case. Ha, ha, hal" and here he delivered one of his short roars of laughter. (To be continued.)
