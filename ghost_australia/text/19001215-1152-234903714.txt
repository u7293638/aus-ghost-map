THE "DEVIL" FRIGHTENERS. There exists in the flowery land a very numerous class who live on the credulity and superstition of the mass of their comatry people. Large sums of money annually fall into the hands of these quacks, who practise as devil- friirhteners, soothsayers, fortune-tellers, water-diviners, &c.; The devil- frighten era, whose services are always in great demand, visit haunted houses, and pretend, by means of hideous noises, consisting of the beating of drums, â€¢the springing of rattles, accompanied by much fierce yelling, hissing, and apitting, to frighten the spirits from their lairs. A queer industry which gives employment to many thousands is the manufacture of paper " ghost money," quantities of which the natives burn when making offerings to deceased parents and 'ancestors, thinking that byBO doing they provide disembodied beings with spending money in spirit-land. In one city alone, 100;000 men, women, and children are engaged in making this bogus cash.
