PARK L&NDS.; TO THB EDITOB. Sir—Mrny a time did my late lamented friend, David Gall, and I hold sweet counsel together about preserving the Park Lands sacred to the UBB of the citizens of Adelaide and I acknowledge the claim whish his* memory has to my loyalty in refarence to them. And as to the shed put up on the sidtof the King William-road for the trambojs' use I am sure that David Gall would have supported my action in obtaining a few feet for sheltering them against sun, wind, and rain. It is simply a seat for their use at citizens or the sons of citizens. It is placed there during the pleasure of the Council, anc can be removed upon the reasonable request of the citizens, or should it become a nuisance. There are many seats provided on the P-rk Lands, notably in the Rotunda enclosure on the other side of the road David Gall did not express himself in the colloquial style of his assumed ghost in the letter to which this is a reply, and I will venture to assert that he Still rests unturned in his peaceful grave. I am, Sir, &c..; _. SAMUEL TOMK1NSON. tf uly 3L ORGAN RECITAL.—Professor Ives will give an organ recital in the Town Hall this evening.
