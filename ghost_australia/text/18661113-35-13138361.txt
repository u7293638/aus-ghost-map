REMARKABLE VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC. from the London Daily Telegraph, August 27.) I A HW days ago a brief newspaper paragraph made known to the British public that a miniature full rigged ship, of something less than 22 tons register, with a crew of two men and a dog, had been spoken in the English Channel, off Hastings, after making an excellent passage, in point of time, from New York Any thing like pluck and endurance, even if bordering upon rashness, is so congenial to the Anglo- Saxon temperament, that no apology need be offered for amplifying the monaro details already known of on unrWanng attempted more than once before, but now, w 5 bales e, for the first time successfully achieved For this purpose it is not necessary to anal) se the motives which have induced two young American seamen to risk their lives in so perilous an under taking is crossing the stormy Atlantic in a little craft about the size of a ship s jolly boat I cav- ing conjecture out of the question, and taking the more tangible stand point of the opinions and doings of the adventurers themselves, which are duly recorded in a log book that bears very unmistakable evidence of what boat life is on the Atlantic, we find it stated " that the object of this expedition is to be at the w oriel s fair in Paris, to show the French they have not all complete without something notorious to give the rest a contrast " The Paris Exhibition, however, opens in April, 1897 to have reached it in time would have involved sailing from New York in February) Probably no one knows better than the adventurers themselves by this time that the chance of weathering an Atlantic equinoctial gale in the " roaring forties, in a two and a half ton boat, was rather too remote to be undertaken by any but a properly quail fed candidate for a lunatic asylum As a consequence, the village had to be undertaken this year at a period when the probabilities were in favour of the maximum of favourable weather Having safely arrived, the adventurers will no doubt find ways and means of spending their time pleasantly e tough till next April in visiting some of the principal seaports of the United Kingdom and the Comment The ship Red, White, and Blue, of New York, 2 3S 100 tons register, is a metallic lifeboat, built by 0 R Ingersoll, New York Her dimensions are as follows Length, 20 feet, breadth of beam, 6 ft 4 in death of hold, 2 ft Um, from decks to keel, 3 ft She is like all lifeboats and whale boats, sharp at both ends, or stem and stern alike She has a water tight compartment of 4 ft at each end, and o) under compartments along each side She is decked over but has a cockpit for the sf oarsman around the mizenmast She is ship rigged and Bpatrcd in proportion to her size as follows Bowsprit, 2 ft outside bows, jibboom, 3 ft, and flying jibboom, 2 ft , pole,

were designed and made by Mr Crush), of New York, consist of fore topmast stn) sail, jib and flying job fore main and mizzen courses, topsails, top gallant sails, and TO) als and Spanker All these are bent to set just as in a ship of 1500 tone In addition to these plain sails the Red, White, and Blue is provided with fore topmast staysails, fore and main topgallant stunsails, main try sail, and storm fore staysail and trysail She was launched on the 21st of June, having pre A MCUSIJ had a false keel fitted to her standing keel, giving a total depth of keel of 7 inches She was launched with all her spars standing, bows on, from a dock five feet above the level of the water Her captain and owner, John M Hudson-not a bad name, by the way, for an adventurous navigator was the only person on board, and he records it as a good indication of the fitness of his craft for her intended voyage, that " she did not take a bucketful of water on deck, and, considering the weight aloft, did not look to turn over, or in any way feel crank, as the people on the rocks said she would, but found themselves disappointed " Having found a congenial adventurous spirit in the person of Frank E Fitch, to share in the perils of the projected voyage, these two plucky New Yorkers went to work to get their craft ready for sea The newly launched craft was found to leak, and it was necessary to take out the mizenmast to repair the damage It would have been well for the comfort of the adventurers if they had discovered another defect in their craft, which did not develop itself until she was pitch- ing and rolling, grow uses under, in the huge swell of the Atlantic, but they filled to make the discovery, and paid the penalty of being wet through nearly the whole of the voy ago The stores taken on board consisted first of 12 ten-gallon kegs of water, 200 lbs of bread, 5 lbs coffee, 2 lbs of tea, 10 lbs butter, 1 boxes smoked herrings, 1 defences of milk, 15 lbs smoked beef, 17 lbs cheese, 4 bottles pickles, mustard, pepper, salt, and sauce, two bottles of brandy, 1 bottle whisky, and 1 bottle of bitters To these were added, as a gift, by Mr Isaac Rcckhow, of Brooklyn, 2 dozen cans each of the following preserved provisions roast beef, roast turkey, roast chicken, and mutton soup Mr lleckhow also presented Captain Hudson with his dog lands It would have been well for the poor brute in question if that gentleman's generosity had stopped short at his very appropriate gift of stores, for poor Fanny, unable to Maud up against constant wet and exposure, that was beginning to tell on her biped companions, gave up the ghost just as the lied, W White, and Blue made the mouth of the Thames, afttrsafcly surmount- ing all the dangers of the voyage The master a department consisted of a boat compass, quadrant, ] charts, parallel rule, dividers, weather inches itor, log line and glass, 7 lbs laid American ensign and pennant, English and French ensigns, anchor and fifty fathoms of rope but no chronometer The surgeon's department, to which happily we find no record in the log of use during the voyage, consisted of six bottles of Indian liniment, Six boxes of vegetable pills, a bottle of powders, and another mixture of some marvellous character, which we are told is the never failing smallpox cure, and has cured clow fever and cholera ' It was well, perhaps, for captain and crew that neither small- pox, cholera, nor yellow jack, gave them an opportunity of testing the value of their remedy During the process of fitting and show me ship the tiny craft was visited by crowds of curious New Yorkers The comments of the sterner sex, so far as they are recorded, do not appear to have been either hopeful or flattering The general character of the remarks were something as follows The fools will never get across, "That captain ought to be tried for murder, " " They ought to be put in a lunatic asylum ' the behaviour of the fair portion of creation was so different that the captain makes the following entry in his harbour log The poor ladies, God bless them' were all praying for us" the comments of the New York dressers scarcely more favourable, and in one notable instance certainly not more laudatory than those of their readers. Paragraphs appeared in most of the papers speaking anything but hopefully of the chances of SUCCESS. One notice was headed, " One more lunatic weary of breath," and closed with a suggestion that the miniature ship should be christened "The Fool's Own." Undeterred by these unfavourable remarks, Captain Hudson went on with his work, dismissing them with one final entry : "Let them all have their own opinions : I have mine." When the ship was ready, he and a party of six friends started on the 20th June for a trial trip down New York Bay. The breeze was too light to test the little vessel's qualities as a sea boat, but she was found to sail well and to work harder, and to that extent the trial was considered satisfactory. After some debate as to the name the ship was to receive, one correspondent suggesting the Claud Melnotte as one likely to ensure the little. craft a good reception in England, she was finally christened the Red, White, and Blue. The name, perhaps, is as cosmopolitan and well-chosen as it could be. It has reference, of course, to the colours of the national flag of the United States ; but as it applies equally well to the English and French and to half a dozen other national ensigns, each of the said nationalities may accept it as a compliment. The date of sailing was fixed for the 6th of July, and on that day Mr. Fitch boarded the ship in Whitehall slip, and at" 11.30 a.m. took her down to the Red Hook Point. At the same time Captain Hudson went to the New York custom- house, took out a register, a clearance in ballast, a crew list, a bill of health, and went through precisely the same formula as if his craft was a clipper packet. He " got through" at 1.30 at the custom-house, and then joined his friends on board a steam-boat called the Silas O, Pearce, and started down the bay. They overhauled the miniature ship opposite the Quarantine House on Staten Island, After a visit of the friends to the little craft they returned on board the steamer, leaving Captain Hudson and Mr Fitch alone with the dog the steamer took the Red, "W White, and Blue in tow as far as the light ship off Sandy Hook Going, down the bay poor It may seemed to have a presentiment of the fine that awaited her, for she howled lamentably, refused to be reconciled to her new quarters and at last fell over board ; but, unfortunately, perhaps it may be said, a boat from the steamer saved her About 5pm the adventurers cast off their tow line, and fairly commenced their voyage Before returning to the city the steamer ran alongside and the friends of the two resolute seamen (were each of them ' three cheers and a liner The log tells us that many a white handkerchief waved in the breeze, and then went to the bright eyes 01 warm hearted friends who were praying for our safety." The little ship then set sail and stood out to sea M ilh a light breeze from south-west At 7 30 the wind shifted to the north west, and freshened so much that the little craft shipped plenty of water the crew made the unpleasant discovery that the decks leaked badly, for there was soon four inches of water in her, and their bed and provisions were wetted They would have acted wisely to have run back to New York and repaired defects, but they stood resolutely on their course, and determined to make the best of a bad business At 3 p m they managed to lose their signal lamp overboard they passed vessels standing in for Iscvv work and to the eastward, and at midnight took their departure from the Highlands of Nnvcsink, which bore "W by N S N , distant 20 miles From this time commenced the ordinary routine of a ship at sea Captain Hudson and his mate kept watch and watch Of course the " watch on deck had to steer the ship If, therefore, it was necessary to take in sail, the " watch below had to be hurried out for the purpose, and had also to perform all other necessary ships duties Their first day out commenced with a fresh N E wind and a heavy swell Hudson had to turn out to shorten sail, and the ship kept very well to the wind with only the foretopsail. During that forenoon they spoke two pilot boats and reported how the ship worked so far there was a kerosene stove on board to burn coal oil, but the ship pitched and rolled about too much to use it The consequence was that the two men, though nearly always wet through, were very seldom able to make tea and coffee, or warm their provisions The first day's work, close hauled, gave the distance run 42 miles On the second day the winds were lighter, and the weather farmer, so that they were able to make coffee and bale out the ship The distance run in the twenty four hours was 49 miles On the 12th of July the wind shifted to the westward, with fine weather, and the men were able partially to dry some of their wet clothes and make some warm mutton soup, which is recorded as " the best ever tasted out of cans " Towards evening the wind freshened, and the little craft begin to howl off six and seven knots an hour, and in the course of twenty four hours made the excellent run of 105 knots On the 13th they made the discovery that their only time- piece, a watch, had got wet in the works and had stopped It was found on examination that " she was just) inside, ' so from that time forward their only in dication as to time was sunset, sunrise, and meridian "VI e find recorded from day to day the expenditure of sundry cans of beef, turkey, and mutton broth It is satisfactory to find that the dog was not neglected On the third day out there is an entry, " This day expended one can of beef for the dog, OF she must not be forgot It would appear that poor Fanny had become somewhat reconciled to her situation, and that occasionally she could find a dry spot, for she is logged on the 13th of July as follows She takes it out in sleeping The periodical recurrence of entries recording expenditure of cans of beef for the dog demonstrates that her sad fate was in no way due to any want of kindness and attention on the part of her biped Shipmates When running before a " fresh gale from the west with a clear 'blue sky, we find that the ship does very well, though taking in 60tne water-Captain Hudson as, " much better than I expected, considering that when she is in the hollow of the sea the sails are almost becalmed On the 14th of July they made a fair run of 139 miles, and the only remark in the log book apart from the ordinary entries of the ship's run is the statement " I had cockpit of ours is a very ' hard' place You are cramped up just high enough to catch the hips, it cramps the knees and makes us both sore It is the ' hardest place on board , the rest is bad enough The next day, Sunday, July 15, they were baffled by light and sometimes contrary winds, making a run only of sixty three miles, of which no inconsiderable proportion appeared to be due to the Gulf Stream During the afternoon they were becalmed, in company with a barque about two miles distant They set their ensign, and the barque did the same, but, from the flag hanging down, they were unable to make out her nationality "Whatever his country, the captain of her was an ill conditioned churn, for en a light air springing up, and the little ship heading to speak her, she wore round to the north and kept off, ' evidently, ' as Captain Hudson says, ' not wishing to speak us ' There are very few readers who will not cordially endorse Captain Hudson B opinion when he says, 'I cannot say much for that captains humanity who would pass a small ship, with only two men in her, 500 miles from land, with out desiring to speak her, even if he could do nothing ' Bowling along before favourable winds the little ship made runs of 92, 121, 104, and 115 miles in tho course of 24 hours, and everything went on pretty favourably, except when nine days out poor Fanny is logged sick, will not cut ' On the 20th of July the wind drew ahead, and they only made a run of 20 miles The next day it became rather more favourable and they got a distance of 72 miles out of their little craft On the 22nd they ran out of the Gulf Stream, which had hitherto been helping them famously on their voyage The record of discomfort is continuous , seldom a day passes without such entries as shipping water, no cooking to day ship makes water in around the gunwale, when it is under water Fortunately for these poor sodden navigators, the temperature of both air and water had been high since leaving New York Butonrunnuig out of the Gulf Stream there was an immediate fall of something like 42deg both in the air and water, and they now began to export i ence the additional discomfort of e old They passed a large green turtle one afternoon, but their minds were more intent on baling out the considerable quantities of w ever they were shipping than on turtle soup, and the succulent reptile went on his way unmolested About 3 p.m. on the 2 5th of July, while running with a southerly wind through a dense fog, they passed " through a strong current ripple Get into it before I could see it The water for about 60 yards was in a fearful foam, and topping up five or six feet Ship would hardly steer it as a long time getting out Son times her headway was stoped It resembled passing through Hurl gate, New York Passed through several smaller ripples From that fact, and feeling like ice I conclude we are in the Polar This was in latitude 44 deg 12 min N and longitude 40 deg 47 min W Hydrographers will probably with these data be able to determine how far Captain Hudson's surmise is correct At 4 a.m. the next morning the little craft was nearly upset by the effect of the current, which nearly brought her to while under the lee of a sea The runs made were 109, 85, 89, 117, 117, 172, 51, and 129 during the remainder of the month of July There are repeated entries in the log during the latter part of the month of being obliged to keep the ship before the sea when large waves come to prevent them from coming on board At 3 a.m. on the morning of the 30th they paid a similar compliment to a " large whale, which came so close alongside that they kept away from him At the close of the month, from 8 p.m. to midnight, the log says " Fresh breezes from S W and overcast The water sparkles so much that it is almost light when the sea breaks Towards midnight several seas in succession came rolling along, carrying the ship (she was steering USE). with them with great velocity j, so that the sails were hard aback I have never seen the like before with anything at sea ' August began with runs of 130, 109, 109, and 75 miles in the twenty four hours, and with miserably foggy, during weather Captain Hudson over- hands his nose for mouldy clothes and was successful in finding some shirts that way inclined, and some books also ' A faint glimmer of sunshine through the all pervading fog is diligently improved, to counteract this unpleasant tendency of everything on board the Red, White and Blue On the 4th of August they sighted a barque, the first sail seen for twenty days, and saw the sun set the first time for ten days The next day, Sunday, August 9th, they saw another ship She ran down to them, and proved to be the barque Princess Royal, of Nova Scotia She hove to, and the little ship ran under her lee, and got from her a bottle, an old white signal light, and I wish 1 times and 1 leeman Journal of July 24th The barque was eleven days out from Dublin, bound to Quebec The seasonable gift of the rum they found " very good lot Mr st days an experience which we feel inclined cordially to endorse, teetotalism to the contrary notwithstanding On the 6th the sea ran so high that the little ship took in two over the stern, or, rather. the fragments occasioned by her sharp stem splitting them as they flew past her About 5pm a bund sea took her on the port quarter, and hove her on to her starboard beam ends On letting go the topsail had j ords she righted in about half a minute There is something almost comical in the entry recording this as ent, TV Inch says " We have carried Bail pretty hard, but never saw her do that before the dangerous sea was the cause, as yet only had foresail, foretopsail, foretopmast staysail, and jib set It was not long, however, before they had a repetition of the same rather donning occurrence, for next morning, at 8.30 they shipped a heavy sea, which again threw the ship flat on her starboard beam ends With great difficulty they clewed down the fore and r -un topsails, and in about a minute-which, eye can well conceive, " looked like on hour, ' she slowly righted, and after some considerable baling things were got into tolerable order twice again before making the English coast was the little ship hove on to her beams, and after a few anxious seconds righted again by the heave of the s a During the whole of the beginning of August she experienced strong westerly and north westerly winds, which enabled her to lay her course, but which caused her to ship 60 much water that captain and mate were never dry, and suffered much from cold and exposure On Sunday, 12th August instant the monotony of their daily life was somewhat relieved by a large shark coming alongside and keeping them company They this day got an observation of the sun, and found they had overrun their reckoning about 60 miles in a run of 3000 from New York considering that they had for the most part been navigating by dead reckoning, the error was really very small They found that Ushant bore south, distant 27 miles, and from this point they took a fresh departure and stood up the English Channel They were soon in the track of shipping, but none seemed to have troubled themselves about the diminutive stranger, until an American barque, the II ellie Merryman, of New York, Captain H A li ay lins gave them two bottles of brandy, a broken white signal lamp, and the bearings of the Bill of Portland The rest of this adventurous story is soon told Passing up Channel with a flowing sheet, they made all the well known points in succession, communicating at Hastings with some fishermen, from whom the news of their arrival was first heard, and by yy home Captain Hudson and his mate, Mr Fitch, learned that the Great Eastern had successfully laid the Atlantic cable At Deal they got the offer of a pilot, which was destined Rounding the South Foreland, she beat up against a head wind to Margate On the afternoon of the 16th, when abreast of that place, it came on to blow so hard that they gladly accepted the offer of Captain Thomas Winther, of the boat Jessie, who took hold of the little ship and towed it into the harbour The crowd on the pier cheered them lustily, and for the next forty eight hours the little ship was visited by thousands, of whom some were sceptical enough to express doubts that so small a craft had ever performed so long a voyage for the first time for thirty four days these wet and weary men enjoyed the luxury of stretching their stiffened limbs and of sleeping in a dry bed They remained at Margate till Saturday, the 18th, when, about 2 pm, they made saiWitha light wind, and beat up for the mouth of the Thames The wind was light and the ebb tide strong, so that it was 4 a in on Sunday morning before they were abreast of Sheerness At 6 a m the steam ship Londonderry, Captain 'AA bite ran alongside and kindly offered to tow them up to Gravesend The offer was gladly accepted, and they went up the river astern of the steamer, furling sails and taking things comfortably The only drawback to their satisfaction was that poor Tanny, not being able to hold out any longer, died at their feet in great agony, after a number of previous fits After the steamer had anchored at Gravesend, Captain White aid them a visit, and took them back to dinner with him Eventually the Red, White, and Blue went up as far as Gicenhifhe, and was anchored astern of the coastguard ship, where she was scraped, painted, and made presentable before being brought up to town This extraordinary voyage was performed in 3-4 days from New York to the chops of the Channel, 38 days to Margate, and -40 days 16 hours to Gravesend Captain Hudson and his companion may be fairly congratulated on hay ing safely accomplished so perilous an adventure "Whatever other result may have been achieved, no one will deny them what credit may attach to the demonstration of its being possible to cross the stormiest ocean in the world in a cockleshell The Red, White, and Blue was conveyed to the Crystal Palace from Greenhithe on Saturday Captain Julius and Captain Hudson accompanied the little ship, which for some time to come will form one of the attractions of the Palace _
