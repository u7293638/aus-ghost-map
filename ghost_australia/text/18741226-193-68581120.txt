MY" TAILOi. BY UU(II IBOWAIIRI. HIe looms the terrorof n v (lays, A load upon my soul he lays; Hearing his name in commnon phrase. I'm paler. Not Hamlet's pa's grim ghost, I knosw; Than he was more nualoprops, Who makes me chill from crown to toej M1y heavie-t care, my darkest wuoe lMy tailor! I've owed him since I don't know wheon If once in full I'd pasid him then I'd be the happiest of men, I'd caper. But as it is there's no rclease: Mly miseries refuse to cease ; The items constantly increase Upon his hill -that beastly piece Of paper. Ah, bwould that I might flee for-milee To where repose the s.ummer isles Praised, hy tobacco-tinted smiles, By sailors ! Where clogging trousers don't annov The napkiued thighs of man and boy, Who ramble, innocently coy, And know not, in their guile!ess joy, Of tailors !
