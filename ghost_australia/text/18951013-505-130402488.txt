JOHNSTONE'S BAY SAILING CLUB. The race sailed by the Johnstone's Bay Sailing Club yesterday afternoon was an All Boats (16ft to 20ft) Handicap, over a course from a line between the starter's boat and Goat Island, down to and round the Lightship and Sow and Pigs, thence round Shark Island, and back to the starting point, for prizes of £5, £2, and £1, presented by the club. The conditions were best aud best, and handicaps were given at the start. The starters and skippers were : — Grace Darling 20ft (T. Colebrook, sen) scratch working, Victor 20ft (G. Holmes, sen.) scratch, Inez 18ft (Fred Doran) 3 1/2min, Ariel 18ft (T. Colebrook, jun.) 4min, Ruby 18ft (J. T. Robinson) 4min, Cygnet 18ft (P. Pontey) 1 1/2min, Olinda 18ft (T. H. Snowden) 6min. Olinda was first away, and went off on the star board tack, and stood well over to the weather shore before throwing round. Cygnet was next, followed by Ariel and Buby, the latter followed Olinaa's oxauiple. Inez in her turn got away. Victor and Grace Darling crossed the line together, _ only tbe former had the weather position by some' little distance. Both tbe latter went awny on the starboard t.ack, but did not stand on far before going in stays. A close contest ensued between these two, and when Eirribilli Point was reached Grace Darling had considerably lessened the gap .between herself aud her formid able opponent. Victor's skipper not liking the close proximity, sent his topsail aloft, which did its work well, and kept her ladyship at bay until midway between Bradloy's and Shark Point, when Grace went to the front. In the meantime the limit boats went down stream with the ebb tide. The order at Bradley's was Ariel, luez, Cygnet, OJinda, Buby, Victor, and Grace Darling. On opening out Brad ley's Head, Ariel had not covered much ground when Inez caught her on the wrong tack, and Ariel's skipper had to put his tiller down. Inez now led on tho thrasli to the Light ship, which was rounded as follows : — Inez 4h 3lmin 5sec, Cygnet 4h 3-2min 25seo, Ariel 4h 3^min 59sec, Olinda 4h 34min Ssec, Buby 4h 34min 59sec, Grace Darling 4h S5min lOsec, and Victor 4h 36min 153ec. Topsails were sent alott on all for tbe run to Shark Island. Inez and Cygnet carried ballootiers end ou. Ariel struggled under a ringtail and ballooner. Olinda and Grace Darling carried squaresails, and Oiiuda and Victor ran under spinnakers. Before the buoy was reached both Grace Darling aiid Victor dis placed Buby and Olinda. The times at jibiug lor tho final ran were : Inez 4b 4!)min 40sec, Cygnet 4h 51min 15sec, Ariel 4h 51min 45sec, Grace Durliug 4h 53min, Victor 4n 53min 17sec, Buby 4h 53min 55sec, and Olinda 4h 5'nniu lOsec. lCite3 were re tained on most of the boats for the run home. Olinda had the misfortune to c irry away her top mast, spinnaker aud topsail consequently came to grief -.her crew were, however, not disheartened, but stuck to it manfully and got the spinnaker reefed ou her agaiu, aud wore rewarded by over reaching Buby ; but their joy was too short-lived, for she gave up the ghost when within 200yds of home. The finishing times were : — H. m. s. Inez ... ... 5 13 38 Cygnet 5 20 10 Ariel ... ... 5 20 54 Grace Darling 5 21 6 Victor 5 21 58 Ruby 5 23 34 The officials of the race were Starter, Mr. S.
