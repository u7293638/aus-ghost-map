A CORPORATE FIX. The Municipality of Barataria is declared to be hopelessly bank rupt. Since its birthday it has drawn sustenance from the common fund of the people, i.e. the Public Treasury, and it has lately been ignominiously ejected at the front door by its generous and conside rate banker. Its Aldermen are very worthy fellows, and talk a great deal, sometimes using fire-works adjectives, and otherwise making the welkin ring. But, notwithstanding the circumstance that they have just acquired a new uniform, they are incapable of suggesting even the ghost of a scheme by which the city may be purged of the shame of chronic indebtedness and bank humiliation. The ratepayers of Barataria are not heavily rated, and many of them have not paid rates for years. During lucid intervals, a rate-collector occasionally levies under a distress warrant for arrears that a tenant knows nothing about, and the neighbourhood sees him no more. Altogether, the institution is of the sort known as the happy-go-lucky, and would afford a rare theme for Jenkins, M.P. , who wrote Ginx's Baby, or for a comic song with a ratepayers' rousing chorus . A correspondent, for some time a guest at Gladesville, but now much better, has begged Punch to publish Ms view of the matter, which staggers along in this way : — Treasurer for many years — never saved a penny, Treasurer of spendthrift ways — economy, not any, Has seen the Council drift and drift, Content to make a weekly shift, Like many. Still keeps his books as they've been kept, On hucksters' muddled system ; Looks big at auditors, and says, "New notions — I'll resist 'em." No thought of coming rainy day, Affairs have bungled all the way, 'Till now he can't untwist 'em. 'Tis not the Council's fault so much They're now in sad dilemma ; They've leant upon a broken crutch — Too late to cry " Whoa, Emma ! " Say who's to blame for all the shame Now cast on that fair city ? No one, of course. Yes, that's the game, And certes, more's the pity.
