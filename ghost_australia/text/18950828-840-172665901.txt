"A REVERIE. Yon win that heaves his golden orb Of light above the eastern main And brings again the fated day That led me Into love's fast chain, Brings bitter memories back to me Of blighted hopes now mourned with tears That cast their shade athwart the life, And darken all the shifting years— Of woman's false and fickle heart Where once sweet human love had root And ran to flower— of sacred vows Trod as unholy under foot. Yet fain would I repress the thought Of wrongs that rankle in the breast, And think of her as in those days When all the hours with love were blest, And ran their brief but joyous round And birds made music all the day, And hope swelled high, and skies were blue Which now have changed to dullest grey. So as the dawn grows on apace, And floods with sunshine sea and shore, The ghosts of olden times will come And haunt me with their treasured store. Again we sit beneath the shade- Again the springtide eve grows dim; The hawthorn scents the leafy lane, The birds sing outtheir vesper hymn. Her head upon my breast reclines, Her dark eyes shine like stars above ; I feel the pressure of her hand, And hear her whisper tales of love. A dream, now past for evermore ! Seat up, my soul, as best thou may The spring of fancy which upwells But bitter draughts for thee to-day. Give to the past her dead sea fruit ; In mellowed mem'rys moonlight let Those bygone days and sweet face Live on in purified regret, —John Devane.
