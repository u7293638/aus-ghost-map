Political Froth. THE surface was smooth when we began on Monday—very smooth. It was only an experienced eye that could detect any indications of the prodigious gasbag that lay buried in the deep —ready, on the first puncture, to send up not merely strings of bubbles, but really explosive blasts. Formal business was despatched with remarkable celerity, and amidst an omiaous calm. And then Stevensou arose, and begged to move the adjournment of the House. At the best of times he weais a rather injured air when speaking—a perpetual it's-really-too-bad-you know expression—and on this occasion it was very marked. That unhappy Courier. It had mixed him up with Archer, had accused the most gentlemanly and urbane member of the House of baviog taken part in a grand frolic of the previous week, when for nearly two hours an admiring Assembly had watched the three Original Rollicking Barcoo Blades give their favorite entertainment at the expense of the member for the Warrego. The Courier has bee a objecting to these reminiscences of the palmy days of Tambo, and of Rockhamp ton before it became decorous and was yet in its "stormy youth." So Stevenson rose to com* plain. The Courier had apologised to Archer, and it had made "a sneaking and cowardly attack on me, sir;" and he " claimed the right to vindicate bis character." Which he did at length, appealing to Stevens to corroborate his assertion that he had been animated by none, but the loftiest and most impersonal motive* in opposing the Sheep Travelling B''l Then he sat down, and the leader of the " subseotion," the member for the Mitchell, arose— Pride in his port, defiance in bia eye. Morehead does not appear to advantage when he is thoroughly in earnest or angry. It is seldom that the actor who excels in broad farce, can assume the dagger and bowl of tragedy. On this occasion, however, he clutched both implements with a very thoroughgoing air. It was the Courier again. With deliberate and impressive utterance he informed the House of the steps that he intended to take, of the victims that would have to be slain to appease his just wrath. His audience looked puzzled at first, just as I have seen a whole theatre-full silent when an old favorite appears in an entirely new charac ter ; but as the awful string of threats unwound itself, when he emphatically declared his inten tion of pronouncing the doom of a man who had offended him, an irresistible smile nickered over the countenances of those who had been looking so grave. Morehead, in the character of a Revivalist, promising a future oration in the style of " Sinner, beware I do you know where you are going to ?" looked promising, the smile broadened to an expectant grin ; and when the speaker reached his climax by promising a list of " honorable members in the PAY " of the all embracing Courier, the grin had become a guffaw. Stevens said a few words, uot the anxiously* expected corroboration of his friend with the additional syllable, but a grave correction of an error into which ho had fallen, nud poor Stevenson complaiued of the omission in terms that would have melted the heart of a stone. Then we subsided, and became very dreary. Griffith and Douglas had grievances, and ex plained them with tedious fullness. But when we got into Estimates the bubbles rose briskly. The votes for the Qovernor's establishment afforded a tempting opportunity for the display of patriotism. Bailey seized it briskly, and moved their reduction by the sum of £500 put down for travelling expenses on tours of inspec tion. Bvit the member for Wide Bay had not reckoned on the members representing northern constituencies. I would not like to be the nor thern member who bad to face his constituents —especially the female portion of them—after having given a vote that might be even supposed to deprive them of the chance of a Governor'a visit. There is nothing dearer to the heart of every well-intentioned British man or woman than the opportunity of making much of any person possessing even a reflected ray of the glory of royalty, unless it be the privilege of grumbling afterwards at the expense so willingly undergone at the time. So the reduction was lost by 30 to 7, the "subsection" coming in and voting unitedly with the majority. But Bailey stuck to his poiut, and moved another reduction iv the other vote of £500 for incidentals. More* head backed him up with surprising vigor, and repeated all the arguments that had just been used in favor of the provious reduction, against which he himself had voted. He uppeared to be in happy ignorance of the fact, and the mistake is one into which I think that those members who generally serve their country in the smoking-room—coming in only when the division bell rings or some little mischief is going—are apt to make. However, we had a good deal of vigorous speaking from him. Spurred on, I think, byKinwford, who kept on rising during the discussion with a " dem the sixpence" air, and protesting against this " petti fogging and cbreseparing." Morehead went in fcr a grotesque burlesque of treason which, riming from another man, wou'd probably have evoked a good deal of aeiious indignation. Perhaps tho funniest thing that he did wad to deaounoe the employment of Chinese servants at QoTernment House. The sentiment was well enough, but coming from him it sounded strange. Douglas also gave a capital illustration of the style in which he is past master. He wanted to Bay that the Qovernor did not keep up enough show and state, and gyrated round his point with the smoothest dexterity. I watched the puzzled face of the " Hansard " reporter as his pen followed the mellifluous sentences, but he caught the spirit of the thing admirably hi the following delightful phrase—" viewed with some regret the fact that he did not attach to the circumstances surrounding him that importance and accidence of State." Baynes spoke with furious indignation, and offered to go a whole sixpence instead of the halfpenny which he, as an individual taxpayer, would have to pay towards the expense of his Excellency's establishment A reduction of £250 was car ried, however, in spite of this magnanimity ; and the " subsection " walked across the floor to vote for it. with the real ciioytn swagger. This finished Monday; we had no Bpirit for much more after so distinguished adiaplay of patriotism. Tuesday opened with a business-like air.; Palmer added one more item to the selections from the poets, whioh is enriohing " Hansard," by the rhyme of If Ifa and anda were pota and pans, There would be no use for tinkers' hands. . The Government got £100,000, and M'llwraith displayed much dexterity in evading some press ing enquiries as to what he was going to do with it Then Perkins, who had been fidgetting terribly, got up and moved u» into committee on his Land Act Amendment Bill. No wonder he seemed nervous. That bill threatens to be to him what a big Newfound land dog is to a small boy who attempts to lead him about on a chain—the dog generally takes the lead out of the hands of bis supposed guide. That is pretty well what happened with Perkins' bill; it slipped out of his control pretty com pletely before the evening was over. However, the discussion was solid and npt frothy at aIL But there was something very touahing in the way in which so many speakers on both sides affirmed their good faith. Members do not seem to understand the full application of the proverb, "excusing oneself is.accuiing oneself." Rutledge got up steam in one speech, not angrily, but just a- little lifting of the oratorical safety valve. Fafceraon, of|Kockha»pton, is becoming* painful example of falling into Charybdis in order to aVoid Scylla—that is, if I may be permitted to liken the irrepressible Bea to that unpleasant female. Rea is direct enough in his statement*, Paterson is becoming to guarded that he evoked two long speeches from members who t had not been able to make out what he was driving at We made a night of it over that question, although the Premier impatiently hinted that if honorable members did not make haste he would take the bill they were worrying from under their teeth. Oh Wednesday the Premier made an explan ation that let the bottom out of mash of the declamation indulged in the previous evening. He had discovered that his Excellency had not dmwn much more than one quarter of the amount voted last year for tour* ef inspection, and not the whole £500 as supposed. In doing this he moved the adjournment of the House, thus giving an opportunity to some of the mem bers who had more than hinted that the Qovernor had acted in a discreditable manner to withdraw their imputations. The only man who took the opportunity offered for general speaking was Mr. Miles, and he correoted a report whioh made him say that there was a flour-mill between Dalby and Jimbour ! I must say I like that Parlia mentary custom whioh permits a man to accuse whoever he pleases of disgraceful con duct, or even of fraud, without any neces sity for proving his words, or even impos ing an obligation on him to apologise when the accusation is disproved. And then we fell on the Civil servants with a relish. Have you ever noticed, sir, the intense satisfaction with which a big lubberly lout will corner a small boy in a retired spot in the playground, and amuse himself with " flicking" him till he squirms and whimpers, and then punching his head for crying 1. Those Civil servants i They are such a danger to the State that honorable mombers can attack them with perfect impunity how and when they please, although they dare not speak a disrespectful word even of a chimney-sweep lest his mates might make it hot for them at the next election. That's where the fun comes in. The Civil servants must not even speak, or write a letter to the papers ; their hands are tied, their mouths are shut. There is not the least danger of retaliation, and there is not a member of the House who cannot prove his courage (?) by abusing them. Even Dickson and Rutledge look pen sive and ashamed when the finger of scorn is pointed at them as the members who have the largest number of Civil servants among their constituents. It is as if one should say, " There sit the men who represent the offscour ings of the population." lam on the look-out for a Government billet myself ; it is a uervice which every man who respects himself should eudeavor to cuter. And I quite approve of the proposal for disfranchising Civil servants, al though I know that if a sect of Calathumpiaos arose who preached the total subversion of all laws, social and political, and a proposal were made to deprive them of their votes, there would be one universal howl against the illiberality of the proposition. But this is not froth. I confess it, and can only plead that the contents of the pot were so solid and so muddy that no frivolity ever rose to the surface—at least hardly ever rose. George Thorn did try to take a rise out of Palmer by suggesting that he ought to reduce his own salary, but that veteran bluntly told him that when he—the hon. George —refunded all the pay he had received from the State without giving any equivalent for it, he would consider his proposition. I don't think that our ex-Premier, who to frankly explains the working of our political system to chance sti an gers on steamboats, had altogether the beat of tbat encounter. It wu3 also amusing to watch the cautious dexterity with which the leaders on each ad" tried to thrust on one another the re sponsibility of proposing the reductions, or, as Samuel the WUe nunrked, of "drawing the chestuutts out of the Ere." " Speech was given to nun to conceal thought," bo it haa been said. Ministers have taken the proverb to their hearts, and they block with the/ neatest dexterity all those enquiring spirits who are so anxious to pry behind the veil that, Bhrouds their intentions. Diokson, with his blandest air, wanted to know when the Trea sarer intended to "submit to the House bi§| resolutions concerning any proposed amendment of the Customs tariff M'llwraith, with just the ghost of a smile, told him that it would be "when the state of the Government business in the House per. mits of so doing." That jealously- guarded Becret of the Government policy is not) to be surprised in this manner, although irreverent gossips are going about declaring that the burglars stole the draft out of the Premier's [ private bureau, and that he had to call a caucusi meeting of supporters early in the week to rqcon- ■ struct it from memory. The first startling inci dent was the reading aloud of bis Excellency*,, private accounts. The bill for liquors which was , charged by the caterer to the Governor on the occasion of his late trip by the Kate to the Nortji . was listened to with astonishment and admira- > tion. The long list of cases of champagne, , claret, brandy, and gin, ending with six , gallons of rum, seemed to exceed event, capacity for absorption. When , Palmer concluded by saying that hiß Excellency bad disputed the account, because he had -, " neither swum in the grog nor drunk it," bis i elicited a heartfelt "hear hear" from Meatoh, . Douglas and Griffith each made a personal ex- ', plan&tion; on the subject, and Miles said that if ' ever Palmer brought down a similar message,, from the Governor, he would tell him what his., thought of it—evoking a scornful "Good Heavens" , from Palmer, and a bellicose assurance that ''I \ will do the same thing to-morrow Jf I Jjke." , Then two members who had a desire to court . the- voices of that most susceptible of all classes in the community, the miners, moved ' for money grants for them. Ptubley wanted  merely money for a complicated system of bonuses, and soon withdrew his motion ; but <j Qailey would not be content with less than £60,000 for scientific explorations with diamond v drills. Macrossan laughed at him, and declared r that Mites had, at the instigation of Morehead, bought a diamond drill to look for water in thf dry* back country, forgetting that it required any.,. amount of water to work it That drill, to Macrossan said, lay forlorn at the Works Office/" mo ' man desiring it. Miles promptly explained, fc that he had not bought the drill; he had only. * promised to do so, in order to pacify More- " hJßad ; but having cleared out from iha Works Office in a hurry, he had forgotten t» ghre Griffith the wink, and the gnflet«M Samuel had carried out in real earnest the merely*"Parliamentary" promise. Bailey did not take the unfriendly reception of his" motion ' kindly—though he assured the House he expeora < nothing else from such a thoroughly bad lot aY Ministers, and the M complete Ignorance"- with a wittering glance at M'Lean— of "members io .ol her parts of the House." This was bard upon M'Lean, who- always gets up and talk* inthe oharaoter of an old miner when occasion offers* It wm rather amusing to hear Bailey, the farmer, dilate upon the paramount importance of mining, ■ and Macrotaan, the miner, declare that farmer*' ought to be considered first There are wheejg within wheels, and they revolve in very complex circles. After this we relapsed into utter dreari-' nefH relieved only by the rapidity with which' motions were despatched, and so ended the week. Hkbb, where it v rather the exception to lock' our doom, an uneasy feeling U disseminated;, through the whole community by hewing ofh burglar* unongat us. We had hoped that with • the capture of the gang of Frenchmen who had ' paid so many domiciliary visit* to different clti- . sens this particular crime had ceased in Brisbaue ; for lack of professors. We are sorry to find thai such is not the ease. Some time daring the smalt' hours of Saturday morning it is judged that two* men entered the hon. T. M'llwraith's house at' Tenerlffe, and in a very leisurely and systematic manner proceeded to attach such articles as they fancied would prove serviceable. The thieves apparently entered by the dressing*room door that opens on to the verandah, and here theyi secured Mr. M'llwraith's watch and chain and £10 in cash. A set of valuable diamond studs left in his shirt upon a chair fortunately escaped their observation. They theu proceeded into the adjoining sleeping apartment, using evidently » candle, shaded from the sleepers' faces by Mr. M'llwraith's great coat, which was found to be smeared with candle grease. Here their survey resulted in the capture of Mrs. M'llwraith's watch and chain and a number of trinket*, amongst which were a heavy gold bracelet and ft valuable ring set with two rubies and three' diamonds. Fortunately here again the burglars overlooked the chief prize, Mrs. M'llwraith's jewel casket, in which were articles of consider* able value. We suppose operators under these circumstances are somewhat nervous and very hurried. Miss Moaaman was Bleeping in the adjoining room, and hither the burglars repaired so stealthily as tv avoid awaking the sleeper, whose watch and chain and various trinkets were added to the visitora' capital account. It is to be hoped that our detective force tuay ob tain some clue that will cut short the career of these accomplished thieves. Some weeks ago we announced a proposed re sumption of oertain lands iv the immediate vicinity of Tambo, Blackall, and Aramao for the purposes of settlement We now learn that the usual notices, which will expire in December next, have been issued to the lessees of the re spective rum, as follows :—Tambo : 9£ square miles, from Oartmore run, 43£ from Greendale, 21 from Greendale back run, 38 from Garran garra, and 16£ from Ranger ; making a total of 128$ square miles. Blackall : 6£ square miles from Norwood, 11£ from Alice Downs, 24 from Alice Downs west, 9 from Douglas Ponds, 17£ from, ftlenusk, >10 from Hawarden, 19£ from Brynmaur, 3£ from Buccleugh ; total, 101 square milen. Aramac : 440 acrea from Bobka No. 2, 2£ equare miles from Stainburn Downs, 2| from Upper Boxdale, 2 from Triangle, 40 from Box dnle, 53 from Joebell, 4£ from Ingberry ; total, 109 square miles and 600 acres.
