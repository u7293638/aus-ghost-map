A Very Harrow Escape. All the gboBt, mnrder, and explosion Rtories had been told, and then a grizz'y olii captain took a fresh chew of tobacco und observed :— " The narrowest escape I ever see WRB that of a man who came hpre in the hold of a vessel loaded with pig iron. H-- •:r«'pf into the boat when she was empty and went to Bleep, and when they came to load her they covered him np with iron. I BuppoBe there wasn't less than 500 tons of the staff on top of him, and he waB in that position for seven or eight days, with nothing to eat or drink. When tbey got down to him they took him out, and a more surprised lot of deck wallopers you never see." " How did he work it?" was asked. "Work what?" " Why, how did he escape being crushed ?" " He was crushed. He was as fiat and thin as that there sail." " I don't see where the narrow 'scape comes in then," said the lineman. "Well, I do," continned the narrator, "and so would you, if you had seen them just take him out through a seam in the side of tho boat." Then the meeting broke up. —Chicago Herald.
