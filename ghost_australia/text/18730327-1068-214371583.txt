MID-DAY CAMP. RoAny 1 tho snn's duo north, and so, old horso, As wo have fairly onrned an hour of cnBe, We'll camp beside tlris shnltow watercourse, And tnko advantage of thesa slmdy trees. There's grass upon tlio bank, if there you'll stay, And water, whore tlio cattlo como to drink ; No need for you to wnndor far away, Old friond, you nro too staid for that I think. My meal dispatched, I lie boncath tlie sliado, And list the curlow's mclancboly note ; 1 hoar the lowing of tlio distant stntion cows, Tho mocking ery from jay's discordant throat. And now to other times my thoughts will stray, Before I know the stockman's rougher llfo ; For I, liko othor dogs, " have lind my day," And borne mo fairly in tho world's strife. Thoro was a timo when I had higher aims, Than thus to lio among tho trcos and liston To laughing birds, or watch the sun's hot flames O'or tho broad plain's surface glow and glisten. There was a timo, perhaps, wlion I'd thought To mako a name, a homo, a bright existence ; But time lias shown mo that my drcamsSjiN'c nonght Snvo a mirage that vanished with the distanco. Woll, now it's gone, " so wags tho world away," With mnuy as high and bettor aspiration. And so — t wonder whore the " scrubbors " stray — . A herdsman's oaro upon a cattlo station. Como on, old Ronny, lot us start again, Memory's dond ghost in liastc I'll chaso away ; Its hunting shadows bring ma nought but pain, Or wistful rovories of n happier day. R. G. G., Upper Dawson.
