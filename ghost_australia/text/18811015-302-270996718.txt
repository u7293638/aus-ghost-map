PO E TR Y. The miser lay on his lonely bed, Life’s candle was burning dim, His heart in bis iron chest was bid, Under heaps of gold and a well locked lid, And whether it were alive or dead, It never troubled him, Slowly out of his bed he crept; Said he, “ I am all the same 1 “ Only I want my heart in my breast; “ I will go and fetch it out of the chest,” Swift to the place of his gold he stept— He was dead but had no shame 1 He opened the lid—Oh, hell and might 1 For a ghost can see no gold ; Empty and swept—not a coin was there I His heart lay alone in the chest so bare 1 He felt with his hands, but they had no To finger or clasp, or hold 1 At his heart in the bottom he made a clutch— A heart or a puff-ball of sin 7 Eaten with moths, and fretted with rust, He graspcdbut a handful of dry-rotted dust ; It was a horrible thing to touch. But he bid it his breast within. And now there are some that see him sit In the charnel-house alone, Counting what seems to him shining gold, Heap upon heap, a sum ne’er told ; Alas, the dead, how they lack of wit 1 They are not even bits of bone 1 Another miser has got his chest, And his painfully hoarded store ; Like ferrets his hands go in and out, Burrowing, tossing the gold about; And his heart tools out of his breast, Hid in the yellow ore. Which is the better—the ghost that sits Counting Ebadowy coin all day, Or the man that puts his hope and trust In a thing whose value is only his dust 7 Hothing be has when out ho flits, But a heart all eaten away.
