TEE CONSCIENCE AND FUIUBE JUDGMENT. T sat alone with my conscience In a place where time had ceased, And we talked of my former living In the land whste the yean increased, _ind I felt I should have to answer The question it pat to me, t^i to bee the answer and question Throughout an eternity. He ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my eight, And things that I tbonght were dead things, Were alive with a terrible might, And the vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to face — Alone with my conscience sitting In that eolemnly-silent place. j.nd I thought of a far-away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future, Bat now is the present time, And I thought of my former thinking Of the Judgment-day to be. But sitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enough for me. And I wondered if there was a future To this land beyond the grave ; Bat no one gave me an answer, And no odb came to save, Then I ff It that the future was present, And the present would never go by. For it was but the thought of my past life Grown into eternity. Then I woke from timely dreaming, And the vision passed away. And I knew the lar-away warning Was a warning of yesterday — And 1 pray that I may not forget it, In this laud beyond the grave, That I may not cry in the future, And no one come to save. Ami eo I have learnt a leBson Which I ought to have known before, And u hicb, though I learnt it dreaming, I hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with my conscience In the |ilace where the years increase, And I try to remember the future, In the land where time will cease ; ADd I know of the future Judgment, How dreadful soe'r it be, Thai to sit alone with xy conscience Will be judgment enough fob he !
