In the "'Nineteenth Century- Review" Mr Sinnett expounds the peculiarities of the astral plane. One chief charraiteristi is that on th?"iiatral light" ((whbiah'is the pervad ing medium of the astraidl pla? thlere are projected images of.thing*dlead and gone, buildings that have crumbled away, bygone streets with the moving piouures of the in habitants that once lived in thlian. In this sphere qulsquisque oos -ptimne - aumes, even down to hansom cabs and shop-windows : " Scientific inquiry carried tn behind the scenes of nature soon enables us to realise that not only is there a ' ghost' or, .toy use, a better term, an astaal counterpart-.-of every coat and trousers that ever existed, but of every shop-window and paving-stone, and every unmket cart and hansom cab, or atom of mutter in whatever form it may be thought of. A hideous characteristic of this state of.. beiag is that the hatred, malieu and :orulty,, the thirst to do evil to enemies, and aspirations of every degraded kind which rage through the fevered physical world are constantly thking shape in distressing ways on the astral plane of nature, where everyone of them finds sume too receptive medium for its impress. The evil thoughts of men do not iserely'tako shape as painful records of malevolenceliat actually unite themselves with some forms of life with which the istral pliane is teeming." AUll this, adds Mr Sinnett, may be verified by "the astral sense. of any adequately qualified observer."-" Westminster. Gazetto."
