Gems from Poets. SITTING BY THE FIRE. [AN OLD MAN'S REVERIE.] GLEESOME children were we not ? Sitting by the fire, Ruddy in its glow, Sixty summers back-- Sixty years ago ! Laughing voices filled the room; Oh! the songs we sung ! When the evenings hurried by-- When our hearts were young. Pleasant faces watched the flame-- Eyes illum'd with mirth And we told some merry tales, Sitting round the hearth ! Sitting by the fire, Ruddy in its glow, Sixty summers back -- Sixty years ago! Beauty stooped to bless us once ! Sitting by the fire, Happy in its glow, Forty summers back-- Forty years ago ! Words of love were interchang'd, Maiden hearts we stole; And the light affection throws, Slept on every soul ! Oh ! the hours went flying past-- Hours of priceless worth; But we took no note of Time, Sitting round the hearth ! Sitting by the fire, Happy in its glow, Forty summers back Forty years ago! Oh ! the nights--the nights we spent, Sitting by the fire, Cheerful in its glow, Twenty summers back Twenty years ago ! If the days were days of toil Wherefore should we mourn, There were shadows near the shine-- Flowers with the thorn ! And we still can recollect Evenings spent in mirth-- Fragments of a broken life-- Sitting round the hearth! Sitting by the fire, Cheerful in its glow, Twenty summers back-- Twenty years ago ! Barren Age, and wither'd world ! Oh ! the dying leaves, Like a drizzling rain, Falling round the roof-- Pattering on the pane ! Frosty Age, and cold, cold World !-- Ghosts of other Days, Trooping past the faded fire, Flit before the gaze ! Now the wind goes soughing wild, O'er the whistling Earth ; And we front a feeble flame, Sitting round the hearth ! Sitting by the fire, Watching, in its glow, Ghosts of other Days Trooping to and fro! HENRY KENDALL.
