Race Meetings. South Australian Jockey dub. Second Dat. Saturday. m*v q The South Australian Jockey Club meeting, which had been postponed from Thursday on account of unfavourable weather, was continued at Flemington course on Saturday The attendance was fairly satisfactory. Amongst the visitore were his Excellency the Governor and suite. Neither the hill nor the fiat was overcrowded, though the attendance in each place was larger than on Saturday last. In the morn ing the weather prospects were not reassuring, but it re mained fine, though dull throughout the day. The racing commenced with the Maiden Plate, and though sixhorsei were on the card for the event only three of them were saddled. Of these Hampstead was thought tit Tia ilia f\\*af fit a t\Ai\m hami* sw l*r_ rm_ « ? wv a*w maw wwd«| uau w-«M wgixig \JIX Ulirj, XuO Dlff event of the meeting— the Adelaide Cap— wu the next on the card. There was a good deal of delay at tha post, chiefly caused by the misdemeanours of Plausible Anchorite, and Conjecture. In the case of the latter Mr! Watson was of opinion that the jockey, Moore, was to blame.' and he was subsequently suspended from riding for three months for disobedience at the post Shortly after the start Hobart lost his rider, and as the lad fell right amongst the legs of a score of horses, his escape from serious Injury seemed little short of a miracle, but he was able to rise and walk to the fence as soon as the horses had passed. Tha earlier part of the race is best described by saying that from the starting point near the upper end of the lawn right round to the scraping sheds, tht lead was held in torn by Lantern, Conjecture, Prosaetheus, and Hazard. Coming round the turn into the straight, Britisher was taken to the front, and Anchorite was also brought into a forward position. Britisher wu first in the straight, and at this point the race seemed con fined to the Ballarat horse, with Anchorite and Lord Wil ton, the latter having kept a front position all through the race. When racing commenced in earnest, Britisher fell back, and the struggle was left to Lord Wilton and Anchorite. Halfway down the straight both Sardius and Plausible tried to join issue, but it was evident that neither of them could catch Lord Wilton, who, galloping gamely under tbe whip, won by a clear length from Anchorite, who'in turn had a leid of half a length from Sardius as they shot past the post. Immediately behind the placed horses were Plausible, Britisher, Lantern; but nearly a dozen finished in from of Conjecture. Lori Wilton was backed to win a frirsuke, but evidently not by the public, for there was a solemn silen e in the paddock as the horse weighed. The time was fubr than that recorded for Malua in the same race at Adelaide last year. The fact that Fusilier was left to wale over for the Selling Hurdle Race practically limited the number of the events of the day to four. Fuiilier, on weighing in, was put up for auction, according to the conditions of the race, but no one would advance on the upset price of 103 sovs., and the horse remained with the owner.

The autumn meeting of the South Australian *«*?* Club was concluded on the Flemington course this after noon. The weather was charming, but the attendance Ut short of the two previous days, and so the fire» race was announced to a limited number _-» spectators. The vice-regal suite in attendance ui uded Lady Robinson and Miss Robinson, from Adelaide. The racing opened with the Second Hur lie Race, for vrtucn a small field of five went to the post, the same number being absentees. The betting underwent considerable chops and changes amongst Echo, Minerva, and Tattler. The last named ultimately went ouj fs«uui(s. Thq actual renal' tested between Tattier ma Ecbo, but Hewitt on Tattler, ?bout 20 jards from home, appeared to hold the Ballarat horse too cheap, for although the man seemed to have her a bit in band, a determined dash made by Corrigan just landed Echo a ban half-head winner on the jx-Bt. Seventeen weighed out for the Ladies' Bracelet, with £emoi as favourite at 6 to 1, and he wu backed to win a good stake. Later on a heavy commission was put into the market for Lantern. He left for the port most fancied, Kemus having receded to 8 to L The race to all intents and purposes was cut out for Remus, judging from the easy manner in which be won the Nursery Handicap with 7st. 41b. last Saturday. Cracknell came at the proper time, end although East Lynne looked a winner all over up the straight the Pytchley Lodge colt von cleverly by a neck. The bracelets were presented to the nomi nators of the first and second horses by- Lady Robinson. The Steeplechase dwindled down to a miserable field of three bones. Colebrook bad the call in the betting. The race was ran at a slow pace the first time round, Blackthorn making pretty well all the running into the straight, when be died away, and Songster and Colebrook had the finish to themselves. The favourite, however, immediately had the race in hand in the final run, and won in a canter by four lengths. The whole three jumped beautifully from first to last The Cbarity Piste saw five go to the post. This number was reduced through Titania bolting. She galloped all the way back to the saddling paddock, and unshipped her jockey at the entrance gate. The race turned out a good thing for First Pop, starting at a nice price of 2 to 1. On being put up to auction the filly was brought in at the npset price of 150 sovs. The meeting was brought to a conclusion by the South Australian Jockey Club Handicap. A score sported *Qk, and Britisher was the favourite at 7 to 1. The winner came from the outside division in St. John, who was most prominent all through, and ran a fast race in 2 minutes 8$ seconds. He defeated Britisher by 2| lengths. The following are the re sults:— Second Htj&dle; Race— 1} mile. Mr. R. G. Talbof « Echo, lOst. lib. (Corrigan) ... ... ... 1 Mr. R. Phillips' Tattler, 9st. 121b.
