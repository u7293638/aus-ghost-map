WHITE FOI^BRIDESIMIDS. Thelatest fashionable croza for white, both in season and out of season, is not at its happiest when applied to bridesmaids' frocks. The bride and her maidens now look like a flock of silent ghosts or a flock of pigeons as they walk up the aisle of some dim old parish church, and for one moment one is perfectly bewildered with them, taking them for brides all going to undergo the ordeal of marriage at the same moment. It's most fashionably correct, no doubt, for tbe bride to have her maidens bo attired, but very ill advised, as she and her satin train and lace would look far more no ticeable and charming were they in some color that, by contrast, made her uttei whiteness the more delightful. ?
