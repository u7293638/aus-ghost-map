SATURDAY'S CRICKET. [By Onlooker.! ADELAIDE OVAL. Seldom has more interesting cricket been witnessed 011 tha Adelaide Oval than on Saturday, when both of the matches concluded resulted in remarkably elo3e finishes, The weather also .was oharming for the batsmen, while the trundlers and fieldsmen melted visibly. The score of 171 set the Hindmarsh lookti a comparatively easy task for them, as they have been showing good form this season, and it was anticipated thab they would gain another victory with a few wickets to spare. The Norwoods ranks were greatly weakened by the absence of- Geo. Giffen, who has not yet got over his ailment. He strained himself rather severely in Sydney, I am told. But the Norwoods have improved wonderfully as a bowling team, aud, as the results showed on Saturday, they have nob to depend upon one man as they did a season or more ago. The Hindtnarsh were unfortunate iu having to play two men short, Noel and Brideson being the absentees. Wish A. H. Jarvis out for 2 and the total at 6 matters looked "dickey, but when tbe board showed two tor 12 and then three for 16 it was never anticipated that the Hind marsh would have the ghost of a chance. A. R. Jarvis, C.- Nitsehke, and R. Evans, three of the team's batsmen gone, only five more wickets to fall, and 155 wanted to save the match. Fred Jarvis and Allan Edwards stooped the procession by carrying the total to 66. The former was as usual far too anxious. He was hitting in fine style a3 his innings advanced, scoring 17 runs off one over from GreeD, while Ed wardi brought the total uo to 21 off the six balls. This was pretty tall work, but Jarvis could not keep steady after such rapid scoring, ana lunging out at .a ball from Lyons he gave Jack Woods {sub.) a diffi cult chauoo, and later put the bail into Green s hands. King partnered Edwards, but the fourth wicket was down for 66, thelatter being clean bowled by Lyons, and fi ve were out for 74\. Ninety-seven were wanted and only three wickets to go. King batted well for his 20 ruus, while the promising young batsman, Holbrook, made his 22 when they were badly wanted with plenty of confidence. Six wickets were down for 106, King fatling a victim to Harry Blinman, who effected a good catch off O'Brun. When Holbrook and Mudie gob together the scene changed some what. Tbe score mounted steadily, and 'as both men were showing good form it seemed probable that they would cover the Norwoods'tally. Holbrook was out by a smart catch by Blinman, and the total stood at 125. Ton-kins was the last man to bab, but as he has only scored three ducks this season the match >was considered over. _ Mudie now warmed up to his work, as his only ohance was to hit out with his very uncertain partner. Poms came one ou cop of the other, and the Norwoods began to despair as 160 was reached and passed. The excite men t was now intense, as while Tomkms was batting very nicety and making an occasional run the Englishman was batting as freely and well as he does at praotice. The stunted cricket he had shown in previous matches was abandoned, and his hitting was well timed and vigorous. His life was, however, a short and merry one, as ho skied a ball into the d6ep field, and it was caught by Hack (sub.). Lyons was the most successful truudler with three for 32, while the best fielding in the match was done by Blinman. The Adelaides -had made 150 for nine wickets when the match was abandoned on the ■■first day of play, and only five more runs were added. E. Leak and McOarron were the first; to lead off for the Australs, but with the total standing at 11 McOarron made a vicious swipe at a ball front'Winnall,-'which got past; his guard. Peters, Maclcie, Hack, S. Leak, land W. Lynch then went in and I returned in rapid succession, Delaney and I Haldane being so destructive that six wickets went down for 46. In the meantime beak had been batting remarkably well. He hit out all round tha wicket, and while he was vigorous in dealing with anything of a loose character he exercised good judgmeiib. His leg hitting was very neat and mosb effective. When he was ioincd by Kowe the T>tospect3 of the Australs brightened up considerably, and the century was quickly passed. Both men were Bbowmg good form, and it was nob till 117 was leached thab Leak gave a chance to itosman atmid-oli, which he failed to negotiate. At 130 Rowe was caught by WiiiualLotl Haldane, and Leitch filled the breach. At 146 Leak gave Tardif a chance off Haldaue, which the left-hander secured. Leak's innings was an invaluable one to the • Australs, but it did not secure them victory. • He only gave one chance during his stay at the wickets, which extended over three hours and a quarter. Leitch and Eord earned the total up to 151, and with only four ruus wanting to tie Leich was easily caught. KENSINGTON OVAL. " South Adelaide v. Poet Adelaide. ^ The match between the South Adelaides and Ports, which was began on theKensington Oval ou December 23, was brought to a con clusion on- .Saturday afternoon,^ when the former won by three wickets and 12 runs. It was not ■ surprising, considering the heat on Saturday, that the attendance was not large. When the' game was adjourned the lorts had made 125 -for the loss of eight wickets,- but , they did not succeed in adding anything to their total as Jones quickly settled the matter by clean bowling both Everett and Rundle. The Souths opened somewhat badly,- their first wioket fell for 28 their second for 28, aud their third for 31. Bennett and Baiians, however, turned the tide in favor of the blue-and-whites, as both hatted brillantly and were not oub when the Porta' score had been passed by 12 runs. Benuett made 60 and Ballans 43. In bowling Jones was very destructive, as his six wickets only cost 21 runs. Gowling for the seasiders seeured: two for 32. The following ate the scores NOKWOOD V.
