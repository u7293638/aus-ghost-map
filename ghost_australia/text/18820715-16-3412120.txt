STJMM-âJRY PER R.M.S. ROMA, SINCE our last summary the weather has been very mild for the season of the year Frosts have been experienced in numbers of places, Town these were succeeded by days of fine warm weather very suggestive of early spring. The e have been a few show ci s during the month, but nothing likcheacy Tam, worth ïsnoxrgrcatlj needed in some parts to furnish the requisite" water supply in the southern districts of the colony Indeed hero in the metropolis we -resideing in some degree, as the Board of Water or oil is finding the Enoggei a reservoir unusually low, have deemed it necessary to refuse any longer to allow the sheets to "be watered from their mains At this season strong westerly winds frequently Wow for several d js together, and the effect on unwatered dusty streets may be imagined It is, how ex ci, some consolation to know that the Corporation are arranging to pump water from the river to allay this nuisance, and the Bond of Waterxx or ks law mg obtained a loan of 280 000 from the Cox ern mont have begun work upon a new reservoir at Gold Creek, which will do am an area of 2471) acres, and will is axe a storage capacity of about 350 millie ns of gallons This, however, will not be available till the end of 1883, by which date it will no doubt, be much needed In this connection it may be noted that the subject of water conservation is now beginning to attract the attention which it deserves in this colony as well as in some others of the group, and it is understood that the Government are about to introduce to Parliament a bill dealing with the subject At the present time there are two portable water boring machines being exper mentally tested in different parts of the city They are both coasts acted under Victorian patents and, having been purchased by the Government, will be sent into the interior as soon as the tests are completed The Municipal Council of Roma, the present terminus of our Western railway, have for some time been boring for artesian water, and the contractor has already attained a depth of about 300ft. As yet no available water has been tapped, but the promoters of the scheme are sanguine of getting it, and are prepared to go down at least 500ft The Church of England Sx and has concluded its sittings, and has not accomplished anything very notable The chief thing which Bishop Hale and many members of the Synod aimed at doing was the creation of a tribunal such as exists in the principal dioceses of the other colonies, to take cognizance of breaches of Church discipline and ceremonial of matters affecting the moral characters of clergymen This is with his Lordship, with a few of the clergy, and with many of the last; a matter of the gravest importance The canon was speciallY directed against certain work worthy clergymen who favour vv hats c called ritualistic forms and ceremonies Many of the clergy felt very deeply on the matter, and expressed themselves strongly The Rev James Gilbertson said that he was an old man and had no private means, but if the c mon was passed he would at once leave the diocese The Rev Thomas Jones, for men of Brisbane for many years more I recently of Hobart, and now of Toowoomba, a most estimable gentleman, said he would at once leave the Sx nod, even if he risked his position in the diocese, if the canon was passed The principal objections to the new law, if passed, were that the Church here would no longer hold the same position in respect to the English Church that it does now that the Bishop would be putting into commission a power he possessed by x ii use of his office, that the clergy, while quite willing to submit to their Bishop's i cling in all matters, would not consider a delegated author led to a tin burial binding upon them, and last, but by no means least, that it would be very unwise for an j machines to be made by which matters of a ritual could be controlled until the Royal Commission sitting in England had given a specific report upon what should be deemed a breach of a trial of pr each bed eel emonial Mr Jones, fortunately, has substantial provision of this xv oil I Jgcai independent of fishpond, and, therefore, can afford to have opinions of his own and to insist upon them. The only other matter worth noting was the adoption of a resolution making it imperative on the clergyman of every parish to endeavour to establish a branch of the Church of England Temperance Society Some opposed it, arguing that such work ought to be altogether optional with the clergy, and others on the ground that the strict principle of teetotalism ought not to be insisted upon However, it was earned, but of course its results will greatly depend on the zeal with which it is applied But the really great matter for consideration with this Child ch Pal hument was, as is often the case in secular Parliaments, "ways and means The Anglican Church is undoubtedly the worst supported in the colony Its ministers receive, as a rule, very small stipends as compared with the ministers of the principal Nonconformist churches, and, literally speaking, have to beg for Whateley do get The Roman Catholic clergy Hellenic also X i j poorly paid, but that is not because of the 1 city being as generous on the contrary, they are a wonder fully Tibet is in putting down the come , but under the late episcopal rule the theory was held that the interests of the Church would Ijest he served by laying up wealth in the shape of enormous purchases of land lines will probably be altered under the new regime, and the Church of the present receive more consideration than the Church of the future In connection with the proposal to establish branches of the Church of England temperance Society, it may be noted that already two most successful meetings have been held in For htude V illcx, Brisbane, and at Too xv oomba, and the movement promises to become popular, as the evils of intemperance are but too clearly apparent to all On Sunday, 18th June, the Right Rev Dr Dunne, lately appointed Bishop of the Brisbane diocese, was consecrated to his high and important office The Most Rev Dr Vaughan, Archbishop of Sydney, the metropolitans of the pi ox nice, was consecrating pu late on the occasion, assisted by the Right Rev Dr Murray, Bishop of Maitland, NSW, the Right Rev Dr Lanigan, Bishop of Court in a, NSW, and the Right Rev Dr Cam, Bishop of Rockhampton The day will long be i emem bered by the Roman Catholic pot son of the community The ceremony was em led out with strictest attention to detail, but of course lacked much of the pomp and chemist ince' which would intrusted to the gi ander and impressiveness of a similar ceremony in the older Southern parts of Australia. It was quite lengthy enough, however, to satisfy the most exacting on that score The sermon on the occasion was preached by the Right Rev Dr James Murray, who selected for his text words from the 28th verse of the 20th Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles -'"Take heed to yourselves and to your whole (lock, w hen em the Holy Ghost has pledged Bishops to rule the C Inn eli of God, which he had pin (East d with his own blood" Axeij eloquent discourse was tendered by the light I did did prelate his Lordship Bishop Dunne assisted at vespers in full parties in and at nine littion was uri i nt Archbishop Vaughan delivered a powerful address at the evening service full of pure tin and Christ mu earnestness in address with it vi, informed mind), too bad turn in O/uoinsliind Di Dunnes ii mu ii to the bishopric pleases people of all sluicing shot He is most earnest in his own work and will when he ( n work with in the 'y of the olive i c line In an matter same land that it all and we hear is the s la t j lit now I i i of 1 visit than he will not, unless it be a matter of ion s no (stand against them A Protestant U 11th may presented him with an pistol in an v built about 150 and th Cithohtsof Just so and after him with his or) her insignia of the, consisting of a jewelled mitre, n mItci gilt crown, a pectoral cross and chain of gold and a bugle, or ceremonial candlestick, of silver During the consecration ceremony the father al was good deal, and, as the major ity of the seats meant 10s each paid towards the xv o k of finishing the front of the building, this ought to be on hand very soon Indeed for the ct credit of the -cong legation there should be no longer delay, for the cathedral at present looks out udlymoiolike a man than a new building \- issued licking the dignity and consideration age obtains, even the coping stone and symbolic it crosses c wanting. Dr C mi, who as consecrated to the diocese of Rockhampton, in Sydney, was installed in his new See on the Sunshine preceding the ceremonies above mentioned Since that time he has been presented by hisBusbane and Darling Downs friends withdrew complimentary ad(dress and a bank slip of deposit showing a consider able sum of money to have been pi took to his credit a sum which will be further aug mented, and will amount altogether to about 1300 During the visit of the Roman Catholic Church dignitaries the Hon Thomas MUvviaith (the Premier) entertained them at dinner at his house, Auchenflower There was a large party by present, including leading colonists of x mous denominations. bazaar in aid of AllHdloxxs Convent was opened by the Governor on the 8th instant, and proved highly attractive In addition to the gifts cccix ed I i our local pah ones, some x ci handsome contributions to the but tax xv ei e received from abroad, a number of ladies and gentlemen of rank both in England and on the Continent having aided in the work. The annual ball at Government House, which is held to celebrate the anniversary of her Majesty 's by the lay, is the opening of a season of mild dissipation During the month public balls have been given an aid of the Hospital and the Convalescent and Benevolent Home are spectacle There have been many public concert, that of the Brisbane Musical Union being a rather brilliant life up These, together with the many private entertainments which mark our dancing season, have rendered Bris hand very lively socially speaking-of late, the long "winter evenings have also been marked by an unusually large number of pictures, on a variety of topics Two more of the School of Arts scenes have been given since our list sunuuarj-aiamely, that by Dr Pren- tice on " Manilla and his Critics," and by Mr E P. Field on "The Structure of the Lungs" "The Modern Newspaper," President Garfield," and "Work." have each formed the subject of an evening's pleasant discourse. Mr H C Stanley, the Engineer in Chief of Southern Railways, has obtained a neceleelrest in the shape of twelve months' leave of absence, after sex enteen j cars' arduous labour in the service of the colony. He has left for Europe by the P. and O. mail, and will return by way of America The British India mail steamers, and the supplementary boats which the company find it necessary to run, continue to land a large number of immigrants on our shores, but not so many but that all are absorbed into the population, and finding employment at remunerative rates The Camorta, sister ship of the Compta, came up the river anddischaigedher cargo alongside the Bush mc wharf, but the Roma, the last mail steamer, has remained in the Bay A letter from the managers of the company to the Premier, recently published, shows that every effort is being made to meet the wants of our trade and that, in addition to four boats to be released from the Indian trade by new ones 1 lately built, the company are having two new vessels constructed specially for the Queensland service, and fitted for the accommodation of emigrants and for the conveyance of frozen meat The number of remittance immigrants aiming here has greatly increased since the plan of bringing them out by steam vessels was adopted During May there were 100 acre grants nominated by their friends in this colony, and the number for June closely approximated 500, a rate which of itself would be sufficient to fill the monthly mail steamer The Mai mc Board inquiry into the wreck of the A.S.N.

He was warmly received by Mr Male, the accountant a young fellow, aged about 23 years", who fired four shots at the intruder, out though they had not the effect of inflicting any wounds they were enough to cause him to cry out in "Enough ' 111 put down my shooting now This candidate for notoriety as a robber was then at a ested, but has been pronounced by a medical man to be "As mad as a Milich June Young Male"s pluck has been generally commended The Day Dawn gold robbery at Charters Towers appears to have been a very daring piece of a scanty A ci fishing had been completed at the Excelsior mill, lately purchased by the Day Dawn Company, and there were four or five men employed about the premises The retort was on the line some distance away from the null, and contained about 1000 oz of amalgam, representing between 100oz and "10oz of gold About 2 o'clock on the morn nig of 10th June the watchman, who had been minding the pot, xv cut over to the tables and began to scrape them After a few minutes he went high and the victory was gone Since that time the police have been busily miles coming to trace the plunder and the thieves, but apparently without success, until a few days ago, when a man named Silas Pddv was arrested on board the steamer 1 living, just as she was about lax mg Tow is idle for the South, on a charge of being concerned in the robbery A huge sum of money was found on the prisoner On Wednesday last Edward Thomas, a man lately from New Zealand, was also wanted at Chai tot s Towers for the same offence
