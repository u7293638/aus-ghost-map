* GRI1E," ,T THE VZCTORIA THEATRIPe Ma. A. J. INaeIs's drama "Crime" wes produced at, the Victoria Theatre last night to a poorer house than the production de served. The plot we published yes terday, and there is sufflicient merit in Mr. Inglis's efforb to make it rank with many good modern productions, and b1 classed far higher than pieces of the " Youth" and "Manlkind" school. There is relevancy, sequence, and a sustanuod insterest; and the disjointed tableaux so characteristic of many plays which owe their origin rather to the talent of a mechanist than the genius of the dramatist -aro..lappily, absent, giving place to a harmonious whole. But there are faults. â€¢T'lere is "gag" in pbundance; threr is an .attempt to split the ears of the grountlings with played-out claptrap, and in some of the sconos-notably one of the dances in the camp scene; the introdtution of the aboriginal au natural~ in the last a'ot? and the harping on the poor joke about the trousors--thore is positive indoloaoy. If success is to he insured fbr Mr. Inglis's play, two or three matters ihust be attoendod to. Soveral members of the orchestra should be hanged, or their instruments pawned; an infant phenomenon, who sings flat and looks unhappy, should be sent to bed; and the intoloeraly long waits should be shortened. Then we may see a large and enthusiastio audience applauding real merit. Last night, owing t.o the weird vagaries of the instruments of torturojustbeforo the footlights, the singing in the diggers' camp soene was spoilt, andt one of Mr. Inglis' a own particular opic poems was rendered incomlprehonusiblo. A little judicionus altoration, amendment, and l,'pping; arid "Crimo" should prove one 0o the best sensational pieces yet pIroduoed at 'the "Vie" 'she various sensational scenes, with wvhloh the piece is liborally Illed, were ra. oeived with ropeated applause the climax of the thtd act, whore the hero, Coecil Le Roy Mr. A., L.

Mr. Inglis, as tholhero, slhowed thantho had written the part for himself with a oaroful and not .over-strained con ?eption of his own ability His Ceoi'l Lo Roy was very well acted indeed. But why he evoara that flaxon wig which gives hbn no 'mcre forehead than a monkey or .why he powders himself as white as a ghost, we uanuot understand. In the final soetne his noting was full of pathos and foolbjig, the lights and shades of a difoiulr, character obeinog intelligenutly so portrayed. Mr. J. E., Thorpo as thlio villain, had a most thankless'part, but performed it in the aetrofil mannor that is always noticeable in this goetleman's imporsonatlons.
