Clntdrcu's ®tnhmu. THE ENCHANTED FOREST. Once opon & time there lived in Hungary, on the shores of a lake, a boy and s girL There was a great wood aU round the lake, and they lived Ji£lw,een. the wood and the I^tf*. The boy*B name was Fritz, and tie girl's Vera. Their another and lather had died when they were young, and left them' to take care of themselves. It -was not very hard to get lood, as there were plenty of bernea and fruit growing in the wood, and f-sh in the lake. They were all alone, as no one could come through the wood, some parts of which were enchanted. Many unfortunate knights had tried to come, bat had always disap peared no one knew where : but it was sup posed that they had been seized and carried off by a Ticked magician who lived there in his castle. Where Fritz and Vera lived there were no goblins and ghosts, except good ones, as Fritz's father had cast a magic spell over their part of the wood, and they were able to live ia piece. The evil spirits had tried to break the magic -spell which had been thrown over the children, but never could. They revenged themselves, when they found that they could not break the spell, by seizing all mortals who came to their part of the w-ood, thoagfa they could not always kill them. One day Fritz went out to get wood. It was a lovely day, though cold. Fritz got a good load of wood, bat he thought he would not go home just yet, bat take n little trait on his own account. So he put down his wood under a tree, marked the tree., and then went on. He bad gone a good way, and was thinking of turning home, when he heard a sound of sobbing. Fritz wondered what it was, and thought he would go and see. Si he grasped his axe firmly in his hand and ad vanced cautiously. There, sitting on the ground, with her face in her hands, was o young girl, weeping. Shu lifted her head when ehe heard fritz, and he taw tk&t; she was very beautiful. ' What's the matter ♦' asked Fritz. 'Ob! said the girl, ' I have lost all my goats. They were feeding on the mountain*, and something frightened them awav into this forest. I followed them here, and now I have lost my way.' ' Can I help you ?' asked Fritz. ' Yen : if you will come with me out of this wood I should be very glad. It is a good dis tauuc, but it is early yet.' Thev had walked a pood way without speaking, when Fritz said. ' We are near your cottage now, aren't we?' and turned round to her. But sUe hail dtsapuarcd. ' Why, where ban she gone, I wonder?' said rntz in surprise. ** I never saw herco ** Theu the thoogbt flashed across his mm.l that she was a spirit, and had Iwen sent to bring him into the enchanted [-art of the forest. 'Well.' said he to himself, ' this is a nice state of things ! How am I to get home, 1 wonder ? Well, I suppose I may as well start, and try to get home as quick as I can' so he picked up his axe and started. Suddenly he heard strange, unearthly noises. He looked up, and saw hundreds and tboa they «.1| vanished, and he heard frhpn* laugh* ing a pood distance away. Then he heard1 a rustling sound clow; to him. He looked round and saw a great tall spirit. ' Who are you ?' Fritz asked. *' I have come to help you,' answered the spirit. 'I am one of the good fairies that live in the wood. My family are nearly ex tinct in this part of the world, owing to the magician having banished us for having helped poor people who got lost here ; but there are still & good, many of us on tlie other side.' Fritz was rather doubtful as to whether this was really a good spirit, .as he hod been mitrfakp'fl once. So lie asked him some charm questions which none but the good spirits could say. Tbe Bpirit answered them cor rectly, and Fritz was sure then. Fritz asked him where the magician lived. ' We are near bis castle now,' said the spirit. Then be went on tilling him that the ma gician had all the mortals that he liad not killed shut up in the castle in the form of birds and beasts of prey, He had taken all the gold and treasures they had. Fritz asked if the treasures could be got at. 11 Yes,' answered the spirit ; ** but it would be very hard. Nothing could be done witb -' But,' said Fritz, ' we could get all tbe charms if we got all the good spirits to help us, couldn't we ?' ' We have been trying ft long time,' an swered the spirit, ' but we could not do it without a mortal to help us.' ' Well,' said Fritz, ?'- I would like to re lease the prisoners if you will help me?' '* Very well,' tbe spirit said ; we will come They were near tbe cottage now, eo Fritz fta.|d *hhfl.t thpRpirffivinld gtt tiianb intr hiinforllis kindness. '? Oh, no ! that's nothing/ said the spirit ; 'we would gladly have helped any mortal that neeeded oar protection, but we could not ; and we coold not always be there.*' Meanwhile Vera was very frightened, and was thinking that something mnst have hap pened to Fritz, so when he came home she -was very glad. Fritz told her all, where he had been, and everything, and they had tea. The next day Fritz went to the border of the enchanted forest to wait for the spirit. There he eaw an enonnously-great, hideously - ugly man with a long beard and great staring eyes. His month was open, and he was gnashing bis great teeth with rage. Fritz's heart sank, for it was the great *''£iHnn *' So yon are here, my fine fellow,' -die magician m-ir1 chuckling ; ** I have you at last. Now, yon have to come along, and I am going to kill you.** 11 On, no,' said Fritz, ' you are not going to get me so quick,' and he made » cot at him with his axe ; to his surprise the axe went right through the p^gi-rifln without hurting nlm^ and he suddenly turned round and grasped hold of him. The next thing that Fritz knew, the mftgi'-fan was h^Hing him by the hair and flying through the air with him. Presently he stopped and put 'Fritz down, and took out as ooormoas knife, or scythe, for it looked more like the last named article,. lhan a knife, and was just going to kill him, when suddenly the spirit, along with some other spirits, came and rushed np,and took airay the magician's knife, and took possession of him. 'Now/* the first spirit, Fritz's friend, said, 'you must come and show us where the pri soners are kept, and their money.' The old magician very solkly led them to a. great oak tree ; there was a hole under the oak tree, and the magician put down his hand and took out three cabinets. ' Now,' be said, 'the first of these cabineta has copper in it, the second silver, and the third gold.' Fritz took them and pnt them in Ljb pocket, and then they went to the castie, and the old magician told them where the prisoners were. After they had turned the birds and beasts into men and women again, the spirit told Fritz how he had just managed to save him by coming in the right time. Tbe spirit had gone to the border of the enchanted forest along with his brothers, the other spirits, just after the magician had taken Fritz, and tLey saw the magician flying along, and so they went in hot haste to the charmed place where the old goblin was. Fortunately, the goblin had gone out, so they managed to get, the charms easily. Then they went as fast as they could to the place wkere the magi cian and Fritz were, for they knew the spot, as the magician generally killed bis victims there, and just managed to get there in time to save Fritz. Among the people that they 6aved was a young prince. He said that he had loved a young princess, but she would not marry him unless he went and killed the magician |-v himself. He would not do it at firk, hut at last he \rent. Then tome of tbe goblins caught him, and took him to the magician, who shut-him up and would not let him out. All the other prisoners had stories to tell' which would be too long to tell here. Fritz gave all their money tu them, and kept the rest himself. He cut down all the forest, and fixed up the castle w that lie could live in it ; and all tlie prisoners who hail lost their homes came there to live. The spirits and goblin? all went away when tbe forest was cut down. At last the prince found that the princess waa dead, bo lie came ami married Vera, and they all lived happy after.
