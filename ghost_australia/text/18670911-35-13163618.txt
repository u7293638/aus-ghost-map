WATER POLICE COURT. TUESDAY. BEFORE the Water Police Magistrate, with Mr. M. Levy and Mr. T. Dangar. Of four persons found drunk in the streets, three were fined 5s., or to be imprisoned two days, and the other 10s., or three days in gaol. William Mildwater, 50, carpenter, was brought up by senior constable Carton on suspicion that he was of unsound mind. Yesterday afternoon he met prisoner in Norton- street, Manly Beach, and prisoner then told him that he was the Holy Ghost, sent to warn people, and that the end of the world was come. He added that he had set fire by preaching the Gospel in Manly, but he did not know whether it would take. After a medical examination, Mr. Egan was of opinion that prisoner was of unsound mind, labouring under religions delusions, and that in his present state it would be unsafe for him to be allowed at large. He was remanded for a week for medical treatment.
