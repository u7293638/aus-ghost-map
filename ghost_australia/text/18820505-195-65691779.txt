SELECT POETRY. DREAMING. High up in my narrow chamber, That looks on the rocking day, I watch from iny darkening window The dim eve fade away; And I sigh for the glow and gladness Of the sunset times of yore For the thwarted aims and purposes, And the dreams that are mine no more? And oh, for the twilight meadows, And the brook of my childhood, sweet With a silver fringe of daisies, And a glimmer of hare white feet I For the twinkling lights of the village, That girdled the long green hill For the clasp of the hands that are dust tonight, And the voices that are still I While down in the thronging highways, And down in the byways low, The tide of life for ever Beats dizzily to and fro, Like the city of a vision, And the shadows of a dream, The dreary blank of endless walls, And the flitting faces seem With the wan night leaning over From her spectral height of stars, And the haggard ghost of a moon behind The twilight's sullen bars And far in the purple offing, Where the glitter of sails bath been, The vast grey apparition Of the sea-fog toiling in !
