We Will not follow Mr. Blnck into tlie labyrinths of repetition, but in readingr the.j'Waikerston --'-'iv9s; we are at a loss to| comprifcend why h^ should have so mucl' to . say upon th^ fostfring and pampering of»TpsnT/cn ?indnstrieB— just as jif the industries of Cecrops and the politics.of the QJueens land Athens had anyjnatural a^fnity with those of Mackav.

By making such comparison's for the amusement jof his audience, he was diverting the object of the meeting for other purposes than political.- But this telegram may turn o'ut.tobo a white elephant. But man is mortal, . and d orr is human. ! Mr. Black in his 'VValkerston address,- , reiterated his independence of principle and Southern interests. He gave la fuller explanation of his -policy than heretofore, and in dulged in facts andi figures like an old coioniftl: 'statesman. The' improvement ofi.roads and other local public works were touehed upon in ' a eandid manner. Hb thought that.Sthe advocation of financial ? separation j was now useless since a ? Local !

The railway policy, erf the GoTernment and the Opport'ion— a« &r; as it was revealed by i£T. Vtcllwraitb at Bundaberg, and Mr. yycrossan at Charters Towers — was kiJly'at. variance with the views of it. Black. He would only introduce a railway tax 'in railway districts, and oppose any proposition to tax the majority ' for the. benefit of the few. The railway policy o£ the Government IB to construct branch^ railways through settled, districts in amalgamation witn trunk lines already', in existence ; and the policy of the Opposition is tocon strutt trunk lines through the interior of. the colony, from this standpoint Mr. I Black favours jthe Government railway policy when j we consider bis answer to MK Ball respecting a railway to the foot of theiEange. The speaker was in favour of the proposed education al nr*liAmp -nf ''Riflhnn WnnrlinnHA. Ifltelv propounded before his clergy and laity in Melbourne, which, i upon being put, was resolved in the negative by his own people. The Utopian! scheme of the worthy and learned Bishop waB revolu tionary and impracticable upon the face of it We would rather receive Vic torian capital than' Victorian ideas into the-! district. Melbourne' politics' must! be taken with a 'grain of. salt- by Queensianders, and we fail to be con verted into the educational system of Sir John O'Sliannessy and other ' ad vanced thinkers' down south. Things under this head are better as they are, if the compulsory clause was enforced. We agree with Mr.. Black in his views of intercolonial free [trade, with the ulterior object of paving the way for Federation. Eeciprociy with any country never works so wellas a when regulated by free trade. The flour of Adelaide is justly admitted free into this colony, and that colony should do the name with our sugar; but what about the free entry for wines, fruits, and rum ? The proper way to settle the question is to adopt free trade principles generally, or we- mast tax flour, grant a bonus for wheat, and go in for rabid protection.! 'We will have more -to say upon the qualification, of Messrs. Black and Amhunt when the latter makes his dehut for the election eering season; The Courier twits us that wo are opposed to Mr. Black in reviewing certain remarks in regard & nnff/in.iriiafA \V A VmrA nnt vat At*p\nTfiAi for either the one candidate or tbo^ other, as they have not yet given the public any enlarged review of their respective policies, TJotil they do, we decline the Boft impeachment. They are both good'mon and. true, and able abd willing to demand and obtain justice for Maekay in the Brisbane Parliament. The one will only defeat the other at the poll ; in matters of detail, which the electors are anxious to fathom. It is very unfair to the public that candidates should withhold their true colours until they . bear what the other will say. In this opinion wo aro supported by the Courier.

Another paper thinks that the Committee or sub-committee of the School of Arts are as competent 'of drawing out designs &ct; of a suitable building as 'Mr, Stanley -the Colonial Secretary. 2Tow this is,really too in considerate an assertion. We have more respect for the Committee of the School of Arts than'the writer of the paragraph in ques tion, but we would be inclined to back pro fessional gentlemen . before non-professional. .uttviu^secu uiauy luabuuctre wuere gravu mis takes were made in erecting similar public buildings,.it is only our wish that a suitable building will not be spoiled in its erection by a building Committee, or by individual members insisting npon having their own way. But the matter is 'now set at rest as the adoption -of the best design will be left in the hands of the members and subscribers. The application of the Cricket Club for the purpose of a cricket and recreation ground has been postponed by the Municipal Council pro tern. We have no objection to the proposal whatever if the grounds are open to all cricket clubs, except upon special match days when local clubs may play with ontside elevens. ' We shall be in a position to reply to an extraordinary telegram pnblished in last weed's Standard when the- next . Southern ^nl arrives. t; . ?-'- At the last meeting b£tbe Municipal Council two letters were read from ratepayers, written1 in a very disrespectful tone and having a tendancy to burlesque public business than otherwise. We would remind ratepayers that it is just as simple to write letters in a worthy manner than in another way, or all such com munications might be consigned to oblivion. It will not be long nntil the bye-laws of the Municipal Cauncil respecting the straying of goats and cattle on the streets will be re tarned from Brisbane after being confirmed by His Excellency, A subscriberiinforms us, that there are goats belonging to a neighbour of his very fond of grazing; upon his flowers and vegetables, and irrespective of^ates and fences they manage to have an 'excellent midnight Bquare feed.' He has also a nice sweet patch or grass in his yard. , Several cows penetrate the wire fences with toprails like an elephant against a brick walL Amongst the elaborate Bills passed by Parliament last session is the new Volunteer Bill,, which came into force last month. We had almost forgotten it, but we now desire to lay the gist of the said Bill before onr readers, many of whom may be deeply interested in the formation of a local volunteer corps. We are pleased to hear that most of the old members of the volunteer force will stick to their colours in the hour of danger under the new regulations, since tue nrst of Uctober last all volunteers most serve one year during which no resignation will be accepted, but old members if disatisfied with the. new will Bill have the option to resign before the 1st of January next. All previous commissions aro now cancelled unless the officer has at tended drill regularly and is competent to pass an examination ' required by the new Act. Non-commissioned ofiioers will bo appointed by the Colonal-commandant, each corps has the power to frame its own bye-laws, and tha capitation allowance amounts to £3 to every qnalified volunteer. The volnnteer force will be under the Mutiny Act, and the Governor and Commander- in-chief may call ont the forces for actual military service if necessary. This Queensland Army will be called out for annual traing six days at Easter, and will be entitled to six days pay. like the militia and yeomanry at home. We hardly think' the New Act is harsh, because if the colony has to pay for a 'defence force, it must not be composed 'of fire and fallbacks.' Ik reference to the recent statement in the 2W«jr«p* newspaper respecting the state of the sugar crops at Maekay, we are in a posi tion to state that the information was not supplied by any resident in the district, but by a gentleman in Brisbane. Newspapers in lite of themselves, will be misinformed about distant localities now and then,' and from what we know of the high honour of tbo Telegraph, we are certain it would not publish any information incorrect if it was aware of it According to the latest estimate the sugar crops of Maekay will yet turn ont from between six thousand and seven thousand tons this season. ' Aheetino of Cemetery Trustees was bold yesterday, in the office of Mr. G. Smith.! 'resent— Mossrs. 3. Spiller, M. 11. Black, and G. Smith.

His death occurred at .Rockhampton, and rcsnlted from fever contracted whilst employed as station muter on tha Great Northern Bailway. He leaves a wife and six children to mourn his loss. Laht Fbidav the (Jommittee of tho Presby terian Church invited all the Sunday School children, and the public generally, to a pic-nio on the Bsasb, a few miles from town. A Urge number of ohildren assembled at tho 3hurch about nine o'clock, and were conveyed in buggies, 4a, to the appointed place of pic nic. A largo number of private buggim drova down to the Beach, About 300 people were present, and all seemed to enjoy thrmaelves to their ' hearts content.' The company did ample justice to the tea, pastry, and frotte. Indeed, at the close of the day's proceeding!, whole piloi of cakes and bum were left, but wo regret that some people were so dutrdcttve with the food, provided. Several games and not were indulged in by tho ohildren. - Races were also got up which were keenly contested by tho boys and girls. Miss Julia Wheolor ?»ng a fow very nice snug« in a splendid voice.
