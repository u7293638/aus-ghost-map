ROYAL STANDARD THEATRE. Messrs. Brooks and Hargorves' Phantom Minstrels gave a performance on Saturday night at the Royal Standard Theatre. The attendance was meagre, but the performance was gone through with spirit. Miss May Connell sing "its best Marie" and was loudly cheered, and Miss Effie Morelia rendered in charm mg manner "Love at Sight." 'Iho song "Just Down the Lane," by Mr. H Overton, was amusing, and no parody by Mr. Campbell " Behind Me " was also provocative of merriment. Mr. A. Brooks sang "In Sheltered Vale." Messrs. P. Overton and B. Campbell acted as corner men, and Mr. Brooks as interlocutor. The ghost illusion during the singing of the choruses was very good. " The Haunted House " was performed at the close of the first part, and the stage seemed to be tenanted with mysterious ghosts.
