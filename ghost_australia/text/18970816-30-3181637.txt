SPORTING NEWS. THE TÜRE. NOTES \A3iD .ANTICIPATIONS. (By "Patnator.") Chestnuts filled the places in the.Ade laide Bacing Club's Grand National Steeple- - chase won hy The Trojan on Saturday. r' Mr. Harry Haines, of Watson and Haines, 263 St. George's-terrace, wlio.is not visiting the goldfields, is prepared to lay S.O. prices upon the Coolgardie Cup. Settling over the Kalgoorlie Cup and .Caulfield Grand National Steeplechase, meetings takes place at Kalgoorlie and in Perth to-day. Paul Pry was favourite at 2 to 1 against | for the Kalgoorlie Cup in the City fielders' books on Saturday. His win was a very popular one locally, and Le Var is already hotly in demand for the Coolgardie Cup, which is to be run next Saturday. In another column are given statistics regarding the successful owners, trainers, and jockays at the Kalgoorlie Cup meeting, where Mr. C. N. Kidman made a sweep of almost all the good stakes. The runner-up in the winning owners' list, Mr. " Naylor," was the recipient o£ the largest cheque over the Kalgoorlie summer meeting, in March last. The Canning Park Turf Club Company will take over the Canning ¡Racecourse on the 1st September, and will have their opening meeting on Saturday, the 11th September, this date having been applied for to the W.A. Turf Club. It is proposed to hold fortnightly meetings. », The following are the three lucky I drawers of the first threo prizes in W. I Strickland's Tattersall's Consultation on | the Kalgoorlio Cup .-Mr. Joan Coughlan, of Denmark Saw ¿ills, Albany, drew Paul | Pry, No. 4-14; Mr. E. Mundy, of Sandover and Co., Fremantle, drew Le Var, No. 2253; JMr. E. H. Hughes, of 154. Barrack street,' Perth, drew ¡Blackwood, No. 3364. Strickland's consultations on the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups aro now opon, and tickets are being freely applied for. Tho wiu of the Tasmanian-bred mare, Britomarte, in the Caulfield Grand National Steeplechase on Saturday did not suit many local followers of racing in the Eastern colonies. Dondi, ZouroS, Hayseed, Vigil, and Montrose (tho latter a compatriot of | Britomarte) were horses whose victory would have been more to the liking of local sportsmen. j KALGOORLIE RACIJTG CLUB. ANNUAL CUP MEETING. PAUL PRY WINS THE KALGOORLIE CUP. STEADFAST SCORES A DOUBLE. [Fnosr our (Special Repeesentative.J ¡Kalgoorlie, August 15. The Cup Day, the second day's racing, of the annual ? meeting held in connection with the Kalgoorlie Race Club, was a great ttuccess yesterday. The day was ushered in with a bright spring morning, but towards noon the dust began to assisrt itself and at intervals was very unpleasant indeed. However, this *| did not deter a large influx of visi- tors into the» town from all directions. As the day wore on it was estimated j that a throng ' of about 4,000 people were present. The goldfields Parliamentary representatives, were again in evidence, also a larj;e contingent from Perth, in- cluded amcingst whom were Messrs. Brook- man, E. G. S. Hare, Strickland, and I Emanuel, together with others. The ' metropolitan horse owners were repre- sented by Messrs. Kidman, S. J. Chipper, W. B. Wood, T. F. Elliott, T. O'Beirne and Rosenthal. A largo number of the fair sex grace'l tho meeting with their | presence, und it was a thousand pities that the day proved so dusty and parti- I ally spoilt what wotdd otherwise have been to thena.a most enjoyable one. The Racing. I As tho bell rang out to prepare for the I first event, the Second Hurdle Race, life was infused into the proceedings. The Provost, who reaîly looked the fittest horse in the race, although carrying the heavy impost of 13st. 31b., was immediately made favourite. As he «ntered the straight he appeared to be winning easily, bufe unfor- tunately for him there was a gap in the last hurdle, and Galant, coming with a fast run, beat him home by half a length. The second race of tile afternoon, the Boulder Mile, brought out a field often. Bain Marie, Albion and Laura vrere thought to have equal chances, and were . each at 3 to 1 with the fielders, while the actual winner, Steadfast, was at 5 to 1. Steadfast, who seems to have regained some of his old form, came very fast from the entrance to the straight,.. and won .easily at the finish. i In the Paddock. After the disposal of the Boukïer-Mile,, an adjournment was made to the bird- cage, where the Cup candidates were being eagerly scanned by their respective admirers. Le Var, who appeared to -be the equine hero of the paddock, had a Jarge circle of friends. His condition was fault- less, being bright and muscular, with a skin which shone like satin, a true sign of , good health, reflecting credit on his pains- taking trainer, P. Bolger. Paul Pry was the next to come under the criticism of the onlookers. This horse looked big and strong, his deep girth and round ! barrel conveying the impression that ha: | would carry his top weight and fight out. the finish of the mile and a half. Old.'. Scarpia. who appeared to be in capital con--» dition, found a few friends as he walked around the paddock as gay as a two-year- S I old, the gallop in the Flying Stakes having | improved him. Blackwood was another | horse very much fancied by some; on tho ¡.other hand good judges thought he was I scarcely acclimatised for a fast-run mile and. i a half with 9st. 51b., and the fact that he was Lout of the dam of Newman, an occupant of Kelso's stable, by repute a veiy unreliable horse, was the roason why some lacked confidence in his chance of winning, and did not venture to invest upon him. The mealy bay Common, who made such a; brilliant but erratic run in Hannan's Han-i . dicap, was looking much bettor than his. 1 colour would indicate. Many thought that,. .if the raco was run at a moderately slow: pace his brilliant speed would be of great service to him at the finish, and perhaps 1 carry him first past the judge's box. Swithenween appeared to have an .over-done appearance, and the skin .eruption which she was suffering from. ; did not create a favourable impression. -Wellshot had apparently been having a good time, as his condition suggested that he was short of a couple of good gallops before being thoroughly strung up. De-< tractor was very well, and if "his owner had .started him in the Hurdle Race he might have won, He was quito outclassed is the ;CnpTiacepwhere*horses«c>fta»ami(di-supeTÍor, caubre^were engaged, andrthe samo-remarki .applies -to Damocles, Purser, Sir John,anil The Golden ¡King. Ullaring is a very fine colt, and no doubt he will reipay his owner as seon as ha is thoroughly matured. The sound of the starting bell caused? a rush te witness the race,.and as the horses took their respective preliminaries' St was observed that Le Var and Paul Pry galloped with the greatest freedom, while« Common was very anxious to continneF going on. Detractor made almost all the running up. to the mile and a quarter^ ?when the bright green jacket of the rider of Swithinween made the friends of the . ex-Broken Hill mare flatter themselvesí that she would win. Her advantage waa only momentarily- maintained, as directly *? Powell gave Paul Pry his heacLheshot toj .the front, and from this out it was .áff/ over, for he was going a3 strong as j a lion, while it was apparent that} Bolger, on Le Var, seeme'd very uneasy.^* At the half-distance Bolger attempted to\ dash up on the inside, but he made »J wrong calculation, as the weight waa/* evidently telling on the brown horse, and. he had not sufficient brilliancy left in ¡him.| to accomplish his purpese, se again draw-i ing on the outside he made futile effort»* to get alongside Mr.Nayler's gelding, and, .he was beaten easily at the finish. As her ¡meets his conqueror on 111b. better terms-1 kinthe Coolgardie Cup, it is just possible)) ho may turn the tables on him when they] meet in thati.Tace. Providing the two are together at the half-distance, it is tha. " Great Boulder to a bottle of soda water'*. that the aristrocratic son of Lochiel and La\ Valette will beat him home. After the» Cup great cheers went up for the popular' jockey, and his genial owner was congratu- lated on all sides |for being the possessor" of such a redoubtable champion of the; West, as Paul Pry has proved himself to be. The Novelty Selling Race was the next race, and those who were steadfast in' their belief that Steadfast would win were > agreeably pleased to see him romp home, and land his first double. The Brownlow Consolation Stakes was won by that fractious mare Bain Marie, and, everyone was pleased to see Mr. Elliott win a race with the daughter of Fryingpan and Re- nown.

Along ' the back stretch First Bolt made an ex- ceedingly big jump, when he was.ten lengths ahead of Poissonier. The Pro» vost now began to move up, and as they rounded the bend he got on even terms with First Bolt. The top weight led by. four lengths into the straight, Poissonier lying third, immediately followed by Galant coming at a fast run. The Provost galloped through the gap in the last jump with Galant close to his heels and a grand race home resulted in the big bay son of St. Leger winning by half a length, First( Bolt being third eight lengths off, then Lord Hope, Poissonier and Eau, with Wild; Wave last.

Tile horses faced the barrier with Sir John on the inside, Common being next lim, Paul Pry being fourth from the rails, Le Var between Detractor and Demockless .Mi the outside. Detractor was the first to anticipate the rising of the barrier, his nearest attendants being Le Var and Paul Pry, the remainder'of the horses moving off in close order, with the exception of The Solden ^King, who was last Passing the itand Detractor was making the -running pt a good strong pace a length clear of the top weight, who was pulling hard, Le Var being close to Paul Pry, then Black- wood, Common, Swithinween, Demockless, The Golden King, making a run, Scarpia and St. John. At the mile-post Detractor had a length's lead of Le Var, who was going very well. The Golden King was now moving np into third place, just in advance of Paid Pry, Powell having a strong hold of his head, and next came Common, making a run, Swith- inween, Blackwood, Demockless, Purser 'being six lengths away last. Six furlongs from home Detractor was second in the van, The Golden Kmg run- ning second a head clear of Swithinween and Paul Pry, who was separated from Le Var and Common by a length, moved up to the ex-Broken Hill mare. At the five furlong post the green colours of Mr. Phillips' mare shot to the front, Detractor, who had shot his bolt, being a length be- hind the leader, while Le Var and Paul Pry were together, the order of the others being Common, Wellshot and Scarpia, while Sir John and Purser were beaten off. Half a mile from home Paul Pry took up the runniBg, going vigorously, Und led the favourite by a length, Swithin -ween dropping back third Trainor, having had a clear run for the last four furlongs, had ¿W got Blackwood into fourth place, while Detractor had given up the struggle as hopeless, and receded to the extreme rear. Entering the straight Paul Pry led Le Var half a length, and Bolger was already at work on Mr. Eccles's colt, while Paul Pry waa going well within himself, and appeared to be winning easily. At the half-distance Bolger seeing an opening on the rails attempted to get up on the inside of Paul Pry, but being disappointed he then had to come on the outside, which lost IiiT a little ground. The finish was confined to these two horses, »nd although Le Var made a desperate effort to get alongside Paul Pry he did ?not quite succeed, and the latter, on whom Powell never had occasion to use the whip, passed the judge's box half a length in front of the favourite. Blackwood was third, six lengths away, and then came Swithinween, Wellshot, The Golden King, Common, Demockless, Scarpia, Ullaring, Sir John, and Purser, with Detractor last. ,$ime, 2min. 48sec.

The Rovers having forfeited to Fre- mantle, the latter club played a " scratch" match on Saturday with the North Fre- mantle Juniors, on the Fremantle Oval. Only thirteen men aside turned out, and after a spiritless exhibition thetgame ended in favour of the Juniors, who.kicked 6 goals to 3. WEST PERTH v. IMPERIALS. The weather was anything but suitable for a pleasant game of football on Satur- day afternoon, but the interest taken in the meeting of the West Perth and Im- perial Clubs was considerable enough to draw a fair crowd to to the Association Ground. The match had sufficient bear- ing on the premiership conrjpetion to make it an important one, ana a really good struggle was productive o£ a great amount of enthusiasm. Seme trouble was experi- enced at the start of,* the game, the Imperials objecting tai Orr acting _ as central umpire, uponi the contention that he was not appointed by the as- sociation for the matcïi. At length the difficulty was overcome, ifche-îsea-siders how- ever, taking their platees murmuringly. The Imperials led off 'with an attack on their opponents territory, and there was some excitement when Clumslee sent the ball through the stick/j. West Perth then rallied their forces awi made a determined onslaught npon the Imperial backs, Coward equalising the sCores'with a snapshot. The sea-siders, however, -were fairly on their mettle, and with another gallant attack they gave Kelly a claance, the result being a second goal The 'game had at this stage been only in progress à few minutes, and the enthusiasm oi the spectators was worked up to a high pitch. The second quarter was entered upon with the Imps a goal to the good, and á shower of ram coming on threatened to spoil the game. The ground became (dippery, and the spec- tators were amused tutb. the harlequinade performances of the unfortunate players. The West Perth kepfc up an attack upon the Imperial's goal, and Jones availing himself of an oppo/'tunity put up their second goal. Nothing daunted the Imps, responded manfully, and Bee getting a chance gave them uno lead again. Up and dfim the ground the ball travelled, and Coward, who was playing with character- istic brilliancy, equalised the scores. Although West Perth maintained their aggressiveness the board was practically unaltered when half time was called. Off again and the ball travelled along towards tit© We3t Perth goaL The back fines wiire bard pressed ana at length broken through, Clumslee securing another goal. Then the game began in real earnest, and when the Imps, after another attack, pat np their fifth goal through the instrumentality of _ Christie, West £erth supporters looked very glum. The play continued to be exciting-as the last quarter was entered upon with the Imps two goals ahead. Thun West Perth showed what they were nWle of. Coward evoked great applause whom he sent the ball once more through the sucks, but when shortly afterwards he repeated the performance and made matters equal, the cheering was terri- fic. From t.hia out the*game wore afdifferent aspect. .West Perth followed up their success, and playing in concert and with great determination they carried every- thing before them. When the bell rang for the finish Wee/b Perth left the ground victorious by thre« goals, and more impor- tant still in the almost certainty of gaining the Premiership lor the season, as it is nearly impossible for them to now lose that honour. The scores were :-First-quarter :. West Perth, 1 goal 1 behind ; Imps., 2 goals 2 behinds. Second quarter : West Perth, 3 goals 4 behinds ; Imps., 3 goals 4 bolands. Third quarter: West Perth, 3 goals 6 behinds ; Imps., 5 goals 3 behinds. Í Sinai result : West Perth, 8 goals 9 be ' hinds ; Imps., 6 goals IO behinds. Goal kickers. — West Perth: Coward (4), A.

CYCLTO. NOTES BY "PEDAL." 'During October no less than seven days* 'racing will be had, patronage for which was granted to several clubs and outside bodies at the League Council meeting on Thnrday evening. The total prize-money amounts to over £500, and, inaddition, the Port Cycling Club will hold a two days' meeting on November 6th and 9th, with prizes to the amount of £150. The suggestion thrown out by Mr. Sul- livan regarding the guarantee of tho club that the prize-money will be forthcoming should any race meeting result in financial failure, is one which should occupy the attention of the governing body. The main object of the existence of the League is to protect the interests of cyclists, and it should therefore see that no race meeting shall be run under its patronage if the body organising the meet cannot guarantee the payment of the prize-money. The governing bodies of the Eastern colonies have already suffered considerably from this cause, amd in some instances drastic measures have had to be resorted to in order that racing men should be pro- tected. It does not appear to be generally» under- stood that clubs er other bodies making application to the League for patronage to a race meeting should submit- a programme for approval before patronage can be granted. The rule was departed from ia two instances at the League Council meet- ing on Thursday evening, but it should be directly understood that in future appli- cations which are informal in. this respect will be rejected. It is pleasurable to know that some,-at? least, of the League councillors have the' courage to deal with any question calcu- lated to injure cycling in a fearless manner. Mr. Sullivan is to be commended for his action in tabling a notice of motion to the effect that the statement made by L. Dahl berg, regarding the match between Porta and Reynolds, should be enquired into, and Dahlberg be called upon to substantiate his statement which was made in sworn evidence at the Police Court recently. The protest entered by Mr. Hocking against thehandicappers, who are honorary officials, submitting accounts for expenses and other sundries is a justifiable one. At the same time, it cannot be expected that the gentlemen occupying these positions should defray expenses incurred on behalf of the League from their own pockets. The work of handicapping entails a-con siderable amount of time and trouble, and the official handicapped should, therefore, be paid a fixed sum for the performance of their duties. Avery heated discussion took place i at the League Council meeting regarding the right of outside bodies to run the cham- pionships of the colony at race meetings promoted by them. Mr. Pearse's conten- tion that it is ridiculous for the League to create these championships and allow out- side bodies to step in and run them to the detriment of the affiliated club3 finds much favour. _ NORTH FREMANTLE C.C..ROAD RACE.

Further heats of the third round for^the Boxhorn Trophy were rowed on Saturday afternoon. The water was exceedingly rough, consequent on a strong south- westerly breeze which was blowing. Only two heats were rowed, and both proved good contests. Some dissatisfaction was expressed at the action of a well- known sculler, who in one of the heats rowed alongside a com- petitor and practically steered his course, thus, giving him a decided advantage over* his opponents. Following are the results : D. Hearder, 10sec v. A. W. Cromallin, 15sec. A well contested race, Hearder steering a straighter course than his op- ponent and winning by two lengths. C. Underwood, scr., v. R. Cobham, lOsec. ?Cobham was overtaken-after a hard pull a hundred yards from home, when he retired, and Underwood passed the<-post ,an easy winner. The remaining heat of the-third round will be decided this afternoon, when L. C. J. Macgennis, 3sec, will meet E. J..Nuttall, lOsec. The draw for the final round will,, ;take-place after the-race is/concluded.
