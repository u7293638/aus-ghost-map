Christmas Voices. So Christmas is here again : While the house sleeps quiet as death, 'Neath the bright moon comes the waits' shrill tune, And we listen and hold our breath. The Christmas that never was On this foggy wintry air, / With clear pale gleam, like the ghost of a dream, It is painted everywhere. The Christmas that might have been, It is borne in the far-off sound, Down the empty street with the tread of feet That lie silent under ground. The Christmas that yet may be. Like the Bethlehem star, leads kind: Yet our life slips past, hour by hour, fast, fast, Few before and many behind. The Christmas we have and hold, With a tremulous, tender surain, Half joy, half fear-be the psalm of the year, '.' "rief passes, blessings remain!" The Christmas that sure will come, Let us think of at fireside fair When church bells sound o'er one small ' r aeen mound, Which the neighbor pass to prayer. The Christmas that God will give Long after all these are o'er, When is day nor night, for.the Lamb is our Light, And we live for evermore. The Author of "John Halifax." A young lady; while crossing the street in London. had a violinoello box, .which she was carying, smashed by a cab.' The box, on ielding tip its.contente, was, it ie eaid; found to possess, not a 'cello, but what appeared to beothe family wash.
