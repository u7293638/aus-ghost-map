THE CEY OF THE WEETCHED. Fob hours along the crowded atreet, With aimless steps I've trod, Without a home or hope in life, With scarce a hope in God. This cruel night is fitting close To such a crushing day ; The earth ie, oh ! so dreary cold ! And heaven so far away. The friendless rouse no anxious thoughts, The busy throng sweeps on ; I've stayed beyond the city's lights, The twilight's grey has gone ; My useless arms have failed to win A crust, a place to stay ; Earth has no work, no room for me, And heaven is far away. 0 great, wide world .' O frowning sky ! So cheerless and so vast, 1 dare your keen and cutting sleet, Your piercing, bitter blast ; Rage, howl, and huh this living spark from out the tortured day, That feels existence dark, all dark, 1 And heaven eo far away. How dull and black beside my f set The sluggish river rolls ; It beckons as a demon might To lure unhappy souls. Its slimy voice is whispering, Here rest in peace for aye ; O God ! the river is to near, And heaven eo far away. Do thb Drum Surras Paw?— People do not like to think of *jfflttfr. It is an unpleas ant subject ; but it constantly obtrudes it self , and there has been much speculation as to whether mental or physical pain attends the final act. Observation teaches us that there i» little pain of either kind in dying. Experience will come to us all one of these days, but it will come too late to benefit those whoremain. It seems to be a kind provision of nature that, as we approach the dread event, our temn jHmiwhm, and the coward and the hero die alike— fearless, indifferent, or resigned. Aa to physical pain, Dr. Edward H. CUrfc, in ' Visions, *»iayB:— 'The Tub is that nnsonwiiansiwi, not psaa, atfaadsta* naal ask. Tbthaanfcje* at it death ia mo mot* pais/al aham hash.

Previous to that moment, and in preparation for it, respiration becomes feeble, generally slow and short, often accomplished by long in spiration and short, sadden expirations, so that the blood is steadily less and less oxy genated. At the same time tbe heart acts with corresponding' debility, producing a slow, feeble, and often irregular pulse. Aa this process goes mi, the blood is not only driven to the head with diminished force, and in less quantity, but what flows there ia loaded more and more with carbonic acid gag, a powerful anaesthetic, the same as that derived from charcoal. Subject to its in fluence the nerve centres lose consciousness and sensibility, apparent sleep creeps over the system; then comes stupor, and then the end.' How Did St. Paul Look,— A curious discussion between M. Benan and M. Mcr ieres concerning the personal appearance of St. Paul has followed the public reception of M. Benan into the French Academy. M. Benan has described St. Paul as a bald man, of short stature, aquiline nose, meet ing eyebrows, pale face, small head, pierc ing eyes, thick beard, prominent shoulders, and bow legs. Challenged to explain whence he derives all these remarkable details of St. Paul's personal appearance, he has cited the 'Acts of Thekta' a3 his authority for the aquiline nose, the bald ness, the meeting eyebrows, the small stature, and the bow legs — and the eccle siastical history of Nicephrus for the small head, the piering eyes, the pale face, the thick beard, and the prominent shoul ders. As M. Benan would certainly sot accept either of these very unhistorical authorities as his warrant for any statement intrinsically improbable, we wonder why he so eagerly appeals to them for mattera not intrinsically improbable. An apocryphal writer who will freely invent portents, will be quite as ready fo invent their circum stantial framework. Would anyone in his senses go to Defoe's ' Apparition of Mrs. 'Veale' with, the view of discovering not what Mrs. Veale's ghost was like — being rationalistic enough to reject the ghost as a fib of Defoe^ — but what Mrs. Veale herself was like, where she had lived, and what where her circumstances'? The ways of imaginative rationalists are certainly won derful, and their affirmations often stranger than their denials. — The Spectator. The name of a New Hampshire school is May I Cough.
