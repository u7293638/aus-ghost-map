COLONIAL EXTRAUTS. THE LATE STICKING UP BETWEEN GIMPIE AND YARRA.--Henry Eldridge, one of the persons lately stopped and robbed by some bushrangers, between Gympie and Yabba, in Queensland, gives the following account of the affair, which appear's in the Nash- ville Times :--When about four miles from Imbil station, going through the second scrub, an armed man with his face covered stepped from behind a tree ahead, with a revolver in his hand, and told me to stand with hands down or be would murder me. On looking behind I beheld another ruffian, who had us covered with a double-barrelled gun, As there was scrub on either side of me, "I must give in," " I must disimount." They marched me into the bush-ahout 300 yards--when the tallest of the two tied my rands blehind my back, while thIe other stood threatening if I made any resistance I was a dead nan. They then marched about hllf-a-mile further into ai scrub, where I was sunrererd. All I hd wars 5s., which they took; they nlso took my boots off niy feet, and tile hrrt off my heand. They thrUi took rme to II saplirng I refused to sit so closeo to it, whebn I.reeivedI a severe blow oni thile Iand whlichL knockeld me sense. lessIr. I caiine to in a few hours, ned after trying every oflfort to relieve myself, g?ve it urrp nearly exhlusted. On looking around I sulw a small stone at a distance, which it was all but; impossible to reach. I made deadly effort to reael it witll my tongue, nnd mianiirged to grapple it writh my mouth and dropped it over lly rshoulder, and P'rovidenrce guided it into my heauds. I worked it with n.y fingers Ill nighlt, man. iagedo to eit tile roe u wrllich tield le to tihe surplinrg, and Xot prlly relearsedl tile follow. mrg morning rlabout 10 o'lock.
