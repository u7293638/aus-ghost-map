REVI «WS.* HISTORY OF NEW ZEALAND. Mr. Rusden's qaaiiuoatiooB for the office of an historian are, unfortunately, extremely limited. They consist merely in his patience and industry As a collector of material for a writer like Mr. 1 round, of the late Mr J. R. Green, he would be invaluable But when he comes to marshal his facts and arrange his narrative, he betrays his incapa- city. He has no idea of proportion or our spective He gives the same prominence to Important as to unimportant incidents and personages, places them on the same plane, and does not subordinate insignificant matters of detail to salient events and leading characters He has labour analy accumulated a mass of information with respect to the subject he has undertaken to elucidate, but he has failed to present it to the reader in anything like systematic order, and with that fluency, lucidity, coherency, and consecutive ness of statement which are requisite not merely to render it attractive, but to make it intelligible Loo is like a man afflicted with a voracious appetite and feeble peptics He favours a great deal of food, but as he is unable to digest and assimilate what he eats, the elements of nutrition are converted into the factors of disease Instead of furnishing his readers with wholesome mental ailment, Mr Rusden only confuses and bewilders, while he occasionally mis leads them, by the most indigent which he has emptied out into his 1,800 pages Sheridan in one of his genial moods, paid a compliment to " the famous page of Gibbon ," but being afterwards questioned on the subject, laughingly replied, " I said voluminous " And this is also the great defect of Mr. Rusden's work. It contains upwards of a quarter of a million more words than does Hallam's Constitutional History of England, which covers a period of two centuries and three quarters, namely, from the accession of Henry VII to the death of George II and the diffuseness of the three ponderous volumes under notice is not redeemed by any grace, vivacity, of picturesqueness of literary style. Mr. Rusden's "History" is as dull and no deadly. lively as a blue book. And some of his sentences are so curiously constructed as to leave their meaning quite unfathomable Here is a sample of obscurity -" To the Secretary of State he (Governor Hobson) narrated in an important despatch those proceedings of the company which, from the impunity with which lawless encroachments on land had been made, would, if not overcome, leave the company sole masters of the field " Occasionally Mr Rusden is beguiled into metaphor, and then he becomes unintentionally und unconsciously comical, as when he left us, for instance, at page 229 of his first volume, that " The company were not slow to reflect upon New Zealand the malign rays with which they had deflected the Colonial Office from its uprightncBB, under Lord Normanby, into the crookedness of Lord Russell " The relice, tion and de (election of a ray of light are very familiar phenomena, but we never heard of each a ray, malign or otherwise, deflecting a political department into the deformity of a statesman. In addition to his other disqualifications for the task he has undertaken, Mr. Rusden enters upon it with vehement prejudices and prepossessions, personal, political, and otherwise, and for the gratification of theSe he sacrifices the dignity and impartiality of the historian, and deviates into state ments and discussions which have little or no relevancy to the theme upon which he is engaged. Thus, in a foot note upon page 33, he finds occasion to appeal to the remark that " an ex Executive Councillor may misconduct himself without much risk of removal," the following fact illusion to Mr. John Woods : " In one colony a man who was dismissed from an inferior post for dishonesty became subsequently a Minister, and induced the Governor to cancel the order of dismissal made by a previous Governor and the man is to this day officially ' Honourable " And on page 42 of the second volume, Mr Rusden adroitly contrives to introduce the following sketch of the political career of Mr C G Duffy in the colony -" Convicted of Both tion in 1911, but set at large on technical grounds reverting to seditious practices, but evading the personal risks to which he incited others, for the desertion of whom one of the most resolute among them branded him as a pitiable blaspheming traitor intriguing against his Sovereign against his reputed leader Daniel O'Connell' against his country, and Ina oaths in the House of Commons, and in a colony-fawning upon him countryman O'Shanassy in Victoria until he had obtained a title and a pension, and then spurning a patron whom be no longer needed-Mr. Charles Gavan Daffy pursued the primrose way to the favours of Downing-street They could not convert him from that to which he was in a manner' born, but the method of their distribution might sour the minds of others more loyal than he History has juster garlands to dispense, and strikes a juster balance between the ignoble and the worthy One gathers honour with time, while the destruction of the other excite disgust " This may be all very true, but the render of Mr Kasdoh's " History " will be apt to ask what it has got to do with the progress of events in New Zealand In dealing with the conduct of successive administrations in those islands towards the native population, Mr. Rusden weakens a naturally strong case by exchanging the judicial functions of the historian for those of the advocate who has been briefed on the side of the Maoris In stead of holding the just balance spoken of above, he espouses the cause of the coloured race with such intemperate ardour as to impel him to defame the characters and misrepresent the conduct of some of the public men in that colony, and a contributor to The Argus, who was an eye witness of some of the events described by the writer of that work, has already exposed his niece. lacy and his injustice Mr Rusden might have rendered valuable services to the noble 'race, of whom he has constituted himself the undiscriminating partisan, if he had penned his narrative in a spirit of calmness and impartiality, but its influence and authority have been seriously impaired by his obvious and fervid one Bidcdness As a storehouse of facts and a census of rebates and documents relating to the events recorded in them, these three volumes will prove to be of more than ordinary utility to a properly qualified historian of New Zealand, but as a substantive work of permanent interest they can scarcely fail to miss their mark The heat chapters are the four first ones in the first volume, in which Mr Rusden has industriously collected, from a great variety of sources, a large amount of information with respect to the origin of the Maoris, the date and manner of their arrival in New Zealand, the plants and animals they brought with them, their physical, mental, and moral characteristics, their social habits and industrial pursuits, their modes of life, their peculiar customs and usages, their religious tea, their land laws, their poetry and music, their language and superstitions, and their methods of warfare Those who know them most intimately bear willing testimony to the many noble qualities they possess, and there appears to be no reason for taking exception to the averment of Mr. W.

SQUATTING IN VICTORIA The title of this book, or at any rate that which it bears on the cover, squatting in Victoria is slightly misleading in it might be mistaken for a technical treatise on the occupation which its author followed during thelOjeara immediately preceding the gold discoveries in what was then the district of Port Phillip But it is, in reality, a most entertaining volume, and depicts a state of society which, although only removed from us by 30 or 40 years, begins already to bear upon it the stamp of antiquity MT Curr arrived here in 1839, when Melbourne was a strangling village, with trees and stumps in its principal thoroughfares with a gully 18ft deep and from 15ft to 20ft wide, running down the centre of what is now Elizabeth street, and with most of the habitations it contained constructed of weatherboard or of wattle and dab, while the blacks wandered about the place half naked, armed with spears, and followed by packs of half starved mangy dogs, and the voices of the magpie, the bell bird, and the laughing jackass were heard among the trees which occupied the site of the present railway station in Flinders street Sent over from 1 remains to take possession of a sheep station which his father had purchased in a locality called Wolfacrag, Mr Curr found himself alone in the bush and describes his situation and his feelings with a simplicity and a vividness which remind one of a chapter in Robinson Crusoe, and the following passage may be quoted as a good example of the natural style of his narrative -" I well remember seating myself' on a log near the hut the morning the over seer loft, and watching the dray as it toiled slowly and noisily up the gully which led to the road For some time I could see the many-coloured bullocks, the driver, in his cabbage tree hat, walking near them with his whip over his shoulder, and the overseer and his servant following a little in the roar I thought they were a long time getting out of sight At last they disappeared into the scrub, and when no longer visible, I still sat and listened to the creaking of the wheels, the voice of the driver, and the crack of his whip, till the sounds, growing fainter and fainter, at length ceased altogether What appeared to me an unusual stillness and loneliness then seemed to Bottle around me The writer was a lad just out of his teens, indifferently armed, inexperienced, exposed at any moment to an attack from hostile blacks, and quite alone Carefully loading his two guns, and chaining up his pair of kangaroo dogs in such a position as to render surprise impossible, he prepared to defend himself, and, as it after wards appeared, it was well be did SO Meanwhile, he writes, " the first day of my solitude passed over slowly enough, the stillness around weighing a good deal on my spirits, whilst such occasional sounds as did occur made me start involuntarily The wind, the noise of a falling bought or the whistle of a hawk-which yesterday failed to arrest attention-made me now look care fully round Unused to solitude, and to the feeling of my life being in danger, I was much on the alert, and in a very prepared state of mind for lighting, magnifying a good deal the risk I was running ' Finding the country upon which his scabby flock of sheep were picking up a precarious existence comparatively worthless, the young squatter accidentally discovered a better run on the Tongala Plain, and proceeded to form a station there but when the shearing season came round he found that his losses on the year amounted to £1 000, and, on proceeding to Melbourne with his clip of wool, be learned that oil station property had depreciated in value 10 per cent, and that there was a complete stagnation of business Shortly afterwards Mr Curr visited the Protectorate station, and was amused at discovering that the blacks, who had been employed in planting potatoes, had-in resentment of the folly of their white teachers in burying articles of food surreptitiously dug the whole of them up during the night, and made a late supper off them While residing in the interior and journeying through the country our author had plenty of opportunities of studying the habits and customs of the aboriginal tribes, and the information which he has recorded on this subject constitutes an acceptable contribution to our stock of knowledge concerning them He also relates a curious ghost story, at pass JTM, on the authority of his brother, and expresses his own belief in it in the seventeenth chapter he skims the surface of a subject deserving of more serious and scientific treatment We refer to the changes which have been and are being brought about in the fauna and flora of Australia, in consequence of the occupation and cultivation of its torn tory by Europeans So far as his own obser various and experience go, he has been led to the conclusion that the introduction of live stock has led to an increase in the water supply, as by the trampling of quadrupeds showground has beonhardened, and the natural reservoirs rendered more impervious to soak age " Our watercourses," he writes, " are more easily filled than they used to be, and retain water longer From the same cause, floods are no doubt rather more extensive and frequent than in the past As regards an increase in the productiveness of our soil, I have noticed not only that crops grow where formerly they would not, and that grass is much more plentiful, but that we begin of late to miss on our clayey plains the calcined and barren appearance of 50 years ago, to result, no doubt, of the grasS being fed off by stock, instead of being periodically burnt as it used to be One of the best chapters in the book is that which Mr Curr devotes to the Bangerang tribe of aborigines, and his opportunities of studying (the mental characteristics and development of the natives have evidently been turned to good account He is of opinion, with Sir 1'hos Mitchell, that, in mere intelligence! Sagacity of observation, and powers of reason, the Australian blackfellow very often surpasses the British peasant, and that the former " has within him a latent capacity, moral and intellectual, equal to that of the white man. As to the way in which an aboriginal can find his way in the bush with out apparently taking notice of external objects, of the position of the sun in the heavens, or of any landmarks whatever, it comes nearer to intuition, Mr Curr tells UBI than anything he is acquainted with. Until sophisticated by contact with Europeans the blackfellow is described as having had " decidedly something of the gentleman about him ', and our author believes that, on the whole, in his wild state, he suffered less and enjoyed life more than the majority of civilised men " Altogether, he goes on to Bay, " the blacks are a like able people, in consequence were generally welcomed at stations The causes of their popularity were their kindness, fondness for children, constant flow of spirits, love of fun, bonhomie and the ease with which they accommodated themselves to the likes and dislikes of persons whom they wished to please ' Space forbids our following Mr Carr in his migrations as a squatter from Melbourne to the Murray, but his narrative gives one an excellent idea of the pastoral life of the period, with its hardships, and difficulties, and its vicissitudes No doubt there was a certain element of romance and adventure in it, which may have operated as a partial compensation for its risks and its trials, but after making the necessary deductions on this account, it must be acknowledged that the pioneers of pastoral enterprise in this colony deserved the good fortune which befell some of them and that to be compelled to associate from day to day, for years together, with horse stealers, machine breakers, homicides, disorderly soldiers, drunken marines, house breakers, petty thieves, and so on as a good many of the squatters were, according to Mr. Curr s account of the matter, was rather a high price to pay for subsequent ease or affluence
