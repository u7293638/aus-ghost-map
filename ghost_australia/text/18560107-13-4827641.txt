Should wheal be »own to uu equal extent the coming year, tho amount icquircd for .seed pulposos would be about 3ù0,000 liisbcls, thus reducing the quantity lescned for milling and distilling to 2,223,440 bushels, »r thero nbnut. Much of tho wheat-say twenty por coat. will bo too inferior to produco flour from, mid would bo sold for distilling. Tilla would further reduce tho Pouring wheat to 1,778,700 bushels,-an «mount, sup I osing tlio average to bo firo bushels of whoat to the larrelof flour, equal to 355,752 barrels of tlic latter ] loduct. 'lhere is n,great variety of opinion in regard to the late of consumption of Hour In California, but fiom a lomparison of liows wo think the conclusion is a fair one, that it can scarcely bo less than 35,000 barrels 1 er month. Assuming, then, that our stock of old four on the 1st of August was 100,000 baiiols, we fliouldhiivo a total of 455,752 bal reis for tho icir's consumption, or a« uvonige, including what has lic-uii or may bo oxpoiiod, of 37,070 barrels por month, leaving us an oxoess to meet exports of 33,743 barrels, which, leaving possible imports ankle, would prove a small margin to insuro us against high prioos. But it should bo borne in mind that since tho 1st of Au- gust we baie expoitcd about 60,000 barrels of flour, so that in foot ive shall probably have of our own product no oxcess at all.
