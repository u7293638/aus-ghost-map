THAT TALL YJEN. (Te the Editor of the "Coolgardie Mirer.") BRA,—With reference to the tall yarn which appeared IH the last issue of the MINSK, when I SAW my name figuring so prominently in print, I must admit that it was & pretty tall yarn indeed, and am quite satisfied that you lat me ^own lighter than the case deserved. I wish to explain now bow the whole matter came about, and ivhich is the outcome of a practical joke I wished to play upon an acquaintance of mine residing in Hobart. The individual refarred to has always got something sensational in the part of the globe in which helives. The last discovery that he claimed to have made was the appearance of a ghost at the hospital nurses' home. As a consequence I wrote tha whole fabrication to this six feet seven acquaintance in order to give him a start. At the same time I acquainted tha Jlobart Mercury with the whole occurrence in order to prevent it going to print; but by same means or other he has been let into the know and has turned the tables upon ME by sending my letter to Launce&ton; to be published. There is not a grain of truth in the whole concern, and I trust the subject will now end.—Yours, etc., J. P. DWYER.
