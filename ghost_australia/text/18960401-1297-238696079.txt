NOVICES IN THE MINISTRY. Principal Fraser, of Camden College, was somewhat severe on what he was pleased to term novices in tho Christian ministry, in his chargo delivered at Leicbhardt last night in connection, with the ordination of Air. W. L. Patlson, who, he reminded the congregation, was no novice, though young. No student who left their college was a novice, and no Church had a right to elect a novice as their pastor. "Wrecked and ruined, and often disgraced, churches were often the result of electing novices as pastors. A novice might bo an evangelist, hut to be tho pastor of a Chris tian Church, to be the guide of young and old, to bo apt to teach as well as to learn, were not the gifts of a novice. Some had great gifts as evangelists, but not the gifts ot a pastor. He was called to work In which a novice should not be engaged. As It happened, Air. Patlson had for 13 years been engaged <n Christian work. Every student In their college had at least six years of experience and unblemished charac ter to recommend him. Youth was not a barrier In the ministry; being a novice was. Mr. Patlson was giving up prospects In business which most young men in Sydney would envy, and the world's judgment of him would be that he was a fool. They did not profess to make ministers. Air. Fatlson's college training did not make him a minister. He had gifts from God. and the confidence of bis brethren; but these did not make him a minister. A church had called hlra to be their pastor; that only outwardly made him a minister. Even though all the archangels In Heaven laid their hands on his head, and the hosts of Heaven joined In singing his ordination hymn, these would not make htm a minis ter unless the Holy Ghost set him apart and fitted him for the ministry. They be lieved, however, that it was in the grace of that Spirit that he had consecrated himself to the work.
