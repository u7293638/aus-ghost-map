H. A. Gooden went in aai I cjuneobtagaon scoring L, he having placed ' his leg where his bat ought to have been. Phillips then took his place, bat was nst more successful, as he was cleaned bawled by. Ktmea. Eh score was also 1. King was still more unfortunate,, as his score was 0 when i catch by Lungley disposed of him. J.

The eleveutii man T. K. Bright or 8. Cope being absent, Lucas retired not out. WMtridge Mas deservedly c&eeied; 'oh hi? return, as the Bcore of 86 was mdde wittiout a ghost of a chance ibeiog given. It contained 1 three, 6 twos, and IS singles. The JiffiBt?Bce between the Ssglishmaa's practice and thi? match was very evident. The 'tSouih Austnliaas seemed to be afraid of i Tutting a¥%e balL and played a very defensive k game. This may be seen from the scares, as during the whole afternoon there were only two fours made and two hits for three. The great want of the colonials is batting—in field ing and bowling they are well qualified to give a very good account of themselves. The -fielding altogether on Saturday was a. treat to witness. Ofcourse there were one or two who were not quite up. to concert pitch, but the in ; sta?ces,were.BO few that it would be invidious to particularise them. There will be very little : to complain of if the fielding in the match next week .equals that of-Saturday. A Blisjht«iin provement, however, might be made 'rid the matter of throwing in the ball, as once dr. twice it was thrown qaite out bf .the reach of the wicket-keeper. He,however, was well,backed up and-runs didnot result from it, but still, a wicket might be missed in consequence of care lessness in that particular.
