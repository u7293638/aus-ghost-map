THE SEMAPHORE BOARDING-BOX. To the Editor. I am, &c.;, JAGOE'S GHOST. Sirâ€”I am glad to see that attention has at last been drawn to the condition of the Semaphore boarding office, at the end of the jetty, where the men have to spend so many hours in all weathers. It is a gal- vanised iron structure, built in the wrong position, being insecurely established, partly on piles, over the north platform, exposed to the concussion and the full force of southerly gales, and the heavy seas, which beat on the pier. There is no sanitary convenience whatever, and the officers and others engaged in the gulf work have to go ashore and use the ac- coomodation at the railway-station. In bad weather the place is wet, and shakes alarmingly, and its inadequacy has long been the subject of severe comment amongst numbers of people who have the opportunities of judging of its de- merits. But what is everybody's business is nobody's business. It should be recon- structed, and removed to a more substan- tial portion on the jetty, away from the platforms, where the surges are most felt. If I am not in error, it is the same struc- ture that did duty some 20 years ago on the Glenelg pier, when the mail steamers called there, and it is a weather-beaten re- lic, entitled to superannuation and the respect due to old age. As the official building of her Majesty's Customs, it is certainly not what one would, expect to find at the chief boarding station of South Australia.
