CHARGED-WITH LUNACY.-At the local Police Court this morning before Messrs. XV. P. Anderson and H. . . M, Camp bell, William Adams was charged with being a-luniatc. The unfortunate man, I who for home time has given his relations the greatest anxiety, was arrested on 1 Monday afternoon by the police, and since that time has been examined by Drs. Dowling and Levis. The medical evidence was to the effect that accused 1 was suffering from paralysis of the brain, and not fit to be at large. The presiding I magistrates committed him to the Ararat Lunatic Asylum. Some few weeks ago the accused had the mis fortune to lose his wife by death, and this appears to have prayed upon his mind greatly. ' FANTASTIQUES." - To-night Pro fessor Davis gives an entertainment in :the Orderly Roorn,.which will be both mystifying and amusing. Anexchange thus alludes to a performance given : The perfoimer opened with a ten card 'ti'cks, at which he is wondrously expert, and as he talks both fluently and wittily he was soon on gcod terms with his audience. A specimen of spirit writing (very neatly managed) was then given, followed by perhaps the best sleight-of. hand trick yet shown here. Five hand kerchiefs were borrowed and fastened firmly together by intricate knots made by different people. The Professor, without any delay, placed one on the other in a hat, and immediately with drew them one by one separated. An exhibition of the common but clever cabinet trick, and an amusing display of ventriloquism closed the first part of the programme. Madame Stella Davis as sisted her husband in the next item, 'Rosicrucian Psychomancy.' Small slips of paper were handed round the audience, who were requested to write on them any question they wished answered, No writing pad was supplied, each person putting down his interrogation where he pleased. The slips were then collected in two or three hats, and, without being removed from the sight of the audience, handed round promiscuously and re tained by those drawing them. Madame Davis was then blindfolded, and gave a score or so of questions and answers, which were acknowledged to be correct by both the person who held the paper and the writer of the question. The Professor wound up with an extraordin ary illustration of how modern ghosts are produced. He first stated that he wished it distinctly understood that he claimed there was nothing but trickery in anything he did, and courted but de fied the closest investigation. At his re quest a com.nittee of four ascended the stage, and started operations by securely fastening the performer's hands behind his back with a rope, the knots being drawn so tightly as to break. the skin of the wrist. After these knots had been sealed the Professor was placed in a long black bag (carefully r? ined and passed as correct). the .uouth of which was drawn tightly round his neck by means of a running tape. The tape was also knotted and sealed, and the two long ends passed through the folds of a cabinet (also minutely inspected) inside ot which Mr. Davis was seated. One of the committee held these ends in his hand, while another had. a roving commission outside the cabinet to guard against extraneous assistance. In spite of these precau tions, -o sooner were the lights lowered than bells were rung, tambourines played, and after a little while three ghostly figures made their appearance one after the other, one of th2n shaking hands with the members of the committee. Towards the2l0se of the trick the Pro fessor struck a match and walked out of the cabinet in ordinary evensg dress and without his bonds; yet a minute afterwards when the lights were raised and the curtains withdrawn he was found as securely bound as ever, with the knots and seal intact. The trick is wonderfully clever, and should not be missed. WVe anticipate a large audience to-night. SHIRE CouNxcIL.-Members of this Council nmeet to-morrow at Heywood, when in addition to the ordinary busi. ness there will be the election of Presi dent, SALE AT HEIVoon.-W\e again re mind those interested that Mr. J.

He was born ear Morven, Argyleshire, Scotland. At the age of 19 he migrated to New South Wales with his family, where he saw a good deal of the stirring times when bushranging was rampant through out that colony. He stayeda few years in New South Wales, but eventually crossed over to Victoria and entered the employment of Messrs. T. and A. Chirn side, on whose behalf he selected Mount William station. Not long afterwards, in conjunction with his brothers, he de voted himself to squatting pursuits in the Western District of Victoria, and at one time the MacEachern family owned the following valuable properties:- East and West Strathdownrie. Heathfield, Kan garoo, Marven, and Knebsworth. For some years he conducted a butchering business in Portland, and afterwards started a drapery business, neither of which proved very successful. He was a staunch member of the Presbyterian Church, which he supported to the best of his ability. Deceased was twice married, and leaves four sons and one daughter to mourn his loss. Though in bad health for several years, Mr. MacEachern was only confined to his bed for a few weeks. 'The remains were interred in the Dartmoor Cemetery on Sunday afternoon, and the funeral was largely attended. The-service was conducted by Mr. \Werne.

A STOWAWVAY BAKED TO.DEATHI.- shockirig discovery was made on board the Newcastle Company's steamer the Namoi, on Monday morning upon its ar rival in Sydney. Some member of the vagrant class had unperceived stolen on board the vess2:, when it was lying at Newcastle, in the hope of obtaining a passage to Sydney as a stowaway. He secreted himself in the space between the two huge boilers of the steamer, and, probably lulled to sleep by the warmth, perished there, for, with the fires alight and full steam up, he was literally baked to death during the voyage of the steamer to Sydney. \Vhen found the stowaway was in a crouched-up attitude. thelower portion of his body resting against one boiler, while his head lay against the other. One hand was clutching the steam pipe, as if he had died seeking to drag himself trom his hiding place. The greet heat: emitted from the furnaces had baked the body to such an extent that the features were unrecognisable. No money was found in the pockets of the deceased, and as prior to the de parture of the steamer from Newcastle a man answering his deecription 'had sought unsuccessfully to obtain a pass age "on the nod," it is assumed that the deceased was identical with the man who made that inqu'ry. The temper ature of: the hiding-place would be about s6odeg., and so intense was the heat that the unfortunate man's legs were actually roasted, while his body was covered with most frightful burns. At the inquest held later in the day, Dr. Taylor, the Government pathologist, testified that the deceased was from 27 to 3= years of age, and that the body was in a baked condition, due to being subjected to intense heat for a consider able time.
