The report which had ki in tend contained some topics which might justly be deemed Miljie!-, of on parturition, and which were calculated to encourage the committee to go forward in this work and labour of love on behalf of the poor afflicted beings who were the objects of their wives and solicitude in this has station The UrM salient to which their attention was directed in the report was the amputation and occupation of the building if the institution were considered a success during; the past eleven j ears in which it had nourished among them, what ir.ccurni,cnimt had they now to hope that, with till till) ap)hiiL<\\.» by which they were furrow ended here, the children would be cared for and educated as their hearts could both dear and besides the superior appliances they had there also enlarged accommodation for additional numbers 'I boy were able now to receive and educate every deaf and dumb and blind child in the colony, and the number on the roll had increased in a large proportion since the opening of this new building No doubt, for some time to come, they would increase, and every additional pupil brings additional expense He regretted to to obliged to say, however, that the contributions to the public Public were not proportionally increasing On the contrary, there appeared to be a falling off in the annual musical Horse Inn, was a subject deeprigrtt, and when till looked around, and beheld the increasing prosperity of I thereunder in every quarter, and in every depaitcaintol trade, be Ii It can pelled o Eoy that it was a reproach to the community that one of the most charitable institutions in the colony should be suffered to got into debt, and to languish from want of means For what purpose did they think, had the Great Creator placed within their reach the vast materials of wealth with which (his- colony abounded Was it that this great wealth should be placed the creditor iudividujls,andhoardedupfortb.ein selves and families i Was it that the fortunate speculators should enter on a course of self indulgence and luxurious living ' Was this a consummation worthy of the great (river above, and becoming to the humble recipient below : Would such a course of living give satisfaction through life Would it stand the great scrutiny of the life to come ' Life was in stewardship, not a possession Woailh, it used for the glory of God and the relief of suffering fellow men, became a blessing, it was doubly blessed, it blesseth him who gives and him who takes " but nobles hoarded up, or spent in self-indulgence, become to their temporary owners the "mammon of unrighteousness." Let it be theirs to sanctify the gifts which the Great Creator bestowed upon them by devoting a liberal and generous proportion to the cause of God and the benefit of their fellow beings but would they make their possessions friendly to their pence This institution was considerably in debt on account of the erection of this new edifice, and also on account of the maintenance of the children. Now the people of New South Wales were not accustomed to turn a deaf ear to such an appeal as that which had been addressed to them by his Excellency from the chair. He were accustomed when such charities came before the jublictoseo large subscriptions pouring in, and he did earnestly appeal to the public generally on behalf of those who could not speak for themselves He trusted that large contributions from every quarter of the country would show that the people of New South Wales were determined to maintain their high character for liberality and generosity when a worthy object was placed before them. And what object more worthy of their charity could be discovered throughout the wide wide world than the cause of the blind and the deaf and dumb ? When uneducated, those children were a burden to themselves, a burden to their parents at home, and a burden to society at large in after life. BUL let such children be educated in a school like the present and their whole nature underwent a thorough renovation They became happy in themtclvce,ableesing to their families, and useful members of society. Now, the question had been asked TV by is it that Divine Providence has permitted this heavy affliction to fall upon those innocent children ' Let them be assured it is not in vain. There was a wise purpose underlying this mystery. God had given those afflicted ones as a legacy to his faithful and loving followers He has provided that their wants should be supplied by your love And if the wealthy classes would, by their super- abundance, bridge over the deep chasm which God permits to exist between the rich and the poor, we should have less of that class jealousy which seems in our day to threaten society with one of its worst social evils-the disaffec- tion of the employes If this growing evil is to be eradicated from our midst, it must be by letting the working class to that they had the best sympathies of those placed in higher stations, thus giving them to feel that in their night of adversity and affection the upper classes were their best friends, and that the sentiment of the past was still true to life, " One touch of nature makes the whole world kin " He invited every philanthropist, all who took on interest in the welfare of mankind, to visit this institution and inspect it for themselves. They would find no scene better calculated to impress their minds for good, and to fill their hearts with gratitude to the great Creator for the blessings which He had bestowed on themselves and their families, than an inspection of the children here. We never fully realize the blessings we enjoy until we witness their removal Happy was it for those who must look beyond their own families to behold such afflictions as they witnessed in these poor children before them. May the contemplation of such a scene awaken our sympathies for those poor helpless ones, and lead us to become fellow helpers with the friends of this institution in this cause the cause of God and man ' (Applause ) I jlrGT, WISE seconded the resolution, which was put by his Excellency and carried unanimously Rev Dr. LANG moved,-" That the thanks of the meeting is given to the Government and Parliament for the annual grant of fJSOin aid of the funds of this insti- tution" A very considerable proportion of the report Fibihi) devolving upon him in moving this resolution had been relieved from him, for his Excellancy (although In accordance with his high functions no representative of the Sovereign, To did not hold the purse strings, had volun teed to be their adroit with the Legislative favour of Ashfield for this in intentions, adequate to its necessities and calculated to supply the wants which it still felt they were much indebted to his Excellency (Hear, hear) He felt that, as the hatchway of the institution iDciniftd in number, and Ho ] "position and resources of thoroughly aroused, throwing) doubt that the Ltcis nature would continue to act upon the principle of giving prizes for p and in aid of the institution (it is, litar ) If find him observed that a certain inspector of the literary lace, in all civilised c arrive at any rate, was will end with the calamitous which this intimation sought to share There was no doubt that, as his o t LIT d friend and brother who once did him, bed marking, the grt it designed Divine Providence was to bring those unions retreaded the ctncldciatitn of their fellow mott Is, that the gift of charity might be exercised by them.
