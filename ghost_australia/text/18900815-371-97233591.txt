MODERN 'LITERARY' SOCIETIES! To the Editor. — Sir. — Scene opens with ghosts of Dr. Johnsoo, Goldsmith, Dickens, Thackeray, and Jerrold. Dr. Johnson, chairman ; Dickens, vice- chairman. Dr. Johnson, who is just recovering from a fit of biliousness after lecturing Oliver Goldsmith on his lavish expenditure in a new rig-out whilst in the flesh, deplores the want of taste in the youth of the present day, and of the ignorance prevailing in ' literary' societies on -cngnsn literature or tne past few centuries. Goldsmith retorts, 'Hear, hear ! hear, hear' ! on which the Dr. re plies, 'Shut up. Oliver ! that's an observa tion yoa won't find in my dictionary. You put me in mind of the parliamentary aspirers of the present day 'literary societies!' Douglas Jerrold agrees with the Dr., and also deplores the fact that his works, in fact his name, or plays are never mentioned now a-days. Effect and tawdry tinsel are the latter day attractions, especially upon the stage. Charles Dickens testifies to the fact that the Colonial youth do not appreciate him, except when perchance his words are put into the mouth of some 'popular reader,' and dear old Thackeray's smiling spirit in a doleful manner alludes to tbe 'Vanity Fair' in so-called 'literary' minds that he observes around him. Oliver Goldsmith describes tbe minds of our young 'literary' men as a 'Deserted Village,' and says he would not give a gross ot green spectacles' for their il literary' knowledge. The ghostly meeting closes with a chorus of groans and moans at tbe sad spectacle of a number of young men, in their ambition for vain glory, wasting their opportunities for solid study and research in striving for mere effect, to inflate themselves in the near future into a coveted seat of the Upper or Lower 'Ouse, because, forsooth, there is a payment attached to it. I am, Sir, &c;, Oliver. ? a ?
