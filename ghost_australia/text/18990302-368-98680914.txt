THE FEDERAL CAPITAL. (To the Editor of the .vening Penny Post.) SI,--Presuming that it will be optional to the representatives of Now South Wales to submit only such places as they think proper from which a site may be chosen for the federal city, then such distant places as Albury, Bombala, etc., may be left out of the list to be chosen from, and so prevent any chance of the federal city being too near to Melbourno. I would go so far as to suggest that no place should be submitted further south or south-west to choose from than Duutroon or Yass Plains. Between either of those places and Goulburn plains there are several sites that are all that could be desired, and by limiting the distance to the south appears to me to be an easy way out of the difticulty of having the federal city too far from Sydney. I would further suggest that the Federal Parliament be hold in Melbourne and Sydney alternately until the federal buildings are completed. By adopting this plan there would be less inducements for the smaller colonies to delay the completion of the federal buildings, which they would be most likely to endeavour to do if the Federal Parliaments were hold in Melbourne only. I consider that Mr. Pea cook, Chief Secretary of Victoria, lot the cat out of the bag when he said " that if the Federal Parlia meot controlled the selection there would not be the slightest ghost of a show of any other place but Ballarat being the federal oity. I have any amount of private information to confirm me in thatopimon." Comment on Mr. Peacock's words is unnecessary to the intelligent reader. Yours, etc., S. M~NERNEY. Captain's Flat.
