—SELECTED POETRY. KOBKET BURNS. X we amid the fields of Ayr A ploughman, who, ia fool or fair, ■r 'Sings at his task, ' Ito dear we know not if it is - He laverock's song we hear or his, ri Nor care to ask. For him the' ploughing of those fields Apaoreethereal harvest yields ... , {Than sheaves of grain: ■ Songs flash with purple. bloom the rye; Tho, plover's call, thecuslew's ory, '.fling in his brain. . . Touched by his hand, the way-side weed Beoomes a flower; the lowliest reed Beside the stream - -i . Is clothed with beanty; gorse and grass And'heather, where his footsteps pass, The brighter seem. He singsof love^whoselflame illumes The dhrkness of lone cottage rooms; , . He feds the force, The treacherons under-tow and stress, Of wayward passions, and no less '. The keen remorse. At moments, wrestling with his fate, His voice is harsh, but not with hate; The brash-wood hong Above the tavern door lets fall : Its bitter leaf, its drop of gall, Upon his tongue. Bht'stili the harden of Ins song Is love of right, disdain of wrong; , ° Its master chords Are Manhood, Freedom, Brotherhood; Its discords bat ah interlude Between the words. And fben to die sojoirag and leave Unfinished what he might achieve! i .1 Yet better sore . - Is this than wandering np.aqd down, An old man, in a country town, '.Infirm andpoor. • • . i , Fornow he hannts his native land ; As an immortal youth; his hand1--" ' Guides every'plongh; He sits beside each ingle-nook; . . HisVoice is in each rushing brook, r -Bach rustling bongh. Hie presence haunts this rebmto-mght,. A frnm' of mingled mist and light, From that far boast. Welcome beneaththis roof of, mine! Weleeme! this vacant chair is thine, Dear goest and ghost! wweraiaow.
