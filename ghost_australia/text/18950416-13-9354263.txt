THE GHOST OF A SLAIN DELUSION. There never has been any scarcity among us of gentlemen who devote their services to the material men of the ghosts of delusions slain long, ago In one way or another they have manage 1 to attract large audiences and their performances while not unprofitable to themselves and their friends have had a disastrous influence on the moral fibre and material well being of the people Their ranks have now been reinforced by trie emia area of the Bimetalhsts of America who endeavour to revitalise for as the ancient superstition which underlay the mercantile system of Colbert and his imitators vi?, list a nation can export forever with out importing and thus grow prosperous Not that he openly states his case in these bad 1 terms If he did his attempt would be hopeless, for the common sense of humanity has long since discarded this as surdity He therefore craftily wraps it up in sentences which, while appealing to popular prejudice conceal the real nature of his contention Yet when this car can g is removed the old and discredited delusion stares us boldly in the face lina in his contention- ' other money enabled the nations who use it to produce at a cheaper rate than those who use gold money and therefore gives them an a vantage injurious to the gold using nations The nations who mainly use silver money an Asiatics The currency question thins lore ian race question an 1 in the white races persist in the use of old done. they must be driven out of the in dustries (tel 1 by the silver using, yellow roses The only thing which can save them from the fate is the adoption of international bimetallism It has already been pointed out to this gentleman that if his contentions are true The remedy must be one, that if the sect silver money does give an m Austral advantage to a nation there is nothing to prevent the nation for whom he speaks from at once securing this advantage for itself by the adoption of a monometallic silver currency To this reductio ad absurdum he has not yet condescended to reply, and evidently desires us to believe that the Americans decline to accept any advantage over the effete nations of Europe though it be easily within their reach that they prefer to go to great trouble and expense in inducing all European nations to place themselves on a level with them by the adoption of internation ii bimetallism the industrial history of the United States does not encourage the acceptance of the belief that such philanthropy and her his their economic actions an 1 so far there fore the imiHSury of tin mining interest tin Is himself in no small difficulty Leaving him there we will now show that his other con mentioned? that silver money confers a permanent advantage on the yellow races and that this a haulage enacts injuriously on the gold using white races are just as delusive as the remedy which he suggests for them that, in fact they are based on the old superstition already alluded to the reasons given for the allegation that silver money enables the yellow races to produce goods at a cheaper rate may be shortly state I as follows The working population of Asia uses very little of imported goods Their wages the fore are spent in home made produce, and for such produce the purchasing power of sin i r has remained the same though the world price of silver has fallen by one hall Consequently there has been no increase in their wages as measured in silver The tooth) they make however, when sent abroad are sold for gold and a gold non buys twice as much silver as formerly the cost of producing the KOO la has fallen similarly and thus enables them to undersell all competitors V e are not now concerned with the question whether the facts bear out this reasoning but whether the reason ing itself is sound suppose the great advantage in the export trade as there alleged did exist It would of races sit) follow that more and more labour would be taken from those pursuits which satisfy the home demand of Asiatic countries and that this labour would be employed in the more profitable provision for export As a consequence the supply of goods for home consumption would decline and their price would rise This change would continue until the profits in both branches of industry become assimilated and the consequent rise in the price of home products would then have deprived the exporters of all the advantage which they previously possessed The decline in the internal purchasing power of silver would however be I listened by another cause The bimetallism advocate posits an enormous increase in the export of goods from Again As the -rain area do not make a present of these goods to I Europeans there would be a similar increase of imports from Europe I am se imports he burst! alleges consist mainly easier and he also maintains that an increase in the volume of money must must a similar increase in the pnciofioods Hence, on his own showing a second cause would be brought into action tending to increase the price of all goods in Asia and to destroy that a haulage possessed by the Asiatic exporter The combination of these two causes acting automatically would therefore remove the danger with which he tries to frighten us into the acceptance of bimetallism much more certain) than this artificial measure of at least doubtful efficacy But is it a danger? No doubt it must appear as such to those who can see only one side of a question who labour under the illusion that a country can export without importing,, when however both sides are looked at the dinner resolves itself into a bogey to frighten children with the principal "foods which it is alleged that the Asiatic can export more chi iply thronged the fall in the price of silver are Ua (grain and cotton yarn Course quently these goods will be sell at lower prices than formerly As far as the con Hunters of tea cotton ere this and bread are concerned this will surely be an unmixed advantage It is however, pleaded that oculist this gallantry must be shed the des i h and in that some of these consumers hitherto employed in (townie, cram and milling yarn will be deprived of imploy ment Ya however the Asiatics wanting goods in exchange for those which they thus export at a cheap rate final labourers will be immediately wanted for the re- election of such goods as The As atna deman 1 in ex change There is no reason to suppose that this new labour will yield Un m Ii ss munt y wages than they previously received and the net result therefore is the boon that the white lad ourers get their tea grain and cotton goods a ncheopirrute andean either consume more of these or more of other coo la As a rule the increase of consumption will at least partially fall on other goods, thus securing the a lditioiialu(hnntac,c of employment for other white In ourers whose labour otherwise would have remained unemployed 1 see if the principal imports into Asm did consist of steel these can hours would remain unaltered It is true the direct effect would be to maintain the price and tin before merchant tin production of aihirbiyoud what it would be in the absence of this demand Ihi silver producing country board or, June little direct trade with Asia it mainly (on s through 1 ludish channels Australia and America would then fore send mon silver to England and would demand in mum more I English goods A pi urgently it would be tin to demand that employ id 1 piedish labour but in 11 hilly It would be the demand for Bilur in Asia which produced the employment In all three continents ItiuUHl however be admitted that while the advantage of the low price of Asiatic product would be reaped in three continents inhabited by I Europeans the Asiatic would r as a greater advantages 1 unopened would get some imported articles at firm prices will runs the Asiatic would get fined stunt artists and every thing, which he ] are used with the exported surplus at lower prices lot he would give for the HO purchases less labour than if he produced them himself to a man of short sighted selfishness this may appear an evil, but if more intelligent nature one actuated by a more, far sighted stilish ness, will gladly accept a boon not otherwise obtainable, even it the advantage reaped by others be greater than his own. We have purposely avoided all discussion of the truth of the allegation that the low price of silver gives an advantage to the silver using nations We are much more concerned with the vastly more important de- directions which are made from HUB allegation by the bimetallism advocate These we have now shown to be untenable We have shown that such an advantage, if it exists, can be only temporary, and that even if it were permanent all other nations would share the benefit, instead of being injured by it. The opposite contention we have shown to rest on the perhaps unconscious adoption of the delusion that a nation can permanently export without an porting There is, however, another side to this question We in Australia are anxious to develop among the teeming millions of China and Japan markets for our wool and other produce Are we prepared to make a present of our produce to the inhabitants of these countries' If not, we must either import more of their goods, or other nations whose goods we want must import more from them Here, again, it is obvious that we cannot develop our export trade with the countries, that we can not secure to our own labourers the employ mint which would arise from such trade, miles these countries export more and that any reduction in the price of their exports must be beneficial to our own people, ' inasmuch as it gives us more of their goods in exchange for our own than it the prices of the former were higher Here again, there fore, it is obvious that the bimetallic conception of the yellow man with the white money is a bugbear, born of a disordered imagination.
