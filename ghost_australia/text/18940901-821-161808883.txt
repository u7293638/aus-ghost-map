THE SIN OF OMISSION. It isn't the thing yon do, dear. It's the thing that yon leave undone, Which gives you a bit of a heartache At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not wii'e, Hie flower you might havesent, dear, Arey ur haunting ghosts tonight The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of beartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and -winsome tt ne. That you had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, The«e chances to be angels Which even mortals And— They come in night and silence, Kach chill, reproachful wraith, .Wheu hop» is faint and flagging. And a blight has drooped on faith. For life Is all too short, dear. And sorrow is all too great. To Bulfer our slow compassion * That tarries until tbo late, And It's not the thing you do, dear, Ii.'b the thing you leave uudone, Which gives you the hitter heartache At the setting of the sun.
