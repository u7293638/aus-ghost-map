;COLONIAL REMINISCENCES. : THE YOUNG BUSHRANGER " ON Business in the country, with leave of absence for a month" I was when this occurred second clerk to the firm of Duthorpe and Co., solicitors, Sydney ; and.the business which was taking me from home, could not be done without a personal visit. Its nature is of little conse- quence to this "ower true tale." . Armidale was my destination, and, a long-wearisome ride was before me. Rail conununication was then unknown, in fact in those days the sole means of transit was by the mail, an open vehicle carrying a guard and eight passengers. A fine morning in summer therefore beheld me and six others boxed up in this unnatural conveyance. Where they were all bound for, Heaven knows; for more than half the journey was over ere the ice of . commonplaceness was sufficiently broken to permit us to converse with freedom, of our plans and intentions. We had but one Iady passenger, and for this, room being an object we were thankful. Had there been more, the journey would have been doubly unpleasant ; as the "sex" on this occasion rendered herself highly disagreeable and annoying. Yet things went on very quietly till a wayside inn, bearing the somewhat appro- priate sign of " The Traveller's Rest," was reached. " We changes hosses here I" said Jehu, " any of you gents as likes can dine. Old Rooster allus has a good . spread ready." The spread as it was termed was a long time coming, but at length it appeared. The entrance fee thereto was two-and-six, payable in advance . Hot-boiled, hot- roast, hot-baked, and stewed; all-steaming hot. During the ride I had made friends with a stout jolly- looking individual, bound for the.Rocky River. . " Come on," said he,, dragging me to the table as soon as the fixin's had been put:on. "Paid, aint yer? . Well, don't hesitate, but set to at once; never mind knife or fork. Ham, did you say, or chickon ! perhaps you'll try this roast or a bit of this baked veal'; it looks good ------ Coach is at the door," shouted the ostler poking ; in his head.'

Como, hand over the valuables." ? . ; Sor, as roproaonled by tho unprotoctod fomalo bofore roforrod to,, was in " «terricks ; convenient things, no doubt, when, a person is forced to, uso. thom. The lady was unmolested by tba robbers, that ls to Bay, thoy did not order har out of tho coach af tor taking hor goods and ohatlols, a few rings, two sovereigns, and a locket, with "dear Goorgo's'" hair in it, woro all the plundor ob. tainod from her; tho rent of. us hod on our portions considerable' sums, .which foll, into tho hands of tho bushrangers. Allparties having boon sonrchedtho mail boga wera oat open and lotter» abstracted. Sotno of. thono woro torn up, in a vain ondonvour to find chequos or, monoy. 'All being at length settled to tho satisfaction of tho robbers, thor gave us a volloy of ourses mid departed. Il waa my first " hai'iug-up," and is. a reminiscence that will not ko spoedily forgotten. AH my cash, ns well as a gold watch, u present from my employers, woro taken. On tho first appearance of tho bush, rangors I had " plautod my money in my boot," but tho villians wore far too knowing for mo, ann-1 was com pollbd to turn out my treasures or rocoivo a fow ounces of load. Whilo searching mo however I had a full view of the countenances of tho robbers, mid felt certain of recognising thom again if needed.

To toll tho truth I felt greatly relieved whoa they were gone, and so doubtless did tho ttat of the pas- sengers. Preparations wero instantly mai!» for rewmmg tho journoy, und ore long wo. wero jogging along 03 if nothing had happoned. Boiling-up was so ordinary an occurrence, that everybody, tonk tho matter in good part, aud tried to forgot their losses. Tho circumstances having been reported to tho police at Murrurundi, wo had tho satisfaction of seeing them depart in search of tba offenders ; one of these they captured, bul tho young man, bis mato, unluckily escaped. ? I reached Armidale without further disaster; trans- acted my business, and sent particulars of my success to. my employers. Quite a pleasant timo was that I spent in New England, and I left it with feelings of regret, . I hod just the same journoy to - toko as before, bat warned, by past experience, provided myself with a S¡stol, determined to resist any marauder who might aro contest tho right of way. . . No . such event however happened, and ' the scene of our former mishap was passed in daylight. - I was tho only passenger in the coach, and to tho driver, a now per- sonage, Irocounted full particulars of " mv adventure." ? On rc oohing Sydney, I was alarmed to bear that tho firm of Dathorpo and Co. wore- in difficulties, and that thojr had been compelled. to mako rednotions in their clerical staff. Biglio, their head clork, had been dis. charged, so what might- not I-êxpoct; Two' days after my, roturn, .

Probably howovor ho would not credit my unsubstantiated statement ; Iso that I dcomcd it best to keop strict watch over tho much-trusted Hogan till opportunity should offer of bringing tho guilt homo to lum. That tho mah soon in his company was ono of tho buahrnngorsi said to bo lurking in our vicinity, I had not tho least doubt, still ray too-confident master would not havo hcarda single disparaging word uttered against his favourite. * ' ' My night watches took place rogularly for a week, but resulted in nothing tangible. I observed no more nooturnl visits,.though I had little doubt that tho wino was being abstracted from tho cellar. Ono morning soon afterwards I was much surprised to hear that Tom was leaving tho station for good. Pro- ceeding to tho front of tho houso, I saw him on horse- back, bootod and spurred, and having a largo swag strapped on tho saddle. , " i'm off," said ho ¡ " gooil-byo, sohoolmastor.

"No, I really did notl" wasmyroply, "butwhero aro yon off to nowr" "Oh, homo to my old people on tho Nip-in : they want mo thora to look niter tho farm.

Touching tho noble animal with the spur, ho went off Uko tho wind, und, ero long, was ont of sight. "Too flash," said I, to myself, as I turnod into tho houso for breakfast, " dopend on it, that young chap is up to no good I" Tho day attor his departure, Mr. M'ICnight,'having Bold a mob of cuttlo, left tho station to go to Carcoar to roceivo tho money, intending, us ho said, to rotura in a few dnyp. Tho night wo oxpectod Mr. M'Kuight's roturn, was dark uud tempestuous, nnd lin did not mnko his appoar nnco, although Mr». M. and myself waited up nil night uiomtmlnril.v exprnt.iiic him. Townrde morning, nboro thrpo 'wild dlrnngo wind voices thorn cunio clearly defined tho sound na of two ihotn fired in rapid Fiicrcst-ion. I heard thom pliunly, lind wailed to BOO if Mrs. M'JCui};lil would remark tho olroumatiiuce. Tint na Mic did not, being unwilling to create unnecessary alaru, I said nothing, and waited anxiously for daybreak. xii.. ' Tho long nickt terminated, and after breakfast with some juvenile members of tho family, i went ont » little way on the road te see if pap» was v.^Wo. The trial then prepared for ns I shall never forset. There lying on his face, just ns ho had falle1» among tho brushwood near thOToad, was tho dead bot'y of my .murdered mastor, and grazing by his sido his i oitMnl steed. Thobody wo allowed to remain where it la. V, un- til the police wero brought next day, and by then * the remains of tho faithful lather und husband were bron '«nt to tho station. It was clear ho had boen murderous shot by bushrangers I . " Mrs. McKnight resolved to leave tho station at once, and to remove to town. There was consequently no further neod of my services na toachor. Bidding I adieu to my kind mistress and her umiablo family, I set oat for Sydney on horseback, nnd with a cheque for a respectable Bum in my pocket, I reached Penrith safely. Stopping at Emu Plains for : refreshment, I wa» astonished toho»r myself bailed by name, and a moment nrtnH rti.nnt-t.ivl iviminir from a nublio-houae, my old companion. Tom Hogan.
