POETRY. QUARREL. AND NO EBOON CIUATZON. Calm wu the trfght in that still autumn weather And calmer still and adder wer» the twain,' Who, psrbng then, aright yet have kept If pride had not been stronger even than Then were no bitter teen, so sighs of sorrowy. , . No aaditeproaobe* ottered «t the mid ; ?Abd should they meet, feat* hence or on tbe inorroWf ?Twill be with oourteooi Date, u friend ? : meets friend. Oh 1 mocking word* for those who onoe loved madly, Henceforth fo be mwe friends, pot lew, not more ; Ifuep u. each heart a death-knell Bounding wdly For lovo, deemed deatUew, in glad days of yore. ' Hot more than friends ; the voioea mutt not faker, Lust broken tone* betray a vain regret ; And on the lips the forced amile must not alter T-. show how, Wth that mask, grief'a lino* are eet Lut them take heed, lest any word be spoken To rouse some ghost from out the buried past ; Though the dear tie* that bound them once ve broken, A atrange spell lingers yet and holds them fast Not leas than friends ; but ah 1 the friendship offered &uem;* of eucfi little worth, now love is done ; *Tis hard to take the hand thus coldly proffered A iid feel the tender, thrilling touch has gone. Gone with th-j dsy, when just one word was needed Those heavy clouds of pride and doubt to lift ; lint all in vain love's dying voice had pleaded; Now far apart each lonely life must drift And she will never know at their next meeting How hard he fought an outward calm to gain; Nor will he see, beneath the friendly greeting, How her true heart still yearns to him throuf h pain.
