Selected Poetry. THE SHIELD. Oh did you hear a roice of death ? And did you not mark the paly form 'Which rode on the silver mist of the heath, And sang a ghostly dirge in the storm ? Was it a wailing bird oi the gloom, Which shrieks on the house of woe all night? Or a shivering fiend that flew to a tomb, To howl and to feed till the glance of light ? 'Twas not the death bird's cry from the wood. Nor shivering fiend that hung in the blast ; 'Twas the shade of Helderic — man of blood — It screams for the guilt of days that are past! See how the red, red lightning strays, And scares the gliding ghost of the heath ! Now on the li»aflp« yew it plays. Where hangs the shield of the son of death ! That shield is blushing with murderous stains ; Long has it hung from the cold yew's spray ; It is blown by storms and washed by rains, But neither can take the blood away. Oft by that yew, on the blasted field, Demons dance to the red moon's li^ht ; While the damp boughs creak, and the swing ing shield Sings to the raving spirit of night !
