THE S.A.J.C. AUTUMN MEETING. Once more has old Father Time brought round the annual May meeting of the S.A.J.C. and making some allowance for the plethora of racing, which may have tended aomewhat to surfeit tbe public of the popular sport, a full meed of interest is being felt in tfan wmring events. The committee of the S.A.J.C. profiting by past experience and by the satisfactory nnaniMal position in which -tfae clnb stands at present, have judiciously reeols-d on keeping pace with the inarch of improvement, and ao nave wisely expended a good round mm in —,*?lr*"?E necessary additions to the offices in tbe grand atand paddock, where those who are the greatest sonrce of income to the clnb are likdy to assemble. The gene ral public too, who patronise tfae shilling paddock, bave not been overlooked, and in a year or two amra—ahonld tfae present pros perity eontinne—tfae clnb will still further improve tfaeir property, and the pnblic at large will derive a benefit therefrom tiiat will considerably add to tiieir comfort and pleasure. Wbat is needed st onr time of writing is a downfall ot sain to make tfae course proper fit for racing. The continued dry weather lias made the ground so bard that {even on tfae days wfaen the oourse faas been thrown open for galloping; the trainers faave not availed themselves of the pri vilege except to a very limited degree. Lowering clouds, however, prognosti cate a welcome change, and abocud the sain oame before Saturday, the open ing day of ths meeting, tho dub and t_MSMraqgftateniity wfll be all the more wwt meetings at MorpbettviOe inthe .daya wben then arere no fooda available tor -_-r"~ir ******?**—?'i—' tr * —?***—- r——-"-—.?- r that bave ainee been effmted: bot thaas days __aaa past, and evea ahonld Jupiter florins make a aesent on tfae Cop Day itedf he wfll not be an t-nw-lcome visitor.

Tfa* bet&ng; mm lel fsoltj weU indicates waaa their wwarro eera the psdnm t__lnk of the respective merits of these bones, aad we ara not acqiminted with any reason why tbe -victory ahoold not fall to Euchre or Ava hmthe. with Buefare for choioe, and bdieve -thetidrd plaee will be filled by Cracksman or .freedom. For the Camden Stakes there wm not be a large field, as tfae penalties for **&?__? at weight forage races wfll place ?at.B lba. onSavauka'aback, aad 0 stlO lbs. on Topaz. -Baron von B_ueU_r -can hardly | be eo good at the distance as his stable companion, who will faave 2 lbs. sexual allowance, and must be dangerous. Should Tyropean start, and we think it pro bable she will, wn cannot see anything below that can pace with ber, and therefore select the Newmarket Handicap victress to carry Sir Thomas's colors to the front in the Gam den Stakes. It would be almost idle to con jecture bow many youngsters may go to tfae port in the South Anstralian Stakes, bat Bis- Bis has shown such marked superiority of form that the race looks all over but shouting for hrr unless Land League should be able to pnt her down. The Novel Selling Baoe should be won by Paul if he starts for it. For the St Leger there will be but few can didates, and probably not more than four or five will see the. post Guess work will be a starter, and although he will bave to meet Prometheus there is very little doubt that Onesswork srill repeat fais Derby victory on the same coarse and beat whatever may be opposed to him. The Flying Handi cap is necessarily an event of a mnch more open character, and were Bis-Bis saved for it we should look no farther for the winner. As there will he a good-sized field, and such horses as Larpentand Transferred in it, with several youngsters who have distinguished then—elves on other occasions, arc anticipate the race will he a very inter-asting one. We think tbe issue will lie between Lsrpent, Transferred, and Satanella. The second day'a programme opens with the Maiden Plate, for which there are six competitors, the best of which appear to be Hmricace and Childe Harold. In the Nur sery Handicap there are 19 entries, but the weights will not be declared till after the firat day's racing. The Adelaide Cap follows, and sre are at present of opinion tbat the winner will be found in Sir Thomas Elder's GrasswoKK, with The Plunger and Mistaken to fill the places. If First Water is really well on the day we shall expect him to be tbe most dangerous opponent of the chesnnt. In the Selling Hurdles we shall look no fur ther tban Charcoal for the winner, although Struck Oil ought to be some good at the distance. In the All-Aged Stakes the most dangrsous ntn-iY****'** are the most likely winners of the classic events on the first day, but as Tyropean will probably be saved for the Goodwood Handicap, Bis-Bis, although sbe hse already incurred the 7 lbs. penalty, must have a big say in this event, as ahe will only carry 7 st. 5 lbs. In the Autumn Handicap there are twenty-six nominated, but thc weights will not appear till after the first day's racing. For two or three of the events on the tiiird day the weights are not declared until after the seoond day's racing. The Goodwood Handicap and the Steeple chase are the principal f eatarea ot the 12th, and the running on tfae two days previously will throw a good deal of light on tae chances of the favorites in tiie Goodwood Handicap. At present we believe that Tyropean will re peat her Newmarket victory, and that ber stable companion, Bassanio, will run into ; a place. The Steeplechase is likely to fall to Alhambra or Depriver, with Chrysalis to fill a position. THE ADELAIDE CUP.
