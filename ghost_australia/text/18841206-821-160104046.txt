MOON-RISE IN AUSTRALIA. {From "Earth's Voices," by William Shabp.] A trackless fore -t all around Of lofty gams that from the ground As saplings sprang in ages past The short, Bweet twilight fadeth fast, And from the forest's depths I hear The locnsts' whirring noise, the clear Soft magpie's song, the sadden scream Where cockatoos like white ghosts gleam Among the melancholy boughB; The. wild dog's bark from where there browse Stray herds of kangaroos—the cry Of something deatn-strnck. As I lie And listen to these sounds I see long moonbeams pierce a lofty tree, lake random lances thrust to kill Some Bend who baffles all their skill; And even as with sleepy eyes 1 watch, the full moon through the skies Sails with a seeming moveless motion— A globe of fire in a purple ocean.
