COMMEMORATION OF THE CONSECRATION TO THE EPISCOPATE OF BISHOP SHORT, AND PRESENTATION TO HIS LORDSHIP. A service in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the consecration to the Episco-<*> pate of the Lord Bishop of Adelaide (Dr. Short) was held in Christchurch, North Ade- he Feast of St Peter. There was a luge congregation, the church leiog crowded in every part. His Excellency lir James Feigusson, attended by Mr. J. A. ferguson (Private Secretary), was present, and here was a luge attendance of the clergy. Che service, whioh began roth Ohozal Even long, was principally conducted bytheEer. lanon Dora. After the song, ' The Yen. Archdeacon (tbe Key. O. Ifarryat) reached the sermon on Psalm cadi. 6th and MUowing verses:— "Ptay for the peace of rerosalem; they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and plenteousnesi Brithio thy palaces. For my brethren and lompaniona'aalcea, I will now ear, peace be within thee. Tea, because of «ie Lord oar Qod, I will seek to do thee good." He said— [till great blessing to be capable of a high and holy impulse; to act for the time as the ■pint prompts in kindness and liberality and ■elf-denial, without any appeal to reason, and on do other grounds than the instantaneous flash of an approving conscience. It was thus that aaints of old in many cases showed their devotion. There was that in'them that responded at once to the touch of the Spirit of Qod. They acted right y, and did good spon taneously. Not less is the blessing derived from the retrospect of what is thu* done when _ we find our reason agrees with, our conscience approves of, the impulse, and is gratefuHor the inspiration which has perhaps carried hi beyond our ordinary selves. It is, I would hope, with some such feelings as Uiese that we are How met together. Following a good impulse, we have resolved to commemorate tbe 25th anniversary of the consecration of the first Bishop of tbe Diocese. Let as hope that on rejection we ■hall find that what we have done is, in God's providence, more than we intended—that in thinking of the past we are proriui?g for the future ; that by our progress and*eHon on this Eve of St. Peter's the hands of our Bishop may be strengthened to rule and feed tbe sheep and lambs of the fold ; and that the piwtoral staff whioh is to be presented to him may be like the rod in the hands of Hoses—the symbol af that divine power which, julcsrd God's people from slavery. Ctertsttfc^M* anw veraary, small comparatively ifinK^may be in itmlf, b significant of Sre&V; Ahooght both in the past and fatore for the Bishop and for ourselves.

Bis LdBOBHTf , in acknowledging the presen tatum, aaid— This pastoral staff, with which you, my brethren of the clergy and laity, have been pleased to honor my service of 25 years in the episoopate, is an emblem of the office and duties of a Bishop not less expressive titan appropriate. It b at once the symbol of loving authority and devoted obligation. It has also a twofold aspest and regard. It lifts the thoughts from earth to Heaven; and thence carries them back to the wilderness of this world, in which the flock of Ohrut, purchased with His own blood, the special objects of God's care, is still wander ing. It speaks, therefore, "to the inner ear devout" of faithfulness to the Chief Shepherd; of self- sacrifice, of love and tender care; of vigilance and boldness in defence of His sheep, for wh?m He laid down His life; of the M ready miad" to do and suffer in their behalf, snnrnhn filthy lucre, or that more subtle sin, the lore of power, and dominion over God's heritage. This staff, then, is the symbol of a respon sibility awful in its nature, and vast in its ex tent It is a teacher, not of pride, but humility; not of boasting, but self-abasement; not of huaua strength, bat carnal weakness; not of \- seH-r*aance,but prayer for help from the Spirit of God. In tins sense alone, brethren, dare I receive it at your hand*. None know better thanyour •alvas that "it is a small thing to be judged of . ana^s judgment."
