THE RESULT OP DYSPEPSIA. How very severe your 'twice married man ' is on us poor Australian women and our cooking failures. Why did he not write 'as a ghost from the cemetery lot, and say that his wife's cooking failures had killed him ? As it was.Jhe saw two of them out. Poor things ; I wonder were they Australians. As regards housekeeping, I must say a good many of the city girls do not give sufficient attention to it. In what country are they not to be found ? Other wise our girls are able and willing to turn their hands to anything, especially squatters' daughters ; which is an acknow ledged fact amongst our English visitors, to which country our unjust critic evi dently owes his birth, though I am not sure that England is any better or prouder for her effort. I am very sorry poor 'Twice Married' should have had reason, *eal or imagined, to write in the petty, sarcastic way he has done. He should take more outdoor exercise ; it is good for body and mind, and gives one less time to make a god of the inner man and less room for dyspepsia. â€” An Amused Readee.
