POETS CORNER. AT REST. The raindrops patter patter, with quick, increasing sound, Like fairy footsteps patter to reach the welcome ground. The old man sits and ponders ; low droops his weary head ; Hit fond, fond heart still wanders to one —to earth long dead. Her small, soft hand seems clinging to hie in love ouce more ; The falling rain is bringing dear ghosts of days of yore, Before the fire thus seated on rain-nights long ago, Their love tales they repeated in tender _ tones and low ; Her head upon his shoulder, her hand upon his own ; . Once mora fee «*A behold her— forgetting he's Ham « Forgetting »11 tJ» ssggjsh, the leaden, unshed tears, Kettfi which his heart did languish ai/sne through torturing years. Heavens! Who can paint the oiMaCng of that dread word ' alone,' To those, heart on heart leaning, had eoul to seal otioe grown. The nun-drops, shivering, patter by fitful wfadgusts tacc M, Like tiny feet they patter that seek some friend long lost. Xfee oM man seem* to ponder, bat lower droop* his hM4 ; Kq more ftione hell wander— with her at last— W*do»d. C.M.V.K, ' M«yviHc,' Tvmora,
