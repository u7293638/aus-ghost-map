I " SYDNEY Firms Sau_>itoN YACHT CLUB. This newly-formed club held its first race on Saturday afternoon last, and as there were new ideas to be worked out, it was a foregone conclusion that a large number of persons would attend to watch the proceedings and and go whether these new ideas are likely to become popular The special features of the club are that competing boats are to carry coloured designs on their sails that the boats have no station, but sail round a triangular course and no boat leading is to prevent another passing her and thirdly, that the handicaps are given at the start With reference to the first named special feature, it was intended at first that the boats were to carry striped sails, but as great objection was taken to this, coloured designs were allow ed in the shape of crosses, stars, crescents, "c. So far as sailing the short triangular courses are concerned, and for the purposes of distinguishing the boats, those coloured designs whilst now and bright should prove a success, but if the boats are allowed to carry their designs flying away as a couple of them did on Saturday, or in the event of the colours getting v. ever fading, time will tell whether this idea will always prove a success As to the triangular courses, this system will no doubt be the means of introducing a new class of boat, as long boats with less beam should prove more successful over a course similar to that of Saturday last, where no boating is required, than the style of craft now racing another thing will be the doing away with the large centreboards used in most of our wind-eaters, going to windward being out of the question in the races of this club With regard to the handicaps being given at the start, there is not the slightest doubt but that it should prove a success, especially where a race is being watched by the public, as, when the boats are well handicapped as they proved to be on Saturday last, exciting finishes are the result, and the will can be picked by any person watching the race Taking everything into consideration, the opening race was a success A large crowd of visitors were conveyed from different parts of the harbour to Clark Island and landed there, this being the point from whence the boats started The steamer Agenoria, having on board the umpire (Mr F Saunders), who at the last moment took the place of the official umpire (Mr Fitzhardinge), followed the races throughout The steamer Gosford also followed the races, with a large crowd of visitors on board There were two preliminary boats, and from these the first and second boats competed in the final The course was from Clark Island round mark in Rose Bay, round mark in Taylor Bay near sunken steamer Centennial, and back to starting-point First Heat -Grace Darling, 20ft, D A Hansen, 3 minutes Ghost 24ft, Arthur Thomas, 20 minutes, Violet, 22ft, G Holmes, 1" minute, Massilia, 24ft, C P M Connell, a minute, Volunteer, 24ft, J Robinson, scratch It was about 20 minutes to 1 when the Grace D rating was sent away The Ghost was the next to be sent but like all other ghosts, she could not be found when wanted Violet got over his mark much better than the next boat in order, Mas- site and Volunteer Ghost started after the scratch boat BefoioroachingthofirstmarkViolot sjibcurricd away, in fact she nearly lost her mast, and had to retire The first mark was rounded as follows - Grace Darling, " 39m 17s Massilia, 5h 54m 40s , Volunteer 5h 52m. 10s , Ghost, 5h 56m 22s Second mark was reached by Grace Darling at 9h 53m 4s Massilia, Hi m 19s Volunteer, In 1m 25s ""did not spinnaker for the run back, but the back come adds t oft Bradley's and it had to be re-set The finishing times wem-"a"Dirhng,41i 7 10s , Massilia, th Bros Volunteer, 4s Oin Second Heat Maritana, 20ft , O Taylor, 3 minutes Kananook 20ft , Mark Foy li minute Our Own -1st S Hellings li minute, Remus 24ft, George Parrott } minute Lottie 24ft.
