Mr. Charles Warner, the actor, has been fortunate in his theatrical ventures, but very unfortunate ia his mining speculations. Speaking of his visit to Australia in 1890-1, he said In my two years' work in Australia, there was n clear profit of Â£35,000 to be divided between the management and myself. Alas 1 why did I speculate in mines and land ? ' Let the cobbler Btick to hia last' are wise words. I will obey them in future.' Some consternotion has been caused amongst some of the miners at the Blayney copper mine by the visitations of a ghost in one of tho shafts. The men hear strange noises, bolls ringing, sighing, groanings, etc. Miners going below have their candles extinguished by a supernatural visitor, and some of the men alleged that something brUBhed past them. Six men have left the mine owing to the terror the ghoet has inBpired.
