Oar Prize Story Competition. ; ít ia rather hard to please evoryhody; and tho attempt to do BO ia a vain ono. Ia tho Btories already published during tho present competition almost every Bide of Australian life has found sonia exponent, whether the work baa boon dono ably or not. Yet now a correspondent, "M. W." (Copo'a Creek), has turned up with tho complaint that, having read all the stories, he is struck with tho absence of the humorous olomont in them. He wants, as ho Baya, aomo piqnant sanco occasionally to servo aa a relish for the material of tho other Btoriea. Wo aro not altogether prepared to dony tho general oorroot nesB of our correspondent's remark ; but, at tho same time, ho will notioe that the absence of what is general oalled humor ia not peonliar to those stories. It is a general defect; and Borne poople have en- deavored to explain the fact by ref or ring to tho sombre inflaonooB of naturo, tho want of color in troos, and so forth. Perhaps tho truth ÍB that wo are all rather too young aa a people to enjoy fan; and that tho after cffoota of tho Btrugglo for existence have not ceased to operate. Ba thereason what it may, it is undoubled that tho true vein of humor hoB not yet hoon prominently displayed by any Australian writers. Next week tho following stories will bo published : 1\. " Tho Ghost of Gravo Gally" (by M. M. C.) : As the namo indicates, this is a gruosomo story of melodrama-that is, to begin with. How it onda is quite another matter. 2. "How Diok Turned Up" (by "S. A.'') : Tho late exhibition in Adolaido haa at least contributed to place one work on record, whioh ia this story, essentially South Australia.
