Mr Reid's . ambition seems to be to break records. . -He retained Mr Gnuld Mr Garrard end Mr Smith in his cabinet for weeks after Ibeir defeat at the polls for no apparent rerson than to prove that ? hnt ftjliinat l.£rf Mih«n^ longer than any other. Directly the pre vious record was broken he gave effect lo - the will of the three electorates. Also he kept the Assembly sitting last week in order to beat the Jennings-Staatt sitting record. Directly this was eclipsed he allowed the . House to adjourn at 8 o'c].ock in the evening. The Premier 'has olso established a record for passing - Amending Bills to cure defootive legis lation.. jjis record, however, that will never be challenged is in oDntempiuously . casting away nearly every principle of constitutional 1 Government, Mr Reid wants constitutional reform. As a mat* tsr of fact, however, . jie wanlB as little constitution ss possible. He cao get along more comfortably without it, or, A rather, notwithstanding it. When Mr Reid was a clerk at the Treasury he-could uever rssia^ Uie temp tation to talk politics with anybody and everbedy who saw liirp on dopartpient matters. He had little relish for the duties attached to his position. He was' ; a perfect glutton oi Parliamentary 'scraps aud political gos9ip» lie cared for. ; nothi'og~ else' and he was only happy when he was talking on his lpved' topic. Books bored him, the' fine arts failed to intArnat him find thn thanrAlinal and nrAQ~ deal sciences received no attention from htm, Mr Reid merely studied for the Bar to enable him to give greater freedom 16\. his passion, for politics A habK of Mr Reid, when he is listen ing to anyone talking .directly to liim^ is the nodding of his head right on to hia. chest, if he agrees with the- person.. . Q» swiogs hie head i.n this fashion, occasion? ally, with- alarming rapidity, as though he were trying hard lo throw it off his shoulders. When the Preuiior does not _ happen to . faW iu with the* views of the member who buttolrlioles hnn, he scrapes his neck with his fingers or -scratches his eye brow with his pointed thumb. The fear that Mnjiwbone Nield would go to London in charge of the- N'.JS.W. , exhibits to the Earl'b. Court Exhibition induced members to koock this project in the head. Somehow or other the gallant Majaw has succeeded in getting himself unpopular in Parliament. He seems to Ua IC flia^ ho I.e. a maonl^nt presence and that he gives tone to the Assembly and members don't appreciate the pntronag.4. Then the atmosphere gfis aff&ir-.and; the Ilawarra Harbour project decided his fellow members.
