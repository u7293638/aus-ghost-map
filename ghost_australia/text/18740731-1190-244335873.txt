SPIRITISM. To dte Editor of The Herald. Sir. — It Is no w three weeks since I asked a few questions on Spiritism, not only of A. Browo, but any 3piritisb. They havo none of them attempted to answer me, not because the answers would have been uninteresting, or that the questions wore so foolish. No; they dared not attempt to answer.- The manner in whioh they were put gave them no chance for conjuring, or false statements. Was thero any truth in Spiritism they would have hoen only too eager to give proof, and not the paltry reason they have. I will now ask them a few more imbecile questions : Did the spirits inform A. Bro'we that I was a religious fanatic ? If so, they never told a greater falsehood in their spiritual existence, but in- creatures com posed of tho double distilled essence of moonshine (so say Spiritists), it Is pardon able. Or was it a statement of A. Erewe's made in a fit of spleen ? Whichever it w.n it is not tiuth. -lI oan prove, if necessary,' that I havo not -boon -y"1- — 3 religious auuumination for the IaBt six years. Your correspondent says that answors to my question would have been uninteresting. I can assure him that had ho the power whioh Spiritists pretend to have, aud havo got anawere to my questions from bis spirit friends, he would alter his opinion. It is acknowledged by those who know mo that few men have led such an eventful aud ad venturous lifo as I havo. I can give proof for what I state, and not shirk it liko a mean numbugging Spiritist.

If they are witches, he's or bug e, why don't they do as witches of oia Cjo said to have done ? — raise up or bring down their ghosts, and let as have a look at them ; never mind tablos, chairs, or chamber utensils. Haselmeyer oould tako the shine out of all Spiritists at that game. — Yours truly. INQUISITIVE.
