MR. PUNCH'S CHRISTMAS DINNER. Hurrah ! for the season of jollity, Bother all trading and stuff, Let's give ourselves up to frivolity And sing out " Evoe" each muff ! Let grief and ill humour be vanished, ' Tis treason to think of it now ; ' Tis penal, till Christmas has vanished, To dream of the ghost of a row ! Pi nch, brimming right o'er with hilarity Invites all his readers to dine, To remedy number's disparity He's hit on a plan rather fine. His readers beneath his mahogany Are rather too main" to trim, Each can dine with his special cosmogony And fancy they're dining with him! The soup shall be Bailey's composing, Keen sparkling, and clear as his wit ; The fish is at Martin's disposing — He's long had a wish for a bit — The entrees Jeff Eagar's, in uniform, With Wilson to carry him through, And the jellies and mysteries cuniforin Are Badham's — a rare cordon bleu ! Our joints shall he Parkes's provision — De yho'stibics non disputandum — Our wines go by Cumming's decision, Bight well he can tell how to brand ' em, Dessert sulky Will shall supply us, No fear that he'll fail in the job, he Is used to it, fierce though he eye us, Deserting his friends is his hobby ! For toastmaster, loud and loquacious, Farnell to the table we'll fetch, With lungs leather-lined and capacious, He'll talk for eight hours at a stretch. Our chairman Tom Garrett, the noisy, Whose loss of a berth we deplore ; A taste of his previous joys, he Shall feel at our table once more ! And when all the bumpers are finished; When claret and port dull are found ; When hard drinking guests have diminished, Joe Wearne shall the coffee take round. The host then, selecting the right 'uns, Shall marshal them off in a bunch ; 'Neath the table leave snoring the tight 'uns, And brew a grand jorum of Punch !
