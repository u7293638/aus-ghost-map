A.RC. GRAND NATIONAL MEETING. SECOND DAY-SATURDAY, ' AUGUST 2(k The Adelaide Racing Club were again lucky in being favoured with beautiful weather for the second day of their Grand National Meet ing. The result waa that thcro was a very laciscactory attenaanco at v ictoria rark. 1 ne totalizator waa well patronised, £11,574 being invested as compared with &I.G1G; 10*. last fear, and £10,874 in lStX'i. Tho total amount put through on the two days was £3,300 more tan received last August. Of the dozen on the card in tho Selling Kaco Filbert was the only absentee, and his retirement was com pulsory, ai he was nominated as a chestnut mare instead of a brown gelding, (juickshot was solocti.-d as the tnqit likely to score, but Kaso, who behaved butter at the barrier c:i this occasion, had him iu trouble at the li.W distance and beat him by two and a half lengths. KasB, who paid a dividend of £3 19a., did not elicit a bid when submitted to the hammer. Little Martiu was backed down to 6 to 4 for the Second Hurdle Kact, Regent carrying the most money of the othors. The field included the ex- Victorian Carbonate, who. however, was not in much demand, he having only arrived 'a couple of days previously. Conscript made the runnjng to the scvun-furlong post, where ho was joined by Albury Queen, but though the ptir held *n advantage of several leugtbs along the back Thackaringa showed the way over tho tint hurdle in the straight. Dr. Stewart's gelding looked all over a wiener iu tho run home, but after landing over the last obstacle Howie, riding a very dotermiiied finish on tbo favourite, got up in the last fuw strides, and gained tho verdict by a nock, witti Regent a length and a half off. Thy ti(;ht for places would have Itoen even more interesting had not Albury Queen fallen at th-j last hurdle and brought Conscript and Conventioner over her. Devcnev and Bi'nos, who y/ere on Cjn scriptand Albury Queen respectively, bad to bo carried in, but fortunately neither was seriously hurt. The scratching pen w&% not resorted to in the Daiuecteville Stakes, and of the fourteen youngsters who were weighed out Thunder Prince and Gipsy Bill disputed favouritism. Tbo former, who was sold a week ago by Mr. Nicholson to C. Quinn for 100 so vs., on Satur day carried the same colours as those worn by Once More. Probability had a substantial following, but Malvurn. though sbo ran third in the Fuihatn Paik Plate, was not in much request. From what looked a capital start Gipsy Bill iva-s the quickest on his legs, and keeping his place in the van he took part in the final struggle with Malvorn and Tnunder Prince. He, however, suffered defeat by half a lontrth »t tbe bauds of Malvorn, while Thunder Prince missed second honours by three-quarters of a length. Hills filly, Perfect, was a good fourth, and Probability ran well under her increased weight, while Federation was very prominent to the pickets. Malvern was bred at Fulham Park, and claims the relationship of full sistei to Marryatvillo, being by Thunderbolt from De Novo. 'She ran on Saturday in the inte rests of Mr. \V. A. Bladder, who personally superintends her training. Thunder Prince pulled up, as usual, lams. Father Confessor being scratched left ten in the Grand National Steeplechase. Kclipse was instaiieii nrst lavounie, tits price in tne maciiino boing represented at 3 to 1. Stock ings was quoted at a point longer, and then ranked Allahditta and Happy Jack, but Mimosa would have paid a £10 dividend. The treble in front of tho Grand Stand had to be first negotiated, and as the whole of the eandidates, headed by Ascanius and brought up by Cataract, cleared it without a mistake :ho crowd applauded. After they had got out of the enclosure and were heading for the milepost Supple .lack ran to the front and ied Allahditta, on whom Barr was pulling double, but the lot wero pretty well bunched with the exception of Cataract, who was already in trouble. Tbe field on cln*) terms were piloted by Allahditta, Ascaniuj, Mimosa, and Supple Jack at tho South-terrace double, but Asoanius toppled over at tho fence in the dip. With him out of the road Supple Jack was iu possession from Allahditta,Miino$a, and Stockings, but making the treble the second tinio Joskin brought Happy Jack to tho fore, and sailed away out of the pad dock from Supple Jack, Mimosa. Kchpso, Stockings, and Allahditta. The defeat of the South-Eastern representative was proclaimed at the milepost, Evauston and Union Jack having previously cried a 'go.' When the South-terrace double was reaohed Happy Jack bad four lengths' lead of Mimosa, who was closely attended by Eclipse. Stockings, and Supple Jack, but Mimosa immediately joined the leader, and thev ran together to the last fence on the hilL Tfiisproved fatal tot lie mare, and nearly ako caused the downfall of Happy Jack, who struck it so heavily that aiter land ing Stockings ran past him and led down the straight. Joskin, however, set sail again after Stockings, and, catching him at tho pickets, beat him home, and landed tho 330 sovs. for Mrs. M. J. Griffin. Eclipse was half a dozon lengths otf third, and Allah ditta fourth, followed by Union Jack, but Evanaton and Supple Jack made mistakes. Had Mimosa not fallen at the last jump she would nearly have won, as she waa going very well at the time. Unfortunately Mr. Murphy not only missed the first or second prize, but bis mare was.so badly hurt that^he will never ra^j again. Too splendid neld of nineteen came out in the Mayor's Milo. and after his performance in the Buxton Handicap Hainault was backed down to 'J to I. After him ranked Blue Blood at sevens, but bar these two lu to 1 was procurable, Statfa heading the others in tbo quotations. A finely contested race saw Blue Blood and Severndale as the pacomakers, while tbe favourite was not too well placed, but he came through his field fast from the distance, and won handsomely by a length and a quarter from tbo outsidor Thunder King, with Alveary third. Sparta wan a good fourth, followed by Statfa, lilue Mood and Cicero. Had Thunder King got home first bo would have paid a dividend of KUfX Another large field passed the scale* in tbo Cor|K-ration Stakes, seven teen out of tho eighteen on the card crying con tent. Marryatville went out first favourite at 'J} to 1, Security being n»xt in demand, but backer* evidently thought tho extra 11 1b. whicii Mr. Hughes had placed on Esau would stop him from *--oriiitf, as be was quoted at nearly *Ji- to 1. Tho Boolka gelding, however, cut down the leaders iufcide the pickets, and scored with greater ease than he did tho pre vious Saturday, Marryatvillo beating Once Moro by three-quarters of a length for second place. Security finished alongside Once More, and then came l-ouiso. The following are tbe particulars of the running : — SELLING RACK.

Albury Queen had drawn to within three lengths of Conscript at the milepost, the mare being four lengths clear of Thackaringa, Regent, Conventioner, Little Martin, and Car bonate, who were well together. Con script was joined by Albury Queen at tbe soven-furlon^r post, tbe pair being half a dozen lengths clear of Thackaringa and Regent, who were followed by Conventioner and Little Martin. Albury Queen just headed Con script past the six-furlong post, but a furlong Dearer home they were together again eight lengths in advance of Thaokaringa, who was followed four or five lengths away by Regent, Conventioner. and Little Martin together.

Thackaringa led over tbo first hurdle in the straight from Albury Qusen. Little Martin, and Conscript, and at the next obstacle he was holding his own from Little' Martin and Regent.
