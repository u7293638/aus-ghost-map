TO THE EDITOR. Sir—In a recent issue appears a report from Mr. Kirkham Evans on-the above sub ject, and as my name is pretty freely used by him I trust yon will favour me with space for a few remarks relative thereto. I was really amused at the glowing account given by Mr. EvanB of his own cleverness in de tecting and exposing this fraud, and the fright caused amongst the Blackrock rustics —myself inoluded, I suppose — by Sissy Schultze's performances, which he cha racterizes a pretty piece of acting. Being informed by Mr. Rodeghiero, at whose place the family at present are staying, that a Mr. Evans from Adelaide, who according to the letter bad nine years' previous experience in England in connection with manifestations of this kind, requested permission to come and examine the child, which he con sented to, and telegraphed a reply. I also asked Mr. R. s permission to be allowed to be in the room with him, which was also granted. Bnt, behold! on Mr. Evans's arrival at Blackrock he wanted no person to be allowed in the room bnt him self and Mr. W. A. Jones, the local school master, who considers himself a perfect adept in matters of this kind, and who was engaged almost regularly nightly since the child came here in investigating the matter. At the time I thought this a very strange request, but since reading Mr. Evans's report the whole transaction has been made quite clear. If these two were left alone in the room with the child there could be no evi dence of a rebutting nature to bring for ward. In the following remarks I leave yonr | readers to judge for themselves. After having, as I suppose, due prepara tions made for catching the ghost or finding out the cauBe of the disturbance, they announced to Mr. Schultze that all was in readinesB if the child would go to bed. Sissy, who was playing in the room with the other children at the time, was asked by her father if ehe was not sleepy, to which she replied in the negative. Not wishing to keep the visitors too late, Mr. Schultze prevailed on the child to undress and go to bed, in case the manifestations appeared that night, so as to give Mr. Evans a good opportunity of examining the phenomenon. Sometimes two or three nightB pass without the chiid being disturbed by any of these fits, and conse quently nobody could tell whether the child is to be disturbed or not before going to bed, excepting on rare occasions. To our surprise, in about two minutes after lying down she | heavily, wqb noticed to be breathing heavily, and her head slightly moving from side to side on the i pillow, followed soon afterwards by convul-1 sive jerks of the body aud arms. About this time another person, in consequence of importunate entreaties, was admitted, the | Rev. J. Hancock, of Port Augusta, announced by Mr. Evans. The candle was then extinguished and some slight knocks were heard. After remaining for a time in the state described by Mr. Evans, the candle was relit, and him- | self and Mr. Jones proceeded to the bed and I.,,,., +„ +),„ uncovered the child s legs to above the knees, Mr. Evans feeling the different parts of the leg. At laBt, laying his hand on the kneecap, he exclaimed—"I have it. Here is what | makes the knockB. I thought so before I left Adelaide. 1 knew it could be nothing else." Whereupon Mr. Jones oontradicted him by showing that he couid produce similar sounds with the kneecap of the other leg by catching between the thumb and forefinger and moving it from side to side. They put the child's foot into a box, and by moving the kneecap as stated, tried ineffectually to produce similar soundB to those heard. Daring the whole time the child resembled a person in a trance, being undoubtedly oblivious of what wub transpiring, so far as any impartial person could judge. On leaving the room we were met in the store on our way out bv Mr. Rodeghiero, who asked both Messrs, Jones and Evans if they bad discovered how the knocks were caused or what was disturbing the child, to which Mr, Evans replied that he had not rightly satisfied himself, and would wish to investi gate the matter further, for whicb purpose he promised to remain at Blackrock for another night, unless he obtained permission to take the child with him to Adelaide. Your readers after this statement will, I hope, know wbat value to attach to the one stating the child caused the knocks by putting ont her bands under the bedclothes and rapping on the ground, which event Mr. Evans, in my opinion, would be only | too glad to be correct. I may mention that during tbe time the ohild was in this state they tried unsuccessfully to wake her by holding a bottle containing ammonia to her nose. It undoubtedly caused the child to jump in the bed and bring her head slightly towards the bedclothes. There were other experiments also tried, but none had the i effect of awaking her. " The pretty piece of acting" is undoubtedly preying on the child's system, sb she seems to be a good deal thinner now than when she was brought | here. If Mr. Evans found, as he states, that the child produced the knocks herself, can he explain how it was he tried so hard to get Mr. Schnltze's consent to letting the child go to Adelaide for fnrther experiments 1 It might enlighten the public mind a little. Ur Evans acknowledges having tried his hand at the knocking, bnt I remarked to him at the time that he conld not suoceed. On meeting both Messrs. Jones and Evans on the following day (Jnne 2) at the railway station Mr. Evans wanted to know if I was going to send in any report of what I saw. I told them that I had already done so, and as I did not know what conclusion they had arrived at that I would not do so until I saw theirs. They then informed me that they had had a report written, the substance of which tbev would not tell me then. I was very much surprised at hearing that fidr. Evans, after his promise of the previous night to remain for future investigation, con templated leaving for Adelaide by the next train. Mr. Evans informed me that he was a member of the Psychological Society and that he came here to investigate the matter in the canse of science ; that he wanted to make the thing appear a fraud, as the Adelaide people were going mad—some of them fit eubjeots for the Lunatic Asylum — through forming circles or sdances since this affair started ; and asked me not to contradict his statement, which would in dae course be in the Adelaide papers, unless the same reflected in any way upon my previous reports. I consider a person capable of such mean and con temptible conduct to be a far greater fraud than those whom he tries to condemn as such—Sissy Schultze. This is on a par with the Shropshire pigs standing on their heads and singing the National Anthem. As for the two sticks of toffy to be supplied to SiBsy daily, 1 never heard of it until I saw it stated in that report. It is very strange that Mr. Evans would not tell anybody here that he fonnd out how the knocks were cauBed, but when he got as far as Petersburg the bridle broke and his tongue got Ioobo. Being disappointed in not obtaining permission to take the child with him as he expected, his statements afterwards remind me very forcibly of the story about tbe " Fox ana Graces." Mr. Evans after his trip from Adelaide found that he could not unravel the ghost story here, so he thought he would assign some cause for it. What a pity, after coming such along distance, that he was compelled to eive ud the chost. I am, Sir, &c.;, JBlacbrock, June 15. A. HE ALT.
