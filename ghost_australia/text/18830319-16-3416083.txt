LOGAN AND ALBERT RACES. By Pegasus. On Friday morning Beaudesert presented a scene of unusual excitement, and at an early hour a stream of horsemen and horsewomen set in toward the racecouise. The course itself is sbout 2 miles and a half from the township, and is situated on a level plain in a paddock be- longing to Mr. Markwell. In shape it is circu lar, with the exception of that portion com- monly known as the straight running, and the turn into this is at present rather too abrupt, and might be modified with advantage. Though no grandstand has yet been erected, nature partly supplies the deficiency, for there is a rocky knoll from which a capital view of the various races was obtained and on and about this a large number of the spectators were congre- gated. The new from the course was a very pretty one, and the rich pasture land around, with the mountains in the distance, formed a scene which, though it might be equalled, could hardly be surpassed in any part of the colony. Four-in-hands and buggies of all sorts were numerous, and a large contingent of visitors had arrived from Bris- bane, Southport and the surrounding stations, showing the interest which was taken by the inhabitants in the races. The meeting must in every respect be considered a most unquali- fied success and this is entirely owing to the exertions of the stewaeds and to the indefati- gable hon. secretary, Mr. Brayford, who unfortunately met with a severe accident early in the morning, by striking his forehead against a projecting sapling, notwithstanding which everything was got through without the slightest check or hindrance. Of jollity there was plenty, of drunkenness and rowdyism there was none, and in fact excepting the above mentioned accident to Mr Brayford, no contretemps occurred to mar the harmony of the day. The racing itself was of a most interesting character, though (except in the Selling Race) there were no very close finishes. Considerable curosity was felt as to how the Clarence and Richmond horses would come off when pitted against such Brisbane cracks as Legacy and Adamantea and, as will be seen below, the visitors had nearly all the best of it, but their victories were well deserved, as their horses were in the pink of condition, neither wanting work nor having had too much of it. Punctual to the minute proceedings com- menced with the Two and Three year old Sap- ling Stakes and out of the nine horses entered seven faced the starter, the absentees being Mr. James Williams's Explorer, and Mr. J. P. Jost's Sportsman. Nancy and Peerless were about equal favourites. A very fair start was effected, and Laura showed in front with a good lead but before half the distance was traversed, Caducia had run up and passed her. At the turn into the straight Nancy and Peerless came out, the former winning pretty easily by about two lengths, Caducia, well up, being third. This latter filly ran extremely well for a first essay and possesses a dash of foot which will render her very formidable over short distances. The winner was as fit as hands could make her and over three quarters of a mile her favourite distance, is at present almost invincible. Peerless ran like a good honest mare and seemed as if she would have been better served over a longer distance. After this the hurdle horses were eagerly scanned, and public opinion was pretty evenly divided between Pastime and Blazeaway, though many fancied the good looking New Chum. Mr. Edwards's old horse was looking very well, and presented a great contrast to his wretched appearance when last at Eagle Farm. Both Briar-root and Czar took their jumps re- markably well, but both were a bit outclassed. New Chum at the second hurdle baulked and unshipped his rider, but none of the others made any mistakes, and the finish promised to be an exciting one, but the weight proved to be too much for the chestnut, and Pastime, who made most of the running, kept his place to the finish, and won with something in hand After about an hour's spell for lunch the principal event of the day came on for decision, and out of the ten acceptants there was but one absentee, Mr. Jost's Nancy. Adamantea and Lady Vanda were about equal favourites, their price being quoted as 5 to 2, while 3 to 1 was obtainable about Legacy, 3 to 1 Mussulman, and 10 to 1 against any other. The result was a complete surpnse, as the lightly weighted five year old Response, who was simply thrown in at 7st. 5lb., took the lead half a mile from home and won with ease from Lady Vanda, 8st. 12lb., Legacy 8st. 8lb., being third. This running completely justified my remarks some weeks ago, as Mr. Bundock's mare by her run- ning on this course last year, when just off the grass, showed that she had a good dash of foot and must therefore be considered as having been very highly favoured in the matter of weights. Legacy, though anything but cherry ripe, beat Adamantea in their places as I pre- dicted and no excuses can be made for Mr. Mooney's filly but the important one that she had too much weight to carry. The winner pleased me much by her ap- pearance though not having so much polish on her as many of the others, she was very fit and moved with great freedom. Lady Vanda had a very taking style of going, her long sweeping stride being much admired. Among the others Lord Nelson was thoroughly outclassed and distanced while Gascon very much disappointed the expectations which had been formed of him. Centurion was very big, and may, per- haps, be got fit for the Q.T.C. races in May, but hardly before. The Selling Stakes, for which there were three starters, produced the best race of the day, Mr. Makwell's Bandy and Mr. Patten- son's Paddy being head and head up the straight, both at the whip the former winning a well contested race ultimately by half a length. After the race, Bandy was put up to auction by Mr. Bell, and realised £16, one sovereign in advance of his selling price. The weights for the Short Handicap, which are given below, hardly gave satisfaction, as out of sixteen entries nine scratched. Adamantea 7 st. 2 lb., was spotted as a cer- tainty but the former race had been enough for her, and she could only get third to the two top weights. Young Australia, 9 st. 4 lb., and Response, 8 st.13 lb., who finished first and second. The principal incident in the race was the running of Sportsman, better known as the Scrap's colt who appeared hopelessly beaten at the back of the course, but came again with a rush, and finished well up. The day's proceedings were wound up by a Hack Race, which was won by Pilate a horse that was entered and trained for the recent races at Southport and actually won the Free Handicap on Saturday, beating such a good performer as Nancy. Mr.John Haygarth officiated as starter with great success and Mr. Ernest White as judge had no very diffi- cult task to perform while Mr. Brayford as f secretary was assiduous in the discharge of his duties.

Though a greatei numbei of people were e\ pected on the second day of the races, there was no lalfjer attendance than on Friday, and perhaps this was owing to the attraction of a ball which took place at Beaudesert on the night pre»ions, and »»Inch was kept up till after daylight The probabilities aie that many of the dancers ne» or put in an appear ance at the races, and the numbei of specta tors, winch ne»ei exceeded 700 oi SOO, was less than »vere pi esent on the «ame day list yeai Hie fields of horses too, were considerably curtailed, it haiing become quite emlent to those who«e hoises »»cie not half ht oi »»ere in any wa» amiss that they were fai better in their stnlls Foi the future ow nei s w ill sec the folly of ti eating the gathei ing at Beaudesert as a country meet in,;
