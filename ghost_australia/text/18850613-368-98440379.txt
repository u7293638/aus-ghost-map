A Bathurst telegram says:-The mongrel dogs are causing much destruction in George's Plains among the sheep. One farmer has lost Â£10 worth in a fortnight; and in'two successive nights 45 sheep were killed, among them some stud rams and owes. Other farmers in the neighbourhood have lost 90 valuable sheep in a few weeks from the same cause. They cannot kill the dogs, as the owners may claim damhages, and the dog owners are not worth proceeding against. The general opinion is that the Dog Act should be amended to meet such eases.'
