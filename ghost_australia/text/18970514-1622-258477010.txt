STRANGE AUSTRALIAN FISH. Several varieties of fishes which have long disappeared from other parts of the world are still represented in New South Wales. Amongst these are the " cestracion,"' or Port Jackson shark, whose teeth resemble those of fossils found in the mesozoic deposits, and the 44 ceratodua,''an existing ganoid, otherwise exclusively represented in the trias formation, its anatomy showing a connecting link between a lizard and a fi.sh. Amongst other remarkable fishes found in these waters several may be enumerated. The frog fish has fins adopted for walking on the ground rather thm for swimming, and is found floating in-shore amongst marine plants, from which it is with difficulty disv tirguished, owing to its great resemblance to them in point of colour. But there are queerer fish still. The hopping fish, a variety of gobi, or kea, gudgeon, has its fins developed iuto legs, so that the animal is able to leap along the mud flats which it frequents. The eyes of this fish are curiously placed at the top of its head, and are capable of being thrust far cut of their sockets, and of moving independently of one another. The hippocampus, or sea-horse, so named from a resemblance in the shape of the head and fore part of the body to that of the horse, is a very singular fish, but the phyllopteryx is, pcrhnps, the most remarkable fish of Australia, if not of the world. It is like tho ghost of a sea-horse, with its winding bheet all in ribbons around it. Its tattered cerements are in shape and colour like tho seaweed it frequents, so that it hides and feeds in safety.
