THE COMMISSION RACKET. To THE EDITOR.-IBa,-I would like to ask the North Melbourne Council if it is a fact that the present surveyor receives commission on his own estimates or on the actual amount tecderad for and accepted by the contractor. If the sur veyor estimates for a job which he considers worth £500 and charges, say 5 per cent., that entitles him to £P25, but if the contractor does it for £350, what then? Of course the difference is not much, only £7 10s, but in the course of a year on the same proportion the amount would come to a nice little penny. Perhaps Cr Blrwise who is entitled to the thanks of the ratepayers for his actions in the Council, will furnish the infor mation I desire. I think Cri Petrie, King ard IoHederson should bestir them selves and not let or Barwise do all the necessary faultfinding and ' unearthing the ghosts of the chamber." Yours obediently, AnoYEBOARD.
