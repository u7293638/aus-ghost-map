This test, it is certified, Keating bears. We remember an article in. the Century written. b~y one of the subjects of a public mesmeriser, in which he describes the frauds that are practised in the name of "hypnotism. This writer asserted that paid men do pretend unconsciousness, and endure sufferings which appear incredible without it. To such an extent does an eight-days uninterrupted slumber contradict; ordinary experience that some degree of incredulity in Heating's case 13 natural. - But it seems to shock probability even more violently that Keating should merely be playing an excessively-unpleasant part than that he is actually under the control of Mr. Kennedy, whose will can obliterate tho world for him as long as eight days at a stretch. \- The professional operator iv tHs inte resting case invited the attention of the medical profession to Keating's cataleptic trance, and several doctors have not thought it beneath their dignity to pay it the compliment of observation. It is of course primarily a show and not a scientific experiment. That, however, is no reason why the scientific problem which it certainly involves should be ignored. Some medical men are repelled by the element of charlatanry with which the curious phenomena of hypnotism were originally entangled, and from which they are not evenyet"wholly disconnected. At a meeting of the British Medical As sociation Dr. Norman Kerr in unmeasured terms denounced -hypnotism and all its works, and strongly deprecated any attempt by the medical profession to investigate and experiment in it, and so lend countenance to a pernicious and dangerous practice. According to Dr. Kerr so few people are sensitive to hypnotic influence that as a therapeutic agent in disease it can. but rarely be used, and when used the remedy is worse than the disease. Hypnotism, to his mind, is simply a distorted cere [bral condition _ which, having.-been in-. duced upon the subject, causes him to forget pain for the time being without touching the seat of pam at all. The prolongation of such a state or its fre quent repetition reduces-a patient to the nerveless condition of a jelly fish, and establishes between hypnotiser -and hypnotic a most dangerous relation. "Its mobt likely result would be to land the patient eventually in a lunatic asylum " Were thib the case it would be fortunate for humanity if the hypnotist's brain-destroying art could be exercised only on a few. The propositions of Dr. Kerr are not, however, indisputable. Thus, as to his first assertion, Dr. ~8. W. Richardson affirms that the impressionable persons -who will yield to powerful hypnotic suggestions aie by no means insignificant in numb?r. He describes them as neurotics, ready at any moment to be overcome by external impressions, and to give way to commands or instructions flowing from a superior will. Correctly speaking, they are per sons predisposed to impressional in-. -fiuences, and in some respects to an enfeebled organisation. Di_ .Richardson hazards the snppositaen that they may really be "degenerates,' on whom heredity has inflicted the- doom of carrying into 'titua age the psychical weaknesses of the unenlightened time when people believed in ghosts, and witches, and fairies. Many of them "suffer from hysteria, and all are more or less hysterically inclined. Accepting this view of the hypnotic temperament, it would, ceitainly appear prudent not to take any risk of an. aggravation of hysterical tendencies, either for money or relief from pain. The mesmeriser's sub jects rarely mike public their experiences for the benefit of. the uninformed, but we recollect certain interesting " Confessions of a JEypnofcisee" published some years ago by a Mr. Arthur Hawton. His testi mony, which may be given for wliat it is worth, is quite opposed to that of Dr. Kerr as to the necessarily evil results of hypnotism. "I have been a subject for the last thirteen years," he wrote, "and far from ex periencing any inconvemenceirom being hypnotised as many as a dozen tunes a day, I may say that I have actually felt physically, morally, but chiefly intellec tually better for it. Not only so, but I have had exceptional opportunities for studying the case of other habitual, or, as Charcot callb them, ' trained' hypnotic subjects, and can honestly say that they showed a higher status of intelligence than others of similar educa tion, and were certainly benefited by it." .But this result is hardly what one v would expect from surrendering the will, and accepting the position of a mere automa ton to be played upon by another. " Apart from other objections, the un certainty of hypnotia^ansEsthesia is a serious drawback to its employment for the purpose of critical operations in surgery. It has, however, been successfully ap plied in many cases of minor operations. Teeth "may be painlessly drawn under sug gestion, abscesses and growths removed, and even amputation and lithotomy have been performed under hypnotic influence. The therapeutic value of suggestion in cases of nervous trouble is likely to become more generally recognised. It is possible, too, that much good may be dene by it in dissolving the spell of in jurious habits. An English doctor says, l"I have seen the "confirmed _drunkard throw the gin bottle out of the window in extreme disgust," and some time ago at a private seance Dr. Milne Bramwell showed a "patient whom he had com pletely cured of drunkenness by sugges tion. Many a sufferer from insomnia probably envies Frederick Keating, and would be glad enough of the hypnotises help if it could be had without moral or physical deterioration. As~yet the- scien tific study of hypnotism, despite the impetus given by the investigations 'oi Charcot and Luys, has hardly passed "beyond the fringe of this mysterious subject. Mr. Kennedy, m has public performances, plays on the two strings of the marvellous and the amusing. He subordinates the scientific aspect to the necessity of myt, tifying and entertaining a mixed audience, and this of course is not an ideal mode of treating an intensely serious subject. One never quite knows what to make of .such shows as a prolonged fast or a prolonged sleep under conditions in which the suspicion of a "fake" is not entirely quelled. But if Prederick Keating cannot be ex plained except as a sham, he certainly puts up with a good deal for his salary. If he is really entranced, he spends his time more sensibly at any rate than the American who five yeaTs ago^ent a "week without sleep for a wager.
