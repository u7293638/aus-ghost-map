J. B. Patterson, he Hays politics don't appear much of a spree. He sits in the House alone, even among the crowd. He is cheek by jowl with the Iuterjeetor-General Anderson. The one laughs again. Nothing can depress Anderson very long. But as for Patterson, he is smiloless. He might be a ghost revisiting the glimpses of tho moon for all the human nature he exhibits. The j-oct depicts him thus :â€” Hough and bluff, and unable to flatter one, He acts as aPull-joy to scatter fun. Surly and grim, Without kindness or vim, Is the Parliament Bogeyman Patterson.
