T remain here owing ashore At one of the resurrection anon), he niggers and the ship's corporal stuck his spoon in the will , because, I'm thinking, it wasn't very likely that a fellow Wool Over sup burg so again when his (head and his he fy had parted company, Well, no buried him in a wild kind of a spot, who c there was a few grave stones with a nine s chiselled open and some were cut with a kit are, showing four inches or a summer and sponge, and the t to grow all over the ground, and the rank grass and Wests run up the tombs , it was a wilderness sort of a place, and here it was that Corporal Jack was laid up in ordinary. the party to which I he longed, was commanded by (Mr Quinton, a muster t mine and our br unds lay within a short distance of this hero burying-ground and so, d'ye mind, the, morning after they'd lowered the corpse al down the is in the way of other world, I was posed at the point 'n at the corporal's berth, and a shipmate was with me by way of company likened that I was a few rd or any thing living or dead but I had always a soft of'iWriil'antipnlby to being left ashore, particulars in the dark. I'll here was also a nigger be Owing to the plantation, who we allowed to join us just by w iv of being civil to him, as he was a kind of stew aids plate in the house, and used to splice the am brace for us occasionally Well, messmates, we got knotting our yarns to keep us from getting d away and to cheer our spirits, we overhauled a good all deal about ghosts, and stories and hobble, goblins and all such like justices of the peace, till the nigger-lb y called him Hannibal, after the line-of-battle ship, I suppose say, till the nigger declared that every hair on his head stood as stiff as a crowbar, " Ava'sl there'" once lived Bill Jennings, ' tell that torso marines an you will, marry the black for New's fiend was woolly and; curled like a Flemish (fake, and yet you say it was as stiff as a of how bar." " And so it was-the more the wonder, ' grow- led the boatswain's mate. " VI ould you have his honour there think I keep a false reasonings Well, as I was a saying, his dead looked like a black pot. cup-tie with his quills up All at once we heard a tremendous rattling amongst the dry leaves of a plantain 'grounds, but the trees were too thick to see What it was even if there had by o i light enough, which there warn't, as Mia sun hadn't brought his hammock up, but was only just turning out." " ' Dare him debbil come again,' cried the nigger, and away he started, as if a nor'-wester bad kicked him and-ways. " ' What's the Hack rascal after,' said my messmate ' 'Nar,' says I that's more than I can tell, but not being a Christian, and only a poor ignoramus of a nigger, I suppose he's afeard that the noise yonder is Davy Jones playing at single-stick, and mayhap he u ay think the ould gem in a n is hauling Ins wind upon this lack, and may take his black muzzle for one of his imps. But that's a pretty bobbed they're kicking up, at all events, and now it's going in the direction of the burying ground " " ' I tell you what it is, Jack, says my mess- mate, who looked very cautiously round him, as if he was rowing guard in on enemy's port, Pte 1 you what it is 1 never thinks they give the devil his due, for between you and me I don't know as he's half so bad as many people makes him out. Our persons says he's black, but the niggers paints him white, but for my part, I'm thinking that the colour of a ship's paint goes for nothing. Then n> for his horns, why they're g by 1 owing, to be sure , but though they are ugly lo k g, I never heard a his doing any mischief by running stem on with them And after all shipmate,' be continued, ' you must own there's a great deal in fancy. Look at your love garb esse s, that run their noses out to the heel of the jib boom, and carry all their bowsprit harbour 1 ' Now I call that sort of' ring neither ship shape nor Bristol fashion, for a ship's head is a ship's head, and a ship s bowsprit is a ship's bowsprit, but it they go to make a standing bowsprit of a ship's head, then, I'm thinking they me but club body rigged ' Now messmates, you must own that his arguments was a bit of a poser. But holiday, there's a precious rose " ' Precious row indeed I, saw my companion a why Jackway I'm blessed I-look to ore-if that, prn't the skeleton of Corporal Jack walking oil with his own head under his a m , then I'm but here comes Mr Q nation and the nigger.' " 1 did look, messmates, towards the burying ground, and there I saw a sort of long-legged skeleton straddling over the graves like an Albatros s topping a great awe 1, and, sure enough the general's head was under his long, spider Le arms " ' Dere, Mnssa Q I reckon,' said 1 the black fellow ' now he see 'em for I self ' ' By Jove and so it is boy, cried rhetorician. ' 'Ay, Ay, sir,' Says my messmate e n's the corporal there's no mistaking his cut-water, but he must have fallen away mightily during the night to be so scantily provided with flesh this morning, how -forever, mayhap the climate has not 11d ham d urn ' ' ' He no melt 'em,' cried the nigger, be out 'tra for true ' " ' What ' eat his own head,' Bays The must be in dreadful want of a mr al Come, come, and chap, that's too heavy to be hoisted in " Well, all this while the skeleton was walking off with his head in his arms, just as a nurse would carry a baby , but the officer uses a rifle to his shout er, and it made me laugh to think he was going to shoot a skeleton without a head, and that was as dead as Adam's grandmother 1 to goodness sake, sir' save me messmate, ' don't go for to he, for it would be doing t blas phones to kill a dead body and what makes the- follow turn out his hammock after being rushed up for a full due, I can't tell.' " Bang went the rifle, and down dropped the corn soul's agony , but up it got again almost di roomy and in are to 1 for the bush, leaving his head he had to lighten ship. Off starts the black fellow after him and away went the officer close to his heels. My et les shipmate,' says I there must be some sport in chasing a skeleton , so e'en Iel' keep in their wake and see it out ' So off we set and presently bang went the rifle again and away (flew the corn eral's splinters ; so the skeleton girl here himself up, and then laid down on the ground, kill- ing and so away g like a had whale in his flurry, in of I, we ran up a d there we found now what do you think messmates Why, it was nothing more nor less than a large land-crab, that was walking away with the corporal's head as easy as I'd curry of cocoa-nut " " Those land crabs have a power of strength, said old Darby " I recollects one night being beached high and dry in the small cutter, and I housekeeper, so I catches one of these beasts, line claps burn under the bows of the boat, whilst 1 made fast the painter to his hind leg, and then away he stretched out for the water, dragging the cutter with him, as if had been no more than a mouldy, biscuits, and if I hadn't cut the painter pretty smartly, he'd have towed us out to sea in no time " The legs of these clubs must be very long," said I, " are here bodies in proportion" " it by to your honour " replied the boatswain' mate , " the r bodies are but small, seeing that they are all ribs and trucks, but their claws are tremendous What d'ye think of their reaching up to the top of a gibbet, and having unhooked a plant that v, is hung in chains, walked off with him hoops and all, so that he never was found again in a If it really happened," I replied, His truly astonishing " " Really happened ' ' cried the veteran, somewhat scornfully. ' Ax them as was watching down at Cabrita point that night, and see if they won't swear to it " ' Perhaps it was some of the friends of the pirate who removed the body, I ventured to suggest. " Now that comes of your honour's not knowing nothing of the country," he rejoined, for d'ye mind, all the rogue's friends were thieves, and if it had been any of them, they'd not only carry off the body, but would have stole the gibbet for fire-wood, which a land crab )xa no manner of use for This certainly was unanswerable, and I forbore asking any further questions on that subject.
