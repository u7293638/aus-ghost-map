THE GHOST OF GRIMLY. THE.lkeon cold wind which howled so dismally outside Mr. Thornby's mansion but served to enhance the charms of his .. bright warm. drawing-room within. There around a cheorfiil fire a happy group woro gathorod. Soft lamplight never foll on six more interesting samples of the "human face divine" than wore theoro mot. It was a kind of gala night with the family, for Harry, the second son, had just whirled down from the city with a collego chum, Charloes Beortram, to enjoy his vacation at homo. He and his friend woro the lions of the evening. Both had passed a brilliant term; and while the parents listened de lightedly to Harry's amusing accounts of his various exploits, real and imaginary, Mabel, their only daughter, was equally proud of and anxious to draw out the con versational talents of her brother's friend. If there is any truth in oyoology, Charlio and Mabol's glances revoaled to each other a secret as yet unsuspected by all but one of the little circle, and that one was nMrs. Thornby. Percy, the youngest, a pale delicate youth of fifteen, was another of the admiring auditors. " If Tom were only hero," half sigheod Mrs. Thornby, "our party would be cornm plto." . " Never mind, dear," responded her hus band, "he will be with us by-and-by, when he has soon all tile wonders abroad." "Tom's a lucky dog," said hIarry, "roving over the world sight-seeing and enjoying himself while I'm poring over dry books, listening to prosy lectures, and spend teg hours in dissecting- rooms." "Is that your description of the noble Esoulapian science ? ' laughed Charlie. "But I say, oll boy, what's our hill-of-fun for to-morrow ?" " What do yos say to a turn at angling ait Willow River for a change? The trout are in prime season," answered Harry. "Take care to be back before night," in terrupted Percy. "Why?" returned the other, con temptuously. "What school-girl nonsense is this? Wo'ro not frightened at the dark if you are." "Don't scoff too soon," retorted Percy. "' Nor laugh at scars till thou Ihsst felt a wound,' " put in the mother, looking ten derly at the Benjamin of her flocir. "Well, then, hear the story," suggested the father; "for although I'm no believer in supernatural visitations, I am convinced that the apparition which so scared Percy was not an hallucination but a reality, and one which ihas made an indelible impression on his mind. But give your own account of it, my boy, in your own way." Mabel half-unconsciously nestled close to Charlie's protecting side whilst her brother in a low earnest tone thus began his recital : "The last time I went fishing my after noon's sport had boon unusually good. So I lingersd on till nightfall at the river side. Then shouldering my rod and tacleo, I took my basket, well laden with the fruits of my prowess, and turned homewards, whistling "- -? Vhe while. You all know that the ..t BO'f Pirits distulrDOs not the even tenor of my tho.ughts. The moon rose gloriously, shodding a silvery light over white monuments and gently- waving yew trees and cypresess. The family vault of the Mordants stands in the centre of the ground, and on it my gaze was steadfastly fixed. I became sad as I mused on my young friend whose lifeless form we had so recently followed to that its last resting-place. Suddenly, to my horror and astonishment, I perceived rising out of the shadow of the marble a figure, tall and robed as if in white. A old shiver ran through my veins as the form glided in my direction. The wall which separated us was no barrier to its progress, for in less time than it takes to relate he, she, or it was at my side. "'Who are you, and what do you want ?' " I demanded. "My reply, if such it may be called, was a low, piteous moan. My kunees trembled as I turned to look at the miserable spirit, for such I felt certain it was, and found that it was clothed in the grim habiliments of the grave. The winding-shoot fell over the feet and trailed the ground. The face was covered with wrapping, completely conceal ing all but the eyes and nose. The former were large, black, and turned on me a deeply mournful expression. My head swam, my legs almost refused my support. However, I made a desperate effort to throw off fear and marched on as quickly as.possible. Still my persecutor kept at my side, uttering a low piteous moan, and using all the har rowing gesticulation of silent despair. More dead than alive, I reached at length our threshold; and with my remaining strength I pulled the bell and then fell in a fit upon the step. . "This spectre, we iear, still haunts this neightbourhiood, and makes a practice of joining itself to all solitary pedestrians in their nocturnal rambles on business oxpedi tions." "I'm blest if this spiteful ghost shall do me out of my excursion," oxclaimed IIarry, at the conclusion of the tale. "No! indeed," rejoined Charlio; "it would be a charming piece of knight mo dern-orrantry to track this villain to his lurking-place, and then bolabour his beck with a good stick." "Thon you don't think it is a spirit," murmured Mabel. "No, dearest; and if I prove to you my conjeotures are truths, what recompense will you reward me ?" of All that such a deed of chivalry demands â€¢of a lady fair," she roturned playfully. After more animated discussion it wa.s agrebd that the students should on the morrow conttrivo a plot, whereby the mid night wanderer might be circumvented and punished. Thus they parted for the night, earlC to his or her couch to dream-the parents of a sunny future for their children ; aIlrry of a grand tournament, in which the osird in habitants of ghoatlard were thie principal nators; Churliu of Mabel; and Mabel of orange-blossonie, bridu-cako, and merry bols?, whilst all thcet captivatlng visiOns in turn weore the visirtaorJ of I'orcyy' Ipilluw.

This was all speedily and satisfactorily arranged; and at ton o'clock the next evening the two sal lied forth on their heoroic mission. As on the former occasion thlo moon just rose as they neared the grave-yard; and by degrees in her brightening beams forming dim out lines and uncertain shadows all the mourn ful insignia of the sacred spot became dis tinctly visible. All naturo soomoed ushed in one of lher profoundost slumbers, the air so still that the footfall of the young men sounded like the tramp of a distant army. In spite of their hilih resolve and vaunted bravery, Harry and Charlio felt their spirits sink to zoro as they scaled theo damp wall of the burial ground. "Charlie," whispered Harry, "you have the ]key ? " " Yes," was the brief response. After lighting the dark lantern, they noiselessly descended the stops. Below it was chilly, darki, and damp; the atmos phere heavy and redolent of deathly earth. The coflins ranged around and one on the top of the other wore in different stages of preservation. The velvet cover and bright ornamentation of that of some great grandeire was now sadly impaired and dimmed by ago. In an obscuro corner there was a tiny infant's in its gay mocking trappings still fresh and bright ; whilst right opposite the intruders wae the yet untarn isled coffin of the recently-entombed Helen, who was supposed, at the return of each midnight hour, to break from her narrow confines to startle her qluandom friends and companions. "Lot's go over close and make a minute examination," said Harry under his breath, pointing in the direction of poor IHolen's corpse. "'eV'ro near enough to watch all that passes," replied Charlie in the same tone. For some time neither spoeto, their heavy respiration and palpitating hearts being the only signs of each other's presence. Every instant the air became more stifling and tile nerves of the adventurers more highly wrought. "This is awfeel," muttered Charlio, his brain reeling and a tinelking sound rushing to his ears. "It will be a fine ending to my boasted gallantry if I faint; and per hlaps she, my Mabel, will laugh at me." Ho groaned in agony mentally and physi cally at the bare idea. "Was that you, Charlie?" demanded Harry impatiently. " Yes, only me; it's getting so oppressive down here." "Well, then, you'd better mount and keep guard aloft; for perhaps the spirit is lurking above." M[ost thanltfully Charlis obeyed the order. Harry resumed his place and fixed his eyes steadily on Helen's niche. At length tIe old church clock numbered out thle twelve strokes; and to Harry's horror thle lid of leer coffin was slowly and carefully lifted, and the figure so vividly described by Percy rose up deliberately and composedly ar ranged its shroud about it. For a moment this sight deprived Harry completely of his presence of mind; and as tihe cold drops stood on his brow and each ghost hvaa .d..lm ost stood on end, the past him, and would have eluded detection had not Harry made a desperate effort to recover himself and shout to Charlie to look out. "Now for it," he vociferated, and was in a trico at his friend's side, and the hide-and seek game commenced in earnest. For some time the phantom had the best of it. It was quite evident that it was well acquainted with all the ins and outs and secret hiding-places of the cemetery. Two against one are however strong odds, and the shade of the departed Helen seeing its pursuers so resolute, became desperate and resolved if possible to jump the wall. It rushed madly and wildly towards the wall, but almost feared to chance getting over, lest it would lose time and be overtaken in the act and captured. The ghost-hunters were now more than ever persuaded they were not following a spectre, but some pitiful but hardened member of the human race. "I have you at last, you wretch," cried Harry, clutching at the grim habiliments of the enemy. "W Vho and what are you ? speak, or I'll pummel you to powder." Further attempt at disguise or flight being quite useless, in an abject voice it sued for mercy. It entreated the captors to take hands off, and promised a full con fession. "Get on then, you raca, they com manded, releasing him. " I'm Bill Daredire," said the miscreant, divesting himself of his ghastly attire and displaying thle slight figure of a young man. "I only intended to have a jolly larir by scaling tho folks rou~nd about.
