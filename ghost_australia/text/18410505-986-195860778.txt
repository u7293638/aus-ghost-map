? MASTER HUMPHREY'S CLOCK. PERSONAL ADVENTURES OF MAiTER HUMPHREY. THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP—CHAP, XIV. As it was very easy for Kit to persuade himself that the uld house was in his way, his way being anywhere, he tried to look upon his passing it once more as a matter of imperative and disagreeable necessity, quite apart from any desire of his own, to which he could not choose but yield. It is not uncommon for people who are much better fed and taught than Christopher Nubbles had ever been, to make duties of their' inclinations in matters of more doubtful propriety, and to take great credit for the self-denial with which they gratify themselves. There was no need of any caution this time, and no fear of being detained by having to play out a return match with Daniel Quflp's boy The place was entirely deserted, and looked as dusty and dingy as if it had been so for months. A rusty padlock was fastened on the door, ends of discolored blinds and curtains flapped drearily against the half-opened upper windows, arid tbe crooked hples cut in the closed shutters below were black with the darkness of the inside. Some of the glass in the window he had so often watched had been broken in the Tough hurry of the morning, and that room looked more deserted and dull than anj'. A group of idle urchins had taken possession of the door steps : some were plying the knocker, and listening with delighted dread to the hollow sounds it spread through the, dismantled house:, others were' clustered about the keyhole, watching, halfin jest and half in earnest for " the .ghost," which. an * hour's gloom, added, to. the myxtery that hung 'about the late inhabitants, .had .already, raised. Standing all alone in the midst of the business and bustle of the street, tlie fanuse^ooked a Jpicture of cold desolation ; and' Kit, • who remembered the .cheerful jire that - used tov.&ufqgji; there on \i winter's night, and tli^nc less' cheerful laugh that-made ^the^smaU .rfpm ring, turned quite" mournfully away. ; It.'must be. specially observed, in justice to poor.Kit, that he was by no means,of a sentimental turn, and perhaps had never heard that adjective in all his life.; Ho was pnly a sbjEthearted grateful fellow," and had nothing genteel pr polite aboiit .him; CQnsMuently, instead of g ing home again in his grief to'kick tbe children and abuse his mother (for when your finely strung pecrple are out of sorts they must have every body else/unHapjjy likewise), he turned his thoughts to the vulgar expedient of making them more comfort^le'jf^e.could. Bless us, what a uutaber of gentl^men on horseback there were riding ap and^oVrn, ^uid how few of them wanted ibeir horses li^td! A good city speculator or a parliamentary commissioner could "have tbld , .to ^ !fraeti6n f from the crowds that were cantering about, what sum of money was realised.ip 'Londpn in the course of a year by. holding...hprgep alone; and undoubtedly it would have .been a'very large one, if only a twentieth pirt of 4he gentlemen without grooms had iiad occasian to alight • but they hadn't ; and it k7often an ill-natured circumstance likejihis, which spoUs the most ingenious estimate in the world. Kit walked about, now wtfh "qiuck steps and now with slow; now lingering -as some, rider slackened his horse's pace and looked ahout him ; and noVdarting ajt full speed up a bye. street as he eattghf a glimpse of some distant" horseman going, lazily'op the shady side "of the road, and promising to stop at every door. But on they all went, <?ne after another, and there was not a penny stirring.. "I wonder," thought the boy, " if one of these, gentlemen knew there, was nothing in the "cupboard at home, whether he'd stop on purpose, and make believe that he wanted to call somewhere, that I might earn a trifle ?" He was quite tired out with pacing the streets, to say nothing of repeated disappointments, and was sitting down upon " a step to rest, when there approached .towards him a little chattering, jingling, four-wheeled chaise, drawn by a little obstinate looking roughcoated pony, and driven by a little fat placid faced old gentleman. Beside the little old gentleman sat a little old lady, plump and placid like himself, and the pony was coming along at his own pace and doing exactly as be pleased with the old concern* If "the old gentleman remonstrated-}>y shaking the reins, the pony re; lied by shaking" his head. __It was plain tbat the utmost the pony would consent to do, was to go in his own way up a$y street that the old gentleman particularly wished to traverse, but tbat it was an understanding between them that he must do this after his own fashion or riot at all. As they passed where he sat, Kit looked so wistfully at the little turn-out that'the old gentleman looked at him,, and Kit rising and putting his hand to his hat, the old gentleman intimated to the pony that he wished to stop, to which proposal the pony, (who seldom objected to that part of his duty) graciously acceded. "I beg your pardon, sir," said Kit. " I'm sorry you stopped, sir. I only meant, didyou want your horse minded.'' " I'm going to ge down in the jiext street,*' returned.the old gentleman. "If you like to couie on .after us, you may have, the job," Kit thanked him, The pony ran off at a sharp angle t<3 ipspect a lamp post on the opposite side qf lfche way, and then went off at a tangent to another lakhppost on the other side. Having satisfied him,<self that they were of the. samc pattern anjl materials, he came to a stop, . apparehtly absorbed in meditation ,.- ; [ ' " Will you go on, sir," said the old gentieman gravely,'' or are we to -ijait ibere for yob till it's too late for our appointment." j The pony remained immoveable. • " Ob you naugliiy Whisker," said the old lady. - '" Fit upon you; I am ashamed of such conduct." .. . . I The pony appeared to be touched by this appeal to his feelings, for he trotted on djrectly, though in a sulky manner, aha stoppedno more until he eame to 'a door .whereon was a brass plate, with the words^—" Witherden, Notary." Heie the old gentleman got out and helped out the old lady, "and then took from under tbe seat a nosegay resembling in shape and dimensions a full-sized warming pan with the handle cut short off. This the old lady carried into the house with a stately air, jknd the old gentleman (who had a club foot) followed close upon her. • . They wen t, as i t. w as easy to fell" frptn" the sound of their voices, Into the front parlour, which seemed to be a kind oF ciffice. The day being very warm, and the street a-quiet one, the windows were wide open, and it" was easy to hear through the Tepetisn blinds all "that passed inside. . . At firtt there was a great shaking of hands and shuffling of feet, succeeded by the presentation of th^ nosfc^y f " for;.a voice, .supposed by the listener to be that " of Mr Witherden, the notary, was heard to" exclaim a great many times, "oh, delicioiis loh.fragi-anf indeedl'' and a nose, also supposed to be the property of thai -gentleman, was heard to in|hale- tfce scent with a smrfSe of exceeding pleasure. ; , " I broughtit in honor'of the occasion, sir,'* said the:old lady. • " „„ .. .... •* Ah ! an occasion; indeed, ma'am; an occasion which does honor to me," rejoined Mr Witherden, the notary. " .1 ^ave had many a gentleman a", tided to me, ma'am, m&ny; a one. Some ot tliem are flow roIling m- iicheB unmindful of their old companion and frTendj ma'am ; others are in ;the habit 9foalliiig ; upon me to this day, and saying—-' Mr Witheolen, si-me of the pleasante^t hours I cver spent in my life were spent in this offioe--were spent, sir, upon this very stool;' but there was never" one nmong 1 have been to many of them,-of whnro, I augured such bright things as I do of your only sop."; " Oh dear!." said aie^pld 3adj.; ."
