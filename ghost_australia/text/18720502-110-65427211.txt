RITUALISM INiTASMANtA L. " .p Fresh alarm appears to have been ti caused amongst the laity of the Church I of England in Tasmania by alleged i attempts on the part of certain members o of the clergy to introduce ritualism and other practices of the Roman Catholic ti Church ipit their ministrations. The i same clergymen are also accused, it would seem, of circulating objectionable I books, in which the doctrines of trail- t substantiation and auricular confession I are advocated. On Wednesday, 24th 1 inst., a deputatiou waited upon the s Bishop of T'asmania (tile Right Rev 0. b 11\. Bromby), at Bishop's court, I1obart .t Town, to presetnt ia memorial` of. tile; laity on the subject. Tilhe deputation u consisted of the lion Dr Crowther, b l1.L.C,, thle IIon A. Kenartley, M;L.C., It lMessrs W. ltelbin, 'M1.I.A., T. \Yest' I boiokl, J.P., C. 0. Abbott, '\\. ;tlamil- p ton, 1l. L.:' Roberts,tJ. Sly, iiid'T.Noh li n From the report " in the 1lobart Tolbai( llercury (of which the' folloiting is ali t, abridgement), the bishop seems quite f prepared to defend'his subordicntes:- f Dr, Crowther,' addressilg the bishopl , said 'they,'ias a detip itiion, had been n requested to wait on him to-present the g Iehoriall, ?olich had been sigiied by I upwards .of 800 laymen, all profesised Uembers of the .Church: of England. latny, others would, have siguned-the It memnorial had. they .been solicited, but b tht'800sigentures wero strictly those of a mombers of the church, who 'took'" 'a deep interest in ite' welfiife, ntid were a desirous that true dobctriio iitd Christian p principle should be carried out iii the diocese. I [Amongst tlhe signatures were those of tabout a dozen ' meiibers 'f ':Pi'tha. I aient.] ~t ,.,The.Bishop, after some preparatory I remarks. (in which hd spoke :in defence g o; the chplain ofi "the::Port Arihur, I penial establiehmeut, the : Rev. "lIr 'Hay ward; whose 'conducti bd' - beien' dis 'approved of),; rcada"'reply,'the principal portionus of wh'ich are as follow --" My t dear. Brethren in - Christ,-You "itate ii that you 'are led to believe ihat somet practices and' ceremodlies of a ."stipersti- i tious ' chiracter, 'and' 'coitrary 'to the 1 doctrine and usage ofthe Church of; 'E.gland, are beginnitig to take rimot in I. this diocese.' You bhse,.this. belieft upon two grounds-firt,.on the ground t that, as you allege, certain, books 'were 'shown to be in use ; and secoodljy;that I ' certain statet?euts, openly made in the' synod, were uuchallenged.": . I have ouce more to repeat thata bishop of our.t church possessesuno" power, whatever to t interdict the use of books Bhich aclergy-. masnay fin d profidtblei i,, his private I ministratiouns "A bishop's interferencec where no law of the church .has beetn broken would be properly resisted is au abitrary' exercise '' f 'irresponsible authority.' -"li "'conipliiihcce;? however, with aln xpireied 'desire of the'synod, and for the quiid'ii- of. doubts, I have al'raidy, jna' pastial letter, recommend. ed the clergy to refraii from making use of all books whatever which: cou tahined nmitter that in. essence or caistjmf tlougt wan alr l.ed" to uird' \tho honest scruples of their brethren or thelir flocks. 2. No attempt during"" the session of synod was :tiade to show that any of our clergy had used' the object= ionable portions of the books specified, although several readily tsdmitted that oite of these two books at least was in their possession and partial use.: You nust call to mind that the statements which were then made were 'so vague and uncircumstautiat as to be incapable of being ' challenged,' and ought not, therefore, ' in my judgement,' to be accepted as proof than 'iy practiece or dereindnies of a, superatitiouis character are beginning, to take "root, in.. this diocese.' Unwarrantable ; insinuations were indeed uttered "at the synod, followed by others still more persoimn and libellous, which appeared in the shape of annoymous newspaper letters.' Since these slanders, which have' beeni proved to be utterly untrue,,have not been recalled, as niwnly courage and Christian caudour dictate,:it.is not very surprising that a panic should go abroad of which this memuorial is, the natural sequel.- In conclusion, I' beg solemnly to assure you that you Ceaunot dislike! superstitious, as opposed to r eailly reveient, practices in Divine, worship more than I d; you may rely upo:: it that I shall be, at all times, ready 'to use the authority which' belotig's ti' by office for the removal of'all 'reasonable grounds of alarm, whether i' ono direc tion or another, Whenever real occasion may arise. But I can iever consent to abridge that measure of toleration, which, in these days of freer thought aid larger liberty,.is allowed to indi. vidual clergymei nld their, congrega tionts in the muothcrihurch 'from which I received mny niasioln us your 'bishop. This principle of cinistitutional freedom, which attaches the Church of England to my own heart, ind which formusomie of the truest links between iheo 'inoiher and the daughlter chilrpmeu,,hhs e'ver beeii itid 'will contiiue to ,.be the principlle that will ever guideeme in.the administrations of the diocese.' A disrcussiotu followed the' irediig of the reply. ''' Dr Crowther rose to. support the memorial Olt behalf of the deputation the pIersonsu who had signed it; atnd he could not aillow it to piss a'without giv'' ig exlpru3ssiqn to his own ll opiion of that which was stated by. the inemorihl itts that improper books were used, aid that they were kld to beholve that some practices atid cerenlonies of a 'upersti. tious character, tand countrary to' t?e doctrie' and usage of the Churci of Englhnd, were beginning ti.titke routtin the diocese, ansdl of rlwhich, lhe' ais sorry to say, his lordship was not swmaro. Ieu (Dr Crawther) was sorry to, inform hit iordship that the alartl hiid It't boeli lesseued by the issue of his pastoral Ote time eontrary, he, fit one, felt that it had beet strenigtlheted by the clergy beiig told thqt they were 'left to free dom of acti,)nt!'

'Frot the fact of his beintg here it was by mantry presumed thati he was the prime.,mover, instigator,: and tutor in these - objectionable practices. That there was such an individual here, who was notorious for ritualistic practices at home, was :ntdconsistent with tho posi tion thley., toobik?,in ithe? diocese :and he (Mir Kreiterley) believed- the laity of the:.Church of 'England in- all these colonies professed to ands would adhere to the determination to banish from the Church' all ;tliose' 'ritualistic practices which did such 'damage to the Church in the mother country, ' The Bish l remarked that. he did not kri oithat he could add. to whathe had already: stated .-'The difficulty he, as bishop; felt wai? li'fiar he Was justified in iuterferitig wig'li a'clergian who was coi?plaiuedeof. .. If hee(the bishop) took the 28th article of the church, it said,r " 'The Body :of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after all iL-avently' and spiritual inmanner." Th6i' clergyman referred to had constantly, in his hearing, said that the presence of t Christ in the Saieraitmeit was only in a spiritual senrse, and as far as he (the bishop) knew, he had never seen any tithing that could be interpreted as t opposed to the tenonts of the Church of t England. Then it had been said in the synod by Mr "Barnard that -improper questions had been put` by a'clergyman to a young woman;. but when the state meit catiie .tb be sifted'it was not sub. stantiated, ;and lhe (the bishop) blamed r MrBarnard for not coming forward and sayifig he was'mistaken, arid that he had t made a stateinent that wias without 5 foundiation. ir Kenneoriley.-That statement I had foundation.

As to the confessional, it was not improper,. iodil was in accordance with what be hall quoted from the Prayer- book, Dr Crowther said that wtattbeyobjet ted to nns, among other things, the manner and mode of tie confessional.

The Bishop said from all that lie could' learn Mir Haywald had only ciiculatedi Pilgrims Progress andt a work useil. by oanection of his (the bishop's) predecessor, Steps to the Altar.
