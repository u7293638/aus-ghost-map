Song. Dedicated with all possible respect to H. K., in unspeakable admira- tion of his inexpressibly beautiful verses in Tuesday's Empire.—"Sit- ting by the Fire." Ah, the solace in the strumming, Strumming on your lyre, When without the fish boys calling, Fish O! Fish O! loudly bawling, Mingle with your own sweet humming, Like a country choir— Ah! the solace in the strumming, Strumming on your lyre. Then and then no doubt you ponder, Strumming on your lyre, Over fair fat cheeks, and faces Shining in "dim tracts" and "spaces," Over yonder, where to wander You a donkey hire— Thus and thus no doubt you ponder, Strumming on your lyre. Ghosts of songs, long dead, delight you, Strumming on your lyre, On one note, inanely pretty, Still you sing each childish ditty, Does no vision come to fright you, Foolscap's wasted quire? Still must senseless songs delight you, Strumming on your lyre? Song by song,—the old old jingle,— Strumming on your lyre,— Ne'er a wreath your songs will weave you, When will this fool's fancy leave you, Like your brothers, bosh to mingle With the rhymes that tire? Song by song, the same old jingle, Strumming on your lyre. In the green sea,—O my poet, Strumming on your lyre,— You should put your lyre to sleep now, Times are bad and rubbish cheap now,— To the fishes you should throw it, Fishes rot admire— Even in the sea, my poet, You should drown your lyre.
