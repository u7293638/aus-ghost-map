Remarkable Voyahbof the Loch Venna- ohae. — The ship Loch Vonnachar, winch loft Glasgow on April 6 last for Melbourno after an oxtraordinnry passage, at one portion of which it was only tho consummate seamanship displayed by captain and officers and tho bravery of tho whole ship's company that averted her total destruction, witli tho almost certainty of tho loss of tho greaternum- ber of the livos of the crow and passengers. The story, as told by Captain W. II. Bonnet, is that "AH went well with the Loch Ven- naehar, her crew of 33 all told, and 12 passen gers, four of whom wore ladies, until she readied lat, 39dog. DSiiiiu. S. and long. 27dog. 21 nun. E., when at 8 o'clock on tho evening of Juno 3 tho barometer began to fall ominously and sail was promptly sliortoncd. Tile wind increased during the night, until it blew with the velocity of a hurricane, and at half- past 5. o'clock in tho morning all hands were called on duck and sont forward to make fast tiie foresail, which had been furled but had blown adrift. Tho ship was head-reaching under lower topsails ami fore-tojmiast staysail only, and was taking quantities of water on board. Darkness lifted soon after 5 o'clock, and tho break of day showed the terrific head seas that swept down upon tho vessel; lashed by the north east gale. Captain Bennett, who was on tho poop, -saw tho danger of his crew, and at once resolvctl to sacrilico the sail. He sang out to the mate to send the men aft, and the hands who had Leon lying out 011 the pitching fore- yard gained tlio deck in safety and reached tho poop just 111 timo. As they did so two enormous waves bore down upon the Bhip, whicli rode slmvly over tlio first and sank to nn interminable depth in tlio trough at the other side. While ill this position tho second wave camo on, towering half- wny up tho foremast, and broke on board, filling the lower topsail, liOft. above the deck, as it came. Hundreds of tons of water swept over tho ship ill a solid mass from stem to stern, thundering inboard on the port side of tho forecastle nnd racing away ovor the mam dock and ovor the poop, where most of tho ciew were standing. Every man on the poop was thrown down, and when they regained their feet they perceived that tho foremast and mainmast wore over the side, and the mizzen-topmast above their heads had disappeared. Not a man on board notually saw the spars go, or even heard the crash of the breaking rigging, so violent was tho shock and so fierce the howiing of tlio hurienne. There was one lamentable fatality, and tho escapes of many of the crew were marvellous. The cook's galloy was in tho deckhouse, a solid structuro of steel, faced with teak, nnd bolted down with bars and angles deep in tho| waist of tho ship. Tho head -cook, William Molvin, and the second cook, Robert Stephenson,' were in the galley at tho time, with the heavy teak doors at tlio port and sturbonrd side se curely fastened. Tlio sea burst through the door on the port side as if it had been paper, and rushed out on tho starboard side, disappearing over tlio bulwark, witli the, doors and fittings of tlio deok- house,. the pots and pans and cook ing utensils, and tho ImplosB chief cook him self, who was gone before ho had time to realise what had happened. Stephenson, tho seoond cook, had an extraordinary experience. Ho was driven against the stool wall of the galloy, and as the inrush of water, rebounding from tlio wall, sought an outlet, it swept him with it out through tho skylight at the top of the galley. _ The skylight was of glass, covored with a light metal trellis, and tlio second cool: went through it like a circus- rider through a paper hoop. Ho managed to grab something on tlio top of the house, and regained tho deck uninjured." Jury- masts wero rigged, and Mauritius was reached after an anxious passage, ocoupyinp five weeks, during the wholo of which tnno heavy weather was experienced, and rarely could the galley fiio be lighted. At_ Mauri tius Admiral Konnedy and his officers wont on hoard the Loch Vonnachar, and the Admiral warmly complimented Captain Bennett upon his skill and seamanship, making him an acceptable present at the same timo of cigars and- " medical com forts." Neat spars, supplied by Messrs Barclay, Curio nnd Co., tho well-known ship builders of tho Clyde, were brought out by the steamer Clan Macdonald, -together with new rigging, and tlio vessel received n complete refit at a cost of ovor £3000. Captain Bennett found Mauritius in a deplorable state after tlio great hurricane which occurred there in April, but was most hospitably treated both by the Govornor of the island, Sir H. Jer- ninglmm, and by Admiral Kennedy, of H.M.S. Boadicen. Tho voyngo wus resumed .on November 18, nnd comparatively fine weather was experienced to Hohson's Bay, where the vessel anchored amid the cheers of avery soul on board.
