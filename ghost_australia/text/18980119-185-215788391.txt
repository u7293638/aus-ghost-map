THEATRICAL QUARREL. The District Court magistrates were asked to-day to settle a little trouble connected with the non-payment of theatrical salaries. The principal actors were Martyn and Lucy Hogan and Abraham Green. The two former sought to reoover £ll 6s 8d for the balance of salary due. They were -engaged to play in the pantomime at the Bijou Theatre, but “ the ghost failed to walk ” after the first week, and hence the trouble. As, however, it appeared that the plaintiffs’ engagement wae with a Misß Juneen, and not with Green, the bench dismissed the case. Green had assisted Miss Jnneen to pay her salaries, taking a mortgage over the theatre. The plaintiff ad mitted that the contract was made with Miss Juneeo, but they looked on it as rescinded, and Green said that he was going to take over the show. The defendant, howevar, Baid that he was not a partner with Miss Juneen, and did not share the profits. -
