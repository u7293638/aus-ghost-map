Little Gray Ghosts. A big farmhouse in New Jersey long stood tenantless, and had the reputation of being haunted. At last a young farmer and his wife moved in at a merely nominal rental. An unearthly clattering on the stairs frightened the coaple half out ol their wits the first night, and the wife tried to persaade her consort to get up and investigate. For an hour he argued desperately with her on the advisability of Iyirg still. She declared that if he wouldn't investigate she must die or get ug. Jierself. Finally they effected a coinpromioe by creepiDg out of bed together. They lit the lamp and looked cauficuBly oat of the chamber door. The first glance solved the mystery. Big gray Fquirrels literally ewarmed up all the landing?, and every one of them has a big nut of some kind between his pawa. The main supply of nuts was stored in an unused garret, where some tenant bad placed them long ago. The squirrels arranged themselves in gangs on each landing, and those at the top of the house carried the nuts one by one out of the garret and sent them rolling dowaihe stairs to the next landing, where thej were met by the gang waiting for them, land pushed down another flight. In this way they reached an :ld cellar, which was evi dently the tquirrels' storeroom, lor it was well stocked with nuts. They were moving â€”from attic to basement.
