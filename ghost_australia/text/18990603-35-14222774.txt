CUBREN T LITERATURE. 1 SOuLE NEW STORIES. " No '3 John street," by Richard Whiteing (Grant Richards's Colonial Library), is one of the most interesting stones that one has come across for a longtime The hero is appointed Agent General for some island in the Pacific Ocean, and he is directly authorised to report voluminously to his Government on the Jubilee and on the general state of aftmT in Great Britain Our Agent General's authority is good, his pay within the limits of a pound sterling by consignment in the inland currency of yams is distinctly good But he has his troubles One is to persuade the Colonial Office that there is such an island as that whose accredited ambassador he is and hero much pleasing criticiHtn pops in It H SO good humoured and so pleasant that the mistress of Colonial Secretaries and Mr. Chamberlain never was noted for crustiness-must laugh at it Anyhow, our hero ImB to write a full and true report about things to this imaginary potentate in n yet undiscovered island, and, to do his subject justice, he goes into the heart of the East of London and says plainly and clearly what he sees there. It is not a beautiful picture Ko East End is beautiful Our hero finds his " No 6 John street " full of battle, and murder, and sudden death He finds it full, too, of men and women who want to work, and who can- not by any means get work to do Full, too, of mischievous agitators and of brawling rowdies others ready, any one of them, to respond to the touch of higher things, and to stand manfully by their weaker brethren And, as a contrast to all this, Mr Whvtemg gives us a picture of a modern "swell" This gentle- man who is drawn exquisitely-is the son of his father, who was a nobody, but who since his appearance on the earth in that capacity has accumulated millions The millionaire father gives his son a trifle of £7000 a year to play to 4th for current expenses, with instructions to call on the paternal safe ty when occasion demands The son of rest is stakeD On the one she a poor to reach thousands of poor wretches fighting for as much work as will enable them to buy food. On the other a pampered plutocrat-not an aristocrat, for Sir Marmaduke Kiddle, the father of the £7000 a year person, is himself of low hirth-the pampered plutocrat does not know how to spend his money A very striking book this " A Duet, with on Occasional Chorus " (Grant Richards), will come as a considerable surprise to the many admirers of Dr Conan Doyle's work Our author has accustomed readers to look for some unexpected denouement, for some clever coup de main which completely revolutionises expecta- tion, oud makes those who came to examine remain to wonder Bat this "Duet " is of quite a different order It is the story of the lives of two prosaic young persons, who had the usual ups and downs Dr Do> It is much beholden to Itudyaitl Iuphngfoi the humour of the wedding scene and for the pathos such as there is, of the description of the pen pal of the customary baby Mr Sherlock Holmes is happily dead by now, but glories of what his ghost is doing along the banks of the Styx would be more enjoyable than this book-half guide to London, half extracts from the uninteresting diary of a decidedly uninterest- ing pair 9' The Capsma," by E T Benson (Methuen's Colonial Library), is a story of the Greek revolt against Turkey the revolt in which Byron lost his life The Cups in is the female head of a can on one of the Aegean Islands, and instead of settling down quietly to the routine work of getting married and bearing children, IIB devotes herself to martial work She has a particular aptitude for naval con . struction, and she has such a healthy hatred of Turkey that the recitation of her exploits in the matter of telling them reads rod Mr Benson gained his reputation as a writer of stones by his " Dodo," published whilst his father was Archbishop of Canterbury and the young man was voted " the thing " at few of the contrast between his freedom of speech and allusion and the Archbishop's reserve " The Paths of the Tudors," by T. S Fletcher (Methuen's Colonial Library), details the adventures of a young lady who has been brought up by Miss Hypatia Watts at the "Home for the upbringing of Prudent Maidens " The heroine-who rejoices in the somewhat extensive name of Dormthia Evjdno Clementine Annwell has it prophesied of her by a wandering expert in phrenology that she will cause a very great deal of mischief The guileless reader follows Dormthia through these pages in the hopeful fear that the prophesied mischief will at last turn up But Dormthia does nothing startling Four or five yokels fall in love with her, and when we take leave of her she is shortly about to become the blushing bride of the wealthy Earl of BareaoreB " For Better or Worse by Conrad Howard (T. Fisher Unwin), is dedicated by the author to the fathers and mothers of the twentieth century " Hildegard Stanhope, a wealthy young lady of some 25 summers, falls in love with and marries, her her own suggestion, one Anthony Musgrave, who is five years her junior He does not love her, but he accepts her offer and marries her because he can use her Wealth, which she freely bestow s upon him, in the furtherance of certain religious projects which he has at heart. All this in the face of the fact that there is insanity in her family This appears in due course in Hildegard, who dies in a lunatic asylum, but not until after she has borne her husband three children, of whom one commits suicide and another dies of consumption Anthony, a sincere if misguided Christian of the severest order, cannot be brought to believe that he has done wrong in marrying a woman tainted with lunacy and in bringing into the world children to inherit her awful curse His greatest trouble consists in the sturdy opposition to his gloomy tenets of his eldest daughter, the only one who survives him, and of his cousin, who becomes his second wife.
