SYDNEY HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT. SALARIES UNPAID. Salaries due to the Sydney Hospital employees during the month ended August 31, for some rea- I son or other, have not yet been paid, and in - consequence a deal of dissatisf action exists. All j the staff, from the superintendent to the junior messenger, are concerned. Since the first of the month individual applications for -wages due to rtiem haw heen made bv many of the more poorly paid among the employees, but without success so far. As the majortiy of the porters and at tendants live outside the hospital, they can but 01 afford to wait an exrta week or two for their money, and any delay in the monthly peregrin ations of the financial 'ghost' is severely felt. The money, it is understood, has been passed for payment by the house committee, but why it is . not forthcoming appears to be, as Kipling would remark, 'another story.'
