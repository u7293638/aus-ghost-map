Gvuuo us M1iminoi.--Among tho curiosities exhibited in tho last Paris exposition, anm pro ulised for ours, was i huge concnvo mirror, the instrument of a startling species of optical magic. On standing close to the mirror, and looking into it, it prosents nothing but a Inag nificantly nioustrous disseotion of your own physiognomy. On retiring a little, say a couplo of foot, it gives your own fieo ,and liguro in true proportion, but reversed, the haud downwards. Most of the spectators, ignorant of anything else, observe those two effects, and pass on. But retire still further, standing at tirhe distance of five or six feet from the mirror, anid behold, you see your self, not a reflection-it does not strike you as a reflection-but your veritable self, standing in the middle parIt between you and the mirror. The effect is aihnost appalling, from the idea it suggests of something super natural ; so startling, in fact, that men of the strongest nerves will shrink involuntarily at tihe first views. If you raise your cane to thrust at your other self, you will see it pass clean through the body and appear on the other side, the figure thrusting at you the saume instant. The artist who first succeeded in fashioiinie a mirror of this description brought it to one of the French kings --ifwe recollect aright, it was Louis X.V.-placed his nlajesty on theoright spot, anti bade him draw Iris sword and thrust at the figure he saw. The King did so ; but, seeing the point of a sword directed to his own breast, threw down his weapon and ran away. This practical joke cost the inventor the King's patronage arnd favour; his Majesty being so ashamed of his own cowardice that he could never again look in the mirror or at its owner.-Field.

FOOD FOR OxEN.--F"eI' quent observations have shown that an ox will consume two per cent. of his weight of hay per day to maintain his condition. If put to moderato labour, an increase of this quiantity to thiree per cent. will enable him to Iterfsorrm his woerk, and still maintain his flesh. If hi is to be fittoneI, lie requires about four and a-half per cent. of his weight daily in nutritious food.-Scientilie American. WrtHAT THOSE MAY n"XPI']CT WHlO TELL TiEt TlrnUTrl.-A quaint writer, now almost fiorgotten, said:-" If I might give a short hint to tin impartial writer it would be to tell his fate. If he be resolved to venture upon the dangerous precipice of telling unbiassed truth, let him proclaim war with mannird-' neither to give nor takoe qartor. If' lie tells the crimes of the great men, they fall upon him with the iron hands of the law. If he tells' them of virtues when they have any, then the mob attacks them with slander, Buit if he regards truth, let him expect martyrdom on both sides, and then he may go on fearless; and this is the course I take to myself." ON TIIE ADULTIRATION OF SEDnns is the title of a little work recently published in .England being i relprint of a prize essay whliclh appeared in vol. 22, uart I., of the journal of the Royal Agricultural Society. l'he oiejoct was to expose the system of ridril terasting seeds, which, unfortunately, is carried on to a very great extent. The author corn nonces by putting forward two important truths, which ought to act as a general guide s to all flrmers. The one is, that goods offered below tire current market price must, as a rule, be either of inferior stook, dlamaged, or adulterated, and that of coarse it is unwseise a for a 'grower to buy such seeds, as the penny gaineds in price must be a pound lost in the crop. It is lamnentable to think hows syste- I matically the adulteration is carried on. WVith clover, old seeds are brushed and t rubbed up by machinery, and some colouring I matter applied to give i puriple hlie Whiteo clover is coloured to resembrlo alsike. Old trofoil undergoes the sulphurous bleaching and brushing process. Foreign clover is full of parasite seeds. Rye-grass is mixed with heated and badly-conditioned seed. With sainfoin are usually found the spurious seeds of common brome-grass and, burnet. Turnip andt rape, and all seeds from which oil may be extracted, keep their vitality for a numbe?r of years; but they are adulterated with dead seeds, and dressed up with vegetable oil; anti mangold also undergoes the same process. Besides all these various dishonest practices, which must be carried out evidently on a wholesalo scale from the use of marchinery, the seed is liable to careless and accidental adulteration, and, as a rule, foreign seed is more tampered with than homne-grown. Here is a catalogue of evils suflieiently appalling. The tarmoer's only hope is in the respecta bility and character of the seeodsman; and fortunately, in this country, thern are r many. to be relied upon. The grand rule, however, is to avoid all merely cheap articles.---Theo Fitold. CaRnoTs. AND PoTATOES.--Wo weare a few days ago shawn carrots weighing eight pounds each, and silver-shin potatoes of a good ordinary size; the latter being the produce of .seed planted tchree months ago. Both were grown at East Brighton, where the soil is very sandy, and nattrally very poor', but-capable of producing anything if well manrretl. We understard that these pro duots represent the fourth crop talkeon from the same land within a twelvemonth. If we suppose thaSt each carrot required two square feet of ground, such a crop, on one acre, wouli amount to eighty-seven tons. As carrots, for stock-feeding purposes, are wosrth at least two or threeoo pounds per ton, our fitrmors and gardeners may linoerv what is the value of even sandy soil when plenty of manuroe is applietl.-Yaeoman. ])mnNKING USAIes ASMONO TIlE SOUTII rnN?ns.--A Neow York paper gives the following description of Southern drinidng: Among oommunities of heavy drinkers stricture of the whisky barrel is a very for midable disorder. In the Southorn States all the occupations of lifo, trivial or momentous, are I'prefaced with a "'T'om and Jerry," and concluded with a "tickleo my eye."

The man who draws the first prize in a lottery solemnly drinks the health of the man who Shas spent his last shilling and drawn a blank. It is to this improving and beneficent custom that we are indebted, in good part, for the I hmane social code which prevails at the ssouth.

STORY 03' A CIINEI?Sr SWINDLEIt.--At one I of the consular ports, a class of men, called in the local dialect Kuong Kong, " bare stick," who get their living by their wits, obtaining money ntnd property by falseo pretences, are very numerous and very clover. A goodi story is told of a swindler of this class, who had miade up his mind to obtain some silks or satin from a certain shop in the south street of tile city. lie approached ian old woman whom lie found in the streets, and saluted her as his aunt, expressing great i Joy at seeing her again after so many years. Ife wondered what had been her fortune since t he had lost sight of her a long while ago, I exhibited great sorrow to Fee her in her t present condition, rand invited her to go homeo with him, whoro lie would provide for her. The hug knew that she was not his aunt; but, I thinking that I)her fortune would be bettered, and perceiving that he was a well-dressed I gentlemanly lookling man, at once accepted t his offer, calling hitm her nephew, and seem- s ing very glad to see him once more. So she l threw away her beggar's staff, bag, andt bowl, and entered the sedan which her e "naelphew" called, and they started oiff.l .Thay soon stopped before an umbrella shop, while her nephew selected an umbrella, on the haadle of which he had his (professed) name I neatly carved. As he said lie happened to f have nothing but largo bills with him, the Â¶ shopkeeper could do no better than send a boy along with the gentleman up the street for s the chLange, for the man's name was carved on the handle, rendering' it an unsaleable o article. Thus the lad, tho sedan with the I beggar woman, and the swindler, passed on together on the street till they came to the silk and satin shop. Th obearers of theo sedan r and the umbrella lad were ordered to wait at I the door, while the other went in to purchase some goods. 1He selected two pieces, and after the prices were fixed, requested permis- I sion to take them away for a moment to con sult with a fi'iend about them. The shop keeper, recollecting that his servant (as they took the lad to lie) and sedan with a lady in- a side, were waiting at the door, at once con sented, and lie took off the silk and satin, pro- p mising to be back promptly. After a while the shopkeeper began to feel uneasy in regard to li the result, and at length spoke to the lad at the door about his " master." The p latter said he was not his master, but had bought an umbrella at his master's shop, and had requested him to accompany 1 him home for the pay. This account did not dissipato the shopkteeper's suspicions, but lie t remembered that the sedan was still at his t door, and the gentleman would surely be c hack for the lady. After waiting a long i time, he ventured to break through the rules t of politeness, impatiently lifted up the curtain - or screen of the sedan, and of course saw nothing but an old beggar woman inside. On being questionoed, she told her story in ] great anger. The plot was exploded, but too late. The fellow was nowhere to le found. Thel shopkeeper lost his rich goods, the boy went home without pay for the umbrella, and the sedan-bearers were cheated out of their hire for carrying the rogueo's "aunt; " butt above all, the beggar-woman mourned the loss of her staff, bag, and bowl. A GuosT riao't PunaA'ronY.--A Lime rick pritest recently suggested the followingi practical method of answering an appeal from purgatory by a ghost:--" A woman in the county Limericc, not fin' from Emily, buried lher husband a few months ago. A knock came to the dloor some night last month. She asked who was there. A hollow voice, answered 'I am your husband, whoa you buried, and I am very miserable in purgatory till my debts are paid. Sell tie two pigs you have, and he sure to have the money for me on such a night when I call.' The poor woman dlid as lie required, and'felt happy at being able to mieot hiis request, whether throuigh fear or love (as he appnared with his sLroudi and pale thece). Between the first and second visit of the ghost, the poor woman went and told her story to the priest; heI told lher it was all very good6 , but at the same time to have two policemen in the house when she would hbe giving the money. Accordingly, after getting the money, the purgiitorial and shrouded ghost came, and was arrested by the police and lodgedt in Limeriok gaol, thttro to untldergo a little more purgatory till his trial comes on. This ghiost turns out to be a neighbotr, who is godfather to one of her chiltren." A Sc0sn IN COUaT..'-WO have daily some odd scene or the other ii our police-courts.

It appears that a lady of high distinction, who " has the reputation of making the most elegant curtsey in Europe after the Queen Victoria, " excited the risible faculties of one of the most aristocratic assemblies, by offering a most gracious specimen of her talent to the white-necked butler, whom she mistook for the master of the house.

"Jer-ru-sa-lem ! what a wish," replied Jonathan, " when you're handsome 'nuff neow. But I'll tell you what I wish, Sally ; I wish you was locked in my arms, and the key was lost."

When tie husband had eaten eleven, with the ex ception of half a one, his little son, a lad of six sumnners, came up to him and said, " Daddy, give me a little piece."
