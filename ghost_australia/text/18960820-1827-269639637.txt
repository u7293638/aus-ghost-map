THE SINGULAR EXPERIENCE OF DOCTOR -MACBETH. [copyright ") PyWskedtyfecialatfatigemeinl with Messrs. GaxscU wid- Go;,; :Lvmited, •Piiblislua-X • London and Melbourne. '" 1 ' By JOHN H LEYS, Author of " The Lindsays," etc. -, Before narrating: what .happened . to •:. myself, it will be convenient to lay before the reader a statement which 1 received, from the Rev: Father Usher: I wrote to him, in circumstances which • will presently appear, and 111 reply J. ! received a letter euclosing this st-ate- • merit. I have only to add that Father -Usher is a priest well known and highly respected- among - the membersof his communion. .v.-: ..v .-.-:•• THE STATEMENT ABOVE • RE- FERRED TO It was after twelve months' hard" work in. an East London parish- that I resolved lo take a short holiday, and par a visit to the shrine of our Lady •at X.OUI;de--;. J>ad "i-o •through Paris,, and ,-I set aside a day or two for the-purpose: of visiting some of the principal sights of the city. I was standing alone in the open -space in front of Ndi-re Dame when a. roice said m my ear— " Monsieur is a priest 1" I turned and saw a short, slim, darkhaired nian, with neatly trimmed beard and moustache. " I am," was my answer. "And a stranger in Paris, I think." " A complete stranger," I said, with a smile. " Will monsieur come to give the last sacrament to one at the point of death V was the next question. " You had better ask one of the clergy resident here," I replied, pointing to the church. " I am a stranger; and I have no faculty to hear confessions in the diocese. "But the man is dying," returned 1 the stranger. " I thought every priest had power to hear the confessions of the dying." " True. But why not apply to one of the local clergy 1" " Because the man is of your country; and he naturally prefers a priest of his own nation." " That is a different matter," said I. " Wait here til] I go to the sacristy for the holy oils. I will be with you immediately." I procured what was necessary, and returned to the spot. The man was fltill there. "There is one thing I must mention," said my guide, as we walked: away together. "You must know that there are places in Paris where strangers are . -not'-allowed, to come. The man you. are about to visit is to lie iound in one ol these bouses. 1 dare not take you to him unless ynu solemnly promise me not to attempt to discover the direction we take or the house we visit." . I hesitated. I was putting myself completely in this stranger's power. But it was impossible to allow a Roman Catholic to die unsliriven if 1' could help it. " I consent," I said, after a moment's reflection. The man at my side lifted his band, and a carriage, which had evidently been waiting, drew up to the pavement. "When we entered it I noticed that the blinds were not only drawn, but carefully fitted to the- windowsashes, so that, to all intents and purposes, the outside world was as thoroughly concealed from me as if I had been earned m a box. For a long time—for nearly an hour I should' say—we drove about the streets of Pans. By that time I had not the faintest Idea even of the quarter of the city, "which wc were m At last the carriage turned sharply into a. courtyard, and stopped. " Monsieur . will please close lus eyes," said my guide, in a totally I different-tone from that which he had formerly used. • •.; .-••-.•,v.-'- I obeyed, and was half-led, halfpushed in at a doorway. Once in the house, .1; was - alio wed to open my eyes, and "found myself in n narrow, ill-lighted, ill-smelling passage No one was visible. We mounted several Hights of: stairs, and at length reachedadoorjWhiclimyguideopeued "In half an hour 1 will come for you," lie said, as he showed me my Then lie shut and locked the door behind me. The room was a small one, poorly furnished, lighted by gas only. I looked around. A tap), handsome young man, about five- arid - twenty years of, age, stood leaning against the mantelpiece. There was no bed, nor any sick person io be seen "lama priest/' said I, "come to give the last saciaments to-a person at the point of death.
