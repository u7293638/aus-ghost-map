Toleration. [FOR THE GAZETTH, BY T. J. HEBBLEWHITE, GOULBORN] If I deem a flashing crimson richer (bail a frigid blue, Will you brand me as a traitor iÂ£ f emmi net with you ? Some have raved o'er ebon tresses, olive skin, ib& jetty eye. Some for gold or auburn ringlets happy were to fight and die; Some declare for King or Kaiser, heart and voice in unison. Shall we quarrel rudely with ttyeia ? Shall I ? Np/, cot I, fyr one; Some as honestly for Chieftain, President, or Despot call Surely on this rolling planet there is ample room for all. Loyalty is but opinion ; what to me is sweet and strong May be treason to your feeling, bitter wormwood on your tongue; What to you is Love incarnate, pure and beautiful and free, In my altered eye may glimmer like the ghost of Tyranny. Let me sow my doctrines broadcast, how I will, and when I choose, Yours it is as man and freeman to accept them or refuse ; You in turn may air your fancies, strive to win me to your side, You may reason with my reason, you may meet my pride with pride, If you fail to shake my firmness, let us part as men, not boors, Leave me free to take my own way, you are free to travel yours. Loyalty is but opinion-Royalist, Republican, If one swear by Socialism is he any less a man ? I for an elected sovereign, you for sovereign by descent, Travel by two different pathways to the self-same goal -content. You may hold your own opinions, I hold mine whate'er befall Surely on this rolling planet there is ample room for all. Only fools and bigots punish heretics with stripes and death, All the world requires and asks for is a reason for your iaith; There is some sufficient reason both for faith and unbelief, Even savages can tell us why they reverence their chief. Loyalty is but opinion ; let them hold who hold it can, For the best of Kings anointed is no more than I -a man; Unto you he seems perfection, unto me a painted mask, If you care to worship, worship; leave me free is all I ask.
