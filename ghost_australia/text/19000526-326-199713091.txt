Left Undone. It isn't the tiling you do, dear. It's the thing you've left undone, Which gives you a bit of a heartache At the setting of the ran. The tender word forgottcn, The letter you dldnot write, The flower you might have sent, dear, Aro your haunting ghosts to-night. The atone yon might have lifted. Out of a brother's way. The bit of heartoome counsel - Yon were harried too much to say ; The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone, That yon had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. The little acta of kindness, So easily oat of mind ; Those chances to be angeb Which every mortal finds — They come In night and silence— Esoh ohill, reproachful wrath — When hope is faint and flagging. And a blight has dropped on faith. For life b all too short, dear, And sorrow h all too great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. . And It's not the thing yon do, dear, It'a the thing yon leave 'undone, Whloh gives you the bit of heartache At the setting of the sun.
