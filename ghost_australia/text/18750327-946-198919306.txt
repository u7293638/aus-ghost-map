S(n,r^;As ; it' miiy be; interesting to your readers to hear something pf-.San Francisco, it prpgress,., prospects, and its people, I venture to send youjth'e following, lines : In 1848 no such city existed, at that time the state of California, of which it is the capital, was as much as a'terfd incogilila to Ihepeople of tlie United. btates as tlie. district round the Gulf of 'Carpentana is id Australianow, if tript iric/rb so'. Within' the sh'orc period of fiye'andtwftity years it lias grown into a large arid 'hrfridsoirib city,;cpritaih|ng witliin id area a population of f iilly 220,000 people, the fiftlv city df the Union in regard to riutri ber; possibly the:second iii wbaltli arid cbm mercial lnipqrfa'nce,' aiid' the first ineriter prliid. Its site does' riot appear to behappfly chosen; the' town Iia vinpt Ueen briginally built .ori' the: side of a hill facing the bay ; with its' growth wharves have bceii, of course, ncedfed to get a sufficient depth for vessels of large tbririagc.'these had' to be built biit in the bay, the intervening space has been. ? filled in with cuttings: i rom the hill siile, rubbish, &c;, arid.hbw streets lined with spacious and hatidsoriib bu'siric'ss promises are seen whore a few years siticd shallow watdr \vas: A noticeable drawback td the city is thd'narrbwties's' of its streets. Mont gomery aiid 'Kea'rriey, .the two. priricipii business' ones', being only'abont the width of . your Bristyane-strect; aiid;'! Of course, much narrower ihan Bourke and Collins- streels of Mplbourno!.- The different places of business ho'.yevff, jewellers, dry goods, and other esUtblishineiits, present as respectable ntd solid an appearance in tire main as are to be seeii in London aiid Paris'. ITS HOTJiHS Are notice'ablo for their iimnber, extent, and commodiousness, and though last, not least, their comfort. Tho principal pries arc the Occidental, Cosmopolitan, Brooklyn, Grand, Russ-house, Iiick-horise-arid Piio'nPw^ incoursc of erection fo be called the Palace, which is intended to he the largest in' the universe. It is an aina^trig structure, Con taining 1200 rooriis, without out-ofRJes— ah instance of tlie- 'enterprise 'that prevails. Neither of the houses mentioned contain less than 400 rooms; arid ; all appear to be well snpporte'd. Most Californians seem to p'refeir hotel or boarding ho\iso life t6 houses 'ot their . oWh, mainly ho doiibt owing to the dlfliculties of obtaining arid retaining ser vants. Whole '? families live in those'. Hotels from year's end- to year's end, and it is riot uncommon for individuals to bo' bbrii,'grbw upi md'T.vra!id htvg chiklroriof tlioltcM' a' iii tho , same hotel.,, All the. larger ones have ? barber's shops, news stalls, shoe blacking establishments, ? bars, .post-offices, &c.;,' rtt ? tnched' to them. 'The billiard room of the Occidental has thirteen tables in it, cne ?would think a Bufflcient niimbcr, but appa ' rently not equal to tho demand; the fables arc all on the Trench plan, no pockets. . From hotels, to churches is an abrupt change, but I have tiikcn the former first as ;'? .'' they are located in the principal streets, and -.'?'? . a stranger c'onfliiing' hjs .pcrigriri.itions.t6' these would conclude that San Francisco had no churches, though. the fact is few cities in proportion to population possess a greater number of really conifortablo and commo dious places of ^YO^ship than are found here.
