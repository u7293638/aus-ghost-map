As tho timo was too short for him to drive to Mr E. Schroo- der's vineyard at Chinaman's Creek, ho had to content himself in tasting the various wines of this vineyard at Mr E. Sohroodor's Castlomaino depot. It may bo interesting to know that Mr E. Fitzgorald has not sold a drop of wine since lie. became the purohaser of the vineyard on Nor wood hill, and that he has at present the pro- duce of soven vintages in his cellar.

There was gnother native, however, who was reputed to bo the father. of the child, and who, when the child yas born, claimed parentago. Between him and the husband a quarrel ensued as to the ownership, ijnd.iu the squabble each seized the unfortunate infant by a leg, and did not desist until they had succeedod'in pulling -it completely in halves. Tlio ijeinains of the child wore afterwards buried pri vately, arid the horriblo deed was kcop quiet un til Maori policemen succeeded in bringing it to ljght. There is also some talk about tho grand- fithor of the infant having shot himself on hear ing of the deed." ; 1 The special reportor of the Adelaide Observer, during his recent visit to the Government Gar dens at Palmorston, Northern Territory, noticed the almost total absence of those pests, the white a Jits. He says : â€” " Going through tho sugar acreage,' one naturally wants to know whore the white ants have been that the crop should bo so hpalthy. I closely examined each plot, and only iq a few cases wore there any signs of tho ants. Mr Holtzo has a wholesome contempt of them, and when you ask him whother ho thinks tlio littlo pests will be a considerable factor in tho pjanters' losses, you soo an indignant man. He opposes to tho ants arsenic and potash, and tlie common so-called remedy of carbolic acid ho im peaches with Teutonic warpith as ' nonsenso.' ' It is all very well for the first time, so long as tho smell is there,' I10 says, 1 but when it leaves, the ants are cooly walking over tho priwdor, aud taking it to whitewash their colls with. Now I djlute my arsenic and potash in hot >vater, aud tqke sugar and flour and inako a paste. Wlion- eyer I soo white ants I mako a hole and fill it with a spoonful of tho mixture. I never liavo the least trouble with them. Arsenic, ho points'out, ' is a never-ending poison. Tlio father ant takes it and dies ; his Bons affectionately eat liiin, and' they die ; thoir mother and sisters devour them, and all givo up tho ghost, and so destruction goos on for ever.' If this bo tho truo solution of the ant difficulty, it cortainly is a very inoxpensivo ono. Four years ago, in tl|o old gardons, lie bought half a cwt of arsenic ; half of that ho has still. With what lins gopo I10 has conquered tlio anta." The Brisbane Courier states that tho first regular marsupial battup by Mr H. Bracket's trained little army since tho presunt act came into operation took place in tlio end of last month 011 the margin of Warroo run, but although the shooting was immense, and fully up to that of former years, it was vory plain to boo that tho lato apt had dono its work woll, as only 2,000 kangaroos fell to the samp number of guns that used'. to account for thrice that number three years ago. Donovan still maintains his position as eraelc shot of tho party, his score in tho lato battue 'being almost incredible. Having boon served; jyith 200 cartridges, he returned 192 scalps and four cartridges only four out of 196 shots being unaccounted for ; 98 per cent of his shots thus proved offootive, but it was the opinion of an onlooker that ovory shot took effect although tho four carcasses wore not found at tho timo. An oyo witnoss describes his ooolnesa- and cortainty of aim as something remarkable Taking his stand beside a troo, he never at tempted to fire until lie mado certain of his aim at a deadly part, always behind tho ' shoulder" In a groat number of instances the kangaroos lipprqachod tlio guns in a straight lino. In such casos Donovan would coolly walk out a pace or' tiyo from his stand, throw up somo duBt with his foot to divert tho animal from its bee-line so as to got a broadside aim, and in another instant it was lying perfectly lifeless, 'shot, ' through tho heart. Six wild hone? and two dingoes also fell to the guns during the battue
