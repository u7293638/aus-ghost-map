An Indian Ghost. 'Whilst I was reading at Moulmein,' 6ays General Fytche in his recent work of Burmah, ' I saw a ghost with mine own eyes in broad daylight, of which I could malro an affidavit. I had an old school-fellow, who was afterward® a college friend, with whom I had lived in the closest intimacy. Years, however, had passed away, without our seeing each other. One morning I had just got out of bed, and was dressing myself, when suddenly my old friend entered the room. I greeted him warmly, told him to call for a cup of tea in the verandah, and promised to go with him immediately. I dressed myself in all haste and went out into the verandah, but found no one there. I could not believe my eyes. I called to the sentry, who was posted at the front of the house, but he had seen no strange gentleman that morning. The servants also declared that no such person had entered the house. I was certain I had seen my mend. 2 was not thinking about him at the time : yet £ was not taken by surprise, as steamers and other vessels were frequently arriving at Moulmein. A fortnight after wards news arrived that he had died, six hundred miles off, . about the very time I saw him at Moulmein. It is useless to comment upon this story. To this day I have never doubted that *1 really saw the gho6t of my deceased friend.' ? ?
