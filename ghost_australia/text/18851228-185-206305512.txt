Betting—4 to 1 against Mernder, 3 to 1 Lady Ashton and Native, 10 to 1 Starfish, 100 to 3 Naming. Lady Ashton went off with a strong lead, with Chester 11., who fell badly at the first fence, and nearly rolled over his jock. Over the logs and up the hill the order was Lady Ash ton, Native, Mernder, Narrung, and Star fish, who here came down and was not re mounted. Along the back of the course Lady Ashton had a long lead, which she maintained past the stand the second time, Mernder being next in attendance. Going round the hill-top Mernder led for a few seconds, but was again passed by her lady ship, Native and Naming lying together about three lengths in the rear. These two now increased the pace in order to get on terms with the leaders, and at the sod wall Naming fell, Native repeating the perfor mance at the last fence. This left the race to Mernder, who, going much the stronger of the two, easily left Lady Ashton, and won by about five lengths, iu 5 min. 34 sec. Native was remounted, and though almost distanced, was placed by the judge as third. The Malvern Handicap. Mr T. Jones’ch c Solo .. .. .. .. 1 Mr C. Wilson’s!) mGardenia . .. .. 2 Mr J.

This was a merry flurry, resulting iu a. win by Solo, Gardenia a good second, and Allander third. B.C.C. SPORTS. The annual sports in connection with the Ballarat Cricket Club were held on the Eastern Oval on Boxing Day (Saturday), under very favorable circumstances. The weather was delightful, and the number of spectators was, therefore, large. Amongst these were a great number of visitors. The oval consequently presented a very animated appearance, there being probably about 5030 persons present. The gathering was in every way a success. The fields were large, and the contestants embraced a number of the best pedestrians in the colony. Amongst these was T. M. Malore, the champion sprint runner, but he was unfortunately so handicapped as to have no show in the races. He, however, gave a magnificent exhibition of running in the 440 yards event of the Christmas Handicap. Up till about 150 yards of tire winning “post he was last, but at that distance lie let himself ont, ran easily through the other competi tors, and soon had them beaten. Thirty yards from home he had run into first -place, and he won as he liked. The bicycle events proved interesting. Tire first trophy was won by Dwyer, who of late has been coining into notice as an amateur cyclist. He gets any amount of power into his work, and when called on seemed to be able to pass his opponents pretty much as he liked. The committee worked well to make the meeting as successful as possible, and succeeded. In our opinion, however, it would lie advisable at future gatherings to allow a little more time to elapse between the trial and the final heats of a race—particularly the longer dis tance ones—by having another event in between. This would be fairer to the com petitors and more satisfattory to the public. The takings at the gate amounted to £132, which, it is thought, will just about cover the expense incurred. The following are the results of the running;— Maiden Race, of 100 yards.— E. Scott, 1; M'Garey, 2. Hurdle Race, of 120 and 440 yards.—First event, 120 yds—\V. Dolman, 9 yds, 1; H. C.

In those events R. A. Thompson rode a “Club” Safety bieyele, weighing 501 b, and notwithstanding the difference between the weight of his velocipede and the other racing ones, managed to get very fair speed up. Walking Match, of One and Two Miles. First event, 1 mile—W. Hanlon, 20 yds, 1; W. Hill, 70 yds, 2; W. D. Spooner, 129 yds, 3.
