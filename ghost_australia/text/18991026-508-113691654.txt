LONDON WEEK BY WEEK (By Emily Soldene.) London, September 22. Good gracious! What a cold, grey, autumnal morning. Gusts to the right of you, gusts to the left of you, gusts in front of you, and spasms of torrential rain — cruel, and cold, and piercing, sud- den and silvering. All our chiffons curl at the edges like sensitive plants. The showers come down in columns, obscuring the view. We fly past the stations. The Crystal Palace looks like a Rontgen ray result — shadows, indefinite; and one would not locate it were it not for the certain certainty that “it’s somewhere thereabouts.” * * * * The chimneys of the Borough and the wholesale biscuit bakers emerge from the grey like ghosts from the gloaming. Dog biscuits— e’ tutti quan- titl, aussi e’ tutti qualiti — perfume the morning air. The mysterious river, brown and turbid, runs swiftly beneath its dusky, dingy shroud. A sudden glint of gold tips the topmost point of St. Paul’s. Scented Bermondsey is at hand, choked with narrow streets of sky-climbing warehouses, filled with riches garnered from the green offer- ings of the earth, and one sniffs, and sniffs, and sniffs in vain for the ancient and indescribable odors, of the purgatorial tanpit and preparatory leather. * * * * London, on the Surrey side, is not what “hit use’t ter be” in the way of smells. * * * * Soon we glide into “Waterloo Junction,” wet and slithery, perched way up over the tops of the lit- tle houses — their tiny, breathless rooms, and tinier back gardens, black and dirty with the smoke of ancient Southwark. Heaps of passengers tumble out. It’s Saturday — end of the week, you know; end of the season. The seaside visitors are com- ing back with a rush. Father is due at the of- fice Monday. Tommy, and Jack, and Billy, and Jim go back to school Thursday. Such a jolly holiday; such a lot to do to get the boys ready. Mother (hushing the baby) looks terrible tired; but mother don’t tell. * * * * Among the passengers are here and there flashes of scarlet flying about frantically, and flustered porters are dragging barrows of odd-looking bag- gage — long things like whitey-brown bolsters, very full indeed — adorned with non-understand- able hieroglyphics, and mysterious numbers. * * * * Of course! It’s the troops. The troops are off to-day for South Africa. Why, these are the fragments— odds and ends— loaded up with all sorts of things — clad in new scarlet tunics, trous- ers tucked into short black leather gaiters, hel- mets with — solar toupees are they called? The men look well in them. * * * * I have seen civilians wearing the same sort of headgear, and suggesting nothing so much as a perfectly lovely study for the 5th of November. * * * * Presently I find myself on the platform. “Water- loo — main line.” A rush of people this way and that. All sorts of uniforms, all sorts of soldiers — horse and foot; military one side (rifles, revol- vers, etc.), domestic the other (pots, pans, water- bottles, and an eager and anxious expression). A long, lean cavalry man comes along with a long lean blue paper. It is a list, and they all clus- ter round him — like bees round a treacle-pot. The main body went through at 8 a.m. These are the waifs and strays, called in from their leave, called in from the cities and towns, and corners of England. * * * * “Hall passengers fer th’ Castle line ter th’ front!” and everybody makes a rush. * * * * This is the officers’ train (11.40 for Southamp- ton), the officers who are to sail by the Tantallon Castle. “Now, then, clear th’ way there, and look out fer th’ baggage!” “Stand back, please; stand back.” “Why don’t yer mind.” Suddenly we are in the thick of it. All the officers in mufti, but no mistaking them. Some in morning dress, some in shooting get up, knickers and tweeds, felt hats, bowlers, and soft caps. The Church mili- tant is in evidence — pepper and salt knickers and Norfolk jacket, black stockings, soft felt black hat, clerical bands, and belt fitted for revolver. * * * * Lots of ladies; ladies that have seen service. Children, too; children that have seen service. One spots them at once; an entirely different air to the stay-at-homes — free and confident and proud — are those feminine belongings of the spreaders of the Empire. * * * * A group of fellows in khaki kit— brown riding boots, soft hats, white silk ties (made by their own or somebody else’s sweetheart), revolvers, rifles, all sorts of belts and straps, and some carry a ko- dak or snapshooter. “Who are they?” said I to a porter. “Them? Oh, they’re only war kaw- respondents. They’re er goin’ hout fer the press.” * * * * A distinct lack of respect to the “Fourth Estate” characterised this gentleman’s information. * * * * Had a little talk with one of the khaki clad ones. “Yes; they were going out on press duty. We’re joining the Natal Mounted Rifles. Had been out before; great fun; jolly country; were qualified for medical service on the field. We hope to get to the front as quickly as possible.” “Good luck,” said I. “To get to the front? That’s the luck to wish us. That’s the luck we’re looking for.” * * * * “Well, old feller,” said one mufti to another ditto. “Feel fit?” “Fit as er fiddle; and you?” “All right, except th’ rotten, beastly thing, I shan’t get out till next month. I say, old feller, do something, for me?” “Umph,” said the other, lighting his cigarette. “Send this letter to my young brother, at Ladysmith: he’s down with the fever relapse; narrow squeak, but hope he’s turned th’ corner — bowled the mater over, don’t you know, but she’d feel awfully better if her note went by a safe hand, and—— ” “By leave, gentlemen; by leave.” “Hall passengers by th’ Castle line ter th’ front.” “Oh, Colonel Ward, sorry to say goodbye.” “Sorry, dear boy — congratulate me.” “Hope to see you back, sir, for the tournament.” * * * * Colonel Ward, C.B., is the indefatigable secre- tary of the military tournaments at the Agricultu- ral Hall, adored by all the men, and is appointed Director of Transports in South Africa. * * * * “Time’s up.” The crowd press to the front. At the last moment, a great rush with things that have been forgotten— servants with swords, rifles, kit bags, all sorts of service and dispatch boxes; porters with bouquets; a last “goodbye,” tears that have been restrained now stream down faces — fa- ces, some fair and lovely, some seared and com- monplace; a last clasp, a last kiss, and women fall back, crying, sobbing, and hiding on sympathetic bosoms. Men grow white, teeth are tightly clenched — a man kisses a drummer-boy again and again with passion, and slips a sovereign in his hand. The boy’s fingers close on the coin; other- wise he’s immovable. * * * * “Stand back,” and the porters walk along. “God bless you my girl” — a whistle a groan, a jerk, a shriek from the engine. “Puff,” “puff.” All faces light up. Tears are dashed aside. “Goodbye,” “Goodbye,” “Good luck,” “Write to me.” They push the porters away, they run by the side of the carriages. One last kiss, one — “Stand back there,” “Stand back.” The train glides past, and up from the throats of the crowd, drowning the tears and cries and sobs, rings out a great chorus, “The Soldiers of the Queen.” * * * * I understand the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers, “The Fighting Fifth,” marched out of Aldershot on their way to the Cape with all sorts of honors and glories — they wore colonial red serge, and the medal and ribbon for Khartoum. * * * * Immense crowds. People came all the way from Alnwick and Newcastle-on-Tyne, to say “Good- bye.” * * * * They were headed by the bands of the 1st Dur- ham Light Infantry, 2nd Shropshire Light Infan- try, 2nd West Yorkshire, and 2nd Royal Fusiliers. * * * * “The Fighting Fifth” is 909 strong, with mo bilisation equivalent—one machine gun, 300 rounds of ball cartridge per man. * * * * As the battalion neared the station, Major-Gene- ral Hon. Neville Lyttelton (who led them at Khar- toum) galloped up. The men gave a mighty cheer, and, waving their khaki-covered helmets, saluted him in every variation of the Tyneside tongue. * * * * The “Fighting Fifth” sailed on board the Gaul, which “threw off” from Southampton Saturday last at 3.15 p.m. * * * * An artillery brigade leaves Liverpool to-day. The Royal Irish Fusiliers leave Egypt for Natal on the 23rd. The First Battalion Border Regi- ment, from Malta, is due at Natal October. 22. Second Brigade from Crete due Natal October 25. The Indian troops, consisting of 21st, 42nd, and 53rd Field Batteries, the 5th Dragoon Guards, 9th Lancers, 19th Hussars, the 1st Battalion Devon- shire Regiment, 1st Battalion Gloucestershire Re- giment, 2nd Battalion King’s Royal Rifle Corps, and the Second Battalion Gordon Highlan- ders are expected at Natal first week in October. * * * * A list of officers who sailed on Saturday (on the Tantallon Castle) with the new Commander-in- Chief for Natal, Lieutenant-General Sir George White, V.C.:— * * * * Personal staff : Colonel Duff, Indian Staff Corps, Assistant Military Secretary; Colonel Ian Hamil- ton, A.A.G.; Colonel E. W. W. Ward, C.B., O.A.A.G., Home District; Colonel C. E. Beckett, A..D.G.O.; Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry Rawlin- spn, D.A.A.G.; Lieutenant- Colonel H. M. Lawson, A.A.G. (at Durban), and Major Fred. Hammersley. * * * * Other officers: Colonel W. D. Richard- son, Colonel Exham, Brevet Lieut- Colonel F. W. Landon, Lieut.-Colonel J. S. Swart, Major E. N. Altham, Major H. B. Riddell, Major R. C. Haking, Major A. W. Thorneycroft, Major St. John Gore, Maior R. B. Gaisford, Major W. Fairholme, Major W. H. Birkbeck, Major J. F. Bateson, Brevet-Major W. F. Walter, Captain Sir E. Chichester, Bart, R.N., Captain F. Lyon, Cap- tain Foley, Captain Van Koughnet, R.N., Captain R. Stuart-Wortley, Captain R. G. Brooke, Cap- tain W. B. Lafone, Captain C. W. Grey, Captain H. F. Deare, Captain R. Sparrow, Commander F. R. W. Morgan, R.N. (to command H.M.S. Tartar), Lieutenant H. G. Burrard, Lieutenant J. G. Stir- ling, Lieutenant D. R. Brooke, Lieutenant B. R. Horsburgh, Lieutenant A. C. G. Luther, Lieutenant Perry Ayscough, R.N., Lieutenant R. E. Reade, Lieutenant Long, Lieutenant H. N. Field, Lieuten- ant Marsden, Lieutenant C. F. MacKenzie, R.N., Lieutenant and Quartermaster J. C. Woods, Pay- master Beresford-Whyte, R.N., Mr. C. G. Rey- port, R.N., Mr. S. J. Lacey, R.N., Mr. J. Menzies, R.N. * * * * The military correspondent of the “Sunday Times” says: Sir George White’s appointment to the cominand of the new garrison in Natal has caused some discussion in the service. His abil- ity is undoubted, but there is a strong opinion that not an Indian commander is required, but an officer with South African experience. Sir George has none. It would have been wiser to appoint- Sir Evelyn Wood. Sir Evelyn is one of two men whom the Boers fear most. Sir Redvers Buller and Sir Evelyn Wood are the commanders they have most to dread, each knowing the Boer and his country like an alphabet. I echo a service com- ment — the strongest combination would be Buller at the front, and Wood upon the Natal base. * * * * I have to get back to that “Fighting Fifth.” Their condition is absolutely unique— 900 men passed the doctors, and only “one” not fit. * * * * I suppose you will think I’ve gone military mad. But I cannot resist sending you a few lines from a soldier in India. “All pull together with such a will out here, and the men seem to chum together properly, not the chumming of the canteen order, but that friendship which is bred of hard working together, either in the field or in barrack. Fel- lows on service here look after each other like brothers, sharing each other’s weed and doctoring a sick chum. This is the secret of British succes- ses, this pulling together, officers and men alike.” * * * * Well, if I was (or is it “were?”) a man, I’d go for a fioldier. Tho’, when I come to think on’t, even a woman has been known “to go” for a sol- dier. But of course I don’t mean that way. * * * * The Queen’s new donkey has arrived. Such a beauty. It has gone direct to Windsor. Such a good donkey; so good tempered. Such a sailor; wasn’t sick once — heavy seas from Suez to Lon- don; lots of water aboard, but the donkey didn’t mind, and when he — I mean she — landed, didn’t she kick up her heels, and skipped about like Mary’s lamb. * * * * There was another donkey aboard — a present from Lord Kitchener to the Duchess of Cleveland. (There’s going to be a real run on donkeys, I can tell you.) The donkeys struck up an acquaintance, not to say friendship. They took their walks on the deck together. The donkey of the Duchess is not so amiable as the donkey of the Queen, and, to put it mildly, was a trifle jealous of the extra at- tention paid to the property of her Majesty. * * * * “They’re very fond of each other,” said Sapper Draper, who was in charge of the Queen’s donkey. “I don’t know anything about donkeys. I’ve been putting up telegraph wires to Omdurman. But I’m sure when they’re parted they’ll fall a-crying for each other.” * * * * Ranji and his cricketers sailed from Liverpool for New York on Saturday. The members of the team are: K. S. Ranjit Sinhji, Sussex (captain), A. C. MacLaren (Lancashire), A. Priestly (M.C.C.), G. Brann (Sussex), C. L. Townsend (Gloucestershire), S. M. J. Woods (Somerset), G. L. Jessop (Glouces- tershire and Cambridge University), A. E. Stoddart (Middlesex), B. J. T. Bosanquet (Middlesex and Ox- ford University), C. Robson (Hampshire), W. P. Robertson (Cambridge University), and V. Barton (Hampshire), who will act as attendant. * * * * They expect to reach America to-morrow, and will play their first match against 18 “Philadelphia colts” on Monday next. They are due back in London October 25. * * * * The New Yorkers are going to fete Prince Ranji. He is to be the rage for the next few weeks, and will probably put the nose of Lord Yarmouth out of joint. By-the-bye, have you heard his lord- ship has accepted an engagement with Mr. Froh- man, and will make his American professional de- but in “The Tyranny of Tears” ? * * * * The newest “cult” in Philadelphia just now is a very difficult one — the proper pronunciation of Prince Ranjit Sinhji’s name. * * * * Dreyfus is pardoned! Dreyfus is free! “The incident is closed,” says General Gallifet to the army of France. But Dreyfus, does not say “Amen” to that sweet prayer. Dreyfus is deter- mined to fight for his honor, and the declaration of his innocence all in good time. Meanwhile, rest and recuperate. * * * * Quite a romantic flitting of Dreyfus. Three a.m., dark night; drizzling rain. Three men leave the prison. They look round cautiously. Not a soul to be seen; not a sound to be heard. A walk to the bridge, where Labori was shot down. A car- riage and pair driving slowly; a low whistle, the carriage stops, the three men get in, the driver whips up his horses; off they go at a gallop. * * * * But, in spite of all, the ubiquitous journalist was on the spot; unobserved, also provided with a carriage, which, followed. On—on — where could they be going? At last, the first carriage goes more slowly; the journalistic one comes up with it. The driver is lighting his pipe — the carriage is empty! * * * * At a convenient turn the three had alighted, and walked to the railway station of Vern. * * * * The “Daily Mail” is “cock-a-hoop” at having solved the difficulty, and brought the Dreyfus situ- ation to a head by the proposed boycott of the exhi- bition. Of course that’s all over now, and every- body is going in for more space than can be got. * * * * Apropos of the boycot, I send you a dear little letter : “To the Editor of the ‘Pall Mall Gazette.’ “Dear Sir, — I had a beautiful rabbit. It was a Belgian hair. I kept it in a hutch. Yesterday. I found out the Hutch was made with French nails, so I pulled it to peices. My rabbit ran away, and I don’t know where it is, but I think in the dog next door. So I am a legion of Honor like the Daily mail says. “Father says never mind. Lots of other people has lost their Hair about Dreyfus too but I think he meant something. — Your affectionate little friend, R. Paxton. “72 Riggendale-road, Streatham. Friday, Sep- tember 15, 1899.” * * * * Great jubilation among a certain section of ’bus horses. They are going to the war, to gallop and prance, and neigh and canter, ’mid the storm and stress of battle, instead of ignominiously dragging the prosaic tram and things of that sort. It seems the Government pay the companies a slight subsi- dy, and have the right to call for as many horses as they require. The selection of a lot has been made, and the gee-gees are being fitted out for foreign service. * * * * “Hearts are Trumps” is a great triumph at Drury-lane. Such scenery, such sensations, such costumes, such modes, such millinery, never been seen before. It began 7.30 p.m:, and finished 12.15 a.m. This is felt to be too much of a good thing, besides, all the pubs. are kicking. No matter, the blue pencil of the-edi— I mean the stage-manager — will soon rectify that. Everybody raving about the spectacle; nobody knows anything about the drama; nobody cares; the play’s a secondary consi- deration. The show’s the thing. * * * * “The Moonlight Blossom” at the Prince of Wales, is a Japanese puzzle; also a Japanese fizzle. Such a lot of money spent; such beautiful pictures of beautiful Japan; such lovely costuiuos; such delightful artiste as “Mrs. Wat” and Mr. Forbes Robertson, all thrown away — N — G — such, a pity. * * * * “The Moonlight Blossom” is a sacred plant that blossoms only once in thirty years, and then in the moonlight. Irreverent critics last night said they wished it only blossomed once in sixty years; then they would have had a chance of assisting at Mr. Charles Morton’s 80th birthday party at the Palace. * * * * Such a turn out of England’s greatest. The house looked like Covent Garden in the Italian opera season a night after a Drawing Room; bril- liant in the extreme. So many illustrissimi behind the scenes; mobs of titled ones; lots of literature and art, and money! Mammon and Company ex- ceedingly well to the fore. * * * * Such a lot of artists — all sorts of fun. Edna May and “The Belle of New York” chorus walked across from the Shaftesbury in their costumes, to the great admiration of all sorts of men, people, and things. John Wallace was in charge. He says “It’s nice in London; but nicer in Austra- lia.” * * * * Mrs. Clement Scott recited with splendid point an ode to the G.O.M. of the Music Halls — written by her ever delightful husband. I send you a stave:— * * * * Sixty or seventy years ago, in the days of the “drinking ken,” The jokes they made and the songs they sang were a sorrow to Englishmen, If you doubt my word, take Thackeray down, and Colonel Newcombe call, To tell you the tale of the days of “Ross” and the shudder of vile “Sam Hall;” But he dreamed of the madrigal, Grand Old Man! and the English catch and glee, And murmured, “Pleasure it should be pure, and Art it must be free.” So he opened a “Sing-song,” , bright and gay. Vice took to its heels and ran! Said the women, “Oh, Governor, let us in!” “You shall come,” said the Grand Old Man. * * * * “Clemmy” is just as fit as ever. Over his ev- ening dress he wore an Inverness cape, lined with red satin. It was thrown back, and gave him the appearance of a D.C.L. But he denied the soft impeachment. He was very nice to me. “Emily,” said he, “you’re a wonder.” Upon my word I’m beginning to find out there are moments in one’s life worth working up to. * * * * The House rose in admiration. Mr. Morton got a cheque for £1265, in a silver casket. Not bad, eh! He made a capital speech, and every- body got up and sang “For he’s, etc., etc.” * * * * A beautiful audience. A certain person sang a certain duett, with a lovely lady named Isabel Jay. We had a great success; no end of bouquets, ditto of calls. * * * * Mary Elliott Page is doing a sketch at the Pal- ace. It is called “The Order of the Bath.” She is assisted by Mr. Scott Russell. * * * * “King John,” at Her Majesty’s, is voted a gor- geous show, but a dull play. This is the age of laughter — agonies and serious things take a back seat. Nowadays we button our skeletons very firmly in their cupboards. * * * * Mrs. Lushby: “Oh, you needn’t try to conceal your condition. You’re holding the paper upside down.” Mr. Lushby: “I don’t m’dear. Did it on pur- posh. Something here no deshent man oughter read.” * * * * Said he, at her idly gazing, “Do you paint?” She murmured' “No.” Then her eyes to his upraising, Shyly added, “Does it show?” * * * * “Now, boys,” said the Sunday- school teacher, “our lesson to-day teaches us that if we are good while here on earth, when we die we shall go to a place of everlasting bliss. But, suppose we are bad, then what will become of us.” “We’ll go to a place of everlasting blister,” re- plied a small boy at the foot of the class.”
