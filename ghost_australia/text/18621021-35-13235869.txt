MUSIC AND DRAMA. AN opera season of unprecedented success, so fat as Mr Ljster's remuneration ia concerned, terminated in Sjdney on Saturday, the 27th ultimo On the Monday following the company appeared at a concert m tho new hall of the behool of Arts, which was also well attended Many peisons thought that after taking about £8000, Mr Lyster did not evince that liberality which charactensed the people of Sydney towards lum, in leaving it without giving, as is usually the case, one night for the benefit of the charities of this cty, or for the lehef of the starving of his own countrv - Ireland It was urged by a correspondent in this journal that such a sacrifice on Mr .Lyster s part could scarcely be expected, as if he lost by his speculation no one would leel disposed to reim- burse him Mr Lyster has, however, always been successful in Sydney, though it is stated that in Melbourne he has not. The Philharmonic Society gave their first concert of the season on luesday last it the rieemasons Hall, and attracted a numerous and res- pectable attendance Hie first part of the concert consisted of Mendelsshon's "Hymn of Praise' (Lobge- sang) Ihe airs, duets, and choruses of this beautiful compositionwere admirably BUH¿, showing very care- ful studv and practice Ihe soprano and tenor solos, which were given bv amateur members of the society, were grcatlj admired Ihe whole of the hymn was creditablj sung Hie second part of the concert com- menced with the overture to ' La Cheval de Bronze" bj the orchestra of the society Afterwhich Mr Hodge performed a solo on the clarionette, which elicited great applause, and an encore was demanded. Mrs Cordner then sang very íirely a cavatina " Or la Sutt onda,' and was followed bv Master A. Anderson, who performed on the pianoforte a fantasia by Thal- berg on airs from the opera of Lucrzia Borgia. This young gentleman, who is a pupil of Dr. Sterndale Bennett, has occasionally appeaed before a Sydney audience, and has always been favourably received His execution is characterised by extraordinary facility of fingering and by thorough command over the instrument, the pieces selected for performance being very difficult, and putting to the test the powers of the pianist An encore was demanded Ihe con eluding {.eiformance was the celebrated solo and chorus from the third act of the opera of Ernani, which were also well sung. The society is under the conductorship of Mr D. Callen. The Orpheonists announce a concert to take place m the Shcool ot Arts early m the ensuing month Ihe "\ letona was re opened after the close of the operatic season, for ordinary dramatic performances, ou Monday, the 29th instant, when Bulwer 8 play of Richelieu was produced, in which Mr Barry Sullivan nnde his first appearance before a Sj dney audience, and was very favourably received lhere was a large and attentive house-pit, boxes, and gallery-and the performance of the principal piece of the evening waa, as it proceedea, frequentlj interrupted with discnmi r ming and well-deserved applause Mr B Sullivan sustained the character of the Cardmal with a mingled energy ind lecblenets, and a severe truthfulness to nature, which did ample justice to Bulwer s admir- able dramatic conception of that veteran statesman who, during the nominal reign of Louis thel hirteenth, swnj ed the sceptre of 1 ranee with so much cruelty, BO much sagacity, and BO much success Hie piece wae, m many respects, well caBt and carefully played, as regarded the more Buboidiuate characters-the De Mauprat of Mr, H N Warner bemg an admir ible and tpnited impersonation Richelieu was played on the next two following nights, and was then succeeded by the tragedy of Hamlet Hit difficult character of the noble and melancholy Prince of Denmark was, on the 2nd instant, sus- tained, for the first time in Sydney, oy Mr Barry Sullivan, Mr Neil Warner playing the part of the Ghost of the murdered king Mrs Charles Poole (an old favourite w ith Sj dnej playgoers) appeared in the rather trjmg and unimpressive character of Gertrude, and was well received Mrs Hill's Ophelia was also a very pleasing performance, especially in the scene where she has the interview with Hamlet The Polonius, of Mr J J. WelBh, was also a very excel- lent and carefully- studied impersonation Mr Barry Sullivan's Hamlet has been a great success, having been pronounced by all competent judges to be far before that of any other actor who has yet appeared m the part on the Sjdney stage It is a character affording full scope to tne finished elocution and graceful action which ate so eminently characteristic of Mr Sullivan's performance, accompanied with an evident and particulat exercue of thought, evincing a 6tudy of the text which bringa out many of its beau- ties in a very striking and unexpected mannet His reading of this magnificent play is very different from that oí the ordinary stage version, and in most cases a decided improvement Hamlet was repeated by command under the patronage and presence of his Excellency, on the luesday lollowing, and has since been reproduced before large and appreciative audi- ences Mr Sullivan has since appeared as the ' Stranger, ' " Claude Melnotte," ' Richard the Ihird, ' Benedick, ' and several other of his leading characters, with much success, and is btill performing at the Victoria, where he ia supported by Messrs Warner, Welsh, Rogers, Chapman, M Gowan, and other members of the numerous com- pany-the principal female parts being sustained by Meedamcs Poole, Hill, Chapman, Crosby, and M Gowan The urnmatic season at the Lyceum recommenced, after a short recess, on Saturday, the 4th instant, with the production of the beautiful three act comedy of " The Unequal Match," in which that talented and popular actress, MISB Joey Gougen heim, made her reappearance before her bvdney friends m the character of Hester Grazebook, and was enthusiastically received Miss Pannv Morgan, Mr. and Mrs Frederick lounge, Mr 1 S Bcllair, Mis Lizzie Najlor, and other leading members of the prêtent company-old favourites or new faces-like wise successfully experienced the gratifying honour of a similar reception-Mr Charles Burford, in par ticular, being complimented withteiterated shouts of welcome Ihe hoube was densely crowded every where-pit, parquette, boxes, and gallery-and the peifotmance ind wise cn scene in both of the pieces piesented fully deserved the cordial approval so freely exoTcsBed by the audience The leading characters of Lady Arncliffe and her rival, Mrs Montresor. were supported by Joey Gougenheim and Miss Fanny Morgan with an amount of artistic talent which riveted the attentive admiration of the audience, and commanded tepeated marks of hearty, well-deserved approbation fiora. all parts oi the house Anything mote spirited and lifelike than the scene between the two ladies m the second act-the young wife and her uval-has seldom been otesented en the Sjdney stage Ihe worldly disappointment and polished bitterness of Mrs Montresor, her sarcastic taunts and rising but wtll- diBsembled rage, »Abided a fine contrast to the tver-vorjing emotions of Lady Arncliffe, the gentle wife, who at length, sorely tried, becomes wholly un- able to repress her feelings, and gives way to a womanlv outburst of passion full of that purity and dignity with which the dramatist has invested the part.
