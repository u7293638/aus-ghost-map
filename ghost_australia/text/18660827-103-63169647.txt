MIRACULOUS ESCAPE. I A little girl nnmed Louisa Stringer, eleven yeni^s of . Bge, was returning with' her : brother, about seven yean of age, from the Churoh of England Sabbath School, Eaglehawk, io her residence in Jaokass flat, and on orossing the AgnewReef, opposite the police station*, she, in a risky mood, ran tip a heap of mullock round an 'old shaft, but when ' on, the top the loose clay close by the edge gave way. and she fell down the shaft— a perpendicular 'one for eighty feet, and then rolled down on the under lie of the reef, thirty feet farther. Her brother, hearing her cry, and seeing her disappear, screamed with all his might, and soon attracted the attention: of the police and other persons residing in the neigh borhood, who hurried over,, and a ' rope being, obtained, two miners were lowered to the under lie, down whioh one of them went and fouad the' girl lying insensible, -and' pale as a ghost, .with the retioule, in whioh were - her. Sabbath: school books, grasped tightly in her hand. She; was broaght to the surfaoo, and hor faca and hands laved with- water. ' It was thought she was 'dead ; but after a while consciousness returned, and the first words she uttered were,' Oh, my mother ; my mother.: She'll wonder what's keeping me opt.'. The only injuries she appeared to have received were a soalp wound on the baok of the head, and a Blight' abrasion on the right temple. How she escaped being killed ia a wonder ; probably' a quan tity of soft earth lying on the top of the underlie on whioh she first fell acted like a cushion, breaking . the force of the fall and saving her life. The little girl was sent home, and -'was met by her parents, who had in the meantime been informed of the oo Ottirenoo.—Bendiffo Advertiser, August :14. ? ! '
