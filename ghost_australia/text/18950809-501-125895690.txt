A Stupid Practical Joke Tim practical joker familiarly termed 'the ghost' has not yet been captured (leports the Melbourne Argus). He lias been reported from almost every suburb, aud a few nights ago he had a narrow escape in Collingwood. Several score of people gave hitn chase, but he succeeded in getting away. Had he been caught he would doubtless have been prevailed upon to cease his stupid conduct. His methods are similar to those of the 'ghosts' and ' Spring-heel Jacks ' of past years. He wears an overcoat, or ulster, and when in con veniently dark places throws the coat or ulster open, displaying to the gaze of women or children a phosphorus-painted cotKn ou his breast, with the words written across it ' Prepare, to meet thy doom.' Several children have been frightened out of their -vitas by the man, and he has become such a nuisance that the police are anxious to lay hands upon liiin. The last one of the ' ghosts ' who was run to earth was a medical student. A revolver shot fired by a horseman whom he hud tried to terrify finished his career. It did him 110 harm, but it scared hitn so badly that he gave up playing jokes. A lad named Sydney Errington was arrester! at South Yarra on Tuesday night charged with insult ing behaviour. He was masquerading in a peculiar costume, which gave the impression at the time that lie was tlie ' ghost.' This was found to be a false impression, and liis little display in a Tain o' Shauter hat, spectacles, and a ' false heard was liis first essay in the foolish business.
