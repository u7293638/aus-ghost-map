THROUGH THE NIGHT. THE SHIFTING SCENE. (By Wadda.) It is so obviously but a part of a truth that one-half the world does not know how the other half lives that one wonders how the saying over got itself current as a wise aphorism Not a millionth part of the world over knows how another millionth continues to keep its footing on this strange old earth How should it Moreover, in a thousand cases it does not want to know Why should it It is incumbent to admit unpleasant truths at times and this is one of them. No doubt the spirit of philanthropy is restless in these modem days, but, like everything else that is acquired, not natural, it has its sharp boundaries You may for yourself or your friends into a Society , if you care to go in- dustrious into the bjwajB it stated times and diamente orders for provisions and improving literature among the poor, after which you have done your duty and may go home to dinner with an easy conscience To enter into the life of the wreckage of a great city is another matter In truth, it is impossible With the utmost difficulty is it possible for man to just bal el} recall the most poignant feelings of sorrow and joy that at one period or another wrung his heart How is it possible to enter into the soil rows and joy is of another ? Thisiswhv, is once n figure slink miserably into the Domain after midnight, it is possible to mutter " poor fellow, " with an almost painlessly transient -lash of feeling, pull out a cigar, and go home to your own domain of a warm fireside and bed "It is necessary for me to exist," says someone to the French Minister, to which he answers, with brutal frankness, " I see no necessity for it " That was a repulsive access of cynical callousness, yet is it not very much the attitude of ourselves to ourselves ? Not that we are all hard-hearted and indifferent only two " do not see the necessity cannot get near enough to the position of anyone else, or far enough from our own A few hours spent in the streets of Sydney after the Post Office clock Ima clanged out mid- night will provide good material for this sort of commonplace philosophising " Upwards of five hundred thousand two-legged animals without feathers lie round us in horizontal positions their heads all in night- caps and full of the foolishness dreams " says Teufeledrtckh Yes, but there are a few always who have neither nightcaps nor dreams, foolish or others me If they slumber it is uneasily in the wretchedness lodgements i but for the most part rest has no attraction for them In number they are not great, but insignia cant as they are from what point of view, they are interesting, for they stir uneasily through the city as though a band of ghosts, condemned to live in a world not theirs, and yet knowing no other The night bird cannot be mistaken He is poorer than the poor, for the very poor always have their own society often friends, but this veritable-and perhaps rather terrible-tjpifien tion of " the man in the street " is Casual throughout his being He attaches himself to one , no one is in community with him, not even his brother unfortunate Casually he may beg a light, or speak to a policeman, or cat at a coffee still ; but the next night it will be a different policeman and another coffee-stall This particular kind of love has no rounds What is he Whence comes ho9 What was his once ? As well seek to read the most complicated riddle of life itself an answer 2' He cannot really exist at all," says comfortable Well to doom, as it puts down its paper the thing is a myth, a conception of a vulgar fancy " "w el!, let comfortable Well-to doctor put on his overcoat and try the experiment of a few hours in the streets after midnight If it, further, keeps its 0} os and cars open it may come to realise that there are a great many more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in its philosophy It is curious to observe how suddenly Night I comes upon a city, though the Night proper is I'm res lity day But there is nothing in this aspect it is the phase that I makes the dn sion Half an hour after i midnight all these sounds have vanished -the confused roaring of the streets is no more, the , volley mg numbers of the tram cars are silent, the i lights and the crowds and the scene in the I ' ever-changing procession of the streets are all obliterated And the metamorphosis of the real is accompanied by one in the ideal Perhaps the moon is riding high overhead and the foulest street detail is made ethereal The dingy pavements are flags of silver, the houses stand white and shapely against the background of the sky, over a stray piece of orange peel, at a little distance away, is susceptible of the strongest transformation process So, too, is the figure that picks it up, tosses it into a bag on its back, till you get up with it Then all the moon's glamour is off the Sydney chiffonniere it well-known person in the night's train He is a far different per ton from the absolute Inscrtitnblo going persistently around from nowhere to nowhere, fur he has a trade under a motive, albeit it is of the prettiest and humblest Still, it is worthy the cursory glance of him with a comfortable bank balance, for does it not seem to illustrate the variety of colours compounded in that strange 1 nleidoseopio thing " the Public " for the old man almost bent double, with his bags of multifarious garbage slung across his back, and his improvised alpenstock for probing the dust boxes and the kennels, has been known to pursue his calling year after year, and he is one of " the Public " One wonders if he has a vote, and if so, what his interest is in federation and such like subjects having a direct bearing on his profession He is not the only one who pursues it, however Quite a respectable number of men and women pass the surplus odds and ends account! d ty worthless at the end of each day's work by Respectability , under micro- scopes review at night Bits of iron and metal and bottles and paper are examined, with the care t line scientist- classify specimens, and sometimes a stray coin is found in the rubbish " "What do I got out of it " said one of these whom I questioned "Well, I gets three meals a Any and a slap up suit of togs like this here," and he pointed to his dilapidated trousers and broken boots A certain kind of poverty is always ironical supposing the night to be a very, dark one, and v you have it and eel along George street and down by Circular Quay j On your to ay you w will not fail to have observed how the shadows cou earth yield up the People of the Night They come upon you especially if you are in the mood that has made this observation the errand of your excursion, in honor fitting this ditions under world One can almost detect the regular night in be able by his for a footfall There is a hopeless slouch in it, a despondent shame, us if these lectures is pilgrimages from now here to nowhere had deprived our outcasts of the last vestige of average pedestal of concealing their wretchedness from every one as, indeed, they have, except in one important respect The home- less destitute are not commonly beggars I mean the genuinely homeless and over- worn, as distinguished from the criminal " loafer" class You may walk from Redfern to the lower end of Pitt-street and back again, without being stopped by one of those derelicts, unless it be an occasional, petition for a " wretch " Oh, those "matches in the day time the request is preferred by all sorts of un worthies, lusty park loafers, idle street patrols, all sorts and conditions to lazy to provide themselves Hut at night time he who wants a match is a sort of pathetic symbol of distress at its lowest ebb It is perhaps the last favour that spent flotsam of the city cares to ask or would get granted By taking up a position at a certain point one is able to see that this nightly perambulation of the streets is no men detach ed phantasy the procession moves on too painfully regular for any such soothing unction to be extracted First, perhaps, it is a decent sort of fortune who passes your stand 16-18 hp one of that not inconsiderable class which, even though it is very willing to work, will not assemble at the Statue or join in abusing the Labour Bureau He is followed by an obviously blase traveller of the season as he treads the flags with something of an air of unconscious proprietorship it is but right he should for he has tried them many a weary hour after midnight And many figures come into view, making the continuing links in this significant procession A woman, all distraught and un- kempt , an old fellow, in clothes of shreds and patches wonderfully fastened together, a red-coated, neatly brushed, and almost booties, man of about 40 (probably a crowded-out school- master), a dozen other representatives of the un fittest, who get sermon simply because they still feel the necessity for doing so I do not mean to say that those may be counted by hundreds, or even by scores, but there they are to be detected by him who stands and watches Policeman XYZ, to whom I apply for confirms crop, gives me melancholy .o_.su_tu_oo on this head " They're not beggars and they're not thieves," he says, "thoy'rojustbroke Wy word," he adds, with a sudden access of professional interest, " there's some warm runs over there," and he waves his hand towards Hyde Park It is too comprehensive a task to examine these warm 'una " at a sitting, though it is inferred that warm tin" signifies a predilection for garroting and similar aids to the predatory keeping of body and soul together It need not be thought that the life of the small hours is all outward misery and privation A certain amount of rank activity goes forward ceaselessly in a great city like Sydney into some of those quaintly dirty rookeries between Lower George-street and the Observatory you may cautiously penetrate and be convinced that all the world does not virtuously retire to rest at 11 o'clock It has been said that the Chinese gambling sons are all gone perhaps they really are only in some of these little alleys and courts you may hear, well towards morning, the chink of coins and muffled voices from behind dingy naphtha lighted windows The voices, too, are not always those of the enterprising Mongol-can it really be that the Caucasian sits up through the night (in spite of so many delightful associations for his moral improvement), wagering his earnings against Chinese cunning p But here there is no obliging member of the force to enable one to speak with authority Nor is there, later on, when down fcj Pyrmont was, near the water's edge one stumbles upon a low-browed little house Lights from the back windows are streaming, the regular beat and shuffle of dancers feet can he heard, shouting, and the jingling of glasses " They're at it again," says a tired fireman, who almost runs on the top of me as he turns the corner " Who are they " I ark eagerly, but he only replies, "You know," in tones of mingled suspicion and satire, and plunges into the darkness Evidently " they," whoever they are, are an established institution It is said that, in other parts of the world, deep sea sailormen squander their earnings of months in drinking booths, but surely this cannot be so in St edney The coffee-stall is a feature of the night, but it merits a whole article to itself and it is necessary to have some finality The coffee-stall keeper could tell many strange tales, for has he not been a spectator on the night scene week after week, year after year He is watchful and observant when the hotels are turning out their last batches of roysterers, he sees the swelling crowds before midnight melt away till the battered breakages claim the streets for their own, house still sleepless when the morning creeps into the sky And, by- the-way it is worth while to try to catch a glimpse of night life, if only to see the morning coming upon the city Of course, we know all about it on the mountain tops, or in the polish or on river scene , but in a city street especially if it is a narrow and dirty one, there is yet a fresh impression to be had But what that impression is the strange drabs and yellows and greys turning the houses to fantastic colours-the Voyageur through the night must find out for himself
