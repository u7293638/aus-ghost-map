LONDON MISSIONARY SOCIETY. PuilLIC MEETING. A scenic meeting, ín-ísonnoction with this society, on the occasion of the visit to Sydney if the new mission ship John "Williams and the four missionaries who are on the way to the South Sea Islands was held yesterday evening, in St George's Church, Castlereagh street The meeting was largely attended, every part of the church being crowded His Excellency the Governor occupied the chair On the platform, or in its immediate vicinity, were the following gentlemen, several of whom, as will be seen from the report, took part in the proceedings -The Rev John Abraham, Rev "W Slatyer, Rev Adorn Thomson, Rev C Pitman, Rev A Brown, Rev S Humphries, Rev J West, Rev J, E. Vetch, Rev J P. Sunderland, Rev J Chalmers, Rev S Davis, Rev A Saville, Rev W Watson, Lord John ley tour, Mr. J Fairfax, and Mr G A Lloyd The proceedings were commenced by singing Bishop Heber missionary hymn, " from Greenland s icy mouse traps " The Rev J E Vetch then offered prayer, and the Rev. J Graham read the 67th Psalm Sir JOHN "i OUR), who was received with applause rose and said, as the paper which he held in his hand set forth the names of a large number of speakers who were the roughly versed in missionary enterprise, he should not detain them except with a very few general observations In the first place, bow wished to say that he appeared there that night to show his respect for that great independent body from whom the London. Missionary Society chally emanated (Cheers ) That body had establishes J many claims to respect but one pro eminently, inasmuch as it had consistently supported through all changes-in storm and sunshine, in power and adversity, when they were in the ascendant, and when they were under perforation they had consistently clung to the principle of civil and religious liberty (Cheers ) Whether in prosperity or adversity they maintained to the fullest extent, and carried out in practice the doctrine of complete toleration (A pi cause) It would be generously acknowledged that for the services rendered upon the soil of England this body were entitled to enduring gratitude The project that had called them together that night, namely, the maintenance and extention of the message of have and instruction to the distant Islands of the Pacific the abo les of darkness scattered over that vast ocean, should attract the attention of every benevolent and thoughtful person, and he was happy to be able to congratulate that great assemblage, as well as all those who took an interest in the cause that this meeting Man not held to trace the outlines of the first attempt, to make the first beginning in doubt and hesitation, knowing not of the difficulties to be encountered, nor of the amount of support and sympathy with which it may be rendered to meet its difficulties they were not walking on an untrodden path the difficulties had in a great measure been surmounted, for it had been well said that that which had been well begun was more than half executed. (Cheers) They might fairly measure that which had to be accomplished by that which had been already done the missionaries had not preached an obst net gospel, but a practical scriptural Chrifllianitv The heathen had learnt to abandon many of their foul rites practised in days of superstition, which in past times, like funds, had devastated localities on which nature had lavished her gifts with a bountiful band Some months ago he learnt from a missionary who had spent many years in the Pacific, that all those missionaries within the sphere of his observation lived and laboured in harmony with each other (Cheers ). It was satisfactory to know that all the Protestant missions were agreed and united as one, and that although they divided (the field of labour, they did not clash in competition or local rivalry , but each missionary wishing God speed to his neighbour, laboured to destroy the wilderness of one fence and sin within his own allotted bounds (Ap- plause ) This showed a true righteous course and a Christian spirit, and it was not surprising, therefore, that the efforts to evangelize the heathen were blessed with a large amount of success Writers in no way partial to missionary enterprise had admitted that wherever the missionary planted his foot old evils died out Those famous passions which had set tribe against tribe had died out, the marriage tie was held to be holy, woman was placed in her proper position of respect and equality and thus the first step was taken in civilisation Not only old evils disappeared, but now safeguards were introduced, and the people were fortified against the temptations which almost invariably accompanied the march of civilisa- tion They were taught to shun intoxicating drinks and other vices Wherever the missionary had planted his foot firmly there were found the host openings for legitimate trade and all elevating influences to support the teaching which this mission proposed to impart and the aims which it had in view, although they has been ridiculed in some quarters, was a duty incumbent upon the whole of the English people to England much bad been given, did much would be required of her Her coalmine encircled the earth, and her Ships navigated every sea, and they should bring with traffic and the hope of gain the treasures of instruction and the gifts of the Gospel (Cheers ) Let them then in their el ly had gone Tatitn not follow the example of the Pharisees of old who turned with supercilious contempt from ignorance and vice Let them and reach error and ignorance, and wherever they found it, whether in the streets or in their homes, I approach it in a true Christian spirit, with a vehement j desire to enlighten those who wandered in darkness and stood in need of assistance (Applause ) The Rev J GRAHIVI said the resolution which he held in his hand was as follows " That this meeting thanks God for his providential care over the new missionary ship John Williams and the four missionaries who are on their way to the South Sea Islands, and rejoices in the London Missionary Society's operations in the South Pacific and other arts of the world, in' prays that the rich and abundant influence of the Holy Spirit may be given to all societies engaged in the evangelisation of the heathen He could not express the great gratification which it gave him, his brethren, and that large meeting to welcome to that missionary platform his Excellency Sir John Young (Cheers) He (Mr. Graham) bad too high an opinion of his Excellency's taste and judgment to offer one word of history but he could not but thank God for the enlightened, Sinpluril, and truthful views of the mission v rrk which his Excellency had that night uttered So xvi bed that all his congregation, and all the friends of Christian missions in Sydney, had studied the subject so well as the Governor of the colony had done It was a pleasant thing to find that one in his Excellency's portion could appreciate (ho consistency and sacrifices of their forefathers as they had heard that night. He (Mr. Graham) was reminded of a long list of speakers to follow some of whom they should not see again for by earache referred to the nus sionancs-nid therefore his remarks should be few and in the first place he should make a few statements in reference to the work of the society This resolution spoke of the Providential care of the ship and the missionaries It might have been very different in regard to both the ship and the missionaries Some of them were aware that the ship shortly after leaving port encountered that fearful gale in which the steamship London was lost, and in which nearly 100 vessels were wrecked The ship battled with the tempest and at one time it appeared that hope had gone The missionaries assembled for prayer, and they continued in prayer and in singing hymns of praise, prepared for whatever it pleased God to send Well, the ship came out of it safe, and had now arrived in Port Jackson, but suppose if she hadgonodown-lfmission area and crew had been lost, how dismal would the feelings be of those now present 1 boy lamented over the loss of the first ship, but there had been a messenger of mercy to f ous and in the South Sea Islands, and she went down full of honours at the very 1 loco and time that she ought to have gone He could not help thinking that that she had done her work and they would excuse him for saying that she xi as insured to the full extent of her value (Laughter ) Tv hen the good ship went down her crew and he missionaries-the late venerable Charles Barry, and Mr Hoyle-were saved , only the vessel and the goods she had on board were lest the friends of the society in England sipciiledto the children, and the result was the collection of £14 000, £8000 of which were paid for the new and beautiful ship which they had seen They were called, therefore, to congratulate themselves that the missionaries and the ship vvereBifo They could not but sympathise with their brethren the nut sionanes He deeply appreciated choral and self denial which could givoupbngnt prospects at home to come out here They had left home with those they held wont dear, had risked their lives upon the mighty deep They had devoted themselves to the mission work, to elevate those who were degraded and lost, and perhaps to their dying day they would seldom see the faces of a white man He thanked God that it had been put into their heads to go out to the Islands to teach the Gospel to the heathen The meeting welcomed these brethren warmly as agents of the London Missionary Society As to the catholicity of that Society, and to the great work it was doing, and the agencies it employed, it was perhaps second to none in the great mission field He would have all present to know, that the society was unsectarian, although principally supported, as his Excellency had said, by the Congregational body He thought it was because it was so supported that the others with drew from it and supposed societies of their own. The fundamental principle of the London Missionary Society said - As The union of Christians of x anona denominations, in carry - "is on this great work, is a most desirable object so to prevent, if tremble, any cruise of future dissension, it is declared to be a fundamental ) near le of the Missionary Society, that its design is lotto und Presbyterianism, Independency Episcopacy of another form of Church order and government (about which there may be differences of opinion among serious persons), but the glorious Gospel of the blessed God to the heathen and that it shall be left (at li outfit to be left to the minds of the persons with God may call into the fellowship of his Son from among traced, to assume for themselves such form of Church government as to them el all of pear most agreeable to the W ord of God Some might think that the society gave too great a latitude 1 rue, the 1 card of the society would accept candidates, whether Independents, Presbyterians, or Episcopalians, and send them out as agents, if duly qualified. In proof of that he might say, that some of the missionary brethren present belonged to other bodies than the Cow creational In Protestantism there was a vital union the title, the whole Bible, and nothing but be Rifle was the basis of their religion, and although they differed in minor points, they were agreed on the great doctrines of salvation The London Missionary Society had expended, during the past year, upon the different stations throughout the world upwards of £99 CrO the society had 18a European oulaiEcd sports engaged in the work, and 750 native be every one of the oldest and most successful missions "JiiMbolin The Pacific In the Georgian, Austral, and Society needs the society had 30 churches, 3877 cow municants, 39 juvenile day and boarding schools and educational institutions, and 2371 scholars. In the Hervey Islands there were 0 churches, 2280 communicate 12 schools, and 2100 scholars In the Samoan Islands theieweio42 churches, 4215 communicants 220 schools, and 3519 scholars In the New Hebrides which to prevent local rivalry, as his Excellency had called it, hid in a great measure been given up to the Fresh (enan mission, there were 2 churches, 150 communicants 60 schools, and 2000 children under education In the Loyalty Islands there were To churches, 1215 conimum ants, JG schools, and 1070 scholars On Savage Island there was 1 church, 819 com- municants, 15 schools and 2013 children under education making a total of 105 churches, 12.55 communicants, £11 schools, and 20,773 children, who were enjoying the blessings of education These statistics would give some idea of the work that had been done by the society in the Pacific The meeting would permit him to read an extract from Llhs's Polynesian Researches, first volume, as to the state of some of these Islanders before the introduction of Christianity - (Izon has long been a place of celebrity, not only in France, but throughout the whole of the Society Islands It n is the literal t r) land of the reigning family, and the usual residence of the king and his household But the most remarkable object connected with Open, lies the large name, or temple, where the national idol was worshipped, and human victims sacrificed These offerings were not only brought from the districts of limited and the adjacent islands but also from the windward group, and even from the more distant islands to the south and south coast The worship of Oro, in the marne here, appears to have been of the most sanguinary kind, human immolation was frequent, and in addition to the bones and other relics of the former sacrifices, now scattered among the ruins of the temple, there is still a large enclosure, the walls of which are formed entirely of human so all the horrid piles of skulls, in their various stages of decay, exhibit a most ghastly and effecting spectacle They are principally, if not entirely, the skulls of those who have been slain in battle Now, he would ask them to listen to a description of some of the funeral rites of these people - AlinoBteverv native custom connected with the death of relatives or friends, was singular, unit none perhaps more so thin the one! an, which, though not confined to instances of death was then most violent It consisted in the most frantic expressions of grief, under which individuals acted as if bereft of reason It commenced when the sick person appeared to be dying, the w ailing then was often most distressing, but as soon as the: spirit had in inn ted, the individuals became quite ungovernable They not only failed in the loudest and most affecting tone, but for their hair, cut their garments, and cut themselves with shark's teeth or knives in a most shocking manner The instru n cut usually employed was a small cane about four inches long, with five or six sharks' teeth fixed in, on opposite sides Willi one of these instruments every female provided herself after may liuLC, and on occasions of death it was unsparingly used With some this was not sufficient, they prepared a short instrument, something like a plumber's market, about five or six inches le ng, rounded at one end for a handle, and armed with two or three rows of sharks teeth fixed In the wood, at the other With this, on the death of a relative or friend, the) cut themselves unmercifully, sit Taking the head, simples, check, and breast, till the blood flowed profusely from the wounds At the same time they uttered the most deafening and agonising cries, and the distortion of their countenances, their torn and dishevelled hair, the mingled tens and blood that covered their bodies, their wild gestures and unruly conduct, often gave them a frightful and almost inhuman appearance This cruelty was principally performed by the females, but not by them only, the men committed on these occasions the same enormities, and not only cut the niches, but came armed with clubs and other deadly weapons If they read of the change that had now taken place of the examination of the schools-of the proficiency of the children-of Ihu speeches of the chew, they would say that the cruel places had been exonerated and the wilderness had been made to blossom as the rose For this the resolution expressed thanks to God And how had this change been wrought t Simply through faith in the creed of the great missionary, who and "I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, which is the power of God unto salvation unto everyone that believeth to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile The missionaries gave themselves to the work, and translated the Scriptures in order that these people might have them for ever He might read from the report of the Bible Society as to the sale of Bibles to the natives of these splints In several of these groups of islands the agents of the London Missionary Society had translated the Scriptures into the language of the people One of the host of this of translations was by the father of missions in the South S cap, and a companion, whom he thanked God was with them to-night in the person of the Rev. Charles Pitman (Cheers ) A copy of one of these Bibles, translated into the language of the Hervey Islanders, he now held in his hand, and in (your paper, and printing and he believed as a translation-for the critics of the Bible Society spoke of it in high terms of commendation it was fit to present to her Majesty the Queen (Applause) that book was a proof of the toil which their missionaries had undergone in Irving to civilise and Christianise the heathen We had hold of the grand secret of the loved son of those islanders - of (ho ann that could turn the lion inte- a lamb, when they had the Word of God Secular philanthropy might attempt this work, but it would be in vain Secular philanthropy occupied its time in writing at home, but it did not go abroad among the heathen und grapple with the evil This, as, has Jbvxcollenc} had remarked, was no experiment They were not entering upon an untried campaign It had been well begin nua in to try tears half done in the Navigator a, Society and Hervey Islands, and mother groups there was not the trace of an idea to be found, and the children know not the man as of the idols whom their fathers worshipped lbs, they thanked God, had been accomplished by their Its fur aries, and those of the Wesleyan, Presbyterian and Li reception brethren They rejoiced in the work that had been done, and thanked God for it. He hoped it would stimulate the people of Sydney to engage more heartily in this good and glorious work (Applause) 'The Rev A ivi TIIOMSOV rose to second the resolution He ford that having been informed that his friend Mr Graham was to move the resolution, he was well aware that there would be little occasion for him to say much in second ing it And, indeed, it was always pleasant to himself when his duty was little more than that of a listener, he only wished that every duty came as naturally to him as the duty -at least a public meeting of being swift to hear and slow to speak " At the fame time, he must ever esteem it a privilege to be allowed to lift up his voice, how ever humble, on behalf of the London Missionary Society (Applause) There was no missionary society) throughout the v ear Iel more thoroughly catholic in its constitution and operations It took its rise in the great impulse given to the proposal of the Gospel towards the close of the last century, and at that time when Churches, as such were str lately unprepared to take part in the glorious work, it rallied round its standard some of the best men of all communions, more especially of the Episcopalian, Presbyterian, and Congregational The venerable forms of one or two of its founders rose before him in c election w ah his earliest recollections, and the names of others of them had been familiar to him from his childhood as household words from the happy change which had taken place in more recent times, in the wide spread sense of obligation in relation to the evangelisation of the world, those denominations, like the Episcopalian, the Presbyterian, and the Wesleyan, which had a common ecclesiastical organisation through which to act, had got miss ions of their own, and the London Missionary Society had come to be mainly supported by the Congregationalists, among whom it had served as a bond of Onion, more powerful perhaps than ecclesiastical view (Applause ) But its catholic constitution remained, and its board of direction and staff of agents were still open to all who loved our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, It was on this ground that notwithstanding disloyalty to his own denomination, and no one he hoped would suspect him of treason to it there was a higher loyalty which constrained him with peculiar warmth to bid God speed to this noble society (Applause ) And now coming to the resolution which it was his business to second, he rejoiced in seeing among us anew band of missionaries and so promising a band sent out by the society for the prosecution of its work in the neighbouring islands of the Pacific He was sure that this meeting united in thanksgiving to Him who rides in the whirlwind and commands the storm, that when in their passage from England in the new mission ship (which, though new still bore the old and honoured name of John V illmms), they were overtaken by the same hurricane which sent Each desolation to so many hearts and homes in Australia by the wreck of the London They were mercifully preserved, and were now safely here, ready to proceed to the Islands with their message of mercy. (Applause) The islands of the South Pacific were the first scene of the society's operations. Their, then recent discovery, followed by the melancholy fate of Captain Cook through the cruelty of the buchanan inhabitants of one of them, drew the eyes and hearts of the founders of the London Missionary Society to these islands, and the ship Duff proceeded to Otaheite freighted with missionaries For many weary years those Christian pioneers laboured with no apparent success. He had often heard his late father tell of having been present at a meeting of the directors of the society, when so discouraging were the accounts received from the missionaries that it was all but resolved to withdraw the motion and transfer it to some other sphere of labour. The great and good Dr. How co-author of the well-known commentary on the Bible which bore his name, and one of the brightest ornaments of his time of the Church of England, and one of the founders of this Bociety-ploidod hard for a further trial His pleading prevailed , but at that very time, though the directors knew it not, the tidings were near the shores of England, and his (Mr Thompson's) father had scarcely got home to Scotland when he heard them-tidings which compelled all to exclaim, " What hath God wrought ' ' His king and many of his people had turned to the Lord Their idols had been cast to the moles and to the bats and it seemed as if a nation had been " born in a day " Subsequent events proved the charge to be real and over since, the island after another had been the scene of the tnuaipliB of the G >>-p->l The darkness had been chased away before the light of Divine truth the name of Jesus had been a ointment poured forth on the wounds if what in those in lads was literally our bit crime; humanity and the habitations of horrid cruelty had been turned into the dwellings of pence. Our youthful brethren, therefore, who were among us on their way to the islands on the grand enterprise of proclaiming the Gospel of Christ, might well go forth with all confidence, assured that the Gospel was still, as of old, the power of God unto salvation, and that He who hath said to his servants, "Lo, I am with you alias," cannot deny himself The cb ago which had been accomplished by the Gods, and the grace of God accompanying it, in some of the islands of the Pacific, the Gospel. by the same price was equal to accomplish in all of them. But why did he Bonds of the change brought about in these recently barbarous islands is to what did England owes her present state of civ 174 titanic all which made her greatest what but to the Gospel?

Could he suppress his instinctive yearning, or limit the executive tendencies of tboEC elemental forces of his nature, or could be locnliBO then activity, and not suffer in his own soul? He held that he could not Neither could the Christian Church as a whole nor could any part of it. Christians, then, in their individual and corporate capacities must be missionaries in order to rise to the greatness and grandeur of their calling, and to deal fairly by the Gospel with which they were charged for themselves and for c this Their attitude, to be in harmony with the extent of the atonement and the boundless love which breathed in it, must be missionary Standing at the foot of the Cross, and deriving their inspiration from Him who died thereon, city must be missionaries their faith, their hope, their love, feeding and living on His grand sacrifice, and carrying it abroad or wherever it was needed, as the only panacea of human woe, must make them missionary We all knew that men were modelled by their master cause, shaped by their ruling passion, that they were Diond or grovelling, according to the nature of the object on which they were intent, that they grow to their aim, and the moral size was proportioned to its measure CbiiBtmn men were enlarged according to the magnitude and the worth of their heavenly purpose, and in they were to be brought up to the fulness of the stature of men in Christ Jesus, and to stand forth in all their possible moral might with every element of strength and progress, if they were to be pure, great, good, magnanimous, and majestic as they ought and might become they must be missionary in spirit Strip that attribute from the character, and you divested them of their chief glory, if you did not demolish the very idea of their Christianity (Applause) It was to the Church imbued with such a spirit as this that Christ had said Go ye into all the world disciples all nations Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world " the promise was not to the Church absolutely and un- conditionally , not to the Church doing what it pleased, and seeking what end she proposed to herself, that the promise was given No, but it was to the Church doing her Divine Master's will and executing His command that the premise was addressed Let them suppose that the Church, instead of going and discipline all nations, was content with occupying, strengthening, and beautifying the petition in the world which she had already acquired, with rendering herself more dignified and august in the estimation of the world, is the limited sphere to which her existence has as yet been confined let them imagine (that the Church were to conclude that she had already preached the Gospel far enough, and to determine that, while cultivating her own ground, she would leave the details their deflation-ai- surcdly the promise of the Master's presence in the power and energy of the Holy Spirit, was not for such is Church the promise was not for the self ticking, Eelf 1 rifying, self saving Church, nor to the bone abidinB Church but to the Church that spreads herself abroad and take the glory of the Redeemer, the extension of his kingdom and the salvation of immortal souls (Apphuto) Let the Church be thus dispositioned and prepared and then, having the standard of Christ crucified uplifted, would not advance to the conflict which went to overwhelm the Prince of Darkness , the might she Tiny with a certainty of receiving a baptism of the Holy Ghost Rom on Inch which should spread success on every h and advancing and advancing until the knowledge of the Lord like a sea of glory shall cover the of fresh (Applause ) The resolution was then put from the chair and unanimously agreed to. The Rev J P SUVDPHT VB moved the second m s Intun - ' That this meeting fully recognises the claims if the South Sea Missions upon the united exertions, s worthies, and pray one of the Churches of England and Australia, and, considering how much remains to be done, vi mild urge the necessity of unwearied efforts for the entire evangelisation of the various groups open to Christian labour Much had been said this evening to show the claims of the South Sea missions upon the Churches of Australia The British Churches had already recognised the claims of these missions in the liberal and hearty supPort which they had hitherto given to them. The Churches in England did not wish to withdraw from supporting those missions, but looking at the wide claims of the world, they turned to the Churches in Australia and they asked us in all love and affection whether we could not do more for (his mission, in order that the Churches of the mother country might turn to the wider fields of India, China, and Africa We had no desire to be separated from our father- land, and we felt an interest is all that concerned its great- ness and glory It was so with regard to its missionary operations If it should come to pass that the Churches of Australia should raise all the money necessary in to carry on the missions in the Pacific, we should still wish to maintain our connection with the parent society Other societies were entered upon this great work, and we rejoiced in their success (Applause ) Our Wesleyan brethren spent about £16 000 annually in support of missions in the South Sea Islands, and the agents of the London Missionary Society were sustained at a cost of nearly £10 000 the contribution of the Australian Churches to the London Missionary Society would not average more than £2000 a year, and this surely was too small a sum looking at the possibility of taking up increased work He presumed that the meeting to night was for the purpose of stirring up their minds by way of remembrance, and he hoped all who felt an interest in our work would seriously look to their individual obligations, and see whether they could not contribute to a larger extent to the society than hitherto "We re counted the claims of these questions because they were so near to us In New South Wales there were many opportunities afforded of testing the reports from the mission stations, and we were glad to find that those reports were fully confirmed by gentlemen in her Majesty's service, who bore testimony to the great work of amelioration that had been accomplished No one could possibly exaggerate the importance of the work, for many thousands had been converted Islanders who a few years ago, were destitute of any literature, and had no language reduced to writing now, thousands of them, had the precious Book of Life in their hands and it was their guide, their consolation, and hope Our young missionary brethren who were now going forth would find their reward in their work as they beheld the influence of Divine truth on the hearts of the people and the conversion of sinners It was astonishing how missionary work elevated man in the social scale The best way to promote civilisation vans to bring men to the knowledge of Christ, for the graces of life and the useful arts would come in the train of the Gospel (Applause) There were at the present time about ten European missionaries in Sydney, and very shortly they would be on their way to the South Seas But what were these ten, or what were the twenty-eight agents supported by the London Missionary Society in the South Seas, when compared with the vast regions not yet on cupted i We rejoiced in the exertions of Bishop Patteson -(applause) and in the labours of our American brethren north of the line, but there was still an ample field for all and the groups of islands were so situated that every Church feeling a Divine impulse to go forth and preach the Gospel might take up their own sphere and work out their own IC'COB of Christian truth without hindrance from others He hoped that the time would be very far distant when the Christian Church would waste time and effort in useless rivalry He rejoiced to see a meeting like this, and he sincerely believed that the time was coming when all the Christians of Austr he would not only be doing their own work around them, but would send forth a B1 ill larger force to the islands of the South Seas the Rev John Geddie, who was not present haddrae a noble work in those islands by his unw e aned exer 6 ins and no person but himself knew the toils and dangers which he had gone through He would, therefore conclude his address in. crdorthatMr Geddie who had b me the best murders of the day in light have an opportunity of saying a few words to the meeting (Apply line The Rev Jo! v G purni said that it gave him unox rected pleasure to see so large a meeting as the present test fying to great a degree of interest in the nu canary cause He should now give him some inform him about the field of war our where his lot had been east for many years, and in doing to he should be as hue'' as posblo The New Hebrides was a large and important group of islands about thirty in number of various M/CS - and all, b is. large and an evil, inhabited by a deeply degraded branch of the human race The j population of the islands was about 30,000, aid n ott if these people were still in dukes s and the shadow of death There is! more pre entered a most lovely appearence, and were among the most favoured spots of God's creation. The first missionary who had called attention to these islands was the late lamented John Williams, of the London Missionary Society (AjplnuEc) That good man could not be confined to the b[ hero of 1 labour in which his lot had first been cast as n rr missionary, but he had applied for a ship, and received thee no in which he made his first and, alas ' his last voyage to New Hebrides John Williams fell a martyr on the third e t Erromanga The next effort to introduce the Gospel into these islands was made in the year 1812, when the Revs Messrs Turner and Nisbet took up their abode on the island of Tanna Those missionaries commenced their labours with encouraging prospects, but after two months a fatal disease broke out among the natives, who blamed the missionaries for it, and they were obliged to flee for their lives The last effort had been, made in the you 1848 In that year he (Mr Geddie) and his companions had gone to those islands They had previously applied to the London Missionary Society, who had recommended them to commence 'their labours at the island of Aneiteum The society had expired its readiness to transfer its interest in those islands to them, so soon as they were in circumstances which would admit of them occupying them. He was glad to have such an opportunity as this of acknowledging the deep debt of obligation that the missionaries were under- to the London Missionary Society (Applause ) He should now give some account of the state in which they had found the islanders of Aneiteum when they first arrived at that place Human nature then appeared there in it Most repulsive forms The savages were repulsive of in their external appearance. The males were naked Their faces were painted, sometimes of different colours, each one seeking his own taste in that respect Their hair was long , their oars- were pierced, and in them they were large tortoiseshell rings They were great smokers, and it was not, uncommon to see a native going about with a fig of tobacco stuck through one ear, and a pipe through the other (Laughter) They carried spears and other weapons with them The women were a girdle round their waist, and that was the only covering They were, if possible, worse than the males, and was of in a much more miserable and degraded state It was considered disgraceful for a man to be seen even eating with his ora wife All the hard labour devolved upon them, and so wretched were they that not uncommonly they were driven to put an end to their own existence These savages were, indeed, dark hearted creatures who knew little about this world, and still less about the world to come They certainly had a religion of their own they worshipped the sun and the moon, they worshipped a variety of Epmts which they supposed to be endued with supernatural powers, they treated their chiefs with venera- tion during life, and worshipped them after death They had no theory of animation, as we have, and it was only when they wanted some favour from their beds that they supplicated them It was also customary with these islanders to present human sacrifices to their daily Whenever disease or some other calamity prevailed on the island, it was the right that the gods were angry with the people, and that some expensive offering should be given to propitiate them. The priests consulted together, and Usually decreed that a human being must be offered up Some person was then selected and sacrificed to appease their deity. Their gods were objects of terror to them , hero were objects of love And he might say a word or two about the cruelty of the crimes that prevailed among the people War was the rule , peace was the exception They were of people hateful and hating one another They were cannibals, and friends as well as enemies were fro quently the victims of that horrid practice. Infanticide was of common occurrence, and when parents did not wish to ring up their children, they did not hesitate to expose them to death Every woman after marriage were an ornamental cord round her neck, and that became the instrument of her death, for as soon as her husband died the cord was drawn light in order that she might accompany him to the land of spirits If a man had a dozen wives they were all treated in the same way, and the game was usually perpetrated by a near relative of the victim He could mention other crimes, but respect for the feelings of his audience 8 impelled him to draw a veil over them Those who heard him would however, see from the description just given, hovvfalpo were the pictures sometimes drawn of the happy social state of the heathen Persons who spoke such things knew as much about the heathen as the heathen knew about them Those heathen who had no knowledge of the Bible had nothing but misery in this world, and the prospect of misery in the world to come. These were the people among whom his lot had been cast When his companions and himself first landed on the island they were received by the savages with coldness, suspicion, and distrust borne sup posed that the missionaries were outcasts from their own country, who had come to the act and to seek a home. Others imagined that they wanted to take possession of the country When the missionaries looked around them, they were almost tempted to despair Their first effort was to learn the language of the people, and that was not an easy task The savages had no letters, and when they saw the strangers reading books, they imagined that intercourse was thus held with some spirit, and the book was regarded with so much suspicion that many of the natives refused to sleep in a house in which there was a book. (Laughter ) After the missionaries had acquired as much of the language as enabled them to explain the simple truths of the Gowra I, they began to teach the savages as they found opportunities for so doing Sometimes they did to by the I Brookside, sometimes by the fireside, sometimes under the shadow of the leafy trees, and sometimes in the islanders own houses "borne would listen, Some would mock, mel others would perhaps turn away in anger from their teachers What were the means employed in the moral and religious elevation of those people of Simple indeed' The missionaries told them of their sins, and entreated them to flee to Christ from the wrath to come This was the means employed, and this means God had been pleased to bless to a considerable extent. He might now mention that the Sun of Righteousness had begun to arise in those islands, with healing in his wings Every idol there had been either given up to the missionaries to destroyed by the islanders themselves (Applause) Every sacred grove had been cut down There savages, that a few years ago were asked pagans, were now clothes, and many of them sat at the feet of Jesus, in their light mind (Applause) These people who at one time could not read a book, written in their own tongue who wore even afraid of a book-now possessed the whole of the New Testament, and a great portion of the Old and were able to road of the works of God. (Applause) Their Sundays were spent in the exercise of religion Family worship was a general practice amongst them, and the voice of prayer and praise was heard among them every morning and evening, from every habitation. He did not say that all these men were true Christians, but he would say that none were regarded such by their countrymen if they lived in the neglect of their religious duties, Their schools were well attended by children of all ages, and, indeed, it was not an uncommon thing to see a parent and child reading out of the same book (Applause ) Then again, great moral change had taken place in the habits of the car i gee, and crimes of any magnitude were now of uncommon occurrence among them They took the Bible as their standard of duty, and endeavoured to mould their conduct by it These men desired to extend the Gospel to others It was their practice to make annual contributions to missionary purposes , they could not contribute money, but they sent arrowroot and such other produce as they had Many of them made a nobler offering than that, and gave themselves to the missionary cause (Applause ) Already between thirty and forty had gone from the island of Aneiteum, and of that number two had already fallen in the cause of Christ, but there were others ready to take their places. (ADDUUOO) Suchwasabnef history of that work on the Eastern Seas Time would not permit him to give a description of the progress made in other islands, but he would just say that he thanked God for the triumphs of the cause of Christ among those heathen. "AA e should thank Him for what He had done through the instrumentality of the American missions, the missions among the Sandwich Islands and ot hare (Applause) People who a century ago were savages now took their price among Christians and the civilised nations of the earth (Applause) Our Wesleyan brethren were labour mg in the secrets, their chosen held of labour, and they had induced more than 70,000 to embrace the Christian faith (Applause ) Those present were acquainted to some extent with the achievements of the London Missionary Society, in the islands of the Pacific, where the Word of God was now read in many different languages He should like to speak of the or orations of the Bishop of New Zealand, whom to know was to love (Applause) He referred to Bishop Selwyn, whose duties now confined him solely to New Zealand, but who had been succeeded among the Islands by Bishop Patteson, a man of kindred spirit In con clusion, he would call upon the meeting to lend their aid to the extension of the Gospel among these islands, and in other portions of the world, that God s way might be known on earth, and His saving health among all nations (Loud applause ). The Rev W J WATSON said that in the latter portion of the last century a famous navigator had reported the discovery of new and strange shores in the Pacific They were inhabited by cruel savages, naked, and degraded to the last point of barbarism He could imagine the Europeans looking upon those savages and asking themselves whether the Ethiopian could change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Others said " Yes," and perhaps added that what was impossible with man was possible with God and consequently they had resolved to attempt reclaiming the savages, and to go out among them with that object At this time there were men who sought to deny the great principle of Christianity, and it was thought that if these i lspionancB could succeed in their efforts, they would have the grandest possible argument against those who desired to retaineth truths of the Bible (Applause) He proceeded to describe the manner in which the missionaries h 11 carried out this scheme, and how their 1 hours had he is, under Prov science, blessed with most gi ratify ing success We must not, however forget that although much had been done much yet remained to be done We must not forget that there. were yet many lands where operations had yet to be commenced It was our duty as Christians to extend the knowledge of the Gospel, and for that we should labour earnestly, and raise up a new urgency, namely, the native teachers The Euro Icun missionaries would go forth to guide them, and would never think there able (Arphuso) Ghtibthadsaid ' Go," and they went, secured in His t romance-" Lo, I am with you, even to the end of the world -' I will never leave slices nor forsake thee, My grace is sufficient for thee the missionaries believed the promises, and knew that the Gospel was the only saving power that could axiom the heathen They would give that Gospel a distinct utterance, for God forbid .hut'hetrumpetsbeuldirivo m under am s land He concluded by rig up iLc duly of perseverance in the good work. is that was to be accomplished, and that had been s J well b gun (Loud cheers ). The Rev. J. CHALMERS briefly commented on the object of the meeting, and urged the expediency of sending men singers to preach the Gospel in the lands which were even now peopled by idolators He hoped the meeting would assist in so glorious a work He adverted to the benefits that the cause had derived from the employment of native teachers, and said that, having received the blessings of the Gospel ourselves, we should be eager to carry those blessings to others The resolution was then put, and carried unanimously, amid great acclamations The Rev, S H DAVIS moved the third resolution " That this meeting acknowledges with thankfulness to the Great Head of the Church the singular success which has attended the labours of native teachers in the various groups of Islands under the superintendence of the European missionaries " He pointed out that the natives were peculiarly fitted for the work of preaching the Gospel among the islands The r powers of physical endurance were greater than those of European missionaries, and their knowledge of the ideas and manners of the people enabled them to communicate religious instruction with greater facility than could Europeans who could not so readily acquire the different languages or speak them with such fluency The speaker cited some instances of the advantage which had resulted from the labours of the native teachers, and he mentioned that a band of eight teachers had gone to the Islands of the Samoan Group some sixteen years ago, and had been instrumental in delivering the barbarous islanders from a condition of utter degradation From the establishment at Samoa for the training of native missionaries one thousand teachers had already gone forth, and their labours had been productive of the most benign and gratifying results The resolution was then put and carried unanimously. Mr J TAIUTAX briefly proposed a vote of thanks to his Excellency the Governor for presiding on the occasion. The Rev. J" GRAHAM, as one of the vice-presidents of the London Missionary Society, took it upon himself to put (the motion proposed by Mr Fairfax, and seconded by all present (Laughter ) He had read that day a sentence extracted from a letter which had been penned by her Ma jtBty the Queen, to the Queen of Madagascar There was no sovereign who ever lived that seized the opportunity of aiding the cause of humanity more than her Majesty Queen Victona-(cheers)-and in the letter she had written to the Queen of Madagascar occurred a sentence, which was like this " Queen Victoria requests, as a personal favour, of the Queen of Madagascar, that there may be no persecution of the Christians in Madagascar" And the reply was " the Queen of Madagascar assures Queen Victoria that there shall be no persecution of the Christians in the island of Madagascar " (Cheers) That great and good man, Prince Albert, was the friend of religious liberty and toleration, and we were delighted to find that these sentiments were so embodied and so impressed by the representative of her Majesty in this colony (Cheers) He asked the meeting to give a vote of thanks to his Excellency for his kindness in presiding over the meeting and to test it he requested that every one present would stand up The audience then rose from their seats, amid loud acclamation, and the vote of thanks was awarded to his Excellency, who briefly expressed his sense of the honour conferred, and his willingness at all times to takopartin proceedings of the same nature as those which had just occupied the attention of the meeting TLo Doxology was then sung, and the Rev J Graham having pronounced the benediction, the proceedings terminated
