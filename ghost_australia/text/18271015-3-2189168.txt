ADDRESSED TO THE MONITOR. A PARODY. Libel's hands, guest dear Long in yonder dome, Shall it shall it rest there Still, find find a home ! Shall it cease to scamper Thro' holy Padre's brain, Like some accursed vampire, All for the love of gain ? shall it still, withouten rest, Like the Sydney Ghost Be to all about a pest Tho's head's run 'gainst a post ? No, his strength's unnerved Jove, See him slink away, His dirty purpose served Jove, Why should he longer stay ? BLUNT.
