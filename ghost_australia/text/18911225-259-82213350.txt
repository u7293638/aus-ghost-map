Tim Ronrding-lloiisc Joint. Euch weary guest is worn to a tjboat; Oh, list to our tale of woe I How we long for A rrst from our landlady's roast, But how she makes it go. Ob, sing me b song of the ]u*cioue ham, That uover our table snos ! But only the limb of au ancient lamb Whose sequences are these: One day hot, and (be next day cold, And the third day " stew" is its name, Aud the fourth day hash, but the same old joint It gets there just lUe eame. The markets firotin with the fatted grouse, The stalls o'orflow with fowl; I sometimes moau for a Chinese mouse Or a slice of looted owl. But ever the shape of the aged sheep On tbo table lies alone, And like funeral crape despair doth creep As the same old rule goes on : One day hot, and the next day sold, And tbo third to " atew" we sloop; And the fourth day bash, and the fifth sad day The bone is in the soup. If only the lamb were bred for the loom, Ana bis flesh was for food tbo coarsa, I'd enro not a darn for tin latnbkin'e doom, No more than the horae-car horso. If the tariff tax would comp'ete its tricks, | And the price to heaven should soar, ' Such a state of facts would our landlady fix, 1 And we nevor would grumble more ; Ono day hot, aud the next day cold, . And the third day greasily stewe<l ; And the fourth day hash-Will it ever reach Innocuous desuetude ?
