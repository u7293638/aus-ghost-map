LANTERN LECTURE. A lantern lecture, organised by the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts, was given in St. George's Hall, Now town, last night. The attendance was very fair, and the lecturer (Mr. Cyril Haviland) was listened to with marked attention. The pictures were shown by means of the large triennial lime-light lantern, of the School of Arts, and was in charge of, and worked by Mr. F. F. Mundy. The lecturer commenced by describing the School of Arts. After this had been finished he went on to show a picture of the present state of Bethlehem. The Coliseum at Rome, the carnival at Christmas time, both by daylight and at night were beautifully exhibited on the canvas. The winter amusement of toboggan in Canada was brought vividly before the minds of those present by an excellent photograph. The state of the Niagara in winter, with its immense boulders of ice and peculiar shapes the frozen water forms in the caves, formed some of the pictures for the evening's amusement. Selections, aptly illustrated, were also given from Gabriel Grub, Marley's Ghost, and the Chimes. A new Christmas burlesque-" Red Riding Hood was the ending of a Very pleasant lecture. _
