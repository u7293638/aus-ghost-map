After listening , awhile lo rap.iog, horn-blowing and gauze vol! inaterhlisiiiiuu, tho bad man arose , and enld : "Say,o ap'o, whar's tho old man's gliost ?" "What old man ?" a?kod tho medium, "My old man, tho governor. Oall blm up," "What i3 his name?" "Tom Boaliok ; oall him up ?" "I don't think that we aro in commnuicfclon with him to-night ?"
