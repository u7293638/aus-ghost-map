To the Editor of the Port Phillip Gazette. SIR, — I wish to give ye some remarks about the colony, in which I arrived some time ago. "Heigh sirs," but ye must be sair annoyed to hear o' my comin sae far awa' frae the auld house of Dumbiedikes ; gude guide us, but an the auld laird my feather had but thought I would have been sae foolish as to be daidling out at the antipodes, he would have nae peace in his grave. I min' well enough the day he died he said to me, jist as lawyer Novit was drawing up the the tesmant an' puttin' the writin's a' right— "Jock," says he, " when ye hae nathing else to do, ye may be aye stickin' in a tree, it will be growing, Jock, when ye're sleeping. Jock, ne'er drink brandy in the mornin', it files the stamach sair; and Jock, dinna be fleein' aff to Ame- rica or any of the newfangled outlandish kintras, but stay at hame, and min' the auld place." The puir auld man was sair put to with Mass John and the Doctor, and auld Nichil Novit, but he's gane to his ac- count, the puir auld man. Well, you maun ken, Maister Editor, that a year or twa syne the lady took an inflammation and gave up the ghost in the dead room, as auld curate Kiltstoup used to say, and I had a vast lot o' spare time, and ye maun ken weel enough I thought lang. Douce Davie Deans has been gane awa' frae St. Leonard Craigs this mony a day, gude guide us, and instead of his dochter there is an auld jade of a houdie lives there, that took off my laced hat and threw it into the sharn, and brake my to- bacco pipe, de'il burst her. I had naething to do, and I determined to come off to this kintra like my auld friend Mr. Hood, and maybe write a buke upon it. After mony mishaps, and being nearly drooned twice, I came to Port Phillip, and a braw port it is faith an' a braw kintra. Weel you see I have been walkin' about takin' notes, as that unco carle Robie Burns said, and whiles bidin' in the town, and whiles in the kintra ; and gye an' gleg I have been, I can tell you, in taking the bit and the sup ; and hearing that ye was born in the land o' cakes, I thought o' tryin' my hand at the pen, to see gin I could write a buke when I see the auld place of Dumbiedykes again ; and gin ever you happen to be near it, jist step in, and ye'll get plenty o' meat, and maybe a drap whisky punch, which, as the auld laird used to say, " Jock, dinna drink brandy, it sits cauld on the stomach — try the whisky punch laddie." I think ye hae a fine kintra here, and almost as gude land as my ain at Dumbie- dykes, but oh man, ye hae a wheen discon- tented chaps here. I understand they pay but a sma' rent for their grass, hardly a bodle for a gude braid Scotch acre, but they mak' an unco clatter about it, a'most as muckle as auld widow Butler and her oe made when about to be turned out of Beer- sheba. I wonder the Governor does not take their tacks frae them, for troth an I had them at Dumbiedykes I would teach them to gang about the kintra, ranting and routing like stickit calves, de'il burst them. They put me in min' o' a drunken auld body who had been an exciseman, but was put out for taking siller and letting the Government be cheated. Geordie Christe was his name; he was a horse- couper at the time he died. Well, he used to hae a lang string o' words about reform bills and votes by ballot, and a republican government, and God knows what other Whiggery besides ; and he was aye for hav- ing what is called a demonstration, but I sent him awa wi' a flee in his lug, I can tell ye, and de'il a step he ever came near Dumbiedykes after. The men wha cry out aginst the Government at home are aye broken down creatures wha hae nathing to lose, and the carles here are much in the same predicament. The Government should bring them to their senses, for nae tenant o' mine should misca' me to my face. There is to be a squad o' settlers, I think they ca' themselves, this morning, and a lot o' nonsense maun be spoken, and lots o' gude drink wasted, and that to nae earthly purpose. Was there ever sic a lot o' fules ? But auld Dumbiedykes will be there, and report the speeches. Yours, &c.;, JOHN DUMBIE. Melbourne, 25th May, 1844.
