The first performance of "Lady Dolly" attract-; ed a.large crowd bf fashionable people to the Pal race Theatre on March. 31. Mrs. Robert- Brough' ..and. Miss Emma. Temple roccupied- a box, while' among the many, present ..were Mr. and Mrs.? iTeece, Mr. and Mrs.: and Miss/Whiting, Dr. and, ""Mrs. Kendall," Mrs. Boesen, Dr. and Mrs. Hankins,; -, "Mrs. Adams (Melbourne), Mrs. and Miss Jackson;. Sirs. Kenna dud Miss. Riley, -Mrs. Sheridan, Mr.; and Mrs. Russell, Mrs.-and Miss Cohen, and Mr.? ¡Goring Thomas. The dresses worn on thc stage .',"were extremely - handsomer 'especially'i the fancy, costumes in the second, act by the performers^ of froth ' sexes.! ~ Miss Hetty Holroyd wore a very] chic costume of pâle pink in the first act, made ¡with the new tucked skirt,' and; in the- second a irich whited brocade was- made in >Empire style.; .Miss Caldwell wore white muslin and-lace-with a pretty white toque in the beginning of tho first 'act, while the.robe de nuit/ in which "she perso-'; »ates the ghost of her dead ^ancestress, was an ' ^exquisite garment of filmy white chiffon, the.yoke embroidered .with .silver .sequins reflecting a ghostly glimmer of unearthly brightness under i Jhe limelight. ' v v.. :| ' Things'are indeed, coming to a sad pass as far: as the prospects of amusement for the "young folks are concerned, and the poor "girls whom Tommy's: left behind him": may well look forward with dis-, .onay to. the approaching" season. It . seems as if .the war" were producing more melancholy results at home than on the field, where we hear that our. ^gallant'>soldiers wisely, fill up the intervals-, of {waiting and suspense'by.racing tournaments and tether forms of entertainment. ??? Surely our sol diers would be, better pleased if they knew thai: jtheir wives and daughters allowed themselves; a (little innocent-recreation ..during their'absence! [No doubt it requires a little-- self-control and. 'even self-denial * on . the > part of'i those "whose loved i 'ones - , are, in , peril ito join cheerfully in any; little efforts that! ïmay-be made:* to^içcrease the general happiness,: ¡but no doubt there arèibthers' who, with no'per-;| ¡sonal, cause for grief o'r^üneasiness, are glad of the excuse to* be"saved; the. trouble anti expense of j ¡entertaining. . : . - . . . - . . But it seems to me toncóme hard on the girls to forfeit their fun. Youth and: vivacity are -fleet ing possessions, and now is. the time for them to store up pleasant memories of the days when they | iwere young and free from care. If only-two or three > mothers . with grown-up daugh ters would . take the . . trouble to form a "sort of. commtttée,. and persuade their friends, married . and. single, to inaugurate, a series of;smalLsuh'script'lori^dances, to take,place, pay once à\;fortnight, a-considerable amount,of lenjoyment could . be: secured1 at very^ small "ex pense. . For my part, I can't-see why all the char ity in ^'the world should be concentrated on the membérs of one class, and if a p'rofit can be made . on "charity balls by the selling of tickets at half a guinea,-one^would imagine that at half the ? ¡price all expenses could be paid. If there really, is a scarcity of-dancing men, private theatricals," tableaux vivants, or even impromptu charades or tround games might forin the staple of the enter tainment, and at worst an occasional ".musical iparty" might be sandwiched in between the live lier forms of amusement; The Americans arö cer tainly far ahead of us in the .matter of novelties, "and have introduced, besides:'the ''book teas," fwhich were rapidly -worked to death, in Sydney, a dumber of original entertainments on somewhat the same lines. Anyway, I offer this* suggestion for what it is worth to my .town and country (readers, and shall be glad if they can propose any ¡modifications or additions thereto, as a remedy ifor what our "financial:, friends might be tempted to call "a slump in'sociability.'"'v. . . ???»??'?-??? ? ??. - ? ? 4What society would do without the theatres at the present moment it is hard to guess; indeed, ""they seem to provide the only form of amusement tfor all classes just at: present.
