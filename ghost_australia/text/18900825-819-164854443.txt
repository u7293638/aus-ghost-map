HINTS TO DROVERS. A correspondent of the Queenslander writes:â€”"I have been much interested in the letters by drovers and their ex- periences with barbed wire, bells hung on cotton, &c.; May I ask you to in- sert this letter as another hint? When I was droving for many years from Queensland to Victoria I had a horse that showed great sagacity when watching at night. Being a very quiet horse, when the cattle were all camped I used to get off and let him feed quietly round him and turn him in; if the bullock would not go back he would turn round and kick him. By dint of patience and perseverance I at last got this horse to such a state of perfection that he would watch cattle for many hours. He was well known to many drovers along the road by the name of 'The Ghost.' One night when 'The Ghost' was watching I was awakened by a noise amongst the cattle, but hearing noth- ing more, I again went to sleep. In the morning when taking the cattle off the camp I found the dead body of a strange bullock which had not been amongst the cattle when I put them on camp the previous evening. 'The Ghost' had evidently tried to cut him out, and being unable to do so had kicked him on the head and killed him. I believe that many horses if taken in hand when young and patiently taught could be got to be quite as perfect as 'The Ghost.'"
