8LOWGROVB S HSNDICiP. 1 Mr. W. Slowgrove's NTiaeteanth Star Han dicap. wbioh vas rr:: u the Tennyson trao .s last Fri'tay, was wUn- mngh bs pronounced a great success. The day was beautiful, and as a result the attendance was gosd. Mr. J. Murtongh, iu ooEjunotioa with the promoter, aoted an judgo, and although ho was repeatedly called npon to dooide some very clote finiahoB, his vordiab was not ouae que 3- i tioned. Daring my long oxperienoe of amateur | and professional running, extending ova* a period of twolvo years, I mmt say that during that time I hsw-navor witnessed bettor running for an afternoon ; and thi3 was tbe opinion expressed by the spectators. With a few exceptions every heat was in itself a final, tho winners getting home jost on tho tape, wbiloahalf-n yard .vould have covered the whole four oompating. I would strongly advise our metropolitan handiijappers to visic these runni.-g grounds if thoy wont to produce a pood odjustmoat, for thoy will soo more gennino running at a minor mooting for £50.thau thoy will on the larger grounda fcr a wholo twelve month?, and where bigger prizes do net seem to be any inducement and make them run. A better foundation for the framing of a good handioap oonld n)t be wished for than waa seen at Tennyson, and from tho notes takon by tho MarriokviUe Railway handiaapper, who was present and looked deeply interested ia the raoing, I ex i poot to havo to record some brilliant running on tho opening day. ' As will be seen the times in every instance ate snrpriBingly fast in tho first and aeoind divisions, bnt thiB is easily aooounted for. First of all thero was a very strong Wind behind tho men, and add to this the watoh used by tho timekeeper was, when tested with another, found to be rat hor slow. A different watoh wasuBsdintho third division, . and the times then taken was moro aoouroto. , The first four to opsn play wero Joe Morris 104yds, J. J. Lynoh llydB, E Cameron 184yds, and L. Hops.
