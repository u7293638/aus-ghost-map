Chapter XXXI.—f Continued.). " Would you kindly put, out: tue lamp,: Alias Gray,3' he said, "The one on the table--.

I may .have been a moment or - two before I managed it. Nell was standing.' by her chair watching me.,-We heard him ; say— ' "Sit down, my angel, and rest. . I will wait> upon you." We exchanged looks expressive of2 our feelings. . . ^ . i- -' '..' ■ I lifted the lamp and- carried it over, to the/ sideboard. At the same moment the servant f, entered and commenced to. clear away, the j supper things, Dr. Langrishe. addressed me 5 from the window. • 0 ..■> "You will take some coffee, Miss .Gray,-, won't you—and Miss Nugent,^too?" Nell and I loved coffee. Wo accepted the"3 offer and went over to the window; He handed/ us each a cup, asked if we-took it. " au Jait" orri black, and took a cup himself with a liqueur of S cognac in it. _ ' All the time he talked incessantly. :; Nell/ was standing half in, half out of the window,, her cup in her hand. She seemed to be gazing,;, out at the belt -of woods and the gleam of ! moonlit sea. Twos near her. I had begun to drink the coffee and-'finished it quickly. It. wasn't as good as I had hoped,' but it was -' •better than the hospital stuff. Nell had, I think, only sipped a small portion of hers. .If don't know what made me notice that she bad, a white cup—mine had a, pattern, on.it. l I. glanced at Mrs. Langrishe's-to see if hers was , the same. It. was a pink one with a; gold/ border at the top. It .struck me as odd that; . where all the appointments were so excellent, ; there should have been such an unmatched ser- !; vice sent in with coffee, but it was no concern; of mine, and the thought was dismissed.almost / as soon as I entertained it. _ It was probably. " the servant's fault. - - ; ; ; ; . - ■ . . My eyes turned again to the lovely view.It/ seemed less distinct than it bad been. ;Asort. of ; haza -seemed creeping" between; the -:wood / and the sea, and yet the moon was bright a3 ever. /'■Nell—" I said suddenly.- - ' - , . ■ - My voice was drowned in a cry from her. • I; saw her start and the cup • fell from her band, and lay.in a hundred fragments at her feet. "Debbie,"she cried, "Lookat that woman, . look ! Oh ! what an awful face !"• I was through the window: and besidejher in ■> a moment. . She was trembling;-violently. -I { saw:a figure standing opposite the houseln full'; view of the windows.. -A shawl- was drawn / about its head.' - The face looked.straight at ! us and the full:moon revealed it with startling-i distinctness. .1 knew, it in a moment!-;The/ same woman, the same face. I had. seen at the foot_:of Dead Woman's Hill. At Nell's excla mation, at my- movements, James . iiangrisha J; had also come forward.; v . - . r "What is it? What are you staring,at?" he / asked. " Who"is there?" "Can't you see anyone?" I asked. ( "A '.woman.-:, -Look, she is -leaning against, the. iron v. railings beypnd the grass slope." . "I can see nothing,"- he' said angrily. iWhat'cursed folly is this?" Mrs.; Langrishe had also risen and come for- •: ward. " But .; there .-is - a - woman there, ' James, dearest,". she :said.. "Can't you'-see her? ': Loot, -she is comingforwards.-' - She'waves her - hah^l.. -Oh,: 'Jim I 'her -face. It is no living ' ■' face. ' .It' 13. a'de'ad' woman's face.- My God, and she signs to me !" - ( And with a wild, terrified-shriek she'sank down, insensible, into Nell's outstretched arms. In a moment all was confusion. With a savage oath James Langrishe took his wife's ^ uncohscious form frbmNell's weak eupportand laid her on the.leather, couch. • I-dashed water i over her , face- and Nell ran upstairs for the smelling salts.: ' V : - * ' ■ The Irish servant meanwhile: kept up■ a -. running commentary of ejaculations, and re- , marks and declared it was " gettin' beyant the beyants.the way things was.: Am -no dacmt • crature could slape in.peace', thtin. times.- An' shure, wasn't it well' beknown. everywhere:-: who'twas that walked; an' hadn't scores of.-; people seen her, an' if 'twas here she was now minded to come, shure,' Bridget Lehane wasn't gom' to stay in the place. - No, not for. double the wages anyone might offer her." Her master cut-her short with an oath.;,- . ; ' " What nonsense are you talking woman?" , he exclaimed. "Get out of the room. Iwanft: none of your, infernal jabber going on here. ; The girl fled. As the door closed I looked at him. • " What she rsays is 'true," I; said in: a low voice.- ; " That was no living woman; we ;saw. ., I-have good reason to know." . " You ?" he said, and bis livid face gave me a shock, as ,for a second's space I saw written bh.iOhe One unmistakable sign of fear. "was my answer.- "I nursed that • woman in. the fever ■ ward of ;the hospital. I;v saw her die.,: ;And yet I have ,seen her.here, twice. The first time was at the foot of Dead Woman's Hill." - " ■ • . - His eyes fell. I saw the ghastly color creep over his very lips till his face looked like a grey mask. Then into it flashed, a Bay age desperation. ' J In that moment I think some evil deed .first - drew, its birth-breath. In that moment the soul of James Langrishe defied-death or hell " to turn it from its purpose. It was some moments, before Mrs. Langrishe ; regained consciousness. -Then she opened her eyes ' and sat up, and asked the usual -foolish questions. , 1 left Nell to answer her/ I was myself unnerved-and -np3et and ; my ; head began to aehe in a feverisli unaccount - able way. ." Good heavens," I cried in my heart.. "Am ■ I going to be ill—am I going to take the-, fever ?' _ , I staggered_ into a chair. The - room looked hazy and indistinct. - The. faces swam before. me. I pressed my hands to my .head. . It • was burning hot Then,- suddenly, as the feel-;"; ing had come -it, passed. My .brain steadied ■, anamy eyes cleared and I rose. "If you will excuse me," I said, "I will go to bed. I don't feel, very: well." ; . I believe they: spoke, but -there- came . a'? buzzing singing noise in my ears and I could not hear distinctly. - "I think this must be-something like people;: feel when they are drunk," I said .to myself : and I seemed to hear my own foolish laugh as . I said it. . , 't Then I was in my room. I .was trying, to " pull off my clothes. .
