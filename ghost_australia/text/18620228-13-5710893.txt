THE LAND BILLS, AND ITS OPPONENTS. TO THE EDITOR. OF THE ARGUS, Sir-As the Land Bill now before the Committee of the Legislative Assembly is engrossing considerable attention, both in doors and out, shall feel greatly obliged by your allowing me a little space in your valuable paper to make a few remarks upon this vexed but highly important question, although your various able leaders have pretty well exhausted the subject. Being neither a squatter nor a farmer, it is only fair to suppose that my observations are made without any particular bias for or against either party Like many others, I am desirous of seeing the welfare of this fine but badly managed colony promoted, and established upon a safe and solid looting, and, by wise and sound legislative ena." ments, most ardently wish to see the public lands of the country dealt with in such a manner as to give to those who are anxious of turning their attention to agricultural pursuits a fair opportunity for so doing. At the same time, I should b > sorry to had that the interests of the pastoral tenants were being jeopardised, or wantonly sacrificed, because I am of opinion that the farming and squatting interests may work has enormously together, instead of there being fe ever looked upon as diametrically opposed and antagonistic to each other, by many parties who appear to be lamentably ignorant of the true position of either of them I have watched n 4th considerable anxiety the various efforts made by different Governments to settle the land q section, and am sorry to confess that the manner in which the subject has been invariably treated by the opposi- consists has been such as to seriously retard the progress of the colony, and that our credit has been greatly in jured by the petty and unstatesmanlike squabbles which have arisen in the debate on this most vital question, as well as by the extremely narrow minded or EelQbh views entertained by soon parties who profess to study the general welfare of our adopted country, but who in reality have poor antly or wilfully done everything that lay in their power to check or ruin it A cry has been raised, and industriously circulated throughout the length and breadth of the land, that the squatter, the banker, and the merchant have combined, in a monetary point of view, in a most unrighteous warfare against the interests of the middle and working classes and that they have determined, not only to keep the people from off the land of the colony, but to monopolize or buy up the whole of it Now, I am quite willing to admit that under the old system of disposing of the public lands by auction, pre-emptive light, and special survey, these parties would in time have been enabled to possess themselves of nearly all that was worth having but when a check was judiciously put upon this injurious mode of alienating the Crown lands, and under the Nicholson Land Bill free selection after survey was established, a step was taken in the right direction. Then, the farmer in ember) o had some chance of obtaining what he wanted, but it turned out that the limited auction scheme still gave the capitalist an undue advantage over the man of scanty means Then again, when two or more parties applied for the same land, the first applicant was debarred from taking it up, and the auctioneer _ hammer was called into requisition, so that all the applicants except one had paid their money, and wasted their time for nothing, and, perhaps, not one of them became the purchaser of the land in question, but some speculator stepped in and bought up the "best bit, free, of course, from all restrictions as to occupancy or improvements Under the present bill the old adage is attended to-" First come first served." Now, this is as it should be The mode adopted by the Heales Ministry, of allotting a man to take up a certain quantity of land by paying £1 per acre for half of it, and leasing the remainder at an annual rental of 21 6d per acre for eight years, was another step in the right direction, but it was a step not quite far enough to please my taB e, because the lessee after paying for the residue of the land had still to buy it, and I believe that it was liable to be sold by public auction, in which case he might be outside, and thus lose it altogether But it will be said that he would be allowed for all improvements Now, I will defy any man to say what would remunerate him for his loss. By the present bill it is proposed, not only that the first applicant shall become the actual purchaser by paying down 10s an acre for the land, and a grant shall be forthwith issued for half of it, but the balance is to be paid by eight annual instalments of 2s 6d per acre, when another Crown grant will be given for the remaining half, so that, instead of his being a more tenant of the Crown for eight years, he becomes the bona, fide owner of the property for the same money as he would have given in the shape of rent, and, what is still infinitely better, the land cannot be sold away from him And yet, strange to Bay, in the very face of this liberal proposition, the men who brought forward the less advantageous scheme have the " cheek " to oppose the present one, as being less liberal than their own, although it is a much better one If this be not downright foolery or rascality, I know not what to call it This may appear very du courteous language to make use of in speaking of men lately called honouiableB (Heaven save the mark I), but it is better to speak thus of such political char stars than expose our weakness by lighting the battle of Victoria against Victoria's through the columns of The Times, or any other portion of the English press, which I have more than once felt inclined to do. The present bill is not all that I or any other man acquainted with the farming interest could wish, but as it is the best we are likely to get it would be prudent to accept of it, and to lead. those that come after us to demand something better. Having thus touched upon the Land Bill with reference to the agricultural interest, which I consider of more importance than the pastoral, I wish, with your kind permission, to say a word 5 or two upon the latter. But in doing this I am desirous that both parties should know that, as I am the son of an old farmer, and was employed for several years in valuing and selling landed property and farming stock in the eastern counties of England, my sympathies are some what inclined towards the agricultural party, consequently, if my observations are a little unpalatable to them and favourable to the squatters it is solely because I can see plainly enough that' we have many persons in this colony who would deal harshly, unfairly, and, I may add, most dis honestly, by the squatters, by completely swamp mg or driving them on the other side of Jordan, alias the Murray, thus acting the part of the dog in the manger, by keeping the lands to ourselves, yet unable to do any thing with them Now, I will take up Mr. Service's idea of letting the runs by auction This I look upon not simply as impracticable, but as an impossible thing to carry on for the plainest and best of all reasons nobody would take them " Oh, you are mistaken," will be the reply " The squatter will oppose, each other " But they are not such consummate blockheads as to out each other's throats in vans was), literally speaking. "Well, then," say they, "if the squatters won't do it the capitalists or farmers will do it for them " Now, if the capitalists were only just to try it on I will venture to say that they would soon grow tired of it, because they would be out of their proper element, and totally unable, from various causes over which they could exercise no control, to carry out the project either with satisfaction or profit to themselves and I don't think they would like to play a losing game for any great length of time As to the farmer leasing the runs now held by the settlers, those who talk in such a perfectly ridiculous manner, or that speak so vauntingly of the resources of the agricultural body in this colony, know but little about what they are talking The farmers of this country for many years to come will have their noses put too closely to the grindstone of adversity to be agreeable, but this will teach them to be more economical, and not to waste their hard earnings in nobblerising, luxurious living, or extravagant finery, if they wish to keep clear of the Insolvent Court, for the fall in the price of -(uncultured produce, coupled with the high rate of wages, will cause the very best of them to put their shoulders to the wheel in such a manner as they have never done since the discovery of gold in this colony It is thought that the squatters runs should be subdivided. This might be done if the. farmers were a more numerous and wealthy class than they now are, and if our population, instead of being about 200 000, were something like. b 000 000 ; but, not before observed, they will have plenty on their hands without becoming squatters. They best thing they can do is to resort to the English system of grazing as much as they possibly can, and it would be well for them to turn their attention to p odour; artificial food, such as Swede turnips, mangold wurtzel, &c.;, for fattening sheep and cattle If this were done on a tolerably large scale, say on 1,000 acres of really good land (half of which should be broken up), I would back their undertaking against nine tenths of the stations in this or any other Australian colony Now in order to prove that a large quantity of land, whether agricultural or pastoral, (for it matters not which,) can be managed with much loss expense under one man than it could be by half a dozen men I will refer to two cases that occurred in Doom; Ten, near Spalding, in Lincolnshire. Six small farmers, occupying about 100 acres each", under the late Lord Carrington, were obliged to re- linquish their holdings because they were unable to pay their rents and support their families. One person, possessed of considerable capital, took at an increased rental, the whole of these six farms, and in a few years he made what was considered in that part of the country a good jumping sum from this land alone, a circumstance easily accounted for, because he could manage the whole with half the labourers, and at the same. time monopolize the living of those six families Another party, a gentleman of fortune, who was brought up to the legal profession, growing tired of the law, took it into his head that he would turn farmer and grazier ; being the owner of a splendid farm of 4 GO acres about four men at from the town, he gave his tenant notice to quit, took possession himself, and employed a first rate practical farming bailiff to mana,' i it for him, but at the end of five years he found that he had not only lost the rent which his formerly received, but had actually sunk several thousand pounds besides. A cousin of mines Mr. Plowrmht, of Pinchbeck Orange), was asked to take this identical farm, which he did, at £1,000 a year; and he not only paid the rea, punctually. when, it became due, but in a few years he cleared considerably more than the other lost This arose from his having several other farms in the same locality, which enabled him to manage the one in question with far less expense, and his constant shifting of stock from one place to the other gave him a great advantage over the amateur grazier, whose operations were confined to this one farm, while the other had half-a-dozen or more. For this, and many other reasons which might be adduced, I am convinced that to divide the squatters' runs would be an unwise and impolitic stop to take for the present, The time may, and in all probability will come, when squatting will altogether cools in this colony; but I am apprehensive that the world will have grown a good deal wiser and older before this consummation so devoutly to be wished is realized. As to "free gross," if the agriculturists have enough to do to carry on their own legitimate calling for some years to come, they won't have much occasion for free pasturage. If they were to become outside squatters they would neglect their farms, and thus by aiming at too much, with limited means, would make a mess of it. With refer ease to the 10,000,000 acres agreed to be set aside for agricultural purposes, I am sadly afraid that unless our prospects become much brighter than they now are, they will not be taken upon this side of Doomsday, nay, I am inclined to think that one-half of the lands already under cultivation will be abandoned be for long, because, with a decreasing population, and an evident desire on the nail of thousands to leave the colony, we are, as a people, rapidly retrograding and although I am not much of as it must, I cannot help thinking that we are drilling to perdition as fast as we can. Ililli rents and exorbitant wages, with the want of a constant and healthy stream of enemy garrison, have done the " trick" for us and no mistake and I will venture to say that if the leases Ministry had succeed in imposing a, ho try duty upon imported goods, instead of our Becoming a prosperous people, Victoria might have shut up shop, or given up the ghost alto gather, for her shallow patch politicians would have sacrificed her, and that most completely Such men may mean well, I dare say they do , but they have not the mental capacity to grapple with and overcome the difficulties which stare in in the face and threaten our destruction. It is a lamentable sight to see so fine a country as this undoubtedly is struggling hard to retain its existence through the shockingly bad management of its Lilliputian legislators From what I have thus hastily written, in the simplest phraseology, in order that I may not be misunderstood by anyone who can road, it will be seen that I am in favour of the present Land Bill, although it is not the best that might have been introduced, still, it is the best that we are likely to get, and I look upon it as a perfect waste of time and madness to oppose it, and, moreover, I do not hesitate to say that those who wish to throw it overboard without having a better one to introduce, and one that would b a likely to pass the Upper House, are neither more nor less than downright traitors to their adopted country, and ought to be so considered by every honest and patriotic man. Feeling that I have already trespassed too much upon your kind indulgence, I will conclude by stating that, should the present bill become the law of land (which sincerely hope will be the case), I shall be happy to point out to intend- ing purchasers through your columns what sort of land to buy for farming purposes, and how to make the most of it when they vo got it. Your obedient servant. JOHN HURREY. Bridge-road, Richmond, February 22.
