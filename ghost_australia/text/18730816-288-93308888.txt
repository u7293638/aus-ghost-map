Though they paid £13,000 per annum for this trade, they mast remeniper 'that ih'iy hid not yet spent their million of money to connect - Adelaide with thp Murray, Why did New South Wales, when she asked Victoria £47,000 for the share of trade she was doing, .only- ask South Australia JE13.000, jeicept that it 'showed the latter was doing less of the trade?

They must not' lose sight either of the fact, that in the upper river districts the settlers could supply themselves ?cheaper than we could do, and, therefore, it was^bsurd to construct a railway acknowledged to be for that purpose. ? Mr.: Landsepr had, he thought, in his evidence before the Committee, settled the question of the Murray trade so conclusively that he never -expected that: any man would after wardH: be advocating 'the 'cpa struction of a railway from Adelaide to the Murray. He was opposed to the prinoipl of .making railways, unless it oculd be .shown that there was a probability of their returning the outlay at no distant date, but he would en courage private enterprise in that direction by granting land along a line of railway, or would, under some conditions, give a bonus to any Company that might undertake to make and work railways in districts where the land was sold. '. He -would rather facilitate the construction of a line to Port Darwin than advocate a railway to the Murray, and thought it would be wise policy to carry their lines as far as settlement had extended, because he be lieved it would lead to the present short lines becoming remunerative. It was clearly shown that' it was impossible. for short lines to pay against cartage by drays, as farmers could very well manage to take their produce to marketfor a short distance in such a -way. If they were going to borrow money, heshould^say theyought to. extend their trunk lines, making the roads as.r feeders \o them. Otherwise the country would- , be burdened with debt. He was extremely gla*f the| meeting had so decidedly expressed its' views against the Munay railway scheme, by Carrying the resolution unanimously, and he thought it a judicious course to adopt in for* warding circulars embodying their 'views throughout the colony. - : ' . ; '' Mr. West-Ebskine, Jn answer to Mr. Ean kine as to the manner in which the South Aus tralian Government reimbursed itself for -the £13,000 paidiito .NewSouthi Wales for aUo^g goods to go - up the river free pt duty, said the facV was that' the £13,600 was the amount which we formerly; collected for Ne^ South/ Wales, but/that under the new arrangement it' might not ' ' Be'ceBsarily be £13,000,liut;perhaps-above or below that ^sum, in which case either the one or the other po .vernment would benefit by the amount* col-', lecied. ..''; :' - : ? --- i: ?'?? - :Mr. A; F.
