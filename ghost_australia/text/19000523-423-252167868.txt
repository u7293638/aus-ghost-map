COUNTRY NEWS. WELLINGTON. (From the Wellington Ttmtt.) A fat bullock strolled along Warne-e'.reet on Saturday, in a contemplative mood, and when it teaolied the-band hall quietly leaned up against the building, gazed vacantly at the sky and the surroundings, and then, being tired of the prospect, and the bevine joys of this world, gave up the ghost. Uessrs. Thomas and Botton having decided to relinquish the produce business, have let their new premises (which will now be needlessly large for their future requirements) to Messrs. Wright, Heaton, and Co., and will shortly erect new offioes immediately alongside, where they will devote themselves entirely to general auctioneering. Messrs. Wright, Heatou, and Go., forwarding agents and carriers, of Sydney, and with branohes in most of the important towns in the oountry, are about to establish a branch in Wellington. Messrs. Smythe and Finney, of the oompany, have been in town during the week making enquiries. (Air. "Tim" Dempsey, late of the Orange branoh, has bean appointed manager.) A burning accident happened on Saturday to Mrs. Trent, an aged cripple, who was staying with her sisterâ€”Mrs. Bishop. She was sitting before the fire and attempted to get on to a stool on the opposite side of the fireplace, when she stumbled and fell into the fire. Her clothes were partially consumed, and she is suffering from severe burns. A quiet little wedding was celebrated at " East Lynne" at 3 p.m. on Thursday, when Mr. J. W. Marshall, of Percy-street, and Miss Ellen Crick were united in matrimony. Afterwards Mr. and Mrs. Marshall caught the evening train for Orange, where they will spend a few days.
