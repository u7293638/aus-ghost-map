A2J rSDlAiv GHOST STORY. fatter, who is said to hare lived on •farms of intimacy with a ghost for up wards of tweniy-fonr years, arrived here from Bungpore recenily, accompanied by his friend, a ghost, and is patting up in a . garden house in Dura Dam, belonging to f Baboo Guru Prosonno Ghoae. Between 5 and 0 p.m. there was a small friendly gathering at 2To. 1 Jorabagan, the town house of Baboo Guru Prosonno Gbose Baboo Dnkhina Kunjun, a wealthy fgmindar of flungpore, was one of the party. The ghost happens to be an old acquaintance of this gentleman, and was introduced by him several years ago to the late Rajah Baroda Kant Bahadoor. hlany were the interviews which both the Bajah and Baboo Dnkhina Jinn Jan had with, the spirit in days gone by. The spirit is arid to be under great obligations to Baboo Dnkhina Bnnjun, for, at the spirit's request or recommendation, the Baboo has made the present of a ialak to the fatter, the friend and travelling com panion of the ghost, yielding an income of7000 rupees per annum, which the iakeur still enjoys. Baboo Dnkhina JElnnjnn believed that the gho3t could not hare forgotten this. It was upon the strength of this belief that he asked the party assembled at Jorabagan to start for T)nm Dam at once, although Baboo Garu Prosonno had been told by ihafctecr that it would be advisable to allow the spirit two or three days* rest from the fatigues of traTel before an interview was sought. The party started, and it was 9 p.m. when they reached the garden at DumDom. Up to 1 a.m. all efforts to extract a word from, the spirit were of no avail, until the most earnest supplication of Baboo Duk Tiina Bnnjnn, asking for the spirit's bless ings, met with the response, " Go with my blessings," uttered in a deep and remanding tone, and seeming to come from the branch of a tree. As soon as fh« ghost is found more desirably com municative the public will be duly informed of it. Dr. Sircar, we hear, has Been already invited. —C&Icutia; Dally j
