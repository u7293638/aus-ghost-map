Race Meetings* South Australian Jockey Club. [By Tblegkafh.] Fikst Day. May 2. The opening day ot the South Australian Jockey Club Meeting, at Flcmington, on Saturday, was favoured with weather superior to ts^e finest day of the V. R. C. Spring Meeting. Every corner of the course was as green as an emerald, and the grass on the lawn was not so long as to be a discomfort to those who liked to promenade between the acts. Amongfct the visitors were his Excellency the Governor, Lady Loch and suite, and there was a large crowd in the paddock made up very largely of the V. R. C, from whom the institution in poseeseion for the time received no benefit. The attendance in the other parts of the coarse was tbat of an ordinary off day meeting at Flemington. In two of the events comprising the programme the fields were good, but in the three other raceB five horses was the maximum. Only three horses — Silver King, The Broker, and Sandal— saddled for the St. Leger, but the betting seemed to indicate tbat all three were looked upon with some favour. Silver King, who had already won two Legers, was backed at nearly even money, but in the opinion of many The Broker would have beaten him in Sydney but for a stumble. Tne best odds against the chestnut was 6 to 4. Sandal made the pace, ami with such effect that at one time it seemed improbable that either of the colts would catch her, but the South Australian mare, who was galloping low with a long and even stride, kept tbe lead until the home turn was gained, when Hie pace told, and soon the other pair were ranged alongside. In the race to the judge's box, Silver King at first looked like winning, but The Broker bad most pane in reserve, and catching the favourite within 100 varda of the post, kept a bare head in advance for the rest oi the journey. An interesting event was the Goodwood Handicap, It being the tag race of the day, and for which exactly 20 starters remained in. Amongst them Topaz was, as far as the betting indicates merit, considered the beat. Iron master, who won last year in the best time yet made for the race, has the advantage of a year in age and no addi ditional weight, but the horse was hardly right enough to excite any violent fancy for his chance, as the offered odds of 100 to 8 plainly hinted. After Topaz, St. Lawrence and Lord Wilton received very fair support, but against any thing else liberal odds were offered. With a light weight Lantern, who from the first was looked upon as having been most generously treated by the handicapper, was backed to win a fair amount at Tatteraall's on the nierht before. Tbe horse— although rather too long in the limbs for a model, looked stout enough to make 6st. 121b. a feather weight in a mile race— had the good fortune to get clear of the ruck, too, for the instant the word ' go ' was given he went away with a bound, and was never caught again, and won easily by three lengths. As the South Australian got the placed horses, it cannot be said that the racing men of that colony lost much through the event being run on Flemington. Lantern has won several miner races in South Australia, but fids is the first tune that he has cained a prominent position in a big race. Whatever chance Topaz had he lost by delay at the start, and the fault cost him over a dozgp lengths. He was with the leaders again at halfwav round, but after that he was never seen in -the front rank. The Sires' Produce Stakes was simply a question of which of the three Gang Forward youngsters was best. The public settled the matter beforehand by unanimously eelectiag Sir T. Elder's filly Juaana, who was backed at the odds of 4 to 1 on her. Eighteen horses made an excellent field for the finalevent— the victoria Handicap.
