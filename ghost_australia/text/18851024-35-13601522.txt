CONGREGATIONAL SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. The annual meeting of the C negril on Sunday) School Union was held in the Pitt-street Congregational Church last night There TV as a good attendance, out the audience was not so large as it would have been had the weather not assumed SUCH a threatening aspect. The Rev Walter Mathison, B A , president of the Union, presided The proceedings were commenced with the singing of the living "Lord of the Living Har vest," after which prayer was offered by the Rev. Mr Olley The CHAIRMAN said there was one peculiar and very happy cirotuiistauco in connection with then Union mellings so far from growing old the) always doTclnpcd into a TV onder ful ) youthfulness at the close, and at though they always blossomed out in a beautiful way on the Saturday) afternoon. He thought that was a happy indica- tion of what was the real work of thou Lord Jesus Christ in the world, and of that blessed rain which it was the great work of Christianity to bring at the last The time was coming when they should all be young, and the cares and doubles of the world would blossom out into joy in the future An) meeting that had for its obioctthccaio of children, their instruction and (heir noble training, and especial).) any meeting of children themselves, was one of the great miracles of Christendom-a quite astonishing thing when they looked back and remembered was once more had come When their Lord Jesus Christ and a child in their midst, and also took little children in the arms and blest them, He was inaugurating a new era in this world, and he inaugurated a new cm as he inaugurated most things, not b) building up large organisations but by simply introducing a new spirit into the world And he taught men to look at childs n as they NOT er had looked at them before, and He brought that light which cast upon all the relationships of life a new and agitations mean- ing They could not exaggerate the immense blessings which their Lord had conferred upon them by withdrawing them from the selfish ambitions and hatreds of their natural hearts to the minor sentiments that really belonged to them as the children en of the Great rather in heaven no man could measure the addition of joy to HUB world which then Lord Jesus Christ made when he taught people to subdue the mad, strong passions in which men had thought their manhood rested before and t fight them to see in their relationships the sacredness which at any rate they tried to sing now And when they thought of all the blessedness that came to them in life through the chil hen-when they thought of what a music there was in their laughter, what a fund there was in their eyes to whosoever could hear lightly and look rightly tho) had again to thank the Christ for the blessings which he had given to (him He was very fond of (those words sometimes ascribed to Charles Dickens, but Charles Dickens find quite a sufficient literary events tion without tiling the pleasures of others which happened to be found in Charles Dickens' desk when he did - ' they are ideas of the heart and the household, They are angels of God in disguise His soul gilt still sleeps in their tresses, His glory still 1 came in their even Oh I those of cants from home and from heaven, 1 hcT bftT e made me more manly and mild, And I know now how Jesus could liken 1 he kingdom of God to a child ' Those who taught the young were receiving better lessons than they could give and were die IT far greater happiness than they could bestow He would nothing them at any greater length, as they had a lengthy programme to go through, and in conclusion, would call upon the choir to give the man anthem The choir having rendered the anthem " Not unto us, O Lord," the chairman called upon Mr C H Slatyer to lead the annual report Mr SLATÍIÍH, lead the annual report, which was as follows:- " The sixth annual report of the New South Wales Congregational Sunday School Union October 23rd, 1885 - Your committee, in presenting their sixth annual report, thank the Almighty) Father for having permitted them to lnbourwithadegieo of success in the field to which they have been called, and believe that the fruits of their work will be seen in the most efficient management and general improvement of the schools in connection with our Union The annual meeting last year was largely attended, and the Rev. W Mathison, B A , delivered an interesting and in structive o address The flower service was high was very successful, was conducted by the president (Rev Gem go Campbell), and the Rev. T. E. Owens Moll addressed the schools According to our usual custom, the flowers were collected at the close of the service, and forwarded to the several hospitals and other institutions in Sydney) and the suburbs, ncknovilcdgniwits being received from those in charge of the same that has removed several from our midst during the past year, and by the death of Mr Salier, who so long conducted the flower services, and a tender ed good service to the union as a visitor to the various schools, Your committee felt that they had lost one who took a deep interest in the work of Sabbath schools At the committee meeting hold November 18, 1851, a motion expressive of sympathy) with the widow and of unity was passed, and it was also resolved to invite the school to contribute to the erection of a monu- ment over the grave of our esteemed fellow-worker The appeal was liberally responded to, and on Saturday afternoon 27th June, a large number gathered at Rookwood to witness the unveiling of the memorial stone, which was performed by the Rev. George Campbell (president of the Union), the Revs J T W Davies and S Sftvago also taking part in the service The total rest of the monument was £22 3s Oil MIsS Cunninghame, a teacher in the Croydon School, was also called away from the scene of acts ve service, and your committee addressed a letter of sympathy to the school thus deprived of an esteemed worker The quarterly re-unions have been well attended, and the subjects chosen for Conference have evoked animated discussions 'the (list took place at Marrickville, when a conference on temperance work among the young' was hold he matter was left in the hands of Mr Ayling, a member of the committee, but that gentleman having reigned his position as delegate owing to family) bereavement, Mr Gray was appointed to carry out the work We anticipate that this gentleman will formu- list of some scheme which will meet with the approval of the schools At the next reunion, held at Petersham, the subject, What is the bestmctliodof bran ging the schools into a closet connection with the Church was opened by Mr S Hague Smith the last meeting was held in Pitt-street, when Mr Buzacott introduced the subject, ' How can Fund in schools be made more attractive' Your committee hope that a still greater interest will be manifested in these gallic kings, and that the teachers will, by then picnics, encourage all who are taking part in this work. During the past venour visitor, Mr Miller, has been actively) engaged and the reports furnished by him have been very interesting Owing to the death of Mr. Salier, it became necessary to appoint another visitor, and Mr James Robertson was elected During the coming year we expect go d results from such relive gentlemen as now for this in portant poet it will always give the secretaries much pleasure to for vi and copies of these sports to the various schools, should they desire it During the very, Rev S Bryant, who was on a visit to the Newcastle district, kindly undertook to visit the schools in the interests of the Union, and he furnished us with an into resting report Messrs Newman and On rendered a similar service at Katoomba, and when they reported that a new school was to be opened at the nunn youl counties determined to bind a donation of serviceable books in of the gift has been suitably acknowledged The lit ok Committee, after due consideration, came to the following der sion in repaid to the disposal of the fund which had been collected -' that permission be obtained from the donor to the fund to purchase books to the value of fifty pounds, bunch books to be used us what he deemed most desirable The tin mug class lub-coiiunittce has not furnished a) report, owing to the fact that some of the members of that sub-committee are not now in connection with the Union Your committee hope that some steps will be taken in this important matter during the coming year It was with reg! at that -y ear committee determined to forego the winter coat is of lectures during the past year, bulbs) man) Returns have been given, and the evenings have been so) occupied, that your committee did not care to invite gentlemen to prepare lectures without being certain of a fair and dance No further steps have been taken by the gentlemen to whom the duty w HE delegated of endure owing to form a general Sunday School Union, but nearly every denomination ! as its own union in active operation, and it is now to be appears that a common habit cannot be found upon which a bin day School Union insight be established, the His class' examinations have been discontinued, but should cneiinistiiiiccs area which would justify -your committee in UoiÇjPinsmg them, we shall be prepared to co re J JIP li spital collections this year have realised more Him on any previous occasion, and reached the large man of -< 7 "?. which was distributed as follows -Children J Heslin in, Glebe £62 10s , Dint, Dumb, and Blind lost time, and lost , Child's At! and, Mooichil, £10, Childs WHILE P A to play, £10, 61 Id's Cot, Travancore, Madras Mission, of Mr CF who H Mayor was nominated a life-governor of the Children's Ho print It was with sincere regret that your committee find to accept (no respecter of Mr R i Orr, who has e vi or hill and ably filled the t Ihco of secretary) to the Union since the formation of the board, to whose indefatigable labours these echo of the Uni- he is largely due When the committee had accepted the it situation they felt that it was but due to Air On that they should give him some true vital piece of the esteem in which he is held and for this purpose and call was addressed to the various M him If the result will U term the testimonial wt pi sent to Mr Orr (his events,. and we hear that the Divine b COME g vol) rest upon him in every work to which the it puts his hand The ins lion thus An tied was filled to the old idea of the 1 IK in is Putt, a Outtram whose past expert see in this post, and his active work a car in close with the Pont Pi] o and school, and den him well qualified to accept the office Dm at the yiiirunpw set of has been a i d at Ccnin cong We have now 2 I n in oils in connect in with the Union continuing 42 to 14) >OIS and 1/7 In chair The treasurer's report will show that it we still require a pleased and for the coming in of our work, and we appeal to the fuel do w] o ino for now actively engaged in Subi nth School work to aid us is liber in donations and active pray tiful s, mp it in our work and we J'tl certain Unit this institution, which h e Ipcn prediction of much good in the part will be still more fruit fly in the future Our earnest prayer for the coming vein is that He who said sailing the little children to come unto Me' and) abundantly) seven tun labours in this portion of His vineyard In conclusion, we (thank the deacons and office bearers of the Pitt-street Church for so generously) placing the room at our disposal in which we have held JUI monthly meetings, and for assisting us in every manner in which it has been in their power to do so." Mr. C. E. W SHALT. read the financial statement, which showed Dr., £313 19s. 5d., including Children's Hospital Suut'ny, 237 8s. 3d. ; book fund, £82 6s. 3d. Cr., £238 7s. 6d.; deposits S. and S. Building Society, £60; cash in bank, £14 18s. ; petty cash, 13s. 11d. Mr. T. PrATT, who was called upon by the chairman, moved the adoption of the ropes t and balance-sheet. He said it afforded him much pleasure to come forward and move the adoption of the report which they had just heard read. They were always very much pleased to see a large gathering of their friends assembled to help them in celebrating their anniversary. (Applause.) There were many points of interest touched upon in the report, but time would not allow him to deal with them all. One matter which he wished to refer to was the large amount of money which had been collected from year to year on behalf of the hospital fund. This matter was only brought forward four years ago, when circulars in regard to it were issued to the various Sunday schools, and the result was that about the sum of £50 was collected. This amount had been increased year by year, and last year the sum fell very little short of £100. The Government of the colony gave them a like amount, and by this means the sum became doubled. It was almost unnecessary for him to tell them that the amounts were received thankfully by the institutions to which they were sent. The children were deeply interested in these matters, and he hoped parents would do all they could to help the children with their contributions. Another matter he wished to call attention to was the lack of teachers in many of their Sunday schools. Many of their schools were suffering in this respect. They wished to stir the parents and friends up to labour for the Master's cause j to come forth Sunday by Sunday and engage themselves in the grand and glorious work of Sunday school teaching, from a sense of duty. The teachers of their Sunday schools would also be very glad if the parents of the children would give their schools an occasional visit. This would give the teachers encouragement, inasmuch as it would lead them to conclude that the parents themselves were deeply interested in the welfare of their children. In conclusion, he said he hoped the meeting would cause them to take deeper interest in the welfare of Sunday schools generally and result in not only increased Real in the schools with which they were connected, but an increase also of the number of those who would come forth and help to carry on their grand and glorious work. (Applause.) Mr. GRAY seconded the motion for the adoption of the report and balance-sheet. The motion was unanimously carried. At this stage of the proceedings the chairman, on behalf of the Sunday School Union, presented the late secretary of the union, Mr. R. T. On-, with a handsome clock, bearing a suitable inscription, as a token of the esteem in which his services had been held during his term of office. The chairman, in making the presentation, referred briefly to the active part Mr. On- had taken in the union, and stated that the establishment and success of the union was very largely due to the energy and devotedness of Mr. Orr. Mr. Once, in a few well chosen remarks, suitably acknowledged the gift. The Rev Dr JEFFERIS then delivered an address He said -The committee of the Sunday School Union requested me to address you to-night They did not, however, assign no am special subject Of course I must speak to you as to a company of teachers engaged in giT nig religious instruction to our youth So far, at least, I am restricted in my) choice If I can say something that shall give you and clearer view of the duty you have undertaken, and that may thus help you to do that duty better, the committee's wish and my own will be fulfilled Now, I want you to look with me at education as a whole so that we may see the different parts of it, and the relation they have to one another We are all agreed that children must not he left to grow up without some sort of framing Especially) I think during the last half century, Englishmen throughout the Empire time now at ened to the conviction that education is really necessary to life, that it is altogether contrary to the Divine idea, and to the thought of the wisest among men, flint is) among us should begin their individual audrespon sible career without being prepared for the duties which so- long to life We need to have (had thought very (firmly fixed in our nature The character of the Commonwealth depends on the character of the citizens Citizens of OMI iso or unwise, virtuous or vicious, religious or irreligious, according to the training through which the passed in their v outh I do not of course, mean that education is over) (but g, and that there is no freedom for good or ill, in opposition to it, when maturity) is reached But you will I am sure, agree with me that allowing for all exceptions, we me what we are, at. a whole, according to the training of our early years If we could only see good in getting all our youth trained in the best way, generation or two would produce a people always acting at the behest of wisdom and virtue and religion There are three powers were used by nature, t e by God, with responsibilities in regard to education education in (the broadest sense the parent, the State, the Church It will be no unwise use of our time, and it will bear very directly on the work of the Sunday school, if we try to look at these three powers in I action-paleutal governmental, religious The several re- sponsibilities and the mutual relations admit of much difference of opinion and I do not hope to set for the a confessedly difficult subject very) dear 1> but if we are set thinking about it, either thoughts will come beyond an) that I shall I expres Viva will list of all look at the par on tal power, the most sacred and the most influential of all children are born as the result of the sacred union of man and woman the husband and wife become father and mother The relationship is tender and endearing Eove foigesalond of might) power between the parent and child With this there stands connected a great and solemn responsibility) "Those words," said JoliOTah, to the parentage of ancient Israel, " these words that I command Uno this day shall be upon thine heart, and thou shall (carry them diligently unto (11) children, and shall talk of them when thou bravest in the house and Then thou walkest by the way " We do not need Revelation to tell us that parents are bound to teach and train their children The instincts and necessities of family life alike onion it. But we do need to insist upon it with all the sanctions of nature and religion We are required to proclaim with a limpet tongue that children are given to parents in order that they might be his night and framed for a useful and a godly life The longer I live the more I am persuaded that God's chief vice- regal upon the earth is not the monarch nor the priest, but the father, and that society can be reconstructed-regenerated-only by pin lying and strengthening the home That ancient lawgiver was wiser than many of the moderns who on being advised to establish a popular government in seedsmen, ripened, *' Go and first male trial of it in thine own family " He recognised the fact that the true State is but an expansion of the family, and that so called political principles must have their basis, and even I (heir counterpart in (his home The authority of the parent continues throughout the time of immaturity) in the life of the child, (he period of non-age During this period, the father and mother are bound to use their best influence to lying (hen children into obedience to all recognised laws, human and divine laws of the family, laws of the State laws of nature, IUWB of religion Give) me bound to instruct their children in the knowledge requisite for this and to train them in habits of obedience What is wanted above most things in practical dealing with this question of education, is to charge home upon parents their duty andiespon slight) The chief turning must ever be carried on in the family Whatever tends to weaken the influence of family) life or to lessen the authority of the parent, must be denounced as an interference with the divine order in society You must all feel as I do, that in our day, the sanctions of the home are not what they ought to lie, not, perhaps, what they used to be Parents do not feel the full strength of their ^Ahgnhons Children do not understand the sacredness of their duty How many Christian homes and of these in which the duties of citizenship and the duties of religion are taught by the parent Unconscious influence is, of course, continually being excited By the power of example children are always being trained lift were not for these indirect means of instruction, in many a family there would be had day any at all It is not too much to say that parental education is for the most part shamefully) neglected Very) much of this neglect is owing to diminish' n of other powers The State and the Church are distinctly chargeable with bringing about a relaxation of parental authority Both of them, with right intention and commendable zeal, have endeavoured (to col root abuses in the commonwealth, by men posing their own services in the training of children But in doing thistliOT hiTO wrought great harm, by furnishing patents with a plea for the neglect of duty ' It the schoolmaster tenches CT on thing about life, and the religious test her everything about God, why need I trouble myself about eight ?"'

I only ask you to conceal certain mm ciples which are well nigh universally admitted Instead of theory, look at the actual condition of English social life, and see where the State should come forward in her own right for the discharge of of her own specific duty, and where she may well come forward to supply what is lacking and necessity) when parents 01 religions leathers fail in doing their duty Among the admitted duties of the State, as they are interpreted in the light of model a political philosophy, is that of founding a system of national education available for the children of all the families of the land As Whatever view you take of the range of education, it is clear that without a national system a large number would grow up unedu- cated Man) parents are poor, many are reckless, many seem absolutely without any sense of responsibility) some Public school system ought to be under taken if children are to be taught the barest rudiments If you take a higher v Levy of what is necessary, the argument will apply to a larger number The definition of education given in the Prussian national system is the harmonious and equable evolution of the human powers by a method based on the nature of the mind Every power of the soul must be unfolded, every crude principle of life stirred up and nourished, all one-sided culture avoided, and the mines on which the strength and worth of men most, carefully) attended to" his definition would make necessary a training that would be ph) meal, match dual, moral, religious, with perhaps that which is getting more and more into favour the training we call technical, and which consists in preparing children and youth for the actual parts they should play in the If no education like this is a necessity, then the State is bound to come to the help of parents, and by its resources call into existence a national system which would supply to the children of the poor and the not nth what otherwise they would never got Besides this function of the State, which we may regard as norma and necessary, there is another result- ing from what I conceive to be a light view of hooligan tions of Government All children that are orphaned or deserted, or left untended through death or crime or sickness, and who are not otherwise cared for b) genuine private charity, must be dealt with as the children of the State Here the State becomes for all practical purposes the parent, and is bound to feel and ple the and educate them Up to a very recent period this was done by the medium of present institutions Let me quote remarks recently made I by me on this subject, at a Sunday evening lecture "Our Government, aided by philanthropists, have been striving. to discharge this duty ma way that set at defiance the Divine order in society) Ignoring the necessity of family life for these waifs and strays we have gathered them by hundreds in single buildings at Randwick Parramatta and eldest born Dopnvedof the influences which spring from the life of relatives and friends, it has been impossible to train them for common duties Children want homes, not institutions, fathers and mothers to Ino with, yet more than masters to teach It is von marvellous to me how the belief in the family system as against the institution system has during the last five years sprung into full maturity We have resolved to abandon the barrack method in di thing with young life 1 Two years ago Randwick find nearly 700 children It will have only 100 at the close of the year. The Protestant and Catholic Orphanages at Pamuniitta were nearly) full They are now nearly empty The children of the State are for the most part living in homes like other children, or in cottage homes studio is like to other homes an possible " A> he will not commend in this the action of the State P If it began like an honest but blundering father, it is now acting in of a true and experienced mother, or rather, I should F iv, like father and mother both This problem of State education is, as you know, greatly complicated by the religious question I do not want to enter into this beyond what is necessary for showing you the relation in which you stand as tent he is of religion to the commonwealth at hugo The "state in New South Wales has provided that in the Public schools the children of all citizens shall have facility and opportunity for instruction in a religion, and that the State teachers, within somewhat rigidly guarded limits, should impart a knowledge of the main facts and principles of Christianity It is when vi to consider the duties and responsibilities of the Chuichmtho matter of education that we see where and how our own Son ices are required 1 say " the Church, because I believe in one Catholic Church, wider and more comprehensive than any existing section of it 'lies Church, representing the Lord Christ on the earth, comes forward to supply) whitE lacking on the part of the parent and the State It does not Bay to the parent " Give up your child to me I use no am responsible for teaching in the sacred truths of religion " It does not say to the State and have no thing to do with IP union, or if you have, it is simply) to act at my behest " This may do for Spain, but not for England, not for Australia It bays to the parent " Let me help you " If a is a to the State " Give me facilities for doing my work man organised way, so that I may enter the schools of the nation and teach religion is one of the necessary subjects of learning " it says to itself, " I will gather rest urges, a erect buildings, and summon teachers On Sunday cliche but on other days to as opportunity may offer, I will collect the children and instruct them in those divine truths which make for righteousness and are necessary for salvation " Now we who are here in answer to this Summons are to regard ourselves as servants of the Church and of Christ for the discharge of this duty AA p ought to be conscious of the Master's call We ought to be one pared to work in brothers) concert with those who are joined with was in the same service We ought to endeavour by wise methods, new and old, to use every opportunity alibi ded us by the State we ought to him of securing the help of the parents, as the chief factor, after all, in influencing the life of the child I cannot ft locust the future action of the churches in regard to the religious instruction to be imparted in State schools the Roman Catholic clergy will have nothing to do with education unless they have complete control of the children 1 Frisco paluma, A\ Obloyiins, and Piosb) tenons have agreed to take common action for the imparting of sectional teaching We have advocated a method of unsectarian instruction without avail The difficulty is doubtless put In England, Mr Gladstone is puzzled by it, as you may see by his Midlothian manifesto But leaving this, and with it any consideration of what the great body of Sunday- school teachers may have hereafter to do with it, I will now ask you to look with me at some features of our own special work First year Mr Munden, Alice presided t of the Council of 1 Education, who was at the same time President of the Sunday School Union, delivered a remarkable address in which he showed that the expansion of religious teaching in England had kept pace with the increase of secular teaching and that each had helped the other On the oils of elementary) schools there were about 4 300,000 children while the number attending Sunday schools was about ^,200,000 children taught by COO 000 teachers I do not know what the statistics for Australia would be, but the proportion would be probably be about the same We need not fear that the education which has been called Godless is having any injurious effect on John given But we must not forget that to secular instruction then has been brought the foremost culture of the nation, with all the nuisances that the national treasury) can furnish If religious instruction is to hold its own in the future it must be by remodelling the Sunday school by stein AA

superintendent will be able to choose most worthy But this we bind never get until the chin lies of Christ, 1 raised afresh by the Spirit of God, hnsliaintto recognise her sacred mission The teachers
