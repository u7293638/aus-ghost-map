A Wove! Coffin. Any innovation upon the .established customs and peculiarities of our burial system seems now so to predominate with id most all classes of the com- munity that scarcely can a new idea be brought to light on that subject tlian it is eagerly adopted by the ever-willing few, and made the platform for discussion by the many, as was tbe case some short time ago, when tbe London and Continental press discussed the question from all points of view, including the inauguration and adoption of ft Bystem of burial in wicker-work or basket-ware coffins. One of these wicker coffinB, the first ever made in the colony, was shown to our re presentative on Saturday afternoon at the shop of Mr F. Petfit, basket maker, Post- office Place, whieh, he states, has been made to order for the purpose of burial. This coffin, which is five feet six inches in length, and twenty inches across the shoulders, is constructed of about quarter inch cane, the top and Bides being mnde of very open cross bar work, and the bottom close, and of stronger cane. The lid, which works pa cane hinges, the handles, and tbe shape, are on tho principle of the ordinary coffin. Tho manufacturer volunteered a statement to the effect that it had teen made to the order of a lady, who fancies herself to be on the verge of eternity, and who insists upon being buried in the basket work ooffin. Thinking that her relations might interfere when it would be too late for her to have a say in the matter, she now reqnireB that that article shall be in the house before alio gives up the ghost. He refused to give this eccentric lady's name, but could positively assure us that these were facts, asd that the medical faculty had withdrawn all hope of her recovery. The ooffin is to remain by her bedside until death, wlion she will be placed in a shroud, put into the wicker-work, sur rounded with moss, and deposited in tbe earth from whence she oame.
