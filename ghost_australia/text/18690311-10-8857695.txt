THE PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE I AND THE POPE. (Translated in the Guardian from the Table it Star ) (1 extracted from the Official AccountoftlioPiotosjn column ) The discussion at the Pituaicli's Palace on coining the invitation to the Council to be held at Rome, on Thursday in last week (October 3rd), two oil Tests of the company of Monsignor By one of, the Envoy of his Holiness the Pope of Rome at Constantinople, came to the Piotosyncolliiim and requested an audience with the Most Holy Patriarch, on the part of Dom Tests, as agent of M Biuiioni, now absent at Rome The time appointed for the interview was between 6 and 10 on Saturday, October 5th About 10 o'clock on Saturday Dom Test is an ii ed accompanied by three other priests, of whom one spoke Greek a little, all, honour, spoke To each After the change of salutations at the Piotosyncollium, they were conducted by the Protosyucollus to his Holiness Having entered the presence of his Holiness and kissed his hands, they took their seats at the kindly mutation of the Pat much, whoombiaccd them While his Holiness was proceeding with the customary expressions of kindness and goodwill, they all rose and Dem Texas took from his bosom a letter, tied with gold cord, and in a paper cover, and handed it to the Paunch, while the post next to him said in Greek, " In the absence of Buiuoui we come to invite your Holiuoss to the Ecumenical Council to be held at Rome in the note you, on the 8th of Deco in bor, and therefore we call on you to accept this present written summons " His Holiuoss having indicated by a motion of the band that the gold fastened epistle which Dom Tests brought should be had on the desk, and that they should be seated, addressed them in an earnest tone indicative of paternal love and kindness If the daily pipers of Rome 1 ulIlOlO J.. . . g, . (cousin has. a UlClll is 1 not published the letter of summons of his Holiness to the as yo call it, Ocumouical Court etc at Rome, and consequently, if we had not known the object and contents of the letter and the pi recipes (platform and standpoint) of his Holiness, we would thankfully have received the letter sent from the Patriarch of Old Rome, ox porting thence to obtain some information Since, however, the bottom of summons already published in the newspapers has revealed the, principles of his Holiness-puuoiplos utterly abhorrent from those of the Orthodox Eastern Church on this account at once sorrowfully and straightforwardly wo tell your Holiuoss that we cannot receive either such a summons of such a documentation his Holiuoss assuming as he does the same principles as have always been assumed at Rome - principles antagonistic to the spirit of the Gospels and to the teaching of the Ecumenical Councils and of the Holy Fathers His Holiness having taken the same step also in 1848, summoned the Orthodox Eastern Church to make answer, by an encyclical letter, show nig distinctly and close by the opposition of the principles of Rome to the traditional and Apostolic ones-the answer to which not only did not please but also gave offence to his Holiuoss, and that his Holiness was greatly offended the counter reply from him clearly showed and since his Holiuoss o evidently will in nowise deviate from his own position, neither (by Du ino grace) do we mean to alleviate for our ours Wherefore we do not wish to occasion him fresh offence to no purpose, nor can we endure to loopuu old wounds and stir them up again extinct hatreds by questions and disputing of words which one, for the most part, in beaches and ill will whereas father each of us has need at this time, if over, of evangelical and common love and sympathy, on account of the many and various dangers and trials which she found the Church of Christ Nor, again, is my mu i ii understanding of discussion in Council possible unless they exist just the coin I moil basis of the same principles acknowledged I by both And fill their, own opinion is that the most successful and least irritating method of solving such questions is the historical method. Since it is manifest that there was a church in existence ton centuries back which hold the same doctrines in the East as in the West, in the Old as in the New Rome, let us each recur to that and see which of us has added night, which has diminished aught therefrom and let all that may have been added be struck off, if any there be, and wherever it be and for all that has been diminished therefrom be re-added, if any there be, and whatever it be and then we shall all unawares find ourselves united in the same symbol of Catholic Orthodoxy from which Rome, in the latter centuries having strayed, takes pleasure in widening the breach by overflow doctrines and institutions at variance with holy tradition. _ , First Priest, Dom Tostas.-What opinions discordant with tradition does your Holiness intend The Patriarchate omit details, we cannot so long as the Church of the Saviour is on earth) admits, that there is in the Universal Church of Christ any bishop, supreme ruler, and head other than the Lord ; 2, that there many patriarch infallible and unerring, speaking ex cathedra, i and Ecumenical Councils, in which latter is infallibility when they are in accordance with I Scripture and Apostolic tradition ; 3, that the Apostles wore unequal (in contempt of the Holy Ghost, who enlightened them all equally) ; or 4, that this or that Patriarch or Pope had pre eminence of seat, riot by human and synodical arrangement, but (as ye assert) by Divine right and other similar points. The Second Priestley is not proposed that Rome should change her principles. The Third Priest Since the Council of Florence having examined such, points united the two Churches, but still some individuals were left out of that union, these it is whom the Holy Father invites to the approaching OEcumenical Council, that these also may be perfectly united. The Patriarch None but an uneducated man (and your Holiness belongs not certainly to this class can by possibility be ignorant how many things have been spoken and written against the Council of Florence. And, disputes having arisen immediately after the last session of that compulsory assembly, the forced union died in its swaddling clothes. An assemblage collected on political grounds, on grounds purely of worldly interest, and which ended in a decision imposed for a time on some few of our church by dint of starvation and every kind of violence and threat by him who was then Popn. Such an assembly is not even worthy of the sacred name of Council. According to an (Ecumenical Council-Ocumonioal Church and true Catholicity is, and is defined to be that holy and undefiled body in which (independently of its material extent) the sum of the pure teach- ing of the Apostles is held, and the faith of the whole Church on earth, as it was established and thoroughly tried for the first eight centuries after the foundation of the Church, during which period the fathers, both of the East and West, and the seven and only GScumenical and most holy and inspired Councils speak one and the same heavenly utterance of the Gospel. Let these Councils, and those reverend fathers, whose writings are familiar to all, be the safe and unerring guide of every Christian and bishop of the West who honestly longs and seeks for Gospel truth. They are the highest touch- stone of Christian truth. They are the" . safe path on which we can meet with the holy kiss of unity of doctrine. But every one who travels outside of that path will be regarded by us as incapable of forming the centre around which to gather the members of the orthodox Catholic Church. But if haply any of the Western Bishops have doubts regarding any of their doctrines, and wish to meet, let them meet and discuss them every day if they please. We have no such doubts regarding the tradition and unalterable doctrines of religion and moreover, reverend Fathers being a question of an Ecumenical Council, it surely does not escape your memory that the Ocumoni- coal Councils were convened in other fashion than as his Holiness has convened this. If his Holi- ness the Pope of Rome had respect to Apostolic equality and brotherhood, it were fitting that (as an equal among equals in point of dignity, but first by canonical right in rank of his see) he should have directed a separate letter to each of the Patriarchs and Synods of the East, not in encyclical and dictatorial form to impose it as though he were lord and master of all, but as a brother to brethren equal in honour and station, to ask them if, how, where, and under what conditions they would agree to the assembling of a Holy Council. This being so, either do so, too, recur to history and the General Councils in order that on historical grounds may be restored the much longed- for true and Christian unity or we will again content ourselves with continued prayers and supplications for the peace of the whole world, the security of the Churches of God, and the union of all Christendom j but, under such circumstances, we assure you with sorrow that we consider the convening of the Council vain and fruitless, and also this document which you have brought. Fourth Priest.- Is prayer alone, when, she Esq restore unity ? If a man is sick, even when we, expect the hearing to come from God, and for this odd offer earnest prayers and supplications., yet we neglect not to provide for him physicians, and remedies. The Patriarch Speaking of healing in comparison with spiritual things, only the Omniscient founder and professor of his own Church, Christ the Lord, knows of a certainty who it is that is sick - how grievous the sickness is-what is the form of the disease, and what the corresponding remedy. Wherefore we again repeat there is great need of prayer, fervent and unceasing prayer, to our Lord, who is love itself, that He, will inspire all with love to God and all that leads to salvation. Having thus spoken, his Holiness ordered the Protosyncollns (who had sat next him and interpreted his words in French to take the document from the desk and give it back to the agent of Monsignor Brnnoni who had delivered it is and so rising up they gave the due reverence, and having received a kind farewell from his Holiness, they left the room and departed, accompanied as far as 'the States by the Protopyncellus.
