-ALLEGED EEHIAH ACTIVITY. — . — , ? ^ When the dynamite fiend is stalking in so many places at once it is not surprising that he should iilso make his horrible appearance in Ireland. The difference is that while elsewhere the perpetra tors oS: these senseless atrocities are treated as the mere criminals they are, in Irelaud they are dig nified into national conspirators, with the very obvious inteafrj oil course, oS! damning in the eyes of: all decent people the Irish National cause. So because there has been an attempted dynamite outrage in Dublin, £ol3ov?ed by a murder, wo hear again of 'Fenian activity in Ireland,' oil the ' Murder of a Feniasi by hi3 comrades,' and yet again o£ ' Much excitement in Dublin over the renewed activity o£ the Fenians.' That every eiijrfc would be made by tbe Tory press to magnify this affair, what ever it may really signify, into another outbreak of Fenianism, another proo£ o2 the hopeless lawlessness and treachery of the Iiish people, goes without saying, but we really think our press might leave these sensational head ings of their doubtful cablegrams out, and let tbe latter tell their own tale, which they do for the mo3tpait with a most nnmistakeable Tory twango We can only hope that the Herald o£ yesterday (Wednesday) with, its startling headlines as abo7e did not frighten the venerable Sir Henry Parkes into a fib, or make him dream a horrible nightmare of fresh ' ghosts'' and Fenian conspirators. As for the outrage itself, to be paralleled to-day by similar incidents in every capital in Europe, it only proves that there are lawless, violtnt mev, enemies of God and man, in Ireland as elsewhere, or if it proves any thing more, who mainly are responsible for it but the Tories themselves?
