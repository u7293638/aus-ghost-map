The other day one of the leading ohiefs of tbe Sioux sent a letter to Washington, arraigning the Government 1 for its treatment of his people, and demand- ; Ing justice. The chief's name is White Ghost, and the dooument rather startled tbe i Commissioner of Indian Affairs by tbe vigorous, logical, and even elegant language in which it was couched. White Ghost had discovered his Indians were being swindled by the local agent at the Beservation, and^hc made such a trenchant exposure of the whole affair that investigation must follow. | The Chicago World's Fair grounds were I visited on April 7 by a series of tornadoes, | which ripped and tore the fancy buildisgs 1 In course of ereotion, and scattered them on all sides.
