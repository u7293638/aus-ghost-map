A 2DE30 HYS1SSY Sirango Stsns throwing Acc'OHDixc to lite correspondent of a. paper coiiHiilitrahie interest has been aroused in ]>ul>bo by tlio report that missiles, .--ucti as brickbats, pieces of wood and iron, scraps of mortar, etc., were being thrown by unseen hands at and around a newly-erected residence in a suburb of Dubbo, Xewlown. In addition to these rccklc?S proceed ings strange tappings at the window**, aud performances on the bell and knocker ha.l varied the source of alarm, no signs of human agency being visible. Tho disturbance commenced on Tuesday- night last week and oc curred on each of the following threo evenings. Flying niece'- of brick were also seen in broad daylight, at 11 o'clock in the forenoon, and early in the afternoon. On several occasions the knocking-i also occurred in the daytime. The owner removed the bell, but has replaced it, hoping to have an opportunity of detecting the source of trouble. The disturbances have been witnessed in some phase or another by 15 or lt> people, including members of the police force. On Sunday numbers visited the spot and held consultations over the scattered missiles, but no abnormal manifesta tions took place. Around the en closure arc several patches of shrubby undergrowth, which would afford -?belter to any evil-disposed persons ; but there appears to be a total absence of motive, and the phenomena havo not abated in consequence of the efforts to ensure detection. Tho explanations anil suggestions of visitors have been numerous and combined with the worry of the affair prove embarrassing to tho proprietor of the premises, who is not quite sure whether ho would not rather have the ghost alone to contend with. JCo one has been actually struck by the missiles, although narrow escapes liavo occurred.
