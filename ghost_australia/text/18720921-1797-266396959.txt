L He looked pallid as a ghost, and I thought he was dying, for there was a sad flickering light in his :dark eyes that,- young as I was, I had had the -misfortune to witness, on several dreadful occasions. I seized an empty quart pot,-rushed to'a neighbpnng waterhole, tilled the ' vessel iind poured' some blessed drops down his parched throat. After a fe'w seconds he revived wonderfully.' He strotched outhis weak-hand, folt for mine, pressed it, and with inexpressible sweetness he whispered, " I was sure yon ^ould come aud tha t kept me alive." " But," said I,- " in Q-od's name what is this? What is wrong with your head?" He strove to undo the bandage. I assisted him, and a ghastly wound was revealed near the base of the skull. " Merciful Heaven!" I exclaimed, " this is murder. I'll go at once for Dr. Owen, and ' bring the Commissioner too;' I shan't be twenty minutes.". But his fingers grasped me strongly, and his voice rose to a pitch of agony. "Do not stir, do not stir," he said, " if you go it will be you who are my murderer. Sit down, I implore you." I did sit down, and he~kept my hand in his for a long time, uutil, as I thought he had dropped off to sleep.' But the moment I moved, his eyes were upon me, so I continued for some time at his side. At length he said with earnest expression, " I know your name's B—-, call me Herbert if you like. Can you ; Btay with me for a day or two?' " Can you think I would leave you in this state?'' said I,. " but why not have the doctor ?" " I was in an Hungarian Campaigu," he replied, " with my friend Czeruy, and I saw some service. The best and only treatment for wounds dealt by a sharp instrument is cold water." For wounds dealt by a sharp instrument !'' I exclaimed, rising hastily, " then it was an attempted murder?" "Yes, B , it was. A fearful case, too, but I ask you not .to enquire into it. Let me assure you that much evil and no possible good might follow if I told you the mystery." " Be it-as you will," I roplied," you are in a dangerous position, and unless you bocome worse, I will obey you." "I shall get well, he said, I am confident of that; but as accidents may occur, let me make you iny confidant in a small matter. Under the left top of the stretcher there is a hole in which I have placed the gold; should a certain accident occur you willtake it, pay yourself all expenses (dou't beangry),-and-then-send-the proceeds of the rest to an address whichj shall giveyou sealed;"'-!;' • .

One afternoon I was closely inspecting the results of our " cradling," when a deep voice sang out, " Good-day mate !" I looked up and saw a man whom I hated at a glance. He was a; tall, lean, dark-complexioned fellow, without a hair on his face, and with a dark louring expression in his eye. ." Good day," said I; whose hole is this ? he asked. My mate's,'' said I (it was Herbert's holo)." " He's not working it," said he, "is he ill?" I looked at him, and by heaven I felt in my soul that Herbert's enemy was before mo I « Yes, he's ill," I said, " lie lives up there ; you don't want tojurnp his hole, do you ?" Where does he live ?" said the follow ; but I saw his wicked eyo glancing straight at the marquee. " If you wish I'll take you to him," I replied, for I fell a strong curiosity to see tho matter out.
