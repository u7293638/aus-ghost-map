The Turks, den j iris <\- four to women, 1 epititualisetbreeotheroftb,e products of their country the poppy head, the tobacco leaf, and the coffee berry. All three productions are, naturally, the best of their kind, but they are, by '1 Turkish genius, developed in a Darwinian way to something better than the outside world knows of elsewhere I Shakspeare makes Michael Cassio, prompted to drink by devilish lago, allege a weakness of head as an excuse from taking wine, and a wish that " courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment The wish was heard and answered by the Turks, whose coffee drinking customs were some fifty years afterwards introduced into England But not their coffee, unfortunately, nor their skilful manner of making or polite way of using it The coffee itself, in the berry state, might get occasionally abroad, but it would remain undeveloped all in aided by 'I Turkish talent. We can do but little or nothing with the material or the tools until the skilled workman comes Throughout Turkey the 'lurcomnnkuows how to concoct coffee, as throughout Russia the Russians know how to make tea, and the Germans how best to brew beer These be, all three of them, great branches of knowledge, which might be usefully added to a University education People of other lands may innocently suppose that they know something about these things, and in such belief may rest content Their pitiable ignorance is bliss to them in such matters, as it is to all of us in many others 5 The Turk has given, and yet gives in various was s, much trouble to the rest of the world We must therefore look about for any compensating benefits derived from him Chief among these we find that his country this Asia Minor has given us the poppy, and with it the wondrous power dwelling genii like, in the poppy head The Turks divide honours with other Asiatics in the use of opium, but Turkey has the higher claim as the original producer of it When everybody gets their rights, and rewards shall be justly distributed, what Bli in I he done to the discoverer of opium and its uses ' For this most valuable of all relieving powers to whom are we to say in Hamlets words, " for this relief much thanks ' Quite unknown is the benefactor to whom we owe the discovery that in all the wide world grows no plant under heaven the equal of the poppy in affording relief to suffering humanity None other gives like power of patient in durance to those dragging out existences of cancerous and incurable diseases to end the racing pain of which death seems to them so Yards. None other can similarly soothe anguish, give sleep to the sleepless, rest to the tortured, and blissful dreams of heavenly delights to the disappointed in aims and ambition, the crushed of spirit, and the hopelessly wretched The fields around Smyrna are bright with the flowers of this source of the king drag of the pharmacopoeia Nowhere does it grow to such perfection, and yield a juice of equal flavour in its morphine and narcotic extracts By the smooth flowing and classic Moles are gardens in which the Smyrmotes take their coffee and smoke their chibooks m meath saving silence To other resorts are inner rooms in which this evening relaxation may be brought to its happy ending This is to be found in the opium pipe in which the Turk has that blissful time of it which, if as epigrammatic as the French, he might call his good quarter of an hour " The true traveller will know his duties, The true traveller will know his duties, and try all things, that he may, as Scrip turally bidden, hold fast to that which is good. Having smoked this pipe of peace with the Chinese, he may do so with the Turks, as, for want of better occupation, I find myself doing Opium has been an old acquaintance made in early life during a neuralgic attack, to which it brought a blessed rest to the restless in the happiest of sleeps for years afterwards the blissful remembrance, remained of the wondrous dreams of that night's slumber, entailing, as they did, an exploration of Mahomet's seven heavens. To all other dreams, had before or since, this one of opium product stood out in a grandeur of contrast to which no words of comparison will stretch. M> guide joins-if he did not also prompt remain the suggestion of a puff at the opium pipes halcyon half hour to be procured for five piastres, with no fear of anything to follow but a partial loss of appetite for breakfast One whiff proves enough for me as an amateur and novice-a long drawn draught of bitter tasting smoke, of which one half is swallowed and the balance coughed out What has gone down to the lungs, though little, is, like Mercutios wound. quite enough The world goes from one as it falls away from those who go up in balloons Similarly I seem to go heavenwards with accompanying hours for aeronauts and music stranger than Wagner's Another planet is soon gained, in which all things are better, looking brighter coloured, sweeter to the taste, and more dulcet in Round than anything to be found on earth A time of joy is had here which seems to last for long 'Tis sad to wake up to find it all but an opium dream, to realize that one has been hut to where the fairies took Bonny Kill meats, and are similarly brought back only to find us in that "All that d bright must fade, The brightest ; it the (latest ; All this wheat was made But to be lost when Binotcat " And how clumsy and old world fashioned it now looks to be taking opium in this way in smoke through a long and cumbersome pipe. Let those in want of a mission find it in introducing to Turks and Chinese the blessing of the hypodermic syringe portable as a penknife By this means will be spread the useful knowledge of taking opium through the skin more easily and effectually than through the lungs Why should this boon to ds of the Western world be hidden under a bushel, and withheld from those who would make much of it' in this way might hope repus Something of the large opium deal she owes to Asia for that poppy head which, like the fabled head of the road, holds something he precious The Turks know the secret of growing a tobacco which is to the American production as the light champagne of 1 France is to the heavy stout of Dublin This most chute of tobaccos is a highly developed and unit realised thing in the weed was, and one in which the grosser qualities of it seem to have no part. It was this divine product winds extracted from Byron the exclamation, " Sublime tobacco " when he burst into song over it, as he did over the Snintnn wine, and over much Out. that was good only in his way of thinking, The golden leaves of tins tobacco are pressed into cakes or cut into fine shreds In the latter shape it is used largely for cigarettes, which form of smoking had here its birth and a long time of usage before its nn.,Â»""nlnnin""l. plum nn-li>-.i>riw.ll>ri> common adoption east where, and every where. in the shape of the cigarette, also, it obtained and holds that feminine patronage so generally given to it in Turkey, Greece, -Egypt, and elsewhere. America gave tobacco to the world, over which it exercises an influence potent as alcohol and powerful as an additional passes to our common nature Such a new power at the world should be studied, and its exercise cultivated if it cannot be controlled. 'J he better part in this world wide use of tobacco has been chosen by both the Japanese and the Turks These people are alike in using the weed in that lighter and finer form in which, like the tea is made by the Chinese, it may be said to cheer but not inebriate. Byron noticed this when he tells of tobacco as cheering the workman's rest " The Turk reduces tobacco smoking to a fine art, much as De Quincey proposed in that way to consider murder. Be spiritualists his tobacco, and having got . soul into it, he doubly purifies the soul in fashions purge torial It passes not his lips until it has passed first through fire and secondly through water-a purged and sublimated ghost of a smoke in which those accustomed to tobacco elsewhere can hardly recognise it. The coffee cup is with the Turk what the shake of the hand is with the English, and the exuberant kissing is with the French There are many who will think it the better fashion of the three, and who can account for such their taste in the matter This drink of welcome is brought to one in small brass cups, which might in size and appearance serve as thimbles for a giantess It is drank sugared, but without milk The small ness of the cup excuses the oft made request that one will have it replenished, which, aided by cigarettes, is the T Turkish idea of hospitality and sociality "Caivo Smarlo, which is the order for coffee at the East!', brings with it always a narglulehor bubble bubble water pipe These are in plenty about with those sitting at the tables and to use them is of Smyrna a fashions everywhere This pipe begins to commence at the bottom, in a decanter of water shaped as an hour glass or huge egg boiler From the lower division of it issues at the side a long indiarubber tube bound around in coloured silk thread At the top of this water holder is what resembles a brass pepper box with flat perforated top Un this grating, so to call it, 13 laid a cake of the golden leaved tobacco of the thickness of a biscuit and on top of this cake the attendant now places two or three pieces of burning charcoal I may now begin at bubble bubble smoking to do so I put to my mouth the large amber mouthpiece found at the other end of the indiarubber tube This mouthpiece is of the diameter of a walnut with a central hole large enough for a stick of macaroni to go down Its size seems to heat all my efforts to draw anything through it, for I am supposed to pull up through the water and through the tube the smoke derivable from the burning cal c of tobacco away down below I might as well try to blow air into a trombone or Scotch bagpipes at a first effort, The unwonted distention of one's Ups by the large mouthpiece wastes inhaling power, the large mouthpiece wastes inhaling power, as so much breath is drawn in at each side of it. I should properly close my mouth all around it, and to make what girls call "a cherry of pointing lips. But all such doing would come by practice only, and my patience is not equal to it, nor is my perseverance I do at last get some smoke into the mouth, but it is not satisfactory, and indeed very much otherwise It is mild, tasteless smoke to begin with, and it has been drawn through water, and made cold, and pulled up a long pipe, in which any strength or good ness of tobacco Day our has been lost as it lingered by the way-the long way it has had to travel I am reminded by such character of bubble bubble smoke of the old woman of the village who begged of the curate that she might have a front seat in church " Where I sit is five years back, she complained "I get your words only after they have gone through those who sit in the front seats, and they are 'pore stuff by the time I get them " This seemed to be equally applicable to the margined a smoke It had to travel down wards into the water, and then through the water, and then so far upwards from it that it merited, quite as much as the curate's due course, the like character to anyone under cased to its taste, Anatolia is not a country for those of a tender cuticle The Sybarite whose sleep was troubled by the doubled rose leaf in his mattress stuffing would have harder times of it in fairy rue. the troubles of one a rest nee superior to insect powders, and neither change of hotels nor rooms affords respite This latter word brings to mind Poe's use of it in double form, followed by nepenthe ' Something of that sort, I fear, will be required to get any sleep The strong light of two large candles kept burning all night fails to frighten away the enemy. Wild creatures only are to be scared away by light and fire, and these carnivora of Smyrna are very tame of their kind-quite too familiarly so The attempt to get Sleep has to be given up so far as the bed will help to it As I regard its now forsaken pillows, I find myself using the words of an American projectors pros pectus anrtBasnig, "There's millions in it I go down stairs nightly to the porter a chair in the stone paved hall, and lengthen out its seat by the addition of stools On such substitute for a bed, I done at last, and dream of Bishop Hat to and his troubles in by-gone haunted castle by the Klane 'The cookery of all the Eastern world is after one fashion, known to us mostly as that of the French It has run down from Asia into Europe, and finishes there at France the channel stopping its further progress, england adopts the northern world fashions, with my blessings on it for doing so All through Asia this Eastern world cookery prevails-the many dishes, the fasting until mid-day and the two meals only during the 24 hours the daybreak cup of coffee and biscuit come regularly everywhere throughout the east, but can hardly be accounted as a meal Great Britain carries the day with its dress fashions even in far off Japan is evening dress of the I English fashion to be seen But British fashion stale its influence with these exterior chances. It affects not the cookery, nor what is cooked, nor the number of meals, nor the time of taking them As a table matter it is noticeable here that area chokes replace potatoes-replace them as far as the table goes, for every one cannot relish this very earthy and tobacco flavoured even sent Trouble has visited Smyrna in every shape and form at one time or another in its long life If linn happy n nhiLtue city and one life It has been a plague city, and one much affected by earthquakes.

The Melos is a name which must be written before I can understand aright what this one of the two rivers of Smyrna is called It has, he says, no spelling to it-it is just one word the Melos life would write it if he had ink, but he never could handle pencil, "because he was never taught to draw and only to write with a brush-now if he had but a brush * 'J here rivers are but streamlets-the Meres and the Gucdu.

The narrowness of the streets continue the one tramway of Smyrna to the broad Marina or quay, so that these water channels to a few streets are a rebel to the monotony of them.

J le says, ' Come and see more (mu Mugnesm ' The novelty of the mixture of such names was very funny). We recall magness in a chemical sense only, and mostly in cornices tion with rhubarb, and the taste of it as a white powdered covering for pills. This new association of it with a womanly name was bewildering for a while, and it was not until one had considered it that the question came as to what it meant. "Magnesia," it is explained, "is an up country town, 40 miles distant, and known as asylum in Homer's time-taking such names from a neighbouring mountain, Niobe is a rock-cut womanly figure, 20ft. high and 'Jit across the shoulders, standing in a niche of the rocks by the roadside, with head in a bowed attitude. The rock above her is porous, the water filtering through it continuously in drips, which, failing on the head and running down thence over the face, give the figure the appearance of perpetually weeping. It is of unknown antiquity, and is now as Homer saw and wrote of it " This was quite a discovery, and made one anxious and inquiring about the subject of it Magnesia or Manisa, for it is known by both names, lies between the ancient Lydia and Pim pa. backed by Mount bicycles, on a spur of which Niobe sat and wept herself into the state of stone in which she is now to be seen. Some rock cut tombs about the figure are supposed to be those of her murdered churches. My guide gives the story is heard from many whom he has accompanied on the journey. Niobe was a matron too proud of her progeny. Iliographers differ, as usual, making these his few as five and and as many as twenty. The latter would seem most probable us a cause of motherly pride if one did not remember that the domestic hen makes most home over the smallest number of ducks. Niobe shouted one Latona, who had but a boy and a girl, named Apollo and Diana. The NO were incited by her, in Lady Machet li fashion, to avenge Niohe'u insult- Apollo to kill her son and Diana her daughters. Niobe, thus cruelly bereaved, wandered for ever weeping until her salt tears had the common effect of mineralised water, and brought about her petrifaction, Nature, sympathetically, yet weeping over her.
