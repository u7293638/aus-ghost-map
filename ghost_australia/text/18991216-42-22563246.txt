AFTER ALL. The brooding ghosts of Australian night have gone from the bush and town; My spirit revives in the morning breeze, though it died when the sun went down; The river is high and the stream is strong, and the grass is green and tall. And I fain would think that this world of ours is a good world after. Henry Lawson ("ln the Days When the World Was Wide").
