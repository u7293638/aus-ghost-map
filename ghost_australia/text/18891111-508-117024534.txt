Garden Memories. i, garden old stretches down toward the eea ; The flowers untended, the wild thorns growing \ 5'be ens burn* hot ; and the wind from the lea Now and again is restlessly blowing; Trying to wake in this laud of death Some eong of the past ; a scentless breath, Of laughing roses, and lips bo fair, And sunbeams playing 'mid golden hair. '?/ The oleanders lie withered and broken ; From the thioket hard by comes no thrushes' Bong. Would a. ghost not rise if a word be spoken, Or a step resound the 'dark alleys along P A ghostly hand full of fair withei'd flowers, Scattering its burden pale In showers, Like sea-foam driving upon the ware, To cover a long-forgotten grave. The sun, and the wind, and the rain come thither To the garden old that stands by the sea; The Sowers dream, and blossom, asd wither; And the wild hawk borers 'over the lea. Bat a fair head sleeps in the bosom of death ; The red lips -will never again draw breath. All are at rest now ; naught left to show The love and the sorrow of long ago.
