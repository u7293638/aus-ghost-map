Torture by Water. One of the Chinese modes of punishment, especially when a oonfesiion is wanted from a criminal, is to plaoe him where a drop of water will fall upon one oertain spot on his shaven crown for hoars, or days, if neoessary. _Tha torture thisinfliota is proved by an expe dience of Sandow, the strong man. ’ When, he was In Vienna a few years ago a school teacher bet him that he would not be able to let a half-litre of water drop upon his hand until the measnre was exhausted. A half-litre is only a little more than a pint. Sandow laughed at the very idea of his not being able to do this. So a half-litre measnre was prooured, and a hole drilled in the bottom just sufficient to let the water escape drop by drop. Then the experiment began, Sandow laughed and ohatted gaily at first. The schoolmaster kept oount upon the nnmber of drops. At about the 200 th Sandow grew a little more serious. Scon an expression of pain orossed his faoe. With the entrance into the third hundred his hand began to awell and grow red. Then the skin hurst. The pain grew more and more exorudating.
