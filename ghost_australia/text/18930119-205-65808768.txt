La Mi of OmissiQL Dr MAncater E. SANnSTEL It in' :se thing you do, dear, i.tne thing you leave undone, Which gives you a bit of a headache At tie setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, Thue flower you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. Thie stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, Tihe bitof heartlsome counsel, You are hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, ''ihe gentle and winsome tone, Th.t you hal no time nor thought for, Withi tror ule enough of your own. These little acts of kindncss, So esly out of mind, These lhances to ber. angelos, Whijich even miortals find Thee csmme in night and silence. Eaclh chill, reproachful wraith, 'Vithen Ihoe is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too lshort, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To sufter our slrow compssnion Thalt tarries until too nlate. And ito not the thing to do, dear, It's the thinlg you leave ucndone, Which gives you thie bitter hicadacho At the setting of the sun.
