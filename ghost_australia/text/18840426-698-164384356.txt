[?] New South Wales Coursing Club. BOWEAL, Wednesday. The opening meeting of the above club was commenced at Bridge Park, Bowral, to-day, under most 'favourable circumstances in every respect, except as regards attendance. The weather was fine and warm, yet it was not hot, as the bracing air of the mountains tempered the warmth, of the sun. -The ground was in that condition which conraing men ; designate ' good going,' eo that none of the competing grey - ! hounds were injured. The hares, generally speaking, were : stout-going ones, so that the percentage of kills was un | usually small,- only those unaccustomed to the Cbverts f falling victims' to their canine, pursuers. The arrange-. [ ments for the conduct of the meeting were of the most ! complete., and satisfactory nature, and ..all present ; enjoyed themselves thoroughly. The- rulings of Mr. } Gatenby, the judge, except in a coiple of instance?, 'met \- with no dissent, bnt in those twses the difference of opinion may -perhaps be accounted for by the fact th&t; the dissenters . saw the courseB from a different standpoint! Tfttyk slipped I with his accnstbmcd ability^ and the one or t'wo'cagos where ; the dogs were nnsigh fed from the slips w ere brought about r by ths^inevennees of the ground in front of the' slipping lane. Mr. C. C. Skarratt, as slip-steward, was most'inde : fatigableinhis exertions, Bternly demandmg, punctuality on ; the part of the trainers in ' bringing their dogs --n to the : slips. Mr, Hmy Lamb, as flag, $d . . make a tingle.!, error, and ' no greater compliment :cau be paid to that gentleman;- and Mr. J. Perry. Jthe recently appointed secretary, prove! both energetic and obliging in the discharge of his duties. The catering arrangements wen excellent. £he 8port 't^^ gen£rally w;as very good, most of'.thel'm^.b^i^ of .tli^VBh^ht-backe^i^iier, 't|te. wesk'on^^ing.'il^Vexcepfao^; ^todinihe ' 40 coiuree whicn were ^nn donng ^e day. .

Patience waai;-\alao/ very onlacky in . ^ng pat. down by L^va^ej-.' in a scramhling trial after a weak hare. , Bf^a also .'rin. with ' conspicuous dnartness, and willlbe hard- tolieat.'.£oth of JSk.'R. L; Tpoth'a doge— Tevi6t&ale; and Triumvir, ran! as conning as . foxes, the exbibition of knowledge on uie part of the latter being most marked. The Derby,— After a ve^y even race, Polestar drew out for tbe turn, and put in some goocl work before Tempter Rot an opening. Polestar tired towards thg-end of the tnal, but Tempter was well ^atan when the bare escaped, to ; cipvcr. Cairngdnn. was faster than Tn6tattr to the hare; bint ,the }atter, getting in opening/^beigan to; score ; freely; but Mrrt^opers dogjsaine agam, and had won , . comfortably whetiiftie hare tescaped to the;' nome. Unrar- i ttin^ely the dogs' gtrf -m &\- JniMter haw Jying in the ppea,1 , terms, however, Larpent, never «dlowed the ghost-of a ah^ir to Hamlet in a good spin after a racing hare. Cobweb, waa quite four lengths foster than Lochinvar, and Scored sevwal times before the latter obtained an opening in a conrse of terriCo length. Locbinvar out-stayed and well beat Cob web, who tired in nothing towards the end. It w#a a severe trial for tlie winner. Country Lad wag onaigh£$i fiom slips, and Lord Lyon _ had matters all his 6fna way for a time. Once on terms of equality, Country Lad made some pretty exchanges tQl he fell in tne last of agool trial; Lord Lyon showed superiority, and had ! a little to spate when the hare escaped. Though L9yeller got .iho lead and reached the hare first, he ran out so wideat. tha tum that when Tyendale went on in.pos»e8sion, he was 20 lengths behind. Leveller, however, obtained command, but Tyendale raced past, and had plenty in hand when ths hara escaped. Libetator, going great guns from slipa^' led Tyningbame six or seven lengths, and going on in command put together some tolling points ; and, after losing bis place, raced past in grand style, and won a brilliant trial alter a demon of a hare, wtaieh escaped to cover. ? Havod completely outpaced Terrara, to whom he gave but oda cpeniny in a smart trial after a racing hare. ' Havoc W]HBt with great determination. , V ' Eridoe Park Cup,— Maid of Oban and My Ls^y were both temporarily unsighted fiom slips, bat' on sighting game the Maid put oil all steam, atiA going in her beautiful style never allowed My Lady a chance in a short and merry race to oorer. l^inoastriaa was about a length faster than Tribute in a long raos, but for his coming down a cropper ; after the tura TribUte went on alone, wrenched twice, killed, and wonf before , Lancastrian had time to get . on terms a^aini It was a very unsatisfactory trial for Lancastrian. Capri La Belle II. ran an undecided, in which, bom grey-i houtds went uncommonly well, the ex-Waterloo Cup winner being very slow from the slips. Crabtrea went out of slips very quickly, and led Harry Up four lengths, but in making an eager drive at his game hfi-catne down an awiul purler, and Hurry Up, oommandinir her here in clever style, picked ,np and won comfortably. It was a most unlucky trial for Crabtree. On a strong inside Corrie Roy just led Mornington, but once in possession the latter was not to be denied, and using his hare yery olevor|y be only allowed Mr. Cooper's frog a couple of openings, anil wound up a smartly run trial with a meritorious kill. It was one of the smartest trials of the day. Capri and La Belle II. then ran their undecided; The latter led the crack four lengths, and never allowed Capri togive thS Ic^&t; assistance, as after using her game several times ehe picked it up and won. Capri did not score a single point of merited and appeared to have lost his pace, or have run tanning. 1 ;* The Bowral Stakes.— 1 rom a long slip Coralieled. a couple of lengths, but was slightly favoured. A, gocd exchanging course ensued, in wMch Teviotdale had the most to say. Teviotdale killed.^' A very' short trial then took place between Patience and Levanter, the latter leading several lengths, and. tfce, fonnar killing off the turn, and putting out her chance by. her killing powers. It was a long and exchanging coucae after a dodging hare, between Palmtiower ahd Lilac. There was little to chooee between them aa 'to clevaniesa; but HCr^ Park's little bitch had the lead np. It was give and take all through, and the points must have been very erea when the flag went up for Lilac. Lady Lydia, after show ing Gladys her heels, was completely outpaced afterwards by Gladys, who UEcd her hart i-ut tvnoe beforett escaped to covert, Hygeia, going in great form from stipp led Lin-^ goist four lengths, and pat together a strong acora of tolling, points before linguist obtained a cbance. HygeIa, how ever, wonld not be denied, and, again getting in command, she worked her hare beautifully to cover, winning her trial like an artist. Wild Wave was several lengths in front when -the. hare was reached. A. give-and-take trial fol- ' lowed, in which W ild Wave appeared to do as.maoh work as Myrtle. Wild W»ve wound up a good odortolqr killing oK Myrtle's tun. Ihe flag went np for Myrtle. Talwang drew oat three lengths for- the turn, and went on for the second, when Meualina got in and scored aeveral times. Talwang, however, came again, .and. when puaa escaped he was . a good winner. Bega ma^o . a, ahooUng example of Sardonyx, who. was a trifle fast^ from slips. but who could hardly get an opening' after from Mr. Blaaa&'fc clever little bitch. Bega commanded her game in splendid style, and never once, rusted, although, often on tho very sent. Triumvir ran a bye. , r- ? The Oaks.— Three lengths separated Prudent Jane froul Ladylike when the latter reached the .hare; hat, in a splendid trial after a dodging hare. Prudent Jane .was far too clever for Ladylike, -and terminated a grandly inn' trial with a very clever ' kill. Lapis LaztJi lea, and well beat Cassandra, who .wag just ' beginning to wipe out the early work when4he hare escaped to covjerr ' It was a slovenly ran (rial.. Plumage had no chance what ever with Lanfeqnenet, ^rho was bpth faster andmora clem:' than the former, and in' addition wound np her cleverly run trial with a fine kill. It was a one-sided trial betweea' Beehive aid Leading Light, the fanner being a long way faster and more clever than Leading Light, who showed jpromhiently but twice in ' a course of more Uutn average The Derby.— First Ties.— From a very even slip Cairngorm led Polestar five or Bix lengths, and had 'no difficulty whatever :in .settling the pretensions of Poler'^ star, toth dogs going veiyp wide- at th^. turoa. Lord Lyon led Larpent oyer, a dozen lengths, ' jand only allowed the latter an occasitmal opening in a fairish tiial after a racing hare to covert. There was little to choose in point of *peed- betwefen--' Lwhinvar' * knd Tynedale, but after openipg points the - former shoWal marked superiority over Tyn&Jale; in a moderate trial frfter a straightgoing hare. Contrary to general expactattftna. Havoc raccd away from Liberator,' and only allowed tha latter to score once. ' In a racing: trial after a grand Mre, which escaped to covert, Havoc^performed welL ,s Bridge Park Cup.— First Tiea. — Though Tribute led three lengths and made a .strong, beginning, the Maid o£ Oban warmed to her worlc, 1 wait, with her accustomed fire and cleverness, and whe& the hare escaped to covert she had a good balance 111 hand. ' La Belle II. raced a way from Blips very 'smartly,' and led Harry' Up thfee lengths;' and, after one exchange, dash&d; into her gahie^w^hnlng m the most decisive manner.;. It wasa poor trial Tor the loser. Mornington ran a bye. \\.VJ CofratStake8.— First T^es.^Levanterv^asA couple oC^ lengths faster to the hare, and &cored; twice, when Teviot dale nicked in, and aBeumin^ selfish . charge ,of , affairs* wiped out ^the early pon^Bv^w^ndl^jilp1 a hiSl^ t^l wittiL a fine kill and a win. Ial&fc; ^ wits ' fasten Joan .Gladys, and made all the opening^points hiit a clever and strong-going hare enabled the latter to. wipe oat th^^inta against her and ta:se a winning flag. Lilac tired towards the aid, and Gkdys killed. 1 Myrtle *was perhaps a length faster than Hygeia, and reaching her hs§a ahe toolc -010' pbskeetdon, and was knocking her hare aboat in great styla when fhe came down very severely, completely extinguish ing faercha&ces;,as Hy^da hadtime to wipe out the jpoints made against her When the hare^flcaped. It Was bad. lack for the tloser. Talwang ran clean away from Triumvir, who looked on and galloped in the tear. never once making , an effort. Bega rania bye and obsed the day's oouraing. -7' ThetoUoiringiare thefullparticalflrsr— ?'

There were a large number of vehicles on the ground;ssd among the assemblage was a good sprink ling of ladies, who seemed to enjoy the sport amazingly. Tie sport -was again good, most of the courses being of the legitimate character, flul^ trials being the exception. Mr. Edward Lee, the president of the dab, anl his fellow stewards, again worked bard, and their efforts added not a little to the excellent arrangements of the meeting, which on ibewfcfile totlfet fee pf0h6Ml-ie& & great ellipse. The losers fcoretheir. reverses like true sportsmen, while the fortunate ©nes,; though naturally jubilant, wished their less lucky brother coursers ^'better lack next time;' Mr. R. L. Tooth, the libeyal owner of the fridge Park coursing ground not only provided the game, bnt in his modest way did his utmost to make the visitors to his grounds comfortable. Mr. E. Gatenby, the judge, again discharged his duties eatisfac torUy.t&d; though ther£ wOre ' instances where hii adjadica tjons did cot^neet with general,, approval they were on the whole Wke'd by that Men . insight which long experience in the saddle alone can give. .

Cooper's Cairngorm and Mr.'H. E. 'Iiord^s Lord Xyon. The Oaks fell to Mr. E. Bladon's beehive, who fairly ran oyer everything that was elipped with her ; and. ns that astute trainer also carried ofi the Bowral Stakes with Bega, lie may be sail to have had more than bis share of thb'good things. The Beaten Dogs Stokes was won by My Lady, who represented 'the interests of Mr. H. M'Quade. After the termination of the day's , eport a number of the company met in tbe luncheon tent, when Mr. R. L. Tooth, in en appropriate speech, proposed the health of Mr. Edward Lee, president of the' dub, and -winner of the Eridge Park Cap, which Was received with great enthusiasm, and to wluch Mr. Lee suitably responded.
