Archdeacon MacCul Iagli.who was visibly ali'ected, then gave a: most impressive address. He said .'it was.a painful and solemn duty to address a few words to those present in reference to him whose mortal re iiKiins lay before them, but whose spirit was witli the just. He spoke of him.as-a friend of. years ? and one who Minder difficulties and painful circumstances had walked in the path of faith and duty. Most of-, them had. known him as a citizen, some, as a pastor and all us a friend. Tliey had heard his words, words '.f peace and of hope arid of charity arid the' better and brighter world above. They should remember that the day was coming when they again might meet him- and :when, they would have to give an-aecountof the deeds done in the body and show how they had , regarded the message "recorded" by a~faithfTtl~ servant of tlie' Lord Jesus Christ. - -He had not only spoken.. !th'at- wliiclrwas.-- right-but1 had walked himself- in the narrow- wavy and left those behind an example how they .might follow his steps in - humble faith". and' dcep humility as he followed' tlie footsteps 'of. his Mdstei-.: To those engaged, 'in the'rairiistry there! was a special message... -They" remembered .!t"hat,.like him; tkeyrmust* pass away,-aiHbt-o-some the time was not far distant. May they be able in the solemn ' hour itr which they were called before the judgment seat to render a faithful account, and,'like him,- be ."welcomed to the bright eternal dwelling where "pain and sorrow, weariness and sickness and deafeb never readied. May they meet.him in; that home and rejoice; with him with joy ' inexpressible,, .and re':" mc-riib'er Go'd's message,' L'ilbor "#hile 'you', can, for the night cometh "wlten , no man" may work," aiid "in" this" life" "try' to :press^ more earnestly in the path . on which the Saviour walked. To those whom he had left behind they extended sympathy; he had earned it, and they deserved it. He had passed from amongst them, but his memory remained in their hearts, and encouraged them to do that which was right, and warned them against that which was evil. He (the speaker) regretted that owing to the call of duty he had been absent from his dying bed, but the last message he had received was a message of hope and faith. He would see him by-and-bye, and would only say good-bye till he met him in. "tlie home to come. When they met there would be no farewell, aad there the wicked ceased from troubling and the weary were at rest. He had known him longei; than anyone there, and his testimony now7 was .that"- lie was aj-.gqqd" man and full of faith and of the Holy .Ghost.
