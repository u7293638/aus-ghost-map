The ingenious writer who the other day published a defence of Jezebel in a area defunct periodical has probably not succeeded in making many converts to his new of the Queen's character People will probably continue to use her name as a typical description of the female villain, just as if nothing had been done to rehabilitate her bull, we could in any case have parted with the theory of Jezebel's wickedness, holding as Me do so strong a card in the person of Aliab There are cases, however, in which the good or evil character of a historical personage has definitely associated itself with the picturesque in history, and to redraw the figure or to repaint it in a lighter shade is to spoil the whole composition of the picture This is emphatically the case w however the hand of the greatest of the masters has been at work and, whatever transfer nations of other historical events and personalities may be effected, we ought really) to insist that the "Histories" of Sh UtOipairo be left alone.

The Thane of Fife, it will be remembered, is the first to discover the murder Who knows that he may not have committed its He arrived at Macbeth's castle in the early morning, found the porter drunk, and therefore incapable of noting anything suspicious in his hearing or acts, in a after a short conversation with Miobeth and LennoT, declares that the King had bidden him to call timely on him, and on this plea enUn Duncan's dumber, whence he speedily emerges acclaiming, with cries of what may Late been merely simulated horror, that the King has been murdered, there is not a scintilla of evidence in the earlier scenes of the play to show that Duncan did in fact ask Macduff to call him early in the morning;, and the whole circumstances of the case are fraught with suspicion against him Still, we confess that we should greatly regret the promulgation and esta Kills ment of the theory that Miciluff was the ltd murderer of the aged King of Scotland, and that the good name of his rival his rested for all the years under beclouded an unjust accusation Tor would now be too late even for the New shakespeare society to adapt the tragedy to that ceased view of the field, and even if they could do so we doubt whether it would be in the power to make us dramatically interesting a figure of the Thane of Fife as the poet has succeeded in making of Unit of Macbeth It is to be observed, indeed-and this constituted our main objection to those rewriting of history that they are almost always attended with an artists loss No one am mountain, we think, dear Henry "VTH. emerged from the hands of Mr Froude in a condition as attractive to the lot ors of the picturesque as that in which the historian found him as well might we say that a mansion of that Monarch s period loses nothing h) receiving the renovating attention of a nineteenth century restorer of the more resolute description The ancient chateau, like the con temporary) architect, did at least produce a series which was consistent with itself, and which possessed an individuality of its own , whereas the substitute which we are asked to put up with becomes in the architectural case, little better thou on "china modern residence," while, in the historical cite, it sinks to the level of that " portrait of a gentleman which, according to the familiar but express nephews, " might be anybody Who, for ci- stones, could prefer Professor Bccsl) s Tiberius, that worthy and slight) ascetic nuLtory i eternal, to the gloom) and blood) debauchee whose Suotonius has depicted for us in his island harom ?
