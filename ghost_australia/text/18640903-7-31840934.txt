THE GHOST AND THE DOG-TAX. TO THE EDITOR. I am, Sir, &c.;, JOHN BUNDALEER. Yutuputumantoona, August 1, 1864. Sir—The other night, as I was minding my flock, the ghost of Adalbert Chamisso, an old German poet, appeared to me. Of course I was a little frightened. but the ghost of his "Old Washerwoman" was there too, felling me he was the friend of poor folk, so I rallied my courage and looked in his face, wondering what communication he could have to make me. Of course s ghost understands every language, so lie addressed me in plain English as follows: — " Ain't you ashamed of yourself old fellow to pay tax for your dog ? The least thing you can do is to remonstrate with those fellows in Adelaide who make the laws, eo I will hand you the translation of a poem which I made, when still in my body, for a fellow circumstanced as you are now; and mind and send it to the law makers in Adelaide, and tell them, from me, that if they Trill consider a poor man's friend no better than a parcel of goods they must go, pack !" And then, the poet's ghost vanished; but I had a little chat with the ghost of his ?• Old Washerwoman" for nearly an hour afterwards. The most remarkable circumstance, however, is, that my dog, daring the visit of the ghosts, showed a deal of affection towards them.
