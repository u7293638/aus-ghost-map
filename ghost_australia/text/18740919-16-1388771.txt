Prudence Palfrey. By THOMAS B UI.LI ALDRICH fine piiMbhe from the Ki Ki \loil/lj~ยก ClIurLIt VIII THE I UISDX i, I 1ST TIME THIS brings my story again to that afternoon in May, when Prudence Palfrey made her appear mee at the cottage in Hoiscshoc 1 me, and was solicited by Salome to speak to the person, who had locked himself in the little room after the departure of the two deacons It was with an inexplicable sense of uneasiness that Pi silence crossed the library, and knocked softly on the panel of the little door The poison did not seem to hear the summons, at all events he paid no attention to it, and Pi dense knocked again "Iles gives' the least bit kind of bean pole soul, said S dome " Meb be he heard that, though she added more cautiously, "for he always boats when you don't s pose he will Do just speak to him, bone), he'll know you vice in a must ' Prudence put her lips down to the keyhole and called, " Parson V ibud I-its Pine won t ) you speak to me I ' He made no i response to this, and in the silence that ensued, broken only by the quick desperation of the two women, there was no sound as if he were preparing to undo the fastenings Prudence lose up with a half frightened expression on her countenance and looked at Salome " What can have happened I ' she BOHI hurriedly ' Lord o' mere) knows replied Salome, catch mg Pi ue's alarm " Don't stare at me in such a way), deal , 1m as nervous as within' " " Are you sure he is there a " Sarhu I all but see him gout' in, an' I have not been out of the room sence He must be there " Is he subject to vertigo, ever I " Dunno, said Salome, doubtfull) " I me m, does he ever faint ? " He did have a curious sort of spell two of or three weeks ago, an' Di Theophilus give him some medicine for it " " He has fainted, then ' Get a candle quick, Stop, Salome, I 11 go with you " Prudence was afraid to remain in the library alone She was impressed by some impalpable presence in the half darkness The shadows huddled together in the corners The long rows of books in their time stained leather bindings looked down sombrely from the shelves On the table was an open volume, with an lv ory paper cutter upon it, which he had been reading His frayed dressing gown lay across a chair in front of the table It seemed like some were d, collapsed figure, 17mg there All the familiar objects in the 100m had turned strange and woe begone in the twilight Prudence would not have been left alone for the world The two went out together for the candle, which Salome with a trembling hand lighted at the kitchen stove Then they flitted back to the library silently, with white sharp faces, like ghosts " What shall we do ?" " We must break in the door," said Prudence under her breath " You hold the candle " She placed her knee against the lower panel and pressed with all her strength The lock was old and rusty, and the screws worked loosely in the worm eaten wood work The door yielded at the second pressure and flew open, with a shower of fine dust sifting down from the hoteL The girl retreated a step or two, and, shading her eyes with the palm of her li and, peered into the darkened space. Nothing was distinct at first, but as Salome raised the light above Pi no s head, the figure of the parson suddenly took ships against the gloom He was sitting in an old f fashioned arm chair, with his set eno face bent over a y cot Etblo covered with green haze, which he held on his knees His left arm hung idly at his side, and the forefinger of his right hand rested lightly on the middle of the page, as if slumber had over taken him so, tending " Low so mercy, if the person has not gone to sleep I ' exclaimed Salome, stepping into the small compartment "Asleep i repented Prudence, the lcossmed color returning to her cheek Salome laid her hand on the poison"s aim, and then passed it quid ly over his for the id ' lies dead I ' cued Salome, dropping the candlestick The hour hand of the cuckoo clock in the hill at Willow block pointed out seven the toy by d popped out on the new low ledy-m front of the carved Swiss cottage, shook seven (lute like notes into the an, popped in again lustily, and the little door went to with a spiteful snap Mr Dent glanced at the time piece over the fire place in the sitting room, and wondered what it is detaining Pine She had gone to town on a shopping expedition shortly after dinner, and literary was mi born and n half-past tea time Emmy had brought in the tea urn and carried it off again. It was as if the sun dial had forgotten to mark the movements of the sun , the household set its clocks by Prudence For the last hour or two Mr Dent had been lounging i restlessly in the sitting room, now an itching up a book and trying to lead, now looking out on the lawn, and now vigorously poking the coals in the grate for it was one of those busy days which make a Ino comfortable in out delusive New England Vic) Mr Dent was revolving in his final how he should be oak to Pi police the intelligence of his son Hawkins dismissal, and more especially in what terms he should confess his own post in the transaction "W hut will Fine say was a question he put to himself a dozen times with out eliciting a satisfactory) reply He was a little afraid of Pinero had the tender sweet bet with which a pin c woman implies most men He could imagine what she would have said three years ago, but she had altered in many respects since then ; she body own quieter and less impulsive That one firm) of passion in which she had confessed her love for John Dent did not seem credible to her grandson as he looked back to it As a in either of com Fe, she would be indignant at the action of the de irons, and would prob ibl) not oppt ov o of the steps he had taken to bring Mr Dilhngliim to River mouth , but she would not stones at him He almost wished she would stones at him, for the finger was at BO unmanageable on the look of invite i open itch which she knew how to bring into ha i i) eyes The cuckoo in the Swiss churches hopped out again on the large, and vines just sounding the half hour in his brisk, business like way), when Pi odours opened the drawing room door "I thought you find inn oil for good, said Mr Dent, using from his eli in then he stopped and looked at her attentively "Why, Pine, what is the matter I "The person -Pc science could not finish the sentence 'Iho nervous strength that had sustained but through the recent council gave way , she sank upon the sofa and but led her face in the cushions "She has band of ahead), thought Mr. Dent He crossed to the sofa and rested his hands softly on her shoulder "Pine, my door but, you must be reasonable li had to come sooner or latter , he could not go on pi reaching for over, yon know He is a very old man now, and ought to take his ease He will be all the happier with the soles of the parish on his 11 miles " "All the happen, yes '" "And we 11 have him up to Willow bookcases , he shall have a room here ' Prudence lifted her face beseechingly "Oh, you don't know ' you don't know I" Bite cued "He is dead The died this afternoon, sitting in his cellar Ah ! it was so dreadfully sudden I and Prudence covered her eyes with her hands, as if to shut out the scene in the library Mr Dent was greatly shocked He leaned against the mantelpiece, and Btm ed v me until) at Prudence, while she related what had happened at Horseshoe lane She had completed her pinch uses in I was, md was on the way home when she met Miss Blydeiibingh, who told her of the deacons visit to Pilton Hawkins to request his i eHignation Know tug that the poor old man was unprepared for no) such proposition, she had turned back and hastened down to the poison age, to say and do what she could to comfort him in his pt ob able distress Then she and Soloing, alone there in dark, had found him dehad in the cellar Ah I Mr Dent left his tea untasted 1 He had the horse saddled, and rode over to town He was greatly shocked And Deacon Zeb Ivy only, that night, as he stood for a moment beside the ei echo in which the little ewe lamb lay nestled in its blankets, was a miserable man He crept off to the spare room in the attic- whoioho vi is the doing a tourney at y but not unprecedented exile with the conviction that he was little better than a murderer "I hope Parson Wiburd will forgive me my film e in the business, men moved the deacon blowing out the candle , then he hugel ed by the window dejectedly It was a dreamy May night and the an though chilly, was full of the odors of spring, and the mysterious bluospices above were sown thick with stars "Perhaps he knows all up there,' The wild, lifting his eyes reverently, "mi how it went Agin me to give him any pain I wonder how bl other Wendell OCCUR about it Deacon Wendell, fortunately or unfortunately, as the case may be, was of th tougher fabricator which the strong sons of the world so made. He had pea for Died the duty that devolved upon him, as he had performed the implies mt duties, having been shot ill once, and there was nothing to he said He was Sony the parson died just as he did "Looks as though he done it on purpose to spite us," reflected Deacon Wendell Perhaps his chief emotion when he first heard the news was all over River mouth now-was an ill defined feeling of resentment at, miss Pu son VVibird for having cut up rough The effect produced on Mr Dent was more complex Though neither so callous as Deacon Wendell not so soft hearted as Deacon Twombly, he seem ed to some extent the feelings of both He keenly regretted the death of the old poison, and particularly the manner of it. It was an unlucky coincidence, he could not look upon it as anything more than a coincidence, and would give rise to much disagreeable gossip li it had happened a month or two before, or a month or two later, he would have been sorry, as any body is sorry when anybody died , but he would not have been shocked He wished he had not been quite so warm an order citing the desirableness of Mr Dillnighnm If he could have foreseen the present catastrophe he would have thrust his hand into the flames rather than move in the matter But what was done was done, and as he urged the make across the long wooden bridge which ended among the crumbling wharves and shabby vv alehouses of Market street, he trusted something would transpire showing that the parson's cloth was the result of natural causes and in no degree to be attributed to-to what had probably caused it There was on unusual glimmer and moving of lights in the windows of the parsonage, and a my sterious coining and going of shadows on the brown Holland shades, as Mr Dent turned into Horseshoe lane He was within a dozen rods of the cottage, when the gate creaked on its hinges and Dr J Theophilus Tiediek posted out, walking off rapidly in an opposite direction Mr Dent pushed on after the doctor, and overtook him at the doorstep of a neighboring house A moment, doctor," said VIr Dont, leaning over the horses neck. " Has there been an inquest 1 " " Yes , we have just finished the examination " "Well?" " Paralysis " " Attributable to any sudden mental excitement or anything of that nature ? You know he had a conversation on church affairs with the deacons this afternoon ; could that have affected but many vinyl ' Mr. Dent put the query anxiously. "It would be difficult h) sin, replied the doctor "It is open to conjecture of course, but at the worst it could only have hastened what was inevitable I am not prepared to affirm that it hastened it, in fact, I do not think it did " "I do not entirely catch your meaning, doctor," Mr Dent said I mean that I'm son Hawkins had had two of slight stir okes of p n ii j sis pi cv lously , one last winter and the second three weeks ago I was apprehensive that the third would terminate fatally " " I nev 01 heard of that "No one knew of it, I think , not even Acts Under, the housekeeper It was at his own

What could it be She was arranging the house plants in the bay window room, as it was called, when 1 may do lit wed Mr Dent s incBfe ago "He must have missed the train, ' said Pin dence to herself But

almost constantly Until she saw him once more or knew that he was dead, she was not to be relieved of his sense of expectancy It was also associated with any idea of desire that he would claim her

however unwisely or weekly Sale would have waited for him loyally all her life his misfortune would have linked her closer to him but he had not asked her to wait, on to shin of the misfortune , he had given her up, and the obvious thing for Prudence had been to forget him In a circumscribed life like hers, how was it possible for her to forget that she had loved and been loved ? She taught herself to look upon his visit to AA'illowbrook and what had subsequently occurred, as a midsummer s day dream , but beyond that she had not been successful John Dent s name was seldom spoken now by either Prudence or her guardian to all appearance how as obliterated from their memories , but the truth is time was scarcely a month when both Prudence and Air Dent did not wonder what had become of him " I dont believe she ever thinks of him nowadays,' reflected Mr Dent " He has quite forgotten line, ' Prudence would say to herself But Mr Dent never took his letters from the languid clerk at the post office without half expecting to find one from Jack, and Prudence never caught an expression more than usually thoughtful on her guardian's face without fancying he had received news of his nephew.
