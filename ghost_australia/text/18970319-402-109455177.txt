The recent unfavorable seasons throughout the north have had a most depressing effect on sport of every descrip- tion, as was painfully noticeable at the Orroroo races last week—a gathering, indeed, but a ghost of its former self. Not that this is to be wondered at, as with the depressing outlook in every direction it is small matter for surprise that farmers and others have little heart for holiday keeping. However, St Patrick's Day—dear to all Irishmen comes but once a year, and the local Hibernians were determined that despite unpropitious circumstances the anniversary of Ireland's Patron Saint should not be allowed to pass without due celebration. Two years ago a combined programme of sports and horse racing was provided but on this occasion it was decided to confine the fixture to the latter, and in this, no doubt, the committee acted wisely. The attendance on Wednesday, all things considered, was fair, and the weather by no means unfavorable. The programme provided resulted in some good racing, and much interest was mani- fested in the various events, especially in the St Patrick's Day Handicap, which resulted in a real good race and was won by Mr W. Waters' Fan Tan. The District Race also went to Fan Tan. In the Hack Race the stewards held an enquiry into the running of Cyanide, and deceided to suspend Woods, the jockey, for the day, and withheld the second prize ; this decision met the approval of the public as it was very evident that Cyanide could have won if wanted. Mr M. J. McInerney carried out the duties of secretary, and, together with the various officers, worked hard to ensure success. The handicapping for the various events was done by Messrs G. Randle and J. K. Casey. The financial proceeds of the day's meeting cannot exactly be stated as yet but we are pleased to be informed that the result will be a financial success, and that the com- mittee have decided to make St Patrick's Day race meeting an annual fixture. The following are the results of the racing :— MAIDENS.— 2 sovs. For horses that had never won public money. 7 furlongs. Weight for age. Mr D. Easton's Actor, 8st 10lb. (owner) ... ... ... 1 Mr W.

IN THE EVENING a select social was held in the Town Hall. In response to invitations sent out about fifty couples were present, and the affair proved one of the most successful yet held in the town. Mr J. J. Casey acted as M.C., the music was supplied by Messrs Potter (piano) and McInerney (violin), whilst the catering was carried out by Mr F.O. Sonne- mann.
