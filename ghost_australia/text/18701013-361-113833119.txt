CASTELAR ON THEI (ECIUMIENICAL COUNCIL. (From Ith 'Speial C?orrespondent of thue Sltano. dard.) - MARnID, M?ay 6. THE proceedings of the (Eoumeniocl Council naturailly attract much attention hIerc. The ,following article on them is published in the Madrid Discusion, from the eloquent pen of Senor Castclar: "TilE (EOUMENICAL COUNCIL. "Popular assemblies streggle; Govero meats resist; political parties vteoiferato; nationalities afftirm or. deny;: Germany has entered on a critical period, likely to engender a war. England- the staid 'and prudent England--has effected no. thling less than a social revolution by tile' passage of in agrarian law.. In this state of things one capitol point raises its head above all others, as if to s?oit lihow ld premely humanity values..its moral interests. That point is the religious point-the (E.oicumonical COuuncil.' At first it would appoar imposiibld to 'have attracted publio intorestto .it,coansideritig' the many plans the Roman Pontificate has adoptdd to divert it.' While our ago admits through every pore tile air aind light of liberty, espccially in' :matters whose conception is thoughlt, and whoe organ is speech, the Council 'at Rome enshrines itself in tlhe' regionof mystery,' and imposes an absolitoe. silencedd.

In Augsburg, that very Augsburg whlere Luther edited tlio symbol of the ncw Christianity, they publishl all the Con. ciliarean as which tie Pope wishes to be kopt:in m stet and the world not to know' until be'are declared and nd. mitted as di teoof the voice of the Holy Ghostl "Tliis publioit has'two great inconve. nionoes for ~lhe Ho?

Only a fdw:days'ngo,' the faithful who were painssing through the spacious extent of St. Peter's heard a horrible tumult in the hapel.b of the Council, though no one could explain the cause. One might hare supposed tlhey weore sct ting fire to th'eo sanctuary of thei Holy Ghost. That cry was a cry of fanaticism and intolerance. The old flames were roevivifying, the ancient turns of the tor ment. mere being ,resercwed, the old embers of the Inquisition were being rekindled. When th Obhuroh had coni pletoly desolated entire peoples by consigning them to heresy, one bisliop - Strossmayer, - celebrated for his opposition, to P'apal infnllibility, deolored that Protestantism ought not to be confoundo with inaterialism, pantho isIs, or with atheistm. In corroboration of this theory, he invoked those great Protestant t:hinkors who have defended the spirituality and immortality of the soul, the being of a God, and:Hi- incomr :municalilo Providecee.' When hieeited :Lioebdit~, tliord 'were slighi murmure from the eosnecript fatlhers of thb'spirit. .But when hie cited Guizot, there arose Ia tumult of protests like a oombat. The Spanish fatlmers especially direoted them selves to the tribune in hostile attitude, as if they,would oblige hium to descend by foco. Strobssmayr, sad imid siorroaw ful, has appoaled tol his Government to preserve his indepenldence of judgtmenr, and in hiis porplexiiy is asked' hiis friends if religious souls must seok a refuge in Protestin?tistli from thie blindnress of lnomain:prida ?.
