POETICAX. CRUMBS. TrVjiT take such.urnbrage at our crumbs ! Would they some pepper'd crust tryP A crust might scarify their gums, ? Should we prepare the pastry. Their prayers, we trust, have all been heard, And genuine their repentance, But doubt not, in a certain word, Some met an old acquaintance. Should Grindhard's ghost e'er have the luck, To meet with Doctor Johnson's ; The two may have ' a crow-to pluck,' Old Sam's will ' stand no nonsense.' 'What ! interdict one single word Of our all conquering language .' ! Let no man boast a Brjton's beard, Who'd thus his mother tongue gauge ! We'll have no words hand-cuflf'd, enchain'd, And flogg'd for being mention'd . Men are, we know, like wood, cross-grain'd, But words are well intention'd. Words wander on from shore to shore, And spread such facts before us, As cause an atolantic roar, And south pacific chorus. He's well equipp'd who's got a fund, Of dry sarcastic humour, And can afford, if fear'd, or shunn'd, To spare some ticklish tumour. Our would-bo literary Lash May quit, unwhipt, the world, Poor iceberg of the sea of trash, And greenswamp of the Herald. LET US SOW THE SEED OF FREEDOM ! What though the rains may pelt and pour, And the cold winds bite and blow ; Shall we for that our work give o'er ? No ! let us plough and sow j Then let us plough and sow my men, Then let us plough and sow ; We'll reap in joy in those bright days, When the fields 'all yellow show ! Old Sony. Let us sow the seed of freedom, As we wander o'er the land : And pray may heaven speed him j Who hath such a work in hand J What the heart may strongly feel, Let the tongue as boldly tell ; Nor one single thought conceal, That might tend to work us well. There arc despots over all , And tyrants, small and great. Whose will and power to gall, Bode but evil to a State. He who watches well the game, Which some play beyond the waves, May well at times exclaim, What a pack of worse than knavos ! ? ^^ ?
