? WINTER BUTTER MAKING ? {By :Senry- Stiuaut{,' tntlluml'fflew Worker Ir the first rfquisite for good bntter ie the cow, the stcond is the dairy room>6r ^houss, for. if, 18 useless to procure good milk, if it ii spoiled m tbe beepinp.

A sink and drain mby also he carried-from the milk room.- The tank will be hfgh enough to supply the house and the barn with .water through pipeB. ^ The cost of - the ' whole -I estimate to be afiout fiOOdol. for a dairy ol 50 oows, »nd no one can doubt that it will be'« profitable investment for the maker of extra butter. • :—"-. 1 •'•• '" ','...,';' TH» CJTOEXING. :;",' , .

" ,„' -.'.-.: „ .. To particularise, Jet me recall the churn ing.ot the7th of Jannaiy, 1880, because this was an eventful one, r,ii.t r-^.itiea in my mind some questions which were previously doubi. fui to me. My cirosFbred three-year-old • Jersey and Ayrshire .cow, Maids, had been fresh two weeks, and- this was tbe first churning of six days 1 milk.- -Tue cream—12 -guar! s exactly—was turned into the reoiangulaf churn aforesaid,'and^the jehurn: nnd-cream were both at a temperature of ,65 degrees, After churning for eight minutes precisely:, making i70 iievolnlioris :.of r the;.ahum; per minutei I was surprised to hear the" <iash":of ..the bnttermiik,'^and^was more than' surprised on opening the churn to see so magnificent a sample of butter. -Tbe mass of polden butter was in small grains from the size of sago grains up to that oi buckof, lying in an irregular mass , piled up. in the churn, with a small quantity of butter tu'lk at,'.thei.-'bottom. ; The: butter weighed 10J ponnds. .The result, -lOi ponnaB ,?nf butter-from 12 quarts of thick cream, chumed m eight, jsiouies,. at a temperature of .65 degrees, aettled some pointy, about which questions are -frequently, asked.'. " , •: • .' This -churning out o[ ihe -way the cream of two Ayr-hire cows three-year-old^. that have been milking ,10 months and -are llirfia in CtIf—14.quarts in: all—was pot.in.the churn at a temperature: of 60 degrees. This churned three hours patiently withopt breaking the cream, and was aovised to throw the cream .out aB it was.one of those messes -which' wonld never -cburn.. i,ei us try some warm water.., A qnart of hot water from the iiettje was ihrown in, the ohurn rotated, and in one minute the butfer came; tbe temperature in the churn tlien was C4 degreeB, This also goes tome way to settle anolher (iiffiaulty in winter dairying, which causes a great deal of .trouble. '" . If butter comes at 64 or 65 degrees in a short time, and fsils lo come at' all at 60 oesreee, ibis is a valuable fact to koow Another churning, of Matda'a cream of 16 quaris, from seven days' milk, produces' 14 pounds of butter in 12 minutes at a temperalure of .65 degrees, with several stoppages to g *aich the progress, so tnat.eight quartp o V""* creaai wll! w ake ' s 6vei3^^pounds of irW"?^ ,... , „,..: . . , / : , . . -,., churns \- The Tartars are, said to do-theirohurriing; l -foJ. putting;the.,milli: in. & sheep -skiiibottle, which they-fie to the trundle andtakeabrisk gallpp-for an'hour or two; yon returbing the flitter is. made:: .'
