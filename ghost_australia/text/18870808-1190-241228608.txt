NOTES AND COMMENTS. No Qhosta Evoa In America. Under this head tho Pa/f Mall GazeUc writes:â€” Tho Commission appointed by tho University of Penn-dyvnnin under tlio will of tho late llcnry Soybert to invostigato the fo- called phcuomoiia of modern spirituuism liavo coino to tho conclusion that there is nothing extraordinary in any of these manifestations that is nttributablo to anything more mysterious than legerdemain. Tho full leporfc of tho Commission, Which will shortly bo . issued by tho Lippincott, is likely to attract a good deal of attention. They report that the demonstration of tho trickery of slate-writing is conclusive, ns is that of the purely physio, logical origin of tho rnppings. It was the common experience of tho Scybert Com mission that "as soon ns nn investigation worthy of tho natno, begins all manifestations of spiritual powercease," Thoy wcro told of marvellous tilings that the spirits did, but when it was sought to havo these miracles re >cated in their presence the " conditions" were " inharmonious" and nothing took place. Tho Commission say in concluding their report: " We regret that thus far wo havo not been cheered in our investigations by the discovery of a single novel fact ; but, undeterred by this discouragement, wo trust, with your permis sion, to continue them with what thoroughness our futuro opjiortunities may allow and with minds as sincerely and honestly open as here tofore to conviction."
