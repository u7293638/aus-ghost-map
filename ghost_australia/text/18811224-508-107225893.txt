TO THE EDITOE OP 'THE DAILT TELEGBAPH.' Sir, — 'Seeing is believing.'' I am a High lander, therefore, you may Bay, imbued with the superstition of my race, when I say I believe in ghosts, supernatural warnings, dreams and second sight, and, being a woman, possibly may be con sidered not strong minded. I te 1 my story from my own experience. It'is at long intervals during my life — I am now advancing in years — that events have happened in my own family circle of which I have been forwarned by dreams. But my sjhost story is this. I had gone to bed, slept well all through the night, having given orders to be called earlier than usual, as my mother was to Bet- out, after break fast, by train, on ihe Highland railway, to the far Jfoith. I woke suddenly, remembering it might be time to rise, when I distinctly saw a figure standing in a corner of the bedroom. It was clad from head to foot in armour, the visor down. I felt my heart beat fast with fear, still I payed, and could take in the proportions of the figure, and recognised it as the eldest brother of a very intimate giri friend of mine, but no relation. 1 closed my eyes', unable to overcome the awfnlly mysterious impression the apparition imparted to me. T7hen I looked again it had vanished. I got up, dressed, and on going downstairs found my mother prepared for her journey. An indefinable dread prevented me disclosing: to her what I had seen that morning. I accompanied her to the railway station, impressing on 'her to telegraph on her arrival at Inverness. That evening her telegram reached me— the words to this effect : ' Arrived all jSaf e and well ; ' Young Munro * died thic morning-.' And so it was ; but why this appiri tion visited me I know not. The deathjas sudden and unexpected at his Highland resmence. His family relations were at the lime in the southland he died before any of them even heard of any illness to cause uneasiness. — Yours truly, A. Boss. With respect to stories of this kind, a modern writer (vide ' Austra'ian Penny Magazine,' No. 4) observes : — The records of ghost lore contain an immense mass of facts mingled with a large amount of folly and superstition. The latter are often sufficiently dense to blunt the edge of the keenest and most eager criticism. Science recoils from the investigation of a subject which appears to be so interwoven with self-illusion, mental weakness, and imposture. Indeed to such an extent does this feeling prevail that many men styling themselves philosophers refuse to investigate any Alleged supernatural occurrence, for fear that by investigating it they should damage their great reputation. Poor fools! How the world will either laugh at or .pity tfiem a hundred years 'hence. Large- wigged science raises its hat and bows deferentially to a rare frog or a new beetie, but refuses to examine any facts which might possibly lead to the recog nition of the supernatural, or throw light on the mystery of human destiny. Oi all the various species of folly we behold in the -world, this one is the most pitiable and contemptible. The man who is not capable of braving the sneers and ridicule of unreasoning ignorance in. his pursuit of truth is unworthy of being called a philos ophers. This eontemptfpr alleged supernatural appear ances and events is productive of much evil, because it leaves the examination of all such ato pearances -and vents- in the hands of men- who are in many, instances incapable of examining them sufficiently. Hence, we have such a moltL tude of inconsequential and badly authenticated ghost , stories current, in onr literature, The perusal of these tend to producer false impression on the reader's mind with re Bpect to the nature »nd yftlne of all Buoil&r; stories. r^The narrator often omits, mentioning some material -arcumflt*nc«, which, if known, would atter the ' entire complexion of the narra tive. Bod,- J3ometimes,Jie_4w£liB::oB the minor details of rthe case «o as to exaggerate them ont of laii^lue proportion to their merits. The general result is that many .ghost afcoriesdoiioi; furnish 'a proper basis 'for intlrictiT© reateonine.' siid heobe arises one of the many difficulties we n&veto; con-j teiid against whenever we attempt to investigate' this 'very enrious and interesting eubject. .
