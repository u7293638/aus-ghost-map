A SET OF CHESSMEN. j I 'Bat, Monsieur) perceive how magnificent they axe! There ib not in Finistere, there is not in Brittany, nav, it is certain there is not in France so superb a set of chessmen. And ivory ! And the earring — observe, for example, the variety of detail. They certainly were a curious set of chessmen, magnificent in a way, but curious first of all. As JL Bobineau remarked, holding & rook in one and a knight in the other, the core paid to details by the carver really was surprising. Bat two hundred and fifty francs ! For a set of chessmen! ' So, so, my friend. I am willing to admit that the work is good — in a kind of a way. But two hundred and fifty francs ) If it were fifty, now?' ^Fifty!' ITpwent^M. Bobineau^g shOJcJ£CT6, Fmn.ir But when one has only five thousand francs a year for everything, two hundred and fifty being taken away — ana for a set of chess men-j-does leave & vacancy behind* I asked Bobineau where he got them. Busi ness was slack that sunny afternoon — it seemed to me that X was the only customer he ever had, but that must have been a delusion on my part. Bepfrtsaid he was a warm man, one of Mormix's warmest men, and his queer oldjjn^fMM queer old Grande Bue — Grande name for an alley ! — contained 'which were valuable as well there at least was no o&ercDstoin;^H^Hfl then* so Bobineau told me all tbe ^^H jHH Xt seemed there had been a — I Auguste Funichon — no, not ai Parisian, a true Parisian, who sailed down in the commfi^Ho^^Ki^^E^I erampL, a^tittle — weU,^aJttue^^Ri^^E^| alted, let us say. It is true that^^^^HKifl people said lie was stark mad, bu^(MPfeau* for his part, said no, no, no ! It is not neces sary because one is eccentric that one is mad. Here Bobineau looked at me out of the comer of his eye. Are not the fingfiRh, of all people, the Sort eccentric, and yet is it not known to all the world that they are not, necessarily, stark mad r This M. Funichon was not rich, quite the contrary. It was a little pi ace he lived in — the merest cottage, in fad. And in it he lived it to yourself ! To do nothing— nothing ! — but play chess! .They say' — ST. bobineau looked round him with an air of mystery — ' they say he starred MmgMf to death. He was so besotted by Hb miserable chess that he forgot — abso- lutely forgot, this imbecile— to eat.' Thatwas what 1L Bobineau said they said. It required a vigorous effort of the imagination iojyute take it in. Towhat a state of forget fulness must a man arrive before he forgets to eat? But whether 31. Funichon forgot to eat, or whether he didn't, at least he died, and being dead they sold his goods — why they sold them vae not quite glance of mystery around, 'that they found him dead, seated at the table, the chessmen on the board, his hand on the white rook, which was giving mate to the adversary's king.' Either what a vivid ixnaginationhad Bobineau. or what odd things the people said ! One pictures the old man, seated all alone, with his last breath fininhing ftingnrap, Well, I bought tKe set of ivory chessmen.

Half unconsciously I watched decided on I would try a little experiment/* an^put out my hand, not with the lightest conception of any particular move in my head; but simply to see what happened. Instantly a gram fastened on my wrist ; my hand was guided to— king's knight's pawn a angle square. This was getting, from every point of view, to be distinctly interesting.
