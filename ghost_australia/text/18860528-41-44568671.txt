SO CHS KDITOB. Sirâ€” The Rev. Acbdeacon Dove is reported to have recently said that he 'would rather die than see a minister of any of the Protestant sects Trre&Rhincr; in Ansllcan ChurcheB or in their Cathedral.' Well, the cause cf Protestantism would not materially suffer from the reverend gentleman's death, bnt I really do think that the spread of Roman Catholic tenets would be retarded greatly by such a calamity. I was glad to find that none of his brother clergymen present at the Church : of England Synod would prefer 'Riving up the ghost' than allow a 'sectarian' minister to preach in their pulpits.' I would like to ask the rev. gentleman if he ' would rather die' than allow a priest of tho Roman Catholic faith to preach in Walker ville Church ; and also if he ' would rather die' than preach in a Roman Catholic place of worship. It would be more consistent, holding the tenets he does, if the Archdeacon threw off the cloak of Protestantism and avowed himself a Roman Catholic'; but this ? is not the policy of the Bchool to which he belongs, as more injury results to ProteBtant- . Ism and Roman Catholicism derives greater benefit from euph ' priests' insidiously in doctrinating their congregation!) in all that is ? subversive of Protestantism, whilst they still remain (nominally) ' prieBts' of the ' Angli- . can' persuasion, and this they know full , well, , ??; ? t I am, Sir, &c;, J.
