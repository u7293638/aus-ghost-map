THE "GHOST." The senseless individual who for weeks past has been acting "the ghost" in and around the city has not yet been captured, notwithstanding the vigi lance of the authorities. The "ghost" is described as a man of tall appear ance, dressed in a long dark overcoat, under which is a white shroud, and across the chest, lit up with phosphor us, is a skull and cross-bones, with the words "Prepare to meet your doom" em blazoned thereon. The "ghost" has been seen by dozens of people, principally females, who in some cases have been so terror-stricken that medical aid has had to be sought for them. It is most frequently in dark streets and lanes that the "ghost" appears. The Government are consider ing the advisableness of offering a re ward for his capture.
