THE KINGDOM WITHIN. The kingdom of God ia within you, saith ? the Lord. Turn yourself with all your heart to the Lord, and unfix your affections from this sinful world, and you shall find rest for your soul. Learn to think little of external things, and to give your thoughts to things ? internal, aad you will find that the kingdom \- of God will enter into you. For the kingdom ? of God is righteousness, peaco, and joy in tho Holy Ghost, and this is not given to tho ?unholy. Christ will come to you, giving you His own consolation, if you prepare Him a ?worthy mansion within. All His glory and i honor are from within, and there it .pleaseth t Him to dwoll. He who frequently entertains -Christ will have sweet discourse with Him, ? comfort and consolation, much peace, a friend .ship too wonderful for the heart of man to have conceived. â€” Thomas a Kempis.
