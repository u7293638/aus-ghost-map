SUNDAY DISTURBANCES. To the Editor of the Examiner. SIR,—Allow me through the medium of your paper to call the attention of the Christian public to little scenes enacted in York-street in an open square, noises and sounds there to be heard, outrivalling any heathen ones. While- some benevolent and zealous man (whose zeal seems mistaken), tries in vain to sow the good seed of eternal life. We talk of foreign missions. There are many needed in our own streets, if our friends of truth would walk our streets on Sunday afternoons. But a word to the wise is sufficient. We are tempted to ask where are our constables, for not a " ghost of one" overshadows the Sunday promenades. Trusting you will favor myself and those concerned, by giving this publicity.— I am, yours obliged, Launceston, July 1872. HUMANITY.
