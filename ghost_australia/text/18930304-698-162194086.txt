Horticultural Society's Flower Show. It is usual for the Horticultural Society to hold a summer fruit and flower show in February, but the council of the society decided not to have one this year. Instead, they resolved to extend the usual ni nthly meeting to an exhibition of plants, flowers, and fruits, with the result that, last week, a show of the kind was held in the lecture-hall of the School of Arts, Pitt- street. The show was opened at 2 o'clock, by which time the judge, Mr. G. Harwood, of the Botanic Gardens, had completed his work. Some of the most attrac tive exhibits were to be found in the noncompeti tive section. Mrs. C. Bennett, of The Strand, showed four ladies' breast sprays and four coat buttonhole bouquets, mounted on easels. They were in Mrs. Bennett's best style, and afforded an admirable object lesson to - lady amateurs at this work. The sprays and button-hole bouquets contributed by lady amateurs were also very pretty, the most successfully treated being Mrs. P. C. Trebeck's, Miss Emily Johnson's, Miss Buby Johnson's, and Mrs. T. W. W. Garde's. The same ladies contributed a number of pretty posies for -the coat and some beautiful breast sprays, as also did Miss Buby Johnson and Miss Edith John son. Mr. J. - H. Horton, gardener to Mrs. James White, made a fine non-competitive display of bouvardias (48 trusses), as well as '24 dahlias, mis cellaneous cut flowers, and two handsome orchids — Odontoglossum and Peristeria elata (the Holy Ghost orchid).
