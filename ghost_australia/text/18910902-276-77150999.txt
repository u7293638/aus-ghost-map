STRAY NOTES. (BY JAMES GiuasiE.) THE NEW DOCTRINE, The geological record shows plainly that some of the latest animals-those here now came into existence before the last of the extinct ones had left, for remains of the badger, deer, and aurooh have been found intermingled with those of the last class of extinot ones, and Professor Tyndal wonders that the same fate-the Bame exterminating influence-did not overtake them all 5 but the same influence la still aotive and as mysterious now as it was then-taking one olaaa and leaving the others unmolested, It carried off all the Tuaoarora- Indiana of Amerioa, all the aboriginies of Tasmania and New Holland and left the last coraars as it had left the badger and aurooh, It assailed the kangaroo in Australia and dismissed them while the last comers-the rabbits- increased in millions, It is much more perplexing to consider where the badger otmie from or how ic got here, for its first parents were aa completely developed as it is now, and it bears no affinity in pny one point to the animals that went before it. It seems to have sprung into existence preoiaely as it !b now, and in bo far aa it is ooncerned, the record tends to a special creation ; but if it was specially created what about the extinct animaiB, a long procession of which had in various classes and at various periods held dominion over the earth for countless ages ? The auroch was a bovine animal, and all its posterity in herited ita colour (cream colour), and it is therefore possible that it may have been the early progenitor of the ox of the present period, but there is no affinity, no resemblance and no habit to link the deer and badger with ceratures that went before them. Some learned doctors are of opinion that the anoient Egyptian tablets are oonaiderably older than either the Chinese or Hebrew records, and no indication of a knowledge of the extinot animals is shown in auy of them but a pieoe of sculpture found amongst the ruins of a Hindoo temple Bhows a tortoiBe and full grown elephant of equal size standing together, and as the glyptodon, an extinot tortoise, was computed to be aa large as an elephant, an opinion prevails that the Indian 8oulptor knew that the present animals were not the first; and on the other side of the ques tion it muBt be admitted that a mammoth found embedded in ice on the banks of the Russian White Sea some years ago-not like a thin ghost or disembodied, creature, but with all ita flesh and bones and limbs and features bled freely when thawed, and wolves ate ita fleah greedily.. It ib supposed by tnauy that that animal, in place of being many thousands, is not many hundreds of years old, and that therefore the extinot animals may have lived up to a comparatively recent period ; but Hutton a assertion must be borne in mina, namely, that " an animal in a state of torpidity, or fiah ova, frozen up would retain vitality throughout all eternity, and if that be but half true, the flesh of the White Sea_ mammoth may have beeu preserved for millions of years, and then bled freely. But be that as it may, the antiquity of the extinot animals cannot be doubted, for many of them are older than the hills beneathwhicn they lie and some Are older than the sea itself5 and their remains were not first discovered by a learned dootor or savan, but by an illiterate servant girl, the house* maid at a wayside tavern near which there was a oreek that had out ita way perpendicularly for thirty feet below the first level. She noticed bones atioking out from the bank very unlike the bonea of modem animate, and although laughed at for a time and called u cranky Susan," her opinion was at length verified, The general opinion among learned folk whoever they are-now ia that the plRneta are slowly but aurely nearing the aun, Into which they will ultimately fall, and that when the first reptilians appeared the earth was a hun dred millions of miles further from the solar orb than it ia now, and that at each million of miles stage a new and superior class of animals will appear on its aurface, and, consequently, having ninety stages to get over still and ninety millions of years to float as it floats now, it follows-if the deductions are sound that ninety alasses of being, eaoh superior to man have still to appear on ita surface-eaoh admirably adapted to the new condi tions, for life can be adapted to any conditions, la one part of Afrioa the natives are not discommoded by a solar heat that very nearly approaches the boiling point, and at Disco Bay near Greenland they live in some degree of comfort in a climate where the mercury in a thermometer falls forty degrees below tbe freezing point and there becomes as malleable as lead, and these natives are not specially constructed to reBist intense heat or bitter cold, and it Beams to us a singular oversight in the economy of nature that where fuel and water are most needed they are scarcest. There is no fuel at Disco Bay-at any rate none available to the Esquimaux who inhabit there-and in t many parts of sun. scorched Africa water is equally soaice, But creatures can be adapted, and some can adapt themselves to live without warmth, water, or eveu air, Mr. Comoriu used to sit ia a baker's oven until bread was baked, and a-Hindoo lived for years without water, THE 0NIVHR8H. It ia certain that Bpaco which we call the heavens is ondlesa and illimitable. That ia if one could fly away from the earth in any direction and continue flying for ever he would never come to an end, and it is equally or nearly as certain that it ia not a region of darkness or vacuity, for telescopes, which have now enormoaa magnifying power, resolve stArs of the first magnitude, and some of a magnitude immeasureably greater than that of our sun wherever they penetrate, and the probability, if not the certainty, ia that apace although endleaa is occupied by conatellationa and galaxies of stars, each of tranacendant glory. One of the beat modern telescopes was constructed in Ger many the other year, and it not only reveals the remote planets very clearly but it also resolves their satellites or moons, and although one of these is only eighty miles in diameter the teles cope magnifies it into the size of our moon, and a singular circumstance connected with that satellite is that it revolves twice round its planet in every twenty-four hours, It is three hundred thousand milea distant from its planet, consequently the diameter of its orbit ia six hundred thousand miles, and as it runs round that circle twice in twenty-four hours, ita speed must be like the speed of thought. The rate of the swiftest locomotive would be lesa thau the speed of a snail compared to its velocity, and depend upon it that it fulfils a furpose in going twice round its planet daily, f any person entertains a doubt that apnea ia endless let him suggest what its boundary is, and what lies beyond the boundary, for if the boundary is not itself endleaa space muat be resumed beyond it. Let him look: through the German telescope and in the remote nebula; he will see fixed stars of far greater magnitude than our sun, although the distance to those atnra ia almost beyond human comprehension, If the Mount Gambier railway extended to tho neareat of the nebular stars and ita locomotive was to run continuously it would require ten thousand yeara.to accomplish the journey, and depend upon it also that when a telescope is made to surpass the German one galaxies will be resolved as far from the nebula as it is from ua, but aa it ia impossible for mortal man to construct a telescope able to penetrate a epace that has neither beginning nor end we muat reaort to deduction and conclude that space, although endless, is altogether occupied. And the structure of these vast worlds and the un erring regularity of their periods and move ments shows clearly enough that they are con trolled by a living influence. If the" earth's "orbit round the aun waa a circle, and no more, one Bide of the earth would be frozen in darkness, while the other side enjoyed intense light and heat, and the solu tion of an exquisite geometrical problem would bo necessary to.discover what amount of crook in the orbit would be necessary to give uniformity to both. That problem was solved before the earth waa placed in its position, and is now knows as the obliquity of the eollptio, Is it reasonable to suppose that ohanoo dis covered that that obliquity was necessary to enable lUIng creatures to inhabit the earth, or that Its' geometry was the result of accident ? Any rational person who com pares the magnitude of the universe aa yevealed by the telescope with that revealed by theology Would be very apt to conclude that tne most expansive of the creeds is far too contracted for the occasion, If the ancieut Hebrews had known that in place of the earth being the only habitable world in the universe, it is a mere atom thoret they would doubtleaa have expanded their theology, and the Buddista who are still mora ancient would hot have fallen into the error of restricting the abode of Buddha to a locality. The anoient Egyptians had in all probability a more expansive know* ledge of the universe, for wo tintf their towera and temples vieing with each other in magni* tude, and at nnyrate one of thoir table.ta^tneir only reoordB^fudicftteo ft surrounding spaqe without a limit. Hero, therefore, let us hold, for that there ia a power above us all nature oriea aloud through all het works. Voltaire did not.know bo tnuah about the magnitude and wondet'a of creation as a peasant does to-day, and the peasant's opinion on the subject ought, therefore, to be more reliable than his I and even Hume and Tyndale, after expressing their unbelief ad« mitted that the future and .the past are shrouded in a mystery that they cannot pene» trate J and BO ends my eoalogue, SVI8DOM.
