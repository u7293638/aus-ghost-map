Confident in his own ability to discover the So lomon Islands, Santa Cruz, and th'e continent, Quires obtained command of two ships from the Government of Feru, and sailed out west from Caliac towards the end of 1605. He made many interesting little discoveries among the islands, including that of Tahiti: and on reachine one called Taumaco, belonging to the Duff Group, he met with an intelligent chief, who supplied him with a good deal oÂ£ information about neighboring countries. Becoming quite excited at the pros pent of seeing the continent, he lost sight of Santa Cruz and the Solomons, and sailed to, the south west. On' the way he touched at Tucopia, and sailing into a bay in the New Hebrides, pro claimed the discovery of a new world, which he dignified with the title of the 'Australia of the Hoiy Ghost' Unfortunately, his crew did not sympathise with his projects of discovery in the least; and getting afraid of the scurvy, they weighed anchor in the night, and carried hfrn off to Mexico. .
