superfluous lags the " veteran on to state " the author of the line is a contradiction to the averment in his own person, for it was in his old age that Dr. JOHNSON attained the reverence, honour, and dignity which were denied to anywhere, a younger man, he penned the oft quoted phrase in the hands of Roman Wishes The old judge, the old politician, the old general, and the old sovereign, are the men of weight and power What society has rather to complain of is the increasing disposition on the part of middle aged men, who have once departed this life to return to it again Whether li NNVSOV, by virtue of a popular poem, is open sible for the practice, of whether the tale of the Tichborne claimant is the cause, may be uncertain, but it looks as if a new offence would have to be created, or a statute of limitation brought in Men have mysteriously disappeared in all ages, but it is only nowadays that a being who has absented himself for years, and has been duly mourned for, ventures to saunter back to his village, and to place every body at a serious disadvantage by m sisting that cer indicates must be annulled, family arrangements disturbed, and tombstones pulled down What promises to be a leading case has just occurred in England, and the social significance of the event has led to suggestive particulars being given in the Australian press One JUDKINS to adopt that cognomen-left his home one time clay, and failed to learn He it was a gicatJoeal sensation, the columns of the local press being filled clad) with particulars and speculations of what was called the " Indians Mystery ' As the missing citizen was not in financial difficulties, the idea of self destruction was abandoned The temperament of the easy going penny a liner who wrote about the suicide, " the " sum of eighteenpence was found in his " pocket, so that no motive can be after " buted for the rash act, ' so far prevailed as to insure the rejection of the theory that a sane man would kill himself when he had a substantial credit at the bank And as it was not an edible that the virtuous matron his partner in life, had put her spouse away, the popular theory was that JUDKINS had inn oil with some other man's wife But speculation was terminated by the fishing up of a body from the adjacent met The corpse was somewhat mutilated, but after being sat upon by twelve neighbours, it was unanimously pronounced to be that of JUDKINS, of whom it was duly is decided that he had been accidentally drowned It is to be gathered from the narrative that JUDKINS had been regarded with a certain coldness, and perhaps suspicion, during his lifetime, as an untrustworthy character leading of his moral attributes which after events far too sadly confirm But naturally with JUDKINS death all these fancies would vanish CARLYLE pushed everything to extremes, but his experience with his wife was by no means an uncommon one During her life he was sadly indifferent to her virtues , after her death he could see no faults, but in sisted with the full sweep of his declamation that he had entertained an angel unawares, and had not treated that angel properly Iho f nonda of Tunis repented them of their coldness, and though they could not manage so slow ing an epitaph as that worn by the Seer of Chelsea, yet they did the whole burial business as handsomely as they could 'The tombstone was a specimen of flood monumental alt 'The inscription declared that the deceased had all the virtues that became a man, and intimated in quite elegant language that what sustained the Boirow mg community was the sure and certain hope of meeting JUDUINS again With a certain sense of satisfaction that they had made the amends honorable the mourners returned to their avocations, little dreaming that their wishes were to be literally fulfilled The estate was divided, the family dispersed, the widow accepted delicate attentions from a citizen whose admiration was prompted by the decontrospect shown by the relict for the departed, and the date for the manageress fixed At this moment JUDKINS himself are appears, ensconced himself in his house, carts the tombstone into his back j aid, and keeps it as though it were a presentation address to a popular major, and gives out boldly that he expects to be treated on the basis of the remarks those set forth He gives some excuse for his absence, but that is immaterial The village had idealised its JTJDKINS He became a myth The legend was put into black and white, and now people have the grumpy and crafty old JUDKINS back again, with the advantage of a character graven on stone It is no wonder to hear of an indignation meeting to complain of a tuck The resolutions that are to be proposed are to pledge the insulted community not to recognise JUDKINS, to require him to leave place, and in particular to restore the tomb stone As JuimiNib did not pay for the mausoleum, he can have no light, it is urged, to rob the cemetery of one of its triumphs of at If he will not come to the grave, the proposal is to send him strictly to Coventry Turning, to avert future unpleasantnesses, it is sug- gested that tombstones should contain only the name and the age of the deceased until the expiry of a period of at least 10 years from the death, thereby, it is urged, scouring not only that the reputed deceased is assuredly no more, but enabling more just appreciation to be made of his intellect and moral worth These are wholesome reforms If they should be earned list at the town meeting, and then into practice, there would be no reason to regret the indiscreet return of JUDIVINTS, who might be left to the reproaches of his conscience and the taunts of the injured woman who has been widely deplored by his abrupt no appearance of a handsome and well to do second hus- band If a commencement were made, we should be in hopes of seeing the rule with regard to epitaphs spread, and nothing would do more to abate the current reproach that if the dead lie in the cemetery, so do the living 'The other resolution to punish these offenders is an instinct in the human bi east There may be no more returning to live in our colonial society Rather, it is to be presumed, we obtain the beings who mysteriously disappear from England, but we can judge by the analogy of politics how necessary it is to cut the unwelcome ghost In public

the BOY or depression in the frozen meat trade re ported by our London correspondent in a letter of August 29, we showed that this condition of affairs had been brought about by reasons of a special character, of , an unusually warm summer in England and an unprecedentedly huge supply of home most, and we ventured to express the opinion that as those ison advanced putea would recover 'The production has been fulfilled Our correspondent, writing only a fortnight later than the 20th August, was able to notice signs of returning animation, while cable message recently published an nounce that New Zealand mutton has been sold at high prices (the retail butchers, it is said, are actually paying morn for New Zealand than for English meat), and that the prospects of the " frozen meat trade is good for all shipments arriving before Christ " nias " The quotations for Vie terms mutton are not given, but a Lyttelton shipment is selling at from 6d to d , which is an advance of 2s per lb upon the August rates When New Zealand meat has made such a jump as this, it is not possible that the Victorian article his stood still Pel Imps the most satisfactory part of the in telligence is that which speaks of the good prospect which the market presents for the winter lins proves that the low prices realised in the summer and autumn were caused, as we pointed out, by special influences, and not by a decline in the popularity of Australian frozen meat The information is all the more encouraging from the fact that the arrivals, especially from New Zealand, have continued to be very heavy It is obvious that the home supply has fallen off, and that a keen demand for imported meat asserting abolish position which the New Ze ii mil meat has taken from the inst in the London mullet shows that it has hit the English taste a fact which, of course, will not be lost upon exporters here New Zealand has certain advantages of climate which Victoria does not possess, but by careful selection we ought to be able to sol d home ship mounts which will compete very closely with those from the island colony Every thing shows how important it is that the kind of mutton calculi in d to

A collision occurred in Hobson's It is near the entrance to the Yarra, on Saturday afternoon, between the steamer Alert and the ballast lighter Governor Blackall, owned by Mr. Williams, of Williamstown.

Foord, the gas examiner, whose opinion was sought as to the possibility of entirely separating naph- the line from the gas supplied to the city, with a view of preventing the naphthalene accumulating; in the supply pipes Mr. Board stated that naphthalene could be entirely separated from the gas, but only at the cost of a reduction of the lighting power by upwards of 50 per cent. The gas supplied by the Metropolitan Gas Company at the present time was fully up to the illuminating quality required by the act, and the pressure was more than required, and the causes of the complaints frequently made were either had sittings or the supply pipes becoming choked A somewhat lengthy discussion ensued, during which the opinion was expressed that it had not been shown that the Gas Company UBid the best means of producing gas of the full illuminating power required It was recognised by some members that the fittings in many cases caused the dissatisfaction that was ex pressed by gas consumers, but in some of the suburban districts the pressure was insufficient. In cases where the fittings were not faulty, and the pressure was good, the supply might be interfered with by them cumulation of the naphthalene in the service pipe between the mines and the meters It was decided to further consider the reports the next meeting of the conference.

The number of permanent directors is to be eight, of whom two shall be appointed by the Governor in Council and Bix shall be elected by the shareholders of -accompany In the event of the company being wound up, it is provided inter alia that no shareholder is to be liable for more than the amount unpaid on his shares The head office of the company is to be in New Zealand, at such place as the directors may from time to time determine " Respecting the suit of Men II V the Queen, our London correspondent writes on September 12 " The new commission was received by last mail, but considerable disappointment was felt by the pro casional men concerned at the appeal not having been made against the refusal to extend the line under the original commission It was morally impossible, so they contend, to have that commission returned to the colony within the four months of Mr. Crisp's leaving Melbourne It took him over three months after his arrival in London to obtain the necessary instructions for his briefs It must be remembered that the inquiry involved the investigation of all the disputed accounts arising out of the railway contract, the subject of the suit amounting to half a million of money It was one branch of the inquiry to allow that the compromise with the Government for £5,000 was a fair and honest one in order to do this, it was considered necessary to probe each particular claim, which proved a dithcultundpiotractcd task. 'The preparation of these claims took Mr. Williams and a board of engineers over 12 months, and the only one in London capable of throwing light upon them was Mr. Williams himself, There was no legal obligation on his part to go into this matter with Mr. Crisp or any one else, so as to furnish the necessary materials for his examination, and for a considerable time, under the advice of his solicitor, he declined to do so, but eventually, to further the ends of justice, he consented, and went minutely into the case at such periods of leisure as he could command 'his alone, it seems, occupied over three months Notwithstanding the long v ication, Air Crisp has succeeded in obtaining an appointment to retake the evidence under the new commission on the 24th inst, and he hopes to sail for Melbourne in the Ruapehu, which leaves Plymouth for Hobart on the 27th inst " The comedy "Extremes" was again presented at the Theatre Royal on Saturday evening to a very large audience. 'The performance appeared to afford much amusement, and the reception accorded to the leading performers was of the most cordial description. There was a moderate attendance at the Opera-house on Saturday evening, when " Clancarty " was again performed with signal success This drama will be presented for the last time this evening. On Tuesday and the three following nights the Opera house will be closed preparatory to the production of the military drama " in the ranks " The 1 un on the Bristol Company continue to attract large audiences, the BIJOU Theatre being comfortably filled on Saturday evening. Another shilling bulbul concert was given in the Athenaeum hall on Saturday night, before a large audience. The programme was framed with a view to a "grand Scotch night," and the screams) of hearing many of the simple old tunes about which so much has been said lately, doubtless drew to the hall a large proportion of those present. A piano solo, ' Balmoral," played by Mr. G H. Davies, was the first item, and was fairly executed. Madame Fanny Simonsen, who sang 'Comm' Thro' the Rye," was encored M H Poussard next played on the violin a fantasia on Scotch airs, greatly pleasing his hearers, who demanded a rope tion, as they likewise did when, in the second part, he play) ed a fantasia from 'Faust" Mr. G F Smith sang "Logie o' Buchan" and the " Death of Nelson," in good style, and was enthusiastically applauded When encored for the latter he related an incident illustrative of the patriotic spirit which has ever animated the British navy) Madame Leonard was also encored when she s ing "Caller Herrin' " At a subsequent stage of the entertainment she sang, for the first time in Melbourne, " The Broken Pitcher," which consists of some humorous verses set to a taking time, Mr. T, Bergin sang "Bonnie Scotland," and "My Lass," and in both did his best, which is saying a great deal " The Gipsies' Laughing Trio," rendered by Mesdames Simonsen and Leonard, and Mr. T. Bergin, concluded a very enjoyable concert. Professor and Mrs Baldwin added some new features to their entertainment at the Victoria hall on Saturday evening The Davenport Brothers' cabinet trick has been mastered and improved upon by the Professor, who, entering a cabinet alone, is securely tied to a chair by a rope, hands and arms and legs lashed to gether. In less than 30 seconds after being thus tied and the knots sealed, he is able to produce " spiritual" manifestations in a marvellously short space of time. Hands appear at an aperture, musical instruments are used and thrown outside the cabinet, and when the cabinet is re-opened the Professor is found tied as before, with the seals (placed and examined by the committee) on the ropes. He has complete control of "spirit" hands and can get them to answer almost any question desired by his audience. Mrs Baldwin is tied up in a sack. in the cabinet alone, and she is able to obtain similar results, tossing the empty sack, sealed and tied on to the stage Especially clever is Professor Baldwin at thought leading. On Saturday night he fairly astounded his audience by his de\ verity in discovering the thoughts of members of a committee from amongst those present. He did not fail once. The expose of certain spiritualistic tricks was thorough and instructive. Altogether, the entertainment was an interesting one. During the necessary intervals occupied in the work of preparation, the professor keeps up a running fire of humorous dialogue with persons real and imaginary. As usual, the people's concert at the Tem Deruncc-hnll was on 'Saturday evening crowded and the audience appeared to thoroughly on joy the entertainment provided The first part consisted of a minstrel performance by the Combination Serenaders, who were frequently applauded HUB was followed by a variety programme, and the entertainment concluded with the farce, There's millions in it, the characters in the piece being sustained by Messrs West, Burness and Gardner Miss Dwight presided at the piano At the Hall of Science on Saturday evening the Premier Minstrels gave an amusing performance before a large audience The troupe appears again to night The name of Mr A Duff was accidentally omitted from the passenger list of the ship Loch tive from Glasgow We are requested to state that the name of Mr John Hood was accidentally omitted from the list of members of the Melbourne Stock 1 exchange published in Saturday s issue In our advertising columns a notice appears calling public attention to the United Australian Mutual Fire Insurance Company Limited accident department.
