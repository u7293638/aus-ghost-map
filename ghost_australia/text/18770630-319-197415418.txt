At aristocratic Sandown a mixed programme was issued by the authorities, and upon the actual sport perhaps little- need be remarked ; I mean so far as 'it can prove interesting to your readers. Toomuch, however, cannot be written ; in praise of t-he: gathering^ and on every side evidence exists of the increasing popularity of this suburban fixture. Everywhere, the fpark was filled to overflowing, and. the: attendance cast all precedent- into the shado. The. tv/o-y'ear-old Grraoo journeyed from ? Epsom, and despite her . 5 lb. penalty won cleverly the Sandown Park Two-Yoar-OId Stakes. The Grand International Steeplechase, placod on the1 card for the Ia3t' day, was 'productive of a most exciting contest, and Lord Lonsdale's Congress gained only a neck verdict from Sir* J. Lister- Kay's Citizen after running the four miles as straight as an arrovr. ; The ' aged' winnor carried 12 st. 7 lb., while the 6 yrs. old citteen put up 10 8t, 31b,, a half dozen others facing the starter. ' All was now preparation for the Two-Thousand week, or the ' First Spring,' as it is called, and Sunday and ' Monday aaw ' special' ! after 'special' steam from this Babylon of ours to tho metropolis of . tbo. turf. And Newmarket was ready to receive them, hints, however, having previously boon givon that the oast wind still blow across the heath, with tho advice to' intend ing visitors that tho necessary articles should be : provided to guard againBt.its.soyerity. , That tho said hint and advice woro not' uncalled for visitors discovpred, though there was a decided improvement in the weather from that ox porioncod during the Craven gathoring. New market proper looks vory quietly oh during an ordinary race week, and few of . the, quiot inhabitants visit tho heath, but it is against human nature ,not to be infected with tho sporting epidemic abroad during a Two-.Thpusand week, and.a3 a consequence it is a case 'of the shutters being up, at any rate till the great threo-yoar-ald. o.veut is decided. Thongh.it had iong been understood that only, one -of tho throe of the crack two-year-olds : of . last season — Chamant— (Pellegrino and Plunger being the absentees) would put iu au appearance, still a3 there was a dark claimant .to fame in the person of Morier, who hailed from fcho formidable Rusaloy Sfcablo, that had just proviously turned out Juliu3 Ciesar, winner of the City and Suburban, and contained the abovo mentioned Pellogrinoi the interest and excitement in the great race wore in no degree curtailed. More over Morior is an own brother to General Pepl, v/ho, thirteen years ago, won the T'woiThbusand, -and such ' fairy tales had gaiuod credence as to what he could do, and had accomplished with the said Julius Cicsar at home, that all were in a state of feverish restlessness concerning his capabilities, and in connection with ; what ho was expected to accomplish. No ono would back anything else, pxcepting a few of tho stanch students of public form who declined to desert the winlor favorite- Chamant— and consequently the wretched impostor,as ho ultimately proved himsolf to be, started an equal favorito with the latter, 2 to 1 being the starting prico of each. It ia only fair to state that very few people at Newmarket sot eyes on the Rusaley wonder at all until thoy saw him in hopeless trouble in tho raco aftor going a couple of hundred yards. To thegonorai disappointment ho .was not saddled in tub '' birdcage,'. an enclosure that does duty for a saddling paddock, and few could spare the time to. ride down to the old Ditch Stables, situated closo to the starting post, and see him pufc to rights for the contest. Those who did, lowovor, do so at tho last moment, wore upon their return assailed with quorie3 as to Morier's appearance and behavior. Theroports wero invari ably unfavorable, some pronouncing him a 'coach horse,' others declaring that he could neither walk, trot, nor canter, and many asserted that he was actually lame. _ Still vrith blind infatuation folks stuck to thoir fancy, remembering the character they had received oftho horao, and awaited the result with.' slightly increased interest perhaps, but little suspecting tho extraordinary sight about to bo presented to them. Morier got woll away, but a hundred yards had not been traversod before he was in trouble, another hundred and he Jiung out signals of distress, and in answer to a vicious cut of. his jockey's whip he flourished his tail like a 'country stallion' and labored home in the rear, while the further his opponont went the further was he beaten. .Ac a set-off, however, ngainst this inglorious defeat of a great public favorite, I may remark that public form was triumphantly verified, as Chamant, whose name in previous letters I have so frequently had occasion to mention, galloped over his opponents all tho way, and ultimately won in a canter by a longth. Chamant is a Fronch bred horse, hailing from the Gladiateur stable. Ho is by Mortemer out of Araucaria, and as a two year old last season won tho Middle Park Plato and the Dowhurst PJate, two of tho most important two-yoar-old items of tho whole year. Ono of tho surprises' in the raco was tho forward position obtained by Lexington out of Britannia;, who Was second, particularly as in the saddling onclosnro 100 to 1 would hardly havo boon accepted about him, owing to his generally backward aud mean appearance. Brown Prince, iiowevor, is a horso ot immense substance, with powerful quarters and groat limbs, though there is a want of quality about him, particularly when comparod with. Chamant, that would lead ono almost' to suppose that in Uia coutchoon there lurks a sinister bar, 'a taint of tho baso blaok blood.'

Thoso on the extremo right, therefore, _\ycro Manoeuvre, Deo, Helena, and Lo'nt LillyJ-tind when tho ilag fell, without much delay, G.ivotto and Piaisanto made joint ruuning from Miriam and Mirobolanto, and they wero followed by Nitocris, Tributo, Lady Golightly, Lady Ronald and Morgiana, with Palm Flower and Belphcobo at the head of tho remainder, and Lent Lily last of all.

But no, tho es tablishment was destined to play yet another sensational part in. turf history, and tho Chester Cup was to bo tho medium. The ex-hurdle jumper Hampton, whostf name I have, had occa-' sion to mention bofore as landing a great coup in the Goodwood Stakes last year, wasy the moment the weights appeared for tho Che&tor; Cup, con sidered to hava such an undeniable chanca for that event that few neglected tho opportunity of having, something: on, and as a large amount of money supporting him was known to come from the atablo connections, ho was quickly made favorite, and remained at the head of tho quota tions till past tho eleventh hour. Suddenly? how ever, the pen was put through hi3 name, and what a howl wont-up from disappointed and dis gusted backers. .- Many an oven-tempered man spoke out of his turn, and the epithets bestowed upon thoso supposed to bo answerable for tho proceedings wero moro suggestive than elegant or perhaps .wise, ' Ia well-informed quarters it is hinted that a certain amount of justification rests with tho owner of the horse, as' he being anxious to back him could not get anything like a reasonable price offered and considering lie had been unwarrantably fore stalled,, immediately arrived at the determination to, scratch him. With Hampton out of the way, a run was made upon Lord Rosebery's Snail and Lord Wilton's Footstep, while Mr. Baltazzi's John Day was greatly fancied by his friends. Neither, however, pulled through, and as tho .result .proved, backers and prophets v/ere 'floored to a man.' Mr. F. Gretton's gelding Pageant, who, ?since ho ran second for the Cesarowitch in 1875, has many time3 been expected to do great things, won -in a common; cantor by four lengths, his starting price being 100. to Q.

Still increasing her lead, the Malton mare went on, followed by Sans Reproche, High land Laddie, Newport, and Pageant, who had been pulled back, Suail and Footstep coming next, and John Day and Clonave bringing up the rear.

Af tsr passing the Stand for tho second time, Newport shot out and took the command, and when leaving fcho straight had increased the load to two lengths, aud Skotzka, hopelessly beaten, drifted, further and further into the rear, Collin'bourno now went on in pursuit of Newport, being followed by Sans Roprocho to the five furlongs post, when John Day began to make up some of his ground^ as also did Olonavo, the pair taking a good . position, and at the half-mile post were first riad second, the Irishman being now at the head of affairs, with Collingbourno third.
