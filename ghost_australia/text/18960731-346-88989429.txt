TEE TRAMS. (To tiie Editor of the Advertises.) Sir,—By the last half-yearly report of t&B; Bendigo '.Tram Co. it seems probable that thi trams will cease to run in the vert near future if something is not done to keep them alive. Looking back from the commencement to the present time of the company's existence, I cannot see anything the company has done to court popularity, 'which would be the first means of securing a profitable business. As a citizen of Bendigo, I would suggest that the compwj divide its journey to Eig'ehawk into one penny sections, say, from Charing Cross '11 Wattle-street, Id ; from Wattle-street tolng^ wood road, Id : from ihere to Long Gullvi and so on to Eaglehawk. If the company to try three months of this system bewH "giving up the ghost," it would then be able to say it had done something to try and get the patronage of the general public. Of ccurM there are abundant interest?, even outside tu poor cabby, who would be happy to see tM Tram Company give its last gasp. For my"*® part I should like to see the company succrfa as it has had all the roughest time ofaW°' pany's life. To return to the uncertainty inconvenience of the cab is a very retrogress1^8 move, to say the leaat of it. That thecompHtf has to keep in repiir the roads for ths ea',®Ei to take its revenue away seems rather nsf luck; yet there are some of the gJD public who say that the Tram Company slid make an effort to run cabfcy eff, ard tnen'_ would not have his road to keep in repair. ^ [ have no interest in the Tram Company. , !' I iog that the company will give the aoovs^ I BJme other system a trial before it V "'u;* OJ- TRAM. lours, etc.,
