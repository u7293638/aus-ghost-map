STICKING TO LIFE. The tenacity with which some men cling to life is marvellous. We had an instance of this in the case of a noted pugilist, several years ago, who was shot in the breast during a barroom scuffle, and his condition was pronounced hopeless by the surgeons. But he scoffed at their opinions, and actually lived several days with a ball in his heart ; keeping his hold upon life-so it seemed by sheer force of will. A resolute determination not to succumb is, as every army surgeon knows, the salvation of many a wounded soldier, who without it would assuredly die. In the Crimean War the mortality among the wounded Turks was much greater than among the wounded French and English. The latter wrestled stoutly with death, and. often baffled him when their doom Feemed inevitable ; but the predestinarían Mussulman, when dangerously injured, said gloomily, " It is my kismet" (fate), turned his face towards Mecca, and gave up the ghost. There can be no doubt tbat love of life and vigor of will have been the means of restoring to health thousands of patients who, but for these mental characteristics, must have perished. He (reading) : " Chicken, roast beef, roast lamb» turkey, beefsteak and onions-" She (interrupt ing) : " I know what I would like-that is, if you ate some too !" He (ordering without hesitancy) " Beefsteak and onions for two !" She (raptur oulsy) : " Oh, George."
