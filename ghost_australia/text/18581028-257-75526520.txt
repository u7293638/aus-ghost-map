LAYING THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, IPSWICH On Monday, the 25th, the interesting ceremony of laying the foundation stone of the new Catholic Church, to be erected at Ipswich, was performed by his Grace Archbishop Polding, assisted by the Very Reverend Dean Rigney, and the Reverend William McGinty. The time appointed was two o'clock, and at that hour, although the atmosphere had a. most threatening aspect, nearly two thousand persons had assembled, including several of the most influential men of the town, and many of opposite religious opinions. It was not however before four o'clock that the Venerable Prelate, in full pontificals, arrived on the ground, and the spectacle then presented to us was certainly calculated to produce impressions of an ineffaceable character. His Grace, in a few appropriate remarks, explained to the vast concourse the purpose of the meeting, and after the usual prayers had been offered, he proceeded to lay the foundation stone. In a cavity prepared beneath the principal atone of the building was placed a bottle, con taining the North Australian, of the 19th, beautifully printed on white satin, a number of the latest current coins of Great Britain, and a few coins of an old date of other countries and. a parchment scroul, on which was neatly engrossed a Latin inscription. The following translation of which was kindly furnished us. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghostâ€” Amen.
