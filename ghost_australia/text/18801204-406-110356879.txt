KADIN A READING BOOM. ; (TO THE SDHvon OF THE WA&LAROO; TIStES.) A few days ago as is'my wont I went into , the above leading room and seeing bo one concluded that I was alone. Judge sir, of my J surprise, when in a few momenta an object j rose noiselessly from behind the counter and j stood erect, X didu't scream ; but thinking that like Hamlet's ghost as it spoke not it would bespoken to, I ventured to interrogate my noiseless and noeuspccted neighbour and found that he was a would be student of a map of South Australia,and had gone.behind the counter in search for one, but failing in his search, he put the following query which through yon I will put to the committee. couldn't a map be provided from the funds of the Institute and suspended on the wall. A second question I was asked this week by a subscriber, when will a fresh box of books be received. My informant says that some months have elapsed since a fresh book was obtainable. And I will add a third question is there any good reason wby the Illustrated London .News should so soon be removed fro in the table to the obscurity beneath the counter P giving the Librarian all credit for taking care of the papers there surely can be no objection to leaving an old copy on the table till a fresh one comes to band. Let me assure the com mittee that these lines are not wiitten to find j fault, and the only reply I expect or desire } is that if possible they will furnish the room I with a map, tbe shelves with some new books, and allow the paper to remain on the table accessible to all. —I am,&c.; PROGKESS. i —^i ti i «
