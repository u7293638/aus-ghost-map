W¥ hkMW PMS. Drifting- : How I love to lie iti my pulsing boat, And drowsily drift and dream ! Where the sheen of the lilies like stars afloat . la mirrored in the stream ; And the clouds that rest In the golden .west . Have the woof of a poet's dream. How eof fly the shadows creep oat and apart ' . Like ghosts of the dying day ; While a breath from an upland meadow's heart . Is sweet with the new-mown hay, Till it turns to a breeze 'mid the rustling trees, And shudders and dies a*ay. ' Then little by little the stars pe^p out, Till their splendour fills the sky; And the hurrying swallows all about, Like wraiths go flitting by. Through the purple night with wings as light As a tired baby's sigh. ! — St. Louis Globe- Democrat, ;
