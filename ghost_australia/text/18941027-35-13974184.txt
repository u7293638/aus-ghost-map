time the results of their labours Mill become known in the ordinary course of official routine, and then, possibly, if nothing of greater political urgency should stand in the way, the Governments of the colonies may see fit to consider whether further steps should be taken Meanwhile interest attaches to the enumeration of the matters submitted to the Conference for consideration The first business, as will be soon elsewhere, was to consider a general scheme of defence which should be applicable on federal lines to the whole of the Australian colonies and Tasmania. This was a large order, but, as Major General EnyvAliDts pointed out in his report of 1889, no general defence of Australia can be under taken unless its distant parts are connected with the more populous colonies on the south and east of the continent If an enemy were established in either Western Australia or Port Darwin we should be powerless to act against him In this respect although the situation has been modified from the naval side by the presence of the Auxiliary Squadron, the connection by land has not been made, and from the military point of view we are as we were fit of years ago It was also remarked at that time that the position of Tasmania, with its harbours and coal supply, would, if the island were made a base of operations against Australia by an enemy, be a more serious danger than is the isola- tion of Western Australia and Port Darwin The presence of a Tasmanian representative at the Conference is an indication that this warning has not been lost sight of , but whether the recommendations of the Conference have any reference to the other dangers seems doubtful, seeing that the deliberations proceeded on the understanding, as set forth under the second heading on the business paper, that the existing military forces are to be taken as a basis, increase being inexpedient in the actual conditions Under this second heading the conference had to consider what would be a fair allotment of troops for federal purposes due from each colony Ma] or General EDWARDS, dealing with the number of the troops maintained by the different colonies at the time, but laying down suggestions for the reorganisation of these forces, recommended the creation as the units of combination of brigades of all arms, each complete in every detail, and consisting, on the peace establishment, of 1910 mon Each of these, when mobilised for war, could be expanded to 3000 men, or, if reasonable time were allowed, to 5000 In his view, Queensland and South Australia could supply one brigade each, and New South Wales and Victoria could supply three oath Arrangements could then be made for the protection of the coast from Brisbane to Adelaide by the troops under the disposal of the local commandants but the several divisions could also be assembled and formed into a considerable army of 30,000 or 40,000 mon at any point on the coast from the head of Spencer's Gulf in South Australia to Moreton Bay in Queensland, and even, when the railway was completed, as far as Rockhampton This scheme seemed to contemplate the possible withdrawal of all, or nearly all, the troops from other colonies for the purpose of concentrating a force at any one point attacked or threatened If it be so, the discussion by the Conference of the question " What would be a fair allotment of troops from each colony for federal purposes?" indicates a modification of that idea in a direction that would be more likely to command approval Major-General EDWARDES recommended the amalgamation of the permanent forces of Garrison Artillery and Submarine Miners, there numbering mall the colonies 927 men, into one corps, distinguished from the Field Artillery, and under one head There is no express re- science to this is the business paper of the Conference, but the matter may have been considered under the general question of organisation. The fifth and last subject of reference was the appointment of a consulting military engineer to promote the efficiency of the defence of the colonies. Major-General ED- WARDES recommended the appointment of an officer of the rank of Lieutenant-General, without specifying an engineer, to advise and inspEct in peace and command in war. The subject submitted for the consideration of the Conference, therefore, fall short of the recommendation of our former adviser in so far as the question of ultimate command was concerned. Possibly that has been regarded as a matter for the politicians rather than the soldiers to deal with. And this leads us to what may be formed the crucial test of the whole project. It is reported that the recommendations of the conference are, as a whole, considered by Major-General HUTTON to be satisfactory, and that he hopes that the politicians will do their part. Here we have before us a different phase of the question. It was made a part of the business of the Conference to consider the outlines of a military bill which should place the whole of the forces in the colonies on a similar basis as regards military service, discipline, and pay, on the supposition that such a bill " could be adopted forthwith, or. accepted only when the national emergency arose." There is a hopefulness in the words we have quoted which is hardly warranted by experience in the workings of colonial political human nature. Major-General EDWARDES recognised the necessity for what he termed " a common Defence Act." But the military bill suggested above would, if the description be adequate, not nearly come up to the requirements of the situation. The adoption forthwith of a bill framed even upon the comparatively narrow lines laid down for consideration would be a marvel and a novelty in our political history ; but what can be said of the chances of a bill dealing not only with questions of service and discipline and pay, but also with the higher questions of ultimate and practically absolute control, without which the so-called federal connection would be a rope of sand? If it be said that we have solved a similar question by the passing of uniform Acts in the different colonies for the purpose of of creating and maintaining the Auxiliary Naval Force, and placing it under the command of the Imperial Naval Commandant, it may be said first that those Acts were not passed without difficulty, and that for some time one of the colonies would have nothing to do with the movement. But the important consideration is that there is really no such analogy between the two cases to justify us in arguing from the one to the other. In the case of the naval force the colonies have simply gone into partnership with the Imperial Government, contributing some funds towards the support of what is, except for some limitations, a part of the Imperial navy, on the under stauding-nocossary in this case that the command should rest in Imperial hands. If we had an Imperial army in Australia, under an Imperial commander, and we consented to strengthen it by raising a few regiments to form part of it at our own expense, there would be some approach to a parallel. But the merging of the separate forces of these independent colonies in one united Australian force for purposes of mutual defence would be a very different matter when the question of ultimate control had to be settled in one way by the half-dozen independent Parliaments before whom it would have to come for settlement. Whatever the attitude of the public mind may be in regard to religion and the mystic questions related to it, it can- not be said to be one of indifference Day by day the columns of the Herald afford proof of the fact that no inconsiderable section of the community is intensely concerned in the extra material interests of human life. In one of our issues, this week, besides the sequence of religious addresses of a somi-sonsational or at least an unconventional character attended by great crowds, and the deliverance of a religious body defining its social relations, we note among the announcements and reports a lecture delivered on Theosophy, another lecture to be delivered on the same subject, a periodical meeting of spiritualists, and a lecture delivered on Spiritualism. Those are but the ripple on the surface indicating the movements proceeding away down in the individual and social mind throughout a large portion of society. Whether all this makes for good or ill, or partly for one and partly for the other, it indicates a condition that is undoniablo,and which one might think to be in a manner out of touch with the absorbing material interest with which we are all supposed to be inspired, as to the great and ever-present questions of what we are to eat, and what to drink, and where withal we shall be clothed, and where and how we are to find the means for this desirable consummation. It was said at tho close of the last century that questions of a theological or quasi theological kind had so solved or exhausted themselves that by-and-bye nobody would have anything to say about them. Just as it was thought by some that politics would reach finality, and that when the struggles for doctoral reform and extension of the franchise were over, and everybody had secured freedom of electoral privileges, reformers should have nothing more to fight for, and the book would close. But as the utmost extension of the franchise but opened the door to a limitless vista of things clamorously demanding legislative repair, and interests crop up that never were dreamt of, and the prospect lengthens and widens the further we go, so it appears to be in respect of the seemingly closed book of extra-material questions in regard to which we are just now in the midst of a boom. Perhaps it may be that spirit of unrest which is so characteristic of the age we live in. The century has been engaged in grappling with and conquering every kind of difficulty, and the appetite has been whetted for other things to conquer. People are manured with Golden explanations and theories of things, and the triumphant air that looks back pityingly to the lumbering stage coach and the sailing packet, the tallow candle, and the old flint lock, has a sense of obsolotoness regarding all that fitted into the humdrum life of our forefathers, and it must have everything to its order now as fresh as paint. The Atlantic greyhound and the Flying Scotchman, the quick-firing gun and the electric light, and all the brood of new and fast things have cast their glamour over the mind, and have had much to do in shaking people adrift from the moorings of their chiefs, and handing them over to those that poop and butter about the unknown and the unseen. One might think that a sceptical age like ours would be the last of all to surrender itself to credulity. But, unsettled as the mind has been by the louhi'irsemint of all old habits and ways, it has an inherent craving for rest and as human nature can never shake itself free from the sense that there is a something beyond, it lends an oar to anyone that professes to tell it of the occult. Scepticism and faith may seem as remote as the poles apart, but doubt that is merely the outcome of a mind Lass, which has weighed things in the balance and thought them wanting, lends itself not unreadily to someone that offers what is new and full of fresh promises and a mind that has been hurried along in the whirlwind of the progress of the times is not un- reasonably tempted by a something in accordance with, and yet a deliverance from the splash and the splutter of life. Spiritualism and Theosophy of both of which one would speak with respect, as apparently the cults of a multitude of people though they seem to be unre- lated, if not inconsistent with one another, have this in common, that they have both something fresh to present, and both of them carry the thoughts over the line that shuts in our humdrum humanity. The one may be creepy, and the other may be dreamy, but they both present a solace to ennui and if people have cast off religion like the dust from the whirling wheels of their progress, they each in its way, give a sort of a substitute in carrying one's thoughts into the suporaensuous. The Mahatma may be a remote and uncomfortable sort of entity for attainment and there must be few in Sydney who can cheerfully contemplates pursuing the roundabout way of Reincarnation for thousands of years with any very exhilarating sense of the prospect of becoming a Mahatma ; still there is a pleasant psychical pleasure, perhaps in dissecting oneself, and in differentiating one's desire body, and astral body, and other developments, to say nothing of the bodies of the possible statesmen and princes one's pinches may animate before attaining to that high degree. Any way, to the mind pressed down with material embarrassments, Theosophy gives an escape; and the very intensity of life predisposes for accepting this or anything that lifts the mind out of the grinding of materialism. It is the same with Spiritualism. It is a most spiritual ago we live in, but that is just why it lands itself to Spiritualism. Naturally enough it was in America, where everybody day and night is after the dollar, that the cult evolved and taking the mind of Jonathan away from his dollars to the mystic realm of the spooks, it provided the contrast that his dual nature craved. And so when little " Cissy " with her box of chocolates, and "Geordie" with his inani- ties come from over the line to cultivate our fellowship, we take them on their showing, and the uncanny, creepy feeling of trust that we have is a natural reaction from the sordid pressure of material things. Of course if we could utilise them to any better purpose than taking tables, or spoiling their names ; if we could tap their spook love to any extent, and loans from them something more than we know our selves of the problem of life, or of the conditions of immortality ; if we could even make use of them in bringing us a message from Mars, and find by them what the canal cutters there are up to, they might afford us another and more substantial gratification. But a mere nodding acquaintance with a ghost is a satisfaction to that side of our nature which craves for the mysterious and the awesome and so far from our wondering at the interest booming now in the extra-material or mystic side of life, it appears to be simply a rebound from the intensity of strain of material fires. From a report in yesterday's Herald it appears that on the previous day a meeting of the Public Works Committee was held at which a witness was examined as to the value of possible resumptions in connection with the scheme for replacing the Pyrmont Bridge, and " the evidence was taken with closed doors." There seems to be a fatality attending the Public Works Act, under the influence of which people engaged in its administration set aside or override its express provisions with impunity. It has been strained and twisted out of shape by Ministerial action, and Parliament has looked on passively and condoned the wrong. Now the Committee itself is acting in contravention of its directions. Soon after the constitution of the first Committee we had occasion to comment upon some evidence taken in the course of of an inquiry, and hints were thrown out at the next meeting that if there were a repetition of the proceeding the public might be shut out. After the Committee had been reminded that the Act expressly directed that the sittings should be held with open doors, nothing more was heard upon this point. Six years have passed, and now the Committee sits with closed doors. Perhaps it will be said that it is desirable that evidence about resumption values should be taken privately. It may be said on the other side that as the State does not want to overreach any one, and as there is a tendency to surround all transactions between the State and private people for the resumption or purchase of land with suspicion, it is especially desirable that this kind of evidence should be taken in the broad daylight of publicity. But we are not concerned to inquire now which of these views has the preponderance of argument to support it. The point is that the Legislature, having this question in sight, decided in favour of publicity, and that it is not for the Committee, which is the creature of the statute, and has no powers beyond those conferred upon it by the statute, to overrule the decision of the Legislature. The words of section 7 of the Act of 1888 are conclusive "Such committee shall sit in open court." And it is worthy of remark that when in 1889 it was found expedient to amend the Act in some respects, this provision was expressly cited in the preamble of the amending statute, and it was provided that the sectional committees, the appointmont of which was then authorised, should also "sit in open court." The Committee might as well proceed to business without a quorum, or determine that questions as they arise should be decided by a minority of votes of the members present, instead of a majority as prescribed by the law, as destroy this guarantee for publicity which the Legislature has required In so emphatic a manner. The petition of a considerable body of the New Australia immigrants in Paraguay praying the Premier to have them taken back to Australia indicates one of the last and most significant phases of that unfortunate enterprise. Nobody should feel in his heart to taunt them with their folly now. They are too unhappy to evoke anything but a feeling of pity. And there may be few, if there will be any, a 7in Tnf rfin9ta\os^Mhud< -38 if the Government is pleased reach out its hand to help The "M that were uttered time and again country against the expedition wow it leaders of themovement-by any hostile,?! to labour which may have hAS into prominence in the conflicts C tween employers and employees If I had been any clear prospect of the em,. grants bettering themselves in harness home in the heart of South Americans as all colonists would have regretted Bec. ing so much good colonising material lost to the country people generally would have bid the wanderers God speed I only wished that they should be harry But the conditions were such that all experience of human nature pointed to inevitable failure, and there were f» left behind them in Australia, except the enthusiasts blinded by the same glamour who did not confidently expect the whole affair to end is now, man appeal for her to return Had the leader been in some way invested with absolutoauthorih with adequate powers to compel obedience h might, if gifted with ability, have welded the settlement into unity by force Or if the constituent elements of Uni society had been so regenerated in their human nature that all elements of self-interest and self- will and separate feeling had been eliminated, it would have been conceivable that the people might have lived together, no one living to him. self, but each for the other and all for all in a self-denying community of brotherhood But a rich regeneration would mean more than the more impulse of ontk siasm, and a training in colonial life by not given to produce that delectable condition of a perfect altruism in which each esteemed the other better than himself, The former method of the autocracy appears to have been tried, but the conditions were not adequate, and the hour? hand of the President coming don appears to have acted like the shattering of glass. The lesson will not be lay? perhaps, on those disposed to sigh roman- tically for some Utopia where society might crystallise itself into now and happier forms And there will probably be more than the unfortunate wanderers themselves who will think that, after all, there may be worse places than Old Australia.
