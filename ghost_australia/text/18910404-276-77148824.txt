STRAY NOTES. (By JAMB3 GBASSIE.) Philosophers shrink from examining too :loo6ly the resemblance whtoh the inferior inimals bear to man, aa an analysia of that resemblance tends to link them as slightly se parated groupa of one great family, for mya« terioua and oomplio&ted; as the human frame is, there is n corresponding mystery in the struoture of each of the quadrupeds, When Survey discovered the oiroulfttion of the blood id man, ho thought he had made & detao« tiouthat would uphold the inferiority of the four-footed animals, but it ia now known tlmt the blood oiroulatea in them also, and Dr. Jenner found that the cow carried the antidote to a painful human disease in the pigment that underlies the skin, Pasteur found that the saliva of a dog oan convey rabies to a human being, and Martin elicited the startling faot that man is as liable to fluke or hydatids as sheep are. Wo know that dogs and horses dream in steep, and that they are superstitious and are so afraid of ghosts that they dread to be out at night, And we have reason to be> liave that all human beings in the first stage of civilization believed in ghosts also, The ancient Scandinavians believed in good ghosts and bad ghosts, and finally they seleoted one from eaoh group and placed it over the others. Thor came into existence in that manner and so did Vishnu and Siva in India, Brahma and Buddah were ghosts in their first stage, and Joss, an advanced type of the Chinese' disembodied spirit, The Boddaoh Glass, the BenBhee and fairies in North Britain and Ireland had a similar origin, and we know that dreams had much importance in the .Scriptural times. But the oreature that bears the cloaeat resemblance to man is the most ungainly on earth, namely, the gorilla, and. its resemblance ia ao close that for every tegument, tissue, and function in the human frame a corresponding one can be found in it also, But although it has all the organs of speeoh com plete, it oannot Bpeak, and whether it has any thing corresponding to a soul we cannot decide in consequence of the many conflicting opinions that men entertain regarding that vital principle, John Tyndal and his aohool ignore the soul altogether ; but Milton, Newton, and Napoleon believed in it firmly. " Look up into that starry sky," said the latter, " and you will see ample proof that there is a God, and if He made man in His own image, He did not make him to be swallowed up and lost in the wide womb of unoreated night after a miserably short probation on earth !" The goist of these remarks is ft desire to show that the inferior animals may be, and probably are, nearer to us in affinity than we think, ana we should, therefore, make their yoke as easy and their burden as light gs we can, and cruelty to them under any circumstances ought to be severely punished. They cannot remonstrate, like Balaam's ass, against wrong, and, therefore, any good man ought to be the angel in their road to proteot them from unnecessary torture, Tyndal, however, considers the '* image" figurative of man's mind and intelligense, and denies that a great spirit could bear the form of a gorilla. When Dr, Simpson diacovered his formio aoid (chloroform) he fancied, like Harvey, that it would only operate on human beings j but it deadens the Bensation of pain in the inferior animals as much as it does in the human family, and the symptoms that indicate snake bite in a horse are precisely those that denote it in a man, aud the same antidote is the cure -when cure is possible-in both oases, The first- articulate sound that & ohild uttera is "Ma 1" (Hebrew, "breaat"), and the younsf gorilla, the lamb, and a kitten use the same Bound, and all the inferior animals seem to be aware that death will overtake them, and when it is near they seleot secluded places to die in, CHINESE PBOVERB3, SeeBt thou a man diligent in his business) he will stand before kings, he will not eit in the presenoe of mean men, Seest thou a woman fonder of her neighbour's house than her own» Bhe will stand before beggars, and her home will vanish like the morning mist,
