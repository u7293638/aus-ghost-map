Observing a certain simiiarity between our cases, J will rjoyrj' yritii ^ptirpermission, fela^ ^w'I was induced to forsake thp Stormy friid ,un.sa,tbfac'tory. career of political agitation for the peaceful pursuit of our niutual profession. A very few years since, when the league had passed its zenith, and I. as its secretary and consistent advocate/ w^s attempting to faults vitality by struggling newspaper? and serials, the Mure of a publisher and printer conperted with pur association (fogged rue tojeek the sanctuary of the Bankruptcy Cp\jrt. 0nrhig the iiecessary investigations, it transpired that t wa,s the of an officer, who had been Equerry to the late King of Hanover, that I had been brought up to the bar, and that had evinced considerable talents for poetical composition, but that I hjjul been earjy inoculated with the Chartist mania, had given myself up body and soul to (lie cause of the " people," and that my profession liyag virtually abandoned. It .was then suggested to n^e that I should rpnapnee, not indeed my interest In political afiairs, for that would liave been impossible, but the pursuit of political agitation as the business Qf life, and /steadily devote myself to my early flange the la>y. To tell you the truth I had long before bitterly felt that my pristine idol the " people" were not worthy of the sacrifices I had heep malung for them, and the radical chauges, such as I had been adrpcatiflg, cpu!4 pot, uqjes? we wished to excite in England the social miseries of the Frencji Rpyolujipii and the disruption of society, which has sine*; almost uninterruptedly prevailed in that country, be carried out except feydegrees apd by ji system of compromise, No dpubt your Experience, in a ne^v country and AvitJx a young' population filled w^tli UtQpiau idea? ?$>PUt t|ie distributioii of wealth and political power, although dissimilar in practical working to mine, will lead, ultimately, to a similar result. Under the circumstances I have referred to above, I submitted to the better judgment of my friends, and have since successfully renewed my professional intercourse at the local bar of this great town, never directly or indirpptly interfering with the bane of my earlier grass-politics, Indeed, I question if, ton years hence, when J sjiall probably be independent of my profession, I shall .desire to reenter the political arpnpi ps a combatant, certainly not as the advocate of all the points of my, once immaculate Charter. From all sources I " learn that you have been as single minded, sincere, and self sacrificing in ihepursuit of what I, at the outset of this letter, ealied your political pbapt&sm; as I was in mipe. Having now "laid" your '(ghost," however little to your sa tisfaction^ let me entreat of you todivorce yourself from the culture Of that insidious wilLo'rtherwisp the " people," and to reject the slippery offerings of those stump allies who applauded your, poli^ tical prescience and traded on your enthusiasm and purity. Fall baok on your profession, pur Bt simple, and youwill have no Oayse to rue your determination. Believe me, on a cool consideration of the subject, you will allow that all political wisdom does not consist in pandering to the wayward wishes of the multitude; nor in investing them wilt responsibilities they do not value or know how to exercise. Neither is it shown by keeping open the ever rankling feud between capital and labour, nor in cherishing the fend imagination that you alone are in possession of the legislative philosopher's stone -which is to create the political and social mijlenium, and that all the measures of your opponents are merely framed to make the spoor poorer and more enslaved, and the rich richer and more overbearing. That J maysopnhave the gratification of hearing of your elevation from, th? petty squabbles and wretched " goods sold ana delivered'' cases of the Ooy&ty; ^Qdurt to the invigorating intelligence and the - more enlarged discussions of the Supreme Court, and that your politics may soon toe as rupty as tlje . stuff gownpn ^nivf^aq. your (^typifi back, is the iwa sincere fcwtQtype, wish of V ?
