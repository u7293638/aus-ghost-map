Rogers then traced the bistory of, the Papacy from the earliest timeB, showing how the Popes had acquired their temporal possessions. These were the free gift of a tree people, and if ere not acquired by the. usual means resorted to—®6ne)y, pillage, rapine, or .conquest., The Popes devoted a great portion of their revenue to the ( pooryand ^tp the, advancement of the arts apd Boi^n'ces. - If..,tbey 4ooked to the,,title; for; this temporal power there was., qo earthly kingdom that oo.uld be compared to .it in length of enjoyment, inhere: is no Royal j,house existing ,,-«t present ..so ancient al the Papacy. .Jju comparison with it the oldest regal houses, in Europe are but as i yesterday. ;It, was the [ oldest dynasty: in Europe* and-p$rhaps in the wprld.
